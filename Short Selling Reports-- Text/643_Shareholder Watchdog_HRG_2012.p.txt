Harbinger Group's Sum-of-Parts Does Not Add Up
Nov. 20, 2012 9:01 AM ET34 comments
by: Shareholder Watchdog


Over the past few years, we have built a pretty solid track record on Seeking Alpha around
identifying mispriced stocks that have had significant moves following our articles. Our
eleven articles include short recommendations on six stocks that subsequently declined
between 65% and 99% (including LPHI, JTX, HUSA, PCBC, REE, and HMPR). We like to
think that our thorough analysis of facts has helped the investment community. We believe
Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE:HRG), a holding company that currently has two significant
assets, shares characteristics with many of the short ideas discussed in our previous
work. It would appear that several promotional Seeking Alpha articles and a recent
Barron's promotional interview may have contributed to the mis-valuation. We believe the
stock is misunderstood by investors and overvalued on a fundamental basis by at least
23%. Given our view of significant risks with management and its largest shareholder, we
believe investors could face between 35% to 50% downside from current levels.


By way of background, embattled hedge fund manager Phillip Falcone and his hedge
fund, Harbinger Capital, acquired a shell company Zapata Corporation in July 2009 and
renamed it Harbinger Group (sometimes referred to as "HGI" but we will reference it by its
ticker "HRG" in this article). In the fall of 2010, the hedge fund, Harbinger Capital,
contributed / sold its ownership in Spectrum Brands (NYSE:SPB) to HRG for cash and
shares. Phillip Falcone, the founder of Harbinger Capital, made a name for himself by
shorting the subprime mortgage space in 2007. The firm's AUM peaked at $26 billion in
2008. However, following a series of bad investments and allegations of wrongdoing that
resulted in the SEC charging Falcone and Harbinger Capital with fraud in June 2012, the
firm's assets declined precipitously. According to industry articles, Harbinger Capital's
assets were only $4 billion at the end of 2011, with the disastrous investment in
LightSquared representing $3 billion of the remaining assets (marked down 59%). The
Wall Street Journal reported that AUM was $3 billion at the end of March 2012, a few
months before LightSquared's bankruptcy filing in May 2012. The public reports suggest
AUM at Harbinger Capital has declined despite precluding investors from redeeming their
interest in the funds.


Turning back to HRG, it should be a considerable part of any investment discussion to
emphasize that the largest shareholder of HRG is Harbinger Capital. Despite his
significant legal woes, Phillip Falcone not only runs the hedge fund, but he is also the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 2/18


CEO of HRG. If he is convicted of SEC charges, we do not believe he will be able to
continue acting as an executive of the company. According to its 10K, HRG employed only
nine people in September 2011 at the holding company. A more recent disclosure from
June 2012 highlights 18 "officers and employees." We were only able to identify four
employees and three board members who are not current, or former, employees of
Harbinger Capital. After reading through numerous lawsuits, press reports and the SEC
accusations, we do not believe the overlap with Harbinger Capital is a positive for HRG
shareholders. Based on our analysis, we believe most HRG shareholders would be
surprised to learn that HRG appears to be Harbinger Capital's last liquid investment
(according to its 13F filing, which is somewhat confusing). If Harbinger or Falcone is
convicted of SEC charges, or if Falcone is barred from the securities industry as part of a
settlement or conviction, we have trouble conceiving a scenario where Harbinger Capital
is not shut down, likely resulting in the sale or distribution of its HRG position. To
demonstrate the extreme risk to HRG shareholders, we estimate it could take Harbinger
over nine years to liquidate its HRG shares based on the trailing three-month trading
volume.


In late June 2012, the SEC filed civil actions against Falcone and Harbinger Capital,
accusing Falcone and the firm of fraud. Despite the possible negative implications, HRG's
stock price has nearly doubled as investors appear to be completely unaware of the broad
risks. The SEC's charges include three separate complaints:


1) According to the complaint, "Falcone and Harbinger engaged in two fraudulent
schemes that disadvantaged investors and elevated Falcone and Harbinger's interests
above the interests of the funds they advised." The SEC alleges that Falcone
misappropriated $113 million from a Harbinger fund in order to pay a personal tax in April
2009. At the time, Falcone was renovating his $49 million Manhattan mansion, "traveled
on a private jet, employed body guards and funded his wife Lisa's new career as a film
producer." Falcone did not want to use his own assets (which included hockey team
investments, a vacation home and art collection), but instead "borrowed cash from one of
his Harbinger Capital Partners LLC funds, using his clients' money without their
knowledge." In addition, the SEC alleged he provided certain of his large investors like
Goldman Sachs with favorable redemption and liquidity terms that enabled him to "impose
more stringent redemption restrictions" on other investors.


2) The SEC charged Falcone and Harbinger with market manipulation related to an "illegal
short squeeze." Harbinger Capital acquired 113% of distressed high yield bond issued by
MAAX Holdings after Falcone discovered that his prime brokerage firm was short the

bonds. The SEC claims he manipulated the securities price in order to maximize losses at
his prime broker.


3) The SEC charged Falcone and Harbinger with Rule 105 violations. The SEC noted
three instances where Harbinger actively shorted stocks within the restricted period before
a public equity offering and covered the short with deal shares, a direct violation of
Regulation M of Rule 105.


Describing the lawsuits, Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement
stated that: "Today's charges read like the final exam in a graduate school course in how
to operate a hedge fund unlawfully." According to Forbes, Falcone "reportedly rejected a
settlement offer that would have banned him from the securities industry, which would
have prevented him from keeping position like being CEO of Harbinger Group." Despite
the negative headlines associated with its CEO and largest shareholder, HRG has been
one of the best performing stocks of 2012. Let's examine why we believe investors may be
so misguided.


HRG's First Investment: Spectrum Brands


The largest asset at the holding company is the 29.7 million shares of Spectrum Brands,
or nearly 58% of shares out. SPB is a roll-up that sells a range of products from small
appliances to consumer batteries, shaving products, pet supplies, and lawn & garden and
pest control products. Its brands include: Rayovac Batteries, George Foreman grills,
Remington, Black & Decker, Russell Hobbs, Toastmaster, Varta, Farberware, Tetra,
Marineland, Nature's Miracle, Dingo, 8-in-1, FURminator, Littermaid, Spectracide, Cutter,
Repel, Hot Shot and Black Flag.


In December 2007, Harbinger Capital merged its ownership position in Applica
Incorporated with Salton, Inc. (pink sheets: SFPI) and changed its name to Russell Hobbs.
Harbinger controlled around 92% of the combined company after the reverse merger. In
June 2010, Spectrum Brands and Russell Hobbs merged. Prior to the deal, Harbinger
Capital owned 41% of Spectrum Brands and effectively all of Russell Hobbs. In the fall of
2010, HRG agreed to acquire 27.8 million shares of SPB from Harbinger Capital (again
HRG's CEO is also the Portfolio Manager of the hedge fund from which it was buying
HRG shares - not exactly arms length from our perspective). The transaction was
consummated at what appeared to be a small discount to SPB's market price, when
considering most transactions of that size would require a steep liquidity discount given
the inability to sell that quantity of stock in the open market without price impairment.
Nonetheless, we believe the transaction may have been used by Harbinger Capital to fund

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 4/18


well publicized redemptions (a possible recurring theme). HRG funded the purchase from
its CEO's hedge fund with $350 million of senior notes carrying a 10.625% coupon and
120 million shares of HRG stock. This transaction closed in January 2011. In October
2012, SPB announced the acquisition of Stanley Black & Decker's (NYSE:SWK)
Hardware & Home Improvement Business for $1.4 billion, with plans to fund the entire
amount with debt. While the acquisition is accretive to SPB's earnings, the leverage of the
combined entity will approach 5x EBITDA. We believe this amount of leverage adds
significant risks to SPB, and by extension HRG. Today, HRG consolidates SPB's results
on its financial statements, and reports a minority interest line items on its income
statement and balance sheet. As we will show below, the holding company argument for
valuing HRG has some major holes in it.


HRG's Sum-of-Parts Ropes in Investors


HRG provides a sum-of-parts slide in the investor presentation on its website. The
diagram below is taken directly from management's presentation (slide 8) that depicts an
"estimated value" of $10.07 per share.


We believe this disclosure is highly misleading and one of the primary drivers for the
misplaced investor enthusiasm in the shares. For example, a recent Seeking Alpha article
written by what appears to be a well-intentioned retail investor lays out a very similar sum-
of-the-parts analysis (with $10.04 per share value). Another Seeking Alpha article
published on August 31, 2012, included a similar implied range for Spectrum Brands and
the indexed annuity business. That article helped drive HRG shares up 9% the day after it
was published. Another HRG shareholder recently promoted his firm's investment in HRG
during a Barron's interview, expressing the view that the net asset value of the company
was $11.23. We think these arguments are dangerous and incorrect as discussed below.

5/22/2018 Harbinger Group's Sum-of-Parts Does Not Add Up - HRG Group, Inc. (NYSE:HRG) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 5/18


We believe the sum-of-parts presentation HRG's management has been using includes a
few very aggressive assumptions that may have confused unassuming investors. For
example, according to the small print footnotes in the presentation, the $10.07 per share
value is based on 139.4 million shares outstanding. However, HRG has $400 million of
convertible preferreds outstanding with an average conversion price of $6.64. Any
economic analysis would adjust management's sum-of-parts above with shares issuable
under the convert (and of course also take out face value of the preferreds from debt).
This intellectually honest and economically accurate adjustment reduces the company's
valuation by $1.14, or over 11%.


Yet the most aggressive assumption included in the sum-of-parts valuation is the nearly
$900 million valuation for Fidelity & Guaranty Life ("FG&L') at "net book value." We will
highlight why we believe this is an absurd valuation. FG&L is an indexed annuity
provider that Harbinger acquired from Old Mutual in April 2011 for $350 million. According
to management's presentation, this business has more than doubled in valuation during
the last 18 months since the deal closed. To demonstrate how unlikely this assumption
appears, the share price of FG&L's direct publicly traded competitor, American Equity Life
(NYSE:AEL), has actually DECLINED over that same time frame (while the S&P 500
(NYSEARCA:SPY) is up over 20%). AEL is down for a good reason, one which should
also be depressing HRG's FG&L: the index annuity business faces significant regulatory
and business risk due to the low interest rate environment. The issues that enabled
Harbinger to get a "deal" on FG&L at a large discount to book value are not only still
present, they have intensified. These issues are apparent in the valuation (and stock
performance) of AEL.


AEL is the leader in the indexed annuity industry. Compared to FG&L, AEL appears to be
more attractive on nearly every metric: market share, profitability, track record, return
on equity and financial strength and credit ratings from S&P, Moody's and A.M. Best (see
Table below for side-by-side compare). Despite relatively consistent results, AEL trades at
a measly 39% of GAAP book value, 67% of book value excluding Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"), and 42% of statutory capital.


AEL's management insists investors ignore AOCI (which makes up 41% of AEL's book
value and 33% of FG&L's) and focus on book value excluding AOCI. Management of AEL
has guided investors towards this approach DESPITE making the stock appear more
expensive when utilizing this metric. In AEL's earnings releases, management goes so far
as to calculate "total capitalization, total stockholders' equity and book value per share
excluding AOCI" stating that "since AOCI fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 6/18


unrealized changes in the fair value of available for sale investments, we believe these
non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information." In fact, in its
earnings release, it ONLY provides book value on this basis (excluding AOCI). AOCI has
increased substantially for spread based insurance companies as falling interest rates
increase unrealized gains in investment portfolios. With long duration assets and liabilities
of a spread business, there is little opportunity to realize these gains, so they are typically
viewed by investors as temporary. HRG's FG&L is experiencing the EXACT same
headwinds in its spread business!


Low interest rates make the indexed annuity businesses highly unattractive and are one of
the main reasons they trade at large discounts today. Indexed annuity companies used to
generate wide spreads by investing most of their investment portfolios in mortgages or
mortgage securities insured by the US government. These carried little or no credit risk.
With mortgage rates so low, indexed annuity providers have had to shift to much riskier
investments to generate a spread and have limited ability to reduce crediting rates on the
products (or demand will disappear). Today, indexed annuity companies are matching
potentially very long dated liabilities with low yielding, but potentially risky investments. We
believe investors are concerned that if and when rates rise, the reversal of AOCI and
unrealized investment losses could result in realized losses for the non-surrender
protection portion of their liabilities, potentially causing a "run of the bank."


The rate environment is not the only reason indexed annuity providers trade at massive
discounts. There continues to be significant regulatory risk in this business. Indexed
annuities are a product group that is typically aggressively sold with extremely high
commissions for agents. A strong majority of indexed annuities are sold through lightly
regulated independent agents. The main issues consumer advocates have with the
product revolve around suitability issues and very high costs related to commission and
gimmicks. The typical buyer of indexed annuity products is retirement age and indexed
annuities can carry very large surrender charges that lock up funds for up to 15 years.
Some industry observers speculate that surrender fees drive a large piece of the
economics for indexed annuity providers. Given the myriad of concerns, multiple
regulators, including the SEC, have considered regulating indexed annuities as
investment securities rather than insurance. If this would happen, only registered
investment advisors would be able to sell the product (unregistered agents make up a
strong majority of indexed annuity sales today). Our research suggests that registered
reps despise indexed annuities given the suitability and surrender fee profile of the
product. As a result, if indexed annuities were regulated as investment securities, sales

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 7/18


would likely dry up. For a more detailed view on the negative aspects of indexed annuity
industry, we suggest reading the Reuters article "Don't Buy Indexed Annuities," where the
author states there "are at least three scandalous aspects to the index annuity racket."


If management, and the misinformed bulls on HRG, valued FG&L more inline with its
closest comp (accounting for the myriad of issues), then the bullish valuation argument
would evaporate. Applying AEL's valuation metrics to FG&L, we arrive at roughly a $350
million valuation (see table below), which is the same price HRG paid in April 2011. Over
this same time period, AEL's stock price has actually declined. Thus we could argue that
this flat valuation is overly generous given FG&L metrics are inferior to AEL. What is
perhaps most ironic about the bullish argument is that an investor can recreate the HRG
assets by directly buying AEL shares and shares of Spectrum Brands (80% of company's
valuation tied to Spectrum and F&G Holdings) without the liquidity or shareholder risk that
accompany HRG shares. Any HRG investor would have a hard time justifying the liquidity
premium they are paying to own HRG versus a proxy for the nearly identical assets.

What is Left at the Harbinger Hedge Funds?


It is difficult to find reliable information on the current status of Harbinger Funds. Aside
from hedge fund media reports, the best source of information appears to be the
company's 13F filings with the SEC. However, Harbinger's 13F is difficult to evaluate at
first glance since HRG's positions are also included in the filing. After reorganizing the
positions by their entity, we believe it is clear that HRG may be the only listed equity at the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 8/18


two embattled hedge funds (see table below). The 13F seems to support the view that all
other publicly traded equities at the hedge funds were liquidated earlier in 2012. We
believe this would be a surprise to most HRG shareholders investors and may foreshadow
a problem for HRG stock holders. If Harbinger funds need liquidity to meet redemptions or
lawsuit claims, HRG shares may be one of the only sources for liquidity. If Harbinger or
Falcone is convicted of SEC charges, or if Falcone is barred from the securities industry
as part of a settlement or conviction, we have trouble conceiving a scenario where
Harbinger Capital is not shut down, likely resulting in the sale or distribution of its entire
HRG position.


Given the limited liquidity of HRG trading volume, a small float and very little institutional
sponsorship, we believe a share sale or distribution by Harbinger could crush the stock.
As a reference, if we assumed Harbinger was able to utilize 50% of the three-month
average daily volume of 109,000 shares to sell its shares, it would take Harbinger nine-
and-a-half years (based on 250 trading days per year) to liquidate its HRG position. While
this is probably an unrealistic scenario, we believe shares would need to trade at a
massive liquidity discount relative to current prices to attract volume buyers.


source: 13F.


After Falcone received a Wells notice from the SEC in December 2011 informing him of
their plan to bring an enforcement action, the New York Times' DealBook declared that
starting December 30th, "Harbinger will bar investors from withdrawing money from four of
its funds." If in fact Harbinger Capital investors are still gated, it could have terrible
consequences for HRG shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 9/18


Earlier in 2012, HRG filed a shelf for the registration of primary and 25 million secondary
shares owned by Harbinger Capital's hedge funds. This may be an ominous sign for HRG
investors, as it could allow Falcone to sell HRG shares to raise cash, or allow him to
distribute registered HRG shares directly to Harbinger Capital's limited partners to fulfill
redemption requests. There is precedent for this type of redemption from Harbinger
Capital. According to Absolute Return, in June 2011 Harbinger paid redemption requests
with "in-kind payments of the firm's illiquid holding in broadband wireless company
LightSquared." According to the investor letter, Falcone stated that, "while we have had
opportunities to monetize a portion of our LightSquared position in recent months, I feel
strongly that any sale by our funds of an interest in LightSquared would have been
premature and would not only have jeopardized the ability to join forces with a strategic
partner, but also would have limited the substantial upside that I am convinced will come
to all of our investors as our plan is executed." Less than a year later, LightSquared filed
for bankruptcy.


source: company filings.


The LightSquared bankruptcy could provide further pain for Harbinger Capital, and by
extension, HRG shares. According to the Wall Street Journal, LightSquared's lenders are
attempting to recover over $260 million from Harbinger Capital for a 2011 "loan" to
LightSquared that they believe was actually an "equity infusion." If the courts ruled in the
creditors' favor, Harbinger Capital would likely need to generate liquidity, and our analysis
suggests a large sale or distribution of HRG shares may be one of the only options.


Harbinger appears to be taking desperate actions to get liquidity for the remaining
investments at the hedge fund. Falcone attempted to launch an HRG look alike with a
blank check SPAC called Australia Acquisition Corp (ticker AACP). Under the proposed
transaction, Harbinger Capital planned to contribute three investments that it claimed were
worth $350 million in exchange for 83% to 96% ownership stake in AACP. Falcone
planned to rename the company Harbinger Global Corp. The illiquid investments (thus not
included in its 13F filing) included a casino development project in Vietnam and a minority
interest in an iron ore producer in Brazil. It appeared to us that Falcone was again
attempting to liquidate otherwise illiquid assets through a controlled vehicle. As of early

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1020391-harbinger-groups-sum-of-parts-does-not-add-up 10/18


November 2012, the transaction was delayed due to an extended review by the SEC.
Then, on November 16, 2012, Australian Acquisition and Harbinger Capital announced
the abrupt termination of the transaction, citing "time constraints and additional funding
requirements, as well as other considerations, make attempting to proceed with the
proposed transaction no longer, at this time, in the best interests of AAC and its
shareholders, or HCP and its various funds' investors." With limited ability to turn these
three Harbinger Capital investments into a liquid investment in the short term, it may
expedite the need for Harbinger Capital to seek liquidly in HRG shares.


Harbinger Capital May Not Be Only Seller


On January 31, 2012, Harbinger Capital and Phil Falcone took out a $190 million loan
from Jefferies (JEF) at a highly distressed effective interest rate of 24%. On June 14th,
2012, it paid off the balance of the loan with a new credit agreement with MSD Capital, the
money-management arm of Michael Dell. Under the agreement, MSD can swap $50
million of the loan extended to Harbinger Capital for HRG shares at $6.50 per share
before June 2013, or $7 per share after that date. Today, MSD can convert its loan in
exchange for 7.7 million HRG shares. These loans provide additional questions and
concerns about Harbinger. For example, it remains unclear if the loan is to the fund or to
Harbinger Capital… and if it is to the Company, why can a possible loan to a hedge fund
company be paid off with investments from a fund (which presumably are partially owned
by outside limited partners). If MSD believes it can liquidate HRG shares for more than
$6.50 per share, it would seem to make sense for MSD to convert its shares, especially
before Harbinger Capital distributes or sells shares.


What is HRG worth?


Adjusting management's sum-of-parts analysis for the convertible preferred stock (so
roughly 202 million shares out with a subsequent reduction in debt), a tax effected stock
price of SPB (which brings the value below $5.50 per share at recent prices), and a more
reasonable valuation of the indexed annuity business of $1.75 per share (the same $350
million that was paid prior to the industry risks accelerating and the closest comp declining
20%), and roughly $0.50 per share of remaining debt net of cash and other investments,
we arrive at a fundamental value of less than $6.75 per share. This equates to over 23%
downside from current levels. Our analysis is not impacted by HRG's recent
announcement to acquire natural gas fields from Exco Resources (NYSE:XCO) (as it
replaces cash with this investment at market value). If we apply a reasonable and prudent
liquidity and risk discount of 20% associated with: HRG's ownership structure,

concentrated ownership by a hedge fund that has been charged with fraud, and material
future risk of significant share sales/distributions, we arrive at a $5.35 price target, or 39%
downside.


Disclosure: I am short HRG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

market by publishing such garbage. as an analyst I would rebutt but you are so off base that i don't know where to
start. tell your mother to stop shorting things she doesn't understand and get your ideas elsewhwere.

You have to be crazy.. Keep shorting all the way to 15 PPS. There are those who feel that SPB is wayyyyy under
valued and is more at 88 PPS ( See writings and holdings of such knowledge funds like GOODX). If that is the case
where does it place the assets of HRG then.?? I am one of those who feel that HRG would be better off with Falcone
out of the way, so bring it on. You are all wet and in the vernacular " full of shit". Good shorting, and by the way, HRG
is very tinnily traded and impossible to cover. Why would you ever short this thing when there are other weaker
equities out there to short ? You gotta be on crack.. LOL.

Author’s reply »  Oilmannn, "those who feel" that spb is under valued are better off owning SPB than HRG, in my
view. I don't have a strong view on SPB other than it is a low multiple, low growth roll-up that will be riskier with $3.2
billion of debt. I may be "crazy" or "on crack," but I have a hard time reconciling your comments of getting Falcone
"out of the way" and the thin trading volume. If Falcone is out of HRG then Harbinger Capital is most likely not viable,

which means they would likely distribute or sell their 129 million or so shares, which would likely crush the stock. Best

The battery business is declining (according to Energizer cc at least) and its 2/3rds of their (SPBs) profit base.
Debt load will limit advertising the way I see it and their Europe leadership position does not seem like a good
place to be in.


I see a way out but not sure it will happen. It is possible for them to sell the Pet Food business for a good
price to reduce leverage not sure if it will happen. Capital structure straight out is not good rate wise and if
they bought back the high yeild debt instead of the business it would have been a better more certain payoff.


My gut feeling they will destabilize as the battery market contracts as it has been. The company is still in
euphoria mode due to earnings boosts from all those acquisitions. Issuing debt after filing 10-k does seem to
have been on purpose to make it look better. 
They have some good assets but right now it is just a bloating company that is not preparing its' businesses
to be flexible as change happens.


Lastly, the Euro exposure via operating businesses cuts both ways. If the euro declines leverage flies up.  
Just go to page 93 on the 10k and smell the roses.

If it's a SPB valuation argument that scares someone from shorting HRG, then one could simply go long SPB while
shorting HRG (appropriately ratio applied).


Anyway, this analysis seems very solid. Good luck with your trade.


Analytics, either put up or shut up.

That would be inverse arbitrage, since HRG's SPB stake is currently worth $1.4B and its entire market cap is
$1.2B.


I'm not conviced by this fearmongering article that all their other assets, even including Falcone, have
negative value.


04 Dec 2012, 03:23 PM


Shareholder Watchdog, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Illuminati, I estimate an enterprise value of HRB of just under $2.2 billion ignoring SPB's
consolidated debt and adjusting for expo. Fully diluted market cap alone is north of $1.7B. good luck.

Could you please clarify this comment? Do you mean that since enterprise value exceeds fully diluted market
cap that anyone looking to buy all of HRG would have to pay more than their assets are currently worth?


05 Dec 2012, 01:27 PM


Shareholder Watchdog, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Not quite. I do argue that it is overvalued (so view of value of assets v. enterprise value). It is
best to compare the value of their assets to enterprise value, not market cap. this accounts for the debt they
used to acquire their assets (and must be paid off). I do not believe this is controversial point.

Haaa.. What do you do for a living during the day, whatever don't leave your day job. Maybe the Falcones will hire a
security analysis to run the fund, Falcone just can not be involved from a day to day standpoint. When the deal with
SWK was announced SPB was up 30% and it held, regardless of the added debt. Many are saying that the SWK deal
will add another 2.00 gross and 1.00 net to the FCF to SPB bottom line. That would give 5.50 now + 2.00 or 7.50 FCF.
If you follow the teachings of Buffet and Graham that is a 10XFCF which gives SPB at 75PPS paying 3% div. What I
am saying to you is that there are so many good shorts out there way would anyone who knows what they are dong
short a thinly traded stock like HRG. Short VMW or Cat not HRG. Hope it is only a few shares that you are short. I
presently hold 60K HRG and 100K SPB ( bought at this time last year @ 24 PPS) and never selling either one. But
your article was well written..


JMHO..

Cremsonbey!


They (SPB) are putting up a new factory for the battery business and with the (now) $7.00 PS of FCF after the
Stanley buyout they will be paying down the debt and increasing the dividend payout over the 2013 year. They have
already announced this But remember this is HRG board comments. SPB is now 45 and HRG is now 8.00: a simple
and easy way to buy SPB. An article came out yesterday that they are pegging SPB @ 58 PS when they reaffirm in
February 2013; 3 months from now. Load up or miss the train. ( Disclosure-I own a big position in SPB and HRG )
Good luck my friend.

They are Europe sales leader, europe is weak, batteries are in a shrinking market. Energizer got rid of two
factories to increase efficiency in rest factories ergo higher utilization.


SPB has about 3+ billion in debt at fairly high rates any fluctuations in the EUR/USD rate that go down hurt
them so their leverage would go up if the EUR goes down.


All of these acquisitions they did are attempts to boost up the earning capacity of the company AT ANY
COST! which is never a good sign for sustainability. Home products will have weakness since households are
experiencing tremendous pains those grills and other things they sell that are fairly elastic demand wise are
hurting.


Two things that can happen they sell parts of the company or the whole thing.


Imagine if SPB is distributed to HRG holders? I am sure some would hold it others wouldn't it would create a
lot of pressure. Right now the supply is curtailed in this one aspect but it may not continue to be the case.

and it was an off day.. Have a good weekend..

that's funny. people who boast about making $100k on an 'off day' are definite liars.

While I disagreed with you when HRG was trading below just the value of their stake in SPB, you did bring up enough
good points to convince me to sell today at 10.50 now that the arbitrage opportunity is mostly gone.

be happy that you did


13 Dec 2012, 10:58 AM

Yeah, nice timing. Kudos to the author for warning me. This latest machination makes no sense so I think I'll
be avoiding the stock even though the arbitrage situation is back.

your analysis is right on. All his assets are junk and Falcone is pulling every liquid piece together to dump if needed

I believe in Falcone one must remember with extreme fortune comes some misfortune and many successful business
people even smart Hedge Fund Managers from Harvard forget where they made their fortunes and for a moment may
get away from what they know. The problem is when a companies business model changes there exist a moment of
being lost and in unfamiliar territory- this could be disastrous. For example Harbingers investments into LightSquared
in which Falcone gets a fast track thumbs up to spend billions to build a 4G network and then denied licensing by the
same agency is nothing short of a conspiracy. It’s obvious that these government /public servants are corrupt,
unethical, and intentionally put the screws to Falcone and Harbinger. Harbinger stands to lose $4BB with light
squared and they are doing everything within the realm of the law to protect their client’s interests. I believe in a man
who makes it home to his family for dinner every night while dealing with unscrupulous public servants, FCC, and
SEC.

Why do you net out the convert without netting out the accompanying balance sheet liability?


Leaving that mistake aside, it seems to me that you could have written a much, much shorter article that got at your
main points more clearly. As I read you: 
- FGL is worth ~0.7x book less AOCI, not 1x book 
- HRG needs ~25% minority/liquidity discount 
- HRG+SPB are highly levered and risky


Let's do a back-of-the-envelope: 
- SPB at $49.50 is worth $10 per HRG share 
- FGL 0.7x book-aoci, +16% like AEL from 9/30, $5 
- HGIF, say 0.5x book, $1 
- cash & short term, $3 
- debt & liabilities, including FV conversion feature, -$8


Ignore the gas deal as netting to $0 and net NAV seems to be roughly $11. Discounting around 25% for majority
control and liquidity gives you around $8.


Perhaps coincidentally, that is roughly the market price.

Author’s reply »  I did take out the face value of the convert from the liabilities: "convertible preferred stock (so
roughly 202 million shares out with a subsequent reduction in debt)" 
I didn't look at your full analysis because I didn't get past the first part. .7x book-aoci / 202 mm shares = $2.65 per
share, not $5. 
also, HGIF is deploying funds from the life insurance co I believe (and no outside money). So believe you are double
counting the value (your $1). It is like AEL giving its investment department a name and trying to prescribe value do it.
worth a shot if investors fall for it.


24 Jan 2013, 06:50 PM


WC Whiner
I used current shares outstanding and added AEL's market price change since September, and rounded. Call it $4 if
you like. 
HGIF invests holding company capital, not insurance float.


To rough out conversion, add back the face value of the convert, the liability booked for fair value of the conversion
feature, and the cash received from conversion. Top of my head it looks like $4.5 on the new share count, versus the
$2 you seem to be adding.


Did I miss something?


25 Jan 2013, 12:10 AM


WC Whiner
Bah, no cash. But yes fair value of the conversion feature. $3.3, maybe.


25 Jan 2013, 09:29 AM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Not sure if anyone is still monitoring this situation, but I couldn't resist the value and bought back in at 8 and 8.5.
Considering that HRG has been buying more SPB shares lately and now owns a 59% stake that is worth $1.9B, or
over 50% higher than their total market cap, I just don't see how the rest of the company could have negative value.

Watchdog - great analysis, thank you. 
I was licensed to sell insurance and annuities for F&G when they were part of OMNI. gotta tell you, commission is
great - about 90 percent of first year premiums. Forgot the cut for annuities.  
Anyways, F&G sells "return of premium" rider for its term policies which would require them to reimburse 100% paid
premium after the policy expires if the insured didn't die. That's an easy sell cause people don't like wasting money on
insurance. So I am thinking how much money they will have to shell out X years from now ??? 
Also, with F&G is going public very soon, Looks like Harbinger wants to cash out on bad valuations ?

Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Are you saying this is a bad business model that looks good short term but accrues long term liabilities? What
about getting to use the float of these premiums to generate income now before maybe having to return it in
future depreciated dollars?


Also, they're selling such a small slice of FGL in the IPO that I don't think it's necessarily a ploy to jettison a
bad business, but rather to put an actual market valuation on it since people like this author don't trust the
internal valuation they put on it and thus they don't get enough credit for it.

Well ..... Return of premium (ROP) policies are nothing more then zero-interest mid- to long- term loans (10 to
30 years) from the customers that are masked as revenues. Are these loans posted on the LT liabilities
ledger?.... Are there projections made how much is due each year on expiring ROPs?...

Turned out FnG isnt selling term policies any longer, only the universal life and annuites

Now that FGL is publically traded, would you still say its $1.1B market cap is an "absurd valuation"?

Appreciate the response, hope you didn't take my comment as an "I told you so" victory lap since a lot of

I was just curious if you've changed your mind at all regarding HRG now that some of their components like
SPB and FGL have increased in value, as well as the fact they've found some smart ways to handle the

might make a run at the whole company if it stays this undervalued.
