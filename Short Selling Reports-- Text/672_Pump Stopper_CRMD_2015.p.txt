CorMedix: Strong Sell On Partner Failure, Misleading Data And Paid
Stock Promotion, -91% Downside
Jun. 29, 2015 10:56 AM ET197 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


CorMedix's 1970s-era chemical acquired for <$1m cash from bankruptcy after 2+
failed sale attempts. Bankruptcy documents show Fresenius passed on CRMD even
at <$2m value while Gambro deemed Taurolidine worthless.


German corporate records show Tauropharm is ~$1.3-2.5m failure, indicating CRMD
market claims are inaccurate. German court transcripts show CRMD patent based
on "outdated" prior art view, so CRMD patent worthless.


The company uses misleading clinical data as in-depth industry research shows
Neutrolin/Taurolidine is a failure while "40% benefit!" versus industry standards is
inaccurate. CRMD now spends more on insider compensation


CRMD's failed shell financially engineered by biotech wipeout artist Rosenwald,
associated with fraud allegations and disasters; the company also partnered with
John Carris who was expelled by FINRA for fraud


Despite 8+ years of "imminent" Phase3 trials and strategic partner claims, with paid
stock promotion and failed company sale process, CRMD stock has temporarily
pumped to an unsustainable 224m+ valuation.


I believe CorMedix (NYSEMKT:CRMD) is one of the most brazen, worthless biotech shells
of insider enrichment I have ever seen. Bankruptcy documents show CRMD is based on a
1970s-era catheter product acquired for <$1m cash the last time this company went
bankrupt under the "Biolink" name, apparently after at least two failed sales processes.
Global catheter companies apparently passed on CRMD when given the option to
purchase the company for almost nothing out of bankruptcy while Gambro evaluated the
product and abandoned it.


After failing on all other prospects (given abandonment of these other compounds), CRMD
was left with Neutrolin. Then, with just 5 full-time employees and this antiqueted product
derived from Taurine (yes, the antioxidant in RedBull), the company was financially re-

engineered into a public shell by famous biotech wipeout-artist Lindsay Rosenwald while
also partnering with John Carris, who was expelled by FINRA for fraud charges involving
an illegitimate tattoo and gun shopping spree with stock manipulation.

German corporate records show Tauropharm (selling a product identical to CRMD's for 15
years) is at best a $3-4m per year business that is not growing and marginally profitable,
indicating CRMD's market size claims are wildly inaccurate. Why does CRMD
management seem to me to pretend Tauropharm financial data is not available when
asked on CRMD investor calls?


Furthermore, direct German court transcripts indicate German injunction courts believe
CRMD's patent appears to have been mistakenly granted based on outdated "prior art"
concepts now viewed as doubtful, making its patent "not valid." While this lawsuit will likely
drag on for years before CRMD loses, these direct German court transcripts seem to me
contradictory to the message given by CorMedix, and in my view, make future CRMD
patent failure inevitable.


Now, CRMD seems to have "pulled out all the stops" with paid stock promotion and
endlessly touting misleading clinical data along with a (NOW) failed company strategic
review process retail shareholders mistakenly believe will result in company sale. As a
result, CRMD stock has become temporarily pumped to an unsustainable $224m+
valuation as it has "seized the moment" to dump millions of dollars in stock while
apparently specifically targeting the most unsophisticated retail shareholders possible.


Using the most optimistic Neutrolin estimates possible AND assuming CRMD
management is honest, its fair value is a maximum of $0.44 per share for -91.04% near-
term downside, with most of that value made up from the cash the company just raised,
which insiders will likely burn and pay out as excessive compensation. I expect, as CRMD
burns through its cash, it will go bankrupt (again). Insider and company stock sales further
support this view.

With CRMD stock imploding as this failure continues to unravel, I think it is an opportune
time to review what happened and how this was an easily preventable financial disaster
for so many retail share (bag) holders. CRMD is a stock I have been involved with for a
while now, and my hope is to use this report as an "Op Ed" template to help explain to
retail shareholders how to avoid getting bagged in the future in worthless biotech shells of
insider enrichment. For many shareholders, it is already too late to avoid capital losses in
CRMD, but you can cut your losses short and learn from your mistakes by reading the rest
of this report.


As a result, this report is unusually long. I encourage you to pour a tall glass of gin and
focus though, as what you read will shock you.


CRMD History: Failed Company Sale Attempts, Bankruptcy And Repeated Wrong
Press Releases


In order to truly understand what is going on behind the scenes at CRMD, historical
context is critical, and I highly recommend you at least read this article for interesting
background. CRMD's sole product Neutrolin is a simple mix of old compounds which the
company claims can be injected into a catheter to try and treat infections in a procedure
known as "Catheter Lock." Catheter Lock protocol is where a dialysis catheter is closed on
each end and filled with an intense cleaning solution to address infection risk. The only
chemical CRMD has any unique claim to is a compound called Taurolidine, which is a
Taurine amino acid derivative originally discovered and experimented with back in the
1970s, which, similar to aspartame, seems to metabolize into formaldehyde. After
apparently failing on all its other prospects, CRMD was left primarily with this
Neutrolin/Taurolidine product.


CRMD was originally known as BioLink (CRMD's predecessor company name), supported
by Spinnaker Capital LLC, and truly began back in 2001 when the first IDE (#G0102000)
for Neutrolin was filed and approved with the FDA. At that time, Fresenius put up $1.5m to
help fund Neutrolin, and Fresenius had the option to buy CRMD/Neutrolin for U.S. and
Canada for $80m, an option which was never exercised.


However, all that apparently failed swiftly as CRMD, then known as Biolink, went bankrupt
in 2003. Prior to formally filing bankruptcy, it is typical for a company to try and sell itself in
order to avoid seeing the business cease to exist. We can deduce presumably this first
sale process failed and that likely CRMD was put up for sale to not only Fresenius but also
Fresenius's competitors in order to try and force Fresenius's hand and avoid getting wiped
out. Tellingly, no buyers of any kind stepped in to avert bankruptcy.

Once in bankruptcy, CRMD was put up to auction. Remember Fresenius already had
involvement with CRMD and knew it well. Pharma/Biotech is an intensely competitive and
public space, so I would be shocked if other global dialysis companies competing with
Fresenius weren't aware of CRMD's bankruptcy auction as well.


Question: If the CRMD asset had any value, why wouldn't a competitor try to steal it away
from Fresenius out of bankruptcy? Why wouldn't Fresenius buy it? The questions answer
themselves, in my view.


In the end, the only one willing to own CRMD/Neutrolin was an affiliate of current investors
that were still owed $941k from CRMD: Spinnaker Capital. It was allowed to "credit bid" its
$941k debt and put up ~$1m in cash to own CRMD outright. In these same bankruptcy
documents, we learn Fresenius bid as well but was not the winning bid, indicating
Fresenius put in a bid lower than Spinnaker Capital's $1-1.9m bid. When the only people
interested in owning your failed and bankrupt company are the current investors throwing
good money after bad, that seems like an obvious failure.


I believe the catheter industry has spoken and the verdict is clear: CRMD is worth, at
most, $1.9m, which is ~$0.06 per share.


The failed company seems to have languished dormant for years until 2008 when
Spinnaker Capital have formed "ND Partners LLC," apparently run out of an apartment in
Boston.

It then took ND Partners and joined forces with notorious biotech wipeout master Lindsay
Rosenwald to "re-boot" this failed company into a public company shell. ND Partners
received $325k and some stock and Rosenwald took a huge piece of the company
through a brutal convertible debt offering.


Even back in 2008, CRMD was touting it would enter its pivotal trial "soon" and with a
product on the market in 2011 or sooner. In line with CRMD's years of failure though,
apparently no credible private healthcare investors would fund this thing, and the latest
investors also presumably couldn't sell the company outright for a profit, so no trials ever
happened. Instead, CRMD decided the best way to get money would be to raise it in
America's public markets with a largely retail shareholder base. The shareholder base
remains largely confused and uninformed retail investors who I believe are falling victim to
this mess.


Who will financially "prime the process" on this worthless failure? Who will step into
promote this worthless shell where insiders get rich? How will insiders salvage their
broken investment no one else wanted to buy out of bankruptcy court? Read on!


So with Rosenwald's help as escrow agent and financial partner, CRMD went to the public
markets in 2011 with the story now that its pivotal study would start in 2011 and Neutrolin
would be on the market in 2013 while the company would file its IND with the FDA (sound
familiar?). This hopeless team somehow managed to raise $12.5m on the back of this

story and the claim its imminent Phase3 trial would cost just $10m, which it claimed it had
cash for. The company also claimed European revenues would be coming in 2011 time
frame. None of this seems to have happened and CRMD kept the money.


CRMD's Lindsay Rosenwald: Involved In Multiple Fraud Lawsuits, Master Of
Biotech Wipeout


Lindsay Rosenwald: Biotech Wipeout Artist - pic credit Rosenwald


You can read on your own all about Lindsay who I think is perhaps the most impressive
Master of Biotech Wipeout in the entire stock market. Basic Google research will help you
find interesting background about Rosenwald and his ties to DH Blair, indicted on 173
counts and described as "massive scheme of securities fraud," or the apparent jail time
and probation of associates with securities issues, or just the uncanny "pattern" of
basically everything he touches to get wiped out, over and over again. You may also find it
interesting to read up on the multiple biotech disasters he has been involved in that
"coincidentally" get sued for fraud, like Interneuron or Ventrus (where Elliot got wiped out
too).


The Rosenwald Pattern, as it is known in the biotech investment community, seems pretty
simple and recurring to me. Take a financially unviable, apparently failed compound
acquired for nearly free, which may be selling minimal amounts in some foreign market (or
not), then promote it, typically with lots of unsophisticated retail investors, then collect

In 2012, CRMD was facing bankruptcy again with the stock decaying near $0.14 per share
and its total valuation of ~$25m. Again, where are the real healthcare investors? Where
are the legitimate healthcare companies who have known about Taurolidine/Neutrolin
since the 1970s?

Instead of choosing to work with anyone credible, CRMD partnered with "John Carris
Investments." John Carris was charged with fraud by FINRA and later expelled from the
investment industry. John Carris CEO George Carris allegedly issued false documents,
when in fact $600k was spent by CEO George Carris on a massive shopping spree of
guns, motorcycle gear and tattoos. Among many issues, FINRA also alleged Carris
fraudulently sold stock and manipulated stock through strange pre-arranged trading and
block orders.


What kind of company chooses to partner with people like this?


CRMD's 10+ Year Graveyard Of Broken Promises


This is not the first time CRMD has announced partnership discussions and imminent
Phase3 trials, as it seems to me CRMD has 8-10+ straight years of breaking its own
promises. I don't have enough time to go through all of CRMD's moved goalposts and
broken promises as that would likely take months or years, but to look at a few
"interesting" recent examples, we can note CRMD has been touting "discussions
underway with global pharmaceutical and medical device companies" for the last 18
months straight. When CRMD again raised money in 2013, it stated:


"we expect that our cash position is sufficient to reach profitability…we would be
able to be at an operating break-even run rate by the end of 2014… we certainly
have the flexibility to get to where we want to be without having to raise any
additional capital"

At the time, CRMD was guiding investors to a strong European launch given its years of
effort and strong marketing push there, but of course all of this turned out to be wrong.
CRMD also has been stating since at least 2013 it planned to partner in the U.S. If nobody
will partner with CRMD who will possibly want to own this previously bankrupt failure?


CRMD has been guiding to imminent Phase3 trial with near-term market launch since
2008 also. The company rehashed this tired promise again in 2010 and is still using this
tired story in 2013 until today. In 2014, CRMD stated:


"want a Phase III program before the end of the year… be ready to launch in the
U.S. either later 2016 or early 2017"


Yet again though the goal posts are moved and presumably after partnership discussion
failure, CRMD drops the early 2014 bomb of:


"we may decide to establish our own commercial organization in the United
States….We have ongoing discussions with a number of companies….we think that
the negotiations with some of these companies will accelerate"


Or how about telling investors on the Q2 2014 call:


"Starting the trial in or before the first quarter 2015….the level of interest increased I
would say maybe dramatically….We're talking to companies that both on the pharma
side and the device side."


Or the tired story from just 6 months ago of CRMD having enough cash:


"we believe that our cash resources as of December 31, 2014 will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of
2015"


And just on the Q1 2015 call:


"John Marcel - XG Capital: A follow up question. Do you expect to register more
shares in the coming six months?Randy Milby - CEO At this point, no"

Which we know is wrong given CRMD is siphoning millions of dollars of cash out of retail
shareholders accounts via its ATM. From what I can tell, it seems CRMD has basically
done nothing but tell stories, break investor promises, and raise tens of millions of dollars
largely from retail investors. How can you possibly trust anything these people say?


Just Stop Already CRMD


Picture credit me


We know multiple global catheter companies have shown no interest in Neutrolin despite
established relationships. We know CRMD has repeatedly partnered with people sued for
fraud, and we know CRMD seems to endlessly postpone ever actually running its study to
get Neutrolin on the market, even when the company has plenty of cash. If CRMD and
Neutrolin were really an amazing opportunity, how can all of these things possibly be true?
Why has CRMD been postponing the study endlessly for 7 years (for now, next year it will
probably be 8 years!)? Why can't CRMD find any credible partners? Why won't it just hire
a dang CRO and get this study done? How could this many broken promises and failures
possibly be a coincidence?


We know if CRMD's Taurolidine/Neutrolin truly had gazillion dollar market potential, then
catheter giant Gambro would never have dropped it as it did with Geistlich manufactured
"Taurosept" (2% Taurolidine blend) in Europe a few years back and instead offers coated
catheters now. Fresenius had a partnership with CRMD as far back as 2003 and could
have purchased the company outright for <$2m but chose not to. Tauropharm has been
selling a product identical to Neutrolin in Europe since at least 2003 and yet Tauropharm
has never been acquired by a big dialysis company and flounders along as a tiny failure?
Doctors have been experimenting with Taurolidine flushes for at least ~15 years and yet it
has never caught on, why?


Obviously, Gambro, Fresenius and these global dialysis companies know more about
catheter issues and CRBIs than CRMD ever will (or you or me). So why have global
dialysis companies deemed CRMD's product worthless? How is this possible when CRMD
management told you it's worth gazillion dollars?!? Let me explain…

Why CRMD's Product Is Financially Unviable And Worthless


Unfortunately, most retail investors don't have the resources, tools and experience to
properly evaluate most biotech/pharma companies and instead rely on message board
touts (who in my view are likely dumping their stock given CRMD's stock price implosion)
along with company management, which as we see above has been disastrous. As you
see what the research actually shows, I think you will begin to comprehend what CRMD's
true purpose is and what is going on with your money.


CRMD Claims To Address An Issue That Already Has Countless, Effective And
Cheap Solutions In Use


Unsophisticated CRMD shareholders mistakenly believe "There is nothing on the U.S.
market that addresses this grave problem" when in fact catheters have been in use for
over 100 years, and infections have always been an issue the medical community has
addressed. To think doctors around the world have just been sitting by idly while their
patients die for 100+ years is obviously absurd.


The truth is there are literally countless solutions put in practice as standard protocol at
hospitals around the world. These solutions are effective, easy to administer, safe and use
a combination of common generic drugs that are so cheap as to be essentially free.
Among these solutions are BOTH antibiotic and many non-antibiotic compounds proven to
be effective and cheap. These are all recommended by CDC and other recognized
disease protocol experts, and have been used effectively for many decades.


CRBIs Already Addressed With Dozens Of Industry Protocols Effectively Deployed
For Decades


Straight Heparin is not the standard protocol for infection prevention in catheter locks as
antibiotic and anti-microbial locks are the recommended protocol and have been for

"Clinical practice guidelines recommend antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) for both
prevention and treatment of catheter-related infections (CRI)"


"Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis
and management of CRI recommend antibiotic locks "


"CVC removal remains first-line therapy for management of CRI, especially in cases
of Staphylococcus aureus and resistant gram-negative pathogens, including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. "


The reason for this is that a simple and virtually free Gentamicin flush reduces infections
by 92%, which is actually more than some of CRMD's efficacy claims.

Despite what CRMD may claim, there are dozens of antibiotics hospitals have at their
disposal should any one infection build resistance to any other antibiotic. This is why they
these protocols have been effectively used for countless decades on tens of millions of
people globally. Including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, folate
antagonists, glycopeptides, glycylcyclines, lipopeptides, oxazolidinones, polymyxins, and
tetracyclines, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, citrate, isopropyl alcohol, HCI acid,
urokinase and countless other catheter lock protocols. To claim there is no solution
available for CRBI is beyond absurd and even just 1 minute of Google research proves
that.

Unfortunately, for CRMD, clinical studies show Taurolidine catheter locks are just not more
effective than what is currently being used while both obviously show benefits vs. heparin
placebo:


"Gentamicin/heparin and taurolidine/citrate, used for locking UC, were similarly
effective at preventing CRB and catheter thrombosis for up to 3 months, until a
functional permanent vascular access became available. Both antimicrobial
lock solutions were superior to heparin in CRB prevention with similar thrombosis
rates."


When CRMD's Neutrolin is compared against the current industry standard, it seems to
obviously offer no benefit. Furthermore, there are special products which hospitals have
had for years to address any unusual infection they come across:


"Several agents that may be used for resistant gram-positive infections including
daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline have been studied."


If you still want to buy CRMD, I have some magic beans to sell you (which haven't gone
bankrupt or partnered with fraudsters).

CRMD's Misleading Neutrolin Presentations


As you now know, a simple heparin catheter lock is NOT the standard for infection
treatment and CRMD's comparison and proposed Phase3 trial against this irrelevant
benchmark seems very misleading to me. In fact, multiple medical studies show
Taurolidine lock is functionally identical to the currently established protocol and is
absolutely NOT "40% better!" than what is currently in use. In light of the above, CRMD's
direct statement of "no approved catheter lock solution" seems blatantly incorrect to me. If
CRMD's Phase3 trial was properly constructed and CRMD forced to compare its worthless
Taurolidine solution against what doctors actually use for catheter infections, medical
studies show there would be essentially no advantage and CRMD would fail.


First of all, heparin has no antimicrobial or anti-infection prevention, so using that as the
baseline is like comparing Neutrolin to a placebo. With cancer trials we don't test oncology
products against Skittles or water, so why does that make sense here? Even more
upsetting, putting trial patients at unnecessary risk of death when the opposing study arm
should be receiving industry standard infection protocols seems irresponsible and
dangerous in my view.

Since we know heparin is NOT the industry standard for catheter infections, why would
CRMD use these misleading presentation slides when pitching its stock to retail investors?


Current Catheter Lock Protocols Penetrate Biofilms "Rapidly" And "Completely"


The other bull case for CRMD revolving around biofilms is equally absurd as the current,
nearly-free and commonly used protocols already address this as well. As you can see
below, there are many compounds which rapidly penetrate biofilms by 100%, and this list
is not even close to inclusive and also doesn't even list the multitude of non-antibiotic
protocols in use today.

It's not just the standard antibiotics in use though that penetrate biofilms effectively as
there is a multitude of other non-antibiotic protocols already in use for years which
effectively deal with biofilms and simultaneously offer synergistic effects with the current
antibiotic protocols as well:


"The antimicrobial effect of potential additives, such as ion chelators like
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citrate, should also be considered.
Such agents have been shown to disrupt biofilm and exhibit synergistic activity with
antibiotics. 12,13"


Many Cheap Non-Antibiotic Solutions Are Superior To CRMD As Well


CRMD touts claim Neutrolin is unique in that it's not an antibiotic, but there are already
many cheap non-antibiotic catheter lock protocols being used around the world that
Neutrolin cannot compete with. This old list below is far from inclusive, but is provided as
example with sites listed, so you can call these places and verify what I am saying.

To expand on this, we can see this study found 1.1 infection episodes per 1,000 catheter
days and furthermore, generic Citrate alone or even simple isopropyl alcohol locks cause
62% reduction in CRB rate vs. heparin. Based on this, it seems a simple iso-alcohol lock
is similarly effective as CRMD's claims!

Some doctors even advocate a simply hydrochloric acid lock as well, which is virtually free
and:


"significantly reduced the need to remove and replace CVCs. The procedure is
practical, appears to be safe, and may reduce the consumption of antibiotics"


While this very simple non-antibiotic also alternatively generated 70.7% lower catheter
infection rates over a study including ~50k catheter days.


Clinical Studies On Taurolidine/Neutrolin Seemingly Contradict CRMD's Efficacy
Claims


To pretend medical consensus on Taurolidine is unanimous is misleading also. There are
multiple clinical trials and medical though leaders who consider use of Taurolidine to be
controversial and not beneficial. This adds an additional layer of risk, and I believe is
another reason, despite being around for 40 years, Taurolidine has never gained
acceptance.


CRMD's Product Metabolizes Into Formaldehyde: Where Are CRMD's Carcinogen
Studies?


Leakage of catheter lock solution into the blood stream is inevitable. Considering this and
the fact Taurolidine metabolizes into formaldehyde, why is CRMD not proposing
Taurolidine carcinogen studies? The FDA has much higher standards than Europe and

Catheter Lock To Become Obsolete Anyway; Coated Catheters The Future: Render
CRMD Obsolete


Unfortunately, these perpetual failure biotechs that never advance to trials (such as
Provectus (PVCT)) frequently see their ancient compounds rendered obsolete by the rapid
pace of innovation that occurs in real biotech and pharma companies. If you talk to
anyone who works deeply in the catheter business, they'll all tell you the same thing:
coated catheters are the future for infection and biofilm elimination when the situation
justifies an increased cost over current protocol.


Technologies relentlessly evolving include anti-microbial coatings, antiseptic
impregnations, ultrasmooth nano-tech coatings, and pharma/biotech solutions.

Biofilm and infection is not an unusual complication in medicine, and the industry has
innovated solutions for this in everything from stents, to pacemakers, to contact lenses.


If you don't believe me, simply look at all the patents recently filed relating to coated, and
anti-microbial coatings, for catheters or the dozens of products already on the market
addressing these issues. The current innovation in medical coatings is impressive and
owning CRMD is inherently a huge bet that the relentless evolution of medical device
coatings will never succeed: if you own CRMD, you are implicitly short medical progress.

All of these trends make CRMD a long-term zero even if you somehow think its product
has value today. This is likely why dialysis giant Gambro dropped Taurolidine years ago
but offers coated infection prevention catheters today. Owning CRMD is effectively a bet
against nanotechnology and innovative coating technologies in healthcare, which is
obviously a bad bet to make.


Neutrolin Not Even Vaguely Cost Effective Vs. Currently Established Medical
Protocols


Probably the most important reason CRMD's old Taurolidine compound is not viable is
because it will just never be cost competitive against what doctors are already using. Even
if CRMD somehow avoided bankruptcy, made it through all regulatory hurdles and was on
the market, it would still be totally financially unviable and worthless.


For example, a typical catheter lock solution will use 0.5ml of 20mg/ml Gentamicin,
5,000iu of heparin and some sodium chloride (saline water). Gentamicin has been generic
forever and so a typical 100mg/ml, 100ml bottle costs just ~$20. If you add up these
ingredients, you can see the typical catheter lock protocol costs a maximum of $6-7 and
most likely much less.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3290585-cormedix-strong-sell-on-partner-failure-misleading-data-and-paid-stock-promotion-minus-91-percent-downside


The numbers I've used here assume both unusually high heparin dosage and zero bulk
purchase discount as well, which any hospital will certainly have. As evidence of the true
cost of your average catheter lock infection prevention protocol check, this Middle East
quote stating $2.50 per lock is typical.


Middle East dialysis presentation


All the ridiculous Roth, Griffin, etc. models using a $20-30+ price per lock application cost
are clearly absurd, and I think there is no chance CRMD could ever make any profit at
these prices. The currently established medical protocols used generic compounds that
are so cheap as to be essentially free and the bulk of the current cost is in the heparin
anyway, which CRMD's Neutrolin has and therefore has no advantage. There is just no
chance Taurolidine with all its risks, doctor perceived uncertainty and cost can ever hope
to compete with what doctors are currently doing when it is infinitely more expensive.
Remember from above Taurolidine locks show are "similarly effective" at best to current
protocols. To convince a cash strapped hospital or health insurance provider, they need to
increase their cost by 10,000% to solve a problem they already have countless solutions
for, is obviously unviable. In fact, it's laughable.


CRMD's Phase3 Trial: Far From Assured


Another demonstrably false claim by CRMD touts is that somehow the company's Phase3
trial is a "sure thing." As we have seen above, when CRMD's Neutrolin is compared
against current industry standard, it is demonstrably not superior as the medical
community has already made these comparisons over decades. We also know CRMD
does not appear to be proposing any carcinogen studies despite that known concern.
There are countless drugs in use in Europe that are not allowed in the U.S. and simply
extrapolating European usage to mean U.S. success is assured is clearly ridiculous.

I think all of the above along with the Phase3 trial is why Elliot is desperately trying to
jettison this failed investment now before the Phase3 trial or product market failure
become undeniable, otherwise why not wait for the theoretically huge upside? Clearly, this
question answers itself.


CRMD Market Claims Far Overstated: German Corporate Records Show
Tauropharm ~$1.3m Business


Tauropharm was spun out of CRMD predecessor BioLink and has been selling a product
functionally identical to CRMD's Neutrolin for 12 years into international markets.
Tauropharm offers four Taurolidine products in the European market: two without heparin
and then in 2007 Tauropharm launched two more products with heparin since some
customers were adding their own heparin independently.


Pic credit Tauropharm


Due to essentially identical products, we can use Tauropharm for a useful proxy for
Taurolidine/CRMD's international market opportunity. Furthermore, since CRMD has said
the two markets are similar in size, we can also use Tauropharm as an indication of how
Neutrolin would do in the U.S. As you can see below, Tauropharm is a tiny company and
basically a failure despite a 15-year head start.


With so many questions about the size of the European markets and Tauropharm, you'd
think someone would just go and pull Tauropharm's German corporate records, which is
cheap and easy (it took me less than 30 minutes to cheaply find it here). I did this and am
happy to share the results with you to help you understand why CRMD repeatedly refuses
to provide any discussion of Tauropharm's financials on CRMD investor calls: Because the
results are abysmal.


Tauropharm has <10 employees (I estimate 3) and has been around for 15 years, yet its
CUMULATIVE earnings are just ~$3.61m euros. That is not a typo.

We can also look at Tauropharm's balance sheet and see it is a tiny business. We know
Tauropharm is the manufacturer of Taurolock bulk product, and yet, we see it has a tiny
balance sheet with total working capital of <4m Euro. Not only that, but also we can see
from the working capital line that Tauropharm's business is, at best, flat lining but likely
shrinking.

From German Corporate Records


Using typical pharma manufacturing balance sheet metrics from peer companies, we can
further corroborate what Tauropharm's estimated annual revenue is as well. Ranbaxy
(OTC:RBXLY) for instance manufactures bulk pharma products and it carries ~258 days of
inventory on hand. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) is more efficient and carries 160 days of
inventory. If we just average the two of these since Tauropharm is small and likely not
extremely efficient, we estimate Tauropharm carries 209 days of inventory.

With the above balance sheet data, we see Tauropharm has ~1.3m Euro of inventory in
2013. With 209 days of inventory on hand that could only support ~2.3m Euros of revenue
for that year. If we consider Tauropharm probably has ~40% gross margins (at best), with
some opex and salary for its 3-4 employees that also roughly triangulates to the income
statement numbers we have above.


Any way you cut it, despite 15 years of effort, Tauropharm isn't a success. You should also
note CRMD claims, in a best case outcome, it would only have a Maximum of 10 years of
market exclusivity in the U.S. so CRMD's results would likely be far weaker than what
Tauropharm has experienced. If that is what CRMD bulls are hanging their hats on, they
are severely mistaken.


Lastly, there is free Tauropharm data online regarding the size of its business. While the
free data isn't as precise, it clearly shows you Tauropharm is closer to 1-2m EUR per
year.

Through four different analysis, we repeatedly arrive at a <$4m per year business after
~15 years of effort and with four different products. I would also note that Tauropharm has
been in the Middle East since at least 2007 so any CRMD touts claiming the Middle East
will be a huge market for CRMD are clearly incorrect.


The reason for CRMD and Tauropharm's failure with Taurolidine catheter locks in Europe
is that the European market is very similar to the U.S. in that there are already countless
proven solutions which are nearly free. Here, we can see a German medical handbook

outlining effective catheter lock solutions from as far back as 2004.


From this book


Germany is also perhaps one of the most cost conscious and efficient developed
healthcare markets in the world. If Taurolidine was some miracle product with a compelling
value proposition, it would not be failing there after 15 years of sales and marketing efforts
generating just $3.5m cumulative of earnings. Given what we now know, how could the
following CRMD management quote possibly be presentable?


"The potential market for Neutrolin, we stated it's $500 million. It's almost evenly
split between the U.S. and EU."


I also find it concerning CRMD management has also repeatedly refused to provide any
color on the possible size of Tauropharm on the investor calls. These records are easily
available so I only see two possibilities here:


1. Is CRMD's management ignorant and incompetent so its "guidance" should be
disregarded?


2. Is the company's management dishonest and self-enriching so its "guidance" should
be disregarded?


CRMD International Launch Also A Failure


We don't need to look at Tauropharm though, we can see from CRMD's international
market Neutrolin failure that Neutrolin/Taurolidine is just not financially viable. CRMD has
now been selling Neutrolin in the international markets for 18 months including Italy, Malta,
Austria, the Netherlands and other markets.

losses actually accelerated badly. If this market were large and viable, I think it is obvious
CRMD would not be failing miserably across multiple countries and multiple sales forces
with its "new! Amazing!" product.


Given everything we just learned, I am not surprised CRMD is apparently not in a hurry to
put its product on the market in the U.S. If the company ever does put the product on the
U.S. market, it seems obvious that it would fail very badly very quickly. If the CRMD "story"
imploded, what would that mean for the "gravy train" of high insider compensation coupled
with significant insider selling? Most likely the company would declare bankruptcy again
and they'd all lose their jobs.


CRMD's Recent German Patent Failure


I think it is clear when dealing with teams of people like CRMD insiders, you, to put it
nicely, should be skeptical. With that in mind, I got the German legal transcript and it
seems to bring up some very "questionable disclosure issues" I believe CRMD's
management need to address immediately as the German courts have spoken loud and
clear and anyone can get these transcripts cheaply with a German lawyer.


I will share with you my own best-effort translations of some choice quotes, but I strongly
encourage you to go get and translate this whole transcript for yourself because it's a
doozy.


For background, CRMD recently sued Tauropharm over a new patent CRMD filed
regarding the company's claims over the addition of heparin to a Catheter Lock despite
Tauropharm selling these products since 2003 without previous complaint. Now this is
being decided across the German courts where CRMD will try and legally outspend a
company that actually has profits and without CRMD's egregious insider compensation
costs. The latest German court decision to go against CRMD is in regards to CRMD's
overly aggressive claim of an injunction against Tauropharm.


In response to this, the German court analyzed CRMD's ridiculous patent to see if it was
novel enough to merit ruling that Tauropharm was in violation and should be stopped. The
German courts clearly ruled NO and the language they provided, which will surely be read
and understood by the patent courts, seems loud and clear.

I'll remind you CRMD's management did not seem to me to properly disclose this initially,
instead the company seems to have filed the bare minimum 8-K SEC filing as required by
law, then forced CRMD shareholders to dial into a conference call. Even then it appears to
me this issue was not fully disclosed in depth, so let me set the record straight.


I believe what you will find is this document clearly shows CRMD's claims to any unique
patentable product is a lost cause and waste of shareholder money.

(Go hire a German lawyer to verify these if you don't believe me)


Clearly, this whole patent debacle is desperate and absurd. CRMD never mentioned any
IP infringement in any of its IPO documents, and Tauropharm has been openly selling
Taurolock since 2003. Why the sudden lawsuit claims if not to temporarily prop up CRMD
stock? Is this just another "story" designed to support the stock price for the benefit of
insiders?

Just looking at this patent mess and using common sense will help you. CRMD came out
of nowhere and sued a German company, in Germany, for a product on sale for over 12
years, based on a recent patent focused on the addition of simple heparin to a catheter
lock. Everyone knows heparin in catheter lock is essentially required and has been part of
the standard protocol for decades. Clearly, the addition of heparin in various dosages is
not novel. This would be analogous to me filing a patent regarding water in KoolAid and
then suing KoolAid co. Obviously, adding water to KoolAid and heparin to a catheter lock
is not a novel concept.


Either way, this lawsuit is probably going to drag on for countless years and cost CRMD
many millions more. What seems clear is any CRMD touts claiming big payments from
Tauropharm are misguided. More likely this gamble will backfire in CRMD's face, and I
believe CRMD could very well eventually be liable for Tauropharm's legal bills (and go
bankrupt as a result?), as Germany is nowhere near as tolerant towards frivolous lawsuits
as America.


If CRMD is obviously such a failure, then what are CRMD insiders really doing with this
worthless product? What are they honestly doing with this failed public company shell?


CRMD's Public "Bagholder Machine": CRMD Insiders Pay Themselves More Than Is
Spent On R&D


Chart built by me with public information from CapIQ


Just the ~5 named executives alone have removed over $15m in shareholder value from
this shell over the past few years while, best I can tell, doing nothing but failing and
endlessly publishing wildly promotional press releases which later turn out to be wrong.
Even more offensive, over the past few years CRMD's insider compensation has actually
accelerated to the point its insiders are now siphoning off more money for themselves
than they even spend on R&D!

How Have CRMD Insiders Possibly Funded This Disaster?


Chart built by me with CapIQ info


Lucky for CRMD insiders, they have a publicly traded shell now which they can use to
dump stock on retail shareholders, so insiders can collect their millions of compensation
for constantly failing to do what they say they will. Without this disgusting public shell, it
seems obvious they'd all just go bankrupt (again) as happened when this was a private
company (despite a temporary partnership with Fresenius back then too).


Keep in mind an "At The Market Transaction Offering" (or ATM) literally entails the
company selling you its stock directly in the market and keeping the cash from your
account. In the light of the retail shareholder base and everything we've seen above, I find
this direct "wealth transfer" to be offensive and disgusting.


Is CRMD Targeting Retail Investors? CRMD's Paid Stock Promotion And Gambling
Conferences


When a previously-bankrupt company has over a decade of failure, with ties to people
sued for fraud, somehow reaches a temporary $250m+ valuation but is held almost
exclusively by unsophisticated retail shareholders, this is a huge red flag. If this is "real,"
where are the reputable healthcare investors?

So how exactly did CRMD end up with one of the most unsophisticated retail message-
board based shareholder bases I've ever seen? Was this an accident?


Unsurprisingly (given Rosenwald's involvement), CRMD has a history of what seems to be
paid stock promotion. For instance, this wildly promotional "Life Sci" report appears made
up to look like a real research report from a Wall Street bank. The fine print at the bottom
of page 46 reveals the truth:


Or this comically bad "Griffin Securities" report which on the surface appears almost real
but, yet again, careful analysis of disclosures reveals the truth, where Griffin is apparently
so bullish it won't even pay for the postage:


Or how about CRMD's CEO literally taking a shareholder-funded Vegas party trip to pitch
worthless stock at a conference apparently aimed specifically at gamblers? This
unbelievable conference includes such relevant topics as "Craps Lessons" and
"Sports/Horse betting." If CRMD was about to be imminently acquired, why would the
CEO have time to go to a Vegas gambling party?


CRMD's Evercore Sale Process: Obviously Failed


Over 3 months ago, CRMD started a "strategic review" process that the company claimed
would take a maximum of 6 months. Since then, both CRMD insiders and through their
company's ATM have dumped hundreds of thousands of shares and made many open-
market transactions. These were not 10b5-1 transactions which could potentially be
protected from insider trading laws, these were straight-up open-market sell orders. Make
no mistake, if CRMD had anything material and undisclosed going on, nobody would be
making any open-market transactions - or they would be violating federal securities laws
and should be in jail, there is no middle ground. The CRMD legal team would never allow
it and it would be in jeopardy of horrific future lawsuits that would wipe it out personally.
Furthermore, with the warrant exercises and cash on hand, CRMD already had 12m+

CRMD pattern chart built by me


CRMD has almost gone bankrupt several times and given a raging bull market for
speculative biotech dreck, has seized the moment. Despite claiming the company is "in
play" and with plenty of cash, CRMD claimed it wouldn't need to issue any stock but
instead filed a huge ATM and immediately began dumping hundreds of thousands of
shares of CRMD stock into the corresponding stock price rise largely created by confused
retail shareholders. Literally, taking the cash from unsophisticated retail shareholders and
putting into their worthless public shell where insiders it seems will collect yet another
$15m of compensation and endlessly miss its own promises.


CRMD Must Be A Sure Thing Since Elliott Put 0.00396% Of Its Portfolio In CRMD
Years Ago, Right?


First of all, big name investors get hosed in frauds all the time like Paulson and SinoForest
for example. I will point out three reasons investors are confused about the importance of
Elliot's involvement though.


1. Elliot's backstop of CRMD was SENIOR DEBT and only $3m (way to be bullish…) and
carried both a 6% interest rate and hundreds of thousands of free warrants AND the
loan terms carried insane "death spiral" terms. These "loan shark" terms in no way can
be interpreted by any astute investor as a bullish indication while the total $3m value,
huge amount of free warrants and high interest rate mean that in a worst case
outcome if/when CRMD goes bankrupt Elliot could have ended up owning the whole
company for $3m. Incidentally, this $3m cost is only slightly more than what CRMD
fetched in the last bankruptcy process when no real pharma company wanted to buy
these worthless assets.


2. The tiny amount of CRMD equity Elliot owns was purchased at average prices far
below where the stock trades today.


3. Elliot Management's 1.8m shares of CRMD may seem like a lot to you, but this is
approximately nothing compared to its $25+ BILLION in assets under management.
CRMD represents less than 0.0396% of its portfolio or (as in 3.9 tenths of one
percent) and was likely some random idea from an intern or junior analyst. Elliott isn't
even a healthcare fund anyway, and I think it is clearly trapped in a failed investment,
trying to do anything it can to salvage this failure. The fact Elliot made a mistake here
doesn't change reality.


4. What would you do if Elliot began rapidly selling its stock? There is no margin of safety
in CRMD, and Elliot has no way out without destroying CRMD.

Elliot has been wiped out in Rosenwald disasters in the past as well. Elliot was a large bag
holder of Ventrus which Lindsay Rosenwald actually founded himself. How did this other
Rosenwald disaster, which also lured Elliot in, go for shareholders?

Elliot/Rosenwald's VTUS was a disaster and fell -95.7%, and the company was sued for
"false and misleading statements" and misrepresenting FDA trial info and wiped everyone
out. Not that it matters to Rosenwald though as he was paid $25k a month to Lindsay's
firm Paramount Corporate Dev. While you may get hosed, Rosenwald "somehow" always
seems to do well on his stocks …

Following Elliot into Rosenwald biotechs is obviously a bad idea, and once the Evercore
company sale process formally fails, CRMD's stock will implode like all his other biotech
wipeouts.


Repeated CFO Turnover And CRMD Auditor Found To Have "Audit Deficiencies"


As if the huge mess of red flags above weren't enough, CRMD has gone through 3 CFOs
(so far) since just 2012, has "material weakness" regarding financial/accounting internal
controls, and the company has faced repeated "going concern statements" expressing
doubts CRMD can avoid insolvency.


Even more concerning however is CRMD's curious and sudden "auditor shopping"
resulting in changing auditors now to the questionable "Friedman LLP" who has faced
repeated, failed audit inspections. In 2008, the PCAOB inspected Friedman and found
"audit deficiencies" and "failure to perform sufficient audit procedures." One would think
after a disastrous failed inspection like that, Friedman would fix its issues immediately. In
2013's PCAOB inspection, Friedman actually seems to have gotten worse showing even
more "audit deficiencies." Furthermore, there was failure to test controls related to
revenue and cash as well as "failure by the firm to perform" … "certain necessary audit
procedures."

CRMD's previous auditor CohnReznick was with CRMD for years, and yet the company
changed auditors suddenly despite knowing the above public information about Friedman.
Why would CRMD possibly decide to suddenly change auditors to this apparently low-
quality audit firm shown to have performed insufficient audit work with audit deficiencies??


Furthermore, CRMD only had five employees, but somehow burns through $10-20m per
year! Where exactly is all the money going?!


Given all these red flags, it seems to me CRMD is rotting from the inside out.


CRMD's Extremely Weak "IP" Claims


The most absurd part of all the past biotech failures getting re-hyped in this crazy biotech
market is they are based on ancient technology with corresponding expiring patents. Even
in the ~0% chance a biotech "re-hype" does anything real and ever gets through
regulatory hurdles AND ever make any money, any real generic pharma company like
Teva (NYSE:TEVA), Mylan or Ranbaxy will obviously destroy these weak "follow on"
patents and take drink the milkshake of these random biotechs.


In CRMD's case, we can see the majority of its patents expire about the same time CRMD
management's (endlessly postponed) market launch date and its ridiculous follow-on
patents are weak and likely unenforceable if anyone ever cared to challenge it (they don't).

CRMD Management Response


I called CRMD management repeatedly for weeks to try and get answers, but I was
unable to ever get anyone to pick up the phone. I'm not even convinced it come into the
office and any company that can't answer its phone for investors is a huge red flag in my
view. I encourage you to immediately call CRMD and speak to the company YOU own as
a shareholder to demand it clarifies the multitude of issues raised here.

CRMD: True Fair Value - "Optimistic Case" Shows -91.04% Downside


Now that we understand CRMD's sole product is not commercially viable, let's be very
generous and assume CRMD's insiders don't simply take whatever minimal value or
shareholder cash is left for themselves and endlessly dilute everyone into oblivion. I will
generously assume CRMD's European business grows 40% next year (it won't). I will also
assume CRMD ever goes through with its comically delayed Phase3 AND gets approved
AND launched AND produces sales 3x higher than Tauropharm AND this is all done
according to CRMD management's notoriously unreliable timeline estimates.


Even being optimistic and making all these obviously unrealistic assumptions STILL
shows CRMD's fair value per share of $0.445 per share for -91.04% downside, which is
actually still 3x higher than where its stock traded in just 2012. More realistically though, I
think CRMD will just go bankrupt (again) eventually once its cash runs out and retail
shareholders finally wake up and refuse to fund this insider enriching bagholder machine.
A financially unviable product controlled by a team of people seemingly intent on self-
enrichment is fundamentally worthless in my view, especially as foundational patents are
expiring soon.

Note a full 81.6% of CRMD's fair value calculated above is made up of the cash the
company just raised. I am convinced insiders will just keep this and burn it so this should
likely be adjusted downward in value by some amount, but remember I am trying to be as
generous to CRMD as possible here.


CRMD Stock Technically Breaking Down On Huge Volume: "Head and Shoulders" &
Wedge Broken


The only thing worse than the fundamentals here is the short-term technical chart. CRMD
has broken through a classic head and shoulders pattern, as well as breaking down
through a large wedge pattern. As you can see in the chart below, there is zero technical
support for CRMD stock until ~$1.32 per share, which would still give CRMD a $63.71m
market cap, which as you can see based on the fundamentals above is still wildly
overvalued. I don't have to remind you CRMD was a $0.14 stock recently in 2012 so it
may be interesting to think about the value of your investment as it round trips that price.


Chart by me


I will also point out CRMD stock has been imploding on huge volume recently. You can
trust InvestorVillage or IHub all you want, but the reality is large holders are dumping the
company stock in big volume while all you see on the message boards is wild, unjustified
optimism. I think it is obvious someone is getting fooled, please make sure it isn't you. Are
message board touts promoting optimism while aggressively dumping their stock and
warrants?


It honestly makes me sad to see so many retail shareholders get "bagged" over and over
and over. I'm pleading with you guys, please pay attention and stop buying impossibly

PumpStopper Makes His Call: "CRMD Will Never Be Sold For $250m+, Actual Fair
Value $0.000"


"To Plunge or Not to Plunge, That is the Question"


Picture by me


CRMD Conclusion: Don't Fall For It


CRMD's unsophisticated retail investors are expecting a dramatic, company-sale
conclusion to the company's "strategic review process" in 2H 2015, which is clearly never
going to happen. The German patent lawsuits just blew up in CRMD's face and
Tauropharm corporate records show the Taurolidine catheter lock market is a tiny fraction
of that which is portrayed by CRMD.


Every day that goes by is more confirmation the Evercore sale process has obviously
failed. As retail investors understand this reality, while simultaneously the research
showing CRMD's sole product is unviable and worthless, I expect the company stock to
continue imploding eventually back to its previous lows of $0.14 per share on its way to
another bankruptcy while Rosenwald and insiders collect another $15m of shareholder
money based on endless failure and dilution.

Even if you ignore all of the above AND think CRMD insiders are honest people with your

The author is playing on the average investor not being able to discriminate between treating actual infections
and preventing them. He confuses antibiotics to treat infections with solutions to prevent infections and claims
solutions like high concentration citrate are potential competitors when that will never be used in the US. Sad,
but if you want the truth the author is the one scamming retail investors by covering his short postion while
they sell on this fear. The FDA approved the study as designed (Neutrolin vs heparin) with a 40% reduction in
infection as the endpoint needed. Despite what the author claims, if CRMD meets this endpoint with
Neutrolin, it will be approved. Odds are extremely good this will happen as I described in my article:
http://seekingalpha.co.... After phase 3 success, Neutrolin will be the first and only treatment with an FDA
label indicating use for prevention of catheter related bloodstream infections and thrombosis. You want to bet
how many hospitals or clinics will risk using something not labeled for this when a labeled product that has
been through Phase 3 testing reduces infection 90%+.

I could rebut your claims one by one, but if people will actually look at the presentation you reference:  
http://tinyurl.com/qe5... 
They will see how you have twisted the facts to meet your own conclusions. Gentamicin is no competitor to
Neutrolin. Why? Within 8 months gentamicin resistant infections appeared and the locking solution was
abandoned. This article is disgustingly deceitful. 
Taken directly from the slides you linked:  
"Over a 4 year period, beginning in October 2002, we initiated a 
gentamicin/heparin lock (GHL) protocol in 1488 chronic hemodialysis patients receiving dialysis through a
tunneled catheter in 8 outpatient units. receiving dialysis through a tunneled catheter in 8 outpatient units. 
CRI rate decreased from 17 to 3.7 events per 1000 catheter days 
Beginning 8 months after initiation of the GHL protocol, febrile incidents occurred in 17 patients with 26
episodes of coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus resistant to gentamicin. Over the 4 years of GHL use,
an additional 8 patients developed 10 episodes of gentamicin-resistant CRI… 
Due to these events, the GHL was discontinued in 2006. While the use of a GHL effectively lowered the CRI
rate in our dialysis population, within 8 months gentamicin-resistant CRI emerged." 
Wonder why you didn't provide these details?


If needed I can refute just about every other claim you make in this presentation with facts: probably even
from links you provide. Kinda like hydrocholoric acid used to salvage CVC's in one patient population...not
actually prevent infection as you try to make the reader believe.


BTW: You call this a pump. Who was hired to pump this. You didn't name a single pumping entity.

Or how about we analyze high concentration citrate. From the same presentation:  
"One 10 ml injection of 46.7% solution resulted in severe cardiac arrhythmias." How many docs in the US are
going to use this? None.


How about alcohol as the author proposes: Oh wait that the same presentation said: 
"Ethanol could degrade catheter materials. Weak antibacterial effect."


Hope people are getting the drift here. The author is attempting deception after deception after deception,
hoping you won't research any of his claims and just for some reason believe he has your interests at heart.


Neutrolin actually stood out above all the other compounds and was the first one listed in the presentation
with no known side effects.

Author’s reply »  you clearly didn't read the report and cherry pick one single anti biotic compound and one
quote out of the dozens and dozens of both antibiotic and nonantibiotcs and miss the point entirely .


you retail guys exhaust me. the research and my views speak for themselves.


the easiest way to handle this is just come back in 12-18 months and see how this worked out.


I believe you also have predicted CRMD will get sold as well right? if so I'd love to hear your update on when
that will happen

Author’s reply »  the lock protocols in the study that compared Taurolidine vs. Current Solutions, which
deemed them "similarly effective" (aka: no benefit), used the same methods for both arms, which can be used
to both treat and prevent. I think you're in way over your head here, I've tried to help you and this was really
meant as a checklist "op ed" to help retail people from getting hosed in biotech disasters like this.


you miss the point entirely anyway, there are large developed markets where this has been approved similar
in size to the US and Taurolidine catheter lock solutions have been a failure for over 15 years.


the phase3 against hep seems useless, and I explained my opinion, and CRMD's ridiculous "Neutorlin!"
product is worthless because people in the medical community are already using effective solutions which
cost $2.50


repeating your tired arguments from your articles (posted when CRMD was much much higher) do not
change reality


I believe the research shows CRMD is worthless and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.

Author’s reply »  you and I both know that citrate claim is a one off issue from years ago resulting in part from
someone using far above the recommended dosage and while citrate is not commonly used in the US
anymore, it is very frequently used around the world for this indication for many years on millions of patients.


the study showing ethanol ELIMINATED recurring infections is linked. I'm not going to repeat the whole report
in the comments section just because you refuse to read it.


If Neutrolin/Taurolidine was viable Fresenius (who knows infinitely more about this than you) would not have
"passed" on CRMD when given the chance, repeatedly, to acquire CRMD for essentially free


let me ask again: since you seem to have promoted that CRMD would get acquired, what is your update on
the timing of that?

Not only does the author misrepresent material facts about locking solutions, he misrepresents the German
translation (intentional). He claims this statement:  
Hiervon ausgehend liegt die Annahme nahe, dass das Klagegebrauchsmuster neuheits schadlish getroffen ist 
refers the the patent when it does not. It in fact references the Utility Model, which has a much different
standard than the patent. Innocent mistake or intentional deception. 
Plug this into any electronic translation software and you can figure out this translation. Wonder what else is
missing based on his cut and paste hack job. He likes to link to potentially damning pieces of information from
articles, cut out and paste small pieces, but fail to present the entire story (Gentamicin example above). He
presents this as the entire truth even when his conclusions are refuted by the very text he quotes. 
Why don't you provide for us the complete transcript (upload and link it). You've proven untrustworthy in even
the most basic of translations, why should we believe anything you say?

The more I dig, the worse this article gets. In your section on Neutrolin and "formaldehyde." Did you bother to
look at any of your links? For example the first link in this section was to these slides: http://tinyurl.com/nj6... 
which concluded: "The CLSs based on Taurolodine or anti-septic seem 
provide a good prophylaxis for both clotting and infection with least side effects." I notice you stole your cost
analysis (page 43) from them so I assume you also read this statement! 
Additionally, you disingenuously raise a concern about cancer from formaldehyde produced as a byproduct of
Taurolidine breakdown, but provide no backdrop: such as the fact that our own cells make formaldehyde. Just
to be consistent with your theme of providing links that refute your position, you could have provided this one
to cancer.org's statement on formaldehyde: http://tinyurl.com/njr...

It would have put any concerns the general public might have at ease (although you could have failed to
comment on this part). Obviously the FDA did not have a concern when they approved CRMD's Phase 3
study.


30 Jun 2015, 02:01 AM


Pharma Investor, Contributor
Or how about we analyze your claim the typical locking solution is worth $2.50? You realize your report is
from the "Middle East Dialysis Presentation," and somehow you believe that will translate to the US market.
Get real. You obviously have no clue that while a drug like Sovaldi retails in the US for $84,000/treatment
course (insurance discounts may bring it down 40-50% now that ABBV has a competitor), in Egypt the same
treatment course costs $900. There is about a 500% difference in reimbursement between these two
countries. Locking solutions in the US will likely go for multiples of your $2.50, so why don't you insert a more
appropriate number into your calculation with the appropriate patient base? Probably because it will paint a
better picture than you want to present...you're not interested in facts however, just distorting them.

Pump Stopper - you've obviously spent a great deal of time developing the article.


couple quick questions:


1) do you have a financial interest in the movement of the stocks you cover?  
2) do you receive anything of value from others as a result of articles you publish?  
3) do you receive assistance in developing your articles from any person or institution which would likely have
a financial interest in the movement of the stock?


I think these are reasonable disclosure questions every investor should ask whenever they read an extremely
positive or negative article. I also think it is reasonable for an above board writer to respond.


Thanks in advance and I'll be awaiting your reply.

BEDMINSTER, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / May 23, 2016 / CorMedix Inc. (NYSE MKT: CRMD), a pharmaceutical
company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment
of infectious and inflammatory disease, announced today Dr. Christoph Wanner, Professor of Medicine and
Director of Nephrology at the University of Wurzburg, delivered an oral presentation titled, "A Novel
Taurolidine Containing Catheter Lock Solution (CLS) Without Reported Antimicrobial Resistance, Reduces
the Rates of Infection and Thrombosis in Hemodialysis Patients Enrolled in a Post-Approval Surveillance
Study" at the 53rd ERA-EDTA Congress in Vienna, Austria.


In the study, Dr. Wanner evaluated the use of Neutrolin, CorMedix's CE Marked anti-infective solution for the
prevention of catheter-related blood infections (CRBSIs) and thrombosis, which are the major complications
observed in patients undergoing hemodialysis with indwelling central venous catheters. Under the study, 202
hemodialysis patients at 20 hemodialysis centers in Germany were enrolled in the ongoing Neutrolin Use
Monitoring Program (NUMP), representing 15,464 dialysis sessions over a 26-month period, for a total of
36,083 hemodialysis catheter days. These data demonstrated that use of Neutrolin is associated with 96.0%
reduction in the rate of CRBSI and 96.7% reduction in thrombosis compared to published historical
benchmarks of 3.5 CRBSIs and 2-3 episodes of thrombosis per 1,000 catheter days. No significant adverse
drug reactions that led to the discontinuation of Neutrolin use were reported. 
Randy Milby, CorMedix CEO, said, "The medical community around the world have shown interest in
Neutrolin's real world clinical performance in preventing catheter-related infections and thrombosis, as
bloodstream infections remain a primary concern for hospitals worldwide. This presentation demonstrates our
strong interest in gaining clinical acceptance of Neutrolin around the world by developing and sharing clinical
data supporting Neutrolin's use in patients with indwelling venous catheters required for vascular access in
various settings including hemodialysis, oncology, critical care, parenteral nutrition, IV hydration and/or IV
medications."


Christoph Wanner, M.D., Lead Author and Professor of Medicine, Head of Nephrology, Department of
Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Scientific director, Clinical Trial Unit, at University Hospital of Würzburg,
stated, "Catheter Related Bloodstream Infections and thrombosis are the major healthcare complications in
HD patients, creating a need for effective treatments. The results of our study support the use of Neutrolin in
reducing CVC related complications of infection and thrombosis in HD patients."

Pharma Investor, Contributor
Funny Matt. The only thing that is complete and utter garbage here is this article. The author has no grasp of
German or financial statements whatsoever. Translation errors throughout. Complete misrepresentation of the
facts for example: 
He states: "2012 was record year for Tauropharm, which took over a decade to build to, and yet Tauropharm
generated <1 million euro, while the previous year it made 57,000 euro (no, I didn't forget any zeros)." 
Did anyone actually look at the statement the author included (SA Editors even)? He obviously has no clue
the middle column "veränderung zum vorjahr in prozent" means "change from previous year in percent." In
2011, Tauropharm did not generate 57k--57 relates percent change from 2011. From this form alone they had
604K euro in net income in 2011, and over 1 million euro in profits (not bad for 3 employees to split amongst
themselves). They did even better in 2012 with 1.793 million euro profits. This doesn't even include the profits
they may see from various other layers of their organization (manufacturing/distrib... in different countries). 
The more I re-look at this article, the more comical it is. He messed up pretty much every fact...but I guess
that was the point eh. See here for all his bogus medical claims and other errors: 
http://bit.ly/1GRutC1 
About social media: How about we look at the social media short attack? Look at The PS's IDI article and see
how he claims there was a pump of IDI. Well, what happens when we look at Yahoo message boards about
CRMD....boy, lots of identical short posts eerily similar to the methods used to supposedly "Pump" IDI. 
http://yhoo.it/1Ip6wr8 
Or how about we look at a few twitter posters who post almost solely negatively on CRMD (River of Truth,
Love of Money, etc). Why is there a coordinated short attack on CRMD, and who's funding it?

Well done Pump Stopper. CRMD is just another Lindsay Rosenwald scam.


29 Jun 2015, 11:22 AM


Modis, Contributor
While I do agree with your premise that crmd is overvalued, you have some pretty flagrant misconceptions about the
science involved. You state that hospitals have lots of drugs to treat infection. neutrolin PREVENTS those infections,
it's no treatment. And it's very effective for that. In the course of my DD, I've talked to German hospitals. The nurses
I've talked to ALL agree neutrolin is the superior product. Those in public hospitals complained that they have to use
citrates for their lower cost.


That is the speculative investment premise btw; neutrolin use would be encouraged if it can show cost Savings
overall. It is more effective, the trials and nurses unanimous opinion make that clear. And seeing as there are no
competitors (just generic formulations) there is a decent chance they can become soc.


Lastly, the main stumbling block is the cost of the API, taurolidine. citrates are cheaper than dirt. Tauro is very
expensive, so either profit margins are crimped or its too expensive for wide adoption. review treatment costs for
complications vs a daily neutrolin dose, and the overall cost benefits to insurers don't reach statistical significance. On
paper they're there, but to reach wide adoption years of data would have to be accumulated.


So unless taurolidine can be made cheaper OR governments order it's use, I don't expect sales to impress. 
I'll keep following crmd for those events. But they are not worthless. overpriced, yes, but no scam. scams don't get a
QIDP either.

Author’s reply »  there are already established protocols and Tauro has been investigated for decades. There
is no chance this becomes the standard. It's been available for ~15 years in established and modern medical
settings and has never caught on. I am not speculating, you can look at what is actually happening and see it
for yourself.


"Tauro is very expensive, so either profit margins are crimped or its too expensive for wide adoption"


this sounds like you're saying it's completely unviable?


if this thing is so amazing CRMD should just run a trial comparing this to gentamicin/hep lock or other
established protocols and we will see how effective it is. Unfortunately for CRMD longs, scientists have
already run studies and it seems Taurolidine has not shown to offer any benefit and is 10-20x the price......

"CorMedix and [RC]2 Pharma Connect LLC, have reached an agreement which will provide CorMedix with a
cGMP API source able to produce needed volumes as CorMedix expands the sales of Neutrolin"


"...provide us with sufficient cGMP API to meet the needs for potential expanded uses, including U.S. market
entry, which would significantly reduce the cost of taurolidine, by up to 80 percent, thereby increasing the
pharmaceutical manufacturing margins"

after you wrote the negative CBMG article saying the stock had "94.6% downside" the stock fell for a few
hours, then next day traded 400,000 shares in the opening 60-minutes, far beyond its normal hourly volume.
appears longs bailed, shorts covered (quite possibly you covered your short?). in the first hour the day after
your article appeared on SA the stock proceeded to begin a rally of 100% ($20+) over the next 2 months.

These shorts appear to go by multiple names, collaborate with each other, release a hit piece, cover in the
first fews hours, and could care less about the long term prospects of the company. They have admitted as
much on Twitter (coordinated authorship). It's sad they have to try to make money this way. So many lies in
this piece. Worst lies are about Neutrolin. Notice, the author's cloaking his statements with words he can
wiggle out of like: "Seems" or "seemingly". It's a hit piece and that's it. Don't get fooled. The author confuses
prevention and treatment of blood stream infections almost every other line (purposely deceitful) and brings
up treatments not available in the US (high concentration citrate). I've researched alcohol locks, etc...no
comparison to Neutrolin. Pathetic piece.

Can I ask question to author; why would Russell add them to Russell 3000 and Russell Global Index? It seems logical
they did some due diligence and had their research team look into company.

@28707385 There is no due dilligence performed by Russell. The qualifications for index membership are
well known, you can find them in this document:

No due dilligence is really performed. Many scams end up in the indices.


Scam companies trumpet their inclusion in indices to con suckers, to get them to believe that somehow these
scams have been vetted. Don't be a sucker.

PS aka 28:


Clearly a straw-man created to ask this disingenuous question, so that it could be answered so as to distract
from the obvious weaknesses of the innuendo that substitutes for a comprehensive look at material facts. Just
because you answered this softball question honestly doesn't mean it has ANY relevance to the value.


This ruse is consistent with your shotgun approach with the emphasis on irrelevant issues in the over-long
article as though just want a quick-panicked exit before the article can even be read to completion. Good job
on that part of your plan to help poor retail investors.


Unfortunate, that despite you assertion of $0 value, and after a great start with the steep drop of $1 in just 40
minutes after this article's publication, it's already rebounded 17% from the $3.62 bottom. Darn sheeple just
don't always listen.


Too bad you are just trying to help investors. It would have been a great way to help a hedge fund cover a
great price. The short term drop could be all they would need to accomplish their goal. Maybe next time, you
can pre-coordinate with a fund who is looking to cover a short position and maybe go long at the same time.


You might even start a career being a freelance hedge-fund facilitator and still be proud of your great service
educating helpless retail investors who read SA.

Hedge funds really put a lot of work into this one worried about the legal proceedings imo...So many inaccuracies in
this.  
1) CRMD was never a shell - its a lie. 
2) LR owns less than 2.5% and really has nothing to do with current company or management. Agree not the greatest
guy but the sensationalism of this article using him as a big reason to avoid shows the nature of the article. 
3) Almost all of the published and peer reviewed articles show 80% to 90% infection reduction. EU approved it as
device based on clinical trials. NUMP data on real life patients showing 96% infection reduction at Kidney meeting
and in Spain and London. Consistent with clinical data 
4) Tauropharm recognizes revenues from multiple geographies - Middle East revenues are more than above alone. 
5) Gambro has never bid for Cormedix 
6) Fresenius has tried to buy Neutrolin on two occasions - from ND Partners and Cormedix 
7) FDA has granted Neutrolin BOTH fast track and QIDP - these two facts mean more than the entire article above. 
8) Mentioning LR who owns 2.5% and not Elliot who owns over 25% again shows the skewed view of this article and
its purpose is to distort. I will take Elliot's track record over the author 100% of the time

not the hang up in my opinion....


29 Jun 2015, 11:55 AM

Another inaccuracy - QIDP under the Gain Act means the FDA believes this "drug" will contribute significantly
to helping the antibiotic resistance and resulting superbug problem that is right no the NUMBER 1 priority in
US hospitals at the moment and a Top priority of the FDA. It adds at least 5 yrs exclusivity to the Neutrolin
commercialization - giving it a 10+ yr commercialization edge. Please do some due diligence before writing an
article next time. Elliot owns 25% of this company - LR is a passive 2.5% investor with nothing to do with
company for years and you show his picture and no one from Elliot?

I have read it - you never mention Elliot owns 25% of the company - instead you harp on LW - a passive 2.5%
investor who has not been involved in the company for yrs. You mention LW failures but fail to mention the
HUGE successes of the majority owner which are infinitely more important to this than LW - Elliot who owns
over 25% of CRMD. Elliot increased its stake in Informatica to 9.4% a lot lower & it sold it for huge gains-
going private...Add it to Riverbed, EMC, McKesson & many others where Elliot adds LOTS of value....CRMD
on deck.... LW has nothing to do with CRMD since the turnaround.....CRMD is in Elliot and Evercore's
hands...

Author’s reply »  CRMD is not any of those companies and Elliot has gotten totally burned in these kind of
names including a recent Rosenwald biotech wipeout which I explain.


The stock Elliot owns was bought far cheaper and is an insignificant piece of their portfolio. At big funds I
understand it is typical to humor the summer interns and very jr analysts and help them develop by putting
tiny pieces of the portfolio into their ideas. I wouldn't be surprised if that is what is going on here. There is a
good chance you are piggy backing the idea of a summer intern in my view.


The research shows Rosenwald has been involved with CRMD in a big way for many years, the SEC filings
don't lie.


It's your money, I can't stop you from burning it or leading people into a preventable financial wipeout no
matter how depressing I think it is. best of luck.

All it means is that the company filled out a form, and checked the right boxes.

In return, IF Neutrolin gets approved (a huge IF) THEN they will get extra years of market exclusivity.


QIDP is in NO WAY an endorsement from the FDA on the merits of a drug. (For that matter neither is fast

Nice in depth research, This is the first article that I read from you and it shows you've put a lot of work and time in
this.  
Back in the May, I alerted the public of CRMD's association with the failed AMRN and the fact that they are sharing
offices as well as consultants. But as usual the "hopefuls" did not believe and had some unrealistic explanations. 
The latest so called insider purchase by Taunia Markvicka was marked as a purchase by a Director. 
Ms. Markvika is the senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Pacira Pharmaceuticals. 
Now it gets more interesting, so please stay focused. Amarian / Pacira / Cormedix 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals president is Dave Stack, who is a director of (dadaaa) Amarian Corporation.  
As the author said: (The Amarin (AMRN) "Fish Oil Wipeout": Sued For Fraud Allegations) 
Mr. Stack joined Amarian when the stock prices moved as high as $15.00 a share and then tanked to under $1.00 in
2014 
Mr. Stack is a director of a failed bio pump, but houses Cormedix in its office, and then his Vice President, Ms.
Markvicka becomes a director of Coremedix and buys a tiny amount of shares. 
That’s why I wasn’t excited about the latest “insider” purchase, the insider professional relationships are just too -
007secret - for me.


The last that I checked CRMD’s websites was updated and now show the actual address of Amarian corp as its office
address, which it did not before so maybe we can now call this the Office Gate.


As the author detailed, the relationships of CRMD with other failed bio pumps are many and as always investor be
aware.

Let's be clear - Cormedix has ZERO to do with Amarin..Nothing.


Your comment is so ridiculous - again we know what this article is. Those of us in CELG saw pieces like this 4
times a yr in early yrs...who can forget "Leper Stock" in Streetwalker in Forbes....


Unfortunately in biotech you get hedge funds that have a lot of money and weight that can distort prices for
awhile...we saw it for yrs in CELG - ultimately it became a 300 timer. We saw it just last yr with ZIOP - it
quadrupled since Oct....We saw it after ACAD ran from $1.80 to $20 they knocked it down to $16 on
BS....now its $40...we saw it with AGIO after it ran from 20s to 50...now its 100....we saw it with Clinical data
they knocked it from 20 to $13 right before it was sold for $30+....I almost always make money on
overreaction......unde... - there are short hedge funds who have talked to this guy with vested interest in half
truths - CRMD was an IPO never a shell - its a total lie - many inaccuracies here - you know who is behind
this BS - they do the research and feed it to this guy and know enough to put the half truths in. He does not
even understand what QIDP is....Its BS. I added 20,000 shares and am looking for more.

if you're so convinced why don't you just put 100% of your zecco account into CRMD and we come back to
this in 18 months and see how things went?


I'm not going to "call you out" here as the research and my views speaks for itself. What we do know though
is regardless of what you claim, "someone" is selling this pos stock in huge volume for months now and yet all
we hear is unbridled optimism at any price? Something doesn't add up in my opinion.


if CRMD was so valuable why did Fresenius not even bid a measly $2m for it when they apparently had
repeated chances to do so?

I am not comparing CELG to CRMD....I am comparing the short hedge fund backed attacks on Seeking Alpha
and elsewhere in the EARLY days of CELG which were VERY much like this - hedge funds do enough do
diligence and feed the author half truths or things to misrepresent:


-like saying CRMD was a shell when that is a lie - it was an IPO. 
-like acting like the patent case was a loss when all the court did was toss it back to the EPO office that just
granted the patent less than 18 months ago to see if its valid. Huge win for CRMD - penned here as a loss?
Huh? 
- like talking about EU sales without mentioning the illegal sales of the inferior product stolen by former CRMD
consultants (who wrongly claim they are employees) and who signed very SPECIFIC CDA's that they would
not steal formuals or other IP - exactly what they did 
- mentioning LW as if he has been involved in the company since the turnaround and not mentioning that
Ellliot owns 25%+ of the company - mentioning LW huge losses with charts when he has not been involved
with CRMD for yrs and yrs and not mentioning Elliot's huge wins only their losses.

then recover mightedly....Shorts can't cover without running this up. Unfair compete trial is Thursday. Stay

I understand what this article is - been doing this a long time - already bought 20,000 shares - thanks for the
dip on utter BS. Seriously the amount of this article dedicated to LW is laughable...he was a legacy
shareholder who has had nothing to do with Cormedix for so long and only owns 2.5% of the stock. Yet his
picture and the other BS - has nothing to do with this really.  
Your lack of grasp of what QIDP is and why it is important - well it shows you were fed most of this BS from
others....we understand what this article is. I am loading on it. 
As for your BS about the European patent - clear distortion. The EPO that granted the patent about 18
months ago has had the court toss it back up to it - so the very patent office that granted the patent recently
as valid - is going to opine if the patent is valid - and that's a bad thing?!?!? HA HA


And then there is the Unfair compete hearing on Thursday - probably the reason for the timing of this article -
to allow some short covering before it .  
Cormedix challenge against Tauropharm owners - consultants who lied and said they were employees (they
weren't) and signed VERY SPECIFIC CDA's drafted to keep them from taking formulas and other proprietary
information and commercializing - EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. This is not Indonesia or Papua New
Guinea..........this is Germany. Expect a fair legal system.....Then after that we have the EPO - the VERY
AGENCY THAT GRANTED NEUTROLIN PATENT just over a year ago - charged with determining if that very
patent is valid....shorts think this is bad? Huh?!?!?!

There are many discussions about the patent and what it can do or if its valid or not? 
To me the real question is: Can it make Money? 
CRMD already has the right to sell in the EU and the Middle East.  
CRMD promotes that its product is superior to everything else that's already in the market. 
CRMD has 5 paid sales people in Europe. 
CRMD has everything going for it, but one thing, and that's $ales. 
During the last ER It only sold about $300 dollars a day in the entire EU and the Middle east, now break it down and
that comes to about $60.00 per sales person per day. 
The sales numbers are #### (you just fill in the blank as you like)


Why would any pharmaceutical company buy CRMD, when the product has been Test Marketed and it failed? 
Are the hospitals different in the USA Vs. Germany? Are there more catheter infections in the USA Vs. Germany? Will
the product be cheaper in the US Vs. Germany?  
Hope is a delightful asset to have in life.

Trickdog, Contributor
One more comment by me - not sure the situation in Europe, but it could be the limited staff, and the fact that
they are new to the market and due to the patent infringement occurring they were primarily focused on that,
while knowing that the USA market and/or a buyout by a large company, either European or US might be the
best direction for shareholder value. Just because you have situation A, does not mean you have situation B,
a scam. As a previously working pharmacist the last 2 decades, that would be my opinion on this. They even
announced that they could be working an auction type sale for interested parties not long ago. I guess the
other option would be to partner up with some interested party, if the interested company would rather partner
than a buyout, although the latter might not be so expensive.

Again distortion. Neutrolin has not sold in Europe as their is an INFERIOR version (less heparin) of the
product being sold for less entrenched in the market. Problem is the product is being sold illegally. 
Ignore the noise...look at the differentiate product the Fast Track and QIDP granted by FDA, the 10.5 yrs
exclusivity  
The 2 EU court cases - one awaiting EPO decision if CRMD patent is valid (Yes the VERY EPO that granted
this valid patent about a yr ago)...and the other unfair competition court case that will put a spot light on the
CDA's signed by the three Tauropharm criminals who worked as consultants for a predecessor company (all
rights now owned by Cormedix) and promised not to steal IP, formulas, info and commercialize....exactly what
they did. Smart shorts are covering - including possibly the ones who helped right this article - I will take Elliot
and Evercore over the Pump Stopper 100% of the time. I assure you Pump Stopper is backed by someone
feeding him info - he does all this expert research and does not even understand the importance of QIDP..ha

Author’s reply »  this is clearly false what you are saying.


nurses were mixing in their own heparin to Tauropharm's Taurolidine blend for years and putting in however
much hep they thought was ideal. This is why Tauropharm offers Taurolock with and without hep and with
multiple strenghts of hep. Everyone in the dialysis/catheter business knows that adding hep to a catheter lock
is in no way novel or new and has been done since before you were born. indeed nurses have been doing it
for years before CRMD even existed, how could that possibly be novel?


as you see in crmd's own comparisons anyway, heparin has no anti infection properties inherently, this is why
the standard infection protocol involves adding other chemicals. to pretend that adding hep to a catheter lock
influences the infection properties dramatically is obviously absurd to me.


if you look in the s1 ipo filings of crmd you will see crmd themselves compare their products to tauropharms
and also never mention any infringment.


the unfair competition stuff is obviously stupid and will clearly also fail. so far crmd has struck out completely
on their ridiculous lawsuits. if this was such a serious issue crmd would have pursued it at any point in the
past 15 YEARS that Tauropharm has been selling and, tellingly, they did not.


again I will ask: when will CRMD be sold and for what price? If I am right, you have mentioned this before and
yet now you are silent.

biotech has any of these red flags it is likely to also be a wipeout and you should pass, in my opinion.


best of luck.

Navinta LLC, a U.S.-based Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (“API”) developer, provides API manufacturing
(manufactured in India at an 
FDA-compliant facility) and a Drug Master File for CRMD003, pursuant to a supply agreement dated December 7,
2009 (the “Navinta Agreement”). 
The Navinta Agreement provides that Navinta supply taurolidine (the API for CRMD003) to the Company on an
exclusive worldwide basis in the field 
of the prevention and treatment of human infection and/or dialysis so long as the Company purchased a minimum of
$350,000 of product from Navinta 
by December 30, 2010, which the Company achieved, and following the Company’s first commercial sale of a product
incorporating taurolidine, 
purchases a minimum of $2,250,000 of product on an annual basis for five years. The Company did not purchase the
required amount in 2014 and as a 
result, lost its exclusive manufacturing rights. The Company is also required to make certain cash payments to
Navinta upon the achievement of certain 
sales-based milestones. The maximum aggregate amount of such payments, assuming achievement of all
milestones, is $1,975,000 over five years.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
On March 24, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Taurolidine Supply Agreement, dated December 7,
2009, as amended on December 6, 2014, between us and Navinta, LLC to extend the term of the Agreement
to March 31, 2016 and to lower the price per kilogram of product that we purchase from Navinta under the
Agreement. We also agreed to purchase a minimum amount of product from Navinta during 2015.


 
BEDMINSTER, N.J., April 9, 2015 -- CorMedix Inc. (NYSE MKT: CRMD), a global biopharmaceutical
company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment
of cardiac, renal and infectious diseases, today announced a significant new program aimed at enhancing
long term market competitiveness by substantially reducing the cost of goods of Neutrolin® Catheter Lock
Solution through a more efficient, custom synthesis of the active ingredient taurolidine.


CorMedix and [RC]2 Pharma Connect LLC, have reached an agreement which will provide CorMedix with a
cGMP API source able to produce needed volumes as CorMedix expands the sales of Neutrolin. [RC]2
assists companies like CorMedix in achieving more efficient ways of doing custom synthesis. [RC]2 has
extensive scientific background and experience in process development and the manufacture of APIs (active
pharmaceutical ingredients).


“This efficiency initiative, when fully implemented, is expected to provide us with sufficient cGMP API to meet
the needs for potential expanded uses, including U.S. market entry, which would significantly reduce the cost
of taurolidine, by up to 80 percent, thereby increasing the pharmaceutical manufacturing margins,” said
Randy Milby, Chief Executive Officer of CorMedix. “This is a significant opportunity as CorMedix intends to
expand the market potential of Neutrolin® in new geographic markets, including the U.S., and in additional
therapeutic indications. We believe this represents a multi-billion dollar global market opportunity. In addition,
we have several other volume related initiatives which are expected to reduce the total cost of goods by an
incremental 15 to 30 percent once fully implemented.”

multiple medical studies show Taurolidine lock is functionally identical to the currently established protocol and is
absolutely NOT "40% better!" than what is currently in use. In light of the above, CRMD's direct statement of "no
approved catheter lock solution" seems blatantly incorrect to me. If CRMD's Phase3 trial was properly constructed
and CRMD forced to compare their worthless Taurolidine solution against what doctorsactually use for catheter
infections, medical studies show there would be essentially no advantage and CRMD would fail."

Cormedix Ph 3 protocol was carefully reviewed and approved by the FDA/CDER/Anti-infective division who previously
mandated that Cormedix use the most up to date comparators and aseptic techniques to insure the trial is properly
controlled.


In the USA the FDA has approved the protocol with Heparin 1000u/ml as the agreed upon comparator in the official
protol. In the USA Citrate and other catheter lock solutions are not approved and therefore Heparin is the official
agreed upon comparator. There is no debate and its been approved by the FDA no matter how "Pump Stopper" tries
to distort


In other countries where the comparators may be different the NUMP data provides contrast to their rates of infection
reduction


Author wrote: 
"First of all Heparin has no antimicrobial or anti-infection prevention, so using that as the baseline is like comparing
Neutrolin to a placebo. With cancer trials we don't test oncology products against Skittles or water, so why does that
make sense here? Even more upsetting, putting trial patients at unnecessary risk of death when the opposing study
arm should be receiving industry standard infection protocols seems irresponsible and dangerous in my view."


Cormedix is using the latest standards, why would FDA approve Fast track and QIDP status if they were not. Just a
fear based article.

ACAD, AGIO and others after runs...there is enough info to make unsophisticated investors cower....but when
you did in the distortion and lies and emphasis on things like LR make it clear....After a cursory review - so
many of the points made were simply untrue and absurd, my counterpoints are:


1. CorMedix has never filed for bankruptcy, there would be public filing and there isn't


2. CorMedix was never a "shell company" controlled by Lindsay Rosenwald it was an IPO with a filed S1 on
record with the SEC


3. The company and its assets have had numerous documented offers when it was a private entity and its
untrue that they haven't


4. Heparin is the official comparator approved in the protocol by the FDA along with strict aseptic technique in
both arms There are no antibiotic catheter lock solutions approved in the U.S. and Citrate locks are not
approved in the U.S. these assertions continue to be baseless that there is some novel comparator available
that CorMedix is not employing in the study


5. Both gentamicin, tetracycline derivatives and other antibiotic catheter lock solutions just aren't approved
nor are they recommended for use in the U.S. By any competent authority This is simply not true Some
studies were done at places like Henry Ford hospital but neither FDA nor CDC has sanctioned the use of
these antibiotic catheter locks Neutrolin is an anti microbial and not an antibiotic and the reason the FDA has
granted Fast Track status and QIDP is for the precise reason that they want an anti microbial solution that
hasn't shown any resistance in humans as gentamicin and tetracycline derivatives have Coating catheters
with silver and other derivatives may help prevent catheter exit site infections but does not prevent CRBSIs or
intraluminal catheter infections


6. If you look at the company's CRMD's capitalization table Lindsay Rosenwald owns less than 2% of CRMD
and John Carris owns 0% and simply was a broker participating in a very small financing a long time ago This
is simply misinformation Neither Lindsay nor John Carris have any representation at all on the board or in
management. The fact that so much of this article was about these guys shows you what this article is. Its
purpose is to distort the truth, not discuss the positives of the company like QIDP and Fast Track and FDA
approved protocol and focus investors on one guy who has no involvement with company except a small
passive <2% stake and another who has no involvement. Ancient history with nothing to do with the
turnaround that has happened the last yr.


7. As a private company Tauropharm has vast outlets, distributors and bank accounts in the Middle East, ex
Bahrain, UAE etc as well as in Asia, Africa and South America and large amounts of revenue that dwarf the
amount cited in this piece likely escape their GmbH filings in Germany and require careful investigation


8. The outcome of both the patent and the unfair competition cases are far from a foregone conclusion but
CorMedix believes we have evidence that clearly demonstrates that they misappropriated both critical and
essential information and data from Biolink triggering German unfair competition laws as well as violate our
parents which although they believe are obvious we firmly maintain are novel and believes we can make a
very persuasive case they are. 
Let's allow the applicable courts to decide after hearing and reading all the evidence


Hope these truth points are helpful to counteract the large volume of baseless untruths presented in this piece

gary gelbfish MD
The author brings up some valid points regarding the amount of time it has taken Cormedix to execute, and highlights
some of their misadventures. However, given the complexity of bringing any drug to market and the company’s
complex past, this is to be somewhat expected. Besides, we need to focus on their current value and not the past. It is
my clear position that this company has significant value based on where they are right now including an FDA
approved phase III study, US patient protection and probable first to market with the Gain Act/QIDP. Europe, if they
win the lawsuits, will be a bonus. 
I speak with some insight as a Cormedix board member for several years and previous chairman of the board, and as
a Surgeon who implants these catheters in patients. I am in a position to know in detail the opportunity that the drug
presents. I know the pressing need for and the benefits of a catheter lock solution. Furthermore, I am happy to
disclose that I maintain considerable holdings since I left the board about a year ago.  
The author is disingenuous or misinformed, when he states that there are “many” better alternatives, or that Heparin
is NOT to a valid control solution. Here is why: 
Heparin IS the current standard and is used in virtually all catheters as a prophylactic lock solution. As he correctly
points out, heparin has NO antimicrobial activity, but that is the problem. It leads to 1-3 episodes of infection per 1000
days of catheter use. Nevertheless, it is currently the best we have. The other catheter solutions that he mentions in
the slides that he presents, ALL have limitations, ranging from catheter destruction (ethanol,) antimicrobial resistance
(all antibiotic types solutions,) cardiac toxicity (citrate in antimicrobial concentrations,) or did not pass FDA scrutiny.
This is responsible for the current state of affairs, where antibiotic lock solutions are essentially only used for
TREATMENT once infection has set in with often terrible financial and patient cost even if the infection is ultimately
cleared. Don’t we all want something that PREVENTS catheter infection? Bottom line is that there is NO FDA
APPROVED catheter lock solution in the US and, of course, there is no standard of care to use such a solution. 
Neutrolin (Taurolodine-Heparin-C... will likely change that as it has been shown by multiple European descriptive and
randomized studies to be highly effective and safe. When used as a catheter lock solution long term, it decreases the
incidence of infection by 70-95%, depending on the basline/background catheter infection rate. Furthermore, it has
none of the drawbacks of other proposed catheter lock solutions that I described above. Taurolidine is also highly non-
toxic to humans. Taurolidine has been shown to be safe when infused intravenously to patients in amounts that are
orders-of-magnitude greater than what could possibly inadvertently leak out of the catheter. 
It is for this reason that the FDA has granted it QIDP, Fast-Track and a direct Phase III study.  
Yes, after the bankruptcy of Biolink, Fresinius and others did not “grab it up” but please realize that no real studies
had been done at that time on this compound. Others were also busy chasing other options that did not pan out.
Catheters that are resistant to infection appears also to be a distant dream. 
Neutrolin is in a very different position today. Currently, there is so much data regarding Tourolidine-Citrate-He...
safety and effectiveness, that the approved phase III study is essentially de-risked. This data was generated in
Europe by those using the “knock-off” TauroPharm product. Additionally, with increasing medical and governmental
focus on the morbidity and cost of infectious complications, this compound will be in much greater demand than it was

10 years ago. So let us continue to focus on now, rather than what may have been true 10 years ago.  
Cormedix is not a pump and dump, nor is a Taurolidine based catheter lock solution just another compound in a
crowded field. Instead of mudslinging, we can thank Lindsey Rosenwald (who has nothing to do with the company at
this point,) for realizing its value and resurrecting this drug. In Europe it currently helps patients for indications such as
Hemodialysis catheters, Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) catheters, ICU catheters and for catheters/ports in both
pediatric and adult chemotherapy patients. It is highly likely to do so in the US. 
Regarding Tauropharm, the company formed by the chemists who manufactured the compound under contract for
Biolink…..and then began a startup side-business, once Biolink went into bankruptcy. The German courts will decide
their fate and we simply do not know how they will rule. What is important, however, is that they are by definition and
design a small “under the radar” type company, trying to exploit a potentially time-limited opportunity while they fight
their way in court. Their lack of great success, to the extent that we can determine this, is of little significance as it
relates to Cormedix. Their “published” numbers are of no value, as they are a private company with an ability and
great interest to hide their finances especially considering their exposure should they lose the lawsuits. The lawsuits
are based on their patent infringement and their violation of their original contract with Biolink, (which Cormedix is a
successor,) and are pending in the EU/Germany. Besides, as I stated above, Europe is gravy only. Cormedix’s
valuation is more than justified on the US market. 
Se here is where we stand. Cormedix is able to start a phase III study with money in the bank (considering their ATM,)
or instead partner or be sold to large pharma. 
The numbers a pretty simple. IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE, If you add the market of hemodialysis
catheters (80k + patients in the USA alone X 156 doses per catheter per year=12.5m doses) + TPN, Chemo and
some hospitalized intensive care unit (ICU) patients (at least 12.5m,) there is a potential of 25-40 million doses/year.
Even at 10-15 dollars a pop, this drug is at lease several hundred million dollar-a-year drug, once it gains traction. I
believe it will gain such traction, since the cost of Catheter Related Blood Stream Infection (CRBSI) is the billions of
dollars per year, as documented by multiple sources included the CDC. Indeed, this is one of the rare drugs that
decreases a major complication with significant morbidity and mortality and will save you money too, with a multiple
return on your drug outlay! 
Don’t be swayed by someone who is trying to pump this stock to unrealistic levels. Be as equally careful of someone
who wants you to dump it at current levels.

Author’s reply »  OHHHHHH! snap!


I guess this is just so wildly successful that NOBODY stepped up to partner or help when it was languishing
near bankruptcy recently in 2012? I guess this is just SO promising that the ONLY person to partner with was
the gun and tatoo guy expelled for fraud charges to avoid bankruptcy?


come on everyone...


you touts me. this is the final comment I will be wasting my time on. we'll reconvene in ~2 months when
CRMD "surprise!" announces they couldn't sell this business because (yet again) nobody thinks CRMD has
any value and the business is not worth acquiring and then maybe we can follow up in 12-18 months when
this is languishing back <$1 on its way to $0.0000 (or much lower)

To the Author, 
I believe that's the best approach as George Bernard Shaw said it best:


"Reasonable people adapt to the world. Unreasonable people persist in trying to adapt the world to
themselves. Therefore, all progress depends on unreasonable people." --


The progress of the stock price depends only on time and the unreasonable investors. Time will tell.

If Cormedix cannot sell the business at a reasonable price then they will proceed to do the study themselves.
They should have enough money to do so at this point. A good Clinical Research Organization (CRO) will do
this will little fanfare. Even if Cormedix needs a change in management, ultimately this product will succeed.


If all you have is two months to wait for breakthrough therapies and paradigm changes in clinical medicine,
then this stock is not for you. Realize that catheters have been in use for over 50 years and heparin has been
the only game in town. If Neutrolin passes FDA muster, and it is highly likely to do so, it will be the first real
advance in the US for a catheter lock solution for prophylaxis against the scourge of catheter infection.


Catheter infection currently costs at least ten of thousand lives a years (no typo) and billions in associated
health care expenditures.


This stock is for the informed and patient investor. Such an investor will have to ride out the disjointed bashing
and fluff that does not focus on the uniqueness, copious existing positive clinical data and the core value of
this product.

Author’s reply »  if they can't sell the business that is obviously an unmitigated disaster for longs since CRMD
has previously said they dont' have the infrastructure for longs and if nobody will step in to buy CRMD here
that is just yet another indication this whole thing is just another worthless failure, in my opinion. I think it's
clear that any other outcome than company sale and this stock will implode

Very compelling article and much food for thought, but in regard to your comment that insiders are selling the stock,
where do you see it? Which insiders? The most recent Form 4 filings from a couple of weeks ago was the usual
monthly $6200 purchases at market by the CEO, and a more recent insider market purchase of $19,240, by a
Director. Only two insiders have sold at market in the last two years. So where are you getting your information
regarding insider selling? Also, if the stock is such a fugazi, why hasn't the CEO unloaded his stock? Instead, he
continues to purchase at market.


29 Jun 2015, 08:09 PM


Andre LaPlume
OMG. Do you need glasses?


The interim CMO has sold 46,725 shares in the last two months. he continues to have options on 845,000
shares (all vested) and except for 75,000 shares all are at lower than the current price. Talk about dilution!


The $6,200 purchases by the CEO are window dressing. He also has almost ONE MILLION share options
outstanding, and more to come I am sure. Massive dilution given out by the board as if it's candy.


Again, I have never had a position, but I can read as well as anyone.

Gosh,


Perhaps the CSO is primarily paid in stock, lives in an expensive metropolitan area...such as NYC -- which he
does, and has mouths to feed, again which he does. He actually sold an such an OVERWHELMING number
of shares, 46,725; as you state. It certainly shivers me timbers!!


And, such dilution for his successful leadership in getting the PIII trial for hemodialysis approved, and getting
Fast Track and QIDP approved by the FDA. NOT such bad work for your alleged "PUMP and Dump"
scenario.

Yes, the Interim CMO and one Director have sold shares in the past month, but no other insider sales of note
for two or three years. And these two insiders sold big, but other Directors and the CEO hold. I don't call this
massive selling, when the majority of insiders are holding even on the way down. If it is such a pump and
dump, where was the dump by the CEO and other Directors and insiders when the stock went to $9, or a
dump on the way down? Are you saying they are holding shares until it goes to $1 or less and will then
sell??? How do they profit by holding onto their shares? Are they idiots and would rather sell the dilution at a
lower market price?

Author’s reply »  How could they possibly be allowed to make open market transactions in their own stock
with <2 months left in their process unless a sale process had failed? no way any company can go from zero
to acquiring another company in <2 months so it seems virtually certain their is no company sale coming. At
some point that will be formally announced and I would expect the stock to implode (more)

Or maybe one should buy those stocks on major dips--like CRMD now. 
Based on your view, one should probably be exclusively in CD's and not be on this site at all. With increased
risk there is increased reward.  
With CRMD the risk is small at this point given the facts about Neutrolin...despite what this author
misrepresents and I and others (even a former board member) have exposed.

Says the head Klown:


"7. As a private company Tauropharm has vast outlets, distributors and bank accounts in the Middle East, ex
Bahrain, UAE etc as well as in Asia, Africa and South America and large amounts of revenue that dwarf the
amount cited in this piece likely escape their GmbH filings in Germany and require careful investigation"

@kitstricker - Thanks for posting. Here's Dr. Gelbfish blasting the company's poor corporate governance (not
a surprise as scams never have good governance...that's why they are scams!)


"As the former board chairman, I strenuously disagreed with management’s failure to honor basic corporate
governance principles and protocols."


And here is Dr. Gelbfish stating that CRMD knowingly made false statements in a form 8k.


"Instead, CorMedix provided a defective Form 8-K on May 15 in which it falsely stated that I did not resign
because of a disagreement with CorMedix “on any matter relating to the registrant’s operations, policies or
procedures.” I cannot allow that false statement to go unchallenged."

catheter lock solution against Catheter Infection, which currently costs at least 10,000 lives and billions in
health care expenditures each year


2. CRMD has significant value based on where it is right now including an FDA-approved phase III study, US
patent protection and probable first-to-market with the Gain Act/QIDP.


3. Ultimately this product will succeed.


4. Dr. Gelbfish himself is maintaining his considerable holdings in CRMD.


5. Pump Stupper is disingenuous or misinformed in stating that there are “many” better alternatives, or that
Heparin is NOT to a valid control solution.

CRMD management have failed their shareholders by not informing them of the company's association with AMRN
but more importantly IMO took steps to hide this association.


The fact that they share office spaces, share consultants, and directors without proper disclosure could be perceived
as failure of fiduciary duty of the CRMD management.

Ikarus: Good point. I will make my opinions very clear.


Data regarding safety and effectiveness: A1+ almost “pristine” with European studies in multiple areas
(dialysis, cancer and TPN etc.)


Patent status: Tauropharm may yet be given what they deserve in the European courts. Regardless it is all
gravy as it relates to valuation. In the US we have reasonable patents and QIDP

Mediocre “Success” in Europe as it relates to us: NONE, since it is being used by many forward looking
doctors and it was always poorly promoted by a small deceptive company who stole it and needed to be
under the radar.


FDA Phase III: Great study design 
Likelihood of being sold: Who knows, but we should know soon. If suitors don’t offer a good price, I believe
the company should go it alone, with the appropriate management changes.


Finances of company: See latest financial and make your own judgement. My analysis is that they should
have plenty of money at this point to run their own studies if they are not sold.


Seeking alpha article. Deliberate attempt to bring the price down using dastardly methods and misinterpreting
data. This is a “hatchet job” if there ever was one. It paints the “bulls-eye” with copious yet spurious “data”
after it comes to the desired outcome of killing this stock. It is not a fair assessment of almost anything they
review.


Stock price in the near term: If stocks can be manipulated in the way the seeking alpha article attempts to,
then how can one ever know?  
Stock price in the long term: Depends on their ability to sell the company at a reasonable price and/or do the
study themselves. This is a management/execution challenge only. I have little doubt that many patients will
benefit from this drug in the future. A) It is simply too well documented by others (using the European
“knockoff,” over the past few years b) the need is great (terrible human and financial cost of catheter
infection,) and c) there is no real competitor on the horizon that I know of.


Who am I? I am Dr. Gary Gelbfish. If you are not sure, look me up, call my office and I will speak one-on -one
to anyone who would like to speak to me. This drug should be on the market because of it public health
benefits. I will do my best to help the process.


My relationship with the board: NONE at this point. I left a year ago. I had spent several years of high intensity
work and helped bring this compound to imminent FDA Phase III study approval. There was a lot of scraping
bottom during this period (as with any small biotech.) Right now the company is in a much better position;
except for having to deal with those who want to kill it.


My differences with the board: Read my letter referenced by others. It is very clear. I still have issues with the
composition of the board and some other residual issues but I don’t think that they are relevant regarding
company valuation now. Besides, such issues can usually be fixed in short order if shareholders really desire.


Summary: The drug is a great. That is the easy part. Execution and Wall street is hard.

Here is the bottom line with CRMD ..........


Neutrolin is the real deal. You can bash the company, you can bash the people involved with the company - heck I'm
invested and I'm PO'd at their management. But one thing where there is no debate is the data they have with
Neutrolin. They have ridiculously good data - BOTTOM LINE.


It is a product that is badly needed in an area that can save lives. It is not a matter of IF but a matter of WHEN the
FDA will approve it for commercialization. If you don't understand the science - then there is really nothing else to say.

CLDN actually received BT, but whatever. Like I said getting BT doesn't mean automatic commercialization,
but it means there is good data. See here's the thing with biotech - most of these candidates will fail clinical
trial and the odds go lower as you move up in phases.


HOWEVER, if you count the percentage of those that received BT that made it to market versus those without
BT designation, it is much much higher.


Does the team with the best record in sports automatically win the championship? Of course not. But if you
compare teams with good records versus 500 teams that barely make the playoffs, I bet more often than not,
the teams with good records win the whole enchalada.


So this idea of minimizing receiving BT or Fast Track or QIDP is just plain silly.

Or on the other hand, how many "QIDP" drug companies have been bought out in the last year? Is this
standard "buyout" rate for the biotech sphere, or are "QIDP" drug owning companies being acquired at a
higher rate than other biotechs? Care to give us these statistics: I already provided several examples in my
article: http://seekingalpha.co... for those that care to see.


CLDN has nothing to do with CRMD. CLDN was involved in cardiac gene therapy. This is an anti-microbial
solution that has already had extensive use in other countries. Trying to equate the two is ridiculous and
shows how shallow your understanding of the medical field is (or your continued attempts at deception).

@troubledog


EU approvals are not the same as in the USA. EU approvals do not require the same testing for efficacy, and
in many cases require no testing at all, only self-certification (so basically EU "approval" is a joke). TauroLock
is a "CE Marked" medical device (not a drug) in Europe, which is a very easy threshold to meet.

Author’s reply »  approval doesn't mean the product is financially viable. you have no idea what "approval"
means, the FDA or EU will allow anyone with something safe to run studies but that doesn't mean it's
necessarily more effective than what's on the market or its' a drug doctors/people want.


there are lots of drugs out there that even made it through phase3 only to see the company file bankruptcy
and wipe out shareholders completely because the product was worthless and financially unviable.


Tauro is defending themselves (imo) because the European courts are not nearly as favorable to frivolous
lawsuits as the US and, if someone were to break into your single-wide mobile home would you defend it? If it
was the only thing you had I'm sure you would even it's dirty and old

For any newbie investing in biotech CRMD is a good lesson for you. Here is what you guys need to understand:


Shorts LOVE Biotechs. Why? Simple - the odds are in their favor. More than 80% of clinical trials will fail. This is fact.
It is the nature of the beast.


But do you know what else Shorties love? Biotechs that have good data that in the end will be fine. Why? They make
money on it BOTH ways. CRMD is one of them.


Here's the strategy - data comes out, pps rockets up, shorts go to work. In between binary events such as release of
data, called no news or dead periods, shorts go to work and bring the pps down. Data comes out, pps rockets up
again, wait a few days, and then go to work once more. Wash, rinse, repeat. This goes on until very very good data
comes out and pps rockets up so much it pretty much nukes the shorts (see AGIO and BLUE).


In the case of CRMD, the only two events that will nuke the shorts is announcement of sale of company OR ph III
data. If you are long CRMD, you wait for these two events - IMHO. Cause that's what I'm doing. In teh meantime,
shorties can play all the game they want - it's all good. We're all in this to make money.

CRMD has been the subject of significant stock manipulation which may have involved naked short selling.


I am a CRMD shareholder and have been in contact with someone who has a successful career as a litigator against
some of the largest institutions and hedge funds who have engaged in illegal stock manipulation.


I would recommend shareholders become proactive and begin researching and documenting things of interest. It is
possible to collectively crowd source the collection of data which would be helpful moving forward. You can either sit
back passively or you can choose to respond in a meaningful and constructive way.

Pharma Investor - CRMD's stock is down 60% in only 3 months since you wrote bullishly on it. I'm sure you have
good intentions but honestly how or why should anyone trust you on this name??? You've already cost investors tons
of money.


No institutional investors really believe in this company (that's why theres no institutional ownership, besides Elliot)
and in fact institutions believe the stock is overvalued as evidenced by the large increase in shorts. Management's
background and track record are questionable at best and insiders aren't personally buying stock so what does that
tell you?


So institutional investors are bearish and on the bull side are you, some guy who goes by the name rob cos (whats

this so called "pump," even as the stock "corrects" more than 60% from its high. Why hasn't Milby dumped his

Not all scams are pump & dumps, sometimes execs just pay themselves and their cronies on the Board for
years and years. Always promising an active bold future to investors, while passively fleecing them in the
mundane present.


02 Jul 2015, 03:00 PM


Pharma Investor, Contributor
Odd, you admit it is not a pump and dump, but a way to enrich execs, yet then you will turn around and
criticize CRMD for having had 3 different CFO's or whatever in a short amount of time. Additionally, Milby just
recently took over the CEO position. You shorts need to get your story straight. Either it's a pump and dump
without a pump (only promotional materials the author could dig up were from 2010, not even relevant at this
time) and minor share selling by only 3 insiders (5% or less of holdings roughly) with CEO and Chairman of
the Board both adding and a former Chairman of the Board coming here indicating he continues to hold his
shares too despite past disagreements with current management or it is not any of what you claim. Claiming
that these guys are using this as a "jobs program" is very sad and the facts stipulate contrary. Much of the pay
for these individuals comes in the form of options/warrants, so if they don't sell them they aren't getting paid.
Additionally the CEO puts half his paycheck back into stock. Pretty sure there are easier ways a guy with his
credentials could make less than 150K per year while paying taxes on 300K. I challenge you to compare
Milby's salary with any number of other biotech CEO's. He probably falls in the lower percentiles in terms of
compensation.

Didn't say CRMD WASN'T a pump and dump, merely said that not ALL scams are pump & dumps. But good

Right, tell that to Cougar Biotechnology who was a LR company and sold for $1 billion to JNJ. Their drug is
getting better every year too...more and more sales/indications, already earned JNJ more than their purchase
price. 
How about ZIOP, a $1 billion + market cap, also a LR company at one point...now an RJ Kirk empire...tripled
in less than a year. Go tell RJ Kirk ZIOP is a scam because LR once had a role. 
Additionally, you do reallize that only 10% of drugs make it from phase 1 through approval. Sure, if you seed
10 companies, statistics are 9 will fail. Feel free to throw the baby out with the bathwater, but that's not going
to get you very far. I've no interest in LR, but to claim just because he was around 5+ years ago has no
bearing on whether Neutrolin is a valuable medication to the medical community/patients. Prove to me
Neutrolin is a not what the studies and doctors prove that it is and I'll join your crowd, till then I'll be confident
that a medication desperately needed to protect patients and actually save lives has significant intrinsic value
and this will soon be realized by the market or big pharma.

the FDA agreed comparator - lets take that lie - Cormedix Ph 3 protocol was carefully reviewed and approved
by the FDA/CDER/Anti-infective division who previously mandated that Cormedix use the most up to date
comparators and aseptic techniques to insure the trial is properly controlled.In the USA the FDA has
approved the protocol with Heparin 1000u/ml as the agreed upon comparator in the official protol. In the USA
Citrate and other catheter lock solutions are not approved and therefore Heparin is the official agreed upon
comparator. There is no debate and its been approved by the FDA no matter how "Pump Stopper" tries to
distort. In other countries where the comparators may be different the NUMP data provides contrast to their
rates of infection reduction - many other lies in this article. I am rather sure company will be contacting

I am trying to understand who is being fleeced here, as although I am down about 54% from going back into CRMD in
late March, I am playing with "house money" as I see it. I use insider purchases (Form 4 SEC filings) to alert me to a
stock, along with EMA crossovers, along with some examination of fundamentals and stock analysis. CRMD entered
my watchlist in mid 2014 due to consistent insider purchases. Reviewing my history more closely, I purchased the
stock on 12/24/14 when the 8D EMA crossed above the 21D EMA, sort of a Xmas present to myself. Bought at $1.55.
Decided to sell on 3/23/15 when the 8D EMA crossed below the 21D EMA, selling at $7.18. Told my scientist wife
when I took her to dinner that I was up about 363% in 3 months, thus the fancy dinner. When I told her I sold my
shares, she asked why didn't I sell only half, and keep the other half, as I had done with PCYC back in November
2012. She suggested I go back in as any product that can prevent or lessen the chance of infections in a hospital
setting should succeed some day. So on 3/26 I went back in and with 50% of my PROFIT only, I purchased at $7.63.
Yesterday CRMD closed at $3.54, a paper loss of 54% of my PROFIT. I don't feel like a fleeced investor at all. I am in

long and if the stock does end up worthless, I'm still ahead based on my prior substantial gain. And if I had not sold all
my holdings on 3/23 and only half, I would still be ahead, despite the steep decline the past quarter. Still encouraged
by consistent monthly purchases by CEO Milby. As I see it, I am playing with house money, and if the shares I still
hold became worthless this year and fell to zero, I would still be reporting a gain to the IRS on my CRMD holdings.

More misrepresentation of the facts? Even after being called out on your twisting and turning of facts to suit
your needs (did you forget to cut and paste only half of sentences again), you still have the gall to come here
and pull this?


The press release actually reads:  
"As part of its previously announced strategic transaction process, the Company has engaged in a robust
process with its financial advisor Evercore Partners. As a result, the Company announces that while the
Company moves forward with the announced clinical trial it expects to continue to pursue product
development and commercialization opportunities, rather than pursuing a possible sale of the company
today." 
http://bit.ly/1OlrSXb


So a sale is not currently part of the ongoing "process". Partnership opportunities are still being explored.

Can't draw efficacy conclusions? BWAHAHA! 30,000 cath days in many different centers, in different
countries, over multiple indications!! And 97% improvement vs the 40% the FDA has stated is needed for
approval -- and this in real-world setting, not a clinical trial. Usually efficacy data is HIGHER in a clinical trial
vs real-world monitoring. Phase III is shooting fish in a barrel... made of fish.
