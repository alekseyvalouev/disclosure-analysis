Dilution:	Allied	Irish	Banks	to	Issue	500	Billion	Shares	at	0.01	EUR

by:	Studioso	Research


On	01	July	2011,	Allied	Irish	Banks	(AIB)	announced	that	it	intends	to	raise	5	billion	EUR
in	new	capital	at	a	price	of	0.01	EUR	per	share.


That	announcement	seems	to	have	missed	the	attention	of	most	investors,	who	are
trading	AIB	shares	as	if	nothing	has	changed	–	the	stock	still	trades	above	0.13	EUR	per
share.	Given	the	intention	of	the	company	to	sell	500	billion	shares	at	0.01	EUR	per	share,
AIB	shares	have	significant	downside	potential	from	here.


My	target	prices	are	0.033	EUR	per	(Ireland	listed)	share,	and	0.49	USD	per	(New	York
listed)	ADR.	These	price	targets	represent	a	decline	of	over	75%	from	recent	prices	of
0.14	EUR	(Ireland	shares)	and	2.08	USD	(New	York	ADRs)	respectively.


Calculation	for	price	targets:


1.	Background	and	details	of	capital	raising	to	be	completed	by	end	of	July


Although	there	will	be	a	5	billion	EUR	capital	raising	at	0.01	EUR	per	share,	recently	there
have	been	some	developments	which	have	been	beneficial	to	AIB’s	capital	structure.


On	31	March	2011,	the	Central	Bank	of	Ireland	set	out	capital	raising	requirements	for
Irish	banks.	The	capital	requirement	for	AIB	is	13.2	billion	EUR,	comprised	of	11.9	billion
EUR	for	AIB	and	1.3	billion	for	EBS.


On	1	July	2011,	AIB	confirmed	that	the	acquisition	of	EBS	is	complete.


The	5	billion	EUR	capital	raising	is	less	than	half	of	the	total	13.2	billion	EUR	capital
requirement.	In	its	capital	raising	announcement	on	1	July,	AIB	announced	that	any	further
capital	requirement	not	met	by	bondholder	“burden	sharing”	would	be	provided	by	the
state	“for	no	consideration	and	accordingly	no	new	Ordinary	Shares	will	be	issued	by	AIB
to	the	State	in	return	for	the	Capital	Contribution.”


We	can	then	assume	that	the	entire	13.2	billion	EUR	capital	requirement	will	only	result	in
the	issuance	of	500	billion	shares,	given	that	the	remaining	capital	requirement	will	be	met
by	a	combination	of	“bondholder	burden	sharing”	and	“no	consideration”	capital	raising.

7/18/2019 Dilution: Allied Irish Banks to Issue 500 Billion Shares at 0.01 EUR - Allied Irish Banks, P.L.C. ADR (OTCMKTS:AIBYY) | Seeking Alpha

Therefore	the	capital	raising	will	take	place	at	an	effective	share	price	of	13.2	billion	EUR	/
500	billion	=	0.0264	EUR.	Although	this	is	less	than	3	EUR	cents	per	share,	it	is	much
more	favorable	than	the	0.01	EUR	price	paid	for	the	500	billion	shares.


AIB	has	approximately	12.245	billion	shares	outstanding


This	is	insignificant	compared	to	the	500	billion	shares	to	be	issued	under	the	capital-
raising	plan.


2.	Calculation	of	price	target	in	EUR	and	USD


Effective	share	price	of	capital	raising:	0.0264	EUR


Often	banks	that	undergo	substantial	recapitalisations	will	trade	at	a	20%	to	25%	premium
over	the	capital	raising	price.


Price	target	calculated	at	25%	premium	of	effective	capital	raising	price:


0.0264	*	1.25	=	0.033	EUR	price	target	for	Ireland	listed	shares.


Calculation	of	ADR	price	target:


There	are	10	Ireland-listed	shares	per	1	ADR.


10	*	0.033	=	0.33	EUR	per	ADR


Using	EUR/USD	of	1.4600


0.33	*	1.46	=	0.4818	USD	price	target	for	New	York	listed	ADRs.


Even	if	AIB	trades	at	a	premium	of	more	than	25%	above	the	effective	capital	raising
price,	it’s	hard	to	believe	that	the	stock	will	be	trading	close	to	current	levels	(0.14	EUR
and	2.08	USD)	for	much	longer.


After	all,	at	a	share	price	of	0.14	EUR,	the	market	capitalisation	of	the	bank	would	be
71.71	billion	EUR,	which	is	extremely	high	for	a	bank	that	is	getting	a	13.2	billion	EUR
bailout	from	the	government,	even	when	considering	the	positive	effect	of	gains	received
from	bondholder	“burden	sharing.”


Disclosure:	I	am	short	AIB.

The	capital	requirement	for	AIB	(including	EBS)	as	stipulated	by	the	Central	Bank	of	Ireland	is	13.2	billion	EUR.


On	1	July	2011,	AIB	announced	that	any	capital	requirement	(beyond	the	5	billion	EUR)	not	met	by	bondholder
“burden	sharing”	would	be	provided	by	the	state
“for	no	consideration	and	accordingly	no	new	Ordinary	Shares	will	be	issued	by	AIB	to	the	State	in	return	for	the
Capital	Contribution.”


Therefore	even	if	the	Irish	government	provides	an	additional	8.2	billion	EUR	in	capital,	they	will	not	receive	any
additional	shares.


Therefore	in	the	best	case	scenario	for	the	company,	it	will	receive	13.2	billion	EUR	in	capital,	but	"only"	distribute	500
billion	shares.


Therefore	instead	of	the	capital	raising	taking	place	at	0.01	EUR,	it	is	effectively	raising	capital	at	13.2	billion	/	500
billion	=	0.0264	EUR	per	share.
