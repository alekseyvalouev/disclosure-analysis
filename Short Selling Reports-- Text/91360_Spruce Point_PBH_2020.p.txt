Executive Summary

Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40%-60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


After conducting in-depth channel checks and a rigorous forensic review, Spruce Point has significant concerns about Prestige 
Consumer Healthcare (NYSE: PBH, “Prestige Brands”, or “the Company”), a roll-up of orphaned brand named, over-the-counter 
(OTC) healthcare products. Our research shows Prestige to be a challenged and overleveraged consumer healthcare business 
perceived to have steady growth and the ability to generate free cash flow to reduce debt. We believe Prestige will struggle to 


reduce its current level of debt as the business experiences further competitive pressures, and working capital and free cash flow 
strains intensify. As the shift to online purchases grow in the post-COVID-19 world, Prestige appears ill-positioned, and has 


significant exposure to traditional brick and mortar retailers. As the Company’s prior path to achieve growth through debt fueled 
acquisitions is no longer possible, Prestige’s organic growth has slowed, and financial strains have intensified. Management’s 


recent comments to focus on reducing debt may be a signal of cash flow drying up. Prestige continues to miss its organic growth 
targets and misallocates capital while receiving handsome compensation along the way. Prestige’s low-quality management team 


has consistently underdelivered on its promises, and it is time for the CEO and CFO to resign. We have serious concerns regarding 
current CFO and Chief Accounting Officer Christine Sacco and her team given their abysmal history at Boulder Brands, another 


consumer brands roll-up which collapsed 50% after our successful warning about accounting and financial strains. As a result of 
our investigation, we are calling on PBH’s audit committee to conduct a full investigation into its financial reporting and accounting 
practices. Prestige’s disclosures are worsening and its corporate governance lags peers. With consumption growth of 2%, lack of 


pricing power and increased competition, we view the Company’s 2-3% organic revenue growth guidance as unattainable. 
Combined with a rising cost structure, we believe PBH’s organic earnings will experience an unpreventable terminal decline.


Long-Term Secular Challenges And Competition From Private Label Brands, With Significant Brick And Mortar Retail Exposure
 We believe PBH’s orphaned brand-named products face significant competition in both price and product placement compared to store brands


• PBH brands appear to be struggling online due to lower product placement on retailers’ websites and inferior prices
 Nielsen data shows PBH’s price and volume sales are declining while private label brands are experiencing price and volume growth
 The 4 P’s of marketing suggest that PBH is at a clear disadvantage:


• Product: OTC consumer healthcare products with expired patents and high competition from comparable store brands
• Price: Not price competitive; store brands are priced at a significant discount. PBH brand are typically ~30-100% more expensive


• Despite evidence of increasing promotional provisioning, margin pressure and our conversations with former employees and industry 
experts, management continues to downplay any sort of pricing pressure


• Historically higher margins at smaller retailers have made up for pricing pressures from larger retailers.  However, as larger retailers 
continue to grow their share of sales, PBH may face increasingly more difficulty in maintaining current margins


• Place: Brands are intermingled with store brands or often found on lower shelves, while competitor products are found on premium, eye
level shelves. Heavy brick and mortar retail focus with 20%+ of sales from Walmart and at a clear disadvantage in online channels


• Promotion: Increased promotional spending as competition continues to intensify. Despite this push, organic growth continues to struggle
 Amazon’s move into pharmacy with its “Basic Care” branded products and acquisition of Pill Pack presents further challenges for PBH as 


traditional traffic shifts away from pharmacies and supermarkets to e-commerce channels

Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40% - 60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


Multiple Signs Of Financial Strain As Organic Revenue Is Flat, EBITDA Declines And Cash Flow Dynamics Worsen
 Organic revenue growth has compounded at 1% over the past 6 years and has continued to miss targets
 Red Flag: Under Sacco's leadership, PBH has made three unusual and stealth changes to the discussion of revenue from major brands: "net 


revenue", "revenue", "total revenue". We observe a similar stealth change in revenue disclosure made at Boulder Brands ahead of its stock 
collapsing


 We estimate organic EBITDA has declined each of the past 6 years
• Reported EBITDA only declined in the past 2 years due to the absence of an acquisition 


 Substantial delta between GAAP and non-GAAP financials from aggressive adjustments; non-GAAP EBITDA ignores the costs associated with 
acquisitions and divestitures even thought they are core to the Company’s strategy
• Company reports an aggressive “non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow” removing the impact of transaction and discretionary financing costs. 


Management wants every benefit of its actions, but none of the “cash” costs associated with its decisions
 Working capital under pressure as cash conversion cycle has exploded from 67 to 110 days since 2015


• Since 2018, DSOs are up from 48 to 57 days and DIOs are up from 94 to 109 days, while DPOs have only increased from 52 to 55
 PBH’s poor working capital management is a clear outlier compared with its peers


• DSO has grown significantly faster than peers; PBH is 1 of 2 companies with 4 consecutive years of DSOs increasing
• DIO and cash conversion cycle have increased faster than peers; PBH is the only company with multiple years of double-digit increases


 Receivables growth has significantly outpaced revenue growth on both an absolute and organic basis with the divergence accelerating since 
Christine Sacco became CFO


 Multiple signs of ballooning inventory levels as products are not selling-though to customers as obsolete inventory grows and inventory 
purchase obligations as a percentage of sales rises
• While management attributes this trend to customer destocking, there is evidence that this trend has slowed in calendar year 2019 as PBH’s 


main customers experience a minimal change in days inventory over the past year relative to declines in prior years
 Increases in promotional provisioning and consistent rise in advertising & promotional spend of its top brands shows efforts to fend off 


increasing competitive pressure
• Despite the rise in promotional spend, PBH struggles to achieve meaningful organic revenue growth


 Signs of declining efficiency as revenue and EBITDA per full-time-employee have declined over the past two years
 Red Flag: Potentially aggressive changes to depreciation assumptions have benefited earnings over the past 3 years


Continuously Misses Organic Growth Targets; We Believe The CEO & CFO Should Resign
 Since CEO Lombardi (June 2015) and CFO Sacco (September 2016) were appointed, PBH missed its organic revenue growth targets for 4 out 


of 5 years between 2015 – 2019, and was on pace to fall short in 2020 before the Q4 benefit due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
 Given management’s inability to achieve its #1 most important goal, organic growth, we believe it is appropriate for the CEO & CFO to resign
8


Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40% - 60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


Poor History Of M&A And Capital Allocation Has Resulted In A Weak Balance Sheet And The Need To Delever
 Debt fueled acquisitions has resulted in Net Debt/EBITDA of 4.7x and 87% of its balance sheet goodwill and intangibles; limited ability for more 


M&A and increasing focus on paying down debt before cash flow challenges intensify
 Transaction multiples have increased from ~7x EBTIDA to 10-12x over the past few deals; we believe recent multiples are understated due to 


the reported “synergy adjusted multiples” which are lower than the comparable multiples
 Recent deals have not benefited organic growth; management stated high single-digit growth for Fleet and DenTek at the time of the deals


• Evidence Fleet’s revenue growth declined after the deal; Y-o-Y change in revenue of 7.2%, 1.5%, (4.0%) for the first 3 quarters of 2018
• Management received a special "integration" bonus for the Fleet deal, and heavily promoted it with assurances of its success. Yet, PBH 


ended up taking an intangible impairment charge 
 FCF conversion is misleading for a roll-up given allocation of capital away from capital expenditures towards acquisitions


• Management touts its “best-in-class” FCF conversion but does not mention its “worst-in-class” organic growth as a result of underinvesting 
in the business; capex and R&D as a percentage of sales is among the lowest compared to its peers


 Recent change in capital allocation plan: PBH has shifted its focus from reducing debt and M&A to repurchasing its own shares
• Share repurchases at ~10-11x EBITDA, a 1-2x premium compared to the ~9x level it paid for the underlying business which is experiencing 


near zero organic growth and over levered


International Business Strains Mirror The U.S. While Management Overhypes International Growth Opportunities
 Management promotes international growth opportunities with a long-term growth target of 5%+


• International business represents ~10% of revenue; Australia accounts for >50% of international business
 In Australia, PBH’s largest international market, the Company is showing signs of strain as revenue growth is slowing and potentially being 


achieved by loosening customer terms, shown by ballooning accounts receivable growth
 Singapore and UK entities are showing similar signs of increased working capital needs and growing receivables


CFO Christine Sacco’s History At Boulder Brands, Another Consumer Product Focused Roll-Up Touting Growth That Ultimately 
Collapsed, Draws Many Parallels To PBH
 In February 2013, Prescience Point Research Group, Co-Founded by Spruce Point’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer Ben Axler, 


published a “Strong Sell” recommendation on Boulder Brands. Over the next 2 years shares fell over 50% before being acquired at a discount 
to the share price before the report
• PBH changed revenue disclosure for its major brands from “net” to “total” revenues, an identical change Boulder made in 2014 right before 


its shares collapsed. By making this change, we believe the Company is masking revenue loss
• Sacco received an SEC Comment Letter in 2015; we find many similarities between Boulder’s poor disclosure practices and PBH’s today


 After joining PBH, Sacco brought over three senior members of her team from Boulder and hired a new Director of IR with ties to Boulder
 Sacco previously worked in multiple positions at Alpharma (ALO), another Company with several accounting related problems
 We have concerns of PBH’s audit partner at PwC, due to her lack of experience auditing large public, consumer product companies
 Sacco overstates biography by representing herself as a CPA despite it being inactive
9


Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40% - 60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


We See A Terrible Risk / Reward Opportunity And Significant Downside To Current Share Price
 Spruce Point has a history of successfully exposing poorly positioned consumer focused companies before the market realizes fundamentals 


have changed, and the share price collapses (e.g. Boulder Brands (BDBD), Church & Dwight (CHD), WD-40 Company (WDFC), Weis Markets 
(WMK), iRobot Corp (IRBT)). We expect Prestige Brands to follow a similar course 


 Poor organic growth, lack of competitive advantage and eroding market share deserves a valuation multiple at a significant discount to peers
 Trades at a premium to the sum of its acquisitions (average deal multiple ~9x EBITDA), yet none of the brands have driven any top line growth
 PBH currently trades 24% below sell-side brokers’ consensus price target of $46 per share


• We believe it is overly optimistic to view PBH’s brands as market leaders which will be able to maintain share amid increasing competition 
from store brands, and as sales move towards online channels


• Management’s 2-3% long-run revenue growth target appears unattainable due to lack of pricing power and increased competition; combined 
with rising costs, PBH’s organic earnings may face an unpreventable terminal decline


• It is time for management to reset expectations lower and take additional asset impairments. PBH is likely using unrealistic 
expectations in valuing its goodwill and intangibles. Its auditor recently cited as a “Critical Audit Matter” - Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived 
Intangible Asset Impairment Assessments for Reporting Units and Brands of Certain Product Groups


 Spruce Point arrives at our price target by applying a multiple consistent with the reality that PBH is worth a discount to the sum of the multiples 
paid for its assets, which have demonstrated effectively zero growth, and are now under increased pressures. We project revenue to decline and 
margins to erode


Poor Corporate Governance And Weakening Financial Disclosure Practices Raise Several Red Flags
 Insiders own a measly 1.2% and have little at risk for leveraging PBH's balance sheet and saddling it with poor acquisitions
 Poor revenue disclosure: Does not break out the effect of change in prices and volumes, revenue by product (“Big 5” brands account for 50% of 


revenue) and impact of new product development
• Lack of new product disclosure despite management touting potential for new product development during the acquisition of Fleet
• SEC’s Comment Letter to B&G Foods sets precedent for Company’s to increase the level of revenue disclosure to include information 


material to investors
• Red Flag: Removal of principal customers and market share disclosure raises concerns as the Company is facing increased competition 


 We believe executive compensation is not tied to the Company’s key objectives; compensation is tied to sales and EBITDA. It should be 
compensated on organic sales growth and cash flow available to pay down debt
• Management has been paid handsomely with base salary increases and large bonuses despite missing organic growth targets in 4 out of the 


past 6 years and free cash flow guidance in 3 out of the past 6 years

PBH’s Recent History


Since the most recent acquisition of Fleet closed in 2017 PBH’s share price has underperformed. We believe PBH will 
continue to underperform as headwinds result in negative organic growth and declining margins.

Prestige Brands Is Not Recession Resistant

Linda Bolton Weiser
DA Davidson


November 2, 2017


“So if we were to fall into a recession, even though you’re kind of recession resistant, would that affect 
the lenders would think about lending to you?”


Spruce Point believes that even after arguably the worst of COVID-19 is behind us, management still has no visibility. 
Analysts baking in resiliency to PBH’s model fail to see the structural changes happening that, we believe, will prevent 


a recovery. We believe management’s inability to set long-term goals, regardless of the current economic 
environment, shows a complete lack of faith in the sustainability of their own business.


Based on a new addition to PBH’s 2020 Proxy Statement, we believe PBH is warning investors that the business is not recession
proof and is expecting to face challenges as a result of the macroeconomic environment


Analysts believe PBH is recession resistant. DA Davidson, with the highest price target on the street, stated so on an earnings call

“Sinking Ship”


Prestige Brands is described as a graveyard for dying brands on an employee review website. We believe this is an 
accurate depiction, and that management is taking aggressive actions to make it appear as if there is still life left in the 


portfolio.


Source: Glassdoor.com


“Prestige is not what you think of a pharma company. The 
company does not actually create and research new products -
it is a buyout firm that buys drug brands that are already past 
patent life and are competing with generics. The best hope is 
that customers are ignorant and continue paying premiums. 
Each of the company's products will eventually reach end of 
life. There is no growth beyond short term marketing gimmicks. 
Products and brands get bought to come here to die.”

Christine Sacco’s History At Boulder Brands


Prestige Brand’s current CFO was the former CFO of Boulder Brands, another consumer product focused roll-up 
touting growth, but ultimately collapsed upon disappointment and an unexpected impairment. Since becoming CFO, 


Christine Sacco has recruited multiple members of her Boulder team to Prestige. In our opinion, Prestige shares many 
of the same accounting and financial strains that foreshadowed Boulder's collapse.

Product Prices Are Not Competitive


Based on our research, PBH’s products are at a competitive disadvantage to store brands (e.g. CVS, Walgreens, 
Walmart’s Equate) based on pricing and product placement. Analyzing prices across many of the Company’s largest 
distribution channels, we believe the level of competition results in no pricing power for PBH. We found prices differ 
across retailers, with Walmart having the lowest prices across the board. Given Walmart is PBH’s largest customer 


and the choice for the most cost-conscious customer, we believe there is significant pressure on PBH’s prices. 
Historically, PBH would balance price pressure from big box customers by passing it onto smaller customers. As 


larger customers account for a greater percentage of PBH’s sales, this practice may no longer be able to offset the 
pressure and margins will decline.


“As far as the big box stores, the pricing for the past 10 years has been very flat. There has been some growth in certain 
segments, such as C stores where they have seen some growth on the pricing side. But for the big box stores, the price 
changes were very flat because of reason like allowances, they would give a lot of concessions.”


Former PBH
Employee


“I am worried about the supply chain disruption because sometimes they can absorb the price increase from the 
suppliers. but sometimes retailers cannot pass on the consumer. I would think that for the big box retailers, they’ll have a 
lot of price pressure. They will have to come up with some creative strategy to pass it on to other channel that are not as 
price elastic.”


“I don’t think they will have a lot of price increase they can pass on to the big box retailers because they will come up 
with private brands. They will grow and put intense pressure. The only way is to go after the smaller players.”


“The biggest risk is pricing pressure. I would say big pricing pressure from the retailers. Also, supply chain distribution is 
another risk. I would say price pressure will eat up their margin because they are over exposed to big box retailers.”

Stretched Accounts Receivable


We observe a significant discrepancy between PBH’s reported net revenue and accounts receivable growth. A 
meaningful divergence has occurred since Christine Sacco assumed the role of CFO, as receivables growth has 


accelerated while revenue growth slows. When revenue declined in 2014, receivables shrunk; however when revenue 
declined in 2019 and 2020, receivables continued to rise. This raises concerns as accounts receivable growth 


outpacing revenue growth is a classic sign of potential accounting shenanigans and is often cited as a top red flag to 
predict accounting scandals.(1,2)

Promotional Provisioning Rising


PBH’s financial disclosures show an increase in promotional provisioning (brand marketing, planograms, GPO fees, 
customer coupons) driven by growth in trade promotions. Additionally, there has been a consistent rise in the spend 
as a percentage of revenue for its top brands. Based on our conversion with a former PBH employee, the rise in the 


respective account balances may be indicative of the Company’s reaction to pricing pressure.

Acquisition Multiples Increasing


Dental 
Concepts


According to the Company’s disclosures, transaction multiples have increased from ~7x EBITDA to 10-12x over the 
past few deals. However, we believe recent multiples are understated due to the reported “synergy adjusted multiples” 


which are lower than the comparable multiple. PBH’s most recent acquisition of Fleet, while reported at 11.8x post-
synergy EBITDA, valued the business at 16.2x its pre-synergy amount. When the Fleet and DenTek deals were 


announced, management discussed high single-digit revenue growth, yet these acquisitions have resulted in limited 
organic growth for PBH. As organic growth has disappeared, PBH looks to have become reliant on generating growth 


through acquisitions, whatever the cost.

Christine Sacco’s History At Boulder Brands


Prestige Brand’s current CFO was the former CFO of Boulder Brands, another consumer product focused roll-up 
touting growth, but ultimately collapsed upon disappointment and an unexpected impairment. Since becoming CFO, 


Christine Sacco has recruited multiple members of her Boulder team to Prestige. In our opinion, Prestige shares many 
of the same accounting and financial strains that foreshadowed Boulder's collapse.

Boulder Brands’ Historical Financial Strain


Boulder Brands, under Sacco’s financial and accounting leadership, experienced similar financial strain leading up to 
its collapse as PBH faces today. Prior to its eventual acquisition, Boulder’s revenue and EBITDA were declining. 


Boulder’s working capital metrics deteriorated as DSOs, DIOs and cash conversion exploded, and inventory built up 
on the Company’s balance sheet. We believe PBH will likely suffer a similar fate.

A Sacco Staple Disclosure Change


After Sacco joined PBH, the Company changed its revenue disclosure of its major brands from “net revenues” to 
“total revenues” (gross revenues). In 2014, under Sacco’s leadership, Boulder Brands made a similar change to its 


description of revenue by large customers, switching from “net” sales to “gross” sales. Shortly thereafter, 
Boulder’s CEO resigned. We believe this is a major red flag for PBH and Sacco.

Sacco’s SEC Comment Letter


In July 2015, Christine Sacco received a Comment Letter from the SEC in reference to Boulder Brands’ disclosure 
practices. We believe there are similarities between the SEC’s comments to Boulder and current 


weak disclosure practices by PBH. We believe the SEC should investigate Prestige Brands’ disclosure practices.

relationships with multiple members of her team, who were all connected with Boulder Brands raises concerns.

Date Event Timeline
Nov 2002 Sacco appointed Senior Manager, Financial Reporting at Alpharma Inc. after Matt Farrell was appointed CFO in April 2002


Feb 2004
Subsequent to the date of this report, as part of the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's auditors communicated to the 
Company's management and Audit Committee two reportable conditions in the internal controls of the USHP division that, when viewed collectively, constitute a 
material weakness in the Company's internal controls. 


March 2004
The Company is presently being sued by the State of Massachusetts alleging fraud in connection with these state Medicaid programs and has been notified by several 
additional states that it is the subject of investigations related to the same subject matter.


May 2004
Alpharma amends SEC filings. Financial statements for 2003 are being restated to adjust inventory costs related to a vendor contract that was subject to an amendment 
and letter of intent in January 2003 ("2003 amendment"). The 2003 amendment included a provision that permitted the vendor, under certain circumstances, to 
retroactively invoice the company for inventory purchases since January 2003 at a higher price


Feb 2005
On February 16, 2005, Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") was notified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Company's independent registered public accounting 
firm, that PwC would decline to stand for re-election as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm at the Company's upcoming 2005 Annual Meeting 
of Stockholders


April 2005


In connection with its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, the Registrant identified the following internal 
control deficiencies:  Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy or the review and monitoring of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts 
affecting a number of accounts in the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals business, including revenues, accounts receivables and accrued expenses, were not maintained at 
December 31, 2004. Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax account balances, including the determination of deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities, income taxes payable, and income tax expense, were not maintained. In connection with the Registrant's disclosure in the Prior 8-K that it did not have 
effective controls over the determination of proper segment disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 


April 2005 


The Company has determined that it was not in compliance at December 31, 2004 and 2003 with certain debt covenants related to its 8 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011(the 
"Senior Notes") relating to the timely payments of liquidated damages due to its Senior Note holders and timely filing of certain certificates required in the covenants to 
the Senior Notes at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  As a result of these defaults, on April 28, 2005, the Company's management concluded that the previously issued 
financial statements for 2003 and 2004 should no longer be relied upon.  As a result of the defaults described above, the Company's has concluded that an additional 
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2004. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure the 
appropriate review and monitoring of its compliance with certain of its debt covenants at December 31, 2004.


Aug 2006 Matt Farrell resigns as CFO


Dec 2006

disclose any allegations underlying this request. The Company intends to cooperate with the Department


Jan 2008 Sacco, now a Vice President and Treasurer, left Alpharma for Smart Balance, Inc. (later known as Boulder Brands)

DOJ Settlement: The settlement resolves allegations that, between January 1, 2000 and December 29, 2008, Alpharma paid health care providers to induce them to 
promote or prescribe Kadian and made misrepresentations about the safety and efficacy of the drug, which is used to treat chronic moderate to severe pain.


Prior to Boulder, Sacco held multiple finance positions of increasing responsibility at Alpharma (NYSE: ALO) under 
then CFO Matt Farrell. While we acknowledge that some of ALO’s issue may have pre-dated her arrival, there is 


evidence the business got progressively worse under her tenure, culminating in a “non-reliance” on Alpharma’s 
financial statements, multiple restatements, material weaknesses, a DOJ Federal investigate and a covenant breach.

CFO’s Apparent Lack Of Attention To Detail


We question Christine Sacco’s attention to detail and oversight of Prestige Brand’s financial statements and controls. 
PBH lists Ms. Sacco as a CPA despite her license being “inactive.” This inconsistency looks to show a lack of 


attention to detail by PBH and its CFO.

Who Is Auditing Sacco And PBH?


We have concerns regarding PBH’s current Engagement Partner at PwC, Terri-Ann Dautzenberg. Terri became PBH’s 
audit partner in 2018, the first full fiscal year after Sacco became CFO. Based on her other listed current and prior 


clients, MPM Holdings/Momentive and Eagle Bulk Shipping, her expertise is closer aligned with industrial/chemical 
businesses and not PBH’s industry of consumer products/healthcare. Eagle Bulk is a penny stock that has gone 


through a bankruptcy and allegations of sanctions violations under Dautzenberg’s watch. MPM Holdings was majority 
owned by private equity investors. We question her experience auditing large public, consumer products companies 


and believe a new audit partner should be assigned to PBH.

Concerns Of International Auditors


We have concerns with PBH’s auditors in the United Kingdom (UK). PBH uses 2 different audit firms, neither the same 
as its U.S. auditor PwC who audits its Australian entity. Seymour Taylor began auditing Prestige Brands (UK) Limited 


after Ernst & Young resigned in 2012. In Spruce Point's experience, the same global audit firm is generally used to 
audit all international subsidiaries. In this case, it is unusual to see that PwC England and Singapore did not audit 


PBH's entities.

Prior to the Q4 benefit of COVID-19, as of Q3 2020, PBH was on pace to achieve flat organic growth for FY 2020. Over 


the past 4 years, PBH has not achieved its current 2-3% growth target. Years of poor organic growth have been 
overshowed by debt fueled acquisitions, which stalled in 2019.

Organic EBITDA Growth Declining


Since the $750 million acquisition of Insight Pharma in September 2014, we estimate organic EBITDA has been 
declining. Acquisitions may have been used to obscure declining profitability over this time period. Our analysis 


shows that organic EBITDA growth has declined for the past 6 years, however the company reported EBITDA growth 
experienced declines in only 2019 and 2020, ironically the two years without the impact of an acquisition.

Non-GAAP Adjustments Driven By 
Acquisition Related Costs


Over time, there has been a substantial delta between GAAP and non-GAAP net income and EPS. We believe it is not 
appropriate to ignore acquisition related costs while PBH was building its business. Now as the Company is 


disposing assets, management wants investors to again ignore these costs.

Egregious “Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” 
Adjustments


PBH reports “non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.” Spruce Point believes this is particularly egregious and aggressive, 
as the Company adds back integration and transition costs, therefore ignoring the costs of M&A but wanting to show 


investors all the benefits. In addition, the company adds back refinancing costs, which is also a non-standard and 
aggressive add back.

Cash Conversion Deteriorating


PBH’s working capital has been under pressure as days sales outstanding (DSO) and days inventory outstanding 
(DIO) have been increasing. As sales declined in 2019, DSO increased from 54 to 57 days. Cash conversion cycle (DSO 
+ DIO – DPO) has been rising since the acquisition of Fleet and since Sacco became CFO. This is further evidence of 


weakness in PBH’s business and another sign of strain on free cash flow.

Stretched Accounts Receivable


We observe a significant discrepancy between PBH’s reported net revenue and accounts receivable growth. A 
meaningful divergence has occurred since Christine Sacco assumed the role of CFO, as receivables growth has 


accelerated while revenue growth slows. When revenue declined in 2014, receivables shrunk; however when revenue 
declined in 2019 and 2020, receivables continued to rise. This raises concerns as accounts receivable growth 


outpacing revenue growth is a classic sign of potential accounting shenanigans and is often cited as a top red flag to 
predict accounting scandals.(1,2)

Overhyped Logistics Transition


Over the past year, PBH has spent $9.2 million for the transition to a new 3rd party logistics provider. Management 
wants investors to ignore the costs by removing them from adjusted financials, but likely plans to include the benefit 
from the transition. As of January 2020, half of revenues have been transferred, but management has still been unable 


to provide clear, quantifiable guidance to investors. 


Source: Company filings, Earnings Earnings call transcripts


“And then last question for me is, you said that you successfully transitioned to your third-party logistics
provider. Can you just remind us as to what your expected benefits will be from this new logistics provider?
And also, how should we think about the benefit from a gross margin perspective as well?”

“I'll take that. Yes. I'll take that one, Anthony. So the expected benefit, we talked about a 2- to 3-year payback 
period and about $10 million in onetime costs, and you see those stripped out in our fiscal '20. As Ron 
mentioned earlier, we largely completed this at year-end, but the expected timing of the cost savings really 
doesn't begin till the second half of fiscal '21 as you really get ramped in terms of efficiencies.”

“I'd like to comment on our upcoming transition around logistics, mentioned in today's press release. Following the divestiture of our Household 
Cleaning business, we performed an extensive analysis to determine the most optimal location and partner for our nationwide third-party 
distribution center to best service our retail partners. The result of this review was a decision to transition to a new third-party logistics provider 
and warehouse near Indianapolis with an expected completion in the spring of next year. We will provide additional information and updates 
during the year as we make progress on the transition. Chris will provide additional details on the financial aspects of this change as well.”

Service Provider XPO Sues Prestige For 
Withholding Payments


Source: Press


According to a lawsuit filed by XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO) in June 2020, PBH has failed to continue payments to XPO 
for warehousing and transportation services provided under a 2012 deal. According to XPO, PBH used the impending 


end of the contract in June 2020 as an opportunity to stop paying for services. PBH was transitioning away from 
XPO’s services as it planed to close the Missouri facility XPO operated. Spruce Point views the pending legal battle as 


a sign of PBH’s poor business practices to not uphold its end of the obligation and worst-case scenario is part of a 
last-ditch effort to preserve cash as revenue and cost pressure intensifies. We believe if this practice of withholding 


supplier payments becomes more prevalent, it could explain the increase in days payable outstanding.

Claims Of Customers Destocking


Source: Company filings, Earnings Earnings call transcripts, Spruce Point analysis


Management has attributed some of PBH’s recent struggles to customers destocking, the process of reducing the 
level of inventory held on retailers’ balance sheets. The combination of struggling retail sales and improved inventory 
management has resulted in greater inventory on PBH’s balance sheet. However, we believe this trend has not had a 


negative impact on the past year’s performance as customers’ inventory levels have remained relatively flat.

Promotional Provisioning Rising


PBH’s financial disclosures show an increase in promotional provisioning (brand marketing, planograms, GPO fees, 
customer coupons) driven by growth in trade promotions. Additionally, there has been a consistent rise in the spend 
as a percentage of revenue for its top brands. Based on our conversion with a former PBH employee, the rise in the 


respective account balances may be indicative of the Company’s reaction to pricing pressure.

Aggressive Depreciation Assumptions


In Spruce Point’s experience, when a Company changes its depreciation assumptions, it is a classic sign of financial 
stress. Following Christine Sacco’s appointment as CFO, PBH increased the length of its depreciation schedule for its 
fixed assets, lowering expenses and boosting earnings. Since the change, PBH has seen a decline in depreciation as 


a percentage of gross property, plant and equipment (PP&E).

than revenue. We believe this may be due to more customer friendly payment terms as PBH tries to meet its high 
international growth targets.

Analyzing Google Trends data over the past three years shows the interest in PBH’s brands are flat. Limited demand 
combined with limited opportunity for pricing power will result in sluggish revenue growth going forward and hinder 


PBH’s ability to achieve its targets.

Management In Denial Of Pricing Pressure


Despite evidence of increasing promotional provisioning, margin pressure and our conversations with former 
employees and industry experts, management has denied any sort of pricing pressure. Recent Nielsen data 


contradicts management’s statements on recent earnings calls.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call – May 9, 2019


Ron 
Lombardi “In terms of pricing, we continue to see fairly consistent pricing out there. So we're not necessarily being negatively impacted by that.”


Ron 
Lombardi


“Yes, it is consistent across the portfolio. Then again, one of the benefits of our portfolio and the needs-based nature of our products and our 
leadership #1 position in so many categories is we don't face those competitive pricing pressures that many other categories face. And we've 
talked about this a number of times over the years, so we have that benefit. In terms of promotion, again, if it's needs-based, promoting it 
doesn't cause people to buy the product, either you need it or you don't. So we're not seeing any change in our promotional efforts.


Raymond 
James 
Analyst


“In terms of your pricing, you mentioned earlier you're not really seeing much in the way of private-label encroachment, by private label, it 
sounds like, is losing share in your categories. But are you feeling any pricing pressure in your categories from retailers looking to drive traffic at 
all?


Ron 
Lombardi


“Not necessarily, Joe. And again, it's really a function of the fact that we have leading brands in categories. So we're not facing the same kind 
of pricing headwinds that you hear many other CPG companies talk about. So we're not necessarily realizing that.”


Q4 2018 Earnings Call – May 10, 2018


Q2 2020 Earnings Call – October 31, 2019


Ron 
Lombardi


“So pricing has essentially been flat for us. It's still a tough pricing environment. Although with 
leading -- many leading brands with a 50% share, we tend to be well positioned to put them in place 
if needed. So pricing, again, has tended to be pretty flat. In terms of market share versus private 
label, we continue to gain share and win, in general, as we have for a very long period of time.


Nielsen tracks an ~65%-70% of 
distribution. Recent Nielsen data 


contradicts management’s 
comments about stable pricing and 
gaining share versus to private label


William Blair 
Analyst


“I want to take another just a quick stab at the earlier question on the margins in OTC being down -- gross margin being down in the quarter. Is that a 
mix issue? Is there any kind of pricing pressure you're experiencing? Or is it really just kind of a stranded overhead kind of issue that lingers, I guess, 
because of the household divestiture? I would think the stranded overhead would be more of a G&A impact as opposed to a gross margin impact?”


William Blair 
Analyst


“Okay. Fairly consistent, can I interpret that as just kind of across the portfolio and aggregate uniform -- pretty uniform pricing across-the-board? And 
also if you could just comment, Ron, maybe on promotion intensity, but frequency in depth, any changes there in any of the channels?

Product Prices Are Not Competitive


Based on our research, PBH’s products are at a competitive disadvantage to store brands (e.g. CVS, Walgreens, 
Walmart’s Equate) based on pricing and product placement. Analyzing prices across many of the Company’s largest 
distribution channels, we believe the level of competition results in no pricing power for PBH. We found prices differ 
across retailers, with Walmart having the lowest prices across the board. Given Walmart is PBH’s largest customer 


and the choice for the most cost-conscious customer, we believe there is significant pressure on PBH’s prices. 
Historically, PBH would balance price pressure from big box customers by passing it onto smaller customers. As 


larger customers account for a greater percentage of PBH’s sales, this practice may no longer be able to offset the 
pressure and margins will decline.


“As far as the big box stores, the pricing for the past 10 years has been very flat. There has been some growth in certain 
segments, such as C stores where they have seen some growth on the pricing side. But for the big box stores, the price 
changes were very flat because of reason like allowances, they would give a lot of concessions.”


Former PBH
Employee


“I am worried about the supply chain disruption because sometimes they can absorb the price increase from the 
suppliers. but sometimes retailers cannot pass on the consumer. I would think that for the big box retailers, they’ll have a 
lot of price pressure. They will have to come up with some creative strategy to pass it on to other channel that are not as 
price elastic.”


“I don’t think they will have a lot of price increase they can pass on to the big box retailers because they will come up 
with private brands. They will grow and put intense pressure. The only way is to go after the smaller players.”


“The biggest risk is pricing pressure. I would say big pricing pressure from the retailers. Also, supply chain distribution is 
another risk. I would say price pressure will eat up their margin because they are over exposed to big box retailers.”

Competitive pricing leading

PBH paid $225 million for DenTek in 2016. While management was highly promotional of DenTek’s leading market 
position and “high single-digit” growth prospects, we believe it overpaid for a highly commoditized product.

Named Brands Are At A Disadvantage


Source: Spruce Point research


During our channel checks, we found stores that do not carry PBH’s product in favor of other options. In these 
scenarios for highly competitive products, the retailer typically only sells its generic store brand or one additional 


named brand (typically the market leader) on its shelves. 


CVS Sales Associate 
NY Store “Let me check… We only seem to carry the generic brand.”


Spruce Point “I cannot find any Dentex floss pick. Do you carry them?”


CVS Sales Associate 
NY Store “I believe we only carry the generic for that as well.”


Spruce Point “What about Clear Eyes?”


We found this CVS store no 
longer carries two of PBH’s

products and favors its

67


Recent Evidence of Losing Market Share?


During our channel checks, we found instances where PBH’s products have been removed from shelves and replaced 
with store brand alternatives. We believe this is a signal PBH is losing share within its competitive product markets. In 


2017, the Company removed its disclosure of individual product’s market share from the annual report, furthering 
concerns of this potential long-standing trend.

brands who can advertise results comparable to PBH’s higher priced offerings.

Poor Product Placement


Source: Spruce Point research


For highly competitive products such as cough drops, we found PBH’s “Luden’s” brand at a disadvantage to its 
competitors due to its poor shelf placement on the floor. We believe it is difficult for PBH to compete for shelf space 


when its rivals are owned by larger competitors (i.e. Halls’ parent company Mondelez).

Poor Placement For “Power Core” Brands:
Pain Relief

We find the same holds true for PBH’s pain relief products BC, Goody’s and Ecotrin. BC/Goody’s is one of PBH’s 
power core brands (top five brands representing ~50% of sales). The products are positioned close to the floor and 
away from the consumers eye level. We believe poor shelf positioning relative to cheaper alternatives is a factor in 


Ecotrin’s struggles and declining growth.

Distribution Channel Concentration


PBH’s top distribution channels and largest customers account for the bulk of the Company’s sales. As the reliance 
on these customers increases concentration risk, we believe there will be increased pressure on PBH’s prices. 


Additionally, many of the top customers produce their own private label brands which compete with PBH’s brands.

Walmart: Bigger Threat Than Believed To Be


Historically, when large customers such as Walmart, Target or Costco would pressure PBH’s prices, PBH would be 
able to transfer the “associated cost” to smaller retailers whose customers are less price sensitive. As larger 


customers continue to grow their share of PBH’s revenue, it may become more difficult for PBH to offset the pricing 
pressure by raising other customers’ pricing.


Former PBH
Employee


“Always. It's always a concern. Walmart, they're the big 800-pound gorilla. They are a big customer, so 
price is always a concern. So for a Walmart customer, it's very difficult to tell them the value [of named 
brand products]. For some mid tier stores we could give some concessions. So if price was not delivered, 
we'll come up with some other ways with volume rebates, IRC, coupons to drive those kinds of things to 
make up the margin.”


Spruce Point “As Walmart and other large retailers continue to grow share is that something that would worry you?”


“For Walmart there is a lot of price pressure there and there’s a lot of price pressure on off-invoice 
discounts. You can't get too creative with Walmart because you need them to help grow your top line. 
You can be creative with out mid-tier segments, but you can't be too creative with Walmart. Their 
expansion was hitting our margin with those big retailers.”

Walmart’s Equate


We have found numerous news sources that promote Walmart’s store brand Equate over brand name products. 
According to the FDA, generic drugs must have the same active ingredients, strength and dosage as the named 


brands. Compared to their generic peers such as Equate, CVS and Walgreens, we believe PBH’s products have no 
competitive advantage, limited barriers to entry and are at a disadvantage.


“By law, over the counter and generic drugs must be similar to their 
brand name counterparts," certified financial planner Reshell Smith told 
Business Insider. "The FDA says these drugs are required to have the 
same active ingredients, strength, and dosage as the brand 
name. Consumers can take comfort in using Equate brand 
medications as they tend to be regulated by law and the effects of the 
medication should be equal to the name brand.”


“To get a good deal on health and beauty products, consider Walmart's 
Equate brand. Equate over-the-counter medications, in particular, offer 
significant savings over brand-name equivalents, Greutman said.


For example, a bottle of Equate Ibuprofen with 500 tablets costs $6.98 
at Walmart. A bottle of Advil with half as many tablets -- 225 -- costs 
twice as much -- $13.99.


According to the Food and Drug Administration, generic drugs are 
required to have the same active ingredient, strength and dosage as the 
brand-name product. This means you won't get a lesser product -- just a 
more affordable one.”

Signs Of High Market Penetration


In 2016, when PBH removed its ACV(1) disclosure, the Company’s brands were showing signs of being heavily 
penetrated. ACV % implies the percentage of stores which sell the product. As ACV increases the opportunity for 


growth by offering products in additional stores decreases and organic growth is limited to growing same store sales. 
In 2016, there is evidence PBH struggled to increase market penetration, evident by relatively flat ACVs.


Percentage Of Products With ACV Greater Than…

Shift To E-Commerce


As traditional distribution channels became saturated, PBH began to sell direct to consumers (B2C) and through 
online distribution channels such as Amazon. Management as touted its growing success in e-commerce which 


accounts for 5% of sales. We find PBH will face similar struggles as retail. While this reduces the cost of a middleman, 
overall margins do not improve significantly due to new additional costs such as shipping and administrative. 


Although still a small percentage of sales, our research shows that PBH faces the same challenges with Amazon and 
online retail.


“In 2016 there was a big push to go to B to C, so to go with a third-party logistic company that will do the fulfillment. 
They started to diversify their channels because the traditional channels were kind of getting a little bit saturated. 
So they tried B2C, then health food premium stores, then direct selling to consumers.”


“For Amazon, our margins would be slightly better or the same. We don’t have the middleman, but when we sell direct to 
the consumer, the cost of the transaction goes a bit higher. For example, shipping. Shipping and returns you have to 
account for. The damage allowance from let's say Walmart is significantly lower than direct customers. Shipping and 
handling was an issue and that’s why we went with a third-party logistic company. We had more markets and newer 
channels, but then the administrative costs or the other costs, the hidden cost of shipping, handling and the logistics 
would rise a little bit. So we had to come up with creative ways to find of a cushion that gap.”


Former PBH
Employee


“During the fourth quarter, we continued to benefit from our ongoing investments and focus on ecommerce. Our e-
comm business grew over 60% in the quarter as we benefited from consumers shifting to online purchasing. Notably, our

March, which was consistent with our expectations for the year.”

Amazon is in the early stages of growing its “Basic Care” line of over-the-counter health products. Amazon already

Women’s healthcare represents 27% of PBH’s sales. We found that Amazon’s pricing for its “Basic Care” products is

Acquisition Multiples Increasing


Dental 
Concepts


According to the Company’s disclosures, transaction multiples have increased from ~7x EBITDA to 10-12x over the 
past few deals. However, we believe recent multiples are understated due to the reported “synergy adjusted multiples” 


which are lower than the comparable multiple. PBH’s most recent acquisition of Fleet, while reported at 11.8x post-
synergy EBITDA, valued the business at 16.2x its pre-synergy amount. When the Fleet and DenTek deals were 


announced, management discussed high single-digit revenue growth, yet these acquisitions have resulted in limited 
organic growth for PBH. As organic growth has disappeared, PBH looks to have become reliant on generating growth 


through acquisitions, whatever the cost.

Fleet Acquisition Investor Presentation – December 23, 2016


DenTek Acquisition Investor Presentation – November 23, 2015


Insight Pharma & Hydralyte Acquisitions Investor Presentation – April 25, 2014


We believe PBH’s disclosure of post-synergy multiples distorts the true purchase price of its acquisitions. By not 
disclosing its target’s EBITDA or pre-synergy multiple, PBH is able to justify overpaying for acquisitions. The 


Company’s lack of disclosures post-close has prevented investors from analyzing management’s execution of its 
stated promises.

Fleet: Overvalued, Deteriorating Asset


Our analysis shows evidence of Fleet’s revenue growth declining after the deal. Management continued to sell 
investors on optimistic growth forecasts and claimed everything was going as planned, while PBH ended up taking an 


impairment charge related to the Fleet acquisition. Spruce Point believes Fleet’s poor performance considering 
management’s special “integration bonus” raises questions of management’s interests.

“Lastly, as a reminder, last week marked the one-year anniversary of our Fleet ownership. The acquisition continues to 
perform in line with our expectations, and our focus has fully shifted towards our long-term brand-building strategy.”


Management sold investors on historical “high single digits” 
growth but we find evidence this growth may have quickly slowed 


after the acquisition


Christine 
Sacco
CFO


“Yes, so from a sales perspective for Fleet, US sales continue to be strong. It's the international sales, where we primarily 
work through a distributor business. And we see sales variability with distributor businesses from quarter to quarter on a 
regular basis. So again, that's why we take you back to the mid- to high-single-digit consumption trends for Fleet overall, 
which we feel comfortable with.”


Raymond 
James


“If you look at Fleet this quarter, you mentioned consumption still pretty strong: mid-single-digits plus. Fleet sales were 
down 1% in this quarter. They are up 3% year to date.”

The Need For M&A In A Competitive Market


PBH’s growth has been dependent on successful acquisitions. As the market for targets becomes more competitive, 
as evident with the Fleet deal, PBH has been required to pay higher premiums in competitive auctions. While PBH 


justifies its successful high bid to win the auction, we have found evidence of Fleet’s struggles after the deal.

Fleet Deal Call
December 23, 2016


“So what we understand is that the PE owner received a number of inbounds for Fleet and it led them to 
consider a process. So this was an auction and we believe that we were able to be successful in it because of, 
one, our meaningful ability to have a good cost of capital associated with financing the business and the 
meaningful synergies and cost savings that we have by folding the businesses into our operating structure.”

Limited Financial Flexibility


Moody’s rating action is based on the belief PBH will not complete a debt financed acquisition and revenue growth 
will remain flat to positive. This provides PBH with limited financial flexibility at a time when there is limited organic 
growth potential and no opportunity to acquire growth as they have in the past. Given our belief that revenue and 


earnings will begin to experience a terminal decline, we believe Moody’s rating does not reflect the most likely 
outcome.

No ability to acquire Minimal at best organic growth

Cash Flow Hype Creates Perverse Incentive 
To Overpay For Deals


PBH’s aggressive acquisition strategy assigns a significant portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible 
assets (G&I). For transactions identified as tax deductible for U.S. purposes, 89% of combined enterprise values have 
been ascribed to G&I. This creates incentives to overpay for deals to mark-up G&I to drive greater tax deductions. As 


deductibility is over 15 years, the benefits of PBH’s earliest acquisitions are beginning to roll off.

FCF Conversion Does Not Give The Entire 
Picture For Every Roll-Up


Management touts PBH’s “best-in-class free cash flow conversion,” however, we fell this is not a fair apples-to-apples 
comparison due to its roll-up strategy, under-investment in its brands, and ability to deduct substantial intangible 
expenses. According to PBH’s investor presentation, Prestige and Church & Dwight (CHD) have the highest FCF 
conversion among peers. Coincidently, CHD is another example of a Company that has been a serial acquiror to 


coverup declining organic growth. PBH’s capital investment as a percentage of sales is among the worst in its peer 
group, and even slightly worse than CHD.

Q4 2020 Call – May 8,2020 “Our cash generation and free cash flow conversion remain best-in-class.”


Management does not mention its “worst-in-class” organic growth as a result of underinvesting in its business
93


Underinvesting In Its Core Business


We believe PBH has underinvested in its existing brands and core business, relying on acquisitions for growth. While 
the Company's filings state its competitors have substantially greater research and development (R&D) resources, 


PBH is the only peer that does not disclose its R&D expense. We believe the combination of underspending on capital 
expenditures and R&D has benefited PBH’s historic cash flow but will result in increasing financial struggles as 


acquisitions stall.

Change In Capital Allocation Plan


We believe the change in the Company’s capital allocation plan signals two key points: 1) an abandonment of its prior 
priorities including first de-leveraging and then strategic M&A, and 2) a lack of acquisition opportunities. Two months 


after telling investors its priorities were paying down debt followed by M&A, the Company instituted a repurchase 
program. CFO Sacco stated on the call the program would not hinder the ability to delever and pursue future M&A, 


however leverage remains above its target level and no acquisitions have been completed. We believe the share 
repurchase program conflicted with promises to investors and was used as a method to boost EPS. The entire $50 


million authorization was used during following quarter and a $25 million program was imitated in March 2020.


Christine Sacco
CFO


Q4 2018 Call
May 10, 2018


“As we look to fiscal '19, we believe there is a unique opportunity to deliver value to our stakeholders beyond M&A by returning capital to 
shareholders through the announced $50 million share repurchase. We see this as an incremental way to add shareholder value without 
inhibiting our long-term ability to invest in brand building, delever and pursue future M&A opportunities.”

Overpaying For Its Own Shares


PBH is buying back its own shares at a 1-2x premium relative to the valuation it purchased the underlying businesses. 
Why would it make sense to pay a premium for the “PBH platform” which is experiencing zero organic growth? 


Spruce Point believe there should be no “platform” premium applied to PBH given the Company’s poor performance 
and prospects.

Additional Precedent From B&G Foods


B&G Foods, another roll-up of stagnant consumer brands, received two Comment Letters from the SEC regarding its 
revenue disclosures, in 2013 and 2017. The SEC’s interest in B&G’s disclosures sets a precedent for PBH to increase 


the level of its revenue disclosures for individual key brands and new product innovations. We find similarities 
between the SEC comments for B&G and PBH’s lacking financial disclosures. PBH’s segment breakdown does not 


include per brand or product revenue which we believe is material due to the varying growth prospects of individual 
brands and products and the large number of acquisition PBH has completed to grow its offerings.

Weak Revenue And Product Disclosures


PBH does not disclose the effect of pricing and volumes on revenue. We believe this is a key component to 
understanding the struggles of PBH’s business. In addition, the Company does not disclosure sales by product or 
brand for its “Big 5” brands which contribute to 50% of total sales. We are concerned by the lack of disclosure. As 
management mentions a tough pricing environment, we question the Company’s ability to be gaining market share 


with its premium price point and flat revenue growth.


“So pricing has essentially been flat for us. It's still a tough pricing environment. Although with leading -- many leading brands 
with a 50% share, we tend to be well positioned to put them in place if needed. So pricing, again, has tended to be pretty flat.”Ronald Lombardi

volumes, product mix and foreign currency effect. PBH’s filings do not disclose the impact of “volume” on revenues,

“Sure. We do track it. We track it by brand. But for us, in our categories, new products can be everything from -- we're doing a 
study to have new claims on a package, and we update our packaging to have those claims to better connect with consumers to 
actual new technologies like Compound W, Nitro freeze or Nix Ultra, where we actually have new formulas and new products 
over time. So we have a very broad definition of it. And we keep an eye on the velocity and how those individual SKUs are 
performing out there. We don't publicly talk about a freshness index or having a target of having 20% of our sales come from 
new products, but just track on a granular basis the improvements in performance of every SKU that we launch every single year, 
whether it's updated packaging or new technology. So we'd rather manage it on that level, Mitch, than in total with a much 
narrower definition.”

“They have an on-site R&D lab that can support new product development and launches. So we are excited about this not only for its 
ability to potentially manufacture Prestige products from our current portfolio but as well as having access to the R&D lab and the new 
product support for Prestige as well. So this is a perfect fit for what we have got going on here and it is a great segue for the future for us.”

existing portfolio to enhance innovation. What areas of your current portfolio do you think will benefit most from having that enhanced 
capability?”


Ronald 
Lombardi


“So at the Lynchburg facility they had a research and development and new product launch lab there and all that that entails. We don't 
have those in-house resources and we rely on third parties for those resources. So when I announced this to our organization yesterday, 
there was applause when we announce that we would have our first factory and that it came with an R&D lab. So that tells you the 
excitement that the organization has to finally have those in-house capabilities.
Right now those in-house capabilities are focused around the Fleet portfolio, so liquid products, the GI products, and a bit around the pastes 
and creams for the Boudreaux's Butt Paste. We would love to expand those resources over time to better match our total portfolio and 
what we might think about doing there at the factory.”

priorities of 1) long-term 2-3% organic growth and 2) cash generation. If debt reduction is a priority, management 


should be incentivized to maximize free cash flow available for debt repayment.

✘ Management has been paid bonuses despite 
falling short of organic growth guidance


✘ Management never issues EBITDA guidance but is 
compensated based on the metric


✔ Plan will reward objectives most important to 
shareholders: organic growth and debt reduction


✔ Management will benefit only when its 
performance is aligned with shareholders’ 
interests

Compensation Not Aligned With Strategic Objectives: 
Handsome Bonuses Despite Falling Short Of Organic 
Growth & FCF Estimates


Management has collected ~$35 million dollars in performance compensation(1), growing at an 11% CAGR vs. organic 
growth CAGR of ~1%, tied to revenue and EBITDA targets while PBH has missed organic growth estimates for 4 out of 
5 years and missed FCF guidance in 3 out of 5 years between 2015 – 2019. If PBH used organic revenue growth, which 
we view is a more appropriate measure of the Company’s performance, management would have not received its large 


bonuses over the lackluster period. 


1) Includes annual cash incentive compensation (total $10.7m) and stock awards (total $24.0m)
2) FY2020 beat was a result of strong Q4 due to COVID-19. As of Q3, Company was on pace to miss guidance


3) CAGR from 2015-2020

CEO’s “Key Achievements”


We believe management was over compensated due to an over representation of PBH’s key achievements. The 2020 
Proxy highlights a “flawless transition to a new more efficient, primary logistics and warehouse provider.” Our 


research challenges this statements as PBH is currently in a legal battle with a supplier related to the transition.

Transaction Bonus For Troubled Deals


PBH’s management received an “integration bonus” for its acquisition of Fleet, despite evidence that the acquired 
business underperformed. Spruce Point believes paying management a special bonus when its job, and Company 


strategy, is to roll-up and acquire companies is not in shareholders’ best interests. We recall that Boulder Brands paid 
a “special transaction bonus” in 2011. While we believe there are circumstances when a transaction related bonus 


could be beneficial, for a Company’s with the ongoing strategy of acquiring and integrating businesses and brands, a 
transaction bonus further pays management for doing its job and incentivizes potentially poor acquisitions.

Incentivizing Inorganic Growth


We find additional red flags in PBH’s executive compensation when analyzing the Company’s proxy statements. For 
2019 annual cash incentive compensation, the weighting was changed to favor sales and deprioritize margin growth. 
For PBH’s performance stock units (PSU), the proxy states it is based on “cumulative” adjusted EBITDA and sales. 


This cumulative metric gives management the benefit of inorganic growth.

Favorable Change To Compensation Target


PBH’s recent changes to its Executive Compensation program support the Company’s focus on growth over 
profitability and cash flow. We question this recent decision to change the weighting of its compensation targets as 


the Company has never achieved its organic growth targets. Based on PBH’s disclosed peer group, its revenue 
weighting of 50% is the only company above 35% and double the peer group median of 25%.

Insider Ownership Has Declined Since IPO


We are not surprised to see a significant decline of insider ownership since the IPO. We have found management’s 
interests are aligned with its compensation and achieving performance targets rather than long-term, sustained share 


price appreciation. PBH’s “private equity” like acquisition strategy appears built for an exit and not long-term 
sustained growth.

PBH’s Share Price Performance Appears 
Better By “Flattening The Curve”


As PBH’s share price performance has underperformed since 2016, the Company has constantly altered its peer group 
resulting in stronger relative performance. PBH’s filings states “The New Peer Group Index is a self-constructed peer 


group consisting of companies in the consumer products industry with comparable revenues and market 
capitalization”, yet one of its peers Akorn is a sub-$40 million penny stock. We believe this “self-constructed” group is 


tailored to have PBH best represented relative to its peers.

$ in mm, except per share amounts


Although Prestige Brands may appear cheap vs its peers on a P/E and EBITDA multiple basis, PBH trades at a 
premium to its operating cash flow and sales. Earnings and sales growth expectations are modest, but we believe still 


too overly optimistic. PBH is also weighed down by a heavy debt load, limiting any upside to shareholders. As a 
result, we believe it should trade at a discount to its better positioned peers.

Our research shows flat revenue and stable margins are optimistic at best. With consumption growth of 2%, lack of 
pricing power and increased competition, we view the company’s 2-3% revenue growth guidance as unattainable. 


Combined with a rising cost structure, we believe PBH’s organic earnings will experience an unpreventable terminal 
decline. We expect revenue to decline and margins to contract.


With organic revenue 
growth consistently 
disappointing and 


pressures intensifying, 
there is no basis to 


project revenue

Margin stability in the

We believe there is a disconnect between the analysts’ price targets and the reality of PBH’s prospects of limited to 
declining growth. These price targets are based on the best-case scenario of flat revenue and stable margins. As the 


stock market and economy have tumbled due to the impact of COVID-19, analysts have not revaluated their price 
targets for PBH, which remain at recent highs.

We believe Prestige is overvalued on both a revenue and EBITDA basis. Given Prestige's poor organic growth 
prospects, lack of competitive advantage, eroding market share, declining financial transparency, low quality 


management and governance practices, it is well justified for the Company to trade at a discount to its peers. PBH 
trades at a premium to the sum of its acquisitions (average deal multiple ~9x EBITDA), yet none of the brands have 


driven any top line organic growth.
