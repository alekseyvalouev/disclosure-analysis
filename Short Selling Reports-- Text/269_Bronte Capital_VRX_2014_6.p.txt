Valeant Part XIII: channeling Jeff Skilling - or trying to
reconstruct Valeant's balance sheet
There was a very famous conference call once where Highfields Capital analyst Richard Grubman
asked for a balance sheet with Enron's earnings statement. Jeff Skilling's response is a key part of the
Enron legend. 


Grubman: You’re the only financial institution that can’t produce a balance sheet
or cash flow statement with their earnings. 


Skilling: You…you…you. Well, uh…thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Asshole.


The "asshole" quip disappeared from the conference call transcript but everyone remembered it. 
 
Well today Valeant produced a earnings result with only cursory balance sheet data and no balance
sheet. Linked here is the SEC release.  And here is all they say about balance sheet.

Posted by John Hempton at 11:51 PM  


Net debt thus dropped $1327 million in the quarter. That looks pretty good. 
 
Except that they sold the Aesthetics business during the quarter. 
 
Slide 165 of this presentation (reproduced below) indicates net proceeds of $1240 million. 
 
Net of this they generated only $88 million of cash in the quarter. 
 
Which given they had $2 billion of sales and everyone thinks their cash margin is about 50 percent
does not seem to compute. 
 


 
 
 
We could of course work it out with a balance sheet and cash flow statement. It is probably all sweet
and innocent. 
 
So at the risk of being called an "asshole" please Mr Pearson will you give me a balance sheet and a
cash flow statement with your earnings?

John, 
 
They also closed on the acquisition of Precision Dermatology during the quarter (which
was a $475mm outlay). GAAP Cash Flow From Operations was $619mm. We don't yet
know what capex was, but if we average the last 2 quarters we get to an $86mm run-rate.
FCF therefore $530mm on a GAAP basis. Less the $475mm paid for Precision, is
$55mm. Which is close enough to your estimate of cash flow ($110mm) given we don't
know the exact capex run-rate yet, that it should not draw significant red flag.

John, 
 
Valeant historically does not include cash flow and balance sheet statements in their
press release, but they historically release their 10-Q on same-day or very shortly after
they report earnings so it is not a significant issue and I don't think it means they're hiding
anything. This quarter (and also last, but to a lesser extent) they moved forward their
earnings report date due to the dynamics surrounding the Allergan acquisition attempt.

John, You know Valeant closed their $500m acquisition of PreCision Dermatology on July
7? 
 
Between that and a little CAPEX, I think free cash flow and net debt are right where you'd
expect them to be based on the results.


October 21, 2014 at 2:34 AM

they closed PreCision acquisition this quarter as well, which had been announced earlier
in the year at a price of $475mm, so that should bridge a large portion of the gap. it's fair,
however, to ask for more b/s and cf/s information. not sure it's fair to compare VRX to
Enron or Pearson to Jeff Skilling. but time will tell.

It's Precision Dermatology...that's a CFFI outflow. That acquisition closed this most recent
quarter. They also did some other M&A...Chroma, etc. In total M&A consumed about
$720m, which is about the size of the issue you cite in change in net debt.

They just reported 620m in cash from ops..
