Spruce Point Is Short Planet Fitness (“PLNT”)
For the Following Reasons:


1
Questionable Business Strategy with Unachievable Revenue Goals: The fitness industry is intensely competitive, subjecting Planet to the 
whim of changing consumer preferences (yoga, boot camp, barre burn, adventure courses), potential technology disruption from 
wearables, and rife with examples of chains that over-expanded and failed (e.g. Bally Total Fitness, Curves, Town Sports). Planet Fitness 
(“Planet” or “PLNT”) tries to differentiate itself with a “no judgment” model for the casual fitness user that doesn’t want to be 
“gymtimidated,” at no-commitment, and a low entry price of $10/month (plus initiation fees). On average, its clubs have 6,500 members, 
and it needs both densely populated markets and members who won’t use its gyms to make its financial model work! Furthermore, we 
believe Planet’s revenue targets and growth rate are unrealistic and likely to disappoint current expectations. According to a former 
Planet insider, Planet appears to have created a pre-IPO fairytale goal that it can quadruple its club base from over 1,000 to 4,000 
locations, so unrealistic that it implies massive market share of approx. 40% and would severely cannibalize existing locations. With no 
barriers to entry, competitors have already replicated Planet’s look, pricing plan, and “specialty black card” model. We’ve identified over 
700 +comparable clubs with sub $20/month pricing that all are targeting Planet’s core customers.  With its competitive advantage 
disappearing, we fear Planet will be left to compete solely on price - a proven deflationary force in the fitness industry. Highlighting our 
concerns, we note Planet’s net income and operating cash flow barely grew in 2015 despite highlighting top line growth! Planet appears to 
be trying hard to keep members from cancelling, but in the process has aggravated customers resulting in scores of internet complaints
and Better Business Bureau citations. At the extreme, even a class action lawsuit from former club members has been filed claiming unfair 
cancellation terms! Is it a surprise that Planet doesn’t disclose member churn? Signs of financial strain are manifesting itself in 2015 from 
rapidly rising bad debt expense and Planet’s explosion in marketing and advertising costs to recruit new members. However, by our 
estimate, Planet’s National Advertising Fund recently operated at a deficit despite a hefty requirement that 2% and 7% of total gross 
monthly dues must be used for national and local advertising, respectively. 


2 Planet is Really A Glorified Gym Equipment Seller With Unsustainable Margins: Over 95% of Planet’s clubs are franchise-owned, but 
counter to appearances, equipment is more meaningful than appreciated at 43% of its sales and 26% of its EBITDA coming from high 
margin equipment sales to franchises. According to Planet’s 2015 Franchise Disclosure Document, it imposes guidelines that franchisees 
must purchase new equipment from its own entity, Planet Fitness Equipment LLC, and replace cardio and fitness equipment every 4 and 6 
years, respectively; however, not as reoccurring as it appears. With a total estimated upfront cost to own a new franchise at $728k - $3.7m, 
re-equipment costs at $320-$784k in years 4-6, and location remodeling costs of $75k - $550k every 4 years, Planet risks aggravating and 
receiving push back from the marginally profitable franchisees that may decide it is not worth the cost to re-equip. Planet has to walk a fine 
line in appeasing its current franchisees, which were responsible for opening 90% of new locations in 2015 and are expected to be a major 
driver of its ambitious growth plan! We believe that Planet has made concessions to sacrifice equipment margins in an effort to boost its 
effective royalty rate and scale it toward 5%. The reason for this is simple: Planet hopes to convince Wall St. analysts it should get a higher 
valuation for more royalty payments! Planet’s equipment margins have also benefitted from supplier rebates, but like other financial 
matters related to its equipment sales, Planet does not gives much disclosure into the exact impact

Spruce Point’s Base Case:
50% Downside to $8.00 / share


Valuation Disconnect and Downside Catalyst:  Valued at 5.5x 2017E sales and 13x 2017E EBITDA, Wall St. has embraced the Planet 
story with 11 analysts saying “Buy” and setting an avg. target of $20.20/sh (+25% upside). In setting lofty price targets, analysts’ 
stretch comparisons of Planet’s business to include “healthy living” comps (supermarkets e.g. Whole Foods), fast food operators 
(e.g. Chipotle), and clothing retailers (e.g. Michael Kors); absurd comparisons to industries with different business risks! Planet 
would like credit from investors for being a high value franchisor, but in our view, Planet’s valuation should be anchored toward gym 
equipment makers (given its dependence on equipment sales), and to other clubs such as Life Time fitness (recently privatized) and 
Town Sports. Analysts also fail to account for a hefty tax liability, which could saddle shareholders with debts of $1.40 -$7.20 / share! 
We apply a 7x -10x EBITDA multiple and arrive at a price target of $4.65 - $12.00 /sh ($8.00 at the midpoint, or ~50% downside). We 
estimate Planet’s private equity backer has a 3x return on its investment, and a big concentration of shares in its portfolio (est. 20%). 
As a result, we expect a large secondary to act as an overhang and downside catalyst


Accounting and Financial Disclosure: Planet IPO’ed in Aug 2015 under the Jobs Act, but in our opinion, should not be excused from a 
plethora of questionable issues including:  1) Its lack of transparency on key performance metrics (e.g. member churn) and scant 
disclosure of its performance targets post-IPO, 2) Potentially flawed / aggressive “gross” revenue accounting for equipment to 
bolster its top line revenue, 3) Aggressive definition of “active” members to include pre-sales, 4) Appearance of undisclosed deficit 
spending in Planet’s Advertising Fund, 5) Potential understatement of the tax benefits payable by $569m, 6) Potential 
misclassification of placement revenue tied to equipment in franchise revenue (and related costs placed in SG&A), and 7) Weak 
internal controls leading to the sentencing to prison of a Planet Fitness corporate systems manager in Jan 2016 who stole $1m 
through a fraudulent invoice scheme. 


4
Governance Concerns: Planet’s road to the pubic markets is not without controversy. For example, New Hampshire’s governor failed 
to disclose his ties to Planet both as an investor and Board member while lobbying state legislators for a tax change to benefit Planet. 
Nor did he reveal that he and former Cabletron Chief Financial Officer David Kirkpatrick (an SEC investigated individual) played a 
crucial role in the effort to take the company public three years ago. Planet was ultimately sold privately, a sale that resulted in two 
lawsuits, with one of them being the former CFO who accused Planet of securities fraud. Our closer evaluation of Planet’s 
governance reveals additional causes for concern. First, Planet’s FDD reveals a disclosure that one of its officers owns an indirect 
interest in its equipment vendor, Planet Fitness Equipment LLC. This disclosure is not made to investors in its SEC filings. Upon review 
of prior FDD documents, we also identified instances of related party steering of business to franchisee owned vendors (related 
parties), also not disclosed in SEC filings, and which could disadvantage shareholders and other franchisees. Investors should be 
cautioned that management is held accountable primarily to members of TSG Consumer, a private equity firm that controls 65% of 
the voting power and 4 of 8 Board seats. Planet provides no transparency on target metrics its management must achieve to attain 
cash bonuses; as a result, management can potentially fail to meet public guidance, and still get paid handsomely!

Capital and Debt Structure 


Planet IPO’ed at $16 in Aug 2014. Its aggressive leverage and high valuation leave no margin for error. Investing in 
the fitness industry involves significant risks, including changing consumer preferences and intense competition. 
Recent example of public company failures in the fitness industry include Bally Total Fitness and Town Sports Int’l


PLNT paid its owners a handsome $140m 
dividend pre-IPO by upsizing its term loan 
by $120m and using $20m of cash. It pays 
approx. 4.75% on the term loan. Moodys 
assigned PLNT a B1 rating noting its 
“aggressive financial policy” 


PLNT also has an unused $40m revolver 
expiring on 3/31/19 @ 4.75%


At Dec 31, 2015, the terms of PLNT’s senior 
secured credit facility require it maintain a 
leverage ratio of no more than 6.0x. The 
covenant will become more restrictive over 
time and  drop to 4.0x by 6/30/19

Summary of Fundamental 
Short Thesis
11


Planet Fitness: Bulls vs. Bears


Bull Case


Bear Case


• Differentiated Business Model
• Large Runway for Growth to 4,000 Clubs
• Membership Growth Opportunity to Sustain High Single Digit 


Comps Growth
• Predictable and Recurring Revenue and Cash Flow


• Differentiation Based Primarily On Price (potentially no longer the 
case), a Deflationary Force in the Fitness Industry


• No Barriers To Entry       Competition Rising Fast (700+ similar clubs)
• 4,000 Clubs Arbitrarily Chosen as a Large Figure to Sell a Fairytale 


Growth Story       Cannibalization Risk Makes 10% Revenue Growth 
Expectations Difficult


• Significant portion of business tied to success of re-equipment sales
• Member Churn (Not Disclosed), Appears To Be Rising
• Predictable Revenue and Cash Flow Not As Certain as Claimed Given 


Easy Cancellation Policy
• Street appears to be missing up to +$700m tax receivable liability 


which reduces equity value
12


Four Real Risks To The Bull Case


Increasing Competition With Limited Barriers To Entry: Planet is facing increased competition from both 
1) identical fitness concepts designed to match its value / price / no judgment member proposition, and 
2) increasing popularity of alternative fitness programs such as SoulCycle, Flywheel, Barre Workouts, 
CrossFit programs, adventure course, and boot camps. The fitness industry is highly fragmented, with 
many large players and seemingly deflationary pricing power. 


Signs of Rapid Member Attrition: Planet doesn’t disclose its membership churn, which we believe is very 
critical to evaluating its underlying performance. Planet advertises a “no commitment” policy which does not 
guarantee cash flow stability – as such, this does not warrant a premium valuation. This shifts the burden on 
Planet to flawlessly execute new club openings and high SSS performance to maintain its growth profile 
with minimum cancellation. We already see evidence of rising churn as bad debt expense is rising rapidly


Unrealistic Club Goals, Potential For Cannibalization: It took Planet 23 years to reach 1,000 current 
clubs, and it has guided investors towards a long-term target of 4,000 (with 1,000 currently under ADA). 
Planet will have to compete for prime locations in densely populated areas that can accommodate clubs 
upwards of 20,000 sqft, which can attract over 6,000 members per club. Planet’s expansion could reach 
a saturation point where new clubs cannibalize existing ones


Franchisees May Fight The Re-Model and Re-Equipment Requirements: Planet’s margins are 
abnormally high as a result of it earning 20%+ margins on equipment sales and 65%+ on placement 
revenues. These high margin revenue sources are not guaranteed. In our opinion, Planet places onerous 
terms on its franchisees by requiring them to replace cardio and fitness equipment every 4 and 6 years, 
respectively, at an estimated cost of $250 - $760k. This mandatory replacement is a requirement even if the 
equipment is perfectly fine and functional! Additionally, franchisees must maintain the fitness facility 
according to Planet’s standards, which may include substantial remodeling as frequently as every four years 
at a cost of $75k - $550k. Overall, added costs of $325k - $1.3m could place a financial strain on the 
marginally profitable and unprofitable clubs, forcing them to renegotiate with Planet.
13


Hot off the Press: New Risk Factors!


Financial forecasting may differ materially from actual results.


“Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting future events and results, our forecasted financial and 
operational results may differ materially from actual results. Discrepancies between forecasted and actual 
results could cause a decline in the price of our stock.”


Changes in the industry could place strains on our management, employees, information systems 
and internal controls, which may adversely impact our business.


“Changes in the industry affecting gym memberships and payment for gym memberships may place 
significant demands on our administrative, operational, financial and other resources or require us to obtain 
different or additional resources. Any failure to manage such changes effectively could seriously harm our 
business. To be successful, we will need to continue to implement management information systems and 
improve our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls in order to adapt 
quickly to such changes. These changes may be time-consuming and expensive, increase management 
responsibilities and divert management attention, and we may not realize a return on our investment in 
these changes."


Planet just released its first 10-K on March 4th 2016 after FY 2015 earnings. There are notable additions to 
the risk factors from their prospectus filing in August 2015. 


Notably, Planet’s risk factors appear contrary to both the Company’s and Analysts’ views on its model


Planet has been issuing public guidance since Q2’2015. Why is it now just adding this risk factor?


Isn’t it unusual that Planet is finally acknowledging changes in its industry at the same time it is 
warning that its outlook could be materially different from actual results?
Loss of Competitive Advantage and 
Unrealistic Growth Expectations

Planet Fitness Pitching a Fairytale Story 
of Reaching 4,000 Clubs


“The company has stated in its S-1 filing that it can quadruple its store count to over 4,000 stores in the U.S. itself. 
That number is higher than any number I have heard before. There is no doubt in my mind as well as some 
franchisees that encroachment issues will develop such as lower membership dues collection per club on the way to 
4,000 locations”


Planet Fitness Clubs Currently Total 1,121


Source: Planet Fitness website


A key part of Planet’s pitch to investors is that it can grow to 4,000 clubs from just over 1,100 today. 
According to a quote from a former Executive Director of the Planet Fitness Independent Franchisee 
Association (PFIFA), the 4,000 club target appears to be newly created not long prior to going public.

The Absurdity of Planet’s Club Goals Simply 
Illustrated


Assuming Planet can add 200 clubs/yr for the next 10 years, and industry membership grows 2-3% p.a., 
Planet will dominate the fitness industry with 39% market share....yeah right!


Planet cites the following statistics in its prospectus and 10-K:


• According to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (“IHRSA”), the United States health club industry generated 
approximately $24.2 billion in 2014. The industry is highly fragmented, with 34,460 clubs across the United States serving 
approximately 54 million members, according to IHRSA. 


• Over the next five years, industry sources project that U.S. health club industry revenues will grow at an annualized rate of
approximately 3%, primarily attributed to an increase in discretionary spending coupled with continued consumer awareness and public 
initiatives on the health benefits of exercise. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends, and our impressive growth 
reinforces our distinct approach to fitness and broad demographic appeal.


• Let’s assume the following to see what Planet’s market share would look like in 10 years:


• Assume that approximately 75% of the total 54 million members (40 million members) are actually in Planet’s target market.1


Let’s also assume the membership base grows at 3% for the next 5 years and 2% thereafter. That works out to approximately 52 
million total members by 2026 (in 10 years)


• Furthermore, let’s assume Planet adds 200 clubs per annum over the next 10 years.  It’s club count will be approximately 3,100


• It’s current average members per club is approx. 6,500. This suggests that Planet’s membership count would grow to 20.1m


• If Planet could in fact grow to 20.1m members, it would have approximately 39% total market share....we doubt it! 


1) Per Credit Suisse’s survey approximately 44% of those surveyed would pay under $20/month and 27% would pay $21-50/month (71% between the two categories). We 
assume 75% for simplicity sake.

Planet’s Target Market Could Be Shrinking As 
Competition Encroaches


Planet has suggested a 4,000 location goal, and is currently at 1,124 as of Dec 31, 2015. However, there 
are already at least over 700 similar-styled no-judgment sub $20.00 / month gyms. Planet suggests it is 
only at 25% market penetration, but it could already be over 40% if competitors are included. Many are 


growing faster than Planet!

Stretching For Growth In Suboptimal 
Locations Already Evident


Planet Fitness planned for Regency Mall Gym will replace about nine existing stores inside shopping center
Feb 16, 2016


Planet Fitness will enter the Racine market with an 18,000-square-foot location in the struggling Regency Mall.


The gym will be located on the southwest end of the mall, 5502 Durand Ave., between the Burlington Coat Factory store and h.h.gregg. 
Rendering of the Planet Fitness planned for Regency Mall in Racine. Rendering of the Planet Fitness planned for Regency Mall in Racine. Planet 
Fitness will take up about nine existing store spaces, only two of which are active stores right now, said Tim Connolly, project director of 
Cleveland-based K2M Design.


Connolly, whose firm is working on behalf of Regency Mall owner, CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., said construction on the gym’s shell will 
begin in a few weeks. Planet Fitness will then take over and outfit the building, which will take another three to four months, Connolly said.  
Planet Fitness, which will be open 24 hours a day, will not have an exterior entrance, but a security gate will be installed to block off the rest of 
the mall concourse when the mall is closed, Connolly said.  The Racine plan commission approved the mall’s conditional use plan to allow the 
gym inside of the mall last week.


Built in 1981, the 810,337-square-foot Regency Mall has struggled for several years to retain quality tenants. Sears closed its 89,119-square-
foot store in 2014, and JCPenney did the same the following year, closing its 149,196-square-foot store. The mall has been able to hold onto 
its other two anchor stores, the 80,000-square-foot Burlington Coat Factory store and a 105,869-square-foot Boston Store. Ross Dress for Less 
and Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores are also expected to open at the mall in spring.


Connolly believes the addition of Planet Fitness will bring more traffic to the mall, which could lead to more tenants and more retail activity for 
the existing tenants. Planet Fitness has 24 locations in Wisconsin, including seven in the Milwaukee area. K2M Design is working on a similar 
Planet Fitness proposal inside of East Towne Mall in Madison, which has not yet been approved.

Technology Giving Consumers 
Exponentially More Fitness Options


New companies such as Class Pass offer fitness users significantly more options and flexibility to 
tailor a fitness routine. While more expensive at approximately $100/month, Class Pass gives members 


access to numerous crossfit, yoga, barre burn, spinning, and yoga classes

Class Pass is rapidly expanding to cities across the U.S. and abroad. To illustrate its appeal and the 
challenges it could present to Planet Fitness, the map below shows the number of fitness classes available 
to its members in Manhattan. Planet Fitness currently has just 10 clubs in Manhattan....

Financial Strains Appear To Be 
Playing Out Already....


Despite These “Impressive” Results, We Observe That Net Income and Cash Flow grew by just 2%!


Digging beneath the surface of Planet’s 2015 results shows signs of weakness in its financial model. Net Income to 
shareholders decreased, and cash from operations was up moderately. 


Planet and its analysts were quick to highlight seemingly impressive results for 2015 including: 
1. 18% total revenue growth 
2. System-wide same store sales of 7.7% 
3. EBITDA growth of 22.8% 
4. Club growth of 23.5% from the addition of 209 new clubs
5. 20% “active” member growth to 7.3 million from 6.1 million

Case Study: Failure of Town Sports (CLUB)


Town Sports operates company owned fitness clubs in densely populated metropolitan markets like New York, 
Boston, Philadelphia and D.C. Its financial performance has deteriorated in recent years as a result of changing 


fitness trends and lower priced gym options forcing comparable club revenue declines. Its EBIT margins peaked 
shortly after going public in the 12% range.

In our opinion, Planet’s operating margins are unsustainably higher than even CLUB’s peak margins as a result of its focus on 
equipment sales and associated placement revenues for delivering and setting up the equipment. We estimate it earns 20% margins 
on the equipment and 65% on placement revenues. We believe the greatest risk facing Planet is that franchisees push back on the 
requirement to replace fitness and cardio equipment. This is especially true for the marginally profitable franchise operators that face 
$0.3 - $1.3 million of costs in years 4 – 6.

Planet Changes Key Performance Metrics 
Three Months Post IPO


Source: 10Q filing Q3’2015, Nov 13, 2015


Pre-IPO


How We Assess The Performance of Our Business


“In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. 
The key measures for determining how our business is performing include total monthly dues and annual fees 
from members (which we refer to as system-wide sales), number of new store openings, same store sales for 
both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores, net member growth per store, average royalty fee 
percentages for franchisee-owned stores, monthly PF Black Card membership penetration percentage, 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment EBITDA.”


Post-IPO


How We Assess the Performance of Our Business


“In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. 
The key measures for determining how our business is performing include the number of new store openings, 
same store sales for both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned stores, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, 
Segment EBITDA, pro forma adjusted net income, and pro forma adjusted net income per diluted share.”


Within 3 months of going public, Planet quickly changed the language in its 10-Q about how it evaluates its 
business. Differences are underlined in red. Most of what it says it tracks, it does not disclose to investors on a

In Our Opinion, Planet’s Justification For Not 
Disclosing Churn Is Laughable


SEC Comment Letter, April 21, 2015


Q. 10: “Please disclose the membership renewal or retention rates at your company stores and your franchisees. We note the 
statement that you believe that regularly refreshing equipment enhances renewal rates from existing members. We also note the
statement on page 91 that raving members are the pillars of your success.”


Q. 30:   “Please include a discussion of your corporate-owned stores membership churn rate. In this regard, please discuss your 
membership renewal rate and your termination or forfeiture rate of memberships for each year. Clearly explain whether your 
membership growth and the increase in corporate-owned revenues are a result of membership retainment through renewals, new 
members joining existing locations, or by the expansion of corporate-owned stores in new geographic locations.“


SEC Response Letter, May 20, 2015


“We have reviewed your response to our prior comment 30. Please include disclosure of how you determine net “new” 
membership growth per store as part of your assessment of net member growth per store, in addition to also disclosing why you
do not consider corporate-owned membership or franchisee-owned membership churn rate to be a factor in your growth. Also, 
please disclose the last sentence of your response whereby you attribute your membership growth to the growth of the franchisee-
owned store base.”


In Our Opinion, Planet’s Response Per Its Prospectus Lacks Substance. Disclosing Churn, Does Not Impact Member Experience


“We seek to make it simple for members to join, whether online or in-store, and, while some memberships require a cancellation fee, 
we offer, and require our franchisees to offer, a non-committal membership option. This approach to memberships is part of our 
commitment to appeal to new and occasional gym users. As a result, we do not measure membership attrition as an operating metric
in assessing our performance”


Source: First SEC Comment Letter and Second SEC Comment Letter.  Note: The SEC has not released the response letters provided from Planet Fitness pertaining to these comment letters cited. 


Planet Fitness doesn’t disclose membership churn, and talked its way out of disclosing this information at the 
request of the SEC. In our opinion, since its contracts are non-committal and can be cancelled at any time, it is 


very material to know how frequently members are exercising this cancellation option.

Contractual Advertising Commitments (inc. NAF)


Pre-IPO Post-IPO


$ in millions


The fitness industry depends heavily on recruiting and retaining members through extensive marketing and 
advertising. Planet franchisees are required to contribute 2% of monthly membership dues to its National Advertising 


Fund (“NAF”) and 7% to local advertising. Planet does not disclose marketing costs on a quarterly basis or on its 
investor conference calls.  Clues from Planet’s 10-K and prospectus filings suggest its has dramatically increased its 
marketing and advertising expenditures with membership growth stagnating sequentially in 2015. We are skeptical 


that advertising alone will be able to save Planet from its growth issues.


Source: Planet SEC filings


In its June 2015 prospectus (p. 4), Planet makes the following statements 
about its marketing and advertising, imply $33m/yr of spending: 


“Planet and its franchises have spent an estimated $150 million since 2011 
on marketing to drive consumer brand awareness”


And later in its recent 10-K (p. 5), a revelation that marketing costs have 
exploded by at least $75 million ($225m - $150m) 


“...us and our franchisees have spent over $225m since 2011 on marketing 
to drive brand awareness” 


In its footnotes discussing “Contractual Obligations and Commitment” 
Planet reveals that its advertising commitments doubled Post-IPO


Judging by the stagnating member growth through 2015 even with total 
clubs increasing by 206, it appears the dramatic increase in planned 
advertising is likely a result of pressures to retain and attract new 
members, or forestall possible cannabilzation. As we previously discussed, 
Planet also does not disclose membership churn

Warning: National Advertising Fund 
Accounting Could Be Problematic


Thinly Capitalized Advertising Fund?


Planet separates and restricts assets of its National Advertising Fund (“NAF”). By our estimate, it appears to spend 
more money that it has available.  If true, how has the deficit been financed?


Source: Planet SEC Filings


Planet discloses in its prospectus (p. 6): that it spent over $21 million from 
the NAF in 2014. Furthermore, Planet also discloses that it paid itself $1.01 
million in administration fees for the NAF in 2014 (Note 6, F-31)


Planet also reveals some information in its 2015 Franchise Disclosure 
Document (“FDD” p. DD36) that 5.3% of NAF funds were spent on 
administrative expenses in 2014 


Simple math implies that NAF funds were approximately $19m in 2014 = 
($1.0m / 5.3%) 


Assuming our analysis is correct, it appears that in 2014 the NAF spent 
$2.0m (= $21m - $19m) more than it actually had! How was the deficit 
financed and were shareholder funds commingled with the NAF?


• Planet’s own balance sheet shows a $0 balance for the NAF at 2014 and 
$1.3m at year end 2013. Planet’s FDD makes a disclosure which does not 
appear in its SEC filings:


“The NAF is accounted for separately from our other funds. While our 
intent is to balance the NAF on an annual basis, periodically the NAF may 
run at either a surplus or deficit. All disbursements from the NAF are 
made first from income and then from contributions. We may spend in 
any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate 
contributions of all PLANET FITNESS businesses to the NAF in that year, 
and the NAF may borrow from us or other lenders to cover deficits in the 
NAF or cause the NAF to invest any surplus for future use by the NAF.”

Potential To Game the Pre-Sale 
Member Numbers?


Planet Fitness reserves the right for the pre-marketing and sales to start no less than 45 days prior 
to a store opening. Pre-sale practices could enable them to artificially boost their reported active member count


“The stated amount is an estimate of the amount you will spend on pre-sale marketing prior to commencing operations. The 
pre-sale marketing period typically begins no less than 45 days immediately preceding the date that you commence regular 
operations at your PLANET FITNESS location, and it may be as long as 180 days thereafter (“Pre-Sale Marketing Period”). We will 
determine the length and start date of the Pre-Sale Marketing Period based upon the location of the BUSINESS, demographics 
and other factors. Presale marketing expenses will include a variety of marketing, public relations programs, media and 
advertising materials that we approve. You will conduct your pre-opening marketing efforts from a temporary facility located at 
or near the site of your future”   Source: 2014 Franchise Disclosure Document

Perhaps One Way Planet Is Gaming Membership 
Numbers?


Recent evidence to suggest Planet Fitness could be stretching the pre-sale period by up to 60 days


Planet Fitness coming to Terre Haute's south side in February
By David Hughes/Tribune-Star  Dec 2, 2015 


Anyone who has seen a national Planet Fitness television 
commercial probably hasn’t forgotten it.  “I make your little 
muscles into big muscles,” a man exaggerating the stereotype of a 
“musclehead” gym trainer tells a potential customer in one of 
them.


A few seconds later, the Planet Fitness “lunk alarm” sounds and a 
purple-shirted employee explains in a more relaxed setting: “We’re 
not a gym. We’re Planet Fitness.” What’s stressed after that are 
Planet Fitness’ catchphrases of “No Gymtimidation,” “No Lunks” 
and “No Pressure.”


Next month, Wabash Valley residents will be able to join a Planet 
Fitness in Terre Haute. It’ll be located inside the old Antiques Crafts 
& Things and Sue’s Hallmark Shop buildings at 138 W. Honey Creek 
Parkway, just south of Honey Creek Mall. Mike Campagnolo, owner 
of this Planet Fitness and others around Indiana, told the Tribune-
Star on Tuesday that the 24,000-square-foot facility should be 
open by late February.


A $1 pre-sale on memberships for the Terre Haute Planet Fitness 
will begin Jan. 2, although the facility won’t be available for 
workouts that soon. The $1 can be used as a down payment 
toward either form of monthly membership in the future.

Equipment Revenue Highly Material, With 
Limited Disclosure to Evaluate Performance


Item Not Disclosed Reason Why It Is Material and Should Be Disclosed


Concentration Risk to 
Equipment Vendors


Planet noted a significant increase in concentration of equipment purchases from two vendors in 2015, but 
does not explain who are the vendors, or why the concentration materially increased in 2015.  ”For the year 
ended 2015 purchases from two vendors comprised 79% and 18%; for the year ended 2014 purchases from two 
vendors comprised 66% and 25%; for the year ended 2013, purchases from these two vendors comprised 66% 
and 25%


% of Equipment Revenue 
Coming From Replacement 
Sales


PLNT states:  “equip” and “re-equip” requirements create a predictable and growing revenue stream as our 
franchisees open new stores under their ADA. Planet does not break out the exact amount of revenue in its SEC 
filings coming from replacing of equipment and cardio machines from existing franchisees, but has commented 
on rough percentages on conference calls


Maturity Schedule For
Existing Equipment


If re-equipment sales are in fact predictable, PLNT could disclose to investors a multi-year schedule that lays 
out its expectation for when it expects to realize re-equip revenues. PLNT does not disclose such information 
and has offered a loose discussion of it on its conference calls without much specificity


Equipment Rebates PLNT has disclosed that rebates have been a meaningful driver of equipment margins on conference calls, but 
does not discuss the exact amount of rebates or impact in its SEC filings...why? 


Equipment Fess Payable to 
Related-Parties


In its 2015 Franchise Agreement document on p. DD-27 there is a disclosure: “One of our officers owns an 
indirect interest in PF Equipment, an approved supplier of fitness equipment.” This disclosure was not made in 
any of PLNT’s SEC Filings. What % is owned and who is the related party?


Divergent Accounting Choices
Merits Further Scrutiny


Planet historically disclosed it accounted for equipment sales under the “gross” revenue accounting model, 
which is an accounting choice subject to significant managerial discretion. On its FY 2015 conference call, 
management made the unusual disclosure that it accounts for domestic equipment sales under the “gross” 
revenue method, but applies international equipment sales under the “net” revenue method....why?


It is critically important to understand Planet’s equipment and re-equipment sales since 42% and 26% of 
consolidated 2015 sales and EBITDA were derived from this segment
38


Divergent Accounting Choices For 
Equipment....Why?


According to CFO Dorvin Lively:


“We recognize our revenues on equipment purchases by our international franchisees 
differently, compared to when we sell equipment to franchisees here in the U.S. Domestically, 
we take title of the equipment from the equipment manufacturer, ship the equipment to the 
franchisee location and then we generally assist the franchisee with assembly and placement 
for this equipment whereby we also recognize a placement fee for those services. In other 
words, we have gross revenue, cost of goods sold and a gross profit.”


“Internationally, we do not take title to the equipment from the equipment manufacturer, but 
rather the manufacturer sells this equipment directly to the international franchisee and then 
pays us a commission on this sale that is equal to the gross profit that we would have 
recognized as if that transaction had occurred here in the U.S. Another way to think about it is 
that we have lower revenues for these new stores outside the U.S., but it generates the same 
gross profit dollars”


Spruce Point had been analyzing Planet’s choice of gross revenue accounting for its 
equipment, when Planet made an usual disclosure on its recent FY 2015 call that it applies two 
methods based on location of shipment. In Spruce Point’s experience, we have never seen a 


company use two different accounting methods for the same business transaction!

What is the 
Flow of Funds?


“In addition, if you fail to make any payment when due to a

determine that it is the most efficient method to remit 
payment to any supplier, we have the right to act as a pass 
through by collecting payments .....for the specific product or 
service and remitting those payments to the supplier, who 
ultimately provides the product or the service to you.....
Products and services for which we may act as a pass 
through may include equipment, fixtures, goods, 
merchandise, inventory.....”


Who Has Risk 
to the 
Equipment?


All insurance policies must be issued on an “admitted” basis 
by carriers approved by us.... contain such types and min 
amounts of coverage, exclusions and max deductibles as we 
prescribe in our current Franchise Disclosure Document or 
otherwise in writing from time to time; name us and our 
Affiliates, including but not limited to Planet Fitness 
Equipment, LLC and PFIP, LLC, as additional insureds;


PLNT’s own language makes it clear that funds flow 
from the franchisee to the suppliers. How then can 
PLNT claim it bears the credit risk?


PLNT’s own language makes it clear that the supplier 
ultimately provides the product and service. How then

Risk to physical loss of product is a key

insurance and name its equipment company as an 
insured party.

Potential Overstatement of 
Franchise Revenues


Planet Disclosure Spruce Point Observation and Opinion


Placement 
Revenues


Effective January 1, 2012, we began to report placement revenue 
within franchise revenue. Prior to January 1, 2012, this revenue was 
reported within equipment revenue. Placement revenue includes 
amounts we charge our franchisees for assembling and placing cardio 
and strength equipment at franchisee-owned stores. Placement 
revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance of the services 
at the franchisee stores


We believe Planet wants to focus investors more on its franchise 
revenues and less on its equipment revenues as investors are more 
likely to value the stability of franchise revenues higher than the 
lumpiness of equipment sales. Not surprisingly, Planet reclassified the 
location of placement revenues on its income statement. We also 
believe Planet focused more effort on increasing its collectable royalty 
rate to 5% and is de-emphasizing equipment margin


Placement 
Costs


Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Consists of costs 
associated with administrative and franchisee support functions related 
to our existing business as well as growth and development activities, 
including costs to support placement services. These costs primarily 
consist of payroll, IT-related, marketing, legal and accounting expenses


It is highly unusual and distortive, if not outright flawed, to put a cost 
associated with revenue in the SG&A line. Planet does not report a cost 
of franchise revenue line item and its cost of revenue line relates just to 
equipment product sales. In our opinion, the placement costs should be 
netted against the placement revenue

Tax Receivable Concern


Why is PLNT’s post IPO balance sheet liability of approximately $140m for a complicated tax benefit arrangement 
much lower than $711m described in its Risk Factors? Planet warns that shareholders could be on the hook for 


substantial payments years in advance of the tax benefits being realized and place a strain on its liquidity


“For example, if we had elected to terminate the tax receivable agreements as of December 31, 2015, based on a share price of $15.63 per 
share of our Class A common stock (based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of December 
31, 2015) and a discount rate equal to 2.1%, we estimate that we would have been required to pay $576.0 million in the aggregate under 
the tax receivable agreements.”


“Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to 
the tax receivable agreements, we expect that the reduction in tax payments for us associated with sales of the corresponding Holdings Units 
as described above would aggregate to approximately $836.7 million over 23 years from our IPO based on a price of $15.63 per share of our 
Class A common stock, the closing price per share of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2015 and, assuming all future sales had 
occurred on such date. Under such scenario, we would be required to pay the other parties to the tax receivable agreements 85% of such 
amount, or $711.2 million, over the applicable period under the tax receivable agreements.“

Warning About Tax Receivable Strategies


A New York Times article discussed private equity’s use of tax receivable strategies as an “obscure tax strategy,”  
“controversial,” and “financial engineering use to deprive companies of cash.” Not surprisingly,  the article also 


noted that most sophisticated investors don’t understand these deals. Buyer beware: what’s beneficial to Pre-IPO 
private equity investors may not necessarily be beneficial to Post-IPO public shareholders.


Squeezing Out Cash Long After the I.P.O.
By LYNNLEY BROWNING  MARCH 13, 2013 6:26 PM


“When the Berry Plastics Group, a container and packaging company, went public last October, it generated up to $350 million in tax savings. But the company won’t 
collect the bulk of the benefits. Rather, Berry Plastics will hand over 85 percent of the savings, in cash, to its former private equity owners. The obscure tax strategy is 
the latest technique that private equity firms are using to extract money from their companies, in this case long after the initial public offering.


In a typical buyout, the owners make money by sprucing up the operations and selling the business to another company or public investors. Private equity firms have 
also found ways to profit before the so-called exit with special one-time dividends and annual management fees. Now, buyout specialists are increasingly collecting 
continuing payouts from their former portfolio companies. The strategy, known as an income tax receivable agreement, has been quietly employed in dozens of recent 
offerings backed by private equity, including those involving PBF Energy, Vantiv and Dynavox.


While relatively rare, the strategy, referred to as a supercharged I.P.O., has proved to be controversial. To some tax experts, the technique amounts to financial 
engineering, depriving the companies of cash. Berry Plastics, for example, has to make payments to its one-time private equity owners, Apollo Global Management 
and Graham Partners, through 2016. “It drains money out of the company that could be used for purposes that benefit all the shareholders,” said Robert Willens, a
corporate tax and accounting expert in New York who coined the term “supercharged I.P.O.”


It’s lucrative for the private equity firms. The payments, which can last as long as 15 years, create a tidy income stream, typically taxed at the lower capital gains 
rate. The Graham Packaging Company, a maker of plastic containers, expects to pay its former owners $200 million, according to securities filings; Emdeon, a billing 
company, $151 million; and National CineMedia, a cinema advertiser, more than $196 million. But some tax experts take issue with the strategy. “They involve 
millions, often billions, of dollars in cash transfers from newly public companies to a small group of pre-I.P.O. owners,” Victor Fleischer, a tax professor at the 
University of Colorado, and Nancy Staudt, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California, wrote in a 2013 study. (Mr. Fleischer is a contributor to 
DealBook.) The study said the primary reason for the deals was tax arbitrage.


Another potential issue is that sophisticated investors do not necessarily understand the deals, either. The agreements typically warrant just a few paragraphs in 
a company’s I.P.O. filings. And the companies are generally on the hook for the cash payments, even if their profits deteriorate. Berry Plastics lost $10 million in the 
last quarter and already carries a costly debt load of $4.6 billion. In its I.P.O. filing, the company cautioned that the tax deal could affect its liquidity.

Recent Class Action Lawsuit Claims 
Unfair Cancellation Terms


Planet Fitness Membership Class Action Filed in NJ


A class action lawsuit was filed against Planet Fitness and franchise stores in New Jersey, alleging that their membership agreements have unfair 
cancellation terms and fail to disclose several notices required by New Jersey law. Planet Fitness is the brand name for a popular health club, with 
approximately 40 franchise stores in New Jersey, according to the lawsuit. The Planet Fitness class action lawsuit was initially filed in state court in 
September, and was removed to New Jersey federal court last week.


The Planet Fitness membership agreement class action lawsuit alleges that Planet Fitness requires its franchise stores to use its contracts, which 
“obligate their customers to automatically and perpetually renew their contracts by imposing unreasonable and unduly onerous requirements 
to cancel their health club memberships.”


Plaintiff Marni Truglio’s membership agreement says she could cancel her membership “by the 10th of the month,” but another section requires 
“thirty days notice” in order to cancel. The class action lawsuit claims that “in reality, the written notification must be completed within thirty-
seven (37) days notice.”


According to the Planet Fitness class action lawsuit, “This confusing and/or misleading language in the Membership Agreement results in many 
consumers being forced to pay for, at least, one additional month of membership at [Planet Fitness] health clubs after they cancel the contract.”


In addition, the Planet Fitness membership agreement class action lawsuit alleges that the membership agreements fail to clearly state the total 
cost to the consumer up front. Truglio’s membership agreement reportedly stated her first month’s prorated fee of $11.33, the monthly 
membership fee of $19.99, and the one-time annual renewal fee of $39.00, but did not state the total. According to the Planet Fitness class action 
lawsuit, “Given that the Membership Agreement is for a minimum of 12 months, it fails to set forth the total payment obligation of … $270.22.”


Finally, the Planet Fitness class action lawsuit details several terms and notices required by New Jersey law for health club membership 
contracts that are missing from Planet Fitness membership agreements. Such notices include the right to cancel within three days, and that a 
bond is filed with a state agency for consumers harmed by the health club, among others, according to the class action lawsuit.

If the lawsuit is true, it illustrates that you can only take advantage of customers for so long before they 
take their business to the competition!

Planet’s Road to IPO Worth 
Carefully Evaluating


Planet Fitness’ road to a public offering
Ex-Cabletron exec played role in private equity deal


by Bob Sanders, July 9, 2015


Craig Benson would like Planet Fitness to become “the next Cabletron.”


At least that’s what the former Cabletron Systems CEO and New Hampshire governor told state legislators on May 27, when he urged them 
to approve a special tax change in anticipation of the Newington-based gym chain’s $100 million initial public offering.


What Benson didn’t mention was his interest in the company, both as a recent investor and board member and the owner of the chain’s 35-
gym franchise in New Jersey. Nor did he reveal that he and former Cabletron Chief Financial Officer David Kirkpatrick played a crucial role in 
the effort to take the company public three years ago.


That effort ended up in a private equity sale for more than $500 million – a sale that resulted in two lawsuits. One went to trial and 
resulted in a $3 million judgment that was settled on appeal and the other was filed by Planet Fitness’s former CFO, Jayne Conway, who 
accused the company of securities fraud for not giving her a fair share of that private equity payoff.


Kirkpatrick is apparently no longer involved with Planet Fitness, but he has had experience with charges of securities fraud.
He settled a civil suit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for nearly $350,000, for his alleged actions as Cabletron’s CFO. 
Criminal charges against executives of Cabletron’s spin-off, Enterasys Networks, resulted in hefty prison sentences for top-level executives.


Kirkpatrick was never charged criminally nor admitted guilt civilly, but the mere accusation prevented one accounting firm from having 
anything to do with an IPO involving him, even though Kirkpatrick was only acting as a consultant, according to Conway’s suit. Indeed, 
Conway alleges that the reason she was fired is that she revealed Kirkpatrick’s involvement to auditors.
Neither that lawsuit nor seven other previously settled suits disclosed in the company’s franchise documents were mentioned in Planet 
Fitness’ extensive draft IPO filings, but the filings do anticipate federal tax savings as a result of going public, savings that would mainly go to 
the equity firm


It is worth considering that Planet’s former 
CFO sued the company and it did business 
with an SEC investigated businessman on 


the road to its IPO

Governance Concerns


The Board is not currently structured well to protect the interest of public shareholders
Classification of Board Members
• Planet’s Board currently has three classes of directors, with terms staggered to expire in 2016, 2017, and 2018
• A classified Board makes it difficult for outside shareholders to change the composition of the Board quickly


Composition of Board Members
• Currently 4 of 8 Board members are connected to the largest shareholder TSG 


Unclear Bonus Structure for Management
• Planet has not given outside investors a transparent view into how its management will be compensated for performance of key metrics. 


In other words, Planet’s management can fail to hit guidance it gives to the market, yet still get paid full bonuses
• “The terms of our of cash bonus program for our 2015 fiscal year, as they apply to our named executive officers and our other senior 


executives, are generally the same as the terms that applied for our 2014 fiscal year, as described above under “2014 performance 
bonuses”. Cash bonus awards payable in respect of our 2015 fiscal year will be based on the achievement of key corporate financial and 
strategic goals relating to corporate same store sales, franchise same store sales, club openings, and earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization”

and could disadvantage shareholders and other franchisees. Planet used to disclose Spectrum Monthly as a preferred 
marketing supplier to franchisees in its 2014 FDD, but stopped its disclosure in the 2015 FDD. Our research suggest 


Planet still uses Spectrum.

Easy To Refute the Bull Case 
on Planet Fitness


“While we are admittedly unsure what majority-share holder TSG will 
do with its stake, which could act as a modest overhang to stock”


Analysts’ and PLNT Investment Highlights


What do you think they’ll do...SELL! We estimate PLNT accounts for 20% of 
TSG’s portfolio, which amounts to a large investment concentration. TSG 
sold shares at the IPO, and in our opinion, will seek to unload more shares 
at this inflated price to lock in a 3x gain


Analysts justify extreme price targets based on comparisons to other 
franchises and retailors exposed to entirely different business and 
industry risk. We think investors should look to the recent Life Time 
Fitness LBO and Cybex deals as better valuation guideposts


Spruce Point’s Rebuttal


We believe there is limited benefit to franchisees having to replace cardio 
and other equipment starting every 4 years other than to enrich PLNT. 
Stricter enforcement implies franchisees are resisting the requirement, which 
speaks to the onerous financial burden in places on their potential 
profitability. Unhappy franchisees is a clear negative for PLNT


“With >1,000  store  commitments  already in place, we have clear 
visibility into the growth trajectory. Plus, the fact that >80% of new 
growth is coming from existing franchisees demonstrates the power 
& profitability of the model & gives us confidence that PLNT can 
ultimately reach 4,000 stores


“Opaque Pricing, Relatively Low Churn, No COGS, and Significant 
Private Equity (“PE”) Ownership”


Our target price of $19 is based on a peer multiple analysis, which 
includes other best-in-class franchisors and high-growth retailers 


PLNT was founded in 1992 and it took 23 yrs to achieve 1,000 clubs. The 
market has simply become more saturated and competitive with  regional, 
and national competition, along with growing alternative fitness methods 
gaining in popularity (eg. Boot camp, Soul Cycle). Furthermore, its model 
is already prevalent in Canada, making an int’l expansion plan tougher


We find it hard to believe PLNT has a superior advertising spending model 
given the traditional tools of internet/social media/TV that all fitness clubs 
have available. We also find it hard to believe that PLNT is better able to 
differentiate its message with advertising slogans like “no judgment zone” 
“no gymtimidation” etc


“Franchisees  are  starting  to  recognize  the benefit of re-equipping 
stores (& thus are more compliant) plus mgmt is being stricter in 
enforcement, which should drive significant top-line growth as the 
backlog catches up &the store base matures & younger stores enter 
the re-equipment phase”


“Differentiated Concept and Consumer Proposition” Early low cost value proposition advantages have declined as significant 
new entrants into the marketplace have replicated PLNT’s business model 
advantages ( low cost and convenience for the casual fitness member )


“We believe PLNT’s advertising spending is superior to peers.  
PLNT’s growth and brand equity has been aided by continued 
company focus on advertising. Last year, the company spent $21 
million+ on national advertising and has spent over $150 million on 
national and local advertising since 2011.”


Absurd justification to buy PLNT’s stock. To the contrary, pricing in the 
fitness industry is very transparent and negotiable! Analysts cannot claim 
PLNT has low churn because the company won’t even disclose it!

Nautilus: A Good Valuation Comp 
For Exercise Equipment


Historical EV /  LTM Sales Historical EV /  LTM EBITDA


Source: Bloomberg


Given the high % of revenues coming from equipment sales, we believe it’s instructive to look at Nautlius 
(NYSE: NLS), a marketer of exercise equipment, as a valuation benchmark. Planet reports 21% segment 


EBITDA from equipment revenue, which compares with approximately 25% for Nautilus. Historically, NLS has 
traded at 1x and 10.5x EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA, respectively

Investors have high growth expectations for Planet. We don’t believe its growth rate, margins, or 15x 2017E EBITDA 
multiple are sustainable. We expect that by late 2016 / early 2017 that cracks in the growth story will appear and Planet 


will be at higher risk of disappointing the Street.  At the lower end, we apply a 7x multiple, which is near CLUB’s 
highest multiple ever attained, and at the high end we apply a 10x multiple, slightly less than fitness equipment comps 


of Nautilus and Cybex. The midpoint of our target range is appox. $8.00 / share, or 50% downside 


(1) We include the $140m book value of the tax payable liability in our valuation, although our interpretation is that it could be upwards of $711m based on Planet’s Risk Factor disclosures . 
Analysts’ model fail to incorporate this liability which has actual cash flow implications to shareholders

Planet’s analysts appear to completely ignore the valuation impact of the tax receivable payments that benefit pre-IPO 
owners 85%, and current shareholders 15%. These payments will have real cash flow impact to shareholders going 


forward. Eleven analysts cover Planet, yet only 1 analyst we found even mentions the risk! The “Termination Case” and 
“Base Case” are not included in Spruce Point’s valuation and target share price analysis, this represents an additional 


$5.80 - $7.20 per  share price downside above and beyond our target range.


Note: Termination and Base case assume $15.63 share price or approximately the current price. Conditions that could give rise to termination include 1) a 
material breach of the agreement 2) at the election of the company, or 3)  asset sales, mergers, or change of control. Base case assumes no material change 
in relevant tax law, and that Planet earns sufficient income to realize all the tax benefits of the agreements. All cases assume 23 year time horizon


Jefferies Analyst:  “In addition, we note that there is some risk inherent in the company’s Up-C organizational structure. While this corporate 
structure results in tax benefits for both Planet Fitness and its financial sponsor TSG Consumer Partners, it also saddles the company with a 
tax receivable agreement, which Planet Fitness is obligated to pay over the course of the next 23 years regardless of their future 
performance.”


Spruce Point also notes: Payments under the tax receivable agreements are not conditioned on the Pre-IPO owners continued ownership of 
Planet! What a great residual benefit to them, with some potential bad outcomes for new + existing Planet shareholders as illustrated below

Downside Catalyst: A Concentrated Owner 
With A Big Win = Likely Motivated Seller


According to PLNT’s IPO prospectus, TSG owns 65.8% of the voting power of the shares.  Its investment 
totaled $479.3m (est. 9.0x EBITDA / $790k per club) and its cost basis is estimated at $3.39/sh Its current 


investment is valued around $1.0 billion and likely to be monetized through a secondary.


Source:  TSG Closes Two New Funds;  Wall St. Journal Article;  PLNT IPO Prospectus


Slam Dunk Home Run for TSG from its Nov 2012 Planet Investment
• TSG has extracted significant value from Planet Fitness through management fees, dividend payments and stock sales
• Direct TSG investors received approximately $61.6m of net proceeds from the IPO offering
• TSG received $4.3m of management fees paid 2012-2015 including a $1.0m termination fee for the management services arrangement
• Refinancing and dividend payments:


• On March 31, 2014, PLNT consummated a refinancing transaction whereby it borrowed $390.0m in term loans and obtained a 
new $40.0m revolving credit facility. The proceeds were primarily used to repay $180.9m in outstanding debt, issue a $173.9 
million dividend to members and acquire eight stores from a franchisee


• On March 31, 2015, PLNT amended its credit agreement to provide for an increase of $120.0m in term loan borrowings for a 
total of $506.1m. The full incremental borrowing of $120.0m plus $20.0m from cash on hand was used to fund a $140.0m 
dividend to Class T and Class O Unit holders


Large Investment Concentration Remains To Be Liquidated With IPO Lockup Expired
• The current market value of TSG’s investment is estimated at approximately $1.0 billion and it was made in TSG6 which the company 


says has $1.3 bn of committed capital
• TSG raised a new fund and as of December 2015 reported $5 billion of assets under management 
• The current $1.0 billion valuation of TSG’s stake in PLNT represents significant investment concentration risk – 20% of AUM – and is 


likely to be monetized through additional secondary stock sales issuances
