The Short Case for Neoprobe: Skeptical of Its Primary Asset's
Success
Jun. 1, 2011 9:15 AM ET118 comments

Current Price: $5.25.
Price Target: $0.25 by May 31 , 2012.


Neoprobe (NEOP) has 146 million shares outstanding by the treasury method, resulting in
a market capitalization of $767 million. With $10 million in cash on the balance sheet, $31
million receivable from equity conversions and $30 million receivable from the sale of their
imaging business, Neoprobe has cash of roughly $71 million, resulting in a fully diluted
enterprise value of roughly $700 million. The capital structure is slightly complex in this
regard, but it is important to know exactly what one is paying for when they trade
Neoprobe shares.


Almost all of the value of Neoprobe is in their lymphatic mapping agent, Lymphoseek. This
is the only asset I will value. I will endeavor to prove that this asset is close to worthless,
and therefore, equity shares of Neoprobe are worthless as well.


Lymphoseek is proposed to be used as a sentinel lymph node biopsy tracer agent. After
injecting Lymphoseek, surgeons will be able to detect lymph nodes by scanning the
injected area with a radioactive probe. Once a radioactive lymph node is found, it can be
removed and dissected to determine if the node contained cancerous elements. The term
“sentinel lymph node” refers to the first lymph node that drains from the tumor site.


The current standard of care for sentinel lymph node biopsy is the combination of a blue
dye (isosulfan blue or methylene blue) and a radioactive technetium-99 sulfur colloid. This
combination results in the identification of a sentinel lymph node upwards of 95% of the
time[1]. It is commonly believed that this identification rate cannot be improved upon.
There are many studies which prove that the excision of just one or two sentinel lymph
nodes accurately predicts the cancer status of the rest of the axilla (armpit).


Obviously, as one removes more nodes, one gets closer to 100% accurate prediction of
the axilla status. This concept is called the “received operating characteristic” or ROC
curve. It is very important to understand this concept. As one removes and dissects more
nodes, one will find more cancer.

The marginal benefit of doing so can be easily plotted on this ROC curve. One can reach
100% sensitivity at the cost of lower specificity. The goal in any diagnostic is to balance
the two, if possible. Both blue dyes and radioactive colloids can be interpreted more
loosely to remove more nodes—physicians know this, but choose to take just one or two
nodes as there is no benefit of doing more as per the ROC curve.


Let’s take a step back from the statistics of diagnostics and learn a little bit about this
sentinel lymph node market. It is likely about 200,000 sentinel lymph node biopsies are
done for breast cancer in the United States annually[2]. The AWP of sulfur colloid is
$53.20[3]. Liberally assuming 300,000 procedures are done, so as to include melanoma
and head and neck cancer, the total opportunity for Lymphoseek in the United States is
$16 million.


Even if Lymphoseek is priced at a 6 fold increase from sulfur colloid prices (despite no
documented advantage, and selling to a cost-conscious hospital market) and takes 100%
market share, the fair value of Neoprobe using a liberal DCF is $2.71, a 48% decline from
current price levels for an absurd, best-case scenario.


A more likely scenario is Lymphoseek is priced at a 600% premium to sulfur colloid and
takes 10-15% United States market share. Any market share gains generally take time.
My “best-case” scenario assumed that Lymphoseek takes 100% market share in the first
day of approval. Usually when I assume variables like this for other companies, the share
price upside is dramatic. This reflects my notion that no matter what happens with respect
to market share, Neoprobe is a short.


Pricing is an important lever in this model. If Lymphoseek is priced at $1,000 or more per
dose, it still would not generate enough revenue for Neoprobe to be a “buy”. Even the
uber-bulls with investment banking conflicts are estimating a price for Lymphoseek of
$500. At $5,000 (100 times sulfur colloid pricing), we start to get to a reasonable buying
opportunity.


So what should Lymphoseek be priced at? As usual, hospitals calculate risk-benefit when
they pay for drugs. The only thing they care about when prescribing medicine is, “is there
an extreme medical necessity?” and “will this save the hospital money?” Neoprobe will
have you believe Lymphoseek can be injected 15 minutes before surgery, saving the
hospital money by reducing wait time and hospital stays. Sulfur colloid can be injected two
hours before surgery. Some have been successful using sulfur colloid 30-45 minutes
before surgery.[4] This would be a marginal, but useful innovation if the patient had to wait
in the operating room.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/272708-the-short-case-for-neoprobe-skeptical-of-its-primary-assets-success 3/38


nfortunately for Neoprobe, injection of colloid and dye take place prior to the patient’s
admittance to the operating room[5], either in the surgeon’s office or in the radiopharmacy.
In our fantasy world where Lymphoseek easily receives approval, we cannot conjure a
realistic scenario where the shares are worth much more than $0.50.


The most likely scenario, should Neoprobe receive Lymphoseek approval, is pricing of
600% that of generically available off-label sulfur colloid, some gradual market share gain
(10-30%) due to promotion and newness of the product, which would result in $0.54 per
share of value for Neoprobe shareholders, -90% from current levels. However, approval of
Lymphoseek is far from certain.


In my eyes, Lymphoseek will not win FDA approval. Neoprobe conducted two pivotal
studies of Lymphoseek, NEO03-05 and NEO03-09. Remarkably, the Phase III data for
NEO03-05 has differed depending on which Neoprobe presentation one looks at. At an
analyst day in December 2010, Dr. Cope from Neoprobe presented data from “n=179
subjects” with a “97% concordance rate with vital blue dyes”. This recapitulated the first
report of NEO3-05’s results, which were first reported in May 2009.


However, in January 2011, at the “OneMedPlace Finance Forum”, Neoprobe disclosed a
lower concordance rate of 93%[6], with a p-value of 0.04, close the p=0.05 level of failure.
The presentation included other deviations from the original data, including simple
variables like sample size. For instance, the December 2010 presentation notes n=136 in
the ITT population, but the January 2011 presentation notes n=158. How this could
happen is well beyond my ability to guess.


Regardless of discrepancies, the trial design of NEO03-05 and NEO03-09 is bizarre. The
company selected the primary endpoint of concordance with blue dye, attempting to
establish similarity to only half of the standard of care, blue dye plus sulfur colloid. The trial
will not inform physicians on how to use Lymphoseek, since it was not compared to the
current standard in a non-inferiority or superiority test.


One of the problems that Neoprobe would encounter in running a study against standard
of care is that the standard of care cannot be improved. The detection rate for blue dye
plus sulfur colloid is over 95%, so the success of the procedure cannot be improved. It
would be too time-consuming to do a head-to-head study that attempted to predict cancer
recurrence, the downside of a false negative reading.


So instead, Neoprobe chose to compare Lymphoseek to half of the standard of care. The
company even had the nerve to claim “superiority” to blue dye by finding nodes that were
positive that blue dye did not pick up. Blue dye is not a competitor to Lymphoseek. Blue

dye is used in conjunction with a radioactive tracer to assist the surgeon in identifying
sentinel lymph nodes.


Furthermore, claims of superiority are meaningless because patients who have one
sentinel lymph node taken out that is positive will have all axillary lymph nodes taken out.
Neoprobe fails to disclose if these patients were the ones where Lymphoseek “found” their
cancer.


Lymphoseek was invented by University of California, San Diego. Despite the glaring
conflict of interest, Dr. Anne Wallace from UCSD was a key investigator in the NEO03-05
clinical trials. We believe Dr. Wallace’s site may have enrolled up to a quarter of the
patients in NEO03-05.


The FDA will demand a real-world clinical trial for Lymphoseek. While it’s difficult to predict
what the design of such a study will be, we suspect the FDA will enforce the “truth
standard” requirement is does for all diagnostics. Lymphoseek is a generic sulfur colloid in
my mind, with a very poor (and seemingly suspect) Phase III data set.


Because the market for colloids is so small, I don’t see how Neoprobe is worth any more
than $50 million, even if FDA approved.

Very well reasoned piece. I am sure the retail crowd, pumped into a frenzy by the Platinum-Montaur crew (ditto ECTE)
will be screaming for your head....they would rather be diluted by Nordlicht than face reality. Can't wait for Uri
Landesman to go back on TV and hype this dog again.

Results of the study show Lymphoseek helps surgeons locate the true path of the drainage from cancer cells, and
thus assists in targeting the amount and type of surgery needed. Blue dye leaves much to be desired. Lymphoseek is
likely to gain 100% of the market, making it a very important drug. Success there and RIGS gets the money it needs
for full development, which would make NEOP a very important bio-pharma company. The shorts are getting killed on
this one - hence the reason for this article.

Author’s reply »  It's important to understand, as I said in my article, blue dye + colloid is the standard of care
for SLND. Therefore, without data randomized against blue dye + colloid, there is no way to tell how effective
Lymphoseek is. The only studies Neoprobe ran was Lymphoseek versus blue dye. Unfortunately, 100% of the
world uses the combination of blue dye + colloid, so the tests are meaningless.


Hope that helps!

No sir that does not help. Filtered sulfur colloid is used off-label in lymphoscintigraphy procedures. Therefore
the FDA would not condone a clinical study with it as the truth standard. Vital blue dye is the only FDA
approved product for use in sentinel lymph node detection.


BTW, since sulfur colloid is off-label for this purpose it is not reimbursable. Hospitals eat the cost for it and
only make money on the procedure itself. Therefore, "cost-conscious" hospitals will be more willing to utilize
the more expensive Lymphseek b/c it WILL be reimbursed.

So a hedge fund manager who is short NEOP should be believed why? You have 2 comments on SA and both take
the short position yet you list no firm you work for and both comments are made in the past 2 days. Hope you realize
that to get published on SA takes no credentials. So a non-credentialed, anonymous, self described short hedge fund
manager should be believed why?


The short hype is as bad as the long hype but also adds the edge of viciousness. Too bad for you that you've tagged
yourself as someone whose due diligence is pointed only toward lining your pockets.

"God forbid a money manager doing work in an effort to make money."


To some folks this type of rhetoric broadcast not to inform but to drive a wedge between the market and
buyers through the use of innuendo, half truths, and scare tactics is probably something God would forbid, all
things being equal.


It's one thing to take an alternate view and lobby for that, quite the other to fear monger for your own benefit.
Just sayin'. You're probably still legal but the whole money at any cost style of many hedge fund manager
wannabees is, well, unseemly.


As Mr. Perez pointed out you totally miss the point of Lymphoseek..."Blue dye missed 25% of lymph nodes
that were confirmed to be cancerous by pathology, vs. 0% false negatives for Lymphoseek."


Now which one would you want used on you or a loved one at risk and being diagnosed? Something with 0%
false negatives or something that might prove not as efficacious?

Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  See my above comments to another poster where I indicated the standard of care for SLND
is blue dye + sulfur colloid. There is no test that compares Lymphoseek to this standard, therefore, I would
want my loved ones to use the standard of care that has been proven for 30 years, not an investigational
agent randomized against HALF of the standard of care.

Have you talked to any of the women that have had Sulfur colloid used on them ? I have! they have described
the pain, It feels like somone is putting a lit cigarett out on their breast. Lymphoseek uses one tenth of the
tech 99 and causes little or no pain. Sulfur colloid is not approved it is being used off label. Ask any med tech.

What an amazing piece of fiction. This is all about the shorts covering just like Kevin said. Someone just had to cover
over 2 million shares prior to this article. Neoprobe is a home run. Lymphoseek had a value of $450 million prior to
superiority findings in their phase III trial over blue dye. Rigs is estimated at 3 to 4 Billion. Thanks to this hit piece the
price is down which makes it a good time to buy.

Oh, yes. The guys at FDA and the Oncology surgeons are a big bunch of idiots, while we must believe the technical
superiority of the author. All the trials that Lymphoseek has gone through were designed in consultation with the FDA.
FDA already approved the trial designs. The final trial was not proposed by Neoprobe instead it was at the sole
suggestion of FDA. Results of Lymphoseek trials have been presented in major oncology conferences and published
in respected journals. Oh, the surgeons must not know their stuff. The surgeons have been clamouring to use the first
FDA approved drug which has no reaction to the patients while current drugs have well documented drug reactions.
But all this must just be because the bunch of surgeons have been bribed by Neoprobe. How can one believe
documented data? Instead we must believe this article. After all it is by a short.

Oh, yes we must address the analysts. Some 6-7 analysts have analyzed the Lymphoseek market and share

So how large is MSMB and why should investors hie to your point of view given your self admitted short bent
as well as not even considering RIGS in your evaluation of the company?


You waded into the swamp here and are now stuck in the muck of your own making. We've all had to dine on
crow before and the next few days should either give shorts or longs a Pyhrric victory of sorts, whilst the
damage to the day is never fully recompensed. A needless distraction for a product that will do some good.

What you fail to realize is that the story is about LOWER FALSE NEGATIVES, more than about much better positives.
Blue dye missed 25% of lynph nodes that were confirmed to be cancerous by pathology, vs. 0% false negatives for
Lymphoseek.


Your article is so biased and misinformed it would take me the whole day to reply. I'll just reply buying stock and wait
till some other hedge fund with deeper pockets than you squeezes you out.

And you give no value to their RIGS product currently in development? That is a BILLION + market that has already
shown great results in its initial trials back before they ran out of money in the 90's. If you give no value to RIGS you
shouldn't give any value to Lympho either, since it hasn't been approved yet either.

Neopprobe and its investors probably know lymphoseek and its pottential way. They weren't fully confident something
was going to happen, why would they sell their only revenue bearing business off? This essentially just leaves them
with $71 million dollars in cash and Lymphoseek/RIGS. No one would have sold off the gamma detection business if
there wasn't the utmost confidence by the board and its major investors that something were going to happen. If
anyone saw that Lymphoseek actually had a significant chance of failing you would keep this business with you to
keep the company afloat if Lymphoseek failed, especially given you still have RIGS in the bag. I think they are getting
lean to position themselves for a buyout.

this right? This piece will be trashed and forgotten if NEOP gets great reviews next week by the most qualified people
on the planet. However, if you are correct and the doctor's agree with you then I will tip my hat to you as well (I
seriously doubt you win this one)....


It's an interesting idea to go short right before such a huge event next week. This looks like a risky bet...FEAST or

I think you miss the point. The ASCO data is irrelevant. The market size for NEOP is simply too small to support the
current market cap. Lymphoseek could be the greatest product in the world, and it would not matter in the long run,
because the market size is simply too small. Martin's analysis is irrefutable on that point.

(1) Lymphoseek replaces sulphur Colloid + Blue dye. In above analysis only Sulphur Colliod prices are
included.


(2) There has been a huge increase in prices since 2005 due to shortage of radio tracer used in these tests
both for Lymphoseek and current products. Lymphoseek uses far less tracer so its cost is not much effected. 
(3) Current therapy has multiple documented side effects. Lymphoseek has none. Current technology has not
been approved by FDA for these tests. Any surgeon using non-FDA approved tracer (sulphur colloid) when
there is a FDA approved tracer with no side effects will be liable for huge court settlements. 
(4) Lymphoseek can be applied the previous day while sulphur colloid must be applied immediately before
operation. This has major cost implications  
(5) In cancer treatment the most important issue is - "did you remove all the cancerous tissue. Sulphur colloid
+ Blue dye tracer misses some cancerous tissue, while Lymphossek misses none. Do you think surgeons will
use old technology which has problems when new approved technology misses no problem tissue and be
liable for any misses? This is specially true when tracer costs are nominal such as $500 and it costs $5000
per hour to run an operating room.

Which market size is too small to support the market cap; the $15M in this article or the $450-$500M that
other analysts and the company state, before adding superiority pricing or the $3B market for RIGS?
Additionally, assuming FDA approval for Lymphoseek with a superiority designation, do you really think 15%
market penetration is all that will be achieved? Can you imagine the liability exposure with using a non-
approved inferior procedure that has a worse safety profile?

Author’s reply »  Lymphoseek can't replace sulfur colloid + blue dye because it has never been tested against
that combination. This renders Lymphoseek unapprovable.

James Emerson, Contributor
While it may be the "standard of care", Tc-99M Sulfur Colloid is not FDA approved as a diagnositc tool for
Lymph nodes. It is an off label use. The combination has never undergone FDA approved clinical trials for this
use; therefore, Lymphoseek never has to be tested against the combination. If Lymphoseek were to gain
approval, which is highly likely since it is a vast improvement over blue dye marking, Tc-99M marked sulfur
colloid would need to be compared to it to gain approval. Since Tc-99M sulfur colloid is a generic, it is highly
unlikely that any firm will undertake the expense of clinical trials.

This answer is a complete misrepresentation. The reason Lymphoseek was not tested against Blue Dye +
sulfur colliod combination is beacuse FDA will not approve such a test. FDA has never approved Sulfur
colloid for these tests, they have approved blue dye. All phase 3 tests must conform to FDA guidelines, you
can not just go and harm a few patients to do tests that are non approved ones. Once Lymphoseek is
approved it will become the the only FDA approved agent. Then watch how the physicians do not use it. Do
not ask technicians whether the procedure will be used, ask those surgeons who are responsible for ordering
the tests. If they will use non-FDA approved tests: 
(1) The hospital will not be reimbursed for the tests, they will have to eat its cost as they are doing right now. 
(2) The surgeon will be liable in a lawsuit for using a non-FDA approved test when a FDA approved one wass
available. This will be a massive liability. 
My prediction is that within one year of approval Lyphoseek will capture 100% of US market.

The more this guy talks, the more it demonstrates his lack of knowledge. I'm only responding because it
surprises me that a hedge fund with focus on healthcare is a little behind the times with regard to how deals
work in biotech land.


I'll let you in on a little secret: Profit share arrangements normally don't have upfront money attached to them
in biotech deals. The favorable aspect in this deal, is that there is milestone payouts for certain commercial
sales targets. Normally profit share arrangements don't have these arrangements.

point out that your above statement is completely false. I would estimate blue dye only in 30-40% of the cases. Also,

This will be my last article regarding Neoprobe simply because I have come to realize that no matter how much I, or
anyone else for that matter, writes about it, the bears will always misrepresent any company they want to and
manipulate its price. With that being said, those bursts of bearish movements always come back to reality when a
company has the fundamentals in place to keep moving forward. I could put in a lot more time into this but I have
decided that Neoprobe management will take care of it all this weekend at ASCO.


Now, I’m going to pick this bearish and incompetent article piece by piece.


Author: “The current standard of care for sentinel lymph node biopsy is the combination of a blue dye (isosulfan blue
or methylene blue) and a radioactive technetium-99 sulfur colloid. This combination results in the identification of a
sentinel lymph node upwards of 95% of the time[1].”


My Reply: Here is the author's reference piece for [1].

and/or blue dye. However, it is still undefined which reagent is more suitable for identifying sentinel lymph
nodes(seekingalpha.com/symbo...). Methods: A consecutive series of 640 breast cancer patients who underwent
SLNB at Keio University Hospital in Japan from January 2001 to June 2006 was analyzed. The SLN was identified by
a combination of technetium-99m tin colloid and isosulfan blue dye. The correlation between clinicopathological
factors and the distribution of radioisotope and blue dye was analyzed. A SLN found to be the single metastatic lymph
node by axillary lymph node dissection was considered as "true SLN", since this SLN was the only metastatic lymph
node among entire axillary nodes, suggesting it may be the first lymph node in a regional lymphatic basin that
received lymphatic flow from the primary tumor. 73 cases with "true SLN" were extracted to verify the efficiency of
radioisotope and blue dye as a tracer of SLN. Results: In 640 cases, the total number of SLNs successfully identified
was 1558 from 625 (97.8%) cases. SLNs showing both hot and blue were present in 491 cases (76.7%), whereas
blue nodes alone were present in 19 cases (3.0%) and the presence of hot nodes alone were detected in 115 cases
(18.0%) There was no significant correlation between clinicopathological features and the distribution of those
reagents to the SLNs. Among 73 "true SLN" cases, 70 (95.9%) cases were successfully mapped. In these cases, 48
(65.7%) "true SLN" showed both hot and blue, and 22 (30.1%) showed hot alone, however, there was no "true SLN"
showing blue alone. Conclusions: Addition of blue dye to radioisotope increased the successful mapping rate by
3.0%, but did not enhance the identification rate of "true SLN". Combination of radioisotope and blue dye is
considered to be a more useful methodology for detection of SLNs than either reagent alone, however under the
situation that one must be chosen, radioisotope should be better answer. 
----------------------...


Now, lets take a second to understand the purpose of this study and what it achieves. A closer look will reveal the
actual truth to what the author should have written. In order for a typical reader to understand this is to break down
this abstract to the basics.


Lets start with the term “true SLN”. “True SLN” is defined as the single metastatic (cancerous) lymph node and this is
determined through ALND (axillary lymph node dissection). ALND involves removing about 10-15 of the 30–60 lymph
nodes under the arm. Therefore, the “95 %” is misrepresented and only applies to the process of dissecting 10-15
lymph nodes under the arm and then examined under a microscope to determine if it is cancerous. This in no way
represents that the combination of sulfur colloid and blue dye detects 95% of sentinel lymph nodes as stated by the
author. Furthermore, as you continue to read the data shown, you will see that of these cases 73 of them were
identified as “true SLN”. These are the only ones we want to concentrate on because this is where it matters. Of these
73, only 48 were identified as “hot and blue”. This means only 65.7 % of the “true SLN”’s were picked up by the usage
of Blue Dye + Sulfur Colloid. Yes people, that means that approximately 1 out of 4 were missed. The study goes on to
show that of the 73 cases only 22 were picked up by sulfur colloid alone (30.1%) and none of the “blue alone” were
“true SLN”.


For the normal reader: In this study, Blue dye alone did not detect cancer 0% and Sulfur Colloid alone picked up
30.1% of cancerous lymphnodes and the combo of both picked up only 65.7%.


A Little more on Lymphoseek in regards to this topic: Lymphoseek is a proprietary radioactive tracing agent being
developed for use in connection with gamma detection devices in a surgical procedure referred to as Intraoperative
Lymphatic Mapping (seekingalpha.com/symbo...). The investigational radiopharmaceutical is designed to specifically
bind to lymphatic tissue. The mannose sub-units are substrates for receptor recognition and binding by mannose-

binding protein(mannan or manose binding lectin). This cell surface receptor (mannose receptor or CD206) is found in
high concentration on macrophages and dendritic cells in the lymphatic system. The DTPA side chains act as
chelating agents for labeling with Tc-99m [a]


Lymphoseek’s mannose moieties bind to CD206 mannose-binding receptors on the cell surfaces of dendritic cells and
macrophages in lymph nodes. The binding mechanism makes it more likely that the radiopharmaceutical agent will
remain bound in the sentinel node with low distal node uptake. Tc-99m colloids and blue dyes have no binding
properties to lymphatic tissue; therefore sentinel node uptake can be variable and more dependant on time post
injection. In addition, Technetium-99mulfur colloid is sold as a kit for preparation before use. The size and physical-
chemical properties of the sulfur colloid particles formed from the components of the kit can cause variation in its
biodistribution.[a]


The last 2 paragraphs are the key to what the whole purpose of Lymphoseek's purpose is. The purpose is to bind to
the Sentinal node and not pass through it. It is designed for this purpose and it accomplishes this task extremely well.
By accomplishing this task efficiently, it reduces patient morbidity eliminating the need to dissect 10-15 lymph nodes
when you only need to dissect the Sentinal Node.


The removal of tens of lymph nodes which is associated with significant increases in morbidity including; bleeding,
longer recovery, lymphedema (swelling from dysfunctional lymphatic system) and/or nerve damage.


Author:"It is commonly believed that this identification rate cannot be improved upon. There are many studies which
prove that the excision of just one or two sentinel lymph nodes accurately predicts the cancer status of the rest of the
axilla (armpit)."


My Reply: blah, blah, blah ...filler sentences


Author: "Obviously, as one removes more nodes, one gets closer to 100% accurate prediction of the axilla status. This
concept is called the “received operating characteristic” or ROC curve. It is very important to understand this concept.
As one removes and dissects more nodes, one will find more cancer.


The marginal benefit of doing so can be easily plotted on this ROC curve. One can reach 100% sensitivity at the cost
of lower specificity. The goal in any diagnostic is to balance the two, if possible. Both blue dyes and radioactive
colloids can be interpreted more loosely to remove more nodes—physicians know this, but choose to take just one or
two nodes as there is no benefit of doing more as per the ROC curve."


The task of needlessly dissecting normal and healthy lymph nodes via ALND because of the inefficiency from the
current combination of non fda approved products for these procedures is barbaric and absurd (however, it is
necessary at this time). Basically the author is saying that the more lymphnodes you remove the closer to 100%
accuracy you will have in detecting cancer .. duh..


So the author is basically saying dissect everything to detect whether cancer exists or not. Lets just throw away all the
work that has been done in the progress of ILM and SLNB and just hack away at everything just to be sure. No wait,
on second thought, lets stick to data. So here is some more...

American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (Z0011 trial) was published on February 9, 2011 in the Journal of
theAmerican Medical Association.7The objective of the study was to determine the effects of complete axillary lymph
node dissection (seekingalpha.com/symbo...) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast
cancer. This was a noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites enrolling 891 patients from May 1999 to December 2004.
All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by
sentinel lymph node biopsy (seekingalpha.com/symbo...) were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary
treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the
discretion of the treating physician. Overall survival was the primary end point, with a non-inferiority margin of a 1-
sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 in rder to indicate that SLNB alone is non-inferior to ALND. Disease free survival
was a secondary endpoint. Randomization was 445 patients toALND and 446 randomized to SLNB alone. The
median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLNB alone. The results among patients were the
use of SLNB alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival. In fact, though small, the survival rate for
SLNB alone was larger than ALND in the later years of the analysis. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up,
March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% with ALND and 92.5% with SLNB alone. 5-year disease-free
survival was 82.2% with ALND and 83.9% with SLNB alone. While the utility of axillary lymph node dissections may
be disputed, the importance of sentinel node biopsy procedures is only underscored by these results.

The rest of his thesis is gibberish. This hedge fund fool thinks he knows more then Cardinal Health, the Neoprobe
management, every analyst that has ever initiated coverage, the 25+ institutional holders, and every well informed
investor that has come to understand Neoprobe.


Final thoughts: I recommend people take a good 30 minutes and read through the research reports to stay informed
and on top of your investment. It is sad that as badly and irrelavant this thesis is, the idiot probably managed to make
millions covering his short position today with these scare tactics and misinformation. The fact that Seeking Alpha has
no expert review analysis on any written article is disgusting IMO.

By the way, the study compared Lymphoseek to blue dye alone because colloid is being used off-label and the FDA
would never approve a study using as its comparator, a non-approved substance. Lymphoseek, if approved, will
replace colloid as I suspect no respectable physician would choose an off-label product, and its inherent liability risks,
over one that has been approved. In addition, once the product is approved, it is clear that Neoprobe will immediately
attempt to expand its indications to other solid tumor cancers.


It is also quite comforting to know that all of the large holders of Neoprobe know that RIGS is worthless. I'd be very

another thing altogether to support them.

This piece has failed to accomplish it's goal. Anyone who has followed NEOP can see that the author of this article
does not address Rigscan, does not include the European market, does not include alternative uses of the technology
should it gain FDA approval, and the article also provides absolutely no support for its contention that Lymphoseek
will not gain FDA approval. The omissions, some of which the article points out at the beginning, is nothing more than
a nice try to torpedo a stock.

"Almost all of the value of Neoprobe is in their lymphatic mapping agent, Lymphoseek."


This is an accurate statement. But, the problem is that it appears you didn't do your research. Here's the main points
you need to consider:


1. The standard of care is an off-label use. If Lymphoseek gets FDA approval, they do get near 100% of the market,
because most physicians and hospitals will not use a product for off-label use instead of an FDA approved product.
They are also protected from competitors because of the long approval cycles for NDA.


2. The clinical trials that they have run, such as NEO3-05, do a direct comparison to the standard of care (blue dye),
and it performs better. It corresponds 97% with blue dye, has fewer false positives, finds more nodes and is easier to
administer.


3. They are going to make the argument that they same techniques apply to other cancers involving lymph nodes
(e.g., NEO3-06, which focuses on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). If they get this, it will then be extended
itself by further studies they are conducting (melanoma) and off-label use (colon, prostate, etc.).


4. You limit your analysis to the U.S. - which in itself makes your analysis worthless.


So, let's use your numbers. 146 million shares. A conservative estimate of a worldwide market of somewhere north of
$400 million across all countries. They have 50% profit sharing with distributors. So, likely earnings north of 2.73. I
generally look for stock prices around 10x earnings. So, potential stock price with Lymphoseek approval north of $25.


Then, for long term prospects you have RIGS, which is somewhere north of a $1 billion dollar market - although that's
probably at a 4+ year time horizon.

Author’s reply »  1) This statement is not correct. There are many diseases where off-label use dominates
despite approved agents. Hospitals are especially interested in cost savings and won't flock to Lymphoseek
when cheaper alternatives are available.


2) The standard of care is not blue dye, but a combination of blue dye and the more effective sulfur colloid.


3) We'll see how well that study goes.


4) I have ran many models including ex-US forecasts. The markets outside the US require more intensive
clinical trials and are even more reluctant to pay for products with no benefits.

5) $400m is not conservative given the entire imaging market for SLN is $50m. No, that number is wildly
aggressive. Second, $200m split and even after taxes would result in $150m, which by your numbers, which
are impossible to achieve, is $1.00 in EPS, or $10 fair value at a future date, or pretty much fairly valued at
the present time. Remember, your numbers are unachieveable. This is a great short.

1) True, there are many diseases where off-label use dominates despite approved agents. In fact, blue dye in
SLN mapping is a good example, where cheaper alternatives are used because studies have shown that
there is no statistical difference in which dye you use.


The problem here is that Lymphoseek does appear to do a better job of identifying cancerous lymph nodes,
and it is designed to be used as an intraoperative mapping agent. To quote one study:


"Because the tumor status of the regional lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor in patients with
early-stage breast cancer, accurate histopathologic assessment of these nodes is essential for optimal
management, including the selection of candidates for adjuvant systemic therapies."


caonline.amcancersoc.o...


So, if vital blue dye finds 60% of what Lymphoseek does and the variants are more or less as good as vital
blue dye, it is easy to see where this is going to go from approval, reimbursement, and patient care
perspectives. If I had cancer involving lymph nodes, I'd want the better mapping agent, particularly since
mapping is so important in determining what is the best treatment.


2. Which is used off label because studies have shown it is more or less equivalent to vital blue dye alone.
So, if it is the same and costs less, of course hospitals go for the cheaper option. But, the point here is that
Lymphoseek is arguing it is a better agent, and if doctors believe this initially and it is borne out by later
studies, it will get used. Period.


3. Yes, we will see here shortly.


4. You are aware that the studies like NEO3-06 have been cleared through the EMA as well? And that often
outside of the US and EU, the standards are less strict?


5. I made a mistake there in my quick calculation. It should have been $200m. Your $150m and $1.00 EPS
figures are fair enough. At current pricing, a +100% increase within the next year would, to my mind, warrant
the risk involved.


At the most, you've made an argument that it is too risky - and this will largely depend on your appetite for
risk. NEOP is within my range.


That said, your case for shorting is a weak one. It would make sense if you thought it was not going to get
FDA approval. But, you are arguing that the market isn't there, and if true, it might take a few years for that to
become apparent. It is certainly not going to happen in less that a year.

Martin, I completely agree with your argument here (but I do not agree with your AVNR patent argument.)


I am the tech at the hospital that injects the Technetium 99 - Sulfur Colloid for our lymphoscintigraphys. After injection,
the patient goes under the camera for about an hour of scan time (or much sooner if the sentinel node appears faster
on the screen.)After visualization of the node, the department then ships the patient over the same day surgery for
lymph node removal.


I can tell you from the experiences of working for a private hospital, I can tell you there is NO WAY that the surgeon
will decide one day, "Hey, lets try out this new product called lymphoseek." NO WAY NO HOW. Tc-99m sulfur colloid
is cheap, very effective, and has been in use FOR YEARS (all good points in your article.) Even a sales force of a
million strong would never be able to convince hospitals and surgeons and nuclear medicine departments to stray
from a near GOLD STANDARD PROCEDURE, especially the way hospitals are consolidating as of now and trying to
cut costs.


Now as for AVNR......I can only wish you best of luck in your arguments. The USTPO had a long time to review those
patents for AVNR (about two years.) I admit mistakes can be made, but as long as large respectable institutions are
holding, I will hold as well.

Author’s reply »  Thanks for your Neoprobe comment. I have surveyed many, many people like yourself who
all have the same fedback. I don't mean to talk out of school, but I am curious why you do so many
lymphoscitingraphies? My understand was the field was moving away from this...


Regarding AVNR I would pay close attention to prior art and double patenting. There's a famous quote that
"The USPTO would grant a patent to piece of toilet paper...". Most method patents are found invalid after
litigation. I would be wary!!!

In regard to to your question, I believe the answer is very doctor dependent.


We do the imaging portion of the procedure if the ordering physician requests it. We don't do too many of
these procedures in general, maybe 1 or 2 a week, sometimes none at all, even for extended periods. When
we do image, we put it on a film and send it with the patient so the surgeon can get a "general idea" of where
the node is, right before operating. I suppose that having the image right before surgery is just one more
confirmation that some employ for correlation purposes. The surgeon may also employ a Geiger counter
during surgery to identify the node that is giving off the strongest activity of radioactive sulfur colloid (which
would be another confirmation of the sentinel node) I believe we only have a couple doctors that request the
images at our hospital (600 bed hospital in an affluent metro area outside a major city.) Most just want the
injection and then the patient is good to go.


In all practicality though, they may identify the sentinel node and want to test the pathology within that node,
but if the patient has a hx of cancer or the particular case is a strong suggestion of possible cancer, the

surgeon is going to remove the sentinel node along with a bunch of other nodes. I would say rarely do they
"just remove the sentinel node," they are going to take out any node in the vicinity and nearby, and then run
pathology on all of them, especially in cases of breast cancer, where the node is going to be located in the
axillae. For melanoma's, depends on the location in the body.


So while NEOP may claim that lymphoseek can best identify the sentinel node, in practicality who cares? The
surgeons are going to go in there and take out a bunch of nodes and run pathology on all of them. Using
sulfur colloid, dye, and a Geiger counter already do an excellent job during this entire procedure, and nothing
is going to change that.


And like you said with your revenue numbers, they won't make a lot of money with this if they capture some
market. Lets say that there was a technetium shortage never before seen, catastrophic levels. Even so, there
would not be enough procedures total in the US that would support high revenues (unless the ozone layer
completely dissipates and everyone starts developing melanomas.)


Good article though, good research. Any chance you could shoot me an e-mail and tell me what is really
going on with AVNR. :)

I was specifically quoting and replying to the above posters comment, not replying about overall stock price
performance.


As has been shown above in comments, or below, back in 2011, Blue Dy already costed more than LS, at
600.00 per dose in 2011. So if hospitals are worried about detection rates vs cost, LS would be a superior

product from that perspective (detects better and costs less).


The only way LS would be more expensive would be if only SC was used--and that detection rate is not good,
and is not even approved by the FDA for usage--it's off label.


Today, LS sells for 500 a dose, and has gotten no push-back from buyers.


 
On the other hand, I'm sorry you got burned. There was no reason for the price to go down like t has, but on
the other hand, if you got in at the new lower price, in the 1-2 buck level, you will probably come out really
well. If the company performs like it has been, even if one got in over $4, they will probably make some good
money in the coming months.


And Marty was obviously incorrect about LS sales and future success.


Consider that 50% of revenue goes to Cardinal. That would mean LS revenue was 21M in 2015. If they hit
guidance in 2015, that will be a total of 50M revenue from LS alone in 2016.

SC *did* gain FDA approval a year or two ago - unless you're talking about for SLN use, for which LS is the
only approved agent.


As for throwing good money after bad, not gonna do it - have no faith in current management, and recent
shareholder revolt showed I'm not the only one who feels that way.

Shorting strength is a very dangerous game and while I can't argue with your fundamental analysis...it doesn't always
matter in this game of buying/selling stocks. Emotions (fear and greed) play a big part and I just don't think it's smart
to short this until we get a trend change. And while the uptrend is weakening...it's still an uptrend. At the very least,
allow it to make a lower high before shorting.

Quote of a long term NEOP investor (DBBuyer):


I couldn't stand it....


I knew I said I wouldn’t rebut that SeekingAlpha article, and I don‘t plan to. But I can’t believe all of the incorrect,
misleading and omitted facts.


First, he talks about the current standard for SLNB being the combination of Blue Dye + Sulphur Colloid. Of course,
he doesn’t go into the respective weaknesses and shortcomings of each agent, or the reason that the industry felt the
need to use BOTH in combination, but that’s a completely separate discussion.


However, to arrive at his conclusion that Lymphoseek’s maximum market potential is only $16,000,000 he bases
Lymphoseek’s value on the 2005 wholesale price to Sulphur Colloid only.


He states “It is likely about 200,000 sentinel lymph node biopsies are done for breast cancer in the United States
annually[2]. The AWP of sulfur colloid is $53.20[3]. Liberally assuming 300,000 procedures are done, so as to include
melanoma and head and neck cancer, the total opportunity for Lymphoseek in the United States is $16 million.”


First, he cites the price of only one of the two agents, and of course he chooses the cheaper of the two. He quotes a
price of $53.20 for Sulphur Colloid, with his reference being Noridian Medicare Radiopharmaceutical Pricing for 2005.
HCPCS Code A9520.


I looked it up. It reads:


Code A9520 - Tc99-m Sulphur colloid (TSC). 95% AWP. $71.25


It was $71.25, not $53.50. He lied. 
Ref: www.noridianmedicare.c......


Then he used 2005 prices, not 2011 prices. Current prices range from $111.75 to $137.50 depending on your source.
Taglich used an avg. of $130 for their income estimations.


Next, the 2005 price he’s quoting is the WHOLESALE number. Manufacturers charge that price. That price is then
marked up to a retail price that the patient is charged. How much? I don’t know, but 2X isn't uncommon. 
As he pointed out, the current standard is a combination of Blue Dye + Sulphur Colloid. But he purposely neglected to
add in the price of the Blue Dye component. I looked it up the current price of Isosulfan Blue.

US Surgical Lymphazurin Isosulfan Blue Dye, 1%, 6/bx 
Your Price: $6,504.00


Ref: www.medexsupply.com/la......


"LYMPHAZURIN™ 1% (isosulfan blue) is supplied as a 5 ml single dose vial..."


DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION


“LYMPHAZURIN™ 1% (isosulfan blue) is to be administered subcutaneously, one-half (1/2) ml into three (3)
interdigital spaces of each extremity per study. A maximum dose of 3 ml (30 mg) isosulfan blue is, therefore,
injected…”


Ref: 
dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/d......


A box of Isosulfan Blue contains six (6) vials containing 5 ml each (30 ml total). Although it appears that a vial is
intended for use as a single dose, at the 3ml max per patient described in the dosing, it’s feasible to squeeze 10
patient treatments out of a single, six-vial box.


That’s a Blue Dye COST of $650 per patient, and I’m certain that some sort of markup is made by the
physician/hospital on the cost of the Blue Dye.


Compared to the combined cost of Blue Dye ($650 cost) + Sulphur Colloid (~$130) I believe Lymphoseek’s estimated
cost of $400 is going to be quite reasonable… especially with superiority labeling.


In summary:


1) He ignored the Cardinal distribution agreement calling for Neoprobe to receive 50% of the RETAIL price


2) Instead, he based revenues on the WHOLESALE price for Sulphur Colloid ONLY


3) He used 2005 wholesale prices


4) The 2005 price he quoted was wrong


5) He omitted the cost of Blue Dye altogether in his calculations, and;


6) To compound his errors further, he used U.S. Lymphoseek sales only to derive the value of NEOP stock, ignoring
the ex-U.S. markets, other indications, etc.


I’ve only scratched the surface, too…

documented values posted above. That is much better than responding with different incorrect values than
you posted in original article.


If the calculations of DDBuyer are correct, then you are either incompentent or misleading. My guess is

Thats not the same sulfur colloid for lymphatic imaging. The non filtered version is approved in other imaging

Scans are bypassed by many surgeons due to logistics. Surgeons want these patients yesterday, and the time it
takes to find the nodes and route through nuclear medicine is very annoying to many surgeons. Also smaller regional
hospitals don't have the same bandwidth as larger hospitals. A larger hospital may have many cameras, and nuclear
techs. With more cameras and nuclear techs, some nuclear depts don't have a huge burden to be efficient. The
above efficiency burden is especially true for 1 camera depts with heavy cardiology business. You have to flip the
room over fast to keep wait times down. Some of the bigger hospitals will have other cameras experiencing dead time
so it doesn't matter as much on nuclear end. Overstaffed nuclear departments don't feel the burdon so much.


There has been a trend of facilities performing the scans with a 15 minute time limit. If you see the node great it
means more info. If not oh well the surgeons ready.


The need for speed here reminds me of many nuclear techs that kept saying they wouldn't use lexiscan. Lexiscan
stole over 50% of the market rather quickly despite the naysayers. The sister hospitals in my hospital network kept
telling me how they wouldn't perform lexiscan. Funny thing one month later they were all using it.


Will have to watch the reimbursement front.

Overall, this was an excellent discussion. Martin answered questions and countered objections.


At the end of the day, results matter most. Here, Martin made the best case, and his bet proved right. Nice work!


Presuming shares cross the 200 MA of $2.91, NEOP could drop back to $2, possibly lower.


The chart says it all. Like it or not, this stock is broken. At this point, the bull case for NEOP is not persuasive. From
my view, there's no reason to buy or hold shares.


Unfortunately, the harder heads among us are likely to end up disappointed.

Justin, Martin refused to answer 80% of the counter points of DDBUYER...go back and read this:


In summary:


1) He ignored the Cardinal distribution agreement calling for Neoprobe to receive 50% of the RETAIL price


2) Instead, he based revenues on the WHOLESALE price for Sulphur Colloid ONLY


3) He used 2005 wholesale prices


4) The 2005 price he quoted was wrong

With the filing Shkeli presented to the FDA, I can't see any other reality than that this guy has now stepped so far over

one thing to take a position and support it publicly, but to actively become engaged in manipulation of the market,
government responsibilities of the FDA, and a few other issues, seems obviously something that can get you

the 2011 ASCO meeting. Dr. Sabel noted that in his opinion the choice of vital blue dye (VBD) was not the most
appropriate control for the NEO3-09 trial because surgeons do not use VBD alone when performing intraoperative
lymphatic mapping (ILM) procedures. Rather, VBD is employed in combination with sulfur colloid (SC), a radiolabel
that is not FDA approved and is used off-label for ILM. Dr. Sabel suggested that the most appropriate trial design
required to demonstrate the potential therapeutic and pharmaco-economic benefits of Lymphoseek would be to
conduct a head-to-head study comparing Lymphoseek + VBD to SC + VBD. In our opinion, such a study is feasible
and should be conducted in a Phase 4 post marketing manner to further drive experience with and penetration of
Lymphoseek into the ILM market.


… But FDA Has Already Answered Dr. Fred Cope stated that the potential to use SC was raised during Phase 3
design 
discussions with the FDA. At these meetings, the FDA adopted the position that since SC is not approved by the
agency, 
any use of this agent as control to support the approval of Lymphoseek would not be reasonable or possible. Further, 
because SC is not FDA approved, no standardization exists for its use in ILM, which would additionally complicate the 
conduct of a Phase 3 trial with SC as a control. Given these considerations, the FDA and Neoprobe concluded that
VBD 
would be the most appropriate control against which to compare Lymphoseek.  
A Hedge Fund who is Short Shares of NEOP Files a Citizen’s Petition – Things That Make You Go Hmmm? 
Yesterday, in what can only be viewed as an act of hubris, hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli of MSMB capital filed
on 
behalf of himself (and we assume a group of short sellers), a citizen’s petition imploring that the FDA not approve or 
consider approving Lymphoseek. While we are big proponents of the open market system, and believe that long and
short 
investors have a right to voice their opinions, we believe that anyone who thinks that they can influence the Food and
Drug 
Administration may have ulterior motives, to say the least. At the end of the day, we are confident the FDA will
approve OR 
reject the application based on the data and quality of the NDA, and not on the 9 page plea of a fund manager sitting
at a 
desk in NY. Potential motivation for this individual? At the end of his own citizen’s petition, he states “I am a hedge
fund 
manager who will benefit financially from a decline in the stock price of the corporation developing Lymphoseek.” Can
the 
SEC say “Conflict of interest?”


Quick Take We are reiterating our Market Outperform / Speculative Risk rating and our target price of $7 based on a 
discounted revenues and earnings per share valuation methodology. Given the remarks by management at the ASCO 
analyst event, as well as the highly robust Phase 3 data package for Lymphoseek, we believe that Lymphoseek will
garner 
FDA approval. We believe that a post-marketing study along the lines of that suggested by Dr. Sabel and also echoed
by 
Dr. Wallace would be a valuable next step following FDA approval to drive the value proposition of Lymphoseek over

sulfur 
colloid. As indicated by Dr. Wallace at the investor event, such a study could incorporate pharmaco-economic
endpoints


08 Jun 2011, 11:37 AM 


Roger Newman, Contributor
We recently attended the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, where we attended the
Neoprobe poster discussion session and the analyst event held later on June 6th. This note attempts clarify some of
the controversy surrounding Lymphoseek.


Sulfur Colloid is Not FDA Approved. As we previously described in our initiation report (lifesciadvisors/client...),
lymphatic mapping procedures for sentinel lymph node identification originally used Lymphazurin™ (isosulfan blue)
1% or patent blue V 2.5%. Lymphazurin™ is the only FDA approved agent indicated for lymphatic vessel delineation.
Tc-sulfur colloid was originally designed in 1969 and approved for imaging of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, but
was never approved by the US FDA for use in lymphoscintigraphy, lymphatic mapping, or lymph node biopsy
procedures. It is very important to note that while the use of Tc-sulfur colloid, in conjunction with blue dye, has
emerged as the preferred method of lymphatic mapping, the requirements for FDA approval of new lymphatic
mapping agents call for comparisons to FDA approved agents. In this case, vital blue dye (VBD) is the only approved
agent and therefore the appropriate comparator.


ASCO Discussion Session. We attended the discussion session at ASCO in Chicago where Dr. Michael Sabel talked
about the results of the NEO3-09 study, which were presented in a poster earlier in the day. While Sabel noted the
high level of Lymphoseek performance versus VBD, he also noted that going forward he would like to see
Lymphoseek performance characterized relative to Tc-sulfur colloid. While this may be a relevant and important
question related to Lymphoseek’s ultimate success in the marketplace, it is more of a commercial question than a
regulatory question - an important distinction. At the end of the day, a head-to-head comparison of Lymphoseek and
Tc-sulur colloid is not required for FDA approval.


NDA Acceptance Now a Major Catalyst. We are surprised by the controversy of whether or not Neoprobe chose the
correct comparator in its Phase III studies, as Lymphazurin™ is the only FDA approved agent, and, hence, the only
agent the FDA could sanction as a comparator. We suspect that FDA’s acceptance of the Lymphoseek NDA
submission, which is expected to occur approximately 30 days following filing, will help to resolve the controversy. If
the NDA is accepted, the FDA will review the filling as complete. Acceptance of the NDA should lead to resolution of
this controversy sooner (~3Q) rather than later.


Commercial Advantages of Lymphoseek. The advantages of Lymphoseek over VBD have been showcased in the
results of the NEO3-05 and NEO3-09 Phase III studies. The advantages of Lymphoseek over Tc-sulfur colloid were
highlighted by the Company at their ASCO analyst event (neoprobe.com/ASCO2011.asp), and include rapid
clearance from injection site, high retention in first draining nodes, rapid lymph node uptake, flexible administration (as
Dr. Sabel noted), low radiation absorption, cGMP compliance and “on-label” use. Dr. Anne Wallace also noted less
injection site pain as a major advantage over Tc-sulfur colloid. While it is fair for doctors like Dr. Sabel and for
investors to want to see these attributes highlighted in a “head-to-head” study against Tc-sulfur colloid, these trials will
ultimately be done as Phase IV “marketing studies,” not as registration studies.

Arguments for Commercial Success. The practice of using off-label Tc-sulfur for lymphatic mapping is acceptable
when there are no alternatives. The situation could change dramatically, however, with the approval of Lymphoseek.
Upon approval, Lymphoseek would be the only radiopharmaceutical approved for lymphatic delineation. Obviously,
there are several unknowns, which make it hard to predict the level of commercial success. These unknowns include
drug price, levels of reimbursement, adoption rates, expansion into other types of cancer and the either real or
perceived clinical and legal liabilities associated with continued use of the off-label Tc-sulfur colloid. In addition to the
clinical arguments for replacing the off-label agent, there may be a strong legal argument for the widespread adoption
of Lymphoseek. Doctors and hospitals may not want to risk being sued for prescribing an off-label product (when
something goes wrong) when Lymphoseek is the FDA approved radiopharmaceutical.

Intelligent_Investor
Martin, 
Explain your rationale in using the price of sulfur colloid in the modeling of the market size. The drug, regardless of
the validity of the comparison, is compared to Blue dye. The price of blue dye is not $57 (although you quote a 2009
price, during an obvious recession).


Second, assume your contention is correct and the combination is the proper comparable designation. Would you not
then include the price of the combination such that blue dye + sulfur colloid would designate the size of the market?


Third, do you think (in your philanthropic interest) that the FDA could or should approve the comparison of a
developmental drug to a combination that is not FDA approved? You note that the standard of care for some diseases
is an off label treatment. The claim, unsubstantiated, I will take as true; however, can you show any instance where
the FDA has requested a developmental drug be tested against this standard of care? Your point seems more an
issue with Neoprobe getting sales rather than the drug being approved.


Being that this is your article and not mine I find it fair to make the majority of my post questions.

The Intelligent Investor


An honest response would be appreciated on all questions, specifically on the last question.

$NEOP - Line in the sand - common front against shorts 
bit.ly/mxv90k


This is a war.


As all wars, longs are losing this one because we are fragmented and do not have a common front.


Shrekli chose this stock to short because there is very limited institutional ownership, and he knew retail investors
would panic and sell as losses mount.


However, reading this board, the Oldtimers board, and Twitter, it is clear to me there is a core of insightful long term
investors, that really understand the science and regulatory path for Lymphoseek and Rigs. This core is buying on the
dip, but in a disorganised way.


Therefore, I make a call here to all serious investors to join in a common front against the market manipulators such
as Shrekli. I refuse to be the victim of this war, waiting for the SEC to come to the rescue.


We have 2 days to get organised before the short sale restrictions are lifted again and the attack resumes. Let's
create a "social network hedge fund". This is the plan:


1) All of you who are planning to buy, let's set our good till cancelled buy orders at $3.05 before Friday. Traders have
highlighted this as a support level, and the stock indeed bounced at that price today. By setting our buy orders there
we will benefit additionally of TA-driven traders. If we all do this, we should see an insurmountable wall of buy orders
build up at $3.05, "scaring our enemies and giving us courage"


2) Let us make the pledge to not sell a single share below $5.50. This is the point where Shkreli started shorting. If he
shorts at $3.05 (point 1) but knows he won't be able to buy back till $5.50 he might think it twice. We can thus also
take advantage of the Russell reconstitution, that will greatly increase the amount of institutional investors that have to
buy and hold the stock. Decreased offer of stock on sale will make it more expensive to buy, and could squeeze
Shrekli and other opportunistic shorts.


3) Make sure your brokerage is not lending your shares for shorting. If they are lent, demand them to be restituted to
you and blocked from future lending. That will choke Shrkeli's firepower. bit.ly/kD5wPV


4) Let's request in the coming shareholder meeting to use part of the $30M proceeds of the sale of gamma device
business to repurchase shares below $4. $15M should be enough to finance LS to market and restart Rigs, so the
company could use the other $15M in short term to repurchase shares. This would compound effect of point 2,
especially if we get it into the agenda soon. Write a mail to NEOP to request this.


If you are with me, promote this post in any way you can, and place your buy orders at $3.05. Fellow $NEOP
shareholders, we could make history here!

If you look at the shares sold short in each peak of attacks (every two days or so), the number of shares sold
is not that high, about 300K.


So we just need 300 people, each buying 1,000 shares at $3.05, to make a stand.


This reminds me of the battle of the Thermopylae, hopefully this will end better!

www.internalmedicinene...


"SAN ANTONIO – The development of a serum glycoprotein microarray has led to the discovery of four proteins for
which antibodies significantly predict nodal metastases in patients with melanoma.


If validated, the data could form the basis of a blood test to select patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy, Dr. Michael
Sabel said during a symposium sponsored by the Society of Surgical Oncology.


In an internal validation cohort of 79 patients with newly diagnosed melanoma, 22 patients (28%) had serum
antibodies to acid ceramidase (ASAH1), cathepsin D (CTSD), or lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) that were
significantly associated with being node negative (P value less than .0001; hazard ratio, 0.173).


"This isn't a small percentage of patients, so if validated, this test could significantly reduce the number of patients to
whom we offer sentinel node biopsy," he said in an interview. "

Bingo! Dr. Sabel is a paid Hack involved in research with Merck Oncology on a potential future' serum test that would
lower the number of Sentinel Node Biopsies done, thus directly effecting revenue for Lymphoseek for Melanoma

Cardinal Health has distribution links all over the world, and in the US there are about 230,000 cases of breast cancer
per year, and it's 1.5m worldwide. This isn't even including melanoma and the other types of cancer it detects. All of
these cases are going to want lymphoseek to confirm their mammograms because it is more likely to be accurate.
