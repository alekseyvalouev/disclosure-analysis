Why I Significantly Increased My Lumber Liquidators Short Position In
The Last Two Days
Mar. 6, 2015 1:56 PM ET112 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


I added materially to my short position on Wednesday and yesterday.


Millions of LL’s past, present and future customers are aware of the formaldehyde
issue – and they are freaking out based on numerous anecdotal stories I’m hearing.


I think it’s very likely that LL’s margins will quickly fall to the 4-8% range they’d
always been in.


After not trading the stock at all since early October last year – I didn’t want there to be
any questions about my trading in advance of the 60 Minutes story (you think nearly five
months is conservative enough? ;-) – I added materially to my short position on
Wednesday and yesterday, such that it is now a 3.8% position, which is a very large for a
short for me.


Allow me to explain why:


I’m not even trying to hazard a guess at what LL’s liabilities might be (though I think it’s
likely that they’ll be far more than enough to swamp the company, making the stock a
zero) because I don’t have to have an opinion on this to have this be my largest short
today. My rationale is as follows:


On the revenue side, this story has been picked up by a ton of local news outlets across
the country, so millions of LL’s past, present and future customers are aware of the
formaldehyde issue – and they are freaking out based on numerous anecdotal stories I’m
hearing: installers saying most of their jobs have been cancelled, contractors swearing to
customers that they’ll never use LL’s products ever again, etc. This leads me to believe
that LL’s sales ($1.047 billion last year) will take a major, lasting hit, no matter what spin
the company puts out there. How big of a hit and for how long? Who knows. But it will be
very material I think.


On the expense/margin side, the company faces major issues:


Legal and compliance costs going through the roof immediately;

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2980746-why-i-significantly-increased-my-lumber-liquidators-short-position-in-the-last-two-days 2/26


Government penalties/sanctions associated with Lacey Act violations (i.e., buying
hardwoods that were illegally harvested in Siberia) (by the way, the formaldehyde
scandal makes it much more likely that the government will act forcefully in this area,
now that they know the company is a bad actor in other areas); and
Likely massive (though unquantifiable) contingent liabilities.


But even ignoring all of this, at the very least LL now has to of course start sourcing its
products legally, which I think are likely to bring margins back to historical levels (if not
below them). This chart shows LL’s operating margin going back 11 years (all the data
CapitalIQ had):


This chart captures what was a key factor in my initial short thesis: since when does a
commodity business, competing against giants like Home Depot and Lowe’s, with an
operating margin consistently between 4-8%, suddenly (in less than two years) more than
double margins? That’s so unusual and inexplicable that I figured they had to be cheating
(and was I ever right!).


Thus, I think it’s very likely that LL’s margins, which were already starting to return to
historical levels in 2014, will quickly fall to the 4-8% range they’d always been in (and I’m
being very generous in excluding a possibly massive hit to sales and skyrocketing
expenses due to the formaldehyde scandal).

So where might that take the stock, even before the contingent liabilities start to hit? Well,
as of last week (pre-crisis), 2015 earnings estimates were $2.74, very close to peak
earnings of $2.77 in 2013. I’d be shocked if LL earned $2 this year – and, if so, a 10
multiple would be a stretch in light of declining earnings, a tidal wave of lawsuits (even if
most get thrown out or settled for an affordable amount), etc. So that would be a $20
stock, down 40% from today’s level around $33.


Applying a more realistic scenario, I think the company might earn only $1.50 (and I truly
think I’m being generous here) and trade at 6x this amount, leaving the stock at $9, down
73% from here. (I haven’t quite picked that number out of thin air, as Herbalife, another
tainted company I’m short, is currently trading at 6.6x peak earnings of $4.91 in 2013.)


In summary, I don’t have to have an opinion today on whether LL’s stock is a zero. All I
have to believe is that it likely has huge downside from here – and that there’s only a small
chance of meaningful positive news flow that could run it up against me. (I’m very
cognizant of what happened to HLF after it tumbled after the first major wave of negative
publicity – that run-up was very painful for a lot of shorts, including me. But I just don’t see
a Carl Icahn/Dan Loeb/Bill Stiritz getting involved here, nor the company reporting great
numbers for the next few quarters and/or buying back a lot of stock. The only real danger I
see is a short-term short squeeze – there is now a huge short interest – perhaps triggered
by some investors believing (foolishly) the positive things the company will surely say next
Thursday on its scheduled conference call – but I don’t worry too much about short-term
volatility.)


In summary, when LL’s stock gets down to the high end of my range ($20), I can re-
evaluate based on the information I have then about what to do. Until then, however, it’s
an easy decision to load up on my short position.

Congratulations on your thesis so far.


My concern is the LL press release will indicate a balanced assessment of what is really going on here. Already it
seems clear that 60 minutes was intent on your side of the thesis, and selectively cherry picked the information for
maximum impact.


What % of their total volume is this flooring you are referring to?


The negative rhetoric has reached a fever pitch of redundancy, and to imply LL executives are evil people consciously
poisoning consumers is dubious and may pose great risk to your followers.


One of the greatest misuses of statistics is to isolate samples in a small selection that fit the thesis.


06 Mar 2015, 02:17 PM


MoMoInvestor
I believe the total volume is somewhere in the 11% range... but why does that matter ?


It isn't the loss of this business that is relevant - it's the damage to the Company reputation, the amount of this
product installed at customers' sites which may need to be torn up and replaced, not to mention the lawsuits
from those claiming that the product caused illness/injury.


I don't believe for a second you haven't considered the above... this will all come to a head when California
regulators chime in...

Wow if that s true …..follow the money!!!


06 Mar 2015, 03:25 PM


chris_dress
Does that mean, that given a "balanced assessment, that you are ready to buy/recommend LL as a place to
safely shop for a new floor? For your children or grandchildren?


Unless one lived in a cave or was extremely dumb, why would anyone buy from this company anymore?
Given that, why would anyone own stock in a company whose customers from this company anymore?


They have $90,000,000 in the bank to survive with...that is it.


Unless you live in a cave, what reason would a sane individual own this stock?

Mr. Tilson's short position has made him a few bucks but as with the BP spill, heart problems with Monster
drinks, etc, the memory fades, LL will defend itself and them Mr. Tilson's few bucks will be spent covering
that's just reality

This guy Tilson is simply inflating the truth to make some money, like a con artist, he's made money causing
the innocent bystanders (the investors) to get their necks slashed so he can buy a yacht, hey I guess that's
the game, but he is no "good" guy, in fact he's a creep whose short position will cause him to get burned
when the stock price shoots up the other way, I've seen it with the Monster beverage co. etc, just watch, his
fear mongering and talltales will come back to bite him in his wallet

Whitney,


I'd like to respectfully suggest that you offer Xuhua Zhou a job. He certainly seems to me to have earned himself an
opportunity with a firm that can compensate him appropriately and make the highest and best use of his talents.


I don't know him or know if he is in the market for a job, but considering that he was described in the media as an
individual investor trading in his own account, the suggestion makes sense to me.

I just want to see the guy get something tangible and significant out of his work on LL. He is getting credit at
least, and that's largely thanks to Mr. Tilson who gave him credit very openly.

Mr. Tylson, I have a lot of respect for you. I too have a short position on HLF. However, you seem to be a little cagey
in this article. You stated that you increased your short "materially" on LL and that it now represents 3.8% of your
portfolio. What do these two facts mean exactly? It's hard to tell for me. I wish you can just state the number of shares
you shorted yesterday and Wednesday and the percent increase in the position. Then we can clearly assess weather
you are really showing commitment on your short even at this depressed level or you just trying to make a headline.
To be honest I am not able to make the distinction due to your evasiveness on the numbers.


06 Mar 2015, 04:28 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Ummm.. A. Gidey,


Rather than calling the author "a little cagey", perhaps you could read both articles.


Whitney wrote in his last article that it was a 2.6% position on March 4th. As of today it is a 3.8% position.


How is that at all evasive? It's about as specific as one can get.


06 Mar 2015, 04:49 PM


bazooooka
Tilson had previously implied that his LL short was as small as 1% of his portfolio when he first started
shorting (read his old and recent letters). Even with the decline in this stock he has likely near doubled his
exposure as he learns how deep the rabbit hole goes. That's "materially" in my book.

3 Reasons Goldman Sachs Still Likes LL: 
1- The firm reduced the price target from $60 to $40 per share 
2- They now expect earnings of $2.35/Share, down from $3.00/Share. 
3- They cut the revenue estimates for 2015 from $1,165.9 million to $1,087.5 million

Is it possible that increasing your short position *after* the 60 Minutes story means that you didn't have real
confidence in the (flimsy) story--not until you heard the roar of the crowd and the stock plummeted?


Have you thought about short-selling automakers and teaming up with 60 Minutes for a story on poisonous offgassing
in new car interiors (fondly called the "new car smell")? Lots of junk-science to quote. Lots of fear of chemicals to be
stirred up, including chemicals far more dangerous than formaldehyde. The public loves a good 15-minute "gotcha"
news story.


Wait--the auto companies have piles of money, lawyers, lobbyists, and politicians in their pockets. Never mind.

This whole thing is based on CARB (California Air Resource Board) regulation and standards. They are the one who
are monitoring the wind and directions of Bovine gas on the cattle ranches of California. A bunch of total Nut jobs. In
the whole country CA is the only state that has come up with these crazy standards. I have not seen any credible
scientific report and analysis, what is really the danger of the formaldehyde in these floor boards. Can someone
please educate the reading audience? If these formaldehyde boards are that bad, why is it not regulated by any other
state or the federal government?


06 Mar 2015, 07:12 PM


ArnieW
So are you saying CARB is flawed? Or are the lawmakers in CA flawed?


In any case if the law was broken, then there must be a remedy.


I would be afraid to short the stock as they may have legal defenses that can allow them to delay things for
years.


As I said before, I know that formaldehyde gases can dissipate over time and the laminated floors could pass
the required levels when additional curing takes place over time...

@rphaider You would have to ask the state and/or federal governments that don't do this. I'm not a

chris_dress and pbanik, considering histrionics like yours and decent reasoning from RJM2 & A Giddy below,
I have bought 2 years' call of LL for $40.00 Strike. I see it no different than previous Hysteria about BP's Deep
Horizon or EXXON for Exxon Valdez or Toyota for its Prius break failing story. The impact of these stories
always creates a hysteria and gets blown out of proportion. There is a lot at stake here and like any one else,
LL will regroup and respond to crisis and cloud will clear out, unless they are totally incompetent. In that case
my bet will be toast.

obsessed with this story on seeking alpha? Hi whitey Tilson are there any other investing ideas you are so passionate
about on the long side for those of us that don't borrow shares?


06 Mar 2015, 09:56 PM

So, from the above comments, I can estimate that Mr. Tilson shorted approximately 23 k shares or less than $1mm
after the 60 minute report came out. I will leave to the readers to decides if that justifies all those bold statements of
making "significant" short bets by a hedge fund manager of Mr. Tilson's caliber. For me, when I read his comments
here and all over the financial news, I thought he had betted $100mm. A bet of less than $1mm wouldn't draw the
headline that a "significant" bet makes. I am a notorious short seller, which makes me good at catching these types of
word gymnastics from analysts and corporate management. We see these types of true yet misleading comment to
support a position by people like Tim Ramey for HLF and countless others for AMZN. It appears to me that Mr. Tilson
noticed the decline in LL stock price running out of gas on Friday and decided to go on the airwaves to sustain the
momentum (btw, I support people that go public with their short thesis, I just expect them to be fully transparent).


Another true yet misleading statement by Mr. Tilson was his attempt to support an outrageous price of $9 for LL. What
he did was classic Tim Ramey "creative" analysis. He said that LL can go down to $9 based on a new PE of 6 and a
reduced earnings estimate of $1.50 from $2.70. This he said is reasonable because HLF, another company with legal
issues, is trading at 6.6 PE of its 2013 earnings. If you missed the trickery here; let me point it out. HLF has a much
lower earnings in 2014 than 2013 and most reasonable people expect it's earnings to be even lower in 2015. Mr.
Tilson picked 2013, the best earning year for HLF, and compared it to his 2015 forecast for LL. I will be honest, I never
expected this from Mr. Tilson but it happened. This is classic Gene Munster. Se la vie...


As I stated earlier, I am a notorious short seller because I haven't seen many bargains. I am short GPRO, HLF and
TSLA and frequently try to short AMZN. I made my first long bet in a longtime this Wednesday and Thursday. I sold
put options on LL both days. My bet is based on the astronomical implied volatility on the stock and expectation that

decision on selling puts. Even he is feeling the momentum against the stock evaporating. We shall see.

I hope you sold a put spread to guard against a possible chapter 11. Also, you don't say the strike and date of
your puts...for a person that seems to demand specifics from Mr. Tilson, you seem to have your own brand of
caginess going on!

A. Did Tilson buy any puts/sell any calls on $LL? He could use options to synthetically add to his short
position.

Matt Stewart, Contributor
I have some questions:


1) If the Chinese Mills defrauded LL, can liability be pushed to this counterparty? What, if any, insurance does LL
have to deal with this sort of scenario?


2) In the event that damages need to be paid, wouldn't creditors want to see LL continue as a going concern v. try to
tap a bankrupt estate?


3) What % of inventory on hand would have to be written-off? Again...would these amounts not get pushed back to
trade creditors?


4) Can crisis PR salvage the brand? eg. Tylenol scare, BP, etc. Don't people in America love to give second chances?


5) Assuming they could clean-up the damage, what is the earnings power of the company?


For sure, the wolves are circling. Q. is, does the company have any escape routes or not?


Finally...do you have to lick the hardwood to get sick? The tone of the 60 minutes piece sounds a bit alarmist. Have
there been any homeowners who have taken ill?

Matt, great questions. LL has built up some good will with their sponsorship on public broadcasting as well as
help to non-profits and children's groups.


I agree with you that the 60 minutes piece, may be looked upon as overly alarmist.


LL may have documents from their Chinese suppliers which may absolve them of blame, and shift the blame
to the "greedy suppliers".


watching the market movement of LL, the price does fluctuate. That is, it is not going straight to zero.


I also question Mr. Tilson's motivation for doing this piece on Seeking Alpha. Why would he need to get a
confirmation of his position? Is this like a focus group to test the waters? I don't understand it fully.


Personally I would be cautious to go all-in short on LL.


You asked some very astute questions. Thanks.


07 Mar 2015, 12:09 PM


kitstricker
"do you have to lick the hardwood to get sick?"


Matt, I'm not sure that matters. The material has "carb compliant" right on the box. If the material is in fact not
as advertised they have at best a recall situation.


At worse, the company is toast. It will only take about 50 cancer patients to put them in bankruptcy. Business
insurance (if they have it) usually will not cover gross negligence.

Whether the company is liable if their Chinese suppliers "misrepresented" the product sold to them, I'm not a
lawyer, but I have to believe that any consumer rights attorney worth his or her salt or a government regulator
would ask LL: " What quality control procedures and/or testing procedures do you have in place for the
products you source from outside manufacturers?"

If LL does not sue the shorts, that means there is something very very fishy that they are afraid to be exposed.

How is it this company has sold "killer wood" for, I guess decades now and very few were harmed ?


The biggest surprise to me was the salesman overseas openly admitting that certain wood was NOT compliant even
when it said compliant.


Proving harm is going to be difficult.


On the other hand, HLF is an all day, every day scam that harms millions every year.


When I was in my early 20s, I managed a pizza hut. One time, we apparently did something wrong as a dozen or
more people called the health department on us.


They came in the next day and checked our food. The company line was always "never admit liability" for anything.


I know that I ran a clean store and we never disregarded any food safety issues.


I ate a small pizza the same night people got sick and I didnt get sick.


I know enough to believe that we somehow made people sick but it was nothing obvious or easily preventable. But I
also knew enough not to admit liability.


I think I responded to a half dozen people with a written apology and a "free pizza" card. But I darn sure didnt admit
liability.


Cant expect LL to admit liability either.


I follow a few people on twitter that are short HLF and I lost respect for a lot of them the way they are "piling on" here.


I dont doubt that HLF might have been saving a buck for all these years but at this point, they cant admit it.


All they can do is perhaps make darn sure they buy better wood in the future.


And what about all the LL workers ? Wouldnt they get sick working with the wood every day ?


Frankly, I think the entire getting sick is a low probability event. Like less than 1% of people.


Im not short anything. I can clearly see HLFs harm. I cant see it for LL.

Grant Payne, Contributor
I think you have a good point, especially with the workers handling the product and not getting sick thing.


LL execs will have a tough time selling the story that they didn't know about the bad wood, though. Which,
regardless of whether or not anyone got or gets sick, could have theoretically gotten someone sick.

chris_dress
here is the only question you have to answer to know the ultimate fate of this company... Are you buying or
recommending to a friend or loved one that they buy an $LL floor? 99.9% of the people will answer the same
way.


$LL has $50M in liquid assets to fight with.


Game over.


08 Mar 2015, 11:23 PM


A. Gidey
I think they can weather the storm and I have put my money were my mouth is this week. Here are 3 reasons why:


1) Let's not forget that the company has made more than $100mm in pre-tax annual income for the past 2
consecutive years. So, even if you give them a 30% haircut due to the bad PR, they should make $70mm this year
before the product recall expenses. I don't know how much the settlements will be but that $70mm should go a long
way towards meeting that.


2) LL has paid approximately $100mm in taxes in the last 2 years. The US tax law allows corporations to carry losses
back for 2 years. This means if the claims wipe out all the profits for the year and lead the company into losses, then
they will be getting a refund from the IRS up-to $100mm.


3) Legal claims take several years to settle. This will provide the company valuable time to accumulate its resources
and curb it's growth plans until it gets past this. 
I don't think people have given this points much thoughts yet due to the hysteria. My second point especially is a
critical support for the company.


07 Mar 2015, 11:18 PM


skapas
So you will be selling your puts. Would you also buy calls @ a defined price … if you believe LL can weather
the storm.


Hysteria there is, yes, but not sure if customers would continue to have confidence in LL.

Counterpoint:


Many, many companies, faced with overwhelming litigation (notwithstanding the fundamentals of their
business going forward) elect Chapter 11 to force the massive lawsuits/liabilities towards some rational
"settlement fund." This happened with several of the asbestos companies and in many ways this situation is
very similar, except here the management culpability would appear to be greater since it is my OPINION that
they either were guilty of complicity OR gross negligence.

I'm a licensed Home Inspection and contractor in one the states that is supposedly affected by the Formaldehyde in
the engineered flooring. I'm also a certified flooring inspector.


I can tell you that every environmental testing company in the country has been contacting home inspectors to
sell/lease them testing equipment.


Every professional home inspection association in the US is sending out regular briefs on the situation with guidance
for home purchasers. We're being told to pass that information on to our clients.


The amount and type of information flying around at the moment reminds me of the Chinese drywall that sold on the
Gulf Coast.


The home builder and renovator associations, NAHB and NARI are talking about this as well.


Most of the flippers in my area that I have talked to have said they will stop buying the flooring.


The impending damage to the reputation of the company is unknown, but I think it will be substantial. I could easily
see them stop selling engineered flooring until they can improve their reputation. Unfortunately, the sales of their other
products will likely take a hit as well.


My two cents from the ground level of the construction industry.

I have no position in LL, just giving some anecdotal experiences from the field. It's too early to know if the tests are
accurate or if the story is true.


I've personally bought flooring from the chemist who tests the material for the industry in this area and he has said
that it's a dirty secret that everyone knows. He said that some companies are great at manufacturing a quality product
and others, not so much. He didn't go into names.


This will take quarters, possibly years to play out. I wouldn't say it's going to zero, but it will get beat down for the
foreseeable future.


No analyst or article can undo the damage that has been done, whether merited or not. Defending the equity price will
be futile in the short term. Sales will diminish significantly.


The list of products that we look for in houses that have been recalled or are known hazards is a long one and this will
be added to the list.


There's also a long list of products that have trusts established for payment of claims. If a trust gets created called the
Lumber Liquidators Settlement Trust and it's all over google, it will cause damage to the company for the long run.


I wouldn't be surprised if the company changes the name.


The problem will be whether or not home owners insurance companies start asking questions about it or if it becomes
required on sellers disclosures prior to listing.


There are disclosure requirements in my region for formaldehyde and this may get added if it is found to be true.


My advice would be to wait for the chaos to settle and the truth to come out before taking a long position.

Perception is reality and if you Google Lumber Liquidators, some of the top ads are law firms soliciting the
public....and that is only for the consumer side of what they will face. I am sure there will be tons of security class-
actions. Thus, a "shield" of Chapter 11 in order to "rationalize" the responses to all of these may be their only choice if
they feel they have a viable business for the future (just as many of the asbestos companies did, and were able to
emerge over time.) Below is just a small sample of the literally hundreds of solicitations that the law firms are carrying
out..and some of these are "aggregators" or "feeders" to law firms. This excludes all of the political fallout from every
agency responsible for testing and the Congresspeople who will be standing up to get their pictures taken protecting
the public. This is a "no touch."

I think there is enough negativity for the herd on this stock... someone come out with something that isn't the same
thesis and I might be interested. This is going to be a special situation opportunity to make some long term $ for those
who aren't concerned with the next few "quarters". I hope it does fall to 9$ then I could acquire shares at a much
cheaper valuation. Before writing off LL completely I would highly recommend looking into what percentage of sales
will be disrupted by this scandal & also what percentage of sale come from CA alone? I am not sure that this is fact or
fiction but I read that it is only a small portion of LL inventory that has been manufactured at the source of the
problem. Only time will tell, but I dont think there is any harm in dollar cost averaging this stock over the next several
months.

"what percentage of sale come from CA "


It is all advertised as "CARB compliant". Even if the product is sold in elsewhere, you still have a serious issue if the
product is not as advertised and/or shown to be a health hazard.


Cigarettes are legal and cause cancer. Cigarette companies paid billions in claims and fines.


Asbestos was legal when sold and causes cancer. Many companies that sold products with asbestos paid billions to
settle their claims.


One should not think that exact legal status of formaldehyde will protect LL in this situation.

KSTHANE
Whitney Tilson has been right for the wrong reasons. I would like to see a detailed analysis of how buying from a few
suppliers who are using this cheaper glue has led to this massive operating margin expansion which he claims is the
genesis for his taking a short position. Considering that laminate is just a portion of their sales and that glue is likely a
miniscule portion of the cost of the wood laminate, it makes no sense that this issue would be the cause of the
operating margin expansion.


The reality here is that the short seller likely knows a producer on 60 Minutes and was able to get this story featured.
The short seller has also funded the plaintiffs attorneys most likely because the plaintiffs attorneys would not have
taken the case on if they didn't have a guaranteed source of income from the case which I'm sure they realize was
highly unlikely.


The reason for the robust operating margin expansion is that the sales were getting better after a period of weak
housing metrics, an SAP implementation that disrupted sales/inventory, capturing more of the value chain by buying a
supplier and new management that has added higher margin products to the stores. To call LL a "commodity
producer" is just idiotic. These guys are specialty retailers of flooring products and even with their dramatically
improved recent margins were still at margins similar to HD and LOW.


Whitney Tilson has been right to short the stock, but I would say he was right due to valuation being high and the
company running up against tough comps that were made tougher by bad weather in 2014. He could have probably
just stuck with those tenets but taking the stock down further by claiming their margins are too high and making up
that it's because of their sourcing is just pure sensationalism that has obviously served him well. When you think
about LL just remember MNST and GMCR from a few years ago. They claimed accounting fraud on GMCR and that
was recently completely dismissed by the SEC. They also claimed patent expiration and that big bad Starbucks would
kill GMCR with their own machine. Well, both points were totally bogus as SBUX signed on as a licensor which
basically destroyed all those theories...oh yeah, and then KO became an investor. It will be awhile now before you can
actually make money on LL since this bad publicity probably hurts sales for another year, but a fantastic opportunity
will be had by longs who can step in on the weakness in my opinion. I can't wait.


09 Mar 2015, 02:29 PM


DenaliOcean
You are right their operating margins will not have been affected by a glue.


The particular glue is called urea formaldehyde and it is widely used in pressed wood products. Particleboard,
medium density fiberboard and high density fiberboard. These laminate floor boards use high-density
fiberboard (HDF). It is not only the Chinese who use urea formaldehyde. But they obviously are completely
reckless by using excessive amounts of it.


It is not only laminate floors that are affected. Also engineered hardwood floors that use HDF in their core.


Lumber Liquidators does indeed face very serious liabilities. I know because I got one of these highly toxic
floors which made me ill and the supplier is facing a lawsuit now. The floor did not come from Lumber
Liquidators but another supplier who was also sourcing the high formaldehyde boards from China.

I only point this out to bring awareness to the seriousness of this problem. It does not only affect Lumber
Liquidators but others as well like Torlys.

"The short seller has also funded the plaintiffs attorneys" ??


Do you have any evidence of this? That is quite an accusation!

Um, they said it on the 60 minutes episode.

I, like many others were very anxious and nervous as a consumer that has done business with lumber liquidators over
the years with hardwood products as well as laminate products. And after checking many websites pro and con. I
decided to call the California air resources Board. It took just under 72 hours to get a return phone call. But it was
certainly worth the wait. They assured me that the laminate product that 60 minutes used was from an East Coast
store. and therefore not out of compliance. They said that the 60 minute expose was totally unnecessary. They also
were very concerned that no one on 60 minutes asked was the product unsafe. Because, in their view. The product is
safe. What the California air resources Board is telling everybody is basically not to worry, and that there's nothing to
see here. And that the tone and tenor of the people that are calling once they get the story from the government
regulation agency is that people's fears are somewhat alleviated. And lawsuits are mostly bluster. Unlike many other
posts on here those are FACTS from the California air resources Board. Not conjecture not speculation based on
what I think. I also must say that with all of the articles and over 200 comments on LL, I didn't see anyone else that
had clearly checked with the California air resources Board. That is absolutely shocking to me. If anybody else has
called the California air resources Board please, pretty please, with a cherry on top, share your findings as well.
Maybe we can make these boards have a little more facts, and a little less conjecture.

If you want to see the reality of what high formaldehyde boards actually do, see my playlist: 
http://bit.ly/17iUznF


The floor that I got was not from Lumber Liquidators but supplied by Torlys in Canada who had the
floorboards made in China. I thought it was Canadian.


My research has shown that there are genuine cases of people being affected by these high formaldehyde
floorboards. This is not merely a small technical compliance issue with formaldehyde regulations.

There's no way they said this to you.

Hmm, I am calling BS on that comment. If that were the case, LL would have had that person on a
conference call on Monday morning following the 60 minutes report.

Eric,


Please post any voicemails or emails you have (names redacted). Your comment seems farfetched.

What I want to know is why Whitney Tilson is using a profile photo that looks like a Glee Club photo. It seems out of
place for someone who is working on the same side of the fence as trial lawyers and a news program with a
sensationalist, shaky reputation.


He should use a profile photo that looks like the Trivago guy: rumpled jeans and shirt, 2-day shadow beard, bags
under the eyes--like a guy who just came back from a blurry weekend in Vegas. That type of photo would give his
story more gravitas. After all, there are probably over 1300 low-wage, innocent employees that might be out of a
much-needed job if the company is put out of business.

I have no dog in the fight. I may not have the exact wording. But this is generally what they said... The 60 minute
expose being totally unnecessary is exactly what they said. Them saying they were troubled by nobody asking if the
product was unsafe to use as intended is another point they made. They started off by saying that the boards tested
weren't from California. They also said that they went on to lumber liquidators web site, and viewed their test results
and that they appeared to be compliant with the California air resources Board. Again, I called them as a consumer.
This is what they told me.

All you need to do is call them yourself... I'm sure that would do more then I ever could...GL

Ericmls1e, you are telling the truth. I didn't call CARB but I went on their website to verify your comment. Their answer
to the "How can I tell if my flooring is safe to use?" question matches your comment.

Yes... this issue makes sense to me now... the fact that a California seller's product is multiple times outside of
the standards is no big deal to the regulator and 60 mins had no need to bring it to the forefront... And CA
residents shouldn't worry at all because 60 mins didn't test CA product... they should ignore the test results
provided by the nonprofit which was on the 60 mins show that said they did test CA product -apart from the
60 mins testing- which produced the same results as the 60 mins testing...


All making sense to me now....

Monster drinks were giving people heart attacks...for real. MNST price went from 76-45 now at 125. LL's floors might
emit a little more formaldehyde when destroyed than california likes but is everywhere in the air we breath naturally.
stock has gone from 108-28...

People forgive and forget. It basically goes back to, they want a cheap floor, and will not remember about the
allegations.


14 Mar 2015, 11:09 AM


jakurtz
Or they will remember but it doesn't matter. A million things in our home emit formaldehyde. The problem with
this one is that it is sourced from China by a relatively small domestic company selling the product
domestically and with a strong surging dollar LL's profits would soar. So tear them down.

Lots of scammers will come of the woodwork (no pun intended) with claims of nose and throat irritation even if they
don't have the product and just visited the store lol.

Some so called "victims" are nothing more than scammers. Before people make video rants, they need to
have real medical damages, documented purchases and documented independent testing by certified outfits.

I am sure that there are dozens of attorneys at this very moment creating the "outline" of what needs to be
done by people to create claims, and that LL will be severely hurt for years with the legal windstorms they are
about to face (WHETHER THE CLAIMS ARE VALID OR NOT!!)


15 Mar 2015, 09:05 PM


ArnieW
What if the majority of claims against LL are bogus?


16 Mar 2015, 04:50 AM


SeattleGoldMiner
This is not a morality discussion, this is a discussion of what will happen in a business. This is reality. The
lawyers have had ads soliciting clients and they will also generate class action suits for shareholders.
Whether this is "right" and whether the claims have any validity is irrelevant in judging whether the company
will be hurt by this. Take a look at Herbalife. Neither you nor I can judge whether Ackman's charges have
validity; only a court and the various regulatory authorities can determine that. This does not even involve
litigation, but rather the company's reputation to its customers, its sellers and its shareholders. If it should turn
out that they are NOT in violation of any regulations, laws etc., there are still going to be many people hurt.
That is the way it happens when even strong doubts are raised. It would appear that the video of the Chinese
factory is very damning EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT that LL was in compliance; however it DOES appear that
their testing may not have been as rigorous (and, perhaps, neither were the CA authorities, which may be
why they are glossing over this so far) as it might have been and that some flooring which is offgassing is
causing some people "issues." That is enough of the "smoke" for the lawyers to seek out victims who have
been "burned."

That last part about "whether the claims are valid or not" is the sad part in this whole situation...
