Ziopharm Oncology: 5 Potential Downsides To Its New Deal
Jan. 16, 2015 1:57 PM ET40 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Ziopharm doesn’t have the money to successfully pull off its new licensing deal. So
we believe it will have to sell stock, posing imminent dilution.


A “highly sensitive and confidential” letter details $15 million-worth of stock offered
by Ziopharm and its partner as incentive to speed contract signing.


Technology uses “Sleeping Beauty,” an older way of putting genes into cells to kill
tumors. The method may be safe, a doctor says, but may be because it’s less
effective.


This technology fell behind at the get-go. Novartis leads the field of rivals with CAR-
T cancer therapy and it would take years of catch-up for Ziopharm to gain FDA
consideration.


Ziopharm has quite the promotional history, increasing chances that this
experimental technique also won't develop into a commercial product. Ziopharm will
likely soon be looking for a new story.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Shares of Boston, Mass.-based Ziopharm Oncology (ZIOP) ripped some 54 percent within
hours on a positive news story this week - a story full of holes and investor risks.


The stock raced from $5.74 up to $9.50 following the announcement that ZIOP and its
partner Intrexon Corp. (XON) signed a licensing agreement with the Texas cancer center,
MD Anderson.


Though the share price has fallen, the excitement delivered a roughly $900 million
valuation to a company with a $362 million deficit and no product.


The deal trades licensing rights for MD Anderson's non-approved cancer technology for
$100 million worth of shares from both ZIOP and XON. ZIOP has also committed to
paying $15 million to $20 million yearly to the cancer center for research and development
for three years, though the press release is fuzzy. ZIOP must pay the first $3.75 million
within two months.

5/23/2018 Ziopharm Oncology: 5 Potential Downsides To Its New Deal - ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIOP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2827106-ziopharm-oncology-5-potential-downsides-to-its-new-deal 2/14


Ominous details surround ZIOP's dollar-and-dilution deal, as well as ZIOP itself. Here are
the top five reasons why TheStreetSweeper dislikes this deal and sees loads of downside
ahead:


1. ZIOP doesn't have the money to pull off this deal. So we believe ZIOP will have to
sell stock, posing imminent dilution.


ZIOP has just $46 million in cash. Its own quarterly report says that's "sufficient to fund
operations into the fourth quarter of 2015."


But that was before the new agreement. ZIOP is burning over $7 million per quarter. And it
is now committed to pay about half that much - $3.75 million to $4 million quarterly - to
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston each quarter for three
years.


2. Shares worth $15 million offered as incentive to speed contract signing.


The day ZIOP was scheduled to present to JP Morgan, Jan. 14, turns out to be the very
day ZIOP pulled this licensing announcement out of its ear. JP Morgan acted as
underwriter during ZIOP's roughly $54 million public offering in October 2013 at $3.50 per
share.


But that timing apparently was not mere coincidence.


This "highly sensitive and confidential" letter to a University of Texas vice president of
strategic industry ventures describes $15 million worth of incentive shares - 1.6 million
ZIOP shares and 278,218 XON shares - not included in the licensing agreement, to hand
to MD Anderson to speed up the expected 120-day contract approval process. That way,
the chief executives of ZIOP and XON who signed the letter would be able to issue the
public announcement during the JP Morgan conference. The letter stated:


"Specifically, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is being held next week in San
Francisco, and on Wednesday during the Conference, the Licensee Group would like to
issue a public announcement about the execution of the license agreement.
Consequently, the Licensee Group would like to induce and incentivize MD Anderson to
undertake any and all extraordinary efforts to expedite and/or shorten its contracting,
review and approval processes and to conclude and execute the license agreement on or
before 8:00 am PST, on January 14, 2015 (the "Accelerated Closing Deadline")."


3. ZIOP has a history of heavy promotion, followed by disappointment.

5/23/2018 Ziopharm Oncology: 5 Potential Downsides To Its New Deal - ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIOP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2827106-ziopharm-oncology-5-potential-downsides-to-its-new-deal 3/14


It goes like this: shares falter so ZIOP runs out a story on a promising
technology/drug/update, shares soar, shares collapse on a trial flop (its palifosfamide
sarcoma study of 2013), repeat. And so it goes. But at some point, everyone quits falling
for the story and waits for results, rather than facing another costly disappointment.


4. The MD Anderson technology uses "Sleeping Beauty," an older way of putting
genes into cells.


The body contains T-cells within the immune system that kill a virus or infection. Now,
researchers are removing T-cells and putting genes in them that then attack the tumor. But
the process results in side-effects that can make the patient very sick. MD Anderson's
technology doesn't cause a lot of side effects, but a doctor who asked to remain
anonymous, said it may be because it's less effective in killing tumor cells.


5. This experimental therapy lagged behind that of bigger competitors at the get-go.


Novartis, Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma are all up front with their own "CAR-T"
cancer immunotherapy. These massive companies are way ahead of the MD Anderson
technology, the doctor who is familiar with the technology told TheStreetSweeper.


"It's a very competitive space," he said. "Theirs does not seem like best of breed and
they're way behind."


Starting out behind is a big problem. It takes many years to conduct trials to even get an
experimental drug or technology ready to be considered for Food and Drug Administration
approval.


No way is ZIOP a nearly $1 billion company, the doctor told TheStreetSweeper. And we
agree. To be worth so much, it would have to be more than a no-name company with
nothing but operating losses since inception and mounting extensive financial obligations.
A $1 billion company would at least have a product and a recognizable name. But we
expect reality will hit and ZIOP's valuation will swoon back to earth very soon. We don't
expect to wait long.

Very ridiculous and repetitive article (and some are saying Hack job) - While you think it may be 'less effective' I would
rather come at this treatment in that regard (if true) rather with being too toxic, and killing people, trying to fix the
proper efficacy with that handicap. With this MD Anderson and MN IP and full facility tie-up,....with patients coming in
from all over the Globe, Intrexon (XON) and Ziopharm (ZIOP) can use their expert DNA technology and experience to
tweak things with RheoSwitch on/off with a Plasmid activator or similar in this arena to allow for the best efficacy and
definitely (so far) the lowest toxicity. They could also possibly add in a DC or Ad vector (dc-RTS-IL12) or similar to
secrete Interleukin 12 adding in more cytokine stimuli or other means to boost a response. Seriously, why would Mr.
RJ Kirk, one of the most respected (and successful) biotech innovators, investors and now CEO (of Intrexon) and
both companies, fork over $100 million if they did not feel very confident that they could make this work. There are
also rumors that JNJ's Jansen may be interested in tying up with this endeavor as well (not confirmed yet). So do your
own due diligence and take a look at my previous articles from last year and come to your conclusion, not some
article writer that recently entered a large short position, to benefit from a likely very short term position. I have been
quite successful after writing (only) those 2 articles on Seeking Alpha last summer, and I am feeling very confident
about this year too, and well beyond....good luck to all!

The bigger question is why Sonya can't even live up to her own editorial standards. One has to wonder
whether whether publicly stating "TheStreetSweeper prohibits members of its editorial team from taking
financial positions in the companies that they cover" and then disclosing "The owners of TheStreetSweeper
hold a short position in ZIOP" not only crosses ethical boundaries, but criminal ones as well.


16 Jan 2015, 03:15 PM


Curve Tech Investing, Contributor
Criminal? I am curious what law might have been broken.


Frankly, I don't even see an ethical issue. If ABC TV gives a Disney movie a good review, is that unethical?
We all know that Disney owns ABC and we all that the author's employer is short.


Quoting a single unnamed source is poor journalism, but I don't see any other reason to get your undies in a
twist.

Those of us who made a fortune in CELG are used to these short slam pieces often backed by hedge funds that got
destroyed on good news. The 17 million shorts now without ANY warrant hedge got destroyed this week. After
doubling from Oct $2.50 to $5 and continuing higher before JPM with the shorts saying the XON/ZIOP science was
not proven and some saying it was a sham - The LARGEST AND MOST PRESTIGIOUS CANCER CLINIC IN THE
WORLD just validated that science. Yes MD Anderson also chose XON/ZIOP and the buzz is competitors wanted it
also but XON/ZIOP was chosen by MDA...Those of us who attended the four ZIOP/XON sessions at JP Morgan H/C
conf (main sessions and breakout sessions of each) and got to talk to prestigious Dr Cooper of MDA, understand
what a transformational deal this is. (That word used in the BMO report where quality analyst Jim B just raised ZIOP

to Outperform with a $15 target (raised from $1) - see link at bottom to the 2 BMO reports out this week). I have never
seen RJ Kirk so confident in my life - and remember HE HAS SEEN THE DATA...You can be sure we will see it soon.
Also on the Q3 XON earnings call he said "significant transactionS underway" (PLURAL) and he delivered the first
blockbuster deal this week and in the P/R clearly signal more announcements and deals are coming....and in the
XON's sessions he stated clearly and more than once "more announcements are is coming in DAYS, week, months" -
this was then AGAIN confirmed by ZIOP CEO in their breakout session.  
Guys don't listen to this short article - I was in all four meetings..the real biotech institutional investors were VERY
impressed by Frost, Kirk and Dr Cooper of MDA. Dr Cooper was clear they think this collaboration will change cancer
medicine as we know it. They took stock instead of cash because they are SO confident in this partnership delivering
life changing results for patients and investors. 
He stated that data is coming....I suspect some in P/R and some soon at the ASGCT (American Society of Gene &
Cell Therapy) and the ASBMT (American Society of Bone Marrow Transplant) . When investors see the data from
MDA that Kirk saw BEFORE he decided to invest over $100 million in this deal - I suspect we hit BMO's $15 target
this quarter Q1. ALSO - Kirk confirmed there will be outlicensing deals with Big Pharma/Bio perhaps by indication - so
imo there will be deals with the likes of Roche, CELG, BMY, NVS or others who can add value to the XON/ZIOP/MDA
partnership in a big way - So imagine what this stock does if we get $100 million up front for hematology indications
with much more on the back end from CELG or NVS or if BMY licenses lung cancer...etc...remember there are
"significant transactions underway" and news coming in "Days. wks. mos"....we already now have the largest cancer
clinic in the world with a vested interest in putting their BEST CAR-T TCR and other gene experts to work with
XON/ZIOP. Add in the partners that will come and this ZIOP stock (and XON) has the potential to be multiples of itself
the likes of those of us in CELG, AGIO, ACAD have seen. This is next imo and I am betting on it. Have so many
shares but I am buying this dip on this illogical short slam biased piece. Additional announcements in DAYS. Buy the
dip especially on LEAP expiration day - BTW notice of the 20,000 in the money leaps expiring today - only a small
percentage are selling - 85% of the LEAP holdings - mostly savvy institutional investors are TAKING THE ALMOST 2
MILLION ZIOP SHARES AT EXPIRATION. I would suggest following them (most of which who talked to Dr Cooper at
JPM) and not a short seller who writes a biased piece to help the shorts.

"Kasimov wrote, “We understand the enthusiasm around the news given 1) the association with a top cancer
research institution, and 2) the high level of interest/value ascribed to CAR-T programs more broadly (JUNO,
KITE and BLCM trading at market caps of, $4.8B, $2.6B and $800M, respectively; ZIOP now trading at
~$900M). That said, there are still a lot of questions around the ZIOP/XON/MD Anderson approach, how it is
differentiated, and potential targets (to name a few) that we think would be important to understand before
becoming more constructive on the name. We would also note that this announcement isn’t a surprise as
ZIOP has made it clear it would be entering the CAR-T space, and has been active preclincally in the area.”


The analyst concluded, “While we are encouraged ZIOP has announced a planned entry into the
(increasingly crowded) CAR-T field, we think we still need more information to understand how competitive of
an approach it may or may not have.”

So what? The analyst above is like 50/50 in his ratings, and what do you expect him to say, since ZIOP &
XON just got into this space? However, they have this huge MDA alliance now, and say what you want, but
Dr. Cooper is very excited and very confident about this working and being the best program in CarT to
possibly even the most most used eventually due to cost and less toxicity, and the superior knowledge of the
Intrexon team might make this best efficacy as well. On your second comment, I believe this poster was just
aggravated that there were about 3 articles that came out saying basically the same garbage which basically
places doubt on something they can not say for sure they are correct, kinda like saying, "well be careful cause
a plane may hit your house" - I could also say, "very possible that JUNO or KITE's CarT program may fail due
to toxicity" - so this poster only asked those interested to go view his comments and decide for themselves,
and he was there at the JPM conference and liked what he saw & heard. What is so wrong with that? Why
are you here?

What is wrong with getting supporters to flood a negative SA piece with positive comments and likes? What's
wrong when promoters hype stocks via social media? Nothing except that it promotes a fake consensus
around certain viewpoints which are not representative of savvy investors in general.

Well, it's not necessarily fake when you have shareholders with many millions of shares owning here, and
looking forward to a very bright future. But nevertheless, why can't you and many others with such a negative
viewpoint here, not wait until data is released in the future before trying to force your negative opinion on
anyone? It's like you hate anyone being so positive, and unless you can see a change, you are going to do
anything possible to try and change it. Just because some Billionaire gets a great deal orchestrated where
there could be huge potential from it, that it does guarantee that it will not be true. As much as RJ Kirk does
not reveal, I would be more worried about what you may not know, over what you think you do know here.
And at least seeing all these positive supporters on here has to tell you something - it ain't fake! Finally, why
can't you use your real name on here, like I do? At least I have the guts and the confidence to do
that,.....hmmm.

You really seem quite thin-skinned about anything other than pure cheerleadism leveled at ZIOP. Why is that?
Other than pointing out that the JPM analyst doesn't share your bullish outlook and that it looks like
someone's orchestrating a campaign to hype the stock what have I said that is any way 'forcing a negative
viewpoint'?


If you were as confident in ZIOP as you claim to be you wouldn't bother attacking me so forcefully. You'd let
the results speak for themselves.

Thanking the shorts for cheapening the stock is the standard what-me-worry line one always hears in these
cases. Same as the TSLA longs said, same as the GPRO longs said, and the list goes on. They've wound up
owning a lot of stock that's been getting cheaper and cheaper and I don't think they're thanking anyone at this
point.

An OK article. Point 3 is worth considering, but I would not totally discount a biotech because of past failures. Even
the best-planned clinical trial may fail for reasons that could not have been anticipated. Points 4 and 5 raise
interesting issues but could use more evidence than what is offered here.

1. I don't believe Ziopharm will need to dilute to finance. The company has already indicated that significant
transactions are underway and at the conference said that additional announcements would be coming.


2. I'm not sure why the incentive shares offered to MD are considered a potential downside. The ziopharm share price
was steadily increasing during the period of negotiation and these additional shares effectively just make up the
difference.


3. I believe this article is wrong with respect to promotion and failure. Ziopharm and Intrexon have done very little
promotion of their technology. If anything, they've been frustratingly silent. It's true that Ziopharm decided to stop
pursuing palifosfamide after its failure in 2013. This was an older drug developed outside the Intrexon partnership.
Even so, there are still ongoing clinical trials involving this drug which Ziopharm has done nothing to promote since it's
now focused on synthetic biology.


4. Calling the sleeping beauty mechanism an older method is just dead wrong. It's a fairly new method and the only
one that non-viral, which is a significant advantage.


5. I don't believe Ziopharm is "behind" the competitors indicated here. If anything, the market cap of these other
companies point to the fact that Ziopharm is undervalued. MD Anderson has access to largest patient population for
clinical trials and indicated they would have up to 5 CARs entering the clinic this year. I don't believe the competitors
can say the same.

Simply ask yourself, will the world's best known cancer research and treatment center allow its name attached to an
unsuccessful deal, thus ruining its reputation? The fact the initial payment is in stock showed the excitement of MDA
knowing these shares will represent multiple times of its value in the future. With an institution like MDA, it could pick
and choose practically any partner of its liking and demand much more cash upfront, like so many other deals, so it
has picked a relatively little known co and its partner which was on the market only a little over a year ago. Why? Both
parties are excited by the cutting edge science each can bring to the table. This is a deal of unprecedented synergy
leading to the change of how cancer care will be provided. The winners are those patients. Regardless your financial
interest, better medical care to humankind should be celebrated. For those writing such bashing articles, remember
may be one day you or your loved one will benefit from such vastly superior care!

I respectfully disagree with many/most/all of your points. RJ Kirk is a notoriously difficult negotiator and he would not
blow $15 million to simply be the bell of the ball. That idea is LUDICROUS I think there was something in the MD
Anderson IP that Kirk found to be very accretive to the ZIOP/XON toolset. As for the "highly confidential" document, it
was posted in an 8K. You make it sound as if they were trying to bury something.


Would you kindly provide SA members with the name or the doctor who said :


1) Novartis, Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma are all up front with their own "CAR-T" cancer immunotherapy.
These massive companies are way ahead of the MD Anderson technology, the doctor who is familiar with the
technology told TheStreetSweeper.

2) "It's a very competitive space," he said. "Theirs does not seem like best of breed and they're way behind."


3) No way is ZIOP a nearly $1 billion company, the doctor told TheStreetSweeper.


I would really love to see his credentials to judge his expertise in the space. I would think he would want to be quoted
since he has such strong opinions. Is that not what reputations are based upon?


Bottom line: Unattributed quotes don't tend to hold much water and authors who are paid by short sellers tend not to
provide readers with the most objective articles.

I'm pretty sure that the Doctor does not exist. The imaginary doctor only purpose, is to give credence to the
author short position.


"No way is ZIOP a nearly $1 billion company, the doctor told TheStreetSweeper" - pathetic !

Do you really think MD Anderson, arguably the best cancer research & development institute, would involve itself with
a second-rate company? I strongly doubt it. Just as MDA is a leader, I would expect them to also deal with leaders in
their field. One-half of your argument against ZIOP is based on the opinion of one anonymous doctor. Is that the best
you can do? Clearly that doctor is not confident in his position to stand by it. So who should we believe MDA, the
leader in its field, or an anonymous doctor who won't stand by his position?

To invest in a company is to invest in its management, particularly in early stage biotechs which by an large do not
have any product in the market, but in the process of developing its pipeline for FDA approval to make to the market.
R. Kirk stated "transactions" are underway between the cos, ZIOP and XON, and other leading national and
international entities. Then, voila, the agreement is inked and announced a few months after that statement. In the
recent conference, he, along with the ZIOP CEO, stated more news on development (transactions) will be
forthcoming in days, weeks and months. He has already proved to be a man of his words, we can pretty much expect
further positive development to unfold very shortly. Additionally, Dr. Cooper of MDA also mentioned that test data
would be presented in specific professional conferences and they are "transparent" in their data release. What more
can an investor ask from an company? Frankly all the articles trying to instill doubts and fears just can't work in this
case. I might add, Kirk, the largest holder of shares of XON and ZIOP, has never sold one single share from his
holdings, but to add more. This is the investment of the decade in my estimation. The only contribution the shorts to
this investment is to at times shake down some shares for longs to pick up.

judgments as to the veracity/intent of this article.


Hunter Adams, a member of the expert advisory board for The Street Sweeper, understands stock manipulation
firsthand. Adams entered the securities industry 15 years ago with a focus on high-risk penny stocks. He quickly
became an expert at establishing shell corporations, executing reverse mergers and selling both equity and
convertible debt in speculative small-cap companies. His career ended in 2001, when government investigators
accused him of manipulating worthless penny stocks. He pled guilty to two conspiracy charges -- for securities fraud
and money laundering -- and served time in prison for his crimes. Years later, he pled guilty to racketeering charges,
fully cooperated with the government and accepted full responsibility for his actions. Today, he has embraced a life of
reform and now hopes to help protect the public by exposing others who tread in the same murky waters he once
swam in. To contact him directly, please send an email to hunter@thestreetsweepe...

Just the fact that thestreetsweeper is short should make everything in this article irrelevant to an experienced investor.
Block out the noise like this article.

Boy this name Sonya sure looks familiar, I think I read an article about SGMO with the exact same tone, in which it
questions the validity of the management and "stories", same approach, I am sure she wouldn't mind sharing this with
everyone here, enjoy!

justanotherid,


Thanks for the link to Sonya Colberg's SA article for The Street Sweeper that slammed SGMA in September 2013.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2827106-ziopharm-oncology-5-potential-downsides-to-its-new-deal 13/14


Sonya Colberg and The Street Sweeper seem to have a pattern (and a method) of COMBINING short-selling with
self-serving, one-sided, overly-negative articles about vulnerable small-cap stocks. (The positive aspects of these
companies are omitted or downplayed.)


In addition to her slam against SGMO, and her Jan. 16, 2015 slam against ZIOP, she also slammed MIFI on Feb. 9
and 10, 2015 -- only 24 and 25 days later!


MIFI promptly fell 16% over those two days. Cause-and-effect or just coincidence?


While Sonya Colberg did not short-sell ZIOP and MIFI herself, her employer "The Street Sweeper" DID short-sell
ZIOP and MIFI.


So what is the meaning (and value) of her "disclosure" that "The author is not receiving compensation for it." (That is,
for her writing articles slamming ZIOP and MIFI)? The Street Sweeper presumably pays Sonya Colberg for writing
these slams against these small-cap stocks that TSS short-sells BEFORE Sonya Colberg's articles are published. Is
not "payment" to Sonya Colberg by The Street Sweeper the same as "compensation"? Or does Sonya Colberg write
these slams for free?


Suspiciously, her slam against ZIOP is partly based on an ANONYMOUS doctor -- and her slam against MIFI is partly
based on an ANONYMOUS tech analyst!


Another pattern (and method) of anonymous sources. Why the anonymous sources? Are these anonymous sources
real or pretend? How can readers and investors judge the credibility, integrity, fairness, (and reality) of the sources
(and of Sonya Colberg and The Street Sweeper) if the latter two refuse (or fail) to tell us who their sources are?


I request Seeking Alpha to investigate the history, personnel, methods, and results of The Street Sweeper (and Sonya
Colberg) articles for integrity, accuracy, completeness, balance, and fairness -- and to decide whether or not to
publish articles by TSS and SC anymore.

Thanks for this article.


It offer different angle that we investors need. Especially in this case where I see a lot of raging bulls.


At current price level ZIOP seems for me like a big property balloon. Mainly consisting of big expectations and
promises which inflate the shareholders value over all boundaries. With help of major owner itself.


Anyway as I see there is strong resistance at 10$ and also quite stable support at 7$ so everybody can relax,
because it seem that this won't go anywhere. For now.

Knowing one major principle in ZIOP personally, and knowing his history in business dealings, I'd be very cautious if
evolved.

To NanoDave:


Thanks for your warning. Truly. But I agree strongly with justanotherid.


Please state the name of the important person at ZIOP that you are concerned about. And please state "his history in
business dealings" that you are warning us about.


If what you say is factual, you should be able to say it without worrying about being sued for libel. Is there another way
that telling us the facts might put you at risk?


Also, if what you say is true, your readers will be able to investigate and verify publicly known facts -- so it will not be
necessary to state your name, if you prefer not to.


I will add that, much to my regret, many (and maybe most) business persons and companies have histories or current
practices that are not 100% perfect or "clean." That means that investors often have to "tolerate" people and
behaviors they do not approve of.

ZIOP is ordinary balloon.


Be aware for shorting. This can go up in unbelievable highs and then can drop like a stone.
