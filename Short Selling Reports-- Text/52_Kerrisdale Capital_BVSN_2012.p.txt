BroadVision: Challenges Loom Ahead
Apr. 25, 2012 2:45 AM ET24 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Broadvision (NASDAQ:BVSN) is overvalued, and Wednesday's earnings release should
further demonstrate that. The company's shares have been inflated by the efforts of
several stock promoters who have been hyping the company's enterprise social
networking initiative, Clearvale.


But in our opinion, Clearvale remains unproven and faces substantial competition from
larger and well-funded players. Given the number of companies that have entered the
enterprise social networking competitive landscape, we think Clearvale will fall short in its
attempts to generate value for Broadvision shareholders.


As a result, we expect today's earnings release to remind investors that Broadvision is in
very much a transitory mode. Earnings per share and operating profit could very well be
negative in 2012, if recent history is any indication. The company's legacy products are in
decline and unlikely to re-enter a growth mode. In the meantime, the company's Clearvale
product did not generate material revenue in 2011 and should remain unprofitable
throughout 2012, given that Clearvale remains in a development phase where R&D and
marketing costs will likely outweigh any initial revenue. As such, we expect continued
losses at BVSN.


Legacy Businesses in Rapid Decline


First, let's discuss Broadvision as a whole. The business has been in serious decline over
the past five years, with both revenue and profit on a steep downward trajectory, as we
can see below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/525031-broadvision-challenges-loom-ahead 2/11


Revenue has declined at a compounded annual growth rate of -19% over the past four
years. Operating profit has turned negative for the past two years, coming in at -$3.4
million in 2010 and -$4.7 million in 2011.


The company's drop in revenue has been caused by its troubled legacy products. These
legacy products include a variety of software solutions that customers can implement for
e-commerce, customer interaction and other functionalities on both intranet portals as well
as external websites. Products include Broadvision's Business Agility Suite, Commerce
Agility Suite and Quicksilver solutions, and descriptions of these products can be found
here and here.


These businesses have been suffering rapid decline and there appear to be few
expectations of a turnaround. Management makes this relatively clear in both SEC filings
and conference calls. For instance, in the company's most recent earnings call, CEO
Pehong Chen commented that "Market maturity and consolidation mean that all legacy
solutions cannot sustain a growth business." In the third quarter earnings call, Chen
elaborated:


The legacy business is a very horizontal platform business, and as we have said
many times, they are very mature and consolidated under primarily two players, IBM
and Oracle/BEA... Even though we still think we have a very good product, and all
our current customers still on our platform can attest to that, I think the trend is just
not in our favor as, again, probably is evident to many peopleâ€¦ [That] explains our
declining install base and maintenance revenue.


Clearvale: A Small Player Competing Against Well-Funded Giants


Given its declining legacy business, Broadvision has focused its turnaround efforts on its
new Clearvale product. BVSN has substantial cash on its balance sheet, and Chen has
signaled that much of this cash will be used to fund Clearvale's development. Clearvale is
an enterprise social networking ("ESN") product that is intended to enable customers to
build the next generation of interactive internal portals and external websites.


Unfortunately for Clearvale, it is competing with large competitors with deep pockets,
many of whom currently have more advanced offerings and began developing their
enterprise social networking solutions before Clearvale.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/525031-broadvision-challenges-loom-ahead 4/11


The list of industry titans devoting resources to the enterprise social networking market is
daunting. IBM launched IBM Connections several years ago, and Microsoft's
(NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint, a broad content-centric collaboration offering, is
increasingly becoming prevalent in a social enterprise context. Salesforce.com
(NYSE:CRM) has made its Chatter social networking product a central focus, and given
Salesforce.com's track record of forward-looking and innovative products, we think that
Chatter may end up being the main enterprise social networking platform for customers
who already use the Salesforce CRM platform.


Putting these tech largecaps aside, Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) is the leading
enterprise social networking platform right now, and is increasingly running away from the
competition. The company now sports a $1.5bn market cap and a blue chip customer
base. Yammer has received more than $140 million in venture capital funding to-date,
while SocialCast has been acquired and is now a subsidiary of tech giant VMWare, Inc.
(NYSE:VMW). Finally, a slew of other competitors have viable offerings, including Intel
Capital-backed Telligent, VC-funded Moxie Software, etc.


We have reviewed many of the competitor platforms, and found quite a number superior
to Clearvale. In a telling report, Forrester, a leading IT research firm, published a study
reviewing the enterprise social networking sector. Throughout the report, there was not a
single mention of Clearvale. In explaining why they excluded certain vendors in their
report, Forrester wrote:


A number of highly viable vendors were not included because their social technology
products have insufficient market presence and/or market awareness within
Forrester and its client base. This list includes such vendors as Igloo, Moxie, and
Saba.


Clearvale likely belongs under this classification, as it has apparently not won enough
clients to put it on the map for Forrester. To better understand Clearvale's limited inroads
thus far, it's instructive to compare Clearvale's customer testimonials with the customer
lists of its competitors. These customer testimonials are available on the Clearvale
website here, and provide a brief description of these companies in the table below:

Another way to examine how Clearvale stacks up to the competition is to compare
revenue between Clearvale and JIVE, the only publicly traded pure-play enterprise social
networking business. In FY 2011, JIVE generated $77m of revenue. In contrast,
"Clearvale did not generate material revenue in 2011", according to the most recent 10K.
Based on press reports on the internet, we also believe that SocialCast and Yammer are
generating at least $10m+ in revenue.


To be clear, we are not saying that Broadvision's Clearvale will be unable to transform
itself into a viable player within the enterprise social networking sector. We are, however,
arguing that thus far there is limited evidence supporting that, and the tripling of the BVSN
stock price in the past four months is not justifiable when examining the current economic
potential of Clearvale.


Clearvale has a tough road ahead of itself. It is competing in a crowded sector against
well-funded competitors, many of whom have more financial resources for R&D and
marketing expenditures than Broadvision, even after accounting for the $54 million of cash
on the company's balance sheet.


From our review of the available service offerings, we would argue that quite a number of
Clearvale's competitors have more user-friendly interfaces than Clearvale, and equally
robust functionality. In examining the various leading enterprise social networking options,
we were unable to find sufficiently differentiating factors with the Clearvale platform to
become comfortable that Clearvale would be able to catch up to its competitors in market
share.


While Broadvision management may argue that the ESN revenue opportunity is vast
enough to allow quite a number of providers to survive, Clearvale has yet to post
meaningful revenue, whereas its competitors have already posted tens of millions.
Clearvale needs to report more progress, in terms of sales, profit, customer wins and
industry acknowledgement, before we can justify the current share price.

The author will likely eat his words after tomorrow or soon afterwards. It is funny how the author continues to talk
down Broadvision. How much research has the author put into Broadvision? Has he compared the platforms to the
competition? Broadvision was once a leader, so the investment community is well aware of their name. When
investors realize how undervalued the company is, they will be begging to buy shares at these prices. I agree with the
promoters. They have done their homework. The Engage platform doesn't even come close to Clearvale in terms of
quality, performance or pricing! Engage is expensive compared to Clearvale Enterprise! Also regarding JIVE
revenues, JIVE is a much larger company right now, compared to Broadvision. Of course revenues are much larger.
BVSN is still undervalued in my opinion. I disagree with many of the authors viewpoints in this article. Time will prove
you were wrong about Broadvision.

Oh boy I can't wait to see how wrong YOU are. You must be be a subscriber drone to NIA and Lebed.biz.
Sad.

I believe the author is correct. Even if Clearvale would be a good product, there is no evidence that it generates
customers and revenue. The company would surely have reported some new clients and deals over the last quarter.


Another setback for BVSN, that is not mentioned here, is this:


Would you choose a long term product for your company from the smallest fish in a sea from choices? A fish that has
declined revenues over the past 12 years, burned 1.2 billion cash, is not profitable, and on the road to bankrupcy if
nothing changes fast?


I believe the answer is the most important reason that Clearvale fails to gain traction.

He is correct about the stock pumpers driving up the stock price 
NIA has been pumping this on a dailey basis. NIA is known for pumping stocks They drove up Mega Precious Metals
Agria and others then dumped them . Be careful NIA is crooked

I'm following this company SOLELY because of the excessive pumping action. I see the price as inflated. Why would
it NOT be below $10 still without it? Are investers that blind for an opportunity?

Anyone who did his homework on Broadvision Inc. will know that the patents that serve as the company`s very
foundation bedrock expire in 2013 and 2015 respectively. (BVSN 2008 annual SEC fillings) How will that effect the
share value of the company?


25 Apr 2012, 08:18 AM


Covingtonium
Can you link those patents please?


25 Apr 2012, 10:50 AM


Wim Dankbaar, Contributor
Joseph,


The only thing that (ultimately) affects the share value of a company is its ability to make profits and thus money for its
shareholders.


Look at Apple and Microsoft.

"In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable." - Robert Arnott


Any intelligent investor I'm sure has dug up some of the facts you presented and see the legacy business is in
decline.  
If you are investing, being a intelligent investor is what will keep you in this game and according to the those
guidelines this is not a company you would want to invest your money in. I do agree that based on logical stand point
BVSN should not have had the activity that it has been having but are the markets based on logical decisions? I'm
gonna take contrarian approach on this one for the short term using money I can afford to lose. Altho, I agree with
most your points I also agree with most of NIA's. Let's just see how this plays out.

Well done analysis as always by Kerrisdale. For additional support for their thesis, it's worth reviewing the insight
provided on at the following link from the Association of Int'l Deflation Society

Renmycat!
Mdmichalak - 11 comments. everyone of them defending broadvision since April 3rd.  
Guess you werent around for the huge declines in late January and mid march, both to the low 20s. how is this time

25 Apr 2012, 09:44 AM


Renmycat!
Is there going to be a dump to day during market hours?  
or will it come after hours when results released?  
or tomorrow?


any thoughts based on experiences.. much appreciated!


25 Apr 2012, 10:56 AM


JoeNatural, Contributor
I'm still in a state of shock that Lebed and crew didn't cash out on the recent monster run. Instead these dummies
bought more at higher prices. LOL. Unreal, even management stated in the last earnings CC that they wouldn't be
reporting profits in ANY quarter this year. Duh ... losing. I think that Lebed actually started to believe in his own pump
and is now getting burned badly as the stock falls apart.


25 Apr 2012, 11:40 AM

Perhaps he's made enough now, and just covering his behind. If he gets out now, or at least make good losses, it will
be too easy to make a criminal case against him. If I were him, I'd make 10 million and then lose 2 to make myself
look as a victim like everyone else, and get away with it.

LOLOL!! Covingtonium that was sad of me to say that and I did lose money today but not too much but I've made a
good little bit too. It's been a crazy wild ride so far. I knew I was wrong but I still was wanting hope so that should
defiantly show you I have much more to learn, I should of went and bought some lottery tickets so I would of at least
had a chance...

Nice work Kerrisdale. When these heavily promoted stocks fall, they fall hard. I wouldnt be surprised if this thing is
below 20 or even 15 by end of week.


25 Apr 2012, 02:04 PM


Isaac Silbermann, Contributor
Basically everything in this article is on point. It's only a matter of time until BVSN drops back to the sub-15 level
where it belongs. Meanwhile, gotta give props to Lebed on this one, without a doubt it's the best pump of the year so
far.


25 Apr 2012, 02:18 PM


mdmichalak
If your short yes. The stock is volitile. I could care less about what the earning report says today. It doesn'tmatter if the
stock falls to $15 to me. When it rides back up to new highs, we will see how people like Covingtonium cover their
tracks and begin to come up with all kinds of reasons why, over analysis, hype etc...


25 Apr 2012, 04:59 PM


RickStGeorge
While I believe that Clearvale is a better product, and the only publicly traded company that truly is an enterprise
social networking cloud play, it is going to depend entirely on their marketing and successful acquisition of new
customers.


During the mean time, we apparently must watch for Articles that bash certain stock plays in order to gain insight into
the investor crowd mentality and therefore market turns. Because as soon as this article came out, BVSN nosedived.


Perhaps NIA would care to post their version, and we can ride the stock back up! Is this how we're going to play the
game fellows?


25 Apr 2012, 10:31 PM


Isaac Silbermann, Contributor
Seems like you nailed this one on the head Sahm. Poor results from Q1 as their actual business results continue to
decline. Pie-in-the-sky visions for Clearview aside, this company looks most attractive as a SPAC or simply winding it
down and distributing the cash to shareholders. That will never happen though... I wouldn't be surprised to see this
name pumped again at some point in the future due to the low float.


But for now, the bears are firmly in control. Now for the fun part, riding this pig down to the low-teens.

It is obvious that Kerrisdale Capital are shorters & have a heavy infuence on driving the stock down. You can only
keep BVSN down for so long, but the cream always rises to the top! It is clear to me that Broadvision is being targeted

Isaac Silbermann, Contributor
You are right, the cream always rises to the top and the sludge always drops to the bottom. BVSN is the
sludge, make no mistake about it, their results over the last decade prove as much.


You are also right that BVSN isn't going away anytime soon, it has $55 million in cash to burn through and
that could take a few years. This isn't a zero yet, it just isn't worth any more than book value, at most, given
the poor results, lackluster products and strategic positioning.

Looks like AIDS is calling for another 60% drop in BVSN from here. They initially said short at $55 and it was a 100%
technical avoid.
