Video Surveillance of Sino Clean's 'Ghost Factories' Finds Little-to-No
Activity
May 5, 2011 11:25 AM ET46 comments
by: Alfred Little


Editor's note: On May 3, Sino Clean released a letter to its shareholders disputing Mr.
Little's claims (here). It also posted its own videos (here), transportation log (here), and
shipping records (here and here). On May 9, Mr. Little published a second article (here)
responding to the company.


:::::::::::::::::


Investigators from the International Financial Research & Analysis Group ("IFRA") have
conducted video surveillance of over 20 U.S.-listed Chinese operating companies and
counting, according to IFRA's head of research Andrew Wong who is based in Hong
Kong. Wong tells me that surveillance efforts are costly and difficult to conduct under very
threatening conditions. IFRA's field agents first must spend a few weeks watching and
evaluating factory operations to determine the production cycle, factory entrances, and
security surrounding the facility. The expensive cameras must be hidden so that the
company does not find them, typically quite some distance from the factory and requiring
use of a good zoom lens.


Once the factory logistics routine is established, IFRA trains a local operative to monitor
the facility and the camera, continuously, taking note of field conditions and any unusual
activity at the plant not caught on film. Sometimes the cameras get stolen, in which case a
backup camera is always on hand. Each day the local operative replaces the camera
batteries (usually in the darkness of night) and memory card. The previous day's footage
is then securely transferred to IFRA for processing. The local operatives are the heroes of
the operation. Several have been detained, questioned, and beaten by company security.
These brave souls protect investors in a way that neither SEC, FINRA nor PCAOB
auditors can do.


IFRA allowed me to review all the surveillance records it collected to date and let me
publish the most egregious "ghost factories" on my website with the hopes of getting IFRA
more business for their surveillance operation, which of course is funded by their clients
(both long and short). So far I have uploaded over 140 videos of the 5 idlest factories in
IFRA's collection.

Two of these ghost factories belong to China Integrated Energy (OTCPK:CBEH). IFRA's
video surveillance of these two plants in my opinion proved they were not shipping any
meaningful amount of biodiesel during the four months filmed. The stock was recently
halted and the company's audit committee chairman, Larry Goldman, director Christopher
Wang, and CFO Albert Pu and auditor KPMG have all since resigned (see 8-K's here and
here). CBEH's management refused to cooperate with a special investigation team led by
Pillsbury Law and Deloitte, both of whom also resigned according to the 8-K. In my view,
the video evidence against CBEH was insurmountable.


I believe the video evidence against SCEI is even more powerful. The three worst "ghost
factories" in IFRA's collection all belong to Sino Clean Energy (SCEI). All three of SCEI's
factories have little or no shipping or receiving activity (indicating little or no production
activity) in the films. These three factories account for 100% of SCEI's sales according to
its audited financials. A brief summary of the results of SCEI surveillance effort


follows:


Three "Ghost Factories" account for 100% of SCEI's Sales and Net
Income
Tongchuan (550,000 ton capacity): IFRA's video surveillance showed the plant shipped
an average of 4 tanker truckloads of CWSF per day in January and February. Compare
this to the 38 tanker truckloads management disclosed in shipping records on their
website (here). In March and April IFRA's surveillance showed absolutely no production
with the possible exception of April 7, when there were a number of tanker trucks entering
and exiting the facility. SCEI Chairman Baowen Ren responded May 3 with a letter to
shareholders (here), stating that IFRA's camera was located in the "wrong place" and that
the company produces CWSF mostly at night when electricity is cheaper. In an effort to

prove their point, management uploaded 10 days of its own security camera footage of its
weigh station in an attempt to refute the IFRA footage. However, as I show (here), IFRA's
camera was in fact properly positioned and focused on the same (and only) weigh station
and shipping area. IFRA's surveillance team confirmed that during the entire four months
in question the Tongchuan factory never shipped out CWSF at night and the lights inside
the factory were always off all night. Most alarmingly, I proved beyond a doubt that the 10
days and nights of security videos management uploaded were staged sometime after the
dates management claimed to film, due to the fact that many of the videos showed rainy
weather conditions whereas the official local weather during the 10 day period was
completely dry as confirmed by the local weather bureau and as shown correctly in IFRA's
surveillance videos.


Shenyang (300,000 ton capacity): In SEC filings SCEI claims it has five customers in
Shenyang with the largest customer, Haizhong Heat Resource Co., Ltd., accounting for
85% of the purported volume. In the May 3 letter to shareholders (here), management
claims that in addition to one company-owned delivery tanker truck, they lease 23 more
trucks. However, IFRA video surveillance only shows one company-owned truck delivering
one shipment each day through the end of March. Beginning April 1 (after the winter
heating season ended), IFRA video surveillance shows no shipments at all from the
Shenyang plant.


Dongguan (300,000 ton capacity): Despite management's claims that Dongguan has
been producing large amounts of CWSF in Q1, according to IFRA surveillance records
there has been no production activity to date at the Dongguan plant, the newest and best-
looking of SCEI's ghost factories. The company has two brand new tanker trucks bearing
SCEI's new Dongguan subsidiary's name parked inside the plant. The two trucks have not
moved during a month of surveillance, indicating no CWSF has been delivered to
customers.


I have now posted over 70 videos of SCEI's ghost factories to my SCEI Vimeo Channel. It
takes a long time to review all these videos, but anyone who does will clearly see the
almost total lack of production and shipping activity at the three plants that together
account for 100% of SCEI's sales and net income. I strongly believe that this evidence is
the gold standard of proof that during the four months in question (encompassing the
entire first quarter) SCEI generated very little sales or income. I hope that SCEI's auditor
will review the video evidence before signing off on the upcoming first quarter results in
which SCEI management already pre-announced $33.7 million in sales (press release
here). I believe the truth is less than 1/10 of that figure.

7:35AM Sino Clean Energy Aims to Take Legal Action Against Short Seller Attackers (SCEI) 3.50 : Co states that the
'fraudulent' attacks on Sino Clean Energy, were orchestrated and conducted by or on behalf of certain short sellers.
The Company recently responded to the false and defamatory allegations made by short sellers, including Alfred Little
and Geoinvesting. As is common with these coordinated attacks, Sino Clean Energy noticed dramatically increased
naked short selling activity in its common stock that coincided with the attacks by Alfred Little, publishing on
SeekingAlpha and elsewhere, and by Geoinvesting. The Company believes that such persons and others, who have
admitted that they have short positions in the Company's stock, are attempting to drive down Sino Clean Energy
share price artificially for their own financial benefit. The Company believes that the short sellers seek to accomplish
this goal by spreading fabricated market information and rumors. In addition to the very serious market manipulation
in which the short sellers have engaged, serious questions have been raised about the identity, and even the
existence, of the person (or persons) calling himself Alfred Little.

Hmmm. The letter from the company on their website says that your videos are false and misleading. They have
posted their own factory videos showing activity. What they said:


The videos Alfred Little posted of the Company’s Tongchuan facility spanned from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.,
conveniently leaving out our busiest time of the day. Further, his videos are misleading because they are focused only
on the area of our facility where we are currently in the process of constructing additional coal storage. He has not
included in any of his footage the primary production and transportation area of our facility. The Company’s security
cameras clearly show activity at our Tongchuan facility from midnight to 8:00 a.m. from April 20th through the 29th.
Video for this period of time can be accessed at the following link:  
www.sinocei.net/compan.... The Company’s surveillance cameras retain footage for 10 day periods before being
deleted. However, our most recent footage covers days prior to the “reports” issued by Geoinvesting and Alfred Little.
Furthermore, we have a log from our third party logistics company, Xi'an Kai Feng Transportation Company, Ltd.,
documenting the number of deliveries and the total amount of goods delivered at our Tongchuan facility from
November 2010 to February 2011. You can view these documents in Exhibit I located in the data room at the
Company’s website: ir.stockpr.com/sinocei.... In addition, of course the management, technical, general and
administrative and manufacturing staff spend the majority of their time inside our buildings. Someone camped outside
our facilities would not see more than 8-10 workers at any time. If they were really interested in presenting a valid

statement about our headcount, one would have thought that the short sellers would have asked to take a look inside.
No one working for Geoinvesting or Alfred Little, however, to the best of our knowledge, has ever stepped foot inside
any of our production facilities, including Tongchuan. Therefore, the photos and videos they took from outside our 
facilities during the slowest parts of our day are completely useless in assessing the actual business activity at our
plants.

ALFRED LITTLE" DOES NOT EXIT, USES FABRICATED BIOGRAPHY TO DEFRAUD THE GENERAL PUBLIC


The Company believes that "Alfred Little" is a fictitious character - a disguise used by one or more illegal short sellers
in the short sale scheme against DEER and other public companies. According to our investigation, "Alfred Little" is
not a real person. His "professional biography" published on his website and on SeekingAlpha.com was fabricated,
with the purpose to mislead and defraud the investing public. "Alfred Little's" published biography includes claims that
he had years of experience as an auditor at Deloitte, worked for large global companies and had years of investment
experience in China, published a book on China, etc. cannot be verified. Further, in the attack on DEER, "Alfred Little"
published a 3 month old prepaid phone card that was never used as his purported contact number for concerned
investors. In addition, "Alfred Little" quoted statements from several Chinese government officials as witnesses to
support his various false allegations against DEER. These Chinese officials in fact do not exist. "Alfred Little" further
made false allegations on his "channel checks" of Chinese retail stores while he failed to disclose his naked short
positions in DEER and ignored DEER's repeated public disclosure about the Company's product distribution process
as well as its corporate structure. "Alfred Little's" various articles, timely published in collusion with short sellers who
immediately sold large blocks of DEER's stock in market orders that intentionally created fear in the general public to
drive down DEER's share price. Short sellers have profited handsomely at the expense of DEER's thousands of
shareholders. DEER will continue its vigorous investigation and discovery of the network of illegal short sellers that
have damaged the reputation and destroyed value in U.S. listed public companies.

Alfred,


I have posted on other reports you have done. I can not stop thanking you for what you have created here. Again I do
not care about the truth, there are plenty of frauds, non frauds, fake, pumped, lied "legally" upgraded, downgraded
etc. out there. in simple YOU THE MAN AL and your making me MAD Money. Cramer is nothing at this point.


Anyway Keep up the good work or bad I DONT CARE, but do keep going. The most important part of this all is I hope
you do not get caught. I have a slight legal background and as long as there is SLIGHT truth to anything your in the
clear. If what you are doing is just lies, then umm don't get caught.


I honestly couldn't care less what people have to say. They are simply crying since they are not milking money. You
might be having a head start on me, but when you say short I go quite heavy. 
This is not becoming frankly easy. I know it wont last long, so I am using alot to deal with these situations. Even
DEER made me money. 
Anyway again keep it up stay safe and do not listen to what these naive and purely jealous people have to say. I know
I personally am in no legal wrong doing, and I am making a killing based on information provided. I have gone short
and long knowingly how this market WILL react to events in these stocks.


As we say you guys have been OWNED by Alfred Little.


Disclosure: I have profited from CBEH, DEER, CCME, SCEI, GFRE. By either going long or short depending on
information available to the public. I also disclose that due to the low volume in these stocks I have been able to
create movements though on a fractional basis based on my purchasing or selling.

Here's another proof SCEI's own factory videos are fabricated:


Check out the April 22 2011 video from 5:48 ‐ 05:58 (20110422054802_S_01.mpg) on their website here:
www.sinocei.net/compan...


at 0:19 of the video, you see a tanker truck exiting the factory gate with two giant Chinese characters on it saying 凯丰
运输 (Kai Feng Transportation). Those four characters are clearly sticked to the truck by hand not long ago. The
tanker truck was quite dirty, full of mud and dust but how come the four signs bearing the name of Kai Feng
Transportation name were exceptionally clean. Take a real close look at it and you should notice how bad SCEI is at
deceiving people.


Clearly the company has an intention to deceive investors and hide the dirt after its "ghost factory" has been exposed.
Sadly, they are pretty terrible liars.

凯丰运输 are four giant Chinese charaters, not two. There could be any number of reasons why they stand
out. But go learn counting to four first, if necessary, take off your shoes too, that way u can count to 22.


05 May 2011, 11:58 PM


Wholucan
So what you are saying is that the name of a transportation company is a reason to believe in a fraud? Never
thought of the idea that SCEI just works with more transportation companies? Or in this case that Kai Feng
Transportation is renting other transportation companies to meet there contract with SCEI, and therefor the
stickers of Kai Feng Transportation are put on top of the other transportation company? 
What a stupid idea, it seams more the truth to me that you are part of this conspiracy against SCEI


My question to you, how many short postions do you have on SCEI? Once everybody really does good
investigation, and takes a good look at the videos from Alfred and SCEI, it will be clear who is deceiving
investors. Shame on you!

Obviously you don't get the point. SCEI's own videos were clearly fabricated. I guess so many rats rushed to
buy the stock before they even take a look at any of those videos (thanks to SCEI to put them in a format
that's hard to read for any US investors). Again, check out he April 22 2011 video from 5:48 ‐ 05:58
(20110422054802_S_01.mpg) on their website from 0:13, anyone with some common sense will see how the
four extremely clean charactered were temporarily sticked to the muddy truck to put up the show.


On top of the fabricated Kai Feng trucks, how does SCEI explain the discrepancy that April 23 was in fact a
sunny day but their own "video" showed a rainy day with wet ground on the "same" day.


If your kids are into magic, you should get him/her to major in "creative accounting" in college, just like the
CFO of SCEI, CBEH and CCME.

I have an explaination for the weather, AL has faked the weather expert, there is no such person, I have
verified.  
There is a Kaifen transportation rental co. in Xi'an, they have the tanks, you know the company stamp in
China often are different from the official name. Hence, Geo's finding are completely bs.  
The only valid proof to me is if the company produce evidences of TAX filings, which as we all know, carries
far more weight than Al's videos which means nothing or Geo's Maj who can't find his way in China, am I
gonna unload the stock because Geo can't find the address or doesn't know how business is conducted? Btw,
China Northern Airlines still exists, well at the same address as the company provides, a merger in China
doesn't mean that the company is gone, people still use the old name often, Maj, wise up to that.

I can't help but wonder how someone (such as A.L.) watches months and months of "70" videos, in a short space of
time (days or weeks?) and determines what is actually on all those videos in order to determine who the bad guys are
(or are not) so he can short them and post hack attacks. The logistics of that boggle the mind.

or the "Company"), a leading producer and distributor of coal-water slurry fuel ("CWSF") in the People's Republic of
China ("China"), today announced that Baowen Ren, Chairman of Sino Clean Energy, purchased a total of 115,000
shares of the Company's stock in the open market using his personal funds.


On May 5, 2011, Mr. Ren filed a Form 4, which sets forth the number of shares and price per share of the purchases
made. A Form 4 must be filed with the SEC when any shareholder owning 10% or more of a company's common
stock purchases or sells shares. Mr. Ren currently owns a total of 3,387,855 million shares, representing 14.4% of the
Company.


"The easiest way for me to articulate my confidence in the Company to our shareholders is by using my own capital to
buy SCEI stock. I plan to further increase my ownership position in Sino Clean in the coming weeks," Mr. Ren stated.
"In the past year, we have considerably expanded our capacity and customer base while entering a new market in
Dongguan. China's healthy economic growth and favorable environment and energy policies provide a favorable
driver for further increases in CWSF demand."


I am sure the company will annouce a buy back next week, and probably issue a thank you to the Alfred Littles and
his crew for bringing the price down.

reseach???
Sino expects to release quarterly financials on May 15th, then they go and release preliminary financials on April 29th.
Do you think they released preliminary financials so that insiders like the CEO and possibly the Company could buy
back stock at these crazy undervalue prices the short sellers caused. Well this is my theory and it was just proved
right today 3:38 pm when the CEO exercised his right to buy. I think we will see Sino buying back stock next.....
.Thank You Alfred Little, Geo Investing and investigative crew( hahaha ) it is time to go long on Sino Clean.

I have covered on SCEI yesterday. I have used about 15% of the MASSIVE gains to actually go long. I do believe the
pop will come, but it's not worth a major investment since no one does it like AL does.


And for and fool saying anything about shorts... Trust me we covered. We really covered everything. Though I speak
for myself about going long from here. I will not say anything negative at this point since it is not in my interest. But for
those fools who cried and said everything they have said. You simply do not know how to take events and make them
into profits. 
TRADE 
Again thank you AL for what you have done. I hope you stay safe and give us some more soon

Peopless,


In ways you are right, traders should leave emotions completely out of trading and even though they might dislike
what Alfred Little is doing if its profitable it should be taken seriously. It is unethical but if you are pretty sure any stock
is going down, going short is obvious. Congratulations on your speculative gains.


"I will not say anything negative at this point since it is not in my interest." ~Peopless


Thats just plain wrong in my opinion, if you said negative statements in the past purely because it was in your own
interest has nothing to do with trading. You sir, lost all credibility.

Super Dave
Mr Little: If you are truly a real person, please respond to my comment and post a photo of yourself. Please also give
us detailed information of who you really are. Otherwise, it will be assumed that you are truly a fraud and the whole
story a hoax. If you are who you say you are, then buck up.

I think it's funny how all the longs are trying to create a conspiracy around Mr. Little, instead of addressing the
information that he is presenting. Since they seem to be fixated upon him, let's try to look at things from his
perspective for a moment.


Like it or not, IFRA and LIttle are trying to make money from their articles by generating interest in their research
operations and from shorting the stock. Since getting new research clients involves being correct on a consistent
basis, it's hard to understand why IFRA would try to falsify this much evidence video evidence, especially when it's a
lot easier just to spy on bogus factories and catch them in the act. Logistically, just think about the resources IFRA
would need to fake that much video, wouldn't we be able to spot discrepancies like Little found in the company videos
and even if you couldn't spot discrepancies, wouldn't it just be easier to sit outside of a ghost factory and then figure
out who owns it? Considering that they've monitored a large number of locations, why would they choose to fake it
now, when it easier to cast a wide net and then focus on the most serious offenders?


If IFRA were in it for a quick trade, maybe you could make the case that the evidence is just trying to scare investors,
but IFRA has already been right more than once now, which suggests they have more to lose by lying, then they
would by faking the truth.


If Mr. Little is the one with the nefarious intentions, why would he pick a company with real earnings and explosive
growth, when he has IFRA's treasure trove of data to comb through first? Wouldn't you target the obvious frauds first?
That way even if their investors didn't take the bait and panic, you'd still have a decent chance that it would fall apart
anyway. It wouldn't make sense for him to short the company if the activity that he observed was consistent with the
SEC filings and if he was just randomly making this up, then it should be a lot easier then it's been for the company to
prove that his videos are wrong.

I disagree. Try to think this way, unlike CCME or CEBH, which are unknown in the industry, SCEI is a leader
in CWSF according to independent research reports (a.o. Frost on CWSF). There is little doubt on my mind
that CWSF has tremendous demand in China, so how can a leading player in a strategic clean energy fuel
have no meaningful production? That would imply the entire industry is non existent. How ridiculous!

IFRA and AL are not trustworthy? Anyone can make a bunch of video to prove anything, it's naive to base your
investment decision on "video evidences from shorts". Wouldn't they have a motive to lie, you bet! Why would they
pick SCEI? Who knows, easier to succeed maybe? But did they question the existence of the plants? Did they
question the booming demand for CWSF? Did they question the leading position of SCEI in CWSF? Reversely I'd say
if SCEI is a leading player in CWSF and if indeed SCEI produces nothing, then CWSF industry in China equals zero,
which is clearly wrong. That aside, did AL question the cash? Did he question the investments the company is
making? Did he question Chairman buying the stock at 3+? All these lead me to believe that SCEI is at least real and
worth more than 3+, no point for Chairman to threw good money after bad if it isn't. Study the history of the CEOs buy
backs, how often did that result in a loss for them? How often does that lead to multi bags in the following year or 2?

"Anyone can make a bunch of video to prove anything,"


Thats funny, SCEI tried to produce video footage as well but all it did was prove their willingness to lie.

The Chairman owns approx 14.4% of SCEI which has a market cap of $45 million at a share price around
$2.00. This puts his ownership value around $6.5 million. His purchase of 115,000 share is a drop in the
bucket compared to the losses he will experience if/when this company is proved to be a shell and his 14.4%
is worth nothing. I view this purchase of stock as a last ditch effort to keep the ship afloat. He really has no
other options. Regardless the stock will tank and he will lose all his investment. He might as well throw a few
hundred thousand dollars at it and see if a miracle happens.

User 386985
Really no other options? How about buy back of 20 million? An insider rarely threws a few hundred k just to
see if a mircale happens, you are naive but not innoncent.


09 May 2011, 07:24 PM


User 386985
How so? Why should I believe ALs video anymore than SCEIs? Both have motives to lie and at least one of
them did lie. I want to see the true value of the stock, and buy low sell high, that's all I care.

ThePupper
The authorization of a buyback does not obligate the company to repurchase shares. It is only an
authorization. I wouldn't put too much weight in that announcement.


An insider might throw a few hundred thousand at an investment as a last ditch effort. Hes got $7 million tied
up in this company. Whats a few hundred thousand to try to get a run. IMO.


I dont know what your trying to imply with the innocent thing. I am only stating my opinion of whats going on. I
have no positions in SCEI. Seems you may have more to worry about than I do.

"alfred", I'm trying to make sense of this whole mess. Are you guys saying that you had people watching for shipping
trucks 24/7 even during the night from midnight to 8am for several months? Night surveillance would be extraordinary.

It's not possible. According to AL, their field operative got beaten up by the company tugs, yet, next day the
hero show up again, at the same spot, continue to film, as the videos would suggest. According to AL, thier
video camera got taken/stolen, so they place a new one there, as if the thieves are so stupid that they will not
come back tomorrow to check whether there is a new one? So how many cameras have AL bought? He has
to be the largest camera buyer of the world.  
Unfortunately all these videos mean nothing, anyone apparently can come up with videos these days, proving
dead people resurrect or his dog can fly. What does all these mean at all? Absolutely nothing. In fact, if the
frauds know someone is filming them, they could just put a show, reducing AL's video to zero value even if he
really did film them. Most of the videos, if I have to guess, are Photoshopped.

To date, SCEI has yet address the fact that they installed the video cameras to fabricate production videos AFTER
their ghost factories have been exposed.
