Alliance Resource Partners long term changes
 
This is the second post in my Alliance Resources series. The first post is here.  
 
When I get researching a company I have been known to read very old filings just to see how
business has changed over time. In a case like Alliance Resource Partners this is critical. ARLP is by-
far the best performed coal mining company in America and it has had the same management team
since the late 1990s. The changes since that time have all be wrought by management and
circumstance. 
 
This company's record is so extraordinary that it is worth understanding it in a very long term manner. 
 
So I started with the oldest Alliance Resources 10-K in the SEC database. 
 
From the form 10-K for the fiscal year 1999 here are the balance sheet:

You will see that gross plant and equipment was $278 million with $103 million of accumulated
depreciation.
 
Here is the production data as given from the same form 10-K.


In 1999, we produced 14.1 million tons of coal and sold 15.0 million tons of coal. The
coal we produced in 1999 was 19.9% low-sulfur coal, 19.9% medium-sulfur coal and
60.2% high-sulfur coal. In 1999, approximately 85% of our medium- and high-sulfur coal
was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices, also known as
"scrubbers," to remove sulfur dioxide.


We can work out that they thus produced 2.8 million tons of low sulfur coal, 2.8 million tons of medium
sulfur coal and 8.5 million tons of high sulfur coal.
 
The gross plant and equipment needed to produce a ton of coal was (278/14.1=) $19.7. In other
words each ton of production required $19.7 worth of property plant and equipment at cost.
 
The above mentioned 10-K gave us some operating data as well:

In those days revenue per ton of coal was $23.12 and costs per ton was $18.75. The margin was just
under $6 per ton. Maintenance capital expenditure was $6 million - or about 43c per ton of coal
produced.
 
Depreciation, depletion and amortization was $39.7 million or $2.82 per ton.
 
The company also gave employment data:


EMPLOYEES 


We have approximately 1,360 employees, including 100 corporate employees and
1,260 employees involved in active mining operations. Our work-force is entirely union-
free. Relations with our employees are generally good, and there have been no recent
work stoppages or union organizing campaigns among our employees.


You can work out from this that each employee produced 10,367 tons of coal annually, each mine
employee roughly 11,200 tons of coal annually.
 
To see the changes wrought we need to compare to the latest 10-K. 
 
Here is the most recent balance sheet:

And here is the production data: 


 In 2012, we sold a record 35.2 million tons of coal and produced a record 34.8 million tons of
coal, of which 3.8% was low-sulfur coal, 18.8% was medium-sulfur coal and 77.4% was high-
sulfur coal. In 2012, we sold 93.1% of our total tons to electric utilities, of which 98.7% was sold
to utility plants with installed pollution control devices.


Again we can work out that they produced 1.3 million tons of low sulfur coal, 6.5 million tons of
medium sulfur coal and 26.9 million tons of high sulfur coal. 
 
Note that the (high value) low sulfur coal has declined in both relative and absolute terms and this has
become almost entirely a high-sulfur coal company company dependent on plants with sulfur
scrubbers. 
 
The most profound change is just how capital intensive this business has become. The company has
now employed $2,362 million in gross property, plant and equipment with accumulated depreciation of
823 million. 
 
Bluntly - the amount of capital employed here has risen enormously. The gross property, plant and
equipment per ton of coal produced is now $67.87 - up a long way from $19.70 per ton. 
 
The last 12 years in the US have not been a period of massive inflation - and the rise in capital
intensity of this business is - well - surprising. The capital intensity of this business has gone up 345
percent. The capital employed per incremental ton of capacity is very large indeed. 
 
Here are the employee numbers from the last form 10-K: 


To conduct our operations, as of February 1, 2013, we employed 4,345 full-time employees,
including 4,091 employees involved in active mining operations, 86 employees in other
operations, and 168 corporate employees. Our work force is entirely union-free. We believe that
relations with our employees are generally good.


From this we see what I think is the most unusual thing about all the giant capital spend at Alliance
Resource Partners. The huge capital equipment spend has not improved labor productivity.
Production is now 8009 tons per employee per year - and about 8500 tons per mining employee per
year. 
 
Despite all that capital equipment spend labor productivity has dropped by more than 20 percent.
Strange.

Moreover the non-mine employees have risen from to 100 to 254 - a rise somewhat faster than the
total production has grown. Labor productivity has dropped and the company has become
more bureaucratic white-collar heavy. 
 
The company also publishes a long list of operating metrics in the 10-K.

We can work out a few more things here - for instance the maintenance capital expenditures are now
282.6 million dollars annually. That is $8.12 per ton produced per year. Back in 1999 maintenance
capital expenditure was only 43c per ton produced per year. 
 
That is an 18 fold increase in maintenance requirements per ton produced per year. 
 
An unmitigated record of operational failure 
 
This is very puzzling indeed. Financially this is the best performed coal operation in North America -
the stock price is near the all time high. The distributions paid by this MLP are large and increasing.
People sing the praises of this management team (particularly on Seeking Alpha but also in the
comments on my blog). 
 
But the operational facts on the ground tell a radically different story. This management team
demonstrate unparalleled operational failure. The company has radically increased its capital
expenditure - and the capital intensity of the business has gone up roughly 350 percent. This is a big-
spending management team. 
 
Despite that (and despite their non-unionized workforce) labor productivity has dropped more than 20
percent. And the workforce has become more bureaucratic.

Finally all this new - and seemingly expensive machinery - needs to be maintained. And the
maintenance expenditure which was once only 43c per ton per year (less than 2 percent of the price
received per ton of coal) is now over $8 per ton of output (over 14 percent of the price received per
ton). This business is way more expensive to maintain. 
 
On an operational level this is seemingly the worst run mining operation in the United States (and I
am including the bankrupt Patriot Coal). And yet the company has had unparalleled financial success. 
 
Why this might be is the subject of a few more posts.

Hi John 
 
Declining productivity and increased capital intensity in a mining company are not
necessarily the result of poor management. You can only come to that conclusion if you
make the assumption that their reserves and resources are totally uniform. I don't know
Alliance but most older mining businesses end up working the deeper/peripheral parts of
their reserves, with significantly different extraction economics. So there is a chance that
management could actually be doing a great job given the grade and depth of their
current resources compared to history.

I agree - they may have a stuff resource... I should correct - But hey - if they have a
stuffed resource then they are also unlikely to be the best performing coal mining
company in America. 
 
So it is still something else.

their op margin per ton in the last 4 years has been 40%, 40%, 46% and 46% -- these are
not just neat numbers; they are also dramatically rising numbers; from which I conclude
that their customers are idiots and their competitors inept fools. another conclusion is that
their coal is intellectual-property protected high-tech coal with intuitive user interface and
a really responsive touch-screen

We looked at James River Coal a few years ago, who locked in high pricing and was over
earning for some time but is high cost. I guess the question is how much are they over
earning based on their contract pricing and when does this fall off? Not much disclosure
in their 10-K that I could find on their contract pricing, although they say customers can
renegotiate.

never looked at ARLP, but they should get a slight premium for their coal because they
have good river access. 35% barges is high for coal shipments and barges are obviously
cheapest method of transportation. "Approximately 52.3% of our 2012 sales volume was
initially shipped from the mines by rail, 13.1% was shipped from the mines by truck and
34.6% was shipped from the mines by barge. In 2012, the largest volume transporter of
our coal shipments was the CSX railroad which moved approximately 33.0% of our
tonnage over its rail system."

Declining capital efficiency for resources companies from 1999 to 2012 is hardly
surprising. Just a correlary of the commodity boom that occured in the period - hard to
base a short case just on that. Examples:  
 
XOM - gross pp&e / production up 2.2x from 1999 to 2012. this is possibly the best run
resource company around. 
 
CVX, another well run company has that metric up 2.9x during the same period. 
 
Alliance up 3.6x so higher but not orders of magnitude. The 1999-2008 period saw not
only a large boom in commodity prices (be it oil or coal), but the capital costs to get these
out of the ground...

John, 
as other commented, I believe the rising cap expenditure going up is to be expected (and
I blame Australia! :) ). That said, mining companies should be fairly comparable - you're
digging up commodity and shipping it off, so managing the costs (even if they are rising
due to factors outside of your control) is key. I don't know how they compare on
costs/productivity with other US miners (and don't have time to do so, but assume you
did), but if the metrics are more or less the same, someone is cooking with gas, not coal.

Nice catch, John. ARLP's customer base looks a lot like patriot's, revenue is about
patriot's, a small mining operation somewhat larger than James River. 
 
Market cap is 2x Arch's, more than 2x cloud peak's. Insane. Price to book, price to sales,
totally insane. I am mad. 
 
You should talk dirty more often.

The drop in labor productivity is the most surprising part to me -- higher than I had
expected. That said, productivity in the entire coal industry has been dropping for a
number of years... (early 2000s?)

I think I worked out WHY the operating margin per ton HAS to rise: 
 
1. assume that your business model calls for eternally rising profits (i.e. the show blows
up if the music stops playing) 
 
2. assume further that you are not realistically able to fake your dollar sales (because you
only have 10 clients of whom all are public entities) and 
 
3. that you are unable to fake the tons (because they belong to someone else to whom
you pay royalties) 
 
THEN IT FOLLOWS that THE ONLY WAY you can show rising profits is by showing rising
operating margin per ton. 
 
and hence, presto, the ARLP operating margin rises from peer high of 40% to
astronomical 46%. 
 
the problem is... what next? you have already shown 46% operating profit per ton twice in
a row... the business model calls for another rise this year. are you going to report a 54%
operating margin per ton? 
 
or are you going to do something creative? perhaps... buy someone in a humongously
accretive transaction. 
 
buy... RNO? 
 
(incidentally, when did you say ARLP runs into loan their covenants?)

They look like an Australian coal operation. They are simply relying on price pressure to
keep themselves profitable. It's a dangerous game, as we've discovered, particularly with
the rubbish they are mining. Their management team seems to have been focussed on
sales, and ramping up production into those contracts. If the contracts fall over they will
lock the gates.

I may sound stupid here, but if you cannot fake your sales and purchases (see post 2:53
AM), how do you raise the operating profit margin? 
All I can imagine is that all future oriented costs are not or incompletely booked
(environmental, maintenance, water treatment, retirement obligations, ...). 
Every cents of investment is spend to achieve higher volume, and all other costs are
ignored.
