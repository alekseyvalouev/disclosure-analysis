Affymax Likely Worthless: Omontys Kills At Least 9x More People
Than Epogen
Aug. 28, 2013 1:10 PM ET126 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Affymax, Inc. (AFFY) is a shell company that owns potential future royalty and milestone
payments associated with the recently recalled drug Omontys (peginesatide). The odds
are stacked against AFFY shareholders getting any money out of Omontys and we think
Affymax is most likely worthless for the following reasons:


1. Omontys isn't safe (but Epogen is)


2. Takeda (OTCPK:TKPHF) doesn't think Omontys is coming back


3. Competition is lurking around the corner


4. Dialysis centers have been burned


5. The road back requires too many stars to align


Omontys isn't safe but Epogen is


Omontys is a synthetic, peptide-based erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) designed to
stimulate production of red blood cells used in the treatment of chronic kidney disease.
Omontys was approved for the treatment of anemia in adult patients in March 2012 and
was thought to present a challenge to Amgen's incumbent drug, Epogen. After Affymax
and Takeda (collaboration partner) commercialized Omontys in the U.S. in 3Q 2012, the
drug was "voluntarily" recalled in February of this year due to serious hypersensitivity
reactions, including anaphylaxis resulting in death in certain instances. According to a
WSJ article citing information obtained under the FOIA, severe allergic reactions actually
began in August 2012. This was followed by relabeling of the drug in November (revised
label here).


This compares to Amgen's Epogen, which has been administered in the U.S. since 1989
for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. Epogen has a
significantly lower incidence of reported adverse events than Omontys. Baird research
analyst Christopher Raymond conducted the following analysis in a report published on
February 25, 2013:

In a New York Times article dated February 25, 2013, Dr. Daniel W. Coyne, a kidney
specialist at Washington University in St. Louis was quoted saying, "two in 10,000 deaths
on first exposure is unacceptable, compared to nothing like this [with Epogen]", so it's no
surprise that given the safety and efficacy of Epogen, dialysis centers have flocked back
to it in the wake of the Omontys recall. In fact, on its second quarter earnings call, Amgen
noted "Epogen was up 15% quarter-over-quarter due to increased unit demand as a result
of the peginesatide [Omontys] recall …"


The approximate equivalent of the FDA in Europe also believes that Omontys is unsafe,
especially in comparison to other drugs available on the market. In response to Takeda's
withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisation Application for Omontys, the Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), had this to say (emphasis added):

On its 1Q 2014 earnings call held on July 31, 2013, Takeda said the following with respect
to Omontys: "While Takeda has been working actively to investigate the root cause of
these hypersensitivity reactions, the investigations and the root cause analysis and the
determination of the risk mitigation plan is difficult to be completed during the European
MAA procedure time frame." That sounded to us like Takeda didn't yet know what went
wrong.


We spoke to investor relations at Takeda after the call and confirmed that Takeda hasn't
figured out the cause yet. Takeda specifically noted that they could not exclude the
possibility that something was wrong with the drug itself, and that they are not including
Omontys in the company's financial forecast. The individual we spoke to at Takeda
expressed great skepticism in the possibility of Omontys being reintroduced in the United
States or elsewhere, and went so far as to say, "Although it's not completely dead, it's
going to realistically be very, very difficult for it [Omontys] to come back."


Competition is lurking around the corner


Alternatives to Epogen with some of the same cost and efficiency benefits that Omontys
touts have been safely administered in other parts of the world and may make their way to
the U.S. in short order. Mircera, for example, with once-every-four-week intravenous or
subcutaneous dosing, has been in use in Europe since 2007 and in Japan since 2011.
Mircera is already approved for use in the United States by the FDA (November 2007),
and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) has the ability to begin selling this drug in the United States
in mid-2014 under the terms of a settlement agreement between Roche and Amgen
(NASDAQ:AMGN). When the CEO of Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) was recently
asked about Fresenius's interest in using Mircera in the United States, he had this to say:
"If it was left up to me, I'd try to go buy some tomorrow …"


Affymax clearly recognized this risk and disclosed it in its most recent 10-K, stating, "
[Mircera] has been enjoined from being sold in the U.S. until mid-2014 under the terms of
a limited license. If Mircera enters the U.S. market, we believe it will be in direct
competition with OMONTYS, if we are able to reintroduce the product, because of
Mircera's ability to be long-acting; therefore, it could potentially limit the market for
OMONTYS."


Furthermore, ex-CEO, John Orwin had this to say on the Affymax 1Q 2012 earnings call:
"… in the case of both biosimilars and Mircera, it's very important for us to have converted
a substantial part, a meaningful part, of this market over to once-monthly OMONTYS in

advance of those products being introduced … we believe that it's really critical for us to
have converted a large piece of this market to OMONTYS well in advance of the
introduction of those products."


Dialysis centers have been burned


In a research reported dated March 4, 2013, Lazard analyst Joshua Schimmer had this to
say about Omontys and its unlikely future re-adoption by dialysis organizations after
speaking to a dialysis specialist:


Epogen has been the gold standard ESA for over two decades in large part due to its
track record of safety and efficacy. This is reinforced by Fresenius moving its patients who
were on Omontys back to Epogen following their pilot.


In our conversations with Fresenius, they indicated to us that limiting the frequency of
serious adverse events was "the most important thing" and that Fresenius is not going to
"risk its franchise on a drug with unknowns like Omontys" given the years and years of
data that is available on Epogen and Mircera (which Fresenius has experience within their
European operations).


The road back requires too many stars to align


We think that something like the path laid out below would be the most likely road for
Takeda to bring Omontys back to the market in the United States:


(i) Generate a hypothesis regarding what is likely wrong with Omontys,


(ii) Determine that it is ethical to run a clinical trial to confirm the hypothesis,


(iii) Design a trial and convince the FDA to permit the trial,


(iv) Run a clinical trial that complies with FDA requirements in order to test the hypothesis,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1662162-affymax-likely-worthless-omontys-kills-at-least-9x-more-people-than-epogen 5/37


(v) Receive FDA approval to reintroduce Omontys to the market (separate and apart from
running a compliant clinical trial),


(vi) Embark on a substantial marketing and physician education effort to get nephrologists
back on board with a drug that has previously been recalled, and


(vii) Secure dialysis organization support in light of the dialysis providers being burned the
first time around.


We have substantial doubts that on the basis of ethics, that the FDA or a human subjects
review board would approve a further clinical trial for Omontys given the potential risk
compared to the nonexistent potential benefit. David Wendler, a researcher in the NIH
Clinical Center Department of Bioethics writes: "Many endorse the view that clinical
research studies which offer no potential benefit to subjects and pose a high chance of
serious risk, such as death, are unethical, independent of the magnitude of the social
value to be gained." There are other drugs which are more effective and cause fewer
serious adverse reactions. Moreover, Omontys is not a disease-altering drug.


If Takeda successfully navigates Omontys back to the U.S. market, then Affymax
shareholders still need the company to NOT run out of cash. The legal bills related to the
multiple shareholder lawsuits that have been filed will not be cheap, The Brenner Group is
also earning fees for running the company, and there remain additional liabilities that need
to be paid, such as the recently renegotiated office lease.


After all of that, Affymax shareholders can look forward to a $10mm milestone payment
(~26c/share) upon the "first commercial sale after reintroduction of Omontys in the U.S.",
and some highly uncertain future royalty stream that might not be worth anything at all if
competition in the form of biosimilars (Hospira is in Phase III of clinical trials on Retacrit) or
Mircera has made headway into the U.S. market.


The bull case is far fetched


Since May, AFFY has been the subject of four articles by EXPstocktrader pumping the
"Huge Speculative Upside" in the company's shares predicated on a "sensible conclusion
that Omontys returns to market" for which we can find no factual support. The bull case
rests on the idea that something other than the drug itself is the root cause of the adverse
reactions suffered by patients who were administered Omontys. There is no evidence to
support this. As noted in the Adverse Event Comparison table above, Omontys's
performance was vastly inferior to Epogen's performance on all measures of adverse
events, not just deaths. Furthermore, on Fresenius Medical Care's 2Q 2013 earnings call

held on 7/30/13, Fresenius CEO Rice Powell said, "… Takeda has been working FDA and
they are just almost at the point of getting agreement with FDA on a study that will be
done in our clinics. It is a DNA-type of study where they're going to be trying to understand
what could potentially be within the individuals that had the reactions, is there something
we can learn or understand there … we'll be participating in the study and don't know how
long it will take." That does not sound like a CEO who is optimistic about any
reintroduction of Omontys at all, let alone a swift one. Also, a "DNA-type of study" does
not suggest Takeda is focused on isolating specific human error involved in manufacturing
or administering the drug.


It is often cited that there are $180mm of potential Omontys-related milestone payments
that Affymax would be entitled to subject to certain process and sales milestones. This
figure grossly overstates what is realistically possible. $150mm of the $180mm of
milestone payments are related to sales goals outside of the U.S. In Europe, the CHMP
statement above clearly indicates that Omontys was not going to be approved even before
considering the negative safety data that has subsequently caused the drug's withdrawal
from the U.S. market. In Japan, Takeda stated back in 2011 that it would not
commercialize Omontys. Our conversations with Takeda IR have indicated that Europe
and Japan have always been distant secondary and tertiary markets, respectively, given
the challenging competitive dynamics in those markets.


A plausible bull case based on Omontys sales in the United States resulting from a swift
reintroduction of the drug would contain these components:


§ $10mm milestone payment upon "first commercial sale after reintroduction of Omontys
in the U.S."


§ $20mm additional milestone payments from "U.S. sales-based milestones"


§ 15% royalty on U.S. sales (using the midpoint of the company's disclosure that "royalties
are tiered in the range of 13% to 17% with respect to net sales in the U.S."


Prior to the recall, consensus estimates for Omontys sales in the U.S. in 2014 were
approximately $250mm, implying $37.5mm in royalty payments at a 15% average royalty
rate. Assuming Takeda is able to re-commercialize Omontys beginning in 2016 at this
level and there are minimal sales after the patent expiry in 2024, we estimate the potential
royalty payments are worth $4.38 in a best case scenario excluding the benefit of NOLs.

Affymax's ability to utilize its NOLs is highly suspect, and even the company
acknowledges this in its public filings: "An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize
our NOL and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such
'ownership change'. Prior to 2013, we experienced ownership changes as defined in
Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. Due to our announcement of our
voluntary recall of Omontys in February 2013, there has been an extremely high volume of
trading of our stock…as a result of the high trading volume, there may be a shift of
ownership amongst our 5% stockholders that could result in an ownership change …"


This is a very generous valuation because it assumes that Omontys is able to reach new
all-time record sales even though it will almost certainly be shunned, at least in the early
years of its reintroduction. Also, this valuation does not take into account other potential
liabilities such as the $8mm+ advance from Takeda, expenses from the shareholder
lawsuits and the potential for significant limitations on the company's usage of its
previously accumulated net operating losses to offset potential royalty payments. In reality,
$4.38 per share is probably way too high as an upside case, but we present it as a low-
probability risk to being short.

Comments (126)


Our price target for AFFY is $0.44 per share, but the most likely outcome is that the stock
is worthless. Our target price is based on a probability weighted basis whereby we assign
a 90% probability to Omontys being worthless, and a 10% probability to the upside case of
$4.38 per share, implying a $0.44 expected value. However, we believe that the data
overwhelmingly shows Omontys is unsafe, too many bridges have been burned (FDA,
dialysis centers, nephrologists, patients who suffered adverse reactions), and the hurdles
for reintroduction are far too high. Therefore the most likely outcome is that Omontys
never comes back and the Company is worthless. Remember, Ex-CEO John Orwin was
selling at $1.02 a share on 6/27/13, and the folks at The Brenner Group now running the
company are self-proclaimed experts "in guiding companies through bankruptcies,
liquidation and wind downs."


Disclosure: I am short AFFY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Nice try. Your thesis is all wrong and full of all types of holes. Takeda has offered an ongoing royalty agreement worth
$180MM for WW sales, not just in the USA.


Takeda, Affy and Fresenius have a Huge Vested interest in getting OMONTYS back on the market.


If the Comapny was going under it would have done so several months ago and NOT PAID OFF ALL THE BANKS,
SUPPLIERS, REAL ESTATE LEASE, etc...


THANK YOU for providing this very nice buying opportunity!

My group has done EXTENSIVE interviews with real medical professionals in the Nephrology and biotech industry
and they agree that THE DRUG WORKED IN THE TRIALS and should be placed back on the market.

milestones are related to sales in the US. We already know that regardless of what the FDA decides that
Omontys is very unlikely to ever be sold anywhere ex-US.


Most importantly, the evidence is CLEAR that Omontys is HIGHLY UNLIKELY to ever be reintroduced back to
the US. In this case, AFFY is worthless. I think the stock ultimately goes to zero. the $0.44 price target is
based on a probability weighted scenario.


28 Aug 2013, 01:24 PM


Jim Long
The statement "the evidence is CLEAR that Omontys is HIGHLY UNLIKELY to ever be reintroduced back to
the US" is without substantiating facts and totally illogical. Historical patterns give no evidence that support
your statement. Takeda's investment isn't one to walk away from hence adding more illogical conclusions on
your behalf.


Your article is just more of the same bear scat that GWP and thegreycorner have been spewing for months.
Like their unsubstantiated statements and conclusions we will call yours a WC flush. Try harder next time.
The cutting and pasting also needs improving as the info barely has relevance.

Author’s reply »  Did you bother to read the chart that shows adverse events are 9+x more likely with
Omontys than with Epogen? There is no reason for the FDA to let Omontys back on the market with this
terrible relative safety profile. Frankly, they probably can't even get a trial done to demonstrate that Omontys
is safe because such a trial would be unethical to run. IMO, Omontys is dead and worthless.

Author’s reply »  This is an article that suggests shorting the stock just like your last article suggested buying
the stock. The difference is that your article was based on the speculation that all the problems were human
error, which is an entirely unsupported speculation. My article, on the other hand, showed evidence that
Omontys is at least 9x more dangerous than Epogen and gave evidence to support the conclusion that the
path back to market is very unlikely.

pharmaman58
Alpha-- 
Right, I remember you from shorting UNXL. You are a good researcher, a very clever wordsmith and a very
good fact selector.


For example:


1. You claim in your AFFY piece that OMONTYS causes more deaths than Amgen's Epogen. But you fail to
mention that you are dealing in tiny fractions of a percentage for fatalities in both products--and fatality
percentages far smaller than many, many approved drugs.


2. You claim to have spoken with Takeda's IR department, and report their negativity about re-launch of
OMONTYS in the US. But true to form, you do not mention the person's name. I have been in touch with the
Takeda IR department on several occasions and received far different information--they would not comment
at all on OMONTYS except to repeat what is public record of their investigation. Since my information is a few
months old, I will re-call the IR department and reconfirm their position and read them your statements. But in
the meantime, let me pose a question: Takeda has published no discouraging news about the re-launch of
OMONTYS, and that being the case, what are the chances a rogue IR person provides news to you that is
different than the public statements. My bet? That person would no longer be employed the next time you call.


28 Aug 2013, 05:07 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Small fractions can be statistically meaningful when spread over large patient populations
and when they are meaningfully larger than the alternative treatments, especially when no relative treatment
benefit is demonstrated. This is the case with Omontys and the reason it was withdrawn from the market.


As regards Takeda IR, I did not ask permission to quote the person I spoke with, so I will refrain from
revealing their name. I would be interested to know if anyone gets a different answer from them.

As regards UNXL, I have started shorting it again in the last few days after covering post my SEC article. I
don't think they will be able to ship in Q4 (and maybe not ever). When they report that they will not have
computers with Uniboss available in Q4, I expect the stock to go down a lot.


28 Aug 2013, 05:15 PM


pharmaman58
No, no, no.


OMONTYS is far less expensive than Epogen and administered far less often to achieve the same or better
clinical results. But of course, you already know this because you are a very thorough researcher.


As to Takeda IR, you do not need permission to state the name of your contact unless they specifically told
you the comments were private, which has never happened to me and I have spoken to well over a hundred
IR people in my tenure. IR people are empowered to speak officially for the company, that is their job. They
likely knew you were calling to potentially publish the information provided.


But this is easily solved. Provide the name of the IR person you spoke with (get their permission first if you
choose, and know they can not and will not deny permission). I will call that person, check your facts, and
then issue a public apology here in this forum if your information is accurate.


28 Aug 2013, 05:55 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The advantage of Omontys was cost. Unfortunately, it was significantly less safe than
Epogen and was removed from the market. In my opinion, this constitutes a worse clinical outcome. Given
the safety data we now have, there is no rational argument that Omontys achieved "the same or better clinical
results."


I have no desire to ask Takeda to go on the record on this. Most likely, that would cut off my future access to
them. If you want to post who you speak with, I will consider confirming either that it is the same person or a
different one.

Alpha--


Of course you also know that 2 of the 5 deaths associated with OMONTYS IV administration have since been
determined to be cardiovascular related.


And you know that with either number--3 or 5 associated deaths, you are splitting hairs here and making the
numbers dance to your short tune.


Take the 25,000 OMONTYS doses and multiply x 10.4 to equalize with the 260,000 Epogen doses. Now take
the 5 OMONTYS associated fatalities you cite and use the same 10.4 multiplier. Projects out to 52 fatalities
per 260,000 OMONTYS doses, slightly less than Epogen.

All ESAs have side effects and likely cause a very low number of fatalities inthis highly compromised patient
population--but again you already know this.

Author’s reply »  I have read the company's press release which says that 2 of the deaths were
cardiovascular in nature. Even if you exclude these deaths, there were still 3/25,000 that died. This is a rate of
0.012% as compared to 0.0027% per the Baird analyst on a per patient exposure basis. Since Epo is given
more frequently, you need to look at it on a per patient exposure basis. Just look at the quote from the NY
Times: "two in 10,000 deaths on first exposure is unacceptable, compared to nothing like this [with Epogen]"

Exactly...the author is the same one who has posted thousands of times on YMB (you can tell by exactly
what/how he cites) with a changed name to protect his not so veiled identity.


Affymax has more than sufficient financial reserves (and no further debt to be administered) to survive for
YEARS on their current spend rate (which has been reduced to the bare minimum, as assets have been sold
off and all employees are gone). In its place is the recently Amended Agreement between Takeda and
Affymax that establishes SIGNIFICANT milestone payment and a PERPETUAL WORLDWIDE ROYALTY
SCHEDULE that is available for all to see. The "play" in Affymax IS this Amended Agreement.


For those of you who have any concerns about the current state of Affymax you are strongly encourage to
contact Wes Rose of The Brenner Group who is the acting President of Affymax. Brenner Group is a highly
regarded TURNAROUND Consulting Company that happens to periodically do some bankruptcy work. He
will let you know that TBG was hired to place Affymax in a position to WAIT until Takeda's Investigation into
Omontys has been completed and they have done extraordinary work cleaning up the balance sheet and
lowering monthly expenses to a slow "drip" to wait out the completion of the investigation.


The author of this piece has argued that there are all kinds of liabilities and has even slipped and said that
they are CONTINGENT LIABILITIES which is 100% correct...Contingent far out into the future and of two
varieties:


1. Class action investor suits, which disappear once the basis of the stock price decline has been established
as NOT the fault of Omontys (Takeda/Affymax's drug under debate). The actions taken by Takeda and
Affymax to VOLUNTARILY REMOVE Omontys from the market were out of an abundance of caution BUT did
severely hit Affymax's ability to continue, though under TBG that is no longer a problem well out into the
future. Omontys is restored, these actions have no teeth and will in one form or another disappear...though
the author will NEVER give that up!


2. The product liability claims (by the 3 fatalities families) also disappears once Omontys has been cleared of
fault as HUMAN ERROR is by far the most likely cause of those 3 fatalities. IF it was an Anapylactic reaction,
as was identified during the FDA trials as a potential (AND STILL PASSED BY THE FDA) this is an
immediately remediable reaction IF handled on a timely and proper basis (nothing more than an EPI-PEN

injection). So it would have to be something OTHER THAN ANAPHYLAXIS for Affymax and Takeda to have
product liability here. And the probability that if there were another serious issue with Omontys that the
adverse effects incidence rate would have been INORDINATELY HIGHER than 3 deaths and 90 serious
reactions. And even should this highly remote possibility be legitimized as long as proper remedies are
applied and tested to insure the drug is safe should allow Omontys to be returned...BUT THIS IS THE ONLY
"IF" condition left and the probabilities of it being proven to be something other than Anaphylaxis (given that
ALL 3 fatalities occurred within 30 minutes of FIRST TIME ADMINISTRATION of Omontys and ONLY ON by
those who received the drug Intravenously) it points square on to Anaphylaxis...As HUMAN ERROR, Product
Liability evaporates and responsibility shifts to Fresenius, the Dialysis company where all 3 of these
incidences occurred. And they will have to "own" this problem along with the HUNDREDS of claims against
them for fatalities due to their own proprietary MEDS...Responsibility will go where it occurred ultimately and I
personally have no doubt that the stats here say that it was NOT OMONTYS that caused these 3 deaths out
of 25000 patients and close to 500,000 administrations of Omontys.


There is far more substance presented on YMB by Maxdad (me) and EXP and others which digs much
deeper into what happened along with a long trail of short posts by the author of this piece and others. Worth
reading all if you have any interest in Affymax or the story that is unfolding.

It sounds like someone is a recent graduate from the Ackman Institute of Intimidation for Shorting Stocks.


According to the FDA, a NDA does not depend on how well a medicine does compared to others in its class
of colony stimulating factors or in any other class of medications.


This is taken from FDA.gov. The goals of the NDA are to provide enough information to permit FDA reviewer
to reach the following key decisions: 
Whether the drug is safe and effective in its proposed use(s), and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh
the risks. 
Whether the drug's proposed labeling (package insert) is appropriate, and what it should contain. 
Whether the methods used in manufacturing the drug and the controls used to maintain the drug's quality are
adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity.


Just because a side effect shows up more does not make it less same. In the class of CSF, all of the
medications listed in Epocrates have similar side effects but some might be more pronounced in some
medications than others. Just like myalgias and rhabdomyolysis are more common with Crestor when

compared with Zocor. It does not mean Crestor is not safe and should be removed from the market. It just
means that it is stronger, therefore, side effects may be more common with it.


Also, Fresenius is currently in several legal battles over practices in some of their clinics and this gives the
speculation that there is some sort of human error by the clinics.


I have a small position in this stock to ride for speculation and possibly adding some later or riding it down if
bad news is in the future. I did my research on both sides of the argument and just did not pick one and run
with it to persuade others to follow a partially uneducated opinion on the stock.

Author’s reply »  Incorrect. The company didn't pay dollar for dollar. If they had, they could have gone
bankrupt. Instead, they struck agreements with counterparts such as Nektar that paid less than what was
owed so that the company could avoid bankruptcy. In return, these counterparts were given upside in the form
of milestones that they would receive in the event Omontys ever comes back to market - for instance "The
Nektar Settlement Agreement further provides that if the Company desires to terminate the Suspension
Period and reinstate its purchase right, the Company would be obligated to pay $5,000,000 no later than one
day after delivery of such notice to Nektar."

Bankruptcy laws can be quite complex. In fact, it does matter when creditors are paid and how they are paid.
There is a whole area of the law that specifically deals with preferential payments to creditors prior to the filing
of a bankruptcy petition. Your off-handed comment lacks merit.

Anyone seeking to invest in AFFY based on the story of O would be wise to understand why O is approved only for
CKD patients on dialysis and not approved for CKD patients generally. One does not expect a medicine to be unsafe
for healthier CKD patients and safe for sicker CKD patients on dialysis, but that is the story of O. It is found in the
EMERALD and PEARL studies. EMERALD proved O was just as effective and safe as Epogen/Aranesp for CKD
patients on dialysis. Paradoxically PEARL proved O was just as effective but 130% more unsafe for the healthier CKD
patients not on dialysis. Here are the PEARL statistics:


Sudden death - 2.1% O, 0.3% Epo [O 7x more] 
Death from unknown cause- 2.4% O, 1.2% Epo [O 2x more] 
Unstable angina - 2.4% O, 0.9% Epo [O 2.6x more] 
Arrythmia - 5.6% O, 4.0% Epo [O 1.4x more] 
Acute Renal Failure - 8.5% O, 4.3% Epo [O 2x more] 
Convulsions - 1.2% O, 0.3% [O 4x more] 
Treatment Failure - 3.5% O, 1.5% Epo [O 2.3x more]


In discussing O's poor safety profile PEARL results in the January 24, 2013 New England Journal of Medicine, the
authors concluded that "[the] increase in cardiovascular events and deaths with peginesatide [O] that was unexpected
and remains unexplained..."


Now that O has been "voluntarily" recalled, Takeda also may have to explain the unexplainable before O returns.


Thank you for your well written and well researched article.


28 Aug 2013, 02:05 PM


SeekTruth
Godwinpeak, your PEARL numbers are incorrect. Let's just look at sudden death - you quoted a rate of 2.1%
for Omontys and 0.3% for EPO, i.e., 7x more in Omontys.


However, from the official FDA Omontys Medical Review page 50, the Omontys rate of sudden death in the
PEARL studies was 4 per 656 patients (0.6%), versus 2 per 327 patients for EPO (0.6%) - identical rates.


28 Aug 2013, 03:53 PM


godwinpeak
I have not personally seen the info you cite.


I obtained my statistics from J. Gever, "Omontys Safety Still a Problem for Nondialyis Patients " MedPage
Today (Jan 23, 2013). Here is the relevant excerpt that discusses both O's efficacy and safety profiles from
PEARL:


"Peginesatide's efficacy, as measured by a primary endpoint of the difference in hemoglobin level between
baseline and the mean during weeks 24 to 36 on treatment, was confirmed in both PEARL studies, with little
difference among the two peginesatide dosages and darbepoetin.


Macdougall and colleagues reported that peginesatide at both doses met prespecified noninferiority criteria
relative to darbepoetin for efficacy in increasing hemoglobin levels.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1662162-affymax-likely-worthless-omontys-kills-at-least-9x-more-people-than-epogen 19/37


The strong trend toward increased cardiovascular events and mortality seen in pooled data with peginesatide
appeared to be driven primarily by four components of the composite safety endpoint:


Sudden death -- 2.1% peginesatide, 0.3% darbepoetin 
Death from unknown cause -- 2.4% peginesatide, 1.2% darbepoetin 
Unstable angina -- 2.4% peginesatide, 0.9% darbepoetin 
Arrythmia -- 5.6% peginesatide, 4.0% darbepoetin


For other components -- cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death, stroke, MI, and heart failure -- there
was no difference between treatment groups.


Other adverse events were also similar between groups, except that acute renal failure was nearly twice as
common with peginesatide (8.5% of patients versus 4.3% with darbepoetin). Also, convulsions were seen in
1.2% of the peginesatide groups compared with 0.3% of the darbepoetin patients.


Treatment failure, although rare, was more common with peginesatide -- anemia was reported as an adverse
event in 3.5% of the peginesatide groups versus 1.5% of those receiving darbepoetin."


I hope this helps.

I tend to believe anyone investing in AFFY really ought to think about the paradox between O's "safe" profile
in EMERALD studies for CKD on dialysis and "unsafe" profile in PEARL studies for CKD patients not on
dialysis. One should not expect this outcome, and there remains no explanation for it. One would expect the
two patient populations to be similar in patient safety outcomes. The FDA thought so too.


The FDA considered the divergent safety profile results. The FDA could not explain it. One questioned
whether that O ought to be approved at all because of it. In the FDA's Cross Leader Team Review [FDA Team
Review] for O, at p 9:


"A consult was obtained from the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products (DCRP) requesting the
Division to “evaluate and advise on the significance of the finding of adverse safety for Peginesatide [O] in the
not-on-dialysis population versus the on-dialysis.” The consult review by SS Pendse, M.D. (final signature
11/16/2011) indicated that there was no obvious biologically plausible mechanism for a differential risk for
adverse cardiovascular outcomes for the non-dialysis versus the dialysis population. The review also noted
that the 95% confidence intervals [for the adverse cardiovascular endpoints] overlap, suggesting that there
may be no difference between the two populations with regard to cardiovascular risk with peginesatide
relative to marketed ESA products. The review also cited CONCERNS REGARDING factors that might have
contributed to BIAS in the studies, SUCH AS THE LACK OF BLINDING AND RELATIVELY HIGH RATES OF
DISCONTINUATION. The review commented:


'Perhaps the most critical issue is that these trials characterized the risk of Peginesatide relative to marketed
ESAs. WHY, UNLESS THE OTHER AGENT OFFERS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER MARKETED
ESAs, WOULD ONE TOLERATE 1.3 TIMES GREATER RISK OF ADVERSE CV OUTCOMES ABOVE AND
BEYOND THAT OF MARKETED ESAs?...' "

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1662162-affymax-likely-worthless-omontys-kills-at-least-9x-more-people-than-epogen 20/37


In the end, the FDA decided to approve O only for CKD patients on dialysis. Some concern or doubt,
however, remained about the integrity of EMERALD. The FDA Team Review, p 9-11, reports:


"A meeting of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee was held on December 7, 2011 to discuss the NDA
for peginesatide for the indication for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in adult
patients on dialysis. Results for the studies in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis were
presented. The major concern from these trials is the uncertainty about the safety of peginesatide, as
reflected in an apparently worse outcome for cardiovascular safety in patients not on dialysis who received
peginesatide as compared toother ESA. Following the discussion, the following question was put to the
Committee:


'Ís there a favorable benefit to risk evaluation for peginesatide for use in patients with anemia associated with
chronic renal failure who are on dialysis?'


The Committee voted: 15 Yes; 1 NO; 1 Abstain.


Comments voiced during the presentation of the vote included CONCERN FOR THE NON-BLINDED
DESIGN OF THE TRIALS, CONCERN THAT THE DIALYSIS POPULATION STUDIED MAY HAVE BEEN
TOO NARROW TO DETECT A SAFETY SIGNAL and concern for potential mis-use of peginesatide in the
non-dialysis population."


Now that actual patient usage has called O's patient safety again into question before the FDA, it appears that
it will not be easy for Takeda to convince the FDA that O is safe without a compelling new clinical study to
support O's return to the market. The Takeda/AFFY voluntarty recall focused on allergic reactions. The author,
and his evidence, focuses on an unacceptably high overall death rate. It may be that O is just an usafe
medicine that the FDA will not soon allow to return to market.

I answered this question explicitly in Exp's prior SA article. AFFY paid the bank because it had a secured lien
in all of AFFY's assets, AFFY was in default, the bank threatened litigation to collect, and AFFY had the cash.


By paying off the other creditors and rendering AFFY a shell corporation, I believe that TBG was able to
extend time for AFFY in the hope Takeda would identify and rectify O's safety problem quickly. Should that not
happen soon enough and cash run out over time due to the cost of defending AFFY's litigation problems and
funding current operations, then TBG has everything in place for a "clean" bankruptcy proceeding. That is
why BK did not happen early on and why AFFY has consistently warned of BK.

Author, Your data are full of crap. Let's get down to your presented data from the same website which you mentioned:


For an example, in the drugcite.org web site, the death rate of Epogen is 0.85% vs. 0.02% of Omontys. It is totally
different from what is on your table in your article: 0.0027% death using Epogen vs. 0.02% of Omontys.


Please check it out yourself: http://bit.ly/16Rt8g6;s=


I don't even waste my time to point out more your fabricated data and illogical analyses.


It is shame for SA let you publish this article.

Author’s reply »  I believe that you have misread the data on the website that you linked to. This data you cite
is the % of adverse events that fall into each category. Accordingly, 0.85% of the reported adverse events for
Epogen were death. This is very different than saying that 0.85% of the patients who received Epogen as a
treatment died. I suggest that you carefully check your work and your sources before you tell someone that
their "data are full of crap." I stand by my conclusion that Epogen is much safer than Omontys.

John Gibson, Contributor
The bottom of that drugcite.org page says "percent (%) represents percentage of the adverse event to all
adverse events reported for the drug. Percent does not represent a rate related to drug utilization." I think AE
was using a percent of deaths related to drug utilization.

The website you linked to shows the frequency of a given adverse event (Death in this case) within the entire
population of adverse events. It's an irrelevant statistic. Much more important is the % of patients treated who
die. This is not given in your website but is given in my article. And in case you missed it, the % of patients
who experience death is much higher for Omontys than it is for Epogen.

SeekTruth
Let me state upfront that I used to own AFFY stock but no longer. However, I felt that I just have to write in to
comment as this article's title of "Omontys Kills At Least 9x More People Than Epogen" is extremely misleading.


I can understand the valid concern of deaths due to anaphylactoid reactions that must be resolved before Omontys
can be reintroduced. However, the article implies that even if the anaphylactoid reactions are resolved, the drug itself
remains inherently unsafe, and I take issue with that. The Phase 3 clinical trials in dialysis patients have shown
beyond statistical doubt that there were no adverse differences in safety between Omontys and ESAs. Using historic
data in an uncontrolled manner to come up with a supposition that Omontys can cause 9x more deaths is totally
unscientific, naive, and worst of all, misleading.


28 Aug 2013, 04:26 PM


SeekTruth
There is no way that "Omontys Kills At Least 9x More People Than Epogen" - if so, the drug would not have stood
any chance with FDA! Granted that the anaphylactoid issue resulting in death still needs to be addressed.


The Phase 3 dialysis data showed without a doubt that Omontys was not statistically worse than EPO in safety; in
fact, if anything, the adverse event profile was slightly better than EPO in dialysis patients.


One simply cannot use historic/anecdotal/pos... data to compare against scientifically-assessed randomized clinical
trial data - it is comparing apples to oranges. Is the researcher even aware that the EPO post-marketing adverse
event data is extremely confounded, where deaths are not usually reported as the adverse event term per se, and
therefore missed, and that causality assessments are not what he/she thinks? Is the researcher saying that there
were only 0.0027% deaths in CKD/ESRD patients, when in actuality, only 1 in 5 dialysis patients survive 5 years?
Who assigned causality in his assessments?


28 Aug 2013, 04:38 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Even the trial data shows that Omontys is not as safe as Epogen. But that's not what's
important. Outside of trials some drugs are found to be inherently unsafe - for instance Vioxx. It's perfectly
valid to look at safety data from a real world setting and use it to conclude that a drug is unsafe and should be
withdrawn from the market. This is what happened with Omontys. I don't think it ever comes back.

SeekTruth
I disagree with your assessment, Alpha Exposure, and am not sure where your data come from. Have you
ever been involved in performing clinical trials? If not, you might not know this.


You really need to compare like with like. Since Omontys was approved for dialysis patients only, looking at
the Omontys dialysis Phase 3 safety data, where Omontys was compared to EPO, Omontys fared better. In
fact, the FDA medical reviewer summarized the dialysis safety data as follows: "For most TESAEs (treatment-
emergent serious adverse events), the rates of occurrence were similar or numerically slightly lower in the
peginesatide (Omontys) treatment group."


You cannot compare apples with oranges. For example, you cannot compare EPO data from less sick CKD
patients against Omontys data from sicker dialysis patients. When you are talking about deaths, you cannot
compare adverse event terms of death against actually tabulations of deaths which include all causes of
death.

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  It is perfectly valid to look at the real-world performance of a drug for the purpose of
evaluating its safety. This is how drugs like Thalidomide, Omontys, and Vioxx get recalled. And yes, the FDA
was intimately involved here - see http://bit.ly/17nbpMz :"After a large number of patients received first doses
of Omontys in mid-February, an immediate investigation began, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) was contacted due to serious safety reports that were coming to their attention.


"Ultimately, in collaboration with the FDA and Takeda, we decided to recall the product nationwide."


28 Aug 2013, 08:44 PM


SeekTruth
Also, from your own supplied table, 60 of 260,000 gives you a rate of 0.023% rather than 0.0027% for the
EPO group, very comparable to the rate for the Omontys group (0.020%).


28 Aug 2013, 08:52 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The table is based on incidents per patient exposure and not on incidents per patient. Even
if you think that is the wrong way (i.e. the Baird analyst has done it incorrectly), the rate of hypersensitivity
and anaphylactic reaction is much higher in omontys on both a per patient and per patient exposure basis

I am also shocked at how wild the opinions are on both sides. I bought in immediately after the drug recall
and sold Monday after the very positive article on SA. After reading how the company basically shut down
with just enough cash to stay on the sidelines for awhile I couldn't justify the valuation of $70M for a company
with limited assets, no employees and questionable future revenue. I understand speculation but this is so
much more like MANIPULATION. Alpha has the right to post an article just as much as Ackman can
announce his position in Herbalife and why it is a ponsi scheme. My advice to Alpha is to not respond to
every contradicting post as no matter what you say, they have their own opinion and I don't think anything will
change it. I also find EXP's article pretty spot on to the upside until you factor in the rapid jump in valuation
compared to the long term time frame of a possible re-introduction of O. It was a good ride.

I'm sorry...Now why would you ever cover a stock that you believe is worthless at 50 cents? Mathematically
that's infinitely higher than ZERO which is what you whole article said it was worth. And frankly even the most
strident longs believe that it will be worth a great deal more if Omontys is returned and zero if it is not...We
just happen to believe that the probabilities of return of Omontys are fairly high given that there has only been
one drug in the past fifty (50) years out the 53 drugs that have been permanently withdrawn that had mortality
stats even close to Omontys...And it was a antibiotic in a class of antibiotics that had over a half dozen
perfectly fine alternatives, FDA said no reason to bring it back on the market...CONVERSELY, Amgen's
EPOGEN and Procrit are a complete monopoly with Medicare, Medicaid and Insurance Carriers quite anxious
to lower the expense of ESA's (as are the Dialysis clinics). In other words THESE "INTERESTED PARTIES"
WANT OMONTYS TO COMPETE...Lower Adverse Affect levels, 1/per month versus every dialysis session
and much lower overall cost (NOT including the added labor of frequent EPO/Procrit administration...


AND NEVER any problems with Omontys AFTER FIRST ADMINISTRATION of the Rx!!!


29 Aug 2013, 01:51 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The target price is 44-cents based on probability weighted outcomes. There would be little
reason to stay short at 50-cents unless the odds got worse for Omontys.


As regards the dominance of Epogen and Procrit, that is a reason dialysis centers would like to have an
alternative - to lower prices - but it is not a reason to bring a fundamentally unsafe drug such as Omontys
back to market.


You miss the point regarding safety. There is no reason for the FDA to allow Omontys to be sold when it has
not shown any efficacy benefits vs Epogen but has now shown a materially worse safety profile.

Thanks for another buying opportunity! You stupid desperate jerk. I cannot wait for Takeda to black label and bring

in the reason 8-k, pains were taken to respond to investor concerns and state specifically that Brenner had NOT been
brought in for luidation, but for stabilization while Takeda investigated a bit further.


It is common knowledge that AFFy has been set up as a shell company and debts, leases, etc, paid off so that AFFY
can wait until the situation is resolved.


It is highly unlikely you talked to anyone from Takeda of any substance, or you would have a specific name of the
person.


Omontys safety record was established in thorough clinical trials or the FDA would not have approved. Thus far,
nothing has come to light other than the potentil for anphylaxis in a small number of people, and only if the drug is
used by IV. 3 deaths occurred out of 25k uses of the drug, not 10k - your faulty data on a widely known statistic
makes your argument less credible.


If proper testing is done before adminstering the IV, individuals who might react can be given subcutaneous treatment
nstead.


Anaphylaxis is easily treated IF treated promptly. As far as anyone in the public domain knows, the 3 deaths were
from anaphylaxis and noy from any other issue of the drug.


I could go on - I think there is enough information here to rebut the thesis of your article, and anyone who fact checks
you and I will know for certain who is making the argument based on sound available facts.

Most assume that O's "recall" problems are limited to patient anaphylaxis reactions only. They are mistaken.
CV related deaths also occurred in patients given O, and it appears that these CV deaths are also being
investigated as part of the recall.


The combination of anaphylaxis deaths and CV deaths is why overall O patient deaths statistics are
especially relevant. O's CV problems were the unexplained surprise of the PEARL studies and the reason
why O was not approved for CKD patients not on dialysis. See my earlier comments.


As AFFY CEO John Orwin explained in his conference call when O was recalled:


Three cases of serious anaphylactic reactions associated with fatal outcomes were reported in February.
TWO DEATHS reported prior to February WERE DEEMED TO BE CARDIOVASCULAR IN NATURE. In these
2 cases, patients' symptoms were not consistent with hypersensitivity reactions, and in consultation with
outside experts, these events at the time were not considered likely to be a result of drug-related
hypersensitivity. These cases were reported to the Food and Drug Administration in accordance with
regulations.


To date, and to be conservative, WE ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF THESE CASES IN OUR EVALUATION
AND RECALL DECISION....


The companies are actively investigating these cases to determine a root cause of these events. If we can
identify and address the underlying cause, the FDA has said they would work with us on appropriate next
steps for the product.

away the 2 that were fairly immediately dismissed and the Omontys Adverse Reaction ratio now is
substantially better than Epo/Procrit...But that was also established in the head to head comparison that the
FDA (public domain) did between EPO and Omontys for both Efficacy (a virtual tie, other than Omontys cost
and convenience advantage) and SAFETY ,which by your very own numbers FAVORS OMONTYS....You
really ought to double check your numbers before you go quite so far out on a limb drawing such radical
conclusions from erroneous numbers!!!

Author’s reply »  I cut and pasted from the Baird research report, which was calculated on a per patient
exposure basis. If you think it's more appropriate to calculate safety on a per patient basis (and I don't think
this is the correct way to do it), then Omontys produces about the same number of deaths and significantly
more analphylactic reactions and hypersensitivity. You really should read the article more carefully before you
go around criticizing the author in all caps.

I think it would be easier to go over what is the truth. One of the rarest find in medical science and O works.
Adverse reaction are treatable. Very poor article.

Author’s reply »  The truth is the Omontys has a much worse safety profile than Epogen and will probably
never come back to market.

Another piece of selective information taken out of context that has been put in this article includes commentary
copied directly from The Brenner Groups website, specifically their services for distressed companies on their
homepage as the last statement of the conclusion.


The whole paragraph from which the author extracted the position that the Brenner Group is there to wind down
Affymax reads:


The Brenner Group is a premier advisor to financially distressed companies that need restructuring assistance. Our
professionals are expert in guiding companies through bankruptcies, liquidations, and wind downs. We are also a
preferred resource for conducting asset sales of IP or technology assets as part of the restructure process.


Restructuring takes many forms and while many end up in a shuttered shop, the process is long and hard to do so if
necessary. This is a promotional statement indicating that they have the experience on board to do so if it happens.
They are not corporate raiders breaking up a company for more funds. They are specialists, consulting on the work
that needs to be done when distress hits a company and from what I have seen they have taken the prudent steps to
mitigate expenses to allow Affymax to survive until the investigation is over, one way or the other. This does not imply
that they will be doing this, but that they are in place if necessary based on the factual outcome of the investigation.

Author’s reply »  The Brenner group basically specializes in liquidating companies. The resignation of all of
the board members and management is a negative sign IMO. If the future for Omontys was really bright, I
think they would have stuck around. Regardless, the safety data is clear. I don't think Omontys is ever coming
back.

Bain Capital does the same thing when they buy distressed companies, take them private, reorganize and
then IPO them. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Just so happens this is public company. And why
bother with the expense when they could have just shut the doors and file immediately? Let the courts figure
it out?

The best answer to your astute statement is to call Wes Rose who is The Brenner Group's Acting Affymax
President. He is not particularly forthcoming but WILL answer your questions to the best of his ability and
within legal constraints.


He did tell me directly "We were NOT brought in to bankrupt Affymax. We were brought in to stabilize the
company and await the result of Takeda's investigation...And Bankruptcy work is not our mainstay. We are
primarily a turnaround consulting company"


But I strongly urge any of you with any doubts on either side to call Mr. Rose at The Brenner Group directly.
He is accessible even if not immediately so.

I have called Takeda and no one is willing to confirm the the IR paraphrase in this article that Omontys is unlikely to
return to the market. this is not Takeda's official position and no customer rep is authorized to express such a view,
nor could they know upper management's thinking.


29 Aug 2013, 03:03 AM


mfm401kvp
I wonder if Takeda would go on the record and state that they have not given any such statement? Maybe a
quick letter to Seeking Alpha indicating that they are willing to seek damages for the alleged quote?


29 Aug 2013, 07:14 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Rather than asking them to confirm a quote, a better way is to ask them direct questions
such as:


* Do you know what went wrong with Omontys? 
* How important is Omontys to the future growth of Takeda? 
* What steps would likely be necessary to bring Omontys back onto the market? 
etc.


If you were really smart, you'd read up on Takeda and spend the first 20-30 minutes of your conversation with
IR talking about things that really matter to Takeda before talking about Omontys. If all you do is ask them to
verify a quote, you'll probably just get some canned answer. My quotation was a direct quote from a Takeda
IR representative I spoke with this month.

I can answer those questions without calling them, ready?


1.) We are currently investigating the issue and will release information through the appropriate channels as
required by law.


2.) We have no comment as we are currently assessing the future of the drug and therefore we have no
comment or expectation of future revenues given its current status.


3.) The completion of the investigation will dictate the next steps we take in accordance with standard FDA
protocols and discussion with them for a potential return to market.

I still don't get it...


Figure 2. 
DEATH:


EPOGEN: 60 death out of 260,000= 0.0027% ??? 
OMONTYS: 5 death out of 25,000= 0.024% ????


60/260,000 =0.00023 
5/25,000 =0.0002


OMONYS has less DEATH than EPOGEN IMO


29 Aug 2013, 03:31 AM

Author’s reply »  It's per patient exposure - not per patient. Omontys didn't have a full year of adverse events
so you need to adjust the numbers to a per exposure basis.

First, must be nice to open a position, write an article, and pocket 15% in a day. What's that like?


Next: Author - "I will cover around 50-cents or so. Maybe lower or higher depending on what new information comes
out in the meantime." Why would you plan to cover at 50 without new info, when your article says 44 is your target but
likely worthless (so 0.00)?...


Finally. What kind of author doesn't ASK to cite his source?? Author states he didn't even ask permission... Any
author worth his salt tries to back an article up with as many facts as possible. What's the worst the "source" could
have responded? No?


PS: LOL at your implication that John Orwin was "selling off" his stock. That was an AUTOMATIC sale, and the size
isn't even worth mentioning. One of MANY giveaways in this article exposing your agenda and lack of credibility.
Thank you for lowering the pps temporarily. 10,000 share order filled just before close!

Author’s reply »  In my experience, it's best to trade at target prices not at median values. While I think $0 is
the most likely outcome, there is a low-probability outcome that gets to around $4.40 per share. Hence the
expected value is $0.44 so a reasonable cover price is $0.50 per share.


We will never know what management has done with their stock since they left the company but the only clue
we have in the meantime was the sale by the CEO. While it is true that it was an automatic sale, there is well

canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person

This article is a FRAUD. The title says 9X More people die from Omontys than Epogen. The ~9X ratio is gotten by
ANNUALIZING Omontys ratio of 5/25,000, a bit of statistical shuffling to paint Omontys in a bad light.  
Regardless, when the Baird analyst wrote the article, the deaths were 5. Since then the 5 deaths potentially attributed
to Omontys were reduced to 3, which changes the ratio to approximately 5. The author knows this but did not correct
the 9x to a 5x.  
If you use normal ratios, Epogen is more unsafe than Omontys but you now AlphaExposure won't print that! 
Also the author prints an unsubstantiated or referenced conversation he had with somebody from IR at Takeda to
make it sound like Takeda wants the drug pulled. Such wild, unsubstantiated accusations are shoddy writing, just an
example of how much Alpha will try to get away with.

Christopher Raymond's analysis is flawed. He used adverse events listed as "death", "hypersensitivity" and
"anaphylactic reaction" with events of 60, 50 and 10 respectively. These numbers are correct but the FDA uses
medDRA preferred terms to report adverse events in order to standardize them. Omontys DID NOT list any adverse
events as "death" in their 150 FAERS reports although they did list one event as "sudden death". "Death" and
"sudden death" would both be classified under the adverse event category of "fatal outcomes". Epogen had 66
adverse events which would be under the "fatal outcome" category from 2004 to 2012. Using the "estimated patients
per year" as above (which I have a problem with because it tells you nothing about the primary event rate) and the
"fatal outcomes" category would give a rate of 0.00298% (66/2.21M) for Epogen and 0.004% (4/25K) for Omontys.


Procrit (Jaansen branded Epogen) had 318 adverse events listed as "death" and 319 adverse events categorized as
"fatal outcomes" from 2004 to 2012. I can't find any data regarding the number of patients who were on Procrit.


Reviewing the 150 Omontys FAERS reports, there were 20 events listed as "hypersensitivity" (0.08%), 8 as
"anaphylactic reaction" (0.032%), 4 as "drug hypersensitivity" (0.016%) and 1 as "anaphylactic shock" (0.004%). I will
add that Epogen also had 14 events listed as "drug hypersensitivity" (0.00063%). Omontys had one outcome as
DE/death from "hypersensitivity" and one from "anaphylactic shock". The "hypersensitivity" case also listed "ST
segment abnormal" suggesting a cardiovascular event.


These FAERS reports are useful in spotting trends, but each serious case needs to be investigated on an individual
basis. Correlation does not imply causation.

That should read 0.004% (1/25K) for Omontys.
