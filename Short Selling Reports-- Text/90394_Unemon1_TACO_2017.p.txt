Author's Reply Today an Editor forwarded me the Following message from a spokesperson
named STEVEN BOEDIARTO. I assume he is a spokesperson for DEL TACO:


----------------------... 
"The errors that need correcting are as follow (these are all within the author’s 23-page
research note): 
· Their table on page 8 for 2016 the $19.2M should be $10.1M per our cash flow used in
investing discussion in MD&A 
On his analysis of cost to open new unit: They accidentally included the $9.1M which is for
“owned land and building acquired for existing company restaurants” – clearly not for new
units


If they included the $10.1 their implied average would be $1,015k which is very close to our
$950k, this delta is easily explained by the fact that you start incurring capital in 2016 for
units that will open in 2017 (ie, architecture fees, permit fees, etc.). " 
----------------------...


MY response:


1. The company seems not to dispute that the Cost for Opening an "average" new store in
2015 was $1.682m (approximately 86% higher than the Net Investment Cost of $0.9m the
Company disclosed in his Investors Presentation of May 2015 - page 23)  
Link To Presentation: http://bit.ly/2oDrKhN


2. The $19.2m refers to the FY2016. If I take out the $10.1m as suggested by the
spokesperson the Average Cost per Unit is still $1.138m, Which is still 20% higher than the
Cost of 950k Disclosed by the Company to Investors.  
Does this imply that the cost to open a new location in 2016 decreased by 32.34%? This is
highly unlikely.


This is why to make things Easier and more transparent, in the article I even added that:  
"In any event, even if we were to assume ZERO investment in land in 2016 (which would
clearly understate the actual cost of opening a store), the average cost to open a new TACO
store location is still around $1.41 million across 2015-2016."


So on Average (not including investment in land) Average Cost to open 14 new Locations

So, on Average (not including investment in land) Average Cost to open 14 new Locations
over the period 2015-2016 was $1.41m per location


This number is 52% higher than the Net Investment Cost presented to investors in the 2015
(900k) and 2016 (950K) Presentations.


Please note that the $1.41m net investment to set up a new location is also the Mid-point of
the range disclosed to potential Franchisee ($960.7k to $1,866.5k = 1,413.6k).


While the Net Investment necessary to set up a location disclosed in INVESTORS
Presentations is of 950k (2016) and 900k (2015).

on my latest trip to Las Vegas new unit located on Stephanie on Friday during dinner hour
full parking lot and inside lines to counter. Feature was big shrimp Taco/burrito's.
furthermore as Chipotle rebounds TACO will ride wave. Facts are facts last short article
quoted a disgruntled customer about quality of food being terrible over a year ago. Back
then I purchased several food items which we're high quality and in my opinion fresh food
was better and a larger menu then Chipotle. Results are TACO has growing sales and a cult
like following. Disseminating false and misleading information seems to be trend of shorts.
look at earnings and growth they do not correspond with malicious gossip. I am surprised
without hard facts investors are gullible to believe naysayers.
