UK Companies House filings revealed that Pets at Home Group Plc (LSE: PETS) (“PETS”) lied about GBP 34 
million of undisclosed trading loans hidden from its balance sheet used to support circular payments from PETS 
Vet Group Joint Ventures (“PETS JVs”) which suggested that PETS artificially inflated its reported profits.  


 
Including undisclosed trading balances, PETS’ actual funding, trading and operating (“FTO”) loan balances 


owed by PETS JVs were GBP 74 million and GBP 64 million as of FYE’18 and FYE’19, 87% and 51% greater 
than what PETS reported in its FY’19 Annual Report. Without these loans, PETS JVs would not have been able 
to pay PETS service fees and rents. 


 
The circular payment scheme had a significant impact on PETS’ purported profitability. PETS recognized 50%+ 
operating margins on PETS JV service fees versus 8% for its retail segment. While accounting for only 6% of 


PETS revenues, PETS JV service fees accounted for 31% of PETS’ operating profits.  
 


We reviewed over 1,800 annual reports for 432 individual PETS JVs between FY’15 and FY’19 available for 
free online via UK Companies House filings.  Most PETS JVs were loss-making and drowning in liabilities.  In 
FY’18, while PETS generated GBP 27 million operating profits from PETS JV service fees, PETS JVs generated 


aggregate losses of GBP 14 million. PETS JVs revealed aggregate liabilities of GBP 170 million as of FYE’19.   
 
Recently PETS actively restructured some PETS JVs via step-up acquisitions and in each instance PETS 


assumed all PETS JV liabilities. PETS’ restructuring efforts have already cost GBP 40+ million in write-offs 
and expenses from 55 PETS JV step-up acquisitions as of FYE’19.  As PETS JVs sink deeper into debt, we 
anticipate that PETS will be forced to bail out and write off additional PETS JVs. 


 
Below are additional highlights from our review of operating PETS JV annual reports:  


 
➢ 253 (61%) generated aggregate losses of GBP 27 million in FY’18.  
➢ 108 (26%) had adminstrative expenses that exceeded revenues in FY’18. 
➢ 283 (69%) were balance sheet insolvent with aggregate net liabilities of GBP 100 million as of FYE’19. 
➢ 60 (15%) had net liabilities that exceeded GBP 500,000 as of FYE’19 (not including 19 additional PETS 


JVs that were bought back and written off by PETS in FY’19).

PETS charged PETS JVs service fees and rents only afforded with concurrent financial support.  If PETS cannot 
continue to provide such a significant level of financial support to PETS JVs, the scheme collapses.   
 


 
Source: Bonitas graphic 





PETS’ FYE’19 balance sheet held GBP 395 million goodwill largely attributable to the future cash flow 
generating ability of PETS JVs and reported a contingent liability of GBP 11 million, only 17% of what PETS 
JVs owed third party banks.   


 
To us, the evidence is clear that PETS lied to investors about the level of financial support given to PETS JVs 


which artificially inflated PETS’ reported profitability and understated its liabilities.  We believe a restatement 
of PETS’ financial performance would include adjustments to goodwill, increased recognized exposure to PETS 
JV bank debt and further write-offs of direct loans to PETS JVs.  


 
As investors consider PETS’ hidden liabilities, its low earnings quality from circular payments and 


inflated carrying balances for certain assets, we think PETS’ stock price could break previous lows with 


a downside of 75%+.

GBP 34 MILLION UNDISCLOSED TRADING LOANS 





PETS provided PETS JVs with operational services as franchisor, procurer, landlord, marketer, finance provider, IT 


supplier, etc. PETS recorded unpaid services provided to PETS JVs as outstanding trading balances.  





PETS primarily held its PETS JV interests through Companion Care (Services) Limited (“Companion Care”).1  Under 


related party disclosures, both PETS and Companion Care disclosed the same definition for “trading balances” as 


“costs incurred / income received by the Company (Group) in relation to the services provided to the veterinary 


practices that have yet to be recharged”.  


 
Source: Companion Care FY’19 Annual Report – p. 54; PETS FY’19 Annual Report – p. 175 





PETS disclosed less than GBP 2 million in trading balances as of FYE’17 and zero trading balances for both FYE’18 


and FYE’19.2  This is a lie. 





Companion Care’s FY’19 Annual Report revealed GBP 22 million and GBP 34 million in trading balances due from 


PETS JVs as of FYE’19 and FYE’18, respectively.3

We do not believe that potential offsetting trading balances existed elsewhere for multiple reasons. 





First, UK Companies House filings for PETS JVs did not disclose any evidence of offsetting loans. If there were GBP 


34 million of offsetting trading balances owed from PETS to PETS JVs for the provision of any services, we would 


expect to see disclosure of significant assets on PETS JV balance sheets and mentioned in FY’18 filings. We did not 


find any such disclosure.  





Second, PETS provided services to PETS JVs, not vice versa. Trading balances were generated when PETS did not 


receive payments from PETS JVs for services provided by PETS.  





Third, both Companion Care and PETS disclosed trading balances owed and due as separate line items within related 


party disclosures. Specifically, Companion Care separately disclosed GBP 22 million in trading balances owed by 


PETS JVs to Companion Care and GBP 136,000 in trading balances owed from Companion Care to PETS JVs. This 


figure was reported separately within creditors on Companion Care’s balance sheet and not netted against the GBP 22 


million of debtor balance.

PETS included a separate line item as part of its related party disclosure that GBP 4 million was owed by PETS to

31% OF PETS PROFITS GENERATED FROM PETS JV SERVICE FEES  





PETS lied about the amount of financial support it gave to PETS JVs since FY’18. Without these loans, PETS JVs 


would not have been able to support GBP 56 million (31%) of PETS’ purported profits in FY’18 and FY’19. 





For the first time, PETS’ FY’19 Annual Report disclosed underlying operating profits for its Vet Group business 


segment of GBP 30 million and GBP 32 million in FY’18 and FY’19, respectively. 





 
Source: PETS FY’19 Annual Report – p. 137 





As of FYE’19, PETS’ Vet Group business segment was comprised of 409 operating PETS JVs, 4 specialist referral 


centers (“Specialist Vets”) and 50 company managed veterinary practices (“Managed Vets”). UK Companies House 


filings available for Specialist Vets and Managed Vets allowed us to estimate how much operating profits PETS 


generated from PETS JV service fees.  





UK Companies House filings for PETS’ 4 Specialist Vets revealed aggregate operating profits of GBP 2.6 million in 


FY’19. UK Companies House filings were available for 37 of 50 PETS’ Managed Vets which revealed aggregate 


operating losses of GBP 4.3 million in FY’19.  Most Managed Vets were absorbed in 2H’19 so, due to lack of timing 


disclosure, we cannot calculate the exact operating loss contributions from Managed Vets in FY’19 and conservatively 


assume zero operating profit contribution.  





By subtracting Specialist Vets’ operating profits from PETS’ disclosed Vet Group operating profits, we estimate that 


PETS JV service fees accounted for 30% and 32% of PETS’ total underlying operating profits in FY’18 and 


FY’19, respectively.

There is a significant difference in operating profit margins between PETS’ retail business and PETS JV business 


segment. PETS’ retail revenues accounted for 89% of total revenues and generated an 8% operating margin. In

In addition to service fees of GBP 53 million and GBP 55 million, PETS JVs paid GBP 12 million and GBP 13 million

REVIEW OF 432 INDIVIDUAL PETS JVs’ FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 





We reviewed over 1,800 annual reports for 432 individual PETS JVs between FY’15 and FY’19 available for free 


online via UK Companies House filings.4   
 


 
Source: UK Companies House Filings 





While PETS generated GBP 27 million operating profits from PETS JV service fees, FY’18 annual reports for 417 


(100%) operating PETS JVs revealed aggregate losses of GBP 14 million in FY’18.   





FY’19 annual reports for 409 (100%) operating PETS JVs revealed aggregate liabilities of GBP 170 million, of which 


PETS was owed GBP 83 million and third party banks were owed GBP 65 million as of FYE’19. 





Below are additional highlights from our review of annual reports for operating PETS JVs:  





➢ 253 (61%) generated aggregate losses of GBP 27 million in FY’18.  
➢ 108 (26%) had adminstrative expenses that exceeded revenues in FY’18. 
➢ 283 (69%) were balance sheet insolvent with aggregate net liabilities of GBP 100 million as of FYE’19. 
➢ 60 (15%) had net liabilities which exceeded GBP 500,000 as of FYE’19 (not including 19 additional PETS JVs 


that were bought back and wrote off by PETS in FY’19).  
 


Filings revealed declining operating profits from insufficient revenues to cover operating expenses including service 


fees and rents charged by PETS.

*Note: FY’19 not disclosed 





PETS generated 50%+ operating profit margins from rendered services to PETS JVs while most PETS JVs generated 


losses and carried net liabilities as of FYE’19. 





To us, it appears that without PETS’ undisclosed working capital loans to PETS JVs, PETS JVs cannot survive 


operationally and the scheme collapses.

b. 69% INSOLVENT WITH AGGREGATE NET LIABILITIES OF GBP 100 MILLION AS OF FYE’19 
 


Annual reports for 409 (100%) operating PETS JVs revealed 69% were balance sheet insolvent with aggregate net

Filings revealed 60 PETS JVs had greater than GBP 500,000 net liabilities as of FYE’19, up from 17 and 42 as of 


FYE’17 and FYE’18, respectively. This does not include an additional 19 failing PETS JVs with individual net 


liabilities that exceeded GBP 500,000 that PETS bought back and wrote off in FY’19.

c. GBP 18 MILLION WRITE-OFF IS TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR PETS 
 


PETS JV liabilities are a major concern for PETS. PETS wrote off GBP 18 million in aggregate net liabilities from 


27 of its 32 step-up acquisitions of PETS JVs in FY’19.  In total, PETS’ FY’19 restructuring efforts had already cost 


GBP 40+ million in write-offs and expenses from 55 planned PETS JV step-up acquisitions.  





Historically PETS fully assumed all liabilities and impaired all assets of acquired failing PETS JVs. As PETS JVs 


sink deeper into debt, we believe PETS will be forced to bail out and write-off additional PETS JVs. 





The chart below highlights how aggregate net liabilities of failing PETS JVs far outweigh the aggregate net assets of 


successful PETS JVs. Including write-offs of 27 PETS JVs acquired in FY’19, aggregate net liabilities of net liability 


PETS JVs grew by 71% to GBP 117 million as of FYE’19, deteriorating from GBP 68 million as of FYE’17.  





 
Source: UK Companies House Filings 





While PETS claimed that its restructuring efforts worked, to us PETS is in an exceedingly difficult position and we 


expect additional step-up acquisitions and write-offs as liabilities for individual failing PETS JVs become due.

d. INDIVIDUAL PETS JVs RECEIVE GBP 1+ MILLION LOANS FROM PETS  
 


While PETS claimed only a small amount of financial support was extended to PETS JVs, UK Companies House 


filings revealed that PETS loaned certain individual PETS JVs over GBP 1.1 million to support circular payments to 


PETS.

4. Support loans – PETS provided ongoing FTO loans 
5. Other PETS loans – for some practices PETS replaces bank loans with its own loans 





PETS claimed that third party banks would be the predominant source of funding for PETS JVs, not PETS.  UK 


Companies House filings revealed this was untrue since FY’18 when PETS loans exceeded bank loans to PETS JVs. 





PETS claimed to investors that its modus operandi was to extend between GBP 30,000 - 60,000 to support PETS JV 


initial start-up costs, and that ongoing financial support would come mostly from third party bank loans up to GBP 


450,000 backed by personal guarantees from PETS JVPs.

PETS’ Vet Group Business Summary emphasized that PETS did not expect further funding to be required beyond a 


potential second loan of GBP 30,000 after 12 months. This is simply not true.

PETS disclosed that Lloyds and HSBC provided GBP 62 million in aggregate financing to PETS JVs.5  UK Companies 


House filings for individual PETS JVs annual reports corroborated that PETS JV third-party bank loans outstanding 


was GBP 65 million as of FYE’19. 





Meanwhile, gross loans from PETS to PETS JVs, including undisclosed trading balances, increased from GBP 27 


million in FY’15 to GBP 83 million in FY’19, secretly making PETS the largest lender to PETS JVs.

UK Companies House filings revealed PETS JVs had aggregate liabilities of GBP 170 million as of FYE’19.  PETS 


historically assumed all liabilities each time it acquired a PETS JV, taking a GBP 18 million write-off in FY’19.  As 


further bail-outs of PETS JVs are required, PETS is effectively exposed to GBP 170 million in total PETS JV 


liabilities.

We believe the existence of such large existing liabilities were a significant factor in deciding to step-up and acquire 


55 PETS JVs.  While PETS claimed that its exposure to PETS JVs third-party bank debts was limited, in practice 


PETS settled all bank debts for acquired failing PETS JVs, suggesting PETS could incur substantial write-offs and 


impairments. 





PETS incurred GBP 40 million “non-underlying” expenses from its 55 PETS JV step-up acqusitions in FY’19 & 


FY’20, an average of GBP 734,000 per acquired PETS JV. 





 
Source: PETS FY’19 Annual Report – p. 138 





These substantial losses were classified as non-underlying impairments of receivables, yet triggered no adjustments 


to carrying value of goodwill. As of FYE’19, PETS disclosed GBP 395 million goodwill largely attributable to the 


future cash flow generating abilities of PETS JVs, which we believe face material impairments.

We believe the facts are clear.  





➢ PETS lied to investors about the amount of financial support given to PETS JVs. Without these loans, PETS 
JVs would not have been able to pay PETS for service fees and rents. 





➢ PETS lied to investors about third party banks being PETS JVs’ largest creditors.  
 


➢ PETS lied about the success of PETS JVs. 
 


PETS told investors that its Vet Group business was successful and exceeded expectations. PETS’ FY’19 Annual 


Report claimed that PETS JVs had performed well, and that only a “small number of practices” required ongoing 


financial support.6  In an October 2019 Vet Group investor presentation, CEO Peter Pritchard described PETS JVs as 


the “single biggest value creation opportunity” of the Company.7   





The story to investors was that PETS’ recalibration efforts had been a success despite its GBP 40 million expenses 


recorded for 55 PETS JV buybacks.  





 
Source: PETS Vet Group Business Summary October 2019 – p. 10 





PETS FY’20 Interim Results PPT forecasted up to GBP 60 million in annual cash flows generated for PETS from 


PETS JV business upon maturity. Late 2018 news of a completed restructuring and 1H’19 reported strength in its 


financial performance eased prior investor concerns and attracted interest in its equity, sending the stock up 150%+ 


since January 2019 despite the COVID-19 global market selloff.

Evidence revealed that PETS lied about GBP 34 million of trading loans hidden from its balance sheet used to 


support circular payments from PETS JVs that artificially inflated PETS’ reported profitability.  





Including undisclosed trading balances, PETS actual FTO loan balance owed by PETS JVs were GBP 74 million and 


GBP 64 million as of FYE’18 and FYE’19, 87% and 51% greater than what PETS reported in its FY’19 Annual 


Report. Without these loans, PETS JVs would not have been able to pay PETS for service fees and rents. 





The circular payment scheme had a significant impact on PETS’ purported profitability. PETS recognized 50%+ 


operating margins on PETS JV service fees versus 8% operating margins for PETS’ retail segment. While PETS JVs 


accounted for only 6% of PETS revenues, service fees from PETS JVs accounted for 31% of PETS cumulative profits 


in FY’18 and FY’19.  





PETS charged PETS JVs service fees and rents only made possible through concurrent financial support to insolvent 


related parties. While PETS generated GBP 27 million operating profits from PETS JV service fees, FY’18 annual 


reports for 417 (100%) operating PETS JVs revealed aggregate losses of GBP 14 million in FY’18.  





Annual reports for 409 (100%) operating PETS JVs revealed aggregate liabilities of GBP 170 million, of which third 


party banks were owed GBP 65 million as of FYE’19. 





PETS’ restructuring efforts have already cost GBP 40+ million in write-offs and expenses from 55 PETS JV step-up 


acquisitions.  We suspect that PETS will be forced to bail out and write-off additional PETS JVs that continue to pile 


on debt.  





To us, the evidence is clear that PETS lied to investors about the level of financial support given to PETS JVs which 


artificially inflated PETS’ reported revenues and profitability. We believe a restatement of PETS’ financial 


performance would include adjustments to goodwill, increased recognized exposure to PETS JVs’ bank debt and 


further write-offs of direct loans to PETS JVs.  





We think that PETS’ FYE’19 Balance Sheet could be overstated by up to GBP 565 million: 





➢ Impair GBP 395 million of goodwill relating to the Vet Group. 
➢ Include exposure to GBP 170 million PETS JV liabilities.  
 


As investors consider PETS’ hidden liabilities, its low earnings quality from circular payments and carrying 


balances for certain assets, we think PETS’ stock price could break previous lows with a downside of 75%+.
