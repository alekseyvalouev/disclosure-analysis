Chronically Criminal: Shielding The Public From Medical Marijuana

Note: This article has been updated at the author's request.


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in an effort to identify bubbles
before they implode and our track record of success speaks for itself. In this report, we will
be exposing fraud heaped on top of folly.


Infitialis Track Record of Exposing Fraud and Folly is Unmatched


Introduction


Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTCPK:MJNA) ("Medical Marijuana" or the "Company") is a
penny stock company run by criminals and alleged fraudsters. While medical marijuana
may be a growing business opportunity in selected states, there is no place for blatant
stock fraud in the United States capital markets, and we strongly believe the intrinsic value
of MJNA is $0.00/share due to the significant malfeasance discussed below.


In this report, we will discuss how MJNA listed on the OTC Markets (formerly known as
the pink sheets) under a weird, but quasi-legal, exemption known as "Unsolicited
Quotation" whereby shares only trade by appointment of retail order flow. In other words,
there is no active market for the issuer's securities and on a whim all bids/offers can
instantaneously vanish, leading to choppy trading and large valuation swings. Despite our
extensive market experience, this is the first time we have ever run into this type of
security with a >$100mm market valuation, let alone a $355mm market valuation.
Moreover, based on our discussions with securities counsel, the SEC has all but done
away with these types of companies save for a select few like Medical Marijuana that have
somehow so far escaped the eyes of the regulators.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 2/97


Adding insult to injury, because MJNA is a non-SEC reporting issuer, it has almost no real
obligations to its shareholders. Here are a few examples of what MJNA can get away with
that 99.9% of public companies cannot:


1. MJNA does not have to file financial statements with the SEC or make available
any material disclosures to its shareholders.


2. MJNA does not have to file quarterly or annual disclosure reports with the SEC
according to the laws and regulations of the 1934 Securities Act


3. Officers and Directors of MJNA have no obligation to shareholders to operate
within Sarbanes-Oxley or any other financial controls promulgated by the
Commission following the various accounting scandals that erupted in the wake
of the Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco situations following the dot-com crash.


MJNA Appears to be a Significant Stock Scam And Not a Legitimate Enterprise


MJNA has recently been able to obtain the shocking market valuation of $355.6mm
making it more valuable than well-known consumer brands of Pacific Sunwear of
California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PSUN) and Jamba, Inc. (NASDAQ:JMBA) COMBINED. These
two well-known brands on a consolidated basis have >7,600 employees, >1,500 physical
retail locations around the world, and generate >$1bn in annual revenue. Conversely,
Medical Marijuana, Inc. is controlled by and operated by a 28 year old fraudster. In this
report, we will outline several more red flags relating to MJNA and its management team
with the goal of demonstrating that MJNA has no intrinsic value. Ultimately it is our opinion
that the hard facts we will uncover cast serious doubt as to the accuracy or legitimacy of
this company as a going concern. Bluntly, we strongly believe based on the data
uncovered to date that Medical Marijuana, Inc. is "cooking the books."


We have gone over this many times when we release our expos√©s. Legitimate companies
do not go public via OTC RTOs unless they have no other viable route to capital.
Moreover, in our view legitimate companies don't choose an unsolicited pink sheet as their
platform to market unless they are illegitimate. There is no advantage to such a vehicle
unless one is purposely trying to circumvent the United States securities regulations
explicitly designed to protect investors.


MJNA Fundamentals and Valuation

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 3/97


As discussed in further detail, these valuation metrics are completely preposterous and
should be yet another red-flag for investors. The issue with MJNA is that we do not believe
the financials and as we will demonstrate in the next sections there is little reason for
anybody to believe they are real as they have been audited by an auditor who is not
qualified to perform an audit and have been signed by a member of management who at
the time of signing had announced a leave of absence from the company (more on this in
detail in the next sections).


Moreover, because of the continuous issuance of additional shares, such an investor
would continue to have their stake diluted down to even less meaningful levels.


In addition to the numerous valuation red-flags, Medical Marijuana, Inc. common share
count has increased a shocking 44.7% over the last 12 month and almost 200% over the
last 24 months for dubious reasons, further diluting investors. In that time period, the
Company has issued in excess of 550mm common shares worth over $200mm at the
current market valuation.


Management Team - Is this Who You Want Running Your Company?


As per the Medical Marijuana 2012 "Investor Fact Sheet" available on the Company
website, the following individuals are key members of the MJNA team. This toxic brew of
criminals and alleged fraudsters should give any investor serious concerns.

Ms. Michelle L. Sides - "Chairman" and Chief Operating Officer


According to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Ms. Michelle L. Sides is the Chairman of
the Board, Chief Operating Officer, and also indirectly controls ~ 48% of the Company
through her beneficial ownership of Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corp. In addition, she
is purportedly a Member of the Florida State Bar Association and possess extensive
experience in corporate and real estate law. Interestingly, the Florida Bar records for Ms.
Michelle Sides indicate she was previously the "Corporate Counsel" and sole employee
for "North American Companies, LLC," the same entity Mr. Michael Llamas purportedly
founded and utilized to execute "in excess of ten billion dollars in transactions" for
distressed debt. However, in reality, Ms. Michelle Sides has been kicked out of the Florida
Bar for unspecified reasons (rendering her not eligible to practice in Florida).


Simply put, it is hard to imagine trusting Ms. Michelle Sides with a library book, let alone
as the lead manager for a $355mm publicly traded company. Unfortunately, for most retail
investors in MJNA this is the first they have heard about this because Ms. Sides has
fraudulently omitted this material information from her official biographies and disclosures.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 5/97


Michael Llamas (Age - 28) - President and Director


According to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Mr. Michael Llamas (age 28) has served
as President and Director of the Company and also indirectly controls ~ 48% of the
Company through his beneficial ownership of Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corp. Also,
according to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Mr. Michael Llamas' sole prior business
experience was founding North America Companies LLC, a real estate development and
acquisitions firm specializing in distressed debt that completed "in excess of ten billion
dollars in transactions." Notably absent from Medical Marijuana filings is ANY discussion
of Mr. Michael Llamas prolific prior indictments for fraud and financial shenanigans.


First, on 09/14/12, Mr. Michael Llamas was indicted by the United States for the Eastern
District of California along with six other individuals for a case involving for 19 counts of
Mail Fraud and 31 counts of Wire Fraud related to a mortgage fraud scheme that caused
more than $10mm in losses to mortgage lenders and others. According to the indictment,
Mr. Michael Llamas would approach builders of new homes and developers of
condominiums to purchase investment homes in bulk at substantial price discounts
ranging from 30 to 50 percent off under the terms of an "option contract." Mr. Michael
Llamas had no financial ability and no intention of purchasing the homes; rather, the
homes were to be sold to an associate's nominee members at full price. Mr. Michael
Llamas then arranged for an affiliated mortgage company, Nationwide Lending Group
(NLG), to sell mortgage loans for the nominees with banks and other lenders at the full
price of the homes without disclosing the large price discount. Lenders were thereby
misled into advancing loans that far exceeded their lending guidelines. Also, the large
option contract price discount was used to conceal the lack of required down payments by

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 6/97


nominee buyers. Mr. Michael Llamas then split what remained of the price discount after
subtraction of the fake down payments and certain fees with his cronies. In addition, Mr.
Michael Llamas induced at least one home builder to record false liens in favor of one of
their entities, Cobalt One LLC, for millions of dollars in bogus loans to cover up large
payments from an associated firm to Cobalt One. If convicted, the Mr. Michael Llamas and
the other defendants face a maximum statutory penalty for each violation of mail and wire
fraud of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and a three-year term of supervised release.
As of 12/11/12, Mr. Michael Llamas has been released on bail pending trial (Appendix B).


On 09/17/12, just three days after being indicted by the Eastern District of California, Mr.
Michael Llamas announced a "leave of absence effective immediately" from Medical
Marijuana in order to "focus his attention on personal business matters." However, Mr.
Michael Llamas signed off and certified the Medical Marijuana 09/30/12 Financial and
Information Disclosure Statement (Appendix C) as the Company's "President. This is one
of many reasons why we believe the MJNA financials are fraudulent and most likely
fabricated.


More interesting is the fact that on 09/30/12 and 12/02/12, Mr. Michael Llamas and
Mr. Michael Corrigan, Esq. (MJNA's external counsel), respectively, certified that no
members of the Company's management team had been subject to "a conviction in
a criminal proceeding or named as a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding in
the past five years" (Appendix C & D). This appears to be a blatant fabrication in
regards to Mr. Michael Llamas prior court records. Moreover, THIS CLEARLY
VIOLATES the OTC Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines SECTION 8B.1


Next, on 12/05/07, Mr. Michael Llamas was sued by Mr. and Mrs. David Villar in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California for the Fraudulent Transfer
of the couple's home in San Mateo California via a $830k purchase option agreement
(Case No. 05-35167 TCLS)(Appendix E). While the matter was eventually privately
settled, it appears Mr. Michael Llamas was forced to pay restitution to the Villars.


Similarly, on 12/08/06, Mr. Michael Llamas (who was 22 at the time), was arrested by the
Tracy, California police department on charges of forgery, grand theft, financial elder
abuse and conspiracy. Specifically, Mr. Michael Llamas was accused of hoodwinking an
elderly couple into believing they had negotiated a reverse mortgage based on the $485k
equity value of their home, but instead transferred the title of the property to an entity
Llamas controlled for de minimis consideration.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 7/97


Mr. Michael Llamas seems to have engaged in such extensive mortgage fraud schemes
against so many other unsuspecting victims that there an anonymous blog was created in
2009 dedicated to tracking his activities. More information is available via:
http://mikellamas.blogspot.ca/


In summary, based on Mr. Michael Llamas exhaustive history of mail, wire, and mortgage
fraud, it is inconceivable he could effectively serve as a President and Director of a
$370mm publicly traded company. In this case, the reality of the situation is even worst as
Mr. Michael Llamas is not only the President and Director of Medical Marijuana, Inc., but
also the largest and controlling shareholder. We have good reason to believe that Mr.
Michael Llamas is directly involved in the liquidation of the free trading shares and will
cover this in more detail the next section.


Mr. Theodore Caligiuri - Purportedly Chief Executive Officer


On 09/30/12, Medical Marijuana announced it hired Mr. Theodore Caligiuri as "Interim
President and CEO." Interestingly, Mr. Theodore Caligiuri seems to be completely lacking
any prior experience as a manager of any publicly traded company, has yet to sign-off on
any financial statements, and still works as a residential real estate agent for Coldwell
Banker. In our opinion, he is completely unqualified to be the leader of a public enterprise
with a $356mm market value.


Say What?! HDDC Controls And Sells $1.5mm In Free Trading Shares On Behalf Of
MJNA


In what has to be one of the oddest cases of illegal share distribution/underwriting,
Medical Marijuana appears to sells its own shares to the public via a conduit (Llamas)
without a registration statement. This is blatantly illegal and after speaking to several
lawyers we are still unsure as to how the these two got this far without anybody else
figuring this out.


Below is an excerpt from the (OTCPK:MJNA) disclosure on the otcmarkets.com website.


Essentially, Mr. Michael Llamas, the 28 year old who controls MJNA, is identified as the
main party responsible for providing "working capital." In other words, Llamas is directly
financing MJNA. Mr. Michael Llamas does so by liquidating free trading shares of MJNA
he was awarded for almost ZERO consideration as part of the RTO. Not all of this
information is clearly disclosed as the Company does not elect to do so. However, by

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 8/97


reconciling the quarterly paid-in capital amount vs. the common shares outstanding, we
strongly believe the weighted average price MJNA has been selling its common shares to
Mr. Michael Llamas for less than $0.01/ while retail investors have just months later been
clamoring hand over first to purchase the shares at $0.40-0.50.


Apparently Ms. Michelle Sides has a side-deal with Mr. Michael Llamas whereby Llamas
holds, and most probably sells, free trading shares of MJNA on behalf of MJNA! As of
12/31/2012 disclosure date, Llamas held $1.5 million worth (or 15 million shares at the
time) of MJNA free trading shares on behalf of MJNA, effectively allowing the public
company to sell its own shares via a conduit. Craziest of all is that this $1.5mm is reflected
on the Company's own balance sheet and "audited" by a non-PCAOB registered
"independent auditor," Mr. Anthony Imbimbo.


The Auditor/Professional Cook Who Isn't PCAOB Registered


On 01/16/13 and with much fan-fare, Medical Marijuana Inc. issued a press release
announcing it had for the first time completed an "audit" and that it was publishing its
audited results to the investing public. On the back of this "development," retail investors
bid up shares of MJNA to as high as $0.54/share for an implied valuation of nearly half a
billion dollars!


It took us two seconds to figure out that the "Auditor" was in fact not licensed to audit
public companies at all. A public company audit must be carried out by a PCAOB (Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board) registered auditor. Otherwise, it's not a legitimate
audit, period end statement.


The so called "auditor" is actually a sole-practitioner (a la Madoff) CPA/Cook (we are not
making this stuff up Imbimbo has a degree from the Culinary Institute of America) named
Anthony W. Imbimbo. Imbimbo is clearly not qualified to audit a public company of with a
market valuation of this size and is one of the many reasons we believe the financials
cannot and should not be relied upon.


Having Their Cake And Eating it Too: Insider Sales - Extensive 144 Sales


In what is yet another example that solidifies our thesis that MJNA is nothing more than a
stock scam - MJNA insiders not only engage the services of Llamas to sell stock, they
also use rule 144, a rule we believe is not legally available to this company.


Rule 144 sales are only those sales made by active insiders and are limited to less than
1% of the outstanding a year. Based on the 144 filings, we believe there may have been
much more insider selling. In just one example we found (Appendix F) a transaction made

by Coldwell Banker real estate agent/ MJNA CEO Theodore Caligiuri whereby Mr.
Caligiuri is a willing seller of 461,450 shares of MJNA @ $.12 cents a share for total
proceeds of $55,374 in cash.


Most Importantly, Who Owns the Public Float? All 252,000,000 Shares Appear To
Have Been Sold To Clueless Retail Investors


After reviewing available public disclosures on current shareholdings, it is shockingly
apparently NO legitimate investors are invested or involved in the Company. Therefore, it
appears Mr. Michael Llamas and Ms. Michelle Sides have honed their prior experience in
mortgage fraud and other criminal activity into a new and more lucrative pursuit: penny
stock fraud. By massively increasing the public float, MJNA appears to have ensnared
hundreds, if not thousands of clueless retail investors.


MJNA Reminds A lot of People of CMKM Diamonds


There is nothing new under the sun. When brought to the attention of several prominent
legal counselors, the MJNA case instantaneously reminded many of them to a firm called
CMKM Diamonds. CMKM Diamonds was also an unsolicited pink sheet and that firm also
purported to be engaged in a very profitable business. However, CMKM Diamonds, like
MJNA, also had a weird relationship between its management and controlling shareholder.


Ultimately, the collapse of CMKM Diamonds cost investors over $100mm that was
eventually traced to the coffers of the management team, which had utilized the proceeds
to buy gaudy real estate and fast cars [shockingly similar to Mr. Michael Llamas prior
mortgage schemes].


In light of these numerous red-flags, we don't believe MJNA's financials and it is our
robust opinion that over time the Company will be proven an obvious fraud.


Conclusion:


After the information we highlighted retail investors should seriously consider exiting this
position immediately and speculative investors should consider a short position. We
cannot imagine why any investors would sit idle and let their hard earned money be
stewarded by the Sides/Llamas Duo. MJNA.PK is, in our view, yet another scheme they
have concocted to steal your money.


In closing we leave you with the "Top 5 Reasons to Sell MJNA Immediately" while this
stock trades at this temporary valuation:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 10/97


1. As an unsolicited issuer MJNA has no active market for its shares meaning that
bids or offers can be pulled immediately leading to a potential collapse of the
shares.


2. The so called "Audit" and "Auditor" are in fact not qualified to Audit the
company. As such, none of these purported facts and figures should be relied
upon.


3. The company is run and controlled by a 28 year old fraudster with a terrible
history of financial crimes and devilish ethics.


4. As uncovered by our investigation the company and its insiders have engaged
in fraud by purposely omitting the background information from the disclosures
made on the OTC. This alone could result in a trading halt by regulators.


5. Llamas owning/controlling $1.5mm worth of MJNA shares on behalf of MJNA is
de-facto illegal share distribution. But it also highlights that Llamas is most
probably the guy liquidating the hundreds of millions of undisclosed shares too.


New Information: In addition to all this, we discovered today that PhytoSPHERE
(OTCQB:PHOT), a direct subsidiary of MJNA, paid $100K in cash to bail Michael
Llamas from jail. This was never disclosed as it should have been in the
12/31/"Audit" and is yet another example of fraud perpetrated by MJNA.

So you think it's better for contributors to not have a position?


Personally, I think having a little 'skin in the game' is better than not. At least then I think it's more likely the
contributor actually believes what he is writing.


After reading the article, I think MJNA should only be invested in by sophisticated investors. Common folks
should stay away until some good due diligence comes out confirimg whether these guys are frauds or legit.

I really am not sure what this guy is trying to say here, but it is amazing that he was able to pick all penny
stocks that have increased over their 52 week highs, there is not a financial man on the universe that could
come close to being this accurate.

If he is 'manipulating' the stock, then presumably you believe it is now (or will be) at 'the wrong' price.


If that's the case I suggest you getting your buying boots on.... use it to your advantage.

But if they are indeed legit wouldn't this make an excellent buying opportunity? Having some skin in the game
helps legitamize the authors position but the timing of his release given his short position wrt to short
coverage is suspect. When Timothy Sykes predicts a bear raid I guess it's best to pay attention. He seems
adept at big time manipulation. Just cost $100 market capital loss for MJNA. Reloaded for Tuesday.

Actually, no, it's not. The prices in the "Subsequent Low" column are from immediately after the author's hit
pieces were published. If you look up the current prices of those stocks, many have already recovered, and
almost all of them are not as low as they were immediately after the articles attacking them were published.


15 Feb 2013, 01:59 PM

Could I enquire whether you have ever posted the same sort of comment along the lines of:


"Disclosure: I am long XXXX, folks please read the first line - please"?


I am just curious why there is such vitriol towards those who are short stock but none at all towards
contributors who are long stock.


They're both just 'positions', aren't they?

Pre Market was $.03 higher than the opening 15 minutes later.


Thank you for the Article. I sold my Majority of Shares, in MJNA & HEMP.


Update on POOSF: 
Posedian is restating it's earnings.


Q4 lost $100,000,000. of earnings, due to a Corp. that they did Business for, not paying. This is a contract dispute. 
I spoke to their Spokesperson yesterday. 
They have 100 water tanks in the field, & 300 that sit idle, due to increased competition. 
They are speaking to their bank now about options. 
It did not sound good to me. 
That will be my Last Loser for the Year. 
Looks like a Vulture Take Over behind the scenes by the Competition. Stay Tough, everyone. 
Keep your stops, tight.


Even Bakken company's, sitting on a Black Gold Mine, can get a Vulture, in the mix.

But your missing the WHOLE POINT ...I'd rather invest in the mob, much safer than this. point being,
Mr.Lamas is obviously in trouble, which unfortunately brings down mjna with him, not on a morale level, but a
criminal level...big GOV drools over the big $$ it WILL take in from confiscation, the co. AND YOUR

MMJ is a small but hot market, other fish are swimming by NOW, so don't chase a fish you cant out swim, try
this one in front of you..MWIP.. I held that stock less than 2 weeks, out at 246%..now its back low to 9 cents,
its new low & a 12 or 13 tgt for the coming week...use ur heart to plant seeds in a ditch to keep the faith, but
use your head when it comes to your $$

You forgot to mention that MJNA is a profitable company which has agreed to become a full reporting company and
has applied to move to the OTCqx exchange.


They earned a profit of over $3 million in Q4 of 2012, and have already a deal in place for $35 million at the start of
2013. You can do your own DD at http://bit.ly/TZJc6W


The author from this article is short MJNA which explains the motive for ommiting the fact that MJNA has huge upside
potential.

Allegations you are referring to have nothing to do with the progress and efforts to bring

The profit of $3 million and deal for $35 million were audited by this Imbimbo character. I had an accountant
look at it last week, basically confirming what this article says. There could be literally nothing there, and
considering the history, are likely.

The author says MJNA is "chronically criminal". When I wade through all his BS I see this:


A woman who got busted with alcohol before she was 21. A few years later she got pulled over driving with a
suspended license, the cop find a pipe in the car and county throws child neglect at her. Then recently she
commits petty theft and is ordered to pay $424. This is the only person in the article who has been found
guilty of anything in this article. 
On a sidenote she can't practice law in Florida because she is delinquent with the states ongoing education
requirements. Maybe she was busy helping to run a company?


Llamas is indicted, yes, but that is not a mark of guilt. The bottom of the indictment even repeats that. If
you've followed MJNA you know this is old news and Llamas hasn't worked for MJNA for months. Not
criminal.


Ted still has a job with Coldwell? How is this criminal? MJNA was only netting a few hundred grand not that
long ago. I wouldn't expect him to really be raking it in at this point. Why is this even brought up. Not criminal.


Imbimbo has a Culinary Arts degree? Awesome, but why is this even mentioned? He also has a bachelors in
Accounting and is a CPA. You can view his actual license online if you're so inclined.


Also note the authors language regarding Anthony: "therefore unqualified to independently audit an SEC
reporting companies". Did you catch that? The author is slick and he's correct. But since MJNA is a pink sheet
that doesn't report to the SEC (http://1.usa.gov/XIuodw) they don't have to use a PCAOB registered
accountant. Not criminal.


So, we have one actual person who has been found guilty of a couple petty things. I don't think this makes
her a bad person, or MJNA a bad company. Hell, she probably pretty smart, she's just made some bad
decisions. I bet if we could read the details of the petty property theft it would be along the lines of something
funny ~ like getting back at an ex-boyfriend or something.

Ummm...they're profitable according to who? According to themselves, that's who.


Also I'm incredibly surprised the author didn't mention the fact that their entire business is illegal under federal
law, and at any moment the feds could shut them down and send a bunch of people to jail for life. Most
people don't understand how illegal what they're doing is. And before someone quotes the other SA article
that they get away with it through "licensing fees," that is completey 100% illegal also. Profiting off of
marijuana is federally illegal no matter how you look at it. Actually it is probably worse, because then MJNA is
not only selling a federally illegal substance but they are also racketeering, by using other companies to
shield them from prosecution.


I would suspect that the feds are building a case against them right now because there's nothing the DEA
hates more than being embarrassed publicly, in essence what Keber has been doing since the Nov. elections
in all of his TV spots. Even if they didn't get MJNA itself the feds could get all of the companies they "license"
their formulas to in a heartbeat, which would leave mjna SOL.


I would trade this stock just on the momentum swings (if you know what you're doing), but asa long-term
serious investment...maybe I'd empty out my change charge and buy a few shares just for laughs.


FD: bought MJNA at .05 sold at .12; bought at .3 sold at .4

The author forgot to mention the facts that MJNA is a profitable company that recently signed a $35 million dollar deal
to start 2013. Maybe that has to do with the fact that the author is short MJNA.


MJNA is poised to become a very profitable company in 2013 and has filed to move to the OTCqx exchange and is
becomming a fully reporting company.


Do yourself a favor and do your own DD on this company. An opportunity like this may never happen again.

The author had to pull the part about Michelle Sides criminal record because it was made up, and totally

The other claims have also been proven untrue. Here is the rebuttal which appeared on the MJNA iHub

Quote: 
Anthony W. Imbimbo


"Independent Auditor"


Not PCAOB Registered (therefore unqualified to independently audit an SEC reporting companies)


Culinary Institute of America trained Chef (with a minor in cooking the books?)


 
You fail to mention that Mr. Anthony Imbimbo is a CPA, with an Accounting degree from Bridgeport University.
Included on the same page you referenced - were you hoping people just wouldn't read? He also worked at
Ernst & Young and multiple regional firms.

He is not currently registered with the PCAOB, but was registered until 2010 when he withdrew registration -
Imbimbo - PCAOB Registration. Likely withdrew his registration as there is a yearly fee associated with
PCAOB membership and he does not audit any SEC reporting companies.


 
2) 
Quote: 
Ms. Michelle L. Sides - "Chairman" and Chief Operating Officer


According to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Ms. Michelle L. Sides is the Chairman of the Board, Chief
Operating Officer, and also indirectly controls ~ 48% of the Company through her beneficial ownership of
Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corp. In addition, she is purportedly a Member of the Florida State Bar
Association and possess extensive experience in corporate and real estate law. Interestingly, the Florida Bar
records for Ms. Michelle Sides indicate she was previously the "Corporate Counsel" and sole employee for
"North American Companies, LLC," the same entity Mr. Michael Llamas purportedly founded and utilized to
execute "in excess of ten billion dollars in transactions" for distressed debt. However, in reality, Ms. Michelle
Sides has been kicked out of the Florida Bar for unspecified reasons (rendering her not eligible to practice in
Florida).


She has not been kicked out of the Florida Bar - she is delinquent in her continuted education (CLER)
requirements - more info here. She is more focused on running a company than keeping current with her
continued education requirements.


 
3) 
Quote: 
More interesting is the fact that on 09/30/12 and 12/02/12, Mr. Michael Llamas and Mr. Michael Corrigan, Esq.
(MJNA's external counsel), respectively, certified that no members of the Company's management team had
been subject to "a conviction in a criminal proceeding or named as a defendant in a pending criminal
proceeding in the past five years" (Appendix C & D). This appears to be a blatant fabrication in regards to Mr.
Michael Llamas prior court records. Moreover, THIS CLEARLY VIOLATES the OTC Pink Basic Disclosure
Guidelines SECTION 8B.1


Lies again... the filing from 9/30/12 does not include any such statement. The filing from 12/2/2012 states: 
Quote: 
To the best of my knowledge, after inquiry inquiry of management and the board of directors, neither the
issuer, any 5% shareholder, nor counsel is under investigation by any federal, or state regulatory authority for
any violation of federal or state securities laws.


Although it is unfortunate that Llamas is involved in the wire fraud case, that is not a securities case. You do
have a valid point that Llamas signed as president after stepping down, but I would imagine these documents
were already prepared and signed as of 9/17/12 and it was an oversight that Ted Caligiuri needed to sign as
President. Michael LLamas has all but been disassociated with the company since being indicted - the
company is now in good hands.

Mr. Theodore Caligiuri - Purportedly Chief Executive Officer


On 09/30/12, Medical Marijuana announced it hired Mr. Theodore Caligiuri as "Interim President and CEO."
Interestingly, Mr. Theodore Caligiuri seems to be completely lacking any prior experience as a manager of
any publicly traded company, has yet to sign-off on any financial statements, and still works as a residential
real estate agent for Coldwell Banker. In our opinion, he is completely unqualified to...


I apologize, I don't have a Seeking Alpha membership (and won't register if this type of rubbish gets
published), so I will have to stop here: Mr. Ted Caligiuri has served on the MJNA board since early 2011 when
MJNA partnered with Cannabank - source. In the last reference you will find that Mr. Caligiuri has a past as
an entrepreneur, including:


 
Quote: 
A Southern California native, Mr. Caligiuri is an accomplished leader and MJNA shareholder with over 25
years of business management experience. He is known in the San Diego community not only for his
business leadership, but for his involvement in several charitable organizations including the YMCA. His
professional experience includes work as a management consultant and technology consultant. As a
management consultant, he assisted companies in managing growth and streamlining operations. As a
technology consultant, he assisted companies in the identification and proprietary control of technologies for
new products, including the commercialization of NASA developed technologies. In 1991, he founded an
environmental product company targeted at reducing waste by enhancing the convenience of re-usable
shopping bags. In this role, Mr. Caligiuri invented and patented new consumer-focused shopping bag
concepts. In the early 2000's he was the Chief Operating Officer of an ergonomic writing instrument company
and was responsible for doubling sales and filing 6 patents over the course of 2 years. Currently, he works as
a Real Estate Consultant for Coldwell Banker Commercial.


In addition, Mr. Caligiuri has an MBA from California State University, Long Beach. Can we please hear more
about your qualifications before I start taking your word over someone who has found such success as Mr.
Caligirui?


Please keep turning those stones... add fuel to the fire for this libel suit.

Great research regardless of the topic. My question or point is : because of fed laws isn't it almost impossible for any
medicinal firms to bank anywhere, even for basic business transactions? Even when it is legal per state law and
regardless of this particular history in this situation? HSBC laundered money for the worlds drug biz and got a huge
fine but its nothing compared to the laws they broke... Not fair.

The Short & Distort Scheme  
Stage I: Monitoring  
In stage I of a Short & Distort scheme Short groups Monitor spikes in volumes on stocks with no rumors.


Stage 2: Flagging  
Shorts Flag stocks that run up then sits back and wait patiently for their time.


Stage 3: Preparation  
The Shorters research the company and develop their Distortion of the rumors to be used later.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 35/97


Stage 4: Actual Shorting  
The shorts step in selling on every possible up tick. This is the Reverse of front loading. Preparations are made to
attack the guy who had earlier written positively about the company and take out, discredit, any new long-term
champions or messengers.


Stage 5: Distortion Campaign  
The shorts step in and increase selling on every possible up tick. Just as with the pump, newsletters, e-mail, PR firms
against P & D, etc. are simulated. Expertise in the field is recruited for credibility. Any possible twist using POS
(Purposely Omitted Syntax) and PAS (Purposely Added Syntax) is conveniently used on every possible angle. If the
POS/PAS is discovered then attack the messenger. Above all control the message boards.  
The group clutters the message boards so no positive information can be readily found. Justification is the Value of
the Company in the market. Projections of $0.00 worth and loss projections of 100%  
Note: The market manipulator will do everything in his/her power to keep buyers OUT OF THE STOCK. Cut your
losses is touted to stimulate fear. You bought higher but now they need you to sell lower.


Stage 6: Pressure  
The shorts have taken it too far. The volume is increasing and the price is not effectively dropping. A stalemate
occurs. Personal attacks increase. Threats of legal action, SEC involvement, and yes even death threats increase.
Increased secret IDs are employed to increase the cluttering, personal attacks and the distortion. So begins a string of
lies that run for as long as one's stomach can take it. Desperately playing on the "you have been had" scenario. Any
new news will be hit it hard by shorters to kill any interest.


Note: Watch the volume not the share price. A market manipulator will have various brokers buying and selling the
stock to give the APPEARANCE of increasing volume but the price goes down. Thus stimulating the story the
company is selling or an off shore reg S or other convenient scenario. Watch for large blocks that show up but have a
MM special code, cross overs, etc.


Stage 7: The Cover  
Without warning the buying pressure is too much and the short begins to cover. Short covering combined with new
investors buying into the stock causes the stock to go up. Often the whole thing starts again. Just a vicious cycle
sometimes.  
______________________... 
Note: Pump & Dump schemes I have seen are investigated by the SEC most of the time, however the Short & Distort
scheme is not apparently high on the SEC's agenda. The shorts, unlike the dumper though, has an unlimited loss
factor should the stock price go up.


Most traders have heard and read of the Pump & Dump scheme. But very little has been written about the other side
of the trade or its opposite, which is the Short & Distort.


Now lets take the Short & Distort scheme and apply it to the rules of Pump & Dump for stock manipulators.


In order to make these market manipulations work, the professionals assume:  
(a) The Public is STUPID and 
(b) The Public will mainly buy at the HIGH and 
(c) The Public will sell at the LOW.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 36/97


Therefore, as long as the market manipulator can run crowd control, he can be successful in his agenda of stock
manipulation by controlling the market's greed and fear.

You mean kind of like a pump and dump scheme where people take a current mainstream idea (such as

It's a tough area. On the one hand, anyone, long or short, who is manipulating a stock by posting false

reviled.


It would be unrealistic to expect someone like this author to do the kind of work he did and publish it for a
penny-per-pageview. I have no issue at all if his work is honest and he has been transparent, which is the
case from what I can tell.


If you want to form buy opinions or maintain bullish ones by making an ad hominem attack on the author and
his methods rather than addressing the points raised, my guess is that your investing days will likely be short-
lived or riddled with massive losses.

MJNA's flagship holding, Dixie, is featured on Fast Company 2 days ago: http://bit.ly/XDx5xd


Doesn't sound too shady to me.


There will be extreme highs and lows with stocks like these. It's just short term traders profiting. It takes balls to hold.
Just keep doing DD.

complete lie. How/ Where did you get those documents? I would like to look at them myself

This is just another stunt to make the stock drop, So they can buy up shares, (Dont fall for it and loose your position)
There is always someone that missed the boat and will spend a lot of time and effort 
to get you to sell so they can establish a good position.

If you search Short and Distort and Distort and Short on SA, you will find a number of articles about various
manipulators and manipulation groups that practice this scam on a regular basis. In most cases, the S&D scammers
have shady pasts and criminal records themselves. Do your DD. Don't believe every thing you read on SA. This type
of scam is growing in popularity since the SEC spends more time cracking down on Pump and Dump Scammers then
S&D scammers.


We have no idea what the background of the authors are. They can make all sorts of claims with impunity.


The first question to ask is: What is the authors motivation to slam a particular company. 99.9% of the time it is not for
altruism. It is for personal gain. Nobody goes to the trouble to write such an article for the "Good of the Investing
Community". They have some sort of stake in it. They want to manipulate the share price for some sort of financial
reason.


So all of you that have so quickly jumped on the wagon are either part of the scam or chicken littles screaming "Oh
My, The Sky Is Falling"


Here is my disclosure: I am Long. I have already made money and took my base investment and some profit out. I still
have a substantial position, and intend to stay with it. This kind of crap is now a part of day to day trading. I believe
there is a green rush getting underway. MJ is a multi billion dollar industry. States like Colorado and Washington see it
as a way to improve revenue and fulfill the desires of the majority of their citizens.


So, once again, do your DD. Don't fall for the scams. Make your own educated decisions. As in most of these
situations, the longs win out in the end. The shorters make a quick buck and the management has their reputations
challenged.

I actually agree in part with what you say (and it applies to longs as well as shorts), but I challenge you to
address the issues this author raised rather than to dismiss them because of the actions you describe among
other authors. His record is right on this page, so it would appear to me that it would be worth your time to
figure out why he is wrong than to just dismiss him as a "scamster" because his view is diametrically opposed
to your own.


15 Feb 2013, 12:16 PM

I will address the issues here.


1.) This author makes absurd claims about the financials, and even goes far enough to saying their CPA is a
phony. That is a garbage claim as anyone with a brain can google the CPA's name to find he has 25+ years of
experience.  
2.) Yes this company trades under different regulations than most companies, but they are attempting to
switch over. 
3.) This author is a crook and writes articles for his personal gain, he should be expelled from seeking alpha.


15 Feb 2013, 02:00 PM 


debauche
None of them will address anything, because they are in love with the stock and don't want to hear anything
else. I am amazed at all the apologists here waving off criminal pasts like it doesn't matter as long as they get
in on the action and get a piece... As long as it's not them that gets taken. They don't realize that they are a
huge part of the downfall of the country and a large part of it's problem. But you probably couldn't beat the
facts into their heads with a 2x4 so in the end it probably doesn't matter as they will eventually get taken as
well and disappear.


16 Feb 2013, 11:08 AM

And you don't write for your own gain? Difference is is when you write you don't disclose things like criminal
pasts. Your a contributor, you can do better than that.. Refute any of the points.. None of you cheerleaders

article refuting every point.

need to stay out of these waters because when you freak out and sell low 
the smart ones grab them up. Don't forget why you bought them in the first place. I'm betting it wasn't so you

@ Sean Nolan


I write articles for "personal gain" but also because I just want to share my research -- but that is basically that
is what everyone does. Including you: http://bit.ly/Xc0odP


For instance, you wrote last week:


"Going long on MJNA is a great bet to increase your portfolio 10+ times. MJNA fluctuates daily and that
provides a great opportunity to not only go long, but to also day trade and short. Some days in the past
months have seen gains over 65%. Timing is key as this stock is extremely volatile, so do your research and
buy when it's low, preferably below 30 cents, but it's not going to stay low forever; don't miss out on the green
rush!"


Those are pretty fraudulent statements frankly. I mean, I have found good companies, but never ones which
promised to increase my portfolio by ten times. (No ten baggers yet! But guess what? If I find a ten bagger I
will share it on SA for "personal gain" and if I am right people won't say "oh you are just writing this for
personal gain" they will, instead, say "thanks! coat tail riding sure is a good practice!")

I have an uncle who is a bail bondsman. Before that he was a licensed CPA doing audit work for penny stock
companies and teaching accounting at a local college. His CPA career and licensure came to a screeching
halt after he was subpoenaed to testify before a Congressional organized crime and racketeering committee
about his audit work. The moral to this story is that "credentials" is not a synonym for "credibility".


17 Feb 2013, 10:28 AM

Held 50,000 shares until I read this article and then sold. I had one direct dealing with the company. I sent
them an e-mail and asked them to explain what portion of each portfolio company , MJNA actually owned.
Tripp of Dixie said on NBR that he owned the company; and I wanted clarification. No answer was ever
received.


During the first part of his NBR interview Tripp said the only thing MJNA owned was intellectual property,
specifically patents. Until I saw this article I did have my finger firmly planted on the sell button, and with the
article's appearance I pressed it.


So far only confirmed flaw to the write up is that the symbol PHOT does NOT apply to an MJNA portfolio
company. It applies to GrowLIFE.

With that said, MJNA is supposed to release forward looking statements early next week, which most would expect to
be fairly bullish based on the interview with Tripp Keber. It is a bit interesting that this article would come out on the
heels of that announcement. Most of the fraudulent activity claimed, didn't occur in the past few weeks, all the
information was out there for years. I think the timing of the release of this article does call into question its reliability.

Your information is way off the mark. MJNA is involved in DC as well as the European Union so that the
Federal Government and European Union can help navigate cannabis/hemp/marijuana into a legitimate

Alan, The problem with this article is that he mentions all sorts of people within thew company, but where are the
atcual facts of the president of the company Tripp Kiber?


He has been the spokesperson for this company for a long time. It is due to his efforts that the company is growing
and the whole industries foundation is on this company.


Any right wing bible thumper can write about the world is coming to an end and everyone wants to jump off the cliff
with him. Why would 60 minutes, a very reputable show to a documentary on them? Don't you think they would have
done a little investigating before they go and put their 60 minute name on the line?


Have the author show us the proof that Tripp is bad! Hell I have a sister that's a Crack Whore, but that doesn't make
the whole family bad.

MJNA does not disclose anything about their management we believed this was the same Michelle L. Sides
(same exact first middle initial and last name as well as from Florida which is same location as MJNA's
Michelle Sides) Unfortunately for MJNA investors this one paragraph still leaves serious red flags and cause
for concern.

1) The real Michelle L. Sides is still disbarred from Florida contrary to her claiming she is a lawyer. See for
yourself here: 
http://bit.ly/VmLROo


2) The 28 year old Llamas who is being sued by the DOJ for Mortgage Fraud is still the one who controls 48%
of the company and is liquidating shares that you all are buying from him every day. 
See for yourself: http://1.usa.gov/XDKJ3p


And: http://bit.ly/VmLROs


3) Why did MJNA's Counsel certify no 5% shareholders were under investigation ? This in and of itself could
result in a trading suspension of the company as it is in violation of securities laws.


4) How the hell did Llamas sign off on financial statements on 9/30/2012 when he resigned on 9/17/2012 - yet
another case of fraud.


5) How can an audit be trusted when the auditor is not qualified to audit the company (he is not PCAOB
registered).


Finally for all you dreamers. MJNA has no FCF even if you believe what we think are inaccurate net income
figures note how every quarter in existence the company has to use that net income to purchase a "business"
or "inventories" this results in no actual cash flow or owners income.


Anyone who understands accounting knows that MJNA is an unprofitable sinking ship if you were to believe it
was a legitimate enterprise, something we do not.


MJNA is a stock scam in our opinion.

FWIW, I sold my long position in MJNA a couple of weeks ago, and haven't held a long or short position
since.


1) While the MyLife link shows her name with the title, Esq, it also indicates that she lives in Port Huemene,
CA which is North of Los Angeles, and about three hours by car from San Diego. Intellius also shows that
Michelle Louise Sides has a San Diego address, and a white pages search finds a Michelle Sides at what
appears to be a condo in Wimberly Sq, San Diego, about 16 miles from MJNA's offices.

The MyLife page may not have been updated in awhile, and BTW, while MJNA's 3Q filing says that she has a
law degree, I don't think that it claims that she's a practicing attorney.


Regarding being disbarred in FL, it was because she didn't meet continuing education requirement, as I
stated in another post. If she's been living in CA for awhile, and plans to stay, why would she want to take
continuing ed classes in FL to remain in the Bar?


2) Regarding Llamas' sale of stock, if the funds are being used to provide money for expansion, then I don't
have a problem with it.


3) Don't know.


4) My guess as to why Llamas signed-off on the 3Q report was because he was CEO until two weeks before
the end of the quarter, and was responsible for most of the decisions made in the reported period.


5) Imbimbo is a licensed CPA in CA:


http://tinyurl.com/ao7...


You may be correct that an SEC-reporting company requires an audit by a CPAOB member, but MJNA
doesn't yet file reports with the SEC.


I agree that these pink sheet stocks are risky, and the company stock, even if the recent Q4 report is to be
believed, is overvalued (why I sold), but your attack is likely overstated.

Dude the only scam here is you. You are already back tracking on some of your statements. This is a classic
Short and Distort Scam. Where is your disclosure? You have a past history of running this scam in the past.
You write under an anonymous name so we have no idea of who you are. Check out this guys profile. here is
the first line:


"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover
their senses slowly, and one by one. - Charles Mackay, 1841"


Now if this isn't a slap in the face. He basically states, Ha Ha, I can write an article and get all you folks to
freak, herd up and stampede in the direction I want....


Plus he gets paid for writing this stuff. Comes up with an inflammatory piece on a stock with lots of play and
Ca Ching the cash register rings.


Complain to SA about aiding and abetting a stock manipulation.


I for one resent the fact that this guy (don't know his name) thinks of his readers as a herd.


So dude what is your name, I would love to google you.


Any time some one won't identify them selves either says he is a liar or has something to hide. Since you
don't have the nads to print your name why should we believe a word you have to say. My name is on my
posts.

If he states his name he will have to change it to ever have any credibility again. Considering the short, the

Again, you're mistaken. She is not only a Member in Good Standing, but she has had no disciplinary action in
10 years.

Rolling O Research, Contributor
She wasn't a Member in Good Standing at the time this article was published one year ago.


I'm the one who first posted that the author had identified the wrong Michelle Sides in the original article, and
the author removed that section.


My contemporaneous research showed, however, that Sides had not kept up with her continuing education
(look about twelve posts up from this one). That is apparently why she lost her Membership. Sometime over
the past year, she corrected that problem.

As Chairman and COO, I can understand the doubt that I am on this board - and I assure you, I have never posted,
but I do read what others have to say about our company and we are grateful for the continued support. However, I
am not able to let that article just remain without defending myself and this company. We have worked incredibly hard
to build a company we are very proud of and I will not let some shady broker or competitor trying to short our stock
get away with those criminal actions. Once we have our direction from the litigation counsel - I will post it on our
website to keep you updated.


My contact information is also on this board, as well as our website and OTC so anyone is welcome to contact me at
anytime.


Have a great weekend,  
Michelle Sides

any smart investor would have already researched this information already, before purchasing the stock. learning
about the executives is very important for start up companies. this company has a real product. The industry of
medical cannabis, and recreational cannabis is going to explode regardless of what happens here andb MJNA has
actual products that are selling. they have real revenues. Facebook is trading at a P/E of 1937. they are a simple
website that feeds our collective boredom.


i respect the analysis but I do not feel that this company is fraudulent or cooking the books. being that they sell a
product in a developing industry, and one that is still federally illegal- I can see why a major accounting firm hasn't
audited them. maybe they didn't seek a large accounting firm for the audit, maybe they couldn't afford one- who
knows. the bottom line is, they have revenue that they have reported. if someone loses their life savings in this stock
that is their fault. buying a couple hundred shares provides a lot of upside potential, with minimal downside.


a lot of people are scared to participate in the medical cannabis industry, which is why a real estate broker is in there.
i know many real estate brokers who have started there- and moved into other industries. that job allows them to do
many things. what's wrong with that? medical cannabis isn't rocket science. it has been used for thousands of years
and it was made illegal for racist reasons. the industry will explode and save our economy. watch and see.

Regarding Sides being disbarred in FL, since the reason listed is "Delinquent - CLER", and a click on that link gives
the following info,


"CLER Delinquent Members. Any member who is suspended by reason of failure to complete continuing legal
education requirements shall be deemed a delinquent member."


Apparently, she didn't take the required continuing education courses in FL, which I assume would have been
pointless, since she has lived in CA for awhile now.

And of course, the main point of the article is that MJNA isn't an SEC reporting company, which is true, but
the company has repeatedly stated that it is working to uplist to the OTCQX, and that requires more, and

The rest is just an effort to use public information -- that's been discussed before -- to create more FUD.

Great detective work there Infitialis. The alleged mug shot of Michelle Sides has already been removed from this

had a whole section about how Michelle Sides was a two bit criminal, complete with mug shot. The only problem was
that the information was all fabricated. Infitialis has his own short sell fraud scheme going it seems. How does this

So am I to understand that it's not good to invest in a company run by criminals, unscrupulous people, and/or those
who are attempting to cash in on an upcoming bonanza? Hmm. I suppose I'll have to dump half of my portfolio now.

Alan, I appreciate your concern, however Michael Llamas WAS Charged for real estate fraud.


He is not the current CEO of the company.


This was being done back in september. There is no recent news besides another court date for Llamas and some
associated to him in this matter.


It gave me pause, I did my DD on it. It's in the open that the ORIGINAL CEO does have a criminal background. This
is common knowledge.


If you are arguing that the double-psychological reversal of presenting transperancy is a strategy to create a sense of
false comfort, well who knows?


I don't believe it though, but perhaps I am biased and will lose everything?


Or the opposite.


But such is risk in life. That is why I haven't put all my eggs into this golden basket.

I looked into Yobimbo last week, and yes, he is certified and a board member of some notable accounting
orgs, etc. However, I had another accountant look at his audit, and he said it was odd for a few reasons I can't
represent properly. The numbers also involved inventory acquired in Romania, I assume that's this oil which
was $5 million in inventory, but then sold to who knows who for $35 million. So this is supposedly the ironclad
numbers that everyone quotes when talking about how great the company is doing. I've read so many
complaints online about people never receiving the product they purchased, this magic chewing gum.


Llamas may no longer be the president, but he holds 48% of the stock, along with Michelle Sides 48%. Who
cares if he's registered at the company any longer or whether her background is clear. 
This article makes clear the illegal aspect to how they've been dealing this stock, and you bet the SEC will
hone in and make an example of a bunch of newbie fraudsters whipping up a 300 million dollar froth. These
guys don't have a bank to hide behind. They are such an easy target, and Llamas made himself far too visible
this time.


Tripp Keiber is immaculate after signing up with a 28 year old with this kind of past? Cmon, This article fails to
mention the numerous past reverse splits. The logo of the company is derived from a medical symbol, and yet
what kind of pharma background does this company have? ZERO. I got to give the scammers credit for the
name, it sure sucked me in. So glad I got out last week.

I'll answer what I have to say about his allegations. As far as the CPA goes. Well he doesn't need the license the
author listed because of where MJNA is listed. That could mean the difference between a $10,000 audit and a
$100,000 audit. The fact the auditor has a degree in cooking...so what? I went to a cooking school in Tuscany for two
weeks, does that make me a cook? The guy is a CPA with extensive experience including forensic accounting and
fraud investigations. Look up his website. Would he risk his reputation and credibility by knowingly publishing false
statements?


As far as Llamas. What do you expect in a quasi illegal field? Is it ideal? No. Would I rather see a Yale MBA behind a
company that I'm investing in? Not necessarily. The key to survival for these marijuana companies is going to be their
flexibility to change and allow qualified management take over and lead the company.


I also can't find anything on otcmarkets.com regarding the HDDC being the majority holder... Can someone verify this
information and publish a link?


The bottom line is no institutional investor is going to touch these stocks yet. With their working capital and federal
regulations they won't touch these until they have gained more legal acceptance. This, author, is why no retail or
institutional investor has touched them. The rest of us just see the potential in the field and think we can make money.

Imbimbo's Culinary degree was awarded in 1979.

Maybe so and maybe not. It is subject to speculation as it is a new investing frontier that nobody other than
the personal investor will touch. It is also subject to more controversy than any other stock because it deals in
marijuana. Oh, and the federal government could rain fire and brimstone on it and repossess all company
assets under federal law. Still it's a gamble that I'm willing to make.


Personally I like my odds with this one better than I like Vegas. Vegas has taken tens of thousands of my

The Michelle Sides cited in this article is not the Michelle Sides who runs MJNA.


"Michelle Louise Sides vs Michelle Lynn Sides


The SA article by Infitialis lists Michelle Lynn Sides, age 32, as the Chairman and COO.


But today, a Michelle Sides, posting under the alias MSidesMJNA has said that she isn't the same woman, and in fact,
is 43 years old.


So I've done a little research of my own:


Michelle Lynn Sides, 32 (born 10/12/80) was again arrested in Brevard County, FL, on 9/11/12. Here is the mug shot
from that arrest (she looks better in this photo than the one on SA):


http://bit.ly/15ihw5j


Note that here address is in Palm Bay, FL, several thousand miles from San Diego.


Now, Intellius lists a Michelle Louise Sides, 43 (same age as MSidesMJNA) who has lived in both Port Huemene, CA
and San Diego, CA (home of MJNA):


http://bit.ly/Zg4pRn


I have found a photo of a Michelle Sides, Esq on Mylife which lists her age as 43, and who lives, or lived, in Port
Huemene.

I am an accountant and my portfolio consists almost exclusively of large well known company stocks and funds. But
sometimes I play, and I decided to put a few hundred dollars into this company. Certainly some of this article bothers
me, but it is encouraging that any CPA firm is auditing them. I am less concerned with the auditor being registered
with PCAOB, as that is sort of understandable at this point due to the expense of registered auditors. Still, the CPA
still means something and this auditor does have a clean record (I checked). What would help me is to see the
auditor's opinion, which I have not found so far.

I was directly involved with this company...we had an agreement that I would receive X.XM shares of stock as
payment for services I provided, but could not "cash in" until Dec 2012. After several calls to my contact on the
published list of "managers" I received no call back. I then asked a friend who is a stock broker to help me cash out...it
turns out, that the stocks were never actually placed under my name by the company at all, and that ALL of the stocks
are held by Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas Asset Management. I am NOT an investor, just someone who did work, and
expected to get paid...now I have no idea what to expect, or who to turn to....P.S. I always thought that Llamas guy

Come on VM....so many people learn so much from SA. It's a huge educational tool. In certain circumstances
it could be argued that SA moves a stock. That means SA is now becoming respected as a place to come.
Ban SA....OK, let's ban GS and all of the other manipulating brokerage houses.

Ya know, I've got to wonder if the author of this article has opened him or herself up to a lawsuit for libel.

5/20/2018 Chronically Criminal: Shielding The Public From Medical Marijuana - Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTCMKTS:MJNA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 60/97


After all, the author claimed in this article (since redacted) that MJNA's Michelle Sides had "an extensive criminal
history for a variety of criminal offenses in Florida" before it was shown (by me on this board and i-Hub) that the
criminal history was that of a different Michelle Sides who lived in FL, not San Diego, CA.


The author apparently decided not to use services like Intellius to determine if there was another Michelle L Sides,
(perhaps living within a few miles of MJNA's San Diego HQ,) because the story of Michelle Lynn Sides, convicted
criminal living in FL, was too good to check.


Once it was determined that there were multiple Michelle L Sides, a quick call to MJNA would have allowed the author
to rule out the younger MLS, but again, it was too good to check.


And so the author wrote a libelous statement, which while now redacted, is still out there, and will be placed into
evidence during discovery:

I wonder if the money he/she made on shorting MJNA will cover the legal fees?

Seems like an honest mistake and it sure was corrected quickly. There is a lot more to this author's thesis
than just that point.


15 Feb 2013, 04:37 PM 


Rolling O Research, Contributor
An "honest mistake" that at the low of the day, took the company's market cap 31% lower and sullied the
reputation of the Chairman of the Board, all while allowing the author to profit.


Infitialis should be looking for an attorney of his/her own.


15 Feb 2013, 04:48 PM 


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
So, you think that he/she intentionally included information that turned out to be wrong? Same first name,
middle initial and last name and in Florida, where she used to live seems as I said. The WSJ and NY Times
make mistakes, and they correct them, all the time.


15 Feb 2013, 04:52 PM 


cmcfarling
Alan are you part of the Infitialis "research collective"? An Honest mistake? Ha ha ha ha ha ha, yeah right.
Don't you think that a research collective should actually be good at researching facts? If you're going to bash
someone to that extent you better know what the f you are talking about. I hope Infitialis gets sued over this.

Rolling O Research, Contributor
I'm not an attorney, so I could be wrong about libel, but the author's intention was to make money on his/her
self-professed short position. There may be other grounds for a lawsuit. I just don't know for sure.


The article took great pains to make the case that the company's management was not to be trusted, and
establishing a criminal history for Michelle Sides aided that effort.


The fact that Llamas left the management of MJNA when he was charged with crimes should provide a clue
that something would have been done if Sides had indeed been convicted of a crime, yet she remains as
Chairman.


The fact that the company is based in San Diego should have been a clue that a woman repeatedly arrested
in Florida wasn't the same person.


The author should have checked for anyone named Michelle Sides in Southern CA.


Who is to know whether it was really a mistake, or a misdirection on the part of the author, who hoped that
nobody would catch on?


Finally, writers at the WSJ and NY Times do make mistakes, but it's highly unlikely that they are allowed to
make financial investments, long or short, in the companies they write about.


BTW, as best as I can tell from the posting history on iHub, this article was published online shortly before
9AM EST. I didn't publish my findings about the correct M Sides on iHub until four hours later, and I was the
first to do so.

A dishonest mistake would be not be a mistake. The word honest isn't necessary. It appears to be a mistake.
Dishonesty would be making an accusation with no ground for doing so. In this case, it appears that someone
with the same name and some other similarities was confused. The author quickly changed it. What do you
think, that the author found this person and paid them to get arrested?


No, not part, don't even know how to pronounce "Infitialis" and no clue what it even means. I would never be
part of something that doesn't use a real name, though I understand why some do.


15 Feb 2013, 06:00 PM

Libel is easily defended by proving what you said was true. Simple as that. I'm sure the author would not be
stupid enough to say something that wasn't factually true. If not, the author would already have been sued.

I am an investor in MJNA. Your article, among other things, states that "Ms. Michelle Sides has been kicked out of the
Florida Bar for unspecified reasons."


Where do you have any evidence she was once licenses as an attorney and then had her license revoked? As a
matter of logic, you must be in a place to first be kicked out.


I just called the Florida State Bar and she's still licensed; she is simply suspended until she takes her CLE credits
and/or pays the dues.


I believe a stock holder's derivative action would be brewing against you on behalf of MJNA for false and/or
misleading information.


You have been placed on notice if you do not correct your article.

I've read every word posted of every marijuana-related-stock news story I can find lately. I do believe we are
embarking on a movement toward marijuana legalization; the federal deficits are crippling the economy and the
medicinal benefits are proven and the potential tax revenues are undeniable. There is not anything in history that
anyone alive and posting on seeking alpha can compare the potential of marijuana legalization to.


The risk is that, like the .com bubble, tons of upstart companies with neat sounding products will start to appear, not
end up profiting, and inevitably go bankrupt (but this is still America and we should hope we still have lots of
"dreamers"). That being said, MJNA is certainly a speculative stock, but they do seem to be making products that
would be exciting once legal gray areas aren't in place any longer.


Disclosure: I am long MJNA and also a few other speculative pro-marijuana legalization stocks....however I feel
comfortable enough to call my relatively small investments "playing" and If all of them go bankrupt I promise I won't
write articles encouraging people to short a stock, or not take some chances.


....here are the others I'm in (and I'd appreciate more ideas from anyone) 
CBIS - ( bio-tech experimenting with cannabis related cancer and aids treatments) 
MWIP (proprietary financial services for the medicinal marijuana / health industry) 
PHOT (home growing systems) 
AQNM (air and systems for growing) 
RFMK (selling portable vaporizers)

get in between $.25-$.30 and hold long.

Coming to MJNA i have no problems. I know bought low and sold at .5050. I knew about this stock through
this Alpha. I am a seasoned trader and know about taking long/short positions. This article was repulsive as
the same guy wrote glories about the 3 stocks i mentioned. Anyway why waste time. if people want to invest
they are risking. So why cry. I have make pots of money ( LITERALLY ) on this stock and have no problems. it
is cheap. This and one other pinks sheet stock HEMP are the only ones i have. All the others are known ,
established companies and i will not be writing again. I just made my point , that if the owner of MJNA is a

Fabrication, half truths, and outright lies. A terrorist act in an attempt to create fear in others and most likely profit for
themselves. False accusers deserve the wrath of God.


There is a war out there. I rather be on the side of MJNA a company that is thriving, has asked for an independent
review (when they do not have to), and have been quite transparent.


As far as charges concerning real estate many realtors got caught up in the housing boom, stated income loans,
reverse mortgages, etc. Those selling them were duped just like the buyers. This has nothing to do with MJNA. He
has not been accused of any fraud whatsoever with MJNA. You try to create fear by association, innuendo, and half

I would never in one million years buy a stock as speculative as Medical Marijuana, Inc. However, if marijuana is
legalized in the United States, there will be plenty of profitable companies in the marijuana business. The problem, of
course, will be second hand smoke. Mayor Bloomberg will not want anyone smoking a joint in public places in New
York City because of the second hand smoke. But these restrictions have not hurt the tobacco industry much and
should only be a small annoyance to the marijuana industry.

Intangible Valuation, Contributor
Everyone who thinks Infitialis is a liar is missing an important point that: the company is simply way overvalued. BUT
in addition to that, if it were following the laws other companies have to follow much of what it has done would be
illegal.


It's pretty simple. Why buy an overvalued company? -- Especially one which is owned by someone who is so
suspect?


If, instead, you double down or buy more shares you are effectively doing two things. One, you are psychologically
increasing your commitment to MJNA.PK at the exact moment you ought to be questioning it. And secondly, you are
continuing to believe that this company will **make enough money in the future to make a purchase at today's prices
worth it.**


The intelligent and conservative thing to do is to sell, if you own the shares, and watch.

Let me just point out that when it appears that ANY investment will start doing GREAT in the near future, but
it's not 100% confirmed yet, the value/price of that investment will obviously go up, and it would seem
overvalued based on the present.

You say MJNA is overvalued. Maybe so at current levels, but many investors see the growth potential in this.
Similar to companies such as TSLA, AMZN, FB.

You contrarian assumption implies that the information is priced into the market. In my opinion, the market is
not efficient and also lacks mechanisms for efficiency. Besides, everyone and their dog is a contrarian these
days -- ergo no one is a contrarian.


You can go buy the stock, I just like to perform what I see as my ethical duty to help people over come their
own occasional biases so that they don't loose all their money. I am completely skin-free in this game, but
others are not. Sure, if the company goes up someone can say "you idiot, how come you didn't *invest*?" But
from my point of view, and since I am trained as an accountant, a little hint of fraud is VERY bad. Because,
frankly, if there is no fraud, there is nearly never a hint of fraud. A tiny hint of fraud nearly implies a whole host
of new skeptical attitudes because human nature isn't that rosy. I suggest you take a conservative attitude
stealthology.


Besides, I'd almost rather save someone from an idiotic transaction than commit them to a good long-term
investment. The math suggests that its better to avoid mistakes than to win it big.


One more thing, don't forget there are other fish in the sea.

What exact accusation do you consider a legitimate "fraud" accusation with MJNA? I think the author spent A
LOT of time trying to find any type of evidence which he could try and get people to believe this company is a
fraud. Maybe he even convinced himself the company actually is a fraud. After all, it's his money on the line.


Have you heard of people who manipulate the market and will go to great lengths for financial gain? It
happens often.

Changes in endocannabinoid levels and/or CB2 receptor expressions have been reported in almost all diseases
affecting humans,[34] ranging from cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, neurodegenerative, psychiatric,
bone, skin, autoimmune, lung disorders to pain and cancer. The prevalence of this trend suggests that modulating
CB2 receptor activity by either selective CB2 receptor agonists or inverse agonists/antagonists depending on the
disease and its progression holds unique therapeutic potential for these pathologies [34]


Medical Marijuana prohibition is a crime against humanity and a violation of the religious precept - heal the sick.

Some how he knew the panic was coming. The panic started when this article hit SA. Time to complain to SA and the
SEC about this.

Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
The real issue, and it may be an issue, is disclosure by the author. I have no idea if this is the case here, but
SA is very strict in its rules. If, for instance, the author is being compensated by anyone in any manner, it must
be disclosed. If he just told his buddy he was about to write a negative article and his buddy (Sykes) acted,
then it doesn't violate SA rules, at least by my read. I doubt that would violate SEC rules, but this is an area in
which I am not an expert.


This author has worked with other organizations. When he/she/it blasted CYBX, "Streetsweeper" was
involved. Here is a link to a discussion of the relationship between Infitialis and Streetsweeper:
http://bit.ly/Z5Uv18


Note the specific language: "Editor's Note: TheStreetSweeper is pleased to introduce a brand-new
investigative report by Infitialis under a special arrangement that gives our own readers the chance to see this
groundbreaking research first. We welcome this opportunity."


Are SA rules being broken? I don't know - probably not. I have seen an example of an author who sells early
access to his reports that tend to move a stock. It's an interesting biz model, telling people at which theater
you will be yelling "fire". SA has told me that this is not a violation of any of their rules.

A BONE TO CHEW ON FOR LONG AND SHORTS;


The co. itself is not fraudulent, sounds like just the people running it.


So, chew on this thought, 
1st. 
If fraud is going on, the trading of the stock could be halted, for an undisclosed period of time, =dead$$  
2nd  
money used to start and fund the co.(already documented and disclosed by Mr.lamas), is from fraudulent
realestate practices. Also called illegal gains...which by the way, no matter where or to whom it went, can and
will be confiscated by the DOJ...


The co. would probably go bankrupt if it cant cover the losses sustained by Mr.Lamas fraudulent schemes.
Mr.Lamas seems to be unloading all his stock, as mentioned earlier, for whatever reasons, which I presume
he plans on fleeing the country with.


Long or short, your $$ is in serious danger of leaving you for good.

Even the best companies become overvalued and should be avoided for a time, but the red flags here are just too
obvious. In the best scenario, once some time has passed, one could re-evaluate this company and maybe then take
a shot on it. Too many red flags right now. Just MHO.

Unless the government grants monopolies for growing and distributing marijuana (to their friends), there will be no

Anthony W. Imbimbo


"Independent Auditor"


Not PCAOB Registered (therefore unqualified to independently audit an SEC reporting companies)


Culinary Institute of America trained Chef (with a minor in cooking the books?)


You fail to mention that Mr. Anthony Imbimbo is a CPA, with an Accounting degree from Bridgeport University.
Included on the same page you referenced - were you hoping people just wouldn't read? He also worked at Ernst &
Young and multiple regional firms.


He is not currently registered with the PCAOB, but was registered until 2010 when he withdrew registration - Imbimbo
- PCAOB Registration. Likely withdrew his registration as there is a yearly fee associated with PCAOB membership
and he does not audit any SEC reporting companies.

Quote: 
Ms. Michelle L. Sides - "Chairman" and Chief Operating Officer


According to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Ms. Michelle L. Sides is the Chairman of the Board, Chief Operating
Officer, and also indirectly controls ~ 48% of the Company through her beneficial ownership of Hemp Deposit and
Distribution Corp. In addition, she is purportedly a Member of the Florida State Bar Association and possess
extensive experience in corporate and real estate law. Interestingly, the Florida Bar records for Ms. Michelle Sides
indicate she was previously the "Corporate Counsel" and sole employee for "North American Companies, LLC," the
same entity Mr. Michael Llamas purportedly founded and utilized to execute "in excess of ten billion dollars in
transactions" for distressed debt. However, in reality, Ms. Michelle Sides has been kicked out of the Florida Bar for
unspecified reasons (rendering her not eligible to practice in Florida).


She has not been kicked out of the Florida Bar - she is delinquent in her continuted education (CLER) requirements -
more info here. She is more focused on running a company than keeping current with her continued education
requirements.

Quote: 
More interesting is the fact that on 09/30/12 and 12/02/12, Mr. Michael Llamas and Mr. Michael Corrigan, Esq.
(MJNA's external counsel), respectively, certified that no members of the Company's management team had been
subject to "a conviction in a criminal proceeding or named as a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding in the past
five years" (Appendix C & D). This appears to be a blatant fabrication in regards to Mr. Michael Llamas prior court
records. Moreover, THIS CLEARLY VIOLATES the OTC Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines SECTION 8B.1


Lies again... the filing from 9/30/12 does not include any such statement. The filing from 12/2/2012 states:

5% shareholder, nor counsel is under investigation by any federal, or state regulatory authority for any violation of
federal or state securities laws.


Although it is unfortunate that Llamas is involved in the wire fraud case, that is not a securities case. You do have a
valid point that Llamas signed as president after stepping down, but I would imagine these documents were already
prepared and signed as of 9/17/12 and it was an oversight that Ted Caligiuri needed to sign as President. Michael
LLamas has all but been disassociated with the company since being indicted - the company is now in good hands.

Quote: 
Mr. Theodore Caligiuri - Purportedly Chief Executive Officer


On 09/30/12, Medical Marijuana announced it hired Mr. Theodore Caligiuri as "Interim President and CEO."

publicly traded company, has yet to sign-off on any financial statements, and still works as a residential real estate
agent for Coldwell Banker. In our opinion, he is completely unqualified to...


I apologize, I don't have a Seeking Alpha membership (and won't register if this type of rubbish gets published), so I
will have to stop here: Mr. Ted Caligiuri has served on the MJNA board since early 2011 when MJNA partnered with
Cannabank - source. In the last reference you will find that Mr. Caligiuri has a past as an entrepreneur, including:


Quote: 
A Southern California native, Mr. Caligiuri is an accomplished leader and MJNA shareholder with over 25 years of
business management experience. He is known in the San Diego community not only for his business leadership, but
for his involvement in several charitable organizations including the YMCA. His professional experience includes work
as a management consultant and technology consultant. As a management consultant, he assisted companies in
managing growth and streamlining operations. As a technology consultant, he assisted companies in the identification
and proprietary control of technologies for new products, including the commercialization of NASA developed
technologies. In 1991, he founded an environmental product company targeted at reducing waste by enhancing the
convenience of re-usable shopping bags. In this role, Mr. Caligiuri invented and patented new consumer-focused
shopping bag concepts. In the early 2000's he was the Chief Operating Officer of an ergonomic writing instrument
company and was responsible for doubling sales and filing 6 patents over the course of 2 years. Currently, he works
as a Real Estate Consultant for Coldwell Banker Commercial.


In addition, Mr. Caligiuri has an MBA from California State University, Long Beach. Can we please hear more about
your qualifications before I start taking your word over someone who has found such success as Mr. Caligirui?


Please keep turning those stones... add fuel to the fire for this libel suit.

Not only that, but he wrote about the wrong Michelle Sides which was something that could have easily have been
checked. The author was forced to get rid of that part of the article, and could be facing legal action himself. Whoever
he is. I wonder if he has a criminal record.


The former CEO did resign last year, and has no further influence on MJNA, but the crime he is "accused" of has
nothing to do with MJNA, and he could be cleared of all charges in the future. Nobody knows, but if you look at the
facts there just is not much danger there for MJNA.


Who is the Author??


The people he wrote about are real people, and if there were crimes being committed then these people would be
facing jail time. I doubt they would want to risk that.


Still obviously you need to be careful on ANY investment you make. Be it in a large company, or a small startup like
MJNA.


I just don't think there has ever been an opportunity such as this before. The revenue potential is HUGE and real.
Some companies are going to make Billions$$$ Will MJNA be one of them?? Nobody can say, but consider the
source of the information you read, especially when the author does not even have the courage to post such an article
using his real name.

His whole thesis will go up in flames, right?


It can be frustrating dealing with anonymous authors, long or short. It makes it harder for readers to have
confidence in the author's conclusions. Still, there are many reasons authors maintain anonymity. Usually,
with a little effort, one can get to the identity. If not, one can examine the track record. This "collective" has
published several articles. Review them yourself and judge whether or not they have properly assessed the
situations in their analysis.

The following describes exactly what is happening here with MJNA.


The Short & Distort Scheme


Stage I: Monitoring 
In stage I of a Short & Distort scheme Short groups Monitor spikes in volumes on stocks with no rumors.


Stage 2: Flagging 
Shorts Flag stocks that run up then sits back and wait patiently for their time.


Stage 3: Preparation 
The Shorters research the company and develop their Distortion of the rumors to be used later.


Stage 4: Actual Shorting 
The shorts step in selling on every possible up tick. This is the Reverse of front loading. Preparations are
made to attack the guy who had earlier written positively about the company and take out, discredit, any new
long-term champions or messengers.


Stage 5: Distortion Campaign 
The shorts step in and increase selling on every possible up tick. Just as with the pump, newsletters, e-mail,
PR firms against P & D, etc. are simulated. Expertise in the field is recruited for credibility. Any possible twist
using POS (Purposely Omitted Syntax) and PAS (Purposely Added Syntax) is conveniently used on every
possible angle. If the POS/PAS is discovered then attack the messenger. Above all control the message
boards. 
The group clutters the message boards so no positive information can be readily found. Justification is the
Value of the Company in the market. Projections of $0.00 worth and loss projections of 100% 
Note: The market manipulator will do everything in his/her power to keep buyers OUT OF THE STOCK. Cut
your losses is touted to stimulate fear. You bought higher but now they need you to sell lower.


Stage 6: Pressure 
The shorts have taken it too far. The volume is increasing and the price is not effectively dropping. A
stalemate occurs. Personal attacks increase. Threats of legal action, SEC involvement, and yes even death

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 80/97


threats increase. Increased secret IDs are employed to increase the cluttering, personal attacks and the
distortion. So begins a string of lies that run for as long as one's stomach can take it. Desperately playing on
the "you have been had" scenario. Any new news will be hit it hard by shorters to kill any interest.


Note: Watch the volume not the share price. A market manipulator will have various brokers buying and
selling the stock to give the APPEARANCE of increasing volume but the price goes down. Thus stimulating
the story the company is selling or an off shore reg S or other convenient scenario. Watch for large blocks
that show up but have a MM special code, cross overs, etc.


Stage 7: The Cover 
Without warning the buying pressure is too much and the short begins to cover. Short covering combined with
new investors buying into the stock causes the stock to go up. Often the whole thing starts again. Just a
vicious cycle sometimes. 
______________________... 
Note: Pump & Dump schemes I have seen are investigated by the SEC most of the time, however the Short
& Distort scheme is not apparently high on the SEC's agenda. The shorts, unlike the dumper though, has an
unlimited loss factor should the stock price go up.


Most traders have heard and read of the Pump & Dump scheme. But very little has been written about the
other side of the trade or its opposite, which is the Short & Distort.


Now lets take the Short & Distort scheme and apply it to the rules of Pump & Dump for stock manipulators.


In order to make these market manipulations work, the professionals assume: 
(a) The Public is STUPID and 
(b) The Public will mainly buy at the HIGH and 
(c) The Public will sell at the LOW.


Therefore, as long as the market manipulator can run crowd control, he can be successful in his agenda of
stock manipulation by controlling the market's greed and fear.

Whats with all these new user names with less than 10 comments screaming against shorts, when SA contributors I
recognize and respect agree with the author that something smells funny?


OK longs answer three questions for me all I had when reading the most recent quarterly report:


1.) last quarter, the company booked a $35 million sale, which it said will be received in installment payments of
$4,500,000, but doesn't even specify whether the transaction was with a third party or a related party. Why wouldn't
they disclose more information?


2.) Last quarter, the company raised $2.3 million in financing, presumably by selling its stock to the public. In the
same quarter, total expenses were under $700,000. What do they need this cash for?


3.) Why does the company rely on HDDC, a related party, for working capital, and why does HDDC own over $1
million in MJNA stock? What is to be gained from such byzantine financing arrangements?

We aren't smoking the same stuff! By the way, I am all for legalization of marijuana and wish that there were a
good way to invest. This bull-crap reminds me of early dotcom days, with people investing on concepts
without understanding the "business" (I use that term loosely). In my vision, WFM would be the pot play...


P.S. Question #4 (and no peeking): Within 5mm, specify the fully-diluted share-count

Michael,


I don't think that those who say they own the stock and are so angry at anyone saying to sell it has any idea
at all about what you are even talking about or have any idea about the financials of the company. 
I doubt they know what a quarterly report is. 
Their investment philosophy is based on hope. 
Go figure.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 83/97


I understand that you may have a short position, but if you spend some time on DD you'll see a fairly clear
picture that this is a legit company on the cusp of some phenominal growth.


They basically own the edible market in Colorado, and they're looking to expand to many other states this
year with their Dixie Elixir brand. We may get a taste of that with their 2013 & 2014 projections which will be
released before market open on Tuesday. Colorado will also begin opening "lounges" beginning in early 2014
where anyone can walk in and purchase edibles without a prescription.


I'm not saying I can predict the future here (like so many posters here claim to be able to do), but in my mind
there is a very likely scenario that MJNA reports some positive guidance figures which bring the stock up on
Tuesday.

Chill. I'm just trying to get a feel for what he's thinking. I do respect Ashraf, he writes a hell of a lot on tech
companies which I follow, and I respect him for the thoroughness of his articles. I don't agree with everything
he writes, but who does.


Most OTC stocks who have charts which look like MJNA are likely pump and dumps. Does that instantly
mean MJNA is one? People like me who have skin in the game, have actually done quite a bit of research
into these "scheming allegations" in this article, and maybe if you did the same, you'd have a better picture of
what this company is all about.

Ashraf- I'm really eagerly waiting to see if your short bets against ARMH come to fruition. I have no skin in
that. I do have a hell of a lot of Nokia stock from their lows and Tesla.


17 Feb 2013, 11:19 PM 


Ashraf Eassa, Contributor
steathology,


Appreciate the kind words (and those from Alan as well), and I am glad that even though we disagree on
MJNA that we can have a civilized discussion of what's going on, and that there is mutual respect going on
here.


I hope I'm wrong. I really, really hope I'm wrong because I feel like I've seen this before and, unfortunately, it
leads to a lot of bag holders and folks who swear off the stock market forever, claiming it's like gambling, etc.


That being said, I believe that there is a lot of good detective work in this article and I would be very, very
hesitant to trust management. My "gut feeling" is that management has somehow managed to orchestrate a
pump & dump by announcing that they will be giving 2014 guidance. They are, unfortunately, probably selling
into the pre-guidance hype, and I don't expect this stock to be trading above $0.10 by the end of the week.


Then again, I don't have a crystal ball and can't make any claims with any real surety, but this is a very
common pattern.


Best of luck to you, stealthology, and I hope that you end up walking away from this with profit in hand.

Now with all the SA blogs by disclosed short position holders the company is working with its attorneys to

DC Capital, Contributor
Excellent article. I have swing traded in an out of MJNA on momentum for short-term profits, on multiple ocasions. But
I agree with you. MJNA is merely a scheme waiting to be exposed (which you seem to have done and excellent job
depicting) and horribly managed company.


17 Feb 2013, 04:53 PM 


stealthology
Hey Derek,


Do you care to elaborate on why exactly you believe MJNA to be a scheme waiting to be exposed and a
horribly managed company?


They own the Colorado edibles market, and Colorado has over 100,000 medical marijuana patients to date,
and growing rapidly. Colorado has also fully legalized the drug, but they won't be opening up these lounges
until early 2014. They will obviously make more money once it is fully legalized in the state, and they are also
currently working on some franchising deals to expand outside of Colorado. After all, Colorado is just one
state out of 17 where it is medically legal.

17 Feb 2013, 07:44 PM 


DC Capital, Contributor
In the long-run, the company will not win. I don't really care about the legitimacy of MJNA and to my
knowlegde it seems nothing more than a traditional pump and dump penny stock. Of course, it was a great
short-term swing for me to take a long position in. But I would never take a short position in a penny stock.
Thats pure exposure to unlimited losses and completly against my investment framework. To further address
your question, sure they may appear to be legit and actually have a website, fixed assets, and a few other
things to simply enable them to be traded over the pink sheet. Anyone with a decent level of intellegence can
create a scheme as such. But where are the ethics? Ethics are important and are not everywhere they should
be in the financial industry. This article is excellent and completly illustrates anything I need to know about the
firm.


As Alan previously brought up, I also would love to find a way to invest in the legalization of marijuana and I
am in support for it as well, however we are far away from this happening in the short-run. Regulation and
legislation aside, basic economic principles will prevent this. Theres that huge barrier to entry know as the
black market. Unfortunately, there will always be an illicit trade for marijuana and the conflicting laws between
states and the federal government do not help the situation. The combination of these factors will continue to
have a major impact on any future investments in the marijuana industry.

Do I need to re-iterate again that Dixie Elixirs has control of the Colorado edibles market? Do you understand
that they have real products and sales? Did you not see the 60 minutes special back last October? They had
record gross revenues in 4Q12 of 5.2 million.


You really don't think the medical and legal marijuana market will not grow in the near future?


The author of this article did a lame job at trying to convince the naive/dumb that this company is simply a
scam.


17 Feb 2013, 09:02 PM 


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
How many shares are there? That way, we can value the company. Let me point you to a real company with
real products that is also a penny stock (until their gazillion to one reverse split): MSLP


Musclepharm has celebrity endorsements - does Dixie? Just kidding. The serious part, though, is that
"products" don't equal "good investment". I am naive/dumb, so clue me in. When you say "control", does that
mean that CO has given them a perpetual license?


17 Feb 2013, 09:06 PM 


stealthology
When I say control, I mean they are the leading provider of edible products in Colorado. Why are you bringing
up some random company which has nothing to do with medical marijuana? All you really have to do is call
up some clinics in Colorado.


By the way, I'm really sorry that MJNA doesn't have celebrity endorsements. I guess that's another "red flag"
for this company which the author could have included in his piece.


Everything MJNA is doing is legal.


17 Feb 2013, 11:08 PM 


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
MSLP did something like $100mm in sales on a supplement and the stock almost went bankrupt. Their stuff is
apparently loved and it's distributed in Costco, for instance. I don't know how old you are, but maybe you
weren't around in the 90s, when dotcoms commanded huge valuations for nothing but catchy domain names.


That this company trades at more than $50mm stuns me...

17 Feb 2013, 09:10 PM 


Heliosis
I have to discredit this article based on errors I saw along with TERRIBLE researching. The research was clearly the
first thing that popped up on Google that even represented Fraud.


I originally saw the section about Michelle Sides. Any author of a publication, regardless of topic, that talks about a
person who has nothing to do with the company, is bad press. Even if they have the same name, live in same state.
That was bad researching. That just tells me right there that the "anonymous" author was searching through names to
find biased information to make the company look bad. Sure, you may have edited the article, but I can't take this as
credible. Google Michelle Sides, the first image is what this author put up.


Another point is attacking the accounting firm that audited their finances. In that case, any company that has been
audited by Big 4, should be not trusted. I say that because if I am going to bash a company based on their accounting
firm (and MJNA was audited by a firm with 25+ years experience), then good luck wanting to invest in ANY company.
Even the Big 4 has had scandals.


Another point is failure to mention Tripp Keber. He's a HUGE player in this company. I see nothing about him?


This article concentrates on Michael Llamas. He's not even CEO or has had any major influence on this company
since mid-September. Google - Michael Llamas, the author copied the first image and made a poorly constructed
photo with FRAUDSTER on it.


Ted Caligiuri - That section was the weakest of this article. It is clear that the author did a Google search on this guy
and picked up the first bit of information that came up. It actually hurt to read this.

This was a poorly hashed article. The response from the author was that there is a lot more scams from this company.
In other words, he's telling us he is waiting for MJNA to release more information so he can Google search and
copy/paste the first thing he sees. Come on, this was a high school written research report.

How many shares are outstanding? Was this part misstated?


17 Feb 2013, 09:34 PM

How do shares outstanding matter except when figuring out the market cap of the company. At last report
there were 808 million shares outstanding. Not sure why people think that with a high number of shares
outstanding is a bad thing. Apple has more shares outstanding, of course they are bit higher prices too. LOL


Do your own DD, but MJNA is a legitimate company and will soon be uplisted to a better exchange. Escape
from the pink sheets!


18 Feb 2013, 04:30 AM 


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
$300mm for a company with such a limited history, no real data available, etc? Forget all of the allegations in
this article. Doesn't it make you think that someone is smoking something?


18 Feb 2013, 06:41 AM 


Heliosis
What are you trying to get at by responding to my comment with shares outstanding?


There's plenty of stocks out there where market cap exceeds the current value of the company. A lot of stocks
trade based on future value potential of the company.


A lot of people are betting this company is the next big thing (which MMJ in general has HUGE market
potential). $300m is what any MMJ company can achieve in just one state, assuming recreational use like
Washington/Colorado.

that makes them want it even more, basic psychology. Ending the war on drugs would help stimulate our

MJNA is a pump share selling company like %90 of penny stocks. Play them right and you make money, either long
or short. Hope for a fantasy that it will go up beyond your wildest dream and make you rich, is a fools play. The OTC
is not meant for investments, its meant to trade.


18 Feb 2013, 03:16 AM

I think that shorting stock on present exchange is not interesting for big investors as there are only limited amount of
shares available for shorting. Please check that fact. The point behind is that team of pumpers which caused first drop
to 0.25 after dumped their shares wants again cheap buy. They did it and they are already in. Are you aware that 70
mil of shares exchanged hands in one day? Do you think that people who bought such amount of shares are stupid?
Regarding criminal record of company managers, do you think that that fact is strange for company operating at MJ
market. Some people say that Soros is number 1 enemy of state, for me greatest investor with a vision for future. Any
way all written was known before article so people surprised seeing that did not do their homework. Regarding traders
which had fingers burnt, that happens some time with penny stocks, big money winners and a number of small poor
traders which throwing tea leafs (looking at charts on penny stock?!). If you are investor seeking large profit (not
penny trader) which had weighted new market opportunity, market potential, political and historical situation and
willing to invest for a period of 3-5 years than this is not surprise but ideal entry point. At the end, however this finish is
going to be remembered. Wish you all good investing and large profits!

Look at Michael Llamas signatures in the first two documents provided by the author. First, the signatures aren't even
remotely similar. Second, the signatures aren't even legible. Look like the author scribbled the name on the line and
than scanned it to make it look like an official document.


I would also like to point out how this article has now received over 330 comments. The author's highest number of
comment on any other article was 46. I looked into the other companies the author shorted and they all sounded like
terrible business to begin with. Not to mention than after the author post the article's move than half of the stocks
rebounded 50% for the low.


If your an investor in MJNA, you should hold your shares until we get confirmed proof. Scam or now scam the
marijuana industry will be a critical part of our economy in the next 10 years.

(Please go to Yahoo.com, click on "Finance" that located on your right, you will see "Quote", Key in RFMK and you
will see its news.


RFMK is now "OTC pink current information" and it will be OFF the pink 
for good when it files 10-K. (Please read  
news dated Dec 27, 12 in yahoo after you keyed in RFMK) 
As soon as it's off the Pink, RFMK will explode very high and you want to buy Before its share price goes higher 
(Remember that ALL marijuana stocks are OTC, not just RFMK)


RFMK hit 0.0045 on 2/13/2013 and then pull back. 
It will get to 0.0045 again this week (2/19 to 2/22/2013) and RFMK's share 
price will get through 0.0045 (higher than 0.0045, so you will KEEP 
it, don't sell, don't be afraid) 
As soon as it goes through its resistance .0045, it will get to 0.0081, then 0.023 soon. 
RFMK's next resistance will be 0.05 (Keep it, don't sell, don't be afraid), when it gets through (higher than 0.05) 0.05,
its next share price will be 0.10, then 0.12 , then 0.27 (twenty seven cents) 
(it gets to 0.27 when MJNA gets above 0.665) 
(Note: MJNA = 0.665 is caculated from Fibonnaci number  
(1.33 x 0.50 (highest price of MJNA is 0.50) = 0.665. 
I forgot how to spell the word Fibonnace, I used 1.33 for ease of calculation)


Remember that 0.27 is RFMK's major resistance. SO, hold on tight 
before it hits 0.36 (It his 0.36 when MJNA gets above 0.70). 
Note: RFMK and MJNA are in the same marijuana sector, they both 
goes up or down together. RFMK share price will get to above 0.57 
whenever MJNA gets to above 0.90.

Still waiting to see a link to verify that HDDC information in the article. I think that is completely false or dated
information and should be removed from the article.

scary. Hopefully it doesnt collapse tomorrow cause Im jumping the hell out. I mean, come on, their "medical director"
is a dentist? their auditor is a cook? their CEO has been charged with fraud SEVERAL times? im getting the hell out.
You guys can say what you want, but this is unacceptable. IF a company's director had been charged with marijuana
crimes, i would see it differently, as it actually had something to do with the industry, but this is just blatantly wrong. So
happy I got in @ .04 and not .40... It feels unethical though when i take profits.

You know what this looks like to me? This is the same date that a 6000% rise in short interest was reported... That is
an increase of 2.6 shares in short interest. That with all the holes in this story I am absolutely convinced that the
author is a fraud.


Date | Short Interest |% Change |Avg. Daily Share Volume|Days to Cover| Split| New Issue 
Feb 15, 2013 2,724,938 6,241.19 38,505,725 1.00 No No

He disclosed that he was short, so the fact that you can size him now shouldn't add to or subtract from the argument.
What did he say that you think isn't true (besides the wrong Sides)? It seems like no one has addressed the issues
raised. How did Llamas sign off on the financials after he was gone?

Interesting article...but I have reservations about dismissing this stock as a potential gamble outright. As a small time
investor just trying to have fun with a couple hundred dollars I don't have any *serious* risk headed into any stock, but
MJNA shows promise if it is indeed legitimate as the company and other commenters claim. The shares seem to have
become relatively flatlined around $0.30, however falling gradually.


Not really sure what to do at this point, no other penny stock industries seem to have nearly as much potential as
cannabis. However, gauging the correct entry point is extremely difficult since many marijuana stocks are either
bleeding cash (like PHOT), or seeing what appears to be a gradual deflation is price (like MJNA).


What I sincerely hope is that tobacco companies don't smother out these smaller, innovative firms. They're dinosaurs
who have already done more than their fair share for peoples' health (yes, that was supposed to be sarcastic).

In the link you provided where you say she is disbarred, it states she is "in good standing" and "eligible to practice in
Florida."


Can you explain why you made a statement to the opposite effect while providing evidence that further proves the
opposite of what you're claiming?

You may want to check your "double checking" of sources. I think it can be argued that you knew you wrong wrong
and purposely committed LIBEL. I think you might get to know the word LIBEL and the legal definition in court some
day, IMO.

Long PennyStocks
Does anybody know how did the story ended for Mr. Llamas? Did the SEC investigated any of the author's claims?
The stock seems to have plenty of support at around $0.30. It's been days now of the article and the stock is only
trading roughly -10% of the date of the original article. Is this herd mentality? Is this mad/blind love with the industry
and/or with the business model of this company? Or is it a "platonic love" with the company's chosen name "Medical
Marijuana Inc." in the middle of the so called "Green Rush" (clearly associated with Medical Marijuana)? I just throw
the question out there. I simply want to learn what other folks think is going behind the scene here. In another context,
such an article of an OTC company would have been the equivalent of playing pogo-stick with an atomic bomb. In
other words, total annihilation!
