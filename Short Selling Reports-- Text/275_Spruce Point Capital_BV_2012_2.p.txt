Bazaarvoice Is Screaming To Be Sold

Introduction


In our first article entitled "Bazaarvoice's Valuation is Utterly Bizarre" we detailed our
concerns that the shares of Bazaarvoice (Nasdaq: BV) had become significantly
overvalued in the face of rising competition from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) and
Demand Media (DMD). Moreover, we illustrated that BV has a struggling financial model
with years of projected losses, and that the expensive new acquisition of PowerReviews
posed significant integration risks. We also detailed that management was already making
plans to sell their shares, and that both BV and PowerReviews's lock-up expirations would
put significant pressure on the share price.


Therefore, it came as no surprise when late last week the company filed an S-1 for the
sale of 8.5 million shares. The share sale is comprised of 1.7 million shares issued by the
company and 6.8 million shares by existing investors. A closer look into the transaction
reveals numerous concerns with the PowerReviews acquisition.


S-1 Insights Confirming PowerReviews a Bad Deal


The S-1 filing offers new insights into BV's acquisition of PowerReviews, which closed
recently on June 12th and cost shareholders a staggering $169 million, or 14.6x LTM
revenues. This figure included $39.2 million of cash, 6.4 million BV shares, and the
assumption of 1.7 million options. What exactly did BV shareholders get for this costly
transaction, what is the financial profile of PowerReviews, and what should BV
shareholders' expect going forward?

According to BV, the deal added approximately 300 network clients, approximately 800
express clients and 81 new employees to their business. They believe that the acquisition
will establish them with small and medium-size businesses and further expand the reach
and value of their network. They also claim to expect significant cost synergies by
combining the operations of PowerReviews with their own.


On the surface, this story sounds nice, but a closer look at the numbers paints a different
picture. To illustrate, the 1,100 customers of PowerReviews only generated $11.9 million
of revenue in the LTM 3/31/12 period. On a per client basis, this equates to a paltry
$10,400 per customer. On the other hand, BV's average revenue per client is
approximately $144,000. For BV to extract any value from this acquisition, they are going
to have to convince the PowerReviews customers to spend significantly more money for a
higher service. Yet, since there are essentially only two companies in the industry that
provide this service, it's likely the case that PowerReviews attracted its customers
precisely because they offered a lower price point solution. The notion that they will now
want to spend more money for BV's services is an overly optimistic assumption.


BV warns exactly about this issue in the S-1:

Customers of Bazaarvoice and PowerReviews may not continue to use Bazaarvoice
or PowerReviews to the same extent as they would have if PowerReviews had
remained an independent company, or they may cancel existing agreements.


Furthermore, the assertion that BV will extract cost synergies by combining operations will
also be challenging. According to the pro forma financial statements filed in the S-1 and
illustrated below, PowerReviews is losing significant amounts of money in its business, at
even a faster rate than BV. The company will have to eliminate a minimum of $5 million of
expenses to even come close to achieving an EBITDA neutral position on a pro forma
basis. Yet, this seems unlikely because BV admits elsewhere in the S-1 the following:


Expenses associated with the purchase of PowerReviews and the integration of
PowerReviews' customers, employees and operations into our business could
further delay our profitability. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase
substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business
and acquire clients, develop our platform and develop new products and solutions.


For example, the company noted that they have recently initiated a search for a senior
executive to join their management team as a president and have undertaken a plan to
upgrade and expand their sales organization. The board also gave a generous raise to
senior executives and a nice cash bonus plan tied to sales, EBITDA and bookings.
Shareholders would be better rewarded if the bonuses were tied to cash flow
enhancement.

Adding insult to injury, BV quietly disclosed in the S-1 a very material piece of information
that the company is under investigation by the Department of Justice.


According to the disclosure:


After the completion of our acquisition of PowerReviews, the Department of Justice,
Antitrust Division, or DOJ, notified us that it has opened a preliminary investigation to
determine whether the acquisition violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.
Section 18. The DOJ's investigation could be lengthy, and we may be required to
produce documents and data and offer to the DOJ other written and oral testimony,
which could result in material legal fees and associated costs and require
considerable time and attention of our management. Further, if the DOJ determines
our acquisition of PowerReviews violates the Section 7 of the Clayton Act, we could
be required to divest part, or all, of PowerReview's operations and assets. As a
result, this investigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results and could materially impact our business strategy going forward.

Given that BV believes they are a monopoly in their industry, it is surprising they didn't
take the necessary steps to clear this issue prior to announcing the deal. It could prove to
be a very costly mistake, and as the company suggests, may have a material effect on
cash costs.


From a balance sheet perspective, the preliminary purchase price indicates a substantial
allocation to goodwill for the transaction at $114 million. Including indentifiable intangible
asset of another $40 million, a total of 97% of the total assets are goodwill and intangibles.
The intangible estimate only includes $5.4 million and $33.9 million for developed
technology and customer relationships, respectively. Clearly, the success of this deal
depends heavily on BV's ability to harness PowerReviews customer relationships to drive
value creation.


Overall, the deal puts a material strain on the financial profile of the company absent
significant revenue growth. The costs are set to rise from further internal investment,
increases in wages, and legal costs associated with the DOJ investigation. The bottom
line result for shareholders appears to dilute earnings potential as well from the added
share dilution.


Conclusion

At today's share price of $18.00 investors continue to price in a substantial premium to
BV's future. The additional information provided in the S-1 about the acquisition of
PowerReviews still does not provide greater clarity into the future of the combined
company. The PowerReviews deal came at a significant cost to BV shareholders of 14.6x
revenues. Absent a significant synergies from acquiring this business, each $1 of
additional revenue will result in $1.20 in additional losses. The notion that the combined
companies will create significant revenue synergies is not guaranteed given the
company's different client segments and vastly different revenue per client profile.


Furthermore, cost synergies do not appear to be significant enough in the near term to be
accretive to the company's earnings. In fact, costs are anticipated to grow over the course
of the integration. In light of the recently disclosed DOJ investigation, there is a very
material risk of added legal costs to justify the transactions. The consequences of
terminating the transactions could also put a significant dent in the company's future
growth trajectory. BV's valuation is still at a significant premium to marketing and digital
service peers, and a healthy premium to other social media stocks. As a result of all these
concerns, the risk / reward of owning BV's shares appear slanted toward the downside,
particularly as insider selling is poised to vastly increase the float of shares on the market.


We reiterate our belief that BV's shares are more appropriately valued in the $5 range. We
arrive at this $5 target using a 2x revenue multiple, which is closer aligned to digital and
marketing service trading multiples, and also comparable with other social media
businesses that have struggled to achieve positive EBITDA such as Groupon
(NASDAQ:GRPN) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA).


Disclosure: I am short BV.

It is absolutely unbelievable that this company is valued where it is, given the nature of the social media space and
the trouble its been in of late. Thanks for the piece.
