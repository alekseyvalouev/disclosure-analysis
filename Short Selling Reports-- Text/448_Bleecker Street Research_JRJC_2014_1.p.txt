China Finance Online: Shares Soar On Over-Hyped Deal, More
Questions Than Answers
Aug. 20, 2014 8:45 AM ET39 comments

Summary


JRJC recently had an announcement that sent shares soaring.


JRJC claims to be the first web-based security, however, Tencent has beat JRJC to
the punch.


JRJC's conference call was light on details about the platform, and management
was unable to answer basic questions.


China Finance Online's (NASDAQ:JRJC) stock soared on Monday on the news that it was
launching China's first "Integrated, Web-Based Securities Trading Service Platform." The
product is the result of a strategic partnership with CITIC Securities, the largest brokerage
firm in China. The press release, combined with the rapid appreciation in the stock price
caused me to look a little bit deeper.


JRJC was incorporated in Hong Kong in November 1998. In April 2001, JRJC launched its
online financial and listed company data and information services. In April 2000, JRJC
acquired www.jrj.com. In October 2004, JRJC went public and listed its ADSs on the
Nasdaq. In 2006, JRJC acquired www.stockstar.com. In 2006, JRJC also acquired CFO
Genius, which is a financial information database. The rest of its corporate history from the
20-F:

In 2007, we acquired Daily Growth Securities Limited, (renamed iSTAR International
Securities Co. Limited by February 2013), a licensed securities brokerage firm
incorporated in Hong Kong, and therefore established our business outside
mainland China. We currently hold 85% of the equity interests of iSTAR Securities
(formerly named Daily Growth Securities), iSTAR Futures (formerly named Daily
Growth Futures), iSTAR Wealth Management (formerly named Daily Growth Wealth
Management), and iSTAR Investment Services Co. Limited (formerly named Daily
Growth Investment Services Limited), or iSTAR Investment Services, all of which are
companies incorporated in Hong Kong and held indirectly by iSTAR Financial
Holdings Limited (formerly named Daily Growth Financial Holdings Limited). We
intend that all the equity interests held or to be held by CFO Hong Kong in a financial
service related business will be integrated into iSTAR Financial Holdings Limited,
thereby making iSTAR Financial Holdings Limited our platform to develop financial
service related business outside mainland China. On February 10, 2012, we
incorporated another Hong Kong subsidiary under iSTAR Financial Holdings Limited,
Daily Growth Credit Limited, which was renamed iSTAR International Credit Co.
Limited by January 2013.


Where Is Revenue Coming From?


In response to a downturn in Chinese equity markets, JRJC has been diversifying its
revenue sources. Again, from the 20-F:
5/18/2018 China Finance Online: Shares Soar On Over-Hyped Deal, More Questions Than Answers - China Finance Online Co. Limited (NASDAQ:…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2437885-china-finance-online-shares-soar-on-over-hyped-deal-more-questions-than-answers 3/15


In 2013, in order to address the market demand for alternative investment
opportunities, the Company established Zhengjin Fujian, Zhengjin Tianjin and
acquired Henghui to help clients invest and trade precious metals. As a PRC-affiliate
of the Company, Zhengjin Fujian is a member of the SAIC (State Administration for
Industry and Commerce)-approved Haixi, while Zhengjin Tianjin and Henghui are
members of TJPME. Our precious metals trading affiliates' intended scopes of
business include precious metals spot trading, silver product sales and financial
investment advisory services. Currently, they are focused on online silver trading on
Haixi and TJPME on behalf of their clients.


We earn commission income from our clients' trading. In addition, we act as one of
the market makers in Haixi and TJPME. As a market maker, we commit to accept all
the trade executions by offering to buy or sell trading products from/to our clients. As
a result, we also recognize trading gains/losses in our net revenues. In 2013, our net
revenues derived from precious metal trading business represented approximately
57% of our total net revenues.


In 2012, JRJC did not derive any revenues from precious metals trading. In 2013, JRJC
derived 57% of its revenue from precious metals trading. Despite this tremendous shift in
business, the gross margins actually increased by 7%, from 73% to 80%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2437885-china-finance-online-shares-soar-on-over-hyped-deal-more-questions-than-answers 4/15


So why are these margins almost unbelievable? Well, precious metals trading is an
incredibly low-margin business. Compare this to another publicly traded company that
does only does precious metals trading, AMRK, and one sees an interesting picture.


Given that precious metals trading is such a low-margin business, it is remarkable that
JRJC managed to actually increase its margins, when 57% of revenue came from a
segment that it previously did not have and has generally low margins.


Websites - Different Name, But Same Content


According to the 20-F, the two websites (jrc.com and stockstar.com) have the same
content, but different names:


We acquired the financial information website jrj.com.cn in April 2000 and the
domain name jrj.com in October 2004, and commenced operating our subscription-
based financial information business in March 2005. We maintain the same content
under both domain names.


This makes sense, as it keeps the cost of creating content down. However, if the content
was the same, it would also be logical that the users are getting to the websites in a
similar manner. According to Alexa, however, the keywords that are driving users to each
site are radically different.


Using information from Alexa.com, these are the main search keywords which drive traffic
to each site, translated into English.

While jrj.com has keywords that seem reasonable for a finance site, stockstar.com
certainly does not.


JRJC's Material Weakness


In its most recent 20-F, JRJC mentioned it had a material weakness in its internal control
in financial reporting. The 20-F reads:


We had a material weakness in our internal control in financial reporting for the year
ended December 31, 2013, which could result in our financial statements not being
prepared properly. Our management identified a material weakness and concluded
that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December
31, 2013. A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard
No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. The Company's management determined that the
Company's oversight of complex transactions is not effective. Specifically,
management lacks the expertise to evaluate the accounting requirement of certain
non-routine and complex transactions. From time to time the Company will
encounter non-routine accounting transactions that require a high level of technical
accounting expertise. Non-routine accounting transactions will likely increase in
frequency as the Company continues to grow and expand its operations.


A material weakness makes it a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. In the event that the material weakness described above
led to our financial statements not being prepared properly (which we currently do
not believe to be the case), we would be required to restate our financial statements,
which could result in a decline in our stock price

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2437885-china-finance-online-shares-soar-on-over-hyped-deal-more-questions-than-answers 6/15


Alone, this is not necessarily a red flag, although given the company's seemingly
remarkable margins, it is a risk that investors should consider.


Which brings me to my last and final point. The stock is up 85% in the last 5 days. Just
three months ago, JRJC was a $3 stock. Now, it's an $8 stock with a $175 million market
cap. Why has it gone up so much? This press release:


China Finance Online Co. Limited ("China Finance Online", or the "Company")
(NASDAQ GS: JRJC), a leading web-based financial services company that
provides Chinese retail investors online access to stocks, commodities and wealth
management products, today announced that it has launched China's first
independent web-based securities trading platform, "Zhengquantong ("Securities
Master")", on the leading financial portals it operates, www.jrj.com and
www.stockstar.com. Securities Master is the product of a new strategic partnership
China Finance Online has entered into with the largest brokerage firm in China,
CITIC Securities Co., Ltd. (SHA: 600030) ("CITIC"), to seamlessly integrate China
Finance Online's state-of-the-art, web-based architecture with CITIC's robust trading
and settlement system.


While JRJC may want to claim that it has the first web-based securities trading platform,
that is simply not the case. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) has beat it to the punch. From an
article on February 21st:


Tencent (0700) has partnered with a mainland brokerage firm to launch an online
stock trading service with the mainland's lowest commission fee, even as China's
central bank warned on the risks of internet finance. The new trading service
appeared on the websites of both Tencent and the Shanghai-listed broker Sinolink
Securities yesterday.


JRJC hosted a conference call on Tuesday morning to address this development; what
was unfortunate was just how light on details it was. While there is no transcript of it, one
can listen to a recording of it by calling +1-855-452-5696 and using the conference ID
#89855480. What was particularly troublesome was that JRJC was unable to give any
guidance on how this deal would affect its guidance, and when asked about the
commissions for the venture, management was unable to provide an answer, instead
saying that this call was only to address the platform.

Comments (39)


When Tencent announced the deal, it was able to immediately disclose the commissions
on the platform.


Users can register for the new account or apply for transfer from other brokers for a
commission fee of 0.02 percent and are offered a consultant service worth 6,888
yuan (HK$8,780) a year, according to the website. Huatai Securities announced a
commission of 0.03 percent for online users last month. Most brokerages now
charge 0.08 percent commission.


JRJC has been hyped up immensely by this deal. I am not suggesting that JRJC is
worthless, but rather that the stock is over-hyped right now surrounding this deal.
Combine that with the lack of clarity provided on the conference call, and you have a
recipe for a sharp pullback.


Note: I am long puts on JRJC. I have contacted management with several of my
questions, but have not received a response. The information presented above is correct
to the best of my knowledge; however, if there are any errors, I will correct them
immediately.

Ben Gee: Reaching for the sky? Breaking modern day highs? Hardly. I was exchanging at a rate of 6.33:1 last
year. In any event, the minor (very minor) increase in the RMB is not an explanation for an 85% increase in
this stock.

6.14 Yuans per $ is higher than 6.33 Yuan per $ by 3%. At 6.33, the Yuan is worth 15.8 cents and at 6.14, the
Yuan is worth 16.3 cents.

BenGee: hehehe...I'm so used to seeing it from the $/RMB exchange viewpoint that I ended up misreading
your post. Very true, I'm getting fewer RMB now than I was last year. Having said that, it's still no reason for
the stock price increase. The RMB has been in the 6.06 to 6.15 range for a considerably longer time than it
took for the stock to rise. A 3% increase in yuan strength doesn't equate to an 85% price rise.

good article- i know the company in detail and its been home run. 
Some points people leave out is CEO has bought about 20million of the stock from USA venture capital investors.
The CFO is very good and was educated in USA. 
However, the company is EXTREMELY conservative with transparency, forecasting which I think limits the upside on
the stock for the next 6 months. Finally, I still think they lose money when earnings are released shortly as the
continue to spend money on their infrastructure. thx

300% growth is still pretty good. I was impressed that revenues for financial services and ads both grew>
double digits! So, you have the fabulous growth on precious metals, along with very solid growth in the other
revenue streams (a turn around). BTW, precious metals are a pretty hot commodity in China! Now, we have
the move to become the AMTD of China. JRJC is interesting, and Bleeker has a big incentive to make money
off of his puts, so I will keep reading!

away. I'm patient.


20 Aug 2014, 04:11 PM


Humble Eagles
Bleeker, are you not doing exactly what you accuse so many others of doing: not including information about
your losses to deceive onlookers? Didn't you see that I clicked on your article entitled, "3 Stocks to Short
Now" from early '13? Your three picks for shorting on 3/1/13 were BBY, PBI, and OFC, yet I can't find BBY or
PBI on your list there. If JRJC only listed revenues and they didn't list expenses you would cry foul, no? Tell
us how your call for shorting BBY, PBI, and OFC worked out?


20 Aug 2014, 04:23 PM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Notice how I said "articles focussing on one stock only, that is how others on this site have
calculated performance numbers. To answer your question though, here are the returns from my two articles
on three stocks to short in 2013. The stocks covered were: BBRY (then RIMM), PNRA, HGG, PBI, OFC, and
BBY.  
BBRY, Down 42% 
PNRA, Down 6%

As I said in the previous comment I was only counting articles that were short calls on one stock. That being
said, you should not judge JRJC based on four calls that didn't work, just like you should not judge it based on
30 calls that were correct.

Bleecker, I wouldn't do that. As I said, mindguy challenged me and PBI, BBY, and OFC were the three
recommendations in the article I happened to click on, unlucky--I wasn't saying your were incompetent. We've
wasted enough time discussing your results. Thx for the article; I will certainly keep it in mind!

Income from commisison vs. profit from trading is different.


20 Aug 2014, 12:08 PM


Lambda Research, Contributor
It is very important to understand where revenues from the trading business comes from. In their latest 20-F, notes
under revenue recognition stated,


"During the year of 2013, the Group totally recognized revenue amount to $30,124,245 from precious metal trading
business, consisted of commodity trading gain of $18,537,459, commission income of $10,953,632 and carrying
charges of $633,154, respectively."


They also explain trading gains as defined by : 
"Trading gains, net also include activities where the Group acts as principal in the purchase and sale of commodities
derivative instruments with customers. Trading gains, net also include activities where the Group acts as principal in
the purchase and sale of individual securities, currencies, commodities or derivative instruments with customers.
These transactions may be offset simultaneously with another customer or counterparty, offset with similar but not
identical positions on an exchange, made from inventory, or may be aggregated with other purchases to provide
liquidity intraday, for a number of days, or in some cases, particularly the precious metals business, even longer
periods (during which fair value may fluctuate). Therefore, trading gains, net includes activities from the Group's
operations of a proprietary commodity trades (see additional discussion in the Financial Instruments and Derivatives
policy note for revenue recognition on proprietary trading activities). Net dealer investment gains are recognized on a
trade-date basis and include realized gains or losses and changes in unrealized gains or losses on investments at fair
value."


I requested clarification from management so they can explain what trading gains are, but no reply yet. If they are
proprietary gains, then I would question the sustainability of the precious metals segment and consider it as a red flag.

to jrj.com.cn (this would not have been the case prior to 2004). That's what they were talking about.


From simply looking at stockstar.com (using Google translate if necessary), you can see that the content on
that site is different.


Also: they never claimed to be the first web-based securities platform in China. They claimed to be the first
integrated web-based securities platform in China.


Reading comprehension ftw.

jrj.com and stockstar.com are two different websites.


As a Chinese investor, I have to say this kind of "Security master" is not so really important for Chinese
mainland investor because they already have some powerful tools to investors, even though it still seems too
weak compared to tradingview and stockcharts.


This stock is definitely manipulated by some aggressive investors in unknown places. Be cautious bros.

The actual text of the PR: "launched China's first **independent** web-based securities trading platform".
There are 117 stockbrokers in the country of China. Do any of these NOT have web-based trading platforms?
What is "independent" supposed to mean?

Independent, in this case I think means not owned/controlled by the gov't. I don't think any other brokers have
online platforms, certainly not with real-time stock information, and nothing remotely comparable to JRJC. If
you have found anything to suggest otherwise, then by all means, enlighten us.

Deepfryer: "Also: they never claimed to be the first web-based securities platform in China. They claimed to be the
first integrated web-based securities platform in China."


Pardon my ignorance/lack of understanding in the matter, what's the key difference exactly? It appears both have
partnered with brokerage firms and that on both people can trade stocks over the internet? Sorry again, thanks for
clarifying in advance.


Also, I am trying to get my head around the fact that they are (in both cases) not the actual brokers, and the
comission is usually at least, to the largest part earned by the brokers, sure they negotiated some kind of deal, but the
economics of it for each party seem hard to decipher right now..any input would be highly appreciated..:-)

Ok here is my take. First off, I made the distinction to point out that Tencent didn't beat them to the punch,
because what they are delivering is totally different.


Integrated basically means they provide other services other than just brokering trades. In the past, they were
an information services site - basically you pay a small fee to get information on stocks. Now, you sign up,
you deposit money, and they will provide information tailored to your goals and your portfolio. Similar to what
you can get from Fidelity, etc. Tencent, from what I understand, has a pretty minimalist level of brokerage-type
services that are offered.


I mean, if you read Tencent's profile, they do a lot of different things including "investment", but clearly it is
very different from what JRJC offers. Things like "stock trading" or "brokerage services" aren't even
mentioned:

And JRJC does get commissions. That's where most of the revenue comes from for their metals trading
business and it'll be the same for the new stock platform. So with the stock trading, expect a huge increase in
revenues like what happened with the metals platform. It could even be much larger if we assume that they
were testing the waters with the metals platform. From their annual report:

"We launched precious metals trading services in 2013, which was part of our transition to a new business
model. We generate commission income and trading revenues from our clients' precious metals trading. We
also generate subscription fee revenues from the sales of the financial information and investment advisory
services we currently offer."


So they are phasing out the business that was just selling stock information, and instead they are focusing on
people who actually have trading accounts set up with them. You're right that they aren't actually a stock
broker, so they split the commission with a broker. But judging from the metals business, it works out pretty
well for them. They have all the information services, the websites, advertising, etc. So they bring in the
customers. And don't forget, stock investing in China is still very new so there is the potential for ridiculous
growth.


In the US there are a lot of different sites where you can get streaming quotes, real-time information on
stocks, etc. In China it's different. Over the past few years JRJC has leveraged their political connections in
order to secure agreements with various brokerages as well as stock exchanges. They're unique and well-
positioned IMO.

Just goes to show in the short term fundamental analysis is worthless when momo traders have a new sardine. Much
thanks for your article, however. The Sep 10 calls have tripled since your PR yesterday!

CISG 6.80right now is the best play in the Chinese space that hasn't MOVED-It might not have the upside of JRJC or
others but it might be cheapest stock in the world.

Nearly 8 times tangible book and no earnings for 3 years should ring a bell for bulls. Is this announcement really worth
a double with that record?
