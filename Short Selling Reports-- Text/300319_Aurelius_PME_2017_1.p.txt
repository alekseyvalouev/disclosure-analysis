Research Summary


Our research demonstrates that Pingtan Marine (PME) has engaged
in fraudulent and illegal activities that conceal the reality that its
shares likely have zero value.


Instead, most of the value appears to have already been transferred
for the bene�t of Pingtan’s Chairman and his family.  The Chairman
is using an alias to cloak his real identity from investors while sitting
atop a syndicate of companies that use Pingtan to �nance
international crimes of fraud, poaching, and even human tra�cking.


In what appear to be largely phony transactions, Pingtan has paid
$910 million to the Chairman’s companies purportedly in exchange
for �shing ships and �shing services.  But substantial evidence
shows that a signi�cant portion of Pingtan’s �shing �eet actually
consists of rusting hulks decaying inside abandoned �shing bases.


Farcically, Pingtan has paid the Chairman’s companies an average of
$9 million per ship when the cost of new builds is only $1 million. 
Although Pingtan claims the majority of the embedded value comes
from �shing licenses, our research shows that most of the licenses
simply don’t exist. Even worse, many ships appear to have never
even been transferred to shareholders to begin with.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/pingtan-marine-fraud-finances-human-trafficking-poaching/ 3/25


To keep the funds from investors �owing, Pingtan has crafted a
�ctitious narrative and paid promoters to entice retail investors into
buying its shares. The stock price has surged by a factor of 4x as
management has fomented speculation that its �eet will soon be
redeployed in Indonesia.


But Pingtan’s “growth story” is a hoax. Pingtan is speci�cally banned
from Indonesia and a senior government minister has said she
would report Pingtan to the NASDAQ upon suspicion of an
“international fraud case.” Indonesian Armed Forces raided Pingtan’s
key �shing base and the Government implicated Pingtan and its
a�liates in serious crimes that include human tra�cking, forced
labor, illegal �shing, forgery, and bribing corrupt o�cials.


Numerous false statements have concealed the irreparable damage
from investors. With large undisclosed impairments, Pingtan is
already indebted, losing money, and burning cash. The company
claims to have a small �eet outside of Indonesia, but evidence
shows that many of those ships are owned by the Chairman’s
companies, not Pingtan.  This leads us to conclude that PME shares
are likely worthless.


The nature of Pingtan’s fraud strikes as being especially egregious
because investor capital has �nanced widespread illegal activity.
Indonesian Supreme Court documents describe violent “torture
ships” that implicate Pingtan in the modern-day slavery that has
infected pockets of South East Asia’s �shing industry.


Photos, documents, and drone footage provide irrefutable evidence
of systematic poaching of endangered species. Pingtan-�nanced
vessels have variously been detained by foreign governments with
one “mother ship” even being added to an Interpol list in 2015.


Each day that Pingtan continues to trade on the NASDAQ, its stain on
the US capital markets grows.  Ultimately, we believe that
shareholders are likely to be left with total losses.


About This Research Report
7/10/2019 Pingtan Marine: A Fraud That Finances Human Trafficking and Poaching - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/pingtan-marine-fraud-finances-human-trafficking-poaching/ 4/25


We conducted a four-month international investigation of Pingtan
and its a�liates. Our Chinese and Indonesian investigators pulled
hundreds of pages of source documents concerning Pingtan and the
Chairman’s syndicate of family controlled companies. We conducted
in-depth �nancial and forensic analysis to document the �ow of
funds and understand the true nature of Pingtan’s activities.


This report focuses primarily on our research opinion of Pingtan’s
fraud and the likelihood that shares have zero value.  But because
the fraud has been used to �nance crimes that include human
tra�cking and widespread poaching of endangered species, there
are also important public interest issues at stake.  The �nal sections
of the report provide evidence of these crimes.


Background


Pingtan Marine is a NASDAQ listed Chinese-headquartered ocean
�shing business that claims to own a 140-ship �eet primarily located
in Indonesia.  After reporting $83 million in FY 2014 pro�ts, �nancial
results fell precipitously following anti-illegal �shing measures
instituted by the Indonesian Government.


Pingtan has told investors that much of its �eet is “temporarily” idled
as part of an Indonesian �shing license moratorium. Pingtan claims
it is an advocate for illegal �shing enforcement with strong
government relationships and a “fully licensed” �shing �eet.  Shares
have recently surged by a factor of over 4x as management has
fueled speculation that its �eet will soon be redeployed to generate
windfall pro�ts.


The stock’s rise has been fomented by an aggressive promotional
campaign reminiscent of several previously exposed Chinese frauds
(here). Pingtan has �led to raise fresh capital while paying cash to
promoters who are speci�cally targeting Chinese retail investors
through social media, Youtube, and infomericals featuring the CFO.

Pingtan’s Fraud Starts At The Top


Pingtan displays obvious red �ags. The company’s origins trace to a
blank check company underwritten by a group that included Rodman
& Renshaw, an investment banking out�t that helped raise capital for
numerous US-listed Chinese frauds.  Pingtan’s CFO, Roy Yu, was
previously the CFO of Liwa International (LIWA), a fraudulent equity
that was rendered worthless after the CEO stole company assets.


Pingtan has had three auditors in the past four years while engaging
in a byzantine number of related party transactions. Serious
accounting problems surfaced in a massive 2014 restatement that
wiped out $187 million in equity.


Most glaringly, we discovered that Pingtan’s Chairman & CEO is
using an alias that conceals his identity from investors.


Pingtan claims its Chairman & CEO is a Hong Kong national named
“Xinrong Zhuo” who purportedly surrendered his Chinese identity
card in 2005. But this is contradicted by a number of Chinese

documents which demonstrate that Pingtan’s Chairman is a Chinese
national named Longxiong Zhuo.


Lonxiong Zhuo’s biography photo matches the photos of “Xinrong”
that Pingtan has included in promotional materials (below). 
Furthermore, Chinese Hukou records (household registration
documents) show that Ping Lin, the woman that Pingtan’s SEC �lings
name as the Chairman’s wife, is married to Longxiong Zhuo. The
documents speci�cally name Longxiong Zhuo and Ping Lin as the
parents of all three of the children that Pingtan names as the sons
and daughters of its Chairman (example below).

con�rmed by the shared birthmark located over the right eye.

Above: Chinese Hukou records name Hong Hong Zhuo as the
daughter of Longxiong Zhuo and Ping Lin, directly contradicting
Pingtan’s claims.


The principal problem is the Chairman is not who he says he is.
Importantly, our research shows that the Chairman and his family sit
atop a syndicate of related party companies that variously engage in
international crimes of fraud, poaching, and even human tra�cking.


As this report examines in detail, Pingtan is used as a �nancing
mechanism that has already funneled $910 million from investors to
the syndicate though related party transactions that appear to be
largely fraudulent. To keep the funds �owing, Pingtan has crafted a
false narrative to entice investors into its stock.  But this fraud
conceals the reality that PME shares likely have no value.

The Truth About Pingtan’s “Premier” Fishing Fleet


Pingtan has engaged in numerous related party transactions to
assemble a purported �eet of 140 Fu Yuan Yu �shing ships.  These
ships are speci�cally listed on Pingtan’s website and we tried to
locate them by consulting with experts from two leading maritime
databases that track ocean �eets.  While we found over 150 other Fu
Yuan Yu ships owned by different companies, we were unable to
verify the existence of most of Pingtan’s �eet.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/pingtan-marine-fraud-finances-human-trafficking-poaching/ 8/25


Pingtan claims in its March 2017 10-K �ling (page 2) that it has “a
license to operate 104 of these vessels in the Arafura Sea of
Indonesia.” However, the Indonesian Minister of Marine Affairs and
Fisheries, Susi Pudjiastuti, publicly declared that Pingtan has never
had any Indonesian �shing licenses and “there is no such company
in Indonesia.” In fact, the Minister declared she would report Pingtan
for “providing false reports to the NASDAQ stock exchange”,
explaining that “this case could be our �rst international fraud case
involving NASDAQ.”


Source: KKP News


So where are Pingtan’s ships?


Considerable evidence indicates that Pingtan is deceiving investors
by taking credit for vessels titled under related party Indonesian
companies controlled by the Chairman’s family, principally PT
Dwikarya Reksa Abadi (“Dwikarya”) and PT Avona Mina Lestari
(“Avona”). Pingtan’s SEC Filings name Avona and Dwikarya as being
essential to its operations and disclose tens of millions in payments
for items such as “vessel maintenance service” and �shing supplies.


The head of Indonesia’s Illegal Fishing Task Force has publicly
named Avona and Dwikarya as Pingtan’s Indonesian proxies while
Minister Susi has said that Dwikarya has “hundreds” of Chinese
vessels. Pingtan’s own promotional video features many Indonesian
�agged �shing vessels with names matching its a�liates, such as
KM Avona 23 and Dwikarya 25, as if they were its own (below).

Pingtan has clearly misrepresented its �eet to investors and the
facts suggest it may not even own the ships it claims. Indonesia has
prohibitions on foreign ownership of �shing interests and one media
report explains that “foreign �rms have set up shell companies to get
around the restrictions.” Thus, its possible that Pingtan used
Dwikarya and Avona to try and conceal its involvement from the
Indonesian government while retaining an economic interest. But
even if this is the case, Pingtan’s economic claims appear to have
been rendered largely irrelevant because a signi�cant portion of the
Indonesian �shing �eet is now in a severe state of decay.


Pingtan Purported Fishing Fleet Decays Inside Abandoned Fishing
Bases.


Pingtan’s 10-K explains that “a large portion of our operations are
conducted from a base owned by our related party PT. Avona Mina
Lestari.”  Pingtan speci�cally features Avona’s base in its
promotional video (below left, see 0:55 mark) and has continued to
highlight the base in marketing presentations as providing “barriers
to entry” by way of an “Indonesian �shing permit.”


But a 2016 video (here) shows Indonesian Armed Forces raiding
Avona’s base and seizing ships (Below right).

As we later discuss in more detail, the raid came after the Indonesian
Government implicated Pingtan and its a�liates in crimes including
human tra�cking, ocean poaching, forgery, and bribing corrupt
o�cials.


Pingtan is banned from Indonesia, its key a�liates have closed, and
the �shing bases now appear to be abandoned. 


None of these obviously material developments have been disclosed
to investors. Instead, in a December 2016 interview (�led as an 8-k
here), the CFO, Roy Yu, falsely told investors that the company has “a
good relationship” with the Indonesian government and that “we are
con�dent that the operation in Indonesian waters will restore to
normal in 2017.”


Mr. Yu also twice repeated that “our vessels are still berthed in our
base in Indonesia”, creating false hopes that the ships can be quickly
re-deployed. When asked on the most recent earnings call if
Pingtan’s Indonesian �eet would resume �shing this year, “Xinrong
Zhuo” replied that “I invoke con�dence”, hinting that “I hope that in
May I could give everyone good news in this regard.”


But we discovered that the ships are decaying inside now
abandoned �shing bases.


Some of the rusting hulks are pictured in a June 2016 DetikNews
report (below) that show 15 seized vessels covered in police tape.
The article (certi�ed translation here) says the police found the ships
were “already in a dilapidated state”:

Similarly, CNN Indonesia’s June 2016 tour of the shuttered Dwikarya
base turned up “dozens” of Chinese vessels beginning to submerge
after rusting for over two years (certi�ed translation here). The CNN
reporter described that:

The principal problem for shareholders is that Pingtan’s promotional
“growth story” is a hoax. Even if Pingtan owns the Indonesian �eet,
many of the ships appear to have decayed to near-worthlessness. 
Because 104 of Pingtan’s 140 ships are located in Indonesia, the
majority of the company’s stated assets have clearly been impaired.


Management’s false statements have concealed the irreparable
damage from investors. Pingtan’s business is almost entirely driven
by its purported �eet and many of the ships can no longer earn an
income. Similarly, the closed �shing bases and Pingtan’s ban from
Indonesia eliminates the possibility of future deployments there.

Pingtan has $60 million in debt and the �nancials show the company
is both losing money and burning cash.  As we later examine,
Pingtan’s non-Indonesian assets either have little value or appear to
not even be owned by shareholders.  This leads us to conclude that
PME shares are likely worthless.


And yet, Pingtan has �led to raise fresh capital from investors and
�nanced a stock promotion premised on the �ctitious notion that its
Indonesian �eet will soon be redeployed. This deception strikes us
as being especially egregious, but it underpins a fraud that has
funneled hundreds of millions from shareholders to Chairman Zhuo
and his family.


Pingtan’s Fraud Has Sent $910 Million To Related Parties


Pingtan’s fraud has sent $910 million since 2013 to Zhuo family
companies.  $720 million of this total represents purchases of ships,
principally from Fuzhou Honglong Ocean Fishery Co., Ltd
(“Honglong”). The facts show that most of the purchased ships
either do not exist as described, had little value at the time of
purchase, or appear to have never even been transferred to Pingtan
to begin with.


Source: Pingtan SEC Filings


The transaction prices are farcical on their face. Pingtan has paid an
average of $9.3 million per vessel, an amount that totals 9x the
“approximately $1 million” management has said it costs to build
brand new �shing vessels (Page 19). Said another way, Pingtan
could have built 720 new �shing ships but instead purchased 77
ships from the Zhuo family, many of which date to the 1970s-80s.

Pingtan says the transactions were made at fair market value “based
on third-party appraisal reports prepared by BMI appraisals limited.”
But the appraisals are baseless because they admit to being entirely
premised on inputs from Pingtan’s management (below). These
inputs, in turn, are irrefutably false.


Source: BMI Appraisal Report


Pingtan has asserted that “the predominant portion of the total asset
value” comes from the �shing licenses the ships supposedly hold.
Some appraisal reports are “intangible asset valuations” based
entirely on the estimated �shing license values. Yet our research
shows that most of Pingtan’s �shing licenses do not even exist.


The bulk of the purchased vessels are located in Indonesia but, as
previously discussed, Indonesian o�cials have made clear that
Pingtan never held any licenses there. Pingtan’s Indonesian a�liates
also appear to have operated without licenses for substantial
portions of their �eet.  Dwikarya was speci�cally found to have
bribed o�cials (page 3) while Avona made “gross falsi�cations of
the boats certi�cates” (page 2).


In 2015, Pingtan paid $56 million to related parties for six ships it
claimed were “internationally licensed.” Pingtan posted links on its
website to the Western & Central Paci�c Fisheries Commission
(“WCPFC”) as supposed evidence of the licenses (Fu Yuan Yu 001,
002, 008, 009, 010, 525).

But all the WCPFC links are now inaccessible and two of the ships
(009, 010) have been deleted in their entirety from Pingtan’s website. 
However, as recently as two weeks ago, the WCPFC pages had
stated that the licenses were expired and that the ships were owned
by Zhuo family companies, not Pingtan (below).


Source: Wayback machine for Fu Yuan Yu 001, 002, 008, 525.  Fu
Yuan Yu 009 & 010 were deleted from Pintan’s website sometime
after June, 2016.


We contacted the WCPFC to ask about the ships and why they were
recently deleted from the WCPFC website.  A WCPFC representative
explained that “we can only remove a vessel from our records if
we’re told to do so by the country [China].” The deletion signi�es that
“there is no vessel on the RFV [Registered Fishing Vessels List] with
that name” and ships must be on the list to have authorization to �sh
in the WCPFC area. Curiously, the 2016 proxy states that these six
ships were “dismantled” (page 21), a bizarre disclosure that implies
shareholders have suffered a total loss on this transaction.


Evidence shows other purchased vessels also have not been
transferred to Pingtan’s shareholders.  In fact, Pingtan’s massive
2014 restatement came after the company admitted the ships it
claimed to have purchased from related parties actually had not
been legally transferred and/or were just being leased.

Pingtan says it owns only 36 ships outside of Indonesia, most of
which are newly built vessels that shareholders have paid tens of
millions to construct. Management has touted the deployment of 13
of these ships, Fu Yuan Yu 9607-9621, to �sh in Timor Leste pursuant
to a �shing license it claims to have been awarded. Yet egregiously,
the Timorese government con�rmed to our investigators that the
ships are actually owned by the Zhuo family’s Honglong company.


Furthermore, evidence shows the Timorese �shing licenses were
awarded to Honglong, not Pingtan. This is corroborated by a Chinese
Embassy news release as well as a Timorese government o�cial,
who told the Sydney Morning Herald that the government had even
“sought and received a written assurance Pingtan was not involved.”


Source: Sydney Morning Herald


On top of the fraudulent ship purchases, Pingtan has disclosed
paying $190 million to seven Zhuo family companies for �shing
services, fuel, and vessel maintenance (below).  We suspect these
payments are largely fraudulent because they include obviously
illegitimate entries such as fees to Avona and Dwikarya to “renew
Indonesian �shing licenses” (which appear to be non-existent). More
broadly, since the related parties themselves appear to own many of
the ships, Pingtan shareholders seem to be paying to maintain
�shing vessels that they don’t even own.

How Investor Capital Finances Human Tra�cking


Pingtan’s fraud has used investor capital to �nance illegal activity.
Documents we obtained from the Indonesian Supreme Court reveal
that Pingtan’s Indonesian a�liate, Dwikarya, was speci�cally found
by the Indonesian Government to have committed “major crimes
among which are forced labor and human tra�cking” (We hired
professional translators to complete certi�ed translations of relevant
sections cited below. An approximate translation of the entire 296
page document can be found here).

Although Pingtan is not speci�cally named in the Indonesian court
documents, Minister Susi has said that Pingtan’s “ownership, trade
and management dealings” with Dwikarya, Avona and two other
Indonesian a�liates “had violated the law to a serious extent.”  The
Dwikarya 25, a vessel clearly highlighted in Pingtan’s promotional
video (pictured earlier in this report), was even speci�cally named in
the court documents alongside a �eet of other similarly named
vessels (page 16).  Additionally, Pingtan’s own �lings admit to
making millions in payments to Dwikarya.


Dwikarya denied the accusations and appealed to Indonesia’s
Supreme Court, but the judges upheld the Indonesian Government’s
determination that serious crimes occurred and ruled against
Dwikarya who was ordered to pay the Government’s legal fees
(certi�ed translation here).


Modern-day slavery infects pockets of Southeast Asia’s Ocean
�shing industry. Last year, the Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize
for its series, Seafood from Slaves, which revealed how boat laborers
are lured into captivity, locked in cages on remote Indonesian
islands, beaten, and forced to work grueling hours on the high seas.


Ian Urbina of The New York Times authored an in depth series, The
Outlaw Ocean, which documented the nexus between illegal �shing,

human tra�cking, ocean murders, money laundering, and drug
smuggling.


Men and children from poor families are tricked by tra�ckers with
false �nancial promises and then “drugged, kidnapped, and
enslaved” on �shing boats with “horri�c violence; the sick cast
overboard, the de�ant beheaded, the insubordinate sealed for days
below deck in a dark, fetid �shing hold.”  Similar accounts of sea-
slavery, including “fellow workers shot and killed by the captain” have
been reported by the South China Morning Post and The Guardian.


Referred to as “torture ships” in court documents, judges heard
testimony that Dwikarya deployed violence to force the crews to
work. One worker testi�ed that he “was once tortured for standing up
[for] his Indonesian co-worker who was gang-beaten by the Chinese”
(page 8) while another testi�ed that he saw a senior o�cial beat a
crew member (page 7). An Indonesian government investigator also
testi�ed that a boat laborer was severely beaten in the head with a
piece of steel by a superior (page 6).


Separately, we discovered that an ocean murder is documented to
have occurred onboard an overcrowded Honglong vessel (owned by
the Chairman’s family), Fu Yuan Yu 557, in Fiji in 2015.

Evidence indicates that some Dwikarya boat laborers were imported
from the Philippines (certi�ed translation here), a hotbed of the
illegal “manning agencies” that tra�c unsuspecting villagers into
bondage. In an Indonesian media interview, Dwikarya’s local Director
admits to using hundreds of foreign boat laborers but denies
allegations that they are disguised by fake passports. However, the

Indonesian government argued in court documents that Dwikarya
had admitted to bribing immigration o�cials (page 3).


Pingtan Finances The Widespread Poaching of Endangered Species


Photos, court documents, and drone footage demonstrate that
Pingtan and the a�liates it �nances also engage in widespread
illegal �shing and poaching of endangered species.


The Indonesian Supreme court documents describe a variety of
“�shing crimes” enabled by Transhipment, whereby �shing vessels
are supplied by a refrigerated “mother ship” that allows them to stay
�shing at sea for months, even years.  The mother ship, in turn, takes
possession of the illegal catch and brings it to market.  This process
is used by poachers to launder ill-gotten and/or slave caught �sh into
the global food chain.


We discovered that Pingtan-a�liated mother ships include the
Danfeng Mariner, Fu Yuan Yu 80, and the MV Hai Fa. According to the
Indonesian government, each of these ships has engaged in illegal
transshipment (here, here, here).


Chief among these vessels is the Hai Fa, a Panamanian �agged
vessel owned by a company named Hai Yi Shipping. Pingtan’s �lings
show that it has paid millions in cash to Hai Yi, named as an a�liate
owned by the Zhuo family, in exchange for “transportation service.”


Interpol issued a Purple Notice on the Hai Fa during 2015, the
equivalent of adding it to the “Most Wanted” list.  In fact, The New
York Times has reported Purple Notices were reserved for only four
other ships in the world during 2015.


The Indonesian Navy caught the Hai Fa with its Vessel Monitoring
System switched off and holding 900 tons of illegally caught �sh,
including a large amount of protected sharks. As the largest illegal
�shing bust in Indonesia’s history Minister Susi declared:

The activities of the Hai Fa appear closely intertwined with Pingtan
and Chairman Zhuo’s syndicate of companies. An Indonesian
General told the Jakarta Post there was a “strong indication” that the
suppliers of the �sh were Dwikarya and Avona, an assertion which
was made evident in court documents.  Indonesian investigative
journalists tracked the intended recipient of the Hai Fa’s illegal cargo
to Fuzhou Hao You Li Fishery Development, an entity registered to
Pingtan’s address. Hao You Li is named in Pingtan’s SEC �lings as
being an a�liate owned by the Zhuo family and Pingtan has even
guaranteed Hao You Li’s debt (page 149).


Court documents (page 4) include testimony that Dwikarya vessels
would load their cargo holds with dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks.
Sharks are particularly valuable because their �ns can be sold in
China for a premium to make prized “Shark Fin Soup” (a primary
reason why many shark species are nearing extinction). Shark
poachers often engage in Shark Finning, a practice where the �ns are
sliced off while the shark is still alive before it is then thrown back
into the ocean to die.


The below photos show Dwikarya’s illegal kills of rare Whale Sharks,
which are even protected by Chinese law. And yet, Poachers
continue to bring them to markets where they are sawed alive.


“I will not be happy before the ship is sunk in the
Indonesian Ocean.”


Above: An Indonesian o�cial poses near the detained
MV Hai Fai (left). Hai Fa’s cargo hold (right) is shown
full of illegally caught �sh and protected sharks
destined for an address matching Pingtan’s
headquarters.

Pingtan appears to be part of a giant shark poaching ring. We
discovered a nexus between Pingtan, Honglong, and an organization
called the China Shark Product Cooperative.  The Cooperative claims
to be the “biggest shark supplier in China” and tra�cs in endangered
species such as Hammerheads. The Cooperative frequently
promotes the activities of Pingtan and Honglong in news releases
that include an interview with Longxiong Zhuo.

In addition to �sh and marine animals, court documents reveal that
protected animals including endangered birds and reptiles were
regularly shipped by boat to China.

Recently, Pingtan and its a�liates have begun to poach new waters.
 Irrefutable evidence of poaching recently surfaced in Timor Leste
where, as previously explained, vessels Pingtan falsely claims to own
were deployed.


In February 2017, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that “Pingtan
vessels were discovered a fortnight ago with a cargo hold stuffed
with sharks” as well as illegally caught Rays from Timorese waters.

We found drone footage (available here) taken during the inspection
that makes Pingtan’s poaching undeniable.


Above: Drone footage con�rms Pingtan’s poaching.


Just last month, Pingtan trumpeted its purchase of �ve squid �shing
vessels from Honglong for $38 million.  Yet one of the vessels
named in Pingtan’s press release, Fu Yuan Yu 7880, was arrested
along with two other vessels by the South African Navy last summer
for suspected poaching after a “dramatic sea chase” in which they
attempted to �ee (the ships were later �ned after being found guilty
of several offenses).


Conclusion


Each day that Pingtan continues to trade on the NASDAQ, its stain on
the US capital markets grows.


Our research demonstrates that Pingtan Marine (PME) has engaged
in fraudulent activities that conceal the reality that its shares likely
have zero value. The nature of Pingtan’s fraud strikes as being
especially egregious because investor capital has indisputably
�nanced widespread illegal activity.


Ultimately, we believe that shareholders are likely to be left with total
losses.


All investors are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence
