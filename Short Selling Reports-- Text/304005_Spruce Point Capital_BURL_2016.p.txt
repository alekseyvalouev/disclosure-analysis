Executive Summary
6


Spruce Point is Cautious on Burlington 
Stores For the Following Reasons:


Burlington (“BURL” or “the Company”) Is An Old School Retailer Now Being Spun As A Sexy New Growth Story Amidst 


An Intensifying and Ultra Competitive Retailing Environment


 Burlington Stores (formerly Burlington Coat Factory) is an “off-price” discount retailer based in Burlington, NJ that sells men’s and 


women’s clothing, home furnishings, and accessories. It competes with the likes of TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls), Ross


Stores, and countless other retailers offering shoppers a discount to the M.S.R.P.


 In January 2006, Bain Capital privatized Burlington by acquiring control for $45.50 per share, valuing the company at $2.0 billion, 


or 7x EBITDAR and 15.6x P/E according to the proxy


 Under pressure from a series of struggling retail investments (e.g. Toys R’Us, Guitar Center), Bain Capital seized the opportunity 


to re-IPO Burlington in 2013. Its IPO prospectus touted various growth opportunities to excite new investors including: a) Improve 


merchandising, b) improve the shopping experience for its mostly female customer base, c) refresh existing stores and grow to


1,000 locations, and e) invest in technology + supply chain initiatives to inc. inventory turnover, and improve operating leverage


 With its share price up 330% since its IPO, Burlington has benefited both from low income shoppers searching for deals, and 


management’s aggressive financial and accounting tactics to engineer “beat and raise” quarters. However, in the brutally 


competitive retail business fortunes can change fast, and we believe investors are under-appreciating risks being signaled 


Burlington Has Been Touting impressive Comparable Store Sales (“CSS”), Gross Margin, and EPS Gains, While Shrinking 


Same Store Inventory. We Don’t Think It Can Last. Spruce Point Has Identified Numerous Financial Presentation, 


Accounting, And Business Issues That Could Be Signaling A Slowdown In Future Financial Results


 At IPO, Burlington touted the advantages of its large stores (80k sqft). Now, the story keeps changing; it repeatedly talked down 


its optimal store size format (50-60k, now 40-50k). In our opinion, this may create and apples-to-oranges problem for its comp 


store base, may allow it to juice its comps by reclassifying modified or relocated stores as new, and changes its unit economics 


 As an indicator of potential strain, recent sales growth rates have rapidly diverged from accounts receivables growth


This type of divergence is a classic red flag. Burlington also bought-in its fragrance category, which allowed it to boost its comps


 Burlington presents its gross margin, a key performance indicator, in a non-standard way, by excluding store occupancy costs and 


depreciation of certain fixed assets. Burlington used to disclose its occupancy costs in SG&A but has repeatedly made changes to 


SG&A disclosures, and is now completely obscuring occupancy costs making it hard to evaluate trends


 Our recent store visits left us with the impression that stores were unoptimized. With comp store inventory declining, existing and 


new competitors rapidly entering the discount segment, Burlington may be challenged to sustain recent performance.

Burlington’s Inventory and Financials 
Signaling Potential Strain


In Our Opinion, The Crux of Burlington’s Financial Stains Can Be Seen By Closely Evaluating Its Inventory Accounting, 


Pack and Hold Inventory Strategy, And Inventory Turnover


 The Company uses the retail inventory method, which is open to significant management judgment and estimates including 


merchandise markon, markups, markdowns and shrinkage (aka loss of inventory from theft) which significantly impact the 


ending inventory valuation as well as the resulting gross margin


 Shrinkage estimates reversed in Q4’15 for the first time ever, resulting in a $3.5m hit to gross margin. We’ve identified a 


troublesome rise in reports of theft and violence at Burlington locations which suggests more reversals may occur


 Burlington always touts its ability to improve inventory turnover as a key driver of sustaining and improving its financial 


performance. Burlington uses a non-standard inventory turnover calculation, stopped disclosing turnover inclusive of 


warehouses where pack and hold inventory resides, and recently stopped disclosing the annualized quarterly metric mid 2015


 Pack and hold, an inventory management strategy to buy discounted merchandise and hold it for future periods, rapidly surged 


post IPO. In our opinion, the strategy provides management opportunity to manage gross margins and boost turnover. We 


identified a misstatement of its pack and hold inventory value in Q3’15; at best an error, at worst accounting manipulation


In Our Opinion, Another Big Area Of Concern Is Burlington’s Store Unit Economics Appear To Be Deteriorating 


 After its IPO in 2013, Burlington stopped disclosing the unit economics of its stores, which it said cost an average of $1.6m -


$1.8m for a typical 80k sqft location ($21.25/sqft at the midpoint). In Q1’16, Burlington recently stopped making the affirmative 


statement in its SEC filings that a “vast majority of existing stores had positive Adjusted EBITDA”


 With less than 1% of sales coming from ecommerce, store location and physical sales are critical to its success. It appears that 


in recent years, the Company has been opening stores at locations of failed retailers (Kmart, Sears, Filene’s Basement)


 A recent FOIA request to obtain a building permit for a new 50k sqft location in Delaware supports our view that unit economics 


may be deteriorating. Based on conservative assumptions of inventory spend, pre-marketing costs (which accounting rules 


dictate must be expensed but Burlington doesn’t disclose), we estimate per sqft costs have increased 17%-45%


 Burlington received large EPS and cash flow benefits from landlord incentives that were increased after its acquisition by Bain,


and may have been facilitated by its larger store format and slack in the commercial real estate market in the post-financial crisis 


period. Burlington’s move towards smaller stores, may taper the benefits of these lease incentives. Its accounts are signaling a 


slowdown of EPS and cash flow benefits from incentives. Accrued deferred lease incentives are now declining, and net 


operating cash flow benefits from rent incentives recently turned negative

Spruce Point Has Uncovered Hard Evidence 
Suggesting Earnings Manipulation


Significant Recent Turnover In Management, While Remaining Members of Burlington’s Management Team In Key 


Financial, Accounting and Operational Roles Have Worked At Retailers Plagued with Accounting and Operational Issues


 Numerous recent resignations of key executives for vague reasons include: CFO Todd Weyrich in Jan 2015 for “personal 


reasons” while guidance was increased, EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer quietly resigned via 8-K filing in March 2015 to 


“pursue other interests” and long-time General Counsel Paul Tang quietly departed in July 2015, replaced by Janet Dhillon 


 CEO Kingsbury’s track record deserves close scrutiny. He was CEO of Filene’s through 2006, which suffered declining sales 


each year. At Kohl’s he was quietly removed from store operations, administration, and merchandising. Kohl’s delayed its SEC 


filings in 2011 and restated results to 2008 for a material weaknesses and issues with “complex” lease accounting. What role, if


any, did he play with leases as head of store ops and admin. and why does Burlington also have aggressive operating leases?


 CFO Marc Katz previously was CFO at A.C. Moore, a retailer that disclosed substantial inventory accounting and supply chain 


challenges. Its earnings restatement resulted in the company changing its FY 2006 results from earnings to losses. Katz is joined 


by other key A.C. Moore executives such as Mike Metheny (EVP of Supply Chain) and Dennis Hodgson (SVP and CIO)


 Burlington’s Chief Accounting Officer’s John Crimmins record is also tainted by accounting scandal. Crimmins was Timberland’s 


Corporate Controller, Chief Accounting Officer, and later promoted to CFO. In April 2007, Timberland delayed its Q1 earnings,


and its audit committee said its financials from 2001-2006 could no longer be relied upon


Spruce Point Has Obtained Bona Fide Documentary Evidence Which Suggests Aggressive Accounting at Burlington, And 


May Explain Why Its Audit Committee Recently Adopted a Clawback Provision Covering Acts of Fraud


 Our suspicion that Burlington’s accounting appears aggressive were heightened when in Q1’16 the Company reported a $2.5m 


benefit from the sale of a NJ tax credit (is the Company signaling a slowdown of income, or aggressively managing earnings?) 


 Spruce Point filed a FOIA request with the NJ Economic Development Authority, the gov’t agency that granted Burlington a $40m


tax incentive to maintain and create jobs in NJ. To our disbelief, we found that Burlington legally sold the credits to Citigroup in 


August 2015 (Q3’15), yet booked the transaction to income in Q1’16. This appears to be an extremely aggressive interpretation 


of GAAP, which usually dictates recording transactions in the period they occur


 In our opinion, Burlington’s motivation appears clear: it needed to beat aggressive earnings estimates for Q1’16. The tax credit


sale boosted its EPS by $0.02 cents, resulting in a quarterly beat by $0.04 cents and sending its shares up 7% by noon that day


 Coincidence or not? In February 2016, Burlington’s Audit Committee added a compensation clawback provision for 


management, “in the event of a financial restatement or significant financial harm to the Company arising out of willful actions, 


including without limitation fraud or intentional misconduct to cover fraud and financial misstatement.”

Burlington’s Share Price Has 20% – 40% 
Downside Potential


With Burlington’s Share Price Near All-Time Highs, And Bain Capital Cashed Out, Management is Selling Stock Fast


 In addition to the recently added clawback provision noted earlier, a subtle change to management’s Annual Incentive Plan for 


2016 also may signal the unsustainability of its earnings growth: 


 To illustrate, the incentive compensation has historically been determined 50% by comparable store sales and 50% by 


Adjusted Net Income. In Feb 2016, the Board approved replacing the “Adjusted Net Income” portion of the Financial 


Component with “Adjusted Net Income per share.” 


 The change in definition is important because Burlington has implemented two share repurchase programs in 2015, 


allowing it to repurchase a total of $400m of stock. In effect, management can mask a declining earnings growth rate by 


accelerating repurchases and earning a bonus for repurchasing shares! 


 A total of seven insiders have sold shares this year and reaped $27m in proceeds:


 CEO Kingsbury and EVP Supply Chain Metheny implemented 10b5-1 stock sale programs in March 2016 (shortly after the 


clawback provision), followed by the EVP of HR also initiating a program in June


 Other key insiders selling include Katz (CFO), Seeger (EVP of Planning & Allocation and MIO), and Hand (EVP of Stores)


Burlington’s Shares Are Priced For Perfection Without Incorporating Fresh Concerns We’ve Highlighted


 Burlington current trades at approx. 11x and 21x 2017E Adj. EBITDA and EPS, respectively, and is among the most levered 


retailer at approximately 2.5x Debt / 16E EBITDA. However, adjusting its financials for nearly $2.5 billion in off-balance sheet


leases, we estimate its true Adj. Debt / EBITDAR to be closer to 4.0x – dangerously high for an undifferentiated apparel retailer 


 Wall St. sell-side analysts see 24% upside to an average price target of $90/share. Analysts’ are wildly optimistic that it can grow 


EPS 20% next year through continued CSS growth, and EBITDA margin expansion of 40 – 50bps – almost blindly taking 


management’s word and extrapolating results into the foreseeable future without even raising any of our concerns


 Analysts’ try to draw comparisons between Burlington and best-of-breed retailers TJX and Ross Stores in justifying its rich 


valuation and price targets. However, Spruce Point believes that Burlington’s vast operational inefficiencies and margin gap will be 


difficult to reach in the absence of substantially more capital investment. Not surprisingly, Burlington is quietly ratcheting up 


spending for “supply chain” initiatives, which are susceptible to aggressive cost capitalization which embellishes EPS


 Burlington’s valuation multiple is stretched and trading near an all-time high and discount none of the fresh concerns we’ve raised 


about the sustainability of its recent performance and the integrity of its accounting and financial reporting practices. By 


normalizing Burlington’s valuation and trimming estimates, we see a share price range of $45 – $60, or 20% – 40% downside

$ in millions, except per share figures


Estimates based on Wall St. Research and Spruce Point adjustments


Burlington has recently taken 


advantage of generous credit 


conditions to secure low interest 


rates, and it has no near term 


debt maturities. However, it has 


significant operating lease 


obligations for stores which are a 


fixed form of debt that need to be 


carefully evaluated and factored 


into the company’s valuation and 


business risk.


Burlington’s Debt Maturity Profile
$ in mm


Spruce Point believes Burlington’s leverage for a retailer is aggressive and its valuation is rich. The retail industry is brutally 


competitive and we believe Burlington’s apparel and home furnishing offerings are largely undifferentiated, which exposes 


investors to above average business risk.

Warning:  Burlington’s Competition Is Set To 
Rise Dramatically Going Forward


Competitor Company Expansion Plans Announced


Incumbent Ross Stores March 2016: Ross plans to add 90 new stores in 2016


TJX Companies
May 2016: T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods plan to open thousands of new stores and increase its 
footprint by 50% from 3,700 to 5,600 stores


Nordstrom’s Rack
Oct 2015: “Nordstrom is expanding its off-price chain Nordstrom Rack, like crazy.” Planning to increase 
its current 180 stores up to 300 by 2020


Off 5th Saks
April 2016: Hudson Bay (owner of Saks) details $750-$850m capital budget, with 30% towards growth 
initiatives to expand Saks and Off 5th stores. Thirty two new Off 5th Stores planned


Aldi (German)
June 2015: Aldi plans U.S. expansion; will open 25 stores in 2016 with a goal of opening 650 new stores 
and spending $3bn over 5 years. While mostly a grocer, Aldi also sells home goods and clothing


New Entrant Lord & Taylor
Oct 2015: Lord & Taylor announced the launch of Find @ Lord & Taylor; First store to launch in NJ with 
6 more opening planned for 2016


Macy’s Backstage Nov 2015: Macy’s to launch 5 stores in 2015, and 50 more over the next two years


Primark (Irish)
Sept 2015:  Discount fast fashion Primark enters US in Boston through old Filene’s Basement location. 
Primark plans to open 6 new stores in 2016


Lidl (German)
Nov 2015: Lidl, a cross between a WalMart and Trader Joe’s, will start opening stores in the US in 2018. 
Lidl offers deep discounts on groceries, household appliances, clothes and furniture


The recent success of the off-price / discount retail category is attracting new competitors (foreign retailers), and causing 


existing department store competitors looking to go down market to enter the playing field. Burlington’s stated goal is to open 


25 new stores per annum, but will have to compete for space amongst its competitors.

Burlington Has Limited Online Presence


Burlington Touted Its Ecommerce Efforts at its IPO


“We have been selling to our customers online for more than a decade. We 


plan to leverage this heritage, along with our newly relaunched e-commerce 


platform, to expand our online assortment and utilize e-commerce strategies 


to drive incremental traffic to our stores.”  (Source: S-1, p. 6)


And Continues To Promote It To Investors In Its Annual Report:


“We employ an e-commerce strategy currently focused on increasing 


awareness of the breadth of our merchandise selection, great brands and 


values, as well as driving traffic to our stores and selling merchandise directly 


from our website. We execute our strategy through our website and through 


social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. In Fall 2013, 


we re-launched our website with a significantly upgraded user experience –


including improved navigation, shopping functionality and a more modern 


layout to increase site traffic and conversion rates. This re-launch also 


included an expansion of the online merchandise assortment to include 


additional items across women’s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth 


apparel, baby, accessories, home and coats.”  (Source: 2015 10-K, p. 4)


Recently on Sept 8, 2016 when asked about ecommerce at the 


Goldman Sachs Retailing Conference (source) 


Analyst: “On e-commerce, I know it’s a different focus for you guys than for 


many other retailers, but we are asking everyone about online margins 


relative to store margins, whether they’re higher, lower or the same?”


CFO Katz: “It’s less than 1% of our business, it’s not even worth (discussing)”


Burlington’s Sad E-commerce Reality


Burlington’s e-commerce initiatives have sorely disappointed. Having a weak online presence in an increasingly 


digital world could severely handicap Burlington.


The Amazon Effect Is Real


Most of What Is Sold At Burlington, Can Be Bought At Amazon


Home furnishings, apparel, accessories, and sundry items


Burlington is Especially Exposed To Apparel


According to its recent annual report, apparel and accessories 


amounted to 89% of its revenues! Just 11% of sales were classified 


as Home products.

No


BURL’s decision to shrink its sqft is noteworthy. According to old SEC filings, it considers modified stores as “new 


stores” which could inflate its comp store sales metric by allowing it to drop mature stores from the comp base, and 


then re-include them as new. Its comp base will have an apples-to-oranges problem (a mix of different format stores).


Burlington last reported that it treated modified stores as new stores in Jan 2010 (source). It then dropped its discussion about how it treats 


modified stores from SEC filings post January 2010, but did not conclusively say it changed its treatment of modified stores.(1) Burlington 


still warns the following: “The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our definition of 


comparable store sales may differ from other retailers”


Source: TJX 10-K, Ross 10-K, Burlington 10-K and press release


(1) “We now define comparative store sales as sales of those stores commencing on the first day of the fiscal month one year after the end of their grand opening activities, which 


normally conclude within the first two months of operations.  Previously, we defined comparative store sales as sales of those stores (net of sales discounts) following their four hundred 


and twenty-fifth day of operation (approximately one year and two months).” (source)

YoY Change in Accounts Receivable YoY Sales Growth


Diverging Sales vs. Account’s Receivable Is a Classic Red Flag


 The retail industry is straight forward: a sale is accounted for at 


the point of purchase. Sales are in cash or credit, with credit 


sales generating an account receivable


 As a result, accounts receivable and sales should be closely 


aligned with any departures carefully evaluated


 Burlington’s year-over-year revenue growth has been stable in 


the 6-10% range since 2012, yet its accounts receivable growth 


has widely diverged from 2013-2015


 Burlington’s anomalous financials are illustrated by comparing its 


results with TJX and Ross Stores. As illustrated in the charts 


below, both companies report annual changes in sales which 


more closely follow accounts receivable
19


Unsustainable Gains From Inventory Liquidation


Comp. Store Inventory Decline vs. CSS Growth


Empty Racks Enormous Empty Floor Space


Burlington believes that shrinking its inventory per store will sustain 


higher inventory turnover:


 “We plan to continue to reduce comparable store inventories which we 


believe will result in faster inventory turnover,” and “We believe that as 


we continue to reduce our comparable store inventory, we will be able 


to reduce the square footage of our stores while continuing to maintain 


our broad assortment.” (2016 10-Q, pp. 18 and 23) 


Yet, Spruce Point believes Burlington may be challenged to sustain 


higher comparable store sales (“CSS”):


 Recent channel checks shows stores being practically liquidated with 


“clearance” promotions, empty racks, significant shelf space, and 


disheveled product


 How will it sustain CSS increases with shrinking inventory assortment 


in the absence of turning over higher margin product faster (next few 


slides discuss turnover concerns)

Burlington’s Inventory Turnover Definition 
Non-Standard, Now No Longer Disclosed


Pre Bain Acquisition (Source: Annual Report, Fiscal Year Ended May 2004) 


“Inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the retail sales by the average stock for the period being measured”


Inventory Turnover Definition Changed April 2012 before IPO (Source: 10-K, page 19)


“Annualized Store Inventory Turnover is calculated by dividing comparable store retail sales by the average comparable store retail value of 


inventory for the period being measured. The calculation is based on a rolling 13 month average of inventory and the last 12 months’ sales.” 


Burlington Used To Disclose Turnover Inclusive And Exclusive of Warehouse Inventory


 At its IPO, Burlington disclosed the following: “Our annualized inventory turnover rate (inclusive of stores and warehouse inventory) was 


3.2 turns and 2.8 turns per year at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. Our annualized comparable store inventory turnover 


rate (exclusive of warehouse inventory) increased to 3.6 turns per year during Fiscal 2012 compared with 3.1 turns per year during Fiscal 


2011.”  (Source: S-1, p. 56)


 Post IPO, the Company stopped disclosing turnover inclusive of warehouse inventory (very important given increase in pack and 


hold strategy shift): “Comparable store inventory turnover is calculated by dividing comparable store sales by the average comparable store 


retail value of inventory for the period being measured. The calculation is based on a rolling 13 month average of inventory and the last 12 


months’ comparable sales. Our comparable store inventory turnover rate (exclusive of warehouse inventory) increased to 4.0 turns per year 


during Fiscal 2013 compared with 3.6 turns per year during Fiscal 2012.” (Source: 10-K, p. 31)  


Burlington Also Stopped Disclosing Inventory Turnover Calculations on a Quarterly Basis


 Through Q3 2014, Burlington regularly disclosed inventory turnover calculations on a quarterly basis: “Comparable store inventory 


turnover is calculated by dividing comparable store sales by the average comparable store retail value of inventory for the period being 


measured. The calculation is based on a rolling 13 month average of inventory and the last 12 months’ comparable sales. Our annualized 


comparable store inventory turnover rate (exclusive of warehouse inventory) as of November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013 was 4.5 turns per 


year and 3.8 turns per year, respectively.” (Source: 10-Q, p. 31)


 In Q1 2015 Burlington Stopped Disclosing Inventory Turnover: “Comparable store inventory turnover is calculated by dividing comparable 


store sales by the average comparable store retail value of inventory for the period being measured. Our comparable store inventory turnover 


improved by approximately 18% for the first quarter of Fiscal 2015 compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2014.” (10-Q, p.36)

Warning: Burlington’s Gross Margin 
Definition Highly Non-Standard


Company Description of Cost of Sales


Burlington


“Cost of Sales” line item includes all costs of merchandise (net of purchase discounts and certain vendor allowances), inbound 
freight, distribution center outbound freight and certain merchandise acquisition costs, primarily commissions and import fees. Our 


cost of sales and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some entities include all of the costs
related to their buying and distribution functions in cost of sales Source: S-1, pp. 55 and 67 


Ross 
Stores


In addition to product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight expenses as well as 
occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying, and distribution facilities. 


Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the 
Company’s distribution centers and warehouse facilities. (Source: 10-K, p. 35)


Stein 
Mart


Cost of merchandise sold includes merchandise costs, net of vendor discounts and allowances; freight; inventory shrinkage; store 
occupancy costs (including rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and maintenance); payroll, benefits and 


travel costs directly associated with buying inventory; and costs related to the consolidation centers and distribution 
warehouses.(Source: 10-K, F-11)


TJX Companies


Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, includes the cost of merchandise sold including foreign currency gains and 
losses on merchandise purchases denominated in other currencies; gains and losses on inventory and fuel-related derivative 


contracts; store occupancy costs (including real estate taxes, utility and maintenance costs and fixed asset depreciation); the costs 
of operating distribution centers; payroll, benefits and travel costs directly associated with buying inventory; and systems costs 


related to the buying and tracking of inventory. (Source: 10-K, p. F-8)


Burlington’s gross margin is inflated by excluding store occupancy costs and certain costs of buying and distributing goods

Warning: Burlington’s Gross Margin 
Definition Highly Non-Standard


Burlington’s peers report gross margins inclusive of occupancy costs and certain depreciation. We’ve adjusted its gross 


margins to more closely align its results with its peers. Starting in 2015, Burlington changed the reporting of its SG&A and no 


longer categorized expenses as occupancy costs, rendering it impossible to accurately compare results among peers.

Burlington used to clearly identify “Occupancy” costs as part of SG&A. Now it is impossible to understand what is 


considered occupancy costs for relevant comparison to peers, and to monitor changes in cost trends.

Burlington’s Inventory Accounting Method


Burlington’s inventory accounting choice is open to significant management judgement.


When asked about pack on hold on the Q3’15 conference call, the CEO reiterated that it’s the 


Company’s highest margin product. This could have given management incentive to manipulate the 


pack and hold inventory accounting in order to artificially bolster gross margins.


Burlington’s Inventory Accounting Method


Our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the


valuation of inventory and the resulting gross margin are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail


value of inventory. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that results in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or


market provided markdowns are taken timely to reduce the retail value of inventory. Inherent in the retail inventory method 


calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including merchandise markon, markups, 


markdowns and shrinkage, which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation as well as the resulting gross 


margin. Management believes that our retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost using 


a first-in, first-out assumption and results in carrying value at the lower of cost or market    Source: 10-K, p.40


Paul Lejuez, Citigroup Analyst on the Q3’15 Conference Call


“Thanks, guys. Just curious, what set of results are you seeing on pack-away merchandise and what sort of margins do you 


see on that product relative to the rest of your assortment? Do you look at that as more of a sales driver or margin driver or 


both? And then can you just fill us in on what categories were weaker for you guys and I’m just curious about CapEx next 


year, Marc, as you’re getting through that planning process? Thanks.


Thomas Kingsbury, CEO of Burlington


“Okay. I’ll take that Paul and I’ll let Marc talk about CapEx. I’ll take the first part of that. Pack and hold is our fastest turning 


highest margin product we have in our assortment because by definition it’s great values – great brands, great values. We 


have a very rigorous process in order to approve anything that goes into pack away.”

Pack and Hold Inventory As a % of Total Inventory


Burlington’s Pack and Hold Surged Post IPO


$ in millions


Pack and hold is a purchasing strategy that involves acquiring merchandise opportunistically, and storing it at 
warehousing or distribution facilities for sale at a future date


 The pack and hold strategy has both risks and rewards. The reward is that the merchandise is often purchased at a 


discount from vendors with cost overruns, or cancelled orders. This gives Burlington the opportunity to achieve a greater margin. 


The risk is that by the future date when it decides to sell the stored merchandise, that consumer preferences have changed and 


the inventory has to be marked down


 Burlington has no stated pack and hold strategy. Burlington has repeatedly told investors on conference calls it doesn’t have 


a set pack and hold inventory target, but acts opportunistically in response to deals (Source, Source). However, it has doubled 


its pack and hold inventory from 13% of total merchandise inventory in 2012 to 27% in Q2’16. In aggregate, the value of pack 


and hold inventory is up 127% since 2012, yet warehousing space has increased by approximately 51%

Pack and Hold Used To Manipulate 
Inventory and Gross Margins?


In the Q3’14 Press Release, Burlington Disclosed 18% of Merchandise Inventories As Pack and Hold


“Merchandise Inventories were $899.9 million vs. $902.4 million at November 2, 2013. The decrease was 


primarily driven by a comparable store inventory decrease of 13.7% as a part of the Company’s ongoing 


initiatives to reduce inventory levels, increase inventory turnover and ultimately drive incremental sales 


through continually improved product offerings. This decrease was partially offset by a $50.4 million 


increase in pack and hold purchases and inventory related to the opening of 18 net new stores since the 


end of the third quarter last year. Pack and hold inventory represented 18% of total inventory at the 


end of the third quarter vs. 12% last year.”


One Year Later, in the Q3’15 Press Release, Burlington Revised Pack and Hold Percentage Downward 


Without Explanation


“Merchandise Inventories were $934.0 million vs. $899.9 million at the end of the third quarter last year. 


This includes an increase in pack and hold inventory of approximately $11 million vs. last year. 


Pack and hold inventory represented 14% of inventory at quarter end versus 12% last year. 


Comparable store inventory decreased 7% compared with the third quarter last year.”


Pay very close attention. Burlington retroactively revised its disclosure for pack and hold inventory; at best an 


error, at worse evidence of weak controls over financial reporting and accounting manipulation. Also, remember 


that Burlington excludes buying and distribution costs from gross margin and that it stopped disclosing 


inventory turnover (inclusive of warehouses) which is where pack and hold inventory resides.  


Here’s why the math doesn’t add up: 18% of $899.9= $162.0m of pack and hold 


inventory in Q3’14 and 14% of $934.0 = $130.8m in Q3’15. Pack and hold inventory thus 


fell by $31.2m, yet Burlington says it increased by $11m.

Warning: Shrinkage Estimates Now Rising


“During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 we recorded shrinkage adjustments of $7.5 million, $5.7 million 


and $2.8 million, respectively, as a result of actual shrink being less than what we had estimated.”


(Source: S-1 IPO Filing, p. 84)


“During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 we recorded shrinkage adjustments of $3.8 million, $7.5 million 


and $5.7 million respectively, as a result of actual shrink being less than what we had estimated.”


(Source: 10-K, p. 45)


“During the fourth quarter of each of Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 we recorded shrinkage adjustments of $10.0 million, 


$3.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, as a result of actual shrink being less than what we had estimated.”


(Source: 10-K, p. 50)


Coincidence or Not? Now That Its Biggest Investor Has Liquidated Shrinkage Losses Occur


“Typically, estimates are used to record inventory shrinkage at retail stores for the first three quarters of a fiscal year. Actual physical 


inventories are typically conducted annually during the second or fourth quarter to calculate actual shrinkage. While we make


estimates on the basis of the best information available to us at the time the estimates are made, over accruals or under accruals of 


shrinkage may be identified as a result of the physical inventory counts, requiring adjustments. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 


2015, we recorded a shrinkage adjustments loss of $3.5 million as a result of actual shrink being more than what we had 


estimated.  During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, we recorded shrinkage adjustments gains of $10.0 million and 


$3.8 million, respectively, as a result of actual shrink being less than what we had estimated.” (Source: 10-K, p.40)


Shrinkage (Theft) assumptions for merchandise are open to estimation by management. We observe that 


Burlington is now disclosing shrinkage losses higher than estimated post Bain’s share liquidation.

Reclassifying Loss Prevention Expenses


“Store payroll as a percentage of net sales measures our ability to manage our payroll in accordance with increases or 


decreases in net sales. The method of calculating store payroll varies across the retail industry. As a result, our store 


payroll as a percentage of net sales may differ from other retailers. We define store payroll as regular and overtime payroll


for all store personnel as well as regional and territory personnel, exclusive of payroll charges related to corporate and 


warehouse employees. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2014, we changed our definition of store payroll to exclude 


payroll associated with our loss prevention team. These costs are now included in our product sourcing costs 


which are included in the line item “Selling, General and Administrative Expenses” in our Consolidated 


Statements of Operations. This change aligns our external reporting of store payroll with how the metric is 


reviewed internally by senior management. Under the current definition, store payroll as a percentage of net sales was 


8.8% during Fiscal 2014 compared with 9.1% during Fiscal 2013 and 9.7% during Fiscal 2012. Under the previous 


definition, store payroll as a percentage of net sales was 9.2% during Fiscal 2014 compared with 9.5% during Fiscal 2013 


and 10.2% during Fiscal 2012. The improvement in store payroll as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the 


benefit from efficiencies realized in our stores as we continue to simplify operating procedures and improve the execution 


within store operations..” (Source: 10-K, p. 35)


It doesn’t make sense to Spruce Point why costs related to its Loss Prevention Team are no longer store 


payroll costs, but now part of “Product Sourcing”

Warning: Irrefutable Evidence of 
Burlington’s Low Quality EPS


Burlington Receives $40m State Tax Credit From the GrowNJ Program Administered by the NJEDA


 In July 2012, Burlington received state tax incentives to retain and create jobs in NJ, and to build a new 180,000 sqft 


corporate office. These tax credits were intended to reduce state income tax.


Burlington Discloses Sale of State Tax Credits in Q1’2016 (May 2016) As Other Income


 From the 10-Q:  “Other income, net (consisting of investment income, gains and losses on disposition of assets, 


breakage income and other miscellaneous items) increased $3.1 million, primarily driven by the sale of certain 


state tax credits during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.” 


 From the Conference Call:  ”Other revenue and other income increased $1.5 million from last year to $10.4 million, 


driven by a $2.5 million benefit from New Jersey Grow Credit as a result of our expansion of our corporate 


office space in Florence, New Jersey…. Given that the use of New Jersey Grow Credit is based on New Jersey 


taxable income, any unused credits are allowed to be sold through other company. The sale of the credits is 


viewed as the sale of an asset, and consequently we reported that sale in other income.” 


Be Careful of Low Quality Earnings 


 By noon on earnings day, Investors bid up Burlington’s stock by 7% as a result of the perception it had beaten EPS 


estimates by $0.04 cents. However, without the one-time gain from the tax credit sale, the beat was just by $0.02 


cents ($2.5m gain and assuming 37.6% tax rate and 72.4m diluted shares), Burlington’s stock later gained >70% 


from May to Sept 2016 


While we’ve identified a plethora of financial disclosure and presentation concerns, nothing supports our 


concerns more strongly than uncovering primary evidence of accounting irregularities. To illustrate,


Burlington received tax credits to stay in NJ and create jobs. Recently, it disclosed it sold some of these 


credits. Investors should heavily scrutinize this transaction and consider it a low quality source of earnings.

We filed a Freedom of Information 


Request from the NJ Economic 


Development Authority (NJEDA). 


This is the official tax credit 


transfer document


Burlington sold the tax credit to 


Citibank which suggests it was a

The document was executed at the 


end of August 2015, which should 


have been reported in Q3’15 


earnings ended October 31, 2015. 


However, Burlington did not report 


the deal until Q1’16 (May 2016)

accounting by not recording the 


transaction in the period it occurred.

Estate Strategy and Deteriorating

Warning: Competitive Advantage of 
Store Size Changes Post IPO


Pre-IPO, Burlington Touts The “Competitive Advantages” of Being Large


“Our average store size is approximately 80,000 square feet, which is two to three times the size of our largest off-price competitors’ stores. 


Our larger store size has allowed us to offer more categories and substantially more breadth in each product category than our off-


price competitors and to establish ourselves as a destination for select categories, including coats, youth and baby, special-occasion 


dresses and men’s tailored apparel. We believe that our leadership in the off-price channel in select categories and our broad and diverse 


merchandise offering allow our stores to attract customers from beyond their local trade areas.” (Source: S-1 Filing, p. 1)


“We believe the size of our typical store represents a competitive advantage. Our average store size is approximately 80,000 square feet, 


occupying significantly more selling square footage than most off-price or specialty store competitors. Major landlords frequently seek us as a 


tenant because the appeal of our apparel merchandise profile attracts a desired customer base and because we can take on larger facilities 


than most of our competitors. In addition, we have built long-standing relationships with major shopping center developers.”  (S-1 Filing, p. 99)


Post-IPO the Story Completely Changes; Now Smaller and Smaller is Better!


CEO on Q3’13 Earnings Call:  “So we really think the sweet spot for our store going forward is 50,000 to 60,000 square feet because we 


know, we feel very confident we can operate in a 50,000 square foot box also.”


CEO on Q4’13 Earnings Call: “The stores that are 60,000 square feet or smaller, the dollar per square foot is better than the total 


average. As far as what our future looks like in terms of 60,000 square foot stores or less, we opened 11 in 2013. Our average was slightly 


over 60,000 square feet. In ’14, we’re looking at an average of around 61,000 square feet. So just to remind you, the average was around 


80,000 square feet, and we’re really looking at stores that are 50,000 to 60,000 square feet in terms of size. We just feel that they’re going 


to be much more productive.”


CEO on Q1’16 Earnings Call: Yes, we’re really comfortable with stores in the 40,000 to 50,000 range. Last year, as I said in prepared 


remarks, so this year, as I said in the prepared remarks, the average is around 51,000 square feet, it will be less than 50,000 square feet in 


terms of the new stores that we will open in 2017”


Burlington changed its story on optimal store size quickly after its IPO, and has continued to talk down the size of its 


optimal store by nearly 50%? What will the Company do with all of these big box stores?

Pay Close Attention to the Company’s 
Real Estate Strategy 


Burlington Touted its Real Estate Strategy Prominently in its IPO Prospectus (S-1, p. 4)


Enhanced Real Estate Analysis and New Store Selection Process


“We have reengineered our new store development process to utilize more sophisticated criteria for real estate site selection and to reduce 


our total new store investment. Our real estate process consists of a review of demographics, population density, cannibalization impact, 


traffic patterns, competitive dynamics, co-tenancy considerations and ease of access, in order to meet acceptable return criteria. We have 


partnered with landlords to increase the landlord funded tenant improvements in new stores and have improved our opening inventory 


to increase cash-on-cash returns. Under our enhanced real estate selection process, we opened 15 new stores in Fall 2011 and 6 new stores 


in Spring 2012, which, on average, have performed in line with their initial sales projections during their first full year of operation.”


Burlington’s dependency on leases, renewals, and landlord incentives are noted by the Company, but we 


believe underappreciated by investors as a risk to its business.  


And A Risk Factor Noted High Dependency on Leases


“We currently lease approximately 92% of our store 


locations. Most of our current leases expire at various 


dates after five or ten-year terms, the majority of which are 


subject to our option to renew such leases for several 


additional five-year periods. Our ability to renew any 


expiring lease or, if such lease cannot be renewed, our 


ability to lease a suitable alternative location, and our 


ability to enter into leases for new stores on favorable 


terms will depend on many factors, some of which may 


not be within our control

 Pre-IPO, Burlington touted the benefits of its large store format. It 


benefitted from the ability to negotiate large lease incentives from landlords 


 Deferred lease incentives accrue on the balance sheet, with incentive 


amortization running as a credit against rent expense, ultimately benefitting 


EPS. Burlington’s also runs changes in deferred rent incentives as 


increase to operating cash flow


 Burlington’s move towards a smaller store formant, and a more competitive 


real estate env’t may hinder its ability to secure lease incentives. Its 


accounts are signaling a slowdown of EPS and cash flow benefits 


from incentives. Accrued deferred lease incentives (bottom right chart) 


are now declining, and net operating cash flow benefits from rent 


incentives recently turned negative (top right chart)

Critically Analyzing Unit Economics


Burlington regularly touts its “Attractive Store Economics” as an investment highlight. However, it stopped 


disclosing the cost of its new store expansion post 2013, when it initially gave a range of $1.6m – $1.8m for its 


prototypical 80,000 sqft store ($21.25/sqft at the midpoint). 


Based on a FOIA request for a recently completed store in Delaware, Spruce Point has reason to believe that 


investors are under-appreciating the rise in new store costs, and deteriorating unit economics.


“Our new store operating model, which is based on historical 


store performance, assumes an average store size of 80,000 


gross square feet. Our average initial net investment, which 


varies by site and specific store characteristics, averages 


$1.8 million per store and consists of store build-out costs 


(net of tenant improvement allowances), pre-opening 


expenses and average first year inventory (net of payables).”  


(Source: S-1, p. 89, June 2013)


“Importantly, we received significant landlord support on 


many of our stores; and we expect that our total investment 


in new stores will average about $1.6 million and that our 


payback periods will average less than three years.”

Pay Close Attention To Language Change


In every single SEC filing since its IPO, Burlington made the statement that a vast majority of its existing 


stores had positive Adjusted EBITDA.


Recently, Burlington changed its position and no loner makes this affirmative statement!


Recent Statement on Unit Economics Since May 2016


Maintaining Focus on Unit Economics and Returns. We have adopted a market focused approach to new 


store openings with a specific focus on maximizing sales while achieving attractive unit economics and 


returns. By focusing on opening stores with attractive unit economics we are able to achieve attractive returns 


on capital and continue to grow our margins. We believe that as we continue to reduce our comparable store 


inventory, we will be able to reduce the square footage of our stores while continuing to maintain our broad 


assortment.    (Source: Q1’2016 10-Q, p. 18)


Example of All Previous 10K/10Q Statements on Unit Economics Going Back to its IPO Included the 


Bolded Statement Below


Maintaining Focus on Unit Economics and Returns. We have adopted a market focused approach to new 


store openings with a specific focus on maximizing sales while achieving attractive unit economics and 


returns. This focus is demonstrated by the fact that the vast majority of our existing stores had 


positive Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2015. By focusing on opening stores with attractive unit economics we 


are able to achieve attractive returns on capital and continue to grow our margins. We believe that as we 


continue to reduce our comparable store inventory, we will be able to reduce the square footage of our stores 


while continuing to maintain our broad assortment. (Source 10K, p. 24)

Based on our FOIA request for a recently completed store in Dover, Delaware we found construction cost 


for a 50,000 sqft location to be $1.5 million (most likely understated for conservatism). Making some 


conservative assumptions for new store inventory, pre-opening expenses, and tenant allowances we 


estimate unit economics costs have risen 17% – 45% from initial guidance in 2013.

Dead Retailer Walking: Failure looms large at a sample of some recent Burlington site selections. 


Burlington’s Flagship New York City Store (former Filene’s Basement now bankrupt)


“Filene’s left the three-story space at the south end of Union Square vacant late last year after its parent company, Sym’s, filed for 


bankruptcy and closed two dozen locations, including another Manhattan outpost on the Upper West Side. That 92,000-square-


foot retail spot will become Burlington’s flagship location in Manhattan.” (Source: DNAinfo, April 2012) 


Burlington Enters Holland, MI (former Sears)


“Burlington Coat Factory will be an anchor tenant for the center, leasing 50,000 square feet in the former Sears store at the north 


end of the building.”  (Source: March 2016, Mlive.com)


Burlington enters Hemet, CA (former Wal-Mart)


“The site has been vacant since 2004, when Wal-Mart built a larger store nearby. The new project introduced by developers to city


planners in January was welcome news to the city council who had waited since 2004 when Wal-Mart closed the Florida Avenue 


store to see new tenants move in. The store over the 12 years it was closed, began to deteriorate, the landscaping began to die 


off and it became a temporary haven for some homeless that had to be moved by police.” (Source: Valley News, Sept 2016)


Burlington Enters Dover, DE (former Kmart)


“Also, the mayor confirmed a Burlington clothing store will occupy about 80 percent of the old Kmart, which closed in July 2014.”  


(Source: Doverpost, March 2016)


Burlington Enters Colonial Heights, VA (former Kmart)


“The landlord, Roslyn Farms Associates LLC, took back the Kmart anchor spot this spring when the retailer closed its store. The 


landlord subsequently demolished the 104,228-square-foot building. That space is now being redeveloped for junior anchors, with 


Burlington occupying a major portion.” (Source: Richmond.com, Sept 2015)

Background on Burlington’s CEO


 Under Kingsbury’s Leadership, Filene’s (May Dept. Stores Largest Segment) Showed Declining Sales Every Year


 May was acquired by Federated Dept. Stores in 2005. In 2006, Filene’s was merged with Macy’s and phased out the name


 Kingsbury Has Recruited Various Executives From Filene’s To Work At Burlington: 


 Dec 2009:  Burlington hired Michael Geraghty as COO of Burlington commencing Jan 4, 2010. According to his bio: “Mr. 


Geraghty served as the Chairman of Filene's/Kaufman's, a division of Macy’s-Federated, from September 2004 to May 2006.  


Mr. Geraghty served as Chief Financial Officer of Filene's/Kaufman's from November 1996 to August 2004.”


 Red Flag: Burlington failed to disclose that Mr. Geraghy was named Chief Financial Officer and Administrative Officer of 


Fortunoff in Dec 2006, which later filed for bankruptcy in Feb 2009 due to a “severe liquidity crisis”


 Dec 2010:  Geraghty abruptly resigned from Burlington a year later citing “personal reasons”


 Nov 2015:  Burlington hired Rick Seeger as EVP of Planning & Allocation and MIO


• “Mr. Seeger served in various management positions with The May Department Stores Company from 1994 through 2006, 


most recently as Senior Vice President, General Merchandise Manager of the Filene's division from 1999 through 2006”


• Mr. Seeger later followed Kingsbury to Kohl’s (see next slide): where he served as Executive Vice President, General 


Merchandise Manager of Kohl's Corporation from 2006 through November 2014”


 Feb 2008:  Kingsbury is also joined by Fred Hand, EVP of Stores. According to his bio: “From 2001 to 2006, Mr. Hand served 


as Senior Vice President, Stores and Visual Merchandising of Filene's Department Stores”


According to his bio, Kingsbury was the President and CEO of Filene’s / Kaufmann’s from 2000 – 2006.

Background on Burlington’s CEO (Cont’d)


 Prior To Joining Burlington Stores, Thomas Kingsbury Was Employed By Kohl’s Corp. From 2006 - 2008


 May 2006: Kohl’s names Kingsbury SVP, and will oversee “store operations and information technology”


 Sept 2007:  Kingsbury was previously responsible for “merchandise presentation, store administration, store operations, 


information technology, and e-commerce,” and “will now oversee marketing, business development, e-commerce and 


information technology”


 Dec 2008: Kingsbury named CEO of Burlington, he most recently oversaw marketing, business development, e-commerce 


and information technology


 Spruce Point Observation:   Kingsbury was subtly removed from store administration, operations and merchandise at 


Kohl’s and his current bio continues to omit any role or involvement with Kohl’s merchandising or store operations


 On August 4th 2011, Kohl’s Warned Investors It Had Identified Errors Related to “Complex” Lease Accounting And 
Restated Results from 2008 – 2011. 


 Warning: “On August 9, 2011, the audit committee of Kohl’s board of directors, in consultation with management, concluded 


that because of these errors, investors should no longer rely upon the financial statements”


 The principal factor:  “that contributed to this material weakness was the misinterpretation of complex standards related to 


leases where we, as the lessee, are involved in asset construction pursuant to ASC 840……We are often involved 


extensively in the construction of leased stores. In many cases, we are responsible for construction cost over runs or 


construct non-standard tenant improvements (e.g. roof or HVAC systems). As a result of this involvement, we are deemed 


the “owner” for accounting purposes during the construction period, so are required to capitalize the construction costs on 


our Balance Sheet…“Upon completion of the project, we perform a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC 840, Leases, 


to determine if we can remove the assets from our Balance Sheet. In many of our leases, we are reimbursed a portion of 


the construction costs via adjusted rental and/or cash payments or have terms which fix the rental payments for a significant


percentage of the leased asset’s economic life. These items are generally considered “continuing involvement” which 


precludes us from derecognizing the assets from our Balance Sheet when construction is complete”


Kingsbury joined Kohl’s in 2006. Why was he removed from store operations and administration at 


Kohl’s and what role, if any, did he play in the complex lease arrangements that required restatement?

Background on Burlington’s CFO and Chief 
Accounting Officer Raise Potential Concerns


Burlington’s key financial executives, including its CFO and Chief Accounting Officer, held leadership roles 


with companies requiring financial restatement. 


 Prior to joining Burlington and later becoming CFO, Marc Katz held the CFO role at A.C. Moore (Nasdaq: ACMR), a 


specialty retailer of Arts & Crafts based in Berlin, NJ:


 September 2006:  Marc D. Katz joins A.C. Moore as CFO: “Marc Katz has proven financial expertise through his experience as the 


controller of a large multi-store retail company, in addition to a strong background in retail information systems," said Rick A. Lepley, 


A.C. Moore's Chief Executive Officer. “


 Oct 2007: ACMR disclose internal review of its inventory accounting methods tied to inventory valued under the retail 


inventory method (RIM); based on prelim. data, total inventory is estimated to be overvalued by $15-$25m from 12/31/04 – 6/30/07


 March 2008:  Files 10-K and discloses material weakness of internal financial controls and restatement of financial results. FY 2006 


EPS results restated from $0.12 cents to a loss of ($0.02) cents


 June 2008: Katz resigns as ACMR’s CFO and in July 2008 Katz appointed EVP and Chief Accounting Officer at Burlington


 Dec 2009:  Katz assumes role of EVP of Merchandise Planning and Allocation and relinquishes accounting role 


 Jan 2015:  Katz, EVP of Merchandise Support and IT, appointed EVP and CFO

Supply Chain) and Dennis Hodgson (served as ACMR’s SVP and CIO) and now holds the same role at BURL


 According to a Philadelphia Inquirer article “A.C. Moore Crafting a Turnaround,” an analyst said, “The stores, and especially the 


supply-chain infrastructure, had really been neglected by the prior management team for a long time”


 Prior to being appointed SVP and Chief Accounting Officer at Burlington, John Crimmins III was CFO at Timberland 


(NYSE: TBL), a retailer of men’s and women’s clothing apparel, accessories and footwear


 March 2007:  Crimmins appointed CFO. An executive with the company since 2002, Crimmins also has held positions as corporate 


controller and chief accounting officer. 


 April 2007: Timberland delays Q1 earnings, audit committee says financials from 2001-2006 cannot be relied upon as a 


result of accounting matters related to derivative accounting


 Sept 2009:  Crimmins leaves Timberland


 March 2011: Burlington appoints Crimmins as SVP and Chief Accounting Officer

Warning: Clawback Provision For Fraud By 
Management Added Recently


“In February 2016, the Committee adopted a compensation recoupment policy, 


providing that, in the event of a financial restatement or significant financial harm 


to the Company arising out of willful actions, including without limitation fraud or 


intentional misconduct, or gross negligence by any officer of the Company, the 


Committee shall have the discretion and authority to determine the appropriate 


action to take, which may include requiring relinquishment of previously awarded 


equity-based compensation and/or repayment of previously paid incentive cash 


compensation.”


Source: Proxy Statement, p. 30, filed April 1, 2016


Burlington’s Audit Committee recently adopted a “clawback” provision which allows the Company to 


reclaim compensation if actions by management result in the event of a financial restatement or 


significant financial harm to the Company arising out of willful actions, including without limitation 


fraud. Coincidence or not: The policy was adopted in the same quarter it booked the tax credit.

Subtle Change of Incentive Structure 
Signaling Earnings Slow Down?


Burlington’s Recent Share Repurchase Programs: Shareholder Friendly With a Footnote (1)


 In June 2015, during its Q1’15 earnings announcement, Burlington announced its first $200m repurchase program


 The company announced an additional $200m program during its Q3’15 earnings announcement, 


 At the time of both announcements, Burlington’s share price had returned almost 0% for the entire year


 By reducing its share count, Burlington can improve its earnings per share, while masking slow down in earnings


(1) Management is now paid on a per share metric, thus rewarding them for repurchasing shares, and 


potentially signaling to investors a view that net income growth will slow


“As our performance is predominately measured on the basis of Adjusted Net Income per share rather than Adjusted 


Net Income, the Committee in February 2016 approved replacing the Adjusted Net Income portion of the Financial 


Component with Adjusted Net Income per share commencing with our 2016 Annual Incentive Plan. The Adjusted Net 


Income per share and comparable store sales targets for our 2016 Annual Incentive Plan were approved by the Board in 


February 2016.”    Source: Proxy Statement, p. 39, filed April 1, 2016


Burlington recently disclosed a subtle change in a key financial target used to determine 50% of 


management’s annual incentive target. 


We believe the change signals to investors a slow down in its earnings growth rate, and gives management 


credit for repurchasing shares.  


Rounding Error or Worse? Burlington beats its target by just $0.50m,Then Changes The Target for 2016

Sales Per Total Sq. FootageOperating Cash Flow Per Total Sq. Footage 


The market values Burlington like a best of breed retailer like Ross and TJX. 


Based on our analysis, Burlington significantly lags peers in its ability to drive 


sales and operating cash flow on a per employee and square footage basis (1). 


Ever Since its IPO, Burlington has sold investors on its ability to “Drive 


Operating Leverage,” but in our view it remains illusive (Source; S-1, p. 7)


 Investors have been cheering headline SSS and EPS gains, but digging a little deeper into 


key operational metrics, we are concerned that Burlington may never close its performance 


gap to peers


 Recent revenues per employee (right hand chart) have been trending downward in the past 


few years, and are well below key peers ROSS and TJX


 We’ve also analyzed Burlington’s ability to drive sales and operating cash flow through its 


entire distribution footprint vs. peers. Burlington has invested significant capex resources into 


IT, supply chain, distribution facilities and a new HQ, yet has seen minimal improvements

We analyzed Burlington’s 


current footprint vs. Ross 


and TJX’s footprint when 


each retailer was at ~1,000 


stores. To reach 1,000 stores 


nationally, we believe 


Burlington will have to invest 


further resources in 


distribution centers, along 


with greater resources into 


supply chain technology.


We observe that Burlington 


has distribution centers on 


each coast, without any 


presence in the 


Midwest/South or Central US


Based on our conversation 


with a retail technology and 


supply chain industry expert, 


the capital costs necessary 


could be upwards of $500m 


vs. $200m estimated 


expenditures by Burlington 


(not including further 


distribution centers).

Warning: Capex Costs Rising Driven By Frequent 
Revisions to “Supply Chain Initiatives”


Q2’16:  “We estimate that we will spend approximately $160 million, net of approximately $30 million of landlord allowances, 


in capital expenditures during Fiscal 2016, including $85 million to $90 million, net of the previously mentioned landlord 


allowances, for store expenditures (new stores, store refreshes and remodels and other store expenditures). In addition, we 


estimate that we will spend approximately $24 million to support our supply chain initiatives, with the remaining capital 


used to support our information technology and other business initiatives.” Source: 10Q, p. 30 


Q1’16  “We estimate that we will spend $150 million to $160 million, net of approximately $30 million of landlord allowances, 


in capital expenditures during Fiscal 2016, including $85 million to $90 million, net of the previously mentioned landlord 


allowances, for store expenditures (new stores, store refreshes and remodels and other store expenditures). In addition, we 


estimate that we will spend approximately $22 million to support our supply chain initiatives, with the remaining capital 


used to support our information technology and other business initiatives.”   Source: 10Q, p. 22 


FY 2015  “We estimate that we will spend $145 million to $150 million, net of approximately $30 million of landlord allowances, 


in capital expenditures during Fiscal 2015, including $85 million to $90 million, net of the previously mentioned landlord 


allowances, for store expenditures (new stores, store refreshes and remodels and other store expenditures). In addition, we 


estimate that we will spend approximately $17 million to support our supply chain initiatives, with the remaining capital 


used to support our information technology and other business initiatives.”   Source 10K, p. 37 filed March 15, 2016


Goldman Sachs Conf (Sept 9, 2016):  “Supply chain, as Tom mentioned, spent $100 million over the last three years, $25 


million was this year, 2016. Next year is probably going to be higher than that only because we continue to add 


capacity and efficiencies to our distribution centers. So, we see a little bit more next year. But that's the one area that 


we see a continual spend in.”


On March 24, 2016 Mike Metheny, Burlington’s EVP of Supply Chain, Corp. Services and Asset Protection, enters into a 


10b5-1 to begin liquidating shares. 


To illustrate our point, Burlington’s management doesn’t appear to have a handle on its spending plans, and has consistently 


revised spending plans this year for “supply chain initiatives” while its head executive starts selling stock.

Software Amortization Capitalized Software Costs Ratio: Capitalization / D&A


Warning: Evidence Suggesting Aggressive 
Software Development Cost Capitalization


To make matters worse, based on our analysis of Burlington’s financials and field research, it appears that 


Burlington may be aggressively capitalizing IT, software and supply chain technology costs on its balance 


sheet, enabling earnings overstatement.


Capitalized Costs > Amortization Costs Book Value of Internally Developed Software


$ in millions


• During our research, we learned that most of Burlington’s IT systems were historically home grown and built ad hoc over the years


• We estimate Burlington has spent more than $200m on IT hardware/software since 2010, much of it going towards standardizing 


its platforms (Oracle) upgrading its infrastructure, implementing disaster recovery programs, improving data warehousing, and


providing more information to vendors and merchants for supply chain improvements


• A majority of these costs have been capitalized and are being amortized over 3-5 years. After software has been developed, 


tested, and implemented, post implementation costs must be expensed; Burlington has never disclosed how much it expenses


• We observe that Burlington’s software capitalization / amortization ratio has generally been excess of 1:1, which may suggest


aggressive use of capitalization

The discount retailers are trading above their historical multiple ranges and near all-time highs. However, 


we believe threats have increased from the entrants of new competitors, and the continued disruption of the 


market from Amazon.  Burlington trades as if it were a best-of-breed retailer, but in our opinion, we believe it 


should trade at a discount to peers, and closer to the long-term industry average multiple given that we 


expect a moderation of its recent financial performance.

Spruce Point View vs. Street View Spruce Point Price Target Reference Ranges


Spruce Point believes a moderation of financial performance in 2017 will result in expectations being 


reduced. Furthermore, in our opinion, Burlington’s valuation multiple should contract to reflect the reality 


that it is not a best-of-breed off-price retailer, and should trade at a discount to peers as a result of our 


documented concerns about its financial presentation and accounting practices.
