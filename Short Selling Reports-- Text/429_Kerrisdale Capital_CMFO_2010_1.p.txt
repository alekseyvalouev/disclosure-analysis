China Marine
Food: There's
Something Fishy
Going On
Jun. 1, 2010 9:27 AM ET16 comments | Includes: CMFO, C…


Please read the disclosures at the bottom of this article.


In my previous two articles, I’ve written about how several Seeking Alpha
contributors have used locally filed Chinese financial statements to provide
compelling evidence that certain U.S.-listed Chinese companies may be frauds.


All foreign-invested enterprises must file financial statements with the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce branch of the Chinese government.
These documents are not available electronically; rather, a local Chinese
citizen must go to the appropriate local branch to access these documents.
Fortunately, certain third-party credit agencies provide this service to
foreigners for a fee.


In previous articles, I compared the SAIC and SEC financial statements of
YUII, CSKI and LIWA. The numbers for YUII matched, whereas they did not for
CSKI and LIWA.


In this post, I compare the SAIC and SEC financial statements for China
Marine Food Group Limited (NYSEMKT:CMFO). The numbers do not match.


This provides evidence that China Marine Food Group Limited may be a fraud.
In addition, I note additional data points that raise questions about whether
CMFO’s financial statements accurately represent the financial condition of the
underlying business.


I also present the response of the chief financial officer of CMFO to a question
on why the SAIC and SEC documents don’t match, and provide my opinion on
his response.

Organizational Structure


Before discussing CMFO’s SAIC statements, let’s discuss the legal
organizational structure of CMFO. This is important because each subsidiary
files separate SAIC financial statements. Chinese GAAP does not consolidate
subsidiaries, and therefore it’s important to determine which subsidiary
generates most of the company’s revenue. We can then compare the SAIC
financial statements of this main operating subsidiary with the SEC filings.


Here is CMFO’s legal organizational structure, from an annual report. We use
the 2008 org structure, because we are comparing their 2006, 2007 and 2008
financials. 2009 SAIC filings are typically not filed until midyear. 





 
 
 
The U.S.-based, publicly listed entity is China Marine Food Group Limited. Nice
Enterprise Trading H.K. Co., Limited, its subsidiary, is based out of Hong Kong.
Nice Enterprise has one subsidiary, Shishi Rixiang Marine Foods Co., Ltd
(“Rixiang”), which is based out of China. Rixiang is a foreign invested
enterprise that owns two other subsidiaries: (1) Shishi Huabao Mingxiang

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/74115-china-marine-food-theres-something-fishy-going-on 3/18


Foods Co., Ltd. (“Mingxiang”)and (2) Shishi Huabao Jixiang Water Products Co.
Ltd (“Jixiang”).
Where are the operations primarily held? Rixiang. We know this by the
following disclosures in the 10K:


"With effect from January 1, 2005, Rixiang acquired the business operations of
Mingxiang, which subsequently became a property holding company. Rixiang
was incorporated as a FIE and was granted the tax incentives for FIEs, and
was exempted from income tax for 2005 and 2006... Jixiang is also a property
holding company and is not subject to tax."


Elsewhere throughout the report, the Company also makes clear that Rixiang
generates all of the Company's operating revenue, such as "All of our
production is undertaken by our subsidiary, Rixiang" in the "Our Products"
section.


From the above disclosure, we also know that Rixiang is an FIE. As an FIE,
Rixiang must file accurate annual financial statements with the Administration
for Industry and Commerce branch of the Chinese government.


SAIC vs. SEC financial statements


I have had a local third-party credit agency go to the local AIC office in
Rixiang’s jurisdiction and photocopy their financial statements.


They are here, in Chinese. And here, translated in English.


The figures in the attached documents are in Remnimbi. In the chart below,
we convert the Remnimbi to US dollars, and compare key financial line items
with CMFO’s SEC financials:

As we can see, CMFO reports much higher numbers in its SEC filings than its
SAIC filings. In its SAIC filings, the company generated only $2mm of revenue
in 2007 and $7mm in 2008. In its SEC filings, it allegedly generated $36mm in
2007 and $49mm in 2008.
Compare that with Yuhe, which generated $21mm and $34mm of revenue in
2007 and 2008 in its SAIC filings, compared to $22mm and $36mm of revenue
in 2007 and 2008 in its SEC filings.


As we discussed earlier, Rixiang is the primary operating subsidiary of CMFO. It
is also an FIE. As a result, Rixiang’s financial statements should accurately
reflect CMFO’s SEC financial statements.


But they don’t.


The CMFO’s response to the discrepancies is the following, based on an email:

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/74115-china-marine-food-theres-something-fishy-going-on 5/18


"It's a formality in China to file the operating figures with SAIC on an annual
basis. We used to hire an independent agent firm to do the filing on our behalf
as the process itself is quite tedious though. Guess the agent firm has used
kinds of outdated figures to do the filing and thus discrepancies appeared as a
result.


Since there won't be any anticipated influence or harm over those inaccurate
historical figures with SAIC, we don’t believe it’s necessary to re-file the
statements. That said, we will switch to another sizeable agent firm to do the
2009 filing and will make sure the numbers so filed are consistent with our
book record going forward."


We’ve been down this road with CSKI. The CFO of CSKI said a similar thing in
2009 when asked why CSKI’s SAIC numbers didn’t match the SEC numbers.
We have yet to see matching financial statements.


What is actually going on? My belief is that CMFO is fabricating its SEC
financial statements. FIEs in China must file accurate audited financial
statements. I’ve spoken with dozens of accountants and CFOs of verifiably
legitimate Chinese companies, and they have all confirmed this. It’s
understandable to have small differences between SAIC and SEC filings, due to
subsidiary consolidation and Chinese vs US GAAP. But CMFO’s 2008 SAIC
revenue was 85% lower than its 2008 SEC revenue. That’s not due to GAAP
accounting differences.


In my opinion, fraudulent Chinese companies like CSKI and CMFO are making
up numbers out of thin air. To fool their accountants, the companies are using
sophisticated and undisclosed related party and off-balance sheet transactions
to inflate financial statements. They are using phony bank statements to fake
cash. It’s unclear how exactly they are doing it. But the differences between
the SAIC and SEC numbers provides compelling evidence that they are finding
a way to do it. After all, there is a lot of money to be made – companies like
CSKI and CMFO have raised $25mm+ each in secondary equity offerings or
private placements, all for dubious purposes. If they are indeed fraudulent,
these funds are likely being siphoned to a large degree to personal bank
accounts.

These are shocking allegations, yes. But the world of Chinese reverse-merger
smallcaps is a shocking one, and given the very low valuation multiples, it’s
clear that many other investors suspect similar wrongdoings.


Other Signs that CMFO is a Fraud


The main thrust of our argument that CMFO is a fraud is that the Company’s
SAIC and SEC filings don’t match. But as we did with our two posts on YUII,
CSKI and LIWA, we’re going to highlight other signs that make us concerned
about trusting CMFO’s SEC financial statements.


Again, we’ll compare CMFO with YUII.


 
Audit history


In our last post, we explained that Yuhe’s attempt to upgrade to Grant
Thornton was a welcome contrast to the audit history of many other Chinese
companies that have gone public via reverse mergers.


CMFO’s auditor, ZYCPA Company Ltd., is equally as questionable as LIWA’s and
CSKI’s auditors. It is not listed in the top 100 global audit firms. It has 2
partners and 25 personnel, per its web site. Given that CMFO alleges to have
generated $70mm of revenue and $15mm of net income in 2009, ZYCPA
appears to be a woefully inadequate auditor for the company.


If CMFO is making up its numbers, it would certainly find an easier time
defrauding one of the two partners at ZYCPA than a top-5 audit firm like Grant
Thornton.


 
Capital Raise


As we discussed in our last post, a key thing to monitor when examining
whether reverse-merger Chinese companies are frauds is to see how much
capital they’ve raised via secondary private placements and equity offerings.


Naturally, we have no issue with capital raises. Companies need to raise funds
to grow. But with Chinese companies that have gone public through reverse
mergers, we see a tendency to raise large sums of money at large discounts to
current stock prices, with dilutive warrants attached, and for dubious

purposes. Indeed, if a company is fraudulent, a capital raise is the primary
goal of creating a China-based fraud in the first place. The funds are taken
from U.S. investors and deposited in the personal bank accounts of the
organizers of the fraud.


With YUII, we have not seen any dilutive and/or unnecessary secondary
offerings thus far.


With CMFO, we saw a $30mm private placement on January 20, 2010. The
purpose was: “The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering
for working capital and general corporate purposes.” From its SEC filings, the
company allegedly had $7mm of cash at December 31, 2009 and has
generated positive free cash flow (measured by cash flow from operations less
capital expenditures) for each of the past three years. It’s unclear why the
company needed additional cash.


The dilution was not especially egregious though, and the new shares were
issued at only a 9% discount to the prior 10-day trading average and a 12%
discount to the prior 30-day trading average.


Disclosures


At the time of writing, I and affiliated entities have a short position in CMFO
and a long position in YUII. I intend to trade in these securities subsequent to
this post within the next three days. I may also initiate positions in other
stocks mentioned in this article, including CSKI and LIWA.

your research. It was used to purchase the
land for and build a cold storage facility for
frozen fish, and to acquire Hi-Power Algae,
a drink maker that is doing relatively well
in China (as gross as algae drink sounds).
Beyond that, your critique consists of: (1)
2 years ago, before CMFO filed with the
SEC, they understated revenue in China
(note your figures end in 2008) and (2)
they need a more credible auditor. I agree
with #2, but think the rest of your
"critique" is weak and ill-informed.

In addition, the Hudson Securities
analyst Julie Chen has been over to see
this company and has "checked" it out,
describing in great detail the product
and where she has seen it in many
many stores.  
Also, today Brean Murrey initiated this
company with a buy rating, having been
over there and "kicked the tires" Many
analysts and many people have seen
the operations of this company,
including the fish processing plants,
packaging plants, and distribution
warehouses. The product is well known
in supermarkets. Something is fishy
about this chinesecompanyanalyst
IMHO.

that it generated approximately
$10-$15mm of sales, not the $73mm it
reported in its SEC filings.


As for research reports by Hudson
Securities or Brean Murray, I don’t have
specific comments on those firms or
analysts at this point. But as a general
rule, I don’t think that research reports
on Chinese RTO smallcaps written by
3rd tier investment banks are worth the
paper they’re printed on. These firms
produce research reports mainly to help
their investment banking teams win
equity offering mandates. Whether
those equity offerings are for real or
fraudulent companies is not of primary
concern to them. Their primary concern
is whether they can get the deals done,
and if they can, they generally initiate
research coverage on client firms.


All the power to them. This is a
business. Investors who look to Brean
Murray for guidance on whether to buy
CMFO in 2010 are no different from
investors who looked to S&P for
guidance on whether to buy BBB
subprime RMBS securities in 2006. Or
investors who looked to Morgan Stanley
on whether to buy musicmaker.com in
2000.


Analysts from these firms aren’t kicking
tires any more than Moody’s analysts
were kicking the tires of subprime
mortgage bonds or Henry Blodget was
kicking the tires of money-losing
dotcoms.

allegedly generating positive free cash
flow. It had enough money for the $28mm
"algae" acquisition (I'm not convinced they
were acquiring a company that was worth
$28mm, as opposed to finding a way to
siphon off $20mm+ into personal bank
accounts), as well as a cold storage facility.
At the end of March 31, 2010, having
already paid for the acquisition, the
company had $47mm of cash according to
its SEC filings. So they didn't need the
cash for the acquisition and cold storage
facility.


Again, my opinion is that most of this is
fictional. The cash balance at the end of
2009; the cash balance at the end of
March 31, 2010; and the algae business
are all mostly fictional and only a bit true.
But in this hypothetical scenario of the
Company having $32mm of cash at the
end of December 31, 2009 and wanting to
buy a $28mm algae drinks business, the
company didn't need to raise equity
capital. Its hypothetical $47mm of cash at
the end of March 31, 2010 demonstrates
that.


I don't have the SAIC filings for 2009
because they're not filed until midyear
2010.


CMFO completed its reverse merger on
November 17, 2007. Therefore, it was a
Foreign Invested Enterprise before 2008
and its 2008 SAIC financials should match
its 2008 SEC financials if the company was
accurately representing itself in its U.S.
filings.


I'm not ill-informed. CMFO's SEC financial
statements are ill-informing.

At the end of 3Q09, they had $31M cash
(not at the end of 2009), spent $28M to
acquire drink company during 4Q. At the
end of 2009, they had $7M cash. But they
need to pay the cold storage cost of $20M
through 2010. It is not enough at that
time if they did not raise fund. Given the
company generated CFO less than $6M, if
you expect they can generate about $10M
operating cash flow this year, it still not
enough to pay down the cold storage cost.

The company generated (allegedly)
$15mm of cash in Q1 and had
(allegedly) $47mm of cash on its
balance sheet as of 3/31/10, after the
acquisition closed. The cold storage
facility costs $20mm. Based on the SEC
financials, they don't look like they
needed the cash. And if they needed
$10mm to cover a shortfall, levering up
this business by $10mm is the rational
response.


Regardless, this is a moot point. Given
that I think that the SEC financial
statements are fabricated, it's simply an
oversight on the company's part to say
that the cold storage facility costs

$20mm to build. They should have just
said that it's $30mm to build and used
that as reason to raise equity.


The core thesis is that the SEC and
SAIC financials don't match. CMFO is
falsifying one set of its financial
statements. It’s my opinion that in
cases where the SAIC and SEC numbers
don’t match, the Company is falsifying
its SEC financial statements. There are
severe repercussions for defrauding
one’s own government. There are no, or
few, repercussions for a Chinese
company defrauding foreign investors or
American regulators. From a Chinese
company’s perspective, the downside to
falsifying SEC financial statements is
minimal. The upside is that the
company can raise $30mm from U.S.
and foreign investors, even if the actual
underlying roasted squid / algae-drinks
business is worth a small fraction of its
U.S. market capitalization.

Author’s reply »  I'll respond to the
name-calling by providing more facts.
On my blog, I've written an FAQ on
SAIC financial statements:


tinyurl[dot]com/2eyww52


The key question to ask yourself is why
their SAIC and SEC financial statements
don't match. Both are audited. FUQI,
YUII and SOLF have provided matching
financials, among many others. Why
didn't CSKI and CMFO? They're
falsifying one set of financials - that's a
simple, indisputable fact. It's your job
to decide which one they're falsifying. Is
CMFO falsifying the financials that they
file to seven branches of their own
government, or are they falsifying the
financials that they use to get $30mm
of cash from U.S. investors?

believe it’s necessary to re-file the
statements. That said, we will switch to
another sizable agent firm to do the 2009
filing and will make sure the numbers so
filed are consistent with our book record
going forward.


1. SAIC is the authority who issues
business license which is a must for an
operating entity in China to renew on an
annual basis. Such filing process is quite
tedious as what you can expect in China
and thus lots of entities will rely on their
agent firms to get the licenses on their
behalf at an small amount of service fee.
In our case, we hired an agent firm to do
the filings for us in the past without
providing any audited figures. So even
though someone can go ask SAIC to get
the filed financial statements but in fact
these figures are not audited, and that's
why you cannot find any audited opinions
associated with these figures. In other
words, these numbers do not come from
audited reports. All we concern is whether
we can get the business license quickly
and cost effectively.


2. Obviously there's no sophisticated
verification system over the filed financial
statements by SAIC, nor any cross
checking with the tax bureaus. We can
ensure our regular filings with the tax
authorities are entirely consistent with the
SEC filings (for all prior, current and future
filings). This is also a must audit procedure
to check over all these filings are
consistent with the financial statements.


3. I personally realize such mismatch just
a couple of months ago. I had immediately
instructed my team to do the 2009 and
future filings on our own to make sure
accuracy and consistency. Since the 2009

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/74115-china-marine-food-theres-something-fishy-going-on 15/18


filing has been done for a while, I would
welcome anyone to go access these
documents from SAIC so as to confirm our
words.


4. Regarding the audit history, even
though ZYCPA is a small local firm, in fact
the 2 partners are possessed of extensive
KPMG audit experience. The firm is well
positioned to service those small to
medium sized companies in terms of
quality and up to standard audit service.
Of course we also have an attempt to
switch to a 2-tier audit firm well
addressing our investors' concern,
hopefully will be done in the second half of
this year.


5. For reasons of capital raise, our current
investors should well know about the
recent projects like cold storage facilities
and acquisition of drink business without
doubts.


Long story short, we simply pay a small
amount of fee to get the license renewal
done without headache, like lots of other
companies do in China. Going forward, we
will do the filing with SAIC on our own to
ensure consistency. There was a mistake
without checking over what the agent filed
on our behalf but definitely it's not a
fraud."

The 2009 SAIC statements match the
company’s 2009 SEC financial statements.


This by no means leads me to believe that
CMFO has been accurately representing
itself in its SEC filings. Rather, the chief
financial officer of CMFO has indicated that
he was alerted several months ago to the
fact that the historical SEC and SAIC
financial statements did not match. I
believe that as a precaution to future
allegations of fraud, such as mine, China
Marine Food made sure that the 2009 SAIC
filings matched their 2009 SEC filings. I
believe that I have overestimated the
veracity of SAIC filings in my article above.
Now I think that they can be falsified just
as SEC filings can.


The chief financial officer of CMFO
naturally has a different story, and I will let
him argue his case on his own. Investors
can then decide whether my story or his
story is the more compelling one.


The mismatch between the 2006, 2007
and 2008 SEC and SAIC financial
statements was only one element of my
case that China Marine Food is much
smaller than its SEC filings indicate. The
Company’s dubious acquisition of Xianghe
plays a more central role in my argument.


I will end with a final point. In this link
(tinyurl.com/2en28xj), I have included
comparisons of SEC and SAIC financial
statements for four companies: FUQI,
YUII, SOLF and CMFO.

I provide backup for FUQI’s and YUII’s
SAIC financial statements on my blog at
www.chinesecompanyanal..., and SOLF’s
SAIC financial statements are available at
www.waldomushman.com.


For FUQI, YUII and SOLF, the SAIC and
SEC financial statements are in the same
ballpark. But you’ll notice that the
numbers are not identical; rather, Chinese
GAAP and other reporting norms will
always result in differences between SEC
and SAIC filings. For SOLF, for instance,
2008 SAIC revenue was $809mm while
2008 SEC revenue was $712mm. Similar
differences exist in other line items as
well. But in CMFO’s 2009 filings, the
revenue, gross profit, net income, total
assets and total equity are nearly identical,
different only by a couple million dollars at
most. YUII's are fairly close as well, but
there are still more discrepancies than
CMFO's filings.


While it’s ironic, my evidence for fraud
when looking at the 2009 SAIC financial
statements is that they match the SEC
filings too closely.

Good work. For the record, I am my own
person, not a different log-in for Chinese
Company Analyst, as suggested in an
above post.


I like healthy skepticism about the Chinese
small caps. I think there are fair questions
raised here. I don't care if Chinese
Company Analyst is short on CMFO. I don't
own the stock and have decided against
buying it because I am not a trader -- I'm
an investor. And I'm not comfortable
investing in CMFO based on what I'm

reading. These are facts. Maybe I miss out
on a great company -- but CMFO isn't the
only company with great growth potential
out there. In the end, I'll sleep better.

CMFO is being audited by BDO China Li Xin
Da Hua, a respected CPA firm in China.
How can you conclude that this CPA firm
has been fooled by "so-called fraudulent"
company. I'm a CPA and an auditor myself,
and any bank accounts and balance sheet
items are thoroughly investigated before
any statement on the financial condition of
a company is made.
