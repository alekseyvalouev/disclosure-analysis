Executive Summary – Yongye 
International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: YONG) 


Yongye International, Inc. (NASDAQ: “YONG” or “Yongye” or the “Company”) is a fraud. In this Initiating 


Coverage Report, Absaroka Capital Management, LLC (“Absaroka”) will present irrefutable evidence that 


Yongye has fraudulently misrepresented its business and thus the Company is massively overvalued by 


the market at this time.  Absaroka’s concerns about Yongye include the following material issues: 


1. The $35.0mm cash acquisition of the Wuchuan Lignite Coal Project is not a legitimate 


transaction and appears to be a scheme to transfer funds out of the Company at the expense of 


public shareholders 


2. Intertwined relationships with its two largest suppliers appear to allow the Company to 


fraudulently manipulate earnings:  Wuchuan Sanda was ordered to cease production by the 


government and Wuchuan Shuntong does not supply nearly the amount of humic acid claimed 


by Yongye 


3. The $32.3mm Hebei Customer List acquisition has limited industrial logic and appears to be 


another scheme by Yongye Management to falsely manipulate earnings 


4. Yongye falsely claims Shengmingsu, its main fertilizer product, was developed by 38 scientists at 


Stanford University:  Absaroka provides a letter from Stanford University certifying it has no 


connection to Yongye’s Shengmingsu fertilizer and Yongye does not have permission to utilize 


Stanford’s name, trademark, or images in its advertising and marketing efforts. 


5. Yongye’s Shengmingsu is minimally effective for farmers and Yongye’s product claims do not 


correspond with reality 


6. The new bank loans are illogical relative to the supposed cash balance, which raises doubt about 


the reality of the $44.6mm cash balance on the unaudited 03/31/11 10-Q balance sheet 


7. Excessive management compensation relative to peers is diluting shareholder interests because 


of continued large share-based compensation grants 


8. The unsatisfactory auditor history raises grave concern about the validity of historical financials 


and forward-looking guidance 


Any of these issues on a stand-alone basis should be enough to convince public shareholders to question 


the current $4.58/share valuation and pursue the “Wall Street Walk” form of shareholder activism.

1: Yongye’s $35.0mm Acquisition of the Lignite Coal Project –Appears 


Yongye Management looted cash at the expense of public investors 
On 03/01/10, Yongye entered into an agreement with Wuchuan Shuntong Humic Acid Trading 


Company, Ltd. (“Wuchuan Shuntong”) to acquire a permit for the rights to explore, develop and produce 


lignite coal resources in Wuchuan County of the PRC for $35.0mm in cash.
1
  As of 03/31/11, $34.4mm in 


cash had been prepaid for this lignite coal project, despite the fact the Wuchuan Shuntong is not an 


operating business, has no financial resources, is still in the process of securing the government 


approvals necessary to complete the transaction and has no guarantee of permit or development 


success.
2
  Absaroka will provide documentary evidence to prove the Wuchuan Shuntong transaction is 


actually a hoax controlled by Yongye Management and was apparently created to loot $35.0mm of 


public investor’s cash out of the Company. 


To begin, the contact phone number in Wuchuan Shuntong People’s Republic of China State 


Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) filings is actually the same as Yongye’s (Figure A).  


Second, the two purported founders and owners of Wuchuan Sanda Mr. Guo Chunjiang and Ms. Wang 


Yumei, are husband and wife rural farmers with minimal education and de minimus financial resources 


(Figure B).  Third, Wuchuan Shuntong’s address listed in the SAIC filings is actually the location of the 


Wuchuan Sanda Humic Acid Factory (“Wuchuan Sanda”), a different humic acid company which is also a 


supplier of Yongye (Appendix 4).  Fourth, Wuchuan Shuntong’s SAIC financials are indicative of an 


insignificant holding company with limited capital, no revenue, and a short history of existence; not a 1
st
 


tier global coal reserve that is shovel-ready for development (Appendix 5).  Finally, Wuchuan 


government information shows Yongye, not Wuchuan Sanda, is sponsor of the Wuchuan County lignite 


coal project (Appendix 6). 


On the 03/10/11 earnings call, Yongye CFO Mr. Sam Yu perjured himself to public investors while 


attempting to allay concerns regarding the Wuchuan Shuntong transaction by stating: 


“Because of the assistance [Yongye] provided [to Wuchaun Shuntong], our contact information 


was mistakenly left on Wuchuan Shuntong’s business registration form.” 


If investors are supposed to take Mr. Yu’s explanation at face value, Absaroka challenges Yongye 


Management to explain how two farmers with minimal educations and limited financial resources, 


that were incapable of independently completing basic business registration forms, could suddenly 


own a coal project worth $35.0mm cash.  In summary, $35.0mm in cash belonging to Yongye 


shareholders has apparently evaporated in pursuit of the mirage that is the Wuchuan Shuntong lignite 


coal project.

2: Yongye’s Mysterious Supplier Relationships – Appears Yongye 


Management controls its suppliers to fraudulently manipulate earnings 
In addition to selling Yongye the Wuchuan County lignite coal project, Wuchuan Shuntong is also Yonge’s largest supplier 


of raw materials and accounted for 58% of raw materials purchased in FY10.
 3


  For FY09, Yongye’s supplies of humic acid 


(primary ingredient in Shengmingsu) were sourced from: 


“Two principal suppliers which are both in Hohhot: Wuchuan Shuntong Company and Wuchuan Sanda 


Company. Wuchuan Shuntong is our largest supplier, providing us with more than 90% of our humic acid raw 


material. Wuchuan Shuntong has dedicated one production line to us and has based its production design on 


our specific technical requirements.”
4
 


Thus, the two suppliers intertwined in the fraudulent $35.0mm lignite coal project transaction are also supposedly 


Yongye’s major suppliers, which should raise a major red flag for investors.  Moreover, channel checks and Wuchuan 


Shuntong’s SAIC financials do not indicate the firm is providing anywhere close to the volume of humic acid Yongye 


claims.  Next, Wuchuan Sanda was ordered to cease production of humic acid by the Wuchuan government in April of 


2010.  Absaroka believes these sham supplier relationships allow Yongye Management to artificially manipulate the 


reported volume and cost of its primary input, humic acid, and thus mislead auditors and investors about its actual fiscal 


results. 


Wuchuan Shuntong is a captive supplier to Yongye, as it does not appear to supply humic acid or any other products to 


other companies.  Diligent channel checks with other humic acid industry participants in northern China found no record 


of the company.  In addition, Wuchuan Shuntong’s contact information does not appear in Inner Mongolia business, 


telephone, and internet directories, which is usually a basic requirement for a viable and active business operation.  


Next, Wuchuan Shuntong’s SAIC financials show zero revenue in FY08 or FY09 (Appendix 5).  Based on Yongye’s reported 


FY09 COGS, it appears Wuchuan Shuntong should actually have reported revenue of at least $25mm in FY09 if it supplied 


the volume of humic acid claimed by Yongye Management.   


Yongye’s second supplier, Wuchuan Sanda, was ordered by the Wuchuan County government to shut down its illegal, 


small sized humic acid manufacturing facility because of heavy pollution and excessive energy consumption (Figure C).  


By 04/25/10, Wuchuan Sanda was ordered to cease production and the state utility provider was instructed to cancel 


electricity service to the plant.  Also, since 04/25/10, there is no indication that Wuchuan Sanda has relocated its 


production equipment or otherwise been able to restart humic acid production. 


As of 03/31/11, Yongye had advanced $12.5mm in cash deposits to suppliers, which is incremental to the $34.4mm cash 


prepayment for lignite coal project.
 5


  As basic humic acid is a commodity and readily available from numerous suppliers, 


Absaroka finds it dubious that Yongye must advance such significant amount of cash (54.5% of 1Q11 COGS) to its 


suppliers.  This is another significant concern regarding Yongye’s relationships with its suppliers. 


Yongye has attempted to allay concerns regarding its suppliers by recently indicating Wuchuan Shuntong also runs a 


trading business and is actually thus able to source the volume of raw materials claimed.  However, this excuse is not 


logical because 1) Wuchuan Shuntong supposedly dedicated one of its production lines to Yongye in order to meet its 


technical specifications; 2) Yongye utilizes a proprietary production processes for Shengmingsu; 3) Yongye considers its 


manufacturing process a trade-secret (i.e. it has no patent protection) and is thus incentivized to share its production 


requirements with as few parties as necessary.  In addition, Yongye’s excuse that Wuchuan Shuntong and Wuchuan 


Sanda are actually run by the same team does not make sense because the suppliers are presented as separate 


companies in Yongye’s SEC filings and even their combined actual production capacity could not meet the volume of raw 


materials supposedly consumed by Yongye.

3:  $32.3mm Hebei Customer List Acquisition – Limited industrial logic 


and appears to be another scheme to manipulate earnings 
On 06/21/11, Yongye announced an agreement to acquire the Shengmingsu distribution network in Hebei 


Province, comprised solely of a customer list, from a provincial level distributor for $32.3mm ($3.0mm in cash 


and 3.6mm newly issued shares, subject to a six-month lock-up).
 6


  However, Absaroka cannot find any 


information on the supposed provincial level distributor and thus strongly believes the transaction is a 


scheme to increase earnings of the business by subsidizing operations with a cash in-flow from the purported 


investment. 


As Hebei province has been a core market for the Shengmingsu product since launch, it is not logical that 


Yongye did not have access to its branded store customer list.  Absaroka is confident that the supposed 


provincial level distributor in the Hebei province acquisition is a hoax for the following reasons.  First, 


according to a 2009 interview with Yongye’s Chief of Marketing, Mr. Xu Nan, Hebei was the first province 


Shengmingsu was marketed in by the Company and it directly hired over 70 retailers in Leting county for the 


product launch in September 2008; after this initial success, Yongye utilized the same sales/marketing 


structure in other parts of Hebei province.
7
  As part of this provincial product launch, a sales center was 


established in Hebei on September 2008 by Yongye.  Next, on 03/13/10, three months before the supposed 


acquisition, the Hebei province sales center hosted over 500 distributors for the Yongye 1H10 Strategic Plan 


Summit.
8
  This meeting is a clear indication Yongye had direct access to its distributors prior to the customer 


list acquisition and thus there is no industrial logic to spend $32.3mm for a phantom customer list. 


According to Yongyi filings, the Hebei Customer List intangible asset acquisition cost is being is amortized 


over a period of nine years on a straight-line basis.
 9


  This extremely long amortization duration is difficult to 


understand for this “asset” as most of Yongye’s distributors have signed three-year agreements with the 


Company.  If the intangible asset acquisition cost amortization period was shortened to match the three-year 


duration of the distribution agreements, Yongye’s net income would decrease by $5.5mm on an annual basis 


because of the increased amortization expense. 


Finally, the Hebei Customer List acquisition is suspicious because Yongye supposedly issued 3.6 new shares 


(8.1% of total shares outstanding at 06/30/10) in consideration to the distributor, yet no 13-D was ever filed 


by the distributor after the close of the transaction.
10


  Under Section 13(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act 


of 1934, any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than five percent of a registered class of 


shares must disclose the position within 10 calendar days, even if the person is not a “related party.”
11





Yongye has attempted to obscure this issue by blaming the filing delay on the distributor, but it does not 


make sense for the Company to refuse to provide the identity of the distributor in the face of growing 


investor concerns.

4:  Yongye Falsely Claims Shengmingsu was Developed at Stanford – 


Indicative of Yongye’s use of deception and dishonesty to further objectives 
In a television promotional campaign run on CCTV-7, the national agriculture channel in China, Yongye 


claimed Shengmingsu was developed in the United States by 38 scientists from Stanford University.
 12


  This 


claim is patently false and indicative of Yongye’s use of deception and dishonesty to achieve its objectives.

12


 Please note Absaroka was able to verify Mr. Sam (Yue) Yu, Yongye’s CFO, obtained a Master’s in Business Administration on 06/16/02 from Stanford University, 
but this fact does not explain the fraudulent claim that 38 scientists from Stanford developed Shengmingsu.

5:  Yongye’s Main Product, Shengmingsu, is Not Effective – Yongye’s 


product claims do not correspond with reality 
Yongye’s main product, Shengmingsu, which means “Life Element,” is a liquid plant product consisting of a 


fulvic acid compound base (a derivative of humic acid) and other nutrients.  Shengmingsu’s compound base is 


a complex, acidic, biochemical polymer which is either created naturally through the decomposition of plant 


material, or can be produced by extracting it from humic acid.  Yongye instructs farmers to spray 


Shengmingsu directly on plants, typically in conjunction with other fertilizers and pesticides applications. 


Farmers usually purchase Shengmingsu in 100 milliliter bottles from distributors and distributors purchase 


Shengmingsu in cases of 100 from Yongye.  


In a recent interview, Mr. Wu Zishen, Yongye’s Chairman and CEO, claimed Shengmingsu provides farmers 


with a 10.0x cash-on-cash return due to increased crop yields.
13


  In addition, according to Yongye, 


Shengmingsu can help farmers more efficiently use other fertilizers and pesticides, reducing the farmers’ 


overall input costs and environmental damage to the farmers’ land. Yongye’s purported internal studies claim 


farmers will experience the following yield increases with the use of Shengmingsu: 


Crop   Yongye’s Claimed Yield Increase with Shengmingsu 


Green pepper   22.7% 


Potatoes   17.3% 


Wheat   10.7% 





However, these claims simply do not correspond with credible, peer-reviewed research on the topic.  For 


example, the American Society of Horticultural Science recently published an article by Professor Timothy 


Hartz of the University of California with the following conclusions (fulvic acid is the water-soluble portion of 


humic acid):  


“Five commercial humic acid (HA) formulations were evaluated for their effects on soil microbial 


activity, seedling emergence, crop productivity, and nutrient uptake when applied to representative 


agricultural soils.  Field trials were conducted in 2008 and 2009 evaluating the effects of pre-


transplant soil application of HA at 1.1 or 3.4 kgha–1 a.i. on growth, nutrient uptake, and fruit yield 


of processing tomato. In neither year was macro- or micronutrient uptake increased with HA. 


Similarly, there was no significant HA effect on plant dry mass accumulation or fruit yield. We 


conclude that, at typical commercial application rates in representative field soils, commercial humic 


acid formulations are unlikely to significantly improve vegetable crop nutrient uptake or 


productivity.”

Thus, Shengmingsu appears to be a quack remedy perpetuated on poorly-educated farmers via an over-


hyped marketing machine.  Yongye Chairman and CEO Mr. Wu Zishen’s claims of a 10.0x cash-on-cash return 


for farmers utilizing Shengmingsu is clearly bogus and indicative of the false promises perpetuated by Yongye 


Management.

6:  Yongye Cash Balance and New Bank Loans are Illogical – Raises doubt 


about reality of supposed cash balance 
As per the 03/31/11 10-Q unaudited financial statements, Yongye reported $44.6mm cash on its balance sheet and 


an insignificant amount of debt ($0.9mm of total debt).  Yongye generated $22.0mm in net cash from operating 


activities on an LTM basis as of 1Q11 and Management guidance as of March indicated the positive operating cash 


flow will continue in FY11.  Thus, it is difficult to understand why Yongye was forced to pursue $15.2mm in one-


year bank loans at a weighted average interest rate of 8.0%, which implies $1.2mm in annual cash interest 


expense, from China Everbright Bank, a relatively small regional bank in Inner Mongolia, China.
15


  In addition, Mr. 


Zishen Wu, Yongye’s Chairman, was forced to personally guarantee the loans, despite Management’s rosy financial 


outlook and supposedly available cash balance.  This fact-pattern indicates Everbright Bank may have significant 


concerns about the Yongye business, based on information that may not be readily available to U.S. equity 


investors. 


According to the 05/10/11 earnings call, Yongye obtained the loans to provide working capital for the summer 


season.  However, this explanation is completely illogical.  Even by excluding the $12.5mm in existing cash deposits 


to suppliers, Yongye’s current cash position is approximately two quarters worth of COGS, so from a working 


capital perspective, there should be no need for additional debt capacity if the cash on the balance sheet is real.   


7:  Excessive Management Compensation Relative to Peers – 


Shareholders are being diluted by continued share-based compensation 
Relative to its peers, Yongye’s management compensation is egregiously outsized and continues to dilute public 


shareholders.  Absaroka believes Yongye may have shifted its compensation scheme to an equity-focused structure 


to minimize its actual cash flow (especially if the reported cash balances are fraudulent) and incentivize employees 


to continue perpetuating the supposed business results.

8:  Unsatisfactory Auditor History – Raises grave concern about the 


validity of historical financials and forward-looking guidance 
Yongye utilized two small, no-name auditors as part of its reverse-merger transaction.  Absaroka vigorously 


disagrees with some U.S. investors’ perspective that an audit opinion from a “big four” firm eliminates the 


possibility of accounting fraud.  Based on the Yongye business issues discussed earlier in this report and the 


abysmal track record of “big four” auditors in China, the probability of KPMG resigning its engagement with 


Yongye and/or its audit opinion being withdrawn appears significant.  As a reminder, a timely and valid audit 


opinion from a PCAOB certified auditor is a prerequisite for continued listing on the major U.S. equity 


exchanges.

All of the “big four” auditors have been party to recent and significant frauds in China.  Also, because equity 


investors may perform less detailed due diligence when a larger audit firm is providing an audit opinion on a 


company’s financials, the scope of a fraud can potentially expand to a greater size.

Yongye Estimated Fundamental Value 


$/Share Equity Valuation Metrics29 


Absaroka’s valuation calculations assume 49.5mm diluted shares outstanding and a current net cash 


position of $43.7mm as per Yongye’s 03/31/11 10-Q SEC filing.  Because of the numerous concerns 


discussed earlier in this document, Absaroka has zero confidence in Yongye’s reported financials.  Thus, 


Absaroka feels the best valuation metrics for YONG are based on public investors’ potential recovery in a 


liquidation scenario as the over-hyped Shengmingsu business has limited operating value on a go-


forward basis.  Yongye’s Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Agreement restricts public investors’ 


recourse with Yongye’s Management to pursue legal damages, so the best hope of recovery lies in the 


liquidation of the net property, plant, and equipment and the distribution of cash purported on the 


balance sheet.  As Yongye Management has recklessly disregarded the interests of public investors in 


the acquisitions of the Wuchuan Shuntong coal project and the Hebei customer list, Absaroka is 


concerned similar malfeasance has occurred in the acquisition of other property, plant, and equipment, 


and thus has valued the net PP&E at 0.75x-1.00x the reported figure as of the 03/31/11 10-Q.  Finally, 


this valuation is predicated on the assumption that the $43.7mm cash figure is accurate; any reduction 


in actual cash balance would cause Absaroka to materially reassess this Estimated Fundamental Value 


calculation. 


Also, because of Yongye’s significant business and accounting issues, Absaroka believes there is a 


material risk of NASDAQ enacting a trading halt while these issues are resolved and more information is 


provided.  As the recent CAGC/CCME/DGW/PUDA/UTA/WATG situations have shown, a trading halt can 


have a significant duration while these critical issues are resolved. 


Triangulating all the information discussed earlier in the report, the recent trading history, and 


reasonable valuation metrics, Absaroka is initiating coverage of Yongye International, Inc. with a $1.00 


Estimated Fundamental Value and a CONVICTION SELL Recommendation.

Conclusion – Yongye International, Inc.  
(NASDAQ: YONG) 


In this Initiating Coverage Report, Absaroka presented irrefutable evidence that Yongye International, 


Inc. has fraudulently misrepresented its business and thus Yongye is massively over-valued by the 


market at this time.  Absaroka’s significant concerns about Yongye include the following material issues: 


1. The $35.0mm cash acquisition of the Wuchuan Lignite Coal Project is not a legitimate 


transaction and appears to be a scheme to transfer funds out of the Company at the expense of 


public shareholders 


2. Intertwined relationships with its two largest suppliers appear to allow the Company to 


fraudulently manipulate earnings:  Wuchuan Sanda was ordered to cease production by the 


government and Wuchuan Shuntong does not produce nearly the amount of humic acid claimed 


by Yongye 


3. The $32.3mm Hebei Customer List acquisition has limited industrial logic and appears to be 


another scheme by Yongye Management to falsely manipulate earnings 


4. Yongye falsely claims Shengmingsu, its main product, was developed by 38 scientists at Stanford 


University:  Absaroka provides a letter from Stanford University certifying it has no connection 


to Yongye’s Shengmingsu fertilizer and Yongye does not have permission to utilize Stanford’s 


name, trademark, or images in its advertising and marketing efforts. 


5. Yongye’s Shengmingsu is minimally effective for farmers and Yongye’s product claims do not 


correspond with reality 


6. The new bank loans are illogical relative to the supposed cash balance, which raises doubt about 


the reality of the cash balance on the unaudited 03/31/11 10-Q balance sheet 


7. Excessive management compensation relative to peers is diluting shareholder interests because 


of continued large share-based compensation grants 


8. The unsatisfactory auditor history raises grave concern about the validity of historical financials 


and forward-looking guidance 


Any of these issues on a stand-alone basis should be enough to convince public shareholders to question 
the current $4.58/share valuation and pursue the “Wall Street Walk” form of shareholder activism 


Recommendation:  CONVICTION SELL 
Estimated Fundamental Value: $1.00

Appendix 1:  Corporate Overview – Sub-optimal reverse-merger listing history  


Yongye Abbreviated Corporate History 
 Incorporated in Nevada on 12/12/06 under the corporate name “Golden Tan, Inc.,” the 


Company originally offered sunless tanning services prior to entering into the reverse-merger 


transaction with Fullmax Pacific Limited on 04/17/08
30





 In connection with the 09/11/08 private placement of 19.0mm common shares, the Company 


began to trade freely on the OTC-BB exchange under the symbol “YGYB”
31





 On 09/03/09, Yongye was listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “YONG” 


 On 12/17/09, the Company raised $60mm in new equity at $7.50/share and the use of proceeds 


was purportedly to expand production capacity and acquire lignite coal resources
32





 On 03/01/10, Yongye entered into an asset purchase agreement with Wuchuan Shuntong to 


acquire lignite coal project for cash consideration of $35.0mm
33





 On 06/21/10, the Company announced the acquisition of a “regional distributor” of 


Shengmingsu for $32.3mm in total consideration ($3.0mm in cash and 3.6mm shares of 


common stock) 


Yongye Simplified Corporate Structure34 
While this onshore/offshore corporate structure is 


relatively standard in the Chinese reverse-merger 


space, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture 


Agreement (the “CJV Agreement”) between Asia 


Standard Oil Limited and Inner Mongolia Yongye 


Biotechnology Co., Ltd. exposes United States investors 


to significant legal risk regarding custody of the actual 


operating business and assets.  For reference, the CJV 


Agreement is similar to the variable interest entities 


(VIEs) utilized by some other Chinese reverse-mergers 


for an offshore/onshore structure.  As recent 


accusations involving a similar Chinese coal company 


have proven, U.S. domiciled investors have limited 


recourse if management takes custody of an operating business entity and pledges it as collateral for 


other personal business interests.  Moreover, Yonye’s CEO/Chairman, Mr. Wu Zishan’s, direct ownership 


stake in Yongye Biotechnology exposes investors to the risk that the Company will not be managed in 


the best interests of public investors.  YONG’s recent acquisitions provide clear examples of the danger 


of this type of CJV Agreement entity structure to public investors.

Wuchuan County People's Government Notice Regarding Closing Illegally-Operated Small Manufacture Enterprises 


To Township People’s Governments, Departments of Wuchuan County: 


In the recent years, with further exploitation of mineral resources and great promotion of mining economy in our county, many successful enterprises with large 


scale, high resource efficiency and tremendous economic benefit have set up plants in our county. However, despite repeated orders of banning, there still exists 


many small enterprises illegally operated featuring lack of business license, high consumption of energy and resources and heavy pollution of environment. They 


have seriously hindered the adjustment of industrial economic structure in our county and led to unauthorized and wasteful mining which caused a lot of 


complaints from the residents. Moreover, these illegal enterprises may also have bad impact on the upcoming conference on promoting the material and ethical 


progress in the city of Hohhot and a series of stringent measures making Hohhot as the model city for environment protection. 


To better optimize industrial structure, standardize business management, strike illegal operation and maintain a healthy market, it is decided that all the illegal 


enterprises in Wuchuan County should be shut down after this date. 


1. Banned and closed range: 


Enterprises that haven’t got the legal project license, land use approval, business license and environment impact evaluation record or those which did poor in 


safety production and environment protection or those small iron plants which haven’t one fixed mineral source and those manufacture enterprise producing 


electric mangle, weathered coal(humid acid), facing decorative stone must be closed. 


Enterprises that separate gold through old ways like small cyanided tank, small amalgamate mercury or down spouting which are prohibited by the government 


must be closed. 


Unauthorized and wasteful mining, gold mining and iron concentration in river course must be prohibited.  


Liquor processing enterprises that pose threat to people’s health and disrupt the market must be closed.  


2. Time Limits: 


All the illegal enterprises must stop their production before April 25, 2010 by themselves and deal with any problems arising from the shutdown in a timely 


manner, or they will be forced to do so by local authorities.  The electric utility section of the government will cut off electricity for these illegal enterprises after 


April 25, 2010. 


3. Measures:  


Each township’s government and department should establish the communication and coordination mechanism and enhance law enforcement to fulfill their duty in 


banning and closing illegal enterprises according to the relevant regulations. 


The Administration for Industry and Commerce should ban the enterprises without business license and revoke the license of illegal enterprises. Department of 


Land and Resources should investigate the problem of illegal land use and punish those responsible. Electricity supplying department should cut off production 


electricity and remove electric supply equipment for those illegal enterprises immediately. Economic and trade department and environment protection 


department should coordinate the work and urge the illegal enterprises to dismantle their production equipment.  


The manufacturing enterprises producing humic acid (weathered coal) and face decorative stone should set up their plants in the production park and the county 


government will grant preferential policies in land and taxation. In principle, enterprises producing humic acid ought to be moved into economic development zone 


and enterprises doing stone machining ought to be moved to Stone Industrial Park in Xiwulanbulang Town in the west of Wuchuan County.  


In mining, the unified law enforcement mechanism should be established to fight against unauthorized and wasteful mining, mining beyond the limited area, and 


the substitution of mining for exploitation. The cases like unscrupulous plundering of mineral resources and the deforestation which are heavily destructive and 


constitute crime will be handed over to judiciary department. 


Relevant departments should work together to assume their respective responsibility. Any individual or department responsible for the dereliction of duty or 


malfeasance that give rise to major accidents or heavy environment pollution will be investigated for administrative responsibility. Any law enforcement officials or 


civil servants violating law by buying shares of illegal enterprises or setting up illegal enterprises with others will be investigated and punished by the administration 


for supervision and anti- malfeasance. Those closed enterprises that restarted must be punished heavily to ensure the implementation of the measures.  


Relevant departments should establish long-term supervision mechanism to prevent the illegal behaviors of enterprises. They should set a higher standard of 


market access for manufacture enterprises and eliminate those which cannot meet the technical standards or the requirement of the company.
