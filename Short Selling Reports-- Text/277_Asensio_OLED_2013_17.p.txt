A deal with LG – UDC’s elusive Holy Grail.


Posted on October 17, 2013 by asensio.com


Fed by statements from Universal Display Corp. (“UDC”; NASDAQ:


OLED) management, speculation has mounted for years that UDC


will eventually be able to sign a “blockbuster” deal with LG,


presumably on terms superior to the Samsung deal that already has


allowed cuts in UDC’s red emitter sales of over 60%. Absurdly, UDC


has been able to survive in investors’ minds as having a greater


value in the distant future.


UDC’s redacted version of the Samsung agreement filed with the


SEC does not give investors an understanding of the events that


trigger protection clauses in Samsung’s favor including a “most


favored nation” clause.


We believe that Samsung only entered into a long-term agreement


to avoid further involvement with UDC and in anticipation of


revocations before the 2017 patent expiration. Samsung’s early


involvement with UDC, actually at the time of the DARPA


experiments before UDC entered the picture, allows for the creation


of complicated factual allegations. These would be considered in


any Samsung “freedom to operate” legal opinion. LG is not in the


same situation. LG has no such burden and has the benefit of new


adverse rulings and pending full revocation of UDC’s cornerstone


patent for the entire European market.


LG can easily avoid having to enter into any new deal with UDC and


simply wait for UDC’s key patent claims to be challenged or


invalidated in major jurisdictions, even before UDC’s key patents


begin to expire in 2017.
