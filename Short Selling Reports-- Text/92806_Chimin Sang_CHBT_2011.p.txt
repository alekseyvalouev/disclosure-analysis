Reasons to Avoid China-Biotics

On Friday, China-Biotics' (OTC:CHBT) stock price took a dive on apparently no news. A
news search in the China media, however, yields a piece of news (original, and Google
translation) charging that the company may have fabricated its revenue numbers.
Coming from The First Financial Daily, an influential Chinese financial newspaper
owned by the second largest news group in China, SMG, the news did not evade the
shrewd eyes of some smart investors and made an impact on the capital market.


This investigation was sparked by some original financial analysis done recently
(original, and Google translation) by Xiacao, a.k.a. Summer Grass, a famous
independent Chinese financial analyst.


Xiacao, nicknamed “Fraud Killer,” is a former teacher in Shanghai's national accounting
college and a member of that institute's Fraud Research Center. Having exposed a
famous fraud case in 2001, and since then exposing hundreds of fraud cases in China,
he has published eight books covering his research results. By all means, he is an
expert in cracking hard-to-detect frauds in China.


The findings listed below are explosive for the fraud-plagued company, which struggled
in a recent scandal finding that it did not own hundreds of retail stores that it claimed to
have.


The company exaggerated its retail outlet number.

While the company's 2010 10-K (Its financial calendar ends in March 2010) claimed that
it had around 70 dedicated retail outlets in Shanghai, the First Financial Daily reporter
confirmed with the outlet staff that only six outlets exist in Shanghai: One in Pudong and
five in Puxi. One mid-level manager in its manufacturing department was surprised by
the quoted high outlet number when interviewed.


China-Biotics' executive VP, Eva Yan, informed the reporter that only 60% of the outlets
are true outlets, the rest being counters in supermarkets. Even with that shrunken
account, the outlet number, which comes up to 40, is still far above the six quoted by the
store staff and verifiable by external investigation.


Legou, a supermarket, informed the reporter that the sale of China-Biotics' pro-biotics
powder was so low that it suspended sales from July 2010 and only resumed them
recently. Some supermarkets confirmed that they have never carried Double Gold pro-
biotics, CHBT's main product.


The company's retail sales seem to be extremely weak.


The reporter stayed at the two flagship stores for half an hour each and did not see any
customers. The sales book the staff showed to the reporter contained sales as early as
2008. The reporter found some out-of-date products in a supermarket, where the staff
confirmed that there were rarely sales.


The company's bulk additive business seems grossly exaggerated.


China-Biotics made $81m in its 2010 fiscal year, but according to Dachao Zhang,
chairman of the Consulting Committee of China Healthcare Association, there are no
large-scale probiotics domestic manufacturers. The known market leaders are Danisco
(OTC:DNSOF), a Danish company that was recently acquired by DuPont (DD), and
Grape King, a Taiwanese company.


Danisco China headquarters' marketing department staff commented to the reporter that
the market share of China-Biotics is "ignorable" when compared to Danisco. The same
personnel were also puzzled by China-Biotics' claimed revenue of $81m.

China-Biotics also claimed that it provides bulk additives to large diary companies like
Yili, Mengniu and Bright. Yili denied that China-Biotics was its supplier and quoted
Danisco and Hansen, the largest two in the world, as the only pro-biotics suppliers.
Bright claimed that it used mostly its own pro-biotics. In responding to that, Eva Yan
claimed that China-Biotics has not signed with Yili and had a limited co-operation with
Bright in 2007.


China Biotics' FY2010 10-K shows 26.8% of its revenue came from bulk additives and
73.2% from retail. Eva Yan now believes 40% of the revenue comes from bulk additives
and 60% comes from retail.


China-Biotics' tax payable seems to indicate exaggerated revenue and profit.


Xiacao found that the company accumulated $31m in tax payable, nearly 60% of all its
tax to date (see table). He argued that it was unlikely for the tax authority to keep such a
high amount on the book. The company's claim of exemption of value-added tax also
was unheard of for health care product companies. The only logical explanation is that
the company was massively exaggerating its revenue and profit and did not pay tax
appropriate for the exaggerated number.

Eva Yan's explanation is that these are tax-accrued in case that the tax-exempt case for
the company five years ago is not approved. "These are not real tax liabilities," he
emphasized. But an employee of a Big Four accounting firm doubted such a claim:
"What is the basis for accrual? How did the company calculate it? Why did not increase
year over year?"


China-Biotics has an abnormally low inventory.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
Join the next boom » 


The following table shows that China-Biotics had inventory at merely 12 days in the
most recent quarter and only nine days for 2008, which does not fit its manufacturing
business model. Xiacao argued that this was also a primitive error left by revenue
exaggeration.  


Conclusion: Local sources in China helped raise more red flags on China-Biotics.


The local financial analyst was convinced that the company exaggerated its revenue
numbers, as otherwise he could not explain the high tax payable and fast inventory
turnover. The local reporter was able to talk to its customers and its employees, and
found that the annual revenue numbers of $81m was unlikely, given the few retail stores
and no visible business, both in retail and bulk additives.


Thus I suggest that readers avoid investing in this phantom company.

Disclosure: I am short CHBT.


I don't typically talk about my long positions but I do talk about the stocks that I either don't like or do not like
enough.
