TODAY REINFORCES WHY
$W WAYFAIR
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD
BE CONCERNED. MULTI-
CHANNEL – VALUATION –
SUPPLY CHAIN


Citron Reiterates Wayfair
Short Term $50 Target


Grocery stocks are getting hit hard today on the fear
of Amazon disrupting their supply chains.  Similarly,
as Amazon enters furniture, it breaks Wayfair’s
strategic hold on it supply chain.  (MAJOR STATED
RISK FACTOR IN WAYFAIR FILINGS)





1. The Gorilla Enters the Room. The
market reactions we see today in
Kroger, Target, and WalMart (all
profitable) show the fear in the
market for businesses vulnerable
to competition from Amazon.

2. The importance of multi-channel
retailing. $AMZN proves that some
e-commerce solutions absolutely
require local physical presence:
Groceries are one, and furniture is
the other.  Case-in-point: Amazon’s
new “Unified Delivery with Services”
program for furniture.





3. Real companies get real
valuations: $WFM got bought for
10.7 times next 12 months EBIDTA. 
$W is a throwback to 1999, a
business where there’s never
EBIDTA, just cumulative losses.


4. Profits? Never ever.  If Wayfair
couldn’t make money before
Amazon was a competitor, how can
they possibly ever become
profitable with Amazon pushing
hard into their only marketplace?





5. Forget Bailout by Walmart. Do not
forget WalMart’s new national ad
campaign rollout for Hayneedle –
don’t expect any bailout for Wayfair
from Bentonville.





6. “Amazon Who?” Whenever an
online retailer’s CEO says on a
conference call he is “not
concerned about Amazon” — and
dismisses them saying they sell
“batteries and books” … it is time to
Share this entry


! " # $


be concerned about your CEO.





7. Follow the Money: Insider selling
last 6 months for Whole Foods = $2
million, for Wayfair last 6 weeks
$220 million.





8. Analyst Shmanalyst. The analysts
are so lost that the last upgrade on
Wayfair (Piper) did not even have
the word “Amazon” in the report. 
Analyzing an e-commerce company
without acknowledging Amazon is
like writing about the 2017 NBA
season and refusing to mention the
 G.S. Warriors.
