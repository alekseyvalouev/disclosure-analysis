Solazyme: It Isn't Easy (Or Profitable) Being Green

by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Historic drought and fires affect sugar cane heartland, multiplying production
problems for SZYM’s Brazil plant. Slashed prospects expected to extend into next
year.


Biofuels business performs spectacularly poorly, driving stock prices from roughly
$25 down to 25 cents in three years for three other companies. Niche presents
similar risks for SZYM.


Sudden, quiet departure of president, engineering vice president and director/audit
committee chairman in recent weeks foretells significant troubles for SZYM.


Fund whittles ownership, while company insiders sell more than half-a-million shares
in just the last two months, indicating a lack of faith in the company.


SZYM accumulates $384 million in losses, yet five executives and directors last year
received princely sum of $10.5 million in stock and other compensation. CEO alone
got almost $3.5 million.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Trouble is blowing the lids off the petri dishes at Solazyme (SZYM), where the company
has fruitlessly toiled for 11 years at turning sugar and algae into profit.


The San Francisco, Calif. oil-maker's income statement and analyst estimates are already
steeped in red.


It battles increasing net losses (note that besides Sephora and other stores, SZYM also
unfortunately hitched its wagon to badly aging J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) which traded
~$30 then, ~$7 now) as SZYM produces "green" wrinkle cream from algae.


SZYM also faces a massive string of red flags poised to smother its effort to create
renewable oils and chemicals for various markets from its sugar-fed algae.


Plant shutdown likely dings oil production effort

SZYM first pushed out some commercial oil and drilling lubricant in May from a small area
at Brazil's Moema Plant that the townspeople call "the annex." CEO Jonathan Wolfson
understandably trumpeted the event resulting from a joint venture with Bunge, yet warned,
"We have work ahead … establishing consistent production and reliable supply and from
there we'll turn to the ramp up process."


But production and supply problems already appear to be damaging that ramp-up. Layoffs
occurred when the annex lurched to a temporary standstill while a cranky boiler was
repaired, according to our source located near the plant in the sugar cane heartland in
Sao Paulo, Brazil.


SZYM on Oct. 9 offered the sketchiest plant update, describing production of only "modest
quantities" of commercial oils, warning:


… downstream processes at Moema require further optimization and are not yet
operating on a fully integrated basis. This is an area of significant focus and ongoing
improvement."


So this suggests the plant is not scaling up according to expectations.


Indeed, some analysts remain nervous about SZYM's future, with Piper Jaffray leading the
pack with its issued "Underweight" rating, writing:


… a lack of visibility into the scale-up at Moema in terms of committed contracts,
timelines, and general plant operations underscore our Underweight thesis."


The analyst also complained about "very limited visibility/obfuscation into tangible
productions metrics" and added:


High variable costs and fixed cost absorption should start to ramp quickly at Moema,
against limited volumes during the plant start-up. We believe that, ultimately, low
sales volumes and high fixed costs will beget poorer than expected economics in an
effort to secure volumes."


Credit Suisse wrote more gently last week about giving SZYM a "neutral" rating and
estimating a $1.66 loss per share this year, while Piper Jaffray raised the expected net
loss to $1.93.

Historic drought, fires build more uncertainty


The sugar cane crop that serves as SZYM's feedstock has been hit by massive fires and
the worst drought in 100 years.


Sugar industry group Unica reports the two factors have already substantially cut the cane
plantings and harvest for the 2014-2015 season.


With Bunge and other sugar and ethanol companies already cutting costs against losses,
an industry spokesman said next season's crop will suffer significantly. Sugar production is
expected to be slashed by about 3 million metric tons.


Those hits can only be expected to hold SZYM's foot off the accelerator at the plant at
least until sometime after the sugar cane harvest next year.


Advanced biofuels business performs poorly


SZYM's biofuels effort also stands ready to disappoint investors, judging by three
companies that have turned and run away from this business. They are Kior ($20 in 2011,
now ~7 cents, unable to commercialize biofuel, delisted), Gevo ($25 in 2011, now ~29
cents, tried biofuels but returned to ethanol) and a company TheStreetSweeper warned
about, Amyris ($32 in 2011, now ~$3, now focused on perfume oils).


The stock chart tells the story:


SZYM has managed investor sentiment so the stock hasn't yet been smashed. But we
expect the screws will be tightened now that the company is expected to produce.


Goodbye president, hello trouble


These three sudden, quiet departures throw more red flags at SZYM's future:

1. SZYM president and director, David Cole, jumps out with a golden parachute worth
$844,000 to consult for SZYM for $20,000 per month.


2. Engineering vice president, Mark Warner, hired to design SZYM plants worldwide and
build out commercial scale success, left in September to join another company called
Impossible Foods, according to LinkedIn. But SZYM didn't bother to tell investors.


3. Long-time director/audit chairman Ann Mather resigns, effective "prior to the end of
2014." She is a board member of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and a
company TheStreetSweeper recently warned investors about, Glu Mobile
(NASDAQ:GLUU).


Whether these execs and directors were shown the door or found it themselves because
of Brazil plant problems or something more or less ominous, we are unsure.


But we are sure it amounts to bad news.


Fund, insiders selling like crazy


Braemar Energy Ventures was a big holder of SZYM in 2013, with an ownership of about
8.2 percent of the shares.


But now Braemar has apparently lost faith in the stock and has recently sold more than 2
million shares, whittling down its ownership to just 4.99 percent of the company.


That seems to be the unfortunate trend with insiders because they have done nothing for
a long time but sell, sell, sell SZYM.


In the last two months alone, officers and directors have sold a jaw-dropping 500,000-plus
shares. The chief executive Mr. Wolfson led the charge by selling almost 275,000 shares.


SZYM loses multimillions, pays executives multimillions


Investors shouldn't make the mistake of taking a quick glimpse at SZYM's finances and
thinking, "Well, at least they've got some cash."


That $285 million in cash and short-term investments is mostly due to a massive debt
load, including recent additions from private and public offerings. Besides, the company is
burning that up in about $20 million chunks each month.


The company has accumulated $384 million in losses.

Comments (80)


Despite that, SZYM last year handed five top executives compensation packages,
including stock, totaling $10.5 million.


That's right. It apparently pays in spades to run a money-losing company facing
spectacular odds.


The chief executive Mr. Wolfson received almost $3.5 million. CFO Tyler Painter, COO
Jean-Marc Rotsaert and technology officer Peter Licari got about $2 million, while general
counsel Paul Quinlan received $1.2 million.


Conclusion


It all looks bad: the massive fires and drought adding to oil production problems at the
Brazil plant into next year, other companies failing to profit in the biofuels niche, sudden
departures of key insiders, massive insider selling, executives with absurdly cushy
compensations, plus the company's 10 out of 13 sales misses since the 2011 initial public
offering, and the current lower petroleum prices slowing acceptance of alternative oils or
fuels.


Now we expect analyst downgrades and declining estimates for the rest of the year and
2015.


In our opinion, the enterprise value of SZYM is close to zero.


All considered, the only green left in this company will have to be scraped from the bottom
of a petri dish.

of their short position. I hope so, at any rate.

Well, that and they just lost 22% on their investment yesterday before issuing this article today. Sounds more
to me like someone who just lost control of their investment and is in damage control mode.


This is an attempt to nitpick the company to death with unsubstantiated claims. They keep insisting on
uncertainty. Since when has uncertainty led to such a conclusion as this:


"In our opinion, the enterprise value of SZYM is close to zero."


First of all, she states "our opinion". This isn't just one analyst's feeling based on the data. It's
TheStreetSweeper's conclusion, which is heavily biased based on its short interest in the company.

It's pretty clear that StreetSweeper was short before yesterday's 27% jump in SZYM. This article is simply damage

I don't own SZYM. Waiting for it to ramp up. But you literally have to be a half wit if you buy into such a biased
viewpoint. Simply read any of Kevin Quon's papers and you will realize the long term value SZYM holds. This piece is
worse than a desperate city councilman's TV ad on public television. Why was this piece written? Bc some hack @
investing saw their position go down 20% the other day on their short position. But if you wish to buy into this piece,
good luck. You are the most gullible investor ever. Long term, SZYM wins.

Whenever I see this type of statement made for any company besides a pump and dump penny stock I know that the
author has a hidden agenda. Amazing coincidence--such statements are always written by someone who is short the
stock. 
I appreciate that SA allows varying viewpoints, but often wish that they would have higher standards when it comes to

I am long the stock and I like to read such articles and the comments below it. I never want to fall in love with
a stock. This article forces me to challenge my assumptions. So lets challenge them: 
1. Sugar is available in Brazil. Check 
2. Technology is working. verdict still out but the article doesn'tbring new information 
3. Prioduct prices will hold strong. Check. Petroleum Prices will have little affect on company revenue. 
4. Management competent and motivate Article does ask some good questions and management does worry
me. They need to communicate better.


I will remain long for now but we need to see some good revenue numbers and soon.

It's always useful to have some negative comments on companies whose technology places them in the forefront of
innovation. However, there are a few arguments here that I would challenge. First, comparing SZYM with other biofuel

firms is ludicrous because SZYM uses a completely different technology – closed systems, where control of output is
much greater. Second, although SZYM has a process for producing diesel/aviation fuels profitably, the profit margins
on oils for cosmetics and foods are substantially higher. So it is not useful to compare SZYM with other biofuel firms
producing fuel.


Finally, the compensation of executives, done partly through the grant of options and planned selling of those options,
is in line with practices at other small startup companies and has virtually nothing to do with insider selling or insider
knowledge of company prospects. I agree that excessive payments of this sort, when there's little or nothing in the
way of profits to justify the compensation, are at best a questionable practice. But so is the fact that executive
compensation at corporations big and small is running between 100 and 500 times the median for hourly wage
employees.


What Solazyme has shown its shareholders and the public so far is that its processes for manufacturing oils and
related products from sugar and corn are scalable and capable of generating exceptionally high gross margins. What
they haven't yet shown is a management with sufficient skills to run the company profitably. Lack of seasoned
management is common among startups. Lack of transparency in explaining all the difficulties of ramping up
production is also a symptom of inexperience, but not necessarily of dishonesty as the author implies.


Solazyme, because of its technology and continuing losses, still can only be seen as a "story stock" that has promise
but so far no benefits to shareholders. In this respect it resembles hundreds of other companies whose shares are
available to the public. Because of the essentially higher risks of story stocks, investors simply cannot afford to put all
their eggs in this one basket. Depending on the ability of individual investors to cushion potential losses against profits
elsewhere, the shares in my view are still worth considering.

Thanks experienced I really appreciate your balanced posts. As one who is considering taking a position in
SZYM after it's recent plunges, I want to see the various sides of the argument pro and con for buying shares
right now. It's been brutal for the "story stocks" in 2014 and if the broader market continues to struggle, the
small non-profitable companies will continue to be punished more than others as investors flee to safety in
companies like JNJ, GE, MO and DIS. I see that as the biggest short term risk for SZYM right now and the
reason I am still on the sidelines. Long term, I think that this is an extremely promising company that will
begin significantly outperforming the market in coming years.

This is pure spin from a company that needs to unwind its positions plain and simple. Not to say that I don't share

Actually I like and appreciate this article and I'm long SZYM. These people not only put down their perceived
negatives of SZYM on paper they back up their talk with their money--short positions. And you people criticize them
for putting their money where their mouths are.


And guess what? They've been right so far! SZYM just took a dump and got cut in half in the last 2 months. That's
pretty good predicting power in my book.


Longs here act like SZYM has turned the corner and any day now news will be out that they are taking over the world.
Well, not so fast. This is a never done before technology---never---b... accomplished--before---in the history of the
world. But that's not supposed to be risky? How's that? What did SZYM do last quarter, 18m in gross revenue? With 2
up and running production plants and one that was supposed to be up and running? That's a red flag people.


And the conspicuous no news ever coming out of SZYM? How is that good? When there is no news that usually
means--er, ah duh, there is no news. And no news for a company in this stage is bad news. Moema should be up and
running and ramping now and putting out press release after press release--this downstream problem stuff being the
first and only news in 3 months is bizarre. It's so vague and fuzzy but bottom line Moema is not producing. And
management's pay and selling of shares? Come on--that is scary and sends a really bad message. Management lives
like kings while shareholders get cut in half. Not good!

Unfortunately "be objective" is good advice and the smear piece (yes, that's what it was) was anything BUT
objective. All the terminology about red flags, golden parachutes, analysts "in the know".... all of it is nothing
but a bash piece:


 
Biofuels performs spectacularly poorly- seriously? She knows so little about this company that she lists THIS
as a flag?


 
Operations in an "annex" and layoffs due to boiler issues- This one is worthy of the Yahoo boards in terms of
its utter lack of factual basis. Someone obviously took her for a ride in convincing her of an "annex" to the
factory. No such thing. Period. Perhaps the layoffs she references from another anonymous "source" were
those who failed to bring the boiler online for Bunge in a timely manner?


 
Sugar production may drop by as much as 3m mt for 2015. Oh my, the sky falls around us. Unica has already
adjusted its numbers; the 2015 harvest is still expected to amount to approx. 580 million tons. Even translated
to sugar output that figure still makes miniscule the quantities required by Moema were it at full cap currently.


 
The expectation of press release after press release isn't realistic. Moema isn't even halfway into its expected
ramp calendar. "Modest quantities" needs to be taken in relation to the vessels in use; a single column should
yield 60-80t of product after separation. Large, but relative to the planned full output of the plant it is modest
indeed.


 
With regard to defections, too many assume they know the circumstances of these and earlier departures, in
particular if they were voluntary or otherwise.

Solazyme reminds me of 3-D printer companies about 25 years ago. Solazyme should ultimately be
successful but it may be way ahead of its time, and it may need crude oil prices over $100 per barrel to be
competitive and gain market share. Because of the boom in North American oil production and steady
improvement in drilling and production methods throughout the entire world, we may not see oil consistently
over $100 until 2024 or even later. But I haven't looked at the valuation and I have no opinion on whether
Solazyme is a good short or long trade at the current stock price.


16 Oct 2014, 09:13 PM


pwd9398
Good points but keep in mind that with Encapso drilling additive as a primary product, Solazyme could be
well-positioned to benefit from short/medium term prosperity of traditional geologic oil producers.

The main thesis of the article appears to hinge upon SZYM being lumped in with other biofuel companies. This
viewpoint shows a complete lack of understanding by the author since biofuels are probably the lowest priority for
SZYM. Their other markets (which were barely mentioned- food was omitted entirely) are much higher margin than
fuels and will lead to huge profits once volumes are ramped up sufficiently. Insider selling is normal for any company
since executives often receive shares as a significant part of their total compensation package. People change jobs
for all sorts of reasons. The author is obviously trying desperately to put a negative spin on the facts. Long SZYM and
willing to be patient.

Let's address your summary one by one:


1) Historic drought and fires affect sugar cane heartland, multiplying production problems for SZYM’s Brazil plant.
Slashed prospects expected to extend into next year.


- Solazymes feedstock prices are locked in through contracts with Bunge, so short-term volatility on the price of sugar
will not have any effect on Solazyme's bottom line.


2) Biofuels business performs spectacularly poorly, driving stock prices from roughly $25 down to 25 cents in three
years for three other companies. Niche presents similar risks for SZYM.


- Kior, Gevo and Amyris are all VERY different companies compared to Solazyme. Solazyme is not a 'biofuel'
company and is better viewed as a specialty chemical, nutrition and personal care products company.


You neglected to mention PEIX (up over 200% in the past year despite a more than 50% pullback from 52-week
highs) and other successful ethanol producers which are up considerably over the past year.


3) Sudden, quiet departure of president, engineering vice president and director/audit committee chairman in recent
weeks foretells significant troubles for SZYM.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2566655-solazyme-it-isnt-easy-or-profitable-being-green 12/23


David Cole is going back to the advisory role he had last year and this was announced in a PR. Hardly a "quiet
departure." Audit committee chairman was replaced with someone who in my opinion is a much stronger candidate
for the aforementioned position--former DuPont CFO Gary Pfeiffer (a $61 Billion market cap company).


4) Fund whittles ownership, while company insiders sell more than half-a-million shares in just the last two months,
indicating a lack of faith in the company.


- Braemar is a VC firm and was an early investor in Solazyme. They've sold very small amount of stock relative to
their total position over the past year. Not really much you can conclude from this.


5) SZYM accumulates $384 million in losses, yet five executives and directors last year received princely sum of
$10.5 million in stock and other compensation. CEO alone got almost $3.5 million.


- Accumulated losses lead to tax-free profits in the future, I fail to see how this is a negative. $10.5 million in
compensation for five executives and directors in a company that has a market capitalization fluctuating between
$500 million and over $1 billion hardly seems excessive...

All the comments are right on.  
What I find is interesting is that no mention was made of the recent news that John Burbank of Passport Capital
added 1.65 million shares to his existing position to a total of 8.08 million shares. If I did not fully disclose all the facts
regarding a recommendation - both pro and con, well the regulators would have something to say about that. At least
we had the disclosure that they are a short sellers. Lastly, don't fully discount or dismiss the information the writer

Thanks, Sonya. While I disagree on your zero valuation on the equity and don't put much weight into this year's
Brazilian sugarcane forecast I am with you on current management. Weak at best. Great scientists but poor
managers as evidenced by high turnover, inflated severance packages, and no regard for equity holders. Investors on
this site repeatedly say that 10b5-1 automatic sale plans don't matter. Actually, they do. Management can cancel the
plan, they don't. If the people who know the company better than anyone are selling their equity, why should an
outsider buy? They shouldn't. The 5% convert notes trade at 70, not severely distressed but troubling. If the equity
were in danger of permanent impairment the converts would be trading south of 50 cents on the dollar. Good luck
covering your short position. Full disclosure: I am a long term equity holder

Not sure why everyone is bashing this piece when it raises valid points. If two of the top guys involved in
commercializing the technology leave, I think that is pretty telling. They know a lot more about the potential of the
technology (than everyone on this blog) and they have voted with their feet. If SZYM can fulfill any of their projected
total available markets, these guys would have stayed. Didn't SZYM management say their target markets are worth
billions of dollars?


The president and board member leaving to become an advisor is a major flag. For people that don't know much
about this maneuver, it is very common for board members to leave in order for them to limit their future liability and to
have full flexibility to liquidate their shares. If he was still a board member, in order to sell shares he would have to
participate in the 10b5-1 program. But since he is no longer a member, he can sell any time he wants. There have
been many instances when board members resign in order to sell shares. Even in SZYM case, a good example is
Braemar, who use to have a board seat at SZYM (William Lese Braemar was the representative). Lese steppted
down in Sept 2013... and guess what happenned since then, Braemar unload 50% of its holdings without many
people noticing. 
This is "story stock" that promises the future. But the insiders are telling you that they are not even confident in their
technology and the prospects of the firm. SZYM has only destroyed shareholder value, while paying themselves a
hefty sum. Folks that is your money they are screwing with!

Lets be honest with ourselves, does anyone on the board really think that algae oil is really going to be a competitive
substitute to the existing oils today? Especially when insiders are signaling to the market they are not confident at all?


16 Oct 2014, 01:02 PM


experienced
". . . does anyone on the board really think that algae oil is really going to be a competitive substitute to the
existing oils today?" Yes! Here's why:


The oils can be tailored for particular characteristics, and in that sense they can have a higher concentration
of the needed ingredients for a particular application, whether it be for cosmetics or coconut oil substitute.


Prices for natural ingredients like coconut or palm oil can fluctuate all over the place, as they did last year
during the typhoons that destroyed a large portion of the crop in the Philippines. Solazyme can produce the
key ingredient of these oils at a consistent price, often lower than the natural oil, which is attractive to major
customers.


The SEC rules play a role here. During the month prior to the release of a financial statement, a company
must observe a "silent period" so that no buyers or sellers can have an opportunity to act before the overall
financial picture is made available. However, if there were an event that had a significant impact on future
earnings or losses, or that dealt with a change in executive personnel, that event would have to be reported
immediately. Solazyme reported changes in its management and BOD in a timely manner. That they didn't
reported other events strongly suggests that there are no significant changes in overall outlook. For a writer,
especially with a financial interest in a stock (a short position in this case) to suggest the company is about to
go down the tubes, with no real factual basis, says as much as you need to know.

When a reporter from the Oklahoman and some other Tulsa newspaper (which is the only career background
provided on Ms. Colberg's bio on the SS website) come out and tell investors that a company is worth zero
and a good short "in her opinion," I think you may be on to something regarding the peak of bearishness. My
only guess is that the reason there are no true financial statement or industry analysis or projections is
because these would be above the author's level of understanding and education.

Halloween ghouls they fill the night, here comes Street Creeper to take your treats and nudge you to take flight!


Take heart, anyone who's read other Creeper snipes already know Sonya (if there really is a Sonya)is a paid hack.
'experienced' and others have already debunked the inaccuracies, so i'll turn my attention to other obvious, though
minimally covered points.


1) The author appears not to know SZYM. 
2) A 'real' Short wouldn't Short a company she has no knowledge of.  
3) Gross inaccuracies are effective at bringing share price down


Does anyone know if Creeper (the company) is paid to write these hits and if so what it might cost? If so, i'm guessing
less accuracy is a sign of a cheaper price (detailed research being discounted).

Solazyme: It Isn't Easy (Or Profitable) Being Green --- OR IS IT?


With Solazyme's ability to create tailored oils from fast growing algae with the ability too make better oils for industry,
for home, people and their pets, or livestock. Can crude oil compare with SZYM? I don't believe I've ever heard of
Chevron making flour or cooking oils. It's an oil company but it's so much more, how it can be associated with oil
companies I'll never understand, unless of course were talking about Soladiesel or Solajet fuels. What SZYM has
done with algae (so many different products) is nothing short of miraculous. And all of these miracles are created
without using our farm lands. Yes, I know sugarcane! But what if SZYM were too buy or partner with Proterro?
Wouldn't SZYM have all the feedstock they need? So in the end, all were talking about is the infrastructure to
accomplish it and to do it in a timely manner. If the big oil companies can build huge seagoing oil drilling platforms in a
timely manner, why not SZYM!

If you look SZYM Form 8-K, SZYM' SIC Code: Industrial Organic Chemicals. Industry: Oil & Gas Operations.
Sector: Energy. Current, I think SZYM is in oil and energy sector, not in food industry. With the oil and energy
sectors at big correction now , less transparency of top managements and still in negative profit, it make
sense that the SZYM is going to lower and lower. Let us wait the ER on 11/5/2014, I hope this ER will make
some change of the view of SZYM. If everything is right and the top managements can be trusted, SZYM will
have a bright future. Long SZYM.

will be classified as in the future.

1 Question is: Who controls SIC classifications? When SZYM started their foray was into biofuels (DoD, et al).
Who is responsible to submit a change? Who authorizes it? Is it part of SEC ER process?


2 Question is: When will SIC come into the 21st century. The problem of assigning codes to biotech in general
has been an issue as far back as the genesis of Genentech. Again is it self-reporting? Should it be reviewed?
By whom?


In this case, it makes it easier to expand holdings in this bearish environment.

I've observed from attacks on other stocks, that Street Creeper (the alleged author Red Sonya) never replies
directly. Instead, you'll see commentary from other Shorts, probably sponsors of the Creeper attacks.


I like to see objective commentary which goes against my position. Smart Shorts can help you test your
thesis. Creeper attacks i've seen are mostly lies and innuendo that often need some time to validate and can
have near term adverse effects on stock price.


Most Longs that bail are probably day traders or have a limited understanding of the company. With SZYM,
most of us already know that profits aren't going to come until nameplate capacity is reached. Building
industries of this scale is highly complex and require lots of adjustments along the way to optimize production.


We get in early because we hope that management is conservative in their estimates and we want a good
price before the herd stampedes in.


When we really believe in our investment. Street Creeper's can create opportunity, giving us better prices to
increase our position.

I have no position in this company and no plans to initiate one...yet.


My company has received samples of the algal oil and Encapso material. We are excited to evaluate these. They
have some unique properties not seen with other renewable oils. I wouldn't be so quick to discount the company as
they are carving an important niche in the market. In fact, they are making an effort to branch-out into some other
areas of application, our company is of one of such. About two months ago we had reps from Solazyme here for a
meeting - they presented some compelling data.

Hi Kevin,


Unfortunately, since I work in R&D, I cannot tell you any more and we are also working under an NDA. We

One of the applications is so far out - even Solazyme was surprised. :-)


My point is there might be more to their algal oils than people think. In my industry, they are a relative
unknown right now....but that is changing as they are on a strong effort to expand their sales (evident since

Well with SZYM's earnings report coming soon, I decided to pick his brain.  
The answer I got from him was @$7.00 he started buying like crazy, typically after the E/R the stock price moves up.
He's an excellent adviser and his opinion and mine are in total agreement about SZYM. Solazyme may be a little

HOW MUCH IS CLEAN AIR WORTH TO YOU?


Fuels made from algae oil burn cleaner than fossil fuels and require no drilling to acquire, which means fewer
greenhouse gas emissions from the beginning to the end of the fuel's life cycle. Wolfson said Solazyme's diesel fuels
can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 85 percent versus petroleum diesel, when you take into account
the drilling, shipping and refining required in traditional fuel. To me it's absolutely insane not to use a fuel that's 85%
cleaner than fuels made from crude oil. We could use electric cars and trucks but the power grid would never handle
it. Seems to me that Solazyme is the answer for vehicles or power generating stations for electric cars. How long will
it take for oil companies to get smart and use Solazyme's technology and patents to produce the fuels of the future?

You are of course correct futuretrade, but many investors have a "what have you done for me lately mindset"
so projecting what makes sense economically about 10 years from now (unfortunately I think it may take this
long) doesn't mean much to many in a "what can you do for me this week" world.

Man it is so quiet out there, with no new postings it's downright boring. 
At least no insider sales have popped up. Nevertheless, I've been doing some buying at these levels (tax loss
strategies) in the hopes of seeing higher prices by year end. I figured if Mr. Burbank had the guts to add to his

my prayers that JW and company will announce some contracts and updated production numbers to meet these
deals.


Long SZYM - and keeping my fingers crossed.

Personally, I don't think we will see a bottom much below 5.50 and if good news starts coming we may be at a
current bottom right now. Of course, we were already very near 5.50 recently. We might go back there, but I
doubt much below that.

Now that I've calmed down and put away the tar and feathers, I realize that this was always a possibility, just
didn't think it would go this low. 
This little setback doesn't take away from Solazyme's huge promise, crude oil will come back up and SZYM
will also and more.  
You can call me stupid but I'm STILL LONG ON SZYM

The oils seem to be a slippery business.


The commodity market price of palm oil seems to have gone below the price point where SZYM can make a
decent profit on the spread. As most of their business is commodity based it seems they'll need to figure out
how to hedge to protect investor value.


With their value below cash on hand I wonder if they may be a buy out target. Believe i heard in the CC they
have $250M cash. Would appreciate any insights.

With the Saudi's lowering oil prices, To me, it looks like if U.S. oil companies want to keep drilling, they may need too
start using more efficient drilling mud and cut costs or shut down... (ENCAPSO!!!) LONG SOLAZYME!!!

SZYM 11/05/2014 Forecast EPS -.42 I've been looking into my crystal ball and I believe it's going to be better than
forecast. In my opinion anyway.

Forecast EPS -.42 , REV 19.22M. Last Q, Act.EPS -0.56, REV 15.939. Same Q Last year, Act. EPS -0.47
REV 10.621. Hope tomorrow, EPS -0.41 and REV 19.30M. I will be very happy.

The conference call yesterday confirms SZYM senior management is in over their head. If they can't get the
manufacturing facilities operating as planned they can't scale up production and resultant revenues. Great science
and products, poor manufacturing execution. The 45 print today on the 5% converts is not a good sign for the equity.
Danger Will Robinson! Full disclosure: long term holder of equity.

"Great science and products, poor manufacturing execution" >> Totally agree, maybe it's time for J.W. to step
down or explain why he shouldn't.

Reading the Bloomberg article, it seems the main reason why the revenues will miss by about 200 million next year is
the fact that the JV will not be consolidated as planned. I'm at a loss why this is not happening? The plant is up and
running albeit not at nameplate capacity. So if they consolidated at least the numbers would not look so ugly. From my
reading of past CC's I got the impression that there was a high probability of consolidation in 2015. Now management
is saying 2016. 
I'm so disgusted I'm hoping for a "white Knight" to buy them out at $10.
