Qihoo's Browser: Rosy Claims In The Middle Of A Crisis
May 15, 2012 11:32 AM ET10 comments
by: Matt Berry


Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd (QIHU) was at "war" with Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK)
in the fall of 2010. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) ‒ often said to be the Google of China ‒
has a Statistics page, and on it Qihoo's browser market share apparently falls off a cliff.


However, at precisely this time period, Qihoo was approaching US capital markets with
claims of strong growth.


"360 Safe Browser and 360 Personal Start-up Page, two of our key platform
products, achieved stronger growth in their active user base than what had
been expected for the January 2011 valuation. .... In connection with the January
2011 valuation, we forecast that the daily active users of 360 Personal Start-up
Page would increase 55% from the end of December 2010 to 45 million at the end
of 2011."


(Prospectus March 2011: All emphasis here and in other citations are mine.)


Which is it? A market share disaster or stronger than expected growth?


And the "Personal Start-up Page" is the default page for the browser. If the browser gets
hurt, doesn't the other feel the pain?


Could it be that I misread Baidu's statistics? That my paid translator and the Google
translator both got the description wrong? Or perhaps there is some data-gathering quirk
on the part of Baidu?


It's a small matter, because even if we discarded Baidu's statistics, it would still be difficult
to draw a different conclusion: the fact that there was a disaster and that it affected
revenue is supported by other sources … including Qihoo itself.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/590451-qihoos-browser-rosy-claims-in-the-middle-of-a-crisis 2/10


Here is a mention of the October 2010 fight in Qihoo's latest SEC 20-F filing.


"In October 2010, Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Ltd. and Shenzhen
Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited, or Tencent, brought an unfair
competitive practices claim against us in the Chaoyang District People's Court of
Beijing, alleging that we misled users with statements that Tencent's QQ instant
messaging program invades users' privacy and seeking retraction of the statements
and RMB4.0 million in damages. In September 2011, the court ruled that our
actions constituted unfair competition and awarded RMB0.4 million ($63,553) as
damages to Tencent."


So there was definitely something going on here. News reports out of China also mention
a tit-for-tat battle, with legal suits, public smearing, and some technical dirty tricks. It was
widely reported in Chinese, but you can read about it in English in the 2011 QIHU SEC
filed 20-F (from page 81) and at Caixin Online. (Put "Qihoo" in the search box.) The war
reached a climax with Tencent's popular messaging product, "QQ." According to Caixin
Online,


"Tencent announced in November 2010 that because Qihoo's antivirus software was
destroying QQ's ability to protect user information, the company was shutting down
QQ on any computers with Qihoo software installed, forcing users to choose
between the two companies. According to Tencent, about 15 million users removed
Qihoo software as a result." (here)


What had begun as a spat between a messaging service and anti-virus software
apparently escalated into an attempt to shut all of Qihoo down. As the Wall Street Journal
reported:


An attempt by The Wall Street Journal to run QQ on computers with 360 products
Wednesday night resulted in a window reading: "360 malware damages the safe
operation of QQ, and therefore threatens the safety of QQ accounts. We urge you to
uninstall all 360 products before normally running QQ." (here)


According to Baidu's statistics page the damage lasted until April 2011. And what was
Qihoo saying in its prospectus? The browser (and its default startup page) played a "key"
role in the prospectus and supposedly, the business. (emphasis mine)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/590451-qihoos-browser-rosy-claims-in-the-middle-of-a-crisis 3/10


We have achieved significant business development since January 2011, which we
believe contributed approximately 70% to 85% of the increase in the fair value of
our ordinary shares.


360 Safe Browser and 360 Personal Start-up Page, two of our key platform
products, achieved stronger growth in their active user base than what had
been expected for the January 2011 valuation. …. As of March 10, 2011, 360
Personal Start-up Page's daily active users reached 40 million in less than three
months, which suggests that we had underestimated the success of this
product at the time of the January 2011 valuation. We expect that the increase
in the active user base of these two platform products will generate more
revenue and net income in 2011 and future periods.


snapshot of the above SEC filing)


We have heard very different messages from Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd when it finds
itself under contrasting circumstances.


For example, when Qihoo needed capital from the US markets it needed to present itself
as strong and growing. They "achieved stronger growth in their active user base than what
had been expected for the January 2011 valuation."


But now in the ongoing legal battle with Tencent, Qihoo needs to present itself as
vulnerable and damaged. From the current legal battle, information is just now emerging
about Qihoo's apparent catastrophe at precisely the time it was also preparing its
prospectus. Here's an article that appeared in the Chinese media April 20, 2012 and which
sums up the situation:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/5/14/582827-1337013940040705-Matt-Berry_origin.jpg
5/21/2018 Qihoo's Browser: Rosy Claims In The Middle Of A Crisis - QIHOO 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (NYSE:QIHU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/590451-qihoos-browser-rosy-claims-in-the-middle-of-a-crisis 4/10


Tencent announced they had made "a hard decision": they would force users to
"choose one or the other." If users wanted to install the 360 software, they could not
use QQ. 18 hours later, through mediation by the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology and other government departments, the guns on both sides
fell silent. A year and a half later, during hearings at the Guangdong Supreme
Court, Qihoo revealed that during those 18 hours, their user base shrank by 20
million, resulting in enormous losses. (Translated. Original is here)


The only difference between the two accounts is the extent of the damage. Did they lose
15 million users or 20 million? The fact however that severe damage was inflicted is
affirmed by both parties. How does Qihoo reconcile this damage with the prospectus?


As of March 10, 2011, 360 Personal Start-up Page's daily active users reached 40
million in less than three months, which suggests that we had underestimated the
success of this product at the time of the January 2011 valuation.


This is not the only confusion surrounding Qihoo's browser. Wasn't Qihoo supposed to
have dominated the market last September? Qihoo, in their 2011 third quarter
announcement:


Our browsers' user penetration hit a record high of 57%, effectively becoming the
market leader in September.


What does Baidu's statistic's page have to say about Qihoo's market share for September
2011?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/590451-qihoos-browser-rosy-claims-in-the-middle-of-a-crisis 5/10


Not even close. Qihoo's misleading claim was first brought to my attention by Citron
Research, using different sources. However, if I played the Devil's Advocate, the only
explanation that makes sense to me is that Qihoo's browser statistics were supposed to
refer to software sitting on the hard-drive along with other bundled software, most of it
unused -- while Baidu's statistics refer to actual use.


The title to Baidu's statics page reads, 浏览器市场份额. Google translates this as
"Browser market share" (here) while Qihoo often speaks of "user penetration." If "user
penetration" means "market share," it is difficult to see how Qihoo did not lie to investors.
If it does not mean market share, Qihoo has still misled investors with their September
statement.


I have to say this because the latest 20-F filing puts the matter differently:


360 browsers, which together had 255 million monthly active users and a user
penetration rate of 59.5% in China in December 2011, according to iResearch. The
user penetration rate for 360 browsers is second only to Microsoft Internet Explorer
in China.


This is a very different statement from the one made last September. First, Qihoo and
Microsoft cannot both have more than 50% market dominance -- which brings us to the
question: Was Qihoo referring to data other than market leadership last September? ...
while claiming market leadership? Also note that Qihoo now drops the claim of being the
market leader and leaves open the possibility that we are speaking of software sitting on
hard drives, unused. But there are still problems with this attempt to excuse Qihoo:


First, it would mean the actual use of their browser is not anywhere near what investors at
large believe it to be.


Second, just as no software brags about being a "memory hog" how can you brag about
hogging space on the hard-drive?


And then, if the word "penetration" does not mean "usage", why should we trust what they
have to say about the market "penetration" of their other products?


And lastly, the September statement did not leave much room for ambiguity and which
clearly aided the belief that we were indeed talking about market share.

"Market leader" ... means market leader, and not software sitting dormant on a hard drive.
Qihoo needs to explain exactly what they mean by "user penetration" and "market leader."
Microsoft was clearly the market leader at this time.


Our browsers' user penetration hit a record high of 57%, effectively becoming the
market leader in September.


The second half of this sentence is simply untrue, and it renders the first half not merely
incomplete, but clearly misleading.


And if we dial the clock back a bit more, we remember the statements made in the
prospectus, where Qihoo had clearly been referring to the "Monthly Active Users" of its
browser and claimed that its "percentage of the then total Internet users in China" came in
at 44% for January 2011:


The following table shows the monthly active users for our primary security
products and platform products, both in an absolute number and as a percentage
of the then total Internet users in China as reported by iResearch:


Monthly Active Users of: December 2009 January 2011


(in millions, except percentages)


360 Safe Browser 106 35.8% 172 44.1%


This is difficult to reconcile with Baidu's statistics.

I use Qihoo browser at home. The browser uses IE core as it is, and adds some antivirus functions. Thus
Qihoo may not have its own browser per se.

User penetration here only means if you are a user of qihoo's browser or not. So in theory 2nd place can have over
50% of user penetration, because one person can use more than one browser. 
Qihoo's statement about 59% user penetration should be interpreted as 59% of chinese web users have used their
browser sometimes in the past. 
Again, monthly active user is similar to user penetration, but within one month time period, and it is not market share.
Think of facebook and twitter, how can you measure the market share between them? Most of us use both. A
measure of user number is better.


And yes, the market share of Qihoo's browser is between 20% to 30% according to different sources, it is by far the
most dominant browser after IE in China.

If Qihoo meant by 59% user penetration that 59% of chinese web users have used their browser in the past,
that would be a terribly misleading and dishonest statement, because that it clearly not what the sentence
means. Past users who do not currently use the browser should obviously not be included. What if all of the
59% were past users, and none were current users, then Qihoo would have 0% user penetration, while
claiming they had 59%.

“Qihoo's statement about 59% user penetration should be interpreted as 59% of chinese web users have
used their browser sometimes in the past.”


... and the rest of the time it sat on the hard drive unused. Which is exactly the point: Qihoo’s statistic does not
measure usage rates between competing browsers answering the question: which browser is USED the
most?


The answer to that question would be Microsoft. Qihoo’s claim of being “effectively the market leader” was
false.


Usage rates settling leadership between two browsers vs. mere possession of software: Of the two why
would Qihoo choose the statistic that provided the least clarity and relevance?


Additionally the key point of the article is untouched: Qihoo claimed a robust browser during precisely the time
it was being strangled to death by Tencent. Investors were clearly misled with the prospectus and its claims
for January 2011.


Re: facebook vs. twitter


Microsoft and Qihoo browsers are mutually exclusive 
Tencent and Qihoo are Host and Parasite. When Tencent put on the flea collar, Qihoo fell off … within 18
hours.

You can estimate current user number using stats such as monthly active user, or daily active user. 
There might be a time window to these user penetration measurements (which is the number of user/internet
population, and not market share) , like user penetration of a particular month. Not necessarily just in the past, but
sometimes in the past.

That number was 44% for January 2011.


Try to make that work with Baidu's statistic page: http://bit.ly/LSIcyJ


Slide the date to span the single month of January for 2011.


Don't forget we are talking about "monthly active users" " as a percentage of the then total Internet users in
China".


Monthly  
Users 
% of total


You won't find Qihoo's 360 browser. Then slide the dates to span the year, click on Qihoo 360's "block", and
you will see how Qihoo's claims in the prospectus do not reconcile with Baidu's stats. (If we are referring to
"TheWorld" ... that comes in at 2%.)


But it really doesn't matter which method you use. Qihoo's claims don't hold up. Add the above to the fact that
Qihoo claims in court that it was severely damaged by Tencent during the very time it was putting its glowing
prospectus together. Whatever method you use the claims made in the prospectus do not match reality ... and
by a very wide margin.

Here's another source for browser share AND utilization that doesn't triangulate with QIHU's statements:
http://bit.ly/LA9n50


Also worth touching on the 380rmb per paid user per month statistic they spew for their web games. No web game
platform in the world gets that kind of ARPPU per month (that's ~$60/mo... in China of all places).


You should also read up on iResearch, the source for most of their claims. They're owned and operated by Focus
Media, another Chinese company in the cross hairs of further fraud allegations. I peppered their US rep with
questions about their sources for their "personal webpage" traffic statistics and he was not helpful at all in explaining
any of their statistics. They gave the same tired line of "Alexa only works on internet explorer" (which is not true) and
"Google Adplanner gets blocked by Qihoo 360's antivirus." This relates to QIHU's other claim that they now outrank
hao123.com in terms of monthly uniques (you'll find that Alexa & Adplanner have hao123.com well ahead...).

The comments in the article also give some hints as to why QIHU may have passed Deloitte's audit this year. "We are
subject to reporting obligations under US securities laws. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related
rules require a public company to include a management report on the company's internal control over financial
reporting. These requirements will first apply to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending on Dec. 31,

when they can resign next year? Audit fees also increased from $210k in 2010 to $867k in 2011 (not including fees
