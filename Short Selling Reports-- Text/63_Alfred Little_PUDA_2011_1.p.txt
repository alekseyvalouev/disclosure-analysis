Puda Coal Chairman Sells Half the Company; Pledges the Other Half
to Chinese PE Investors
Apr. 11, 2011 2:44 AM ET114 comments
by: Alfred Little


Chinese RTO Puda Coal, Inc (NYSEMKT:PUDA) Chairman Ming Zhao transferred the
ownership of PUDA’s sole Chinese operating entity, Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd
(“Shanxi Coal”), to himself in 2009 without shareholder approval according to official
government filings. Then, in 2010, Zhao sold 49% and pledged the other 51% of Shanxi
Coal to CITIC Trust Co., Ltd (“CITIC”), a Chinese private equity fund, for RMB245 million
($37.1 million).


Zhao then recklessly leveraged Shanxi Coal by borrowing RMB3.5 billion ($530.3 million)
from CITIC at an incredibly high 14.5% annual interest rate (including fees) to finance the
development of its coal mines. PUDA shareholders are completely unaware of these
transactions that decimate the value of its U.S. listed shares.


Background – An Industry Facing Government Mandated Consolidation


According to PUDA’s 2010 10-K filing:


In order to improve production efficiency, workplace safety and to reduce coal mine
accidents, the Shanxi provincial government issued a policy in 2009 requiring
mergers and consolidations of smaller coal mining companies in Shanxi Province.
Pursuant to the government policy, the government awarded certain selected larger
coal production enterprises the opportunity to acquire, consolidate and restructure
smaller coal mines through mergers, acquisitions and asset or share transfers.


The aggressive government mandated consolidation of the coal mining industry beginning
in 2009 coincided with the darkest days of the world financial crisis. PUDA management
either had to become a consolidator, requiring massive additional capital, or else dispose
of its coal businesses. Management, lead by Chairman Ming Zhao, made the decision to
pursue aggressive growth by becoming a consolidator. Unfortunately for PUDA, during the
financial crisis, the U.S. capital markets were completely closed. Therefore, in September
2009, Chairman Ming Zhao made a fateful first step to attract Chinese domestic investors:
he transferred the ownership of Shanxi Coal to himself.

PUDA Chairman Ming Zhao Takes Action, Stealing Shanxi Coal from U.S.
Shareholders


In order to raise money domestically, Zhao needed to sever the direct foreign shareholder
ownership of Shanxi Coal, PUDA’s sole Chinese operating subsidiary. On 9/3/09, Yao
Zhao (Ming Zhao’s brother and the legal representative of PUDA’s WFOE, Shanxi Putai
Resources Limited, “Putai”) illegally authorized Putai to transfer 90% of Shanxi Coal to
Ming Zhao, adding to the 8% Ming Zhao already held. Additionally, Yao Zhao divided his
own 2% of Shanxi Coal between Ming Zhao and Wei Zhang.


An official copy of the “Notification of Share Registry Change” can be downloaded here
(.pdf), including a partial translation. The transfers resulted in Ming Zhao owning 99%
of Shanxi Coal, leaving U.S. investors with nothing. Incredibly, PUDA’s auditor,
Moore Stephens, failed to catch this theft of an entire company that is clearly
documented in government ownership filings that any lawyer can obtain directly
from the source.


After stealing Shanxi Coal from U.S. investors, Ming Zhao began looking for domestic
investors to fund his aggressive expansion plans. At the same time, Zhao brazenly
continued trying to raise money for PUDA in the U.S., despite the fact PUDA (without
Shanxi Coal) was just a shell company. As U.S. capital markets recovered, on 2/18/10,
PUDA sold 3.284 million shares in a public offering underwritten by Brean Murray and
Newbridge Securities raising $14.5 million (8-K here), without disclosing to the investors
that PUDA no longer owned Shanxi Coal, its sole operating subsidiary in China. Why did
Brean Murray fail to perform any basic legal due diligence on the real ownership of Shanxi
Coal?


Chairman Zhao Sells Half of Shanxi Coal and Borrows $530.3 Million at 14.5%


In July 2010, Zhao recklessly accepted a highly leveraged RMB2.745 billion ($416 million)
equity and debt investment from the $31.3 billion Chinese private equity arm of China
International Trust and Investment Company (“CITIC”, website here). On 7/15/10 Zhao
sold 49% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC for RMB245 million ($37.1 million) and pocketed
the proceeds. An official copy of the “Notification of Share Registry Change” can be
downloaded here, including a partial translation.


On 7/19/10 Zhao and Zhang pledged the other 51% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC as
security so that the company could obtain a 3-year loan for RMB2.5 billion ($379
million) at a cost of 14.5% (annual interest plus fees) from CITIC. (Note: Zhao pledged
50% and Wei Zhang pledged his 1% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC so that the entire remaining

51% of the company was thus pledged to CITIC). The loan was subsequently
increased to RMB3.5 billion ($530.3 million), bringing the combined investment to
RMB 3.745 billion ($567.4 million). The official filed copies of the share pledge
agreements detailing all these amounts can be downloaded here (.pdf) and here (.pdf).


As of 1/26/11, the outstanding principal, interest and fees payable under the 14.5% 3-year
loan agreement amounted to RMB5.0225 billion ($761 million). Annual interest and fees
on the loan are an incredible RMB507.5 million ($76.9 million USD), over twice the
$34 million EBIT shown in PUDA’s 2010 10-K filing. Shanxi Coal is now a highly
leveraged bet on Ming Zhao’s operational ability to dramatically increase coal production
and profitability enough to service the company’s crushing debt load. Any disruption could
lead to default and loss of the pledged shares to CITIC.


On 12/16/10, PUDA again tapped the U.S. capital markets, this time for $101.5 million by
selling 7.85 million shares at $12 per share in a public offering underwritten by Macquarie
Capital and Brean Murray (8-K here). PUDA again failed to disclose Chairman Zhao’s
9/3/09 illegal transfer of 99% of Shanxi Coal to himself, nor Zhao’s illegal sale of 49% of
Shanxi Coal to CITIC for $37.1 million, nor the $530.3 million 14.5% loan from CITIC
secured by the pledge of the remaining 51% of Shanxi Coal shares. Why did Macquarie
Capital also fail to perform basic legal due diligence on the real ownership of Shanxi Coal,
half of which had been already sold to CITIC? Furthermore, at $12 per share, Macquarie
investors paid over six times the $1.91 valuation CITIC paid for 49% of Shanxi Coal in July
(see my discussion of valuation at the end of this report).


Chairman Zhao Secretly Returns a Portion of the Shanxi Coal to the Rightful Owner


In a partial attempt to cover up his theft of the company, Chairman Zhao and Wei Zhang
transferred their pledged 51% interest in Shanxi Coal to Shanxi Puda Mining Industry Ltd
(“Puda Mining”), a former 100% owned subsidiary of Shanxi Coal that, through
suspicious shareholder shuffling, Zhao maneuvered to make it the 51% parent of Shanxi
Coal. Puda Mining’s 51% interest in Shanxi Coal continues to be completely pledged to
CITIC (see official agreement here (.pdf)).


According to the government filing (available here (.pdf)), Puda Mining shares are
now 90% owned by Putai (the WFOE), 8% Ming Zhao and 2% Yao Zhao. Following
these transfers, PUDA now owns only 45.9% (90% of 51%) of Shanxi Coal, about
half of the 90% PUDA owned before Chairman Zhao began his shenanigans.


PUDA’s 2009 and 2010 Audited Financials can No Longer be Relied Upon

https://seekingalpha.com/article/262779-puda-coal-chairman-sells-half-the-company-pledges-the-other-half-to-chinese-pe-investors 4/32


Since Ming Zhao stole 99% of Shanxi Coal in 2009, the operating company’s 2009 and
2010 financials should not have been consolidated into PUDA’s 2009 and 2010 audited
financials. PUDA’s audited 2009 and 2010 financials can thus no longer be relied
upon. For 2011, even though Zhao recently returned 45.9% of Shanxi Coal to PUDA
through its 90% ownership of Puda Mining (the 51% owner of Shanxi Coal), Puda Mining’s
51% interest in Shanxi Coal is entirely pledged to CITIC.


PUDA Cannot Consolidate Shanxi Coal’s Financials in 2011 and Beyond


Since CITIC has 100% control of Shanxi Coal, via its 49% ownership plus 51% share
pledge agreement including voting, veto and other control provisions, PUDA can no
longer consolidate the financial results of this subsidiary (see SFAS 94 page 5
Section 4 link here (.pdf)). PUDA should record its stake in Shanxi Coal as a long-
term investment on its balance sheet, valued at cost.


The damage done cannot be reversed. There is no way CITIC will give up their 49% of
Shanxi Coal, 51% pledged shares, veto rights and other control provisions. Shanxi Coal
owes CITIC over $761 million. Until this debt is repaid (if ever), the share pledge and other
control provisions will certainly persist. PUDA is now just a holding company with a
minority 45.9% investment in a coal operation in China it does not control, with the
added overhead of being a public company (for now at least) in the U.S.


What is PUDA’s Investment in Shanxi Coal Worth?


The book value of PUDA on 12/31/10 was $251 million. Shanxi Coal owns all the mining
assets, coal washing plants, cash and receivables and bears the obligation to repay the
debt reflected on PUDA’s 12/31/10 balance sheet. The 12/31/10 book value of Shanxi
Coal is therefore roughly the same as the 12/31/10 book value of PUDA. I need only to
deduct an estimated RMB184 million ($27.7 million) in placement fees and accrued
interest on the CITIC loan from the book value of Shanxi Coal, bringing its book value
down to $223.3 million. Since PUDA shareholders now only own 45.9% of Shanxi Coal,
multiplying $223.3 million by 45.9% gives a value of $102.5 million for PUDA’s Shanxi
Coal investment. Dividing $102.5 million that by 30.02 million PUDA shares outstanding at
12/31/10 values PUDA at $3.41 per share.


There is significant risk of default due to the very high leverage and servicing cost of the
$530.3 million 14.5% debt of Shanxi Coal. Annual interest and fees on the loan total $76.9
million USD, more than twice times the $34 million EBIT PUDA generated from operations

in 2010. Even if Shanxi Coal can grow its profit by 80% in 2011 (as CFO Laby Wu
claimed here) to $61.2 million, this growth is insufficient to cover 2011’s $76.9
million interest expense implying Shanxi Coal may incur an operating loss in 2011.


Shanxi Coal is now racing to dramatically increase coal production and profitability from its
mines before it defaults on the massive debt load. A default could force the transfer of the
pledged shares to CITIC and result in a total loss for PUDA’s U.S. investors. Given the
risks, I believe PUDA deserves to be valued at a discount to the $3.41 value of its Shanxi
Coal investment.


Apparently, CITIC agrees with me, since the $37.12 million price CITIC paid for their
49% of Shanxi Coal divided by 19.82 million PUDA shares outstanding at the end of
the third quarter (when the acquisition occurred) equals only a $1.91 per share
valuation.


The average of the valuation CITIC paid ($1.91) and the book value of PUDA’s
investment in Shanxi Coal ($3.41) is $2.66. Considering the 2009 and 2010 audited
financials can no longer be relied upon, and more importantly, the complete lack of
internal control that allowed Chairman Zhao to first steal the company, then sell half
the company (pocketing the proceeds) and then pledge the other half of the
company to a Chinese PE fund while piling on $530.3 million of 14.5% debt, I
strongly believe $2.66 is the most this stock is worth today.


Note: I would like to thank GeoInvesting LLC for obtaining official copies of all the
ownership, loan and share pledge records that I cited and linked in this report.


Disclosure: I am short PUDA.

I just started trading stocks less than a year ago and day trade with half of my portfolio. The other "secure" half of my
portfolio is almost entirely made up of Puda Coal stocks and LPH which is another Chinese coal stock. 
If you own Puda Coal Stocks, The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a securities class action to help Puda Coal
shareholders recover their investment losses. You can join this class action suit by visiting their website at

I love how the allegation is that CITIC bought half the company for $37 million and then is willing to make a secure
loan for $500 million plus against the other half. Yeah right. And where exactly is all this loan money on their balance
sheet?


I also can't fathom why Seeking Alpha is publishing this when they are being sued by the last article written by this
guy on Deer (another chinese company).

Author’s reply »  PUDA Trading halted. Means only one thing. Chairman Ming Zhao has admitted my report (based

Or it could mean that you haven't answered simple questions like 1.) where is the alleged $530 million in loan
money, 2.) why don't you account for the recent $100 million equity sale in your valuation, 3.) why would a
CITIC loan $530 million against half a company they valued at $37 million? Etc.

I don't mind genuine analysis on companies, but your lack of addressing of some very basic valuation
questions in your 'analysis' make this feel more like a self-serving short hatchet job.

Ever considered the possibility that DEER is a total fraud? IMO, the problem in PUDA is 10x smaller than the
ones behind DEER.


PUDA is totally amazing. Just look at how the investment bankers, auditors, lawyers as well as the Board of
Directors all failed jobs to serve and protect the shareholders.


11 Apr 2011, 12:35 PM


Stone Fox Capital, Contributor
Exactly. It's very possible that Geo uncovered an attempt at a fraudulent transfer, but Alfred did a hatchet job
trying to explain the implications to PUDA.


- the loan is puzzling and especially the analysis. Some how PUDA has to pay the interest though they didn't
get the money.  
- where did the money go and why didn't Geo attempt to figure it out? 
- PUDA had been paying for the consolidated mines so how would the ownership transfer to a guy that made
a fraudulent transfer? 
- Chairman MZ has continued to invest in PUDA as if the company still exists. Hence, he knows any transfer
wasn't legal.  
- CITIC has done nothing to suggest they recognize the purchase of/loan to Shanxi Coal. Why are they letting
PUDA pay for and claim mines that they lent supposedly $570M for? 
- If the claims are true why won't PUDA be made whole from the considerable assets of MZ?


The assumptions seem to assume that all the assets were stolen and now PUDA is just screwed. Under what
legal system can you take assets from and add debts to a company?


11 Apr 2011, 04:11 PM


Stone Fox Capital, Contributor
What makes you think Chairman Ming Zhao won't be required to make PUDA whole? He has considerable
assets.


Also, why didn't you contact the involved parties as you clearly stated you would do after the DEER
allegations? If CITIC loaned MZ all that money, don't you think they might be more involved in the operations?
Half a billion and they just disappear... Seriously?


It really seems that you don't want any answers on the actual implications to PUDA. Loan isn't PUDAs, mine
consolidations are, MZ has to repay damages (his 30% of Phase 2 and 30% ownership of PUDA would cover
most of it alone).


MZ can't just transfer all the assets to himself and he gets a high five for being clever.

From the PR newswire:


"The full board, including Mr. Ming Zhao, the Chairman of Puda Coal, has agreed to cooperate in the investigation.
Although the investigation is in its preliminary stages, evidence supports the allegation that there were transfers by
Mr. Zhao in subsidiary ownership that were inconsistent with disclosure made by the Company in its public securities
filings. Mr. Zhao has agreed to a voluntarily leave of absence as Chairman of the Board of the Company until the
investigation is complete. The New York Stock Exchange has halted trading in the Company's stock."

Very nice post. A good follow up topic would be something about how chain of title works in China for stolen property
(the laws vary tremendously among the countries), bona fide purchasers, etc.


11 Apr 2011, 02:34 PM


Stone Fox Capital, Contributor
that would've been a better topic for the first article. The investment decision in PUDA now depends highly on
the title implications for stolen property. Not to mention the consolidated mines that PUDA obtained after this
illegal transfer. The actions of MZ suggest that he doesn't believe the title transfer was accurate or legal.
Remember he invested in the projects along with PUDA. After all, if he owned all from Shanxi Coal why was
he dealing with PUDA?

Stone, no its not.


I used to think as you did, but I learned a very valuable lesson -- you have to understand that it takes more than a
legitimate business to have a legitimate stock.


The burden of proof and transparency to be publicly traded is very high!


Even if Alfred is wrong on 99% of what he writes, if PUDA cannot justify to auditors, etc, that everything is on the
level, the stock will fail (delist, etc), even if the company is quite solvent.


That's the key that me and so many longs of chinese stocks didnt get, and some still don't get. If there are
inconsistencies with what is audite, reported and dislosed, regardless of whether it has to fraud, cultural differences,
or just plain sloppiness, the stock runs a high risk of losing their auditor and being delisted.


11 Apr 2011, 05:03 PM


Stone Fox Capital, Contributor
huh? Ultimately its about what the company owns and has nothing to with inconsistencies with the audits. We
pay management to make sure everything is correct and the auditors to confirm that work, but ultimately any
fraud or errors committed will impact the value of the company. Management and the auditors will lose their
jobs and investors might lose money.


Its when the reports are materially wrong that problems exist not inconsistencies.


12 Apr 2011, 12:54 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
Yes, it ultimately comes down to what PUDA or the public co shareholders owns. Based on the Chinese
government records, it looks like PUDA, at best, still has 51% (questionable) interest in assets and, at worst,
is a piece of paper to nothing. This is why every investor interested in these kind of shady foreign RTOs with
weak corporation governance should at least spend a couple of hundred bucks to get a lawyer to check out
the legal structure. This is a lesson for the investors who failed to do that and lost money in PUDA. The
bankers didn't do that. The auditors didn't do that (it's unclear whether the 2009-2010 financials can even be
consolidated). The exchange apparently didn't pay any attention to that, until they decided to halt PUDA
yesterday. The board of directors totally failed their fiduciary duties. Net net, none of these matters now.
CITIC, as a domestic Chinese entity, obtains its equity ownership in a totally legal transactions under PRC
jurisdiction and US investors don't have a chance in any claim against them. Looks like PUDA stock is
destined to go on pink.

>>Ultimately its about what the company owns and has nothing to with inconsistencies with the audits.


No Stone, that is where you are wrong. If the audits are inconsistent, if the company cannot produce an audit,
the stock will not be compliant with listing requirements and will get delisted. You are then in RINO $1 - $2 a
share land with very little hope of recovery.


Don't ask the question "does the company has value". I am sure it does. What is relevant is "does the stock
have value". And if they cannot produced audited financials, the answer is, "no", or atleast, "very very little".


I don't see a recovery in this space until such time you have either 1) multiple successful takeovers, 2)
multiple successful investigation conclusions that result in either re-listing, timely filing, etc, or possibly 3)
massive verifiable insider buying.

I too am a small investor who had shares of Puda and was wondering the same thing. There are 3 or 4 law
firms in the US that are filing class action suits against Puda to try and recover at least some of the investors
money. I mentioned one of them in an earlier post here but if you google PUDA 3 or 4 come up. You just need
to register with them how many shares you have and they apparently are going to sue on all investors behalf.
They will also advise you on what rights you have in a case like this.

Since Ming Zhao stole 99% of Shanxi Coal in 2009 : 
Please explain 99% since Ming Zhao owned 8% already .. 
There was 92% to steel or ?


12 Apr 2011, 07:16 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Excellent catch! It makes sense to consider that Ming Zhao only stole what did not already
belong to him.


At the point of the illegal transfer in 2009, Zhao owned 8% of Shanxi Coal directly and another 43% through
his ownership of PUDA, for a total of 51%. Yao Zhao owned 2% directly and 11% through PUDA. Assuming
Yao consented to the transfer of his 13% interest, then Ming Zhao only stole 99%-51%-13% = 35%


Legally, though, I think Zhao did "steal" 99% in the sense that he had no right to make those transfers, even
of the shares that were rightly his since he had pledged them to the public company. Pledged shares cannot
be transferred, even to yourself, since that would potentially unencumber them.


Still, you have an excellent point and made a great catch.

I heard these equity pledges aren't really enforceable in Chinese courts since CSRC did not actually allow
individuals to file them until this year? So they are basically just pieces of paper sitting in a file cabinet

Thanks Alfred,


Ming Zhao owned 8% direct + 43% via PUDA = 51%. 
* These were pledged and could not be transferred right ?


Yao Zhao owned 2% direct + 11% via PUDA = 13%. 
* Then who owned 36% ?


Think this changes your ( worst scenario ) value $ 2,66.

Alfred, I just copied your words / calculations and have questions :


About Shanxi Coal at the point of the illegal transfer in 2009 : 
Ming Zhao owned 8% direct + 43% via PUDA makes 51%. 
Yao Zhao owned 2% direct + 11% via PUDA makes 13% 
** Means any others could only own 36% am I right ?


Later Zhao sold 49% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC and Zhao pledged 50% and Wei Zhang pledged his 1% of
Shanxi Coal to CITIC. 
According to the government filing and following all transfers, PUDA now owns only 45.9% (90% of 51%) of
Shanxi Coal. 
** Please explain what happened to 5,1% ( 10% of 51% ) ? 
** And about actual ownerships from Ming + Yao in PUDA ?


15 Apr 2011, 04:09 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  ** 36% you are correct, I believe 
** 5.1% belongs to Ming Zhao and Yao Zhao 
current actual ownership of Ming + Yao in PUDA according to 10-K is: 
MZ 25%, YZ 6%.

36% Puda ( from others in beginning ) have been changed 
to 90% from 50% ( 51% pledged minus 1% Zhang ) = 45% 
and 69% ( MZhao 25% / YZhao 6% ) from 45% = 31,05%. 
** Now we are missing 4,95% from the beginning right ? 
** Which value has 31,05% against money loaned so far ?


Also seems very important to figure out which ownerships 
were sold 49% and pledged 50% ( 1% belong Wei Zhang ) 
since time beginning Ming owned 51% + Yao owned 13%. 
** Also did Yao like loosing 13% minus 6% to his brother ?

Author’s reply »  Hi Poen, I agree it is all very confusing. But basically we all can agree MZ did some very
naughty dealing in shares he had no right to transfer 35%, 42%, 49%, who knows? Whether ultimately ( a
year from now) MZ can clean up the share transfers, sales and pledge is hard to say. But any company
borrowing billions at 14.5%, when nominal interest rates are only 6% is ludicrously leveraged. One slip and
whatever value anyone thinks it might have today could be gone. To convince me PUDA is a buy, therefore,
requires it to fall to the valuation CITIC paid, at least $2-$2.50. Even then if you buy the stock you don't have
the protection that CITIC has from the share pledge nor the interest payments they receive.

Alfred, You've answered a number of questions but you seem to have missed mine.


1. Why would CITIC buy half the company for $37 million and then loan $500+ million 'secured' against the other half?


2. Where did the money go? Even if $500 million has been loaned, it can only be understood in the context of what it
is used for. If they used a third of it it to buy more coal companies at 2-3x cash flow, another third to double profitability
on existing operations and the other third is still sitting in cash then the company is still sitting pretty.


Regardless, I frankly find it difficult to believe that the company actually got so much money (secured against ??) or
would even have been able to spend a good portion in the relatively short time since July of last year.

Maybe Ming Zhao is just preparing any big step within 3 years. 
During that time he has tools + money $ 379 million + 14,5% x 3 
( total about $ 545 million ) to expand buz or buy new coal mines.


So his shares 51% are valued minimum $ 545 million already. 
Could be more in future ..


Also remember "the government awarded certain selected larger coal production enterprises the opportunity
to acquire, consolidate and restructure smaller coal mines through mergers, acquisitions and asset or share
transfers" ...


13 Apr 2011, 01:24 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1) CITIC obviously must see the value of the mines. 
2) The money is being used for the development/upgrading of the mines, which is far more expensive than
PUDA tells investors (in my opinion). PUDA is not buying mines for 2-3x cash flow. More like 8x cash flow
after the upgrading expense.


I think Shanxi Coal is a very real business with good collateral that attracted CITIC. The problem is that U.S.
investors were robbed.

LLEN also claims to buy these ultra cheap mines, 2-3x EBITDA I believe, but then again they have Kabani

13 Apr 2011, 03:55 PM


oliver_sd
Thanks for your response.


I guess I still just don't see how you justify the valuation you use. You are primarily using the $37 million figure
(which questionably gives CITIC half) which is wholly incompatible with valuation suggested by the loans of
$761 million you report. Obviously CITIC made the loans based on the ability to pay interest which suggests
much higher valuations for Shanxi. I could just as easily and arbitrarily say that CITIC wouldn't have loaned
more than 1x revenues or earnings of a minimum of 1.5x interest. These imply values of $760 million (1x
debt) or $693 million (interest x 1.5 = EBIT x 6) for the business.


As for whether you can buy mines at 3x cash flow, let's not forget that if you are not a designated consolidor,
you must sell or shut down which leads to low valutations for the 65%+ mines that don't qualify. I'm sure that's
part of why CITIC is willing to provide financing.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Today, in distress due to the major legal issues pending and 14.5% debt burden, I don't see
how PUDA is worth much more than the $1.91 valuation CITIC paid for its 49% stake, all things considered.
CITIC is a major PE fund in China that undoubtedly did a thorough due diligence. Now, CITIC undoubtedly
has very high hopes for its investment, including obviously the expectation that Shanxi Coal can make the
high interest payments. But CITIC also might be pleased to exercise the share pledge agreement and take
over the other 51% of the company too. So I don't think its too wise to assume Shanxi Coal can earn much
more than it needs to service its interest payments. I definitely don't see Shanxi Coal paying off any significant
principal without refinancing. PUDA shareholders therefore need everything to work perfectly to see their
equity value increase from $2.66 during the next few years. It would be different if the high leverage only
carried the usual 6% price tag!


13 Apr 2011, 07:09 PM


oliver_sd
As an accountant, I'm sure you know that there are very few $72 million companies that can get $700 million
in loans. I will guarantee you that Shanxi is was worth far more than $72 million in July on this basis alone. No
lender or PE in the world would put that much on the line if that's what the security is worth. Plus, IMHO you
cannot use a pre-consolidator, low capital, low cash value as the basis of valuing a designated consolidator
company with $370+ million new cash (invested or not) and 13 new mines in Pinglu and Jianhe.


13 Apr 2011, 10:03 PM


Stone Fox Capital, Contributor
It still doesn't add up that CITIC bought half the company for $37M but was willing to lend $530M to them. In
what world does that make sense? Not to mention the 14.5% interest rate would be absurd and basically
wipeout all the income from the new mines. On top of that the majority of the money is needed now, but the
loan was last year and would've incurred millions in unwarranted interest expense.


How were US investors robbed? If MZ sold 49% of the company, then why isn't it that he sold his shares. Not
reporting it correctly is bad, but it doesn't involve robbing shareholders.


You've already shown that he returned 51% of the company and then with the recent $100M dilution we're
back to the expected shareholder levels. CITIC now owns what MZ use to own.


The impact of any loan is a wildcard, but nobody sees how CITIC would've loaned him $530M last year. Why
did they allow PUDA to perform all the consolidations and pay for the mines? Why haven't they come forward
with concerns over the public announcements?


Isn't it likely that MZ in fact used the sales proceeds to loan PUDA $35M and the loan proceeds much more
likely around $53M to invest in Phase II? Just a couple more examples of the assets that MZ has to make
shareholders in PUDA whole. Not to mention his 52% ownership in King Stone Energy valued at some
$250M.

Your scenario is a worst case scenario and isn't adding up. It feeds on the fear of investors that China is the
wild, wild west of investing. We're to believe that a very rich man in China just took money from US investors
for himself with no impact to him or ability to reclaim them. If China really operated that way, whats to keep
CITIC from just transferring all 100% to themselves or PUDA from taking them all back. Come on now, China
doesn't work that way!

He doesn't want to now the facts. Its better for his short case to stick to the company line. He even admits that
Shanxi Coal couldn't have handled that loan so why in the world does it still stick to its existence?


Not to mention, if it existed why in the heck would PUDA obtain partners for Phase II. You think CITIC might
be a little pissed off that they loaned all that money but now don't control 60% of Phase II.


Come on Little, your story doesn't fly. Why don't you trace where the money went? Have you contacted CITIC
yet? You really think they invested half a billion dollars in a operation that is trying to scam US investors?

Author’s reply »  Based on management's own comments of 80% growth in earnings in 2011 I don't see how they can

rights to replace the Zhao brothers and their two friends who previously controlled some 35% of PUDA via these
same shares. ...If all that is true, then would it not be that PUDA only lost 4 shareholders that were replaced by CITIC
and are still just as whole as they were before the transfer in 2009, making all this a exercise in rhetorical theater.
PUDA would be in violation on reporting since o9, but only for the ownership statements. The Zhao's would be in
violation of a improper share transfer.


Lastly, why would the Zhao's and friends damage Puda's investment in the operation they essentially founded. The
litigation on this will strangle this operation for years and prevent a sale or merger. If Puda were to reclaim it's capital,
the end result would be chaos. Those securities would be worth squat and business would cease. The loans would
then be called. Does he hate Americans enough to blow that much capital?


There is another story regarding these documents IMO.


14 Apr 2011, 10:50 PM


Stone Fox Capital, Contributor
Exercise in rhetorical theater indeed. Oddly Little never entertains the concept that MZ sold his own shares or will be
forced into that process. Nor does he entertain the concept that the loan amount is absurd for their needs especially
at the 14.5% rate. He even admits that they might not be able to repay the loan. Seriously, so MZ and his brother are
very rich men but they accept a loan that would wipeout the company they started? Yeah sure! It would be a non-
starter. Then, he goes on and ignores that MZ has all these assets tied up with PUDA not to mention his other
company in King Stone Energy. So I guess China law lets you steal money and keep it?


15 Apr 2011, 12:43 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Stone Fox,


We are all reliant upon the written record consisting of PUDA's SEC filings and its Chinese subsidiaries SAIC
ownership filings. My report is a very straightforward recitation of the written record followed by my best
attempt to show implications and draw conclusions.


You are hopeful that the 49% of Shanxi Coal MZ sold was perhaps his own shares. This seems unlikely since
it would leave him with essentially nothing (less than 2% after the subsequent rounds of financing). Why even
bother staying in the business? Therefore I am certain his unauthorized sale of 49% of Shanxi Coal was just
that; the sale of 49%. Now to resolve this perhaps the board will try to wipe out MZ's equity in PUDA and its
subsidiaries. That kind of threat may be hard to carry out in the PRC where MZ has home field advantage.
But maybe it could force him to settle, a likely outcome since he is quite wealthy.


A key question you raise is whether CITIC knew about PUDA's ownership of Shanxi Coal. CITIC definitely did
not know about PUDA's ownership at the time they purchased 49% of Shanxi Coal from MZ. They thought he
owned 99% as clearly shown at the time in the SAIC ownership records.


Subsequent to the sale, CITIC perhaps discovered PUDA's ownership when MZ transferred 45.9% of Shanxi
Coal he had pledge to CITIC back to Putai (PUDA's WFOE, via Shanxi Mining). A new share pledge was
signed with Puda Mining. If CITIC did any DD on these transfers they would have discovered Puda Mining

was 90% owned by Putai, PUDA's WFOE. But who knows if they did this DD? Perhaps CITIC still thinks
PUDA's interests in China do not overlap their own.


Why did CITIC loan so much money? Of course they must think it is a good project capable of servicing the
debt. But be careful assuming that means there is significant equity value today. Even if CITIC thinks the
equity value is high (which I am certain they will tell you some astronomical valuation), their huge high interest
debt overhang has to be serviced first before the equity value can be established. In other words, there is little
equity value until Shanxi Coal starts generating cashflow enough to service the debt load. I doubt they can
possibly make that happen until 2012 and it is a risky bet. Of course like any leveraged investment, if they
succeed the equity returns could be high. But considering the way MZ defrauded U.S. shareholders, I am
completely unwilling to bet on any sudden change of heart on his part in favor of investors. If there is upside I
suspect it will all accrue to MZ and CITIC.


15 Apr 2011, 02:21 AM


wirestripper
I agree Stone fox, and I might add that the first story I read had the citic valuation of PUDA at something like
$2.91 per share, and in the last post I'm told CITIC had a high valuation of PUDA to explain a huge 500mil+
loan on half of a 300+ million dollar company.


Either the Chinese have a backwards view of value investing or something is still off with the explanations,
and the likely outcome.


Nothing to do but wait. They will not be saying anything new until they have everything done. Including future
plans and whatever changes they may make.


The big question I have is the PRC. What if anything, are they willing to do, in order to help PUDA put this
back together. That is tough to answer on a good day.


15 Apr 2011, 09:03 AM

as this might be judged to 64% what belong to the Zhao's. 
Also remaining 15% can be spend to part 14.5% interest.


All 36% might be happy with $530.3 million by pledges.


Maybe a fairytale but also Alfred's story doesn't seem real.

Wow. It's incredible the conversation here kept going on and on, despite the company and MZ has already admitted
their theft. If I was holding the stock, I'd be more concern about what I could possibly doing to minimize and recover
my losses when PUDA re-opens on pink sheets, as well as any legal recourse I'd have against the Zhao brothers.
Any other chattering is meaningless.


Rational investors who lost money here should also sit down and reflect on the hard lesson of ignoring the large
number of red flags (rto, auditor, unrealistically promotional statements from mgmt etc) when they decided to invest in
PUDA.

Please : favor of providing where specifically the company and MZ have admitted the Theft ? If u are not able
to provide facts to support definitive statements then STFU ! This tranaction is murky enough without
additional speculation...However CW, I'm sure u do look good in your cheerleaders skirt.

Perhaps you can learn to read the company's own press release and phone a couple of directors? No need to
be rude just because I pointed out your inability and total negligence of missing out details of ownership
transfer in the private msgs earlier. Would you like to me to post those? I stick to my original statement PUDA
investors own, at best, 51% of pledged shares in the operating assets and, at worst, a piece of paper to
nothing.


BTW, I'm sure you look fabulous in the Zhao cheerleading squad. I'm sure after they terminate you once their
need for capital raise in the US is over, you are able to find another job at RINO, CCME, CBEH, ONP, CGA,
DEER, DYP, DGW and many many other great companies, just like former colleagues of yours at penny-
stock-fraud-pumper inc like Michael Anderson, Glen Bradford etc.

Support your NONE comment.


29 Apr 2011, 04:59 PM


tbone
Johnny: since Mr Wu is refusing or unable to support his "NONE" answer to your question perhaps I can
provide u with some facts - quoting Article 149 of the Chinese Company Law :


Article 149 expressly prohibits directors and senior management from engaging in the following acts: 1)
Misappropriating company funds; (2) Depositing company funds into an individual account; (3) Loaning
company funds or providing a company guaranty without shareholder approval; (4) Signing a contract or
trading with another company in violation of the articles of association, unless the shareholders expressly
consent; (5) Without shareholder consent, seeking business opportunities for oneself or for any other person
by taking advantage of one's authority, or operating for oneself or for any other person any business similar to
that of the company for which one works, without shareholder consent; (6) Taking commissions on a company
transaction ; (7) Disclosing company secrets without permission; (8) Other acts inconsistent with the
obligation of fidelity to the company.


The New Company Law provides a clear set of procedures for shareholder action and specific authority to
appeal to the courts to resolve such matters. Article 152 provides that when a director or senior manager
violates the provisions of Article 149, noted above, the shareholder(s) holding one percent or more of the total
shares of the company may require the company to file suit in the people's court. If the company refuses to
file suit, the shareholder may file suit on behalf of the company. In addition, if the interests of the shareholders
are directly affected, then the shareholders may file suit on their own behalf. Article 153 further provides that if
any director or senior manager damages a shareholder's interest by violating any law, administrative
regulation, or the company's articles of association, the affected shareholders may file suit for compensation.


My Add : of course all is slow to change in PRC and it will be up to the Provincial courts to enforce this 2006
change.


But to comment "NONE" to a very important question ? Mr Wu is either a liar or simply ignorant of his
ignorance.

Chris Wu, Contributor
Yes, I'm always a liar to you jsut because I pointed out in a private message from you earlier that you failed to
understand the whole share transfer. Your imaginary recourse available is very nice, but you miss a key fact
that the person you're trying to go after is a PRC national residing outside the US. Article 149 lacks of the
necessary jurisdiction here because MZ did NOT break any Chinese law. Don't take my word for it. If you
have a problem with me saying the share transfers are completely legal, you should call up CITIC and
threaten to sue them, recovering your stolen shares. I'm waiting to hear back from you on what happens
there.


I stick to my earlier statement there is NO recourse available other than attempting to recover whatever it's
left on the US side, which is barely anything.


BTW, my suggestion to tbone - move to China and spend 5 years there to learn what real business is like
here. Try to be nicer next time, so people won't pick on you. Think about what can be thrown back to you
before you make a bold statement like "Wu is refusing to or unable to...". That's a good lesson.


04 May 2011, 04:03 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
BTW, the point is to figure out what kind of recourse is available to you BEFORE not AFTER making your
investment in a foreign company with offshore holding co structure, especially when you don't do enough due
diligence. That's the key lesson for most of the PUDA longs.

This may seem like a mindnumbingly stupid question. But I'm an unsophisticated investor, and am hoping you can
explain why my logic is faulty:


CITIC (and the other companies Mr. Zhao sold to) bought the proverbial "Brooklyn Bridge," i.e., they bought stock
from a person who did not legally own it or have the authorization to sell it. (And based on their own due diligence,
they should have known that.) It seems like you could even argue that Zhao essentially sold them counterfeit stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/262779-puda-coal-chairman-sells-half-the-company-pledges-the-other-half-to-chinese-pe-investors 23/32


So following that logic, why are these illegal stock sales even considered valid, and why can't they simply be legally
voided, leaving CITIC et al to work out with Mr. Zhao how he's going to pay them back their money?


The loan from CITIC to Shanxi Coal may be another matter, as Zhao may have been authorized to borrow money on
behalf of Shanxi (the article doesn't say). But I'd think it would be fairly easy to prove that CITIC was not an innocent
party in Zhao's shady dealings, which would therefore open the possibility of some litigation regarding that obviously
usurious loan.


What's wrong with my thinking? Does Chinese law work differently? It seems to me that the Chinese government is
not going to want to see foreign investors scared away by this scandal. If anything, in a country like China, I'd expect
there to be more government intervention, and for people like Zhao to have less legal protection than they do in the
U.S.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I don't know the Chinese law on these share transfer issues. But I would think CITIC had a power
legal team check out the legal structure and history of the shares of Shanxi Coal before they bought it. My experience
is that they will send a huge team in to perform legal DD and they would never buy those shares unless they had
absolutely no fear of American investor reprisal.

TAIYUAN, SHANXI PROVINCE, China, April 29, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-First... -- Puda Coal, Inc. (NYSE AMEX:
PUDA) ("Puda Coal" or the "Company) today announced that it received a preliminary non-binding proposal from its
Chairman, Mr. Ming Zhao to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company in a going
private transaction at up to $12 per share in cash. Mr. Zhao proposed to finance the proposed acquisition with a
combination of existing cash on hand and external financing sources. A copy of Mr. Zhao's proposal is attached to this
press release.


In response to the receipt of the proposal, the Company's Audit Committee composed solely of independent directors
will review and evaluate the proposal and, if appropriate, negotiate its terms, and take any other action in connection
therewith. The Audit Committee has requested detailed information and documentation from Mr. Zhao relating to the
proposal, including information pertaining to matters that are subject to the Audit Committee's previously reported on-
going investigation, necessary for the Audit Committee to evaluate the proposal and provide a recommendation to
shareholders.

This is very interesting. Several questions immediately come to mind:


1) Does the external funding exist?


2) Can the board approve a sale in the middle of an investigation? Oddly enough, acting as a fiduciary for the
stock holder, it would seem best to approve the takeover if there is evidence that fraud does exist, and vote
against it does not!


3) Can the SEC / etc block a tender of a halted stock?


4) must the stock re-open for trading for a tender to commence?


29 Apr 2011, 06:10 PM


TheCompleatAngler
I was interested to see that a reputable law firm--Shearman & Sterling--was willing to take Zhao as a client.
Shearman's partners would have had to okay the firm taking on Zhao as a client, which would be an issue with a firm
like Sherman that has a reputation at stake. Coal is certainly a commodity in demand and nowhere more than in
China. Perhaps in spite of whatever may have transpired at Puda, there are some assets of value. Maybe this is
Zhao's way of sweeping whatever may have happened at Puda into the past--of making things right. How bizarre.

Fear mongering shorts trying to scare investors out of their money by publishing lies, groundless accusations, sinister
questions, all with the goal to create confusion and fear. Poor investors have no choice but to give up in the midst of
coordinated attacks on companies they have never visited, whose products they have never seen and a culture
strange and chaotic to them. Shorts pick up the gains, move on to the next target, leaving the poor investors with
permanent loss, what can the poor investors do? They can't sue the shorts, it's just opinion and the disclaimers are all
over the place and even if they win, the shorts probably don't have the money, not worth trying. The shorts are just as
despicable as the fraudulent companies, very little can be done to them. 
But far fewer RTOs are fraudulent as the shorts want you to believe, following the rules don't make your company
competitive in China, as anyone experience the traffics in China would agree. So there are undeniably some issues
with formalities, very much so with US accounting standards and rules, but that shouldn't affect the business.  
The question most of us need to ask is whether you own the stock or the business, if it's the later, then most of the
RTOs are undervalued, of course shorts would have you believe otherwise, that's their game. But do you know more
about the company you are investing than the shorts? If you do, you have little to worry about and should thank the
shorts for bring the stock price down so you could add more cheaper. If you don't have the confidence that you know
more about the company than the market, then you shouldn't have invested in those companies in the first place.  
To me, this is the only game in town now, great returns are often made when nobody wants the stock and everyone
agrees its a sell. Given, of course, you know what you are doing.

For whatever it is worth, here is my comment as an outsider: 
It is illegal to lend money at 14.5% even including fees (many fees that are normal in the west are also not allowed by
the banking law) in China. CITIC is a major institution that will not do blatantly illegal things. Therefore, whoever is
saying CITIC lent Rmb3.5 billion at 14.5% is just BS. Also, Rmb3.5B is a big sum anywhere and it would need
approval at the highest level within CITIC and the release of the funds would be controlled, not just a big check for the
guy to do whatever he wanted to. The story is strange and not that credible. Just MHO.


Disclosure: I have no position in PUDA.

04 May 2011, 04:09 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
Well, the reason I don't respond to comments/questions here reguarly is because I hardly follow the PUDA
situation anymore. To answer canb999's quesiton, which I just saw 30 seconds ago, 14.5% interest rate is
definitely NOT illegal in China. Yes, CITIC is a major, sophistication financial player, they reason for them to
give out the 3.5B loan is they got Shanxi PUDA assets at a very cheap valuation + the 51% equity (used to be
your equity) pledged as collateral. They're pretty safe. The point is, CITIC has nothing to lose here IMO.


Now for tbone, the lesson for people like you should learn here is to do proper due diligence before making
an investment in an offshore company with holding co structure, so average retail joes like you won't have to
hide behind a new SA id to post meaningless comments/trash other people with a different opinion, while the
only real thing you can do is to wait for the independent members of the board to take some CYA type of
actions, hopefully minimizing your losses.


Call me whatever you'd like, you're nothing but a jerk who lacks of the ability to even finish reading Alfred's
article before sending a private message to question me. I want to on the record appraise Alfred for doing all
the excellent research and articles, because I believe there's making money through doing more rigorous
research/DD. I followed his recommendation after his article on RINO.PK and made money most of the time. I
also think his detective work is doing the investing public a great service which has yet to be recognized.

action leagues to recover whatever its left in the US co, or waiting for your "very responsible" board of
directors to take some CYA type of action for you. I'm happy to hear from you AFTER you succeed. Any more

"Apparently, CITIC agrees with me, since the $37.12 million price CITIC paid for their 49% of Shanxi Coal divided by
19.82 million PUDA shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter (when the acquisition occurred) equals only a
$1.91 per share valuation."


I think there is a mistake, $37.12 million paid for 49% of 19.82 million, will roughly value the company at $3.7 per
share?


10 May 2011, 10:01 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  CITIC bought approx half for $37 million that went into Zhao's pocket. PUDA shareholders
are left owning the other half, $37 million, divided by 19.82 million shares o/s.


10 May 2011, 08:33 PM


oliver_sd
How about this for a more plausible theory on the value of Shanxi and why CITIC would loan so much? Shanxi's
assets / book value was $600+ million. CITIC was willing loan $500 million (80% LTV) against those assets and (as
part of the package) buy half of the company for an additional $37 million (presumably to cement PUDA's consolidator
role). So the value of PUDA's half is 50% of $600 million in book value = 300/20= $15 per share.


When you continue to pretend that a 'secured' loan for such a large amount could be made without significantly more
equity than $72 million, you are just talking your book and not making an honest evaluation. Given the institutional
nature of CITIC, this valuation is much more plausible than yours.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  How do you arrive at $600 million assets?


12 May 2011, 02:33 AM


oliver_sd
A better question is How do YOU arrive at a $500 million secured loan WITHOUT at least $600 million in assets (or
having the shares be worth that as you say the other half of the company was the collateral).


The same can be posed for the supposedly unaffordable 14.5% interest. No sane lender (CITIC is certainly sane),
would loan $500 million unless the borrower is producing a bare MINIMUM of 1.25x that in NET INCOME ($72 million

per year) after existing obligations. The income CITIC would have required would be closer to $100 million if we
believe your $73 million interest figure.


Your story just doesn't make sense given that NO business of this magnitude is ever done without the adequate
collateral or ability to pay.


12 May 2011, 11:32 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Oliver, of course the loan is secured by the assets it purchased or improved. Assets - Loan
liabilities = zero. They net out or perhaps the bank left a 20-30% cushion. However, the 14.5% high interest
must compensate the lender for high risk. I suspect the cushion is therefore small. This is a risky development
loan for financing the coal production expansion that takes time to generate cashflow. CITIC probably expects
operating income cannot service the interest expense in the first year. Typically these are interest only with a
balloon at the end that you never pay off. It will roll over or refinance with a lot of fees and reduced interest in
year 4 if all goes as planned. Execution risk in this highly leveraged scheme explains the low valuation.


13 May 2011, 08:06 AM


oliver_sd
Pre CITIC involvement: NET assets were at LEAST $600 + $37 million (that's not even 80% LTV). Post loan,
the assets are $600 million in assets + $500 million in cash - $500 million in loan + $37 million in cash.
Obviously a loan doesn't change the Shanxi net asset value which is still $637+ million after the loan.


Your whole theory of $1.91 per share in value reduces to the silly proposition that somehow they managed to
get $500+ million in loans (spend it all in 9 months!) and have nothing left of value at the end of that time.
Which is absolutely ridiculous.


Instead what we do know was spent was a mere $40 million on mines that are making $10 million per year.
Or maybe you think CITIC let Zhao simply spirit the money to an off-shore account somewhere with no
oversight. Or your assertion (without a shred of evidence) that this enormous amount of money was spent
upgrading the mines without any capital equipment left or increased productivity / income.


I do however, like that you are now conceding that the assets must have equaled the loans. And since the
loans doen't change net asset value or net equity, you are essentially agreeing that the value of Shanxi in July
was at least $637 million.

Author’s reply »  Oliver, how do you get $600+$37 million net assets before CITIC's involvement? Can you
show me your calculation?

Was speaking to a colleague. How do you get maximum upside in a stock while taking very little risk.


His answer was your short a stock and immediately release a hit piece. Cover your short and immediately go long the
stock, betting that the suckers that read your hit will be shorting the stock.


When the suckers have to cover on the upside you maximized your long profit.


The only factor he forgot was the risk of jail time....

Albert - How can you continually spread lies and manipulation? You are now claiming to be an expert on development
loans structured by Citic?


How come you stopped responding to me? Also how come you reference Geoinvesting in over half of your hitpieces?

Author’s reply »  Actually I am very knowledgeable about CITIC development loans. My team talked to them directly
and obtained copies of the loan terms and other documentation that I might share some day. These trust products are
quite popular to investors in China due to the high interest rates. CITIC brags in the product brochure and in our
interviews that they have complete control of Shanxi Coal so the Chinese trust investors have good security in case
the earnings miss the targets. You or anyone else who speaks mandarin could approach CITIC and get the same
response if you bother to try. Or just keep your faith in your U.S. regulators. They've done such a great job for you.

Frankly you are delusional, but tell a decent lie as you have fouled many so far. Thankfully these lies will all come
crashing down on your manipulation and front running scheme. Good luck you in your lawsuits unless you plan on
hiding behind your alias forever.

alfred, have you released your list of chinese small cap long ideas yet?


13 May 2011, 04:37 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I don't have any more long ideas. I briefly owned HRBN and ADY and flipped for 20%. I am
still long CFSG also up about 20%, all 3 picks from my "Three Short-Proof Chinese Stocks" article. I think
many more chinese small caps have to "go dark" before the bear market is over. At least half the RTOs are
frauds. By far the ugliest sector in the history of the U.S. exchanges.

Where's the financing for the deal? Where's the binding offer? Where's your imaginary PRC court order to get
MZ to return your stolen money? Have you phoned CITIC yet?

Johnny - Alfred doesn't really exist. Geoinvesting isn't focused on long positions, they only write hit pieces and front
run manipulative information.

Al (whitetiger) - you are aware that you will have to open up your trading records to the courts right?


Ultimately we are fully aware you never went long any report. You put out the positive report purely to make it look like
you are not biased and not just a "hit piece" front running crook.


It was a bad smoke screen that was ineffective. I am pretty sure you are leaving many of your followers as the bag
holders as you front run them and profit at their expense and then move onto the next manipulative action that you
can create.

AIYUAN, China, July 12, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-First... -- By letter dated July 7, 2011, the independent registered
public accounting firm of Puda Coal, Inc. (NYSE Amex: PUDA) (the "Company"), Moore Stephens, resigned,
effectively immediately. Moore Stephens served as the Company's auditor since July 19, 2005. Moore Stephens also
advised the Company that further reliance should no longer be placed on its previously issued audit reports relating to
the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The resignation and non-reliance advice by
Moore Stephens are based on its conclusion that it is no longer able to rely on the representations of the Company's
management received in connection with its audits of the Company's financial statements for the last two fiscal years.
Moore Stephens believes such management representations are materially inconsistent with the alleged unauthorized
transfers of subsidiary ownership by the Company's Chairman, Mr. Ming Zhao, which are currently subject to the
investigation by the Audit Committee. The Company's Audit Committee will continue its investigation into the alleged
unauthorized transactions.


So MS in Hong Kong finally figured out it takes them forever to restate PUDA's past financials to reflect the reality of
empty shell company behind PUDA stock?
