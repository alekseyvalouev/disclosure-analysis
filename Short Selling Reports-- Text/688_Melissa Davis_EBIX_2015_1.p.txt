Ebix Inc: Taking A Premature Bow For An Overhyped Business Deal
May 5, 2015 9:30 AM ET48 comments
by: Melissa Davis


Summary


Ebix owes up to $160 million of its lofty market value to an overhyped business deal
that’s almost bound to disappoint bullish investors once they discover the truth.


That shaky deal calls for Ebix to provide the London insurance market with an
electronic trading platform that’s unwanted by many of those who must agree to
cover the bill.


Even if the market decides to give Ebix a chance, the company will likely wait years
before it generates enough e-trading business to start bragging about any outsized
paychecks.


With its current e-trading platform severely outdated, Ebix might need to build a
modern system from scratch after losing the visionary experts who seem best-
equipped to attempt that formidable task.


Ebix better finish that demanding project in a hurry, too, since its rivals have refused
to politely concede defeat and rushed to further expand their own e-trading
businesses instead.


Ebix (NASDAQ: EBIX) can probably forget about making a quick buck - let alone actually
striking it rich - on a celebrated business deal that's widely regarded by investors as an
absolute gold mine.


Despite all of the hype surrounding its successful bid to provide the London insurance
market with a fancy electronic trading platform, Ebix still needs to wait and see if the
funding for that project actually materializes before it can safely bank on even a modest
paycheck for its services. More than two full months after its stock exploded on news of its
winning bid - adding $160 million to its market value in a matter of days - Ebix remains in a
state of limbo, so to speak, at the mercy of London brokers and underwriters who might
feel understandably reluctant to finance an electronic placing system that many of them
don't even want.

Just ask Roger Foord, a well-connected industry consultant who has spent decades
focused on the London insurance market and enjoys ready access to many of the highest-
ranking executives in the field.


"There's no way Ebix is suddenly going to make millions of pounds on this," Foord bluntly
declared a few weeks ago. "It's worth absolutely zilch right now.


"I was at Lloyd's today, and nobody's even thinking about electronic trading," he
emphasized. "Nobody wants it. (SO) it's not going to happen."


No wonder Ebix refuses to share any concrete details about that shaky deal.


While Ebix has blamed its silence on a strict confidentiality agreement that it apparently
intends to honor forever, since the CEO basically said that any clues about the projected
value of that project (or even the likely start date for the job) would need to come from the
opposite party, the company must feel pretty clueless itself. Ebix would probably love to
brag about the bundle that it stands to make on that deal if the company knew that it
safely could.


"Until the money is in place, it's a rather hollow victory," noted one of several well-informed
industry sources who volunteered information for this revealing investigative report. "It's
hard to get people to put money into anything. And that's actually quite a hard sell … It's
by no means a done deal."


Shame on Ebix for keeping its mouth shut while hopeful shareholders anxiously wait in
vain for imminent news of a gigantic contract.


When Ebix proudly confirmed that it had won the bid to supply the e-trading platform
requested by Private Placement Limited (PPL) - a special-purpose entity formed by
London market reformers to pursue a single e-placing solution for all - the company
probably should have mentioned that PPL lacks the financial resources to cover that big-
ticket project on its own. Rather, PPL merely hopes that market players will come together
and provide enough support for the "collective purchase" of a modern e-trading platform
instead. It still needs the industry leaders who back its cause to persuade a whole bunch
of individual brokers and underwriters to actually foot the bill.


Since most of those firms have refused to even use e-placing systems financed by others
in the past, including a notoriously expensive failure pursued by none other than mighty
Lloyd's of London itself, PPL better make sure that its industry representatives come up
with an irresistible sales pitch. If PPL wants London brokers and underwriters to cough up
millions of pounds just to build that platform - never mind the "$10 million-plus" that Wall

Street fantasizes Ebix collecting for its future services every year - it might as well go
ahead and prepare itself for a somewhat frosty reception. Just think of the likely sticker
shock.


Generously assuming that Ebix ultimately receives enough money to move forward and
makes enough progress to stick with a schedule that PPL openly regards as tight,
however, the company still wouldn't see its e-trading platform achieve full-scale operations
until the second half of next year. So even under a best-case scenario, Ebix could find
itself waiting quite some time for a decent paycheck.


"This is going to be a long, long process," predicted an industry source who has kept a
close eye on the situation. "The revenue stream to Ebix will be very small and slow to
speed up … The only way this would make the company's earnings go up this year is if
the London market gave them $5 million right now, and I just can't see that happening."


Ebix did not respond to questions for this story.


Waiting on the Sidelines while Rivals Continue to Make Gains


To be sure, the rival firm that competed against Ebix for that big project hardly seems
willing to abandon its own e-placing business and helplessly surrender in defeat.


A well-established competitor with a number of other electronic-based services already on
the market at this point, Xchanging has continued to lure new customers to its own e-
placing system while Ebix itself remains stuck on the sidelines waiting for some distant
chance to steal the show. No sooner had Ebix declared victory by officially confirming that
PPL had favored its proposal, in fact, than Xchanging proceeded to announce some fairly
impressive news of its own. Barely one month after Ebix trumpeted that big win,
Xchanging issued a press release proclaiming that the initial adoption rate for its global
reinsurance placing system had "exceeded all expectations" by swiftly attracting
customers in more than 70 markets around the globe.


"Xchanging has invested significant time and effort to ensure that globalREmarket
becomes the tool of choice for reinsurance deal distribution," the company declared, "and
believes its simplicity of use has been instrumental in securing immediate buy-in from the
broker and carrier communities."


The first brokerage firm to give globalREmarket a chance, TigerRisk has by now already
decided to conduct all of its placing business exclusively on that electronic platform. After
throwing its full support behind the system, TigerRisk confidently predicted a "significant

increase in reinsurance markets coming online" as the firm drives more and more traffic to
the platform by relying exclusively on the system to help process all of its future deals.


The Insurance Workplace (TIW), a firm that partnered with Xchanging to compete for the
PPL deal that Ebix recently won, seems determined to keep on growing its e-placing
business as well. Hoping to take advantage of a welcome head-start, TIW plans to keep
on courting new customers - and aims to hook them on its own e-placing services - before
Ebix gets a chance to launch its proposed e-trading platform.


"We have our own placing solution in use by a number of brokers, which we believe is
superior in many ways to their offering," TIW Chief Executive Officer David Edwards
recently proclaimed. "We are not going anywhere, and will continue to develop our
portfolio of electronic trading solutions for our clients in London and around the world."


"I do understand that the Ebix solution is now a complete rewrite," Edwards noted, "which
will hopefully give us the opportunity to continue to grow our market share."


For its part, Xchanging acts almost as if Ebix never even secured the PPL deal at all.
When Xchanging issued its most recent quarterly update in mid-April, for example, the
company not only reiterated its commitment to modernizing the London insurance market
but also highlighted its ongoing investment in the projects that it has pursued, along with
its technology partners, to help further that cause.


To its credit, a past interview with the company shows, Xchanging spent a lot of time
studying all of the e-placing services that the London insurance market had invariably
rejected over the years before the company even tried to design a new e-trading platform
that might stand a legitimate chance. By the time that Xchanging finished its homework,
the company felt thoroughly convinced that the market would refuse to adopt any e-
placing service that required brokers and/or underwriters to dramatically change their
ways. So Xchanging deliberately refrained from pursuing an expansive system like the
one that Lloyds had introduced to the market - a bold experiment that evolved into a
notorious $120 million failure - and settled on a much simpler e-placing solution instead.


"Cultural change needs to happen in gradual steps, and the technology must be designed
in a way that does not require too much cultural change to occur too quickly," the
managing director of Xchanging explained in a candid interview with an industry journal
early last year. "I believe it will take about five years for the technology to reach a
reasonable scale and adoption rate - and then five to 10 years for reasonable change to
begin to take shape within the industry."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3139896-ebix-inc-taking-a-premature-bow-for-an-overhyped-business-deal 5/18


So much for Ebix making a fortune on its overhyped PPL deal any time soon. The
company might need to wait an entire decade - an eternity by Wall Street standards - for
its proposed e-trading platform to achieve widespread acceptance, if that elaborate
system ever wins over the rigid London insurance market at all.


In a wildly lucrative industry where operating expenses often hover in the low single digits
and profits can reach into the billions, one market insider explained, companies see little
reason to waste time and money on complicated technology that - even with plenty of
effort - might lower their costs by a measly 1% at the absolute best.


"There's no urgency," Foord agreed. "There are 5,000 people at Lloyd's who are happy
with the way that they're doing things. If you found one who wants this (new e-trading
platform), I would be really impressed."


Mistaking a Discarded Antique for Modern Technology


Maybe Ebix really did start out by pitching its current e-placing system for free, as Foord
and his industry contacts highly suspect, only to find its offer soundly rejected due to the
"inept" performance of its antiquated technology.


To be sure, Ebix seemed to scale back its expectations for the acquisition target that
supplied the company with its e-trading platform in a pretty big hurry. When Ebix inherited
that outdated relic by purchasing Qatarlyst a couple of years ago, it practically came right
out and said that it had acquired the firm to gain handy access to the London insurance
market and compete for the looming PPL deal. While Ebix promised to reward Qatarlyst
with generous "earn-out" payments if it achieved future revenue targets extending through
the end of 2016, however, the company had already reversed a big chunk of the reserves
that it initially established to cover those potential bonuses - conveniently boosting the
profits that it reported to Wall Street in the process - by the time that it officially won the
PPL bid.


By then, Ebix must have realized that it had inherited an e-trading platform so far behind
the times that it would probably need to build a new one from scratch. Even the visionary
pioneer who presided for years over the firm that originally launched that e-placing system
now considers the platform virtually beyond repair.


"What you are looking at here is a platform that was built on an architecture designed in
2001 with an application manager at its core that is now out of step with the modern
technology frameworks," said Alex Letts, who served as the CEO of RI3K until Qatarlyst
purchased the company. "The market needs to give Ebix a mandate to build a platform for

the future that will suit everybody in five years time … The mistake will be to persist with
just the old technology and create an increasing tangle of legacy spaghetti that will have
escalating costs and decreasing business benefit in direct proportion.


"That is the path to perdition."


Losing Critical Talent in a Lengthy Parade Out the Door


Too bad Ebix lost the very experts who seem best equipped to pull off such a challenging
project. Ebix sure could use the expertise of those RI3K/Qatarlyst veterans - including the
trio of accomplished leaders who bailed at first chance - right now.


Take Robin Merttens, the founding chief operating officer of RI3K and former market place
director of Qatarlyst, just for starters. After co-founding RI3K with Letts and designing its
original e-trading platform at the dawn of the century, Merttens oversaw the evolving
technology and the services that it delivered to a growing population of customers in the
decade that followed. In the end, he would manage to win over even a pair of industry
giants - negotiating deals with both Aon and Marsh - although the latter (a gigantic
brokerage firm) swiftly cancelled its service a few months after Ebix purchased Qatarlyst
and took control of its e-trading platform.


"The UK arm of the broking heavyweight completed a trial of the platform last year in what
appeared to be a major breakthrough for Qatarlyst," The Insurance Insider noted at the
time. But "Marsh has stopped using the Qatarlyst electronic placing platform while a
London market body undertakes due diligence on the platform and its new owner Ebix, the
scandal-struck US technology firm" - then a fresh target of government authorities and still
a lightning rod for suspicion to this very day.


Once Ebix entered the picture, Merttens soon bolted as well. Loyal for more than a
decade until then, Merttens had stuck around after RI3K sold itself to Qatarlyst and his
fellow co-founder retired to leave him in charge of running the show. When Ebix
purchased the company a few years later, however, Merttens must have felt desperate to
start packing his bags. Within a couple of months, he split to work for himself as an
industry consultant and left behind the e-trading platform that he had nurtured throughout
most of his professional career.


Two other noteworthy veterans soon followed him out the door. Arriving at RI3K right after
it opened its doors back in the year 2000, Kelly Fegan initially handled the legal and
compliance department for the young firm before ascending to become managing director
of the entire company. Together with Merttens, he landed the prominent Aon account and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3139896-ebix-inc-taking-a-premature-bow-for-an-overhyped-business-deal 7/18


signed on hundreds of smaller underwriting firms in dozens of countries all over the world.
Another dedicated servant who remained at the firm after its sale to Qatarlyst in 2010,
Fegan served as the director of client services - handling everything from business
development to sales and contract negotiation to training and user support - during the
final three years of his lengthy tenure at the company.


With Ebix in charge and Merttens gone in a hurry, however, Fegan decided to hit the door
months before he even landed a new job. In a matter of weeks, former RI3K Chief
Information Officer and Qatarlyst Chief Product Officer Ian Meadows rushed to join the
parade.


Shooting for the Stars while Running on Fumes


All told, official regulatory filings show, Qatarlyst shed almost three-quarters of its entire
workforce the year that Ebix purchased the company. Qatarlyst lost its Big Four auditors
that year, too, with KPMG resigning and Ebix somehow locating an obscure firm stuck in a
row of dreary retail shops to verify the company's financial statements instead.


Those numbers look pretty pathetic. Despite an 80% jump in revenue during 2013,
Qatarlyst still mustered less than 3 million pounds in total sales - while burning more than
16 million pounds in cash on its business operations - and ended yet another year in the
red. While Qatarlyst lost far less money than usual, the company also cut its workforce to
the bone and slashed it budget for everything from advertising to auditing fees.


With Ebix so busy cutting corners, the company must have lost track of all the Qatarlyst
employees who no longer appear on its payroll. Go to the Qatarlyst website and look at
the contact page. Of the three managers listed, only one of them actually still works at the
company. The other two (the first previously in charge of client services, the second of
training and support) vacated their positions - with the big PPL project officially still out for
bid - before the end of last year.


If Ebix can't even update its own website, how on earth does the company expect to
provide the busy London insurance market with a sophisticated e-trading platform
impressive enough to succeed where others have inevitably failed? Never mind that Ebix
inexplicably rushed to gut Qatarlyst - leaving the firm with a skeleton crew stripped of its
most valuable talent - before it ever volunteered to tackle that ambitious project. With so
much at stake, Ebix might want to pray for a miracle while the London insurance market
decides whether it should trust the company with a generous handout or not.

"The market will now, one assumes, invest either in a complete rebuild - the best option -
or the longer-term, more expensive option of working with an aging and unscalable legacy
system," Letts speculated. "Unless they fix the technology problem and give Ebix the
money and mandate to do it properly, I can tell you with absolute certainty that this will
never proliferate and become a success. It will simply become another failed market
initiative …"


"They are dealing with an out-of-date technology serving an industry that does not plan
well for the future, with decisions being made based on self-serving advice to people who
lack the specific knowledge to make the right and well-informed decisions. It is like buying
a Sinclair Spectrum computer and trying to use it to run a NASA Mars mission," Letts
concluded. "It will end in tears."

So people, in a previous article this author acknowledge getting paid by shorts, using a front to post it. In this new

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3139896-ebix-inc-taking-a-premature-bow-for-an-overhyped-business-deal 10/18


Melissa has contrived a classic strawman argument here by falsely presuming that the entire recent appreciation of
EBIX stock is attributable to the PPL announcement, and then attempting to undermine only the gravity of the PPL
news while ignoring other more relevant factors. The reality is that EBIX's recent price appreciation is an
amalgamation of many important factors including an unexpectedly positive settlement with the IRS (which completely
undermines the shorts biggest claims against EBIX), strong quarterly earnings, the continuing unwinding of an
unsustainable short interest (which had been artificially dampening the stock price), and several other small
acquisitions and business initiatives being pursued by the company in healthcare and other sectors. In sum, Ebix
appears to be firing on all cylinders here. It's no surprise that Melissa focuses on the weakest and most uncertain link
to try to (poorly) prove the point that she was paid to support.


Anyone who has followed the company closely knows that with EBIX's diverse revenue base, no single client or
project represents more than 2.5% of revenue (and most are much smaller). As a result, EBIX is clearly in it for the
long haul and is happy to spend the years that Melissa projects it will take to get the PPL project into a more robust
revenue environment. RR has always been outspoken that his strategy is to focus on longterm recurring revenue
rather than short-term, one-time, upfront fees like other competitors do. If anything, Melissa's commentary only serves
to further confirm that EBIX is executing on its long-term strategy and is not sacrificing its business model to appease
quarterly Wall Street expectations.

The premise of this "article" is also ridiculous. She spins it so that winning a contract award is "bad" for Ebix and
somehow "good" for its competitors that didn't win the contract. That's like saying it will be better for Boeing or

and personally I am up 200% plus on this stock (including currency Cdn to US dollars) like earlier noted by another
commenter I have not sold one of my shares along the way as I am certain this stock has a long way to go. I hope you
get paid well and upfront as when the short squeeze actually happens the people paying you won't have much left.
Unless you take IOU's.

Stock up on a down day. What a wasted effort by Davis. 
Reality is that stock rise since around 3Q14 is based mostly on improving fundamentals. The EBIX London win
reaffirms the credibility of EBIX's overall position in the industry but the eventual results are just icing on the ever
bigger cake.

If you look at the website link for the technology expert she cites I think you can draw your own conclusions about the

How this article is insulting to the SeekingAlpha community, let me count the ways... starting with the grossly
misleading title. Anyone who knows the slightest bit about this Company would know how off the mark she is.

5/21/2018 Ebix Inc: Taking A Premature Bow For An Overhyped Business Deal - Ebix Inc (NASDAQ:EBIX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3139896-ebix-inc-taking-a-premature-bow-for-an-overhyped-business-deal 12/18


EBIX has NOT taken a bow or celebrated this deal or made any announcements about the London deal - and has
said little in response to investor questions. This is likely because from a material standpoint, there probably has not
yet been any material event that required disclosure. It also makes a lot of sense that the London Insurance group
would hire Accenture to run the bid process for a platform they neither need nor one their membership would ever
use...


EBIX share price rise the past few months was a function of clear corporate progress, the resolution of an IRS review,
continued strong cash flows, securing a large multi-bank credit facility and getting it expanded, and other progress
that continued to disprove a withering short thesis entering its 5th year... I mean at some point don't the shorts have to
deliver some damning evidence that supports their views?


As for her characterization of A "celebrated business deal" I guess Miss Davis is a cheap date (pizza & Olde English
800...?) as far as celebrations go - as there has been little fanfare or coverage by anyone - the Company included, so
the best she could find and link to being a blog post on Motley Fool: http://bit.ly/1H1yytu from Feb 17th.


I guess the very simple lesson is that if you do you research and know what you own - you can inoculate yourself from
the rumors of the day and the websites that provide sustenance to them.


I've owned EBIX Shares since April 2003, represented the Company in its IR efforts for two years from 2004 - 2006,
and have the benefit of that experience and perspective to guide me with each crazy tale that shows up - often on this
website.


But there is solace - the last time the stock price hit $29.00 - the market cap was around $1.3B - this time it was only
$1B, a nice increase in my % ownership in the larger entity that resulted from diligent application of cash flows to
reducing the equity base for long term holders. So while it's been frustrating, the shorts have facilitated value creation
for the Company, as well as some attractive entry points for further investment. And along the way, the investment
community has gotten every wiser - sagacity reflected on the dimwitted impact that the mud slinging has had on the
share price.

This article was really humorous. I really liked this part: 
"We have our own placing solution in use by a number of brokers, which we believe is superior in many ways to their
offering," TIW Chief Executive Officer David Edwards recently proclaimed. "We are not going anywhere, and will
continue to develop our portfolio of electronic trading solutions for our clients in London and around the world."


"I do understand that the Ebix solution is now a complete rewrite," Edwards noted, "which will hopefully give us the
opportunity to continue to grow our market share." "


Well, what do you expect Mr. Edwards to say, "We lost, we suck, and we're giving up"?

EBIX's short interest has been falling since last July when it hit a peak at approximately 16mm shares and is now at a
low. Since the IRS settlement in Jan, short interest has fallen by about 30%. Today, more call options are being
bought as compared to puts and the volume is normal. Revenues are still increasing, free cash flow is very healthy,
and operating margins are great at around 37-40%. As far as I can tell, this article is about something that is not even
factored into earnings yet nor is it based on anything except heresay. Whatever...


EBIX's historical short interest from NASDAQ's site:

another story written by the shorts - the co reports tomorrow. then we will see how this author has miss led and lied.
I'm specifically interested to see the revenue per share growth because of all the shares that were repurchased. Also
how many shares are still in the float. This could be below 30M. Last report I saw the number or shorts is likely close
to 50%. Many mutual funds have accumulated a lot of shares, so if they want they can put the squeees on these
shorts. When there are no shares left to repurchase the price can go over 100 /share. I believe this is what the CEO
would like to happen but I think its a still far away.

I'm trying to understand though why despite all of this Xchanging (Listed on the LSE) is barely profitable (in fact lost
more money than it made over the past 5 years aggregated), whereas Ebix is handsomely profitable.


Also if the PPL deal is worthless, why did Ebix competitors (whom you do seem to admire) place competing offers for
it?

Whats interesting is this author along with Street Sweeper never respond to any posts. This proves they just want to
drop a bomd of a useless article because they have nothing to defend it with.


So we have figured you and your short friends out you are all full of nothing but phoney facts and made up statements
that you twist to fit in your warped article.


How SeekingAlpha can let you and Street Sweeper post this junk is terrible and it proves all they care about is the
clicks to sell ads, Well to any SA advertisers I will never click on one of your links until SA gets these phoney article
writers to respond and answer our comments instead of hiding.

From the CC: "While we cannot reveal the size of the contract at present let me just say that the five year contract is
likely to have substantial guaranteed annual revenues associated with it from inception as the intent is to aggregate
the London market on this exchange".


"We are also presently in the midst of a number of deals in the area of e-governance and e-health that are even larger
in size than the PPL deal that I just talked about."


"To give you an example of the scale of these opportunities, one contract in the government sector can be worth $25
million in one year for Ebix."


08 May 2015, 04:48 PM

Melissa, do you no longer work at street sweeper?


If they did let you go is this a new short client you are writing fir or did you take the sweepers client with you after they
threw your a.. Out the door?

The vitriol aimed at the author here is quite a show. If what the author says isn't true, and only works to increase the
short interest, thus creating an explosion for demand when EBIX proves the author is wrong, shouldn't we thanking,
rather than attacking, the author?  
I have no dog in this hunt, but if I was long EBIX and I thought this write-up was all fabricating junk, I'd be salivating
that such falsehoods would, at best, create an opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap, or bring in weak shorts that
have no case for being bearish. The overcompensating vitriol makes me wonder if longs here know they are skating
on thin ice and lack real confidence.


09 May 2015, 11:11 AM

Yes it is, as you are new here you do not understand what the shorts did to ebix. They threw every
conceivable fake statement and mad eup story they could.

Good response. I agree with "crazylikebudfox's" response to the perceived vitriol because as a matter of
principal I never assume that I am right and believe that everyone is entitled to their opinion. In this case
however, the "author" has a history of inflammatory statements with questionable (at best) factual
underpinnings. The vitriol observed here is a reaction to what is perceived as an effort to manipulate a stock
versus providing an honest opinion supported by facts.


I intend to provide a detailed highlighting of the misstatements in each of the author's notes, but candidly have
had more important things to attend to. And yes, I should thank Melissa Davis and the short community for
getting it so wrong on Ebix. My gains have been magnified by the opportunities that they have created with
each of their attacks.

Better write another article, Ms Davis. Your employer continues to have a bigger loss. I suggest that you get your
money up front though, otherwise you may not get paid. It looks very bad for all those short shares. Wait for those
bigger contracts get signed that Mr Raina alluded to on the conference call and watch the share price.

I think she's hiding under a rock or busy selling her house as the stock has rallied by 25% in the first 6 trading

They say in shorting timing is even more important than being right. Well for sure her timing is a complete
fiasco. As for being right, I'm afraid not much better there... Time for career change?
