Questions For AmTrust's Q3 Earnings Call
Nov. 3, 2014 2:50 PM ET13 comments
by: Gotham Investing


Summary


AFSI's accounting appears questionable in a number of areas.


Only sell-side analysts can ask the company questions on the earnings call.


Pressing questions about the reliability of AFSI's accounting need answering.


Preface


AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) reports earnings on Tuesday morning,
but the Company only takes questions from sell-side analysts on its earnings calls. As
such, I have created a list of questions I suggest analysts ask (or that the Company
answers proactively).


I believe investors deserve to hear the Company address these questions publicly rather
than through sell-side analyst reports, because reported results of "operating earnings"
are meaningless when the veracity of a company's accounting is in question.


Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives ("LRCs")


1) Will the Company provide reconciliations of its premiums earned and loss & loss
adjustment expenses incurred showing the amount of gross, ceded to other AFSI
subsidiaries, ceded to third-parties, and net for each of its insurance subsidiaries?


Note: To-date, AFSI has only described the transactions and stated that it has
"appropriately" consolidated its wholly-owned Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives.


I believe this matter can only be put to rest by the Company providing reconciliations for
2008-2013 (2008 being the last year prior to its first acquisition of a Luxembourg
Reinsurance Captive). This should be a simple exercise for the Company, and the
disclosures would provide great clarity for investors regarding an issue that is relatively
unique to AFSI without impairing AFSI's competitive position.


2) Why did the Schedule Y, Part 2, column 9 show income of $18.5 million for AmTrust Re
Theta (f.k.a. SoCare Re; changed name in December 2012), when Mr. Zyskind specifically
said this entity had $58 million in net losses resulting from stop-loss agreements with

AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ("AII") on the Q4'13 earnings call?


Maiden Discrepancies


3) As of December 31, 2013, what amount of loss reserves and unearned premiums
ceded to Maiden Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:MHLD) did not require collateralization?


4) Why do the financial statements for AFSI and MHLD imply different amounts for loss
and loss adjustment expenses paid by MHLD to AFSI?


Note: Through 2013, AFSI reported having ceded $2,472.3 million of loss and loss
adjustment expenses to MHLD, and claimed reinsurance recoverables of $1,144.2 million,
implying a cumulative paid amount of $1,328.1 million.


In contrast, MHLD reported having assumed $2,287.6 million of loss and loss adjustment
expenses from AFSI ($184.7 million less than AFSI claims to have ceded MHLD), and
reported loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $796.0 million ($348.2 million less
than AFSI claims in reinsurance recoverables. Adjusting for the $108 million classification
difference noted in AFSI's "Response to Barron's" (leaving a still substantial $240.2 million
difference in reinsurance recoverables/loss and loss adjustment expense reserves),
MHLD's financial statements imply a cumulative paid amount of $1,383.6 million - $55.5
million higher than AFSI's report of paid.


Loss Ratio & Reserves


5) How does one reconcile the 83.5% net loss ratio for accident year 2013 reported in the
TIC & Affiliates Annual Combined Statement and the $30.9 million of net adverse
development (10-K, page 18) with the 67.0% net loss ratio reported in AFSI's 10-K?


Note: Small Commercial (100% U.S.) had a loss ratio of 65.8%; Specialty Program (100%
U.S.) had a loss ratio of 68.2%; Personal Lines Re (100% U.S.) had a loss ratio of 68.2%;
Specialty Risk & Extended Warranty had a loss ratio of 67.2% (<50% U.S.).


Conditions of New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") Approval of
ACP Re's Acquisition of Tower Group International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:TWGP)


6) In light of the 3:1 net premiums written to surplus ratio agreed upon with the NYDFS,
what is the current net premiums written to surplus as the NYDFS will measure it (please
specify if measurement is other than U.S. SAP)? If below 3:1, why was the condition "[f]or
the year ending December 31, 2015"?


Note: One would expect the condition to be immediate if it was not a binding constraint.

7) What is the amount of AII's assets on line 4 that need to be paid off (50% by year-end
2014), and how does the Company plan to pay it off?


Capitalized Costs


8) Why is the amortization of DAC per annum, as a % of the beginning balance DAC,
significantly lower than Net Earned Premiums per annum, as a % of the beginning
balance Net Unearned Premiums?


Note: Regardless of duration, net DAC should be amortized in proportion to the
recognition of net premiums.


9) As of December 31, 2006-2013 and September 30, 2014, what was the Net Unearned
Premium for each segment (Net DAC for each segment is disclosed in Schedule III of
AFSI's Forms 10-K)?


10) What are the $672.0 million of "Prepaid Expenses & Other Assets" that are not life
settlement contracts?

Yeah, just like Tower was, and then they took $800M reserves adjustment and blew up in a spectacular way.
The NY department of insurance is a mess. Lawsky needs to get going ASAP. It is possible that personal
relationships between AM Trust employees and NY insurance department employees is what allows them to
keep "cooking the books". Tower actually was cooking the books for years before they could not do it
anymore, and had to lift the carpet. In the case of Tower, many Tower employees used to work for the NY
department of insurance before they went to work for Tower....

Hope you got a chance to cover your shorts before broker called you to top up margin. You should do that next time
right after you release your article.

AmTrust seems to take a little notice here http://bit.ly/1qmTUog

Not sure where you pulled that from, but it's not signed by anyone and is not available from the AmTrust
investor portion of their website.

Just curious if you think these apparently very good latest quarter earnings and company business expansion are
smoke and mirrors? If so, can you offer a line by line rebuttal and document your rebuttal with sound insurance
accounting principles?

DevilsAdv
Most likely they are cooking the books just like Tower, they company they bought, did. Now, why the DOI allows them
to do this is beyond me, but as now they are investigating AM Trust, it is a matter of time for the company to go belly
up in a spectacular way.

They aren't being "investigated" not sure where you came up with that. Stipulations were placed on the Tower
acquisition, but that's quite a leap to "investigated".


04 Nov 2014, 09:18 AM 


DevilsAdv
Oh i thought they were being investigated. Now that i know they are not, am calling the department to ask
what is going on. The department among other things, asked them to hire a REAL ACTUARY (2 actuaries
actually) and make him the head of the department. Do you see any possible reserving issues here? I
certainly do. The reason investors are gambling on this stock is because they think there is profit to still be
made, and enough time to sell and run away before the ship sinks. Everyone in insurance, other than Lawsky
and his team, knows that their business model is not sustainable. But after the Tower debacle people woke
up; only Lawsky is still sleeping. This is the same story as with Mr. Lee over at Tower. He was investors for
years about his efficient hybrid business model, sucked billions of dollars of investors money, sold his shares
and cut and run. But Tower is under investigation from the SEC now.

Hey Gotham, have you covered any portion of your short position over the last week? Would have been a good
opportunity. Just saying.
