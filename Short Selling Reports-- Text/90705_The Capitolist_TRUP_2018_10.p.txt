TRUP


A white paper released yesterday by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (NAIC) questions the legality of Veterinarians soliciting insurance.


The paper, written with input from state regulators, raises specific concerns about
unlicensed veterinarians marketing pet insurance and calls for additional regulatory
action.


As a result, in my opinion, all 50 states will likely need to evaluate the regulation of
pet insurance and pet insurance carriers.


TRUP is still overvalued in comparison to peers and thus I continue to see
$10/share (or ~3x book) as fair value.

Solicitation, Solicitation, Solicitation...


State Regulators have begun the process of ramping up the regulation of the Pet
insurance business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), has
released a white paper titled, “A Regulator’s Guide to Pet Insurance” (LINK). The report,
written with input from state regulators, raises specific concerns about unlicensed
veterinarians marketing pet insurance and states that there is a need for additional
regulatory action.


The report provides an in-depth review of the pet insurance market and then, under the
heading of “REGULATORY CONCERNS,” under the subheading "Use of Nonlicensed
Producers to Market and Sell Pet Insurance" it states (p.37):


“Additional insurance departments have found that some pet insurance products
are being marketed through unlicensed producers, including veterinarians. In
some instances, veterinarians and their staff are incentivized to market specific
products with potential for rewards like gift cards, products or even paid vacations.
Use of non-licensed personnel for the marketing of insurance products
creates a need for additional regulatory investigations and may result in
insurer examination.”


To be clear, although the incentives through Trupanion’s vet rewards program may have
made things worse, NAIC seems to have concerns about veterinarians soliciting
insurance products on Trupanion’s behalf with, or without, these kickbacks. Therefore,
Trupanion’s recent decision to end its veterinary rewards program, does not
alleviate this new regulatory risk. More broadly the type of marketing highlighted
yesterday in, "Trupanion: NAIC To Address Pet Insurance This Weekend" is considered
solicitation and could be directly addressed after this paper.


If NAIC takes action to prohibit the “use of non-licensed personnel for the marketing of
insurance products,” we believe it will be extremely costly and disruptive to Trupanion’s
business to get into compliance. According to the Form 10Q Veterinarians drive a
majority of the company’s new subscriptions and we question whether Trupanion will be
able to sufficiently ensure vets always comply with these laws while they discuss
insurance in their exam rooms. Certainly, more intrusive efforts will be required than the
“What You Should Know” document that Trupanion produced for veterinarians last
week.

Where Would The NAIC Get The Impression That Vets Are Soliciting for
NASDAQ:TRUP?


Note: Trupanion’s November, 1st 8-k about the conclusion of their vet rewards
program states, “This program does not incentivize enrollments.” However, the
report excerpt above makes it clear that NAIC thinks rewards programs writ large
pose a regulatory concern.


Lets peruse the internet...

In the screen shot above the veterinarian clinic not only endorses a specific insurance
carrier but also discusses key aspects of the insurance contract itself: "Trupanion covers
90% of the ACTUAL BILL for accident and illness claims (after exam fee and optional
deductible)."


This is but one example of veterinarian clinics unknowingly breaking solicitation and
marketing laws on behalf of TRUP. The Veterinarian Information Network published this
article last week highlighting the issue via this quote, "It sounds like ... we should make
clients aware of pet insurance but not recommend any particular pet insurance. I had no
idea that that was illegal, or that we were selling insurance."

To be clear - I believe that regulators are concerned that any given individual
policy is not necessarily the best product for the consumer (either now or in the
future), which is why these products are traditionally solicited and sold through
licensed professionals who are required to understand the nuances of the
financial contract. Nationwide agrees that soliciting and marketing policies via
unlicensed producers (veterinarians) and clerks will result in greater confusion among
consumers and lead to dissatisfaction (see point 8 below).

Who Wrote This White Paper?


What is the NAIC and Why do We Care?


Conclusion


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


NAIC’s Property and Casualty Insurance Committee released the report yesterday. This
opened a 30-day public comment period and we understand the report will be a topic of
discussion during NAIC’s Fall 2018 National Meeting, November 15-18.


Report was drafted with input from the 15 state regulators that make up NAIC's Property
and Casualty Insurance Committee. Membership of this Committee includes regulators
from the following states: Illinois, West Virginia, Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut,
Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota.


Just states that the members of the Committee represent comprise 22% of the 2017
premiums written by TRUP in 2017.


The NAIC pet insurance white paper will be presented by the Deputy Commission of
Lousiana's Department of Insurance to state regulators from across the country during
the NAIC Fall Meeting on Saturday, November 17, 2018. (LINK)


NAIC is the national group of state insurance regulators which is charged with setting
national standards for insurance laws. The drafting of this report included input from a
diverse group of states. It is now clear that many state regulators beyond Washington
and Colorado have concerns about this industry and the process to establish new
regulations for pet insurance, including specifically the marketing by unlicensed
veterinarians, is now underway.


As expected, regulatory scrutiny of Trupanion’s business practices has now reached a
level well beyond any single state. A nationwide multi-state regulatory realignment is
going to directly challenge the structure of company's sales funnel. Even if Trupanion is
able to secure a settlement with Washington state, further fundamental changes to
regulatory landscape and Trupanion’s pet acquisition model are moving forward.
