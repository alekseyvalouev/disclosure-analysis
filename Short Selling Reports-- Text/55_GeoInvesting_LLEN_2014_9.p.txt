GeoInvesting Investigation Shows How A Government Official
Confirmed L&L Energy Fabricated Revenues From Its ZoneLin Coking
Plant

Summary


Today's report, the second in our "In the Public Interest" series, continues to unveil
the evidence supporting our LLEN findings that we shared with regulators last Fall.


In this part, we show how we gathered evidence showing that LLEN's ZoneLin
facility was shut down and could in no way produce the revenue purported by LLEN.


The most damning evidence: the interview with the Henzhao Village Communist
Party General Secretary, and the in-depth investigation that China's National
Business Daily conducted itself.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


In today's report, Part Two, GeoInvesting continues publication of the extensive evidence
underlying our September 19, 2013 report accusing L&L Energy (NASDAQ:LLEN) of
making massive misrepresentations in its SEC filings. The public has never seen this
evidence, which we shared privately with the SEC, NASDAQ, and LLEN's terminated
independent legal counsel Mr. Mark Bartlett, in order to give them time to conduct their
own investigations. Part one can be found here.


The evidence, consisting of interviews of local residents and government officials,
including the local Communist Party Chief ("CPC"), proves according to the CPC that
LLEN fabricated revenues from the ZoneLin Coking Plant and failed to disclose that
ZoneLin was actually shut down in February 2012, nine months before the purported
asset swap with Union Energy.


Investigators first visited the demolished ZoneLin plant in July 2013 and interviewed local
residents using the plant's gutted-out weighing station. The local residents provided some
initial insight into the problems at ZoneLin that led to its closure and demolition. The
notable points of these interviews are set forth below.

a) ZoneLin stopped production about one year ago or since September 2012.
[Contradicted by the local Communist Party General Secretary's detailed explanation,
below, that ZoneLin was shut down in February 2012]


b) Prior to be shut down, ZoneLin was not producing much and was always operating at a
loss.


c) The local government paid money for the plant.


d) For the next 15 years the government decides what to do with the land.


e) The boss was LaoZhong Yang.


In September 2013 the investigators interviewed government officials in the villages next
to the ZoneLin Coking Plant. The first official interviewed believed the plant was shut down
in September or October 2012. However, the second official (General Secretary) provided
a detailed explanation of how the plant actually stopped production in February 2012 as a
result of the November 2011 Shizong mine accident (the same accident that LLEN failed
to disclose had shuttered the Hong Xing Coal Washing Facility). The local residents and

first official perhaps believed that the plant was still running in October 2012 because, as
the General Secretary explained (below), the fire was being maintained in the plant's
coking oven to protect it, giving the appearance that the plant was still running.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2154633-geoinvesting-investigation-shows-how-a-government-official-confirmed-l-and-l-energy-fabricated-revenues-from-its-zonelin-c


c) LLEN prepared monthly, and eventually, quarterly financial reports for ZoneLin to be
used mainly for going public. The financials were not really reliable.


d) The November 10, 2011 Shizong mine accident shut down the coal supply to ZoneLin.
Without coal, ZoneLin could only operate for about two more months, until the Chinese
New Year, around February 2012.


e) The government mandated the capacity expansion of ZoneLin in 2008 or 2009, which
had to be completed by 2010 or 2011 (or the plant would face closure).


f) All of ZoneLin's permits and certificates were issued under Yang's name and had been
witnessed by the official, who considered Yang a friend.


g) The ZoneLin plant was torn down in December 2012 and took about 40 days to
complete.


h) The ZoneLin plant was idled in February 2012, but continued to keep the fire going to
protect the ovens, making it look as if the plant was still operating, even until it was torn
down.


i) The ZoneLin land (100 Mu area) was always collectively owned by the village and is
designated for agricultural use and can be rented for 800 RMB per Mu per year. ZoneLin
had originally paid rent annually, and later on paid once every two years.


j) The government paid 1.5 million RMB to LaoZhong Yang as compensation (based on
the size of its ovens) for the demolition of the plant.


The timing and circumstances of ZoneLin's shutdown does not remotely resemble what
LLEN disclosed in its SEC filings. In the end, each investor must decide which source
he/she believes. For us, the obvious choice is the local Communist Party General
Secretary, who we found to have a rich and detailed recollection of his own personal
experience with the operation, finances, and closure of the ZoneLin facility.


Once again, the evidence really speaks for itself. Investors who once mocked our
technique of talking to the local community (in this case, squatters at the ZoneLin facility)
can now see that we prefer to use them as background information or as a source of
leads. We have never maintained that villager interviews are conclusive in and of
themselves. The local government officials we subsequently interview are obviously a
more conclusive source of information.

To drive our point home, our approach to this type of due diligence is now even being
mimicked by major investment firms, auditors, and as seen below, The National Business
Daily ("NBD"), a nationally renowned news agency in China. When we introduced the
LLEN story to the world, NBD took the initiative to conduct its own inquiries.


In October 2013, the NBD reporters covering the story did an on-site investigation into
LLEN's operation. On April 17 and April 18, 2014, NBD published a series of four articles
detailing its investigation.


April 17, 2014


"LLEN's Controlling Shareholder is Prosecuted in the USA for Fraud: LLEN Voluntarily
Applies for Delisting" (http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2014-04-17/826537.html)


April 18, 2014


"The Cloud Over LLEN's Coal Washing Business: Nearly 500 Million in Revenue
Cannot be Confirmed" (http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2014-04-18/826944.html)
"LLEN's Mining Rights Doubtful, Business Operations do not Reflects its Financial
Statements" (http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2014-04-18/826927.html)
"LLEN's Chinese Manager: Dickson Lee's Prosecution is Irrelevant to the Company"
(http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2014-04-18/826925.html)


We've summed up NBD's most salient findings below:


Hong Xing Coal Washing


The reporter(s) visited both the Shizong County State Tax Bureau and the Shizong
County Local Tax Bureau. Based on local tax filings, Hong Xing did not have any
taxable activities after June 2012.
Based on the Industrial & IT Bureau of Shizong County, in 2012 Hong Xing had
revenue of RMB 86.77 million, net income of RMB 7.56 million and total tax paid of
RMB 3.47 million. Hong Xing ceased its operation in 2012.
The reporter(s) talked to Mr. Li HongXing, who was the original owner of the Hong
Xing Coal Washing plant and is the current owner of the Lannigou Coal Mine, a mine
adjacent to the Hong Xing Coal Washing plant. Mr. Li HongXing comes to the
Lannigou Coal Mine regularly and can observe Hong Xing Coal Washing's daily
operation. Mr. Li HongXing confirmed that from around 2012, the Hong Xing Coal
Washing facility ceased its operations.
An employee of the Walu Village Committee also confirmed that Hong Xing Coal
Washing ceased its operation in 2012.

Zhao Jun'an, Taifung's accountant, confirmed that Hong Xing Coal Washing ceased its
operation in June 2012 and has not filed any tax report since then.


Taifung Coal Washing and Hengtai Coal Washing


The Taifung Coal Washing facility does not exist; there is only a Hengtai Coal Washing
facility that is owned by Yang Laozhong. Hengtai Coal Washing was established in
June 2012.
The reporter(s) talked to Mr. Yang Shulin, who claimed to be the brother of Yang
Laozhong. Mr. Yang Shulin confirmed that Hong Xing ceased its operation in 2012.
From its establishment in June 2012 until November 2013, Hengtai only washed
around 70,000 to 80,000 tons of coal, and its total revenue was only RMB 50 to 60
million.
Mr. Yang Shulin confirmed that, in Shizong County, there are only two active coal
washing factories - the Hengtai Coal Washing and the Minzhu Coal Washing, the latter
of which is owned by an individual from Sichuan province.
Zhao Jun'an, Taifung's accountant, confirmed that the Hengtai Coal Washing is owned
by Yang Laozhong, not by Taifung and/or LLEN.


LaShu Mine, LuoZhou Mine, and WeiShe Mine


While visiting the WeiShe mine, the reporter(s) met Mr. Liu, who claimed to be the
manager of the WeiShe, LaShu and LuoZhou mines. Mr. Liu confirmed that Union
Energy owned these three mines.
Song Zhang, the administrative vice general manager of Union Energy, confirmed that
Union Energy owned the WeiShe, LaShu, and LuoZhou mines.
All SAIC files do not show that LLEN owns any interest in the LaShu, LuoZhou, and
WeiShe mines. The SAIC files of the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines also do not show
LLEN's ownership.
Before August 2013, the WeiShe Mine only produced engineering (development) coal.
The LaShu Mine started its production as of November 2013.
The LuoZhou Mine ceased production in September 2013, and most of the miners left
the mine. Mr. Qing, manager of LuoZhou's logistics department, stated that the reason
for the production shutdown is unknown.


NBD's detailed investigation clearly and independently supports many of our conclusions
and raises important new issues on its own.

even if you are correct that L & L Energy reported falsely from jonlin coking plant; they did reported revenue from
other plants that are correct; the stock at 0.31/sh is a buy based on other revenues and income; its too darn cheap. I

Agreed! Furthermore, these allegations look so baseless. I expect a good PR to come out soon, which should
drive the price up. The company must have been producing strong cash to pay its management all these
years. Lee is out. Everyone who is left is quite reputable. These people wouldn't stay around for a mirage.

Yes....GEO is telling readers an incomplete story as a conclusive report here.

The charges against CEO has nothing whatsoever to do with company's earnings, which I have no evidence
to believe are not real. They searched the company's e-mails (clearly shown if you read the court evidence),
and if the current charges against the CEO is all that was found, I have every reason to believe earnings must
be real. Just have a look at the P/E and you will know what an opportunity this is.


The charges to CEO date back to 2008, when GEOinvesting itself used to pump LLEN on its own blog. Check
it. These guys are into the pump and dump business.


There are hardly any investments better than this out there. Almost 100 percent up today. This is the
cheapest stock out there I know. As Buffett would say, it's like cigarette on the floor, it may only have one puff
in it, but it's a free puff. I'll take it.

GEO, You're acting like a petulant child who has long since driven past the last exit to relevance. If you actually had
any evidence of wrong-doing that you provided to the federal regulators, there would be an indictment by now
because the grand jury already met in January. Yet all that was handed down was a false CFO certification in 2008
under Sarb Ox. Therefore, the review of your evidence by the appropriate regulators has already happened and you
have no evidence. That's a final ruling.

"the in-depth investigation that China's National Business Daily conducted itself."


You mean the information they got from GEO and published? Kind of like Cheney saying the NY Times backed up his
account, but forgot to mention the NY Times got their info from Cheney.

Interesting that GEO gets used to providing non-current information.


According to the 10Q filed on March 17, 2013 (http://bit.ly/1gPO1uG), page 30:


"In November, three of our mines were temporarily idled for government safety inspections. On November 5, 2014,
the Guizhou provincial government issued a notice stating that there would be mine safety inspections throughout the
province from November 5, 2013 to December 31, 2013 (the “Guizhou Notice”).


Our WeiShe, LaShu and LuoZhou mines, all of which are located in Guizhou province, were required to cease
production beginning November 6, 2013 until they were inspected. All three of our Guizhou mines passed inspection
and were given permission to resume production during the month of December 2013. LaShu Mine resumed
production on December 9, 2013 and WeiShe mine resume production on December 16, 2013.


LuoZhou Mine was idled for an extended period of time while engineers amended the mining plan due to a geological
fault found beneath the mine shaft. After passing inspection, LuoZhou Mine resumed production in March 2014."


GEO should include in its Editor' Note that its investigations of this report were only upto September 27, 2013 and that
investors should be cautioned to conduct their own due diligence beyond this date for most current and complete

Great work as always Geo. It won't be long before the OTC listing gets axed and the stock stops trading once and for
all. It's coming. I still think that the SEC eventually shuts down SIAF, as that scam has been swindling lemmings for
years. Even when I exposed blatant fraud, the Kool-Aid was powerful enough to keep the stock afloat.
