Neonode: Investors Feel Duped, Shares To Fall Further

Warnings about reverse merger stock promotions


Over the past few months, I have written a series of articles describing promotional activity
which often precedes equity offerings by small cap, reverse merger companies. Such
promotions often take the form of "transformational" press releases from the companies
along with hyper bullish articles by independent authors. The stock price surges
accordingly. Following my articles, and the predictable equity offerings described, these
stocks have often declined by more than 50% over the course of just a few weeks. I have
included a number of reference examples below and I strongly encourage readers to take
note of these repeated precedents.


Investment overview


Over the past six months, shares of Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) have risen by as much
as 60% during a very well executed promotional campaign. This rise in share price has
occurred even as Neonode's revenues have plunged following the loss of its largest
customer. Yesterday the stock fell by as much as 13% in after hours trading due to the
announcement of an equity offering. Insider selling represented a rather large 50% of the
offering. The insider selling came from a wide range of executives (including both the CEO
and CFO) and directors and raised $7 million for them personally. This follows $2 million of
insider selling in August. Just after the offering was announced, Wellington also filed a
13G filing stating that it had cut its stake in Neonode in half. Wellington is now below the
10% threshold and will not need to report further sales.


There are four reasons why this offering is perceived by investors as being notably
abusive:


First, Neonode had just recently indicated that "we believe that our existing balance sheet
can carry us to breakeven". Clearly this was interpreted by investors to mean that there
would not be an equity offering.


Second, the large insider sales are coming directly on the heels of what appeared to be
major and "transformative" business announcements. The fact that insiders are selling
heavily casts doubt on the real impact expected from these recent press releases.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1686262-neonode-investors-feel-duped-shares-to-fall-further 2/29


Third, the "greenshoe" over-allotment option of nearly 300,000 extra shares in the offering
is coming exclusively from selling insiders. Typically the greenshoe comes from the
company itself, allowing the company to raise greater proceeds. But these insiders wanted
to sell all of the extra shares for themselves. This is extremely unusual and abusive for a
greenshoe option.


Fourth, buried in the disclosure are clues that the insider selling is going to keep
increasing in the next few months. Insiders are not nearly done selling. First was the sale
of $2 million in stock in August. Then came an additional $7 million in September. Then is
the $1.5 million greenshoe. But now we can see buried in the disclosure that the
Executive Chairman intends to sell at least $1 million in additional stock within the next 60
days as part of a personal loan swap. The selling is not nearly done for insiders of
Neonode and this will be done regardless of price.


As I will show below, shares of Neonode are likely to fall by a further 40-60% in the
next few weeks.


There has been a well-executed promotional campaign on Neonode which caused the
stock to soar, just in time for insiders to cash out. The recent design and licensing wins
announced by Neonode (and which caused the price spike) are virtually identical to more
than 100 other announcements by the company over the past 4 years. Yet these recent
identical releases have been trumpeted as the source of truly unprecedented and
transformational revenue growth which is supposedly going to begin within months.

The past wins for Neonode were consistently from the biggest names in the tech space,
including Sony (NYSE:SNE), Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),
and others. Despite the regular appearance of massive wins, Neonode has been unable
to generate consistent revenues from these agreements and has never made any profit
whatsoever. Total revenue so far in 2013 is just $1.7 million, even after more than 70
major design wins announced in 2012 alone. Predictions of any surge in revenues for
Neonode are entirely unfounded and simply helped the stock to rise in time for an equity
offering.


Background to the promotion


Last Wednesday, Neonode announced that "it has entered a new worldwide license
agreement with a second undisclosed Tier-One Consumer Electronics OEM in South
Korea". However, it was quite notable that the stock barely budged on the news.


On Thursday (the very next day), Seeking Alpha author Tech Guru drew attention to this
development in his 11th bullish Neonode article since March. The shares immediately
soared by nearly 20%. Part of the reason for this was that the author identified both
Samsung and LG as the partners for Neonode. Neonode had left the parties anonymous.
Another reason was likely that the author mapped out a very clear $27 share price target
for the company based on the news.


However, despite the now familiar hyper enthusiasm from Tech Guru, we can see that the
stock quickly gave back almost all of these strong gains, fading from just under $8.00 to
around $6.90.


The latest "license agreement" announcement from Neonode follows multiple consecutive
years with over 100 nearly identical announcements and partnerships with global
technology giants. Past announcements have included: Texas Instruments, Sony,
Amazon, Sony Ericsson Mobile, Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Alpine, LG Display and
many others.


As with the recent wins by Neonode, the past names of the giant customers were often
not released at the time of the announcement. In each case, the unnamed customer is a
"global" or "tier one" OEM giant who is a leader in their product class.


Past examples (just like the recent ones) have included manufacturers of "white goods",
PCs, consumer electronics, mobile phones and others. Sometime later it is occasionally
uncovered that the identity of the customer is one of the largest tech giants in the world,
such as Sony.

The latest wins from Neonode once again fit this pattern precisely. The customer is
unnamed, but it is (as always) a "leading" global giant. Tech Guru then filled in the blanks
for who the counter party was, naming both Samsung and LG.


But in each case over the past 4 years, we can see one of two outcomes after these
announcements. First, in many cases, the much anticipated revenue simply never
materializes, despite the unbridled enthusiasm in the press release. This is why Neonode
has been careful to include the following disclosure at the bottom of these frequent mega
announcements:


Even if the customer or partner always has the intention to actually launch a
commercial product or product line in high volume, there is no guarantee that this
will be the case.


In other words, announcements such as the one last week are in fact just preliminary
indications which may never be realized. In fact, on most occasions, the revenues are not
realized. Yet Tech Guru has presented the latest news as if the revenues were in fact
guaranteed.


Readers should note that just in the first half of 2012 alone, Neonode announced 40
individual design wins and 7 licensing agreements! It was clearly a very busy and
promising 6 months in 1H2012. By year end, the number surged to 72 design wins and 12
licensing wins for 2012. These agreements often came from the biggest of the global
technology behemoths in the industry.


Yet after 12-18 months, revenues are still sitting at around just $1 million per quarter -
almost nothing, despite the marquee nature of the dozens of signed global counter
parties. Revenues in Q1 were even worse at just $500,000.


As a second problem, even when some revenues did materialize, the amounts from these
global technology giants ended up being so tiny (despite huge volumes) that Neonode has
never been able to generate a profit in its entire history.


Despite the high profile nature of over 100 such announced agreements, total revenue
across these 4 years has amounted to just $15 million cumulatively. As we will see below,
Tech Guru has justified his "4 bagger" target by stating that these identical press releases
will suddenly result in revenue surging to $58 million in just 2014 alone.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1686262-neonode-investors-feel-duped-shares-to-fall-further 5/29


Net losses over the past 4 years have amounted to $72 million, with $9 million in losses
last year alone. But in justifying his $27 target, Tech Guru has stated that Neonode's first
ever profit will suddenly amount to a staggering $32 million.


Neonode's best year ever was 2012. The reason for the "record" revenues that year was
that Neonode was successfully selling to Amazon/Kindle, Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile and
Barnes & Noble as current customers. Yet even when successfully doing business with
the biggest names in the business and on huge volume, Neonode only generated a mere
$7 million in total revenues that year.


Last year Morgan Stanley estimated that Amazon sold between $3-4 billion in Kindles.
From this huge volume, Neonode realized a tiny $3 million in total revenues from Amazon.
As a result, Neonode reported a net loss of $9 million for the year despite recording its
best ever revenues.


Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble have discontinued the use of Neonode products, which
explains the dramatic plunge in revenues in 2013 (even though Sony and Sony Ericsson
are still sources of revenue).


The point is that Neonode already has a long and established history of signing new
agreements and winning design wins with the absolute biggest technology giants in the
business. Neonode has had tech titan Texas Instruments as a customer/partner since
2010. Likewise Sony and Sony Ericsson Mobile have been customers for years. Amazon
was their largest customer in both 2011 and 2012.


If Neonode cannot manage to report a profit when supplying to that type of volume and to
the biggest tech clients on the planet, then it is hard to imagine what will be required
before we finally might see a profit. Likewise, when investors calibrate their expectations
about what to expect from recent wins (such as Samsung and LG), they need to keep in
mind that $7 million was a spectacular year in which Neonode was partnered with the
largest names in the tech business.


The fact that we are now adding Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and LG into the mix does not
change the fact that Neonode cannot transform these wins into meaningful revenues or
profits. Nor does it even ensure that these agreements will actually result in any revenues
AT ALL. Most of the past big name agreements resulted in little or no eventual revenue
(see below).

It isn't the lack of big name design and licensing wins that has limited the prospects for
Neonode. Instead it is the fact that Neonode's technology is already encountering a
functional and competitive disadvantage. This is just the reality of the business and it is
being reflected in Neonode's financials.


We know that last year Amazon discontinued the use of Neonode's infrared touch sensor
because it wanted to go with a capacitive touch sensor. Capacitive touch sensors are
lighter, thinner and more responsive, making this a very intuitive decision in the
competitive e-reader market.


This "functional obsolescence" does not mean that Neonode will suddenly lose 100% of
its customers. Instead, Neonode will end up serving markets which have a less
demanding set of requirements and which are willing to compromise quality in exchange
for a rock bottom, commodity price.


For example, instead of being used in e-readers and tablets for adults, Neonode's sensor
is now being used in the $150 LeapFrog Leap Pad. This is a children's learning device
which is sold at Toys R Us. It is clearly more of a toy than a computer. If there is long
latency after touching the screen or if it is less responsive, this is less of a concern in a
children's toy which is purchased for them by their parents as a learning toy. Unlike an e-
reader or tablet, a heavy emphasis on small size and light weight are not really
competitive considerations at all. As a result, LeapFrog is willing to use the fatter, heavier
and less responsive Neonode sensor simply because it costs almost nothing.


As soon as the e-toy was launched, author Tech Guru was quick to highlight its
significance for Neonode. He notes that last year LeapFrog sold 2.5 million units, and he
projects that it will sell 4.5 million units this year. He is predicting that Neonode will
somehow realize greater revenues from this small scale children's toy than they did from
$3-4 billion in Amazon Kindle volume. This is simply unfounded.


Likewise, Neonode recently announced that it had introduced "the world's first one dollar
touch solution", saying:


With an unsurpassed ultra-low BOM cost of only $1 (US) in high volumes, it is
specifically designed to meet the aggressive price requirements in super cost-
sensitive product segments.

Once again, it is clear that as the price continues to fall, Neonode's ability to generate
meaningful revenue falls even further - even at huge Kindle-like volumes which might be
realized from a Samsung or LG. This is why their product is more appropriate as an
alternative to simple physical buttons on "white goods" (appliances). It quite literally costs
almost nothing.


But fast money day traders have figured out one thing for certain: when news of a big
design win is properly trumpeted, the stock will briefly rise. Buying on the rumor has been
a consistently winning short-term trading strategy with Neonode shares.


On August 6th (notably just one day before earnings) Neonode announced that


Neonode Lands PC Design Win With Tier One PC OEM


Once again, this language is nearly identical to the language used in no-name Neonode
press releases over the past 4 years. As expected, the stock immediately jumped by as
much as 13% to a new high of $8.84. But by the end of the day, the stock had closed just
about flat at $7.90. Buy on the rumor, sell on the news. Again.


Following earnings (the very next day), investors quickly realized that adding yet another
one of dozens of similar wins was clearly not translating into any meaningful revenues
(and certainly not profits). Neonode announced revenues of just $1.2 million (down by
40% from a year earlier) and the stock quickly sank to as low as $6.80 - nearly 25% below
the previous highs.


In the weeks that followed, Neonode then traded down to around $6.30, and only rallied
again following the most recent press releases.


In short, the usual "design win" boost was (as always) very short lived. This is what we
have seen time and time again with Neonode. Massive design and licensing wins are very
common. In each case they are described as "transformative" or even "disruptive". But in
each quarter we can see that material revenues always fail to materialize.


This explains why the share price always gives back its gains even after very short and
explosive rallies.


But now that insiders have sold and Neonode has issued stock, there is little incentive to
continue the promotional campaign. Furthermore, by selling large chunks of stock just
after announcing such bullish news, management has shown its hand that the news isn't
so big after all. This fact alone will cause many former bulls to quickly sell.

Looking at Tech Guru's articles


Seeking Alpha author Tech Guru has certainly been a boon to Neonode. The company
consistently refrains from disclosing the names of its customers and licensees. In the vast
majority of cases, it simply describes its counter parties as being anonymous "Tier One"
players in their given industry.


When the names of the giant potential customers are unknown, the effect of the
announcements on the share price is often muted. Fortunately, Tech Guru has been able
to uncover the likely identity in each case by relying on very obscurely disclosed technical
information in hard to find locations.


If one didn't know where to look in advance, one would certainly wonder how such
information could be found for such a wide variety of industries and applications - and all
presumably without the help and guidance of management.


Yet Tech Guru always knows exactly where to find the information that allows one to
deduce the names of each major new win.


By revealing the name of the likely partners, Tech Guru has repeatedly caused a
tremendous surge in the share price of Neonode which otherwise would not be possible.
The simple headline association of tiny, micro-cap Neonode with giants such as Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Sony, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others
is enough to cause a knee jerk share price jump on most occasions.


Given that Neonode insiders were able to sell nearly $2 million in stock in August alone at
prices of $7.49, they should certainly be thanking the anonymous author for publishing the
names of their "anonymous" partners. Prior to his first article on Neonode, the stock was
trading at just over $5.00. It jumped by more than 20% in 2 days following that article. His
more recent articles managed to push the stock into the $7-8 range. The latest article
alone delivered a brief 1 day surge of 20%.


The share price began fading every day, but management was quick to cash in with an
equity offering at a time when the stock had just closed at $6.99.


Since March, Tech Guru has written bullish articles on Neonode 11 times - approximately
once every 3 weeks. Tech Guru has set a $27 share price target for Neonode, meaning
that it will roughly quadruple according to his estimate. Yet oddly he appears to be the only
author to have discovered this 4 bagger gem. No one else has felt the need to write about
Neonode even a single time since he began in March.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1686262-neonode-investors-feel-duped-shares-to-fall-further 9/29


In arriving at the $27 share price target, Tech Guru has attributed $9 of value to a spin-off
of Neonode's IP assets alone. The impetus for this was an announcement that Neonode
would "Explore Strategic Alternatives for Its User-Interface Patent and Licensing
Subsidiary".


In this release, there was no mention from Neonode of any litigation or of the scope or
size of any of these IP assets. It should also be noted that the total value of ALL of the
non-cash assets on Neonode's balance sheet is less than $2 million! This includes ALL
intellectual property (which is valued at near zero) as well as property, plant and
equipment, receivables, intangibles - everything.


Despite these facts, Tech Guru has oddly predicted that Neonode will be able to sue for
patent infringement on the sale of a whopping 2.4 billion smartphone sales by Apple and
Samsung (among others).


Tech Guru is therefore telling us that these patents (valued at zero on the books) are in
fact worth billions. But no one else has figured this out, and supposedly management
would rather just place the patents into a separate company (which it would generously
spin-off and give to Neonode shareholders as a gift).


The $9 per share estimate from Tech Guru values just the spin-off at over $300 million.
This is more than the $240 million value of the entire company as it stands at present - for
just an ambiguous spin-off which potentially has zero value. Tech Guru notes that he feels
that this value is conservative.


The remaining $18 of his $27 share price target is due to the colossal revenue potential
which he feels that Neonode will realize in 2014. The source of these revenues will be
what it has always been in the past: printers, PCs, Automobiles, Children's Tablets,
Handsets, White Goods, E Readers and NRE fees.


According to his estimates, the total will be a staggering $58 million in 2014 revenues.


A chart of Neonode's revenues (as forecast by Tech Guru) would therefore look as shown
below. Six-month revenues will apparently leap from less than $2 million to almost $30
million - an immediate increase of 15x.


This chart is very important, so I strongly suggest that readers click to enlarge it
and have a close look.

The notations on the chart above highlight the historical announcements from Neonode
about "global" and "tier one" design wins and licensing agreements.


As shown, these past wins included LG Display, Sony, Texas Instruments, Alpine and a
host of unnamed leaders in consumer electronics, e-readers, and consumer and business
products.


The effect of these dozens of identical announcements on revenues during those 4 years
is quite obvious. It is almost none. Yet somehow we are to believe that a series of identical
announcements in 2013 is going to cause revenue to increase by a truly staggering 15x in
the next few months. A more realistic view is that this is clearly a substantially inflated
estimate.


Another way to look at this is that despite the huge number of identical announcements
over the past 4 years, total revenues over the 4 years was just $15.6 million. Tech Guru is
therefore predicting that Neonode will bring in almost 4x the total revenues of the past 4
years COMBINED in just 2014 alone. And the reason for this explosion in revenues is
simply that Neonode has put out several press releases which are identical to over 100
similar press releases during the past 4 years. Again, such predictions are entirely
unfounded.

The 72 design wins and 12 licensing agreements in 2012 were in fact far more than has
been announced in 2013. But because the majority of these did not have a marquee
company name attached to them, they generated much less excitement at the time. When
looking at the anonymous releases as they have been made by Neonode (as opposed to
the named releases by Tech Guru), they are far less exciting because they are
anonymous.


Had Tech Guru been releasing the names of the 72 "anonymous" wins in 2012, there
would have been massive excitement because many of these were clearly with the
biggest names in tech. These were disclosed as "Tier One", "World Leading" and "Global
Leaders". There is no doubt that many of these 72 wins in 2012 were with names that
were just as impressive as LG or Samsung.


This explains one part of why the stock refuses to hold its gains after soaring to around
$8.00 on these announcements. There are some investors who now have sky-high
expectations for near-term revenues based on new announcements. But the smarter
money knows that we have seen identical announcements hundreds of times in the past
without any effect on revenues.


Yesterday's equity offering should be reason for any investor to look with strong suspicion
on the stream of press releases and the hyper promotional articles which caused the stock
to surge. IF the stock were about to quadruple over the next 6 months, then management
willingly left nearly $30 million in easy profits on the table by cashing out. A more likely
explanation is that management expects the share price to decline from the current peak.

What did we learn from Uni-Pixel?


Neonode's shares have been promoted on the research side by small-cap investment
bank Craig Hallum. Anyone who follows the activities of Craig Hallum should have
expected an equity offering in the works. This is especially true given that the last upgrade
occurred in August, despite an earnings disaster.


Towards the end of 2012, shares of Neonode were trading for just $3-4. On December
12th, Craig Hallum initiated Neonode with a $7.50 target. This aggressive target was
puzzling because Neonode had just recently lost its largest customer, Amazon, which
accounted for 40% of revenues.


When Neonode released Q2 results in August, the stock quickly sold off by more than
20% due to investor disappointment with deepening losses and almost no revenues. But
Hallum took this opportunity to actually raise its target on Neonode to $10.00 based on
little more than the press releases from the company. This upgrade appears just as
puzzling as the initial target following the loss of Amazon.


In December, the shares immediately jumped to $5.00 and have seldom traded below that
level since then. In August, the upgrade helped to support the stock, allowing
management to sell shares.


Hallum should be distinctly remembered for a very similar performance with Uni-Pixel
(NASDAQ:UNXL), which also happens to be in the same touch sensor business as
Neonode.

Upgrades from Hallum repeatedly helped to drive Uni-Pixel to new highs. Each time the
stock rose to a new high, Hallum simply upgraded the stock again and raised the target to
an even higher level. It was notable that sequential upgrades often occurred despite no
material new developments which would boost revenues or profits. When the stock hit
$35.00 (up 4x in 4 months), Hallum still did not suggest that it was time to take any profits.
Instead, Hallum simply upgraded the stock to $58.00. It was still the case that the only
contract that Uni-Pixel had won had been announced back in December (at which time
Hallum had assigned a target of just $22).


Almost immediately thereafter, Uni-Pixel took advantage of the spike in the share price
and issued $44 million in an equity offering. As expected, it was priced at a 20% discount.
As should have been expected, Hallum was the underwriter and raked in millions in fees.


The stock quickly plunged after the offering and never recovered. With the equity offering
out of the way, Hallum became more realistic about the share price prospects of Uni-Pixel.
Hallum quickly downgraded the stock to $40 based on nothing more than a "production
delay". After peaking out at $42, Uni-Pixel subsequently traded down to around $12.00.


The point is that no matter how high a stock rises, these micro-cap investment banks will
never suggest that it is time to sell. Instead, each new rise is just an excuse to set an even
higher price target.


Such gratuitous upgrades just in advance of a lucrative equity offering are par for the
course for Hallum and other micro-cap investment banks. Both of the Hallum upgrades
occurred when a downgrade would have been more expected due to setbacks at
Neonode.


As with Uni-Pixel, the $10 target placed on Neonode by Hallum (just after last quarter's
earnings disappointment) will become transparently ridiculous once the stock starts
trading in the $3-4 range. This is where Neonode was trading last year when it was still
doing $7 million in revenues and had a large Amazon contract.


Recent precedents


Lately I have done quite well by predicting the sell-offs of small-cap reverse mergers in
anticipation of a predictable financing. This performance should be clear based on the last
few articles I have written. Many of these stocks have fallen by 40-60% following the
article and/or the financing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1686262-neonode-investors-feel-duped-shares-to-fall-further 14/29


It is often the case that these companies see a surge of promotional activity which boosts
the stock at just the time they need to raise money. The promotions typically come in the
form of press releases and bullish articles. This means that the share price spikes up a bit
too high just before the equity raise, but then crashes far lower when stock is issued.


When I wrote about Kandi Technologies (NASDAQ:KNDI), it was clear that the company
was down to just a few million in cash but had over $20 million in debt coming due in
June. The stock had recently traded over $8.00 following a string of positive press
releases and HYPER BULLISH ARTICLES. I predicted that a large financing was
imminent. Within days of my article, Kandi raised $26 million and the share price quickly
began its descent from around $6.50 to $4.50 - a very steep drop from its $8.00 peak. Like
Neonode, many investors and authors had been predicting that the stock would see multi-
bagger returns, above and beyond its $8.00 peak.


When I wrote about Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), I made it clear that the stock had spiked
to $8.50 for all the wrong reasons, including a non-event uplisting and several hyper
bullish articles. The spike made it a compelling time to raise new money and the company
clearly needed it. On the very next day after my second article, Organovo raised $46
million and the share price fell as low as $4.44 - also a very steep drop from $8.50. Prior
to the drop, many small investors were predicting returns of 3-5x (instead of the 50% drop
which materialized).


Other companies I have highlighted still need to complete their offerings. But the need to
finance is now very visible and the share prices have already begun to decline as
investors increasingly expect an offering in the near term.


MiMedx (NASDAQ:MDXG) has already filed to raise $100 million in a stock sale.
Following an unpleasant letter from the FDA, it is likely that MiMedx will be raising equity
at around $3.00 vs. $6.50 when I highlighted the upcoming financing.


When I wrote about the upcoming financing at Biolase, the stock quickly declined by 30%
and management was quickly forced to cut the size of their offering to just $5 million down
from $30 million.


Conclusion - what's the point?


The point from each of these examples is that when an equity offering follows an extended
effort to promote the stock, the stock will quickly begin a substantial decline. Many less
experienced investors try to hope that the offering will "set a floor" under the share price or
that the capital raise will "support the stock". This is almost never the case.

Comments (52)


The advance promotional activity raises the price of the stock to an unwarranted level.
Once the companies and individuals have the cash in the bank, there is little remaining
incentive to continue to run a time intensive promotional campaign. Moreover, many
smarter investors quickly figure out what is going on and make a hasty move for the exits.


As a result, the offering is typically just the beginning for the descent, as opposed to the
end. Investors who ignore the alarm bells are often punished severely with steep losses
within days or weeks.


Over the past 12 months, Neonode has lost its largest customer and revenues have
shriveled to just $1.2 million per quarter. Despite this, the share price more than doubled
based on an aggressive promotional campaign. The basis for the promotion is the notion
that Neonode will secure explosive new revenues from new contracts. But by looking at 4
years of nearly identical press releases, we can see that this is clearly a deeply misguided
notion.


Neonode follows a licensing model not a sales model. As a result, it is not cash intensive
at all. The cash raised by Neonode was clearly more of an excuse to conduct an offering
in which management could sell a large chunk of personal holdings. This should be quite
evident given that insider sales comprised 50% of the offering and that management took
100% of the greenshoe to sell an additional 300,000 shares instead of providing cash to
the company.


As the promotion ends and as investors realize what has happened, it is likely that we will
see Neonode decline by around 40-60% from current levels within the next few weeks.
This would place Neonode back at around $3.50, where it was last year prior to the loss of
Amazon.


Disclosure: I am short NEON. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

You forgot to mention a key fact. they said they would get money if a significant business opportunity came and they
needed it to execute that opportunity. They amounted a big license deal Sept 5.


The offering results in insider sales of 10% on average of their individual holdings. since they have options vesting
and requiring exercising they have taxes to pay on those newly vested shares.

Latest statement on UNXL by SYNA's Senior V.P. .....


"Could you just mention any of the competitors you might have or any new disruptive technologies that might be out
there like the Uni-Pixel or anything like that, how they impact you?


Kathleen Bayless - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and Treasurer 
Many competitors out there, we do have competitors that we see in different parts of the market and different parts of
the business. On the touchpad side of the equation, we have ongoing the number two competitor is ELAN in Taiwan.
The historical competitor is Alps out of Japan. We do continue to see them in the market. In the smartphone side of
the equation, it's primarily and domestically Cypress, Atmel, and there's some China based guys, [indiscernible] that
we see in China. That's a bigger market, so there's a few more competitors. The one thing that we do see is, we have
the broadest product portfolio, so we don't see anybody consistently where we go. There's different players that would
play at one OEM or in a high-end versus a mid-range versus – or a China based business.


When you mentioned Uni-Pixel, we view that as good news. What it is, is it's a metal mesh technology. So one of the
things, as we look at penetrating the PC, notebook side of the question with larger touchscreens, the traditional
material called ITO which is a circuitry that's utilized for smartphones and tablets, its performance really breaks down
when you get to larger touchscreens and it's very expensive and the yield is poor. And so there's a lot of work that's
been going on for years looking at newer types of technologies like metal mesh. So again, the promise of metal mesh
is better performance over large touchscreens and it could be a lower cost type solution.

So what we do is we work in this supply chain to enable basically the best solution overall. So I mean our goal is to
continue to push adoption, and if it's new technologies that are coming into the market, I mean we've been working
with all of the players out there to simplify solutions, bring down the cost of solutions and improve performance. I think
we're out of time"

Yes, you predicted KNDI would do a financing. A "large" financing to use your own words, "survive". Over your two hit
articles on KNDI, you stated definitively that KNDI would have a difficult time surviving base on the following short
term needs.


1. $23 million for the notes coming due you mention above.  
2. They had come up with an additional $40 million to pay off their new Changxing China 100,000 EV assembly
facility  
3. They had to come up with $80 million for their half contribution to the Kandi-Geely Joint Venture.


Pretty scary stuff for a company with only a $200 million market cap.


Well funny thing happened last quarter. Not only did KNDI make the payment you referred to in this article,THEY
ALSO MADE THE $40 million payment AND THE $80 MILLION PAYMENT for their share of the JV. Not only did they
make all of those payments, but they ALSO INCREASED THEIR FINISHED INVENTORY $10 million AND
ADVANCED ANOTHER $25 TO SUPPLIERS in order to be able to fulfill their commitment for their 5000-10,000 EV
order for the CarShare program by this years end. THIS ORDER WILL ADD $50 and $100 ILLION REVENUES TO
THIS YEARS LAST HALF AND OVER $.50 A SHARE TO EARNINGS.


And when the subsidy program that was just finally approved by the four ministries in China on Monday, is put into
effect , they have to deliver another 5000-6000 EV's to Hangzhou to fill the list of registrants for the Hangzhou Long
Lease program.


But here is what just doesn't jive with your "PREDICTION". They funded all these payments BEFORE THE END OF
LAST QUARTER as per their 2ND quarter 10Q without using one dime from the offering you "said was mandatory".
THAT OFFERING DIDN'T CLOSE UNTIL JULY 1, AFTER THE END OF THE QUARTER. So it would not show on
their books until the current quarter.


So you managed to sucker some innocent ignorant investors out of the stock cheap so you could make a few bucks
off of your proclaimed short position and your July $5 puts which your article put in the money by expiration. Good for
you. Because you also allowed some smart large investors to position the stock in the $4 level as can be seen by the
two new 5% holders that reported a month or so ago.


But what is most exciting to shareholders, is that you managed to sucker in a whole lot of new short selling causing
the reported short interest to double to 3.1 million shares as per the last report. Almost 20% of the float. My only hope

is that you are still one of the current short holders, because as of the last couple of days, there are no shares left
anywhere to borrow.


So "TSLA" days are soon to come to KNDI, lets hope you are one of the ones run over.

Oh and hey Art, (can I call you dude?)...don't forget the best part of Pearson's KNDI hit piece. (IMO) He
managed to give you credit for swinging the PPS up 60% in a day!


For those who haven't read it, Pearson's first KNDI article conjures up quite the conspiracy theory, and the
comments section is overflowing with unanswered questions about inaccuracies and even a couple full-blown
lies. It even got pegged with a rare editors note warning about disputed info.


Also, KNDI and many of Pearson's other drive-by short targets are recovering quite well and some are way
up. So don't let him compliment himself too much.


11 Sep 2013, 12:20 PM

Pearson did the same tactic with ONVO. False information, using other authors articles that contained
incorrect facts that were corrected but not mentioned, SA edited a rebuttal article and over 300 comments on
two articles with one response to pat himself on the back and throw out innuendo. I didn't even have to read
this one to know its more of the same, self serving trash. ONVO has traded over $6 since his hit pieces.

CShepguy-Yea. three weeks after I put out an article which saw the average daily volume below 50k, and
then it wakes up from 3.70 with an 18.7 million share day followed by 70 million over the next month which
saw the stock hit 8.50. .


I am good, aren't I? You just have to wait three weeks after I write it up to buy the stock.


Oh well, the KNDI is still $2 higher than when I put out that article.


You notice he does not dis claim to be short KNDI any longer. And it is also interesting to see NEON, that he
does claim to be short, up .35 today.

Richard, Great article on NEON. Looks like a lot of hype. 
Market is having a strange reaction considering the secondary is being done at $6.60 with a significant portion of the
cash going to insiders. When do you expect to start seeing the sell off and how low do you expect it to go? Thanks.


11 Sep 2013, 12:43 PM

Interesting that NEON is up 5% so far today on triple the volume after investors digested this "dire news".


Having been a small public company "insider" twice before in my previous life, I cannot fault any of them for taking
profits, especially if they are regularly vesting additional shares. It is common fiscal sense, and not abusive in any
way.


The relatively small amount of money they are raising suggests capital needed for production, not for survival. The
relatively small amount the insiders are selling really is a non-event.


I am interested to see what becomes of their possible patent spin-off, or what value that brings to the company. Or for
that matter, the patent revenue itself if there is no spin-off.


Yes, $27 ps seems like a pretty unreasonable number....but so does seeing this stock fall to $4 or less. We all know
it's a volatile stock, and we know the reasons why, and while setting your expectations to see it bounce around the $6
- $8 range, +/- , may be smart, expecting it to EITHER hit $27 OR $3.50 is really NOT.

Richard,


Your arrow for the secondary on your graphic for UNXL is wrong. The arrow points to the last peak above $35,
whereas it should point to the first peak above $35.


The secondary was announced on April 17 (http://bit.ly/14LZB4h) while your arrow points at the price drop that
occurred on May 17 when UNXL opened above $37 and closed at $27.


It is convenient how that "mistaken" wrong timing that your arrow points to supports your thesis of cause and effect
between the secondary and the May 17 drop in price, but in fact they were a month apart.


IMO it would be more meaningful to have that May 17 arrow labeled "Seeking Alpha hit piece" by another drive-by
author (http://bit.ly/1b68kpr).

Hi Richard,


Thanks for featuring me prominently in your article. I thank you for lauding my ability to do due diligence on
investments and piece together information that the company does not disclose on its press releases. I would say that
as with any professional investor such as myself, the ability to go above and beyond what's issued in (usually terse,
for any company) press releases is how you actually make money in the stock market.


Similarly, I'm glad to see that you noted that I have been long the stock since in the high $4s to today, a nice profit
period. I am still Long the stock and will remain so as my thesis has not changed.


Further, consistent with any credible investor, I have laid out my exact estimates, path to targets, and bottoms up
investment model. I show my work and I invite commentary on the operating assumptions. This leads to a target
price, with the levers fully revealed. In contrast however, you merely say the stock should fall "40-60%" over the "next
few months" simply by reading a chart? Not so precise, and not so rigorous.


Nevertheless, I will let the market decide which side is more credible. Many of the points made by commentators
above certainly shed some light on your track record and bias: some flawed calls on shorts that blew up before,
factual misstatements, sleights of hand with the chart data points, and general misreading of normal corporate
activities (capital raises, insider sales) with an eye towards Short bashing.

From the financials, this is a TERRIBLE business. Terrible. Unable to grow revenue, generate earnings or

Author’s reply »  I find it comical to see the criticisms from these pumpers even after their pumps have failed so badly.


Here is what the pumpers do with these stocks (KNDI, ONVO and NEON all fit the same examples)


1. Write hyper bullish articles, predicting an astronomical share price (usually around $20-30 for each of these)


2. The pumpers don't have any expectation that the share price will even come close to these levels. They just want a
rise of 20-30%


3. They make analogies to other (more established) companies which have much larger market caps


4. When the share price rises: the company issues stock, the insiders sell, the pumpers dump.


Examples: 
When I wrote about KNDI, the stock was at just over $7. Art Porcari was pumping it in almost 20 articles, claiming that
it would be a $30 stock. I predicted that an equity offering and a dump were likely. Within days, the company issued a
huge pile of stock and the stock quickly fell to $4.50. It is comical that Porcari is now writing to criticize me here. The
stock is at around $5.25 (20% below where I highlighted it and certainly far below the $30 he was hyping it as)


ONVO was also at around $7 when I wrote about it. Pumpers were calling it a $20-30 stock (some were saying $100).
I noted that the company was overvalued at half a billion (they don't even have a sellable product) and that an equity
offering would be soon. They quickly sold stock and it went to $4.44. Now the pumpers are still pumping it on these
comments...it is at about $5.25...20% below where I highlighted it...and far below the silly pump targets of $20-100.


Now we can see NEON. It is a company that has churned out hundreds of announcements which are identical to the
LG Samsung news. This has resulted in minimal revenues and zero profits since 2009. Yet Tech Guru is telling us that
this identical news will send NEON to $27. Instead the insiders sell a few million shares. They then upsize the deal so
they can sell more (without any additional proceeds to NEON - just for their own pockets). Then they take 100% of the
greenshoe option to sell even more shares (with no proceeds to the company - only their own pockets).


I certainly do not expect pumpers such as Art and Tech to congratulate me on my thorough analysis or on my track
record. The criticism should be expected.

NEON is being manipulated to allow people to occasionally dump. This will become evident within about 2 weeks, just
like the other pumps. This is why is keeps popping but the gains never hold.

SA Author must show full disclosure. What price and how many shares is Mike Pearson short? (Obviously losing
money now)..

Mr Pearson, You state that pumpers write hyper bullish articles predicting astronomical share prices and then
dump when the SP goes up 20-30%. Is it not feasible that shorts write hyper bearish articles and then cover
when the SP drops 20-30%? Could you tell us all if you are short and how many shares? Thanks.

Thanks for this article. I have only recent become familiar with the dark corner of SeekingAlpha known as the micro-
cap pump-and-dump territory. Its quite sickening and quite frankly the SEC should be all over these fake articles that
are just PR hype pieces designed to manipulate the stock. NEON was one on my list of James Altucher's many many
fraud penny stocks. Seems like he makes money off all the people on here buy in at the high and then get absolutely
creamed.


The insider-sale follow-on offer is the height of insult.

Bravo. A voice of reason. Marketing articles to advertise scammer's stocks are unethical and should not be
published on SA.

As you disclosed you are short NEON but yet you title the article "Investors Feel Duped" - being short a stock does
not qualify you as an investor. Accordingly, you cannot speak as an investor or on behalf of other investors as your
interests and ours are diametrically opposed. I am a long term investor and I do not feel duped by management
however; I do feel duped by your article which I believe to be full of misstatements, innuendo and misrepresentations
of the facts. Here is a simple example you state "Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble have discontinued the use of
Neonode products" and even include a link to make your statement appear factual. The reality is this is factually
incorrect and misleading on multiple levels: 1. Neonode doesn't sell products - it is a licensing & design company. 2.
Only Amazon has chosen to stop using Zforce in their e-readers 3. Your link in fact shows that B&N is still a customer.

Your motives are very apparent unfortunately your facts are obscured by your clear anger and open hostility toward
Tech Guru. "Methinks thou dost protest too much"!!

Forget pearson forget tech guru and lets toss out all other opinions and stick with facts not predictions. 
NEON has made well over 30-40 identical announcements claiming deals with major oem's, their product has actually
been used by a few of these major companies, yet NEON has never realized meaningful revenue and they have done
nothing but lose 10's of millions of dollars. 
i am only using what the company is saying. based on the companies performance how can management feel they
should reward themselves by unloading 12 million plus worth of stock for the pitiful performance? neon and this
management team have been doing and saying the same thing for years and the only constant is they lose money
and revenue are anemic. 
nobody needs pearson or tech guru to arrive at the fact NEON is a pump and the stock is virtually worthless. the
definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over then expecting a different result. 
how can anyone arrive at anything different than neon is a pump, insiders are bailing (the chairman thinks so highly of
his stock as an asset that he is paying off a personal loan using stock) even though they are supposed to be a
GROWTH company in the early innings, and the stock is worth little to nothing. 
we all know how this movie ends, can a pumper make a few quick bucks, can a short make a few quick bucks? sure,
but at the end of the day the poor investor's who believe in the integrity of the markets will end up with nothing but a
worthless stock and another lesson they will not learn anything from.


i am short the stock, i wan't the stock to go down. i am certain what i write is not going to make the stock go down and
i don't need it to, the company and management will do all that for me. we can see what happens next quarter no
article will be as telling or accurate as that.

Richard,


As with much of the “analysis” you publish on SA, your Neonode article does nothing more than present
circumstantial evidence for a misguided short thesis. Importantly, you don’t present any evidence to convince readers
of the causality linking the circumstances you cite around the company and your thesis. Many of your “facts” are just
wrong, and your commentary displays a lack of understanding of Neonode’s business as well as its customers’
businesses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1686262-neonode-investors-feel-duped-shares-to-fall-further 26/29


A few examples follow.


You characterize the insider sales in the secondary offering as “unusual” and “abusive.” How so? Insiders who ponied
up cash to finance this company in its early stages had to exercise warrants and were hit with big tax bills. I cannot
understand how selling a small portion of their holdings to cover expected taxes qualifies as either abusive or
unusual.


You cite a “promotional campaign” surrounding Neonode but then fail to explain exactly how this is problematic. Is it
unethical or illegal to announce customer wins and then sell company/insider stock? I think that withholding this
information from the market before a deal would be far more troubling than disclosing the information. Is it unusual for
companies to act in the best interest of shareholders by minimizing dilution and conducting offerings after their share
price increases? It’s not unusual, unethical, or illegal.


Perhaps you’re implying that the announcements are not real? The company has made a number of announcements
in the past and has yet to produce “significant” revenue. If this is your point, you need to do more work to convince
your audience of the merits of your argument. Did Samsung tell you that they don’t know who Neonode is? Did LG tell
you that Neonode’s principal business is manufacturing press releases? We need some real fundamental due
diligence to support your claim if this is your point. Neonode shareholders whose knowledge of the company and its
customers is far superior to yours believe there is a high likelihood that license agreements will translate into revenue
in 2014 and beyond.


You mention that “when an equity offering follows an extended effort to promote the stock, the stock will quickly begin
a substantial decline.” Can you share any large sample-size data to support this claim? Let’s face it, under your
definition of “promotional” just about every publicly traded company on the face of the earth qualifies. I’ve never run
across a company that didn’t press release material client wins/design wins/license agreements. So, by implication, it
sounds like what you’re saying is that every company that raises money in a secondary offering, “will quickly begin a
substantial decline.” Don’t give us anecdotes, provide us with data.


You repeatedly reference the fact that Neonode has made many design win and license announcements over the
years with little resulting revenue. You then make the leap to assume that there is little or no connection between
customer agreements and future revenue. It’s understandable that someone who hasn’t done any real due diligence
on the name would come to this conclusion. Most investors in NEON, however, are aware that the company only
began marketing the sensor outside of the e-reader market when they signed with Texas Instruments in May of 2012.
They also realize that not only is the average customer design cycle 12-18 months, but there’s frequently a period of
product testing that can last several months as well. When you factor in seasonal product rollout schedules more time
is often tacked on to the schedule. So, agreements from 2012 will start to drive revenue next year. The company is
recognizing revenue from the e-reader market currently, but those designs aren’t of significant volume.


You display a fundamental ignorance around Neonode’s sensors when you claim that capacitive sensors are “lighter,
thinner and more responsive” than Neonode’s “functionally obsolete” optical solution. Capacitive sensors may be
slightly lighter and thinner than Neonode’s sensor, but they’re not faster or more responsive. Comparisons around
responsiveness are more a function of controller design and firmware integration than hardware. Neonode’s sensors
use light as their input, after all, and light travels fast. The bezel that comes with Neonode’s solution is the only
meaningful drawback, but that’s an issue that may be resolved before long. It’s also an issue that’s restricted to high-
end handsets and tablets.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1686262-neonode-investors-feel-duped-shares-to-fall-further 27/29


You state that Neonode’s sensor is, “encountering a functional and competitive disadvantage” and that it, “will end up
serving markets which have a less demanding set of requirements and which are willing to compromise quality in
exchange for a rock bottom, commodity price.” Did you check with the auto OEM’s as to their requirements? It turns
out they have some of the most demanding requirements in all of touch, and Neonode is set to dominate that market.
Did you check with top tier PC manufacturers who are hungry for Neonode’s sensor? What do they think about
Neonode’s functional disadvantages? The fact is that these PC manufacturers are lining up to work with Neonode
because they’re desperate for a functional, inexpensive, commercially scalable solution and Neonode may own the
best technology to provide it today. ITO can’t do it. Metal mesh is still working to get there. Neonode has 15mn units in
the market already with zero reported defects.


With regard to Neonode’s one dollar touch sensor you claim, “Once again, it is clear that as the price continues to fall,
Neonode's ability to generate meaningful revenue falls even further - even at huge Kindle-like volumes which might
be realized from a Samsung or LG.” Your conclusion only serves to highlight how little you know about Neonode’s
business model and its business.


Neonode benefits from the work its customers do to lower the BOM for its solution. This is part of the appeal of the
licensing model – it aligns Neonode’s interests with those of its customers. Neonode will take the same unit royalty
whether the customer achieves a BOM of $3 or $1, but NEON benefits from a lower BOM as it will translate into lower
consumer prices and higher volumes. Further, you characterize Kindle volumes as “huge” when, in fact, they were
not. Kindle revenues were never all that big because Neonode’s Kindle volumes were only in the few million unit
range. Neonode hopes to break into a number of markets that would generate much larger unit volumes – such as
handsets, laptops and PCs.


Shareholder’s don’t feel duped, Richard. If anyone has been duped, it is you. Likewise, if anyone is trying to promote
their cause with dubious claims you have taken that prize as well. Shareholders are pleased that the offering went
smoothly and was five times oversubscribed (although many are unhappy at not getting more stock on the deal). They
are happy that the company has some room on its balance sheet and that the overhang associated with this deal has
been removed. Shareholders are cautiously optimistic about the potential for Neonode and they don’t think much of
your “analysis”, and that is why the stock is approaching all-time highs.

Nice comment!!


Liked it better than the article. The author claims we'll see in two weeks that NEON is a sham. Bet instead of
that he disappears from view for awhile. He is right about one thing, many authors on SA DO HAVE a hidden
agenda. Buyer (and reader) beware!!!


16 Sep 2013, 12:46 PM

Where does the author come up with the slow speed (long latency after touching)? Neon's IR technology is
considerably faster than the best capacitance touch solution...2.5-10 times faster. If there is long latency, it is
unrelated to Neon's solution.

Let's look at the material news for NEON since your obviously well researched article came out that led you to
conclude "it is likely that we will see Neonode decline by around 40-60% from current levels within the next few
weeks".

Yes, the PPS has fluctuated back and forth about 15%, as expected on news and various market forces. But this does
not look the news feed of a stock I want to even think about shorting...I think it's time to admit you were way off on this
one to save a little credibility for any future articles.

You really might want to cite some facts if you want to be taken seriously.


And also let Samsung, Electrolux, LG, Lierda, Yanfeng Visteon, Leapfrog, Fidelity, Sony, Volvo, Shenzhen
Wave, Alpine, Texas Instruments, a couple of tier one PC makers, a couple of tier one auto manufacturers
and a few other odd companies that they are likely to be named in a shareholder lawsuit for perpetuating and
aiding and abetting a stock scam, as you so put it. I'm sure they would like to know....So would the SEC, you
should contact them as well.

Mr. Pearson, How is that 40-60% decrease in SP in 2-3 weeks working out for you? It would seem that your credibility
is now at stake here, not NEON's.
