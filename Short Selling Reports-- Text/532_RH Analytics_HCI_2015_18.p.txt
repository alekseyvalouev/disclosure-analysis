More Pressure For The HCI Group: Everybody Hates Takeouts

Summary


Recent media reports suggest that the takeout business model may be pressured
further going forward.


There is a legislative movement afoot to curtail the takeout process, which has been
characterized as misleading and unfair to consumers.


Consumers are increasingly wary of takeouts as evidenced by a soaring opt-out rate
- over 50% of consumers are rejecting takeout offers, opting to remain with Citizens.


Two recent articles raise further doubts regarding the longevity of the takeout business
model for Florida insurers, such as the HCI Group (NYSE:HCI). There is a movement in
the Florida legislature to curtail takeouts. Additionally, recent statistics indicate that
consumer rejection rates for takeout offers are skyrocketing.


Florida lawmakers square off over downsizing Citizens Insurance discusses a bill currently
working through the Florida legislature. The purpose of it is to curtail Citizens's ability to
depopulate. The bill would require uniform takeout notices to increase clarity and would
outright ban automatic takeouts. The bill's sponsor said many aspects of the process are
"tricky, deceptive, misleading and unfair".


The article also notes that many Florida lawmakers believe that Governor Scott's support
of takeouts is a "payback for campaign contributions". While we would agree that the
takeout process is highly politicized and at times appears to have a quid pro quo element,
we suspect the Governor's office is not the only beneficiary.


A short but interesting article in a Florida real estate trade publication points out recent
changes in takeout statistics. The article notes that the opt-out rate, or the rate at which
consumers reject takeouts to remain with Citizens, has increased dramatically over the
last year. In 2014, approximately 30% of consumers subject to a takeout offer opted to
remain with Citizens. In 2015, that figure has increased to over 50%.


In past research, we have noted that takeouts are becoming increasingly difficult due to
the shrinking policy pool at Citizens. In an attempt to keep the subsidized earnings
coming, HCI doubled down on its bet and began taking out wind-only policies. At a recent

rate hearing, Citizens executives noted that rates for wind-only policies are inadequate.
We would add that this rate inadequacy makes the policies unprofitable even in the
current very low reinsurance rate environment.


In the current environment, it appears that not only is Citizens's pool shrinking, but there
are other forces that are poised to make state subsidies harder to come by. Some
elements of Florida's political bodies appear to be aware of at least some of the flaws of
the process as it currently implemented; and we consider a rejection rate at above 50% to
be indicative of a consumer base actively rebelling against the takeout process.


In our view, takeout companies could face pressure from multiple sides - a shrinking pool
from which to select, legislative efforts to curtail takeouts, and a remaining consumer base
that aggressively avoids takeout companies. Near-term, these trends do not bode well for
takeout companies, such as HCI and Heritage (NYSE:HRTG). However, they are
particularly ominous for HCI, which is entirely dependent on assumptions from Citizens for
growth.


Longer-term, should Citizens reverse course and begin to grow again, the impact may
extend beyond the direct insurance market and into the reinsurance market, including
carriers such as Renaissance Re (NYSE:RNR), Validus Holdings (NYSE:VR), and Everest
Re (NYSE:RE).

Point 1:


the Republican Governor in Florida is NOT likely to pass any restrictions on Citizens take-out program that would add
greater risk of liability to Floridians. As the governor himself has stated:


"(Citizens) should be the insurance company of last resort," Scott said. "I'll do everything I can to make sure they keep
doing that."

Flip-flop? Not likely. Wishful thinking on the part of Democratic State House Reps.


Point 2:


Citizen's does NOT want to be in the "risk insurance" business. It was created to provide Floridians with insurance
only as the "insurer of last resort." Citizens is mandated to reduce its libability risk to taxpayers through the "take-out"
program. Citizens IS also required to notify homeowners by mail that their insurance policy with Citizens has been
selected to be returned to a private insurer through the "take-out" program; which they may opt out of.


Citizens bylaws specifically state:


"Florida law requires Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens) to create programs to help return Citizens
policies to the private market and reduce the risk of additional assessments for all Floridians. The Depopulation
program accomplishes this goal by working with private-market insurance companies that would like to offer coverage
to Citizens policyholders. The programs are subject to the approval of the Office of Insurance Regulation.


Policyholders whose policies are selected by these companies are sent a letter notifying them of the pending
assumption and providing instructions on how they can elect (opt out) to remain with Citizens, if eligible and should
they wish to do so. Policyholders who do not opt out within the opt out timeframe will receive a Notice of Assumption
and Non Renewal and a Certificate of Assumption. They may have an additional timeframe from receipt of this notice
to elect to remain with Citizens.


We encourage policyholders who receive private-market offers to consider them carefully and discuss the advantages
of such coverage with their agents. Accepting an offer from a private insurer will decrease a Citizens policyholder's
potential assessment. For additional information about assessments, policyholders should refer to the
Acknowledgement of Potential Surcharge and Assessment Liability notice provided with their renewal or visit our
Assessments page."

I live in Dade County - when you see what Citizens & the other insurers don't cover - you seriously begin to wonder if
it is worth it to carry insurance. Thus far I continue to have Citizens, but have HUGE doubts about its value.

Yet another "sky is falling" piece about HCI...up 10% today...plenty of others disagree.


Good points though, Alfred.

Sir Falstaff
Bluegrass, where you at homeslice? I'm still waiting for a list of your long holdings for more short ideas.
Please send it over at your earliest convenience.


Btw, thanks for the bling bling $$ cash money.

Change the 17B Ft. Lauderdale storm to 50B (as Karen Clark suggests in her 2012 journal article, and as noted and
ignored by the CFO) and let's see if we feel better or worse about the Florida Carriers. It is no wonder UVE dropped
10% on "no news", and the whole industry became vulnerable to a short attack. The sky isn't in the process of falling,
it already did. A hurricane does not have to occur to realize risk is underpriced and for your stock to tank. It is now
proven. For HCI, the wizards of Tampa, wandering into Flood policies, who have 51B against 183M in equity, and
Patel has taken how much money out? And their loss ratios are what? I would be jumping for joy that the stock is
down only 10 % (and flat since your article Alfred). Take a spreadsheet and run the Tampa storm at 10B vs. 6.5B like
Clark demonstrates. All she did was invent the programs. What is the margin of safety against a short attack Alfred?
The market cap is only 433M. They took that amount off of UVE in virtually one day. Good luck!

Beautiful Insprof manipulate the facts and numbers to your own thesis, article is very clear, are you a politician in your
spare time?

I can't read your links. I did read the actual report off of Florida OIR's website. I have no position in this stock. This
debate has been going on for months with RH and Alfred and Bluegrass and me. I want to see Florida Insurers
succeed. But when I point people to original sources, I get a personal attack. The people behind this massive short
are smart enough to read what Clark is saying. And see the flaws in the methodology of the stress test.

Alfred, Bluegrass, and Walie: it's been while, how's the HCI long going? Fresh 52-week lows today. Hope you're
taking advantage of this and averaging down.
