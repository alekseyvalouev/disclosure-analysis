GeoInvesting Responds To Bronte Capital On AmTrust
Dec. 16, 2013 10:00 AM ET88 comments
by: The GeoTeam


After our initial report on AmTrust Capital (NASDAQ:AFSI), "Amtrust Financial Servies:
A House of Cards?", Bronte Capital ("Bronte") criticized the report as a "hit-piece" with
"howling error after howling error". We stand by our report and appreciate the opportunity
to provide additional clarity.


Readers should know that we attempted to reach out to AFSI prior to our report both by
phone and email to ask questions and received no response. In contrast, Bronte, who
"once respected our work", did not provide us the same courtesy before criticizing our
report and suggesting AFSI is "the perfect candidate for a 'short squeeze'". Constructive
criticism is welcome, but warnings of a "short squeeze" because short sellers "do not
understand what they are short" are misguided.


We detail below why we disagree with Bronte's contention that our report contained errors
and provide additional details so that readers can better understand what is most certainly
complex accounting. We believe Bronte's post criticizing our report misses several key
points in our report and that Mr. Hempton's subsequent comment about ceded premiums
(earned) and ceded losses (incurred) actually implies that he agrees with our approach.
We believe Bronte may revise its view after re-reading our initial report along with the
clarification we provide below.


Reinsurance Accounting


Bronte criticized our report for making "accusations of reinsurance accounting fraud by
someone who does not understand what is meant by 'ceded losses'". The crux of Bronte's
criticism appears to be the following:


"Geoinvesting has simply added up the "losses ceded" to the (internal) reinsurers
and wondered why the "losses" did not wind up in the P&L."


Response #1 re: ACHL


Bronte seems to be saying that we are confusing the "Ceded Incurred Loss & LAE" (the
provision / expense in the income statement) with net losses (revenues less expenses
such as loss expense incurred), implying that we ignored premiums ceded. This would

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1900381-geoinvesting-responds-to-bronte-capital-on-amtrust 2/40


seem to be confirmed by the comment Mr. Hempton made within the comment stream
(December 15, 2013 at 5:13 PM) of Bronte's blog:


"Its (sic) relatively simple: when you cede the loss you cede the associated
premium".


Bronte appears not to have read our report very carefully because this was effectively
our criticism of AFSI ‒ losses were ceded (from AII Bermuda to ACHL Luxembourg)
without ceding any associated premiums. In such a scenario ceded losses should
approximate the net loss (assuming zero ceding commissions).


We refer you to the section of our report titled "Proof That ACHL Received Zero
Premiums", which we have excerpted below for the readers' convenience.

premiums ceded for 2009/2010, which we show below.

Finally, "Premiums Ceded" relate to Maiden Holdings (NASDAQ:MHLD) and not
another entity, as evidenced by AII Bermuda's Reinsurance Footnote which we

Bronte's "explanation", which was inset like a quote from Wikipedia, despite our inability to
find that passage on the Wikipedia link provided by Bronte, said:


"When an insurance policy is written the insurance company "writer" will recognize
as an asset the premium received. They will also recognize a "loss reserve" an
amount being the amount they will expect to pay out on the policy over time.


This "loss reserve" is not a loss. Its (sic) simply a reserve for future payments.
Whether the policy makes a profit or loss will be determined as the decades roll on.
[If it is a workers (sic) compensation policy for instance an insurer may be paying an
injured worker's medical bills thirty years hence...]


In a typical (and in this case proportional) reinsurance arrangement, a reinsurer
takes a stated percentage share of each policy that an insurer produces "writes".
This means that the reinsurer will receive that stated percentage of the premiums
and will pay the same percentage of claims. In an accounting sense this is called
"ceding the loss" and "ceding the premium" to the reinsurer. The reinsurer also
recognizes no loss in the P&L. The gain or loss of the policy is recognized over
decades.


In addition, the reinsurer will allow a "ceding commission" to the insurer to cover the
costs incurred by the insurer (marketing, underwriting, claims etc.)."


We found this explanation is rather convoluted and mixes balance sheet items with
income statement items. Please see the appendix for a detailed walk through of the
accounting entries one should expect an insurance company to make and how these
arrangements affect the income statement.


Here's what we think Bronte meant to say:



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Responds To Bronte Capital On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1900381-geoinvesting-responds-to-bronte-capital-on-amtrust 5/40


When an insurance policy is written, the insurance company "writer" will recognize
an asset on the balance sheet (cash or premium receivable). They will also
recognize a liability for "unearned premiums" on the balance sheet as well (think
deferred revenue). Over the term of the policy, the unearned premiums will be
earned through the income statement as revenue.


As the premium is earned, the company will recognize the incurred loss and loss
adjustment expense (provision) which goes to build the loss and loss adjustment
reserve (a liability for estimated future claim payments). As the decades roll-on, the
company will recognize increases (decreases) in the estimate of claim payments for
previously earned policies as adverse (positive) development which is added to
(subtracted from) the loss provision for newly issued policies.


It is unclear what the exact nature of the reinsurance agreement between ACHL and AII
is, but it's clearly not proportional (because AII has more premiums than loss provisions
while ACHL is the opposite as evidenced in AII's financial statements).


The financial statements showed that AII did not cede any premiums earned (or written) to
ACHL in 2010, so ACHL will not recognize any "assumed premiums earned" on its income
statement. However, we also showed that AII did cede ACHL's $62.1 million of losses, so
ACHL should recognize $62.1 million of "assumed loss and loss adjustment incurred". As
such, we would expect ACHL to report a net loss of $62.1 million for 2010. (net loss = $
zero assumed premium earned minus ceded losses incurred of $62.1 million).


Since ACHL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AII, we believe these transactions should be
unwound upon consolidation when preparing AII's financial statements. However, AII uses
the equity method to prepare the AII 2010 financial statements, so that is not the case.
Below is an excerpt from BDO's Independent Auditor's Report from AFSI's 2010 10-K
(emphasis added):


"As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company (AII) accounts for
its investment in AmTrust International Underwriters ("AIUL"), AmTrust Europe, Ltd.
("AEL"), AmTrust Captive Holdings Limited ("ACHL") and AmTrust Insurance
International Management ("AIIM"), wholly-owned subsidiaries, on the equity method
of accounting. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America require that all majority-owned subsidiaries be accounted for using
the full consolidation method."


Life Settlements
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Responds To Bronte Capital On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1900381-geoinvesting-responds-to-bronte-capital-on-amtrust 6/40


Bronte Capital appeared to criticize our report 's content regarding life settlements relating
to (1) life expectancies (LEs), (2) the discount rate, and (3) Phoenix-issued policies.
Below, we will counter those criticisms in detail.


First, we thought it would be helpful to discuss life settlements generally. Bronte said
"Surely some of them have died. So far they have not had any trouble collecting - the idea
that these policies should be held by AmTrust at pennies on the dollar is ludicrous."


The question is not whether AFSI has collected on mortality events to-date (it has). When
the underlying insured dies early, the life settlement investor gets a windfall. That doesn't
mean that the remaining policies are worth much (or anything). The real question to ask in
evaluating any company's life settlements is:


What is the probability-adjusted PV of the death benefit, net of the probability-
adjusted PV of the premiums the policyholder will have to pay to receive the death
benefit?


As long as the insurance company issuing the policy hopes to make a profit, the answer to
that question should always be less than zero because the insurance company embeds a
margin (think house advantage at a casino). In other words, buying an insurance
policy is a negative NPV proposition. If someone's health deteriorates (gambler gets a
hot hand), that policy becomes more valuable and the policyholder could sell it for
something in excess of the cash surrender value that the issuer would pay.


Now consider a policy issued by an insurance company on a 74 year old person in 2007
(approximately what AFSI owns (see footnote 1). First, the insurance company is still
going to embed a margin to issue the policy. Second, the insurance company is going to
think long and hard about the risk of issuing a policy to a 74 year old because that
person's life expectancy is obviously short. As important, the risk of adverse selection is
incredibly acute. This is in contrast to the more familiar example of a young family buying
a policy on the breadwinner because the risk of losing that person's income would put
them at unacceptable risk. In other words, the young family is much less likely to be
attempting to "pick off" the insurance company.


In addition, an insurance company presented with a wealthy (see footnote 2) 74 year old
is likely going to say:
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Responds To Bronte Capital On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1900381-geoinvesting-responds-to-bronte-capital-on-amtrust 7/40


"What risk are they looking to protect? They're already retired, paid for their kids'
college, and can live comfortably should the insured pass-away. Perhaps, this is a
premium-financed policy. If that's the case, I need to lower my lapse assumption
because investors are much less likely to voluntarily lapse the policy."


Lastly, it's worth noting that AFSI's premium-finance loans almost universally (disclosures
are vague) defaulted. Had there been any adverse developments in the insured's health,
the seemingly wealthy (see footnote 3 insured would use their considerable resources to
pay off the loan and keep the suddenly very valuable policy instead of allowing AFSI to
benefit from the windfall.


Bronte Contention #1: AFSI's LE's seem reasonable


Bronte contends that AFSI's LE assumptions are not "inherently implausibly low" because
the company assumes the average insured will live to an average age of 91. Bronte goes
on to say that the company lengthened the average life expectancy which lowers the
expected value of the policies, and cited the increase in estimated average age at death of
91.0 vs. 90.4.


This statement, along with subsequent comments about life settlements, demonstrates
Bronte's lack of familiarity with the subject.


According to the 2008 VBT table (see footnote 4), if a 77 year old male (female
assumptions in parentheses) with standard life expectancy has an LE of 8.25 (see
footnote 5) (10.39) years. If he (she) lives for two years, his (her) LE is not 6.25 (8.39)
years. It is approximately 7.16 (9.06) years.


Additionally, Bronte appears to have ignored our report's reference to 21st Service's
January 2013 increase in LEs. The 19% increase in average Les (see footnote 6) as the
most commonly used LE provider caused waves throughout the life settlement industry.
The 19% average increase likely understates the impact to AFSI because adjustments
for anti-selection related to premium-financed policies, which comprise the vast majority of
AFSI's policies, were even greater (see footnote 7).

Bronte Contention #2: 7% Doesn't Seem Unreasonable


Without substantiation, Bronte says 7% (it's actually 7.5%) "doesn't seem unreasonable".
However, ASC 820 (Fair Value) requires the use of market-based measurement (see
footnote 8) (see below) which, based on peer disclosures, appears to be closer to 20%.


"820-10-05-1B Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or
market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable
market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the
objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same-to estimate the
price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would
take place between market participants at the measurement date under current
market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the
perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability)."


As discussed in our report, Ernst & Young disagreed with EEA Life Settlement Fund's
valuation of LSC because they used a 10% discount rate (after adjustments to improve
the accuracy of other inputs):


"The discount rate of 10% in the "full credibility" value is, in our view, significantly
lower than would be used by market participants in an arm's-length transaction".


The report also noted IFT and ALSO's market-based discount rates were approximately
20% and included the table below to demonstrate:

Bronte Contention #3: "Phoenix Looks Like It Will Survive"


Bronte also countered our concerns about AFSI's Phoenix-issued policies by stating that
Phoenix "looks like it will survive". As proof, Bronte said the "regulator is even allowing the
insurance company to pay almost (sic) 30 million in dividends to the parent company" and
cited a press release noting PLIC paid a dividend to the holding company.


Here is where we differ from Bronte:


1. Bronte Is Looking At The Wrong Phoenix Subsidiary (see footnote 9)


The dividends allowed were from Phoenix's principal operating subsidiary, Phoenix Life
Insurance Company (PLIC). However, AFSI's policies were issued by another subsidiary -
PHL Variable, which is why PHL was named in the Tiger Capital lawsuit. In the interest of
brevity, we referred to Phoenix (NYSE:PNX) in our initial report because even PLIC-issued
policies also trade at substantial discounts. However, if Bronte still disagrees with us,
Fortress would probably be ecstatic to sell them PLIC (or PHL Variable) policies at a 10%
discount rate (according to Bronte, a bargain).


2. Bronte Is Uncharacteristically Cavalier In Its View Of Phoenix


It's almost hard to imagine the Bronte we thought we knew points to (1) the wrong
subsidiary and (2) the action of regulators regarding a sister company as
confirmation that PHL Variable issued policies are money-good. Regulators do their best,
but they are not all-knowing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1900381-geoinvesting-responds-to-bronte-capital-on-amtrust 10/40


We won't claim perfect foresight with regard to Phoenix and do not have a view on the
adequacy of their reserves (life insurers are even harder than P&C). However, we know
that PHL Variable has $62.8 billion and $14.0 billion of gross and net life insurance,
respectively, in-force (whole life and term) as of December 31, 2012. In addition, PHL has
$1.6 billion of annuities subject to guarantees -- an area many life insurers have been
desperate to sell because of the severe risks. Against these incredibly large risks, PHL
has merely $272 million of capital. That's not an entity to which we would pay
premiums for the next 12 years in the hope that we realize a 7.5% IRR...


For the edification of readers, the typical state guarantee fund is capped at $300,000 of
policyholder benefits. That means that AFSI might pay premiums for twelve years only to
receive ~5% ($300k / $6.7m average face value) of what they expected for a death benefit
after having paid premiums far greater (admittedly the worst case scenario).


3. Bronte Ignored Non-Bankruptcy Risks


The Fortress complaint cited in the report noted "anti-competitive and exclusionary
conduct" has "destroyed the value of Phoenix policies and robbed policyholders of the
once-precious ability to sell their policies in a competitive market." This quote
demonstrates that Phoenix (PLIC or PHL Variable) policies are disdained by market
participants not just for the risk of insolvency but also for Phoenix's predilection for
aggressive tactics towards life settlement investors.


This is evidenced by the fact that Tiger Capital sued PHL Variable for significantly
increasing the cost of insurance (COI). Our original report linked to a copy of the
complaint. An increase in the COI means AFSI will pay higher premiums without the
potential for any increase in the death benefit. In other words, Phoenix lowered the value
of AFSI's policies.


Additionally, Phoenix has been willing to fight paying death benefits in a myriad of
circumstances and contest the insurable interest of various parties well beyond the
standard two year contestability period -- often with success.


As such, owners of Phoenix-issued policies are likely to pay higher premiums than initially
expected, face higher litigation costs and uncertainty of outcomes even when the things
go their way, and face the risk of getting paid less than expected due to insolvency risk at
PHL Variable.

We appreciate a healthy debate and open discourse on investment ideas. As such, we will
let the analysis presented herein speak for itself and merely say we respectfully disagree
with Bronte's view.


With regard to ACHL, we stand by and reassert that AFSI (via AII) appears to be ceding
losses without ceding any associated premiums to a wholly-owned subsidiary (ACHL) and
that those transactions do not appear to be properly unwound upon consolidation.


On the subject of life settlements, we continue to question the company's valuation. In
particular:


1. AFSI's discount rate of 7.5% appears too low based on peers' comments about market
transactions,


2. AFSI's LEs are oddly falling while peers' LEs are rising -- in large part because the top
provider recently increased LEs by 19% on average, and


3. AFSI's significant exposure to Phoenix (PHL Variable) policies would seem to deserve
a marked discount as a result of the greater risk associated and market participant
comments about arm's-length transactions in Phoenix policies (or, more accurately, the
lack of buyers).


Footnotes:


1. Per court filings, the policies were all issued in 2006 and 2007 - the height of premium-
financed STOLI policies.


2. Insurable interest laws require the buyer of an insurance policy have an interest in the
insured at least as great as the death benefit.


3. We say "seemingly wealthy" because premium-financed policies are fraught with fraud
like over-stating the insured's wealth in order to get larger face value policies.


4. Preferred Valuation Basic Table Team
5. Linear interpolation used for partial years
6. Ie: 75 year old expected to live 11 years is now expected to live ~13 years.
7. Discussion starts at 6:15 of 21st Services Presentation.
8. Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure


Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, Financial Accounting Standards Board of the
Financial Accounting Foundation, May 2011, Page 191


9. In the interest of brevity, we simplified the original report by referring to Phoenix
policies generally because LSC issued by either entity face significant haircuts in the
market for the reasons discussed in this note.

Appendix: Reinsurance Accounting


Part 1: An empirical example of reinsurance accounting


We can look at AII's other reinsurer, MHLD to see how it should work.


First, we can look at MHLD's 2010 10K to see what the reinsurer recognized as earned
premiums and incurred losses related to the AFSI Quota Share.


Then, we can look at AII's disclosure for the MHLD Quota Share in AII's 2010 Financial
Statements. We see that AII ceded $441.3 million of earned premium and $295.5 million
of incurred loss and loss adjustment expense which approximates MHLD's disclosed net
premiums earned and incurred loss and loss adjustment expense.


Note that $441.3 million of premium earned matches the other reinsurance footnote -- the
one that we use to show that ACHL receives zero premiums.

Also note that the "Ceded Incurred Loss and LAE" of $296.1 million ceded to non-affiliates
very closely approximates the MHLD reinsurance footnote (minor variance which is par for
the course on AFSI filings).

I am not a shareholder of Amtrust and I think everyone is having trouble following the arguments (unless the readers

I'm certainly having trouble. AmTrust reports an effective discount rate EDR on the LSCs of 14+% and a
discount rate used in the valuation (of the policies that aren't carried at 0) of 7.5%. Can someone differentiate
between the two for me? Is the EDR just the expected annual rate of return?


I'm definitely going to be listening to the CC.

Here is CFO Ron Pipoly from the 1Q13 conference call:


"Additionally, there is different confusion in the marketplace surrounding our life settlement portfolio. I would
like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain how we account for and how we value our life settlement
portfolio. We utilized a very conservative approach in determining the fair value of the portfolio. There are
many factors that go into determining the value of the portfolio and that seemed to be a discount rate.


"To be clear, our effective discount rate on our life settlement portfolio for 2012 is 17.7%. If you are to
reference our 2012 10-K, you would note that we disclosed a discount rate of 7.5% and an internal rate of
return of 17.7%. That internal rate of return is our effective discount rate on our life settlement portfolio. To
illustrate, the total future positive cash flows – positive cash flows in our life settlement portfolio are expected
to be $795 million. Those cash flows are reduced by adding additional reserves that we apply. Among those
reserves, there is a life expectancy reserve. Life expectancies are updated every year by two of the most
viably recognized life expectancy providers and weighted to the more conservative of the two life
expectancies. Additionally, we provided mortality adjustment reserve by reducing a mortality table based on
the assumption that higher net worth individuals will live longer based on access to better healthcare.

"We also provide additional reserve for future expenses, operational risk and a reserve for highly impaired
lives. For 2012, the total of those reserves was $356 million. That gives us future positive net cash flows of
$439 million. That $439 million is then discounted by 7.5% resulting in our December 31, 2012 carrying value
of $193 million and an effective discount rate of 17.7%. On both the quarterly and annual basis, our
evaluations are reviewed by nationally recognized like actuarial firm. If we were to simply use the discount
rate of 7.5% applied to the expected positive future cash flows of $790 million – $795 million, the carrying
value of our portfolio would have been $383 million as opposed to the $193 million, which we actually carried
at December 31, 2012.


"To-date, we have had four mortality events and have collected benefit on all four of those policies. The total
benefit collected was $24.5 million. Those four policies were purchased for $1.3 million and we paid a total of
$400,000 of premium. We carry those policies at a value of $5.2 million. Those four policies generated a cash
gain of $22.8 million. We reported these assets when the market for these assets was very distressed, and
that philosophy is consistent with being contrary and buying half cheaply that produced very high returns over
the long-term with very little capital at risk. To summarize, what is referred to as our internal rate of return and
our 10-K of 17.7% is our effective discount rate on our life settlement portfolio."


 
So Amtrust reserves for various risks in the portfolio - life expectancy and mortality, future expenses,
operation risk, highly impaired lives - and only applies the 7.5% discount rate after deducting the reserves
from expected cash flows. This approach seems reasonable to me, but I would like to know what is standard
in the industry. I've never seen any short seller directly address these comments. However, it would seem
crazy to me to reserve and then apply a high teens or 20% discount rate. Seems like double counting risk, but
I don't know the industry well enough to know.


The issue of whether the life expectations are too low is another matter separate from the discount rate. I am
in a poor position to judge.


The thing that worries me about life settlements is counterparty and litigation risk with Phoenix. I note that
Pipoly didn't mention that among his reserves (maybe that's what he meant by "operational risk"?) or address
it directly. There is a general reference about creditworthiness of the policy issuer in the 10K. John Hempton
isn't worried about it, but many others claiming industry familiarity think Phoenix life settlements are close to
worthless. Amtrust hasn't addressed the issue yet, but I should hope they will on the call today.

you can check the filings referenced in the chart for how other guys do it. They attach similar haircuts used by
AFSI, and still discount. IFT's 10-Q describes similar adjustments for LE and premiums paid, and they still use
a much higher discount rate. it's also notable how much better their disclosure is than AFSI.


16 Dec 2013, 08:07 PM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
I just checked IFT's latest 10-Q and found the following regarding the valuation of life settlements:


Investment in life settlements — The Company has elected to account for the life settlement policies it
acquires using the fair value method. Due to the inactive market for life settlements, the Company uses a
present value technique to estimate the fair value of our investments in life settlements, which is a Level 3 fair
value measurement as the significant inputs are unobservable and require significant management judgment
or estimation. The Company currently uses a probabilistic method of valuing life insurance policies, which we
believe to be the preferred valuation method in the industry. The most significant assumptions are the
estimates of life expectancy of the insured and the discount rate. 
In determining the life expectancy estimate, we analyze medical reviews from independent secondary market
life expectancy providers (each a “LE provider”). An LE provider reviews the medical records and identifies all
medical conditions it feels are relevant to the life expectancy of the insured. Debits and credits are then
assigned by each LE provider to the individual’s health based on identified medical conditions. The debit or
credit that an LE provider assigns to a medical condition is derived from the experience of mortality attributed
to this condition in the portfolio of lives that the LE provider monitors. The health of the insured is summarized
by the LE provider into a life assessment of the individual’s life expectancy expressed both in terms of months
and in mortality factor. 
The resulting mortality factor represents an indication as to the degree to which the given life can be
considered more or less impaired than a standard life having similar characteristics (e.g. gender, age,
smoking, etc.). For example, a standard insured (the average life for the given mortality table) would carry a
mortality rating of 100%. A similar but impaired life bearing a mortality rating of 200% would be considered to
have twice the chance of dying earlier than the standard life. The probability of mortality for an insured is then
calculated by applying the blended life expectancy estimate to a mortality table. The mortality table is created
based on the rates of death among groups categorized by gender, age, and smoking status. By measuring
how many deaths occur during each year, the table allows for a calculation of the probability of death in a
given year for each category of insured people. The probability of mortality for an insured is found by applying
the mortality rating from the life expectancy assessment to the probability found in the actuarial table for the
insured’s age, sex and smoking status. The Company has historically applied an actuarial table developed by
a third party. However, beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2012, the Company transitioned to a
table developed by the U.S. Society of Actuaries known as the 2008 Valuation Basic Table, or the 2008 VBT.
However, because the 2008 VBT table does not account for anticipated improvements in mortality in the
insured population, the table was modified by outside consultants to reflect these expected mortality
improvements. The Company believes that the change in mortality table does not materially impact the
valuation of its life insurance policies and that its adoption of a modified 2008 VBT table is consistent with
modified tables used by market participants and third party medical underwriters.

The mortality rating is used to create a series of best estimate probabilistic cash flows. This probability
represents a mathematical curve known as a mortality curve. This curve is then used to generate a series of
expected cash flows over the remaining expected lifespan of the insured and the corresponding policy. A
discounted present value calculation is then used to determine the value of the policy. If the insured dies
earlier than expected, the return will be higher than if the insured dies when expected or later than expected. 
The calculation allows for the possibility that if the insured dies earlier than expected, the premiums needed to
keep the policy in force will not have to be paid. Conversely, the calculation also considers the possibility that
if the insured lives longer than expected, more premium payments will be necessary. Based on these
considerations, each possible outcome is assigned a probability and the range of possible outcomes is then
used to create a value for the policy. 
Historically, the Company has procured the majority of its life expectancy reports from two life expectancy
report providers and only used AVS Underwriting LLC (“AVS”) life expectancy reports for valuation purposes.
Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2012, the Company began utilizing life expectancy reports
from 21st Services, LLC (“21st Services”) for valuation purposes and began averaging or “blending,” the
results of the two life expectancy reports to establish a composite mortality factor. 
On January 22, 2013, 21st Services announced revisions to its underwriting methodology and on February 4,
2013, announced that it was correcting errors discovered in its previously announced revised methodology.
According to 21st Services, these revisions have generally been understood to lengthen the average reported
life expectancy furnished by this life expectancy provider by 19%. To account for the impact of the revisions
and based off of market responses to the methodology change, the Company initially lengthened the life
expectancies furnished by 21st Services by 13% prior to blending them with the life expectancy reports
furnished by AVS. Since that time, the Company has received a significant amount of life expectancy reports
from 21st Services that utilize its revised methodology and has, based on the results of those reports,
lengthened the life expectancies on the remaining policies in its portfolio. 
As of September 30, 2013, the Company received 175 updated life expectancy reports from 21st Services
that utilize its revised methodology. These life expectancies reported an average lengthening of life
expectancies of 15.43% and, based on this sample, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the
Company increased the life expectancies furnished by 21st Services by 15.43% on the rest of its portfolio of
life settlements prior to blending them with the life expectancy reports furnished by AVS. The Company
expects


to continue to lengthen life expectancies furnished by 21st Services that have not been re-underwritten using
their updated methodology. Since the Revolving Credit Facility necessitates that the Company procure
updated life expectancies on a periodic basis, the amount of policies that are lengthened by the Company in
this manner will decrease over time and the fair value calculations in future periods will, accordingly, reflect
the actual impact of the revised 21st Services methodology on a policy by policy basis as updated life
expectancy reports are procured. 
Life expectancy sensitivity analysis 
As is the case with most market participants, the Company uses a blend of life expectancies that are provided
by two third-party LE providers. These are estimates of an insured’s remaining years. If all of the insured lives
in the Company’s life settlement portfolio live six months shorter or longer than the life expectancies provided
by these third parties, the change in fair market value as of September 30, 2013 would be as follows (dollars
in thousands):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1900381-geoinvesting-responds-to-bronte-capital-on-amtrust 21/40


Discount rate 
The discount rate incorporates current information about market interest rates, the credit exposure to the
insurance company that issued the life insurance policy and our estimate of the risk premium an investor in
the policy would require. 
Historically, the Company used a 15% — 17% range of discount rates to value its life insurance policies. In
the third quarter of 2011 and in the immediate aftermath of becoming aware of the USAO investigation, the
Company substantially increased the discount rates utilized in its fair value model as it believed that the
USAO Investigation along with certain unfavorable court decisions unrelated to the Company contributed to a
contraction in the marketplace. Since that time, the Company has been re-evaluating its discount rates at the
end of every reporting period in order to reflect the estimated discount rates that could reasonably be used in
a market transaction involving the Company’s portfolio of life insurance policies. In doing so, the Company
relies on management insight, engages third party consultants to corroborate its assessment, engages in
discussions with other market participants and potential financing sources and extrapolates the discount rate
underlying actual sales of policies. 
Although the Company believes that its entry into the Non-Prosecution Agreement had a positive effect on the
market generally and for premium financed life insurance policies specifically, the Company believes that,
when given the choice to invest in a policy that was associated with the Company’s premium finance business
and a similar policy without such an association, all else being equal, an investor would have generally opted
to invest in the policy that was not associated with the Company’s premium finance business. However, since
entering into the Non-Prosecution Agreement, investors have required less of a risk premium to transact in
these policies and the Company expects that, in time, investors will continue to require less of a risk premium
to transact in policies associated with its premium finance business.


 
Where do you see anything about reserves? Unlike AmTrust, IFT doesn't reserve prior to discounting. Instead
they just use a straight discount rate of 15-17%. Their discount rate is equivalent to AmTrust's effective
discount rate EDR which is a little over 14% right now and was over 17% last year, in the same range as IFT.

The other thing about the LSCs is that in geoinvesting's analysis they calling IHT ALSO and the EEA LS fund
peers of AFSI. Nothing could be further from the truth. IHT and ALSO are undercaptalized pure plays on
LSCs while the EEA LS fund is an attempt to make available to the public, direct exposure to LSCs.


All of these firms used as examples have contributed to the market dislocation in LSCs by liquidating LSCs at
fire sale prices. ALSO in fact turned over their portfolio of LSCs to their lender when it became clear that they
were essentially insolvent and could not keep up with the premiums necessary to capture the payoffs. They
do some kind of interactive computer software now. Same ticker.


The idea behind the EEA LS fund is to take an illiquid asset, LSCs, open up shares to the public and be
astonished when there is a bump in the road, (revised mortality tables) and redemptions out paced the ability
to liquidate holdings. They froze the fund for an extended period and just now are attempting to reorganize.

In my cursory reading, Level 3 assets have no real market and sales by desperate companies like those
described above must be taken with a grain of salt. I'm sure that at some point the market for LSCs will be
more orderly and efficient but that also means that some of the opportunity will be gone.


It's quite similar to housing prices in the crash. It was very difficult to arrive at a price. Some people got
burned and some made out.


AFSI seems very well capitalized relative to its LSC investments and stands to achieve great returns on these
purchases.


The litigation referred to seems to be part of the cost of doing business and not all that uncommon when two
parties are playing an essentially zero sum game.

I'm not as attuned to the reinsurance charade, but can say you are well within the realms of understanding on the Life
Settlements issues here. LS valuations of PHL in the secondary and tertiary markets are very low, some would say
worthless. The COI increase issue and Phoenix's ploy of litigating beyond contestability period has most people
running for the hills. 21st's LEs are on their 4th set of extensions? Now to the point 
of lacking credibility amongst many market participants. AFSI's reliance on foreclosed prem finance policies
obliterates the typical arbitrage available to those who properly underwrite LS assets. Fortress is a perfect example of
whats in store for these holdings.  
I see an insider grabbed more shares.....source of funds helps gauge conviction.

looks like there's some typo in the last table on reinsurance accounting, ,as the balance sheet doesnt balance. I'm
guessing it should be 60,30, 6 on the asset side and 75, 15, 6 on the liability + equity side?

What does everyone think of AFSI's call today?


Going into the call here's what I expected: GeoInvesting laid out a rather detailed case for accounting fraud. I
expected management to say: "here's Geo case and their reasoning. This is why its wrong, (whether it's the result of
some international consolidation quirks or some basic misunderstanding of reinsurance) The right way to look at it is
x, and that would get to our GAAP numbers".


If, as Bronte Capital suggested rather dismissively, there is some basic misunderstanding on GI's part, then this
should be really easy right? Instead, I heard nothing but ad hominem attacks on short sellers, and some blanket
statements about how everything is properly consolidated. No Q&A either.

To AFSI management team: The call today in no way addresses GI's case on Lux reinsurance. We deserve a better
explanation.


16 Dec 2013, 06:34 PM


Brian Sanders, Contributor
Mgmt seemed pretty angry and didn't want to address by Geoinvesting by name (probably so they didn't give
them the satisfaction)....and that one article destroyed close to 1/5 of shareholder value. 
But I don't think they gave blanket statements...they directly addressed that they weren't hiding losses and
followed up /w numbers. They stated that the lux insurance market has extensive complexities...which I
presume means Geoinvesting had considerable inaccuracies with their assessment.  
You also have to remember that management of any company will never address short sellers in a
conference call, it's arbitrary in almost any case.


16 Dec 2013, 06:56 PM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
They directly spoke to the Lux reinsurance and specifically said, they cede both premiums and losses to the
reinsurers and consolidate EVERYTHING. They also spoke directly to the LSCs and their explanation made
sense to me. The only thing they didn't address was Saxon and Pipoly's past. I thought it was more than
satisfactory and I can understand why they sounded so pissed off on the call.


16 Dec 2013, 07:58 PM


Michael Spacey, Contributor
so why can't they point out what's wrong with GI's method/logic? Just saying "we did everything right, they're
wrong". That to me is not a rebuttal.

Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
One interesting issue is that GeoInvesting is really talking about a small portion of AFSI's business. 
The amounts that GeoInvesting is talking about is about $400 million. The Life Settlements is really small.
Geoinvesting is not claiming there are any other problems or that these problems are indicative of any other
problems. 
GeoInvesting does not seem convinced themselves, as again, they say it only "appears" that the ceding of
losses is not occuring and that it "appears" the life settlements are overvalued. 
I see little evidence that the life settlements are overvalued and little evidence that the losses are not be
ceded.

They probably didn't address Saxon and Pipoly's past, because GeoInvesting reported nothing on Saxon and
Pipoly's past. Instead, they reported on the past of the CEO of a company that Saxon and Pipoly previously
worked at, where they said the CEO stole money. GeoInvesting did not say that this had anything to do with
Saxon or Pipoly. It is difficult to ascertain what point, if any, Geo Investing was supposedly making.

I don't think AFSI managment needs to school geoinvesting. They specifically denied the allegations and
additionally pointed out the very small part of their portfolio that are LCSs. If it were me, I'd reevaluate my
analysis and find the problems. I'm sure they could retain skilled consultants from a reputable firm versed in
the details of reinsurance and foreign companies and get a contrary opinion if the allegations are true. I'm
pretty sure they don't have those skills in house no matter how assertive they are.


It's not like they discovered the insolvency of Freddie and Fannie or the big short. It's more like they are
conjecturing that something is wrong with AFSI because they can't get things to add up. If they really believe
that management is lying they could take it to the SEC. That would prove their point and cause the stock to
fall, which is their purpose. I don't think they will though because they will be the ones in the hot seat.

Once a company engages in a direct dialog with short seller, there's no end to it. They say short seller is
wrong because... Short seller fires back, no you don't understand because... Or short seller brings up an

Small???? AFSI has $794 million of net tangible assets as of 9/30/13, with premium to that very
approximation of surplus at approximately 3x, the upper bound for a P&C insurer.


$400 million in IDENTIFIED unreported losses would take premium to surplus close to 6x!! Not to mention
throwing into question their profitability and trust. Regulators will require a massive capital raise and the stock
will plummet and downgrades could ensue leading to a death spiral.


I don't know if they improperly consolidated their financials, but if GI is right, all hell is going to break loose on
AFSI.


24 Feb 2014, 05:18 PM


CAInsBroker
Yes they did - Pipoly was the Controller who was alleged to have improperly booked $30 million of reductions
to commission expense to help cover it up. Whether the allegations that he was complicit in the cover up are
true or not doesn't change the fact that the AFSI CFO was the Controller on staff when fraud was committed!!
Incompetence or fraudulent, but you can't escape both. The Chief Operating Officer was the head of claims at
a liquidated insurer...this is your management team??!!!

I am long AFSI, but I think it is foolish to put too much weight on insiders, or anyone else, buying shares. the
issue is the facts and business prospects, not whether somebody is buying or selling shares, in my opinion.

Micro_Cap_Value
Insider buying has long been considered a relevant datapoint with individuals that have a documented track
record of good timing. It doesn't require much explanation, someone sitting on the BOD has far greater
access to detailed corporate information ("facts and prospects") than you or I could ever glean from SEC
filings. We look at all datapoints and have learned that ignoring any new data is done at our own peril.

It doesn't tell you much because if there was malfeasance, they would probably be panicking at its exposure and
wanting to publically express as a strong a position as possible. On the other hand, if the company is 100%
aboveboard and just happens to be needlessly opaque, they would do the same thing.

The Lux. issue is whatever, management added nothing more to the discussion here - the bottom line is that
management's rationale for these acquisitions doesn't make a ton of sense. They earned <$25mm from >$700mm of
acquired assets over 3+ years? Even if they earned substantial tax savings from these deals, I don't see the point.


As for life settlements, they reiterated the same thing. For those having trouble understanding this, here is what they
are saying:


We estimate the net cash flows (i.e. after all expenses, including premium burn etc.) on these policies by guessing
when people will die on average and then discount this by 7.5%. We then take the discount from the gross cash flows
and call it an effective discount rate.


This is not appropriate. This is saying these are equity-like investments in their risk. There is a lot of uncertainty in
these estimates, and thats why other people value these assets by applying a more sizeable discount rate to the NET
cash flows. The fact that they have had some early windfall pay offs says nothing, this will always happen and those
policies will be hugely profitable. The question is how long it takes the portfolio on average to die off, and how long the
outliers stick around. Of course, we won't know this for a very long time. The bottom line is that GAAP requires a
marekt based valuation, and this is not it.


17 Dec 2013, 12:49 PM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
You've got the LSCs wrong completely. They are reserving before they discount because they find it to be a
more accurate method but if you just want a discount rate number to see how conservative they're being
relative to peers look at EDR. ~14% in the most recent quarter and 17% at the end of 2012.


17 Dec 2013, 01:00 PM


recession graduate
It is not a matter of one method being more accurate than another, I'm not sure you're following my reasoning
or actually reading the entire response. Its that the company is using a different, more favorable method than
peers to value these assets.


Life settlement investors typically use the life expectancy estimates prepared by the 2 big data providers for
life settlements (AVS & 21st Services). This is what management said on today's call. They also said,
concurrently, that they take the standard mortality table (i.e. the 2008 VBT) and adjust it for the fact that 'high
net worth individuals live longer'. This fact that LS-eligible (ie >$1mm face value policy) policyholders have
better life expectancy than your avearge person is well known and this is why AVS & 21st Services exist - the
life settlement population does not look like the standard life insurance population, so you need different
mortality tables. So that is a bit confusing as to why management is also making their own estimates on the
side, but lets just assume this to mean that management comes up with their own estimates based on a
slightly more conservative basis of what 21st & AVS give them, i.e. they are assuming that these estimates
are overly aggressive.


The point is not whether they are applying a discount rate on the gross proceeds or the net proceeds. The
point is that what is standard is to apply the MARKET discount rate to the NET proceeds. At a minimum, this
means AFSI should be using more like a 15% discount rate on the NET proceeds of the LS cash flows. Their

'effective' discount rate concept is idiotic, if one wants to use their silly methodology peers are probably using
more like a 30%+ discount rate from gross proceeds.


17 Dec 2013, 06:02 PM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
Peers are discounting gross proceeds, so their EDR is their discount rate. It's not idiotic if the rest of the
crowd is wrong/aggressive. Time will tell but I think when risks and costs can be separated in the valuation of
something, just theoretically, it would indeed seem more accurate than just using one big discount rate based
on an overall observation that is of course subject to bias.


Think of it like this. If you are valuing a company that could go bankrupt what do you think is more accurate-
to determine a probability of default and create two probability-weighted DCFs added together, or just account
for it using one large, arbitrary discount rate? I think the former, but in the case of valuing LSCs, it seems
there's some disagreement.


17 Dec 2013, 07:04 PM


recession graduate
Peers are not using gross proceeds, they just don't report this effective discount rate number as it is not a
standard construct used when discussing life settlement assets. Note that before being criticized on this
management called it an IRR and started only to use 'effective discount rate' after being criticized for this
unusual methodology.


Lets not get too confused by delving into tangential comparisons


AFSI's methodology is non-standard and somewhat opaque (i.e. they have still somehow managed to leave
confusion over who exactly establishes these reserves - this to me is unbelievable). However, the important
point is that AFSI's blended methodology produces an estimate, that when comparable to peers, is MORE
aggressive.


This selection of a non-standard valuation practice would be a minor quibble if they were using an effective
discount rate in the 15-20% range, which I would consider to be fair. The point is that net net, their
methodology ends up being more aggressive than peers, even as management presents it as a more
accurate and more reasonable approach. So the back and forth about who sets the reserves, what
methodology used, etc etc is idiotic when on an apples to apples basis, AFSI is arguing that somehow their
settlements deserve a below market discount rate.


Its just more complicated than it needs to be and obscures the comparability of the figures, or at least it did
before they were forced to be a little more honest about what they are doing. Note that they were probably
reasonably valued at YE, when they were using a 17% discount rate, but then it has again dropped this year
to 14% something, which is probably too high.

http://on.mktw.net/19w...


The only thing you can guarantee when under attack by shorts and lawyers is volatility. Forget the stock and who is
right just buy/sell neutral options spreads that will benefit from the price moving from where it currently is. You could
get unlucky and end up with an expiration at the same price while it whipsaws around but you can mitigate that by
selling the same strategy out at multiple expiration dates creating a calendar spread.


There are no guarantees but this is one way to potentially benefit without having to care who is right or wrong. The
other thing to be careful of is making sure you get the right pricing on your spreads. With AFSI having some large
gaps between bid/ask it would be prudent to make use of a broker that will provide an all/nothing option for
purchasing the spread to make sure that you get a properly balanced spread.

Another Enron in the making? Another company that's a ticking time bomb?


More likely this is just another example of market manipulation. Why?


-Look at what happened with Herbalife (HLF). Some called it a pyramid scheme. The stock crashed. Many benefitted
from the crash, as they had intended. It's only recently come back, and it's never been proven to be anything but a
well run company. It's recovery price is about 3 times the 'crashed' price. The short sellers manipulated the price
down, covered and then walked away. 
-Questcor (QCOR). StreetSweeper ran a "Geo-like" doomsday article on them, shorting a ton of shares and
benefitting from the subsequent panic selling. The shares are now about 3 times what they were when they were
crashed. 
-Tangoe (TNGO). Similar situation there as well, with a healthy recovery from the 'crashed' value.


This is a manipulation racket, and the sad thing is these folks just might be able to get away with it. But some
government agency needs to put a stop to it, the sooner the better for all the honest shareholders who get hurt by this
garbage.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but according to the transcript from Amtrust (where they respond to the allegations),

Hey Gratian, thanks for the reply.  
An acquaintance of mine said that MOST preferred stock dividends are non-cumulative; most of which that
are actually worth investing in. Also AFSI has to pay preferred before common stock shareholders...if they
removed it there would be alot more selling. You also have to remember the company is very profitable and
have plenty of cash for dividends. I don't think there are any fundamental issues; its more like the market is
speculating based on fear derived from 1) a faulty short attack article and 2) an "investigation" on behalf of
shareholders. Very surprised to see the market act this scared, I thought it was efficient lol. 
Anyways, after the next few earnings reports and the investigation blown over, it'll be much higher.  
Right now people are acting uncertain and fleeing this negative momentum type stock. I really just wish I
waited for a better price on the preferred


23 Dec 2013, 09:11 PM

The more I look at the LSC info provided in this article, the stranger it seems. The chart that shows the evolution of life
expectancy are non-sense and quite misleading. The author pulls these number from the respective quarterly/annual
reports and they make a nice picture of LE's increasing in one case and decreasing in the other. However, it fails to
point out that these LE's are for substantially different sets of policies within each company.


Looking at IFT shows that Dec 12 LE was 10.5 and June 13 it was 11.9. What the author fails to point out is that the
total number of contracts was 204 in Dec 12 and 627 in June 13. 422 contracts were acquired with an average age of
77.7 and LE of 12.7. The two data points were from substantially different populations, ie 2/3 of the policies were new
and were on younger people. No wonder the LE went up. Younger people have longer LE's


Looking at AFSI the June 13 data point is 11.25=135 months/12 and the Dec 13 data point is 11.6=139/12. Now the
average age for June 13 is 79.3 and for Dec 12 is 78.8 which puts the average age of death at 90.55 for June 13 and
90.4 for Dec 12.


The author builds the chart that has a pretty simple explanation but misrepresents it. The IFT LEs are increasing due
to a substantial change in the mix of insured. Two thirds of the policies are new. AFSI residual life estimates are going
down but the average age of death going up, but it is on a fairly stable set of contracts and reflects aging of the
insured, the maturing of some contracts and the acquisitions of new.


There is no getting around the force of mortality. So far I have yet to see surviving a year providing more than a year
of LE.


None of the disclosures by any of these companies provides enough information to reproduce the results in the filings.
There is enough information to call out the authors misrepresentation.


I'm not sure that 21st Services change to a rapid update of their mortality tables will be a good thing especially if they
vary widely. More volatility will be introduced into already volatile market. 21st Services already has had to correct
errors in their new methods per the IFT annual report.

I sincerely appreciate the depth of your piece, it certainly helped me wrap my head around things more. Now
not to undermine the extent of your explanation, but would it be terribly lay-man of me to sum your conclusion
to the effect that AFSI was essentially "pro-rating" their LE based on new/old contract mixes?


Also, just to clarify, do the residual LEs you speak of relate directly to the "older" portion of their contracts as
they are dropping, yet the greater proportion (2/3) of new contracts is causing a increase in the average age
of mortality?


I've also read a lot about poor comparisons between firms dealing with LSCs. I'm not sure what one would
define as a "pure play" in this environment, but I gather that there are several arenas used to commoditize
these into investments. Is it "fair" to say what the discount rate across the entire sub-industry would be, or do
specific/unique operations entitle one to use a custom rate? Even if this is allowed, is the extent of their
disclosure truly lacking? If this is truly an unethical firm wouldn't they attempt more sophisticated measures
aimed at a more sizeable portion of their business?


If I'm redundant, or completely misinformed I apologize, I am not a seasoned investor. I find the situation, and
its subsequent potential for gains (with heighted risk), too enticing to leave idly by.


27 Dec 2013, 12:07 PM

Looks like this was addressed to me. I wish that SA had some kind of notification when someone responds to
a comment.


LEs are the expected time to live given you've reached your current age, so they are age dependent. My point
was that geoinvesting was attributing IFT's (not AFSI's) increased LEs to being more prudent or conservative
when it was the side effect of adding a bunch (2 times the number of policies before the addition resulting in 3
times the number of policies) of policies of younger people which increased the average LE. It is the
misrepresentation of the facts that have a simple explanation that is the problem with the geoinvesting
articles. Averages are all that are disclosed.


Most of the discussion is about (residual) Life Expectancy rather than age of mortality. The average age of
death changes with both the average LE and the average age now. Mortality age = current age + LE.
Surviving one more year does increase the odds of living a bit longer.


The AFSI LSC population was much more stable during the comparison period. I did point out that the
average mortality age did increase as a result of the aging of the insured and the LE for that age.


Pure plays would be companies that originate, buy and sell LSCs or invest in them as their primary business.
AFSI does not. It is in the insurance business and holds a modest number of LSCs, relative to the total
assets, as investments.

Compensation shouldn't be a weighted factor when valuing a company relatively speaking. Check out
Oracle's Ellison compensation; the company/stock is doing just fine.  
As for myself, I purchased 300k shares of AFSI preferred last week averaged at $18.25 - this has large
upside potential with an outstanding yield.


29 Dec 2013, 04:49 PM


The Long Tail of Finance
Agree, but on other hand, corporate governance (does the compensation committee lavish outlandish pay packages
on the C-suite) is a factor I look at. Point taken on Oracle.


Why do you think the preferred has huge upside potential? Most people don't buy preferreds for upside, and if they
think there is huge upside, then the common is usually preferred (no pun intended).


29 Dec 2013, 05:24 PM


FinancialGuru33
The dumping is an outlier to the preferred stock. It should be valued close to $21. Inclusive of the yield, it's a
screaming buy. You get a less risky asset with preferred compared to the common. I thought investors
recognized this trade back on Dec 12-13th, but it's near the same levels once again. I guess this is an
opportunity for anyone who missed out. People say you can't pray with Wall Street but sometimes you don't
have to. It's easy money.

In principle, preferreds have less volatility and are usually bought for the income stream instead of
appreciation found with common stock. Some people describe them as a mix between a stock and a bond.


The 9% yield is good, but you can still find this in many other financial preferreds. However, an acquaintance
of mine showed me that the "combo" of it potentially regaining back to $20-21 in addition to the yield makes
this a great investment opportunity. Therefore, there could be a collective 15% upside (what we could see in
the common stock), without dealing with associated risk. Every investment I have made has been in common
stock, but this appears to be an extraordinary case sparked by the speculative selling. So the bottom line is

that people are grabbing the preferreds to avoid potential risk (if Geoinvesting is right) while looking at similar
upside with the common.


This is an interesting strategy, and I bought preferreds at $19 but obviously it's not bullet proof. Personally I
think your timing was spot on and you should get a nice return over the next few months with the common as
well.

Thanks Brian for the explaining it to me. Much appreciated. Management has handled this situation well. I have faith
that AFSI will outperform, good luck!

Oh, I use one at work and one at home. Once upon a time, I forgot my password and couldn't reach my work e-mail
so I created another one. :)

I have to be careful what I say because my very first post, calling this scheme exactly what it is, was deleted by SA. In
addition, my formal complaint that I filed with SA which was short on substance but long on heart went unanswered.
But, with AFSI having now issued a buyback of 150M, http://yhoo.it/1dtsCc6 it is interesting that there hasn't been a
peep out of GeoInvesting with more of their awesome analysis. By one estimate on The Motley Fool
http://www.fool.com a buyback of that size would be about half of the effective float. Guess I should be grateful as I
was able to buy shares at less than $25 a share when the stock traded under $30 and the March $30 puts were
priced with a heavy dosage of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt). In reality though, I simply feel sorry those that
allowed FUD to rule, thereby selling their shares at what was probably the worst time. Of course, this may not be over.
But, if not, my best dreams will come true.

We'll see if this stays posted. But, I'm not necessarily optimistic in that regard. Long stock, short March $30 and $35
puts.

Any comment on the acquisition of Tower? I am wondering why the acquisition was handled via a privately held
company rather than through AFSI. Would seem that the purchase of Tower at a good price as a "corporate
opportunity" that should have been given to AFSI rather than a privately held company. Thoughts?

My feel is that they are nearing the limits of their balance sheet for further M&A growth, which will limit their ability to
hide future adverse development with continued growth, if they are indeed under-reserved. Say what you will about
every other aspect of the short thesis, it seems to be very hard to argue that AFSI does not have a potentially
dangerous level of policy leverage and unusually low levels of estimated policy losses. Either this company has
unique attributes allowing it to enjoy such profitable underwriting opportunities or they are being over-aggressive in
their loss assumptions. There is no middle ground.


I think one of these two explanations is significantly more plausible than the other. I think the other potential elements
are real concerns, but are not essential parts of the short thesis.


Sorry to re-hash the whole thesis again but I feel like interrupting the high-fives between the various dip buyers whose
research into AFSI consisted of reading Bronte Capital's response and concluding that GeoInvesting are the real
fraudsters here.


Getting back to the most recent deal, the structure may be useful for the Karfunkels' as it could allow them to further
obfuscate the condition of their various related party entities, as Michael Karfunkel will be taking the Bermuda-based
reinsurance operations, potentially setting the stage for future opaque reinsurance transactions.


I would love to see John Hempton offer a more thoughtful response instead of his brusquely dismissive comments
which he probably spent about 10 minutes contemplating. I don't think AFSI is nearly as cut and dry as he suggests
and I think he has empowered bulls with a similarly limited attention span but without the ability to critically analyze
either side of the argument to dismiss all criticism of the company as a 'short attack'. There are real questions
surrounding the Luxembourg entities that neither his analysis nor the company's comments answer satisfactorily.


The bottom line for me with AFSI is that the company is incredibly sleazy and that it is in every way structured in a
manner consistent with control fraud (for an extensive and relevant discussion of this, check out William Black).
Control freak management, aggressive accounting in an industry with permissive accounting rules, insane growth
rates, huge disparity between book value and tangible book value, management composed of likely 'yes men', a
hideously complicated structure, etc etc. This obviously doesn't prove anything, but it does raise some real questions
if my thesis about them being under-reserved is correct. The actions taken by management are rational and
consistent with a 'reactive' fraud trying to stay one step ahead of its problems

An optimist would of course say that this is silly, the family owns the equity, so why would they cheat? Insider
ownership has not historically been any bar to massive fraud (look at say, the S&L crisis, or any number of other more
recent events), and in fact creates significant incentives to cheat. The downside lies with the creditors and
policyholders have much more to lose and the Karfunkel's get to continue rolling the dice in an attempt to stay one
step ahead of their problems.


Just to recap in case there was any confusion; I am short AFSI but am depressingly cognizant that management
along with their various banking, accounting, and legal cheerleaders will be able to continue perpetrating this fraud for
some time yet, but I am stubborn. I am willing to sit here for years and wait to get paid. I am not afraid of a 'short
squeeze'. I size positions adequately and rely on my conviction.


Have fun trading in and out of this one guys. I think the end result is pretty clear for anyone with a sense of history
and some semblance of analytical ability.

Despite SA's attempts to sanitize the comments that are directed at geoinvesting, they have a history that is
public. You have to call them like you see them.


I think it is a much simpler explanation as to why the Karfunkels kept the Tower acquisition for themselves.
They are going to make more money that way.


It is a bit different investing in a company where the insiders hold the majority of shares and the public is a
minority. But that's no reason to go all conspiracy theory.


Mostly, it sounds like you are saying that AFSI's performance is too good to be true and you don't like the
business that they are in. You have to admit though that geoinvesting's short rationale was ham fisted at best.

RG - Yours is a better summary of the short case for AFSI than anything else I've read on SA. The important
issues are the operating and financial leverage of AFSI, especially relative to their peer group. With these
recent acquisitions of Insco/Dico and the renewal rights for Tower's commercial business, I would think there
might be a capital raise (equity, preferred, convertible?) in the near future for AFSI. On the other hand, rating
agency AMBest just this afternoon reaffirmed the 'A stable' (along with a glowing review of management)
rating for AFSI so I suppose there's no imminent capital raise? It's certain that AMBest has more information
than we have so we have to trust them? 
I used to be short AFSI when the stock was in the 20's but I had my head handed to me on that one. I am
now long AFSI but have sold OTM calls and puts to try to take advantage of the elevated volatility.


As far as the Tower deal goes, this is a typical AFSI transaction in that they've acquired the renewal rights and
in-force policies but the loss reserves are left with ACP Re so that any issues with loss reserves are not
AFSI's problem. For the record I am still short TWGP but covered half my position after the deal was

announced, I still think there's some possibility that the deal won't go through in which case I expect TWGP to
have a real solvency issue.

fair enough fair enough, sometimes my tin hat shows under my fat cat tophat. i do however feel like the
complexity of this structure (ie with MHLD existing almost solely to beneficially serve AFSI) has been adopted
with some intention of making the actual position of the various operating businesses hard to unpack (nothing
necessarily nefarious here- this is something anyone savvy could do, ie see something like kinder morgan),
and i do have my questions about the financial stability of the various pieces of the empire. so i wouldn't be
surprised if the karfunkels view it as a positive to have a number of different balance sheet with reinsurance
capabilities which allow them to spread risk as they see fit.
