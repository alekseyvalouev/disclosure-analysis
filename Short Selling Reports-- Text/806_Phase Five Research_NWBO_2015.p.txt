The Northwest Biotherapeutics House Of Cards Is Ready To Collapse
Oct. 29, 2015 7:44 AM ET412 comments
by: Phase Five Research


Summary


NWBO has been developing its cancer vaccine, DCVax, for 20 years now, and has
very little chance of succeeding in the ongoing phase 3 trial.


In the meantime, NWBO’s CEO and Chairperson, Linda Powers, uses the company
to financially support her investment in NWBO and other private companies.


Specifically, since 2004 NWBO transferred over $300 million to Powers and private
companies controlled by her, through transfer of cash, shares, warrants and options.


Collected evidence indicates that a company incorporated by NWBO’s independent
director, Navid, received $5 million of NWBO securities after he released a bullish
research report on the company.


We provide evidence suggesting that an Israeli medical center has been selling the
unapproved DCVax treatment out with the company’s clinical trials, and that this
center may be owned by Powers.


Introduction


In 2016, Northwest Biotherapeutics (OTC:NWBO) will have been developing the DCVax
dendritic vaccine for exactly 20 years. This bio-failure-in-the-making exhibits all the
obvious signs of a looming disaster: clinical trials stretching over decades, half a dozen
trial amendments and extensions, lack of reliable results and publications, an utter mess
in reporting on them, and most recently, a sudden unexplained halt to patient enrollment in
the Phase 3 trial of the company's lead candidate. NWBO has used probably every trick in
the book to prevent the inevitable end and announcing the results of its clinical trials, and
for a good reason: as long as failure is not announced, the dream can live on and fresh
money can be raised by NWBO which then feeds it to NWBO CEO's private companies.


The lack of corporate governance has allowed NWBO's CEO, Chairperson and President,
Linda Powers (former VP Global Finance at Enron), to unscrupulously use the company
as her personal checking account to financially support her investment in NWBO and
other private companies, mostly Cognate Bioservices Inc, by transferring massive
amounts of cash, shares and warrants to herself and companies she owns and controls.

In addition, we believe NWBO has been involved in various undisclosed transactions with
(1) Powers and her companies, (2) at least one major shareholder and with (3) its
"independent director" Dr. Navid Malik.


We have studied NWBO inside out, and below is a brief summary of our findings:


- Clinical development fiascos and forthcoming clinical failure. NWBO has been
developing DCVax for 20 years now. We present data that shows why DCVax has very
little chance of succeeding in its ongoing phase 3 glioblastoma trial;


- Diluting minority shareholders. Powers and her companies (the "Toucan Group")
invested in NWBO approximately $16 million of cash since she first invested in NWBO in
2004 (loans repaid by NWBO have been deducted from the calculation) and her current
holdings are estimated at $150 million. The public shareholders have been less fortunate
and have mostly been losing money on NWBO as dilution followed dilution.


- Diverting cash and shares to the CEO's private company. According to the evidence
we collected, Powers and her companies were cash-strapped and had debt outstanding
that prevented them even from paying due taxes, let alone have funds to continue to
invest in NWBO. In this article, we will depict the method that was used to prevent dilution
to Powers' companies and provide funds to Cognate.


- Five million dollars' worth of securities transferred to a company incorporated by
an analyst covering the share, turned director. Our research has uncovered that Dr.
Navid Malik, NWBO's 2012 nominated independent director, released in 2010 a very
bullish research report on NWBO. Shortly after, a company he had just incorporated in
Delaware received approximately $5 million worth of shares and warrants of NWBO from
Powers' Toucan Fund II vehicle, shares that were subsequently sold by the company.
Malik's involvement with the company prior to his nomination as director has been
concealed from investors and we question the legitimacy of this transaction and his
independence as director.


- Ghost writers promote the company and its treatment on both financial and
cancer-related websites. We present evidence that suggest that ghost writers work their
way on forums aimed at cancer patients, promoting the company's unapproved treatment.


- Evidence suggest Powers controls a clinic providing paid "compassionate"
treatments of NWBO's unapproved DCVax. There is strong evidence suggesting that an
Israeli medical center (the International Center for Cell Therapy & Cancer Immunotherapy,

or CTCI) that has been selling NWBO's unapproved DCVax treatment to terminally ill
patients for hundreds of thousands of dollars may be indirectly owned by Powers and her
companies.


- Additional issues are presented in the complete report.


The report is divided into two parts. The first part discusses the forensic findings and the
second part discusses the clinical data, or better phrased, the lack of clinical data. The
Figure below provides a condensed overview of the major parties involved with NWBO
(the complete map can be seen in appendix 1 at the end of this article):

Background


Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. (OTC:NWBO) was incorporated in 1998 and is engaged in
developing and commercializing immunotherapy products to treat cancers. The company's
main technology platform is the DCVax (short for Dendritic Cells Vaccine) which uses
activated dendritic cells to mobilize patients' own immune system to attack their cancer
cells.


In 2007, Powers became Chairperson of the NWBO board and in 2011 also President and
CEO. Since Powers took control of the company it focused mainly on two products:
DCVax-L for GBM brain cancer and DCVax-Direct for all types of inoperable solid tumors.
During this time, NWBO did two reverse splits (15:1 in 2007 and 16:1 in 2012) and raised
a total of approximately $250 million in cash and recorded losses of more than $570

million. Management team and the company's clinical data have been highly controversial
and no analyst is following the company. Yet, its share price has fluctuated significantly
over the last few years as the result of extensive PR work.


According to NWBO's latest filings (2014 10-k), Powers and her companies own 29% of
the issued and outstanding shares and 48% on a fully-diluted basis (including warrants
and options). As NWBO's current market cap is approximately $388 million, the holdings
of the shares, options and warrants are worth about $150 million. While NWBO
continuously diluted shareholders over the years, Powers was able to maintain a
significant holding in the company mostly through related-party transactions and by
issuing shares and warrants to her companies with a significant discount to market prices.


1. NWBO is continuously diluting minority shareholders


In order to elucidate the modus operandi of Powers for massively diluting minority
shareholders, some additional background information is required:


The Toucan Capital Fund II was established in 2001 by Linda Powers and her husband,
Robert Hemphill Jr., Toucan Fund II was a $40 million venture fund focused on
investments in life sciences and information technology companies. In 2010, Toucan Fund
II holding in NWBO was transferred to a new fund - Toucan Capital Fund III.


Cognate BioServices (formerly - "Cognate Therapeutics") was founded by Toucan in 2002.
In July 2004, following Toucan's first investment in NWBO, Cognate was chosen by
NWBO to manufacture NWBO's product candidates.


Cognate has a major role in this story as its gives perceived legitimacy (at least on the
surface of it) for the transfer of cash and shares from NWBO to the Power's-owned
Toucan Group. On May 17, 2007, Powers was appointed as chairperson of NWBO's
Board of Directors and on the very same day a new manufacturing agreement between
NWBO and Cognate was signed. Such coincidence also occurred in the second quarter of
2011 - during that quarter Powers was appointed as the CEO and President of NWBO (on
top of her Chairperson position), and towards the end of that quarter a new manufacturing
agreement was signed with Cognate.


This agreement is at the heart of this funds and shares diversion from NWBO to the
Toucan Group. Based on this agreement, a total of $254 million of costs were
recorded by NWBO in the form of cash, shares, warrants and other benefits.


As shown in the following figure, since Powers was appointed as CEO in 2011, the billings
of Cognate to NWBO have shot to the moon, and rising:

On top of the ever-growing billing for Cognate's services, Cognate (i.e. Powers) and
NWBO agreed that some of the amounts owed to Cognate would be convertible into
shares of NWBO (this agreement is subject to a class-action lawsuit filed and is discussed
in the full report). That conversion was the starting point for further beneficial conversion
agreement to Powers or as commonly known: shareholder dilution. The table below
summarizes the Cognate invoice conversions made from 2011 through 2014:


A/P - accounts payables

As part of the new agreements, NWBO also made equity-based initiation fee to Cognate
in the form of restricted shares and warrants in a value of $21.3 million. In the consolidate
statement of cash flows for 2014, this amount is defined as: "Stock and warrants issued
to Cognate BioServices as compensation under Cognate Agreements".

Over the years, NWBO provided Cognate with inducements that were not related either to
its services or to the debt owed to it. The table below demonstrates the impact of NWBO's
relationship with Cognate, Fund II and III, Toucan Partners, Toucan Corporation and
Powers since the inception of that relationship in mid-2004:


* Accumulated deficit for the period 2004-H1 2015 was calculated by subtracting the
accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2003, from the accumulated deficit as of June 30,
2015.


Source: created by author, based on company annual reports


This table illustrates how Toucan is responsible for most of NWBO's expenses since 2004
through 2014. Most troubling, even more than the absurd R&D expenses, is the
outrageous amount of $100 million of wealth transferred, the result of various kinds of
benefits and inducements that were given to the Toucan Group on account of common
stockholders and the source for most of Powers current estimated $150 million holdings in
NWBO.


In addition to this massive wealth transfer, NWBO's financials disclose that NWBO
managed to spend another $115 million on R&D, which was not paid to Powers'
companies (Calculated based on NWBO's disclosures of related party transactions). Since
2011, when NWBO started its Phase III trial, it recorded a total of $220 million of R&D
costs. As a rule of thumb, a Phase III clinical trial of such magnitude costs between $30

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 7/183


and $60 million. In light of these finding, we believe Cognate has significantly over-
charged NWBO for R&D services, in addition to other unjustified transfer of wealth from
the company to the Toucan Group.


2. NWBO's Independent Director Malik dealings with NWBO and Powers


We have found evidence of undisclosed transactions between Dr. Navid Malik, NWBO's
"independent" director and member of its Audit, Compensation and Nomination
committees, and NWBO and the Toucan Group. Soon after, Navid released an extremely
bullish report on NWBO, Regen Med Acquisition Corp. ("Regen Med"), a company he
has just incorporated in Delaware, received $5 million worth of shares and warrants of
NWBO from Toucan Fund II. This and additional findings we present, cast serious doubt
on Navid's ability to serve as a director of the company and over the legitimacy of the
transactions that occurred between the Toucan Group, NWBO and Navid and his
undisclosed partner Alia Minhas.


On April 17, 2012, NWBO announced that Dr. Navid Malik has joined the Board of
Directors of the company.


According to NWBO's 2010 10-K, on July 14, 2010, only one month after Malik released
his bullish piece, NWBO entered into an unsecured convertible loan with Regen Med, the
same company he has just incorporated. According to NWBO's disclosure, Regen Med
provided a 60-day $1.75 million bridge loan carrying 6% interest. According to the same
filing, the Regen Med loan was repaid by a Toucan entity (Toucan Partners) and other
third parties. In later filings, NWBO disclosed that Regen Med also received 2,333,333
(145,833 post reverse split) warrants as part of the bridge loan. We don't believe Regen
Med had actually taken any risk in providing this loan to NWBO and basically was
gifted warrants of NWBO.


Furthermore, in NWBO's 2010 10-K, NWBO stated that Powers is actually the majority
owner of Regen Med:


"…Ms. Powers is a managing member of Toucan Management, LLC, which is the
manager of Toucan Capital, and is a managing member of Toucan Partners and is
majority owner of Regen Med Acquisition Corp"


But, on the next page of the same 10-K, NWBO disclosed that on December 30, 2010,
Toucan Fund II transferred 6,433,162 shares and 7,345,030 warrants to Regen Med, "a
non-affiliated third party". This means that approximately $5 million of shares and warrants

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 8/183


were transferred to the company Navid has recently incorporated in Delaware, where it's
pretty difficult to get information about ownership.


Are you getting confused? How can Regen Med be incorporated by Navid, majority owned
by Powers and be a non-affiliated third party?


In NWBO's 2011 10-K, Regen Med is not disclosed anymore as majority owned by
Powers and referred to only as "a non-affiliate third party".


Surprisingly, on June 30, 2012, NWBO filed an S-1 identifying a certain Alia Minhas as the
person who is holding the voting and dispositive power over the shares held by Regen
Med. NWBO continued providing this statement in later filings in 2012 until Regen Med
dropped below the 5% holding threshold which requires disclosure. No relationship
between Alia Minhas and Powers or Malik was disclosed by NWBO.


Our research has uncovered information regarding Alia Minhas and NWBO's director
Malik, which show without a doubt that Navid and Minhas are related:


- Minhas and Malik incorporated a UK partnership named RSC Capital LLP on December
4, 2008, with the registered address: Hawthorne House, 1 Cholmeley Park, Highgate
London N6 5NT (See appendix 1);


- Minhas and Malik were disclosed by Galena Bioparma Inc. as shareholders. Galena is
currently under SEC investigation for using stock promoters to pump its share price while
insiders sold shares. Richard Pearson published in July 2014 an article in which he
claimed that a PR firm linked to the Galena case was behind many of the bullish articles
published on NWBO (we highly encourage readers to have a read).


In addition, Powers is currently identified as the sole director of Regen Med. In the
lawsuit that was filed against Cognate by its prior CEO, Cognate's lawyers disclosed that
Theraigm Inc., a Toucan Capital portfolio company, is owned by Regen Med.


We believe Powers and Malik should come clean and disclose the real transactions
that happened:


- What compensation was provided to Malik for publishing the 2010 report? Was the
transaction that netted Regen Med 2.3 million warrants a compensation for his report?
Who really provided the funds for Regen Med to loan to NWBO? Why where $5 million of
securities transferred from Powers to a company Navid incorporated?

- Why did NWBO disclose that Regen Med was majority owned by Powers and still claim it
was an unrelated party? We urge Powers to reveal the ownership history of Regen Med.


- How come Minhas came to have voting and dispositive power over the shares held by
Regen Med? Were Regen Med's shares really transferred to Minhas and Malik, or did they
just serve as a proxy to hide Powers' sale of the shares held by Toucan Fund II without
disclosing that she is actually selling shares since investors seeing her selling shares
would start to doubt the story?


The timeline in the figure below illustrates the events surrounding Regen Med and Navid's
transactions.

3. How to draw attention of patients to an unapproved treatment that oncologists
don't recommend?


According to The Street columnist, Adam Feuerstein, NWBO is reliant on (NYSE:A)
oncologists to inform patients about the availability of DCVax or (NYSE:B) patients need to
inquire about it:



http://www.thestreet.com/story/12525597/1/northwest-bios-german-smokescreen-obscures-DCVax-problems.html

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 10/183


"Northwest Bio cannot market DCVax in Germany. The company cannot advertise
for patients or talk about the benefits and risks of DCVax because it remains an
unapproved therapy. The only way DCVax gets used in Germany is if brain tumor
patients ask their doctors about it, or if doctors recommend the experimental therapy
to their patients"


We believe the clinical data of the company has been of low quality and therefore
oncologists have not rushed patients to enroll in the clinical trials of NWBO. This is
evidenced by the very long time it took the company to enroll patients for their clinical trials
and we believe that this is due to the scientific background of DCVax. So how do you get
patients to ask about the treatment if oncologists are not impressed with DCVax?


As previously mentioned, Richard Pearson provided ample evidence linking NWBO to the
PR firm MDM Worldwide and to stock promotion campaigns. We believe this does not
stop here. We believe that ghost writers have not only promoted the company on investor
oriented platforms, but also on platforms aimed at Gliobastoma Multiforme (GBM)
patients, in order to promote DCVax, its "superiority" to other alternatives and to persuade
terminally ill patients to cuff up the north of $100,000 needed for private-pay treatment.


We have found examples of "posters" and "pumpers" that continuously mention NWBO
and DCVax on websites such as inspire.com, a site created for people to discuss and
share opinions on health issues, Twitter, cancercompass.com and InvestorsHub.com.


Usually such posts are in the form of a link to a press release or providing "information"
and "updates" on NWBO's progress and even suggesting patients to contact NWBO. After
reading such posts, it seems that these posters trying to build credibility for NWBO's
treatment within a group of patients and not only promote the company on financial
investor's boards, which is an issue for the SEC.


A good example of such promotion of DCVax can be seen in this link. Note johnlane 45
and SimonAl in this thread. Due to article length issues, additional examples are
presented at the complete report.


4. How to turn patient despair into $$$?


GBM patients not enrolled to NWBO's clinical trials have been referred by the company to
hospitals in Germany, the UK and probably mostly to an Israeli center to receive a paid
"compassionate" treatment, a treatment for which NWBO is not allowed to charge money
in the US. Desperate families are referred by NWBO to the controversial Professor
Shimon Slavin and the International Center for Cell Therapy & Cancer Immunotherapy

Ltd. (CTCI). The CTCI center is an Israel-based medical center, which provides treatments
with NWBO's unapproved DCVAX vaccine outside of the clinical trials conducted in the
U.S. and Europe.


We believe that ample evidence suggests that Powers also controls CTCI. Our research
findings that suggest Powers controls CTCI include:


- In July 2008, Cognate incorporated a subsidiary in Israel - Cognate Bioservices Israel
Ltd. ("Cognate IL"), who's address is 14 Weizman St. Tel Aviv, Israel. The sole director at
incorporation of Cognate IL was Linda Powers.


- In November 2008, the CTCI was incorporated. The address of CTCI was disclosed as
"c/o Cognate Israel at Weizman Street 14, Tel Aviv". This address was later changed to
the address of Engel-Bakshi CPA, an accounting office that was used to incorporate both
Cognate IL and CTCI.


- The following domains were purchased in September 2008, two months before CTCI
was incorporated, and are held on the name of Powers. The address and contact details
are those of Powers and Toucan Capital: ctcicenter.com; ctcicenter.net; ctcicenter.org;


- Cognate IL and CTCI share the same directors and contact details;


- CTCI's privacy policy states: "This policy applies only to the website, services and
operations of CTCI, and the CTCI-related operations of other parties included in the
content of CTCI's website, such as Northwest Biotherapeutics, Cognate BioServices and
others";


- A trustee holds the shares of CTCI to prevent exposing the real identity of the
shareholder;


- According to Professor Slavin's (head of the CTCI) CV, he is, or was, a member of the
scientific board of NWBO.


In the cancer forum post mentioned in the previous chapter, the Egyptian user
posted an email that he received from an NWBO employee named Carol Powers
(who we believe is Linda Powers' immediate family according to certain ownership filings
with the SEC) after he contacted NWBO regarding treatment for his mother. In the email
reply, although she is aware to the fact that his mother does not meet the requirements to
participate in the clinical trials, Carol Powers refers the user to CTCI for
"compassionate/private pay" treatment at a cost of more than $100,000. The following
are selected quotes from the email reply that the user posted on July 2013:

"Dear Mohamed:


I apologize for the delay in getting this note out to you, but I am writing on behalf of
Northwest Biotherapeutics in response to your inquiry about the DCVax cancer vaccine...
Unfortunately, the clinical trial that Northwest is conducting in the US and UK is only for
those patients who are newly diagnosed with GBM, who meet certain protocol
requirements, and who had their surgery at the clinical trial site…


… Again it is unfortunate, but there are currently no medical clinics in Egypt or Europe
where access to DCVax can be provided as part of a special treatment option provided in
concert with your mother's regular cancer treatment protocol. We do have a collaborative
arrangement with a clinic in Israel and we are able to manufacture and administer DCVax
on a very limited, compassionate/private pay basis there.


I look forward to connecting with you soon.


With warm regards,

5. The anticipated clinical failure of DCVax


Much like our previous call Vital Therapies' ELAD therapy, NWBO's DCVax works
wonderfully in theory. Yet, much like VTL's ELAD, since NWBO's inception in 1996, there
has actually never been any solid indication that DCVax has a chance of succeeding in
an FDA-approved, adequately-controlled pivotal study. Actually, there has never been any
solid scientific proof that any tumor-lysate-pulsed dendritic cell therapy is effective. The
following chapters will demonstrate that the "efficacy data" of DCVax-L for Glioblastoma
multiforme, which has been propping this stock on a cloud of hopes since its second
Nasdaq IPO in 2012, is actually based on 2 hardly-relevant, largely cherry-picked, Phase
1 trials.


About Glioblastoma multiforme


Glioblastoma multiforme is a fast-growing brain cancer that develops from star-shaped
glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). GBM has an incidence of two to three per
100,000 adults per year, and accounts for 52 percent of all primary brain tumors. Overall,

GBM accounts for about 17 percent of all tumors of the brain (primary and metastatic).
These tumors tend to occur in adults between the ages of 45 and 70.


GMB has a widely reported median survival of around 12-18 months after diagnosis.
However, despite what NWBO likes to tell investors, long-term survival has been on the
rise, particularly since the approval of temozolomide in 2005.


In the current clinical setting, up to 28% of patients survive for 2 years, and up to 16% of
patients have been found to survive for more than 3 years. The clinical and molecular
factors that contribute to long-term survival are still unknown, but broad retrospective
studies identified young age and high Karnofsky score to be strong predictors of
survival of over 5 years for GBM patients, even for those patients whose cancer has
recurred up to four times after surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.


Interestingly, the median age of all the newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients in NWBO's
early-stage trials to-date was 45, and Karnofsky score - 90. According to the
aforementioned statistics, at least 15% of these patients would have been expected to
survive over 5 years with standard therapy, not 2-3%, as NWBO commonly advertises
alongside their own "findings" in their presentations.

Perhaps the most awful thing about NWBO is the way the company has reported
DCVax results, and particularly the Houdini tricks the data from various trials have
been pulling in NWBO reports and investor presentations. Fights have broken out in
the comment section of Seeking Alpha articles between confused investors as to which
reported data belonged to which published study, and particularly how some 5 patients
vanished in one investor presentation data set and some more appeared somewhere else.
The lack of mathematical sense is not due to NWBO having reinvented calculus as well as
cancer, but rather because they have no faith in the mathematical prowess of their
investors.

Simply put, there have been only three completed clinical trials related to DCVax and
which NWBO references with much entanglement (see table below): a Phase 1 study on
14 patients conducted by Yu, Wheeler et al at Cedars-Sinai, a Phase 1 study on 12
patients conducted by NWBO's favorite Linda Liau at UCLA which used tumor-associated
peptides, and a Phase 1 28-patient study which became a Phase 1/2 and sometimes
Phase 2 study conducted by Linda Liau using a TLR agonist.

There are also several publications related to these studies, which seem to have been the
source of the confusion. Interestingly, in the publication section of their website, NWBO
forgot to add references to two of Linda Liau's main articles which tested a combination of
a DC vaccination and a TLR agonist (likely not what NWBO is currently testing). However,

even though these studies included different protocols (that differ altogether from the
ongoing phase 3), NWBO added the best of the findings from these irrelevant studies to
their investor presentations.


Between 2006 and 2013, NWBO insisted the second Phase 1 study run by Liau and
colleagues recruited only 17 patients. This could be because only 17 patients were
recruited to the trial by that time, but this number keeps getting tossed around to further
the confusion. As of 2014, the total patient number from both of Liau's trials is, according
to NWBO, 39:


"We and our collaborator, Dr. Linda Liau, conducted two prior Phase I/II clinical trials
at UCLA with DCVax-L for GBM brain cancer. These trials consisted of 39 patients
with newly diagnosed GBM and recurrent GBM, and a couple of other gliomas"


Where an extra patient from the two trials disappeared off to remains a mystery.


Now onto a typical NWBO investor presentation:

Third-grade math would be sufficient to ensure bewilderment at these mathematical
concoctions. No matter how many additions and subtractions we did, we failed to arrive at
the number of 20 newly diagnosed GBM patients from the Phase 1 and 2 trials, even
when you take into account the fatal error in the number of newly diagnosed and recurrent
GBM patients in one of Linda Liau's articles (see previous Table). Another patient just
went missing, and along with him, the identity of the data NWBO seemed to have cherry
picked for their "nicely rounded up" PFS and OS values.


Even if we ignore the fact that the median age of newly diagnosed GBM patients the two
Phase 1 studies NWBO references turned out to be a youthful long-term-GBM-surviving
45 and median Karnofsky score was a near-perfect 90 (patient characteristics of study
number 1 and 2 are available), the PFS and OS numbers NWBO brags about are still not
relevant.


The simple reason for this is that NWBO nonchalantly pooled data from two studies which
utilized different DC vaccines with different adjuvants. The first Phase 1 study by Liau
didn't even use DCs incubated with tumor lysate, but rather specifically isolated tumor-
associated proteins. The second study utilized a TLR adjuvant, which is likely not what the
company is currently testing. In other words, NWBO's prior clinical data is as relevant as
their publications section.


Immunocellular therapeutics reported better phase 1 survival numbers than NWBO
before failing phase 2


In what has now become the industry's rule of thumb, therapies sensationalized by small-
scale, open label single Phase 1 studies don't live up to expectations in Phase 3. This is
likely to be happening to NWBO soon and has already happened to NWBO's cousin
technology ICT-107, developed by Immunocellular Therapeutics for GBM. Instead of using
blended tumor to incubate DCs, IMUC chose 6 specific tumor antigens.


ICT-107 actually yielded better OS readings, and very similar PFS readings to those of
DcVax in Phase 1 trials, but failed to significantly prolong overall survival in a follow-up
124-patient phase II trial with temozolamide vs temozolamide. The following table shows a
comparison of DcVax phase 1 and ICT-107 phase 1 and phase 2 trials outcomes in newly
diagnosed GBM patients.

NWBO's survival figures don't look so sensational now.


Ongoing DCVax GBM Phase 3


NWBO has been running a global Phase 3 study, which currently is not working out for
them due to a halt on patient enrollment which was announced in August of 2015.


This is the first time NWBO is running a placebo-controlled trial, which is a type of trial
which kills technologies that do not work. It looks like DCVax already had a pre-death
experience in August of 2014 when they suddenly announced an amendment to the
number of patients and the number of statistical events, particularly a lowering of the
success threshold for their primary endpoint.


The trial would now recruit 348 total patients, up from a previous 312, and the number of
"events" counted in the statistical analysis will increase from 110 to 248. The company
also accounted that the threshold for satisfying the primary endpoint of the Phase III trial
(which is PFS) will be lowered from requiring a 6-month difference to requiring only a 4-
month difference between the PFS of the patients treated with DCVax-L and the PFS of
patients in the control arm of the trial - in other words, the threshold for success is now
inexplicably lower.


Those who are familiar with the industry will have seen many such tricks in the past,
usually from companies who are making a last-minute desperate bid for efficacy. Usually,
these bids end in tears.


NWBO is wrong to use a PFS primary endpoint

This is perhaps the most frightening point of all for NWBO, especially in the extremely
unlikely event that DCVax manages to show some sort of efficacy in Phase 3. In yet
another amendment to their trial protocol, NWBO decided that their Phase 3 study will
have a primary endpoint which is progression-free survival instead of overall survival,
probably because it seems to them that DCVax has had a better effect on PFS than OS.


It is important to note than not only has PFS never been used as a primary endpoint for
GBM before, but also that several companies have actually asked the FDA for this
endpoint, and were not granted their wishes. Straight from a scientist's mouth, the reason
for FDA disliking PFS is that:


"Survival represents the most objective standard for evaluating GBM therapy, in part
because surgical tumor mass reduction does not necessarily correlate with
prolonged survival."


In other words, because PFS does not mean anything.


Caught in another lie, NWBO was recently busted for claiming that they were in
agreement with the FDA about amendment of their Phase 3 protocol, which would have
included the endpoint changes, when their recent SEC filings attested to just the opposite:


"The primary endpoint of our Phase III trial is progression free survival. Sometimes
regulators have accepted this endpoint, and sometimes not. There can be no
assurance that the regulatory authorities will find this to be an approvable endpoint
for Glioblastoma multiforme cancer"


If the trial does succeed with PFS as primary endpoint, there is a truly near-impossible
chance that the FDA will accept a New Drug Application (NDA) from NWBO based on this,
and the company will have to start all over again.


The clinical halt


The hold-on patient enrollment in the Phase 3 DCVax GBM trial was announced in August
2015, pending the submission of "additional regulatory information" by NWBO. As NWBO
investors may know all too well, transparency is not a forte of NWBO's CEO Linda
Powers, and the crucial reason for the halt has not yet been disclosed. However, we fear
that stern NWBO supporters may be in denial about the halt's reasons.

While speculation is rife that the halt is due to "outstanding efficacy", in actuality this event
bears absolutely no resemblance to efficacy halts which are put in place when it becomes
clear that depriving the control patient arm of the efficacious treatment would be unethical.
This is particularly evident through the fact that, according to the company's press release
on the issue, the trial has been proceeding for at least two months with the recruited
control- and active-arm patients (meaning, the placebo arm continued to receive placebo),
while selection for new patients seems to be undergoing additional scrutiny. Certainly,
placebo-arm patients haven't been rushed to receive the phenomenal DCVax at least
since August 2015[1]. Based on this, it could be speculated that certain patients who meet
the trial's selection criteria may have been found to be unsuitable, or perhaps at a safety
risk, for receiving D.


Epilog


Powers has used various methods to keep the DCVax story alive, including delaying the
release of clinical results, results which we believe would kill the DCVax story and prevent
Powers from transferring funds and shares to the Toucan Group. We believe that the
DCVax phase 3 study will fail to show statistically significant benefit over placebo and
doubt the FDA will accept the company's Phase 3 end-point of progression-free survival.
We have no doubt that the SEC will get involved and look into the transaction between
NWBO, and the Toucan Group, CTCI, Navid, Minhas and others. And when the truth will
emerge, we doubt that any of the current management of NWBO will be involved in a
public company in the future.

There is so much wrong about this article. It would take another article to go over all the incorrect or
misleading statements.


Here are a few:


- You state up to 16% of GBM patients survive 3 years, but your link clearly states, less than 16%. (Not a
huge mistake, but shows the lean towards a negative NWBO article).


- You state every where Powers transfer "cash and shares" to Cognate which is misleading in that the
majority of not almost all the transfers to Cognate have been in terms of shares or warrants, in lieu of
manufacturing. So Cognate doesnt cash in unless teh stock does well. They have yet to sell, as the sale
shown in June was not on the market at ~$10 a share but at a sell it or lose it amount of $5.50 a share. So
there hasnt been a hand over fist cashing in on the stock. No inside sales have occurred to date other than
the Cognate sell it or lose it sale. 
- ICT-107; the reason for the drop in performance between Ph I & Ph II is that Ph I target specific candidates,
while Ph II did not have the same antigen target, and therefore did not see as good a result as the Ph I. The
PFS of the Ph II DID show a good results, as did DCVax Ph I/II.


And here is the kicker, and why DCVax-L has a great chance at accelerated approval, L Powers was very
smart to use PFS as the primary endpoint. This is because the FDA may base accelerated approval on a
surrogate endpoint (PFS in this case), which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Increased PFS has

shown to be a clinical benefit, and with an aggressive disease such as GBM, there is more pressure to
evaluate new drugs and treatments. (link from FDA showing this statement exactly: http://tinyurl.com/nbb...)


If anything, I am not sure why there is such an attacking wave against NWBO, when there has been no real
proof of any foul play. To me this looks like another short selling sponsored attack. And I really hope that good
news comes soon, as I would love to see these shorts bleed on this one.

Wrong Phase V. The FDA used PFS for Optune, while it is a device, the mechanism of action clearly different,
and it is not an "available therapy" because its use has not reached sufficient "relevance"; using PFS as a
primary endpoint was consistent with FDA comments to Celldex on Rindopepimut's (which is not a device)
attempt to use overall survival:


"Celldex and the limits of ‘overall survival benefit’ in cancer trials  
Aug 13, 2015, 12:06pm EDT Updated Aug 14, 2015, 3:27pm EDT


On a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Tom Davis, Celldex chief medical officer, said of the trial that it
comes down to trial size and the whole idea of overall survival as a measure of how well a drug works.  
“Ultimately ...the concern (is) that the results of the study could be induced by chance,” said Davis. “And
hence (the FDA) has always been resistant to approval based on small randomized trials with overall survival
as one of the endpoints. That really is the primary concern. And they would have liked to see a larger data set
to confirm these results.”


The company as well as analysts remain optimistic for the eventual approval of the drug. But the reluctance of
the FDA to approve the drug based on what most people see as surprisingly strong trial data underscores the
limits of one of the two main ways of measuring how well new cancer drugs really work.


The main goal of cancer drugs trials is typically progression-free survival, or PFS — how long the drug seems
to stop the growth of a cancer. The secondary goal is overall survival, or OS — how long the patients who
took the drug actually live." -- BioFlash Editor Boston Business Journal

Are you kidding? Every 10-Q shows NWBO paying CASH (in addition to all the shares/warrants) to Cognate:


For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for the two periods,
respectively, of approximately $8.2 million, and $5.5 million to Cognate.


For the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for the two periods,
respectively, of approximately $13.1 million (with the invoices generally being paid all in cash), and $7.1
million (with the invoices generally being paid half in cash and half in stock ) to Cognate.

used $7.1 million in cash for operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013. The increase
in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the DCVax-Direct manufacturing and product

cancers, the increased manufacturing of DCVax®-L for the ongoing Phase III brain cancer trial at a growing
number of sites across the US and the preparation costs for the launch of the 60-patient Phase I/II trial with

Author’s reply »  Re:


Paragraph 1: Unclear what your point is. Optune was initially approved based on OS, so FDA already knew it
extended survival when the company requested to extend their indication to nGBM. Thus, also in order to
avoid another lengthy OS trial, they were allowed to demonstrate that they are able to achieve similar PFS
readings to what has been shown previously, which would, by sheer fact that it is the *same* device being
tested, translate into previous OS readings.


The rest: Unclear why you chose to reference the CEO of Celldex discussing the problems with small-sample
trials for OS endpoint in an argument about progression-free survival endpoints. It seems you have
misunderstood it. The article you reference says nothing about PFS being a more suitable endpoint - only that
CLDX showed better OS than PFS readings - the two did not correlate well, which made the FDA weary that
perhaps the stunning OS readings CLDX achieved were not exactly due to the drug, but instead could have
been due to probability issues related to small patients samples (same as NWBO, by the way).

Phase 5 - Its not that PFS is more suitable, its the fact that the FDA looks at surrogate endpoints for
accelerated approval which includes PFS. This is specific to aggressive diseases, such as GBM.


Another link, from FDA website: 
http://tinyurl.com/ngf..., specifically states surrogate endpoints that show clinical benefit may be used for
accelerated approval on serious or life-threatening illnesses, like GBM.. An increase in PFS is considered to
be a clinical benefit.


Another FDA presentation that actually provides the policy verbiage "... a surrogate endpoint that is
reasonably likely... to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than
survival or irreversible morbidity."

This is why Powers was smart in increasing the trial size, and using a PFS primary endpoint.

Author’s reply »  If we understand correctly, you are saying:


FDA discussed accelerated approval in 1992. They mentioned surrogate endpoints. They said sometimes
these endpoints may be suitable (if they predict survival) for approval. ==> PFS is a surrogate endpoint.
Therefore, DcVax will be allowed to apply for FDA approval with a PFS endpoint.


But:


1. Surrogate endpoints are in the hundreds, and are different. Only a small % of them have become primary
endpoints.


2. PFS does not predict OS in GBM. It is a known issue we addressed in our report. The FDA, too, knows this
very well. It is unlikely patients will be paying $100,000 to receive the joy of viewing an MRI scan of a smaller-
looking tumour if they aren't going to live longer.


3. No company has ever received approval based on PFS in first-time GBM trials.


4. No company has ever received permission to run a pivotal FDA GBM trial using PFS as a primary
endpoint.


5. NWBO admits that they do not know whether the FDA will accept this endpoint, despite having said
previously that the FDA agreed to their Phase 3 trial set-up.

From your own quote:


" You state every where Powers transfer "cash and shares" to Cognate which is misleading in that the
majority of not almost all the transfers to Cognate have been in terms of shares or warrants, in lieu of
manufacturing. "


The author is correct. They are always paid in cash and shares. Go back and read every 10-Q. They have
received cash payment which is more than IMUC and ARGS pays for a similar vaccine. The shares are a
bonus. In most cases they were paid half in cash, half in shares. Not "the majority" or "almost all" in shares.

Phase Five Research,


NWBO'S DCVAX-L PFS endpoint is backed up by an OS endpoint which defines minimum expected OS
benefit AND is why Linda said she would seek to keep the trial blinded until the last patient enrolled receives
their last treatment. If they are applying for AA the FDA will review data that will put the onus on them to
decide if it is good enough to end the trial now or simply issue a continue. The DMC ethicist can also
recommend to the FDA that the trial be stopped for ethical reasons. The DMC makes the initial stop
recommendation to NWBO without stating the reason to keep the trial blinded. The company has the option to
disregard that recommendation and choose to continue the trial to completion so that all endpoints can be
measured with a greater degree of statistical certainty. In the mean time the trial continues until the ethicist
overrides that decision by making direct contact with the regulatory agencies. When this happens I think
these agencies ask the company to submit their data to them for review. The company may also ask for
accelerated approval during this time. Since all patients are receiving SOC with the option to cross over to
treatment there may be no distinguishable overriding need to place SOC patients on the treatment arm if
separation of OS data is inconclusive due to later enrollment by a vast majority of patients. Is this not a
reasonable alternative explanation for what is happening? Best wishes.

As Steven Giardino has stated and I had suspected, the ramp up in enrollment was very slow up until the very
end of 2012 to early 2013. Before I say anything more let me just say that I am not a statistician but can
understand some of the basic concepts. One of those concepts is that when time is a consideration more
outcomes measured over a longer period of time gives you greater certainty that a given hoped for result is
not by chance. You also need more time (to compare outcomes) and more outcomes the closer you place

your expected improved outcome to no improvement. By moving the target improved outcome to 4 mos.
benefit from 6 mos., more time and events were needed to be measured for the same amount of confidence
that this new outcome measure is not because of chance. NWBO is also concerned that if benefit is ultimately
determined to be at or near 4 mos. that this may in and of itself may not be enough to convince FDA that they
should receive approval based on that alone. NWBO is leaving nothing to chance so they want FDA and
other regulatory agencies to be the ones to ask for data if and when they receive a data monitoring committee
(DMC) recommendation for a stop for efficacy. This is because the stop would be based on progression free
survival (PFS) alone which they are not sure that FDA would grant approval for. This leaves NWBO needing
to wait for overall survival outcomes to give added validation to the hoped for PFS benefit. The problem is that
the crossover option might leave very little separation between those that receive treatment immediately on
the treatment and and those who cross over to the treatment arm. All this is to say that if DCVax is only near
the minimum benefit, their may not be enough statistical significance from the current amount of time and
number of patients that have evened to warrant taking enrolled patients off of SOC. Best wishes.

Have you ever been in a poor cash flow position personally either with your own business or your home?
Have you ever been targeted for a takedown by someone who feels threatened by your potential success? I
certainly don't have specific answers for each and every situation pointed out by this article but there is
certainly potential for other motivation(s) for them than the what is implied in this article. Oppenheimer had the
opportunity to have these relationships vetted as well as Mr. Woodford and others. Linda knows the laws very
well and she has a very good idea just how far they will bend. She also knows that a penalty or two is a risk
worth taking to prevent failure. I'm am not saying this is what she has done. I am saying that even a coach will
tell you to commit a foul to prevent an easy score that might cost you the game. How you use the fouls you
are allowed before being taken out of the game is part of the strategy of playing it. I think Linda has different
motivations than you think and a better strategy for winning the game than you do. I don't like what the New
England Patriots have done to establish their MO but they have found a way to win whether I like the way
they do it or not. By the way, perhaps the best paragraph in this entire report is found just a little above the
first point they were trying to make. "According to NWBO's latest filings (2014 10-k), Powers and her
companies own 29% of the issued and outstanding shares and 48% on a fully diluted basis (including
warrants and options). As NWBO'S current market cap is approximately $388 million, the holdings of the
shares, options and warrants are worth about $150 million. While NWBO continuously diluted shareholders
over the years, Powers was able to maintain a significant holding in the company mostly through related party
transactions and by issuing shares and warrants to her companies with a significant discount to market price."

It just could have been done A LOT cheaper. There are too many examples out there of small cap bios with
expensive biologics in development that are getting it done for a fraction of what Linda Powers is charging
NWBO shareholders through her company Cognate. Again, she herself stated it should only cost
$10mm-$15mm! For a multi-site trial that enrolled and made vaccine for 278 patients, IMUC spent
(manufacturing, CRO fees, trial site fees, etc) just $14mm.


C'mon, please, let's just be honest here--this trial has been way, way too expensive and the only one
CLEARLY benefiting so far has been Cognate. $140mm to them alone and MORE than half of that has been
in cash. And, as I quoted below, NWBO have entered no increase manufacturing or scale up agreements with
Cognate. The "80,000 sq.ft" and "5,000 vaccines a year" mention in all of NWBO slides goes contrary to their
SEC (10-k) statements. Cognate may have or be ABLE to acquire that much increased capacity but it is not
for DCVax-L. Not yet. Their agreement is only for at trial-sized vaccine production. And in fact Cognate had to
overcharge them this year for exceeding pre-specified production terms.


The only thing with NWBO name on it is the Sawston facility. And that's just a shell at this point. And in fact
there are still ties to Cognate there as well. If NWBO goes bankrupt guess who will scoop up that facility on
the cheap?


Do I think Linda Powers is a devious evil human being whose only purpose in life is to fleece shareholders of
their money to build up her own business (Cognate) at very very little risk? No. I think she wants more than
that, and I think as human beings most of us want to believe we are doing good in some way, and I'm sure
she has herself convinced she is doing her part to help cure cancer. But I'm sure she will do everything in her
power to protect her interests and those of her family's. I think that comes BEFORE and ABOVE her interests
in helping cure cancer and helping out strangers (shareholders). There all always ulterior motives at play in
every action, many of which are latent and so unconscious to the individual.


I am actually thinking about going long here for a season though.

Steven,


I do not disagree that the Phase lll trial was done for much less than for what was brought in to the company. I
just believe that Linda did this to maintain as close to a majority interest in the company as possible while
their products were in the discovery and now clinical stage. Do you have any info on Linda, her family or close
associates as to their actual family income and it's source? If they have an unusually high income from
questionable sources then that would be a bigger problem. If I were Mr. Woodford, I would have asked for
proof of income from all related parties to the public and private companies that Linda and her family are
involved with. I believe Mr. Woodford and his team did a very thorough vetting of all these obvious concerns. I
also believe that Mr. Woodford is excited by the same things being seen in the DCVAX-Direct trial as I am.
What you have noted about the results and at least some of the observation about progression is sure to be
accurate. Based on protocol alone your conclusions would be expected to be correct but a total or nearly total
necrotic tumor would render additional treatment useless and potentially viewed as an unnecessary risk to

patients. This is what I believe you fail to take into account regarding this particular point. As far as when
progression begins to occur, your observations are correct and was expected by me. The reason is that DCs
in the tumor environment are genetically affected by low oxygen levels to revert back to circulatory DCs within
about 2 weeks. If they are replaced by uneducated DCs the PD-1+ macrophages begin to exert checkpoint
inhibitor pressure. This is why optimum spacing of the injections is so important. In some situations the
tumors will respond better than others even without optimized spacing but this is the exception. Best wishes.


01 Nov 2015, 09:28 AM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
Doc,


The only one saying they stopped injecting lesions because they couldn't find any live tumor cells in biopsies
are NWBO longs. Researchers say nothing of the sort and neither do NWBO management. The poster says
expressly they stop injecting early (less than 6 shots) only when there is "disease progression" or
unacceptable toxicity. There was only one patient that had a grade IV SAE so for anyone else it was due to
PD.


But I don't think many people understand what PD really is. In this trial it was defined as >25% increase of the
sum of the diameter of all target lesions, as defined using irRC, or the appearance of a new lesion(s).


A target lesion is any tumor over 1cm in diameter up to 5 total. irRC takes into account inflammation due to
immune response and so patients whose injected tumor increased in size due to infiltration of immune cells
were monitored for subsequent shrinkage. For some patients this happened, but still in almost all of them the
other lesions grew unabated or new lesions appeared. So no real systemic effect. In a couple of patients it
seems some very nearby tumors to the one injected also shrunk a little (perhaps due to cytokine storm) but
not significantly.


So where is the systemic effect? 85% were taken off therapy from 7-15 weeks due to PD assessed USING
irRC. They even changed the criteria part way through the study to no longer allow ECOG 2 patients in. Direct
is imo just too weak.


Now compare DCVax Direct with simple IL-2 injections: http://1.usa.gov/1HlfTVi


Direct can't compare. But the whole problem with IT inject treatments is they seem to work real well at beating
back the injected tumor but show no real systemic effect. And so you just can't keep up with all the tumor
spread. Next thing you know there are liver, lung and brain mets and they are all growing too fast to inject
away. New ones popping up inbetween bi monthly scans too. It's a losing battle. That's why although effective
in the injected tumor IT inject therapies have not really taken hold.


Direct was supposed to provoke a local AND systemic effect. I was hopeful it would. In theory it should. But
the evidence clearly suggests now it does no such thing. Or whatever systemic effect is just too weak to
overcome the immune suppressive capabilities of the tumor microenvironment.


Add PD-1 inhibitors? Maybe. But maybe not. There doesn't seem to be much of a t-cell response going on
with Direct. Notice there are no pre vs post inject biopsy sample comparisons in this trial. As I mentioned it's
not rare to find CD4 and some CD8 in tumor samples, especially when the lesions are larger. That's why PD-

1 inhibitors work in the first place. In fact the inflammation due to cytokine storm (sometimes) with Direct
might actually inhibit t-cell functioning. It certainly prevents macrophages from clearing away debris. There is
also evidence tumor cell necrosis may exacerbate spread.


Anyway I can go on and on. In the P2 will there be much diff? I don't think so. Again there were patients in the
P1 leg with just 1 or 2 lesions a yeah. So in the P2 the ones with 2 target lesions will have both injected. And
those with three will have all three injected. But then that's it. They will stop at three.


If I saw more examples of shrinkage in injected lesions if be hopeful. But the only one that showed that was
the ovarian case study. That looked like it shrank 50%. But see it didn't stop a new lesion from popping up
nearby. Notice she was removed from future presentations. Probably because that "apparent new lesion" was
determined via irRC and some wait time to in fact be PD. So that's a treatment fail.


You might say well why not inject that one too? And maybe in the P2 they will but according to current MDA
protocol they won't. They will take that patient off therapy and consider her a treatment fail.


The other case studies show swelling and then abating of tumors with some pockets of necrosis surrounded
by much larger sections of viable tumor. That's after months and months of tx. That will NOT help patients
with fast progressing cancers.


So I'm now completely unimpressed with DCVax Direct. Simple IL-2 injects look far better. There's evidently
no systemic effect with Direct either. The only thing good about it may be hype potential. Investors love it!
They are taken in (by greed?) proclaiming the possibility of trillion dollar market caps from treating millions of
patients with it.


Hardly. If it ever does somehow find approval (wont be ORR, so need to show a survival benefit between
groups), it will be a very niche therapy that will probably be hardly prescribed. There are already much better
IT inject therapies out there.


Jmo of course.

If on the other hand the regulatory authorities have seen a subgroup that is doing exceptionally well from
treatment then, correct me if I am wrong, they MAY be moving these patients into the treatment arm which
would require additional patients to be screened for the trial depending on the number of events that have
already occurred within this subgroup. The trial itself will not be stopped or approved only based on subgroup
finding. No one will know that these patients are being switched into treatment as Cognate will not be
informed the status of the patient nor will the doctors that administer the vaccine. Even with this possibly
being the case, the data from these patients would continue to be collected. Best wishes.

I am not saying that injections were stopped because tumors were completely or nearly completely necrotic.
I'm saying only that it might be possible if it was deemed an unnecessary invasive procedure in some cases. I
also am not saying that DCVAX-Direct will be needing a PD-1 inhibitor to improve outcomes. I am saying that
the conclusions that you have come to are simply made too early since spacing of treatment has everything
to do with effect. The treatment can fail to control disease, but perhaps not in all cases, unless educated DCs
that become circulatory after about 2 weeks are replaced with new educated DCs to keep PD-1+
macrophages from shutting down initial CD4+ T-cell response and CD8+ build up. A systemic response will
occur when there is enough build up of memory T-cells and B-cells which can't happen if these macrophages
become immunosuppressive because they are no longer being regulated by educated DCs. Some of the
patients that received "method B" may have had enough of an initial response and time to now show that
immune memory has occurred. I expect the SITC conference to clarify this point. I fully expect immune
memory to occur in more than 40% of patients once spacing is reduced to about 2 weeks plus or minus a few
days for about 20 weeks with additional injections if shown to be needed for up to 1 year. I also expect about
70% or more patients to show measurable benefit in terms of at least stable disease once spacing is
optimized and this, perhaps, will eventually be based on the type of cancer being treated. Best wishes.

Doc,


"I am not saying that injections were stopped because tumors were completely or nearly completely necrotic.
I'm saying only that it might be possible if it was deemed an unnecessary invasive procedure in some cases" -
DL


A biopsy can help determine what's going on in a lesion, but the sample taken represents only 1/100 or less
of the greater mass. Biopsies are traditionally used to locate a few malignant cells in a mass to determine if it
is cancer, not really the other way around. They are not anywhere near as reliable at determining the % of a
mass that is necrotic. Scans are much better at this. If you look again at the scan of the sarcoma case with a
very large lesion you can see pockets of necrosis (black area) between larger areas of viable tumor (lighter
regions). The fact that some biopsies showed few or no live tumor cells only means they happened to strike a
necrotic region of the mass.


Just see what cancer.org has to say about it:


"In order to report the tumor and lymph node stages on a pathology report, the pathologist needs to have the
entire tumor and nearby lymph nodes to evaluate. This is most often from surgery aimed at curing the cancer,
not just a biopsy. Because a needle (or bronchoscopic) biopsy only samples part of the cancer, the cancer’s
stage is not reported for these types of biopsy."


Again, nothing of the sort you advocated as a possibility (i.e. they cease injections because they determined
the whole tumor was necrotic) have been reiterated by anyone else except NWBO longs. Researchers state
the reason injections are ceased from being given as due to "disease progression."


There was only one case study that showed measurable shrinkage of the injected lesion, and that was the
ovarian case. But unfortunately it did not stop a new lesion from taking hold and growing very nearby. I don't

see that as any sort of "disease control." As I said that's a treatment fail.


Let's look at an example of an IT inject therapy that did show good efficacy:


"Systemic high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) achieved long-term survival in a subset of patients with advanced
melanoma. The authors reported previously that intratumorally applied IL-2 induced complete local responses
of all metastases in >60% of patients.


Forty-eight of 51 patients were evaluable. Only grade 1/2 toxicity was recorded. A complete response that
lasted >/=6 months was documented in 70% of all injected metastases. A complete local response of all
treated metastases was achieved in 33 patients (69%), including 11 patients who had between 20 and 100
metastases."


Yes, "between 20 and 100 mets." Wow.


"The 2-year survival rate was 77% for patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and 53% for patients with stage IV
disease."


Yeah that's pretty great all around. And IL-2 is widely accessible. Do me a favor and show a stage IV
inoperable cancer patient the above data and then DCVax-Direct data and ask them to decide which THEY
would want to be treated with.


Back to necrosis, if that is what is truly desired then radiofrequency ablation is already approved for that.
Works very well at it! But there is debate as to whether or not necrosis is a desirable outcome, whereas
apoptosis always is:


"Authors believe that cancer is primarily a disorder of cell death rather than cell growth. There is a
consequence when cells don't die an apoptotic death. Cells release hazardous molecules when they die by
necrosis. A new theory describes that necrotic death and chronic inflammation may foster the onset and
growth of tumors."


http://bit.ly/1l3dLg8


Then you said:


"I am saying that the conclusions that you have come to are simply made too early since spacing of treatment
has everything to do with effect." -DL


You seem to place all weight on the P2 being where any real efficacy shows up. Okay, I guess we'll see, but
from what I've seen so far I don't really see how. The first three shots will probably all be spaced the same.
But more shots in the booster phase and spaced closer apart might actually improve efficacy. I personally just
don't think by much. And not by enough to thwart progression. Not in the injected lesions or elsewhere.

regulated by the absence of educated DCs because of this phenomenon, the entire immune response
becomes down regulated. This is what I expected to happen and why I lamented, in other previous posts, the
fact that FDA was initially interfering with spacing of treatments out of concern for safety and also why,
perhaps, the trial design included suboptimal spacing after week 2. While we wait for the upcoming
conference let's both hope for the best outcomes for cancer patients who are on these various experimental
treatments. Their welfare is much more important than our perspectives about the treatments. Best wishes.

Phase 5,


Actually if you did a little more research, you would find that actually PFS has been instrumental in numerous
accelerated approvals of cancer treatments. Here is an white paper on it:


Overview: Progression-Free Survival as an Endpoint in Clinical Trials with Solid Tumors by Ronald L. Korn
and John J. Crowley.


It has been used on numerous approvals, so to make the statements you have obviously shows that you do
not do your homework, which is apparent in your article.


Moreover, let me remind you that the standard of care for GBM is termizolomide, which was approved with
only 2 months increase in OS. GBM being such an aggressive disease, has a very low bar for approving
drugs, due to the severity of the disease. Now I am not saying DCVax-L is a sure thing, BUT, if the vaccine
has an effect on 30 - 40% of the patients, it means that achieving statistical significance will not require as
much as it would with a large difference in OS.

Bohsie, Contributor
Fred,


Please show the math and or where it states that the shares/warrants provided where bonus payments?


Show the math that proves that they are paying more for the vaccine that they should normally. Moreover, if
you knew more, you would know that the manufacturing of DCVax-L is considerably different than IMUC, and
more costly as it requires actual tumor cells from the patient to develop the vaccine. It is a personalized
vaccine, unlike the ICT-107, and therefore, due to that in itself requires a more costly manufacturing process.

Steve,


I thought you knew that the ICT-107 vaccine is considerably cheaper to manufacture than DCVax -L as it is
not personalized to the patients tumor. That has been the overwhelming upside all IMUC bulls use to argue
IMUC as being a better vaccine.

Thyfish
Bohsie, 
Well here is an example of a product more similar to the NWBO vaccine. It's the ARGS Arcelis platform, "the
process uses only a small tumor or blood sample along with the patient’s own dendritic cells, which are
collected and optimized following a single leukapheresis procedure." The manufacturing costs for the Phase 3
and commercialization are public and stated as such; 
PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL MANUFACTURING CONTRACT:  
200 to 400 Units Produced:  
$3,000,000 to $6,000,000  
COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING CONTRACT:  
2,500 to 5,000 Units


$38M to $75M / Yr.

Okay but here is the difference Thyfish. It sounds like this is a quote for manufacturing costs for a specific
manufacturing plant that is specific to the Arcelis platform, and it shows the same cost of ~$15k for each unit
produced no matter the size. There would be a differences due to economies of scale. More over, the burnt
rate for running a phase 3 trial is not solely manufacturing, as there is considerable costs in managing and
administration, particularly in having numerous locations of treatment, particularly if its in Europe and Canada
as well as the numerous hospitals in the US.

Not sure where Phase 5 crunches his numbers, but seems a little sketchy to me. From NWBO 10-K
(verbatim):


"For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company made cash payments of approximately
$18.7 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, to Cognate. A portion of the $18.7 million paid in 2014 was
payment for unpaid invoices from 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company owed Cognate $5.7
million and $3.6 million, respectively, for unpaid invoices for services performed by Cognate (including
manufacturing for both the Phase III and Phase I/II clinical trials, ongoing product and process development,
expansion of several company programs and services related to expansion of manufacturing capacity).


During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred non-cash equity based
compensation (restricted common stock and warrants) related to Cognate BioServices of $21.3 million and
$0, respectively. This equity compensation primarily involved one-time initiation payments of shares and
warrants relating to the four new agreements the Company entered into with Cognate in January, 2014. The
shares are vesting over a period of three years from the date of the agreements. The fair value calculation of

these shares was determined using the market price for tradable shares; however the shares issued to
Cognate were unregistered restricted shares. The equity compensation also included lock-up warrants (for
the lock-up of Cognate shares) and most favored nation shares and warrants.


For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, Cognate’s unpaid payables and accrued expenses
increased by $19.3 million (increase from 2013 to 2014) and $13.8 million (increase from 2012 to 2013),
respectively, as the Company launched and carried out its DCVax-Direct program, and expanded its DCVax-L
program.

Bohsie, Contributor
So Cognate being provided some cash, and alot of shares and warrants (remember they have to pay to have
a warrant rolled into a share), all at a ~$4 per share cost. So yes, the market rate may have been $9 - $12 at
the time, Cognate was locked into the shares for several years prior to being able to sell them, so there is a
huge risk for them to accept shares in lieu of payment. More over, Cognate has not only provided
manufacturing for both DcVax-L and Direct, they have done so from the very beginning, back in the late
2000s. Moreover, Cognate also has purchased land in Cambridge to expand to a facility in Europe. Cognate
is extremely intertwined into NWBO, and I would imagine that if NWBO's phase III is positive and becomes
approved, I could see NWBO purchasing Cognate which would quickly position NWBO with significant
manufacturing capabilities.


02 Nov 2015, 06:03 PM


Thyfish
Bohsie, 
I agree. I believe this is just for manufacturing and I do understand that there are substantial costs to the
administration of the trial. The point however is that NWBO is in an agreement with Cognate (for what
exactly?) which we obviously know has the potential for a huge conflict of interest. Because of this, they
should be as transparent as they come and they're not. So we sit here debating about how much and for what
Cognate is being paid!

Bohsie,


Here's a rundown of R&D as well as General & Administrative spending from inception to 2006, and then from
2007 on when the P3 really got started. But first their definitions:


"Research and development:


Discovery and preclinical research and development expenses include scientific personnel related salary and
benefit expenses, costs of laboratory supplies used in our internal research and development projects, travel,
regulatory compliance, and expenditures for preclinical and clinical trial operation and management when we
are actively engaged in clinical trials."

"General and administrative:


General and administrative expenses include administrative personnel related salary and benefit expenses,
cost of facilities, insurance, travel, legal support, property and equipment depreciation, amortization of stock
options and warrants, and amortization of debt discounts and beneficial conversion costs associated with the
Company’s debt financing."


from 1996 (inception) to Dec 2006: 
R&D: $36mm  
G&A: $33mm  
(no shares yet to Cognate)


from Dec 2006 to Dec 2007: 
R&D: $45mm (+$9mm from previous year) 
G&A: $40mm (+$7mm) 
(no shares yet to Cognate)


from Dec 2007 to Dec 2008: 
R&D: $57mm (+$12mm from previous year) 
G&A: $49mm (+$9mm) 
(no shares yet to Cognate but most of the $20mm in R&D went to them for making just 33 vaccines)


from Dec 2008 to Dec 2009: 
R&D: $67mm (+$10mm from previous year) 
G&A: $55mm (+$6mm) 
(NOW shares begin to go to Cognate but NO vaccine is being made and all trial sites have withdrawn)


from Dec 2009 to Dec 2010: 
R&D: $77mm (+$10mm from previous year) 
G&A: $62mm (+$7mm) 
(shares AND cash move to Cognate who exercises some on open market while STILL no vaccine is being
made and all trial sites have withdrawn)


from Dec 2010 to Dec 2011: 
R&D: $90mm (+$13mm from previous year) 
G&A: $75mm (+$13mm) 
(shares and cash move to Cognate who exercises some on open market while only 10-15 vaccines are made
and just 8 sites initiate screening, as revealed by the German label and SEC filings for that year)


from Dec 2011 to Dec 2012: 
R&D: $120mm (+$30mm from previous year) 
G&A: $91mm (+$16mm)


Now we see a real jump up in R&D as Cognate actually starts making a good amount of vaccine and more
trial sites open to enrollment. Buy the end of that year they will have made over 130 vaccines. Still, $30mm is
a lot.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 39/183


from Dec 2012 to Dec 2013: 
R&D: $163mm (+$43mm from previous year) 
G&A: $103mm (+$12mm)


More ramp up, over 140-150 vaccines made and more sites come on board over 2013 than did over 2012.


Now let's talk about how the above was broken down (2014-2015 will be put at the end).


(from 2011 10-k):


"During 2009, the Company and Cognate BioServices ("Cognate") agreed that most of the accounts payable
owed by the Company to Cognate, will be converted into shares of common stock instead of paid in cash.
The conversion price will be no less favorable than the conversion price applied to any other creditor of the
Company. The lowest conversion price applied to any other creditor of the Company to date following the
agreement is $0.20 per share. Accordingly, if no lower conversion price is applied to any other creditor prior to
completion of the Cognate conversion, the Cognate conversion will take place at $0.20 per share. The impact
of the conversion will result in a reduction of liabilities for the amount converted. In addition, the Company will
recognize the value of common stock issued in excess of the amount of accounts payable converted, if any,
as a charge to operations when the conversion takes place. Initial review of the payables by both parties
indicated a difference in the parties’ respective understanding of the amounts due. The parties have now
agreed that as of December 31, 2010 the amount due to Cognate is $10.2 million and the Company has
recognized $3.6 million in additional expense in 2010. Finalization of the conversion arrangements are in
process."


Okay, so we have the first work for shares issue to cover $13.8mm cost. Some of this was paid in cash and
the rest were converted to shares as:


"On November 23, 2011, the Company and Cognate executed the conversion of $9.2 million dollars of
amounts owed by the Company to Cognate Bioservices, Inc. into 46 million shares of common stock, using
the agreed upon conversion rate of $0.20 per share. The Company recognized a loss on conversion of $7.8
million, which was the difference between the market value of the shares and the carrying amount of the
liability. The Company and Cognate are continuing to negotiate the repayment terms of the outstanding
balance owed by the Company."


Those 46 million shares represented "29.15%" of the common stock.  
http://1.usa.gov/1Q8BTK7


Yes almost a THIRD of the common stock for $9mm. Pre-dilution days.


During 2009 and 2010 the company racked up debt because they were contractually obligated to Cognate,
even though no vaccine was made and the trial was suspended. Here are the subsequently mentioned
"RELATED service agreements":


"Under the service agreement, the Company agreed to utilize Cognate’s services for an initial two-year
period, related primarily to manufacturing DCVax product candidates, regulatory advice, research and
development preclinical activities and managing clinical trials. The agreement expired on July 30, 2006;
however, the Company continued to utilize Cognate’s services under the same terms as set forth in the
expired agreement. On May 17, 2007, the Company entered into a new service agreement with Cognate



http://1.usa.gov/1Q8BTK7

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 40/183


pursuant to which Cognate will provide certain consulting and, when needed, manufacturing services to the
Company for its DCVax -Brain Phase II clinical trial. Under the terms of the new contract, the Company paid a
non-refundable contract initiation fee of $250,000 and committed to pay budgeted monthly service fees of
$400,000, subject to quarterly true-ups, and monthly facility fees of $150,000."


That's $550K every month, all while they manufactured NO DCVax. That's why 2009 and 2010 R&D was
exactly $10mm even though there were no clinical sites and no vaccine made and the study was suspended.
$6mm of that went to those base fees and $4mm to extraneous fees.


They updated these agreements in 2011 and that's why the base fee goes down, but they make up for it in
charges per patient. The new agreement goes:


"In April, 2011, the Company entered into a new service agreement with Cognate, a contract manufacturing
and services organization in which Toucan Capital is a substantial shareholder. In addition, two of the
principals of Toucan Capital are members of Cognate’s board of directors and Linda Powers who is a director
of Cognate and managing director of Toucan Capital is the Chairperson of the Company’s Board of Directors
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. This agreement replaced the agreement dated May 17, 2007
between the Company and Cognate, which expired. Under the service agreement, the Company agreed to
continue to utilize Cognate’s services for certain consulting and manufacturing services to the Company for its
ongoing DCVax®-L Phase III clinical trial for GBM brain cancer. The types of services are comparable to the
prior agreement, and the structure and process for payments are simplified. Under the terms of the 2011
agreement, the Company pays Cognate a monthly facility fee and a fixed fee (in lieu of cost-plus charges) for
DCVax product made for each patient in the clinical trial, subject to a specified minimum number of patients
per month, plus charges for certain patient and product data services if such services are requested by the
Company."


So let's find out the actual breakdown for shares/cash:


"During the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, the Company recognized approximately
$7.8 million and $4.7 million of research and development costs RELATED to these service agreements. As
of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company owed Cognate approximately $10.2 and $0.6 million,
respectively."


That $10.2mm from 2009-2010 (when again they made no vaccine) was mostly paid for by that huge swath of
30% of the float worth of shares I mentioned above. Before this Cognate always got cash.


"During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$16.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of research and development costs RELATED to these service
agreements. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31 2011, the Company owed Cognate approximately
$1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively."


"On October 16, 2012, we entered into a conversion agreement with Cognate BioServices pursuant to which,
upon the closing of the public offering in December 2012, an aggregate of $7.5 million unpaid invoiced
amounts and payables were converted into equity."


So of the $16.5mm due Cognate in 2012, $14.7mm was paid, $7.5mm in shares and $7.2mm in cash, and
$1.8mm brought forward: http://1.usa.gov/1Q8BTKc



http://1.usa.gov/1Q8BTKc

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 41/183


So now we are up to $16.7mm paid Cognate in shares ($7.5mm here and the $9.2mm in exchange for 30%
of the float) and $7.2mm in cash plus cash payments over 2007 and 2008 ($70% of R&D for each year or
$14mm) or $21.2mm as of the end of 2012.


"For the year ended December 31, 2013 the Company recognized approximately $25.4 million of research
and development costs UNDER THESE SERVICE AGREEMENTS for that period as well as for certain one-
time charges (including charges relating to start-up and changes in the Company’s programs). For the year
ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized approximately $16.5 million of research and
development costs related to the service agreements. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the
Company owed Cognate (including third party sub-contract amounts) approximately $3.6 million and $3.3
million."


"On July 31, 2013, Cognate, a related party supplier, agreed to convert an aggregate of $11.6 million in
accounts payable into shares of common stock (“Conversion Transaction”) at a conversion price of $4.00 per
share, which resulted in the issuance of 2.9 million shares of common stock, subject to most favored nation
treatment with respect to the terms provided to any other investors or creditors."


So we have $25.4mm due Cognate, of which $11.6mm was paid in shares and $11.2mm in cash, and
$3.6mm brought forward.


Now we are at $28.2mm paid in shares and $32.4mm paid in cash.


"For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company made cash payments of approximately
$18.7 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, to Cognate. A portion of the $18.7 million paid in 2014 was
payment for unpaid invoices from 2013. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company owed Cognate $5.7
million and $3.6 million, respectively, for unpaid invoices for services performed by Cognate (including
manufacturing for both the Phase III and Phase I/II clinical trials, ongoing product and process development,
expansion of several company programs and services related to expansion of manufacturing capacity)."


"During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred non-cash equity based
compensation (restricted common stock and warrants) expense related to Cognate BioServices of $21.3
million and $0, respectively."


Now they do us the favor of actually breaking down cash vs shares. $21.3mm in shares and $18.7mm in
cash.


So that's $49.5mm paid Cognate in shares and $51.1mm paid in cash.


Now latest 10-q shows:


"For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for the two periods,
respectively, of approximately $21.3 million (with invoices generally being paid in all cash), and $12.4 million
(with invoices generally being paid half in cash and half in stock) to Cognate."


So that's $49.5mm paid in shares and $72.4mm paid in cash to Cognate to date (keep in mind DCVax-Direct
was DONE over the last half of 2014 and all of 2015).


Now let's find out how many shares Cognate has and how many they handed off for cash:

http://bit.ly/1Q8BTKf


The "buys" are conversions of warrants and the "sells" are just what they sound like, sales on the open
market or via a third party investor. Who then presumable sells on the open market. But whatever, they get
cash for all the "sells". So here it is (rounded down):


1.7mm @$4 = $6.8mm 
149k @ $5 = $745k 
145k @ $5.17 = $750k 
253k @ $3.64 = $920k 
79k @ $3.09 = $244k 
132k @ $3.09 = $407k 
233k @ $3.21 = $747k 
233k @ $3.21 = $747k (not a repeat)


Total of $11,360,000


So our grand total is $49.5mm paid in shares of which 2.8 million of those shares has been CONVERTED into
$11.3mm cash (1/4 of what was "owed") even though their shares held has only ever increased to 20.2 million
until very recently when it dropped to 18.4 million shares held. Not a bad deal! Gotta love those warrants ;)
And also $83.7mm has been paid to them in cash.


So if we subtract the exercised and sold off warrants they are "back owed" $38.2mm that has been paid them
in shares and have made $83.7mm in cash for making vaccine for 40 DCVax-Direct patients and prob around
400 DCVax-L patients (considering baseline 2 fails, etc). Yep that's right, 18 million shares with a $38.2 million
balance. A few more big sells like that last one and the rest is gravy.


What did Linda Powers say again?


"It’s purely a function of dollars and time. The dollars to conduct the prostrate trial phase 3 is 35 to 40 mil, for
brain, it’s 10 to 15 million which is an utterly different scale of resources to come up with."


Whereas from 2006 to today the R&D expense has been $85mm for 2014, $49mm for half of 2015 and
$127mm from 2007-2013, or $261mm. A little more than $10mm-$15mm!!


There ya go buddy, there's an hour and a half of my time lol.


Imo, and as the last massive swath of shares would attest to, you will probably see Cognate off load more
and more the closer they get to P3 conclusion. That will far more than pay for what was "owed" them, which
was evidently already inflamed. They can get away with that because of the Powers-Powers relationship
between NWBO-Cognate.


I'm going to respond to something else you wrote here, where you showed a P3 trial on average costs
$100mm. That's true for the average P3 SIZE which is in the thousands of patients (over 2,000). This trial was
meant to enroll 240, then less than 312, and now 380ish (348 main cohort and 32 psPD). The per patient cost
for an average P3 is actually right around $50k: http://bit.ly/1Q8BR59


If you get the report you'll see that the highest upper bound was around $75k/patients. Even if we assume
$100k/patient in the DCVax study the whole P3 should cost $42mm WITH the DCVax-Direct P2 thrown in.

How have they spent $261mm on just the P3 and P1/2? And it's not even complete yet. And how is it $84mm
in cash and $38mm in shares have been paid to Cognate for making at MOST 500 vaccines?? And who
knows how many of those 18 million shares left may wind up netting Cognate.


There is definitely something off going on here. Especially when IMUC can have vaccine made for 278
patients AND run a large multi site P2 with a CRO for $14mm TOTAL.


See no evil?

Bohsie, Contributor
Steve,


Again, that $10 - 15 Million is not an overall cost. That is most likely the quarterly burn rate. Oncology Phase
3 Trials cost on average, ~ $75M - $100M or more, so to say a personalized vaccine phase 3 trial for GBM
should only cost $15M is absurd. This is obviously taken out of context. Also, since GBM is much less rare
than prostate cancer, a trial for prostate cancer would require much more than ~300 patients to receive FDA
approval, and that is another reason such a Phase III Prostate Trial would cost 3 times more.

Steven Giardino, Contributor
Bohsie,


C'mon that was a lot of work right there for you to just dismiss! LP said what she said. And this is a VERY
small P3 relative to the norm. You have to figure it by way of per patient cost. The average for P3 2 years ago
was $50k/patient. For 348 patients that should be $17.4mm.


Most P3's are over 2,000 patients...


03 Nov 2015, 10:52 AM


Matt_PK
I can tell you from personal experience managing trials that $50K is not a bad estimate. A lot depends on
imaging and diagnostic testing as those can add cost rapidly. I have run Phase III trials as cheaply as $20K
per patient and have seen a few that have gone well above $75K.


However, don't forget that these are variable costs of the trial. The company still has to do its quarterly
accounting, it still had to pay overhead, and a lot of costs that do not vary with patient count (like a Regulatory
Department) are generally not included in the per patient cost, and those costs happen as the calendar pages
flip which is why it is so important to run trials efficiently. You have to pay the overhead whether you are
enrolling patients or not.

Matt,


Thanks for chiming in. So you would say running a 40 patient P1/2 and a so far enrolled 300 patient P3
costing so far $261mm is way too steep? At $70k a patient the above should cost 1/10 of that.


Thanks

Doc logic
Thyfish,


I feel your pain but as a one time small business owner, which I sold for a profit, I know that Linda is smart to
keep her costs hidden as well as possible. NWBO needs a price cushion to compete longer term and Linda
needed a cushion to keep the company in her hands. If Linda had charged less for the product, Cognate
would not have been able to finance NWBO. You would have seen a bankrupt company or a company that
could not finish their trials because only poor financing options would have been available. That would have
meant good science bought cheap and developed for someone else's profit or buried just like happened with
synthetic rubber patents before WW ll ended the rubber plantation owners monopoly. This is the system in
place that Larry has been constantly reminding new and older investors of for quite a while now. You can go
back to some of my earliest and more recent posts about NWBO to see that I regularly have mentioned
DNDN price action around the time of regulatory reviews as evidence of this.


I do not always write glowing comments about this company because the limited perspective that we have as
group of retail investors leaves us all vulnerable to different measures of doubt about company actions or
inaction. I certainly have an extremely confident long term view of this company because of my due diligence
and conclusions that I make from it but I am a weird investor. I don't take profits until I must with any expiring
call options I have. My shares are being held and position added to as opportunities have presented
themselves. I have held through the highs and lows and received calls from my broker about buying
insurance from the other side of the option trade. I have refused twice now becsuse the price action of this
stock has been acting as I originally expected it to and from all the evidence that I have seen lately, we are
about to see a nice DNDN like pop in the price very soon. This is just my perspective and not advice which is
different than what others find.


An eagle has a different perspective than a worm and they both act on what information they have to benefit
from it. Best wishes.

Check IMUC's estimate for ICT107 at ~ $60M for a 587 patient Ph3 trial. And ICT107 is suppose to cost a
fraction of the manufacturing costs of DCVax-L. I agree with Matt, overhead costs, and trial costs are probably

more in tuned with how many hospitals are required to be in the trial as opposed to how many patients. GBM
is also a rare disease, and therefore, running a trial in just several Populated City Hospitals is not enough to
get a fast enough enrollment. With diseases that effect more people, only several large hospitals may be
required to get the enrollment. GBM sees only 12,000 - 14,000 cases a year in the US, and its not all in one
spot. And with the specific criteria to enter the study, it makes it even more difficult.


More over, most Phase 3 Trials are not also extended overseas into numerous countries, such as Germany &
the UK. To be honest, I look at what L. Powers has done, and she has applied a business acumen and
strategy to a start-up Biotech company. Yes, of course it all depends on the phase 3 results, but if they are
positive then NWBO is positioned extremely well to commercialize and cash in.


That is why I have said from the beginning. If I had only $5K to invest in something, I would do so in NWBO.
Yes its a big risk, but the rewards to me are much more great. If successful, that $5000 which relates to ~
1000 shares, could jump up to ~$100 - $250/share easily (see PUMA Biotech), though in my opinion it could
be much more. That translates to ~$100K - $250K. Now, I would rather do that then invest it in Apple, and get
$7,000 in 3 years or Kite, or Juno and maybe get $15K if they are successful.


This is what I kept telling people. Its not that I am positive NWBO is going to succeed, I dont know for sure, no
one does, but if they do, L. Powers has positioned them to see a substantial jump in share price. And L
Powers doesnt cash in big unless that happens, no matter if she has just been funneling money to herself
somehow. I look at the decisions she has made and they have a strategic purpose. Everything down to
redoing the trial in terms of PFS as a primary endpoint and having a placebo crossover which could mean the
OS difference isnt as great because DCVax-L has increased OS in placebo and initial vaccinated patients.

Bohsie you are the man. Queue Steven's (Pyrr) rebuttal to you soon. It will be an extremely long aka trying
too hard novel of drivel that he thinks is genius. It will say everything wrong with NWBO in 10,000 words even
though it could have been said in 100. And then at the end because he has no conviction he will say he may
be taking a long position soon, it will make total sense...Can't wait to read it!

Bohsie,


I think you and I just read what Mark wrote differently. He confirmed $50k a patient was a good est and that
$75k was about the highest he has seen. The report I linked you to said the same as of two years ago. He
only mentioned there are of course other expenses than running the trial and manufacturing to running a
biotech. That's one reason I included "general and administrative" expenses which from 1996 to 2006 totaled
$33mm but then tripled from there by end 2012 to over $90mm. That's a lot for 6-7 employees and some legal
spending over 6 years, but whatever.


So I just can't agree or see how anyone can say this trial had been paid for expeditiously. $261mm spent on
making vaccine for and enrolling 300 patients into a, yes, international P3 trial, and 40 patients into a P1/2 at

two sites all while racking up over $120mm in G&A over the same time period imo represents irresponsible
spending. I know they could have gotten it done for much cheaper. $130mm of the $261mm went right to
Cognate, with over $80mm of that in cash.


IMUC stating $60mm for 587 patients and that seems about right when considering they will probably make
1,000 vaccines or more all said and done. And that's still less than 1/4 of what NWBO has spent on their P3
so far.


$130mm to Cognate for at MOST 500 vaccines is just wrong. It's wrong to do that to shareholders.


Speaking of, yeah $5k doesn't sound like a lot, but let's talk percentages. Would you agree anything more
than 5% of a person's savings into NWBO is irresponsible investing? Or any speculative biotech for that
matter? With very rare exception I would say that it is. But people like TC_Trader up there has said he has
ALL of his savings in NWBO. Other longs repeat that refrain. They think this is the closest thing to a sure bet
they have seen. That's absurdly irresponsible.


But hey, it's their money. Though as far as me putting 5% or 1% even I wouldn't hold through P3 data. I'm in
for a trade as of today but prob won't be staying past summer, and def not past next fall. I just don't think
they'll meet the primary ep. I think the writing is on the wall.


So I've mentioned other places where I think that money is more wisely invested and has at least the same
upside potential. ACHN being one. I also like RUSL quite a bit. ICPT too. RMTI even. They're all better imo
than NWBO.


As with all things time will tell.

One of my other points, that I havent stated is, with the continual attacks/mistrust/articles that have come out
stating that L. Powers is funneling money and cash illegally into Cognate, I need to step back and think,
Would someone continue to do such a thing, with a Publicly traded company, with sooo many eyes, shorts
and lawyers shifting through every piece of information in order to find something and send you to jail?


Usually when illegal activity occurs, it isn't evident, its hidden quite well, and for something as big as is
suggested by Adam F., all the lawyers, bloggers, writers, stating that L.Powers , Cognate, Toucan, Woodford,
are all working in a cahoots, sifting cash and money into their bank accounts from the shareholders, seems
almost too incredible. I think that the SEC, the lawyers, etc... would have found at least one type of smoking
bullet, something to at least cause the SEC, or the authorities to do an investigation. Remember, Enron hide
their "illegal activities" so well, it wasnt figured out until the were left with a house of cards, and they even had
to get other parties like their accounting firm to even cook the books.


I just don't see this being some L. Powers illegal pyramid scheme as "clearly" as all the proponents of NWBO
does. There is too many eyes on NWBO's every move so it seems like it would be a suicide mission to try
anything illegal.

Bohsie, Contributor
Steve,


First: I am assuming your $130M paid to Cognate includes the $4 shares/warrants. If that is the case, those
warrants require Cognate to purchase into shares, and moreover, they are not able to sell them on the open
market for another couple years, perhaps 2017. So to say that $130M worth of manufacturing was done, is
probably not the case, there has to be some type of substantial risk fee attached to it.


Secondly: Just checked the 10-Ks and this is what I have for R&D expenditures since 2011; $171M, which I
would assume includes all the $130M to Cognate, but in terms of warrants and shares not cash. And then
from inception, 1996 - 2014, the total R&D costs are $291M so another $120M. This included numerous trials,
2 Phase I/II trials, a phase III trial, and a couple trials that were eventually halted due to insufficient funds. The
DCVax-L trial was also placed on hold during the Great Recession, so much of the costs to ramp up that
phase III trial had to be refunded in 2010 when it was started back up.

fault as anyone else's I'm sure).

The first of your two replies above is basically saying no way LP would do anything illegal here. And I agree.
What she has done is entirely legal, but so are many injustices in the world. Another thing that's legal and
happens all the time is to form a shell company with a no longer used or desired product, re label and hype it
up, get investors to pour in money, dilute the float continuously and by doing so take that money from them,
and then when the previously ditched therapy shows no effect in a CONTROLLED study (after many years of
single arm stuff) close up shop. I think what's happening here is similar to that.


Remember $9mm could have bought you 30% of the common as recently as 2010 here. Woodford has 28%
of the common but it cost him $140mm. That's rampant dilution.


So no, it's all legit but that doesn't mean any of the spending by NWBO has been ethically sound.


Your next comment I'm sorry to say shows you either didn't read my long post above or misunderstood parts
of it (which may be my fault). It's VERY clear exactly how many shares went to Cognate and for how much
cash they represented and how much cash went to Cognate. If you re-read the portions of SEC filings I
posted from 2006-2015 you'll see them all. When taken together Cognate was paid shares for $49mm worth
of debt owed them and $72mm in straight cash from 2007-mid 2015.


This trial started in 2007, treated 33 patients (some in the info arm), and was suspended from late 2008 until
May 2011, even though Cognate was still paid $10mm a year in 2009 and another $10mm in 2010. So much
for them doing any favors, or as longs like to believe, "kept NWBO from going bankrupt." Actually it was
Cognate and Linda Power's influence that almost bankrupted NWBO on a few occasions. Cognate (and so
majority owner Linda Powers) squeezed every last drop out of NWBO even when they made no vaccine and
all trial sites had withdrawn and no other trials were ongoing.


Also I linked you to the Nasdaq site that shows many of the Cognate sells. There are loopholes in the filings
that have allowed them to sell portions of their holdings. They off loaded 2.8 million shares and received over
$11mm cash for them. So the cash they received is actually $83.7mm. And the 20.2 million shares they had,
which they received for $49mm worth of debt are worth $100mm on today's market. They will be able to off
load more and more of them before the P3 concludes.


So when you write: "Just checked the 10-Ks and this is what I have for R&D expenditures since 2011; $171M,
which I would assume includes all the $130M to Cognate, but in terms of warrants and shares not cash."


I find it frustrating because you must not even be reading what I'm posting. Please go back and read through
it all and you will see exactly how much went to them in shares and for how much debt owed, and how much
straight cash.


From 2007-2015 the only trials they conducted are the current P3 and the DCVax Direct P1/2. Also most of
those P1/2 you mentioned they either co sponsored or didn't pay at all for, only licensed the tech later when
no one else would.


So please, take a minute and actually read through that post and see all the quotes sections of past SEC
filings I provided and also shares sold off by Cognate and you will see exactly what happened.


Thanks and GL

Bohsie, Contributor
Steve,


I just read your post, all of it, and I think you may have missed what I am saying in mine. The share values
paid to Cognate should not be taken $1 for $1 in terms of manufacturing costs. Let's assume that NWBO is
actually paying them for manufacturing, SOP development, commercialization, CGMP standards and
documentation all for the phase III trial. No matter what, Cognate is receiving a share that they can not excise
until a much later date, or a warrant that they need to pay into to convert to a share before even having the
ability to exercise it.


Secondly, I looked into the Cognate Insider sale of $11M, and yes, I admit, this made me nervous at first, until
I did some more research, and will have to find the link, BUT, with some explanation, that sale will look less
"suspect". If you see when that sale took place, shares were valued in the $12 - 10 a share range, however,
Cognate sold ~$2M for ~ $11M, which is the $4.40 a share trigger that they were provided a while back. This
was a sell it at $4.40 or lose it type of deal if I remember correctly. If Cognate was selling on the open market,
they wouldn't have made $11M but rather ~$17M - $20 Million. So here is another fact that can easily be
twisted from the real truth.


And thirdly, Cognate, for a company that supposedly is cashing in on extremely high manufacturing costs,
decided to spend Millions of dollars to purchase land in Cambridge for a European Manufacturing Facility in
the heart of the Cambridge Biotech Industry. So Cognate truly is putting money where NWBO's mouth is. And
they did this prior to P3 results. Thats a pretty big leap of faith, as their core business hasnt grown that much
that they are just planning to expand overseas. Its targeted to support NWBO products.


04 Nov 2015, 12:30 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
Steve,


BELOW IS SPELL OUT EXACTLY HOW WRONG YOU ARE ON THE AMOUNTS PAID TO COGNATE!


You state: "And the 20.2 million shares they had, which they received for $49mm worth of debt are worth
$100mm on today's market."


However, if you read the 10K's thoroughly:


"Approximately 14,261,000 warrants issued to Cognate BioServices, during the 7 years 2008 through 2014,
with a weighted average exercise price and remaining contractual term of $4.00 and 3.8 years, respectively."


So let's do the math, 14M shares, at an exercise price of $4, means that Cognate needs to pay NWBO back,
$56M just to turn these warrants into shares. So if these shares are worth $5/share of today's price, that
means Cognate has a whopping: 14M x $5 = $70M Wow, Woah, wait a minute. These are warrants, so then,
let's deduct the exercising price, of 14M shares x $4.00/share = $56M, which gives them a total of $14M since
2008. WOW!!!! And you say I don't do my homework. Cognate received $14M + $72M of straight cash (I will
look this up, as well). So ~$86M for a phase 3 and a phase I/II trial. Seems reasonable, particularly since it
looks like Cognate has done more than just manufacture.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 50/183


Moreover, as it states, there is a 4 year period that they eventually expire, which could move into 2018 if it
was all given in 2014. However, the term was extended if you look even deeper in the 10K. So NO, Cognate
has not received $100M of shares/warrants since 2008.


This is where i drop the keyboard and walk away..... :)

Steven Giardino, Contributor
Lol Bohsie I'm not going to bother correcting any of that. I hope your $5k turns into a million :)


04 Nov 2015, 02:53 PM


Doc logic
Bohsie,


Good job explaining that part of Steve's argument. I remember seeing all of those agreements and doing the
leg work to figure it out back then but did not keep those notes and was too lazy to go back through it again it
again to make a point. There is still some cushion left in the numbers, though Bohsie, and I believe it is to be
able to buy back those options and warrants to keep firm control of the company in Linda's hands when the
company is standing on solid ground. In the mean time she has had the cash available for any small bail out
needed.


The time that Cognate continued to receive payments without needing to make treatments was a critical time
for Linda and her hopes for NWBO. She did what she needed to do for her family and original investors by
getting their investment better secured through the downturn. I did not invest until 2012 at about the double
bottom when NWBO was still an OTC penny stock. A lesser talent at the helm during the downturn would
have meant bankruptcy but even with these payments to Cognate during the down time, Linda managed to
keep NWBO afloat. This wss no easy task and good evidence for me, when I initiated my position, that Linda
could and would find a way to get NWBO to the finish line. We are getting closer. Best wishes.


04 Nov 2015, 03:00 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
Not going to do the leg work to correct any of that? Because there is no correcting, those numbers come
straight from the 2014 10K! Wow, I mean, if I am wrong about something, I am the first to admit it.


Okay so here are some more numbers from the rest of the 10Ks:


Annual R&D Spending (which is what Cognate Payments would roll under)


2014 $85M 
2013 $44M 
2012 $29M 
2011 $13.4M 
2010 $9.9M 
2009 $9.6M

2008 $12.7M 
2007 $8.8M 
2006 $3.8M 
1996 - 2005 $31.7M


For a total of $247.9M, now, not all of this went to Cognate, and much of this is based on valuation (or the
estimation usually using the Black-Scholes model for warrants) of shares/warrants at the time of the debt
conversion. Moreover, most of the shares provided had some sort of warrant conversion %, and they werent
your normal shares, they were restricted shares that could not be sold until 2016- 17, and probably even
further down the line now. As you can see the R&D costs recently are much greater which makes sense due
to the trials being run, however, there is more to R&D costs than just the manufacturing.


The only cash payments I found to Cognate was in 2014 and 2013 of $18.7M and $12.4M respectively. 2014
was higher as it caught up on owed 2013 Cognate expenses.


R&D in 2013 - 2014 included the following activities:"manufacturing for both the Phase III and Phase I/II
clinical trials, ongoing product and process development, expansion of several company programs and
services related to expansion of manufacturing capacity). 
Again, let me remind you that Cognate managed, trained scaled up and supervised the processing in London,
as well as Germany.


In 2012, $22.8 million in cash was primarily use jump from 25 to 42 clinical trial sites, recruiting, expansion of
manufacturing activities and capacity in Europe.


In 2011 - Cognate increased its manufacturing capability from 600 patients to 5,000 patients (it targeted 9,000
in the 10K but fell short by 4,000 as I read in recent 10Ks). Developed a partial automation process using a
TFF System which was cleared by FDA for Direct Phase I trials and eventually the -L P3 as well.


So as you can see, there was much more than just "Manufacturing Costs going on.". I would say that the
$85M of R&D costs in 2013 - 2014 was regarding Direct & -L Trials, and again, if you take away the amount
Cognate would need to pay to convert their warrants into shares, that $85M is no longer as high.


I would like someone to try and convince any Big Pharma company to take that kind of deal for manufacturing
a vaccine for Clinical Trials. The more I dig, the more I realize that the partnership NWBO has with Cognate,
and the savings they have made by pushing "payments" into the future, and therefore saving on present day
operating costs, is an amazing deal.


Yes, one could say they are diluting shares, however, they have stayed on their own feet, and the payback
had NWBO partnered with a Big Pharma to cover these costs, would not be as great. With manufacturing
capabilities, and if P3 is successful, the potential of the share price could easily hit $500 a share (this is
assuming several years of revenue growth from DCVax-L and Direct). This wouldn't be the case with Big
Pharma, as Big Pharma would be looking at getting their payback.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 52/183


Listen I'm going to help you out here one more time, then that's it.


NWBO has to tell you how much they paid Cognate via their agreements with them in shares. And they have
to tell you the total. Then they have to tell you the balance forward. What is not expressly stated there is the
cash payment. So for instance:


During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$16.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of research and development costs RELATED to these service
agreements. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31 2011, the Company owed Cognate approximately
$1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively."


"On October 16, 2012, we entered into a conversion agreement with Cognate BioServices pursuant to which,
upon the closing of the public offering in December 2012, an aggregate of $7.5 million unpaid invoiced
amounts and payables were converted into equity."


Means of the $16.5mm due Cognate in 2012, $14.7mm was paid via $7.5mm in shares according to the price
of the agreement and $7.2mm in CASH and $1.8mm as debt brought forward.


That's how you read a financial statement.


When you add up the TOTAL stated as due Cognate "related to the service agreements" you come up with
$122mm. The amount given for shares totals $49.5mm. The REST was paid in cash: $72.4mm. That's
revealed through the balance due statements like the $1.8mm and $0.6mm cited above.


Then Cognate has turned around and swapped out shares for cash with third parties for $11mm. They had a
high of 20.2 mil shares and right now have 18 mil. So YES they can continue to trade those for cash via
certain loopholes in the agreement. Most all of the shares will be able to be traded in late 2016 btw. So the
closer you get to the P3 concluding the more you will likely see these shares being dumped.


And Doc what craziness are you saying that all this fleecing of shareholders was necessary to keep the
company from hostile takeover?! Really please..


And lastly B your total costs are all wrong. No idea what line you are adding up but again I listed the total
Research and Development cost and General and Administrative costs since inception:


rom 1996 (inception) to Dec 2006: 
R&D: $36mm  
G&A: $33mm


from Dec 2006 to Dec 2007: 
R&D: $45mm (+$9mm from previous year) 
G&A: $40mm (+$7mm)


from Dec 2007 to Dec 2008: 
R&D: $57mm (+$12mm from previous year) 
G&A: $49mm (+$9mm)


from Dec 2008 to Dec 2009: 
R&D: $67mm (+$10mm from previous year)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 53/183


G&A: $55mm (+$6mm)


from Dec 2009 to Dec 2010: 
R&D: $77mm (+$10mm from previous year) 
G&A: $62mm (+$7mm)


from Dec 2010 to Dec 2011: 
R&D: $90mm (+$13mm from previous year) 
G&A: $75mm (+$13mm)


from Dec 2011 to Dec 2012: 
R&D: $120mm (+$30mm from previous year) 
G&A: $91mm (+$16mm)


from Dec 2012 to Dec 2013: 
R&D: $163mm (+$43mm from previous year) 
G&A: $103mm (+$12mm)


from Dec 2013 to Dec 2014: 
R&D: $247mm (+$84mm from previous year) 
G&A: $115 (+$12mm)


from Dec 2014 to Jun 2015: 
R&D: $296mm (+$49mm from previous year) 
G&A: $127mm (+$12mm)


$122mm of that R&D went to Cognate as $49mm worth of shares (valued at all different prices, pre and post
split) which have ended up totaling 20.2 million (so avg price of about $2.50 a share), and $73mm in cash. Of
the 20.2 million shares they sold 2.8 million to third parties and got $11mm for them (again at various prices).
That's how a loophole works.


So total cash: $83.7mm and they have 18 million shares left a various strikes (mostly over $4). That's a other
potential $72mm waiting on the wings.


Linda said this P3 would cost $10mm-$15mm. At 300 enrolled and a 40 patient Direct P1 they have spent
almost $300mm.


In fact there is something I haven't even mentioned here and that is the remaining $180mm in R&D spending
ALSO went largely to Cognate through various extraneous expenses NOT outlined in the "agreement."
Maybe I'll take another hour and a half and parse all that out for you next ;)


These are just facts man, it's right before your eyes.

Btw Bohsie any increase in manufacturing by Cognate or any land they have purchased or employees hired
or equipment bought had nothing to do with NWBO or their shareholders. It's all owned and paid for by
Cognate. The ONLY agreement NWBO has with Cognate is manufacturing for this trial. So whatever money

Cognate has used for such expansion from the exorbitant sums they have gotten away with charging NWBO
shareholders for their services (via the Linda Powers (majority owner Cognate) - Linda Powers (majority
owner NWBO relationship) conflict of interest relationship--even $20mm over 2009-2010 when making NO
VACCINE), is theirs to with as they wish. NWBO has no stake in anything Cognate has. That means you as a
shareholder have no stake in it.


They revealed the truth of that matter in the most recent 10-k:


"The manufacturing of our product candidates will have to be greatly scaled up for commercialization, and
neither we nor other parties in the industry have experience with such scale-up.


As is the case with any clinical trial, our Phase III clinical trial of DCVax-L for GBM involves a number of
patients that is a small fraction of the number of potential patients for whom DCVax-L may be applicable in the
commercial market. The same will be true of our other clinical programs with our other DCVax product
candidates. If our DCVax-L, and/or other DCVax product candidates, are approved for commercial sale, it will
be necessary to greatly scale up the volume of manufacturing, far above the level needed for the trials.
Neither we nor our contract manufacturers have experience with such scale-up. In addition, there are very
few consultants or advisors in the industry who have such experience and can provide guidance or
assistance, because active immune therapies such as DCVax are a fundamentally new category of product in
two major ways: these active immune therapy products consist of living cells, not chemical or biologic
compounds, and the products are personalized. To our knowledge, no such products have successfully
completed the necessary scale-up for commercialization without material difficulties. For example, Dendreon
Corporation has encountered substantial difficulties trying to scale up the manufacturing of its Provenge®
product for commercialization.


The necessary specialized facilities, equipment and personnel may not be available or obtainable for the
scale-up of manufacturing of our product candidates.


The manufacture of living cells requires specialized facilities, equipment and personnel which are entirely
different than what is required for the manufacturing of chemical or biologic compounds. Scaling up the
manufacturing of living cell products to volume levels required for commercialization will require enormous
amounts of these specialized facilities, equipment and personnel - especially where, as in the case of our
DCVax product candidates, the product is personalized and must be made for each patient individually. Since
living cell products are so new, and have barely begun to reach commercialization, the supply of the
specialized facilities, equipment and personnel needed for them has not yet developed. It may not be possible
for us or our manufacturers to obtain all of the specialized facilities, equipment and personnel needed for
commercialization of our DCVax product candidates. This could delay or halt our commercialization."

Steve,


Now you are grasping at straws. I am not saying NWBO is going to cash in on the land Cognate buys, IT
SHOWS THAT COGNATE HAS SKIN IN THE GAME! THEY ARE INVESTING IN NWBO's SUCCESS! Sorry
had to caps lock that.

Second, yes Cognate sold $11M of "lose them or sell them shares " at $4.40 a share, instead of selling them
on the open market for almost 3 times that. Yes, that is definitely them siphoning cash! Or a stupid way to do
it.


AND THEN AGAIN! Actually it doesn't state at all that the rest was paid in Cash. You take a very big
assumption there that was the case. See excerpt from the same 10K you quoted:


"During 2012, the Company converted notes payable of $27.8 million into approximately 7.5 million shares of
common stock. The Company also issued approximately 4.7 million warrants to purchase common stock in
connection with the conversion of notes payable during 2012. Certain notes were converted under
inducement agreements during 2012 and as such, the difference between the fair value of the 10.1 million
shares of common stock and 3.8 million warrants issued in excess of the fair value of securities issuable
pursuant to original conversion terms amounted to $9.1 million and was recorded as conversion inducement
expense in 2012. The fair value of the common stock issued in connection with the inducement agreements
was valued after determining a 14% discount from the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the
date the stock was issued for lack of marketability. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate – 0.4%, volatility – 65%, expected
term – 5 years, expected dividends – N/A. The principal and accrued interest payable converted to common
stock during 2011 amounted to $4.8 million. "


You state that the other $7.55M was cash, IT WASN'T!


Prior to the $7.5M of shares/warrants that was provided, it states that 1.437M shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $6.40 as well as additional warrants were also provided. So again NOT CASH!!!


So again, the amount of shares and warrants that were given to Cognate in lieu of cash IS NOT A
REFLECTION OF THE TRUE MANUFACTURING COSTS. Its like when you go to buy a new car. If you pay
cash, $8K is taken of the cost, but if you finance, or lease, that $8K is deducted. Whatever the manufacturing
costs truly were, Cognate and NWBO sat down, developed an agreement to convert owed debt into
shares/warrants. And I am betting Cognate wasn't giving the CASH discount cost, when evaluating how many
shares/warrants to convert into the $16M.


Again, that is why taking those Cognate Costs as straight $1 for $1 manufacturing is not correct. And Cognate
doesn't or hasn't actually received very much CASH at all to date. Again these are RESTRICTED SHARES &
WARRANTS, meaning THEY ARENT ABLE TO SELL THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET AND/OR HAVE TO
PAY TO CONVERT THE WARRANTS.


And YES Cognate sold $11M at $4.40 a share, this wasnt on the open market. It was a lose it or sell it deal.


If NWBO went bankrupt today, Cognate would be caught holding the bag, with nothing in it. And they
differently did not get $83M of cash. If anything, they could be out significants sums if NWBO doesn't
succeed.


Moreover, you can even find several years where Cognate bought shares of NWBO, as well as NWBO
provided shares/warrants to a thrid party that Cognate owed. By no means has there been a funneling of
cash into Cognate.

Bohsie, Contributor
Maybe I need to drop out, its obvious no matter what facts are used, you have in your mind that Cognate got
all this cash. I dont even think NWBO had $83M of cash on hand to be able to do that, let alone pay for any of
the other general/admin expenses.


I have to admit Steve, I am a little disappointed in you. You seem to still take the same stance, even though
the facts are against you. No matter what, I doubt any Biotech company would sign up for the type of
agreement Cognate did with NWBO. Its evident that they are invested in NWBO's success. Their 20M shares
are worthless if DCVax isnt positive. But to try and spin the numbers to say Cognate has cashed in, or to
equate the expense equivalent of agreement amounts of restricted shares/warrants is the same if they paid
Cognate cash for the manufacturing is absurd. Cognate isnt stupid, they are going to add some risk overhead
onto the agreement amounts.


AND ONE LAST CORRECTION, THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN NWBO AND COGNATE ISNT JUST FOR
THE TRIAL. Read the 10K,s you will see that part of the agreement was increasing manufacturing capability
from 600 to 5,000 patients a year. That means Cognate had to pay fixed costs to expand their manufacturing
capabilities as they now have 5,000 a year capability. Again, additional costs other than just the trial
manufacturing.


 
AND YOUR QUOTE: 
"Linda said this P3 would cost $10mm-$15mm. At 300 enrolled and a 40 patient Direct P1 they have spent
almost $300mm. "


Talk about spin factor. They spent ~$287M since inception. Since 2010 when the trials started its in the
$110M, AND AGAIN, this is not actual cash that was spent! Its the amount estimated amount Cognate
estimated (or invoiced) knowing that they were going to be paid in shares/warrants.


Again, Ford will invoice me $30K - $8K if I pay cash, or they will invoice me $30K if I pay with a loan or a
lease. Same with Cognate. If NWBO was paying cash, I am sure that $110M would have been much less.

My god man you're so confused! You don't even know what conversion agreements are do you? And no
those 7.5 mil shares as part of the conversion agreement due to the 1 for 16 split have nothing to do with the
$7.5mm or so in cash they were paid that year.


No time to write more now but I'll thoroughly thrash this drivel in the morning over coffee ;)


If you feel disappointment it should be over your own self due to your confirmation bias which is running full
blast here.

Hey Doc, 
I appreciate your perspective and knowledge regarding NWBO. I just find all of the excuses to be speculative
and self serving for NWBO. There are many smallcap bios that manage to get through Clinical Trials without
rewarding themselves exponentially and keeping everything a giant secret.


When a man robs a bank to feed his family, do the courts take that into account when sentencing him or
judging his act? If NWBO couldn't raise funds then they should be transparent about the situation and the
subsequent deal they did with Cognate and let investors decide for themselves. Instead everyone makes wild
speculative guesses as to why the company doesn't operate above board, and that may have cost us the
financing and funding at better rates and with less dilution that we needed.


Unlike others, I don't care that Linda invested in this company, if it wasn't her it could have been someone
else that did a better job. She isn't the first venture capitalist to purchase a company at an extremely
discounted rate. If the therapy is what it is supposed to be, there would have been a line up to purchase it for
what they got it for. it's public company and if she didn't need the market then she should have bought it out
and taken it private.

The continual delays, missed timelines, and unanswered questions from a lack of transparency should cause
any investor pause for thought. It increases the risk associated with this investment, period. We should have
access to much more information then they have made public.

Bohsie,


Alright this may get a little long but Ima repost your quotes to make it cohesive.


"I am not saying NWBO is going to cash in on the land Cognate buys, IT SHOWS THAT COGNATE HAS
SKIN IN THE GAME! THEY ARE INVESTING IN NWBO's SUCCESS! Sorry had to caps lock that." --Bohsie


This was your reply to my saying what Cognate spends money on is to benefit Cognate, not NWBO. And I
stand by that remark. There are certain increase manufacturing agreements but they only refer to clinical trial
development (DCVax-L P3 and DCVax-Direct P1) and in no way refer to manufacturing on a commercial
scale. That's why in the latest 10-K (put out April 2015) there is that disclaimer that says they have NOT
secured that level of manufacturing with Cognate yet, and may never. I'll repost the most relevant parts:


"The manufacturing of our product candidates will have to be greatly scaled up for commercialization, and
neither we nor other parties in the industry have experience with such scale-up:


As is the case with any clinical trial, our Phase III clinical trial of DCVax-L for GBM involves a number of
patients that is a small fraction of the number of potential patients for whom DCVax-L may be applicable in the
commercial market.. If our DCVax-L, and/or other DCVax product candidates, are approved for commercial
sale, it will be necessary to greatly scale up the volume of manufacturing, far above the level needed for the
trials. Neither we nor our contract manufacturers have experience with such scale-up.


The necessary specialized facilities, equipment and personnel may not be available or obtainable for the
scale-up of manufacturing of our product candidates:


Scaling up the manufacturing of living cell products to volume levels required for commercialization will
require enormous amounts of specialized facilities, equipment and personnel - especially where, as in the
case of our DCVax product candidates, the product is personalized and must be made for each patient
individually.. It may not be possible for us or our manufacturers to obtain all of the specialized facilities,
equipment and personnel needed for commercialization of our DCVax product candidates. This could delay or
halt our commercialization."


That's their (NWBO's) disclaimer--they don't have it yet. In fact Cognate only recently expanded their facilities:


http://bit.ly/1PcVnOv


That's adding 32.5k sq.ft. and 80 employees. They have at the time of that writing 60 employees. What will
they do with that space?:


"'What we are currently doing right now is expanding our manufacturing capacity,”'Cognate chief operating
officer Mike Stella said. 'So we can grow with the companies that we currently have as well as bring on
additional clients.'"

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 59/183


Not even close to all of it are going to NWBO. Again, no where will you find in NWBO SEC filing an
agreement of COMMERCIAL SCALE manufacturing. Instead you have a disclaimer saying they DON'T have
it and may NEVER have it. So why all the money to Cognate? It's not going towards commercial scale
manufacturing. Or rather it IS, but WITHOUT any agreement between NWBO and Cognate. So it's all
Cognate's.


They will use the space, as admitted, for their own business purposes and clients other than NWBO too.


So the "80,000 sq.ft. to make 5,000 vaccines" they paste all over their slides at presentations hasn't
happened yet.


They admit this is only a far off "plan" in the 2013 10-k (dated 4/2014):


"Cognate’s manufacturing facility for clinical-grade cell products is located in Memphis, Tennessee, near the
airport. Memphis is a worldwide air shipping hub for both Federal Express and UPS. Cognate's facility is
approximately 35,000 square feet and contains substantial expansion space in addition to the portions
currently built out and in use. The current manufacturing facilities are sufficient to produce DCVax for at least
several thousand patients per year — an amount well in excess of what is needed for the late stage clinical
trial under way. There is a large amount of expansion space, which is already planned for build- -out in stages
to allow for scale-up of production capacity in a modular fashion as the need increases for commercialization.
This WOULD ALLOW Cognate's current facility to increase to a total capacity of some 5,000 patients per
year."


So as of 4/2014 they had 60 employees, 35k of space to serve their clients. And as of summer 2015 they are
moving forward to expand another 32k of space and add 80 employees. Any idea why business is booming?
Those generous NWBO shareholders of course! That's one big reason why $9mm could buy you 30% of the
float in 2010 but today that would take $150mm--rampant dilution.


So no, it is completely false to assert because Cognate purchases land or expands or whatever else they do
that it has anything at all to do with NWBO until that is expressly stated in NWBO SEC filings. Cognate is
doing it for Cognate and their clients for clinical trial-sized manufacturing.


As far as those increase manufacturing agreements with Cognate, these are the only ones wrt NWBO:


On January 17, 2014, we entered into the following agreements (collectively, the “Cognate Agreements” or
the “Agreements”) with Cognate for manufacturing and related services for our DCVax® products:


¨ a DCVax®-L Manufacturing and Services Agreement; 
¨ a DCVax®-Direct Manufacturing and Services Agreement; 
¨ an Ancillary Services Agreement; and 
¨ a Manufacturing Expansion Services Agreement.


And this is what each really means and how much NWBO shareholders paid for them:


"The DCVax®-L Manufacturing and Services Agreement replaces the prior manufacturing services
agreement, dated April 1, 2011, between us and Cognate, and provides for manufacturing of DCVax®-L
products for various cancers, including brain cancer, and related services. In return for the completion of
milestones by Cognate during the 1st quarter of 2014, and to cover the initiation of substantially expanded

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 60/183


DCVax®-L manufacturing services following execution of the DCVax®-L Manufacturing and Services
Agreement, we made a Milestone and Initiation Payment, comprised of 1,020,273 shares of our common
stock and a warrant to purchase 486,802 shares of our common stock. The warrants are exercisable at $4.00
per share, and have an exercise period of five years from issuance, and most favored nation provisions.


The DCVax®-Direct Manufacturing and Services Agreement provides for these services to continue and to
expand substantially along with expansion of our DCVax®-Direct program. In return for the completion of
milestones by Cognate in the 1st quarter of 2014, and to cover the initiation of substantially expanded
DCVax®-Direct manufacturing services following execution of the DCVax®-Direct Manufacturing and Services
Agreement, we made a Milestone and Initiation Payment. Such payment comprised of 1,683,451 shares of
our common stock and a warrant to purchase 803,224 shares of our common stock. The warrants are
exercisable at $4.00 per share, and have an exercise period of five years from issuance, and most favored
nation provisions.


The Ancillary Services Agreement provides for other categories of services that will be needed on an
expanded scale for clinical programs, compassionate use and other early access or expanded access
programs, and EVENTUAL commercialization. In return for the completion of milestones by Cognate in the
1st quarter of 2014, and to cover the initiation of a broad scope of Ancillary Services on an accelerated basis,
we made a Milestone and Initiation Payment comprised of 1,326,355 shares of our common stock and a
warrant to purchase 632,843 shares of our common stock. The warrants are exercisable at $4.00 per share,
and have an exercise period of five years from issuance and a cashless exercise provision and most favored
nation provisions.


The Manufacturing Expansion Services Agreement covers services associated with designing and developing
new or expanded manufacturing capacity or facilities dedicated to the Company’s DCVax products, preparing
the regulatory submissions, and obtaining and maintaining applicable certifications. In return for the services
provided by Cognate during 2013, and to cover the initiation of a broad scope of Manufacturing Expansion
Services on an accelerated basis, we made a Milestone and Initiation Payment comprised of 1,071,287
shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 511,142 shares of our common stock. The warrants
are exercisable at $4.00 per share, and have an exercise period of five years from issuance and a cashless
exercise provision and most favored nation provisions."


So let's go over what happened. NWBO entered into these agreements for 5,101,366 shares of common
stock that were trading at the time around $4.30 a share, so let's just say $20mm, and 2,434,002 warrants @
$4.


But as we just saw, a year and a half after that agreement Cognate finally put expansion in motion and were
able to expand and for their "clientS" of 32k space and add 80 employees for $9mm. NWBO gets some slice
of that for their DCVax programs and it cost them $20mm and 2.4 mil warrants. Okay!


But what do those agreements really outline for NWBO?


-"to cover the initiation of substantially expanded DCVax®-L manufacturing" 
[Okay but a year and a half later and all we see are Cognate expanding for all their clients and NWBO having
nothing at all near the 80k in dedicated space they say they need for commercialization. So who knows how
NWBO are defining "substantially" here.]

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 61/183


-"to cover the initiation of substantially expanded DCVax®-Direct manufacturing services" 
[there's that word again, and it should worry you as a NWBO investor that the 1 mil plus shares and 800k
warrants are just a milestone for INITIATING their plans. If some small slice of the 32k expansion is dedicated
to all this (5k, 8k?) then you're in for a far more dilutive ride.]


-"other categories of services that will be needed on an expanded scale for clinical programs, compassionate
use and other early access or expanded access programs, and EVENTUAL commercialization." 
[sounds like mostly consulting, and vaccine for Hospital Exemption can only be produced by Fraunhofer in
Germany]


-"services associated with designing and developing new or expanded manufacturing capacity or facilities
dedicated to the Company’s DCVax products, preparing the regulatory submissions, and obtaining and
maintaining applicable certifications. 
[regulatory submission for DCVax-Direct and planning stuff, basically. Again they are only getting some part of
that 32k, and admit they need 80k for DCVax-L in the states alone. We are not told how much of the 67k sq ft
space Cognate will soon have will be used for DCVax products, but Cognate states they have a good number
of clients (over 20 INDs as of Jan 2014)]


So there it is all spelled out. NWBO admits they don't have anywhere near enough to produce 5k vaccines a
year yet, and say they may never get there as a disclaimer. So we cant say all that money is going to all kinds
of expansion for NWBO. $9mm for 32k sq.ft. and 80 employees and it's for Cognate's clientS. $120mm
shipped to Cognate via NWBO however...


Moving on to your next point:


"Second, yes Cognate sold $11M of "lose them or sell them shares " at $4.40 a share, instead of selling them
on the open market for almost 3 times that. Yes, that is definitely them siphoning cash! Or a stupid way to do
it." --Bohsie


For one, no they weren't "sell them or lose them." That could only apply to warrants. And in that case it's
"convert them (to shares by buying them at the agreed strike) or lose them." And as far as warrants, they
were extended not that long ago:


"We also entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with Cognate on January 17, 2014, under which Cognate agreed
to have all of the shares that are issued as part of the Milestone and Initiation Payments in the Cognate
Agreements (collectively, the “Lock-Up Shares”) locked up for up to 30 months, in return for 15% warrant
coverage for each 6-month period of lock-up, on the same terms as the warrants in the Cognate Agreements.
During the lock-up, the Lock-Up Shares may not be sold or traded on the market. These lock-up terms are
subject to the same most favored nation treatment as provided in the Cognate Agreements as described
above. We also agreed to extend the exercise period of all current AND PAST warrants held by or on behalf
of Cognate for three additional years from their existing expiration dates or the date of the extension." -2013
10-k dated 4/2014


So as you see the warrants were extended another 3 years. Btw that warrant coverage is pretty nice for
Cognate--they get 800k MORE warrants every 6 months of that agreement. But I digress... As I said, even if
some were expiring they would BUY them, not SELL them. All of those "buys" you see here are warrant
conversions at various strikes:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 62/183


http://bit.ly/1Q8BTKf


The SELLS are either them repaying loans or straight selling on the open market with shares they had
converted from warrants (at strikes from $3-$4). The recent 1.8 mil share drop was to a third party in
repayment of loans. They repaid that party with shares. They were delivered a year later (summer this year)
when the stock was trading twice their worth. So there's an example of how they can get cash for those
shares via a loophole--they aren't technically trading them they are giving them as repayment for a loan.


You continued:


"AND THEN AGAIN! Actually it doesn't state at all that the rest was paid in Cash. You take a very big
assumption there that was the case. See excerpt from the same 10K you quoted:


'During 2012, the Company converted notes payable of $27.8 million into approximately 7.5 million shares of
common stock. The Company also issued approximately 4.7 million warrants to purchase common stock in
connection with the conversion of notes payable during 2012. Certain notes were converted under
inducement agreements during 2012 and as such, the difference between the fair value of the 10.1 million

date the stock was issued for lack of marketability. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate – 0.4%, volatility – 65%, expected
term – 5 years, expected dividends – N/A. The principal and accrued interest payable converted to common
stock during 2011 amounted to $4.8 million.'


You state that the other $7.55M was cash, IT WASN'T!" --Bohsie


So here is where you are confused. This was a conversion agreement for all notes payable to all parties, not
just Cognate, due to the 1 for 16 split.


The $7.55mm cash you stated for 2012 is first of all wrong (it's $7.2mm) and is found simply by deducting the
amount paid in shares from the total PAID to Cognate for 2012, minus also the small balance brought forward.
You can do this for all years and find the same thing. $122mm went to Cognate "RELATED" to their service
agreements (preserving manufacturing space for production and producing X vaccines). When you add all
invoices paid by shares/ warrants you find "$49mm." But $122mm went to Cognate since 2007. So naturally
the balance is $73mm in cash.


Then you said:


"Prior to the $7.5M of shares/warrants that was provided, it states that 1.437M shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $6.40 as well as additional warrants were also provided. So again NOT CASH!!!" --Bohsie


Which you misunderstood. This is the mention:


"In 2012, the Company issued approximately 0.5 million shares and 0.1 million warrants with an exercise
price of $6.40 to an outside party in order to settle a note payable that Cognate owed to the unrelated party.
The Company does not expect reimbursement from Cognate and as such, the fair value of the common stock

and warrants issued to the outside party amounting to $2.2 million and was recorded as inducement expense
for 2012."


As you can see Cognate received CASH from that third party and NWBO paid that party in shares/warrants.
Cognate still got the cash. And actually that's on TOP of the $7.2mm Cognate received in cash for their
services according to their agreements.


But this brings up another point, and that is that Cognate received more than the $122mm from 2007 on due
to other services OUTSIDE of that specified agreement. The total R&D for 2012 was $28.9mm, whereas
according the the MANUFACTURING ONLY agreements with Cognate they paid them $16.5mm ($7.5mm in
shares, $7.2mm cash and $1.8mm brought forward):


"During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$16.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of research and development costs related to these service
agreements. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31 2011, the Company owed Cognate approximately
$1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively."


So what happened to the other $12.4mm? Expanding sites for sure, but that doesn't usually cost THAT much.
Well, as usual, there are expenses you won't see specifically laid out but a good portion of it winds up at
Cognate. Consultation, planning, submissions, maintaining IND manufacturing submission, etc. The list of
extraneous expenses can get long. It certainly isn't all going to trial sites and CRO fees. Especially not
$12.4mm in 2012 when they had brought on 17 more sites over that year than they had in 2011. No way.


So at MINIMUM, for manufacturing and other "stuff" for the P3 up to 300 enrolled and the P1 Direct trial of 40
patients, Cognate was paid $122mm. It's certainly some amount higher than that. NWBO spent $261mm in
R&D from 2007-today. I'm sure 60%-70% or more of that went to Cognate for various "services."


You then said:


"So again, the amount of shares and warrants that were given to Cognate in lieu of cash IS NOT A
REFLECTION OF THE TRUE MANUFACTURING COSTS. Its like when you go to buy a new car. If you pay
cash, $8K is taken of the cost, but if you finance, or lease, that $8K is deducted. Whatever the manufacturing
costs truly were, Cognate and NWBO sat down, developed an agreement to convert owed debt into
shares/warrants. And I am betting Cognate wasn't giving the CASH discount cost, when evaluating how many
shares/warrants to convert into the $16M." --Bohsie


All of that is just speculation. We have no idea upon what reasoning these agreements were made. But the
fact that Linda Powers is majority owner of both NWBO and Cognate, there is clear conflict of interest. I'll say
it again--she told shareholders the P3 would cost "10mm-$15mm" It, combined with a 40 patient P1 have cost
$261mm so far. With the vast majority of that going to her pet company, Cognate Bioservices. And NOT for
commercial-scale ramp up.


Next you state:


"Again, that is why taking those Cognate Costs as straight $1 for $1 manufacturing is not correct. And
Cognate doesn't or hasn't actually received very much CASH at all to date. Again these are RESTRICTED
SHARES & WARRANTS, meaning THEY ARENT ABLE TO SELL THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET AND/OR
HAVE TO PAY TO CONVERT THE WARRANTS." --Bohsie

No dude, there is no other way the math works. They received $122mm for work related to their
manufacturing agreements (and some amount more for other stuff). $49mm was paid in shares. Until as
recently as 2014 they never had all that many warrants (in April 2011 all past issued warrants were converted
due to 1 for 16 split to 1.43 mil warrants at $6.40 strike, written down as just $1.8mm of the R&D expenses:
http://1.usa.gov/1Q8BTKc). The rest was paid in cash--$73mm.


"And YES Cognate sold $11M at $4.40 a share, this wasnt on the open market. It was a lose it or sell it deal."
--Bohsie


Again, no it wasn't (whatever that is), it was given as payment for a loan paid to Cognate by a third party.
Loophole...


"If NWBO went bankrupt today, Cognate would be caught holding the bag, with nothing in it. And they
differently did not get $83M of cash. If anything, they could be out significants sums if NWBO doesn't
succeed." --Bohsie


Absolutely wrong! $261mm in R&D went primarily to Cognate, probably upwards of $180mm of it. $122mm as
per their manufacturing agreements (that's just not debatable) of which $49mm were paid in shares. I've
already outlined this several times.


"Moreover, you can even find several years where Cognate bought shares of NWBO, as well as NWBO
provided shares/warrants to a thrid party that Cognate owed. By no means has there been a funneling of
cash into Cognate." --Bohsie


No not really. They CONVERTED warrants to shares (hence the "buy" on nasdaq). They had gotten many
warrants at $3.20 a share:


"On October 16, 2012, Cognate agreed to convert $7,506,000 and $980,000 of the Company's outstanding
accounts payable owed to Cognate in exchange for 2,272,907 and 486,751 Common Shares, respectively,
and warrants to purchase 1,136,454 and 243,376 Common Shares, respectively, at an exercise price of
$3.20. In addition, the prior year, on October 28, 2011, the Company had become obligated to issue warrants
to Cognate for the purchase of 23.0 million shares of the Company's common stock. Such warrants were
issued on October 16, 2012, after the Company's 1-for-16 reverse share split in September 2012. Therefore,
at the time of issuance, such warrants were exercisable for 1,437,500 shares of the Company's common
stock, at an initial exercise price of $3.20."


http://1.usa.gov/1PcVnOB


"Maybe I need to drop out, its obvious no matter what facts are used, you have in your mind that Cognate got
all this cash. I dont even think NWBO had $83M of cash on hand to be able to do that, let alone pay for any of
the other general/admin expenses." --Bohsie


Oh yeah, they've had quite a bit of cash come in over the years 2007-2015 especially. From inception to Dec
2007 they had used $75mm net cash in operating activities. By June 2015 they had used $268mm. So almost
$200mm in just CASH has been burned through during this P3 trial.


"No matter what, I doubt any Biotech company would sign up for the type of agreement Cognate did with
NWBO." --Bohsie

Well we agree there! ;)


"Its evident that they are invested in NWBO's success. Their 20M shares are worthless if DCVax isnt
positive." --Bohsie


Down to 18 million, and you'll see that go down even more. The lockup period is over mid 2016.


"AND ONE LAST CORRECTION, THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN NWBO AND COGNATE ISNT JUST FOR
THE TRIAL. Read the 10K,s you will see that part of the agreement was increasing manufacturing capability
from 600 to 5,000 patients a year. That means Cognate had to pay fixed costs to expand their manufacturing
capabilities as they now have 5,000 a year capability. Again, additional costs other than just the trial
manufacturing." --Bohsie


Already corrected that, so..


"AND YOUR QUOTE: 
"Linda said this P3 would cost $10mm-$15mm. At 300 enrolled and a 40 patient Direct P1 they have spent
almost $300mm. "


Talk about spin factor. They spent ~$287M since inception. Since 2010 when the trials started its in the
$110M, AND AGAIN, this is not actual cash that was spent! Its the amount estimated amount Cognate
estimated (or invoiced) knowing that they were going to be paid in shares/warrants." --Bohsie


I agree what I wrote was incorrect, I meant $261mm, not almost $300mm. But you mu friend are way off--they
have spent much more than $287mm since inception. Their net loss from inception to Dec 2013 was
$340mm. 2014 was $135mm, and half of 2015 was $113mm. They reported an accumulated deficit of
$633mm here: http://1.usa.gov/1PcVnOD as of June 2015.


Then you talk about that Ford analogy again (oy).


There's just no way around it buddy. Much of that $261mm spent on R&D over the course of this P3 (which
does include the Direct P1) went to Cognate. $122mm according to manufacturing agreements and some
unspecified amount more for extraneous fees. Yet only $49mm is noted as being paid in shares (warrants are
always a negligible part of R&D expenses). And we have already seen ways they can hand those off for cash.
Well over $80mm has been made in straight cash by them here. for making MAYBE 500 vaccines and
designating some space of their nice new facility for DCVax (who knows how much), which they have to share
with all of Cognate's other clients.


So basically LP used NWBO shareholders to build Cognate from nothing:


"Founded in 2002, Cognate Bioservices Inc. is a small actuarial consulting company in Memphis, Tennessee.
It has 6 full time employees and generates an estimated $300,000 in annual revenue..."


http://bit.ly/1PcVn10


to something much bigger: 140 full time employees and 65,000 sq ft facility.


Hmm.. I wonder how that happened?

Modis,


The numbers only look bad if you take them for their full worth. Now, I can go back and forth with Steve on
what was paid in cash and converted to shares, and I can probably take a lot of time to do that, and wouldnt
mind crunching those numbers with Steve. I would actually like to know what the exact amount of cash was
paid to Cognate. If you look at NWBO's accounting, they didnt even have $83M of cash to provide Cognate,
let alone pay any other admin or general fees, let alone paying the trials fees for the 42 hospitals. I can
guarantee you that the Hospitals running these trials are not taking shares and warrants in lieu.


However, all I am saying is that " YOU CAN NOT TAKE THE R&D EXPENSES NOR THE AMOUNT PAID TO
COGNATE, PAID OUT OVER 10 YEARS FROM NWBO's 10K TO BE THE SAME AS IF THEY PAID IN
CASH."


I am saying that this is extremely inflated. If Cognate gives NWBO a bill for $17M for manufacturing, scale up,
commercialization, SOPs, whatever they did for NWBO, you can bet that if NWBO was paying cash, it would
have been much less than $17M.


I love my New Car Example. If you go to a dealership, and you ask to buy a brand new car worth $30K, after
you have hassled with the guy, and brought it down even to invoice. And then you say, I am paying with cash,
instead of a loan/lease, they will take $2K - $8K off.


So that is all I am saying. Not saying that Steve is wrong in that on paper Cognate has received ~ $100M for
manufacturing. I agree. BUT, I would not compare that $100M to the actual cost. And the fact that Cognate
has ~ 20M restricted share/warrants shows that they arent cashing in, AND actually they cant CASH IN until
after phase III results (Well they could exercise their warrants but they would have to pay NWBO $4 a share
to convert the warrants to shares, so its not worth it yet). So Cognate only CASHES IN, and is able to sell
their shares if NWBO's P3 is successful.


Now to Steve. The only part I am interested in is finding out exactly how much CASH NWBO provided
Cognate. And from reading the 10K, I have only seen is in 2014 & 2013, Cash payments of $18.7M (2014)
and $12.4M (2013) where provided to Cognate, but then, NWBO had also just received a lot of funding.


So my question to Steve is, Where in the 10Ks does it specifically state the rest of the supposed $83M cash.
The other $52M? Specifically since P3 trials didn't really ramp up until 2013/14.

Bohsie you get the last word, this time I promise.


One thing I want to post about Method B of DCVax Direct though for Doc (which I also will let him have the
last word on):


"I read some debate as to why now no mention of method A vs B. I think the most entertaining apologetic is
that the company does not want to hurt the feelings of those who would suspect they were given Method A
and not B, even though no one has gotten any DCVax Direct injection in quite some time now. These 39 have
been long done.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 67/183


So if that is spurious, why no longer mention it? And this doesn't just apply to Linda P's talk but also they
removed the mention of "two different activation methods used" in the list of variables in slide 19. It's
completely gone now.


Well, knowing a bit about these this management team's public relations campaign tactics, I think the most
logical reason is that as data matured, method B no longer looked as compelling compared with A. And
possibly also they realized (with all of the lawsuits coming at them) that they may want to be more careful with
misleading statements.


If the protocol change occurred sometime part way through enrollment whereby they accepted ECOG 0 and 1
patients only and stopped accepting ECOG 2, and perhaps allowed more stage III patients than stage IV, and
according to batch manufacturing practices used Method A for the first half of patients and then Method B for
the latter half, then the Method B patients would of course have the better prognoses. So trying to draw a
comparison between the two as equal groups would be inaccurate.


But even still, let's assume they don't care about that, the main reason then become the numbers no longer
flatter meB vs meA so well.


The Feb update showed 50% of meA patients were still alive and 86% of meB were still alive. But what wasn't
disclosed was the range of each group's survival. Of course if half of the patients were treated with meA, and
then the back half treated with meB, that would mean the range as of Feb 2015 of those still alive would be
13-18+ months for meA and 9-13 months for meB. Well, then once those of meB reached the 13-18 month
range their % alive would definitely be below 86%. I have perhaps figured out the range and % alive for each
method assuming the first 18 enrolled were given meA and the latter 22 were given meB (18 vs 22 meA vs
meB are number NWBO supplied before):


-9/18 patients given meA were still alive in Feb 2015 from 13-18+ months. 
-18/22 (which is 82% of all meB, 86% of those evaluable) patients given meB were still alive in Feb 2015 from
9-13 months. 
-12 patients had died at 9 months or less in Feb 2015 
-Therefore as of Sept 2015, of the additional 8 that died (20 total), 6/8 were meB patients (passed at 13.5
months or earlier) and 2/8 could have been meA or meB (passed at 16 and 18 months). The one who passed
at 18 months could have been meB because a number of the 13 month survivors were meB under the above
scenario in Feb and that was 7 months ago. 
-Theoretically all 8/8 who died since Feb could be meB, but 6/8 must be.


Therefore:


-if 6/8 who died are meB, the breakdown is 7/18 meA or 40% still alive and 12/21 meB or 57% still alive 
-if 7/8 who died are meB, the breakdown is 8/18 meA or 45% still alive and 11/21 meB or 52% still alive 
-if 8/8 who died are meB, the breakdown is 9/18 meA or 50% still alive and 10/21 meB or 47% still alive


I think that says it all for why meB vs meA distinctions disappeared. Data no longer flatter meB, having
matured."


I admit that's from my buddy JMLogan on ivil. Iclight added:

Bohsie, Contributor
Okay, so I didnt see your page long reply until now. Again, you do not state anywhere specifically where $51M
of cash was provided to Cognate, so I guess I will have to go through all the accounting and spreadsheet it.


You are mistaken on a couple things.


“Cognate had undertaken to identify, inspect and evaluate potential manufacturing facilities and sites in
Europe for the Company, with such services to be compensated following successful completion of an
acquisition and facility plans.” From same 10K you provided your quotes.


“The current manufacturing facilities are sufficient to produce DCVax for at least several thousand patients per
year - an amount well in excess of what is needed for the Phase III clinical trial under way. The expansion
space will also allow us to procure significantly increasing capacity as we scale-up towards many more
patients for commercialization. The facility planned for the U.K. will similarly allow for scale-up there.”


Not saying that they are already big enough, but they have already scaled up enough to generate significant
revenue from 2,000 vaccines. In 2006 they were only able to do 600.


The paragraph you quote seems to be one of those “legal” statements that covers all their bases. The next
paragraph has the header "Our technology is novel, involves complex immune system elements, and may not
prove to be effective." So again, I wouldn't look into that verbatim, its part of the legal section of the 10K.


And of course they would still scale up more than 2,000 a year.


The $11M of shares sold were done in batches between June 29, 2015 and Jul 5 2015, when the share price
was ~ $10 - $12 a share, and it was done at $4.40 a share, so it was not done on the open market.


Actually last summer Cognate Bioservices purchased both shares and warrants, totaling ~0.75M shares (1/3
were warrants). So it wasn’t converting warrants no. From 2014 10K.


And lastly, 14M of the 20M shares/warrants that Cognate owns, are warrants, leaving 6M of restricted shares,
so again, they would have to pay ~$56M to convert their warrants into shares before even thinking of selling
on the open market.


Its too bad, I mean I like due diligence, I just don't make a conclusion without all the facts, and Steve, you
seem to have made a significant conclusion regarding NWBO & Cognate without all the facts.

Bohsie,


You asked:


"Now to Steve. The only part I am interested in is finding out exactly how much CASH NWBO provided
Cognate. And from reading the 10K, I have only seen is in 2014 & 2013, Cash payments of $18.7M (2014)
and $12.4M (2013) where provided to Cognate, but then, NWBO had also just received a lot of funding.


So my question to Steve is, Where in the 10Ks does it specifically state the rest of the supposed $83M cash.
The other $52M? Specifically since P3 trials didn't really ramp up until 2013/14."


And this is what is probably tricky and what a lot of investors would normally miss, but all the company has to
say is "total R&D is ____, we paid Cognate ______, and Cognate agreed to receive shares as compensation
in the amount of _____." The fact that they PAID Cognate _____ , less the amount paid in shares, tells you
how much was paid in cash. They don't need to "we paid Cognate _____ cash and _____ shares."


However it is interesting they just a started doing that 2014-2015. They were audited just before so maybe
that became "advised."


What they do say is as of July 2013 on a "going forward basis Cognate has agreed to at least half of each
invoice in stock and the remainder in cash."


http://prn.to/1Pdc649


That tells you that prior to July 2013 Cognate routinely received more than half of their invoices paid in stock.


The clearest example is the 2012 10-k (filed April 2013) that shows:


"During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$16.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of research and development costs related to these service
agreements. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31 2011, the Company owed Cognate approximately
$1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively."


That is under the section heading "Cognate Bioservices" and the arrangement is spelled out just before it. It's
a manufacturing arrangement. In 2012, of the $29mm they spent on R&D, $16.5mm was paid Cognate for
manufacturing. Some additional amount was almost certainly paid them for other extraneous services. But the
ONLY mention of shares paid to Cognate in that 10-k is this:


"On October 16, 2012, we entered into a conversion agreement with Cognate BioServices pursuant to which,
upon the closing of the public offering in December 2012, an aggregate of $7.5 million unpaid invoiced
amounts and payables were converted into equity."


So here I'm seeing I was actually wrong about 2012 specifically--that $7.5mm was related to the 1 for 16 split
conversion agreement. So in 2012 they got all of that $16.5mm in cash minus the $1.8mm brought forward or
$14.7mm.


However the easiest way to do this is simply go back and add up ALL of the shares for cash Cognate agreed
to. Then add up all invoices for manufacturing. You'll find $49mm of the $122mm was handled by giving

Cognate shares. The other $73mm was paid in cash. And I have even added in that $7.5mm conversion
agreement shares into the $49mm so it's actually more in cash and less in shares.


I never said it was simple but it's evident with a little work what actually happened here.

Sorry, when I wrote:

Well Bohsie as I said you get the last word. I have an opinion on why the discrepancy between their
statement and the current reality of space designated for DCVax manufacturing at Cognate that is probably
obviously by now but Ima keep that to myself.


GL


05 Nov 2015, 01:23 PM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
Btw last thing to add: what Cognate gets for expanding manufacturing and build out remains Cognates. Even
if at some point NWBO pays Cognate to have 80,000 sq.ft. dedicated to manufacturing 5,000 DCVax
vaccines a year in addition to everything else Cognate has going on, if NWBO files chap 11 they just keep it
all. It's NOT an NWBO asset of any kind. And with it Cognate will get whatever state the Sawston facility is at
on the cheap via chap 11 liquidation sale.


No matter what happens Cognate wins here, and has already won. When you go back and figure out how
much Linda Powers via Toucan actually paid for the shares she holds, and then figure out how much her pet
company Cognate has raked in over the years, and add that to what they will rake in before the P3 concludes
(and yes all those shares will be free to trade before that, mid 2016), it's very easy to see Linda and Cognate
actually have NO skin in the game. On the contrary they have already reaped many times their investment.


05 Nov 2015, 01:42 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
Steve,


I totally agree with you, L. Powers has set up so she and Cognate are fine if NWBO does not succeed.
Actually, depending on when the P3 results come out, and if they are negative, NWBO is required to pay
Cognate $3 - $5M. So I totally agree that Cognate is sheltered from NWBO going under. I never stated that

was the case. Did NWBO give up alot of shares and dilute the share base during the last 10 years, you bet
they did. And they did that by being creative with several strategic partnerships, all owned or controlled by
Powers. Is that the best scenario, no. But, do I think it could pay off, definitely. By doing this, Powers has
positioned NWBO to really cash in if their phase 3 results are approved. Does that mean she is making a
fortune on this deal. Well, we don't really know for sure, but what we do know is she still only really cashes in
if NWBO succeeds.


Take IMUC, they have had to continually find financing, and dilute shares as well, however, if they were to get
accelerated approval tomorrow, they would need to make a deal with Big Pharma to commercialize. Or they
would need to find a lot of money to build a facility to even start selling their product.


NWBO could potentially tap into ~ 2,000 vaccines a year of revenue. Assuming $100K per vaccine, or that is
revenue of $100M. Cognate would easily be able to increase manufacturing capacity with that kind of revenue
coming in immediately.


Also, I did read somewhere that the 6M shares of the 20M shares/warrants that Cognate has, may only be
sold at the specified price which in this case was ~$4.40 a share. So I need to look into that more to see if
that is correct, and then who purchases those shares. That would make sense as they weren't sold on the
open market. And so no matter, taking shares in lieu of cash would still have to have some risk fee involved.

BIG UPDATE:


I am crunching numbers and havent found all the links yet, BUT, here is one thing I will say. You make an
assumption that if it does state specifically that NWBO paid Cognate Cash, and you then take it off the R&D
and state. They paid cash. That isnt the case. Its exactly what I said about buying a Brand New Car with
Cash. Its called the inducement charge. 
2011 2012 2013 2014 Total 
Cognate R&D Costs $4.7M $16.5M $25.4M $21.3M $67.9M  
Issuance of common  
stock & warrants  
to Cognate $9.2M $7.5M $13.5M $16.8M $81.38  
Inducement Charge $7.8M $3.1M $7.5M $16.0M 
Total R&D Cognate  
Cost $17.0M $10.6M $21.0M $32.8M $81.4M


 
Here are the same numbers listed in the table above. However, you take off what's leftover from the Cognate
R&D Costs and say NWBO paid cash, which isnt the case, BECAUSE, if you read in more detail, there are
carryovers every year of debt owed to Cognate. Meaning that debt isnt paid right away. And so to really state
manufacturing costs, you would have to remove the added interest in those owed costs.


Moreover the induced charges are above and beyond what the manufacturing invoice is. Its that risk fee I was
talking to you about. AND ITS INCLUDED IN THE R&D EXPENSES.

All of the R&D Expenses. For every induced charge, for every shares/warrants converted for payment to even
non Cognate companies.


Also, if you look at the total conversion costs for 2011 to 2014 (which includes invoice & inducement), it is the
same amount as the sum of the Cognate's R&D Costs. Meaning, what wasnt converted was carried forward
as owed costs. So now restating the amount of cash paid out to Cognate, we are back to 2013 & 2014 of
$12.4M & $18.7M = $31.1M


Then adding the invoices we get: $47M . So a total of $78.1M from 2011 to 2014. And this includes Ph 1
Direct as well as P3 -L. And since they are getting paid in shares, I am sure these invoices have a premium to
"normal" manufacturing costs.


Now, if you add in the inducement cost (which is the extra amount given in the value of the shares/warrants),
that jumps from $78.1M to your ~$110M.


I will do some more digging, as I see that Cognate also bought shares at times as well, on their own, not
having anything to do with converting debt. And secondly, it looks like costs to use Cognate are high because
they have to keep the manufacturing line/facility open for solely DCVax products, and that has a huge
premium.


It stated that it required "dedicated manufacturing capacity", which had an upcharge of ~ $0.4M a month.
Which adds, ~ a min of $6M a year just to dedicate that equipment/line for DCVax. However, I can see huge
costs due to lost business/production capabilities due to a dedicated process line.


Okay this is where I drop my keyboard!!!

Wow Bohsie good find, but unfortunately it only makes the case worse. The inducement expense or charge is
in cash unless they specifically state "non-cash inducement." As it sounds it's a perk to make the other deals
sweeter so they go through.


The main prob here is inducements are actually listed (or "hiding") under "General & Administrative"
expenses, NOT R&D. For example:


" General and Administrative Expense


General and administrative expense was $9.8 million (cash and non-cash expenses combined) for the three
months ended June 30, 2015 versus $3.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in
general and administrative expenses can be mainly attributed to non-cash stock based payment to Cognate's
designee in partial satisfaction of the 8.1 million shares that were approved by the Company's Board last
November to satisfy certain anti-dilution obligations to Cognate, and were reported by the Company last
November, but had not yet been issued.


Of note, in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation, certain key terms related to 8.1 million
shares have not been finalized ( e.g., vesting conditions), therefore the Company has not recorded this
transaction in its condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2015.

Change in fair value of derivatives


During the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 we recognized a non-cash loss and gain on
derivative liabilities of $25.7 million and $4.7 million, respectively, due primarily to the change in value of the
warrants, due to an increase in our stock price, issued to Cognate in connection with the extinguishment of
accounts payable.


Inducement expense


During the three months ended June 30, 2015 there was no inducement expense versus inducement
expense of $5.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The inducement expense for the three
months ended June 30, 2014 was related to the conversion of accounts payable to common stock and
warrants to Cognate in connection with the extinguishment of accounts payable, and the fair value of the
common stock and warrants were higher than the conversion price."


I'll work out the math but this only makes the total in cash and shares paid to Cognate go up.

Either way not a part of the common Cognate invoicing nor listed under R&D.

Here we go, my curiosity got the best of me:


Running totals (starting 2015 and working backwards):


Inducements: "During the three months ended June 30, 2015 there was no inducement expense


Invoices: "For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we made cash payments for the two periods,
respectively, of approximately $21.3 million (with invoices generally being paid in all cash), and $12.4 million
(with invoices generally being paid half in cash and half in stock) to Cognate."


Balance Due: "As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, we owed Cognate $4.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively,
for unpaid invoices for services performed by Cognate."


So for 2015 NW paid C $21.3mm cash and 900k warrants that vested that are part of the former agreement
and so are not part of any "invoice" from C to NW.


The "Balance Due" is a running tab that the next payment covers, so it can be for the most part ignored,
except the last one. So we'll add the $4.2mm here and make it $25.5mm in cash (btw looks like the "half cash

half shares" agreement is kaput).


Thus:


1st H 2015:  
-$25.5mm cash 
-900k warrants


Totals for 2014:


Inducement and Settlement: "During the year ended December 31, 2014, $16.8 million of accounts payable
owed to Cognate BioServices was settled for 4.2 million shares and 2.2 million warrants. The non-cash
inducement charge was $16.0 million related to these transactions. The inducement charge was based upon
the market price for tradable shares; however, the shares issued to Cognate were unregistered, restricted
shares."


Inv: "For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company made cash payments of
approximately $18.7 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, to Cognate BioServices. A portion of the $18.7
million paid in 2014 was payment for unpaid invoices from 2013.


During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred non-cash equity based
compensation (restricted common stock and warrants) related to Cognate BioServices of $21.3 million and
$0, respectively."


The weird thing is that $0 in 2013 seems untrue. Because a few paragraphs later it states:


"On July 31, 2013, Cognate BioServices, a related party supplier, agreed to convert an aggregate of $11.6
million of accounts payable into shares of common stock (“Conversion Transaction”) at an initial conversion
price of $4.00 per share."


But then we find out that:


"During the year ended December 31, 2013, $13.5 million of accounts payable owed to Cognate BioServices
(including the July 31, 2013 transaction discussed above) was settled for 4.7 million shares and 2.4 million
warrants. The inducement charge was $7.5 million related to these transactions. The inducement charge was
based upon the market price for tradable shares; however, the shares issued to Cognate were unregistered,
restricted shares."


So they settled part of this: "For the year ended December 31, 2013 the Company recognized approximately
$25.4 million of research and development costs under these service agreements for that period.."


for $13.5mm, leaving $11.9mm paid in cash. Also they received $7.5mm in restricted shares as an
inducement expense.


Thus:


2014:  
-$18.7mm cash 
-$21.3mm common stock/warrants

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 75/183


-$16mm restricted class shares (induce) 
-900k additional warrants (not related to invoicing)


And:


2013: 
-$11.9mm cash 
-$13.5mm common stock/warrants 
-$7.5mm restricted shares (induce)


For 2012:


Inducement: "In 2012, the Company issued approximately 0.5 million shares and 0.1 million warrants with an
exercise price of $6.40 to an outside party in order to settle a note payable that Cognate owed to the
unrelated party. The Company does not expect reimbursement from Cognate and as such, the fair value of
the common stock and warrants issued to the outside party amounting to $2.2 million and was recorded as
inducement expense for 2012."


Inv: "During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$16.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of research and development costs related to these service
agreements."


Past conversion agreement mostly fulfilled: "On October 16, 2012, we entered into a conversion agreement
with Cognate BioServices pursuant to which, upon the closing of the public offering in December 2012, an
aggregate of $7.5 million unpaid invoiced amounts and payables were converted into equity."


That was originally $9.2mm worth of unpaid invoices that carried over through 2011, then they gave Cognate
46 million shares as payment of it ("On November 23, 2011, the Company and Cognate executed the
conversion of $9.2 million dollars of amounts owed by the Company to Cognate Bioservices, Inc. into 46
million shares of common stock, using the agreed upon conversion rate of $0.20 per share.")


, then paid some cash and ultimately (post split) this was handled by giving Cognate the $7.5mm worth of
shares. It all stems from debt that accumulated and was mostly unpaid from 2009-2011.


So for 2012 we have:


-$16.5mm cash 
-$7.5mm common shares carried over as conversion agreement 
-$2.2mm cash (induce)


For 2011:


Inv: "During the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, the Company recognized
approximately $7.8 million and $4.7 million of research and development costs related to these service
agreements. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company owed Cognate approximately $10.2 and $0.6
million, respectively."


So on Nov 2011 they executed that conversion agreement and expired (essentially) $9.2mm of that above
$10.2mm of back owed (through Dec 2010) debt. However, there is a new invoice for 2011 totaling $4.7mm.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 76/183


Most of that was therefore paid in cash. What wasn't ($0.6mm) was paid the following year so as stated we
just count the cash expense for 2011 at $4.7mm.


So for 2011 we have:


-$4.7mm cash


No inducements.


2010 had $7.8mm invoiced and 2008/2009 were:


"During the years ending December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, we recognized approximately $7.8
million and $7.3 million of research and development costs related to this service agreement. As of December
31, 2008 and 2009, the Company owed Cognate approximately $1.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively."


Of the $15.1mm invoiced over 08/09, $7mm was unpaid. By the end of 2010 they owed $10.2mm, meaning
they paid Cognate most of what was invoiced those three years; $22.9mm invoiced and $10.2mm unpaid. So
another $12.7mm in cash was paid those three years. No shares were given in payment for debt.


So for 2008, 2009 and 2010 we have:


-$12.7mm cash


No inducements. But $12.7mm cash plus $7.5mm in eventual shares is A LOT for making no vaccine.


And lastly 2005-2007 (when the P3 really began):


"During the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, we recognized approximately
$3.5 million, $2.4 million and $5.8 million of research and development costs related to this service
agreement."


-So another $11.7mm cash.


Grand totals:


-$103.2mm in cash payments (includes $2.2mm inducement) 
-$42.3mm common shares/warrants (valued mostly around $4) 
-$23.5mm restricted class shares (inducement expense) 
-4.5million potential new warrants (900K every 6 months for 5 consecutive periods or 4.5mil warrants by Jun
2016 as per the 15% warrant coverage from Jan 2014 agreement)


$169mm to Cognate for manufacturing services according to past agreements, not including extraneous fees.
$261mm in R&D from 2007-mid2015. Shareholders have been way overcharged, imo. That's a real thing.
This dilution has taken money from them and placed it into building out Cognate, which Linda Powers is
majority owner of. NWBO shareholders have no stake in Cognate.


Now I'm really done dude. I can't put any more time into this stuff. Do with these numbers what you will!


05 Nov 2015, 11:48 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
Okay one, that $0 is because 2013's payment was carried over and made in 2014, as it stated in the 10K.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 77/183


Okay so I think you just confused yourself. If you scroll up to this article, and to the table listed of all the
converted debt to shares/warrants, the same numbers you originally listed as for cash provided to Cognate,
The Loss On Conversion column, $34.4M. That is the inducement charge.


Okay so NWBO pays Cognate for some amount of manufacturing, say $10M (this is an example not a true
scenario). And they give Cognate $20M worth of shares/warrants (the value at the time of the agreement).
Now Cognate received $20M for $10M of work, however, they can not sell or cash in for ~3 years. However,
NWBO has to account for that, and so they do in their R&D Spending. SO, instead of saying that they spent
$10M on R&D (with Cognate), they spent $20M because the value of those stocks/warrants need to be
accounted for. Does that mean NWBO would spend $20M on the same manufacturing if they had cash, no,
they would have spent somewhere less than $10M, as I am sure, that $10M invoice was probably padded as
well.


So here is the moral of the story, when you do not pay with cash, you have to sweeten the pot, considerably,
and that is why Cognate has so much shares/warrants. Its not because NWBO is siphoning cash to them.


Moreover, you can cut and paste as much of a 10K as you want to confuse people, BUT, the amounts above
what was settled, and the added inducement charges, where not cash payments to Cognate, but rollover debt
from year to year. And that is why you and this author, were able to spin it to sound like NWBO paid Cognate
$100M in cash, when in truth, the only two cash payments to Cognate to date, are in 2013 and 2014, for ~
$31M. Thats it. The rest was shares and warrants. And you can not show me anywhere, in any 10K that says
otherwise.


06 Nov 2015, 12:04 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
Again Steve, you are assuming that NWBO paid in cash in the years 2007 - 2010 because it states they had
R&D charges, and then those were reduced at the end of the year. However if you read in, you will see the
converted debt deals. They are less detailed as they are from 2011 on., and you are correct, prior to 2011,
there were no inducement charges (meaning no extra shares/warrants given). You state Cognate was paid
cash in 2009; actually you stated: 
". So another $12.7mm in cash was paid those three years (2008 - 2010). No shares were given in payment
for debt"


However, see page 58 of 2010's 10K and you will see that shares were given in 2009:


"During 2009, the Company and Cognate BioServices ("Cognate") agreed that most of the accounts payable
owed by the Company to Cognate, will be converted into shares of common stock instead of paid in cash.
The conversion price will be no less favorable than the conversion price applied to any other creditor of the
Company. "


However, you are correct that the years before 2011, NWBO didnt claim any inducement charges, meaning,
they gave Cognate the number of shares/warrants that were valued the same as the invoice. Again. No cash
was paid here either. This is actually the case for every year.

NOT ASSUME THAT WAS THE CASE. THE ONLY YEARS NWBO PAID COGNATE CASH WAS 2013 &
2014.

06 Nov 2015, 12:21 AM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
Lol, Bohsie, no. The loss on conversion is NOT the inducement charge! Inducement expenses are what they
sound like--perks, bribes even (if you will) to "sweeten the pot" to make a deal go through. They are separate
transactions.


2013 payment was not "carried over and made in 2014." Only a very small amount, as usual. The 10-k says:


"For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company made cash payments of approximately
$18.7 million, and $12.4 million, respectively, to Cognate BioServices. A portion of the $18.7 million paid in
2014 was payment for unpaid invoices from 2013."


A "portion." How much? Well that's easy to find out. Let's look at 2013:


"For the year ended December 31, 2013 the Company recognized approximately $25.4 million of research
and development costs under these service agreements for that period.. As of December 31, 2013 and
December 31, 2012, the Company owed Cognate (including third party sub-contract amounts) approximately
$3.6 million and $3.3 million."


They only back owed $3.6mm by Dec 2013, so that's the only "portion" of debt from that year that could have
been paid in 2014. And the $25.4mm in invoice charges for 2013 was paid $12.4mm cash and $13mm in
shares--DURING 2013. Both are expressly stated.

Look, before you go crazy with these analogies let me stop you and tell you there is no need. The filings tell
you the whole tale. They tell you what was invoiced and PAID, what was paid specifically in shares, and what
was carried over (usually a negligible amount). That means the balance was in cash. And then they also state
some inducement expenses here and there. That's all there is to it.

Cognate does not invoice NWBO $10mm and get $20mm in shares or whatever. That's crazy. They tell you
exactly what they are invoiced, and then how much of that was handled by granting shares, if any. That's all
they have to tell you as a shareholder. Just because they haven't EXPRESSLY stated in every filing
EXACTLY how much went in "cash" to Cognate according to the invoiced agreements, doesn't mean they
didn't tell you. All that wrangling you're doing with your Ford analogies are useless when the numbers are
staring you right in the face.


And that's all I have to say man :)

Oh, last point--I see now why it says $0 for 2013, because it's "restricted" shares in that mention:


"During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred non-cash equity based
compensation (RESTRICTED common stock and warrants) related to Cognate BioServices of $21.3 million
and $0, respectively."


That's not talking about lock up periods, those are classified as restricted shares. Basically can't be handed
off to a third party. However these:


"On July 31, 2013, Cognate BioServices, a related party supplier, agreed to convert an aggregate of $11.6
million of accounts payable into shares of common stock (“Conversion Transaction”) at an initial conversion
price of $4.00 per share."


"During the year ended December 31, 2013, $13.5 million of accounts payable owed to Cognate BioServices
(including the July 31, 2013 transaction discussed above) was settled for 4.7 million shares and 2.4 million
warrants."


are non-restricted common.


Sorry Bohsie you're wrong thrice lol


06 Nov 2015, 12:58 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
Steve. It explicitly states what the inducement charge is in the 10K. Its the extra amount of the value of the
share/warrants given. Which is exactly what "Loss Of Conversion" is. It actually even states the same number
for the inducement charge for 2013 and 2014. So no I am not wrong. I can't believe you would argue that.
This means you do not understand what is written in the 10K.


As for the $0, I will have to look into it, but, restricted shares are ones that have restrictions on them such as
having to sell them at $4.00. And yes, that means they can not sell on the open market.


Nonetheless, I just proved that NWBO did not pay Cognate all that cash, and the amounts you take for R&D
Spending has significant inducement charges and unpaid debt rolled into it, so that means you shouldn't be

taking it as the actual manufacturing costs, and the fact that COgnate hasn't really received as much Cash as
you say they have.


Also, quoting 10Ks all over the place doesnt strengthen your case. Laying the numbers out in a spreadsheet
and showing that they sum up is what shows you know what's going on.

Steve writes - "Cognate does not invoice NWBO $10mm and get $20mm in shares or whatever. That's crazy."


Yet in the table above that Steve references, it specifically states The Accounts Payable (i.e. what is owed to
Cognate), the Fair Market Value of the shares/warrants that were given, and the Loss on conversion (or the
financial term is inducement charge), or in another way of saying it, the extra amount the shares/warrants are
worth above the Accounts Payable amount. IT IS EXACTLY THE CRAZY IDEA THAT STEVE STATES
ABOVE IS NOT THE CASE.


And its proof that Steve doesn't know what he is talking about. Sorry to be blunt, but maybe stick to the
Biotech stuff and not the financials.

Bohsie,


I understand them fine. You think inducements are just "loss upon conversion." I repeat--THEY ARE NOT.
Inducements are "pot sweeteners," if you will, where the company gives equity out for loans and services, or
agreements, such as extensions on repayment. These are NOT part of the R&D expenses however (as you
incorrectly asserted), as they always have their own line. I have seen them included as part of "General &
Administrative" before though.


Here are some examples:


"During the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into a series of extension agreements, with a
counterparty owning 520,833 redeemable shares, to extend the redemption date to October 4, 2013. In
connection with these extensions, the Company issued 72,825 warrants with an exercise price of $4.00 and a
5 year term. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes model with the following
assumptions: risk free interest rate - 1.72%, volatility - 98.04%, expected term - 5 years, expected dividends-
N/A. The fair value of the warrants amounted to $0.2 million and was charged to inducement expense. The
warrants issued resulted in stockholders’ equity classification in accordance with the guidance contained in
ASC 815-40-15-7D, "Contracts in Entity's Own Equity".


"During the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into a series of extension agreements, with a
counterparty owning 366,667 redeemable shares, to extend the redemption date to November 20, 2013. In
connection with this extension, the Company issued 30,000 restricted shares at a fair value of $3.46 per

During the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into a series of extension agreements, with a
counterparty owning 398,920 redeemable shares, to extend the redemption date to January 31, 2014 for no
additional consideration.


During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company entered into a series of extension agreements, with a
counterparty owning 520,833 redeemable shares, to extend the redemption dates to February 25, 2014. In
connection with these extensions, the Company issued 68,750 restricted shares. Upon the expiration of the
redemption period, the Company has the option of paying cash for the balance due, if any, or entering into a 2
year convertible note for the balance. If the Company’s stock price is above the redemption price, then neither
action will be necessary. The fair value of the restricted shares which amounted to $0.2 million and was
charged to inducement expense."


As you can see they were all equity (in these cases shares/warrants, but inducements can be cash too) given
for extension agreements. Inducements can be given for any "benefit" the company receives. Extending
repayment of a loan, to sweeten the pot on terms of an "equity for services done" deal, etc. You cannot lump
them all in one category as "loss upon conversion." The mention that made you conclude that was probably
this one:


" Inducement expense


During the three months ended March 31, 2015 there was no inducement expense versus inducement
expense of $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The inducement expense for the three
months ended March 31, 2014 was related to the conversion of accounts payable to common stock and
warrants to Cognate in connection with the extinguishment of accounts payable, and the fair value of the
common stock and warrants were higher than the conversion price."


This was more completely laid out in the 10-k as:


"Inducement expense


During the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 we recognized an inducement expense
of $18.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The increase in the inducement expense for the year ended
December 31, 2014 was related to conversion expenses related to financing from an unrelated institutional
investor, and to an increase of the conversion of accounts payable to common stock and warrants to Cognate
BioServices in connection with the extinguishment of accounts payable."


And for just Cognate this was narrowed down even further as:


"During the year ended December 31, 2014, $16.8 million of accounts payable owed to Cognate BioServices
was settled for 4.2 million shares and 2.2 million warrants. The non-cash inducement charge was $16.0
million related to these transactions. The inducement charge was based upon the market price for tradable
shares; however, the shares issued to Cognate were unregistered, restricted shares."


Why an EXTRA $16mm worth of restricted shares given? Because the price at the time the 4.2 million shares
and 2.2 million warrants were given as "extinguishment of accounts payable" was higher than the conversion
price, as they explain when they state:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 82/183


"The inducement expense... was related to the CONVERSION of accounts payable to common stock and
warrants to Cognate in connection with the extinguishment of accounts payable, and the fair value of the
common stock and warrants were HIGHER than the conversion price."


In three months they were already up to $5.3mm in rolling inducement charges. By the time 2014 ended they
had racked up $16mm in inducement expense, paid to Cognate in restricted shares along WITH the 4.2 mil
common shares and 2.2 mil warrants.


Here is another example of the same thing:


"During the year ended December 31, 2013, $13.5 million of accounts payable owed to Cognate BioServices
(including the July 31, 2013 transaction discussed above) was settled for 4.7 million shares and 2.4 million
warrants. The inducement charge was $7.5 million related to these transactions. The inducement charge was
based upon the market price for tradable shares; however, the shares issued to Cognate were unregistered,
restricted shares."


The costs paid to Cognate are part of the R&D, but these inducements are always IN ADDITION to the R&D
and other expenses. They are never PART OF them.


It's another way NWBO, but really Linda Powers, has been funneling more money into Cognate--the good old
"inducement" expense. Sort of like "travel expenses" that are always inflamed. So in the examples above,
Cognate agrees to settle $16.8mm of debt for what amounted to $32.8mm in common shares and warrants
and restricted shares, and before that $13.5mm in debt for what amounted to $21mm in common shares and
warrants and restricted shares.


Final post on this subject. If I write another I will cut off my pinkies.


Ask any accountant, don't trust what I'm writing (not that you would anyway--it's the whole reason for your
obstinance, you have me pegged as some short seller with an agenda).


Ask them in particular about these inducements and also if when NWBO states:


"During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company RECOGNIZED approximately
$16.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of research and development costs related to these service
agreements."


that that means it was PAID in cash unless they say how much was paid in shares. And then if they DO say
some amount was paid in shares, it is CORRECT to deduct that amount from the above "recognized" costs
and conclude the balance (minus any small amounts brought forward as "still owed") was paid in CASH.


See ya later buddy. Good luck with this speculative bet.

Ah sorry Bohsie I have to cut off my pinkies to tell you you were right about something. The author does
create his own table and lists two of the inducements paid to Cognate as "Loss upon Conversion."

The company does not handle all such conversion losses this way and losses upon conversion are not
always remedied or rectified or "rewarded" let's say with inducements. And it is wrong to say inducements are
ALWAYS losses upon conversion. Losses upon conversion just ARE.


However the table is correct in showing how the fair value of equity issued minus A/P converted = losses
upon conversion. It just so happens these losses were then PAID for by NWBO to Cognate via additional
restricted shares (inducements). And so "conversion losses" in this case as the author labels them are
additional losses the Company (NWBO) incurs due to their extraneous financing deals with Cognate (and
Toucan). Conversion losses, if and when they occur, should just be a part of biz, imo. If a company does work
for another company or loans them $ for X shares, then when those shares are finally converted if the market
price has gone up past the conversion price I say so what? It will happen the other way around about equally
statistically. And for God's sake not these swaths of restricted shares Cognate has gotten in addition to the
common shares/warrants for overpriced vaccine manufacturing and "space rental."

06 Nov 2015, 11:53 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
OMG, I AM RIGHT? I knew I was right all along. I never called it loss on conversions, that was what the
author incorrectly called it. It is an inducement charge, an extra amount for taking shares/warrants that you
cant sell for 3 years, in lieu of cash.


AND NO INDUCEMENT CHARGES ARE NOT LOSS OF CONVERSION. COGNATE IS WILLING TO
ACCEPT SHARES/WARRANTS FOR CASH WITH A SWEETENED POT: INDUCEMENT CHARGES. Not
loss on conversion. They essential get extra stock and warrants for accepting that debt conversion
agreement.


If you look at 2015 10K, page F-18 it even defines inducement expense.


"Inducement expense is calculated based upon the difference between the carrying value of the accounts
payable and the fair value of the restricted stock and warrants on the date such shares and warrants are
issued (using the market price of unrestricted, tradable shares)."


All I am saying is that you can not roll inducement expense into Cognate's R&D costs, nor manufacturing
costs. Secondly, since before 2011, there was no inducement costs, and Cognate Invoices were paid $1 for
$1 of share/warrant value, you can bet that the invoice probably had some padding in it as well that was later
replaced by inducements. No company is gonna let you exchange cash and services with shares/warrants
that you cant even liquidate right away. And so there has to be some incentive. It was inducement charges
prior to 2011, so before that I am betting it was higher costs to Cognate.


Moreover, since R&D Costs include share/warrant conversions, I do not think you can easily state that
everything else is cash. There are alot of conversions, even three party ones. The best way to evaluate how
much cash went out the door, is to look at how much cash came in, and that will take some time. I am going
to enjoy my weekend, so I wont be doing that right away.

However, I think we have come to the conclusion that Cognate was paid with as much cash as you thought
they did, and my whole Buying A Brand New Car With Cash Example Is Actually A Good One.

Sorry I took so long to respond to your observations. More information is needed to come to any firm
conclusion about differences in benefit between method A and method B. What is known is that they are
"biologically similar", and that at least one method causes substantial lymphocyte infiltration while both seem
to cause some degree of tumor necrosis. Both are using aDCs so both need proper spacing or Tregs will be
activated by way of PD-1+ macrophage disregulation. Both methods were tested in mice and method B
appeared to surprise investigstors. As per your observstions, there may have been some closing of the gap
with time. From my point of view ECOG scores may be the initial cause of separation while the longer term
results appear to show 2 groups developing. The first group needs to reach about 14 months survival before
dropout plateaus while the second group needs go reach about 16 months survival before their group
plateaus. I believe that these plateaus will be shortened up considerably with proper spacing along with
optimum dosing and perhaps method B. Once all the data is released in the paper they are working on more
will be known. Best wishes.

While I believe this Phase Five report is slanted, I also believe it serves a purpose that longs should take to
heart. If you look at what happened to CLVS today you know what I mean. The need to stay well within the
boundaries of individual risk tolerance levels is imparitive to sound investing. Larry Smith has always
supported a balanced form of risk management as a primary principle of his biotech investment strategy.
Bohsie has tried to bring this back into perspective with his posts below.


Attempting to expose bias is a good thing as well as having multiple points of view expressed. This is one
reason why I like this forum even though I may not agree with the conclusions that many contributing
anonymous authors have arrived at with regard to NWBO.

This week NWBO share price will be dealing with options expiration again and as long as there is silence
from the regulators and NWBO we will continue to see price action that wants to push for the negative trend. I
just hope that those who have chosen to ride the negative trend have balanced their positions as well like the
pros have with calls and warrants. I say this because I believe that NWBO has the potential to rock the
market in the same way that individual investors can be rocked with unbalanced portfolios and that would not
be a pretty picture. Best wishes.

Steve,


Just read these posts above and this is exactly what I was saying but I look at it in a positive spin. The fact
that DCVax-L has a crossover, means that the OS data may be skewed. Particularly if DCVax-L is effective,
as it will push the OS of the control group up as well. Therefore, I feel that if the primary endpoint is met, PFS,
and the OS is not met, BUT, the OS ofthe control group is 1 - 2 months greater than the average, so 16-18
months, and then OS of DCVax-L group is 17-19 months, the FDA will have to take that into consideration,
and could put more weight on the PFS results. Look up FDA literature and presentations on surrogate
endpoints for accelerated approval.


Here is a quote from FDA website:


"The role of PFS as an endpoint to support licensing approval varies in  
different cancer settings. Whether an improvement in PFS represents 
a direct clinical benefit or a surrogate for clinical benefit depends on the magnitude of the effect and the risk-
benefit of the new treatment compared to available therapies. "


GBM is an aggressive form of cancer, and is one whithout many treatments, therefore the FDA would/could
evaluate in a much different light than many other diseases and cancers.

I missed this post of yours over on ihub and I don't have time tonight to read your threads thoroughly but 2
quick points. The first is that DCVAX-L does have a way to create the polarization needed for increased IL-12
and when I first realized how important polarization is to the maturation process and looked at their patents I
realized how they were doing it. The second very obvious point is Activartis did not exclude use of steroids.
More later but did you happen to see the latest filing by Mr. Woodford's funds dated 11-26-2015? Very, very
interesting. Best wishes.

Bohsie,


I wouldn't be worried about the PFS primary ep of the P3 test as a "true long" in NWBO (I'm just trading this).
Surrogate eps are what accelerated approval is all about. I'd be worried for other reasons.


18 Nov 2015, 08:13 AM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
Actually, I don't think the DC in DCVax-L secrete IL-12 at all because they are all exhausted prior to injection.
They incubate them too long imo.


Woodford is believe it or not NEW to small cap bio. We have no idea how good he is in this sector yet. He did
manage to average a decent return at his prior firm, with the help of riding the greater biotech bubble up
(through the big names), but now who knows where he'll go. But keep in mind that he is not that heavily
weighted in NWBO as some would think. If NWBO crashes and drops 80% his fund may drop 4%. How many
NWBO retail longs can say the same about their NPV?


I've asked this over and over and the only answer I get is the paranoid "you're not getting my shares!!"
response--if you all think Woody is so great and so much better than you at all things investment related, then
why not just put your money into WPCT? He has positioned in NWBO exactly what he deems as acceptable
for the risk inherent here. And is more heavily weighted in other pics, which presumably means he deems
them less risky (of failure).

His Biotech fund just dropped 6.4% due mainly to NWBO's drop. Its a #880M so ~ $1.6B say, and it owns >
$100M of NWBO stock, so it would shed closer to 10% or more, which is significant to a large investment
fund.

Doc logic
Steven,


Polarization acts as the on/off switch. As long as the DCs maintain proper polarization during each maturation
stage the weakened state that they may be in is being compensated for to some degree. The question is to
what degree and the open label info arm, though not definitive in and of itself, is encouraging with regard to
this. By the way, polarization does not need to be done chemically. Best wishes.

Doc,


Really it comes down to maturation of DC, and it's most likely that all DC in DCVax-L are immature or partially
mature. Even fully mature DC injected intradermally hardly migrate. Studies show only 1%, with a range of
0.2% - 4%. Almost the entire vaccine is phagocitized.


Partially mature DC (not mature but "unexhausted" as NWBO defines the ones in DCVax-Direct) are
tolerogenic:


"Certain therapeutic modalities (e.g., chemotherapeutics like cisplatin) or certain anti-tumor vaccine-
preparation methodologies (i.e., freeze/thawing, discussed later in Anticancer Therapy Differently Shapes the
DC-Dying Cancer Cells Interface), may actually cause a sub-optimal activation of DCs (24, 28, 36, 37)
thereby giving rise to a somewhat “limbo” state which can be termed as “semi-mature” DCs (Figure  
(Figure1)1) (10).


In various anticancer therapy settings (see Table  Table11 and Anticancer Therapy Differently Shapes the DC-
Dying Cancer Cells Interface), DCs interacting with dead/dying cancer cells (treated with non-immunogenic or
low-immunogenic anticancer agents) may attain a semi-mature state, i.e., while they may present
low/medium levels of cancer antigens yet they either lack co-stimulatory signals (e.g., CD86) or suitable
immunostimulatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12) (6, 10, 28, 37).


Thus, semi-mature DCs, unlike iDCs, exhibit the ability to sustain at least two (i.e., signal 1 and either one of
the other two signals) of the three signals required for successful/optimal T cell activation (23) but

unfortunately not all three at once and thereby they exhibit an unstable interface with T cells that leads to
active ablation of anticancer immunity (10) and clonal T cell anergy (20, 23, 24).


Semi-mature DCs might exhibit inconsistency in either up-regulation of phenotypic maturation ligands or in
secretion of cytokines (Figure  (Figure1).1). Semi-mature DCs with disparity in phenotypic maturation are able
to secrete one or more of the few assorted cytokines like IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
but do so to a highly variable degree (in terms of amount and simultaneous presence of these cytokines
together) (23, 28, 37).


It is also noteworthy that certain well-established tumors composed of immunogenic cancer cells (e.g.,
melanoma) may also encourage formation of de novo semi-mature TIDCs rather than immature TIDCs due to
the particular tumor microenvironment they can create (39). Together iDCs and semi-mature DCs tend to
encourage T cell anergy or T cell exhaustion (9, 10), tolerogenicity toward the cancer cell (9, 31), and even
active pro-tumorigenic activity (e.g., semi-mature DC-derived IL-6 may act as a growth factor for tumors
expressing IL-6R-gp130 cognate receptors and/or IL-10 can act as a general immunosuppressor) (17, 40,
41)."

So that's a whole lot for DCVax-L to overcome. And then beat GBM on top of it. Not possible imo, my friend.
You should consider all of these things carefully! Confirmation bias affects us all, but when we force ourselves
to be objective and open ourselves up to opposing viewpoints evenly (without short hedge fund conspiracy
theories) we can escape it.


One last point on that--you do know almost the entire short position in NWBO is done "blind" via various
inverse ETFs, no?

Of the cancer drugs approved during that timeframe, two-thirds (67%) relied on a surrogate endpoint for

Moreover, guess how many of the 36 used PFS for the surrogate? ~50%! yes, that's right 17 of the 36 used

Your quote above states "may cause suboptimal activation ". The reason they say may is that there were still
too many variables that they didn't have a good understanding of yet. The specifics of how DCs are actually
matured from precursors makes a huge difference as more recent research has indicated. Each step needs a
specific environment and specific activation by signaling chemokines. Mobility is actually one of the easier
problems to solve. Once you have the activation you want you just lower the oxygen level and DCs become
circulatory. As far as exposure to unwanted cytokines, proper polarization environment can basically take care
of that. We are trying to catch up on many years of very quiet (selectively non peer reviewed) research by this
company. They have a better understanding of this technology than perhaps anyone because they have been
experimenting with it as long as anyone and much more than most. Remember that patents for process are
very broad in scope but what NWBO does is very specific. This undisclosed tweaking is what I believe gives
them the edge over everyone else. More practice with trial and error. Best wishes.

You do know that the IND for DCVax-L is 10206, which was issued in late 90s/early 00s, yeah? And that you
cannot make changes to an IND that may affect the efficacy or safety of the product (even when just adding
an element to the protocol), and if you want to you need a new IND? Because if you know that then you know
DCVax-L was formulated with a process that doesn't take into account ANY of the information that succeeded
it. A link to discussion on the IND:

If you want to pin your hopes on Direct, okay (though I wouldn't), but they will almost certainly need controlled
studies with a PFS/OS endpoint to get the market or FDA to move. That will take a long while (and I also think
Direct will have a tough time procuring a measurable diff between groups anyway). In the meantime the P3

they get enough (or completely draw down on the $150mm shelf before the P3 blows up and don't actually
spend it all in absurdly excessive manufacturing costs) to move Direct into a registrational phase II/III, then
maybe hop in and hope to God the result is SS. At least you'd have a glimmer of hope there. But having a
cost basis of $5-$6 when this will very likely go sub $1 sometime between late 2016-mid 2017, just to hope
that Direct results come through IF they get funding and IF you aren't further diluted such that your true cost
basis (via R/S) ends up around $15/pps, and so HOLD through the P3 failure--you might end up needing a
$3B market cap just to break even.


If the P3 failure is likely (and it is) then the most prudent thing to do is drop this thing and take the loss right
here. The slightly riskier thing (because a futility halt is possible) is to hold it until the clinical hold lifts and
Direct P2s start and everyone seems happy again (1-3 months). Then sell. An even riskier thing to do is hold
it right through summer when a new wave of green buyers and more silly, baseless enthusiasm blooms, and
then sell--hoping that even if p=1 some subgroup will look interesting enough due to dumb luck for the DSMB
to avoid rec a halt for futility (what I'm doing with 2% of my NPV). But holding it beyond that is flirting with the
devil.

Steven,


I read up on the IND discussion and I have a strategy based on contingencies.


Take a close look at that first link. There is a note that describes the process used for activation of dendritic
cells using magnetic beads but this is for their Phase l which uses autologous peptides and does not specify
whole tumor lysate that would have non tumor TAAs. Very important distinction. The second point is that
footnote (26), which is used multiple times, is specific about antibodies used for selection and separation of
CD3+ T-cells for their counts but not for the DCs. NWBO is not required to give away their formula so you
don't and can't know it precisely. Open access patents don't always reveal everything either otherwise we
could all make Coca Cola ourselves. Seems like you are putting lots of information out but failing to point out
key details. DCs are like computer coding. It's all about the details. Best wishes.

Hey Doc,


Process to manufacture acid-eluted peptide vaccine is very diff and those methods would not apply to IND
10206. The process is VERY well outlined for making DCVax-Brain (or L) in the second UCLA study and in
the confidential protocol that I pasted a section of. But either way the IND 10206 precluded IND 11053, the
first patient of which was treated in early 2003 (2nd UCLA study with TLR agonists). IND 10206 (DCVax-Brain
WTL loaded DC vaccine) was issued in late 90s to 2001 or so the latest.


I can't see any reason to suspect what you do about manufacturing of DCVax-L being so adaptive and flexible
to subsequent realizations from other DC therapy studies. IND 10206 is a fixed method (except some

automation changes, etc that do NOT affect safety/efficacy of product). And none of the interesting things that
have been discovered about DC vaccines since 1999 are applicable to it in any way at all. It just is what it is!


Best wishes to you as well.


21 Nov 2015, 02:20 PM


Doc logic
Steven,


I am going to go back and read through those links but just as a side note, if efficacy has not been established
then how can automation changes be ruled out as a potential source of influence on product efficacy. The
strange thing about science is that accidental and even planned changes in procedure can create unexpected
outcomes. The weed killer 2,4-D and post it notes are good examples. Catch you later.


22 Nov 2015, 01:11 AM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
They can't be ruled out, not totally. Though it would be unintentional. Either way the sponsor must update
their IND with safety data and any changes like automation regularly. They just can't alter the compound or
protocol so much that it clearly (and intentionally) may have some effect on safety or efficacy. A new IND
would have to be applied for in that case.


Look at IND 10206 vs IND 11053. The only difference is adding TLR agonists (a separate treatment) during
the booster phase. Needed a new IND for that, even though the DC vaccine in both IND are identical.

Doc logic
Steven,


I do not discount at all what you have found from your research and it is much appreciated but in all of what
you posted there is no mention of oxygenation levels and other factors known by NWBO that exist because of
their experience working with DCs that can basically remain hidden because no one else can be sure of their
affect. The migration problem observed by others using DCs in their research is a problem that NWBO may
have solved much earlier in their own research based on the direction that research was taking. This is what I
believe happened based on the progression of their research history. I'm looking forward to discovering what
actually has occurred one way or the other. By the way, you may want to check out the FDA site for IND
10206. Very interesting dates listed there. Best wishes.

Just adding this as it sounds like you are saying thet NWBO is not able to change how they manufacture a
drug under an IND, but it states on the FDA website that:


Manufacturing Information - Information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls
used for manufacturing the drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed to ensure that
the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug.


I dont see anything that states the drug needs to be manufactured the exact same way between trials, just
that the company need to show that systems are in place that they can replicate the manufacturing process. I
would think that between trials, if they see ways to improve a drugs performance, they do not have to go back
to a phase I trial.


Just asking the question.

Steven,


Do you think that the compassionate use petition listed in the IND report history is for the first patient that
enrolled in the HE program? Also, what do you think the reason for having allogenic placental and umbilical
cord blood stem cells mentioned in the 10206 IND is all about?


23 Nov 2015, 10:48 PM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
"FDA recommends that the sponsor carefully assess any changes in the drug substance and drug product
manufacturing process or drug product formulation at any phase of clinical development to determine if the
changes can directly or indirectly affect the safety of the product. For changes with a significant potential to
affect the safety of the product (see examples below), an information amendment should be submitted that
describes the changes and contains relevant information at a level of detail sufficient for an adequate review
and assessment. When appropriate, this information should include data from tests on the drug substance
and/or drug product produced from the previous manufacturing process and the changed manufacturing
process to evaluate product equivalency, quality, and safety. In addition, when analytical data from tests on
the drug substance and/or drug product demonstrate that the materials manufactured before and after are not
comparable, sponsors should perform additional qualification and/or bridging studies to support the safety
and bioavailability of the material to be used in the proposed trials and, when applicable, to support the quality
of the trials."


If they made any change it would have had to have been in 2007 or thereabouts (the 33 were enrolled then).
They cannot occur DURING a phase 2 or 3 trial (adaptive design P1 are okay). And NWBO have also never
conducted any bridging studies, etc., which would be required if any significant changes were made BEFORE
the start of a P2 or P3. But beyond that, the protocol itself elaborates on the manufacturing process in detail
as:

Both DCVax-L and the placebo will be manufactured for all patients undergoing 
leukapheresis. 
Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
DCVax®-L, IND #10206 
Protocol: 020221, v5.2EU 30APRIL2013


5.1.1. Preparation of Tumor Cell Lysate 
The tumor is excised by a neurosurgeon and a portion thereof removed for 
pathological examination. All remaining tumor tissue is diced and digested 
to a single cell suspension using an enzyme mix. 
Next, the tumor cell suspension is filtered through a strainer and then 
centrifuged for 10 minutes to pellet the tumor cells. The aspirate is removed 
and the cell pellet is re-suspended in RPMI-1640 without phenol red, and 
transferred to cryovials previously labeled with patient ID information.


The cell suspension in cryovials is then subjected to freeze-thaw cycles to 
effectively lyse the tumor cells. The tumor lysate is pooled and centrifuged. 
The supernatant is then filtered through a 0.2μM filter. Sealed vials 
containing the tumor lysate are frozen and stored at -80oC in controlled 
inventory until used for loading DC generated from the patient. 
5.1.2. Dendritic Cell Preparation 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated by leukapheresis from the 
patient before treatment begins. MNC are purified by density gradient 
centrifugation, and either used fresh or cryopreserved until further 
processing. After thawing of the MNC, if cryopreserved, adherent cells are 
cultured ex vivo for 6 days with IL-4 and GM-CSF to generate DC. 
5.1.3. DCVax-L Preparation 
The DC are collected and combined with the tumor lysate antigen for 16 
hours to prepare DCVax-L. After the incubation, the final product is 
harvested and cryopreserved for shipment to the clinical site for patients 
who are randomized to the treatment cohort."


Yeah that's really it. This version of protocol is up to date as of 2013. It's the same exact thing they did in 99.


Hey btw, Linda Liau admitted in a way the need for maturational elements to be introduced to improve the
efficacy of the vaccine by way of TLR agonists:


"We administered the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, imiquimod or poly ICLC, following intradermal
injections of ATL-DC ***to induce DC maturation*** in vivo. We previously demonstrated in pre-clinical models
that the utilization of TLR agonists could enhance the survival and trafficking of DC in situ and *enhance the
priming of tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes*."


http://bit.ly/1GS9bb8


Maturation of DC is essential for inducing an immune response (as I've been saying redundantly). TLR
agonists may have served this purpose in this study (in fact those who did not receive them had a mOS of

around 20 months). In any event, these agonists are NOT given with DCVax-L as part of the P3 treatment
schema. The P3 IND # 10206 precludes that of the second UCLA study (first patient enrolled in 2003) with an
IND # of 11053.


If anything they should have unblinded data for the approx 19 of the "33" (some went into the info arm) and
started the trial over again with IND 11053 in 2011 and thrown 10206 in the bin. It was only 19 patients. And
the P1 used as a basis for proceeding to P2 (and then converted to P3) was the one above with TLR agonists
in the regimen (the other was acid-eluted peptides, also not IND 10206). It would have made sense in every
way to do this P3 with IND 11053. Why didn't they?


I don't know, but it may be a bigger issue than you think. If DC in DCVax-L are tolerogenic (as immature and
partially mature DC are) and not immunogenic (as only fully mature DC are) as a result of being combined
with freeze-thaw necrosed lysate then less than 1% will migrate away from the injection site (the rest will be
phagocytized) and the ones that get to t-cells will induce tolerogenicity (not good).


But even with fully mature DC injected in numbers of 2.5 million intradermally, 98.5% of them will be
phagocytized shortly after injection and will NOT migrate (see former links).


Sorry doc, don't know how "oxygenation levels" and "other factors" you did not elaborate on would have an
affect on the above.


Again, please see all past links if you want to be able to grasp my full argument. If not, then that's fine too.

Just reading that link you provided, and it states in the NWBO SEC document. It was listed in the legal risks
section, but states that they have changed their manufacturing process.


"Changes in manufacturing methods for DCVax-L could require us to conduct equivalency studies and/or
additional clinical trials." - This is one of those legal terms, obviously. Then it goes on to say:


"With biologics products, “the process is the product”: i.e., the manufacturing process is considered to be as
integral to the product as is the composition of the product itself. If any changes are made in the
manufacturing process, and such changes are considered material by the regulatory authorities, the company
sponsor may be required to conduct equivalency studies to show that the product is equivalent under the
changed manufacturing processes as under the original manufacturing processes, and/or the company
sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials. Our manufacturing processes have undergone
some changes during the early clinical trials. Accordingly, we may be required to conduct equivalency studies,

It also states in that Guidance document you sent out that an information amendment may be submitted. Not
sure if that would be public record for some to even know if the IND has a information amendment in the case
that the manufacturing process changed.

Nice find, that could account for any omission in trial design tweaks. 
Though it does mean, if the trial is a success, there could be delays in commercialization while a confirmatory
trial is carried out.  
I suspect any funding after a successful trial will be on much better terms.


24 Nov 2015, 01:53 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
True, but I think since GBM is such a deadly disease, unless there is some huge concern on safety, which I
can not see there being with immunotherapy type vaccines, the FDA would be hard pressed to delay approval
of something that shows promise.


What does Steve say about that? I am sure he will find something negative.

I cant quite follow Steve either, other than he is stating that NWBO is using the same manufacturing process
which he believes is a futile won, however it shows in the SEc documents that NWBO has changed their
manufacturing process over the various trials. Meaning, his point that they are using the original method for
P3 is not true.

Bohsie,


Again, they say,


"Our manufacturing processes have undergone SOME changes during the EARLY clinical trialS."


First of all that's manufacturing process, not composition. Automation being probably the one major factor that
has changed. Also "during the early clinical trials" could be talking about 2000-2003 or thereabouts. The P3
was actually started in 2002 (see CT.gov "first received"). At least that's when FDA examined manufacturing
etc and relevant data and gave it the okay.


Secondly, they state that if that has changed the safety or efficacy of DCVax-L in any way they will need to
conduct equivalency studes before they can get approval. If these studies show it's the SAME thing, then they
can get approval (assuming they have the data to back up a BLA package). If NOT they may NOT get
approval, and would have to conduct another study.


FDA doesn't like when you mess with your treatment too much. It should be basically the same stuff from
phase to phase (especially 2 to 3), otherwise you cannot submit a cumulative package to FDA. Not that the
former studies at UCLA are usable anyway (very diff tech and single arm). Only for safety, and well, that's
maybe not applicable either (again, diff tech). So maybe none of that even matters. Truly they are relying on
this single study for approval. It would have to have BLOW AWAY data for FDA to be okay with that. They
want to see at least two studies with controlled data and decent patient populations for approval.


"Accordingly, we may be required to conduct equivalency studies, and/or additional clinical trials, before we
can obtain product approval, UNLESS the regulatory authorities are SATISFIED that the changes in
processes DO NOT affect the QUALITY, EFFICACY OR SAFETY of the product."


Look, just examine the protocol section I pasted. It's the SAME STUFF. The most BASIC DC vacc in
existance. The forerunner. Also the one proven ineffective in follow on studies comparing it with other
methods.


Stop dreaming guys!!

So what you are saying Steve is that you do not really know if the manufacturing process was changed. But
you are making the assumption that it hasnt changed since the beginning, and that the Phase 3 trial will fail
even though you dont have any hard evidence that it will fail, nor that the manufacturing method is exactly
how you planned it to be, etc...


I mean just reading your reply shows someone grasping at straws. I just dont understand how anyone could
be so adamant that this trial will fail.... or succeed. I dont profess that it will be successful, I just point out the
facts, and poke holes in the opinions of people like Phase 5 (or Steve) that state so adamantly that DCVax-L
will fail, yet they really do not know, what the exact manufacturing method is, what the exact manufacturing
costs are, etc...

No Bohsie I'm saying I HAVE THE PROTOCOL AND KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE SLUSH IS MADE.


And I know if they were going to change anything it would be to take Liau's research and mimic what was
done in one of the UCLA studies and add TLR agonists to the regimen. That's what produced those
AMAZING single arm survival times anyway, yeah? So why not move 11053 into a P3? They just didn't do it.


You know nevermind. This is so damn obvious. There's only one reason why you refuse to see it--heavy
confirmation bias.

26 Nov 2015, 05:53 AM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
Hey OOTB,


Yeah, sorry about that. I have been a horrible person to follow on SA.


I had some weird notion that people here were following my posts and train of thought on ihub. I didn't want to
write another article until my thoughts on everything had solidified, and that would have been early summer.
But then I also held off at that point because I have some friends who despite what I told them were still
invested and didn't want me to publish my thoughts. Quite the quandary.


It all started around late winter when Direct data were still not being divulged and I began to suspect we had
already seen the "best" of it and were just going to get some spin on survival from there. Recall my last of two
closely together published articles was in Nov 2014--incidentally just before Woodford came aboard. That was
probably only coincidence, but maybe not? He for sure had Malik chattering in his ear for many months about
it and Malik had written a 40 page report on NWBO, and with his other fund he could have invested at any
time--but just happened to wait until a month after those two well circulated articles I wrote. One in which I
commissioned a biostat to go over the numbers and draw up some curves, and the other in which the
confidential protocol section that fully explained the reason for the sample size increase being that as an
entire group patients were progressing slower than anticipated was divulged. I think maybe that swayed him
or his "team," at least moderately, but I can't be sure--and it makes me sound damn arrogant to suggest it, but
I would if someone else wrote it, so wth. Together with a meta-analysis and another article on the promise
seen in past attempts at inject DC therapy, it all came together to show NWBO as a good bet. Maybe that was
the straw that broke the investing back for them. No clue but the correlation (which doesn't always imply
causation) is there at least.


But you would think a top fund like that would have people on it that could find holes in my arguments and
information out there that refuted parts of it and then make a more informed decision. I don't think they did
that. And hell maybe they never ever read my stuff, though that's a little hard to believe.


I think most of us are just now used to someone else doing a lot of the work for us. It's actually a good thing.
A society is much more efficiently run when we are all masters of a few or even just one thing, imo. The
Renaissance man for the most part went extinct for a reason--you just can't keep up with the level of
performance required in any one field when you are trying to master many. So, this lends to trusting each
other to do our part.


I've heard in law school it happens this way. The amount of reading and work required for various
concentrations of law is impossible for one person to digest and then pass a bar exam over. So you form
groups and each person takes a particular subject and researches the hell out of it and concentrates what
needs to be known in a sort of cliff's notes. These are then shared with each other and they learn all of the
topics this way. But boy you better have a good team!!

So, anyway, I have no idea. And I'm probably rambling now... But suffice it to say I kept looking, kept
searching, refused to stay inert--and started to find things that were quite iffy. Things I honestly looked for
before but honestly did NOT look for hard enough. I was too compelled by the bull case I had dug up that I
wasn't giving the bear case enough weight. I guess I was also relying on THEM to do that for me! And frankly
they all sucked at it. It's not enough to simply say "ICT-107 blew up so DCVax-L will too!" You have to show
WHY the mechanism in both is the same. All I could see were differences in loading. Significant differences.
And one study that compared GAA loaded DC to WTL loaded showing a more than doubling of OS for the
WTL group. It wasn't a controlled study, and there were significant issues with that comparison--but I was in
more of a "refute the bear case" mode. But that was easy because it was weak. What I should have done was
created my own bear case to refute my bull case. I only REALLY started doing that with 100% effort late
winter.


Initially I was quite excited about DCVax-Direct because I had seen what DC inject therapy had done in the
Triozzi study. I reasoned that with the "advances" NWBO were making that by 2013 they would have
improved on two things that study (from 2000) couldn't do. One was intra-organ injection methods and
equipment, and two was research done to determine the precise state of mature but only JUST mature and
so non-exhausted DC (different from "partially mature" DC that NWBO states they are and no that's not
splitting hairs). But Triozzi had only injected small lesions and mostly melanoma or superficial breast. These
react to so many things. A shot of IL-12 will do just fine (what DC secrete anyway). But there is no systemic
effect and so distal lesions do not shrink and so those tumors will come right back. I figured NWBO had
probably solved this issue and was very wrong. I also reasoned that because tech had evolved such that a
tumor deep in the liver or lung could be injected safely, that therefore they could inject these and see similar
effects to the superficial lesions. Also wrong.


You can come up with this or that reason as to why but NONE of the 40 patients had significant shrinkage.
And worse, when at the presenter spotlight theater in ASCO this year they put up some slides showing how
many got how many shots. They didn't know it but told us the PFS curve right there! And it was HORRIBLE!
85% progression between 9-15 weeks. 93% PD from 16 weeks on. And I do not think injecting 1-3 in the P2
leg will change that. And keep in mind irRC was used. These tumors weren't fully necrotic or even most
necrotic but just filled with immune cells (not sure that's that good anyway)--they were mostly viable tumor. Or
new lesions popped up and didn't subsequently shrink. Clear PD.


So when I realized we were only going to hear about "increasing necrosis" forever, with no fully necrotic
tumors and no sig shrinkage, I began to become more bearish. This then led me to develop my own bear
case (what I should have done initially), instead of rely on the bears to do it for me.


Also during this time AVII from ivillage decided to critique my SA articles. It took him forever and I disagreed
with lots of stuff but he did find a few real major issues with my work. One was confirmed in the German Label
that showed early enrollment was excruciatingly slow. All the way through even much of 2012. And also he
found that there was an info arm back in 2007. So the 33 were split up, some randomized and some into the
info arm. When you are trying to parse out how 66 events fall in various schemas you don't have much wiggle
room. My reasoning for the modeling, although sound, was missing the actual enrollment curve. The German
label showed that my even conservative approach was far too aggressive. Eliminating some 14 events and

also slowing the ramp substantially completely changed whole group assumptions and they ended up at 12
months or so (and it became much more accurate).


Then also IMUC updated their placebo group info and found it was 10.1 months mPFS, not 9. And ALSO
revealed they did NOT screen for early progressive disease (ePD) just before randomization! So some got
into the info arm, dragging the median down (some psPD would get in too, but there are always more ePD in
a group than psPD--overall the effect is negative on TTP).


Suddenly I realized two things--holy sht, the median PFS of the whole group is prob around 12 months and
holy sht NWBO placebo group is prob gonna do better than 10.1 months. That means no SS result. Failure.


I tried to find ways the two placebo groups were diff that could benefit ICT-107 placebo over NWBO and all I
found was what IMUC recently showed that their p group got activated but not loaded DC. They reasoned
that some "immune responses" they saw in assays were the result of that. But the fact is that 99% of
intradermal injected DC are phagocytized at the injection site (something I don't think any NWBO-long knew),
and immune response has never, ever, been correlated with improved PFS or OS. Sometimes the contrary--
like one study will show increase INF-y was correlated with improved outcome, and then you look around and
find another study that states (literally) "Surprisingly, INF-y was correlated with worse prognosis." It means
nothing! The immune system is weird, and the baseline reads were taken right after SOC ended. SOC
depletes the immune system. So rebound of course occurs. That will throw off any assay.


So no, there is no evidence out there to suggest that a shot of activated DC in your arm, of which 99% are
destroyed shortly thereafter, can do anything to add even 0.001 months to your PFS.


BUT, in addition to allowing ePD into the group and still getting 10.1 months mPFS (and so without ePD it
should be higher), they also did not screen for total lymph counts. That has a very strong correlation with
PFS. An actual hazard ratio. I proved no low CD4 count patient was getting into the DCVax-L P3 due to that
screening criteria. That for sure will elevate the mPFS of the whole group.


So I think now that the evidence (contrarily) shows that there will be no difference between groups, and that
the median PFS is right around 12 months for both arms.


When I fully realized this it was spring. It was all coming together but I do also have a full time job! Lol.


So all I can say is sorry. I can't offer anything more. I'm not writing articles on here anymore for that reason--it
gets complicated ethically. I write an article and then leave you out to dry to figure everything else out from
there. The only other thing I could do was find a way to divulge little pieces of incomplete findings as I go--but
how do I do that? Maybe the blog on here? Hmm.. Maybe. Write 100 mini articles of "I don't know but this
might change things a little--still working it out!" Lol, I dunno.


I'm not an expert advisor. I have no degree in finance. I def screwed up how to go about either wrt informing
other people. So this profile is really only here now to write pms and waste time in the comments section :)


Sorry dude. I wish you the best of luck. A few of my pics that have survived an exhaustive, self initiated bear
approach are ACHN, CMRX, ARGS (but de-risk before P3 topline), and RUSL (allllll day--sell in three years
when over $70). I'd say AEZS which I had been watching for a while and jumped in after the R/S, but it will be
volatile for a while. I do think before data read out later 2016 it will be around $30-$40. You could always just
take a brief ride on that one, but please do yourself a favor and don't risk too much. And don't hold it all

through data read. Take some off. I give the trial a 40% chance of success. Less if it looks like they won't
overcome the Feuerstein/Ratain rule. Though I like zopta's chances over dox due to some interesting ORR in
chemo-refractory patients given zopta whereas another study showed 0% ORR and very short PFS for
patients given dox alone. Though the n was small.


Best!


PS:


The latest from Woodford and the possibility of a halt for futility if an interim analysis is ongoing or will be
before long has me not even wanting to risk the 2% NPV I recently put in here at $4.90. So I'm pulling even
that out next week. Thought I could hold at least until the clinical hold lifts and the pps gets a bounce but the
risk is just too high I think now even for that. At least for me.

i like what you say about focus on how you really need teams to fully break down a complete analysis. I'm
brandy new to this stock and know very little about it but when I saw this chap Malik being suspended I
thought I'd try to get some info. I must admit, I kind of find it hard to believe you changed your mind due to
your own research....but I have no idea........you really seem to do your diligence tho and I wonder if you've
ever looked at PVCT? but from the looks of your recent note...you've had your fill


26 Nov 2015, 05:54 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
Actually, I knew everyone would take this Woodford statement as "negative" , especially you Steve. The fact
that you argue with me about effect size, and p-value (and its obvious you do not know how to calculate effect
size, or you would understand that it would actually make DCVax-L data even better as it uses the mean
value; I estimated an effect size > 2 using the SOC data for 117 patients, and ph2 data).


Secondly, Woodford sending in the Forensic Expert is a good thing. One, if there is any wrong doings, it will
be public provided soon enough. Secondly, dont think that Woodford has already done his due diligence on
the numbers, and what was provided to Cognate, etc..... He already knows and feels confident to invest the
$100M he did. Thirdly, what this does, is adds an independent expert to the board, so now, all the Steve G's,
the Adam F's, all the Phase V short accusers will now have a very thin leg to stand on when accusing, and
trying to influence the retail investors. This will actually provide legitimacy to NWBO, and will also provide it
easier for Woodford, and NWBO to get more institutional investors, meaning that it will be extremely difficult
for the shorts.


So either the stock will plummet as there is wrong doings, or it will be much more difficult for the shorts to try
and "scare" retail or institutional investors with the whole "conspiracy" theories.

I think the fact that he said he was unaware of the allegations before his last 30 m would make me think this
is not true..... 
"Secondly, don't think that Woodford has already done his due diligence on the numbers, and what was

I do agree with your positive outlook on Woodford's recommendation. It's a shame the company couldn't be
more transparent to begin with and then this wouldn't be necessary. There is no excuse for the lack of
transparency and lack of shareholder accountability.


30 Nov 2015, 10:42 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
He was aware of the suspicious "shorting" as it happened in Sept and early Oct. Its these shorts that take
everything so literally, and "spin" what is said and done that allows them to cause panic. This works well with
Biotech companies that have make it or break it trials. Everyone, even retail investors want to know ahead of
time if its good or bad news. And because its make it or break it type of situations, shorts are more readily
able to cause panic. As Linda has been able to partner with Cognate, and we all knew how and why, and
Woodford did as well, that is why NWBO has the potential to be an amazing investment, as opposed to Kite,
Juno, etc... even if they have positive Ph 3 trials.


So back to taking everything literally. I believe that Woodford knew shorts were manipulating the stock, and
he knew from the past all the short articles, and misinformation being given, and the fact that NWBO does talk
much, this was not news to him. When he stated that he was unaware of the allegations, I think he is stating a
reason to which he is providing/recommending someone from the board. A paper trail so to speak. As he is
an investor, he needs to shelter himself from being part of the company, and by recommending someone to
the board that would help with all these crazy allegations (and I showed how most of these, especially the
$310 million which includes stock and warrants and inducement charges), are just crazy.


So no I dont believe he was caught off guard, but rather, probably caught off guard in that these allegations
and negative short articles would have this much affect. He wants the share parice to stay above $4 a share
as we wait for the trial results to come in.

Here you go. It's all how you write it.


"Investor Wants NWBO Investigated Due to Corruption Allegations"


Or "NWBio plans to expand board and welcomes Woodford's call for independent investigation of allegations
in anonymous internet report. "


http://tinyurl.com/pz8...


To me, Woodford did his due dilligence, in helping NWBO around these short allegations that have plagued
NWBO for years now. Because he isn't a specific "insider" unless someone form NWBO or another "insider"
provides him with inside information, he isnt privy to the same information as "insiders" (Corporate officers,
directors, and employees ). More so, in order to not be listed as an "insider", he cannot provide direction to
the company. However, he can as a shareholder, send a public letter that is recorded in his SEC documents,
that recommends an action for NWBO to take, which it looks like they gladly took. So much so that they
already spoke to the ex-KPMG forensic expert already.


If NWBO just decided to take this ex-KPMG expert onto their board, with no paper trail, and with ties to
Woodford, some other forensic expert could come in and show that Woodford was an insider, and was
providing direction and expertise to the company, hence, being a corporate officer.


Suffice to say, with this expert coming on, this is actually a good thing for shorts, if (and only if), what they
have been saying is true all along; that NWBO is this illegal entity and it is blown wide open. That would mean
that shorts wouldnt have to wait until Sept 2016 for the results to come in negative, as the share price would
drop to a penny stock.


 
However, if what the shorts have been accusing all this time is wrong, and NWBO has been doing everything
by the book, or atleast, not illegally (meaning he could state areas that they could have improved on, or done
differently in the future, but nothing illegal), this would then provide legitimacy to NWBO, and Powers, and will
remove that hanging "suspicious" branch that the shorts have used to pressure the share price down.


Moreover, with positive news from this indepedent new board member, the price may actually jump
significantly, considering the short squeeze potential of this stock.


So in a recap, the great news of this additional indepedent board member is that, if NWBO is this huge illegal
funding scheme, the shares crumble sooner than later.


If, the report comes out clean, and now all the allegations, all the misinformation, and suspicious writers that
have or would want to write about NWBO, lose credibility, or more so, the ability to target that suspicion within
retail investors. This is huge, because now, it makes it extremely difficult for shorts to try and drop the share

price with negative articles that "spin" the Cognate relationships, the Power's Enron ties, all the areas that
allowed for suspicion to build, is now gone.


The interesting part of this will be the shorts. With the share price ~ $4 - $5, do the shorts take the chance
that the report is negative, confirming their beliefs, and providing for even more profit, OR do they cash out
here, as they know the upside could be very detrimental to their wallets? If anything, a positive report would
probably cause a good short squeeze to occur, as it could open the flood gates to additional institutional
investors picking up some NWBO shares.

Doc logic
Steven,


If the IND reports are supposed to be confidential then why does the FDA IND site give access to it? Did I
accidentally find a back door which should not be there which could be used to spy on company info without
their knowing about it.? The dates I found on this site indicate ongoing updates, some very recent with at
least one that seems to correspond to the update on clinicaltrials.gov with regard to the active not recruiting
status change.


By the way, with regards to early on potential to change INDs to Dr. Linda Liau's 11053 and your question
"Why didn't they?", maybe NWBO has more experience with DCs and knows how to manipulate them better
than anyone actually realizes. Dr. Liau's area of expertise is in neurosurgery and reporting the effects of DC
therapy, adjuvents and other treatments on brain tissue. NWBO's area of expertise is in activation and
manipulation of DCs themselves. What is new news to much of the scientific community about DCs is actually
old news to NWBO and Cognate. We are trying to catch up to what NWBO already knows and that should
scare the living daylights out of those who are betting against this company because they do not know what
NWBO knows and can only guess as we have been doing. The one thing that I do know is that the prior
research of this company gives them many more very poorly understood tools in their toolbox than anyone
has publicly shared. Institutions have finally started to catch on to this as they don't seem to be backing out in
droves with the recent concerns expressed by this Phase Five article. As a matter of fact, they seem to be
increasing their positions while volume continues to be low.


Sometimes the best way to make money is to buy a fixer-upper, give it a once over and put it on the market
after it looks like a castle fit for a king. Linda should have done the fixing up herself but she didn't listen to
shareholders so Mr. Woodford had to teach her a painfully public lesson about being a CEO of a public
company. Can and will this painful current NWBO situation now be used as premium bear bait or will the
bears feast on London Broil? Stay tuned.(:j) Best wishes.

Man Bohsie, for a so called unbiased analyst you sure do only defend one side of this investment. Just like
Larry you refuse to discuss any risk or acknowledge an poor Management decisions. As Doc said below,
Linda was taught a painfully PUBLIC lesson. You think you would welcome information from a company you
are so bullish on, especially when it could put to rest all of the short allegations you speak of.


Do you have any connection to NWBO?


01 Dec 2015, 08:51 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
Thyfish,


I feel I am unbiased. I dont "spin" information. Is NWBO a risky stock, extremely! Is NWBO illegally funneling
money and just trying to make money on a vaccine they know doesn't work? To date there is no evidence
stating this.


I do not think Linda was taught a lesson. If you read Woodford's SEC statement, he specifies that the board
had already met with the Forensic expert. So NWBO wasnt caught off guard by this statement, they were
probably quite aware of it. Also, you state that NWBO doesn't welcome this? Read the PRnewswire below
that states Linda welcomes this additional board member and will get him on as soon as possible.


http://prn.to/1lsAaTY


I only look at facts. And like all the stocks and companies I invest in, I do my due diligence. There have been
stocks that I thought were gold and as I peeled the onion I sold my shares quickly. And for good reason.


No I do not work for NWBO. I do not profess it is a sure thing, or a sure winner. Do I like the fact that the
share has been easily manipulated by shorts, and the fact that they do not have a good public relations/media
strategy. Of course not. I never said that they are perfect in every way. The Cognate relationship has pros and
cons. Cons in the sense that it has been used as the basis for all the "illegal"/"suspicious" attacks and articles
that has fueled the shorting. However, on the flip side, if the vaccine is truly successful, then it has provided
the shareholder a much better chance of significant increase in investment.


Go back and look at all my posts. I do not state once that NWBO is a sure thing. All I say is that, if you are
willing to risk $5000, (or whatever your comfort level is, maybe its $50K), you could purchase NWBO stock.
The downside is you lose $5K. The upside is that $5K in my mind (and from my conservative calculations),
could increase to $250K. To me that is a risk worth taking.


So no, I don't think NWBO can do no wrong. I am taking a risk, and hoping it pays off. However, I wont scare
easily from suspicious theories. If that was the case, I would have sold my Lululemon shares as it fell from
$40 a share down to a low of $4 a share, instead of continually buying more.

Steven,


You are not the only one who does not know "how "oxygenation levels" and "other factors"" are related to
cellular differentiation and DC mobility. This is part of the science thst many have not paid much attention to
because it DC therapy was basically cast off as a weak, non cost effective therapy while there was still too
much not yet understood about immune response cellular processes. Believe it or not it was one of your posts
about another product involved with cellular repair that led me to a much deeper understanding, through
research, of the tools that NWBO has that could be used to mature and activate DCs. I came to the
conclusion that they are using them to nearly the fullest advantage that they can.


Your concern with regard to enrollment rate is definately worth noting by all investors but until we have the
actual enrollment numbers in hand and not just speculation about them we can draw no definitive conclusion
one way or the other which is why I have come to disdain modeling attempts unless the company releases
regular enrollment reports that they can be held accountable for. VICL supporters had modeling all wrong but
the reported oncologist comments about futility based on the science that they better understood than most
were correct. Don't think that I don't appreciate the effort to try and model, I do but modeling usually just has
too many limitations and because of this I have not found anyone who is consistently exceptional and freely
publicizing this with blinded trials. Best wishes.

I agree with much of your reasoning about why Linda may have wanted to avoid revealing specific types of
cost but.. she easily could have given ranges that would explain simply but in a little more detail how funds
received were being dispersed. Linda just took too long to respond to investor concerns because she didn't
think she needed to. Phase Five simply spelled out all the investor doubts in a way that neither she or Mr.
Woodford could ignore any longer as stewards of public investor interest. The bears are saying "I call your
bluff" publicly because those that are hedged want to cash in one way or the other now as they look to reset
their positions. Best wishes.

Do me a favor please. Go to FDA IND #10206 and go to the FDA website. Type in IND #10206 AND DCVax-

to other IND # requests. What do you make of this?


Additionally, Mr. Woodford's most recent blog that is out today points to his strong interest in Direct and his
willingness to go the distance with it to finish a Phase lll Direct trial. I am really wondering if news about Direct
is being purposely held off to counter any potential bad news with regard to DCVax-L in the near term or to
pile on top of any good news as an absolute crushing blow to the bears. Woodford's comments definately
down play near term expectations. Is he a straight shooter with no poker face or... Best wishes.

Being short, long, straddled or sidelined does not change a trial outcome once regulators have data and are

small dividend. One poster said the payments made by any big holders of naked shorts would be covered up
by large interoperative exchanges of funds between friendly holders of said naked shorts. Would this same
scenario be possible if fractional warrants were used instead? The last prospectus seemed to focus heavily

Sorry, been busy with the end of the year. I will try and do this in the next couple weeks. I take Steve's
opinions on the process being unable to change over the years with a large bag of salt, as he was "spinning"
alot of the information in this Phase V article, like the amounts paid to Cognate (he was including the
inducement charges as well as taking warrant/share invoices as being the same as if Cognate was invoicing
expecting cash), as well as his understanding (and this was in personal messages), of the statistics around
the P3, as he was saying that he could calculate that the OS of DCVax-L needed to be ~ 5 months better than
the SOC to show statistical significance, however, as an engineer and being well versed in statistics, (and I
tried to explain to him but he kept spinning my responses), one can not determine the minimum difference in
months between two populations for statistical significance of 0.05, as it depends on the two populations'
variances. Meaning, if the DCVax-L patients showed 30% living extremely long (> 36 months), a mean
difference of 2 months may show statistical significance. And reversely, if the mean OS difference is 5
months, but the majority of the DCVax-L patients all have OS values just barely over that 5 month amount, a
statistical significance probably wouldnt be shown. It all depends on the variance (or standard deviation) of

the minimum OS difference needs to be.

Bohsie,


The IND site I mentioned suggests certain exemptions, including process, were looked into. Please go to the
site as it is changing and some of the info I found originally is gone. The reference to allogenic placental and
umbilical cord stem cells is now missing but new dates are listed for FDA interactions. Best wishes.

Steven Giardino, Contributor
Bohsie still thinks median difference and hazard ratio p-values are the same I see.


Bohsie said all this trial will need is 2 months OS diff between groups and it will be very significant.


LMAO!!

out of the box
Phase 5 ghost writer, how could you say that successful PFS for GBM is likely not a great thing? To not have
seizures, headaches, etc for an additional 4 months to years longer is not a great thing only a person who is
short the stock would say. Also you accuse and slam the company for paying ghost writers to write optimistic
articles about DCVAX when you yourself are a paid pessimistic ghost writer who has successfully helped to
bring this company down and you have been richly rewarded financially. You are guilty of your own
accusations. Longs have been destroyed by the sinister likes of you and I'm not sure that some of us will be
able to hold on. For your sake though I hope you are right and truthful about the rest of your House of Cards
article. If you are not know that Karma never ever fails. It's timetable unknown. Being in the shadows won't
protect you.

FYI Linda Liau stated on a video that the FDA required PFS as the endpoint because the trial was
reconfigured as a crossover trial which made OS unreliable as a primary endpoint. Pretty important point.
That said, when (if) it comes time to fish or cut bait who knows what FDA will say about PFS as a P3
endpoint.

What do you think was the FDA's reasoning for requiring a crossover arm?


14 Jan 2016, 04:39 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
The crossover speeds up the enrollment and trial process particularly in terms of enrollment. When dealing
with life threatening diseases, there are difficulties in getting patients to enroll when they have 30% chance of
receiving a placebo, and in turn a death sentence. Though they would receive SOC, they might look at other
trials, or possible solutions than DCVax-L. If no matter what, you receive a vaccine, even if initially it is a
placebo, this makes enrollment easier and quicker.


19 Jan 2016, 06:01 PM


Volumelogic
OK, but then why didn't NWBO include this in their initial trial design?


Also, would speeding enrolment compel the FDA to "insist" on changing the trial? I would think they would
only interfere if they felt the additional arm would give them better data.


20 Jan 2016, 01:04 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
Here is the quote from Dr. Liau's Presentation:


"The issue is because we have vaccine made for everybody and we are kinda doing a somewhat invasive
procedure on these patients, the FDA actually required us to have a cross over arm when the patients
progress.


So uh interestingly, the whole cohort actually, um, has not yet reached, uhh you know, its, I guess, um, its pre-
determined event, um, how do I say this, pre-determined number of events. Um and it seems like everyone’s
living longer than we would be expecting. So in reality, I think, you know, what we’re really comparing now is
actually early DC Vaccination versus later DC Vaccination (big smile). And um, and I guess it’s a good thing
that the patients are living longer (laughing), but it’s not really helping our study, because if the patients didn’t
get anything, hopefully, the differences would be bigger. So that’s kind of another lesson learned about these
trials. We have to consider all these different moving parts.


Um, it was difficult to, it’s certainly more difficult to enroll a patient without the cross over arm because they
are going through this invasive procedure, and then tell them we’re making vaccine for you but then we’re just
throwing it away. You know it would be difficult.


But so anyway, we’re still in the middle of this trial, it’s still blinded, and I actually don’t have any data for you
right now."

Thanks again Bohsie. One more question... I thought the "event" was progression. So if a patient is in the
placebo group and progresses, the event has already occurred and counted when he enters the crossover
arm. So why would whatever happens in the crossover arm have any impact on the timing for the study end?


20 Jan 2016, 11:29 AM


Bohsie, Contributor
For enrollment. With a crossover arm, more patients would be interested in enrolling in a trial that they
eventually get their actual vaccine, or drug, rather than taking a chance of being a placebo only patient.


Meaning, if there was no cross-over, and 1/3 of the trial patients were given a placebo, a significant amount of
patients that normally would enter a cross-over styled trial, may try another innovative trial, or treatment
method. Therefore, enrollment would be much more difficult, particularly that there are only ~14,000 cases a
year, and less than that when considering there are only so many enrollment sites.


I hope that makes sense.


20 Jan 2016, 02:53 PM


longimgn
Thank you Bohsie for your up-dates and clarifications....I find them most helpful.....one question please, "If
enrollment is better with the cross-over option, then why is it taking sooooo long to enroll the phase III "L"
trial????" Do you think the "halt in screening, means the trial is enrolled or nearly enrolled and why can't the
company comment on its status???" Thank you and cheers


21 Jan 2016, 12:21 PM


Bohsie, Contributor
Did some digging and this is what I think:


There are 5 EAMS awarded drugs to date, with 3 pending approval. They list 5 EAMS approvals, which are
(including dates of approval): Nivolumab (for melanoma) (May 2015), Nivolumab (for lung cancer) (June
2015), Pembrolizumab (for melanoma) (March 2015), and Sacubitril/valsartan (for heart failure) (Sept 2015),
osimertinib (June 2015).


Now that leaves 3 pending results. Moreover, there are only 13 PIM designations to date, an additional 1 is
pending. Moreover, the EAMS approval process takes ~90 days - 105 days by either the request of the
MHRA or Applicant (and could even be~120 - 150 days if applicants request additional days). Moreover, there
are only specific dates to submit for an EAMS approval, and there were 4 dates that would fall into the 90-120
day approval process; Sept 28, 2015, Oct 26, 2015, Dec 7th, 2015 and January 4th, 2016. So that means that
potentially NWBO could have submitted an application for Sept 28, 2015 (or even Oct. 26, 2015) soon after
the screening halt that NWBO initiated. They did say at the end of Aug they were submitting stuff to
regulators. Now here is some interesting dates in the EAMS approval process; by Day 45, a preliminary
positive opinion may be issued to the applicant. This would be provided around Nov. 12th, 2015 if an
application was submitted for EAMs on Sept 28th.. Now this would have been around the time it came out

that L. Powers was presenting at the Immunotherapy World Conference, as well as NWBO being one of the
big advertisors/sponsors.


The second date that is of interest, is 90 days, which would be kind of a weird timing for an approval notice,
Dec. 27th, 2015. However, here is the kicker, the applicant may request an additional 30 days for the EAMS
decision, and this moves the date to ~January 26th, 2016. Using the Oct submission date, and 90 days, the
decision is on or before January 24th, the day of the Conference.

Doc logic
Bohsie,


With regard to your comments above about regulatory review, you should also keep in mind that Linda does
not want NWBO to see unblinded data until she is sure or at least pretty sure that the regulators have seen it
first if possible. This would give her the chance for regulators to potentially stop the trial for efficacy if the data
is good enough. This process also buys time for implementing an alternative strategy emphasis if the trial is
not stopped by them. FDA EAACs can now be petitioned to review blinded data for endpoint analysis as part
of a new service for companies seeking FDA review of the data especially with regard to interpreting imaging
data as it relates to endpoints. This help seeks to aid companies understand how FDA views their data as
compared to how others see it. As other posters have mentioned elsewhere, anytime FDA has trial data that
appears very favorable they may unblind it without the sponsoring company's knowledge. Linda understands
this. Google: FDA AND EAACs and you can find a video that explains the review process better. The
unblinding of data by FDA is a completely separate matter. Best wishes.

cfriend881
Volumelogic I am a lil confused about the meaning of the TERM Event for the FDA requirement in this trial
...My understanding was for this trial an EVENT was JUST IF a patient Progressed ....meaning showed more
tumor growth....NOT meaning Deceased..... I mean how can you have a Patient Crossover to receive the
formula ! Normal EVENTS are counted as such when a patient in a trial has deceased ! IT is my
understanding that is the whole reason as dr liau has stated is so great about the trial but is unfortunately
taking longer to reach its end ! am I missing something here.....Anybody ?


05 Feb 2016, 01:23 PM


cfriend881
Doc logic I think you may be on to something for the Timing Events you stated ! Especially since the new FDA
guidelines are more favorable for Bio Tech Cancer related Clinical Trials !! Either DR Liau is a lil too overcome
with less robust Data OR Things are definitely about to Produce Positive Benefits for All !!!

cfriend881,


In this Phase lll trial primary endpoint events (counted as events in progression of disease) include a
determination of progression of disease or death (from any source). This means that death, before
progression is observed, is counted as a "progression event" for primary endpoint data purposes. Overall
survival (OS) events occur at death and is a secondary endpoint being compared. This comparative measure
is being made the focus of much of many message board posters right now as this is what Dr. Linda Liau was
obviously referring to when she said that "all patients are living longer" in her video from last October.
RKMATTERS has suggested that PFS (primary endpoint) events may not be showing a clear separation in a
2 to 1 (treatment patients compared to SOC only patients) manner strongly enough for NWBO to choose to
unblind the study to seek approval early. For the record, Linda said she would not seek to end this trial early.
The other possibility is that there is such a strong separation that the interim analysis can not be done
because there are not enough progressers from the treatment arm to reach the events needed to trigger this
interim analysis. What seems obvious to me is that there is either extremely good PFS efficacy for those on
the treatment arm or there is extremely encouraging synergy with crossover treatment regimens which are
basically unrestricted with regard to combination treatment options. This crossover treatment could include
determining genotype or phenotype of the cancer and treating it accordingly with the best and latest
understanding of synergies between DCVax, chemo and checkpoint inhibitors. This is what I find so exciting
about this trial for the patients and has us all wondering why the trial is taking so long.


I know that we are discussing an investment here but I am absolutely thrilled for these patients that are all
living longer. This is making some investors sweat it out with regard to their pocket books but I hope we can
all start to appreciate what our being here and being willing to help support the price of this stock when we
buy it is going to mean for those current and future cancer patients who are helped by immuotherapy
treatments like DCVax. Best wishes.

cfriend, I think you've been following or invested in this stock as long as I have. I sold my shares over a year
ago and only held the warrants too, as I had stated. I got the warrants at what was a steal $1.50 for 15k. So
I'll still loose 22K USD should they expire worthless.....which is looking more likely. It's a shame that the
company has been run so poorly run (or maybe it's on purpose) and that we as investors still believed based
on all of their strategic promotion. They should and need to be held accountable for that. They have run this
company like a private company and have never cared about the retail shareholder. Their poor management
has opened them up to dealing with the vultures that short and cover with the warrants and cheap shares
they get from NWBO, all while Linda isn't diluted.....great deal for her eh? 
Let's hope something positive happens and we can get our investment back minus the years wasted. Life
lessons will teach you the most. Good luck man!

It is unlikely that Steve would wade into the web of business and financial allegations and distortions. 
However he has now passed(5 -10 months ago) from "faith" in the DCVAX science and technology, to major
reservations about at least 2 aspects of the production process and appears to NOW think it is relatively
primitive. 
However he has not yet provided any peer reviewed basic science publications to support his 2 major claims
of reduced efficacy(eg release of inhibitory cytokines etc). 
Nor has he provided any peer reviewed clinical trial evidence that these 2 primary basic mechanisms reduce
the efficacy of the DCVAX-L technology in terms of either P.F.S or O.S.

they have used a private service to register their domain name to hide their identity.

Smith On Stocks, Contributor
There is one inherent contradiction that runs through all the short attacks on NWBO in the approximate eleven such
articles published on Seeking Alpha over the last two years or so. Except for one, all were written by anonymous short
sellers. They make two essential points. The first is that the science behind DCVax-L and DCVax Direct is flawed and
there is no chance that the products will be effective. I would remind people that this technology is based on the role
of the dendritic cell in activating the active and innate immune system. This won their discoverers the Nobel Prize in
2011. Secondly, there has already been one product approved that uses dendritic cell vaccine technology. That was
Provenge which was approved on the basis of a 4.5 month improvement in median overall survival in metastatic colon
cancer (4.5 months is considered by key opinion leaders to be a significant advance). To me, this suggests that
dendritic cell cancer vaccines like DCVax-L and DCVax Direct are based on solid science. I for one feel that cancer
vaccines could be a major advance in the treatment of cancer and dendritic cell cancer vaccines are an extremely
logical approach.  
The next point that the short selling articles make is that Linda Powers has a major stake in Cognate and Northwest;
Cognate is the manufacturer of DCVax-L and DCVax Direct. Northwest in large part because of constant short selling
and coordinated attack articles like this has been cash starved. If Cognate had demanded cash for manufacturing
these products, NWBO would have been unable to continue the trials. Cognate instead has accepted over 20 million

shares of NWBO for its services. The shorts on the one hand tell us that this stock is worthless and then say that this
is transferring wealth away for NAWBO shareholders. There is no question that the DCVax-L phase 3 trial would have
been suspended and the DCVax Direct trial would never have taken place without Cognate accepting stock in lieu of
cash. I think that all NWBO shareholders should thank Cognate for its role in keeping the trials going. If the shorts are
correct, Cognate has accepted worthless stock of NWBO in lieu of $80 million or more of cash. Hmmmm. 
This is an article like almost all the other negative Seeking Alpha articles is written by anonymous authors who are
short the stock. This article alleges criminal misconduct on the part of NWBO management. This is an extremely
serious charge and I believe that we entitled to know who the authors are. It is also troubling that they are short before
the article was published. This is consistent with stock manipulation. I think that Seeking Alpha should demans that all
authors publish under their real names. The information in this article has large components taken from previous
Seeking Alpha articles. At its heart there is nothing new. For those of you who are perplexed by this unrelenting attack
on Northwest Biotherapeutics, I suggest that you look at three links. . http://tinyurl.com/qz2... and

UK and Germany,to determine if DCVAX technology and science is NOW relatively primitive. 
3)When Steve had "faith" in DCVAX technology(6-10 months ago) he actually stated in print(SA platform) that
he spent his own funds to higher a stat.consult. to estimate the "effect size "of the DCVAX efficacy. 
3) He was then equally skeptical of the magnitude of the placebo effect in the Nov. 2014 IMUC double blind
randomized study and refused to consider the possibility that the placebo effect is mediated through a
conditioned response based on neuroimmunology(National Academy of Sciences 1989).

I have a question for the author and anyone willing to respond. Is Powers involvement in the creation of these
ancillary businesses legal if, in fact, they are siphoning off investor equity in NWBO? And, is anyone asking Powers
about this?


Furthermore, if patients are receiving paid DCVax treatment in Israel that is not being accrued on the books of NWBO
directly, that would be so dispicable there'd have to be a new word invented to describe it.


I'm hoping for all NWBO longs that news breaks of a positive nature on the Phase-3 trial even if the treatment doesn't
go on to receive regulatory approval. That would give most long-suffering shareholders an opportunity to exit
gracefully if they chose to do so.


All-in-all a disturbing article.


Oh, and longimgn, if I ever grow up, I want to be as even tempered as you. Noble response.

If Chad Lerner has more than one share, I'd be surprised. He certainly has less than $20k in losses as that's
what I said I'd lost when I called... and they wanted to know if I wanted to be the lead plaintiff. I asked what

For quite a while Linda had more than 50% voting rights in the company which essentially gave her full

One would need to win the argument that a better deal could be found elsewhere to prove wrongdoing. That

Larry, at one point I use to take your analysis very seriously but now I'm sceptical. You definitely say what us
longs like to hear but just don't offer support in the way of facts for certain obvious issues. Besides mentioning
this is of course a risk because it is a Biotech, you have never brought up or addressed relevant concerns,
why? Is this all short manipulation or does the company have a part in the sp decline because of their total
lack of transparency. I have asked you a few times without response. Here is a recent post I wrote, I would
like your thoughts or refute if possible;


Let me first state that the obvious motivation behind the short piece was to drive down the sp. They're using
scare tactics and invalid facts which IMO takes away from any credibility the "analysis" has. That being said,
there are definitely a few things they mention that should be addressed by management, period.


- What is the relationship and arrangement with Cognate. What exactly are we paying for and why does it
seem to be so excessive in comparison to other similar trials. Nobody can possibly make a well informed
case that the relationship is a good thing for shareholders without the details.


- This is the first I have seen about technology transfers to Dennis M. Is this true? If so why?


- Why has screening been suspended and what has the company done to date to rectify? What is their
estimate for when this screening halt will be lifted?


- What is going on with Direct? The company laid out unrealistic timelines for start, data, completion, and start
of Phase II that have not been met. Why?


- What is going on with HE and EA programs? Once again the company was quick to PR the benefits this had
but has failed to keep shareholders informed of what is gong on?


Call me a short, dismiss my concerns all you like, but this type of information matters to me and a lot of
investors that like to make well informed decisions and mitigate as much risk as possible from an already
risky sector. I don't have to sell and I don't want to sell. I have followed the guidance of this Management
Team for years, they were the ones that laid out false expectations that kept me invested. They should be the
ones to clarify the points so that I can make a decision, not me having to sell and move on.

Well as a lot of people now know my stance has changed on this company. I haven't felt the need to update my SA
followers because they are so few in number and anyone who really cares about my opinion already knows it. And a
few people I like still wanted to remain invested, so why offend them with a NWBO bear piece?


The strength of the article imo is in its uncovering of the gross imbalance in spending on this P3 as compared with
other companies in similar positions (like ARGS--thank me later austin, let's see if they actually get there).


The authors could have done better on their discussion of why the science is suspect. Too few TAA in one tumors
sample relative to DC numbers. When you work the math there ends up being just 800 or so tumor associated
antigens for the 2.5 million DC to fight over (1:3,000 is the ratio of TAA to self-antigens).


That's the first prob. The second one is using freeze thaw cycling to necrose lysate releases inhibitory cytokines that
when mixed with immature DC actually inhibit their maturation. Of course only mature DC may migrate to lymph
nodes. Researchers were hoping the nerosed lysate would mature DC after they picked up antigens (as happens in
vivo) but those damn cytokines prevent it. This was only really discovered around 2008, well after they had started the
P3. No going back..


It's just old tech, and no one really uses while tumor lysate loaded DC vacc anymore except a random academic
study here or there. mRNA is where it's at.

If you ARE going to use WTL loaded DC vacc you should stress the tumor cells before necrosing them via repeat
freeze thaw cycling. They real ease far less inhibitory cytokines that way. Or add a dedicated maturational step post
loading. Unfortunately DCVax does neither.


UCLA researchers don't even bother anymore without adding TLR agonists to the regimen, which are supposed to aid
in DC maturation in vivo and also provoke a heightened immune response. Also not used in this P3.


Also modeling looks quite bad after the German label became public, showing a very, very slow enrollment ramp until
mid 2012 and also showing the 33 from 2008 had almost half in the info arm. So their events don't count towards the
66 from Dec 2013 as much as I thought.


Anyway I said all this as I became aware of it on the message boards and was met with more vitriol than I have ever
seen in my life. But it's cool, I can't really be offended by internet personas who don't know me at all.


DCVax Direct also has issues and there was much massaging of data to make it look pretty. A deeper examination
shows over 85% of patients had progressive disease from 9-15 weeks. That's horrible, and shows no systemic effect
is occurring. Really though they were hoping for significant shrinkage and even said as much, but there wasn't even
ONE partial response from the study. Compare that with intratumoral IL-2 injections. What a difference! Direct is
useless.


Sorry if all that offends you, but I'm just being honest. If I was short I would have already covered, so I'm not trying to
manipulate the price by posting this. Do what you want, but do yourselves and your families a favor and put no more
than 5% at risk in any one security.


Good luck!

Sorry, I do not understand your recent switch in stance due to some of the DCVax trial data, both Direct & -L ?

I will say that Cognate receiving warrants & shares instead of cash, should not be evaluated the same as if
NWBO paid Cognate cash for manufacturing services. If Cognate required $30 Million for manufacturing

services, I am pretty sure that NWBO didn't pay them $30 Million in shares. There is a huge risk associated
with accepting the shares in lieu of cash, so I would be very confident that Cognate received some additional
"risk" up charge when taking shares for cash. Therefore, stating that the manufacturing costs were extremely
high, and using the share prices as 1 to 1 would not be a fair assessment. If NWBO had a big pharma
partner, those costs would be a fraction of the costs they show. By going it alone, and with very little infused
cash, NWBO is paying a premium to complete phase III. That in my opinion is why it has such a great
potential. If positive results/ or approval, NWBO's share price will jump significantly.


On a side note, I did some research into the FDA, and I found that the FDA has based accelerated approvals
(1992 - 314 subpart H) on serious or life threatening illnesses, on surrogate endpoints, like PFS, which is
reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA even states that increased PFS is shown to be if clinical
benefit, even if the OS doesnt show a huge increase. This tells me that (and from PFS results of numerous
immotherapy vaccine trials, ICT-107 for example), that with a good PFS response, even if the OS may not be
that great, DCVAx-L may have a good chance of achieving accelerated approval. Of course that is if PFS
results show strong improvements.

Hey Bohsie,


The massaging of data as I put it is referring to the omission of many important available data from that study,
but which NWBO sort of let slip anyway. They presented data in a way that made it appear as if patients were
living well beyond what would be expected for their indication. But actually many of these patients were
ECOG 0 and also stage III ("locally advanced"). The survival of patients in the Direct trial is about in line with
what would be expected when those variables are considered.


Most importantly there are no PFS data divulged. The reason is it's pretty awful. How did they let it slip
anyway? By stating the reason patients were taken off therapy was due to progression of disease and then
stating how many patients got a certain number of doses. Well, not many at all got their 5th and 6th shot.
Those were administered at week 16 and 32. In fact only 15% got 5 shots or more and only 7% got all six. So
between week 16 and 32, 93% of the patients had progressive disease and between week 8 and week 16
85% had progressive disease. That's defined in this trial as "25% growth of the sum of all measurable lesions
over 1cm in diameter." So unfortunately no real systemic effect.


But they don't tell investors or the public any of that. And they say nothing of ORR. Because even after well
over a year on therapy for all patients not even one had significant shrinkage.


The P2 may improve on this, but I don't think by much. Notice that the average number of lesions of patients
in the trial is "3." That means many patients had 2 or only 1 lesion in the P1 leg anyway. In the P2 leg they will
inject "1-3 measurable lesions."


As far as how much has been charged for this P3, let's get it from the source for how much it should have
cost:

Q: Why did you give up on prostrate when it has a larger financial potential? Why not focus here instead of on
the brain cancer?


NWBO's Linda Powers: It’s purely a function of dollars and time. The dollars to conduct the prostrate trial
phase 3 is 35 to 40 mil, for brain, it’s 10 to 15 million which is an utterly different scale of resources to come
up with. "


http://tinyurl.com/plf...


$10mm-$15mm for the phase 3 trial? Okay, well then why have they dropped $140mm in payments to
Cognate so far? That's majority cash, btw.


Let's look at it another way. For manufacturing 278 vaccines in their P2 trial, IMUC incurred costs of $13.7
mm total (R&D expense figures for 2012 and 2011- $7.7 mm and $6 mm for a total of $13.7 mm - when they
enrolled/made vaccine for 278 patients). During the years 2008/2009, Cognate was paid $3 mm more than
this for making 33 vaccines only.


There is only one additional step with DCVax L and it can't cost that much more to make. And that cost may
be offset by not needing synthetic antigens.


The only logical conclusion is that Linda Powers is overcharging because she can. And for the purpose of
building up Cognate, which no NWBO shareholder has any stake in. Am I wrong?


Never really had a prob with PFS here as it is AA they are seeking. So agree with you there. But I also think
they won't come close to stat sig.

Steve, 
Please provide primary sources and references for your present claim that at least 2 aspects DCVAX
technology is now primitive. 
Also I am very sorry for your previous personal money investment in a stat.consult to attempt to estimate the
"effect size "of DCVAX-l technology. 
Is there any controlled CLINICAL data to support these claims that the technology is now relatively primitive.? 
I recall how skeptical you were about the magnitude of the placebo effect in the IMUC nov.2014 phase 2
r.d.b.IMUC clinical trial. 
Incidentally the placebo effect may operate through neuroimmunology(National Academy of Sciences (1989) 
Good luck with your finances and education.

I can post more over the weekend if I have time.


Quote: 
Unmodified freeze-thaw tumor cell lysates inhibited the toll-like receptor-induced maturation and function of
bone marrow-derived DCs, preventing up-regulation of CD40, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex
class II, and reducing secretion of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-12 p70, tumor necrosis factor-a,
and IL-6].


Quote:


Lysate-induced DC suppression was partially reversed in vitro by induction of tumor cell stress before lysis,
and only DCs loaded with stressed lysates afforded protection against tumor challenge in vivo. These data
suggest that ex vivo freeze-thaw of tumor cells does not effectively mimic in vivo immunogenic necrosis.


Quote:


The commonest strategy, however, has been to load DCs with ostensibly “necrotic” tumor cell lysates,
generated by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, with the solid debris removed by centrifugation. DCs
loaded with such lysates have provided modest protection in various animal models,9-11 and stimulated
limited responses in a range of clinical trials.


 
Quote: 
As the immune response generated by DCs is related to their maturation state, we hypothesized that DCs,
which had taken up TAA in the form of necrotic lysates, and were then matured using a range of TLR
agonists, would represent a potent anticancer vaccine. In this study, we show that freeze-thaw lysates in fact
inhibit the maturation of DCs in response to a range of TLR ligands, interfere with DC/T-cell interactions, and
selectively target particular signaling pathways. To some extent, these effects are shown to be reduced by
stressing cells before lysis. These data have important implications for the optimal preparation of tumor cell
lysate-based vaccines for clinical application.


 
And even touch on what UCLA have been trying from 2003-2010, and are continuing with even today:


Quote: 
Recent studies have shown that combining TLR ligands can enhance cytokine release by DCs,36 with the
combination of poly I:C (a TLR3 agonist) and CpG (a TLR9 agonist), particularly effective for IL-12 p70
production. To test whether this potent combination could overcome the inhibition of phenotypic maturation
and IL-12 p70 release caused by lysates, further experiments were conducted using poly I:C and CpG in
place of LPS. As with LPS, up-regulation of CD40, CD86, and I-A was reduced by lysates, whereas CD80
remained unaffected (Fig. 1E); production of IL-12 p70 was again inhibited to a similar degree.


 
And then conclude with:

are broad, extending over a range of tumor models, mouse strains, and maturation stimuli. These data also
show that DCs pulsed with freeze-thaw lysates are likely to skew CD4 responses away from an optimal TH1
profile, are unable to cross-present lysate-derived TAA, and are less effective at activating specific CD8 cells
even when favorably loaded exogenously with specific peptide epitopes.


http://tinyurl.com/p94...


Also of not is how few TAA there are in any one tumor sample. The problem is in DCVax L they match DC cell
quality with tumor lysate quantity (or thereabouts). 2.5 mil DC cells and about 2.5 mil necrosed tumor lysate
cells (half a cc each). But at a 1:3,000 ratio of TAA:self-antigens in any one GBM tumor sample those 2.5 mil
DC are fighting over just 800 TAA. So only 800 or LESS dendritic cells can potentially provoke an immune
response. Then these must overcome the above to mature and be able to migrate to lymph nodes. Then
there are BBB issues on top of that for whatever t-cells are signaled to respond.


And please provide even the faintest smidgeon of evidence a placebo effect can do anything to thwart
progression of stage IV cancer (I mean my god man really?!)

Thank you very much for these quotes.Please provide references for the peer reviewed journals in which they
were printed or links to the peer reviewed journals. 
Thanks a lot for the one you provided to the NCBI data base.


I suspect you have no time with lectures and clerkships to review the bench basic science literature on
Neuroimmunology.It begins in the 1970s and the tightly controlled studies are still limited to animals. 
However you will have lectures on the magnitude and but UNRELIABILITY of human placebo responding
(from cancer to diabetes,to warts)if you are attending a first rate medical school like Stanford or Harvard.This
is why the NIH has never caved in to the drug lobby seeking to drop double blind placebo controlled
randomized clinical trials. 
Thanks and god luck with your studies and finances

Before I write a more extensive response to some of your comments here can you provide a different link to
the above referenced material as I am having trouble accessing the one you gave. Also, can you please state
what you found about maturation stage when lysate is exposed to DCS as many publications seem to leave
out this important information. As you have referenced earlier, NWBO actually uses undifferentiated
monocytes not actual DCs to start with and not fully differentiated DCs to expose the lysate to. Every stage of
maturation has the potential to react differently to cytokine simulation and oxygen levels so this is a critical
factor with regard to any discussion about influences on derived cellular characteristics. Thanks and best
wishes.

Hey Doc,


That's the only one I have. But you can just cut n paste a couple sentences I quoted and do a Google search.


As far as differentiation of DC, yes in that paper they followed the same protocol as with DCVax L (IL-4 + GM-
CSF, etc).


I'd like some comment on the few very specific issues I raised:


1) Very few TAA in a tumor sample means there are very few TAA vs an overwhelming majority of self-
antigens in DCVax-L. About a 1:3,000 ratio based on tumor sampling data I've seen. That would mean the 2.5
million cell (approximate) sample of lysate mixed with 2.5 mil DC is only combining 800 or so TAA with 2.5 mil
DC. At least ICT-107 is combining millions of TAA (although synthetic) with millions of DC. But only hundreds
with DCVax-L. What are less than 1,000 DC with patient-specific TAA loaded supposed to do?


2) Of the less than 1,000 DC that actually express TAA in a 1cc shot of DCVax-L and so can provoke an
immune response, it seems the process of loading DC with freeze-thaw necrosed lysate inhibits their
subsequent maturation, so how many of these are matured? There are no additional maturation steps with
DCVax-L either. Therefore of those 1,000 that can actually do something, how many are mature enough to
migrate to lymph nodes? Some number less, right? Say 10% are not affected by the inhibitory properties of
the ex vivo necrosed lysate. So we are now down to 80-100 CELLS that can do anything?


3) No doubt t-cells are able to encroach the BBB, but much less so than can invade other organs (by far). So
how many of those t-cells the some 80-100 DC provoke make it through? If each DC provokes 20 t-cells
(being generous) then perhaps 2,000 CD8+ get going. Okay, maybe 10% of these get through the BBB. Now
we have a whole 200 t-cells trying to stop millions of cells from proliferating.


4) On Direct, the company stated they expected to see results within "2 months of therapy." They were hoping
for significant shrinkage. That just didn't happen. But worse it seems the vacc didn't slow progression at all.
85% of patients had 25% or more growth across the sum of the diameter of all target lesions (those over 1
cm) or the appearance of new lesion(s), defined as PD in this trial, from 9-15 weeks in. I know they are only
injecting one at a time in the P1 (and will inject "1-3" in the P2) but some of these patients only HAD 1 or 2
target lesions. If tumors were found to be filled with immune cells and necrosis they are not labeled PD (as
per irRC). So it was genuine PD. Tell me what good Direct did? The survival chart is only noise without a

concurrent control group. When you consider many patients were stage III (and maybe some stage II) and
had ECOG 0 the 16 month mOS is not impressive.


5) Linda Powers claimed the DCVax-L P3 trial would only cost around "10mm - $15mm." Why has it cost so
far hundreds of millions? Why was IMUC able to make vaccine for 278 patients and conduct a large multi-
center trial for a TOTAL of about $14mm (incidentally in line with LP comments) but NWBO is encroaching on
$400mm in R&D costs from 2007 to today? Isn't that obscene? And they haven't signed ANY increase
manufacturing agreements with Cognate yet, and admit that they only have capacity for clinical trial
manufacturing in their 10-k:


"The manufacturing of our product candidates will have to be greatly scaled up for commercialization, and
neither we nor other parties in the industry have experience with such scale-up.


As is the case with any clinical trial, our Phase III clinical trial of DCVax-L for GBM involves a number of
patients that is a small fraction of the number of potential patients for whom DCVax-L may be applicable in the
commercial market. The same will be true of our other clinical programs with our other DCVax product
candidates. If our DCVax-L, and/or other DCVax product candidates, are approved for commercial sale, it will
be necessary to greatly scale up the volume of manufacturing, far above the level needed for the trials.
Neither we nor our contract manufacturers have experience with such scale-up. In addition, there are very
few consultants or advisors in the industry who have such experience and can provide guidance or
assistance, because active immune therapies such as DCVax are a fundamentally new category of product in
two major ways: these active immune therapy products consist of living cells, not chemical or biologic
compounds, and the products are personalized. To our knowledge, no such products have successfully
completed the necessary scale-up for commercialization without material difficulties. For example, Dendreon
Corporation has encountered substantial difficulties trying to scale up the manufacturing of its Provenge®
product for commercialization.


The necessary specialized facilities, equipment and personnel may not be available or obtainable for the
scale-up of manufacturing of our product candidates.


The manufacture of living cells requires specialized facilities, equipment and personnel which are entirely
different than what is required for the manufacturing of chemical or biologic compounds. Scaling up the
manufacturing of living cell products to volume levels required for commercialization will require enormous
amounts of these specialized facilities, equipment and personnel - especially where, as in the case of our
DCVax product candidates, the product is personalized and must be made for each patient individually. Since
living cell products are so new, and have barely begun to reach commercialization, the supply of the
specialized facilities, equipment and personnel needed for them has not yet developed. It may not be possible
for us or our manufacturers to obtain all of the specialized facilities, equipment and personnel needed for
commercialization of our DCVax product candidates. This could delay or halt our commercialization."

The tightly controlled studies documenting the impact of learning("placebo") on the immune system in
neuroimmunology, are TODAY limited to animals .Immune cells have recptors for neuro transmitters,the
sympathetic nervous system is hard wired into immune tissue etc etc.(National Academy of Sciences
1989,Robertson et al 1996,Cameron 2002). That is how science moves forward to illuminate 4,000 years
clinical observations(eg spontaneous remission,placebo effect,etc) on malignant tumors(Mukherjee
2011).Your demand for instant and reliable human clinical outcomes is unfortunate and as you will ,I suspect
learn. 
Your plausible and perhaps even cogent speculations on the impact of 2 or more technical procedures with
D.C. cells ,on the eventual impact of the mechanisms of efficacy of DCVAX -L and Direct will have to wait on
randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical studies. 
Financial and academic good fortune to you.

Steven Giardino, Contributor
To you too Tinsley. And what you said is obviously true that we will only know for sure if DCVax L is effective
or not once the trial concludes, but of course by then it will be too late for those invested now. Putting
speculative bets where you think they have the best chance of success is the point of investing in small cap
bios. As more information came to light to me my opinion on NWBO changed. That's really all. Could be right
or wrong of course but I've seen enough to avoid an investment here going forward.


There may be a short-mid term trade opp here though as the pps seems to have somewhat stabilized and
once the hold lifts and Direct P2 trials start and they get another cash infusion from Woody early into 2016
this could be back over $7. I wouldn't stay any longer than that though.

The ratio of DCs to TAAs being 3,000 hardly sounds problematic, in fact it sounds like a strong argument FOR
DC-led treatment, i.e., training the army of DC's to find and attack the tumor would make the tumor have no
chance if its "targets" are so wildly outnumbered (and maybe the reason why, thankfully, such a large
proportion of people do not get GBM in the first place).


Also, you have to provide more detail on your so-called "deeper examination" that asserts that 85% of
patients had progressive disease from 9-15 weeks, and then help us understand how this purported
progression implies that DCVAX is futile for those that already have rapidly-progressing malignant brain
tumors, particularly if such a treatment has no significant side effects.


When you look at the patient by patient bar charts that NWBO provides, do you honestly think to yourself that
rapidly progressing GBM patients are just as well off without DCVAX?

Steven Giardino, Contributor
Just a quickie, then I have to go downtown to get drunk and check out all the weird costumes.


The ratio of DC to TAA is a problem, because it means only 800 or so DC at MOST will uptake any useful
antigens. Of course it should be some number less because some DC will pick up more than one TAA. Could
be only a few hundred that uptake 1 or more TAA.


So ALL the rest of the 2,499,700 DC are useless...


Then that tiny army of 300 activated DC are now required to migrate themselves to the t-cell rich lymph
nodes. But no can do if immature, or even partly mature: http://tinyurl.com/q2s...


Freeze thaw cycling lysate to necrose those cells inhibits DC maturation (as I linked before). The theory was
that since DC mature when they encounter necrosed cells in vivo (true) that therefore immature DC would
uptake antigens (immature > than mature at this) and then mature just after, and thus be able to migrate with
"the goods" to lymph nodes to provoke a t-cell response. It was a good idea but like most things we
manipulate ex vivo, necrosing lysate via repeat freeze thaw cycling had negative and unexpected and
UNNOTICED consequences (inhibitory cytokines released, etc). So now how many of these 300 DC will
actually get to the lymphs? Maybe none.


Then it looks like you got confused or maybe I didn't explain it well enough but I was speaking of DCVax-
Direct, not L, when I talked about the 85% with PD between 9-15 weeks. The reason is simple: patients were
taken off therapy upon progression of disease (stated right in SITC abstract). Their lesions were monitored for
immune response (according to irRC), so there were no "false PD" assessments. And we know only 6/40
(15%) patients got 5 or 6 shots and only 3/40 (7%) got their 6th shot. Shot 5 was given at week 16 and 6 at
week 32. So 85% of patients were PD and taken off therapy between weeks 9-15 and 93% were PD and
taken off therapy between weeks 17-31. That's a pretty poor systemic effect demonstration. Notice NWBO
only talk about "8 week stable disease (SD)" data, which are completely useless... No where will you find any
correlation between 8 week SD data and overall survival. And keep in mind that in the DCVax-Direct trial
"stable disease" can be 24% growth of the sum of the diameters of all target lesions. If all target lesions of a
patient grow 24% in 8 weeks would you say that's a good thing? I know I wouldn't. SD has been criticized as
less than useful. And that's why it does not constitute a "response" via RECIST criteria.


As for the DCVax-L info arm, patient characteristics of these patients (passed initial screening for entry into
DCVax-L P3) far exceed that of those in the 6 studies NWBO quotes from, where they get their "10 months

mOS with SOC" stuff. 15.3 months mOS makes sense. Why? Because many patients from the other studies
had "biopsy only" (most of tumor not resected), were ECOG 2 or K score <70, were over 70 years old, had
total lymphocyte counts below 1,000/mm3, etc. Many of them would have been turned away from entry into
the DCVax-L study before they were even tested for PD post radiotherapy. They have much worse prognoses
than those of the info arm. So, no the result is no surprise at all.

1) NWBO argues that partially mature DCs are active and do matter, the paper you refer to does not convince
me otherwise. 
2) I just looked at the 2014 SITC Subbiah, et. al. poster and I do not see a discussion on when folks were
dropped from injections which in turn implies progression; if you want to prove this point then send a link
please. 
3) Honestly, as a layman you are losing me on the whole freeze thaw gobbledygook, translate it if you want to
be convincing to those who want an effective treatment for cancer and a solid investment. 
3) Still no pre-2014 IMUC "bar chart" from you Steve or your ghost writer Phase 5. Perhaps when you're back

Xtray,


Yeah thank you for displaying a little of that oh so common NWBO long paranoia ;)


I didn't ghost write this shit. All of my stuff focuses on DATA. And I know full well this trial is seeking AA and so
PFS is actually the appropriate ep for that. I do have over 40 pages written right now but basically stopped
when this tanked to $6. While I was busy writing I guess I should have been shorting. Then it flopped down
more to $4 and climbed back to here. The only position I'm thinking about here is a temporary long one.
Especially with Branko out there talking all bullish and maybe getting a nod to fire off another $10mm in open
market buys. And then Woody prob coming to save the day all the way up until the P3 failure. The pps looks
pretty stable here, prob only place to go is up. So no, I didn't ghost write this piece. Frankly I would have done
a better job. You should see what I have so far.


1) They do not say anything about part mature DC for DCVax-L, and so again you are confusing their two
lead tx. The idea of injecting tumors with partially mature DC (DCVax-DIRECT) makes sense to me, as there
are always pockets of necrosis in larger lesions. May not be the best idea to inject smaller lesions but the
resultant cytokine release can also induce necrosis so that might work. Then those DC pick up antigens in
their part mature state and mature due to interaction with NATURALLY necrotic cellular matter and then may
theoretically be able to migrate to lymphs. I think DCVax-Direct is largely impotent for other reasons. The one
thing that would have convinced me otherwise is a) significant shrinkage and b) some evident delaying of
progression of disease. Saw neither of these in the DCVax-Direct P1.

So no, my whole point about immature DC inhibited from maturation in the DCVax-L slurry has evidence in
literature AND is relevant to DCVax-L. The repeat freeze-thaw cycling process releases certain cytokines that
inhibit subsequent DC maturation. And as that link I provided last shows, it's ESSENTIAL for effecting any
sort of t-cell response. The only reason partially mature DC MAY work in Direct is because they CAN actually
mature in the tumor microenvironment thereafter. Although here too I doubt a whole lot of that goes on, or if it
does I doubt very many migrate to lymphs. T-cells in the tumor microenvironment isn't all that rare to see in
larger lesions. They are signaled there by the various mechanisms including the "natural" necrosis that is the
result of the lesions growing faster than an oxygen supply via new blood vessels can be provided = dead and
dying pockets of cells. So the sometimes appearance of those in Direct-treated lesions isn't a useful correlate
imo. Especially because these t-cells seem to be doing NO apoptosis (resulting in shrinkage), which is what
you'd want to be seeing going on there.


2) "We designed a phase I study to determine the safety of intratumoral injection of activated DC by
administering the product repeatedly until disease progression..."


http://bit.ly/1HkROxV


Sorry it was the AACR abstract.


3) Don't know how to break it down to you any better buddy. DC must be immature (best) or partly mature
(okay) to pick up antigens. DC MUST be mature to migrate to lymph nodes. Not a targeted one anyway.
Those found there subsequently were drawn via other processes, not due to DC vaccine.


So there is no t-cell response unless DC can migrate to t-cell rich lymph nodes. Tumor lysate that has been
necrosed via repeat freeze-thaw cycling releases cytokines that inhibit DC maturation. So mixing in immature
DC with a slurry of freshly necroses lysate that has just been repeat freeze thawed inhibits those DCs
maturation. Thus DCVax-L is a bunch of useless DC, with only maybe 400 or so of them even loaded with
useful antigens anyway.


3) (part 3b?) Why do you need an IMUC bar chart? I'm confused.


Yes it was a fun night. Hope yours was too.

arena than what your paper observes: http://bit.ly/1PZvYIl


2) Do you have a link to an actual paper or study that shows that the 8-10 month recurrent GBM survival
experience that NWBO compares info arm results to is from mainly a group that's skewed to the overly old
and worse off than a "rapid progressor" group that could have entered the Dcvax Phase 3?

Xtray,


1) Bridges the "gap?" How? I thought it just reinforced the understanding that only mature moDC migrate.
This was interesting though:


"The magnitude and quality of CD4+ T cell response was proportional to the number of antigen-carrying DCs
that reached the lymph node and could be boosted up to 40-fold by preinjection of tumor necrosis factor that
conditioned the tissue for increased DC migration."


Be nice if DCVax-L involved TNF-a somehow. Or DCVax-Direct.


Your second source described the difference between Langerhan cell's migration and other dendritic cells,
among other things. The DC used in DCVax are PBMC derived. Not DC of the skin and mucosa.


2) You can research all six of those studies NWBO cites and look at the patient characteristics yourself. Not
hard to do. Then compare them with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the DCVax L trial. Much different.

Doc logic
Steven,


You have missed a couple of very important points in your response to Xtray. The first is Dr. Bosch referred to
necrotic areas of the tumor as zones where Direct would NOT work. The second misconception that you have
is where the tumors are targeted for injection and Dr. Bosch said injections initially are made near the tumor
surface. That of course is so that the DCs will be closer to the lymph zone. There are also subsets of CD4+ T-
cells that can be induced to respond to DC inflammatory signals. You are missing some of the key ingredients
to understanding how Direct functions which has led you to jump to conclusions. Don't wait too long on that
position you are thinking about taking in NWBO.


I believe there is a portion of the activation process that DCVAX-L and Direct utilize that works to initially
interfere with cancer cell function and that this is part of the "secret sauce". As much as I agree with you that
L can be improved, this does not negate the "limited effect" imparted by the DCs that L currently utilizes
coupled with what I believe is an inhibitory MO imparted by activation process. I believe that Mr. Woodford
sees this and will not give up on this company. Best wishes.


01 Nov 2015, 08:55 PM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
Doc,


I think you may have misunderstood what I wrote. Of course they avoid necrotic regions of the tumor when
injecting Direct, because they obviously want to have an effect on viable tumor. But these DC do need some
necrosis or apoptosis to have a source of antigens:


"Using the tumour as the site of vaccination ensures that antigen is locally available and that the target
antigens need not be defined. Nevertheless, it still remains to transfer tumour-associated antigens, whether
antigen-encoding DNA or RNA, or translated proteins or digested peptides, from the tumour cell to the
dendritic cell within the tumour in vivo. A very applicable strategy to provide endogenous tumour antigens to
dendritic cells is the combination of intratumoral dendritic cells with systemic cytotoxic therapies. A number of
recent reports describe the use of systemic chemotherapeutics that cause tumour cell death, combined with
intratumoral dendritic cells."


"I believe there is a portion of the activation process that DCVAX-L and Direct utilize that works to initially
interfere with cancer cell function and that this is part of the "secret sauce"." -DL


You can just read the patent, it's not all that special really. I actually suspect it may not hold up under
challenge either. Difficult to try and TM intratumoral dendritic cell injection. And there are many ways to
prepare and activate DC prior to injecting them. But anyway, there's just better stuff out there. IT TLR
agonists, IL-2, CpG oligo, etc.

In addition to invoking no tumor responses, Direct evidently cause NO systemic effect, and that really was all
its charm. Injecting more lesions and with more frequency will doubtful do much good, imo.


One more thing, consider these references:


"On the other hand, a given tumor cell expresses about 30,000 genes at a given time of which only about 30
are of tumoral origin (Velculescu et al.,1999), thus the density of tumoral antigen in tumor cell preparations is
presumably low."


[my note: in GBM it's even lower, hence my 1:3,000 ratio]


"...and with regard to the low frequency of tumoral proteins in whole tumor cell preparations, only a low level
of antigen presentation can thus be achieved by lysate loading."


"Although several studies have reported some induction of anti-tumoral immunity by DC loaded with tumor
cell lysate even when very low tumor protein concentrations were applied for a short period of time, lysate
loading was less efficient in trials when compared to apoptotic pancreatic tumor cells (Schnurr et al., 2002) or
for acute myeloid leukemia (Galea-Lauri et al., 2002) and failed to elicit an anti-EBV T-cell immunity when
lysates from Epstein-Barr virus-trans-formed lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to load DC."


"Nevertheless, a cell loss of up to 40% of the initial DC number should be calculated when DC therapy with
loaded and cryopreserved DC is planned. In four out of five experiments performed we found the lowest rate
of recovery for DC loaded with necrotic cell material."

Now compare this with Provenge efficacy which loses none, not being cryopreserved. Will that hamper
efficacy? 40% is a lot.


But yeah, good luck. I'm going long soon and will be out again before next summer. No longer like NWBO's
fundamentals but it does seem nice here for a trade. I like ACHN much, much better. ICPT looking good too
(not worried about recent data). And ARGS. And even IMUC. Less than 10% in those, and less than 5% in
IMUC, but I'm very heavily weighted ACHN. Also heavy RUSL after the recent flash crash. I think all of those
entries are fabulous right now. Let's see how the tickers I mentioned above (esp ACHN and RUSL) compare
with NWBO in 2 years.


Anyway life is busy so Ima let you and others have last word here.

I dont see where you are getting these numbers. Talking about DCVax Prostate, which seems to have been
scrapped a while back to focus on -L and Direct seem logical to me and not a "Red Flag". I dont mind
negative facts, just like to see where or what data is being taken from to see if it really is factual, or just an
opinion. Its starting to sound like its your opinion.

I truly doubt she meant $10 - $15 million for the entire Phase III, I am betting she meant per quarter. No
phase III would cost only $10 - $15 million. Moreover, this was back in 2010, well prior to the increased trial
size, as well, this was before it was spread into Europe, and Canada as well as the US. So that could easily
have increased the quarterly costs to ~ $20 -$30M. The average out of pocket costs for a phase III clinical
trial is > $100 Million (http://bit.ly/1WrNMjv). And this being a cancer drug in a trial in Europe and North
America, I am sure it is much more. Moreover, the DCVax Direct Phase I trial was also included in these
costs. So to say it was only going to cost $15 Million is completely taken out of context. It was meant for a
quarterly cost. And in that sense, a prostate ph 3 would have been close to $200 - $300 Million when all said
and done. If not more. This is the average cost, cancer type drugs that have price personalized manufacturing
costs could even be more than that!

What I find most disappointing about the Prostate program is; they used it as a carrot in every presentation
stating that they were looking for and in discussions with possible partners up until the time it just disappeared
from all presentations never to be discussed again. That is the main problem with this company and what
makes people question everything, it's purposely hidden from investors.

Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it; NWBO has only completed a small Phase I
study, bypassing Phase III. This won't allow them to make the changes they may have needed to from Phase
II data.

Dr. Bosch did refer to TNF-a in his presentation on Direct at ASCO. When discussing Slide 13, he said...


"This is a different example. This is a patient where there truly were no CD3 cells and no cytokines. Here
we’re not looking at looking at CD4 versus CD8. Here we’re looking at functional markers of the T-cells,
interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor. And here you see at week 8 from no T-cells infiltrating to about
40% of the total tumor tissue being taken up by T-cells so that would be almost doubling in mass of the
tumor… purely because of infiltrating T-cells that are getting to the tumor tissue.


And again, it’s difficult to see, and I do apologize. But we did RNA scope… this was done by people at
PhenoPath, a contract lab that we use in Seattle… and what you can see, if you’re close up, there’s little dots
in these cells, little dark dots… RNA scope works different from immunochemistry, you get a different type of
signal… but the background in the day 0 is completely blank, and then you see these dots appearing, and
they co-localize with the T-cells demonstrating that the T-cells have infiltrated the tumor are functionally
active. They produce cytokines that in and of themselves further enhance the immune response and that
have anti-tumor effects… namely tumor necrosis alpha."

Sentiment,


Actually you're right, I was wrong in stating they did not conduct pre vs post biopsies. The AACR poster also
shows this.


I'm still not too impressed though just because I would expect that to happen. The invasion of living cell DC
vaccine into what the human organism is for the most part considering part of it's normal, healthy tissue (the
tumor), causes a cytokine storm that signals t-cells there to locate and destroy any pathogens. The problem is
there really isn't any subsequent shrinkage and so the t-cells don't seem to be doing much.


Programmed cell death results in apoptosis, not necrosis. Apoptosis results in shrinkage. When t-cells
recognize tumor those cells are neatly broken down by CTLs and macrophages clear away the debris. What
you're seeing in Direct (sometimes) is a natural immune repsonse to an invader (the DC vaccine). This may

or may not result in necrosis, which incidentally has been linked to the exacerbation of the spread of cancer.
The inflammation response is not linked with clincal benefit. Shrinkage via apoptosis is. That's what happens
when, for instance, checkpoint inhibitors work. They just take the breaks of t-cells who then disseminate the
cancer cells. There may be some inflammation but not much, and the end result in those who respond is
significant shrinkage in ALL target lesions. That's all done by the host's t-cells. Clinical benefit (OS extension)
is the result.


Can you mix the two? Maybe. Might improve responses, I'm not sure. CI are being used in many combo
therapies though now, and no one seems interested in trying one with Direct. Of course NWBO could buy
their own Opdivo or Keytruda and give it a go. They don't seem to mind spending money. Maybe you guys
could start a petition and convince Woodford to buy the CI for a future trial.

Steve,


ICT-107 Phase III trial is expected to cost $60M for ~587 patients. ICT-107's claim to fame is that it is an
extremely inexpensive to manufacture as related to DCVax. I have provided numerous links stating that
Oncology Phase 3 Trials have an AVERAGE cost of $75 - $100 million. This is average cost. Now, I am not
sure where you get $400M, but just a fast calculation and I am sure it is not accurate, but Cognate owns ~ 20
million shares, and they received these usually as warrants and at a price of $~4.00 even if the share price at
the time (and that was only recently) was ~$10 - $12. That turns out to be ~$80 Million. However, those are
share/warrants, and can not be sold until probably 2017 as they have stipulations on them. If the trial fails
they are worthless. Yes, they have received some cash payments as well, but nothing compared to what they
have received in shares. Moreover, the warrants they received must be converted into shares as well, and
they have had to exercise that as well, meaning they have had to pay to keep those warrants as shares.


Now, you are right, NWBO's relationship with Cognate is not a normal one, and maybe Powers has had this
huge illegal money making scheme to funnel money through Cognate, however, it seems that if the house of
cards fell, which it would have to at some point, she would be going to jail, and investor Neil Woodford would
lose a lot of money. Unless that happens, it is difficult to state that that is the case. I agree its good to do due
dilligence and atleast ask the question, and I appreciate critical thinking and people that ask the question.
However, on the other hand, it also looks like NWBO has put themselves in place to become a major
cancer/biotech player if the phase III results are good. And this might also be why they have spent alot of
money, both on the trials, and with Cognate.


Lets look at whats happened:


- Cognate is positioning themselves in Europe, in Cambridge, purchasing land there and moving on building
there. It is stated in numerous Cambridge promotional packages and it is near the Biotech sector in
Cambridge.  
- NWBO has extended the DCVax-L trial into Europe, Canada and all over the US, increasing the trial size to
358 patients. They have used Fraunhofer and King's College as European Manufacturing sites, though I have
read some sites that state vaccines have been sent back to Cognate in the US from Europe.

- The have achieved institutional investors with Woodford and now, numerous other Mutual funds. 
- They have completed informational arm trials (55 patients) for DCVax-L.  
- They have completed and are now pushing forward on Phase II for DCVax Direct trials.


This all requires substantial costs, and they have done this without Big Pharma. I would even state that if
successful, they have positioned themselves to not need Big Pharma's help, and could even become a major
player, I would say a disruptive innovation in the Pharmaceutical industry. Any other Immunotherapy company
would need to partner with a company to commercialize, NWBO has positioned themselves to not need to.
And I believe that is one of the reasons they have spent much more cash/shares etc...


However, I will check on the spending, but for 2013, they spent nothing on Cognate, it was only in 2014 that
they back paid for manufacturing services, ~ $24 million from the fillings.

Bohsie,


Who ever said ICT-107 is "extremely inexpensive to manufacture compared to DCVax"? The process is
actually very similar. If anything I could make the case that ICT-107 should be the more expensive of the two.


-leukapheresis to acquire PBMC (both) 
-differentiate into immature moDC using IL-4+GM-CSF (both) 
-save tumor sample and have stored (DCVax) 
-supply six synthetic antigens to load DC with (ICT-107) 
-uses scissors or scalpel to mince up tumor tissue, put into solution, then send resultant slurry through
centrifuge to remove largest particles (DCVax). Load DC  
-load DC with synthetic antigen mix, 6 per DC (about 30million antigens-ICT-107) 
-provide and add maturation element to mix after sufficient load time (ICT-107) 
-cryopreserve and then thaw and administer to patient when needed (both)


I know the cost to store tumor is something like $2k-$3k, otherwise it's just a product of sugary they. Or ally
throw away, so not a lot of cost there. What is the cost for the antigens in ICT-107? What is the cost of the
maturational element? More than $3k per patient?


If anything they are the same or ICT-107 is more expensive to manufacture.


And as I keep saying your $100mm for a P3 is irrelevant. A 5,000 patient P3 and a 300 patient P3 will very
differently priced. What matters is per patient cost. The average two years ago was $50k per patient. The high
end was $75k. That would be for therapies that will ultimately be sold for well over $150k. DCVax P3 is prob

closer to the $50k. If we say $70K, the initial 240 patient trial should have been around $15mm. The 300
patient "so far" trial combined with the 40 patient DCVax Direct trial should be around $24mm. So far just in
R&D during this P3 they have spent $261mm. Ten times what you would expect.


IMUC's almost 600 patient P3 is almost twice the size of the DCVax L P3, and what's more they may have to
make 1,000 or more vaccines to even get those 600 randomized (in the P2 they made 278 randomized 124
patients).


You honestly can't see the issue here? Please scroll above and read through my post again where I carefully
outline all of the expenses paid to Cognate overwhelmingly in cash and also shares. Even though you stated:


"So Cognate being provided some cash, and alot of shares and warrants"

You seem to be getting back in at a very interesting time with regard to the potential for near term binary type
news according to this article. Shorts that are covered with options or warrants actually want the price to spike
whether from those who are uncovered or from longs and traders buying in. This strategy seeks volatility for
maximum assured gains either up or down and then with the trading swings as the price finds a more stabil
trend lines. More can be gained on the upside if there is any positive surprise beyond what the expected
range of efficacy might be. As far as Direct, you might want to ask some of the case study patients already
reported on if they are still swimming after a grapefruit sized tumor is no longer interfering with breathing or
what is new at Nat Geo instead of at the pearly gates. If that is the kind of progressive disease that Direct
causes then there will be plenty of cancer pstients that want Direct.(:j)

Sorry, I meant, no warrants/shares were paid out in 2013 to Cognate, shares/warrants were back paid in
2014.


If you look on Seeking Alpha, and numerous websites, it talks about ICT-107 lowered manufacturing costs. P
Man prides himself on the fact that ICT-107 is considerably less to manufacture than DCVax-L.


http://bit.ly/1Q9U5mE


Moreover, there are considerably more costs involved than just the manufacturing. Developing SOPs are very
costly, particularly developing different ones for European Standards, etc.... I will go into more detail on the
total amounts paid out to Cognate, but the fact that Cognate differed manufacturing payments for a year has
additional costs on its own. Meaning Cognate needs to cover those costs for over a year. So $12M in 2013 for
manufacturing as well as SOP development, commercialization of the DCVax-L vaccine. Commercialization of
a product has huge costs in itself. Phase III trials need to prove that the manufacturing process is CGMP, as
well as showing that a system is in place that shows the manufacturing process of a personalized vaccine is
repeatable, and in a sense standardized. More over, Cognate seems to be positioned to move straight into
commercialized manufacturing of the vaccine, as well as already purchased land in Cambridge to build a
European Manufacturing Facility there. Moreover Cognate developed a dedicated manufacturing process for
the DCVax-L (and Direct) vaccines that do not provide manufacturing for other outside customers (quote from
10-K:


"In addition to the rigorous regulatory requirements, our DCVax programs involve a particularly challenging
operational and business requirement: our programs require a large amount of capacity in these specialized
manufacturing facilities, and require that the large capacity be dedicated exclusively to our programs. ")


It sounds that Cognate is setup to move straight into full scale manufacturing if approval occurs, and for any
commercialization process, no matter what industry, there are fixed costs. Cognate currently has ability for
product of several thousand vaccines per year, which provides them with the ability to treat immediately along
with room for scale up. If IMUC received accelerated approval tomorrow, there is no way they would have a
fully commercialized manufacturing capability in any near term, or even the ability to treat thousands of
patients. They would need to partner with a Big Pharma, and/or need substantial amounts of money to build a
manufacturing process/facility.


LET ME BE VERY SPECIFIC; There is a huge difference between contracting out vaccine manufacturing,
and the manufacturing cost of an in-house manufacturing process. Contracting out manufacturing costs 2 - 3
times more. Moreover, if Cognate is providing a dedicated manufacturing process in their facility with SOPs
and that is CGMP certified for DCVax-L, there is substantial costs to that not even including the manufacturing
of the trial vaccines themselves. So to try and crunch manufacturing numbers to show that the cost has been
too great means nothing.

Bohsie, Contributor
Steve,


Put it this way, as a manufacturing engineer, I know that the numbers you provide are no where near what I
would use as a budget if I were to try and commercialize some process. There is much more involved than
trying to comparing someone's quote for manufacturing costs for a completely different product, and to try and
apply it to the costs provided to Cognate, when I feel that Cognate is much more involved than just
manufacturing the phase III patient vaccines. Cognate seems to be partnered with NWBO closely, and cashes
greatly if NWBO succeeds. If you read the 2014 10-K, it talks about additional costs then just manufacturing.
Since each patients tumor needs to be frozen and transported to Memphis, I am sure that the CGMP process
starts not when it arrives in Memphis, but as soon as it is removed from the brain. This means SOPs for the
hospital staff that do the tumor removal operation, place the tumor into a cryogenic freezer to be transported
to Memphis, no matter if its Europe, Seattle, or a hospital in Memphis itself.


If I believe correctly, the ICT-107 does not use the tumor, but a blood draw I believe, and so it isnt as involved
as sending live tumor tissue. Blood is transported daily, from every city, all over the world, tumors are not. Two
different beasts.

And then again Steve, because I do think you are a critical thinker. If, and thats if your math is incorrect, and
NWBO and DCVax-L is actually successful, wouldnt that be worth losing $5,000 over? I mean really. That is
my whole point with NWBO. Its not that I am positive that is is going to work, I dont know that, no one does.
And Powers could be playing everyone and going to sleep on hoards of money from Cognate every night,
BUT, if that isnt the case, the potential upside is huge. The downside. I lose that $5000 (or whatever I am
willing to invest, which is more than that), but it was worth the risk.

Hey Doc, well there are always a few patients even with inoperable stage IV disease that have low grade non
aggressive tumors. Christine Karr comes to mind.


Direct didn't seem to help many of the other pancreatic cancer patients, and the median overall survival of
that indication in the trial was only 3.9 months (the INT panc is actually a separate indication with much better
prognosis). And of all indications the mOS is just 16 months. Not awesome considering a number of patients
were ECOG 0 and stage III.

Doc logic
Steven,


I read up on that study a little bit and IL-2 shows promise. I like where Direct is sitting right now better
because of what I think they discovered about how to activate DCs. After reading the abstract today, I agree
with Flipper about what it means. There are subsets of DCs that function differently than the more common
ones. I believe that NWBO has the ability to now select for these DCs. They have been playing with ideal
maturation stage and environment, including biologic and non biologic activation, for quite a while now and
the payoff appears to be from a form of what was called method B previously. The abstract appears to point to
this.


I know your reservations about method B patients but the abstract points to a critical factor being discovered
that allows method B to act very quickly to overcome tumor and macrophage interference with immune
function and this appears to be clinically measurable apart from OS based on observations shared by Dr.
Bosch at his last presentation. This is exactly what my due diligence has led me to believe would happen.
That TNF alpha you talked about is exactly what these DCs drop off when they are injected into the tumor.
That brings the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to the tumor and shows that it mobilizes those that are already there
to begin with.


By the way, do you think this article was directed more towards the remaining retail holders or the institutional
holders that own the majority of what is left of the float after Linda and Neil? Best wishes.

Steven Giardino, Contributor
Hey Doc,


Okay so more hope placed on P2 leg or an actual phase 2 study ;)


Do you ever get the feeling the ball keeps getting kicked down the field but the end zone is always out of
view?


I think the problem with this idea is that it's too patient-specific. Unless you are now advocating donor DC. I
read a patent a while back where they were able to clone copies of a certain DC that expressed desirable
antigens. So maybe you can find the ideal DC that will secrete lots of IL-8. But it's one thing to identify a
subset and another to replicate everything that occurred in that subset.


I guess we'll see but this is getting very hypothetical at this point.


I always take issue with basically ANY corollary. I find most of them breakdown when the matter is complex,
and cellular biology, much of which is still not understood, def falls under that category. Then correlation
REALLY does not imply causation. For example, those patients with DCs that secrete lots of IL-8--is it the DC
that is helping improve survival or is it just that healthier patients tend to have healthier cells with improved
functioning (true) and so their DC secrete more and diverse cytokines? If so the correlation is too wrapped up
in the performance status of the patient. And so of course they do better.

DC therapies can make decent adjuvants but by themselves are not that strong. Especially--ESPECIALLY
when tumor burden is high.


I don't think SITC will prove pps moving worthy. But, I'm in until summer-fall 2016 with a small position so I

I def think phaseV were seeking to influence retail holders. The only insty is Woodford and a little bit of

You are wrong if you think Woodford is the only institution here. Yes, a lot of retail see "Credit Suisse,
Blackrock, Vanguard" not knowing those are ETFs and the like. But there are a lot of newer actual institutions
invested here now (mostly arriving this year). Don't discount that there are even some retirement plans too. It
is extremely difficult to get an investment like this past the plan administrator due to fiduciary responsibility. I
am shocked about that actually, they are going out on a real limb there for some reason. I can't comment on
the science but this much I am sure of. See, I know my limitations...


You go to extreme lengths to try to outwit Bohsie and always end it by saying he doesn't know what he's
talking about. Isn't it possible that you are the one who doesn't? No, of course not! You apparently know

It would really help you to read our report, or even just a single NWBO SEC filing, to understand NWBO's UK
facility purchase situation better. You would have to have avoided all NWBO company materials altogether to
have missed this information.

Cognate did not purchase the UK facility. The land was purchased by a recently incorporated entity - Aracaris
Capital Limited (Aracaris is a type of toucan), with NWBO money.


The purchase transaction was completed in two phases: on August 19, 2014, 65,000 sq ft of existing building
and 25 acres of land were purchased for $20.8 million and on December 9, 2014 additional 12 acres of land
and certain buildings were purchased for $7.9 million (NWBO capitalized additional costs to get to the current
book value of approx. $40 million). No explanation was given as to why NWBO would need 25 acres of land.


Aracaris Capital Limited also purchased 37 acres of land in the area surrounding the existing building – 25
acres at first and then another 12 acres. Our research found that the area contains arable land, woodland,
pasture and fishing lake. Aracaris Capital Limited also bought “Spicer’s Youth Centre” and “Spicer’s Sport
Ground” which is the local cricket ground.


Again, the connection between fishing, cricket and DcVax is not clear.

that is trying to help cancer patients... Even if you are right and they are scooping my money in some shady
way. I choose to try to help them. I just can't comprehend spending my time trying to derail something like that
and especially pretending like you have no agenda to do it! It is asinine but you can't see that because of your
narcissism. One day it will just hit you when you grow up a little. I get it, but I am not going to sit idly by while

I'll post a list of the institutions tomorrow when I am back on my bloomberg, those that are not ETFs.

Bohsie, Contributor
You are correct. NWBO purchased it. My bad. However, it is being marketed in the UK as Cognate's new
European facility. Also, that means that Cognate wouldn't get the land if NWBO folded. It would go to
bankruptcy filings.

TC,


Funny, guy! So I guess when someone is well read and confidently states his opinion and it aligns with yours
he's awesome and a benefit to society, but when he is well read and confidently states his opinion and it
DISAGREES with yours he's a narcissist. Got it, thanks.


As for the rest, you have a problem with me and what I write because you have MONEY invested here (and
way too much of your NPV per your own admission). You have this scenario all worked out where I come on
these message boards and white shit to try and push NWBO's price down, a company that's not in this for
money (oh no) but are just trying to CURE CANCER goddammit! Do you also still hunt for colored eggs on
Easter?


Try this scenario: how about a company licenses a therapy on the cheap that no one else wants to develop
because of significant drawbacks, portrays single arm data to the world that they say comes from patients
treated with the therapy, even though that's not true, and then convinces hundreds of patients to enter their
trial testing the therapy when they could have entered other trials with therapies that are almost certainly
more effective? Meanwhile the CEO has a manufacturing outfit that she uses to overcharge shareholders of
her other company for the ineffectual vaccine. You think because that company is technically treating cancer
patients that they are doing so altruistically? And that anyone who sees legitimate issues with the above
should STFU?


Of course not. Only if you have too much money tied up in that company, that is.


Sir, YOU are the narcissist.


05 Nov 2015, 07:58 PM

Probably your greatest reply.....ever. This is exactly what my issues is, if anyone says anything negative about
the company they are a lying short fudster working for the hedge funds and big pharma. On the other the
wildest unsubstantiated speculative BS is accepted with open arms as long as it's something positive NWBO!


I am long NWBO whether anybody believes me or not (cut my position in half), and with the abundance of red
flags I'm ignoring, I'm almost sure this will bite me in a** in the long run. I choose however to look at all
aspects of the company,good and bad. Unfortunately as time moves forward the good is becoming harder to
find. I have never been invested in a company that is so unaccountable to it's shareholders and so covert in
the actions.

Let's see where all these altruistic posters go if the trial fails, you know, the ones that are here to cure Cancer.
Let's see if any of them feel accountable for convincing investors to put their retirement savings into NWBO or
convincing patients to enter a trial with the ultimate price being their life if it doesn't work.

Phase Five Research,


The connection between fishing, cricket and DCVax seems obvious. Take the treatment and get back to the
things you love to do.


09 Nov 2015, 10:54 AM


Doc logic
Steven,


One other reason you might be getting in here is because the HE program seems to be continuing to enroll
patients based on a supposed response from the PEI to a query from a commentor on ihub. If this is true then
all interested parties regarding treatment with DCVax-L in Germany are now being referred to the government
sponsored HE program for enrollment there. Revenue could be recorded soon by NWBO once the agreement
is finalized. There is also the possibility that this agreement is already done and this is at least part of the
reason for the submission of data in September which may have indicated that the number of patients already
initially screened would be enough for the trial to be fully enrolled and therefore allow all potential candidates
to now move directly into HE.


Since NWBO can not advertise their product then all this would need to be done on the down low. This is
especially true because of the ongoing status of the Phase lll trial. Thus the "radio silence". Remember,
Cognate needed to receive approval to have vaccines made here in the states to ship back to Germany.
Cognate Germany supposedly had enough capacity for their trial so what does the evidence imply about
demand for this treatment, Cognate's ramp up and possible reporting of revenue by NWBO soon? I think this
is why you are back in and why there has been so much change in institutional interest more recently. You
hinted at this with the catalysts you mentioned but did not come right out and say that HE enrollment is
ongoing. Please illucidate this point if you have additional information. Best wishes.

longimgn,


Regina is RKmatters who has a history with yahoo market pulse and the ihub message board. She
disappeared along with Steven for a while from NWBO commentary. Much of what is in this Phase Five article
comes from bits and pieces of their shared due diligence and that of others over on ihub.  
Cognate has stem cell research going on that looks interesting and they will be set up in Sawston, England
along with NWBO. This means that NWBO may not be the only source of technology Linda is involved with
that big pharma might be either concerned about or interested in.


The relationship between Cognate and NWBO is a sore spot with many retail investors because we are
unable to vet the relstionship as well as big investors and this is why this relationship and inevitable delays
that face small cash strapped companies are targeted to shake retail investors out while institutions are
buying in. Best wishes.

Steven, though you say DVAX L is " primitive" pretty sure we are going to see that it has tremendous benefits
for the Glioblastoma patients whose tumors are classified as mesanchymal. Doctors say they comprise 50-
75% of all Glio tumors. Let's just say 60%. I base this information on studies from UCLA and from IMUC's
Phase 2. For these people the vaccine can be a game changer and will actually give each mesenchymal
person receiving it the possibility of being cured. Even if all else fails this vaccine for these people has got to
be worth something to investors and then who knows what tomorrow will bring as other cancers are targeted.
Just as important also is the fact that, unlike other therapies out there now, for DVAX L, there is barely a side
effect.

I just read Woodford's letter to the NWBO BOD (scroll to the bottom of the amended SC 13D/A dated 24 NOV
2015 available on EDGAR or through the NWBO web site) regarding recent allegations of impropriety at
NWBO. It is excellent reading and leaves little room for interpretation. He states that he was not aware of
some of the recent allegations when he made the last investment, so my earlier faith in NWBO based on
Woodford's investment was misplaced. See posts above.


In his letter Woodford proposes (demands really) that the NWBO BOD "appoint an independent non-
executive director to the Board" and "convene a special committee composed only of conflict-free non-
executive directors and engage external counsel who have not previously provided legal services to the
Company."


Woodford nominated Elliott Leary to fill the Board position and noted "We believe the candidate’s skills are
especially suited to the current situation of the Company in relation to the various allegations of financial
improprieties and regulatory failure that have been published by at least one anonymous source. We would
like to note that we only became aware of certain of these allegations after the completion of our recent
investment in the Company comprising US $30 million in new equity. We believe that best practices for
companies addressing allegations of this nature require the Board to convene a special committee composed
only of conflict-free non-executive directors and engaging external counsel who have not previously provided
legal services to the Company."


So, Woodford is concerned about allegations of impropriety and has proposed a path to clear up the issue. I
support this effort and will be writing to the Board stating my support. The Board has an obligation to protect

shareholder's interest - all shareholders. And a demonstration of broad shareholder concern will be interesting
to the SEC should the issue rise to that level.


I recommend all shareholders do the same as resolving the allegations is critical to any significant new
investment in NWBO. By amending the very public SEC filing to include his letter, Woodford guaranteed no
fund will invest a penny until the allegations are resolved. In moving to protect his investment, Woodford has
done us all a huge favor.


28 Nov 2015, 05:52 AM


Doc logic
Volumelogic,


The more I think about Mr. Woodford's response mentioned by you above the more I think about my initial
response which was like yours here and my response now. My response now is that I believe he intended his
response to be empathetic towards his investors while at the same time executing a planned response. Why
do I say this? The reason is simple, they were expecting another attack. His response is with regard to the
"allegations" and not the actual situation. He was obviously aware of the situation he just doesn't say that.


Do you recall in the movie "Gladiator" the advice given to the treacherous new Caesar by the senator that
was his ally? He told him to look vulnerable so that his enemies would expose themselves. Do you think Mr.
Woodford and Linda saw that movie? (:j)

GBM runs it's course in an average of 15mos. NWBO's testing started 1998. Over that time they have gone out of
their way to perform outside the governance of the FDA, ostensibly to gain quicker results. 
I used to be a shareholder of both IMUC and NWBO but quickly soured on NWBO b/c of there incomprehensible PII
trial design and Ms. Powers' obvious conflicts of interest, (My god, where is the SEC!).  
I sold IMUC after their PII miss. It seems that they could've cherry-picked their PI subjects (or just got lucky). It should
be pointed out that IMUC and NWBO are roughly at the same stage of testing but IMUC started almost ten years later
and has fully complied and cooperated with the FDA. Considering the disappointing state of stem cell research in
general and the continually evolving financial circus here , I don't see how anyone could ignore this forest of red

Without Toucan funding Cognate, and Cognate providing reliable manufacturing services on a non-cash basis,
Northwest would not exist today. The arrangement has worked wonderfully for shareholders who should thank Toucan
and Cognate for carrying the company through this phase -- and, Cognate has never been been given below market
warrants. They may appear to be a bargain when they get exercised, but they were market or above when granted. 
As for Israel, it would be great news if patients are able to receive treatment there and, again, shareholders should be
thanking Linda for finding ways to get things done. 
Finally, readers need be aware that this article cherry picks statements without context from SEC filings, often quite

L - Phase III is well under way with over 300 out of 348 patients enrolled, in four countries, with a very well
known investor (and named may I say, as opposed to the masked Phase V pseudo-analysts). UCLA and MD
Anderson in the U.S. Frauhofer in Germany, etc., are top notch and participate in the trials. I'll let the trial
results show the benefit for Cancer patients. No need to argue about it, the FDA will decide. As for the market
potential? Well, Steven Giardino established a market cap baseline for an approval of just L a while back at

From SoS: Phase V claims that the "science behind DCVax-L and DCVax Direct is flawed and there is no chance that
the products will be effective. I would remind people that this technology is based on the role of the dendritic cell in
activating the active and innate immune system. This won their discoverers the Nobel Prize in 2011. Secondly, there
has already been one product approved that uses dendritic cell vaccine technology. That was Provenge which was
approved on the basis of a 4.5 month improvement in median overall survival in metastatic colon cancer (4.5 months
is considered by key opinion leaders to be a significant advance). To me, this suggests that dendritic cell cancer
vaccines like DCVax-L and DCVax Direct are based on solid science. I for one feel that cancer vaccines could be a
major advance in the treatment of cancer and dendritic cell cancer vaccines are an extremely logical approach."


29 Oct 2015, 03:23 PM


Phase Five Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  There are literally eons of difference between DcVax and the 2011 Nobel Prize, as well
Dendreon's Provenge (also addressed in our report)


1. The 2011 Nobel Prize was given to scientists who had made a discovery of dendritic cells and particularly
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) present on dendritic cells. Comparing this discovery to DcVax is a little like saying
that a Nobel Prize for DNA discovery is proof that gene therapies work, or that Newton's experiments make
Tesla a good investment.


2. Dendreon's Provenge did use dendritic cells, directly isolated from the patients in their mature state.
Conversely, NWBO uses DC precursors (baby DCs, if you like), and matures them outside the body. This has
never yet been proven effective in clinical studies. Secondly, the technology of "priming" the DCs against the
tumor was vastly different with Provenge- the company actually fused tumor proteins to certain molecules
they knew penetrated the DC membrane. NWBO takes "DCs" they matured in vitro and randomly bombards
them with bits of tumor they have cut up, hoping that something will stick/penetrate the cell membrane. There
is less than nothing in common between Provenge and DcVax. Thirdly, Dendreon went bankrupt.

There maybe short term rally here and there, but in the end this company is just a pile of papers.

Another excellent day - NWBO stable despite a down day for the S&P, a down day for biotechs, a down day
for many of the cancer immuno peers, and most importantly, just one day after the above attempt at taking
down the company is published on a hugely read website, and reminders of its publication are twittered a
dozen times the following day by its makers. Longs may now feel better that the fate of the company rests on
the formal results of DCVAX, not on slanderous manipulation. I don't pretend that DCVAX success is a given,
but I certainly like knowing that the company can get to the trial finish line without interference by market
leeches.

The price action is following step by step with the markets and IBB plus 12.5 shorts who hired this company to write
this propaganda piece that has all kind of misguiding statements about the science and the BOD.

one of the main things that stood out in the BS article was the fact that Woodford was not mentioned once, when in
fact 3 separate times he bought shares above what market price was each time. there was NO dilution from the first
deal he made on. Woodford I am sure has been privy to many things concerning NWBO add that is why he has over
28% stake in NWBO. I trust him and his qualifications 
over any Seeking Alpha article. Has anyone checked out phase 5 website? no contact number, no name to see what
this person's qualifications are. u have to send an email to get a response and there is only like 2 articles on the
whole site that both have to do with shorting. I truly feel that a decision is coming up and the shorts are doing
everything in their power to destroy this company and stock before it destroys them. I believe in the science, I first
read about them on the UCLA website where they are using it in trials and they state on their site that they believe it's
on the pathway to fda approval. Germany, England, Canada.

29 Oct 2015, 08:14 PM


synergistic_serendipity
his qualifications are he, freddpitts and phaseV are either one and the same, or working in the same office,
or.....


Interesting how those three jumped on all the early commentators and are pretty much the only three that
blindly do so. There are others, but they at least sound somewhat logical and honest. I have no issue with
argumentation and debate. It is the blind "sell, the sky is falling" and "these are nothing but liars and cheats!"
single line responses that are so blatant that just make me laugh with their adolescent behavior.


yep, freedom of speech is the surest form of banditry. Of course, the fact that shorts and hedge funds play
games with potentially life saving drug development is extremely sad and shameless. Of course, it is the
easiest game in town given the emotional factors at play with potential medical discoveries.


Well, in the end, we all have to answer to someone, if it is only ourselves when we look in the mirror each
morning.


Long a reasonable amount of shares. Following Woodford's lead and the other institutions.

Yet again all the NWBO fans are having a hard time actually refuting what was said in the Phase Five report.
Why don't you be the first? I'll expect a 60+ page PDF edited with your brilliant commentary on every sketchy
thing Linda Powers has done that Phase Five pointed out.


"The share price collapsed. Must be the shorts!" Or maybe the fact that NWBO tried to hide the partial clinical
hold and still hasn't cleared up the reason for it and it's been over 2 and a half months. Go find the last 20
clinical holds and tell me how many were from something positive. Let me save you some time. The answer is
ZERO. At best it's something benign like they screwed up some paperwork. But why has the compassionate
use program been halted too?

Let me guess, it's because they're going for AA? Not a chance in hell with enrollment still 40+ people short
because the company themselves increased the trial size from 312 to 348 a year ago. FDA will want it fully
enrolled.

out of curiosity you say you have no position in nwbo anymore. what are your qualifications to tell me to get my

No qualification is needed here at SA. There are good folks here trying to help others. Of course, there are
also questionable characters around here. Use your search and judgment to find out the truth. Don't get
emotional when you trade stocks. Don't fall in love with them.

Matt_PK
There is some good analysis in this article. Some errors to be sure, but I won't quibble about the fine points.


What should concern shareholders is whether the allegedly independent directors are, in fact, independent.
Sarbanes-Oxley and the NASDAQ market rules are strict about the amount of compensation a director can receive in
addition to the published amount for board service. When last I looked the limit was $60K per year in additional
compensation over and above normal director fees before the director lost the ability to be considered independent for
the following three years.


If everything stated above is true, then Mr. Malik fails the independence test, big time, and, by extension, so does the
overall board and the Audit and Compensation Committees on which he serves. That means the company did not,
and does not, qualify for continued listing on NASDAQ, and is not in compliance with SARBOX. If NASDAQ chooses
to take enforcement action the company could possibly be suspended or delisted, and that will kill the ability of the
company to raise money; the start of the death spiral for any biotech. The OTC is an ugly place to raise funding.


Some of the questions poised above about how an entity can be unrelated and independent in light of the
circumstances can possibly be justified by a very generous reading of the SEC regulations. However, if the attribution
rules are applied the way most enforcement officers would apply them, then there is going to be trouble in paradise. I
would not want to have my signature on the SOX compliance certifications for the last few years.

Shame on you Seeking Alpha for allowing a Short Attack once again! What you are doing is immoral and illegal that is
why you have gone to such great lengths to hide the author of this piece. Come on Government stop this BS of Short
attacks and illegal short selling-It is ruining companies and the US. Yes, the rich get richer and the middle class gets
the shaft once again. This just proves Seeking Alpha is not a website to be trusted for real research!


30 Oct 2015, 02:11 PM


Modis, Contributor
The author points out the plausible role of the Israel cancer in disbursing dcvax treatments. The companies website,
language etc strongly confirm that this is going on. On that, I'm with you.


So please explain why Woodford has invested such large sums of money? What data could he have seen that
convinced a professional, even celebrated British investor to pour hundreds of millions into nwbo?


like you, I'm also angry at the lack of placebo controlled data. But shorting the technology that won the 2011 Nobel
prize? risky. and consider this: what if nwbo truly was a scam someday in the past, and they needed to act the part. If
you pretend to be a pilot long enough, flying aircraft everyday, someday your skills will be that of a pilot. The Science
behind dendritic cells is very strong. Their patents are good. What if they suddenly found themselves with a working
therapy? The last bit is just humorous speculation, but you get the point.


01 Nov 2015, 01:11 AM


Phase Five Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1. Investors do make mistakes. Even specialized biotech funds. The majority of recently
failed biotechs had large institutional ownership, with way larger positions than Woodford's. Look at any
crashed biotech of the last year and you will find that many were 80%+ owned by institutional investors.
Moreover, for a 1bln+ fund, $30mln is a position small enough that it wouldn't warrant such extensive due
diligence, perhaps even just consist of meetings with management. In fact, such low interest from investors
and no interest from pharma partners could attest to the very fact that investors are doing their due diligence
on NWBO.


2. The technology did not "win the 2011 Nobel Prize" - please see our earlier post. That is an incredibly
general statement, as the prize was won for the discovery of dendritic cells. There are hundreds of
technologies now using DCs, from allergy patches to non-cancer vaccines. Some work and some don't.


4. NWBO has no patents. It has sold them off - please see our report. The one filed in 2013 is *not relevant*
to DcVax.


5. DcVax was developed in the 90's when DC work was in very early stages. The technology has not changed
in 20 years, while more and more basic knowledge has been unravelled in this sphere, and other DC
companies have had the time to rise and fall. There is probably a reason why no other company is developing
a DC+tumor lysate technology, and hasn't done so in 20 years. If a technology is lucrative, companies rush to
the gold mine - just look at the CAR-T sphere. If a technology has not worked since 1996, it is quite unlikely to
suddenly start working in 2016.

I think you are doing a public service by telling what you know about the company. You may have benefited

01 Nov 2015, 06:58 PM


Lio Capital
I rarely comment on SA articles, but this time I would like to hear your thoughts about some of my reflections. 
Since January, this stock soared by more than 100% ($12 in July) and then crashed 60% to its current $4.9 price. To
me, it looked like an opportunity to buy this stock cheaply. I currently don't have any position in this company, because
I think it is very risky.


Since I have no knowledge in immunotherapy or cancer treatment, I have to put my trust in the company's
announcements and the opinion of more knowledgeable people. So I read the company's publications as well as
articles from the likes of SmithOnStocks, Adam Fuerstein, Ryan Pawell and Phase V. 
To make a long story short, my conclusion was that the DCVax is highly controversial and that the chance that it will
receive some kind of recognition from the FDA is 50-50 at most. On the one hand, the company released some data
that seems very positive and got the support of some people like Smith. On the other hand, there are people who
criticize the results for many reasons such as: the trials weren't conducted according to FDA's regulations, patients
were cherry-picked, company's publications are not consistent, additional trials pop up from mid-air and many more.


I may not understand the first thing about cancer treatment, but I do know a thing or two about business. For me, in
this regard there is no dispute about what's going on. Looking at the financing and related-parties transaction, I got a
clear view on how NWBO is either being exploited or poorly managed by its management and especially its CEO and
President. Since Linda has much experience in financing and managing, I don't think she's just making mistakes.
There are many claims in this article that were not addressed by any of NWBO's supporters here and I think should
be: 
1. Director Navid – why did the company published his article as if it was unbiased research when he was actually
receiving payments in the form of shares and warrants? How come he is considered "independent director" when he
is clearly not? This is a serious violation of SEC regulations and investors' trust. NWBO was caught in a lie here. 
2. Related parties – related parties (all of the Toucan companies and Cognate) received $100 million more than they
should have because the transaction were above fair value. There's no excuse for that.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618336-northwest-biotherapeutics-house-cards-ready-collapse 164/183


3. R&D expenses and Cognate – $300 million in R&D expenses since 2005 out of which $140 million are due to
Cognate. This is a lot of money! And if the return is a controversial trial results this makes me wonder if the money
was spent wisely. I could not understand the reason for such extraordinary amount. The company says that its R&D
expenses increased in recent years due to increased number of clinical trial sites and DCVax-L patients recruiting
across the US and the initiation of the trial in Europe. In 2014, for example, the company spent $86 million in R&D out
of which $38 million were related to Cognate. This means that the $38 million included the manufacturing of DCVax
and other services by Cognate such as storage, clinical support and commercialization support. So, what were the
other $48 million for? And on top of that, in 2014 the company had $17 million in SG&A. 
4. Recent purchase of UK facility – I checked if the information in the article was accurate and it is, according to the
planning application in the "South Cambridgeshire" district council. So the question is, why did NWBO purchase so
much land which, except for one building, looks pretty useless? And why did NWBO pay so much on that useless
land? Something is fishy here.


As I said, I would love to hear your thought. But please try to provide useful answers. I saw many of you write things
like "I believe Woodford did his DD" or "Linda knows that...". These comments are either wishful thinking or based on
nothing since none of us know what's going on in the company and unfortunately NWBO doesn't seem to share things
with its investors. Specifically, I would love to hear a logical explanation for the Cognate/Toucan matter and not the
"without Cognate and Toucan NWBO would not exists" – if someone locked his son in a closet in his house while
keeping him well fed, will you say "without this guy the kid would have starved to death"? And if this guy will say "hi,
this is my son, I brought him to life and grew him up", is that a reasonable excuse for this guy's behavior?

Lio,


You have very legitimate concerns as do Thyfish and others. Your comparison to a father holding his son
captive though is a little off. A better comparison would be that a ship at sea found a nearly dead starved and
thirsty sailor on a desert island and rescued him and put him to work on the ship without pay. Only if the
seaman makes if off the ship at some port and the captain doesn't pay him or his shipmates well will the
captain be held fully accountable. Not quite Mutiny On The Bounty but the frustration with leadership is duly
noted here and certainly has parallels. Best wishes.

many of the above posters for the time and effort they have made which has so deeply contributed to my novice
understanding, (or lack there-of) of what might or might not be happening in these 2 trials of DCVax......A HUGE shout
out to Steve, Doc, Larry, Bohsie, Tinsley, and others who have tried to ask questions, seek clarification, or raised
issues that seem to be sooooooo pertinent and timely.....One question I do have it someone reads this comment and
can answer it is, "Is the poster information that NWBO will present at SITC already available on line?" I am staying
tuned and staying long, but not with the certainty I once had, but that is a good thing, as nothing should be taken for
granted or at face value in the new age of Bio Technology....Looking at the agenda of SITC I am struck how much is
going on and how much there is yet to discover and uncover and test out...WOW.. I do hope that NWBO adds to the
learning curve, but I see now it is not the beginning or the end of immune enhancing treatments for
cancer....WOW....THANKS all....cheers

The SITC embargo will be lifted on 11/3/2015 on abstracts of the Vivek Subbiah et al poster,presented in
CUTTING-EDGE CLINICAL TRIALS TRACK


This TRACK if DESERVED, is recognition from PEERS of the academic and science prestige of the report,in
terms of methodology and the importance of its safety-efficacy data. 
It is unfortunate this is a poster and not an ORAL presentation.It could document how rigorous are the
standards of the present scientific program committe. 
Also this TRACK placement is INCONGRUENT with the rumor that the DCVAX technology is already ,
relatively PRIMITIVE today.

The timing of the various expected news events appears targeted to begin tomorrow. The editing with the
clinicaltrials.gov DCVax-L Phase lll site is coinciding nicely with the timing of expected AA request as per
flipper's analysis. Also look at all the Doctors names on the abstract and, of note, Linda seems to be asking
for more scrutiny since Cognate is listed as a signatory on the abstract. Go get them Dewey, Cheatum and
Howe. I'll be your lead plaintiff if you promise to subpoena Adam and Jim and they actually testify. On the
other hand, don't wait too long or I might be making money on my investment. Oops, I already am so I guess

Assuming peer review at SiTC(2015) was correct. 
1)Placement in CUTTING EDGE TRACK. 
2)The Conclusion section of this update of DCVAX Direct is incongruent with the rumor that DCVAX Direct is
already a primitive technology(local and sytstemic,specific characteristics of injected aDC may predict --
survival,specific cytokine profile,etc) 
3)point 2 needs more specification but appears promising.

I absolutely agree. My research leads me to believe that they really are on to something big. Results reported
to date are consistent with my evidence based assumptions about mode of action. Dr. Bosch understands the
expected MO well but he is a very disciplined scientist who will not let emotion get in the way of interpreting
the evidence. I am duly impressed by his capabilities as a scientist and communicator. Best wishes.

I suspect that the magnitude of Steve's skepticism today, is as large as was the magnitude of his "faith"
previously(6 months ago).


I agree with him that there is a small risk next year(2016) , that the DCVAX-l phase 3 may not be
stat.significantly better than the placebo arm as the randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of phase
2 of ICT-107 found in Nov.2014. 
This reservation is only based on theory and the animal data in neuroimmunology.

Oneota investor, 
1)Please call the STICjournal office.They are very polite. 
They will tell you how to find the Nov, 6 2015 DCVAX Direct abstract in the Cutting Edge clinical track in the
current journal. 
2) then compare the methodology section and conclusions of the 2015 abstract with the same parameters of
the AACR april 2015 paper and the Journal for immunotherapy of cancer 2014 paper. 
3)You will see small but significant cautiously framed incremental claims(eg local and systemic effects,specific
characteristics of the injected D.C. and survival etc,etc 
4) to see "progress' you will have to read the fine print and make inferences.

Scientists do not write like journalists or artists,making large dramatic claims used by salesmen.


Their claims are cautious,nuanced,preli... and incremental. 
Hence the frustration in reading science abstracts on this and other platforms. 
Oral presentations however, permit actual verbal interactions with the author and more specifications of of granular
details of methodology and data analysis.

Re: Steve g saying something about DC Direct not being impressive is the exact opposite of Linda Powers'
claim in her presentation at London. If I remember correctly she tries to sell (oversell?) the audience on

Excellent WSJ article on Woodford's request for a special committee to investigate allegations of impropriety...

Major Shareholder Wants Inquiry Into Northwest Biotherapeutics Allegations


Chairman and CEO Linda Powers denies analyst claims about governance of biotech company


By  
Denise Roland  
Updated Nov. 28, 2015 5:19 p.m. ET


LONDON—A major shareholder is urging biotechnology firm Northwest Biotherapeutics Inc. to hold an inquiry into
allegations about the governance of the company by Chairman and Chief Executive Linda Powers.


Neil Woodford, a U.K. fund manager well-known for investing in the biotech industry, has sent a letter to the board of
the Bethesda, Md.-based company to recommend it establish an independent special committee to investigate the
claims. The letter was contained in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


He proposed the board appoint Elliott Leary, a former special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who now
conducts investigations for the global risk-management firm Freeh Group International Solutions LLC, as a
nonexecutive director.


If appointed, Mr. Leary then would convene a special committee of nonexecutive directors to investigate the
allegations, which were made largely by an equities research group, and which raise questions about what the
research group says are the company’s financial dealings with vehicles related to Ms. Powers.


The Woodford letter, which was dated on Tuesday, concluded: “In this way, we and other investors can then be
satisfied that the Company will have the benefit of a fully independent investigation.”


Ms. Powers in interviews on Friday and Saturday with The Wall Street Journal denied there have been any financial
irregularities between Northwest and entities related to her. She termed the allegations as “baloney.” She said
payments for services to such entities had been cleared by the Northwest board, independently audited and filed
where necessary with regulators.


She said Northwest had repeatedly been subjected to efforts by analysts and others “to throw mud against the wall at
us.” She said she “shared the view” of Mr. Woodford that there should be an investigation and “wanted to see this
stuff put to rest once and for all.”

Naked short selling isn't quite as illegal as I thought. Very interesting article. Does this account for the large short
position on NWBO? No real requirement to borrow the stock in order to short?


http://tinyurl.com/hk9...


"The case, Merrill Lynch v. Manning, arises from allegations by individual shareholders in Escala Group Inc., that
traders at Merrill Lynch, Knight Equity Markets and UBS Securities, among others, engaged in naked short selling to
manipulate the value of the stock. In essence, the original plaintiffs alleged that the traders made short sales without
bothering to borrow the securities that would be needed to cover the trade.


That's illegal -- sort of. No federal or state law directly criminalizes naked short selling. However, an SEC rule called
Regulation SHO says a broker-dealer must have “reasonable grounds” to believe that it could borrow and deliver the
security within three days. If the broker-dealer fails to deliver for 13 days, the regulation imposes a “close out” duty to
purchase and deliver securities “of like kind and quantity.”"

Volumelogic,


Mr. Woodford is connected to NWBO by his investment. NWBO must at least consider a recommendation
from an outside accounting firm for independent directors that Mr.Woodford's nominee would oversee as well
as a suggestion for another primary investigator other than Mr. Woodford's nominee. I agree with the need for
expeditious decision making but there can be no appearance of rubber stamping here. Best wishes.


04 Dec 2015, 12:27 PM


Volumelogic
Hi Doc,


Actually, I would feel very good about the BOD rubber stamping Woodford's proposal. It seems a prudent,
efficient, and timely approach to clearing up allegations, that if left unresolved, will limit NWBO's potential to
attract investors. The current BOD seemed asleep at the switch.


04 Dec 2015, 01:07 PM


Doc logic
Volumelogic,


I actually agree with you but opposition lawyers may not. Both sides are walking on thin ice at times. No one
can afford to make a misstep.


04 Dec 2015, 05:05 PM


Volumelogic
Doc,


Yes, you're certainly right. If any of these allegations regarding financial improprieties are true (or partly true) the
probability of new lawsuits is 100%. In fact, I suspect Woodford stated he was not aware of some of the recent
allegations prior to his last investment partly to ensure he had some standing for a claim against NWBO. However, if I
was on the NWBO Board, I would see Woodford's proposal as being in the interest of all shareholders, not just
Woodford.


Time is not on our side here. If nothing from the Board soon (next week?) we may see the shorts really come after us
and I wouldn't expect any buying to offset it.


If that doesn't happen, then my guess is the bottom is in and it's time to buy. Best not to predict, but to react to what
we see. This is all based on my assumption the science is real and the company has problems that can be sorted out.

My investment is long term and focused on peer reviewed evidence that intradermal combined with
Intratumoral injections of DC therapy are synergistic. NWBO has both and there is now no doubt that DC
therapy increases infiltrating lymphocyte concentrations. The makers of checkpoint inhibitors have already
proclaimed this from their own studies. Why would anyone give up on a therapy that big pharma already
states will make their therapies work better? What better reassurance can an investor have than an
endorsement from companies that would stand to lose a great deal if your own improved product might have
the potential to work without even using theirs? Best wishes.


06 Dec 2015, 10:39 PM


Volumelogic
Thanks Doc,


I'm not giving up. No plans to sell unless I see Woodford lose faith - which would be a disaster for NWBO. In fact,
under the right circumstances, I'll buy some more.


In order for our investment to prosper, we need great science, a solid company, and time. I'm not equipped to judge
the science so I try to follow the lead of large investors who are very capable of analyzing both the science and the
company. Thus, recent investments in NWBO following Woodford and GERN following Jansen/JNJ. My theory is to
use large investments to mark companies of interest, then try to pick the ones with greatest potential, set my entry
point below the big investor and wait. Surprisingly, given the fickleness of the market the opportunity to buy lower
seems to come around more often than not.


Although the science is generally beyond me (so I appreciate your thoughts) I can form an educated opinion about the
company. In the case of NWBO, new investments are limited by the allegations of poor (perhaps illegal) governance
and by the company's need for near-term financing. I believe both these issues can be resolved and adopting
Woodford's proposal quickly will be a good start. What will be the value of NWBO shares once the allegations and
near-term financing problem are behind us? I don't see any reason the corporate issues can't be resolved -
optimistically within three months.


"Buy low, sell high" is still the greatest stock market advice ever given. However until the BOD gets moving, it's too
risky for me to buy more.

NWBO is a different issue at the moment. I absolutely hate watching the price deteriorate while the BOD ponders a
no-brainer. Get an unbiased investigation going, get the results, fix the problems. This isn't rocket science.

Volumelogic,


What happened between Linda and Mr. Woodford with Ondra and his recommended FBI guy having ties to
competitor CLDX is why she can not afford to trust anyone. Fortunately Mr. Woodford has probably been
neutralized by a non disclosure agreement and being caught red handed trying to force moles into NWBO.
NWBO may have wanted to release some news but I believe by doing so they might have allowed Mr.
Woodford a chance take an adversarial role on behalf of others and sell some of his shares to those that
NWBO would prefer not have it in spite of his liking the science. I think Linda has decided to wait for
regulatory news so that no other news can be used against NWBO. As hard as this is to tolerate in front of
another options expiration pounding, it's better than Mr. Woodford using some excuse to sell shares, after the
damage he has already done, to continue an adversarial strategy.


14 Dec 2015, 08:53 PM


Volumelogic
Hi Doc,


Hard for me to believe Woodford would buy a big piece of NWBO in order to open the door to a spy for another
company. It sounds a bit like paranoia or deflection to me.


Linda has put the company at great risk. Her secretive and combative approach to management leaves NWBO
without friends or financing options. Woodford is alienated and probably looking for a way out, and at a time when we
should be looking for new financing, the company is untouchable. The share price hasn't found a bottom and there
seems little prospect the trend will change until the allegations of malfeasance are resolved. That will take "at least 90
days" and during this time the shorts will have free rein.


Nice work.

Many, many posts ago I suggested that because NWBO represented a possible threat to big pharma that they
would be attacked and that an example to follow with regard to price manipulation would be DNDN when it
was in the prevapproval process. DNDN never was the same threat that NWBO has become to big pharma
so it stood to reason NWBO would be targeted for worse attacks. Those attacks included attacks on Larry
Smith of smithonstocks.com which were very public. One of the ways that I suggested that attacks on NWBO

might appear would be through an attempt to get directors placed on NWBO'S board. Mr. Woodford, at this
point, can not be excluded from having some connection to Phase Five or the Ondra fiasco or the poor choice
of "detectives". His connection to big pharma and his activist role with regard to AZN has been well
established and GSK is a major holding of his. With big pharma at risk of loosing large to NWBO if it is
successful, there is no big leap in logic needed to connect the dots. Those who wish to absolve Mr. Woodford
of any I'll intention before a thorough investigation is complete are doing themselves and others a big
disservice and this includes cancer patients. Now is not the time to leave stones unturned whether at NWBO,
Phase Five, M r.Woodford's doorstep, hedge funds or big pharma. Mr. Woodford clearly can afford to
temporarily lose investor value in his funds

I couldn't agree more Volume, everything is a huge conspiracy theory when it comes to why the company operates as
it does or why the sp declines. However it's never considered when talking about Linda's conflict of interest through
NWBO and Cognate transactions. There are plenty of companies out there that pose a threat to big pharma and they
don't seem to be part of this big conspiracy being perpetrated by whom??.......Shorts on the other hand are certainly
to blame for some manipulation but if the company was strong the long side would crush the shorts by taking there
bargain offerings. I also think saying that big pharma has enlisted Woodford who has long been looked at as an
ethical, well regarded investor is ridiculous.


I've told a story many times before about how someone on the Yahoo MB found a vet clinic using a dendritic cell
therapy on animals. After further investigation it was learned that it was a Toucan owned company. Funny I didn't

company said nothing. Now that's a conspiracy. I wouldn't have had a problem with NWBO licensing the therapy to
treat animals if NWBO was being compensated but the funds were never to be seen.


That makes me wonder where the funds generated by compassionate use are being logged? Maybe investors should
start demanding answers to these questions as I have.....but like me I'm sure they wouldn't get a response.


15 Dec 2015, 08:39 PM


Doc logic
Thyfish,


The annual meeting is almost upon us and I expect that unless there are some very straight forward answers
given there, and or some very good news, that Adam and the rest will have plenty of ammo from disgruntled
longs that are fed up and ready to bite the hand that starves them. Linda must know this, or at least she
should, and must address the issues that she can as they are presented by shareholders. Several of the
staunchest supporters on ihub will not be attending the meeting so that leaves those who want to voice
complaints with that much more of an opportunity to do so.


The use of a DCVax similar by the vetinary business owned by Toucan may have been used under license for
investigational purposes only for NWBO and basically done at cost. They probably stopped doing this
treatment because of complaints to avoid the appearance of continued impropriety. If there was above cost
income from these treatments that was not reported it will be discovered by investigators. A failure to mention
this relationship would be called out in a very public forum and make the investigstors and NWBO look worse
than they already do for not taking the time to review and clarify these relationships for investors in the first
place. I believe that most investors do not realize the extent to which some people will go to get what they
want or keep what they have. If you do not want to read Deep Capture then at least watch the movie "The
Constant Gardener". This movie is based on a true story and it is about a British biopharma. I have a friend,
who went to Great Britain a while back, who spoke with a taxi driver that was involved in the whistle blowing
that led to a major scandal for that pharma.


Just today on ihub I was reading that several posters reported being cut off from Adam's blog on Twitter. I was
cut off from The Street's articles after I posted a few times there and on Seeking Alpha with comments
pointing out weaknesses in his arguments and hinting at Deep Capture type motives being demonstrated by
Adam. This is reality and I told Larry Smith about it when it happened.


The connections that Linda pointed out about people Mr. Woodford chose to "help" NWBO are real and there
has been no explanation or anger expressed towards Ondra or apology given by Mr. Woodford publicly for the
detriment potentially caused to NWBO by his actions. That has a bit of an elitist aroma to it. Let's see what the
rebound responses will be in a public forum over time. Perhaps Mr. Woodford has a different partnership deal
in mind than Linda does. Mr. Woodford is not as close to Roche or Pfizer as he is to GlaxoSmithKline and that
is a fact worth noting. Best wishes.

My take on the whole Cognate/NWBO/Powers conspiracy theories is this; if there is rampant illegal activity
and shady dealing going on with NWBO, with the amount of exposure, and media that this has had, and the
amount of accusations over 3 - 5 years with this company, the house of cards, or some whistle blower would
have already come out of the shadows. If a company is doing something illegal, or shady dealings, it will be
the last thing anyone suspects. Use Enron as an example. With years of manipulations, and shady activity,
Enron rarely was criticized by the media (they attacked authors of any critical stories/articles), and was only
truly publicly called out within months of the house of cards falling. If there is illegal activity, I am sure
something would have come out by now.

I'm not saying anything illegal is happening. The company is run by 2 lawyers (Les and Linda), I think they are
smart enough not to cross that line. That doesn't mean they aren't making sure they are well taken care of no
matter what happens with the trial. I do agree with you that because of the attention to this, Linda be prime for
many lawsuits if this trial doesn't succeed.

Hi Doc,


Thanks for sharing your thoughts, I always appreciate your view. I do however still believe that too many excuses are
made without support for NWBO and how it operates. I'm not invited to the ASM this year as I only hold warrants, but
I wouldn't be able to make it anyway. IMO I doubt anything of substance will be shared or addressed anyway.


I haven't had the chance to read deep capture but I have skimmed it and I have read many posts summarizing. Of
course I believe that there are orchestrated attacks and conspiracies against companies, bio and anything else, with
the potential to disrupt profits for large companies/people. I also think that Linda has done a poor job managing and
has only fed the machine with her lack of transparency.


You mention a plausible theory on the animal treatment but unfortunately it's only that, a theory. It could have been
addressed by NWBO when asked about it but they chose to sweep it under the rug, like so many other issues. They
only have themselves to blame for the toxic financing that has devalued our investment, only until Woodford arrived. I
would suspect that some bad financing is right around the corner again.

Direct Phase l trial but please keep Ben and his 3 children in your prayers as Laurie lost her 3.5 year battle
with cancer on 12-6-2015. Ben has been an avid supporter of NWBO and their attempt to find a cure. Laurie
was one of the earlier patients treated and Ben posted his hope that some of the information gained from the
study she was involved in as well as the effect of additional treatments after the Direct treatment will help
guide decisions regarding direction of research in future trials. There is a fund being set up in Laurie's honor: 
Laurie Beth Condon Hodges Memorial Fund 
11 Londonderry Ln. 
Georgetown, MA 01833


Anyone interested is welcome to remember her part in the cause to find "The Cure". Best wishes and Merry
Chistmas.

Correction, that should be Londonberry Ln. in the address above.

Sorry folks, the notes I took were wrong and the original address I wrote is the correct one. Score one for
autocorrect. The address is Laurie Beth Condon Hodges Memorial Fund

Thyfish,


On a side note. Good call on the warrants. I too hold the majority of my NWBO stake in warrants. I am
thinking of maybe picking some more up right now with them under $3. The way I see NWBO, its a make it or
break it stock. So yes, if you bought NWBO shares and DCVax-L P3 fails, you could maybe sell your shares
for 10% of what you bought them, and the warrants would be worthless, but saving 10% of your investment
isnt worth the possibility of getting double the shares and therefore double the payout if P3 is positive.

Anyways, I am sure many have read my take on the warrants. I just like to hear that someone else was smart
about that!

I was aware of Ben and his wife. I'm very sorry to hear of his loss. It sounded like she fought right up until the
end. Unfortunately like many, she was taken by a horrible disease way too young. Very sad for for Ben and
his kids.


It should make us all enjoy family and friends that much more this Holiday season. The best to you and yours!

I did hold equal warrants and shares at one point but divested the shares earlier this year and invested that in
ARGS. I have the same thoughts as you on the warrants in comparison to the shares. I think my abc is about
$1.50. I picked them up a few days after they started trading and I kicked myself for not loading up at .50 just
a few days before.

Do Due Diligence
Why is author dismissing information arm for the 25 GBM patients with early tumor recurrence ? That is their most
recent data and this is a very biased report because you forgot to add that 40% of that population exceeded 3 year
survival. That is HUGE and no other treatment to date can match that.


So DCVAX-L can improve both FPS and OS, so even if FDA wouldn't care about FPS it will get approved some day.
Don't forget that it is FDA that agreed to the transformation of 240 patients phase 2 trial into a 300 patients phase 3
trial, in your report you say it is like NWBO is doing its trials on its own, it is obviously not the case and the odds of
approval are much higher than the "extremely unlikely" you seem to defend.


I appreciate the time spent to protect your "short" investment but reports like this can't tarnish a working science for
ever, all you may get is some low scale dilution at lower price than what it would be if there were no allegations. So for
example instead of reaching let's say a $40 price action in the long term we will reach $20 but anyway in the end
shorts will lose.

Interesting to see NWBO holding up well yesterday as some other small biotechs were butchered. Have we reached
some support?

This article was derided and then called just another short attack. The company is now virtually worthless, has not
answered any of the questions which truly needed explanation, has not addressed their hold, lack of progress, or
every detail brought up in this piece about the shill-financing and fraud.... People could have shorted this Enron dump
and made 1000% since late last year.

Yes Jack....this is a huge concern for longs like me....since there is really no "new" news, the pps goes down like a
stone in a bottomless lake....I wonder if we will ever get some kind of "new" news that will help us understand if it
works or is just a fake-out??? I am holding and waiting like forever and wishing Linda or Les would explain what is
actually happening on soooo many issues....all sensible commentary has also dried up like a puddle in the desert...I
am just venting....so, this drowned rat is not about to abandon ship, but I will go down with it, but just wish I knew from
Linda and Les, not you or Phase V the whys and the what happened.....so, the shorts won, but I am longnwbo

Lululemon fell similarly after its IPO at ~ $30 a share, down to ~ 1/10th at ~ $4 a share (NWBO came out on
Nasdaq @ `$2 a share is now ~1/10 that). Several articles came out over numerous years that Lulu was a fad
and there were numerous articles and comments stating they knew it was a fad, and "I told you so!". And then
Lulu jumped up to $160 a share (including the 2 for 1 split).


Let's wait until the Phase 3 results come out before we start saying "I told you so".

When exactly will those P III trial results be released Bohsie? From what I have read you seem like a very
smart individual, do you not get the feeling your being strung along yet? I was a loyal devoted follower for
years until finally I said enough was enough with all of the broken promises. I got burnt pretty bad on ARGS
too so I've been sitting on the sidelines and haven't been following what's going on. I do still hold 15K
warrants but I would suspect if there is good news they will wait til the warrants expire anyways.....that being
said weren't results supposed to be published in the summer?

Thyfish, Thank you for continuing this important discussion.  
I also feel so disappointed with the eternal waiting game of having the Phase III results of DCVAX L collected,
scrubbed, analized, and then published. 
The results are the MILLION OF DOLLARS QUESTION and really the only question. Some smarter person
on another blog, and I quote, "Hero or Zero".


I will hold and "stay tuned' till the real results actually come out. When will that ever happen? I haven't a clue.


Does anyone? I don't even know if the management knows. Sad. I am so deeply underwater here with call
options, warrants, shares and hopes and dreams so scattered and seemingly gone up in smoke.


Why do I hold? Same reason I brought in. Great idea. The highest research scientists in the world. 4
countries. Manufacturing ready. Pipeline ready. Closely held. Revolutionary treatments soon to be validated, (I
hope and pray).


Thyfish, I am not to smart or a pumper. I cannot bash what I don't know or understand. For the sake of
patients and families, I hope and pray it is what others, like Bohsie, are pointing out.


Maybe, LOL, maybe, results will come out before Christmas. I sure hope so for my peace of mind. Got to go
jog now and chill out. LOL Peace and blessings to you and yours.

There are so many that got invested in NWBO back in 2013/2014 based on the promise of the science and
platform. Your sentiments encapsulate what most ALL true longs feel.


Who knows what has really gone on behind the scenes? We are left with a management and CEO that has
not spoken in 2+ yrs and although we get the now occasional regurgitation of info sprinkled with some data
updates, it still leaves the market and investing community scratching their heads as to if this trial will be
successful.


Honestly, if it weren't for my belief in Dr. Liau, I would have been long gone. As stated, who knows what has
actually gone on with our management, the clinical hold, FDA, IA's, Woodford etc... I do happen to still believe
that as painful as this "strategy" has been by LP et al, it will prove to be fruitful for investors and patients!


I'm actually amazed there is still such a large contingency that bashes this Company that only has a $50M
MC and claims to have no position. To me, that is very telling. Why would you spend so much time day in and
day out continuing to bash a Company and drug that you are sure has failed? Are they just Do gooders? I
think not and to me the answer and their agenda is quite clear. Somehow, thru this all, NWBO has managed
to weather the storm and will limp across the finish line and Dr. Liau's efforts along with all the others involved
will be validated.


Best to you and also hoping and praying for the best here.

Listen, if NWBO has been lying and stringing us along all this time, then there will be a massive lawsuit, with
numerous shareholders, a whack of "Longs" as well as shorts that will be lining up to sign up for a lawsuit
against LP, and all the directors.


I don't know when the results will be, I can only hope they come soon, or before Dec 2017.

You make an absolutely great observation. WHY DO THE SHORTS STILL BASH THIS STOCK
FERVENTLY? Seriously, its not like one is going to make a ton of money shorting this stock at this point,
unless you really invest a ton into the short. So why would SHORTS care soooooo much about point out
NWBO's failure. It's $0.16 a share. If you are a short, then I would buy out, and take my gains. Why take a
chance that its positive and you bankrupt yourself with having to buy back in at $200 a share.


But that even more suggests to me that there are BIGGER PLAYERS interested in keeping this stock down,
as low as possible and trying to bankrupt NWBO, because NWBO is in such a strong position to succeed IF
(AND THAT IS AN BIG IF), PHASE 3 RESULTS ARE OVERLY POSITIVE, BOTH PFS & OS!!!

thank you again Boshie for responding, answering concerns and still waiting for the only information that
matters, the topline results of our phase III trial of DCVAX L.


so it is the Eve of All Saints Day and the "trick or treaters" are bombarding my door as I type this message.
And "trick or treat" it will be when we finally learn how well and I repeat, "how well" it works.... This is a
reported fact: "patients are living longer". 
So, if it is "grapefruit juice", then approve it. Whatever is being the cause of patients with this serious cancer
attack being treated with WHAT EVER and they are living longer, then FDA, approve it and get it to sick
patients. Please note, whatever patients are receiving in this trial is, IT IS NOT TOXIC. So, maybe it is
grapefruit juice you can buy over the counter, then I hope this trial proves it and people get whatever it is that
is helping suffers live LONGER AND BETTER LIVES. happy Halloween.
