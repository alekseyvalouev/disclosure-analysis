Medidata: Why We Went Long And Why IBM Might Acquire It
Top Idea | Jul. 12, 2016 5:00 AM ET31 comments
by: Suhail Capital


Summary


Most compelling relative valuation in all enterprise SAAS.


Trading at nearly half valuation on EV/rev basis of vertical life sciences SAAS peer
Veeva Systems.


Extremely impressive needle-moving competitive large pharma platform wins
improve longer-term revenue growth visibility; yet, stock trading of recent near-term
lackluster revenue momentum.


Ideal target for IBM Watson Health based on recent deals in the space; would
comfortably command at least a 35% premium to current share price.


Earlier this year, we published a report explaining why we turned around and went long on
former SAAS short Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV). Our thesis had a lot to do with relative
valuation, views on IMS's (IMS) acquisition of Cegedim, expectations that Veeva would
win Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) CRM business, as well as our conclusion that the Dell/EMC
(EMC) deal and other M&A activity in Veeva's non-CRM businesses was benefiting it.
Since then, the stock has appreciated by over 50%, and outside of Salesforce.com
(NYSE:CRM) is the only enterprise SAAS name trading at multi-year highs. We now
believe a comparable if not arguably better investment opportunity exists in another former
vertical life sciences TAM focused short of ours in Medidata Solutions (NASDAQ:MDSO).


Medidata: Revisiting the Short Thesis


When we published our short thesis on Medidata in early 2015, the stock was trading
around $50. We argued that Medidata's claims of a $10+ bln TAM were drastically
overstated. As we did with our Veeva TAM analysis, we dissected the space and
conclusively proved that Medidata's realistically attributable TAM was probably 75-80%
lower. Based on this analysis, we concluded revenue growth would start to slow and that
the stock would rerate to around a fair value of $32. After a somewhat bizarre and brief
surge in the stock a few weeks after we published our report, things settled down and our
thesis eventually played itself out. Management has spent the better part of past four
quarters disappointing the Street. In its most recent Q1 report, it achieved only 14%
subscription revenue growth and recorded a 2% yr/yr decline in billings. Now, to be clear,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 2/16


part of this weakness has to do with the nature of the large platform deals it is signing and
how revenue ramps, and that is actually part of the opportunity we see in going long here.
However, there is no denying that from a TAM standpoint, there are serious questions
marks on how at 5% penetration sub revenue is now growing at only 14%.


So why have we decided to go long this stock?


Our bullish thesis on Medidata boils down to three very simple and generally related
arguments


1) An extremely compelling relative valuation


2) Improving competitive position and future outlook in context of a stock that is overly
discounting near-term revenue momentum weakness


3) SAAS consolidation and industry trends making Medidata an attractive takeover target


Medidata's Relative Valuation as a Vertical Life Science SAAS is the Most
Compelling it has Ever Been


Our most notable reason for going long Medidata shares here is the massive discount the
stock now trades at when compared to its vertical life sciences peer Veeva Systems. At 5x
EV/EST 2016 revenue, Medidata is trading at a huge discount to vertical SAAS peer
Veeva, which is at 9.7x EV/EST 2016 Revenue. This 94% premium is the widest these
two names have traded since we started following them. This gap is completely
unjustified, and presents an exceptional pair trade opportunity for any long/short investor.
In fact, we are hard pressed to consider a pair trade that could be a nicer match than this
in the whole tech sector. There are reasons for this disparity between the two names that
we will get into shortly, but considering the similar margin profiles of both and subscription
revenue run rates, even a surface glance at this pair trade should jump out at the most
skeptical of investors.


Medidata's Recent Competitive Wins and Improving Future Outlook Are Not being
Reflected in the Current Share Price


While a cursory numbers analysis would indicate this pair trade makes a lot of sense,
there can often be a reason for such a gap that might in fact be justifiable. A closer
examination of Medidata versus Veeva will show that VEEV is expected to grow total
revenue at 27% this year versus 18% for Medidata (If you back out Veeva's Zinc
acquisition's expected revenue contribution for the year, the numbers will look more like
21% vs. 18%). Now this disparity may warrant a premium of sorts, but obviously nowhere

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 3/16


near the gap that currently exists. However, we actually think the drill down into a pair
trade case here is uniquely more compelling than an initial analysis would provide. When
compared to Medidata, the market right now is drastically overpaying for Veeva's revenue
growth and TAM penetration in the life sciences vertical. This is because Veeva has seen
the benefit of multiple large CRM deployments as well as initial easy pickings in Vault
materialize into revenue in recent quarters. This is the nature of a vertical business.


Once you deploy a large top 10 or top 20 pharma, you get a nice step function boost in
your revenue. Of course, the problem here is that Veeva is now fully penetrated in large
pharma from a CRM customer standpoint. When we say fully penetrated, we mean 100%;
there are literally no more notable flags for it to win in large pharma. Now contrast this
against Medidata in top 25 pharma where it has recently won Boehringer Ingelheim,
Bristol-Myers Squib (NYSE:BMY), and a significant platform expansion deal with Celgene
(NASDAQ:CELG). That's three major top 25 wins in the last six months for the company
that are currently not meaningfully contributing to the top line. This is of course notable
because when you break down annual guidance, it will go from roughly 14% growth for
the first three quarters of the year to potentially in excess of 30% by Q4 as these new
large deals start contributing some meaningful revenue. Also, remember in contrast to
Veeva in CRM, Medidata's platform wins in top 25 pharma ramp much slower as
deployment goes beyond simply getting a piece of software in a sales reps hand in one
particular geography. So there is very decent embedded upside here that is also being
ignored by the market.


Now how much upside you want to believe in here depends on how much stock you put
into management's ongoing TAM ramp argument. But no matter how skeptical you are,
there is no denying that annual dollar value for these large deals ramps significantly from
year 1 to 5. We are assuming in the 2x range though those who want to be extremely
optimistic can subscribe to management's arguments of up 3-4x. Regardless of the view
you take, when compared to Veeva's top 25 pharma deal wins and where they are at
revenue contribution wise in their life cycle, the market right now is drastically
undervaluing Medidata. Or conversely you could argue drastically overvaluing Veeva yet
again! What's interesting about this is when you break out consensus estimates for 2017,
that's exactly what you get as the two names are expected to grow their top lines at the
same rate.


So, we aren't exactly making a surprise argument here as far as the numbers go. In fact,
we'd argue that there is probably decent upside to Medidata's 2017 revenue estimates
and some downside to Veeva's based on our knowledge of the space and what we expect

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 4/16


going forward. This is because Medidata has more potential headroom in top 25 pharma
for EDC deal wins going forward versus Veeva in its comparable core TAM in CRM where
it is fully penetrated, and because outside of EDC, Medidata is still pretty nascent in its
broader clinical platform offerings versus the revenue penetration Veeva has achieved in
content management. Also, remember that while there is about a 10% overall revenue
disparity between these two, they are literally almost identical in scale when measured by
the all important subscription revenue. In fact, if you back out the Zinc contribution last
quarter, these two were roughly both generating exactly $90 million in life sciences vertical
SAAS subscription revenue.


Yet, Veeva is now somehow twice as big as Medidata????


Now, top this all off with the fact that Medidata has a new CFO comfortably in place, is
taking more conservative approach to guidance after nearly two years of hiccups, and has
reorganized its sales organization.


Which company would you rather be long?


As an investor going forward, we are extremely comfortable that at the current share price
risk/reward has now shifted in favor of positive catalyst stock surprises versus negative
ones for the foreseeable future.


A SAAS Consolidation Wave Means Medidata is Now an Ideal Takeover Candidate


One variable that is always difficult to account for in SAAS land is the sector multiple and
broader sentiment towards the space. When we published on Veeva earlier this year,
SAAS multiples proceeded to completely implode over the following few weeks. This is of
course why we love relative valuation pair trades in this space so much. Predicting where
multiples are heading for the broader growth group in tech is virtually impossible. But
every now and then, there are outliers that can be exploited. We have done this with
Veeva in both directions, Salesforce/Workday (NYSE:WDAY), Nvidia
(NASDAQ:NVDA)/Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), and Ultimate Software
(NASDAQ:ULTI)/Workday in the past few years as well to a small degree with
Cornerstone (NASDAQ:CSOD) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). And while we believe
Medidata/Veeva is now another classical example of such an opportunity, we think the
recent consolidation wave in the SAAS and tech space makes it even more compelling.


Big tech has gone shopping again, and we believe there are going to be several more
deals in the SAAS space before the year is out. As far as Medidata goes, we think at
current prices, it is by far one of the more compelling targets out there. Unlike Veeva, it's

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 5/16


not deriving the bulk of its revenues as a value added reseller of a larger SAAS company's
platform like Salesforce.com. Thus, it has multiple potential suitors, and at current
multiples, arguably a few very motivated ones.


The most notable suitor that jumps out at this juncture is IBM (NYSE:IBM). Big blue has
gone on a mini shopping spree in the healthcare-related technology space. Over the past
year, it has spent in excess of $4 billion acquiring Merge Healthcare, Truven Health, and
Phytel. These deals all have the intention of boosting IBM's Watson Health Analytics
offering, which, of course, is what makes Medidata so interesting here. Medidata's
management has been selling the life sciences vertical big data analytics story to the
Street for the past few years, and has increasingly bolstered its offerings in areas related
to analytics-like risk-based monitoring. Thus, it does not require a large stretch of the
imagination to see why IBM would be interested in acquiring a SAAS company whose
clinical trial data platform is now being used by 17/25 of the world's largest pharmaceutical
companies, but that doesn't seem to be the only angle here.


IBM paid 4.8x trailing EV/REV for Merge Healthcare. That's pretty remarkable for a niche
traditional software company whose revenue declined 8% the previous year. It's also
pretty interesting when you consider a fifth of this business is in the EDC broader clinical
trial software/services Medidata offers. Not that Merge can really be considered a MDSO
competitor here as it is much more of a small-scale player in the EDC/clinical software
space, but still tough overlap to ignore. That aside, the real story here is IBM decided to
pay up for Merge because of its role as a software provider for medical images. By
acquiring Merge, whose software has processed over 30 billion medical images, IBM has
opened up Watson to potentially AI-driven health-related image analysis as well as
broader personalized healthcare services. Merge customers will now be able to cross
reference medical image data against broader Watson Health-related data assets for
individual patients and similar patient populations. So clearly this has a lot more to do with
bolstering the Watson data set versus simply acquiring a medical image processing
software provider. Then, IBM went and paid $2.6 billion for Truven Health Analytics' 215
million patient lives data set, which informs benefits decisions for 33% of Americans.
That's 6x EV/REV for a high-single-digit revenue growth established health data provider.


So, one has to wonder what exactly Medidata is worth to IBM?


Its platform already captures all the data related to a patient in a clinical trial. This includes
procedures, lab data, patient reported outcomes, medical device data, and now even
personal mobile health data. As things stand, roughly 60% of electronically captured
clinical trials on the planet are on the Medidata platform. So, there is no denying that this



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM
5/23/2018 Medidata: Why We Went Long And Why IBM Might Acquire It - Medidata Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDSO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 6/16


is an ideal acquisition target for IBM Watson Health. This is mainly because the bulk of
future upside in the Medidata story is in the unique insights/analytics it can deliver to life
sciences customers because of the scale of its platform. Obviously, Watson is the ideal
platform to crunch this type of data and deliver these types of insights. You very rarely are
going to come across something this obvious that is not remotely priced into a stock. In
our view, IBM would be willing to pay at least $60 a share for Medidata and up to as much
as potentially $80 in an auction process that would most likely include Oracle
(NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP).


We think it is important to note that Oracle has refused to throw in the towel in EDC as it
did in life sciences CRM, and we think that is a reflection of the fact that strategically it
likes the future of this space more than pharma rep CRM software. Oracle paid roughly 4x
revenue in 2010 to acquire on-premise EDC competitor Phase Forward when valuations
in SAAS land were much more muted. Medidata is currently trading at an enterprise value
of roughly 5x 2016 revenue, and it's not like Larry Ellison has been shy about buying a
competitor once he failed to compete against them. That of course brings SAP into the
equation, which has so far not delved deep into this space. While SAP jumping into the
clinical data capture space probably seemed like a stretch a few years ago, you could now
argue that Medidata's broader clinical trial SAAS platform and Oracle competitive
displacements as well as increasing focus on analytics-intensive areas like RBM make it a
much more suitable target today. Also, it shouldn't require much to get these two talking as
Medidata's current CFO is the ex-CFO of SAP Business Objects and MDSO has been
using SAP Hana for real time analytics for several years now.


In any case, we still feel IBM makes the most sense. Whether that happens in the near
future remains to be seen, but as more deals are announced in the space, we expect
Medidata's valuation discount to the likes of Veeva to rapidly disappear.


How To Trade This


The SAFEST way to play this is to build a long position in Medidata and match it with a
short in Veeva. We emphasize safe because we have noticed in the past that many other
investors who have contacted us regarding short or long ideas with pairs simply refuse to
hedge. At the current multiple gap, Veeva almost appears to be operating in a different
industry. In fact, at 9.6x EV/2016 REV, Veeva is the most expensive stock in ALL of
Software. This means its carrying a higher EV/sales multiple than Workday, Splunk
(NASDAQ:SPLK), ServiceNow, Ultimate Software, Netsuite (NYSE:N), Salesforce.com,
Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), or even the recently acquired Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) with

the takeover premium included. Remember we are talking absolute multiples here and not
even growth adjusted as almost all these names are expected to grow their top lines faster
than Veeva this year and next!


EV/Rev 2016 2016 Rev consensus growth


rate


Salesforce 6.6 24%


Workday 8.5 33%


ServiceNow 7.8 36%


Netsuite 6.2 30%


Ultimate 7.8 26%


Splunk 7.2 34%


Veeva Systems 9.7 26%


Tableau (NYSE:DATA) 3.4 29%


Medidata 5 18%


Zendesk 7.6 45%


Demandware 8.3 28%


So, clearly a Veeva short here has its own merits beyond simply a pair against a Medidata
long, and should provide a perfect hedge against another SAAS sector valuation crash.
That being said, we do think the current M&A wave in the space combined with the unique
Watson Health appeal as well as record discount in Medidata shares to Veeva makes this
a pretty clear cut outright long that shouldn't leave anyone licking their wounds at these
levels. So, if you are uncomfortable shorting, our view is at the current levels, the
downside simply going outright long Medidata here is minimal.

Disclosure: I am/we are long MDSO.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving

Excellent article and idea for a trading. SAAS is a difficult sector to trade and things can change fast, so a stock, after
being a long can become a short next year and vice-versa. 
Now the sector looks overvalued again, so short term I am confident even in VEEV short, while MDSO in any case is
a good long term play even because of the possible buy-out. I would say that even ORCL may be interested, having
lost some business in the sector and having good amount of cash. Also the author shows an excellent track record
even for predicting buyout (I remember Acme Packet, Riverbed, Tibco...). The valuations are different from those
reported by SA, the biggest gap is for DWRE which is reported at 4.82 EvxS in SA and 8.3 here. I am also noting that
DATA is still the cheapest in the sector at 3.4

Is 'Long IMS' going to be your next call? Not being picky, just surprised to see your reversed call on this one.


I have no horse in this race, as I find this industry too complicated. But I have read and enjoyed your short thesis on
VEEV and MDSO.


Having said that I believe you fail to address many of the pitfalls you yourself explained in your previous MDSO
report, particularly with regards to very limited TAM, various red flags and in general advising investors to steer clear
of the vertical SAAS plays. Readers (myself included) would love to hear your counter arguments.


Also, not entirely clear if you consider your previous extensive analysis on MDSO to be incorrect (and just lucky that
price reached the target during Feb sell-off), or has the company's fundamentals improved in the meantime.

Author’s reply »  Great comment. Obviously we have given a lot of thought to this, and would be happy to
expand on our thinking. To be clear we'd argue that the TAM concerns remain very valid for both mdso and
veeva. Looking at veeva now for example its ev is bigger than their stated TAM which if you have read our
work closely you know quite well they have backed off that number a lot since IPO by going to great lengths
to emphasize how many things need to be accomplished to get there. We think for both these names from a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 9/16


CRM or EDC core product standpoint there is no denying the TAM argument we have made. You probably
have a more compelling case in mdso just from the larger customer footprint and much greater headroom still
left for them in edc, but still these are both super high penetrated names in their core offering. But ultiamtely
when you talk about fair value over several years for stocks that are hyper sensitive to near term revenue
momentum which in fact can be misleading in general and even more so for verticals who are so reliant on
potentially one or two mega needle moving customer wins you really need to account for sector valuations.
There is no denying saas comps are a wildly moving target, and where we have excelled execution wise is
ironically more often on the long pairs in these short thesis which people pay little attention to.


So to be perfectly clear the number one reason we are long mdso is without a doubt the relative valuation gap
with veeva which is followed by the general gap to the broader group. The disparity is really at record
proportions, and knowing these two businesses well it simply incomphensible. Despite believing veeva was
attractive relatively speaking earlier this year we are even now scratching our heads at how it is trading here
with the rest of the sector where it is at and particularly where mdso is as well.


Any deconstruction of the two should lead one to conclude that you'd be buying into mdso relative growth
momentum here and selling into veeva's in precisely the same vertical. Veeva has a nice little inorganic boost
to go with momentum from earlier customer wins combined with customer tam full penetration in crm. On the
flip side mdso has had sagging revenue momentum because it had gone a while without big vertical
displacements despite still having pretty decent tam upside in the top 25. Well now they have recently one
multiple large clients, but are not yet being rewarded for the step function boost that is going to provide going
forward. It may come as a shock to you, because it foten surprises us as well, but if you talk to long only's
they are fixated on veeva's recent top line numbers relative to mdso. That is pretty funny if you consider you
have great visibility into how that is going to be drastically changing as this year ends and next year begins.
We often wonder if somehow veeva lost a top five in crm and we knew full well how much revenue would be
rolling off 8-12 months from now if these long only types would still be overpaying for the near term
performance??? Looking at veeva vs mdso today the answer is probably yes. Anyway that's a big part of the
thinking here, but what really changed our mind was the m&a argument.


Going back to fair value arguments maybe the compelling case can be made that mdso is probably fully
valued around $40 now on a stand alone basis. But one it comes to these saas names you do have to ask
yourself what is the company worth to a rational buyer. That's one of those needle moving things that causes
wild sector swings in valuation that are much more important than actual individual performance for stocks
like these. This is because what's 'rational' here often seems irrational on a stand alone basis. But cash rich
old cap tech with still pretty valuable share prices and low rates who are desperate for growth can pay
premiums that frankly torpedo fair value tam based assesments if they feel they are filling a product gap. On
that level mdso is very interesting and its good you brought up ims because the contrast between the two
here is worth noting. IMS bread and butter has been milking data insights out of its large prescription data set.
Plug them into an ibm and you really have to wonder how much more can be extracted that IMS hasn't spent
the last decade trying to milk from an analytics/insight standpoint. MDSO is the opposite. They really are just
entering that stage of filling out their platform with the world's pharma r&d, but theoretically have barely
scratched the surface insight wise with what can be done with such related clinical trial data on a grand scale.
Do we buy their 4-6x argument as far as what they can deliver from these customers beyond pure edc with
added software modules and anlaytics? Probably not. But do we believe that they are much more interesting

at full penetration from a revenue upside potential in these fortune 100 names over veeva in pharma rep crm?
For sure. Then is often the case yous tart paying attention to things that either confirm or refute such a thesis.
IBM paying 4.7x revenue for merge falls into such a category. In the two years before the deal revenues were
down 10%+ and 8%. Also 20% of the business is eclinical os which essentially is a mini mdso biz. Add on top
of that that this is really very legacy image processing software and not exactly some new buzz cloud provider
and well you start to pay attention. Then you see the 6x for truven which also has been around for a while and
is not knocking the cover off the ball growth wise. Put those two together and well you have to think at 5x ibm
buys mdso on a phone call and throws their mgmt team a nice party. They'd get a saas embedded in top 50
pharma with pretty good 20% cagr rev visibility for next 4 years whose value they would be uniquely
enhancing once married to their buzz grabbing moonshot Watson Analytics platform. That obviously sets a
floor stock wise which is what got us long this name over the past few weeks. And the recent veeva splurge
provided us a nice pair hedge and reason to publish the last few days. Also the fact that from a product
penetration standpoint that this would appeal to sap as well, and also that oracle continues to fight it out here
despite mdso slowly taking away their customers is a reminder that m&a appeal here probably would involve
the entire big three. Now look at names like demandware which got what they got despite oracle, ebay, and
sap having platforms. Or how about the recent netsuite rumor? Oracle paying 10x sales for netsuite in mid
market after spending the past 5 years rewriting fusion to take customers on their own? There is no product
gap fill here? So yeah these things all play a part despite the fact that we still believe our initial thesis. Not that
this is saying much. If their tam was $14bl would revenues be growing like this here. Same with veeva ...really
at 8% penetration do they need to do 130ml acquistion to get 500 bps of revenue growth?? Obviously not. So
hedge away with the ludicrous pair in case m&a wave ends soon and then reassess a year from now. No
different than what we went through with ultimate software in feb. We've had a lot of people complain about
that to us, but reality was that was a short that was highly predicated on being a sector outlier. Well, the sector
turned on a dime. So while we watched the stock climb back to15 and even 20% above were we shorted
it...the average other saas name did triple that. We do wonder at what point this phase will end in this sector,
but honestly for past three years playing relative valuation here has been a fantastic way to generate alpha.

Yes, ULTI seemed to be a good short, but outperformed most peers since February. There was no clear
hedge or pair for that trade, even if looking retrospectively , PAYC outperformed it. Others like DATA, WDAY,

Author’s reply »  Nothing that has worked as well as saas. We do a lot of pairs, but in the more established
sectors clearly individual stock issues can dominate and lead to some pair blowups as the underperformer
you may like for whatever reason trades to far steeper discounts and the outperformer crazier premiums. In
saas, essentially when it comes to netsuite, servicenow, workday, ultimate, veeva, mdso, and before
demandware and concur you really have had the market simply recognizing each individual name as
essentially leader in respective niche. Thus, sector multiple has really been the main valuation mover which
has allowed for these nice pairs everytime one name finds itself at an extreme for one reason or another.
Thought about trying this in cybersecurity, but frankly group always struck us as more difficult to play in such a
manner as they overlap a lot more and really tougher to define respective niche wise.

This pair trade did not work at all anyway. It was better to do the opposite shorting MDSO and buying VEEV as VEEV
outperformed by 19% after almost 1 year. The thesis was not absurd, but VEEV kept growing more than MDSO. As I
told elsewhere VEEV growth had only a marginal slowing from 34 to 31% even with acquisition which was well done
without issuing debt. MDSO had an acceleration in growth to 26%, but not enough to fill the gap.  
My critic is about considering only saturation in big pharma clients without considering that many of them are
spending more. ULTI short started to work after 6 months, so it was mainly a problem of timing but here the problem
is more serious after 9 months.

Author’s reply »  Yea this is a very knucklehead comment. Veev/Mdso been about almost identical till about two
weeks ago when veev/crm pr started a new kick in the stock. Furthermore, is there a we are short veev disclosure
here. We only added that trade later and an aggressive manner after its december earnings pop. Stock hit 48...its
spent the last few months majorly underperforming. We were able to cover at 42-43. We have re shorted 49. Your
analysis is flimsy at best and purely focused on headlines. We do just a little bit more work. The veev story is not
about increased pharma spending. They are fully saturated in crm. Network is a failure. The whole story last 18
months has been regulated content management and vault. Though we don't see you posting on our go long Veev at
22$ on precisely that thesis article. Things have worked out nicely in vault but as you can see by deals they
announcing and their push to expand vault outside of pharma their runway revenue wise is small. And you literally
need to be from mars if you think pharma is opening up their budgets after whats been going on.


Now let's set that all aside. Look at expected growth rates for WDAY and NOW in 2017 and their current ev/sales
multiples. Factor in that their TAM is several orders of magnitude bigger and reconcile that. Now look at crm...it trades
at 5.4x vs 11x for Veeva. We presume this splurge in volume last ten sessions is because someone thinks the crm
deal combined with them having been on crm potential tgts list makes them a takeout. Assume a 20% premium, that
would cost beinoff 9bl for company that gets most of its ebitda reselling crm platform and has full penetrated seat
wise. Now if crm was 100bl maybe that could be justified, but at these levels no way. He is not spenidng 20% his ev
on this when twitter is available for that. So instead of sitting her talking about 300bps in top line growth you should be
considering that on an ev/sales business mdso which has same margin profile and customer base is trading at half
the valuation. And they have a big data set, and are not locked into crm.

The irony here is that veeva probably has never been this expensive before even when you look back at crazy early
days of 2014 w fraction of rev and near same price of few weeks ago. This is because the whole sector has been
growing into their multiples vs multiple expansion. At this point if i'm beinoff id rather sell crm for 110-120 a share to
msft/goog/amzn/ibm before buying anything else in space. Buying back their stock probably even makes more sense
vs any saas deal. Veev at a 50% ev/rev multiple premium to any notable saas is preposterous.

Not really almost identical till 2 weeks ago, as even in November VEEV was about 19% higher compared to MDSO.
There are periods of convergence when the 2 stocks are in line (or with small difference) and period of VEEV
outperformance and period of divergence. Bottom line there was not the equality in valuation predicted in the article,
but I agree that VEEV looks overvalued now. You cannot say that my analysis is focused on the headlines, as the
31% growth in VEEV and the 26% growth in MDSO emerge from he SEC filing, I totally ignore the headlines, but the
difference is that I am more skeptical than you about the research because there is always something missing or
unpredictable. Vault grew better than you expected and the convergence in growth and valuation between VEEV and
MDSO did no materialize. I closed my short on VEEV before your target because I understood Vault was growing
more than expected even before you went long and stated it in one or 2 of my comments.


28 Mar 2017, 08:49 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
Bottom line is the business is expanding as they are still growing nicely and even outside of pharma. You say the
runaway is small, but they are just starting and growth can even accelerate and even Vault was considered small and
insignificant by you initially. There is a risk that this recent outperformance can be explained by something you are not
aware.


28 Mar 2017, 08:59 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We went long at 22$ because we "Expected vault to do better than expected" and sold at
$38...arguing over semantics between 45-50 pales in comparison. And when we say headlines we mean the
revenue number and not focusing on underlying market. Reps continue to shrink...vault is not all roses from
here...valuation is 50% higher than next closest saas. Volume recently inidicates an accumulator..we shud get
a filing soon.

Also the margin profile is not the same, VEEV has better op margin from last 8-k

Author’s reply »  margin prof vs mdso very similair and sure as hell not worth double ev/rev multiple in same
vertical...vs horizontals obviosuly different but then again fraction of their tam


28 Mar 2017, 09:18 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
From 10- k MDSO hat 10.8% op margin. VEEV was not 19% ?


28 Mar 2017, 10:06 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  mdso 20% op cash flow margin vs 26% veev 2016. And mdso was drastically improving
throughout yr...q4 was 26% ebitda...so again not exactly much different and quite impressive when you
consider how easy veev has had it in crm.


28 Mar 2017, 10:33 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
So that is 8 points higher for op margin and 5 points higher for op cash flow margin. Plus there is still 5% higher
revenue growth. Things should really change in the next ER to make the pair trade work as the ev/sales valuation is
not double for VEEV, it is 9.6 versus 5.9 approx.


28 Mar 2017, 12:08 PM

Author’s reply »  152 fully diluted share count times 51 share price -$518ml cash divided by 659 consensus equals
11x ev/2017 est rev. Do same numbers on mdso...$3.2bl mkt cap,-251 net cash, divided by 552 ml 2017 rev
consensus. multiple 5.3x. Veev is 108% premium. And mdso exited last quarter at same ebitda margin profile. This
stuff is public domain. Not rocket science. Veev forecast growth 21%, mdso 19%. And for record veev guide this year
much more likely to be close to actual.


28 Mar 2017, 03:43 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
My number did not reflect yet 51 share price, anyway you get still different numbers because you are using forecast
revenue and generally VEEV beat quite a lot. The hope is that MDSO will keep showing more positive comparison
versus previous quarters and VEEV will slow further but we are waiting since 3 quarters ago while the valuation was
predicted to be very soon equal. 
I got also EV/cashflow with smaller difference.


28 Mar 2017, 04:05 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Using the metric EV/EBITDA the difference is even smaller, 52x VEEV versus 47x MDSO because VEEV has
better margins.

Author’s reply »  This is getting tiresome. SEC.gov...pull 10-ks and do the math. EV/op cash flow...veev 43%
premium to mdso. Furthermore...mdso expanded margin 900bps from q1-q4...based on veev investment
guide...they are roughly equivalent ebitda margin wise now. 26% to like 27-28...and mdso has more room to
expand...remeber veev still encumbered to degree by salesforce fee's on crm...that's still 65% their biz.


31 Mar 2017, 04:31 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
May be MDSO has more room to expand, this is a thesis, but cash flow is one thing, EBITDA is another thing. MDSO
has good cash flow but poor margin, so EV/EBITDA is just a little bit higher for VEEV, not 43% premium, just 10-11%.


31 Mar 2017, 05:33 PM


Suhail Capital, Contributor

Suhail - The more I look in the balance sheet of the last VEEV 10-k and make a comparison with MDSO the more
clear for me that you are wrong. VEEV margins are almost the double compared to MDSO, VEEV is more profitable
for several reasons, including the absence of debt and the minor stock dilution. 
The problem with professional fund managers is that they read financial books and get confused, this is why Einhorn,
Ackman and many others have really poor performance. Fortunately I have a lot better performance like probably you
too have and no need to invest in hedge funds.

Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Lol. Now you are sounding like a crazy person. You 100% can't read financial statements
that has been demonstrated. ev/op cash flow like how fricking hard is it to pull a number right of 10-k and
divide it into the current enterprise value??????? Furthermore how hard is it to read earnings transcripts....

MDSO Q4 TRNASCRIPT: 
"And our unique business model allowed margins to improve consistently every quarter this past year. We
started the year with a 19% EBITDA margin in Q1 and expanded it to 26% in Q4."


VEEV Q4 Transcript: 
"We're anticipating non-GAAP operating income of $180 million to $185 million for the full year, which implies
a non-GAAP operating margin of 27.5% to 28%. This is consistent with the initial full year profit guidance that
we provided on the last call and represents our plans to invest aggressively across the areas of our business"


The sky is red and their ebitda margins are double....


Einhorn and Ackman are billionaires and have been doing this for decades...but yeah you are better than
them because you haven't read a finance book yet somehow can't regurtitate numbers handed to you by
management.


We done with this convo...enough...you are an amazing investor...people who do this professionally are
clueless.


01 Apr 2017, 08:28 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
YOu like to look at op cash flow because it is more favourable to MDSO but there are expenses not factored in op
cash, but you are also wrong in op cash flow margins. 144:544= 26% op cash flow margin for VEEV versus
89:463=19% margin for MDSO. Op margin is even better for VEEV, what really matters are earnings, not cash flow.


01 Apr 2017, 08:16 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
The op margin in Q4 was slightly less than 26%, it was 25.7%, it is improving, but I considered all the year because
Q1 op margin is generally less than Q4. And when you quote VEEV you are referring to a forecast about the future,
they are predicting lower margins. 
Problem is VEEV still has better margins and better growth so the trade is not working, you were at least too early.
You are generally correct but sometimes you are not and when I take the opposite side of your trade (only 10% of the
times really) I am always making money like with HLF.

Author’s reply »  Not even going to bother. You don't get the structural nature of these businesses. They are
same margin profile companies over the long haul. Organically crm bookings will be single digits this year.
You want to pay 40x sales for vault at 125ml sub rate while wday and now have billion plus sub revenue
bases still growing 30%....be our guest. And we made good money on hlf...just because the event didn't work
in options last june doesn't mean we didn't profit nicely.

May be I do not fully get the structural nature of these business, but you were forecasting 9 months ago that
VEEV premium would quickly disappear, 
I explained why this did not happen. 
May be in the future it will happen if Vault growth will slow. I understand that for CRM platform VEEV needs to
pay 50 M every year until 2025.


01 Apr 2017, 03:00 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
If you want to consider only Q4 you have to understand that even VEEV had an improvement in margins in Q4. op
margin for VEEV in Q4 was 30.75% compared to 25.7% for MDSO. Additionally there is 5% more revenue growth. So
you have 5% better margin and 5% more revenue growth.  
VEEV deserves about 25% premium, so it is slightly overvalued but not 100% like you said.


01 Apr 2017, 10:29 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
In the last 8-K forms the non-GAAP operating margin is clearly reported, no need to make complicate
calculation. It was 21.3% for MDSO and 33.3% for VEEV, it is turning even better than I told before.
