Celsion Continues Publishing Meaningless Post-Hoc Data Mined

associated with these stocks.)


Since we began publishing on Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLSN), we have highlighted
the many differences between what Celsion has been telling investors and the depressing
reality of its business.


First, it should be made clear that Celsion's Phase III HEAT trial was a complete failure,
both for the Company and for investors. After 5 years and over $95 million of losses, the
HEAT trial showed that using Thermodox was no different than a placebo as there was no
difference between the treatment and control populations. Investors took a bath.

Yet, in numerous press releases following the failed HEAT trial, Celsion has published
post-hoc results. When it published these results, Celsion chose data from trial
populations that were not pre-specified and are therefore statistically meaningless.
Historically, we have observed that when small biotechs engage in data mining, it is in an
effort to pump up their share prices. Unfortunately for Celsion, none of its post-hoc

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1769272-celsion-continues-publishing-meaningless-post-hoc-data-mined-results 2/9


analysis have been statistically significant. As we've explained in previous articles, post-
hoc analysis should be viewed with extreme skepticism (here). Essentially, post-hoc
analysis allows a company to data-mine for the best possible results. Therefore, it is pretty
shocking that Celsion has done this numerous times and still cannot find results that are
statistically significant.


We believe that every time Celsion publishes statistically insignificant results based on
data mining, they are hoping to get investors excited and to drive up the share price.
Celsion must do this because they need millions of dollars of funding in order to survive
and pursue another costly Phase 3 trial. Over the course of the original Phase 3 HEAT
trial, not only did Celsion burn over $95 million dollars, but they also had to dilute
shareholders more than three times - the share count increased from 10 million shares in
Q1 2008 to over 35 million at the end of 2012. There are over 60 million shares
outstanding today.


Today's Data is Not New


This morning's release of updated post-hoc results was supposed to be incremental;
however, we fail to see how today's press release sheds any new meaningful insight. It's
clear when comparing these results (here) with the previous update from September
(here), that there has been no meaningful change:

The most important point to take away is that the post-hoc analysis continues to fail to
show statistical significance.


Beware of Upcoming Dilution

Comments (30)


As we have written previously (here), Celsion will require significant funding simply to
continue existing operations. Celsion is losing about $4 million to $5 million in operating
income per quarter, which closely approximates cash spend, or about $0.25 per year.
Today's release that Celsion will pursue another Phase III clinical trial only adds to its
financial burden. Shareholders have already been diluted by over 600% over the last 5
years as Celsion has lost over $100 million since the start of the HEAT trial. Investors
today face even more dilution, greater losses, and significant clinical trial risk going
forward. If the Company spends a similar amount on its second Thermodox trial, it will
most likely need to raise another $50 million. At the current share price, this would entail
over 60% dilution to current shareholders. Investors in Celsion who have taken a bath on
Celsion shares should see past their shenanigans. You know, fool me once…


We remain short Celsion's stock and our price target remains $0.68 per share.

opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

It is fine to criticize a company for data mining and post-hoc analysis to try to pump up share price. However, not all
data mining is equally specious. In this case, I believe investors should be quite optimistic. Celsion's post-hoc analysis
did not find that patients with blue hair and green eyes who had a procedure on cloudy days did great vs. all other
patients. Instead, in effect, their Phase 3 should be viewed as a dose finding study, which is very common in the
pharmaceutical industry. The statin drugs, like Zocor and Lipitor, were multibillion dollar drugs in their prime very much
because of dose-finding studies that linked increases in mortality to specific doses of these drugs. These studies were
published in journals such as Lancet. Here, Celsion found that dwell time affects outcomes--45 minutes or more with
ThermoDox has a clear benefit vs. procedure with a lower dwell time. Clinically, dwell time is equivalent to finding the
right dose of a drug. This is a perfectly plausible and scientifically sound conclusion and not at all specious. The
company can be blamed for not doing a Phase 2 that may have borne this out. Finally, you continue waving the "not
statistically significant" banner. But OS has not reached the median point and the p value now is .056--literally one or
two patients away from significance and it has been getting closer with time. The company stated previously that the
projection is that the median will be reached in about two quarters. Do you really believe this is a specious, desperate
attempt to find something to boost stock price only? Why not give them a break and admit that there post-hoc analysis
is quite sound scientifically?

The word "increases" should be "decreases" in this comment with respect to the statin drugs. Apologies for
the error, although the point is still the same.

Author’s reply »  Yes - I really believe that this company is trying to manipulate its stock up to raise more
money and pursue a doomed second HEAT trial. I think this stock is worth at best the cash on hand (and
probably less because they're burning cash).

I would be careful not say that "out of hand" any future trial would or will fail. I, for one, don't think another try
at this is categorically "doomed."


In my opinion, it's worthwhile science, and I wish they had gotten it right the first time. And don't forget, the
FDA is involved with the trial design too, so part of the P3 failure rests with them.


Having said that, I'm growing increasingly skeptic of Celsion management. I see a pattern of repackaging old
news as "new," and offering very little to chew on otherwise. Their communication has been less-than-stellar.
Perhaps it is this style which has allowed them take advantage of capital markets (e.g. shareholders).


We'll know a lot more by end-of-year, when presumably the FDA will be working with Celsion. Hisun, China,
and the Pacific Rim countries remain the biggest short-term wildcard and potential catalyst.

You are entitled to your opinion, of course. But can you address directly my contention that their post-hoc
analysis is scientifically sound and equivalent to dose-finding studies with pharmaceuticals. You are aware
that p=.056 is truly just a few patients away from statistical significance. Assuming that significance is
achieved with OS in the next several months--a highly plausible assumption given the science behind
ThermoDox, RFA dwell time, and how the data has been trending, do you not agree that there will be an
expedited approval process? I certainly do. The reasons for being long on this stock are much stronger than
before the Phase3 began.


24 Oct 2013, 04:33 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I disagree with you. I don't think it matters what the p-value of their data mining shows.
Regardless of the outcome, the company will need to run another phase 3 trial and we will not know results
for 4+ years. I expect that trial to fail as well.

Biotech investing is always flipping a coin. You may be right though Alpha the trial might fail again, yet it may
work for other indications. Although if you are just going to go in short term at this low price, then maybe you
can ride it up again before any results are released. Anyways from the DD I have done on CLSN I wouldn't go
near it IMO!

In all of your writings, you consistently say that a follow-on trial will fail. (You say this over, and over, like a
broken record.) If the FDA felt the same, wouldn't they be compelled not to let the company do another trial?


Despite indicating that you believe any/all follow-on trials will fail, you never a SINGLE time indicate "why" you
think it will fail.


Can you please elucidate your reason(s) why you believe ANY follow-on trial will fail? Silence is acceptance.

I agree with you. The author's criticisms of this company are more emotional than rational. I suspect he got
badly burned when the stock tanked when it did not meet the primary endpoint. He never addresses the
scientific soundness/plausibility of the dwell time variable (45 minutes or more). That is because he cannot.

It's not that he can't. He's actually pretty intelligent.


But he is a paid "sell-side" analyst, so he just chooses NOT to.


And because of that, his opinion is intractable (he won't change positions). EOM.

From the article: "The most important point to take away is that the post-hoc analysis continues to fail to show
statistical significance."


From this comment: "I don't think it matters what the p-value of their data mining shows."


Haven't made up your mind or worried that the next release will actually show statistical significance? Very
possible since (from the press release), "The median in this subgroup has not been reached."


Have you noticed that as the additional data is coming in, the subgroup keeps getting validated? Note that the
additional data is coming in after the subgroup was already defined, so it is rather meaningful. Combined with
the larger size of the subgroup, the impressive hazard ratio, the almost significant p-value, and the natural

definition for the subgroup (based on "dosing"), chances are ThermoDox works under some conditions. This
bodes well for any follow ups to this study and for other studies already in progress.

Author’s reply »  The HR was aprox 1 the first time around so for a new trial to succeed you need to look at
type 1 error = 5% chance of success. I'll bet on the 95% chance. Hence I say the next trial fails.


27 Oct 2013, 08:44 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  There is no scientific basis for dwell times. It's just post hoc BS. We know that because the
trial was not prospectively randomized for this and because the company has posted slides in the past
showing the Dox is released within ~ 15 minutes. IMO this company is just a scam and is releasing old news
over and over to support its stock so it can raise more money.


27 Oct 2013, 08:47 PM


Legib
There certainly is a scientific basis for dwell time. Higher dwell time equals higher concenration not only in the
abalation zone but also the "thermal zone" which is the zone beyond what abalation can reach and where
micrometastases occurs. You also never mention that the average dwell time in the Ph1 study was 2 hours.
Yes, 2 hours. Finally, please get infusion time, release time, and dwell time straight. Dox is not released in
~15 minutes as you incorrectly state. It is released quickly, within seconds (30 seconds +/-). The 15 minutes
you refer to is the infusion time of TDox prior to RFA. So "release" is quite rapid. What matters after release of
free dox from liposomal dox (occurs in seconds) is dwell time to allow sufficient concentration of free Dox in
tissue and surrounding area--beyond what RF ablation can reach alone. This is why dwell time matters and is
quite sound scientifically, as simulation and recent animal studies have shown. As I noted before, dwell time
should be looked at as a dose of heat (beyond just ablation) and the Ph 3 trial found that the right dose for the
best effect is 45 minutes or greater. This is not specious and is actually common in drug studies that seek to
find the best dose of a drug. The company did NOT stipulate dwell time in the study design. Since the
average dwell time in their Ph1 was 2 hours, they were likely surprised that some operators did RFA for less
than an hour. But most did apply heat for 45 minutes or more, which tells you something. Again, OS based on
dwell time is just a few patients away from stat signif, as you are well aware

Note: This is for careful observers of the technology and delivery platform.


Most of the TDox is released from its Liposomal encapsulation within the first 15 minutes. Check.


Premise: Increased RF ablation time keeps the vascular pathways (e.g. blood vessels) to the cancer cells
open for a longer period of time, allowing TDox more and better access to them in order to kill them. (Silence

The FDA will either agree or disagree with this premise by the end of the year. At which time, your opinion will
either be confirmed or denied by professionals who far exceed your biotechnology experience and pay grade.


If the FDA agrees with this premise, then you'll see the new trial begin in 2014. (Note: this has nothing to do
with the stock price, dilution, or other financials, but everything about trying to find a better treatment option
for liver cancer.) EOM.

Critics of p-values point out that the criterion used to decide "statistical significance" is based on an arbitrary
choice of level (often set at 0.05).[18] If significance testing is applied to hypotheses that are known to be
false in advance, a non-significant result will simply reflect an insufficient sample size; a p-value depends only
on the information obtained from a given experiment. 
The p-value is incompatible with the likelihood principle, and p-value depends on the experiment design, or
equivalently on the test statistic in question. That is, the definition of "more extreme" data depends on the
sampling methodology adopted by the investigator;[19] for example, the situation in which the investigator
flips the coin 100 times yielding 50 heads has a set of extreme data that is different from the situation in which
the investigator continues to flip the coin until 50 heads are achieved yielding 100 flips.[20] This is to be
expected, as the experiments are different experiments, and the sample spaces and the probability
distributions for the outcomes are different even though the observed data (50 heads out of 100 flips) are the
same for the two experiments. 
Some regard the p-value as the main result of statistical significance testing, rather than the acceptance or
rejection of the null hypothesis at a pre-prescribed significance level. Fisher proposed p as an informal
measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. He called on researchers to combine p in the mind with
other types of evidence for and against that hypothesis, such as the a priori plausibility of the hypothesis and
the relative strengths of results from previous studies.[21] 
Many misunderstandings concerning p arise because statistics classes and instructional materials ignore or
at least do not emphasize the role of prior evidence in interpreting p. A renewed emphasis on prior evidence
could encourage researchers to place p in the proper context, evaluating a hypothesis by weighing p together
with all the other evidence about the hypothesis.[1]
