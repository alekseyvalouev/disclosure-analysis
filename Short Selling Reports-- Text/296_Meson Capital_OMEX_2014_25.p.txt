Odyssey Preps Excuses For Oceanica Failure, Looks To Recycle Old
Projects, Dilute

Summary


Nov 4: OMEX placed a paid insert into a Mexican newspaper formatted deceptively
to resemble an actual article: called local Fishing Coops and journalists criminals for
opposing mining project.


Nov 5 Oceanica public consultation had over 350 protesters despite sneaky last
minute date shift; another less complex Baja mine proposal just withdrew after failing
to receive environmental approval.


Rumors circulating that OMEX about to announce “new” HMS Gloucester project
which sank slowly in only 35 feet of water, recorded eye witness accounts treasure
was removed prior to sinking.


Neptune Minerals appears to be shuttered, phones no longer active. SSCA still stuck
in court with no cash received yet. Admiral Balchen descendants state “No
evidence” of treasure aboard Victory.


Expect a bankruptcy filing or another dilutive capital raise from OMEX, shortly.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) appears to have now shifted gears into
damage control mode with its unprecedented offshore phosphate mine project, Don Diego
/ Oceanica in Mexico. In a remarkable show of desperation and disrespect for the
environmental approval process, on Nov 4th, the day before the Nov 5th public
environmental consultation, the company took out a PAID INSERT (advertisement) in the
regional Mexican newspaper Sudcaliforniano.

Photos from Nov 5th public consultation: source


We will not rehash the past opposition we have highlighted in the past by Senators, the
Mayor, and economically important fishing cooperatives. The public consultation held on
Nov 5th was a chance for the company - specially Daniel de Narváez, a founding member
of DNA, OMEX's partner in Oceanica - to present their case to the public and hear the
public's feedback. This is an important step to gather public feedback along the approval
process for SEMARNAT, the Mexican environmental regulator. Oceanica was quite sneaky
in that they originally scheduled the event for October 30th but was shifted by a week at
the last minute to coincide with a heavily popular environmental conference, Green
Solutions on Nov 5-6.

According to a local news article (translated via Google):


The meeting lasted 10 hours with over 350 people estimated present. Attendees
included leaders of the fishing coops, the Advisory Council for Sustainable
Development, local MPs, and Mayor or Comondu Venustiano Perez Sanchez. There
were 30 papers presented indicating environmental damage that would be caused
by the project. These will be considered by SEMARNAT which has 60 working days
to make a conclusion on whether to grant a permit or not.


We will neglect to go into depth here about the scientific objections raised by the
protesters but they include items such as:


· Toxic heavy metals in the sediment generated by the extraction process, including
radioactive uranium - including the plume that does not settle and would last for 50 years
in the water


· The removal of nutrients that are key to the phytoplankton base of the marine food chain


· Acoustic damage on marine mammals, including whales, from the extremely loud
dredging equipment - highlighting that the EIA did not investigate spectral content,
exposure time and temporal structure of the noise


We will continue to update shareholders as more information becomes available but we
have yet to learn of any positive support for the project from locals (excluding paid
advertisements by OMEX attempting to resemble this). At a minimum it appears much
more in depth scientific study with the corresponding expense will be needed.


Other, more conventional Baja mine throws in the towel after local opposition

For some context on how difficult the approval process is, another local mine in Baja
recently withdrew its approval process after being repeatedly blocked. The Los Cardones
gold mine would have used proven existing mining techniques in contrast to Don Diego's
unprecedented undersea phosphate mining which has never been done anywhere in the
world before commercially. In spite of this, the project was killed by local opposition. The
key reason was simply because the main economy in the area is tourism.


Where Does OMEX Go From Here? Recycle Old Projects as New?


As Odyssey stumbles towards another dilutive capital raise, rumors have been resurfacing
among investors that Odyssey may announce a new HMS Gloucester project which could
have treasure aboard. Extensive archaeological research indicates Gloucester has no

treasure on it and sank in just 35 feet of water (anyone can dive this deep with a 2 day
SCUBA course) in a well-known location with hundreds of people watching. Multiple eye
witness accounts also show the Duke took all his (and probably his entourages) valuables
with him in a giant strong box off the boat before it sank. I believe long time OMEX
investors are aware of the unviable Gloucester and if OMEX announced it, would be
poorly received sign of obvious financial desperation.


(Gloucester picture from BBC)


Lastly, in addition to independent Wessex Archaeology's report, the true family of Balchen
indicate "no evidence" of HMS Victory treasure. This is particularly telling given Balchen
family could lay legal claim to 2% of anything valuable found.


Simultaneously, it appears another Odyssey business may have also gone bankrupt. The
management page of Odyssey's "Neptune" project seems to have mysteriously vanished
recently. Phone calls to Neptune's direct number receive no answers and instead go to an
automated, generic voicemail message with no mention of Neptune or anyone at all. At
one point Odyssey management hyped this business "could" be worth over $1b.


HMS Gloucester: Odyssey's "Secret" Years of Involvement, Yet Zero
Announcements….


For anyone following Odyssey over the years, connections between Odyssey and the
alleged HMS Gloucester will not be a surprise. There have been discussion publicly from
people upset about the proposed transfer of Gloucester to Odyssey's questionable
commercial salvage partner, the "Maritime Heritage Foundation" who OMEX also appears
to be running the public relations for. It seems the obvious financially unviable nature of a
Gloucester excavation is clearly why OMEX never announced it as a project despite direct

involvement for over 4 years. It also seem this is also the reason long time OMEX
investors don't even discuss this project anymore: because it is obviously financially
worthless.


From a past UK FOIA we know


"a second group also associated with Odyssey, the still anonymous finders of
the wreck of another sovereign warship, HMS Gloucester."


This same UK FOIA based analysis goes on further to explain Sean Kingsley and his
consultancy Wreck Watch was apparently involved along with the Maritime Heritage
Foundation:


"The only common link is between the two sites is Odyssey/Wreck Watch
International and the presence at the meeting of both the MHF and the Gloucester
group plus Odyssey/Wreck Watch,"


"THE YELLOW BUOY DEBACLE"


Even worse, similar to HMS Victory, it appears OMEX's (or Augership 320's) involvement
seems to have been a direct and primary factor potentially endangering the site itself!

"The report, as might be expected, makes much of the perceived threats to the site
which encompass unstable sediment, fishing and trawling activity, and possible
unauthorized salvage attempts [from individuals alerted by OME [REDACTED]
own activities, and indeed by the bright yellow 5.5 ton marker buoy that
[REDACTED] have placed on the site.]"


Similarly, with the HMS Victory, OMEX publicizing the site by Press Conference, TV
programs and press coverage, apparently resulted in unauthorized excavation by other
commercial divers who pillaged the Victory site. What kind of legitimate archaeology or
salvage group marks any historic site with a bright yellow 5.5 ton buoy!!? This seems to
me like an example of stunning and dangerous incompetence.


The September 13 2011 e-mail continues


"OME are proposing to make further site investigations to photograph and record the
site and to produce a photomosaic. They also wish to recover "fragile surface
artifacts" (such as jugs, bottles and a pewter porringer) and commence conservation
on these. Intriguingly they also wish to carry out trial excavations and recover
(unspecified) material. Those ill-disposed to OME would undoubtedly conclude from
this report that its purpose is to steer the reader to sanctioning a recovery program-
and indeed that the proposal to excavate and recover artifacts is nothing more than
a treasure hunt. [Redacted] think it will be helpful to have DCMS/EH (English
Heritage) cast a professional eye over the report, particularly with regard to the
assessment of value and threat. Personally I am not convinced that this site is under
any more threat than others and probably less than some….


We can deduce OMEX has been aware and involved with this site for years. Tellingly, after
extensive work OMEX has never decided the project was worth publicly discussing
despite public documents demonstrating OMEX, Sean Kingsley and MHF's direct
connections with Gloucester.


HMS Gloucester: All Evidence Indicates Obviously Financially Worthless

As we have heard from OMEX's silence on the topic, HMS Gloucester is obviously
financially worthless. However, for investors that insist on spouting baseless speculations
there could be "secret treasure!" onboard Gloucester, let me explain the top 6 most
obvious reasons there is no treasure aboard Gloucester. If I need to go into more detail
later I can but this project is so obviously worthless I will start with this for now.


Some background on the wreck will help give you context. HMS Gloucester was launched
in 1654 and sank with 60 guns on her the morning of 5/6/1682 while traveling back to Lief,
UK with exiled King James 2 (ie: Duke of York), and some of his entourage, from exile in
Scotland. Gloucester was a third rate speaker class frigate and so was just 35 feet wide,
117 feet long and ~14 feet deep, yet had 330 passengers and 60 large cannons aboard
when she sank. Gloucester ran aground in good weather due to pilot negligence on the
well-known "notorious Lemon and Oar" shoal off Great Yarmouth, not far from the Port of
Lowestof.


(picture credit wrecksite.eu)


Moving on to why HMS Gloucester project is financially worthless and OMEX chose
to never announce it:


1. First, multiple accounts from eye witnesses quote only 5k of total value sank with
HMS Gloucester. This makes sense also because the royalty were likely first to be saved
and the Duke took his enormous strong box off the boat with him and his close entourage

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2665175-odyssey-preps-excuses-for-oceanica-failure-looks-to-recycle-old-projects-dilute 9/45


(from "The Plot Against Pepys")


(from "Christopher Gunman and the Wreck of the Gloucester")


If we optimistically assume that 70% of this 5k value was in pure, recoverable gold or
silver and if we are again wildly optimistic and assume OMEX can find 80% of what went
down with the boat, then give 20% to the UK government, another 20% to whoever the
dealer or retailer is, I estimate this "best case scenario" only leaves ~$6.5m of total
revenue to any commercial treasure hunting company the UK government may choose to
give this to. This is obliviously a tiny fraction of the cost to execute any project, let alone
one with endless tons of sand that would have to be removed over a huge area. Even
using wildly optimistic estimates, there is zero chance this recovery could ever be even
vaguely close to profitable.


2. Second, multiple eye witness accounts saw Duke force his entourage to lower his
giant strong box into his boat when he left the Gloucester. This strong box weight
perhaps as much as 80 men and there are extensive accounts of the timeline and actions
of King James which describe exactly what happened, they all show any treasure the
Duke of York and his entourage may have had with him clearly left the boat when it sank.


Eye witness accounts as 150 passengers died in the water:


"Still the Duke dithered. He fussed over the safety of his strongbox, his priests and his
pugs (Dogs)."


and (from different source):


"The longboat went off with very few in her, though she might have carried off above
eighty more than she did" "it is very certain he was much too anxious to preserve his
strongbox" "upon which the Duke ordered a strong box lifted into the boat, which
beside being very weighty, took up much room and time. My father asked with
some warmth, if there was anything worth a man's life. The duke answered that
there were things of great consequence, both to the king and himself, that he would
hazard his own rather than it should be lost."

And so the safety boat left almost empty of people, which could have carried 80+ more
men, while the Duke ordered people on the board to fend everyone off with swords. While
the rescue boat was clearly lowered past the Duke's cabin so he could get his entourage
and their heavy valuables and strongboxes onto the life boat.


So, from multiple different sources, we know the Duke had his enormous strong box,
weight approximately the same as 80 men, lowered into the boat, while his entourage
joined him. Obviously this was whatever wealth he had on him, as well as that of his
entourage, and we know that it left the boat before it sank. There is no treasure aboard
Gloucester.


3. Third, Gloucester sank in just 35 feet of water in a "notorious" area that was well
known then and now. Gloucester was not a boat that sank in the middle of the ocean at
night in deep water. She sank in broad daylight, in good weather, as part of a flotilla of
many ships among hundreds of people. Everyone knew exactly where she sank, but don't
take my word for it though, read the accounts of people who were actually there:


"an hour after sketchy news of the wreck arrived in Whitehall on Wednesday 10 may, all
London knew the story"


Or just look at the pictures from eye witness accounts below. Note the number of ships
around Gloucester as she sank and the hundreds of people watching. Note the extremely
shallow waters and relative ease of access to the wreck site any modern company would
have.

Remember Gloucester sank with 60 cannons aboard. Any salvage company with interest
could have chartered a boat with basic imaging equipment and found her years ago if
there was any reason to do so. The 35-60 feet she sank in is a depth many people could

do with a snorkel mask from Walmart. While any claims of recreational diving off the coast
in the North Sea sand bars is obviously absurd, anyone with a 2 day PADI SCUBA class
could easily dive to these depths any weekend. To think a "gazillion" dollars of treasure
lays in shallow water in a well known location that anyone with a 2 day PADI SCUBA class
could go and get is so absurd I can't believe anyone would suggest it with a straight face.
Remember the hundreds of companies in the North Sea area working on deep see oil and
gas, each with vastly superior skills for deep water recovery than OMEX will ever hope to
have. To think any one of them never cared to go and dig up some vast fortune laying in
shallow water in their own backyard is ridiculous.


If there was treasure aboard this ship, someone else would have gone and recovered it
decades ago given the ease of the access and obvious location.


4. Fourth, there are no credible historic accounts stating there was treasure aboard
Gloucester. You have to remember how historic the Gloucester was to understand why
this is critical to any claims of treasure. The initial sinking of the Gloucester was
surrounded by conspiracy theories of attempted assasination of the Duke of York and
people were court martialed, jailed, prosecuted. Hundreds of people watched her sink and
this scandal was discussed by the world for many years. There are an unusually detailed
level of records surrounding this boat from court documents and countless letters and
journal entries of the people involved. Not only are there no records of a massive treasure
which sank in the boat, but Duke of York jumped to the support of Christopher Gunman
when he was court martialed, and later the one year of pay he was docked was remited in
entirety. This is not the action of someone who just lost their family's fortune on a shallow
sand bar in good weather.


There is no credible evidence indicating any treasure was aboard Gloucester.


5. Fifth, anyone counting on passenger valuables should know there were other
larger boats with royal members aboard and not on Gloucester. Gloucester's flotilla
had many boats (chapter 23) in their flotilla from the "Mary" including six frigates:
Gloucester, Happy Return, The Lark, the Ruby, the Dartmough, and the Pearl. Then three
more yachts including Katherine, the Charlotte and the Kitchen. When they departed, the
Duke and his close entourage boarded the Gloucester but the rest of his party and all their
luggage on the other frigates from Pepys to many others. It is absurd to assume that, even
if there was some treasure in the flotilla, that it was on the crowded Gloucester. Or if you
are speculating on passenger gold know that royalty would have been saved with priority
and many of them weren't on Gloucester to begin with. Of the Gloucester's 330
passengers, 250 of them were normal seamen and passengers, with only 80 of the

remaining nobles and servants of them. That means there were only perhaps 30
nobleman on Gloucester and nearly all of them left the ship with the Duke. There is no
vast trove of royal passenger treasure.


Furthermore, if there were some astonishing amounts of gold sinking with Gloucester I
think it is obvious some sailors may have chosen to get closer to her and recover some of
this "amazing" treasure some claim was on there. It is telling that instead most of the
boats stayed at quite some distance with the closest, The Mary, staying a full ¼ to 1/3 mile
away as Gloucester sank. Eye witnesses claim that when she finally sank, Gloucester
"opened up like a basket" and yet none of the people surrouning her saw any evidence at
all of the vast fortunes inside? What of the 150+ people who were rescued, none of them
had anything to say about the supposed vast sums of silver and gold left on the boat?


6. Sixth, any scraps of passenger belongings on the boat have been swept around
for hundreds of years by thousands of violent storms and mixed with millions of
tons of sand this region is known for. This shole region was so famous for the shifting
sand banks there was a ship ahead of Gloucester helping her navigate the area at the
time she ran aground. Giant shifting sand bars are what this area is famous for and any
valuables that sank on this boat have been mixed into millions of tons of sand over the
past 332 years and are now unrecoverable in any financially viable way.


HMS Gloucester: Potentially A Desperate "Emergency" Project?


Given obviously worthless, not to mention potentially dangerous to archaeological value of
the site, I speculate OMEX has kept this project quiet and would only ever consider

Every long term OMEX follower knows of this Gloucester project and they all ascribe zero
value to it. Those who don't know, have obviously not completed even the most basic due
diligence as public evidence of these connections is easily found in 5 minutes of Google
searching.


This email, made public through FOIA request, is the initial reference about this
connection:


"Not only that, a second group also associated with Odyssey, the still
anonymous finders of the wreck of another sovereign warship, HMS Gloucester, lost
of Great Yarmouth in 1682."

I could expand on this curious connections and various questionable dealings behind the
scenes with HMS Gloucester, financings, the UK government and Sean Kingsley. Instead I
want to offer Marc Gordon and Odyssey this opportunity to explain what is going on
behind the scenes themselves as shareholders deserve the full truth from the source.


Has Odyssey's "Neptune Minerals" Finally Ceased Operations and Gone Bankrupt?


Odyssey previously claimed Neptune minerals was worth over a billion dollars at a Noble
Investor Conference. Now however, Neptune "leadership" page has curiously vanished
with no listed management following their last failed capital raise. Even more alarming,
when I call the listed phone number on the website (727) 897-5541 I find that nobody
answers and after many rings it eventually goes to generic "leave a message at the tone.
Beep." automated voicemail with zero mention of Neptune, no employee name, or any
name at all. Does this sound to you like a company currently in operation, theoretically
worth a billion dollars? The names used to be there a few months ago.


(from Neptune Website 11/8/2014)


Has this business finally gone down in flames permanently? Has their insolvency finally
caused them to cease operations entirely and fire all employees? When will OMEX
management give shareholders an update on this project? If Neptune is finally bankrupt,
why hasn't OMEX shared this development with their shareholders? Now with essentially
every single deep sea mining company and project a financial disaster, how much longer
will OMEX waste precious shareholder capital on this pipe dream?

HMS Victory Debacle: Further Evidence Supports "no treasure" Onboard


As the farcical HMS Victory debacle continues unraveling, multiple research sources
indicate no secret treasure aboard the ship. In addition to Wessex Archaeology analysis,
the meticulous research from the actual family members of HMS Victory Captain (who
could lay legal claim to 2% of any find) also finds "no evidence" of treasure on board HMS
Victory:


"However our researches into the meticulous Royal Navy records of the period, have
shown no such evidence. Nor do our extensive family records, which date far
beyond 1744, make any such assertion. Given that the sums speculated at were
vast and in which Admiral Balchen, would have been entitled to a 2% commission,
for landing the bullion safely, we think there would be some family or Royal Navy
record of this."


Even if there is treasure aboard HMS Victory, it seems OMEX may hit political and legal
road blocks which prevent them from moving forward. The Victory seems to be rapidly
building into an embarrassing international scandal being discussed around the world as
the UK government is trying to sell the rights to a national war grave so foreign
commercial salvors can go rummaging through graves for trinkets to sell. The amount of
mounting unanswered questions could fill another article (and may) but to start I think this
article and this ask critical questions that, confusingly, remain unanswered.


Furthermore, there are sure to be lots of human remains from the many soldiers dead on
this site that OMEX will theoretically rummage through. The ship sank quickly so
presumably lots of men died below the deck and were crushed to death by the cannons.
As a result any recovery of the cannons seems sure to result in rummaging through the
dead body parts of UK soldiers. Odyssey already publicly uncovered remains of dead UK
soldiers on their TV show "treasure quest" and it seems the UK government is not going to
require any independent observer from English Heritage or non-profit archaeological
society to ensure the archaeology side is done in compliance. If Odyssey is a credible
archaeology firm looking to preserve a countries artifacts, where are the detailed reports
and painstaking site analysis from the Spanish Mercedes ship?


Lastly, the entire case behind excavating the HMS Victory seems absurd to me. To claim
an English Warship was carrying some multibillion dollar treasure that is not discussed in
any formal, reputable historic records seems like quite a stretch. But claiming Victory was
carrying money for Dutch merchants based in Lisbon, when the Victory was heading to
the UK is crazy. Any Dutch merchant money claimed to be on Victory would have been

destined for Amsterdam and archaeology experts have told me there were other Dutch
flagged vessels sailing in the same convoy with their ultimate destination of Amsterdam. If
this is true, why on earth would anyone store some massive sum of money on HMS
Victory? The risks, logistics and cost of it make this obviously ridiculous and so the entire
case behind speculative claims of HMS Victory treasure make no sense to me.


These obvious discrepancies and issues are likely why the global pre-eminent expert on
this topic, Nicholas Rodger from Exeter stated it is essentially beyond unlikely there is
some enormous treasure on HMS Victory.


Conclusion: OMEX Stumbling Onward Towards Dilutive Capital Raise


As OMEX slogs onward, ever closer towards another capital raise, I believe it would be
wise for investors considering "possible" Gloucester treasure, or some other ship ("firefly",
SS Republic recycling, etc), to keep the following chart (from my first report) of Odyssey's
past projects in mind.


Go through Odyssey's past 17 consecutive years of failure and you will find nearly -$200m
of shareholder losses, as literally 100% of OMEX's projects have been investor
disappointments with a startling 89.2% of their projects total wipeouts generating $0.000
of revenue (let alone profit[a5] ).

Over 16+ years now, I believe Odyssey has demonstrated a consistent pattern, resulting
in nearly -$200m of losses and constant failure: First a project is announced and then
(curiously) theoretically unrelated media sources spout off absurdly promotional and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2665175-odyssey-preps-excuses-for-oceanica-failure-looks-to-recycle-old-projects-dilute 19/45


unsubstantiated estimates of treasure value. These "estimates" are based on tenuous
connections of "hidden" treasure not well recorded in historic documents due to some
absurd reason. OMEX then sells equity to pay for the project (and management's high-
roller lifestyle). If the project is ever excavated at all, it turns out that these initial estimates
were wildly incorrect and total recovered items are worth a tiny fraction of what was
previously proposed, resulting in losses and cash burn. Wash, Rinse, and Repeat as long
as investors are willing to continuously lose their money and be diluted.


There is a reason why there have been seven other publicly traded underwater salvage
companies like Odyssey, all have gone to $0.


Underwater treasure hunting and exploration is literally "world's worst investment" where
even the "successful" projects lose millions of dollars and wipe investors out completely.
This is why Marc Gordon has publicly announced OMEX will depart from Greg Stemm's
past "impossible long shot" projects, as Greg Stemm's business model has subjected
shareholders to financial apocalypse.


Until OMEX proves they can operate a business model capable of generating consistent
cash flow, I urge investors to beware of an imminent attempted capital raise via PIPE or
convertible note. They appear ready to waste more shareholder money going back to the
SS Central America to take even more images - are there truly no new projects for the
company? Shareholder have been hearing about a "deep pipeline" of approved projects
for years and yet it seems to be the same re-hashed over and over.


Questions for Today's Conference Call:


1. How much will be paid to Greg Stemm as part of his "retirement" bonus?


2. How much equity will you be forced to issue over the next 12 months?


3. What is the current status of your much touted, "commodity shipwreck program" which
we triangulated as likely Nazi German WWII cargo which would be highly difficult to
contract upon?

4. if Gloucester is such an attractive project why have you never announced your
involvement with it over the past 4 years? Why would you even spend any shareholder
time and money working on this obviously financially worthless project?


5. Why have you been unable to bring in a strategic partner with Oceanica over the past
18 months?


6. When will Odyssey provide the Amsterdamische Courant newspaper report original,
and the translation that they have been using for their reports?


7. Does Odyssey interpret the recent approval for the Victory as to allow for the sale of the
artifacts?


8. For the Central America, what is the progress on the Admiralty Arrest appeals. When
do you expect to be able to receive any cash from this project that isn't debt?


9. Have Odyssey define the way they will be paid for the Central America recovery. ie
when the recovery is monetized, will they recoup at 80/20 costs and 45% directly, before
other costs, claims and percentages. or will they receive the 80/20 costs, and the 45% will
paid out of the pool of all of the other costs, claims, and percentages?


10. When does the 60-90 day response time for SEMARNAT begin? Was it SEP 3, when
resubmitted on the SEP 18, or when sent for evaluacion on OCT 30 - or is it Nov 5th when
the public consultation was held?


11. The Technical Report: Revised Assessment referenced in the Oceanica press release
"concludes the measured and indicated phosphorite resources at the Oceanica deposit
now total 327.2 million ore tonnes at 18.5% P O , an increase of 20% over the last
preliminary assessment total of 273.5 million ore tonnes." How many tonnes of material is
estimated needed to be dredged to create the 327M tonnes of concentrate?


12. Of the "327.2 million ore tonnes at 18.5% P O , " referenced, what are the
steps/processes required to make the "phosphate rock concentrate at 28% to 30% P O
with a favorable CaO/P O  ratio of 1.5 to 1.55 and a Minor Element Ratio (MER) of 0.07 to
0.08. " referenced?


13. The same question for the "chemical analysis suggests that the concentrate would be
suitable for the production of phosphoric acid using the wet process methods." referenced.

In an obvious attempt to deceive the public, this paid advertisement was constructed
attempting to make it look like an actual journalist's article interviewing an attorney who is
working for Oceanica. To be absolutely clear this is in fact a paid insert: the "article"
cannot be found on the newspaper's website, there is no journalist listed as the interviewer
or author, the fonts are clearly different than the regular articles, and another local news
source also says it was a paid insert. We called the newspaper who confirmed it was
indeed a paid insert and that it would cost 16k pesos to put one like it in the paper (or 8k
for black and white only).


In OMEX's deceptive advertisement, their attorney was compensated to state that there
was a criminal conspiracy involving the Puerto Chale fishing co-op, which is a major
contributor to the economy in the Baja area, as well as journalists who have covered
Puerto Chale's opposition materials and congregations. The purpose of the insert appears
to be to undermine the environmental permitting process and discredit the key opposition

This is a very important piece of information from the article referenced:


"Fleet DCS wrote to Lord Lingfield on 7 February 2012: 
The VICTORY wreck site certainly comprises a wide area and for archaeological purposes has to be viewed
holistically. While the site may contain a mixture of Crown and ‘personal’ artefacts, you will understand that we would
not be willing to sanction a search for the latter which would cause detriment to the site. In practice therefore, the site
has to be treated as one and I know you recognize that both HMG and the Foundation will need to ensure that any
action taken in respect of it is consistent with the provisions of the “Rules to the Annex” of the UNESCO Convention. 
Finally, I am not convinced that the concept of “trade goods” is applicable in the case of the HMS VICTORY and her
cargo. The ship, a warship of the Royal Navy, was lost while returning from a naval mission to relieve the French
blockade of British ships in the River Targus in Portugal. We are thus firmly of the view that the ship, at the time of her
loss, was operating on Government non-commercial service. 
It is I suppose possible-though as you are aware, we believe the possibility is remote-that the ship was carrying
private consignments of goods, but this would have been in accordance with the practice of the time, whereby the
provision of protection and safe passage to the property of private citizens was a recognized military function of the
Royal Navy, particularly in times of war."

By any chance have you read the recent Quarterly statement? Accounts payable and accrued expenses are
typically on a 6 month schedule, and those amounts have been near the $6M-$7M for 2 Q's now.


Should they even attempt to begin a new recovery, there appears to be little chance of financing even the fuel
costs.


Current operations are financed from loans, not only operational loans for a project recovery, but loans on
basic equipment.


It is very probable, that due to the timeframe of the Central America monetization, those recovery proceeds
will be administered through the receiver.


11 Nov 2014, 06:34 AM


Rory Duncan
And I am afraid it is. How would you know the current working capital cycle at Odyssey? Are you familiar with
the company's vendors and those vendors' policies on receivables? Are you familiar with specific
arrangements that Odyssey may have with those vendors?


With $5mn of the marketing loan, plus cash on hand, the company has room through February. The judge will
make the decision on title in the CA case in the next few weeks and then CA monetization can take place. If
they are monetizing in one deal, it could happen very quickly after the title decision is made.


We know you think the company is going bankrupt. You've been saying it for over a year. You've said it until
you were blue in the face. The only problem is that you've been wrong all along, and you'll be wrong again.


14 Nov 2014, 03:44 PM


26922203
I am not sure why anyone finds anything positive regarding the Q or the CC. Relevant questions on the funding
mechanism and monetization for the Victory were veiled under NDA claims. ANY sort of monetization is encumbered
by GALT.


Gordon finally admits that the Admiralty Arrest for the Central America is in peril. What happened with only working on
projects where legal issues have been resolved? There is a good chance the Admiralty Arrest will be appealed. What
will happen with the recovery is unknown under those circumstances, but now Gordon alludes to a plan B to be paid
expenses. How does that fare with the $10M Fifth Third loan and the new $10M loan on the recovery remains to be
seen. That will be a margin call to be very concerned about.


What you may have noticed is that with the latest loan (@8%-11%!), anything of value has been encumbered. The
OE, ROVs, all of the equipment is encumbered, shares of Oceanica are encumbered, and the part of the Central
America not already encumbered, is now encumbered. A sign of prosperity? That's right, of potential.


Oceanica. From the CC, it appears that no one from management was at the public meeting? That is how the
company management deals with the only active project they have, and with so much alleged potential, and basically
any hope of making it to the end of the year are riding on?  
There were many papers presented from different groups and agencies, and information that countered almost every
aspect of the EIS (please Odyssey, it is not an EIA, it is an EIS.) Somehow, Gordon can only report that the people

thought it went well?  
It was rather humorous that Gordon said the the people who were seated sat and listened respectfully. What about
the protesters with signs and banners standing at the front, or the ones outside protesting? It is disconcerting and tell
tale when the images of protesters are shown in this article, and then the issue obfuscated by management.


Cash at the end of September was a mere $3.7M. It appears they have drawn $2.5M more, with another $2.5M
available. For illustration, that is a max of $8.7M cash available. The cash burn rate that was illustrated of $2.6M per
month. That alone only gets them to the end of December. 
In addition, there is $3.8M in accounts payable, and $3.2M in accrued expenses. 
and, $500K is due on the 5th 3rd loan by Dec 31. 
Interest dues on all of the loans is approximately $100K per month.


How is anything going to get paid, even as soon as 2 weeks?


Total assets of $27.3M include $6.4M accounts receivable for the Central America. RLP, a company in Bankruptcy
Court owes OMEX this amount. Should the Admiralty Arrest not go their way, there are no assets to pay this money.  
There is currently $19.4M in short term debt, and a total of $32M in total debt.


Way down near the bottom of the page is an interesting amount, Non controlling interest. Another $5.4M shows up
there. Now one gets an idea of just how much money is being spent on Oceanica in just 3 months. Yet another item
missing from the amount of money need to get through to the rest of the year. MAKO, owner of about 45% of
Oceanica, are they funding their share of these expenses? It appears that Odyssey is now about $25M upside down
on Oceanica.

You continue to ignore my simple question at every turn. Explain to me after you rode this down from 3 bucks to sub a
dollar what common sense does it make to not close out your short. The risk/ reward is more on the chance it will go
up then bankrupt. You originally made a good call but if you are still holding short at this level your judgement should
be questioned.

There is significant evidence they are bankrupt.  
There is no evidence of upside, other than hope.

Chatham Rock Likely to be Approved 
.


Chatham issued draft "conditions" today for its undersea phosphate mining concession off the coast of New Zealand.
The issuance of conditions indicates that the Decision Making Committee is likely to approve the mine with conditions,
as these conditions were developed in conjunction with scientists from the opposition. Chatham noted that the most
significant areas where experts have agreed include:  
1) The area is not important for commercial fishing and CRP activities will have either no or negligible impacts on fish
stocks 
2) There are no concerns about radiological effects 
3) Environmental impacts are almost entirely confined to the immediate mining area .


Those who have done serious due diligence on the Oceanica project already understood that experts would agree on
the above points with respect to this project as well. This explains the lack of serious objections to Oceanica from
respected NGO's such as Cemda. Importantly, Oceanica is in a less environmentally sensitive part of the ocean than
CRP's project (which lies in a Benthic Protected Area), and is more commercially attractive given the shallower
location, and the more concentrated rock distribution (CRP's only goes 30cm deep).


Chatham decision expected Dec 18th.


Good news for Chatham and for Oceanica. Less

CEMDA states it is reviewing the submittal and has not commented to date. I would not consider a lack of
comment as a lack of objection.

As noted on the New Zealand website, a similar project has been rejected.


Appeal lodged by TTR with High Court


Trans-Tasman Resources Ltd lodged an appeal on 8 July 2014 with the High Court in Wellington of the EPA’s
decision to refuse their marine consent application under the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf
(Environmental Effects) Act 2012.


For Chatham:


This was just filed on the 22nd of October. This does not appear to be any where near any sort of approval.

CEMDA has had the EIA for over 2 months. I would consider a lack of comment a good thing, as they are a
very, very vocal group.


You cannot compare Trans Tasman and Chatham, fwiw. You know that. Too many differences to list. How is it
a "similar" project? Just because they are both seabed projects? Dubious. Granted, it doesn't mean that
Chatham will get approved either, but not similar.


12 Nov 2014, 03:05 PM


26922203
Context. My response was to the post regarding the Chatham Phosphate project, and the potential for good
news regarding Oceanica.


The projects are very similar in the method of recovery, and the Chatham project is phosphate as well.


The comments show in the NZ EPA report are very relevant to Oceanica, as the material and environmental
issues are very similar.


CEMDA references 2 studies they have called for "In this sense, we call for the academic and research
institutions and the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur and the Center for Biological Research of
the Northwest to study the impacts that could build the project to the region "Agustín Bravo Gaxiola ended
coordinator of Cemda in the northwest."


I am sure this will take some time.


12 Nov 2014, 03:34 PM


OilnandGas2000
Regarding context: If you're going to compare projects all over the world and NGO reactions, you should try to
compare various CEMDA reactions, comments and requests from several other projects versus their
"demands" for the Oceanica one. I bet you will see there was vociferous opposition to many other projects
that CEMDA was against, which subsequently got dinged or at least delayed. CEMDA hasn't commented in
over two months, and the above quote/request seems extremely innocuous and, I believe, quite old.
Nevertheless, it is SEMARNAT who calls the shots, even if CEMDA has a lot of pull with these projects.
Calling for an academic study can be done in parallel with a project, and not necessarily derail or delay it. 
I have no edge in the process, but spinning the above quote as negative is speculative at best. 
FWIW, I entered a question online during the earnings CC regarding when they expect a SEMARNAT
decision; they didn't get to it during the Q&A session, but Liz Shows sent me an email the next morning (to my
surprise ) with the answer: "before year end." So..we will know relatively soon how this plays out.

26922203
The first demand from CEMDA was already granted. The project was submitted protection, which means that
Odyssey was trying to get the project approved without public access to the information or public comment
period. 
That was granted and the project was moved into the public realm. 
There was significant comment already on the information in the EIS as well, especially at the public meeting.
Odyssey did not bring up who presented at the meeting, didn't even go to the meeting, nor provide what
Odyssey presented in the meeting.  
Why is the public meeting not on the Odyssey website with all of the other public meetings? Odyssey did not
even inform shareholders there was a public meeting. It was after all, open to the public, so once again,
everyone has access to the information except the Odyssey shareholders. 
The Oceanica assay findings are posted on the website, why not the presentation made by Odyssey and
others?


13 Nov 2014, 03:40 PM


Rory Duncan
Perhaps you're not aware, but the EPA was positively fried at the public hearings on Chatham. The EPA reps
who wrote the report you linked don't know the first thing about phosphate and you can see it for yourself if
you read the transcripst. They were almost laughed out of the hearing. One of them had authored a
Greenpeace petition. They were about as objective as Ryan Morris.


Luckily for Chatham, the EPA doesn't make the decision on the consent. It's a special committee of experts
that are authorized.


BTW, why would CEMDA wait until the last minute to raise loud objection to Oceanica? You keep telling us
that it's coming but it never seems to arrive. In the past CEMDA has acted early as this gives them a better
chance at stopping projects. Don't really follow your logic.


14 Nov 2014, 03:54 PM


Rory Duncan
You don't make a lot of sense, "It was after all, open to the public, so once again, everyone has access to the
information except the Odyssey shareholders." Are you implying that Odyssey shareholders are not members
of "the public"?


Why would a public company want to draw attention to an environmental hearing? There's no upside from
doing so. As shareholder's we want that meeting to be low key. In any regard, the strategy worked. The
meeting was a success. There weren't any big NGO's there making noise which says a lot. Semarnat doesn't
care if 20 locals show up or 2000 show up, they care about the facts and the science. It appears that the facts
and science in the application stood up well.

Meson,


It looks to me, from the translation, that BCS Noticias is distancing itself from Carlos Iberra, as one of their
points is that Carlos is NOT employed by BCS:

relationship, "


12 Nov 2014, 08:39 PM


26922203
gas, 
Why is it that is all that you were able to absorb from that article?


BCS stood firmly behind themselves and the reporter, content and allegations of receiving bribes.


The attorney actually references a post on the OMEX message board, by an anonymous poster, as proof of
bribes being paid?


Should not your main concern be why are there paid advertisements, and now a front page advertisement?


Why such a response, to pay for space in a newspaper with allegations?


Who is trying to influence whom?


BCS offered to provide articles relating to factual information, and stated if it had been provided the
opportunity by OE, they would have allowed for the balancing points, yet this was never afforded to them,
simply a blind sided, albeit inflammatory allegation in a paid article?


On the surface, this appears to be extraordinarily desperate, why is that?

CaptTurbo - They are not covering their shorts because now they cannot. There are too many shares sold
short. Average daily volume is under half a million shares. With a steady 19.5 million shares sold short, it
would take more than 39 trading days, provided there were no new buyers. As soon as they start to cover, the
price will rise. Once the price rise begins, new buyers will jump in. The shorts have missed their chance.
Another positive announcement by OMEX, and the fun should start.


13 Nov 2014, 09:05 PM


Rory Duncan
Yes, like the factual information they published when they accused the company of violating semarnat rules,
when those rules clearly indicated that Oceanica had not violated them? Or saying that Oceanica had only
taken surface samples? Or that the company's representatives were cancelling meetings? You can
understand why BCS is suddenly very concerned and is making public announcements attesting to its
"innocence."


14 Nov 2014, 04:03 PM


26922203
Did you read the Company information? It was Odyssey themselves that stated they could only do surface
samples, and said they were purchasing a special drill to be able to get deeper.  
The vessel with that drill, the Dorado Discovery, was returned to the owner with the drill.


BCS is making public announcements attesting to its innocence as a result of the paid advertisements
alleging they are under investigation for a number of charges.


They refuted the allegations, and also stated they were not going to be intimidated and will continue to report
on the issues.


16 Nov 2014, 04:14 AM


Rory Duncan
I've read plenty of company information that said "However, the report does not yet include an evaluation of
the entire deposit, rather only data derived from 199 drill holes, which have been tested and analyzed to date.
This compares to 161 drill holes previously analyzed."


Notice the words, "drill holes" which is distinct from surface samples. Notice too that "cores" were tested by
the laboratory. I don't know if you know anything about the industry, but cores refer to cylindrical samples that
are brought to the surface when drilling in a substance.


BCS didn't refute anything. They're implicated, but they certainly aren't the party most in the crosshairs. That
would be Morris and Arturo.


BTW, the second was a front page article. Not a paid advertisement.

Per chance, did you read the EIS? Yes or No?


Core samples were taken by the push probe on the ROV, as well as a drop probe.


From August 8, 2013 Before they purchased the drill.


"We're also continuing to develop our portfolio of mineral exploration projects. The hundreds of core samples
taken from the seabed and analyzed to date continue to suggest that the Oceanica deposit is a world-class
mineral resource in terms of size and market value. Further core samples gathered in the concession area
are currently being processed and we look forward to sharing more information about Oceanica when
sufficient data is collected and analyzed to provide a clear picture of the potential value and commercial
viability of the deposit."


The drill was purchased in 1Q, 2014, and there is nothing stated by Odyssey that it was ever used.

It has already been acknowledged by several sources that it was paid for. What is your proof that it was not
paid? Provide the proof.


GR, you are the one who reported, albeit on a different site, the first paid advertisement as fact, that there
was a criminal investigation. You never stated in your article that the report of a criminal investigation was
paid for by Odyssey.


Here is what you stated in your article: 
"This news is likely to have an impact both on OMEX's business and its stock. As far as Oceanica goes, Ryan
Morris has let it be known in a number of forums, that opposition to Oceanica will make a strong showing at
the environmental hearings (scheduled for tomorrow) in Mexico. If that opposition involves the Puerto Chale
group, anticipated criminal charges may temper the robust presence that Morris may have sought. "


It appears to the reader that you anticipated criminal charges would quash opposition?


You posted this the same time the article came out, and the day before the Public Meeting. Why dont you
explain how you came to the information that was going to be published, and why you wrote what you did.


Why didn't you report that on Seeking Alpha, along with all of your other articles and posts regarding
Odyssey?


You reported that article as fact, when it is generally acknowledged it was a paid advertisement. Your intent
has been jaded, therefore you have little credibility to stand on.


Provide factual evidence for all of your posts.

Yes, of course, as always, you have an article ready, and simply happen to find a paid advertisement in an
obscure Mexican newspaper to write about.


Do you per chance know a poster on the OMEX Yahoo message board named Murphy8275? 
That poster tells a much different version of your involvement. It appears he/she is posting that he/she notified
you of the Mexican attorney and of the details. The posts are easy to look for on that message board.


Is Murphy8275 simply making that up?

"Why is it that is all that you were able to absorb from that article?" 
Really? Because the rest is just noise and the blog (editor) is clearly trying to do a classic CYA. This response by the
blog editor is not surprising at all in that he is defending the "paper" yet putting distance between him, the paper and
the journalist that may be charged! I would expect an organization like SA to do the same thing if one of their
contributors were implicated in something nefarious that could jeopardize the website/blog. 
Also, please explain why paying for space in a newspaper to tell the public that a company is taking action against
those who they believe are acting illegally and unethically is wrong? It's perfectly legal apparently, so take it up with
the newspaper. 
Regarding who is guilty and who isn't, I have no idea, and I haven't a clue how the Mexican legal system works. I still
believe this lawsuit is just a sideshow, and will not influence SEMARNAT either way.

research indicates Gloucester has no treasure on it and sank in just 35 feet of water (anyone can dive this deep with a

Correction: I took a 30 minute SCUBA course and then went down 80'


Secondly, although Semanart expects to have a decision by year end, this is Mexico (I live here) and one November
when I was already 6 months overdue getting a Semanart ruling, the government ran out of money, stopped paying
the electric bills and the workers and 10 months later we got our ruling.


The point of story one was to humor the assemblage. (Where's Papaoomowmow when we need him.)


The point of story two was to show that time is perceived differently down here so temper your timeline expectations.
On the other hand, the Mexican government is quite anxious to generate some phosphate.

convicted Mexican felons? OMEX didn't post the article; it was Oceanica. If the Mexican prosecutor doesn't
press criminal charges, then you can rail against Oceanica for their methods; on the other hand, if charges
are pressed, then, well…I admit: I have NO IDEA what happens! I realize you are implicated in this and that

Odyssey is Oceanica.  
I believe it was a very foolish idea to place the ads, make the allegations, and veil legal action against anyone
who would oppose the project.


A potential strategic partner would be watching how the environmental process is going, and how Odyssey is
handling the process. The potential partner doesn't see any paid ads promoting the benefits of the project, all
they see is potential slander and libel associated with those ads.


It is no wonder that there are to date, no strategic partnerships, no mining companies invested, just paid
consultants.


14 Nov 2014, 04:35 PM


OilnandGas2000
How would there be a strategic partnership this early in the process before environmental approval?
Oceanica is a very new endeavor. Mining companies won't invest until after any environmental license. Why
would you think otherwise? They didn't need a JV or partner to prove the resource or do the scientific work.
They will need one if and when they get a green light (or they could just sell the whole thing), but there is no

need for a partner now. Implying the project isn't viable because there is no major mining partner involved at
this point just shows that you are under or misinformed. 
Regarding the allegations: if the prosecutor picks up the case, if you will, then the allegations will be real and
serious. We can all circle back to this conversation if and when that happens.


14 Nov 2014, 08:12 PM


26922203
Odyssey didn't need a JV partner? Exactly who owns over 40% of Oceanica? MAKO.


You say mining companies wont invest until after environmental license?


Look up Nautilus Minerals, you know, the undersea mining company:


Significant Shareholders:


Mawarid Mining LLC 28.14% http://www.mawarid.me


Metalloinvest Holding (Cyprus) Limited 20.89% http://bit.ly/1wC8DOs


Anglo American plc 5.99% http://bit.ly/1wC8GcX


For reference, these companies have invested over $500 MILLION in Nautilus.


The EIS stated that $350M was required to start the mining operation. Where is that going to come from. This
entire operation, with the method of producing concentrate is unproven and has never been constructed.


To date, there is not been any information, even in the EIS, on how much excavated material is required to
produce the 327M tonnes of concentrate listed. That is very typical in any mining operation report, why is it
missing from this one?


15 Nov 2014, 12:14 AM


bulldog2014
Sigh… Anglo invested in Nautilus about a year after they IPO'd in 2006 and Usmanov (Mettalo) in 2008 for
"investment purposes only:"


"In April 2008, Metalloinvest acquired shares from its subsidiary Gazmetall (qv) “for investment purposes
only” in the leading sea bed copper and gold “massive sulphide deposits” exploration company Nautilus
Minerals Inc [Gazmetall statement, 20 August 2008] which is operating offshore of Papua New Guinea."


Moreover, Mako is an investor not a mining partner and they own about 25% not 40%. 
SO… Oceanica project is much less capital intensive on the exploration side than SMS mining (Nautilus) and
they have already accomplished proving out a resource and completing an EIA with their available funds. A
green light by SEMARNAT would, indeed, require a future partner (to dredge (Boskalis?)and process mid and
downstream (Mosaic? Agrium? Pemex??).


Ok, Brian?

OilnandGas2000
Correct, Bulldog. 
Why would Oceanica need a mining JV so early in the process at a low valuation ,pre -assay NI43-01 and,
eventually, environmental approval. IF SEMARNAT grants approval, then a mining partner can buy in at a
valuation that is multiples of where Oceanica was 12 months ago.


Regarding the "excavated material:" that is just chasing ghosts. There is very little overburden. This is not an
open pit mine.


15 Nov 2014, 04:51 PM


mykiemon
Mykiemon, 
May I ask what was the SEMARNAT decision you were waiting for, and what size project?


Sure,


I was building a 2000 SF beach house (100 meters from the beach) and like all construction where there are
plants, one must get SEMANART clearance. What they do is come to the property after you apply, look at the
plants, determine which are protected and tell you to move them.


The most salient feature coming out of this experience is when a USA citizen tries to work in a foreign
country, he must change his perspective in the most unsuspecting places which usually results in quite a
different timeline for getting anything done.


What appear as simple tasks are complicated by local/federal governments running out of money, general
inefficiency, a very active environmental protection effort accompanied by strong laws and of course, that
unknown factor that might be fixed with a bribe (we weren't approached nor did we offer). We just waited.


So this was quite a different type of project than the phosphate dig will be and the only factor that I point out,
relevant for this discussion, is expectations of the timeline. I would expect delays no matter how swimmingly
well it was progressing.


Hope this helped.

for Odysseys 54%?


As far as valuation, Odyssey has had all of the information out there, and has been looking for partners. The assay
results have been released as news briefs. If a mining company were to review the findings, they would be investors
at the beginning, not wait an buy in, and they would actually lend their expertise to the environmental submittal
process. They can see the value of the mining claim, they would not wait until afterwards and buy in at a multiple
value.


According to the USGS, viable phosphate reserves are based on $40 per tonne to the mine, assuming a 15% profit
margin. Didn't the EIS report the costs to mine and concentrate at $65 per tonne? They will not likely be able to sell
the material to a processor for $75 per tonne. Why no mining investment?


Currently, Odyssey is claiming the shares are worth $2.50 each for Oceanica. $2.50, while the parent company
OMEX, is near $1? Realistic?, no. Has there been any accumulation of OMEX by a mining venture? No.


Odyssey has just provided as collateral, an unknown amount of shares at an unknown price, with conversions at an
unknown rate, thus diluting the value by who knows what. That means that Oceanica is encumbered even further,
making it far less attractive to a potential mining partner.


According to the EIS, there is a barge that takes the dredged material and converts it into the 18% concentrate. If
there wasn't any matrix, why do you need concentration? It is already reported that the concentration barge will be
placing the waste material back on the bottom. This includes sand, clay, shells and other materials. Why do you need
this barge if they can simply mine the material?


The Nambian project had 15% 'concentrates'. If that is the similar scenario, isn't that over 2 billion tonnes of material
moved to create the concentrates?


You are obfuscating the facts and reality of this mining operation.


Again, why doesn't Odyssey report the percent composition of the matrix, and only states there are 327M tonnes of
18% concentrates?

USGS numbers are for open pit. Benefaction/flotation will bring the rock to high 20's-low 30's. Mako does not
own 46%. Daniel Narvaez and others own about 25%. Mining companies that sign NDA's would be able to
see under the kimono. Mining companies can't just buy in; Oceanica did not need partners at the early stage
as they had enough funds t complete their assay and EIS. Granted, after this phase, whether they get the
green light or it's delayed for some reason, my guess is they will seek out a partner (obviously the former
situation would command a premium vs the second but I imagine that is a chance they are willing to take,
unless of course there are other negotiations going on behind the scenes as we speak). 
Oceania is hardly encumbered by a $10MM loan, unless you think Oceanica is worth about $10MM, and that
is your right, but far off the mark IMO. 
Odyssey cannot release the NI 43-101 report AS PER SEC RULES. It is a US company, not Canadian; if it
were Canadian , it could and would.

JPM is their banker. I suggest you see which debt and equity deals JPM has done and for whom in the
fertilizer business, and then you can tell us if JPM would still be taking on this project on a "success based"
compensation, if it were to embarrass them in from of their biggest ag clients. 
You are cherry picking information, again, just like you did with the HMS Victory discussion. 
Anyway, at this point, the Oceanica project is almost near the finish line with regards to a big hurdle. We will
know before Christmas.

Where are you getting your information from? Odyssey themselves stated the 'potential' to create 28%.  
They have released information about the assay results, the 327M tonnes of 18%, again, the potential to
produce. They do not state how much material is required to produce that 327M tonnes.  
You keep referring to the NI 43-101 report, and yes, that is a Canadian securities report. If that is the format
that the Mexican officials want, then it is simply a format, it is used by many countries for reporting, including
the US. The SEC has rules for what is submitted in SEC filings, but that does not prohibit Odyssey from
releasing relevant information, and it does not prohibit the release of the NI 43101 report, the SEC only
prohibits fraudulent or misleading reporting. 
A simple search on the internet will show hundreds of the NI report online in press releases, by companies in
Canada, Mexico AND the US. 
There is nothing to prevent Odyssey from releasing the assay data.


There was no assay report filed with the EIS application. That report would appear very relevant, especially
when looking at the amount of material that is being processed. Perhaps that will be question number 1 for
the SEMARNAT response?


The $10M loan did encumber Oceanica in several ways. First, was the direct collateral of shares, second was
the options. The details of the options were kept secret so that Odyssey "doesn't lose competitive advantage".
One has no idea how shares or at what price this entails. One would note that the details were kept secret
from the filing of the Q, pending SEC acceptance.


You refer to Oceanica near a finish line, I would concur, but the hurdle is a brick wall, and the project does
appear finished.

Why do you assume that they haven't been moving toward a deal with a mining partner since the drilling
results were announced? How many 500mn ton phosphate mines have you bought in your career? How do
you know how long it takes to get a deal done? How do you know how complex the deal might be or how
many parties may be involved? What do you know about the deal that gives you perfect confidence that no
deal will get done?


Who is obfuscating? "According to the EIS, there is a barge that takes the dredged material and converts it

sense. They concentrate the rock from 19% up to 28% through a mechanical process.


 
The reality is that mines with much higher operating and capital expenses are profitably operating today.
Those mines have billion dollar valuations attached to them.

Yes, and we've heard that many times before. It has been "all over" for the company for almost a year. Ho
hum.


16 Nov 2014, 06:01 PM


26922203
Again, did you read the EIS, yes or no?


These are Odysseys numbers, direct from the EIS. This assumes everything is running at capacity, and all
screening and processes are running perfectly as designed. Including vibration, reverse osmosis, and
transevaporation systems.


Pages 53 to 57


Dredge: 10000 m3/hr 
Producto 19% output capacity: 382 m3/hr


This assumes all systems at capacity, extracting as designed, from the dredge to finished product.


At capacity, finished product is 3.8% of total volume of material. (incl 11 m3/hr of salt water)


Note that this concentrator uses salt water for all operations. The concentrate is based in salt water, which
must be flushed out later before processing.

Oceanica is not a mining venture, but a dredging operation. The technology for dredging at 250 feet is well developed,
although this depth will require something more than standard harbor dredging equipment.


OMEX says the "overburden" (sand, shells) is minimal. You dredge the material off the sea floor, pump it into a barge,
separate the overburden out and return that to the sea floor. Then the remaining material containing phosphate is
processed and the 18% P2O5 separated out and sold as a fertilizer component.


Mining expertise is of limited use for this project. You want a large maritime operator like Boskalis as a partner.


I can't see OMEX developing Oceanica. They will probably partner with a large established company for a percentage

of the profits. Not bad since this is said to be a 50 year project. As the name implies, OMEX is an exploration
company.


16 Nov 2014, 02:54 AM


26922203
That is not correct.  
Looking at the EIS, there are 2 separate vessels, one is the dredger, the other is the concentrator. 
While dredging at depth has been established, the technology and system for concentration has never been done
before.


Your statement conflicts on itself. You are stuck on overburden, claiming it is minimal, then state that the remaining
material is concentrated and the 18% is separated out.  
Again, going back to the Nambian project, the 25% concentrate was but 20% of the 'remaining' material. How much
remaining material is the 18% concentrate drawn from? One would expect the sand at the bottom of the ocean to be
sand, ie mostly quartz and other minerals, not composed entirely of rock phosphate.


Could you obfuscate your terminology just a bit more? 18% separated out and sold as a component? The 18% needs
to be sold off, processed to remove the salts, the calcium level needs to be dealt with, THEN sold as a COMPONENT
of fertilizer production.  
Commercial rock phosphate is shown as a minimum of 30%, with 31% to 34% being the norm, yet Odyssey even
claims at the beginning, it MAY be converted into 28%?


Given the cost of producing then concentrate at $65 per tonne, no data for transport from offshore to a processor, nor
cost for processing.


Aside from the costs to generate concentrate, I see the environmental issues killing this off long before any dredging.


16 Nov 2014, 04:34 AM


Rory Duncan
"While dredging at depth has been established, the technology and system for concentration has never been
done before."


You're dead wrong, AGAIN. The technology and system for concentration is run-of-the-mill hydrocyclones
and/or screens/filters. Mechanical processes, nothing magic at all.


"Commercial rock phosphate is shown as a minimum of 30%, with 31% to 34% being the norm, yet Odyssey
even claims at the beginning, it MAY be converted into 28%?"


You're dead wrong, AGAIN. Commercial rock phosphate is sold in the high 20's though the largest market is
at 30-31 by volume. Odyssey can concentrate to high 20's through mechanical processes and sell the rock, or
they can concentrate further through chemical floatation but that's more involved.


If the project becomes part of a large, vertically integrated, fertilizer industry in Mexico, then the rock will likely
be beneficiated to higher levels and used to make phosphoric acid. These are decisions that will be made
after a major partnership I would guess.

Read the EIS and Odyssey statements.

Second step Separation plant: 8mm screen, cyclone, then 2mm screen 
Third step classifier (settling pond)

They are but screening, and washing, nothing else.


17 Nov 2014, 02:29 AM


Rory Duncan
The MIA spells out the steps involved in screening, but it doesn't say that the concentrate is at 18%.


The material they are pulling up from the bottom is at 18% concentration. That's the raw core material from
the bottom of the ocean. When they further concentrate it (by removing fines and shells) the concentration
increases to levels in the high 20's. This is the same for phosphate mines all over the world.


17 Nov 2014, 07:53 AM


26922203
You are simply wrong about the concentrate, those levels are not achieved with a screen plant.


For your sake, lets use your numbers. 327M tonnes at 18% correct.


They are required to dredge up almost 2 Billion tonnes to get that, correct?


17 Nov 2014, 02:59 PM


26922203
Read Bill's post above, at least he understands the processes and the product that Oceancia produces.

No, it is you who are simply wrong. You, in fact, have no idea what you are talking about. If the core samples
yield ore at 18.5% per the company's ni 43-101 compliant technical report, then why in the world would the
company bother screening the rock to concentrate it further if the concentration was going to stay the same at
18.5%? You are absolutely clueless.

Actually, phosphate is selling now at $110 per ton, delivered in Morocco, the dominant world source. Compare
shipping cost from Morocco to Mexico with shipping from 25 miles offshore Mexico. Phosphate sold as high as $410
in 2008.


http://bit.ly/11gnt4u


It is in the national interest of Mexico to develop the Don Diego project. I see the environmental issues as just another
obstacle which will be overcome, maybe with surreptitious national support.


Differences of opinion are what make markets. But, I'll bet I'm a lot more comfortable being long than you are being
short.


16 Nov 2014, 03:27 PM


26922203
The cost basis for a viable source is based on $40/ton to the mine, which covers costs plus 15% profit.


Just as gold is selling for $1500 per ounce, a mine does not get $1500 for unrefined ore.


Oceanica produces a concentrate of 18%, which is not usable. That is right from the EIS and Odysseys
statements. 
It must be shipped to a processor, which currently are all on the other side of Mexico, be processed through
several methods to get to the 28% rock phosphate. It doesnt appear that even Odyssey thinks the materiel
can get to the base 31%-34% Morrocan standard. Then is really only usable, even according to Odyssey to
produce phosphoric acid, yet another process.


As another point, the Mexicans don't need rock phosphate, they need fertilizer. (Odyssey referred to the wet
process) http://bit.ly/1A67t4h


17 Nov 2014, 02:42 AM


Rory Duncan
You're wrong again. "Oceanica produces a concentrate of 18%, which is not usable."


No, the material at the bottom of the ocean where Oceanica will dredge is at 18%. When it is screened it will
concentrate to 28-29%, just like in the case of Vale's Bayovar mine in Peru. This is done through a simple
screening process.


"It doesnt appear that even Odyssey thinks the materiel can get to the base 31%-34% Morrocan standard."
That's just absurd. You have no idea what you're talking about.


"As another point, the Mexicans don't need rock phosphate".....You're going to have to explain this to Pemex,
the Mexican government, and the Dept of Agriculture. They are all under the impression that the country
consumes 600k tons/yr of phosphate while only producing 150k tons last year (http://bit.ly/1yMjl7p). You'll also
have to explain to them why they should be satisfied with underfertilizing by half their arable land each year.
While you're at it, let them know that they shouldn't attempt to use their natural resources to help reduce a
large trade balance and their dependency on other nations for food.

Pemex is investing billions to build a vertically integrated fertilizer business in Mexico. You may think you
know more about the prospects for the phosphate market in Mexico than Pemex, but you don't. Building an
investment thesis that is dependent on the failure of Oceanica is a very dicey proposition.


17 Nov 2014, 08:27 AM


26922203
You left out half of my statement, I stated they dont need rock phosphate, they need fertilizer.


The cannot use the 18% concentrate that Oceanica produces. Why cant you understand this?


Read Bills post above, he understands what Oceanica produces.


There will have to be another process in line, to wash out the salts, and convert the 18% to 28%. There are
several ways to do this.


THEN, the 28% can be used to make fertilizer. 
Rock phosphate has NO nitrogen, which is why they process it to add Nitrogen for the plants.


Look at this: 
P2O5 Source Rock Phosphate 
N (%): 0 
Total (%): 34  
Available (%): 38 
Water soluble* (%): 0


Do you really think that farmers will use rock phosphate when it is ZERO percent water soluble? (formed
underwater-first clue)

Rock phosphate will be processed to make DAP , MAP etc., in a way that is beyond your grasp. Amazing,
that a month ago, you didn't know the difference between phosphoric acid and rock phosphate; now you are
an expert on vertically integrated fertilizer structures, the chemical makeup of fertilizers, and the various
frequencies and mating habits of the grey whale. Incredible.


18 Nov 2014, 12:18 PM


Rory Duncan
No, the 28-29% concentrated rock phosphate from Don Diego would likely not be sold for direct application
purposes. It will be sold or transferred in a vertically integrated operation to make more refined fertilizer
products such as map and dap.

If you would take a moment to put my comments in context. Several of my comments were based on posters,
such as Rory, who were stating the concentrated material from the barge could be directly used. My
comments were that it cannot, and must be processed, hence the link I provided to the processing methods. I
do not need to repeat the processing methods and steps required, as it is in the link. That does not mean I
have no knowledge, it is simply easier to provide a link with very well established details.


The concentrated material that the dredge and barge produce is at 18%. That is established by the processes
shown in the EIS, as well as statements from Odyssey. The significant amount of material required to be
processed is also veiled in the EIS with production capacities and end resultants, and this was verbally
detailed in my posts.


One would expect the reader to look at the links provided and make comments on the factual data, rather
than mimic each others posts.


The processing to DAP, MAP, or whatever, of the concentrate is not really the issue here, other than Oceanica
does not provide it. What does matter is what they will provide, how much material is required to create the
327M tonnes of 18% concentrate, and what 18% concentrate is worth on the market. 
They have a dredge, a screen plant, with a salt water wash. That is it, no processing other than classification,
which one would note as the last step in their process.  
So, are you going to claim that what they show in the EIS includes enhancement/enrichment to 28%?


Should one be interested, there is a foundation for the ship and the concentration barge. The IES is available
for the Nambian project, and is virtually all the same consultants, same equipment, with about the same
numbers, especially on the acoustics. That project claimed 20% concentrates, while Oceanica claims 18%, so
again, very similar.


The outcome will likely be similar as well.
