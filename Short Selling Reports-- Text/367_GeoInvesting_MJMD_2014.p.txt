Medijane Pump
Campaign Being
Funded By
Shareholder(S) By
Up To $400,000
Weekly Budget!
May 19, 2014 11:53 AM ET11 comments | Includes: MediJa…


On 5/16/2014 we mentioned to our premium members that there has been
recent third party promotional activity for Medijane (OTCPK:MJMD), and that
we were looking into the story for red flags regarding the characters involved
in the story.


We stated that Tobin Smith was part of the pump campaign. It's worth noting
that out of the 25 stocks Tobin has promoted (that we tracked since August
2011), the average return is negative 95%, with only two stocks showing
positive returns. This increases our confidence that MJMD will ultimately dump.
We were able to confirm that the promotional budget is being financed by a
large shareholder/shareholders of MJMD that intend to sell the stock. One
thing to keep in mind - the promotional budget is fairly sizable ($400,000 per
week).


Here is an excerpt from the disclaimer of the campaign:

Disclosure: I am short MJMD.


Mikie713
Better cash in your shorts while the
cashing in is good. Here's the bottom line,
my friend, $MJMD is operating in a state
that has JUST APPROVED the "right to try"
medications that considered experimental.
That opens the flood gates for companies
like $MJMD to bring to market various
applications. One such medication is
Cannamist, a sublingual cannabis spray
going to dispensaries throughout California
and eventual Colorado, available to
millions of MJ patients. Nothing of this
mentioned in your slander against this
company. Why? Because you haven't done
your research on this company; you really
don't know a damned thing about them,
do you?

regulators will react to the fact that large
shareholders are paying money to support
what looks to be an obvious pump and
dump campaign.

Look, I don't believe $MJMD is paying
anyone up to 400K weekly to advertise,
that's absurd. That statement alone needs
to be dissected and verified.

These stock promoters demand their cut of
the profits e.g. 400 000 a week. That's
because the promoter knows they are
promoting garbage, the promoter knows
they are facilitating a pump and dump.
The disclaimer even shows that the
promoter knows of insiders' intention to
sell shares.


"UVQ does not perform any due diligence
on the stocks and companies discussed
herein. UVQ relies on generally available
public information and representations
made by Medijane"  
This translates to: UVQ doesn't do DD
because UVQ knows what it would find
would not be promising. After all, the
companies that take on the servicss of
UVQ are paying money to promote their
stock, not grow their business. UVQ
instead relies on the (mis)representations
made by Medijane. In this way UVQ can't
be complicit in a pump and dump because
UVQ can claim the newsletters etc they
wrote were a fair representation of the
company, in this case medijane, given the
(mis)information they had (medijane press
releases).


Make sense now?

Question: Can one make money on a stock
going down? Answer: Yes.


We stated that Tobin Smith was part of the
pump campaign. It's worth noting that out
of the 25 stocks Tobin has promoted (that
we tracked since August 2011), the
average return is negative 95%, with only
two stocks showing positive returns.


It appears Tobin Smith has a track record
of guiding shorts.

And what's even better is UVQ can't be
complicit.


Since the existence of Globalvision
Communications LLC ("GMS") can not be
confirmed (I dare anyone to try), I suspect
this whole campaign is a ruse to short this
stock. And $MJMD had absolutely nothing
to do with it.


Stock manipulations work both ways.


27 May 2014, 09:37 AM


Biotech Beast, Contributor
So you think the promotion is
genuinelty 3rd party? And designed to
cause the stock to go down long term?


Perhaps the 400K a week is only for a
week or two, ie 800K total.


Its an interesting theory through,
thanks for the food for thought.


27 May 2014, 11:30 AM


Mikie713
I don't think the 400K exists, it's a fake
figure to attract the kind of watchdog
attention in this article. And yes I believe
this is all about some third party
manipulation of the stock price. I looked
into Globalvision and it gives an address in
Nevis where I looked for further
information and couldn't find anything. I
don't think it exists at all. I think this is a
very well thought out manipulation that
not even the SEC can track down. All it has
to do is throw some cold water and fear
into the stock's investors for a few days
and these bandits make their money and
move on to the next stock.

Thats a thought... so basically these
people can ride the stock up by buying
before the pump, and then ride it down
when there is a trading halt? How do
they know when to short though?
Because the promotion makes the stock
go up immediately (easy to time) but
down eventually due to articles acusing
LIVE of being a scam (hard to know
when these articles will be released)
and trading halts from the SEC (hard to
know if and when the SEC responds)

Mikie713
That's my allegation against this particular
"pump and dump" ... it's so transparent,
on closer examination there's something
else going here. $MJMD has already
recovered and I haven't read about this
pump anywhere else. I think what prompts
the SEC's attention more than anything
are the PRs released from the security
itself. As in the case of the recently halted
FRTD. Outrageous projections or claims,
etc. Nothing like that is coming from this
security.

What a waste of money - not working!

Mikie713
There are a lot of question marks
surrounding this whole thing. The numbers
aren't any where near what's been
reported here, they can't be! If there's any
truth to this, it is connected to the
Cannamist roll out at California
dispensaries later this summer.
