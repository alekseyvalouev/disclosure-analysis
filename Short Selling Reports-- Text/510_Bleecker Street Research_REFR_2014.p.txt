Research Frontiers: Shares Could Fall Substantially If Sky-High
Expectations Are Not Met
Top Idea | Jun. 19, 2014 5:00 AM ET173 comments

Summary


Research Frontiers has a long history of failing to deliver.


Since 2001 Research Frontiers has issued more shares than generated dollars in
revenue.


Shares could fall 75%-95% if expectations are not met.


Research Frontiers (NASDAQ:REFR), currently trading at $5.90 a share with a market
cap of $136 million, is substantially overvalued with an overstated addressable market, a
history of diluting shareholders, and a sky-high valuation. Under certain circumstances
shares could fall 75% to 90%.


Research Frontiers is not a new company. The technology is not new. The company was
incorporated in New York in 1965 that makes this company nearly 50 years old. Age of a
company is not usually a red flag unless a company has been selling the same story, and
failing to deliver, for nearly that entire time. The company's roots go back even further than
that, as it was "incorporated (...) to continue early work the Dr. Edwin Land, founder of
Polaroid Corporation, and others had done in the work of light-control beginning in the
1930s." Bulls would like to have you think that this is some new technology, that major
adoption is right around the corner. That has been the story for ages now and that
adoption has never come. Research Frontiers licenses something called SPD or
"suspended particle devices." SPD is essentially particles which are suspended between
two sheets of glass, when an electric current passes through the glass, can be dimmed to
control how much light can pass through the glass.


Over the years Research Frontiers has said that this technology will be used in car
sunroofs, side mirrors, commercial and residential buildings, aircraft windows, goggles,
and even sunglasses. So far none of these claims have played out, and the company
generates only nominal revenue from licensing this technology to other companies. This is
a very long story of a company that has never lived up to what it has claimed to have. The

story of shareholders being diluted while management gets rich. Despite this history, there
are still vocal supporters of Research Frontiers. I suspect that they will be burned yet
again.


Business Overview


Research Frontiers generates minimal revenue by licensing the SPD product for various
uses, mainly in automobiles and for use in aircraft. If you would like to learn more about
the bull case, there was an interview with Research Frontiers' CEO published on Seeking
Alpha. In an interview on Seeking Alpha, CEO Joseph Harary responded to a question
about what his company did by saying:


"(...) Research Frontiers has invented and licenses Suspended Particle Device
technology, which is a film based nano technology that allows you to control the tint
of glass or plastic. The technology is used in four main industries. The largest is the
automotive industry, the aircraft industry, the architectural industry and the marine
industry. In addition, this year we launched our VariGuard division, which seeks to
protect light sensitive artifacts from damage."


The company also has an IR presentation on its website which is useful for a quick
overview. Bulls seem to believe that the company has finally turned the corner and that
profitability is around the corner. They highlight the joint ventures with Mercedes and
Daimler, defending their views by suggesting that Mercedes would never do business with
a company with an inferior product, which may be true. Given the company's history
however, investors should remain highly skeptical that any turning point has been
reached.

The stock has floundered for much of the past 10 years after getting caught up in the tech
bubble of the late 1990's. This article, which appeared around the time of Research
Frontier's IPO in 1989 in the New York Times should put things in perspective for
investors. The article reads:


Research Frontiers Inc. says it has successfully tested ''electrically controllable
variable light transmission sunglasses'' that filter out 44 to 88 percent of the light, at
the wearer's option. By comparison, ordinary window glass filters out 20 percent of
the light, and dark sunglasses filter out 85 percent, said Robert L. Saxe, the
company's president.


The technology may be adapted to ski goggles, helmet visors, and automobile
sunroofs and side windows. Mr. Saxe said it also shows promise for windows
in offices and homes, where it could be used to keep out sunlight on hot
summer afternoons and allow it in during the winter. If equipped with an electric
eye, the window -or sunglasses - could be set to maintain a constant light level no
matter what the level of sunlight.


At that time it appears the company was focusing on sunglasses although it clearly had its
sights set on bigger things. How long did it take to get there? Well in 2003 Research
Frontiers announced that Daimler AG was using its technology in a bus, but that did not
lead to any meaningful revenue for Research Fronties. Then in 2011 Research Frontiers
announced that Mercedes had licensed its technology for the SLK.

As I will show, Research Frontiers has a history of similar deals with companies that failed
to reward Research Frontiers shareholders. To finance this continued non-delivering of
promises Research Frontiers has continually issued shares, diluting shareholders along
the way. As you can see between 2000 and 2014 there was not a single year when the
number of Research Frontiers Shares outstanding did not increase from the previous year.
The pace of these increases appears to be increasing over the last several years as well.


For a brutally obvious example of how Research Frontiers has failed to deliver on its
numerous promises, we can simply look to the first few sentences of annual reports and
compare that to operating results.


2001:

Since our letter to you in last year's Annual Report, there have been some dramatic
and exciting changes at Research Frontiers and in the various industries that our
SPD light-control technology serves. In 2001 the Company's most important long-
term goal-commercialization of SPD technology-was successfully accomplished!
The supply infrastructure that we have been building over the years continues to
grow and now consists of 15 companies licensed to make SPD emulsions, films and
end products. And now that SPD Inc.'s factory in Incheon, South Korea is in
production, SPD-Smart™ products are beginning to be sold for a variety of
applications worldwide. (Source)

"Mass production of products utilizing the Company's SPD (suspended particle
device) light control technology started in 2002 to meet the growing need for light,
glare and heat control in buildings and vehicles. The first SPD film production facility
came online at the Incheon, South Korea, factory of SPD Inc. (SPDI), a majority-
owned subsidiary of our licensee, Hankuk Glass Industries Inc., Korea's largest
glass company. Our licensees have introduced a variety of SPD-Smart™ end-
products using SPD film produced by SPDI, including architectural, automotive,
aircraft, marine, and appliance windows." (Source)


2003:


Last year at our annual meeting we spoke about "Building and Industry." Since then,
all three of the world's largest glass groups have either licensed or sublicensed our
SPD-Smart™ light-control technology. These companies include Japan's largest
glass company, Asahi Glass Company, Ltd., which has acquired a sublicense from
its affiliate, AGC Automotive Americas (formerly called APTechnoglass) for using
SPD technology for automotive sunroofs. Saint-Gobain France SA, a subsidiary of
Europe's largest glass company, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, was granted a broad
non-exclusive license to make various SPD-Smart™ products. And, most recently,
Pilkington plc, inventors of the world-renowned float glass process for producing flat
glass, has been granted a worldwide non-exclusive license to work with SPD Smart-
light control technology and to provide lamination services to Research Frontiers'
licensees."


"DaimlerChrysler's introduction in September outfits new Setra 415 HD luxury
touring bus with a panoramic glass roof using SPD-Smart light control technology
(pictured above). SPD-Smart glass is also being used in the Jeep Rescue concept
vehicle which so far this year has been featured at the Detroit, Chicago and New
York Auto Shows. In addition to DaimlerChrysler, other automobile manufacturers
are working with our licensees to introduce a variety of SPD-Smart automotive
products into their vehicles." (source)

This past year, five new companies became licensed to use SPD technology, and
our 34 licensees now include some of the world's largest chemical, film and glass
companies. The customers that these licensees have been working with to introduce

2005:


There is a Haitian proverb: "Beyond the mountains are more mountains." This
proverb applies to most companies involved in bringing a new technology to market.
In R&D, after one issue is solved, others sometimes arise. It is appropriate to note
that Haiti is an island nation, so that eventually, with perseverance and hard work,
the mountains end, the goal is reached, and smooth sailing across the ocean of
opportunity can begin. We are happy to report that we can see the ocean and some
very large companies are preparing to bring SPD-Smart™ products to the world.
While we have always focused intensely on the development of our SPD light-
control technology, this past year in particular, the Company has been working with
extreme dedication and has made several very important new inventions to enable
our film licensees to begin to successfully produce very attractive second generation
SPD-Smart light-controlling film. A key part of our R&D strategy is to anticipate and
find solutions for any potential problem or weakness relating to SPD emulsions, films
or products. As discussed at our June 2005 Annual Meeting, part of this strategy is
to gain further direct experience with commercially coating SPD emulsions into film,
and the Company has now completed our own coating trials using the facilities of an
outside toll coater. (source)

Shareholders have often asked when a large manufacturer would begin selling or
using SPD-Smart windows or other products. This question was decisively answered
on February 9, 2007 when the Raytheon Aircraft Company announced in a press
release that it is now offering electronic aircraft window shades using Research
Frontiers' SPD-Smart light-control technology for retrofitting and upgrading all
models of its Beechcraft® King Air aircraft. Now that SPD light-control film is
available from Hitachi Chemical's production facilities in Japan, and additional
sources of SPD film are expected to enter production, and with customer adoption
now gaining traction and becoming known worldwide, we expect that the SPD
industry will begin to grow and flourish. SPD Smart-technology also continues to
receive worldwide attention at major trade shows, conferences and as the recipient
of prestigious awards. (...) We believe that the future now looks very bright for
Research Frontiers and we expect our licensees to achieve substantial business
with SPD-Smart products for many applications. (source)


Here are what I consider to be the important highlights from each of these statements
from 2001 to 2006. Note that after 2007 Research Frontiers changed the format of its
annual letter into more of a brochure. While there is nothing wrong with this, it is simply a
different format with easier to digest information. If there are more traditional shareholder
letter from this time on I could not find them.


So now let's review the operating results.

Since Research Frontiers shareholders finally got their answer to "When will a large
manufacturer begin selling SPD Smart-Glass." Research Frontiers has:


1. Generated $8.6 million in fee income.
2. Spent $44.3 million in total expenses.
3. Generated a $21 million net losses.


Since Research Frontiers announced that it could "see the ocean" in 2005 Research
Frontiers has:


1. Generated $8.8 million in fee income.
2. Spent $48.5 million in total expenses.
3. Generated a $25 million net losses.


Since Daimler announced that it would have a bus using SPD Smart Glass in 2003,
Research Frontiers has:


1. Generated $9.28 million in fee income.
2. Spent $57.9 million in total expenses.
3. Generated $34.1 million in net losses.


Since Research Frontiers proudly announced that their products had reached mass
production it has:


1. Generated $9.5 million in revenue.
2. Spent $62 million in total expenses.
3. Generated $38 million in net losses.


Since Research Frontiers was "no longer a concept company" it has:


1. Generated $9.64 million in revenue. Over 13 years this averages out to roughly $742k
per year in revenue.


2. Generated $67 million in total expenses.
3. Generated $42.65 million in net losses.


Overstated Market Size, What Type Of Cars Would Use This?


Generally past actions, especially with a company that has a history of over promising and
under delivering, are a good predictor of future action. In building a strong short case, one
should not just rely on the past. Bulls will no doubt argue that the company has finally
"turned the corner" and that the long promised fee income will now start coming in. Is that
the case? Well one can never be certain, and Research Frontiers may have, finally after

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2276223-research-frontiers-shares-could-fall-substantially-if-sky-high-expectations-are-not-met 10/63


all these years actually made the turn. Even if it has, I believe that it is overstating the size
of the potential market for its product. In the previously mentioned interview with the CEO
on Seeking Alpha, CEO Harary responded to a question about the market size potential
by saying:


Brett: SPD-SmartGlass is primarily used in premium vehicles. Is your company
working with non-luxury automakers to put this technology in regular cars and is
there a need for this high end technology in regular cars?


CEO Joesph Harary: There's certainly a need and if you look at the way technology
is deployed is that many technologies are deployed in premium vehicles first before
they go to regular cars. Anti-lock brakes were used only in premium vehicles.
Typically the volumes in the auto industry are such that it drives the price down to
the point where we can penetrate many different vehicles. Even if we just looked at
premium vehicle sunroofs with an MSRP above $40,000 (sic) your talking about a
$225 million. Add to that non-sunroofs and regular vehicles and you can see that the
market opportunity is very large.


While technology may be deployed that way for some products, it seems ludicrous to
compare a product that controls how much light comes into a car, to a product that saves
lives such as anti-lock brakes. Right now the product costs $2,500 more for someone
purchasing a Mercedes to get the Magic Sky system in their car. Can the cost be lowered?
Perhaps but lowered enough to make it attractive to those purchasing a $40,000 car. The
Mercedes S series starts at $92,900. For someone who is paying that much for a car is an
extra $2500 really all that much? The answer is probably no as it is only 3% more with the
Sky Magic roof than without it. As you move down the luxury car line and prices fall,
however, it is a much less attractive tradeoff. For example with a $50,000 car to get the
roof would cost you 5% more. At $40,000 it would cost you 6% more. At $30,000 it would
cost you 8% more. At $20,000 it would cost 13% more. As you go down that line and
buyers become more price conscious, they are much less likely to fork over an extra
$2,500 for something that is clearly a luxury. Clearly this product is not anywhere close to
being as important as anti-lock brakes.


CEO Comments On Margins, Huh?


From the same interview with the CEO on Seeking Alpha. When asked about his
company's margins, CEO Harary said:
5/18/2018 Research Frontiers: Shares Could Fall Substantially If Sky-High Expectations Are Not Met - Research Frontiers Incorporated (NASDAQ:…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2276223-research-frontiers-shares-could-fall-substantially-if-sky-high-expectations-are-not-met 11/63


Brett: Another area that seems to stand out is your company's margins. They
appear to be deep in negative territory. What is Research Frontiers doing to improve
its margins?


CEO Joseph (sic) Harry: We actually have very high margins, but our products
were not put into vehicles until 2011. As a licensing company we don't have
inventory so we are getting a royalty of typically between 10 and 15 percent of the
revenues come from royalties. As the revenues grow so will the profitability.


This is a chart of Research Frontiers' gross margins.


As you can see they are not positive, in fact they are nowhere near being positive. CEO
Harary focuses in on the licensing aspect of it. A company that licenses its product does
not produce anything obviously has positive margins. But for the past 13 years apparently
the product was either too expensive or not good enough to generate any fee income for
the company. So true margins are very negative. In 2013 they were -272%. Of course, if
you ignore expenses margins might be positive, but you can't do that. In the Q&A for the
4Q13 Conference Call, Craig-Hallum analyst Steve Dyer asked:


You had talked a little bit about the royalty per S-Class that you anticipate a $150 to
$250.

For a product that Mercedes sells as a $2,500 upgrade, Research Frontiers gets between
$150 and $250. Assuming a 100% rate, like the company does in its presentations, then
that will generate solid revenue.


Think about that for a second, Daimler's luxury vehicles represent a $94mm annual
revenue opportunity IF they get a 100% take rate. That is a huge assumption to make
given that most cars don't have a need for a panoramic sunroof. Mainly hardtop
convertibles or sports cars, not every single luxury vehicle that Daimler produces at a
100% take rate. It would appear that Research Frontiers is setting shareholders up for a
major disappointment if that's 100% take rate.


On Expenses, It's Not Just A One Time Thing


Drawing from the same interview again, the CEO made a notable comment when asked
about rising expenses.


Brett: What is your company doing to tackle its rising expenses?


CEO Joseph Harary:A lot of those were non cash expenses. These are mostly
accounting treatments for equity issuances and things. Our expenses are still
relatively modest. it's not anything that is a change in our business model. Many of
these expenses were related to the creation of the VariGuard Division, so it's not that
important. Nothing really material.


While those expenses may truly be one time expenses, they certainly seem to be at
similar levels multiple times in the past 15 years. I found another quote that Mr. Harary
made regarding his company's business model very interesting. After being asked about
the possibility of a special dividend, Mr. Harary noted:


"One of the nice things about our business model is that we have very modest
and predictable expenses."


Here is a chart of Research Frontiers' total expenses ranging back to 2000.

That do not look either predictable or modest.


An Attempt At Valuation


Given that Research Frontiers is nowhere near close to being profitable, and has not
generated meaningful revenue since inception, it is somewhat difficult to value. A brief
comparison to some of Research Frontier's competitors will reveal that it appears wildly
overvalued.

As you can see Research Frontiers trades at 26x its nearest competitor, which is Corning
(NYSE:GLW). To give readers an idea of what downside could be, here is the implied
share price and multiples at decreasing P/S multiples.


I believe that Corning is the closest competitor of Research Frontier. Corning and
Research Frontiers do different things but both produce a technologically advanced glass.
Corning also has the highest P/S multiple in the group. If Research Frontiers traded in-line

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2276223-research-frontiers-shares-could-fall-substantially-if-sky-high-expectations-are-not-met 15/63


with Corning that would suggest 96% downside. Here are the P/S ratios of some popular
stocks. Netflix trades at 5x P/S, Tesla trades at 13x P/S, Keurig Green Mountain trades at
5x P/S, Micron trades at 2x P/S, Facebook trades at 18x P/S, Twitter trades at 28x P/S.


The reason that it could drop so much this time after floundering for so long is the sky high
expectations that are priced into it. Before it was just a bus that product was going to be
in, or a smaller market. Now the expectation is that it is going to be in every luxury car, in
airplanes, in museums protecting documents. Consider this, for Research Frontiers to
grow into a generous 30x P/S it would have to quadruple its fee income. Can it do this? I
do not believe it can. Given the overstated market in luxury cars and relatively small
market in airplanes this isn't happening anytime soon. The aircraft market wouldn't have
SPD Technology ready until 2015 to 2017 according to the Q4 Conference Call, so until
then they will be relying on just the auto and museum markets to generate revenue. And
analysts are modeling the stock like Research Frontiers is finally done building its product.
The same Craig-Hallum analyst said on the Q4 call,


Last question for me, as you begin to ramp revenues more meaningfully with the S,
et cetera, should we see an increase of much at all in the operating expenses, in
other words R&D, I mean my guess is the R&D is pretty much done other than
tweaks here and there?


If he is modeling that R&D will fall drastically soon then he, as one of the few analysts
covering the name, is setting up institutional shareholders for disappointment. If you read
carefully you can see that Research Frontiers is already setting itself up for other markets
such as architecture and museums. This is despite what they claim is a $225mm revenue
opportunity in the luxury auto market. If Research Frontiers thought that they could get a
meaningful slice of that they wouldn't be announcing new groups and segments. As has
happened numerous times in the past, the fee income from Mercedes will fail to impress.
Institutional shareholders that got involved because of an analyst with a model that was
projecting zero (or close to) R&D going forward will be angry and sell. As the market
realizes this and the long history of similar actions I believe it will no longer be willing to
pay such a premium for expected growth that will likely not materialize.


Noticing a trend here? Even some of the most (arguably) overvalued and high growth
stocks trade at a multiple far below that of Research Frontiers. Is there a catalyst to cause
this drop? Not necessarily a hard catalyst but Research Frontiers has set expectations
very high this time. Do shareholders remember the past, all the unrealized expectations?
If Research Frontiers can't deliver this time over the next several quarters, this will be

enough of a catalyst. History rhymes and if the past is any indication, Research Frontiers
shareholders are set up for another disappointment. One last thought, since 2001
Research Frontiers has issued 10.85 million shares. Over that same period it has
generated $9.64 million in revenue. So just to be clear, over that time frame it has
issued roughly 1.1 shares for each $1 of revenue it has generated. All the while
promising shareholders that this time was finally different. Is this time different? We'll see.
History would suggest that it isn't. If this time isn't different then, reasonable valuation
assumptions suggest between 76% to 95% downside.

Can you tell us about the relationship with Gentex which has made auto dimming car mirrors for years using what
sounds like the same type of technology?


19 Jun 2014, 08:19 AM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I do believe they did mention that they thought that the car mirror market was saturated on
one of their conference calls but I'm not 100% sure. They have a long history of not liking each other, see this
press release from 1994 http://bit.ly/1yowm8T


Also they did mention it as one of the competitors in the 10-k, mentioning that it was one of their competitors.
Other than that I'm not really all that familiar with it.

Competition: Only the R&D department of Gentex is a competitor of Research Frontiers. The production
department of Gentex is a potential customer of Research Frontiers (if Gentex management were to decide
that it prefers SPD technology.) 
Technology: Automatically dimming mirrors from Gentex employ the "electrochromatic effect". That differs
from the SPD technology at Research Frontiers. 
Both technologies include a sandwich of glass. In SPD glass, Suspended Particles reorient themselves in
reaction to an applied electrical charge. The suspended particles move to admit or block light. In Gentex's
electrochromatic technology, nothing moves. The materials within the glass sandwich react chemically. They
oxidize and, thereby, change their reflectance. You can read about the the two technologies at:

As a few others have already said, much of the confidence of REFR investors devolves from REFR's
impressive list of licensees.


I have casually followed, but not owned REFR for years. I remember when Hitatchi announced, "With its
newly completed coating line dedicated to production of SPD film, Hitachi Chemical has expanded its
production capacity of SPD film to 400,000 sq meters/year.” (That’s ~4.3 million sq ft/ year). See:
http://bloom.bg/1m71S5U


If Hitachi’s production capacity had been fully utilized (or even 20% utilized), then we would have seen vastly
greater revenues (and even profits!) at Research Frontiers. Clearly, Hitachi had anticipated much more

demand than has materialized.


A note on timing of reported earnings, according to the business plan of REFR: Research Frontiers chose to
charge very low licensing fees in exchange for larger royalties based upon the final sales price to the end
consumer. Because of this, REFR won’t be profitable until significant amounts of product reaches the end
customer. So, even if Hitachi suddenly sold a huge batch of SPD emulsion, several months would pass
before that emulsion was sandwiched between glass plates, installed into a car (or boat or house) and then
finally sold to the end consumer. Licensees would then pay the royalty to REFR within 30 to 60 days And
then, finally, the royalties would show up in REFR next quarterly report. The overall delay can easily be 6 to
12 months.


However, the report from Hitachi (in the link above) is from a Bloomberg news story dated Dec 16, 2009. So, I
assume that Hitachi’s “dedicated” SPD production plant has been largely idle for the past 4 years.


So, REFR investors who overestimated sales of SPD glass are not alone. Hitachi did too.

Great article. Fully agree with your story here. It is hard to understand how this company manages to survive for so
long. Here are my two cents to add to your story: 
- The company has been covered along the similar lines already back in 2001-2003 in VIC (http://bit.ly/1ynPhR4) and
Asencio (http://bit.ly/1ynPhR8). Basically the company was termed something in the range of ‘legal fraud’ where
management benefits for years at the expense of shareholders. Share price has declined quite a bit since, but
management is still pulling the same strings and still receives their excessive salaries. 
- Also on excessive compensation, just consider that CEO’s 2013 salary with bonuses is approximately equal to the
whole of 2013 REVENUE (not profit, but revenue). 
- It might appear that insiders have been buying the stock recently, but the purchases mainly relate to Kevin Douglas,
who bought majority of his shares in the private placement (not open market) at below market prices. On the last

conference call, management appeared to be very enthusiastic about this equity dilution (750k additional shares or c.
3% of all outstanding), although they were not able to clarify how these newly raised funds will be used. Also I would
suggest reading the comments section in VIC article to better grasp the naivety of fanatical REFR shareholder base –
they are very likely to buy the stock for reasons completely unrelated to fundamentals. 
- Company recently announced a further equity dilution whereby 1m of new shares will be issued for employees – that
is another 4% dilution, in line with historical trend described in the article. 
- Strangely enough the company started employing accounting tricks to offset the impact of lower revenues. Q1 2014
expenses appear to be 30% lower compared to Q1 2013, which also caused the net loss to be somewhat lower.
However, the whole OpEx decrease is attributed to stock based compensation, which for Q1 2013 was 713k. This
expense did not disappear, it was rather moved forward to Q4 2013. On like for like basis (excluding stock based
compensation) the expenses OpEx have stayed the same despite twice lower revenues. 
- On the revenue decrease, management commented that this was due to a one-off license fee in Q1 2013. However,
if you listen to their comments and read through press releases and reports back in Q1 2013, there is nothing
mentioned about one-off license fee and all revenues are presented as recurring in nature. So it completely unclear
how Q2 2014 will look like. 
- Finally, have a look at the high number of 8-K reports filled by the company (http://1.usa.gov/1ynPhRc). Basically
there are twice as many 8-K reports as any other regulatory fillings. And if you read through some of them, you will
find that these 8-Ks are about trade-shows the company participated, Mercedes unveiling a new car or some
seemingly promising new licenses. None of these include any numbers or likely impact to REFR financials. Juts pure
PR campaign to encourage shareholders to buy more and more. For me it seems company is spending more time
and resources promoting itself to shareholders than to customers. 
- Also, if you read through conference call transcripts, you will notice that management refrains from discussing hard
numbers and focuses on the same soft topics as in their 8K fillings. In some cases the callers even told management
to come back to the topic and answer the question after CEO started drifting into babbles of how wonderful their 60
year old technology is.

Author’s reply »  I agree 100% with you. I had meant to highlight executive compensation and not doing so
was an oversight. The comments on VIC were insightful and even though it appears that Asensio no longer
covers it he made some very good point in his previous research. I was shocked to find how little the story
has changed since then. Reading the YahooFinance message boards which is painful but does give you
interesting insight into how faithful shareholders are. Recipe for disaster if you ask me.

Looks like you have taken your best and last shot at painting this company a fraud before it turns profitable.


Your historical journey fails to mention the incredible positive results achieved INDEPENDENTLY by Daimler /
Mercedes during the most extreme testing ever conceived for the Research Frontier's technology. Those results
prompted Mercedes to make SPD the leader of its "Magic" series for its automobiles with "Magic Sky Control." Today,
Mercedes has introduced the technology into additional models because of its success.


You also fail to mention the ongoing commitment by some of the world's largest companies (Hitachi Chemical,
Daimler, etc) as examples of Research Frontier's licensees that make SPD part of their business model. Your
argument fails because these great companies would not be a part of an illicit scam. You can't have it both ways. If
you call RFI a scam, then you are painting all of its licensees with the same brush. You should know that is a lie that is
easily debunked.


You fail to mention that Research Frontiers has a stable cash position and NO DEBT. The corporation can also use
the large loss accumulations against future revenues that will enhance the bottom line of the balance sheet.


You can huff and puff until your fingers fall off but as long as some of the World's largest and most prestigious
companies continue to make Research Frontiers technology part of their business plans you will not blow their house
down. Conversely, anyone with an ounce of DD can see this article is the true scam being pushed on ill advised
investors.


20 Jun 2014, 06:34 AM


New Capital, Contributor
- on incredible results by mercedes and new lincensees - the same story has been retold many times since
early 2000 without any financial results results. You can always hope that 'this time it is different', but historical
evidence suggests otherwise. And if the breakthrough would be so close, I believe we would be seeing
substantial buying by company's management, especially CEO. 
- on stable cash position - this is rather small and is equivalent to only 10x CEO cash salary. Also I should
note that this cash position is only available because shareholders have been diluted a number of times
through equity issues. It is not that this cash buffer was built by operations. The company continues to burn
cash, and this buffer will disappear shortly.

- Overall your comment sounds very similar to the hundreds of promotional 8Ks filled by REFR, have you by
any chance read to many of those? (please do not take this as an insult) 
- REFR is not a scam from business perspective, it has a real product that is generating minimal revenues.
However, REFR looks like a scam from corporate governance perspective, where management was using
shareholders to pay salary for themselves, but produced nothing in terms of financial results already for two
decades. 
- Also, just think about it. The company trades at 50x sales, that is more than the overhyped facebook, twitter
and etc. Can you find any company that trades at such multiples without any new breakthrough technology
that could transform the world?

"Can you find any company that trades at such multiples without any new breakthrough technology that could
transform the world?"


It is staring you right in the face and is called SPD "Suspended Particle Device." Based on Daimler /
Mercedes independent testing there is no technology in the world that compares to SPD to provide light and
heat control simultaneous. I suspect you already knew that and have decided to turn a blind eye.


You also failed to mention that Honda Jet recently committed to providing SPD as a standard in its new
business jet.


You rail about the lack of revenues. Name another company that has achieved this level of market success
without ever going into debt. The small float is entirely acceptable given the recent adoption of the technology
by Daimler / Mercedes alone.


20 Jun 2014, 07:28 AM


New Capital, Contributor
- "SPD technology was first discovered more than 100 years ago." quote from here (http://bit.ly/1nnIqhZ) 
So definitely not a new technology and REFR has been pushing it for ages. Even with Mercedes the contract
started back in 2011. 3 years later revenue is still only $2m? So why should this new license change anything
dramatically? And here is a list of alternatives for SPD (http://bit.ly/1nnIqi0) 
- On Honda Jet's - how many of those are sold annually? this link (http://aol.it/1nnIrlU) indicates it is around
70-100 annually. Assuming REFR will get $2000/jet from Honda (which is 30x more than per one Mercedes),
the total additional revenue will amount to only $0.2m (and that is revenues, not profit), a drop in the ocean
compared to +$100m valuation. 
You could apply the same thinking about Mercedes contract, if 15000 new Mercedes SLs are bought with
SPD glass, the company will generate revenues of c. $2m and not clear how much of that will be left for profit.
Again all very very far to justify the current valuation. 
- Lastly, when you say "achieved this level of market success" - could you clarify what you mean by that.
What I see is that after 50 years since incorporation, REFR generates only 2m in revenues (which hardly
cover the salary of CEO) and have accumulated losses of $95m. So it is really hard to understand what you
mean by market success.

I believe that the only one who will benefit from new licenses and potential slight increase in sales with
Mercedes is the CEO, who would will be able to pay himself higher salary and higher bonuses.


Also, if you have any further comments on how wonderful this company is, I would suggest to base then on
factual information rather than statements "achieved this level of success". Your comments will then look
more credible.

SPD in its current form is absolutely a new technology form of the Suspended Particle Device. You are trying
to confuse the reader. Hitachi Chemical company has SPD products for sale and has its own recent Patents
based on the SPD technology. Pilkington has SPD products for sale and has its own recent patents based on
the SPD technology. Mercedes has products for sale and has its own recent patents based on the SPD
technology. These three alone destroy your claim that SPD is not a new technology. Fact is, it has been
evolving over years to the point that it is now the leading light control technology in the world.


Oh, and Research Frontiers, Inc. holds the primary patent from which all others are derived. Your "facts" are
totally distorted in terms of the current state of the technology. Your omissions suggest an extreme lack of
Due Diligence.


You also state that the current price is based on "high expectations." Actually, the price is very much in line
with "known" expectations for Hitachi / Pilkington / Mercedes royalty revenues increasing year over year.


20 Jun 2014, 08:44 AM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Wrong again. This technology is not new. They have been doing the same thing for 40 years
essentially. The product might be better than it was back then but it is not "new" technology. If it is not
overvalued then why are there only ~30 stocks in the R2K with a P/S ratio higher than REFR and why are
they all early to mid stage biotechs (which will naturally have a high P/S ratio because they are not revenue
generating at the moment)? What are the known expectations? What management is saying leading
investors to a 100% take rate assumption?

It's a nanotech not a technology and it had to be developed to be able to use it in products throughout several
industries. Many generations of SPD have been developed, some jointly with licensees and are a far cry from
even 10 years ago much less 50.


Mercedes sales will determine the profitability for the near term. The large production models began offering
SPD Magic Sky Control in 2011. Everything prior to that was activities that needed to be done to build the
SPD infrastructure.


The royalties from just two Mercedes models have been over 2 million dollars and those models are
roadsters. SPD Magic Sky Control is now in flagship S-Class. All the figures in the article are irrelevant since
it is the funding of development that was paid for by stock sales and left the company with no debt, a small
float and no cost of revenues. The years of losing money is coming to an end specifically because of the
money that went into the development of new generations of SPD and the filing of new patents on these to
keep the income flow coming.

The Seeking Alpha article indicates a growing short seller panic at the possibility that RFI will report net earnings for
Q3 and possibly the whole year. That the stock plunged yesterday before the article's publication clearly indicates an
effort to manipulate the stock price. Hitachi, Mercedes, Pilkington and Honda are not stupid or easily conned and
have invested heavily in testing the product before adopting it. Also, Kevin Douglas who has recently invested heavily
in RFI stock has a stellar record of stock picking.


This is clearly a manipulative hatchet job in the tradition of the discredited Asensio of several years ago.

Sometimes companies take a long time to molt, especially in the technology spae. I remember owning Stratasys back
in the 90's when it was trading at around $5 a share for a long time and doing nothing. 3-d technology was not ready
yet. Unfortunately sold it for no other reason than lack of patience and mad no money on it. 15 years later its $100
after a 3-1 split equivalent to $300. I think REFR's technology is starting to become a more accepting mainstream
technology as it is slowly encroaching the automotive, architectural, aviation and marine industries and more usages
are being found. There seems to be this convergence, and the lawsuit against e-ink amazon sony and barnes and
noble could add fuel to the fire.

A timely article that pretty succinctly summarizes the bear case: a history of overly optimistic statements by the
company during its equity funded multi-decade development stage indicates that all future statements will prove
outlandishly optimistic.


Timely as I write, because after decades of big statements, we will finally be able to see if this technology can
generate big bucks.


It's nice that with 3 years of royalty income from the SLK, two from the SL and revenue started from the S class coupe
this month that we will finally start to see if the bears prove right.


Recent press puts SPD technology into the Mercedes E class w213 coming in 12-18 months. Should SPD go into the
E class, I imagine that the adjective 'sky high' would not apply.


If in as short a time frame as this time next year, with all the S Class models (other than the convertible)offering SPD
technology as an option, and the company profitable somewhere between 25 and 50 cent/share on an annualized
basis, with confirmation that the both the E class and the BMW 7 Series will use SPD technology, I think that it will be
fair to say then that the bulls are right today.


I'd mention that in the world of electrochromic light technologies, PE and commercial funding into ventures like View
and Sage make RFI's market cap look low. EC thus far, outside of rear view mirror has been very disappointing. I
point to Gentex's failure to move beyond the 787 as evidence and the complete lack of unsubsidized architectural
installations by either View or Sage or St Gobain for that matter.

"They haven't changed this technology is 100 years old!"


Now it's just ridiculous. (It's not possible to take you guys seriously.) Nevertheless, the technology notwithstanding,
there has been an important development since those annual reports were delivered which of course you mention but
seem to fail to see the significance of: adoption by major OEM's.


Duh. Now, extrapolate. People like SPD. S-class take rates are high. Product migrates to E-class, get's picked up by
other OEM's. Stop it there.


Of course this may not happen, but clearly there's a decent chance of it, and if it does, this conversation, not to
mention a $6 REFR, will be ancient history.

that had to be chopped down to make 50 years worth of annual reports...........what a joke...........the environmentalists
need to be notified of this farce.............50 years........has anyone, other than the CEO of this business, EVER SEEN A

Mercedes has a product called Magic Sky Control, which is now offered on 23% of their luxury models. The SLK and
SL models in production have already brought the annual fee income to 2 million. Adding in the S-Class even at low
take rates puts the company in a profitable position. "Magic Sky Control" is not an old product and shows the way the
automotive industry will be going. BMW put it in a concept as well as Audi. There is not a technology in the world that
surpasses REFR's PATENTED SPD technology.


It's too late for short sellers to peddle this nonsense about what REFR does. They license the technology and the
products are tested and developed by licensees like Pilkington, Asahi, Mercedes. There is nothing standing in the way
of profitability. No debt and the S-Class coming on board this fall is the beginning of the end for the short sellers who
blundered when they sold over 2 million shares short. They covered 500 thousand but still have a long way to go.

Very good and convincing article. I don't short but if I did, this would be one I'd go for.


I also find it funny how on seemingly every short article, not just this one, all these new users with no written articles
make their very first comments defending the company and crying "hatchet job".


More power to you for publishing stuff like this - if I ever decide to short, I won't publish anything on it just to avoid the
garbage comments. Keep up the good work.

I remember that shortly after 9/11/2001 REFR announced that cockpit doors could be equipped with SPD equipped
windows. I wonder how many were sold?


In about the same time frame there was a wine cooler with an SPD top. This product was actually offered for sale! I
wonder how many of those they sold?


One thing that REFR is really good at selling is more shares.

The naysayers are avoiding the inevitable. Mercedes alone will make this a profitable enterprise. Mercedes
announced their production of models with SPD's Magic Sky Control in 2011.


Check the sales from that point on and you'll have a better idea of why longs aren't selling their rights to the dividends
from royalties as addressed in the interview with Joseph Harary CEO.

One thing I have noticed about REFR, the positive posters usually work a 40 hour week, (with one obvious
exception).


The negative posters usually post around the clock, and over a 7 day week, though maybe weekends are a bit slow
for them also, (understandable).


Look at the posts above this one, and take note of how many positive posters have a low post count. Obviously, all
they care about is REFR. This is an attitude also reflected on the Yahoo message board.


I have been watching REFR for over a dozen years,and I first went short in 2001. It was a short I should never have
covered, obviously!

I shorted REFR back in 2000 and made a little money off of it then, so I am generally sympathetic to the author's idea.
But I have to wonder why $6 would be a good entry price for a new short, and why is now the right time to short it? At
the risk of being pedantic, short positions are riskier than longs and so require exceptional due diligence, which I feel
this article falls short on.


Here are two of my principal issues. First, the company has $10m in cash, versus a recent burn rate of about
$3.3m/yr net of stock issuance proceeds. So even if they were unable to access the capital markets and made no
efforts to economize, they'd still have enough cash to operate for 3 years. (To his credit, the author does say he
believes there is no "hard catalyst" for a stock price drop). It's safe to say that having survived 50 years, REFR will still
be around at least through 2017. So a short investor has to consider the possibility that in the meantime, REFR will
luck into some business opportunity that actually ends up justifying the stock price -- or more.


Second, it's taken them 50 years to get a product to market, sure, but a product they do now have. Despite the fact
that SPD glass now has a track record, the author makes no attempt to develop a bottom-up value on that product,
the company, or the stock. I will assist on that point: here's a back-of-the-envelope stab at valuing the MB sunroof fee
stream. In Q1, license fees were $308k, $145k of which apparently were non-one-time fees from MB. Annualize that
($580k) and assume $200 per sunroof in license fees; that implies 2900 SPD sunroofs are being installed per year.
MB sold 7k SL-class cars in 2013, for a take rate of 41%. S-class sold 13k units last year; assume a similar take rate
on those, and that's another $1.08m in fees per year perhaps starting in 2015. SWAG a take rate of 10% on the 70k
E-class cars sold in 2013, and that's $1.4m in (far more speculative) fees. Add that up ($3.06m), haircut it 20% for
uncertainty, and put a 20x multiple on what's left to account for a growth valuation, and you end up with a fee stream
with a potential value of $49m, or $2.12/share. (YMMV, of course). Add the .47/share in cash, and you're at about
$2.60, solely based on one license relationship plus the cash. Of course that's well less than $6 -- and it totally

ignores the cost side of the income statement -- but it does suggest there could be, finally, some fundamental value in
REFR and the SPD product.


Anyway, you don't have to believe in the promise of SPD glass to see that there are nevertheless considerable risks
to the short thesis on REFR. REFR is probably worth more than zero, management's efforts to dilute and confiscate
that value notwithstanding. REFR the company is not going to fall off a cliff tomorrow. And for the duration of your
short, management is trying their hardest to keep the stock afloat through a steady stream of sky's-the-limit press
releases. What you're left with is the worst kind of short: you know the stock should go down, but it's gonna be a very
long, anxiety-inducing grind before you get there, if ever. Again, I'm not saying the thesis won't prove out, but I for one
would rather be able to sleep well at night.

Yes, those sales figures are for MB USA only, I don't have the global figures. But if you assume that

The article keeps pointing out sales of products by REFR. REFR has never been the manufacturer of any SPD
products. Their timelines are contingent on the licensees. In the latest conference calls the focus is now on the
projections by the licensees and 2 years of getting revenues from Mercedes two models. So now that S-Class is
coming out, what will stop the royalty stream from growing. The company is in a different position this decade than the
last. Article just harps on the development and building of the infrastructure. There is no discussion of current and
expected revenues and the fact that Mercedes is making the call on how many and when.

You're quick to discuss SPD as if it were one simple technology, when there are 500 patents and patents
pending on this particle that involves complex physics in order to develop properties that the licensees can
use to develop new products. Land owned the first patent in the 1930s and couldn't make it work. That was
the daunting task for Bob Saxe, who is a brilliant physicist and highly regarded by others developing smart
technologies.


The company was brought public to fund the development and the success was tied to the licensees who
worked with the particle. This growth and development did take a number of decades, but Gentex's EC
technology was 40 years old when they first saw the benefit of putting on a rear view mirror.


Smart glass is a billion dollar industry and REFR has the only tech that you can own and share in the wealth.
That's why the longs in this stock find the arguments of the short position disingenuous. It's the licensees that
have always been the product developers. Early efforts were using a totally different generation of the
technology, that now has been used by Mercedes to develop an autoglass product that has the attention of
the entire luxury market. BMW has SPD in their concept vehicle and discuss it in brochures, ads, and has
shown it at auto shows. REFR CEO stated they are working with BMW and VW on their specific SPD smart

Volume over the last five sessions totals barely 40 percent of the 640K dumped in the in the two sessions following
the article's release. Yet the price has inched steadily higher and is now closer to $6 than to $5.76, the highest price
anyone shorted at during the mega-selloff.


Covering by new shorts? If so, they must be unhappy with the puny volume.


Or are institutions and longs slowly accumulating in anticipation of those September S-class coupe deliveries? MSC
roofs are being installed on those vehicles at an unspecified rate, and have been since production began on June 12,
one week before the article's publication.


RFI will receive payment for those roofs, and all those installed as of yesterday, by August 14. That money may not
show up in the Q2 earnings report. On the other hand, if the licensees pay earlier than the stipulated 45 days from the
end of the quarter, it might.


Doesn't matter, however, whether it's delayed until the November report. This article's attempt to force institutional
selling at the end of Q2 has fizzled dramatically, and making another one as September 30 approaches will be equally
ineffective. More MCS S-class models are in the pipeline for later this year and early next, and the E-class is hot on
their heels.


Lesson for new shorts? The market looks forward, not back.

Regarding projections, point me to a single one the company made in 1964, decades before it went public, or stop
your blathering about "50 years."


Also regarding projections, I'll take Mercedes' over yours any time, anywhere. And their projections are that MSC in
the S-class will succeed.


Here are a few U.S M-B dealers who can't wait to take delivery on the MSC-equipped S-class Coupe. Try peddling
your projections to them:


"Mercedes-Benz of Bellevue in Washington has a strong and committed sales staff with many years of experience
satisfying our customers' needs. Mercedes-Benz of Bellevue presents the innovative 2015 Mercedes-Benz S-Class
near Redmond. With the S-Class Coupe, it has shown that it can simultaneously create a wonderful design that still
looks unmistakably like a Mercedes... The interior comes almost directly from the S-Class sedan and features a
panoramic sunroof with Mercedes' Magic Sky Control dimming tech."


Keenan Mercedes, Doylestown, PA::


Innovation and Performance Only a Mercedes-Benz Can Offer


"The 2015 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe coming soon to Doylestown, PA features a standard panorama roof
extending over two-thirds of the entire vehicle roof.


Simply with the touch of a button, that same roof can be adjusted from dark to light settings depending on your driving
preference via MAGIC SKY CONTROL®."


Mercedes-Benz of South Charlotte, Charlotte, NC:


"As you might expect from a car of this status, the interior simply oozes style and luxury. Fitted to the very highest
standards, the S550 offers an array of advanced features to make life more comfortable for your passengers... Check
out the panoramic roof, as well, complete with MAGIC SKY CONTROL®, which allows you to adapt the transparency
of the surface according to the light and your mood. "


Mercedes-Benz of Lynnwood, Seattle, WA:


"This sporty two-door commands not only a striking, self-assured presence highlighted by refined appointments
you’ve come to expect from the S-Class.


Key Highlights


World's first active curve tilting function 
PRE-SAFE® Brake with Pedestrian Recognition 
PRE-SAFE® PLUS rear-end collision protection 
DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist 
BAS PLUS with Cross-Traffic Assist 
Active Lane Keeping Assist

As I post this, I see 21 on the bid at $5.90, 6 on the ask at $5.91 and an average hourly volume of less than 7K. I also
see one less day before those S-class Coupe deliveries start in September. My projection is that your projections
haven't convinced anyone but yourself.

you're trying to sell this failed technology because ONE manufacturer of automobiles is finally offering it to the

No one at REFR is "selling" the technology. They have licensing deals and now Mercedes is poised to put
them in the black for the first time since production started in 2011 with the SLK.


Mercedes started working in 2004 with the technology and now is offering it on 3 models. The company spent
90MM on development, it is NOT DEBT. Biotechs spend 10 times that amount and have substantial debt. The
author of this article presents a case that is false. There were no licensees that had mass production until
2011. Is that the fault of REFR? It was up to the licensees to do the heavy lifting and they were on their time
line.


As far as salaries, this is a very small management team and they have multiple tasks that are usually filled
by other people in a biotech company. Their aggregate salaries pale in comparison to a biotech. I'm willing to
wager that the author of this piece cannot find one company with NO DEBT, lower aggregate management
salaries, no "Cost of Revenue" because all that expense is carried by the licensees, and markets the size of
Mercedes Benz luxury cars that is almost 20 times their annual burn rate.

Yo-yo,


Didn't own the stock in the '90s, and I don't care what other investors who did thought at the time.


I'm looking at the S-class ( coupes, coming with MSC roofs installed, to dealers in Europe, China, India,
Australia, the OPEC countries and the U.S., not mention other places. That will be in September, less than
eight weeks from now.


Mercedes' stated intention was to make the new S-class "the best car in the world, " and they though SPD
would help. What do they know that you don't? They're also working with that "phony" company, RFI, to target
the dealerships with the highest potential demand for the roofs, ICYDK.


And people who buy S-class cars are people who would consider SPD technology for other uses, like their
private jets and million-dollar-view estates.


After the coupe arrives, I'll be looking at MSC roof on 5 other S-class variants, in sizes from 1.3 to 1.7 square
meters (14 to 18+ square feet, in my "equation") followed by the E-class, with reports of SPD-equipped
windows. They'll also be going to targeted dealers


BMW has been anything but bashful about touting their Cool Shade, and they didn't spend the money to
create it for fun. Vision Systems has opened an American facility to accommodate its growing demand for
SPD. They already have the HondaJet contract but that alone isn't enough to merit a factory. What do they
know that you don't?


I'm following with great interest the development of SPD display film. I see Hitachi is developing one. I also
see that the patent for Google glasses includes use of suspended particle device film. E-ink may have been
using SPDs in their E-readers for the past seven years, but I'm content to let the court or the companies
decide that. I've factored all of these potential developments into my investment decision, and I'm not the only
one watching them.


My "equation" is based on the present, not the past, because I live in the present. As developments warrant,
I'll refigure my "equation" and buy or sell. If one of those developments happens to be a squeeze, you and
your buddies have nobody but yourselves to blame.


Enjoy your Fourth!

anytime in the last 50 yrs you would, unfortunately for the stockholders, be correct.....Your quote: "there were
no licensees that had mass production until 2011"....well, seeing that REFR has had more licensees in the
last 50 yrs than there are grains of sand IN the ocean you gotta wonder WHY it wasn't mass produced.....I
mean if anybody really wanted to buy this stuff there was a licensee on every street corner on earth that could
have made you some.....you obviously jumped on the REFR bandwagon last week...you might want to stop
digging your own grave.........

I'd love to follow the development of spd display tech, but outside of an old (enthusiastic) MIT paper and
some even older press releases, news of said development has ceased, in all the regular channels anyway
(aka google). Please share!

USPTO patent search. Useful search terms, "suspended particle device," "smart glass,"head-mounted
display," "display device" and "film," licensee's names.


Search patent applications as well. You'll get the idea.

Yo-yo,


It's obvious you don't care about facts, but as I've already pointed out, RFI didn't exist 50 years ago. Do you even
know when it went public?


Grains of sand in the ocean??? A licensee on every street corner? Who's overstating things now?


For many investors, it makes sense that a company with RFI's business model would pursue multiple licensees
across multiple industries. That's what you do with a developing technology and the knowledge that not all licensees
will have the interest or resources to pursue SPD development over the long term. Eggs, basket?


If all the shorts believe your distortions concerning this stock, I'm in even better shape than I thought.

All the MSC-equipped S-class coupe sunroofs, and all the MSC-equipped S-class variants -- which will begin showing
up in targeted dealer showrooms around the world less than two months from today -- will have "sheets" of SPD.
They'll measure between 14 and 18 square feet, significantly larger than 2 by 2. A third-grader could figure it out.

You don't know when, or at what prices, I've been buying REFR, so stop hinting that you do. And stop insinuating that
the BOD members have been consistent sellers.


The present BOD's combined holdings currently stand at 1,230,932. Since 2005, current and past members, as well
as company officers, have reported purchases of 283,686 shares.


Their reported sells number during that time number 72,700, and 44,700 shares of those -- more than 61% -- were
private sales between BOD members and/or officers. That means only 28,000 shares went into the market where you
could have, but I'm betting didn't, bought them to cover part of your short position.

Just to clarify, RFI went public in 1986. The math (that a third grader could do) makes that 28 years, not 50 and not
30. Why should anyone trust the figures you keep spewing when you're too lazy, or lacking in the mathematical skills,
to get them right?

The S-class coupes with MSC roofs have been rolling off Mercedes' production lines since June 12, in preparation for
shipping to targeted dealers around the globe. Deliveries begin in September. Many of those dealerships are already
selling SLs or SLKs with MSC roofs. Here's what Loeber Motors outside Chicago has to say about theirs:


"Retractable Power Hardtop with MAGIC SKY CONTROL – Not only one of the top five features that make the SL-
Class near Chicago the perfect summer ride, but a feature that makes the SL-Class a drivable vehicle into the fall
months as well is the retractable power hardtop. With the push of a button the SL-Class goes from a sleek and
seductive coupe to a convertible that you cannot help but to stare at. When the roof is up, the MAGIC SKY CONTROL
feature allows you to electronically adjust the amount of tint and light the roof lets in for a custom ride."


Fletcher Jones in Newport Beach, currently with 15 MSC-equipped SL, SLK and SL63 AMG models, is also anxious
to get their hands on the coupe, as is FJ's Chicago operation. I found this out in five minutes of Internet searching,
just like a third grader could.


You thought you had an easy short. You might have had if you'd covered below $4. My advice to you is to stop
investing and repeat the third grade, where they'll also work on those ellipses.

view a nuclear explosion without the 'problem' inherent in a bit too much glare.....the research was relatively
successful........the problem was manufacturing this film in quantity and affordable.......ten million 'licensees' have tried
and failed to market and/or produce SPD affordably for at least 20 years......the company has been a total failure for
the investor........now they are singin the mercedes song....its more recycled hype...it goes like this: YADA, YADA,

Mercedes hasn't failed. The SLK and SL have added approx. 3 million+ to the coffers since 2011. That is the
beginning of mass production for REFR's SPD. What Land did and the following years of development of the
infrastructure are nice historical facts, but with $250 commission on the S-Class panoramic roof, it's not going
to take a lot of sales to make REFR profitable, no matter how long you measure.

Yo-yo,


World War II ended in 1945. In 1945, Bob Saxe was 11 years away from getting his A.B. degree from Harvard, and 20
years away from founding RFI as a private company. It was another 21 years before RFI received one dime of
shareholder money by going public. A third-grader could figure it out.

Saxe and the company's other physicists spent those first 20 years improving on Land's patents, the earliest of which
used a dispersion of heraphatite -- iodoquinine sulfate crystals -- that polarize light when exposed to a magnetic or
electrical current. One of Land's objectives was to use his dispersion in automotive visors and headlights as a way to
eliminate glare. He assigned that particular patent, #2,102,632, dated December 21, 1937, to the Sheet Polarizer
Company of Union City, New Jersey, but it was never commercially developed.


Here we are, 77 years later (a third-grader...) and Vision Systems is one of RFI's licensees preparing to market an
automotive sun visor with the SPD-film technology Saxe et al. invented to replace Land's heraphatite dispersion. The
Sheet Polarizer Company let Land down, but RFI, Hitachi and Vision Systems are carrying on just the same.


If you truly don’t understand how far RFI and its business model have advanced SPD technology since Land's days,
you’re in for a very rude wakening in a very short time.

Yo-yo,


What comapny has been running on hype for 77 years? That statement makes even less sense than the rest of your
drivel.


If, as you say, you're shorting REFR based on the revenues from the SL and SLK models, have you bothered to
determine what percentage of Mercedes models those cars constitute, along with size of their the SPD sunroofs?
Have you compared those figures to the percentage of Mercedes models the 2015 S-class variants will constitute,
along with the sizes of their different SPD sunroofs?


Have you informed yourself as to the estimated royalty for each kind of sunroof and multiplied those royalties by a
reasonable take rate based on projected numbers sales numbers for each model?


Oh, silly me! I'm sure you've done all those things. Just as I'm sure you have intimate knowledge of Saxe's weekly
food expenses.


77 years?

10 Jul 2014, 03:22 PM


namenottaken
Yo-yo,


Mercedes has made much of the information you question available. A third-grader could find the sizes of the MSC-
roofs on the SL, SLK and S-class variants.


A third-grader could also find what percentages of Mercedes' total production these models constituted.


A third-grader could easily find that RFI receives a royalty of 10 percent for each sunroof sold, that the royalty doesn't
come from Mercedes, and that it's not based on Mercedes' asking price.


Said third-grader could also find out that RFI knows exactly how much film Hitachi has been selling and to which
licensees they've been selling it. Said third-grader might discover that, in the Q4 conference call on which Bleecker
Street Research relied for much of their hatchet job, Joe Harary said that a estimated 50-percent take rate for the S-
class coupe's MSC roof was "not outlandish." Said third-grader might then see implications in the 50-percent figure
which have apparently escape you.


Finally, a really motivated third grader would wonder why Henry VIII, as King of England, needed to play the lottery
since all the proceeds would have technically belonged to the Crown. And would find out that England didn't have a
lottery until 1567, when Henry's daughter Elizabeth I needed to raise money so she could build ports for the country's
expanding trade. First prize was a combination of money, gold and silver plate, tapestries and linens. Elizabeth even
promised not to arrest any ticketholders wanted for misdemeanors. Tickets were 10 shillings.


Ain't that a hoot?

Gentex made millions taking a 40 year old technology and using it for their self-dimmable mirrors. What
difference does is make when the first suspended particle patent came out? You still had to find the
companies willing to take the risk. REFR has zero production responsibility. It's totally dependent on licensees
to move forward with product. If Mercedes S-Class has the take rates anticipated by Mercedes then they will
be paying REFR enough in royalties to make them profitable. Mercedes already has 3 models (4 if you count
the coupe) and the E-Class will be adding it on next year.


Royalties has always been on the end product. Now we have 1 automaker paying 80% of the royalties
collected since 2011. It's only going to grow from here.

Nice to know, because it gives me a target date to accumulate some more. Though I doubt if you'll drive it
down to my bid.


It's not the next round of quarterly earnings, due in August, that will tell the tale. It's the November report. You
know it, and I know it. That is, of course, unless the newswires mention a settlement with E-Ink before then.
We're a year into that litigation.


Or, who knows? An SPD-equipped production model from a second or even a third manufacturer may show
up at the Paris Auto Show beginning on October 4. That's where BMW introduced the Cool Shade last year. A
hint of things to come?


Vision Systems' plant in Florida is making SPD aircraft windows for their launch customer HondaJet. VS is
also in the late stages of developing an install-it-yourself sun visor for people who understand why that's a
good idea. I don't think it's good business practice to open an entire factory for only one customer, but what
do I know? I'll let the newswires weigh in.


You make another bear raid and short it down to my bid, and I'll buy. You don't, and I'll wait for any or all of the
above scenarios to play out and TCOB for me. This year or next, I can wait.

"Tier One autoglass companies. The top 5 are REFR licensees"...they have been for 30 years....as well as

RFI didn't sign their first licensee, GE, until 1995. As a third-grader would tell you, that's 18 years ago. They
signed their first autoglass company in 1996.


"Every other glass company ever listed on the NYSE?"


The NYSE started in 1817 as the New York Stock & Exchange Board (NYS&EB). Please provide the names
of its listed glass companies since that time.


"and they're all still trying to sell this stuff........so far no takers.." ?


"At their press conference this morning at the Detroit Auto Show, Daimler AG showed for the first time at any
international auto show the production version of the S600 V12, their flagship S-Class. This model as well
and other new variants of the S-Class which begin to come out later this year, will offer a panoramic roof with
the instantly dimming MAGIC SKY CONTROL feature which uses Research Frontiers’ SPD-SmartGlass
technology."


Here's a thought. What if REFR hit $40 in 2000 not because a long was buying, but because a short was
being bought in?


Enjoy your day!

Yo-yo,


Once again, you're trying to divert the focus of this discussion from the  
merits of the short position by making wild guesses about the investment strategies of those who disagree
with it.


Not a newbie, and not fooled by your complete misinterpretation of RFI's business model. The company's
sales, except for those of its VariGuard startup subsidiary --you do know there's a startup subsidiary, don't
you? -- come through its licensees.


And BTW, VariGuard's display cases are currently housing displays at the Smithsonian's National Postal
Museum Behind the Badge exhibit which opened on June 27. It showcases the efforts of the Postal
Inspection Service to stop postal fraud, among other things. A third-grader would have no difficulty performing
an online search and finding photos of the crowds of visitors who have now operated SPD-Smart glass while
viewing the displays.


Crowds of them every day since June 27 -- the National Postal Museum averages 30K visits per month,
according to the Smithsonian Newsdesk, and it's open every day except Christmas. The Behind the Badge
exhibit is slated to run indefinitely.


Still waiting for you to drive the price down to my bid, but I'm afraid we're running out of time. Another week
gone, and another week closer to those MSC-equipped S-class variants showing up on targeted Mercedes
showroom floors around the globe.


The first to arrive, in Spetember, will be the S-class coupes. I count 43 days until September 1, and I'm sure
third-graders everywhere would agree.


And you're right: RFI won't be selling a single one of those vehicles. No, they'll just be collecting a 10% cut of
each vehicle roof their licensee Pilkington or Asahi sells to their licensee Mercedes-Benz.

belonged to SA for a while, but only became motivated to participate in a message board after the B.S.
Research article.


I simply don't appreciate the methods short sellers employ to drive stock prices down when things aren't going
their way. If the idea of articulate investors who see through B.S.' BS bothers you, don't read my posts.


Any third-grader with an Internet connection could find the information I've posted, yet it continues to escape
Yo-yo, and apparently you. If you're too lazy to research all the aspects of a company before shorting its
stock, so be it.


But cheer up. If things go as I expect over the next year, my posts will decrease as the success of SPD
becomes obvious to anyone who isn't afraid to acknowledge it. Until then, I'll do what I can to keep the
discussion balanced.

"from a company with a neat product"


REFR doesn't produce a product. Mercedes Benz as a licensee has been working with REFR licensed film
production, glass companies and REFR to develop their Magic Sky Control technology. They have even filed for a
patent. This article explains the relationship. Bottom line is sales of Magic Sky Control in the three models currently
selling it as an option. There is reason to believe that Daimler sales will make REFR profitable. http://bit.ly/1qiv5yY
From article "The company has also been establishing a relationship with a $40B+ electronics giant in the automotive
and building automation industry that would also represent a potentially acquirer in the future. This partner is said to
have recently accompanied SPD in a meeting with Daimler, BMW and Audi in Germany to show its support to
manufacture SPD's electronics on behalf of major automakers."

REFR collects royalties on the products made by the licensees. Last year that total was 2.1MM


The addition of the S-Class to that number as well as BMW and Audi getting it in a production vehicle is more
than enough to make REFR a very profitable company.

You have a company, Research Frontiers, who went public to obtain funds to develop and license a nanotech,
"suspended particle device." Business model was to have the licensees develop and sell products and then to
collect the royalties from the net sale price of those products.


The 2.1 MM is from Daimler putting SPD-Smart roofs in the SL and SLK. The S-Class was just added and the
take rates are going to be higher and make REFR and their shareholders a lot of money.

Yo-Yo,


It seems to me that the ones obsessed with ancient history are you and the other shorts, who keep dragging
up the company's distant past to the exclusion of its present successes.


Then there's the future, which none of us has the ability to stop. You can twist the past to your heart's content,
but SPD's future will speak for itself. The difference between us is that I don't pretend to know what it will say.


I have, however made an educated guess based on significant research of the patents, demand and
competition, and placed my bets accordingly. All I read from you is biased gibberish of such slippery phrasing
that you should offer it to DuPont as Teflon replacement. Maybe then you'd make an honest buck.

Yo-yo,


We've been over this before. On July 5, to be exact, but your memory isn't the best, is it? Tor repeat:


"The present BOD's combined holdings currently stand at 1,230,932. Since 2005, current and past members, as well
as company officers, have reported purchases of 283,686 shares.

Their reported sells number during that time number 72,700, and 44,700 shares of those -- more than 61% -- were
private sales between BOD members and/or officers. That means only 28,000 shares went into the market where you
could have, but I'm betting didn't, bought them to cover part of your short position."


If you're the mathematical genius you want me to believe you are, here's a problem I'd like solved:


Given that RFI's BOD and officers have only sold 28K shares in the open market over the past 9 years, what are the
odds that of the millions of shares of REFR traded in that time, every one of those 28K went to "newbie stockholders"
with "dreams of cashing a big ticket?" I'd say they are vanishingly small, just like the strength of your logic, but you're
the math whiz.


Don't you just hate it when you short a stock expecting the insiders to sell so you can cover, and they don't?

"The present BOD's combined holdings currently stand at 1,230,932. Since 2005, current and past members, as well

Let's update those figures.


Jul 18, 2014 KAGANOWICZ ALEXANDER Director 3,000  
Direct Purchase at $5.59 per share 
Value $16,770


Total shares purchased by BOD/ company officers since 2005, now 286,686.


Total they've sold in the open market remains at 28K. A third grader tells me that's more than ten shares purchased
for every one share sold.


But you're the math whiz.

Yo-yo,


So now you tell us that you've been to all the glass conventions in the past 30 years, just to keep track of how
many and which glass companies were in attendance at each one?


Your DD humbles me.


"you fail to mention that the 2.1 million you tout as "revenue" wouldnt cover executive compensation for 2
weeks"


Regarding compensation: total for RFI executives Saxe, Harary, van Voorhees, Slovak and LaPointe in 2013,
including salaries, bonuses, and options and stock distributions:


$3,354,627  
or $64,512.05 per week, or 
$129,024.11 per 2 weeks.


$2.1 million divided by 2 = $1,050,000 every 2 weeks.


Go find a third grader and ask which is greater:


a) $129, 024.11


or


b) $1,050,000


If said third grader answers "b)", hire the little tyke to advise you on your investments, because you could
certainly use the help.

" "5 Guys" who are paying themselves more money than they have revenue coming in from a few sheets of plastic on
top of a few mercedes....."


Yo-yo,


As I posted on this board less than two weeks ago , RFI knows exactly how much SPD film its licensee Hitachi is
selling to its licensees Pilkington and Asahi to put in the MSC roofs on its licensee Mercedes-Benz' S-class variants.
Joe Harary has publicly stated that a 50 percent MSC take rate on those S-class variants isn't "outlandish."


Car buyers are grabbing the new S-class so quickly that the number sold in the first half of this year -- ending June 30
-- more than doubled that of last year. Mercedes has hired temporarily workers to keep the production lines moving
during the traditional July vacation period, and the S-class production lines are operating over capacity. This is from
Dieter Zetsche, Mercedes' CEO, as of yesterday.


Last year, Mercedes sold 71,400 S-class vehicles. If they maintain the current 2014 pace, they'll sell more than 140K.
If 25 percent, or 35K, have MSC roofs with an average $200 royalty, that's $7 million to RFI.


I don't pretend to be certain about MSC take rates or royalties. I am certain that the S-class is a single group of
vehicles from from a single manufacturer, that Mercedes is taking dead aim on BMW and Audi's market share of the
luxury vehicle market, and that they think MSC will help them achieve that goal.


I'm also thinking that your short position has you in a genuine SNAFU. Look it up.

has been talkin about for around 30 years.........and the take rate on those sunglasses..........and those train
windows..........and those commercial buildings ..........and homes...........and planes...........and boats..........and when
you're done with your due diligence then check out REFR's chart.........then wrap that bungee cord around your neck

Easy, gymsock. You're hard enough to read without the violent imagery.


We're all here just having a laugh. Do what you want with refr -- by all means, short away. Bash away! The
lower this stock goes in the interim (the time between now and it blowing a hole in the automotive market), the
cheaper it is for those of us who want to buy in.


I don't bring the good stuff like nnt (props), but my vision is clear on this one. For months (years?) I've been
searching for a way refr could fail and I haven't found one. Don't babble about corporate governance and sun
visors, just give me one reason, short of catastrophe, why rfi will not enjoy success in the auto industry. Or
with Mercedes. Or with the S-Class. Even the least of these goals makes it a profitable company, as you've
heard many times. (You claim to have been hearing it for 50 years, which I doubt.)


Assuming 1. MSC will be popular in the S-Class (go to mbforums.com and see what the people who buy the
cars have to say, or I'll save you the time: they like it, a lot, simple as that, and that is a small window in a
small car), and 2. MSC won't fail technically (extensive testing, no reported failures, yada), we've got a
reliable product that people want to buy. What will stop them? You tell me. So far the best you lot have come
up with is that this has been expected for years (meaningless) and that it is too blue (is it?). See if you can do
better.

Buyerp,


I don't think B.S. Research expected to generate a continuing debate on the merits of their "research report."
It's telling that only two avowed shorts, Yo-yo and New Capital, have acknowledged any of my posts. Not a
peep from B.S.


The handwriting is all over Wall Street on this one, but research and reading comprehension don't rank high
on the shorts' list of skill sets. I'd still like to see a second film manufacturer, or a Hitachi film-production facility
well away from earthquake-and-tsunami zones, but that will happen over time.


The shorts may be attempting to stockpile cheap shares for boxing if the price surges on good news in next
month's Q2 report. IMO, the real test will come with the November report. It should give us all a much clearer
view of the future.

Your criticisms smack of his initial attack on REFR. He's been banned from the industry but several short
sellers still invoke his pieces on REFR.


You failed to address the fact that REFR doesn't make products but licenses companies to use SPD and then
collect royalties. Why would you accuse REFR of not selling products, when they are not the ones paying for
the testing and manufacturing, marketing and sales.


As far as the float, it is small and using stock offerings to raise capital is what publicly held companies do.
Their income has risen over 2000% from the last decade. All that seems lost on you. I think this was an
orchestrated hit piece to help the current short position pass it on to more naive investors.

SPD is not a "product." It's a nanotechnology that can be made into film for glass and other composites, but
also used in E-Paper, electronic shelf pricing in stores.


You have the automotive industry licensees that have put a lot of work into engineering the panoramic roof
coming out on the S-Class.


Your statement implies there is ONE product, when in fact there are several available in aerospace, and
Magic Sky Control in automotive. The addition of the S-Class has made BMW and Audi look at the
competition they will face and are working with REFR in the development of their singular products.


Magic Sky Control has been sold to thousands of SL and SLK owners. Now with S-Class you can see the fee
income triple to 6-8 million by the end of 2015 according to analyst following REFR. This is a given seeing the
commitment Daimler has made. That's who should have researched and you would be able to extrapolate
how many owners add the Magic Sky Control.


So global acceptance has happened. SPD is the largest selling smart technology for view. Now investors can
sit back and reap the rewards of growing royalties, which will come back to investors in the form of dividends.

$6 to $8 million. It does sound a bit optimistic to me, but let's take the largest number, just for fun.


It works out to less than $0.28 a share. Hardly worth writing home about.


Remember, there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip. And REFR has always managed to slip up before.


I think the article is spot on. REFR could fall substantially if expectations are not met. Since expectations are
so high, I believe it could fall dramatically.

24292333
Once REFR achieves profitability the bottom line goes back to shareholders. The company does not have to
pay for the product development, testing or marketing so $0.28 does not need to be kept by the company to
cover the 5MM it takes to operate. The amount of revenue will be a constant upside yearly. Analyst believes it
will be 30% a year. There is nothing on the downside. It barely trades 30K a day and almost 40% is held by
insiders, funds and institutions. The float is only 19MM, so if 40% of that is locked up in strong hands you
have very little available to cover a misguided short position.

me. (I am assuming you are the only Canadian farmer in the thread. ;))

"cure for a disease???"


In case you haven't let it sink in , Mercedes Benz is the licensee, along with the film and emulsion licensees that will
put money in REFR coffers. That's the smartest move since all royalties are on the end product, not the film produced,
but the FULL NET SALE PRICE of the SL, SLK and now S-Class. Mercedes is the company touting their Magic Sky
Control and expecting a high take rate on the S-Class. The royalty stream has begun. Those monies will build on
each other and won't go away as each new model (whether it's BMW, Audi or Mercedes) but add on to the one
before. Do you expect Mercedes NOT to expand Magic Sky Control to the upcoming redesign of Mercedes E-Class?
If so, state your reasons, your income projections rather than your ramblings, which make no sense to the automotive
smart glass sector.

glass conventions for over 20 yrs.........they have been demonstrating spd film for over 50 years.........in fact Sharper
Image tried to sell this stuff 15 yrs ago.....(oops, they went bust)........."


The company was collecting royalties before it had licensees? Not incorporated until 1986, and no products licensees
until Glaverbel signed on in 1995, remember? How'd that work?


RFI's first attempt at an SPD film wasn't patented until 1992, 22 years ago. Their researchers tweaked it for another 3
years before licensing GE to manufacture it in 1995. GE never followed through, but RFI's film licensee Hitachi began
working on what's evolved into the currently commercialized films used in Mercedes' Magic Sky Control in 1999. So
whatever film you think was demonstrated before 1992 wasn't connected to RFI.

Regarding Sharper Image: Are you referring to their collection of patents for air purifiers citing the 1908 patent "Art of
separating suspended particles from gaseous bodies?" That's patent US 895729 A.


If so, can you explain how the process of using electrical currents to remove particles "such as smoke, fo dust, mists,
etc." from unspecified gases is connected to using a electrical current to align pigments suspended in liquid and
encased in film so they polarize light? There are particles of dust suspended in the beam of sunlight streaming though
my window, but that doesn't mean I'll be selling them to RFI any time soon.


Whatever Sharper Image products you meant, SI was never licensed to use RFI's SPD technology. You clearly don't
understand what that technology is, however, so I'll cut you some slack.


But I'm still scratching my head over how anyone would short a company, or even worse, encourage others to short it,
without knowing what that company does.

nameguy you dont have a clue.........sharper image had a deal with refr to "talk" up the installation of spd
windows to the home market........never went anywhere.........neither did sharper image.........its interesting
that the only commercial retail outlet that was pushing this stuff went bust soon after.........i guess it didnt help
that you needed to spend around $45,000 to install spd on the average home.........while you could do the
same home in shades for around $5,000.........same problem exists with the auto market..........a sliding sheet
of plastic is free..........even the very wealthy like free........which is why my son pointed out that its really neat
but he doesnt need it............and dont tell me i dont understand the technology.........its been around for many
years.......i've seen it at every glass convention in the world for those same many years........its really neat but
i dont need it.........and based on 30 years of sales nobody else does either..........

That was the whole purpose of this articles ridiculous accusations. They can't cover many shares when
there's no volume. The stock price went right back up after the article was available to the public.


This web site makes it crystal clear that SPD is licensed for companies to use in their own SPD-Smart
products. REFR then collects 10-15% on the net sale price of those products.

Yo-yo,


"..sharper image had a deal with refr to "talk" up the installation of spd windows to the home market.."


And you know this because..........? (Oh, dear, I think they're contagious!)


"same problem exists with the auto market..........a sliding sheet of plastic is free."


And S-class buyers, of course, love to impress their pals with sliding sheets of plastic.


Mercedes is expanding, not decreasing, their use of the technology because they see expanding, not
decreasing demand for it. What do they know S-class buyers that you don't?


"and dont tell me i dont understand the technology.........its been around for many years.......i've seen it at
every glass convention in the world for those same many years........"


No, you haven't. RFI's SPD-Smart glass, and its licensees' versions of the same, didn't exist in 1984. Sorry,
but that's just the way it is.


RFI first exhibited SPD products at the NGA Glass Show in Miami in 2001. The first licensee to exhibit a
product of any kind using RFI's technology at a show was InspecTech Aeroservice from May 31 to June 3 of
2001, at the Aircraft Interiors Conference and Exhibition in Long Beach, CA. That's if you don't count the
"sneak preview" they held for aviation industry professionals at their own Fort Lauderdale facility on May 25.


I hate to think of you wasting all that money going to all those shows between 1984 and 2001, thinking you
were seeing SPD glass. I also hate to think that you have continued to attend shows since 2001 where you
actually did see SPD glass, and couldn't tell the difference between it and whatever you were looking at
before.


I'm guessing you could have seen electrochromic glass from Sage, LBL or possibly Saint Gobain, but that's
just a guess. You could also have seen liquid crystal privacy glass, from a number of manufacturers. Both are
easily distinguishable from SPD. The first from its extremely slow switching time, and the second because it
changes clear glass to milky white.


Mercedes actually used LC membrane in the switchable glass roof on their Maybach 62S. Interestingly, to me
at least, they're now transferring the Maybach name to their largest 2015 S-class variant, and ditching the LC
roof for an optional MSC one. Ain't that a hoot?


But it's your money and your time. At least you've been able to see the world.

That is their main product, they don't even have SPD windows on their office building.


If you were going to sell SPD windows to architectural markets, would you fail to install the windows you were trying to
sell others on your own building?

Grendelbane,


As may have been pointed out elsewhere on this thread, and is definitely pointed out in RFI's SEC filings, the
company leases its office space. It's up to the building's owners to install whatever windows suits their
purposes.

I have heard the "company leases its office space" argument for over a decade now.


The vast majority of people would expect to see the specialized windows in the office of a company
selling/promoting/lice... specialized windows. They would consider it extremely suspicious not to see them there.


There are many companies who have leased buildings in my area. They are not shy about making changes. Building
owners will indeed work with them to help them get whatever they need. Leased property is remodeled all of the time.


Windows are not permanent installations. The argument that the owners of the building need to do this simply doesn't
hold water. If REFR really wanted to promote architectural SPD windows, they would have them in their building.

again, well stated by grendelbane.......and, in fact, refr has had around 40 years to find a new building or build

31 Jul 2014, 12:11 PM

Grendelbane,


Per Emily Lambert of Forbes Magazine, Bob Saxe asked to have SPD windows put into the 240 Woodbury
headquarters in 2003 as part of the lease negotiations. If they aren't there, it's not because RFI doesn't want them.


The lease was renegotiated on February 21 and remains in effect until March 31, 2025. Whether the new terms
include installation of the SPD windows at some future point, I don't know. Neither do you.


BTW, did you see Daimler's PR from earlier today concerning the S-500 hybrid? It's hitting targeted dealerships --
along with the S-class coupe -- in September, and as a third-grader could tell us, September begins 32 days from
today. Both models have panoramic roofs with optional Magic Sky Control.


A third grader could also answer this without much difficulty: Which benefits RFI's shareholders more? Getting SPD
windows in a 9,500 square foot office and research facility, or getting its SPD technology into Daimler's flagship S-
class models, with the much larger E-class not far behind?


Daimler didn't let the lack of SPD windows at 240 Woodbury stop them. What do they know that you don't?


31 Jul 2014, 11:28 AM


grendelbane
Long term, I suspect that not having SPD windows in REFR's office building has cost them way more than
any royalties Mercedes will pay in the next half dozen years.


Over a decade ago I took an unscientific survey of people, I asked them if they would invest in a company
pushing specialty windows if they didn't have those special windows on their office building. 100% said no.
These were people across all walks of life. Last year, I repeated the survey, with a different set of people.
100% said they would not invest in such a company.


Appearances are important. I view the lack of SPD windows at REFR headquarters as a bad move. I suggest
looking at a long term chart of REFR, to see what I am speaking about.

What is better than SPD glass at Hitachi Chemical's headquarters. REFR headquarters has several examples of
current SPD capabilities on architectural glass, including a glass that changes as you move toward it. It uses a motion
sensor like offices use for lights.


But those companies that want to use SPD glass can go to Hitachi website or smartglass.com (REFR's website) and
see the many uses. REFR management is constantly flying all over the world to meet with companies and to be
involved in their development of SPD products. The licensees also spread the word at trade shows and now on
aircraft - Dassault, Honda, Mercedes.


The downside is ZERO. The SPD industry is run by licensees and has ramped up to where royalty payments starting
this year will give REFR a profitable quarter, then a profitable year and royalty payments will go up exponentially and
be given back to investors in dividends. That is the 2014 reality.


31 Jul 2014, 03:09 PM


namenottaken
"SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THE LESSOR DIDNT WANT THAT CRAP ON THE WINDOWS"


Yo-yo,


I don't presume to know what motivates the decisions of people I've never met.


Perhaps the lessor didn't want switchable windows limited to one part of the building, and the company didn't
want to pay to install them on the entire edifice. Perhaps RFI's executives think there are more profitable
ways to spend their time and money, especially because they know the automotive market is the most
lucrative one for SPD for the foreseeable future. If so, I agree.


Why not visit the lessor of 240 Crossways directly, instead of guessing at his or her motivations?

"So definitely not a new technology and REFR has been pushing it for ages."


REFR & Hitachi Chemical have developed new generations of SPD, well protected by over 500 patents and patents
pending.


Mercedes had SPD-smartglass on two roadsters, now its on the flagship S-Class and BMW & Audi have shown it in
concept cars. It's the licensees who market it, not REFR. Sales of S-class and take rates for SPD-Smartglass roof are
expected to be much more than the roadsters. Also the E-Class is being redesigned for 2016 & will likely add Magic
Sky as an option. At a 100% take rate, Mercedes luxury represent a 94MM annual income. REFR would be profitable
if they got a 5% take rate. REFR verified that a 50% take rate for the S-Class was not "outlandish." This is just one
sector, automotive, which alone will make REFR extremely profitable since costs won't go over 5MM. It's a no-brainer.


01 Aug 2014, 06:14 PM

uh-oh........its the "NEW GENERATION" spd...........wow........ ??............to be mathematically correct (as well
as to instruct the name and number newbies) i would have to guess that after 30 years worth of updates, its

02 Aug 2014, 12:28 PM


24292333
Here is the description of income from the Q3 2013 conference call:


"First let’s talk about new vehicle platform. The best way to describe our business is that we’re in a step function
business. We get on a vehicle platform then the next one, then the next one. Each platform tends to be long-term
production programs. In addition to being relatively long-term revenue stream, these revenue streams build on each
other. They usually start when a new car is redesigned, which typically happens within the core model every seven to
eight years. Because each revenue stream builds on each other, while the new model introduction events and this is
the thing that is typically announced by the OEMs and then by us and our licensees. My resemble is set of stairs,
where we refer to it as the step function.


But the revenues themselves resemble more of a steep upward ramp, because they’re building on each other. In
terms of revenues and roof size, the Mercedes SLK and SL are similar, which is why this year our revenues are
similar to last year. However, what’s going on underneath the numbers is more exciting. Normally the number of costs
produced in the later years of a model are less than in the initial years. So the total number of SLK and SL vehicles
being produced each year Mercedes is scheduled to go down. owever, offsetting this is our take rates are going up.
Magic Sky Control is a very popular option and also one that has received growing accolades from the Automotive
and Lifestyle Press. Timing of new model introductions is also accelerating. The SLK came out in showrooms about
two years ago. The SL came out here in the United States about 18 months ago. And based upon the success that
Mercedes was having with Magic Sky Control in these two vehicles with take rates higher than Mercedes ever
originally anticipated. Three months ago, it was announced that all -- the all new S-Class was going to offer a Magic
Sky Control SPD-SmartGlass roof as an option.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2276223-research-frontiers-shares-could-fall-substantially-if-sky-high-expectations-are-not-met 62/63


Two months ago, it was also announced that SPD-SmartGlass technology will be on the panoramic roof of the new S-
Class Coupe, which many people will say is actually the fourth car to use SPD-SmartGlass because the S-Class
Coupe is basically a CL that has been redesigned and renamed.


So there you can see -- so you can see that while we’re in a step change type of business, the steps are clearly
accelerating. Also the step-ups are getting bigger. The new S-Class is now projected to have about three times the
annual production volume of the SL and SLK’s combined. The surface area of the roof is also about three times
bigger than the glass roofs on the SLK and the SL roadsters.


So in total, when you combine anticipated unit volumes with higher surface areas, there is the potential to have at
least nine times as much SmartGlass out there on the roads with the S-Class than there is with the SLK and the SL
vehicles combined. Also Mercedes people who understand their S-Class customer expect even higher take rates for
Magic Sky Control with the new S-Class.


And some of the good position to know even expect unprecedented annual sales volumes for the new S-Class. As
early as the Frankfurt Auto Show in Early September, Mercedes announced that they already had orders for the
30,000 S-Class’s and how with even before the launch of the car and the two biggest markets in the world for the S-
Class, the United States and China. And higher unit volumes and greater surface areas and take rates are certainly
important to Research Frontiers, because remember we get our 10% royalty based on the selling price of the glass
from the licensee to the car manufacture.


But I think also equally significant is the fact that we were going from roadsters which is a relatively small and
specialized market for the mainstream automotive market sedan. This shift towards sedan is also likely to bring other
OEMs more quickly into production with their own SPD-SmartGlass products. We are already noticing the highly
positive effect on the other automakers that we’re working with as a result the Mercedes launch of SPD in their S-
Class flagship sedan.


This too should lead to more and bigger steps as other OEMs introduce their own vehicles using SPD-SmartGlass.
Remember as we discussed in earlier conference calls and at our various Investor conferences, we also spoke about
another potentially large step-up and penetration, this time within Daimler itself with the much larger volume E-Class
coming out in 2015-2016.


The one key thing to understand as you try to model our business, the business itself is expected to continue to
accelerate with the next big impact on revenues coming from the use of SPD-SmartGlass in the S-Class when this
option becomes available around the second half of next year. And as I mentioned we expect that in our all important
automotive business this success within Daimler will create other successes within other OEMs as they launch their
own vehicles with SPD-SmartGlass.


The trend with SPD being on other vehicle platforms is also been showing up in other areas as well. As I discussed
the biggest and most exciting by far in terms of numbers with the introduction over the past three months of SPD-
SmartGlass in Mercedes flagship, the S-Class which is the best selling luxury vehicle in the world and then
introduction on the successor to the CL, the S-Class Coupe. But there have been other vehicle platforms that have
also began to use SPD."

Fan of Kevin Douglas. His commitment to REFR speaks volumes. Does his homework and looks at future
income to determine what a stock is worth. He's gone from 5% owner to over 11%.


Automotive sector is just one market, but has gotten the ball rolling. Old and new investors alike can read
about how many SL, SLK and S-Class cars are sold in prior years and then calculate how much of a take rate
does it require to surpass the 5MM annual costs. Third quarter will be our first look at those numbers. The
next step will be an announcement of either the E-Class offering MSC as an option or another auto
manufacturer such as BMW announcing an spd glass product in one of their production models.


The window to cover short positions is closing. Volume has all but dried up. This is the decade of SPD-auto
and SPD-aero. Lots more news will be coming out as this starts to take off.

on all three counts, and meaningless to the progress of SPD. As I said in an earlier post, the November Q3 report will
