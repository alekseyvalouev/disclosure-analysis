Lannett: Citron Exposes the Lawsuits 


that will Wipe Out the Equity  
Citron Explains Clearly Why:    


 Lannett will be the First Pharma Company to go Bankrupt 


amid Continuing Drug Pricing Scrutiny  


 If Even Modest Price Cuts Hit Either of Lannett’s Cash 


Cow Drugs, It Will Violate Its Debt Covenants 





$13-$15 Near Term Target 
Equity Worthless Over Long-Term 





Over the past year, almost every media outlet in the US has dissected the 
pharmaceutical industry to expose the culprits of rampant opportunistically 
driven price gouging.  We are now well past that point.  The next question 
investors will have to ask is: 
 
“Which companies will collapse under their debt load from levered acquisitions, 


based on the assumption of endless unrestrained drug price increases?” 
 


The one company standing out most starkly is Lannett (NYSE:LCI).   While Valeant, 
Mylan, and Horizon have multiple product lines across numerous specialties, 
Lannett is heavily leveraged, and extremely dependent on the profit windfall from 
just a few of its drugs to generate enough revenue to service its debt load.   
 


In the past month we have seen a series of lawsuits against Lannett that Wall 
Street has completely overlooked.  These lawsuits, along with the Trump
Citron Comments on Lannett January 17, 2017 Page 2 of 12 





administration's dedication to confront indiscriminate drug price raises, 
illuminates a clear path to 0 for the equity of Lannett. 
 
In this story Citron will explain these 4 essential points 
 
1. Explain the dependence of Lannett’s business on only three products (most 


heavily reliant on just one). 
2. Reference NEW COURT DOCUMENTS showing conclusively that Lannett has 


indeed conspired to fix drug pricing. 
3. Illustrate the effect of price competition on generic drugs – through Lannett's 


own product mix 
4. Provide a sensitivity analysis projecting how Lannett WILL become insolvent 


if and when it is forced to take modest price reductions 
 


Lannett’s product mix chart is the foundation of this story.

Citron Comments on Lannett January 17, 2017 Page 3 of 12 





Notice the drugs that this business is based on  


 Thyroid Deficiency – Levothyroxine (Levo) (#1 revenues by far) 


 Anti Psychosis – Fluphenazine (Fluph) (#2 revenues) 


 Cardiovascular (Digoxin) (#3 revenues)  
 


These 3 drugs are responsible for over 43% of Lannett's gross revenue...and a 
disproportionate share of its net revenues!  





Lannett lives and dies on the price of Levothyroxine (Levo). 
 


Levo is generic Synthroid, which is the second most prescribed generic drug in the 
United States.  Whereas most generic drug prices are destined to drift lower, Levo 
prices are approximately 200-300% higher than they were in 2013.  Although 
there are some smaller competitors, the two real players for Levo are Lannett and 
Mylan. 
 
In November of 2016, Bloomberg reported that Lannett, amongst other 
companies, received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding 
generic drug pricing collusion:  





U.S. Charges in Generic-Drug Probe to Be Filed by Year-End 
 


https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/u-s-charges-in-generic-drug-probe-said-to-be-filed-by-year-end 
 
Wall Street took notice of this Bloomberg news coverage, and sent Lannett stock down to $17. 
 


But what happened in the following two months has gone 
unnoticed by Wall Street ... Until Now... 


It's easy to dismiss Citron coverage as "biased", but it's denying reality to dismiss 
the data from the lawsuits filed against Lannett in the last month. The case for 
price fixing Levo was presented by not just one but TWO lawsuits ... filed in just 
the past month. 
 


Let's start here, with a glimpse into the basic pricing charts for Levo over the past 
3 years, as presented in one of the lawsuits currently pending against Lannett.  
Are we to believe that these prices were not fixed?

Just two of many charts in the National Benefit Fund vs Lannett and Mylan class action complaint filed 12/14/2016. NBF is one 


of the strongest labor management funds in the nation. 


/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/National-Benefit-Fund-Class-Action-Complaint-Collusion-Against-Lci.pdf 


Just two weeks later, on December 28, the Rochester Drug Co-operative, one of 
the nation’s fastest growing healthcare distributors, filed a similar lawsuit against 
Lannett accusing them of price fixing the price of Levo. 


/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rochester-vs-Lannett-Complaint.pdf 


 
Both of these lawsuits (especially the Rochester Drug Co-op suit) do an amazing 
job detailing the roadmap of what the Department of Justice is undoubtedly 
finding while investigating Lannett.   
 
Collusion on price hikes is beyond question.  These lawsuits are better than a 
smoking gun: they are DNA evidence and nothing short of a confession.   
 
Lannett's CEO has actually bragged about raising prices and is now worried about 
competitors: 
 





“Mylan is one of those rational competitors, so we’re not really 
expecting anything crazy from them.” 


-- Arthur Bedrosian, Lannett CEO

The price of Levo and the future of Lannett will be sealed on of these 4 inevitable 
events. 


1. Competitors lowering pricing amongst current scrutiny 
2. Lannett is forced to eliminate the price increases over the past 2 years 
3. Another generic enters the Levo market, which is inevitable at these prices 
4. Lannett cannot possibly sustain their Levo supply agreement at current 


terms.  This distribution deal, which expires in 2019, will either fall due to 
price fixing, or be dramatically repriced.  The gravy train ends, either way. 





Lannett’s second largest drug last quarter was Fluphenazine (Fluph).  


In what some would call the ultimate demonstration of “chutzpah” Lannett raised 


the price on this newly acquired drug schizophrenia drug by 1900% in the middle 


of 2016 ... amidst the middle of the drug pricing scrutiny storm.    


Arthur Bedrosian: 
No you didn't….yes you did….no you didn’t….yes you did. 





“You mean after I sent them the thank you note?”  


He continued: “So whenever people start acting responsibly and raise 


prices as opposed to the typical spiral down of generic drug prices, I’m 


grateful. Because Lannett tends to be active in raising prices.”

These two Forbes articles written this year do a good job of describing this 


egregious behavior…they also expose the CEO’s fake (mail order) degree and 


former tax problems.

maker-stock-plunge-on-news-of-escalating-federal-pricing-probe/#3ae43d321dcc 





Why did they raise the price of the Fluph 1900% in a year?  Not because they 
wanted to, but that had to!  Lannett acquired the rights to Fluph in their 
untimely, hideously mispriced 2015 acquisition of Kremers, which closed just 
weeks after the now infamous “Hillary tweet”.  
 


In a move that can only be understood as reflecting complete desperation, 
Lannett submitted its bid for Kremers without a Material Adverse Events Clause 
in their contract.  They bought Kremers for $1.3 billion, despite Kremers just 
having lost their largest customer, primarily due to  the FDA’a ruling about 
declassification of their generic Concerta…the customer had accounted for close 
to 40% of Kremers’ EBITDA before that ruling. 
 
After leveraging up Lannett as far as it could be stretched to fund the acquisition, 
the only thing left to do was what they know best: – gouge pricing on the 
remaining drug.  Note this Kremers acquisition was the turning moment where 
they company acquired debt and rose to its highest level of incompetence. 
 


"Cardiovascular Drugs" = Digoxin 


The third highest revenue drug in Lannett’s portfolio is Digoxin.  Below is a chart 
of pricing of generic Digoxin.

Velardi vs Lannett & Others -- Class action suit.  





/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Velardi-vs-Lannett-Class-Action-complaint.pdf

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/widespread-drug-price-increases-point-to-collusion-study-finds 
 
 


“According to Lannett, "Irrational Competitors" were those who competed on 
price in order to obtain market share,” NECA-IBEW said. “The statement is a signal 
that Lannett understood that Impax, Par and Mylan, among others, were no 
longer interested in competing on price, an understanding that could only exist if 
the three firms had reached a consensus on how to price.” 


https://www.law360.com/articles/776335/generic-cos-face-another-antitrust-suit-over-drug-prices 


It does not take an antitrust attorney to understand that chart is a detailed map 
of what price fixing looks like. That is why in November of 2016, Bloomberg 
reported that the DOJ is investigating Lannett and other for price fixing Digoxin.  
What CEO Bedrosian might consider in his words a “rational competitor” quickly 
turns into a "co-conspirator" when this pattern is exposed.

Gallstone Segment 
 


Look at what happens when someone doesn't collude.  The revenue breakdown 
shows a steep decrease in the price of the generic, as natural market forces keep 
prices in trim.  
 


Lannett's gall bladder medicine Ursodiol is a likely "tell" for the stock after the 
effects on larger drugs follow the pattern.  Lannett said that the price of its 
gallstone medicines, including Ursodiol, rose by 907% in the year ended June 30, 
2015, adding $58.7 million to sales.  More important than sales: all price 
increases go right to the bottom line. 
 


 But now that competition has showed up, revenues for Lannett's gall bladder 
segment fell by 35%.  (Green highlight in the revenue segment table, page 2, 
above.)  This vulnerability for the rest of Lannett's portfolio is obvious.

OK, Wall Street- This is Where the Rubber Hits the Road:  
Citron Does The Work to Show Lannett's Path to Bankruptcy! 
 


Lannett has the clearest path to bankruptcy in the pharmaceutical industry.  
 


We worked out the financial scenario to show that if Lannett had to roll back 
pricing to where it was just 2.5 years ago, the company would violate their debt 
covenants ... and go bankrupt! 
 
Citron did some digging into LCI’s debt covenants, which require LCI to not exceed 
a 4.25x Net Debt / EBITDA covenant through 12/31/17 (which then moves lower 
from there): 
 


“Two years ago, ursodiol’s wholesale price was as low as 45 cents a 
capsule. Then in May 2014, generic drug manufacturer Lannett Co. hiked 
its price to $5.10 per capsule, and one by one its competitors followed 
suit – with most charging nearly the same price. 
Experts say this is not how a competitive marketplace is supposed to 
work.”

10-Q  Sept 2016 





By shedding only ~$81M of EBITDA, Lannett would trip its current 
debt covenant today 
 


Citron estimates that Levothyroxine and Fluph have produced ~$157M of excess 
contribution margin since FY 13 (Levo) and FY 16 (Fluph).   If LCI loses just 51% of 
that excess contribution margin, they trip the debt covenant.   
Another way to look at it: 
 
Based on 10-K disclosures, Levothyroxine price increases alone added ~$78M to 
revs/EBITDA from FY 13 through FY 16.  Therefore, if Levo prices alone go back to 
FY 13 levels, Lannett's financials go right to the edge of violating the debt 
covenant ($78M of EBITDA lost vs. $81M needed to violate covenant).  This is 
without Digoxin or Fluph. 
 
At these price levels, Lannett would no longer generate cash.  This would likely 
accelerate their tumble toward restructuring.  
 
Here are several alarming scenarios we modeled out as to what would happen to 
LCI’s leverage ratios if their key drugs are even reduced slightly in price: 
  


The Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a financial performance covenant that is triggered when 


the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit as of 


the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter is greater than 30% of the aggregate commitments under the 


Revolving Credit Facility.  The covenant provides that Lannett shall not permit its first lien net senior secured 


leverage ratio as of the last day of any four consecutive fiscal quarters (i) from and after December 31, 2015, to 


be greater than 4.25:1.00 (ii) from and after December 31, 2017 to be greater than 3.75:1.00 and (iii) from and 


after December 31, 2019 to be greater than 3.25:1.00. 
  
The Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains a financial performance covenant for the benefit of 


the Term Loan A Facility lenders which provides that Lannett shall not permit its net senior secured leverage 
ratio as of the last day of any four consecutive fiscal quarters (i) prior to December 31, 2017, to be greater than 


4.25:1.00, (ii) as of December 31, 2017 and prior to December 31, 2019 to be greater than 3.75:1.00 and (iii) as 


of December 31, 2019 and thereafter to be greater than 3.25:1.00.

With the amount of debt currently loaded, at 3.9x EBITDA, there is no doubt in 
our mind that drastic steps are going to have to be taken over the next four years 
in order for this company to be able to survive without a restructuring – in fact, 
we think it is near impossible.  
 


It gets worse for Lannett.  In the past week, its headwinds got 
stronger. 
 


Citron was not going to release this article until we understood the current state 
of generic pharmaceutical pricing.  For this we looked to the recent JP Morgan 
healthcare conference, to which Lannett was not even invited, to gauge the 
commentary surrounding larger generics.  The message of “challenging generic 
pricing environment” was a constant underlying theme amongst all of the larger 
players. 
 


Worse, this past week President Elect Trump expressed his continued dedication 
to lowering prescription drug pricing, stating that the industry is getting away 
with “murder” and opening the door for foreign drug companies.   
 
One example how this trend can break Lannett is to look at a recent ANDA filed by 
Apotex, a sizable Canadian pharma company who is a huge supplier of generics to 
the US, with low-cost manufacturing capability in India. Apotex lists Levothyroxine 
as "filed" with the FDA.

  Conclusion 
 
In this report, Citron has proven a clear path to bankruptcy.  Lannett will clearly 
fall under their own debt load as they encounter macro trends which they cannot 
escape.  It should be noted that Lannett is not a real pharmaceutical company -- 
for years it lingered as a single digit stock and even traded under cash at one 
point, until management learned how to raise prices and rip off the government.  
They then levered up the company and made an egregiously overpriced 
acquisition that will prove to be fatal.   
 


CEO Bedrosian once boasted to a conference “In the generics business you are 
only as strong as your most stupid competitor” 
 


Well, now the truth is you are only as strong as your most scrutinized competitor. 
 


Citron points out that Concordia has already followed this path from $24 to $2.  
For Lannett, it is only a matter of time.
