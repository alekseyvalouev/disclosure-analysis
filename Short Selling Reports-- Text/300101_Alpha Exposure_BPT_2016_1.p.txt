Why BPT Should Get Cut In Half Again... And Then Again
Mar. 14, 2016 11:41 AM ET67 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


BPT has recently disclosed that it expects its royalty stream to end in 2020.


Furthermore, it disclosed that its undiscounted estimated future royalty cash flows
equate to only $11.59 per share (or 40% below Friday’s close).


These disclosures are based on an oil price of $50.28.


However, if we model these cash flows based on the oil’s forward pricing curve, we
believe that the downside to fair value exceeds 70%.


Over a three-day period last week the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (NYSE:BPT) lost
nearly half of its value after a bearish investment manager issued a press release which
did little more than highlight language from the Trust's recently filed Form 10-K. The
highlighted disclosures include the Trustee's expectation that the Trust's royalties would
end after 2020 and that the remaining estimated future cash flows to the Trust were only
$248.1M or $11.59 per unit.


Subsequently, a contributor to another financial news outlet, while calling for caution,
suggested that this "was probably the worst case scenario" (Source). Given the differing
views, we thought it was worthwhile to delve into the Trust's structure and the recent 10-K
in more detail and explain why, even after the recent drop, we believe the units of the trust
remain significantly overvalued.


Royalty Trusts


Royalty trusts are typically owned by income-oriented investors as well as those seeking
to express a view on the underlying drivers of the trust's income stream, which in the case
of BPT is the price of oil. As with all income oriented investments, it is important to
consider the size, certainty and duration of the distribution stream and, as is typical with

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/10/these-5-oil-stocks-are-getting-slammed-today-heres.aspx
structured investment vehicles such as trusts, the devil is often in the details. These
details are particularly relevant when a trust is nearing its end as this is the point in time
when it is most dangerous to equate a high current yield with a high asset value. To
illustrate this concept, you need only consider the appropriate yield for a trust with only
one distribution remaining. In the case of BPT, we believe that these factors are not
reflected in the market price of the units and we suspect that they are not understood by
many of the unitholders. In short, we believe that BPT is neither a good source of income
nor an attractive way to express a bullish view on oil.


BPT's Structure


BPT receives royalty revenues from BP's interest in oil produced at Prudhoe Bay. These
royalty revenues are not derived from the actual price that BP receives for its oil or the
actual cost that it incurs to produce the oil. Rather, they are based on a formula that was
determined at the time that the Trust was created. We will summarize each of the
components of this formula and then describe how we believe this information can be
used to assess the value of the Trust. The full details are available in the Trust's Form 10-
K and we highly recommend that any current or potential investor in BPT review this filing
in full.


Oil Price: The daily price for West Texas Intermediate Crude as published in the Wall
Street Journal, Reuters or by Platts.


Volume: A fixed percentage of the daily production attributable to BP's working interest in
the Prudhoe Bay field capped at 90,000 barrels per day.


Chargeable Cost: The chargeable costs are determined based on an escalating schedule
that was established at the time the Trust was created which is then adjusted by an
inflation factor based on the CPI.


Production Taxes: The Production Taxes are calculated in a manner that is intended to
mimic Alaska's tax code while reflecting the theoretical revenues and costs described
above. The complexity of the code is outside the scope of this article, however the
minimum tax per barrel, which is applicable under current market conditions, is set at 4%
of the per barrel wellhead price.


A bit of history



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/850033/000119312516484604/d102077d10k.htm
In the chart below we show each of these components for the most recent 5-years as
disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K as well as the average WTI price for each period.


The difference between the WTI price and the top of each column represents the per
barrel royalty for each period. This amount, when multiplied by the production volume for
the period determines the royalty revenue for the Trust which, after paying the Trust's
administrative costs, is distributed to the unitholders.


A glimpse into the future


In the chart below we project these costs in the future. To do so we had to make only two
assumptions. First, we assumed that inflation, as measured by the CPI, would be 0%
going forward. Holding all else equal, if the actual rate of inflation is higher than this, the
actual per barrel cost will be higher and thus the per barrel royalties will be lower. The
second assumption relates to production taxes as they are dependent on the WTI price.
For this we used the WTI forward curve as of March 10, 2016.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/3/959452_14579638500923_rId11.png
The most obvious characteristic of this chart is that the chargeable costs begin to increase
at a rapid pace beginning in 2018. As stated earlier, the chargeable costs are not BP's
actual costs; rather they are based on the cost schedule that was agreed at the time the
Trust was created. While I suspect that this cost schedule was intended to reflect the
increase in unit costs that are typical near the end of the life of a field, the particular
rationale is not relevant to BPT's value.


What is relevant is that while E&P companies around the world are rapidly reducing their
development and production costs to help cope with low commodity prices, BPT has no
ability to do so and instead is contractually tied to a rapidly increasing cost burden.


Implied future per barrel royalties


Now that BPT's costs are understood, we consider two oil price scenarios. First we
consider the SEC price of $50.28 as this is the price used to value the Trust's reserves in
its 2015 reserve report (again, please see the most recent 10-K for more detail). Second,
we use the WTI forward curve (as of 3/10/2016).



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/3/959452_14579638500923_rId12.png
The SEC price is based on the 12-month average WTI price for 2015 using the closing
price for the first day of each month. Under this assumption, as disclosed in the 10-K and
as evident from the chart above, royalty payments would continue through 2020 and be
zero thereafter. In the 10-K, the undiscounted estimated future cash flows to the Trust
were disclosed to be $248.1M or $11.59 per share. The 10-K also disclosed that the net
present value of these cash flows when discounted at 10% is $214.5 which equates to
only $10.02 per unit.


The second price scenario is the based on the forward curve which is represented by the
blue line above (the WTI price for Q1 2016 reflects an average closing spot price for dates
the through March 10, 2015 and the relevant forward price for the remainder of the
period). As can be seen, even after the recent rally, the forward curve is significantly below
the SEC price. In fact, the sum of the per barrel royalties based on the forward curve is
approximately 60% of that using the SEC price. This suggests that the undiscounted per
share value of the estimated cash flow to the Trust is only about $6.93 or significantly less
than half of the current stock price.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/3/959452_14579638500923_rId13.png
Our view


For the purpose of the analysis above, we have made only two assumptions: that inflation
will be zero and that the WTI price would either be flat at $50.28 or follow the forward
curve (as of 3/10/2016). Everything has been either explicitly drawn from data contained in
the Trust's filings with the SEC or directly derived from it (for example the 60% factor used
in the preceding paragraph or converting aggregate values to per share values). In our
own investment analysis, however, we have taken a slightly different approach. While we
continue to rely on the forward curve, we assume a 1.0% rate of inflation, a 1.5% annual
rate of decline for production, we include estimated Trust administration costs, and we
discount the cash flows at 10%. Under these assumptions we calculate the per unit value
of BPT to be $5.39. Basically, we believe that the price of the Trust would need to be cut in
half and then nearly cut in half again before it reached fair value as our estimate of fair
value is 72% below the Trust's closing price of $19.17 on Friday.

The April 15 expiration date of my options is killing me. Can anyone explain the massive increase over the last few
days. After the dividend announcement it dropped to 11.29, followed by a crazy rise currently at 15.17, a 34%
increase over 3 and a half days!! What is causing this insanity.

I assume a good deal of price support is coming from short covering. Approx 7% of shares were sold short
in mid March; I haven't seen an updated number for Month end, nor something actually useful and timely
like short interest over the last few trading days. So whether short interest increased into this month or not,
there was a large interest recently and a good potion may have come off this week. When I see a 10 or
30K spike in volume, I tend to assume that's a cover, but who knows. Maybe a professional mgr would
actually accumulate at these prices even if I think it would be foolish.


The other obvious explanation which I presume is also true is the recent advance in crude. API will be out
in a few mins, and EIA tomorrow... if there's a big build, incl a build in Cushing, WTI may sell off tomorrow
and you'll get an idea from price action in BPT how much WTI price has been and will effect BPT
sentiment at these levels. Hopeful imports pop, the build is large, and Cushing builds too. If so, there's a
chance for favorable price action tomorrow in BPT.

That is certainly part of it, but timing is out of whack. The big gain in oil was April 8, where BPT only had
modest increase, last two days have seen 8% gain each day in BPT while oil increased both of those
days, increase was much lower than April 8 increase.

connellybarnes
Has anyone thought much about the probability that BPT is worth zero? It seems if the author's "projected BPT
costs" chart here is correct and WTI stays below about $32 then the value would be zero. This argument would be
supported by the small BPT dividend of 7.2 cents in April: in this recent quarter, WTI averaged about $35. It seems
that BPT longs must take on this risk, and furthermore, that a correctly priced option chain should reflect the
probability distribution of valuations for BPT under the probability distribution of different oil prices (including,
potentially, a significant probability of the tail-risk event of BPT being valued at or near zero).

CB,
I've certainly thought about it but its not my base case. FYI, using their WTI price feed, I had WTI at
$33.67 last Q, so I'd work w/ that number. Bottom line, what the article calls the chargable costs/inflation
factor (and the 10K calls the Adjusted Chargeable Costs) rises only negligibly in 2017. That gives the Trust
a decent runway for WTI to buoy some. The pain begins in 2018 and yearly thereafter. I've got the 2018
incresase in Adj Charable Costs between $5ish and $5.35 per barrel, depending on CPI, and it stairsteps

from then forward. So you're right, if WTI settles below $33 thru 2017, and below $38 the year after, the
trust will be terminated and the party over, without any further payments.


My model showed $5.30 total on recent Futures curve data, and I can see $2 to $3 total under a number of
scenarios.

Aki,


Based upon your assumptions the math looks about right to me. If I were to bet, however, I would bet that future oil
prices will be higher than the futures curve, I could ultimately see them stabilizing at $55-70/brl. This would only
delay the termination of the Trust 2 or 3 years with small additional payments. Bottom line though is that I doubt
the Trust is even worth the current market price of $12.50, so definitely still not a "buy" and probably a "sell."

Thanks Bill,
I deleted my first question since it's more or less just a rehash of OP. Just fyi, my guesstimate of BPT's
embedded option value is $2, so that just puts fair value for BPT at$7.05. It seems that there are a lot of
people out there are still anchoring around the $11.59 from page 17 of the 10K.
Btw, my (very rough) calcs for "implied future oil prices" in the $12.7 price:
$47 average for remainder of 2016 and 2017. ($4 above futures)
$55 average for 2018 (~$9+ above Dec18/Jan19 futures)
$58 for 2019 (~$11 above Dec19/Jan20 futures
$61 for 2020. (~$12 above Dec20/Jan21 futures).

Sorry about that. Fwiw I don't see a quick way to restore my first post, but to summarize for others I was
basically asking for a double-check on some arithmetic to calc what I was calling "Intrinsic Value" using a
certain set of assumptions (current oil futures curve, 32,32,38,44,50 for all-in costs for 2016,17,18,19,20).

AA and others,
"It seems that there are a lot of people out there are still anchoring around the $11.59 from page 17 of the
10K." 
Q: So if i'm tracking your implied calculation, that's the undiscounted cash flows per Trust unit based on
the reserve estimates at WTI $50.28? Is that correct?


Curious if your remark about people possibly "anchoring" there is meant to be conjecture about BPT price
action over the last couple days, or if u guys have been talking about something else?


Just trying to clarify the points of your discussion. And related to BPT price action, I wondered if anyone
subscribes to a daily short interest service, and would share their observations of the last couple days.
FINRA will publish a snapshot of end of month interest on Monday, but that's not gonna help me much. I
have to believe much (at least some) of the buying Thurs/Fri was short covering. There were 1.6M shares
short mid March... don't know how much at March end, but have to believe many of the large buys we saw
go off Thurs/Fri was short covering.


AA or Bill, if either of u guys wanna chime in more on valuation or optionality premium stuff, I'd be
interested. Forgive the shotgun post, but without the deleted post, I was intrigued by the discussion but
confused. I'd like to get back long BPT again, but I'm starting to feel strongly it may never be under (fairly?)
priced again.

@Funky,


"I have to believe much (at least some) of the buying Thurs/Fri was short covering."


Well, I covered about 25% of my short last week. I plan to cover the rest during the next two weeks and be
totally out after the distribution payment date. That was my plan and "I'm stickin' to it."


This will most likely always trade above fair value. The financial websites all seem to show yield based
upon the last four quarters, so this will continue to show a decent yield, and unsuspecting investors will
buy in.

Thanks for the FYI Bill... always interested in your posts. Good luck w/ your trade. I had started to build a
short position (long apr puts) but b4 getting much done, CAS showed up and smashed it. Great returns but
not much in it. When it bounced on the RSI condition/article, I went back in (apr puts) and I'm still holding.
Should do fine but not great, unless we trade up to 13.50, which I guess is possible.

Funky Town
User, u happen to be asking tough questions I can't answer well but I can add some context.


1. I copped out manually computing the factor and instead increased it as described in my post above to project
out. (Thou I didn't mention, my tactic did result in an nearly perfect straight line, so I know that tactic follows well
from BPT data going back to 2002). U may be getting hung up on their reset approach: if the factor doesn't
increase for a Q, they make an adjustment and them begin moving forward again. It's in the 10K and coherent, but
I gave it short shrift just trying to save time, and don't remember their exact language.


2. I spent lots of time searching for good descriptions of the 2014 tax details and sort of struck out. I have no idea
how folks are finding and using a solid formula to compute them, and I know it begins with wellhead prices that I
couldn't find anyway. I used a brute force empirical bootstrap, by grabbing 7 Qs of data from 10Ks since 2014.1
(when new regime went into effect) and plotted the WTI and per barrel tax. Also, reverse engineered an estimate
for Jan 1, 2016 WTI price based on some new languange in the 10K illustrating the breakeven price. So 8 data
points is all I can leverage. Have decent idea for WTI between 40ish and 60, for 75, and for around 100, the prices
provided since 2014 I could work with. Would love to improve my approach as well so hoping someone else
chimes in.


3. Last I looked I couldn't find an annoucement data but historically its often been the 6th, but going back years its
could come as early as the 3rd or late as the 8th. Ex date and pay date mid month or so. Stopped obsessing when
I got out, but if you're considering APR contracts, the details matter.


18 Mar 2016, 03:53 PM


CGCG
Thanks Funky Town.


As for the Cost Adjustment Factor, that's what I ended up doing as well. My guess is it relates to the
$18.00/bl threshold: "If the average WTI Price returns to more than $18.00 for a later quarter [after having
fallen below $18/bl], adjustments to the Cost Adjustment Factor resume, but with an adjustment to the
formula that excludes changes in the Consumer Price Index during the period that adjustments to the Cost
Adjustment Factor were suspended."


I'll keep digging into the production tax stuff. Seemed a lot easier up until August 2006.

Funky and CGCG,


The AdjFactor formula is (1.28 * CPI / 166.2). You're right CGCG, this comes from the last time WTI was
below $18, and is the (1999Q2 Adjustment Factor) * (Current CPI) / (May 1999 CPI).


Production Tax: without considering step increases I use ((4% * (WTI - 4.5 * AdjFactor)) +.04). This comes
from the 10K pages 7-8. Against the 2015 Q1-Q3 taxes reported in the 10K it is spot-on.


As to your other post to me Funky, I follow absolutely everything you have laid out, and wouldn't take hard
exception with any of it. Your model and assumptions are very similar to mine, with only minor differences
that don't really affect the main conclusion that there is still a very large optionality premium against the
current futures strip. I had 4% as the base production decline rate in my model too, but that will certainly
go higher now unless they reverse course on idling the rigs (and one is already idled). I don't really want to
posit a new decline rate though, as I would just be speculating. Time will give us better data.

I'm seeing:


Nov15: 237.336
Aug15: 238.316
May15: 237.804
Feb15: 234.722


and dividing those by 121.1 yields:
Nov15: 1.96 (1.84 reported)
Aug15: 1.97 (1.83 reported)
May15: 1.96 (1.81 reported)
Feb15: 1.94 (1.82 reported)


Also, I'm trying to model out production taxes, but I'm not entirely sure how. Where can I find more details on the
minimum tax and the stair-step-per-barrel tax credits?


Lastly, the borrow looks to be pretty expensive. So puts seem like another possible method to express a negative
view. However, the nearest has an expiry date of 04/15/16. Last year, on 04/20/15, the Trustee distributed to
unitholders of record on 04/16/15. 04/15/15 was a Wednesday (Friday this year) and 04/20/15 was a Monday.
When would we get clarity on the upcoming dividend?

After reading hundreds of SA posts I have found your series on BPT some of the best written yet. Technical and
level headed responses that educate and do not denigrate other writers. Thank You.
I see BPT as a bet<investment?> on rising oil prices. How many ways can we get there is an interesting topic. I
believe secure US based production may have a risk value that is not accounted for in current pricing. I will wait
and see what the future brings. Long BPT.

Thank you so much for posting this article. I did this math even before the last annual report came out, and knew
this stock was in for a dive. At the core of the analysis is the heavy increases in the chargeable costs starting
2018. Everyone was valuing this stock as if these costs would not increase. Yet they were set in 1989, this is not
new information. If the market as a whole realizes the true nature of this stock, it should move to its correct
valuation of $5.39. Any price above this is a bet on increasing oil. If you want to bet on increasing oil look at other
trusts that do not have the mechanics of this trust, there are a lot out there.

Aminvest, you bring up a good point. Curious if you're sure there a lot of other oil trusts. I know there's a

can get. Thx!

@Funky,


"The 10K does make explicit that interests of BP and Unit holders might not always be aligned, and they describe
those risks"


I'm 100% in agreement with everything you've said. I've found the potential conflict of interest disclosure
interesting, however. It's always been interesting to me that the summer shutdown is almost always entirely within

I hear u Bill. It's tough sometimes to roll with developments when u don't have complete information and
you're left pondering the "why nows?". Have to say I'm more bitter about the windfall profits impact at the
peak, and wishing the Condensate participation change came a year ealier at higher WTI. Still, I have
loved owing this and have done very well on it. It's sad that the auto-pilot good times are over. I actually
had kept a small slice and sold mid 20s in Feb... very painful to give up, and hard to take a loss on that
cost basis. But not that many days later I put on a small short position (long APR Puts), thinking it would
be maybe a 4ish week trade. I guess I decided my conviction was strong enough and my relationship w/
BPT wasn't over. Anyway, the CAS release came and I finished closing my Puts last Friday. Looking at the
price-volume chart, and based on the fundamentals, I have to say I think this thing is going down a lot
more, and perhaps persistently thru early APR. I'd love to go long again and see BPT last longer than
anyone thinks. But I won't be going bonkers. Oil is just to hard to predict.

Couple thoughts...


The 10K always provides a brief count of wells: producing, water injecting, gas injecting, and that other injecting
type I can't remember...and new wells. Anyways, by looking at historical data from past 10Ks, u can get a pretty
good picture of the path their on, and I think Bill's characteriztion is fair. They need to drill to help offset the natural
decline from producing wells. I know the decline rate for producing wells is greater than for the whole field, but that
new wells drilled mitigates much of that loss, thereby making the field decline more reasonable.


The way I look at their rig reduction, it will have a negative impact, but it's effect is meaningless until WTI goes up
(assuming it does), and if WTI goes up materially, they'll reverse that decision. Keep in mind BPT gets just 16ish
percent of just the 1989 Interests, and so BP and their partners have much greater incentive than even we do, to
properly manage the long term value of that field. Long term value can't be optimized without maintaining



https://seekingalpha.com/author/bill-cunningham

https://seekingalpha.com/user/8823971

https://seekingalpha.com/user/8823971
continuous production, and certainly not by curtailing it materially. Fields 25 years past their peak must be
managed well and that management includes persistent production. Since they give avg well production, u could
compute that decline rate and assume BPT forward production might look more like that, rather than what it has
looked like recently for BPT interests at a higher rig count. I haven't bothered because the analysis is only useful if
WTI recovers, and I'm presuming they'll rig up if that happens.


To be clear though, BP has no obligation to drill or even produce. I just see their interests in this area aligned w/
Unit holders, and so I don't see big risk on this point. The 10K does make explicit that interests of BP and Unit
holders might not always be aligned, and they describe those risks. In my view though, those aren't the risks Unit
holders should be sweating. WTI needs to recover.


15 Mar 2016, 05:59 PM


McDowell23
I agree with you that BP will ramp maintenance drilling back up if oil prices recover, but it's not like
production will quickly return to previous (current) levels. They have been maintenance drilling with 6 rigs
and still suffer a 4% decline in production. If they let drilling falter for a year or two and production falls off
rapidly (say to 70k/day by 2018 -- I have it at 95k/day now after the condensate reclassification fwiw), and
then maintenance drilling returns to the current level, the 4% decline will resume (after a restart lag which
could also be significant) from that lower production level. Yes, if WTI skyrockets the opportunity is there to
again drill-baby-drill, but any time not spent on maintenance drilling now will certainly affect the future
production levels at least for a significant period of time, even if WTI recovers. And we know that time is a
critical factor against the BPT cost schedule.


16 Mar 2016, 08:42 AM


McDowell23
I think I may have been overestimating production... historically it looks like BPT gets about 44.8% of the
oil production (I had been using the 50.68% figure in my projections, mistakenly I now think). At 44.8%,
BPT's production share could be at just 60k by 2018, and is more likely 85k in 2016.


Assume they lose 40 new wells/ year, at 300bbl/day per well. That's an additional 12k/day loss in
production per year while drilling with just 2 rigs vs. 6.


16 Mar 2016, 09:27 AM


Funky Town
McD, thx for your comment. I think I follow your logic (because I think we agree, thou you've been explicit
about a lag to recovery to a better decline rate)... But I can't tell if you're suggesting you already estimated
what you expect in a new (lower rig) decline rate, from which rigging up would improve from (eventually). I
ask because I think your details differ a bit from mine. My logic was to look at avg prod per producing wells
(given short shrift but mentioned in every 10K), examine that decline rate, and take it as a worse case. I
thought we went from 5 to 2 rigs for the field, so I was going to assume the 89 Working Interest got their



https://seekingalpha.com/user/45159276

https://seekingalpha.com/user/45159276

https://seekingalpha.com/user/8823971
fair share of drilling, and assume instead of approx 50 new wells/year, we'd get 20. I'd also assume they'd
absolutely optimize deployment of the rigs (whether injection or new producing), and so basically just go
60% from the current full rig decline rate to the decline rate on existing wells. I realize my approach is
rough but I thought it was actually reasonable given the unknowns in play. Also, you seem to have a
stronger conviction on the time lag (after rigging up) to a better decline rate. I get that, but don't have
sufficient knowledge to guestimate it. Any thoughts u can share? Appreciate any reaction of follow up u
can provide.

already to digest.


16 Mar 2016, 10:20 AM


McDowell23
I’m not sure I understand all of your questions, but here are some of my thoughts. There were 6 rigs
working the field in 2015 and prior, and 1 (Doyon 16) was idled at the end of the year (6 to 5). 3 more were
announced in March (5 to 2; so 6 to 2 overall in 2016 vs. 2015). Lag to restart; they are moving/idling the
physical rigs and pulling several hundred personnel. The rigs may just go on stand-by, but the lag to re-
crew will take on the order of months (find, hire, transport, coordinate). Also factor in the time for BP bean-
counters to have the confidence to pull the restart trigger. New well production; the average over 1100
wells is now 170 bbls/day, so 300 on a new well is just my swag.


Swirl those together and you can see my math and assumptions, which even with a few rough estimates I
think is reasonable. I agree with you of course that low WTI will completely overshadow the production
effect if low WTI remains, but I think this move does non-trivially affect potential recovery on the upside if it
happens.

fwiw - I found this from an article in 2014 about Prudhoe Bay's rigs and their effectiveness (Alaska Journal,

17 Mar 2016, 09:40 PM


Funky Town
Thanks McD. I may try to put a finer point on the decline rate based in part on your feedback. I wish the
10K gave comprehensive well counts, showing well types added. They stated 56 added wells for 2015 but
if you simply count the active wells by type, only 17 added wells are accounted for (2, 1, 7, & 7 for
producing, water inj, gas inj, and Mis inj, respectively, net additional wells by type over 2014 #s). I've
always assumed they capped some and that accounts for the persistent difference but I don't know
enough about field mgmt to guess how those are distributed across well types. At first glance that quote u
found is startling: each undrilled new well would contribute another approx. 1% to the decline rate. But how
many new producing wells will they forgo (as oppesed to other well types) and what net production will
they lose (if poorer wells that would have been capped are kept in production)? I appreciate that it might
be grim, but I'm not sure it has to be grim.


I reviewed the article again and I have to say, the more I've obsessed on this, the worse it looks. I think the
articles assumptions are unrealistic, even in their own less forgiving approach. I understand BPT uses CPI
All items, All Urban Consumers, US Cities Avg, and that we've had a small break in the Adj Factor recently
as low oil prices helped bring that metric down. But Core CPI (x food/energy) for Feb came in at 2.3%. The
only way BPT distributions recover is if oil rises, and CPI All Items will reflect that increase, adding it to a
now higher core inflation. The Fed has been wreckless chasing 2% and I think they'll get it. (Besides, if we
get deflation instead, WTI isn't going anywhere, so the whole exercise is moot). Long story short, my
model works w/ their adj factor (1.835) and increases it .005/Q representing slightly over 2%/yr.


For Production, I settled on a 4% decline per year, that I used to think was fair and even cautious, but now
w/ rig cuts might be generous. Incidentally, if I try to find data to support a better decline rate, the ONLY
way I can do it is to examine the 10K tables from before 2015, when they used to provide Field and BPT
production for oil and condensate separately. If u focus only on the BPT Oil from 08 to 13, you could argue
a decent recent stretch of about 2% decline rate, ignoring the historic higher decline rate for condensate,
and it's now larger proportion of total based on the 2014 shift to higher participation rate. I can't come
close to justifying 1 1/2% the article used.


Finally I skipped any discounting. With ZIRP, NIRP and financial represession, who needs to discount a
fairly short stream, esp at 10%?


Anyway, I ran numbers based on 3/16/16 prices/futures. I've got the APR distribution at 7 cents if WTI is
stable for the next 2 weeks.


If WTI follows the futures curve, I've got BPT paying a total of $5.30, with last payment 2018 Q4.


If WTI follows the curve plus $5 at every date, BPT pays $9.21; last payment 2019 Q4.



https://seekingalpha.com/user/8823971
If WTI follows the curve plus $10, BPT pays $14.09; last payment 2020 Q4.


If WTI were to hold steady at 3/16 closing price ($38.46), BPT pays $2.27; last payment 2017 Q4. Yikes.


So a base case is an undiscounted $5.30 based on WTI futures. Even after the recent selloff, BPT is
trading with a large optionality premium.


A final rub that the article doesn't address is the progressivity of production taxes for higher WTI (because
their future prices don't get there). Under the 2014 tax regime, I show prod taxes for $75 WTI at 10% or
$7.50/bl. Since my Adj Chargable Costs reaches $67.5 in 2022 Q4, $75 WTI would not earn a royalty
beginning in that Q, even if the trust were still operating. For $100 WTI, I show taxes at 18% or $18. My
Adj Chargable Costs reaches $82 in 2024 Q4, so $100 Oil doesn't earn a royalty beginning then... all this
assuming the trust isn't terminated before these timeframes on lower WTI/distributions.


So... these projections show me a stunning optionality premium that requires a major shift from present
WTI futures to work out, w/ a pretty harsh "soft cap" on upside if WTI goes a lot higher (my Adj Chargeable
Cost, excluding Prod taxes for 2015.4 is $90/bl, to put a fine point on it).


I'd be interested in any reactions you have since I presume you model this yourself.

Bill, March 9th Carl Surran says "BP" says it will decrease the number of rigs working at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's

The rigs are for drilling NEW wells. The old wells eventually run dry so they have to constantly drill new
wells to keep the volumes up. They just will be drilling less new wells now, not closing any wells.

While the trust gets 16% from these wells BP gets the other 84%. They are cutting rigs most likely
because it is not profitable for them to keep drilling more wells until the price of oil moves higher. Nothing

MM,
Honestly, and will all due respect, you're engaging in superstition. You seem to believe BP has a motive to commit
fraud by under-reporting production, apparently because they owe lots of money on legal settlements and
presumaby because they are prepared to risk prosecution and law suits to steal assets; You seem to wonder if
they're making a field grab to profit going forward by excluding BPT unit holders. The problem is, that such an
explanation or theory is not needed to explain anything that's happened w/ distributions or BPT trading price. BPT
has always be capped at the first 90K barrels production per day, and the APR distribution almost certainly will be
based on over 80K, so even if they were cheating, they'd be cheating small. So why would they do it? The trust
paid .60 cents per unit last Q, so this fiscal year is already in the bag as having exceeded $1M/fiscal year, so they
can't expedite the trust termination by playing w/ the upcoming distribution. That dist will very likely be between 2
and 8 cents. And that is the problem for unit holders. These WTI prices, for the BPT structure, without any fraud,
are grim. The go-foward can look better if WTI increases, but the cost structure, by way of contract, escalates
brutally beginning in 2018. No fraud required.

Probably. I'd be cynical but bottom line, BPT either pays or doesn't; WTI will either recover or it won't. The
Trust doesn't need a market cap to secure financing or for any other reason. If it didn't drop on the CAS

Maybe the shorts will drive it so low it becomes a great buy again. Who knows.

Meh. The illustration is compelling for what it is, as it should be (because the basic facts indeed support a
conclusion that the party in BPT is mostly over at these oil prices). As mentioned in a comment above however,
there is some optionality value for higher oil prices in the out years. The escalting cost structure really kicks in
beginning in 2018, at it's fairly harsh. I have it reaching approximately $66.50 per barrel in 2022. If WTI were
trading at 100/bbl that year, for example, it would still nicely cover the escalated cost and the approximate $18 per
barrel production tax (at that WTI price, under the current regime, assuming Alaska doesn't revert back to Palin's
windfall profits approach), netting a nice per barrel royalty. I understand there may be better ways to capture that
optionality for upside in WTI, but I suspect there are countless investors who view BPT as an easier way to
express that view than alternatives such as the futures market. The path to (possibly) higher WTI prices matters
though, as this thing can't go "two successive years" paying less than $1M or it shuts down.

Funky Town, Is there anyway they, {BP} can "cheat" the unit holders of "BPT". The "Trust" is allowed the
oil in the Pess and Ivishak formations , collectively known as the Prudhoe Bay {Permo-Triassic} Reservoir,
and does not pertain to the Lisburne and Endicott formations. This is the largest producing oil field in North
America. With the problems that "BP" has had in the past do you think the money they collect off all their
"oil fields" in Alaska are tempting to hold back information. It almost takes a lawyer or someone with a lot
of knowledge to understand the jargon. They owe a lot of money.

"do you think the money they collect off all their "oil fields" in Alaska are tempting to hold back

They're not withholding any information. Recently, production has been the max that you get paid for
(16%+ of 90,000 brls/day.).You're getting paid based upon WTI, which is a public figure. Payments have
gone down for a logical reason, the decrease in oil prices. Why would you think that BP could be cheating
you?


The author has presented a good model. Use your estimate of future oil prices and figure out how much
you think you'll get paid before the Trust ends.

"Is there anyway they can cheat..."


MM, I'm not sure if that Q is rhetorical or real, but I'd say a couple things. First, compared to other stuff I've
owned and researched, BPT is actually more straight-forward and simpler to evaluate, with fewer
structural complexities whereby cheating could be hidden. Honestly, read any 10K of any decent sized
company, and you should be completely aware of how much investors must, at the end of the day, assume
some basic level of honesty and an absence of planned fraud. I assume the 1989 working interest is quite
well defined and understood, and BP operational and accountant folks are well practiced at reporting
production accurately. From my view, the production data and other financial information coming out on
every 10K has made sense and reflects a pattern that it is perfectly reasonable.


Having said that, there's no way a unit holder can "audit" the production volumes (or frankly, the production
taxes). I just don't see fraud as a material risk here. The much greater concern is that some investors don't
understand its basic structure (thou the 10Ks provide it), and at present WTI prices, the trust may surprise
such investors w/ how little distribution it pays. Of course BPT has additional "optionality" value for
improving WTI prices, but its critical to examine the escalating cost structure so you understand what WTI
price path is necessary to earn more money, and to understand the end game when the trust is
terminated. That cost structure is, and has been, very plainly explained in every 10K I remember reading.
Folks just need to digest the info so they can see the breakeven WTI price that actually results in a per
barrel royalty being paid. Then they can project their own WTI price curve and make their own valuation
judgment.

"A short here ... is a bet on oil prices not seeing 70 USD within the next 5 years "...


I'l agree with you that that's what a short bet on BPT SHOULD be, but unfortunately this trades based upon
perceived yield, and the upcoming distribution is going to be horrendous (0-10C), so unless there is some weird
short squeeze, this will undoubtedly be cheaper in April. If you are bullish on oil, there are probably much better
risk /reward options available than buying BPT at the current price.


You are also correct to notice that BPT is extremely sensitive to changes in oil prices, as the that valuation change
from the 2014 10 K that you quoted indicates.

You skipped the sentence before this in that annual report "Based on the 2014 twelve-month average WTI
Price of $94.99 per barrel..." Let me translate the above statement (remember divide above numbers by
21.4 million shares). if oil stays at $94.99 per barrel, cash flow to the trust will be $94.24 per share before
the cash flow goes to zero and the trust dissolves. If you discount (i.e., expect a return for your risk) the
present value of the 94.24 is $65 per share. Most of this money will be passed along to shareholders
through dividends, of course after trust admin fees. Keep in mind that not only is it insane to think oil will
get back to $95, but we are now another year closer to 2018 when the trust is essentially forced to sunset
due to the heavy yearly increases in chargeable costs.

I assume a good deal of price support is coming from short covering. Approx 7% of shares were sold short
in mid March; I haven't seen an updated number for Month end, nor something actually useful and timely
like short interest over the last few trading days. So whether short interest increased into this month or not,
there was a large interest recently and a good potion may have come off this week. When I see a 10 or
30K spike in volume, I tend to assume that's a cover, but who knows. Maybe a professional mgr would
actually accumulate at these prices even if I think it would be foolish.


The other obvious explanation which I presume is also true is the recent advance in crude. API will be out
in a few mins, and EIA tomorrow... if there's a big build, incl a build in Cushing, WTI may sell off tomorrow
and you'll get an idea from price action in BPT how much WTI price has been and will effect BPT
sentiment at these levels. Hopeful imports pop, the build is large, and Cushing builds too. If so, there's a
chance for favorable price action tomorrow in BPT.

That is certainly part of it, but timing is out of whack. The big gain in oil was April 8, where BPT only had
modest increase, last two days have seen 8% gain each day in BPT while oil increased both of those
days, increase was much lower than April 8 increase.

Has anyone thought much about the probability that BPT is worth zero? It seems if the author's "projected BPT
costs" chart here is correct and WTI stays below about $32 then the value would be zero. This argument would be
supported by the small BPT dividend of 7.2 cents in April: in this recent quarter, WTI averaged about $35. It seems
that BPT longs must take on this risk, and furthermore, that a correctly priced option chain should reflect the
probability distribution of valuations for BPT under the probability distribution of different oil prices (including,
potentially, a significant probability of the tail-risk event of BPT being valued at or near zero).

CB,
I've certainly thought about it but its not my base case. FYI, using their WTI price feed, I had WTI at
$33.67 last Q, so I'd work w/ that number. Bottom line, what the article calls the chargable costs/inflation
factor (and the 10K calls the Adjusted Chargeable Costs) rises only negligibly in 2017. That gives the Trust
a decent runway for WTI to buoy some. The pain begins in 2018 and yearly thereafter. I've got the 2018
incresase in Adj Charable Costs between $5ish and $5.35 per barrel, depending on CPI, and it stairsteps
from then forward. So you're right, if WTI settles below $33 thru 2017, and below $38 the year after, the
trust will be terminated and the party over, without any further payments.


My model showed $5.30 total on recent Futures curve data, and I can see $2 to $3 total under a number of
scenarios.

Aki,


Based upon your assumptions the math looks about right to me. If I were to bet, however, I would bet that future oil
prices will be higher than the futures curve, I could ultimately see them stabilizing at $55-70/brl. This would only
delay the termination of the Trust 2 or 3 years with small additional payments. Bottom line though is that I doubt
the Trust is even worth the current market price of $12.50, so definitely still not a "buy" and probably a "sell."

Thanks Bill,
I deleted my first question since it's more or less just a rehash of OP. Just fyi, my guesstimate of BPT's
embedded option value is $2, so that just puts fair value for BPT at$7.05. It seems that there are a lot of
people out there are still anchoring around the $11.59 from page 17 of the 10K.
Btw, my (very rough) calcs for "implied future oil prices" in the $12.7 price:
$47 average for remainder of 2016 and 2017. ($4 above futures)
$55 average for 2018 (~$9+ above Dec18/Jan19 futures)
$58 for 2019 (~$11 above Dec19/Jan20 futures
$61 for 2020. (~$12 above Dec20/Jan21 futures).

Sorry about that. Fwiw I don't see a quick way to restore my first post, but to summarize for others I was
basically asking for a double-check on some arithmetic to calc what I was calling "Intrinsic Value" using a

AA and others,
"It seems that there are a lot of people out there are still anchoring around the $11.59 from page 17 of the
10K." 
Q: So if i'm tracking your implied calculation, that's the undiscounted cash flows per Trust unit based on
the reserve estimates at WTI $50.28? Is that correct?


Curious if your remark about people possibly "anchoring" there is meant to be conjecture about BPT price
action over the last couple days, or if u guys have been talking about something else?


Just trying to clarify the points of your discussion. And related to BPT price action, I wondered if anyone
subscribes to a daily short interest service, and would share their observations of the last couple days.
FINRA will publish a snapshot of end of month interest on Monday, but that's not gonna help me much. I
have to believe much (at least some) of the buying Thurs/Fri was short covering. There were 1.6M shares
short mid March... don't know how much at March end, but have to believe many of the large buys we saw

confused. I'd like to get back long BPT again, but I'm starting to feel strongly it may never be under (fairly?)

@Funky,


"I have to believe much (at least some) of the buying Thurs/Fri was short covering."


Well, I covered about 25% of my short last week. I plan to cover the rest during the next two weeks and be
totally out after the distribution payment date. That was my plan and "I'm stickin' to it."


This will most likely always trade above fair value. The financial websites all seem to show yield based
upon the last four quarters, so this will continue to show a decent yield, and unsuspecting investors will
buy in.

Thanks for the FYI Bill... always interested in your posts. Good luck w/ your trade. I had started to build a
short position (long apr puts) but b4 getting much done, CAS showed up and smashed it. Great returns but
not much in it. When it bounced on the RSI condition/article, I went back in (apr puts) and I'm still holding.
Should do fine but not great, unless we trade up to 13.50, which I guess is possible.


I really would like to get long BPT again but can't see it happening. Really good observation u make about
how most websites show its yield. Grossly misleading and I'm afraid a lot of small retail money probably
gets sucked in.

User, u happen to be asking tough questions I can't answer well but I can add some context.


1. I copped out manually computing the factor and instead increased it as described in my post above to project
out. (Thou I didn't mention, my tactic did result in an nearly perfect straight line, so I know that tactic follows well
from BPT data going back to 2002). U may be getting hung up on their reset approach: if the factor doesn't

increase for a Q, they make an adjustment and them begin moving forward again. It's in the 10K and coherent, but
I gave it short shrift just trying to save time, and don't remember their exact language.


2. I spent lots of time searching for good descriptions of the 2014 tax details and sort of struck out. I have no idea
how folks are finding and using a solid formula to compute them, and I know it begins with wellhead prices that I
couldn't find anyway. I used a brute force empirical bootstrap, by grabbing 7 Qs of data from 10Ks since 2014.1
(when new regime went into effect) and plotted the WTI and per barrel tax. Also, reverse engineered an estimate
for Jan 1, 2016 WTI price based on some new languange in the 10K illustrating the breakeven price. So 8 data
points is all I can leverage. Have decent idea for WTI between 40ish and 60, for 75, and for around 100, the prices
provided since 2014 I could work with. Would love to improve my approach as well so hoping someone else
chimes in.


3. Last I looked I couldn't find an annoucement data but historically its often been the 6th, but going back years its
could come as early as the 3rd or late as the 8th. Ex date and pay date mid month or so. Stopped obsessing when
I got out, but if you're considering APR contracts, the details matter.


18 Mar 2016, 03:53 PM

Thanks Funky Town.


As for the Cost Adjustment Factor, that's what I ended up doing as well. My guess is it relates to the
$18.00/bl threshold: "If the average WTI Price returns to more than $18.00 for a later quarter [after having
fallen below $18/bl], adjustments to the Cost Adjustment Factor resume, but with an adjustment to the
formula that excludes changes in the Consumer Price Index during the period that adjustments to the Cost
Adjustment Factor were suspended."


I'll keep digging into the production tax stuff. Seemed a lot easier up until August 2006.


And as for the dates, you're right. I found the following on BPT's website (http://bit.ly/1nVsomF):

Funky and CGCG,


The AdjFactor formula is (1.28 * CPI / 166.2). You're right CGCG, this comes from the last time WTI was
below $18, and is the (1999Q2 Adjustment Factor) * (Current CPI) / (May 1999 CPI).


Production Tax: without considering step increases I use ((4% * (WTI - 4.5 * AdjFactor)) +.04). This comes
from the 10K pages 7-8. Against the 2015 Q1-Q3 taxes reported in the 10K it is spot-on.


As to your other post to me Funky, I follow absolutely everything you have laid out, and wouldn't take hard
exception with any of it. Your model and assumptions are very similar to mine, with only minor differences
that don't really affect the main conclusion that there is still a very large optionality premium against the
current futures strip. I had 4% as the base production decline rate in my model too, but that will certainly
go higher now unless they reverse course on idling the rigs (and one is already idled). I don't really want to
posit a new decline rate though, as I would just be speculating. Time will give us better data.

Also, I'm trying to model out production taxes, but I'm not entirely sure how. Where can I find more details on the
minimum tax and the stair-step-per-barrel tax credits?


Lastly, the borrow looks to be pretty expensive. So puts seem like another possible method to express a negative
view. However, the nearest has an expiry date of 04/15/16. Last year, on 04/20/15, the Trustee distributed to
unitholders of record on 04/16/15. 04/15/15 was a Wednesday (Friday this year) and 04/20/15 was a Monday.
When would we get clarity on the upcoming dividend?

Thank you so much for posting this article. I did this math even before the last annual report came out, and knew
this stock was in for a dive. At the core of the analysis is the heavy increases in the chargeable costs starting
2018. Everyone was valuing this stock as if these costs would not increase. Yet they were set in 1989, this is not
new information. If the market as a whole realizes the true nature of this stock, it should move to its correct
valuation of $5.39. Any price above this is a bet on increasing oil. If you want to bet on increasing oil look at other
trusts that do not have the mechanics of this trust, there are a lot out there.

you're left pondering the "why nows?". Have to say I'm more bitter about the windfall profits impact at the
peak, and wishing the Condensate participation change came a year ealier at higher WTI. Still, I have
loved owing this and have done very well on it. It's sad that the auto-pilot good times are over. I actually
had kept a small slice and sold mid 20s in Feb... very painful to give up, and hard to take a loss on that
cost basis. But not that many days later I put on a small short position (long APR Puts), thinking it would
be maybe a 4ish week trade. I guess I decided my conviction was strong enough and my relationship w/
BPT wasn't over. Anyway, the CAS release came and I finished closing my Puts last Friday. Looking at the
price-volume chart, and based on the fundamentals, I have to say I think this thing is going down a lot
more, and perhaps persistently thru early APR. I'd love to go long again and see BPT last longer than
anyone thinks. But I won't be going bonkers. Oil is just to hard to predict.


15 Mar 2016, 07:25 PM


Funky Town
Couple thoughts...


The 10K always provides a brief count of wells: producing, water injecting, gas injecting, and that other injecting
type I can't remember...and new wells. Anyways, by looking at historical data from past 10Ks, u can get a pretty
good picture of the path their on, and I think Bill's characteriztion is fair. They need to drill to help offset the natural
decline from producing wells. I know the decline rate for producing wells is greater than for the whole field, but that
new wells drilled mitigates much of that loss, thereby making the field decline more reasonable.


The way I look at their rig reduction, it will have a negative impact, but it's effect is meaningless until WTI goes up
(assuming it does), and if WTI goes up materially, they'll reverse that decision. Keep in mind BPT gets just 16ish
percent of just the 1989 Interests, and so BP and their partners have much greater incentive than even we do, to
properly manage the long term value of that field. Long term value can't be optimized without maintaining
continuous production, and certainly not by curtailing it materially. Fields 25 years past their peak must be
managed well and that management includes persistent production. Since they give avg well production, u could
compute that decline rate and assume BPT forward production might look more like that, rather than what it has
looked like recently for BPT interests at a higher rig count. I haven't bothered because the analysis is only useful if
WTI recovers, and I'm presuming they'll rig up if that happens.


To be clear though, BP has no obligation to drill or even produce. I just see their interests in this area aligned w/
Unit holders, and so I don't see big risk on this point. The 10K does make explicit that interests of BP and Unit
holders might not always be aligned, and they describe those risks. In my view though, those aren't the risks Unit
holders should be sweating. WTI needs to recover.


15 Mar 2016, 05:59 PM


McDowell23
I agree with you that BP will ramp maintenance drilling back up if oil prices recover, but it's not like
production will quickly return to previous (current) levels. They have been maintenance drilling with 6 rigs
and still suffer a 4% decline in production. If they let drilling falter for a year or two and production falls off



https://seekingalpha.com/user/8823971

https://seekingalpha.com/user/45159276
rapidly (say to 70k/day by 2018 -- I have it at 95k/day now after the condensate reclassification fwiw), and
then maintenance drilling returns to the current level, the 4% decline will resume (after a restart lag which
could also be significant) from that lower production level. Yes, if WTI skyrockets the opportunity is there to
again drill-baby-drill, but any time not spent on maintenance drilling now will certainly affect the future
production levels at least for a significant period of time, even if WTI recovers. And we know that time is a
critical factor against the BPT cost schedule.


16 Mar 2016, 08:42 AM


McDowell23
I think I may have been overestimating production... historically it looks like BPT gets about 44.8% of the
oil production (I had been using the 50.68% figure in my projections, mistakenly I now think). At 44.8%,
BPT's production share could be at just 60k by 2018, and is more likely 85k in 2016.


Assume they lose 40 new wells/ year, at 300bbl/day per well. That's an additional 12k/day loss in
production per year while drilling with just 2 rigs vs. 6.


16 Mar 2016, 09:27 AM


Funky Town
McD, thx for your comment. I think I follow your logic (because I think we agree, thou you've been explicit
about a lag to recovery to a better decline rate)... But I can't tell if you're suggesting you already estimated
what you expect in a new (lower rig) decline rate, from which rigging up would improve from (eventually). I
ask because I think your details differ a bit from mine. My logic was to look at avg prod per producing wells
(given short shrift but mentioned in every 10K), examine that decline rate, and take it as a worse case. I
thought we went from 5 to 2 rigs for the field, so I was going to assume the 89 Working Interest got their
fair share of drilling, and assume instead of approx 50 new wells/year, we'd get 20. I'd also assume they'd
absolutely optimize deployment of the rigs (whether injection or new producing), and so basically just go
60% from the current full rig decline rate to the decline rate on existing wells. I realize my approach is
rough but I thought it was actually reasonable given the unknowns in play. Also, you seem to have a
stronger conviction on the time lag (after rigging up) to a better decline rate. I get that, but don't have
sufficient knowledge to guestimate it. Any thoughts u can share? Appreciate any reaction of follow up u
can provide.

https://seekingalpha.com/user/45159276
I’m not sure I understand all of your questions, but here are some of my thoughts. There were 6 rigs
working the field in 2015 and prior, and 1 (Doyon 16) was idled at the end of the year (6 to 5). 3 more were
announced in March (5 to 2; so 6 to 2 overall in 2016 vs. 2015). Lag to restart; they are moving/idling the
physical rigs and pulling several hundred personnel. The rigs may just go on stand-by, but the lag to re-
crew will take on the order of months (find, hire, transport, coordinate). Also factor in the time for BP bean-
counters to have the confidence to pull the restart trigger. New well production; the average over 1100
wells is now 170 bbls/day, so 300 on a new well is just my swag.


Swirl those together and you can see my math and assumptions, which even with a few rough estimates I
think is reasonable. I agree with you of course that low WTI will completely overshadow the production
effect if low WTI remains, but I think this move does non-trivially affect potential recovery on the upside if it
happens.

McDowell23
fwiw - I found this from an article in 2014 about Prudhoe Bay's rigs and their effectiveness (Alaska Journal,
July-Issue-2 2014). The loss of rigs effect may be more significant than I had estimated.


"Ed King, an economist with the state Department of Natural Resources, said in a previous interview that
each working drill rig on the North Slope typically completes six new producing wells a year, and each new
well can add 800 to 1,000 barrels per day of new production. "


17 Mar 2016, 09:40 PM


Funky Town
Thanks McD. I may try to put a finer point on the decline rate based in part on your feedback. I wish the
10K gave comprehensive well counts, showing well types added. They stated 56 added wells for 2015 but
if you simply count the active wells by type, only 17 added wells are accounted for (2, 1, 7, & 7 for
producing, water inj, gas inj, and Mis inj, respectively, net additional wells by type over 2014 #s). I've
always assumed they capped some and that accounts for the persistent difference but I don't know
enough about field mgmt to guess how those are distributed across well types. At first glance that quote u
found is startling: each undrilled new well would contribute another approx. 1% to the decline rate. But how
many new producing wells will they forgo (as oppesed to other well types) and what net production will
they lose (if poorer wells that would have been capped are kept in production)? I appreciate that it might
be grim, but I'm not sure it has to be grim.

articles assumptions are unrealistic, even in their own less forgiving approach. I understand BPT uses CPI
All items, All Urban Consumers, US Cities Avg, and that we've had a small break in the Adj Factor recently
as low oil prices helped bring that metric down. But Core CPI (x food/energy) for Feb came in at 2.3%. The
only way BPT distributions recover is if oil rises, and CPI All Items will reflect that increase, adding it to a
now higher core inflation. The Fed has been wreckless chasing 2% and I think they'll get it. (Besides, if we
get deflation instead, WTI isn't going anywhere, so the whole exercise is moot). Long story short, my
model works w/ their adj factor (1.835) and increases it .005/Q representing slightly over 2%/yr.


For Production, I settled on a 4% decline per year, that I used to think was fair and even cautious, but now
w/ rig cuts might be generous. Incidentally, if I try to find data to support a better decline rate, the ONLY
way I can do it is to examine the 10K tables from before 2015, when they used to provide Field and BPT
production for oil and condensate separately. If u focus only on the BPT Oil from 08 to 13, you could argue
a decent recent stretch of about 2% decline rate, ignoring the historic higher decline rate for condensate,
and it's now larger proportion of total based on the 2014 shift to higher participation rate. I can't come
close to justifying 1 1/2% the article used.


Finally I skipped any discounting. With ZIRP, NIRP and financial represession, who needs to discount a
fairly short stream, esp at 10%?


Anyway, I ran numbers based on 3/16/16 prices/futures. I've got the APR distribution at 7 cents if WTI is
stable for the next 2 weeks.


If WTI follows the futures curve, I've got BPT paying a total of $5.30, with last payment 2018 Q4.


If WTI follows the curve plus $5 at every date, BPT pays $9.21; last payment 2019 Q4.


If WTI follows the curve plus $10, BPT pays $14.09; last payment 2020 Q4.


If WTI were to hold steady at 3/16 closing price ($38.46), BPT pays $2.27; last payment 2017 Q4. Yikes.


So a base case is an undiscounted $5.30 based on WTI futures. Even after the recent selloff, BPT is
trading with a large optionality premium.


A final rub that the article doesn't address is the progressivity of production taxes for higher WTI (because
their future prices don't get there). Under the 2014 tax regime, I show prod taxes for $75 WTI at 10% or
$7.50/bl. Since my Adj Chargable Costs reaches $67.5 in 2022 Q4, $75 WTI would not earn a royalty
beginning in that Q, even if the trust were still operating. For $100 WTI, I show taxes at 18% or $18. My
Adj Chargable Costs reaches $82 in 2024 Q4, so $100 Oil doesn't earn a royalty beginning then... all this
assuming the trust isn't terminated before these timeframes on lower WTI/distributions.


So... these projections show me a stunning optionality premium that requires a major shift from present
WTI futures to work out, w/ a pretty harsh "soft cap" on upside if WTI goes a lot higher (my Adj Chargeable
Cost, excluding Prod taxes for 2015.4 is $90/bl, to put a fine point on it).


I'd be interested in any reactions you have since I presume you model this yourself.

Bill, March 9th Carl Surran says "BP" says it will decrease the number of rigs working at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's
North Slope to two from five, a move likely to cut oil production and more than 200 jobs. But is this in our "BPT"
fields. And I did not know the word "Superstition" applied to this conversation. But Funky is great at explaining this
mess.

Marilyn,


The rigs are for drilling NEW wells. The old wells eventually run dry so they have to constantly drill new
wells to keep the volumes up. They just will be drilling less new wells now, not closing any wells.


15 Mar 2016, 04:28 PM


Pablomike
MM,
While the trust gets 16% from these wells BP gets the other 84%. They are cutting rigs most likely
because it is not profitable for them to keep drilling more wells until the price of oil moves higher. Nothing
nefarious here just business.


07 Apr 2016, 01:39 PM


Funky Town
MM,
Honestly, and will all due respect, you're engaging in superstition. You seem to believe BP has a motive to commit
fraud by under-reporting production, apparently because they owe lots of money on legal settlements and
presumaby because they are prepared to risk prosecution and law suits to steal assets; You seem to wonder if
they're making a field grab to profit going forward by excluding BPT unit holders. The problem is, that such an
explanation or theory is not needed to explain anything that's happened w/ distributions or BPT trading price. BPT
has always be capped at the first 90K barrels production per day, and the APR distribution almost certainly will be
based on over 80K, so even if they were cheating, they'd be cheating small. So why would they do it? The trust
paid .60 cents per unit last Q, so this fiscal year is already in the bag as having exceeded $1M/fiscal year, so they
can't expedite the trust termination by playing w/ the upcoming distribution. That dist will very likely be between 2
and 8 cents. And that is the problem for unit holders. These WTI prices, for the BPT structure, without any fraud,
are grim. The go-foward can look better if WTI increases, but the cost structure, by way of contract, escalates
brutally beginning in 2018. No fraud required.

Bill, As Funky Town indicated $100.00 oil is or could be at stake here. $80.00 ,$90.00, Who really knows. We
watched it move to over a hundred pretty fast. Getting those oil fields back for "BP"?????????????


15 Mar 2016, 02:41 PM


Marilyn McGuire
Bill, Where was the well they just turned off located? Is it going to affect the trust? Lot's of info not given when they
posted this "CAS" bulletin. I know the distribution is tied to 90,000 barrels and a ten cent distribution is rough but
we are wondering what's happening with the wells and the fields? No info for unit holders.

What is purpose of this article? To drive down the stock price so that the shorts can make money? Sure looks that
way.


15 Mar 2016, 12:23 PM


Funky Town
Probably. I'd be cynical but bottom line, BPT either pays or doesn't; WTI will either recover or it won't. The
Trust doesn't need a market cap to secure financing or for any other reason. If it didn't drop on the CAS
release or this article, it would have dropped on something else or the bad distribution coming in APR.
Maybe the shorts will drive it so low it becomes a great buy again. Who knows.


15 Mar 2016, 06:15 PM


Funky Town
Meh. The illustration is compelling for what it is, as it should be (because the basic facts indeed support a
conclusion that the party in BPT is mostly over at these oil prices). As mentioned in a comment above however,
there is some optionality value for higher oil prices in the out years. The escalting cost structure really kicks in
beginning in 2018, at it's fairly harsh. I have it reaching approximately $66.50 per barrel in 2022. If WTI were
trading at 100/bbl that year, for example, it would still nicely cover the escalated cost and the approximate $18 per
barrel production tax (at that WTI price, under the current regime, assuming Alaska doesn't revert back to Palin's
windfall profits approach), netting a nice per barrel royalty. I understand there may be better ways to capture that
optionality for upside in WTI, but I suspect there are countless investors who view BPT as an easier way to
express that view than alternatives such as the futures market. The path to (possibly) higher WTI prices matters

though, as this thing can't go "two successive years" paying less than $1M or it shuts down.

Funky Town, Is there anyway they, {BP} can "cheat" the unit holders of "BPT". The "Trust" is allowed the
oil in the Pess and Ivishak formations , collectively known as the Prudhoe Bay {Permo-Triassic} Reservoir,
and does not pertain to the Lisburne and Endicott formations. This is the largest producing oil field in North
America. With the problems that "BP" has had in the past do you think the money they collect off all their
"oil fields" in Alaska are tempting to hold back information. It almost takes a lawyer or someone with a lot
of knowledge to understand the jargon. They owe a lot of money.


15 Mar 2016, 01:12 PM


Bill Cunningham, Contributor
Marilyn,


"do you think the money they collect off all their "oil fields" in Alaska are tempting to hold back
information."


They're not withholding any information. Recently, production has been the max that you get paid for
(16%+ of 90,000 brls/day.).You're getting paid based upon WTI, which is a public figure. Payments have
gone down for a logical reason, the decrease in oil prices. Why would you think that BP could be cheating
you?


The author has presented a good model. Use your estimate of future oil prices and figure out how much
you think you'll get paid before the Trust ends.


15 Mar 2016, 01:31 PM


Marilyn McGuire
Bill, I think all of this is a way to get those fields back in 2 years with out much notice from unit holders. I
realize what is happening all over the world is bad for all oil companies but????????? They have not been
the most trust worthy company. Some where there is a catch.


15 Mar 2016, 02:13 PM


Funky Town
"Is there anyway they can cheat..."


MM, I'm not sure if that Q is rhetorical or real, but I'd say a couple things. First, compared to other stuff I've
owned and researched, BPT is actually more straight-forward and simpler to evaluate, with fewer
structural complexities whereby cheating could be hidden. Honestly, read any 10K of any decent sized
company, and you should be completely aware of how much investors must, at the end of the day, assume
some basic level of honesty and an absence of planned fraud. I assume the 1989 working interest is quite

well defined and understood, and BP operational and accountant folks are well practiced at reporting
production accurately. From my view, the production data and other financial information coming out on
every 10K has made sense and reflects a pattern that it is perfectly reasonable.


Having said that, there's no way a unit holder can "audit" the production volumes (or frankly, the production
taxes). I just don't see fraud as a material risk here. The much greater concern is that some investors don't
understand its basic structure (thou the 10Ks provide it), and at present WTI prices, the trust may surprise
such investors w/ how little distribution it pays. Of course BPT has additional "optionality" value for
improving WTI prices, but its critical to examine the escalating cost structure so you understand what WTI
price path is necessary to earn more money, and to understand the end game when the trust is
terminated. That cost structure is, and has been, very plainly explained in every 10K I remember reading.
Folks just need to digest the info so they can see the breakeven WTI price that actually results in a per
barrel royalty being paid. Then they can project their own WTI price curve and make their own valuation
judgment.

@admas,


"Good luck with your shorts: you'll have to pay the lender you borrowed from its due "dividend" too? CAS owns
puts on BPT which expire 3/25? Too late to buy them now. Good luck and let us know if you made any money."


Yes, it can definitely be risky even if you've correctly analyzed the fundamentals. I shorted at about 26 before the
10K was released with the revised values, which I correctly assumed would attract negative attention. I am 95%
sure that this will take another tumble when the April pitiful distribution is announced, but despite that, I covered
about 25% of my short position late last week. (Pigs get greased, hogs get slaughtered, right? ) .


PS the "Due Dividend" in April will be a non issue.

Make sure you have a smart collar (some well chosen bundle of call options which may not be that cheap) or else
you may have to cover your shorts which often results in losses; everybody knows that. There seems to be a fair
amount of calls traded, what do they know you don't know or don't want to know? It all boils down to the price of
WTI which appears to have bottomed and is trending up. Any spike in WTI may wipe you out and then some, you
are essentially speculating and most speculators lose, right? Good luck with your shorts: you'll have to pay the
lender you borrowed from its due "dividend" too? CAS owns puts on BPT which expire 3/25? Too late to buy them
now. Good luck and let us know if you made any money.

Are you sure about the date? I don't think CAS ever specified that. I don't see an unusually large number
of puts expiring then, but I see a lot expiring on April 15 and June 17. It's makes more sense to have puts
expiring after the April distribution anyway.

@UNEMON,


"A short here ... is a bet on oil prices not seeing 70 USD within the next 5 years "...


I'l agree with you that that's what a short bet on BPT SHOULD be, but unfortunately this trades based upon
perceived yield, and the upcoming distribution is going to be horrendous (0-10C), so unless there is some weird
short squeeze, this will undoubtedly be cheaper in April. If you are bullish on oil, there are probably much better
risk /reward options available than buying BPT at the current price.


You are also correct to notice that BPT is extremely sensitive to changes in oil prices, as the that valuation change
from the 2014 10 K that you quoted indicates.

Not mentioned is the announcement by BP Alaska to pull 60% (3 of 5) rigs from the field. The assumed 1.5% rate
of production decline is incorrect even before that announcement. Historically it has been about a 4% decline,
even with the full rig count working the field. I expect that decline rate to increase significantly now.

Very Interesting Article ... but ... The problem is that if Prices go at .. let's say 70 by 2019 .. the the life of the Trust
will get well beyond 2020 ... A short here ... is a bet on oil prices not seeing 70 USD within the next 5 years ...

This is quite a change from Dec 31, 2014 ... 
" BP Alaska calculated that as of December 31, 2014 production of oil and condensate from the proved reserves
allocated to the 1989 Working Interests will result in undiscounted estimated future cash flow to the Trust of
$2,106.7 million, with a net present value of estimated future cash flows at 10% discount of $1,402.5 million."

Patrick McGowen, Contributor
You skipped the sentence before this in that annual report "Based on the 2014 twelve-month average WTI
Price of $94.99 per barrel..." Let me translate the above statement (remember divide above numbers by
21.4 million shares). if oil stays at $94.99 per barrel, cash flow to the trust will be $94.24 per share before
the cash flow goes to zero and the trust dissolves. If you discount (i.e., expect a return for your risk) the
present value of the 94.24 is $65 per share. Most of this money will be passed along to shareholders
through dividends, of course after trust admin fees. Keep in mind that not only is it insane to think oil will
get back to $95, but we are now another year closer to 2018 when the trust is essentially forced to sunset
due to the heavy yearly increases in chargeable costs.

Excellent article. Does the 10 K have a specific estimate of the annual production decline? Your article sees to
imply that they assume production will be flat but I was under the impression that thye do project a few percent/yr.
