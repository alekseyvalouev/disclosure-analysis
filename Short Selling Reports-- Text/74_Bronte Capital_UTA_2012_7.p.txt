The sometimes eccentric views of John Hempton

Dear Shareholder: the woman from the Propaganda
Department will now provide you information
Universal Travel Group - a Chinese company whose stock is now suspended - is no stranger to my
readers. 
 
If you need a background the initial post is much fun: 
 


Travelling through China with the Universal Travel Group


 
Six months after I wrote that post (which suggested that the Universal Travel Group was complicated)
the stock was suspended. The auditor (the fifth) resigned. 
 
Normally this means that the company winds up trading on the pink-sheets and the stock
goes asymptotically to zero. 
 
Not this time though. Universal Travel seems determined to clean up its accounts and trade again on
the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
They have hired a new auditor. 
 
They appointed a new Chief Operating Officer. 
 
And they appointed a new board member. 
 
This new board member is probably very good at spin - which will be useful as the company tries to
persuade the New York Stock Exchange to reinstate its listing. 
 
Here is her CV: 
 


Ms. Moling Shang has served during her career in several jobs in the communications
division of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). From 1984
through 1996, Ms. Shang was the Chief of the Propaganda Department in the
Information Bureau of the CPC's Central Committee. From 1996 to 1999, Ms. Shang
served in numerous positions including Associate Director of News Agency for China
Central Television and her previous role as the Chief ofPropaganda. Following her
successful completion of her previous roles, Ms. Shang was appointed Deputy Chief of
Propaganda in the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee where she
was responsible for the Three Represents campaign from 1999 through 2002. From
2002 to 2010, she served as Deputy Chief of the Information Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee. Ms. Shang graduated from the Branch School of Peking University.


 
She is the former Deputy Chief of Propaganda of the Information Bureau of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee. 
 
I am sure she will keep shareholders informed.

John, one of your funniest posts in a while, and they did all the work for you, how
convenient!

Absolutely hilarious. If her spin is anything like the Three Represents campaign, all I can
say is that her strategy is to dull everyone's senses into accepting her spin at face value. I
start snoring every time CCTV starts to talk about the Three Represents. To this day I
have no clue what is being represented. And I negotiate Chinese language contracts for a
living, so it's not a language issue.

Hilarious and insightful :) 
 
To this day, I wonder if American corporate fraudsters learned from their Chinese
counterparts, or visa versa. Then again, it could just be an unavoidable characteristic of
the human condition. 
 
I've been reading (on and off) about some of the more notorious frauds in the US around
2000, and it seems that similar red flags, and behavioral patterns are very much alive and
well today. 
 
It's unfortunate...but I guess it gives me something (worthwhile) to do in life; you might
even say, it's my calling.

Hilarious! 
 
But what's in it for her? Is there any cash left?

Corruption is an unavoidable Chinese characteristic. No civil society = widespread
corruption. Corruption is a huge part of mainland China today, thank god the British
taught a part of China how to behave.

Bad thoughts Mr Hempton! Western man cannot appreciate glorious achievements of
CPC and of our esteemed Chinese enterprises. UTC is laudable organisation that will
faciliate all your travel needs - as outlined in our new five year plan!

I sometimes wonder how much China has learned from her interaction with Britian. I'm
curious because one of the main lessons was, when you have your opponent at a
millitary disadvantage, crush them and force them to buy smack at gunpoint.

The Three Represents was more effective than Obama's Three Fixes, fix healthcare, fix
energy, fix education.  
 
But it seems UTA has not learned the lesson and is reaching for more fix bla.
