Cellular Biomedicine: Strong Sell On CAR-T Failure, Dishonesty
Allegations And Stock Promotion, -94.6% Downside

by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


With paid stock promotion CBMG has achieved an unsustainable $500m valuation,
and with $20m in stock sold and insiders stock registered to sell, I expect CBMG will
continue to collapse.


CBMG "Car-T" technology was acquired for $1.8m, has experienced patient deaths
and is worthless. CBMG recent R&D of just $4.9m makes the $500m valuation
clearly absurd.


CBMG founders face dishonesty allegations, are responsible for alleged illegal
offshore stem cell clinic, while partnered with John Mattera who is currently serving
11 years in prison for fraud (again).


Multiple accounting and financial integrity issues, CFO and Auditor turnover,
"material weaknesses" and "inability to timely file" a full 50% of quarterly SEC filings
raises accounting and financial integrity questions.


Assuming CBMG is "real" and generously valuing CBMG on fundamentals show
-94.6% near term and imminent downside.


(Editors' Note: Derek Muhs's representation contests the claims made in this article
regarding M1NT's comments about Muhs. The author has updated their views on the
claims made on M1NT's site in the article below)


I believe Cellular Biomedicine (NASDAQ:CBMG) is another worthless Chinese reverse
merger using paid stock promotion. Detailed research proves CBMG has imminent -87%
to -94.6% near-term downside.


CBMG was previously focusing on Nintendo screens for RVs and Boats and then
morphed into a consulting firm claiming to help Chinese companies access American
investors. Now, along with "paid consultant" LifeTech Capital and a strange $1.8m
acquisition, CBMG has seen its stock temporarily increase by nearly 400% to a $500m
valuation based on a hype driven biotech story.

What investors don't know is CBMG's claimed CAR-T technology has in fact recently seen
patients die, while detailed research indicates this technology is un-viable and clearly
worthless. Even more concerning, CBMG was apparently spawned from an alleged illegal
offshore stem cell clinic named "WA Optimum" charging $30k+ for treatments which
famous Stanford scientists claim have "no scientifically valid reason", "treatments" that the
Chinese government apparently made illegal. Furthermore, it seems WA Optimum was
forced to backtrack after making multiple claims about university and doctor connections
later shown to be incorrect as disclosure issues abound.


Even worse, CBMG founders apparently partnered with a famous fraudster, John Mattera,
who is now currently serving an 11 year prison sentence for a "blatant fraud" involving the
theft of over $12.6m. Before founding CBMG, M1NT is quoted as saying Derek Muhs
sought employment as a sales representative at the M1NT restaurant. While the links
have mysteriously disappeared, M1NT previously described Muhs as "extremely
dishonest" and "untrustworthy" on a public part of their website. Furthermore, CBMG co-
founder Derek Muhs has no medical background I can find. Derek Muhs apparently
contests this view, and according to M1NT he was a managing director, but I find this
extremely curious considering M1NT's crystal clear past commentary about Muhs.
Investors can make up their own minds by doing their own background checks on Muhs if
they somehow believe he is still the single best steward of capital they can find in a huge
world of investment opportunities.


Lastly, a confusingly complex web of offshore subsidiaries, recent CFO turnover and a
new audit firm all while internal controls have experienced past "material weaknesses"
with restatements all raise serious questions about the integrity of the financial
statements.


With paid stock promotion losing momentum and CBMG successfully having sold $20m in
stock, CBMG stock has begun breaking down violently. Even if you believe CBMG is an
honest company, optimistically adding up the value of their acquisitions and businesses,
you still get more than -90.3% near term downside from the current price.


I believe a $500m valuation for a questionable team of people with minimal R&D spending
and just $5.2m of cash spent on latest acquisitions, hyping worthless and un-viable
biotech compounds simply does not make sense. As the primarily retail shareholder base

realizes what is going on, I expect CBMG stock to continue imploding back to its recent
stock price of $5.08 per share before eventually going much, much, much lower.


All estimates, research and opinions shared below for you to form your own opinion as all
intelligent investors should do.


CBMG: Paid Stock Promotion


I do not suggest anyone, EVER, invest in any company that pays to promote their stock.
Time and time again we have seen how these end and with 10k+ stocks in the US alone,
and there is no reason I can see to invest in any company of this poor quality. I
recommend you read the extensive research below and form your own opinions.


If you look at CBMG's history you will see that from the start CBMG was initially working
with Jeff Ramson of Proactive Capital famous for ties to exposed stock promoter "Tech
Guru". I think I can safely conclude CBMG knew what the game plan was from the start.


I believe the latest temporary move up for CBMG started February 2 this year when Boca
Raton FL based "LifeTech Capital" issued a "report" with $23.75 price target. The
disclosures in the fine print at the end of LifeTech's report, however, prove clear
compensation along with direct conflicts of interest. LifeTech claims this payment is for "
drug pipeline and operational review and recommendations" which I find curious and even
if you believe this, the blatant conflict of interest here for someone theoretically publishing
research for free on a company that paid them is beyond dispute.

Unfortunately for LifeTech, their twitter feed is etched into internet stone for eternity. As an
interesting template for CBMG let's take alook at how some of LifeTech's past stocks
worked.

The most important part of the above chart is the red box showing % returns to
shareholders over the time frame, which I have summarized in the chart below of average
returns to investors of these companies.

We can see shareholders who held these stocks over the above time frame lost -75.27%
of their investment on average (so far, with probably a lot more downside). To give you
context of how horrific this is, remember over the past 5 years biotech stocks as a sector

are literally having the best bull market they have ever experienced. Over the same time
frame the diversified IBB biotech ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) has increased +226%. While
LifeTech and Dunn have been involved with many many stocks over many many time
frames with different recommendations, what I find striking is the consistent tendency for
any stock he is involved with to be a financial disaster over time.


How could anyone possibly have their stocks perform that badly during the biggest biotech
bull market of history?


To understand how LifeTech is so bad, we can dig a little deeper into the LifeTech Sr.
Managing Director and "analyst" Stephen Dunn with firm Aurora Capital. If we look at his
FINRA registration we can see Stephen Dunn is employed by both Aurora Capital (parent
co of LifeTech) and also "NextWave Research inc." which apparently "provides company
sponsored research" and is run from Dunn's house. We can also see Stephen Dunn was
at Jesup & Lamont Securities Corp in 2009, which FINRA eventually expelled in 2010.


Looking at Aurora Capital's FINRA disclosures also shows an interesting set of regulatory
disclosures including fines for"inaccurate financial books and records" and "failing to
maintain minimum capital requirements".


Perhaps most interestingly though, Stephen Dunn just days ago announced an attempt to
fold LifeTech into "Newbridge Securities Corporation" and terminated coverage on CBMG
(unlikely to be a positive for CBMG stock).

Newbridge Securities Corporation FINRA disclosures are shocking (emphasis mine).
Allegations include "a former Newbridge representative converted over $160,000 from two
Newbridge customers accounts by wiring the funds from their accounts to bank accounts
he opened in their names," plus a $600k (!) fine regarding "facilitate[ing] the manipulative
trading of the stock of a company created as the result of a reverse merger". Furthermore
,Newbridge allegedly "execute[d] pre-arranged in-house agency cross and wash
transactions that were intended to generate volume and support the price of the stock" as
well as "registered representative used Newbridge's market making capacity to
manipulate the shares of securities." This SEC lawsuit is interesting background reading
on Newbridge as well.


I also find Stephen Dunn's disclosure puzzling from this 2/19/15 CBMG story:


3) Stephen Dunn: I or my family own shares of the following companies mentioned in this
interview: None. I personally am or my family is paid by the following companies
mentioned in this interview: None. My company has a financial relationship with the
following companies mentioned in this interview: Cellular Biomedicine Group


His 2/2/15 LifeTech report disclosure above clearly states he was paid and expecting to
collect fees, is expecting banking fees plus, if Stephen Dunn is so wildly bullish and
recommending the stock to others why is it he apparently owns zero CBMG stock?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3054796-cellular-biomedicine-strong-sell-on-car-t-failure-dishonesty-allegations-and-stock-promotion-minus-94_6-percent-downside


Given LifeTech's history of investor financial disaster and association with a firm with
allegations of manipulating stock prices of reverse merger stocks, I would not listen to
Stephen Dunn, LifeTech or anything they are involved in.


It's not only Stephen Dunn and his group involved with CBMG though, the See Through
Equity shop has been involved in promoting CBMG, as has the comically bad
StockNewsNow.com who promoted CBMG also seems to be a paid stock promotion
website given their disclaimer about company compensation. Another paid stock
promotion firm "Wide World of Stocks!" was also apparently paid to promote CBMG with
host Damon Roberts, famous for his extensive infomercial experience. CBMG also paid
for the "Life Sciences Report", also mentioned in Richard Pearson's famous stock
promotion research piece, while CBMG also apparently paid StreetWise Reports as well
(see disclosure at bottom).


In fact, CBMG's 10k discloses that expenses decreased driven by a"A decrease in
investor relations expense of $1,543,000". Shamwow! That means just the decline was a
full 20% of their G&Athe previous year was pure "investor relations" cost! If their investor
relations expenses declined by over $1.5m in one year what was the total?!


One important red flag is when a biotech stock with theoretically half a billion in
(temporary) valuation has essentially no intelligent institutional investors involved. We can
see 73% of CBMG's shareholders are unsophisticated retail investors with no known
sophisticated institutional investors noted. If CBMG is such an amazing opportunity why
the weird reverse merger and paid stock promotion? Why no partnerships with credible
pharma companies orwell-known biotech investors?

When investing in small speculative biotech companies, we all agree founders and
management are the single most important factor. Therefore investment success is
absolutely reliant on ensuring you understand the past and quality of the people in charge
of your investment.


In order to understand CBMG I think you need to look at the mysterious history of CBMG's
founders, management and the crew of questionable individuals which collaboratively
allow this "business" to exist.


Unfortunately the CBMG team faces: multiple allegations of dishonesty with many
disclosure questions, connections to alleged illegal offshore stem cell clinic WA optimum
apparently engaging in illegal activities in China, plus direct partnerships with a convicted
fraudster currently serving an 11 year sentence in prison.


Derek Muhs, co-founded both CBMG and WA Health Care in 2009 below with CBMG
founder Shu Li and CBMG CEO William Cao.


It appears Derek Muhs's previous job before founding CBMG was working for Shanghai
restaurant M1NT. Muhs seems proud of this as we see his BusinessWeek and Bloomberg
profile claim: "he was instrumental in establishing M1NT" while his bio here states: "In
2008 he worked with a select group of international investors to launch M1NT Shanghai"
and here (click Read More under his Biography section):


"Derek completed his work operationally at M1NT and continues as a shareholder and
ambassador" while touting "He was one of the founders of the Atlantic International
Property Group, Managing Director and he served on the Board of Directors."


However, somehow after the first publication of this report the link was mysteriously taken
down but previously M1NT's website stated (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3054796-cellular-biomedicine-strong-sell-on-car-t-failure-dishonesty-allegations-and-stock-promotion-minus-94_6-percent-downside


"… Mr Muhs sought employment with M1NT as a sales representative and accepted
a salary of RMB22,000 per month from May 2008. During his employment Mr Muhs
caused significant disruptions and the Directors of the company willingly accepted
his resignation 10 months later and were most pleased to see him exit the business."


At no time was Mr Muhs a Director of the company nor a Founder or Managing
Director as he has claimed in the media and represented. M1NT's Directors
seriously caution any individuals or businesses against entering into dealings with
Mr Muhs and in no way supports his claims or credentials.


We found him to be highly dishonest and extremely untrustworthy and in no way
would recommend him to any enterprise wishing to uphold a respectable standing
within its industry sector."


Furthermore, I note Derek Muhs apparently has zero biotech or healthcare background I
can find but, just months after M1NT states he apparently departed a sales job at a
restaurant (earning barely ~$3,600 per month) he confusingly was founding an ostensibly
$500m Chinese stem cellbiotech company?!


Apparently Derek Muhs was in fact a managing director, which seems strange to me given
the extremely clear language from M1NT publicly on their website before. Even though the
M1NT quote is no longer hosted on the internet at this time, that does not change the
reality that M1NT clearly stated how they felt about Muhs's claims and statements.
Readers and investors beware, and I see zero reason to invest in anything or donate
money to anyone embroiled in this much strangeness. In fact, if I was investing even a
single Kenyan shilling in anything vaguely related to Derek Muhs, I would immediately hire
a private investigator to independently verify his claims through past coworkers which
were not personal references provided by Muhs himself.


Derek's other recent company appears to be a Chinese membership subscription offering
called Affinity, here is a picture of John Mattera (more on them shortly) and his wife at an
Affinity event.

Shu Li's linkedin lists himself as founder of CBMG but also does not list his involvement as
Chairman of "Global Health Investment Holdings, LTD" the obscure and opaque BVI shell
which held an enormous amount of CBMG stock and is a business partner to CBMG.


Dr. Shu Li apparently also thought it was worthwhile to research and pay to file this
hilarious patent regarding sleeping with your head below your feet in order to live longer
and increase "longevity".


Even more interesting, there is a curious lack of detail in regards toShu Li's involvement
with WA Optimum Health Care and WA regen. Shu Li's Bloomberg profile however lists
him as the founder and Chairman of WA Optimum while CBMG's current CEO William
Cao isalso noted as the COO and CTO at WA. In fact nearly the entire CBMG team is
connected to the WA Health Care venture.


Below we see previous CBMG CFO and current VP of Business Development Andrew
Chan seems to make no mention of his involvement with WA Optimum on his CBMG
website bio, while his Bloomberg bio states he is currently the CFO at WA Optimum? I
sAndy Chan still the current CFO at WA Health?


Also below is current CBMG director Nadir Patel (in the back) speaking at the ribbon
cutting for WA Optimum with Shu Lia and Derek Muhs, just before Nadir Patel was one of
the men to physically cut the red ribbon at WA's opening ceremony.


International Weekly Journal of Science: Nature exposed WA Optimum as an apparent
offshore stem cell shop allegedly operating illegally while claiming to treat everything from
Alzheimer's to autism with fat refined stem cells at the bargain price of ~$35k+.


A world-famous Stanford autism expert had this to say about the treatments:

"neurobiologist Ricardo Dolmetsch, an autism researcher at Stanford University in
California, says, "The consensus in the autism research community, as well as in the
stem-cell community, is that there is no scientifically valid reasonfor using stem cells
to treat autism spectrum disorders". He worries that, without the proper safety
studies in place, the treatments could "lead to serious complications like cancer and
autoimmune disease"


Hard to believe but it actually gets more worrisome as the WA Optimum Health debacle
continues:


"lists Li Lingsong, director of the Peking University Stem Cell Research Center, as a
member of its (WA Optimum's)science and technology board. Li denies this. "I have
so far nothing to do with WA," he told Nature, adding that he has asked the company
to remove his name. WA also claims a strategic alliance with Harvard Medical
School,although neither the medical school nor the Harvard Stem Cell Institute is
aware of any such connection. Likewise, the University of California, Irvine, where
WA claims to have research facilities, denies any formal relationship."


Also note that WA optimum seemingly opened After the Chinese government had banned
unregistered stem cell clinics. Do you feel CBMG's founders are honest, trustworthy
people who respect the law after reading this?


Just in case you don't think all this is directly relevant, note CBMG seems to have been
born out of the WA group per Hong Kong corporate records (and why did this company
seemingly change its name 4 times in 15 months?)

Mattera was just months away from being arrested 11/2011 for running a 2 year fraud
(again) and sentenced to 11 years in prison….


John Mattera has been jailed for fraud related charges multiple times doing one year in FL
jail as well as time in Kentucky, with a long career of scamming people stretching back to
1994. John Mattera just plead guilty for fraud (again) and is now serving an 11 year prison
sentence from accusations of everything from securities fraud to money laundering, where
according to the SEC lawsuit, Mattera and his crew defrauded investors of over $12.6m
which:


"Mattera has simply stolen to subsidize his lavish lifestyle of private jets, luxury cars and
jewelry."

"It's just blatant fraud," - Assistant US Attorney Eugen Ingoglia


John Mattera already had four earlier convictions for fraud prior to being invited to work
with the CBMG founders while literally 1 minute on Google turns this information up
immediately. How could CBMG's Shu Li, Andy Chan and William Cao not know exactly
who this man was?


Even more concerning is if we use the WayBack Machine (remember, everything on the
internet is there FOREVER) shows WA Optimum apparently offering SVF Knee Injection
on their website as well as claiming to treat Liver Cirrhosis with stem cells back in March
2013 while still offering SVF treatment as well as claiming to use Autologous stem cells to
treat Autism to this day.


Is WA Optimum using CBMG products through "Global Health Investment Holdings" to
pursue these activities in China? While I could not confirm or deny this, it seems possible
given WA Optimum's statements regarding CBMG's iso facility information as if it is
relevant to WA Optimum and the deep connections here with CBMG selling low volume of
machines used in similar labs. If true this creates serious risk of potential financial disaster
for CBMG if this is uncovered by the Chinese government, who recently stated "it would
be making greater efforts to clean up the stem-cell business."


Furthermore, recent CBMG board member Jeffrey H. Auer Back also has a questionable
past including an impressive tendency to have worked at firms FINRA expelled from the
industry.

Notably Westor Capital who FINRA filed cease and desist (before expulsion) alleging
"misappropriation and misuse of customer funds"while it appears Jeffery had to recently

despite being a director since October 2013 Jeffrey Auerbach is listed in CBMG's sec

CBMG is claiming to be running trials halfway around the world and is trusted by

But perhaps through some strange miracle of fate this strange team of people paying for

make sure you understand their "technology" claims.


Let's be clear: CBMG's autologous fat stem cell knee injection treatment is something that
has been around for many years and done around the world. In fact, CBMG founders
other company WA Optimum advertises they provide it right on their website!


Anyone with history in this niche will know there are literally dozens and dozens of other
companies already established as the leaders in this space, many of which are already
selling products and they have been financial disasters in their own right. To get you
started look at Intellicel Biosciences, Tigenix here, RegenaStem, SC21, here, here, here
and here. I could go on but there are countless. Assuming CBMG legitimately believes this
is real, they are years behind and the service is offered cheaply all around the world
already.


Dr. Berman is a cosmetic surgeon from Beverly Hills, Ca who administers stem cell
treatments and is one of the lead doctors at WA Health. Through WA Health, Dr. Berman
is a direct associate of CBMG CEO William Cao, as we can also see in the picture below.


Interesting from a disclosure perspective…


WA Optimum and CBMG CEO William Cao's associate Dr. Berman is actually already
administering these stem cell treatments and interestingly, he is very clear: he uses the
LipoKit and Maxstem units from South Korea (no CBMG products mentioned) and the
whole process takes about two hours. There are even other Chinese clinics (aside from
WA) that offer this with many more globally.


We know these knee joint treatments are offered all around the world cheaply, and
CBMG's Shu Li, Andy Chan, Derek Muhs and William Cao are all closely associated with
Dr. William Berman through WA Health. Therefore I find it interesting Dr. William Berman
has publicly made his view on commercializing these treatments very clear, when
discussing why big pharma does not seem interested he notes:


"it is hard to monetize and commercialize autologous cells"


It seems this is exactly what CBMG is trying to do though! Clearly CBMG founders believe
Dr. Berman to be an expert or they would not have him as one of their lead doctors at WA.
Furthermore, Dr. Berman is discussing the developed market of the US where IP
protection is world class. If monetization of these processes are not viable in the US, how
could it possibly be reasonable to try and do this in China where IP protection is non
existent?

Further supporting this point, the shareholder returns for those invested in the Stem Cell
Osteo Arthritis companies (which all seem to be years ahead of CBMG) has been a
disaster. Tigenix for example is already selling their product in Europe with real approval
and collecting royalties. Despite that and during an incredible rally in biotech stocks,
Tigenix shareholders have STILL lost -90% of their money.

I think we can all safely agree CBMG's osteoarthritis pursuits are worthless, and even if
they had value, CBMG could not possibly commercialize them successfully in China.


CBMG CAR-T: $1.8m cash paid, dead patients, obviously NOTworth $118m+


Reminiscent of dot-com days when a company would add ".com" to their name to see the
stock soar, CBMG paid $1.8m in cash for this obscure CAR-T "technology", LifeTech
capital immediately increased their price target valuation by $8.75 per share (with CBMG
fully13.2m diluted share count this is $118m in value, and recall CMBGhas paid LifeTech).
In response CBMG's stock has temporarily soared but I do not believe CBMG's $1.8m
acquisition of this questionable little technology nobody has heard of is worth $110m+.

Let me explain….


Not all CAR-T therapies are created equal, and with big pharma spending billions per year
on world-class CAR-T programs as they scour the tiny medical community in this oncology
niche, I think it is safe to say CBMG spending $1.8m on this is probably not worth
spending time elaborating on for obvious reasons. Notably, we have seen this pattern
countless times (OHR Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:OHRP) is the latest example) where a
random speculative biotech acquires a compound which apparently nobody cares about
for a pittance, only to hype it up beyond reason, before the stock collapses on (not)
surprisingly bad data.


First I note CBMG has essentially zero IP protection and the CAR-T space itself is
notorious for questionable IP and intense competition. CBMG is located in perhaps the
single worst country on earth for protecting IP and barely has any patents anyway. Even if
this was valuable, there seems to be nothing stopping another Chinese company or
hospital from stealing it.


Second, there are dozens of other companies in CAR-T trials right now, and if they are
successful there is nothing stopping them from selling their drug in China or for the
wealthy Chinese (only people in China who could afford this) to just fly to a country where
the treatment is being administered. Similar to how some poor patients could fly to
Shanghai for WA Optimum's dubious $30k+ stem cell autism "treatments".

CBMG's CAR-T acquisition is of CD19, CD20 and CD30 led by WeiDong Han of PLA
General Hospital.


The first red flag is, far as I can tell, Wei Dong Han has only published two studies on
CAR-T with his other published studies spread across some pretty absurd topics including
"rekindling hair loss" and some weird report studying the impact of crushing four old
Chinese herbs with Diabetic Wounds. Where is the years of cancer and CAR-T expertise?


First study is involving ONE (singular) patient, aside from the fact that any study involving
a single patient is clinically useless, if you read the study you will find see that the
treatment seems to have quickly began failing after just two weeks.


And even more concerning is the language about serious cytokine and immune system
issues where the patient apparently died 13 weeks after treatment after florid disease
progression occurring followed administration.


The only other published study on CAR-T from Wei Dong Han I found listed was a very
confusing study. First of all, this study only enrolled 7 patients total, a number of patients
that does not seem could possibly produce any statistically significant data. Second, the
study looks very dangerous to me with one patient dying of "massive alimentary tract
hemorrhage" while three of the patients developed continuous elevation of cytokines that
had to be resolved by the discontinuous administration of corticosteroid and/or etanercept.
The patients all seem to have experienced severe side effects while

The much touted sole patient to show remission we find only had residual disease to
begin with! It's pretty easy to cure a patient if he is already cured…


(click to enlarge)


The other study referenced in the CBMG press release apparentlyhad a whopping TWO
patients who received the allogeneic CAR-CD19 T cell therapy, and one of them (half of
that small sample) seems to me the patient died from GVHD from the treatment!


"at the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). One ofthose patients eventually
died of GVHD, but the othergradually reached a complete hematologic remission
and apartial regression of her extramedullary leukemic lesions."


If half the patients who receive your treatment DIE, this is not a reason to be "optimistic".
Given the numerous issues here, I can see why CBMG was the only successful buyer and
why it only cost them $1.8m. Aside from promotional press releases, I think this
acquisition is clearly worthless.

CBMG's CSC Joint Venture: Limited Rights in Narrow Markets With Expiring
Contracts


CBMG's TC-DC, MNP and NP are in-licensed from the curious" California Stem Cell".


I find this aspect of CBMG most interesting as CBMG's narrow indications and limited
geography is based on Neostem's (NBS) owned technology, which NBS paid just $36m in
stock for all of CSC. Furthermore, CBMG has what seems to me to be a very narrow claim
on CSC technology in just a limited geography so clearly thatis worth a tiny fraction of the
$36m total CSC value. Despite NBS demonstrable superiority on this aspect, NBS trades
for 1/5 the market cap of CBMG! If an investor is so bullish on CBMG's involvement with
CSC why not just buy NBS for 1/5 the price?


Even worse CBMG's rights expire in just 6 years at which point NBS/CSC can cancel the
agreement. Considering it would take CBMGat least another 3 years to finish trials, this
seems like a disaster. Even more ludicrous, for the MNP/NP collaboration the contract is
only at 2 year intervals and at those dates can be canceled as well.These terrible terms
and worthless technology is likely why CBMG only paid CSC a $1m milestone and why
NBS bought CSC outright for just $36m and paid for it nearly entirely in overvalued stock.


That is all likely to be irrelevant though, because since CBMG originally signed, CSC was
acquired by NBS and NBS failed their primary endpoint and collapsed. I believe NBS is
another worthless biotech promoted by Patrick Cox and others. The technology which
CBMG is partially licensing has already been deconstructed in detail and shown to be
worthless so I will spare you the gory details.


CSC also has a questionable past of its own that certainly creates some doubts about its
legitimacy for me. This NBS press release from 4/14/2014 states that Dr. Hans Keirstead
is the current CEO of CSC. Dr. Hans Keirstead had been involved with a host of
shareholder disasters and curious companies.


Most notably, Kierstead was noted as partner to International StemCell Corp
(OTCQB:ISCO) which was also promoted and then curiously dropped by the incredible
Patrick Cox, which marketed a stem cell anti wrinkle cream. We see below that ISCO
investors have lost-97.81% of their money with no hope in sight.

CBMG Agreen Acquisition: Defunct FL Company with Uncompetitive Offering
Acquired at >16x Revenue?


CBMG's largest acquisition to date was for "Agreen" which appears to be based off a
failing FL based medical cell analysis and preparation Company run by a FL man whose
listed address is this house.

I'm honestly not trying to judge because I'm not a particularly fancy person myself and I
respect that. However, if Agreen had been a wild success worth $20m I think the owner
would probably at least have landscapers watering his lawn?


From the CBMG purchase agreement of Agreen we can see Agreen is apparently the
current iteration of Biomed Immunotech, which seems to have failed in the US as it was
started in 2003 but apparently not doing well 5 years later looking for subsidized office
space in 2008. Repeated calls to their phone number showed not even an active
voicemail, with a stale website and no updates other than an address change back in
2013 and the pricing list still from 2007. If you want to learn more about the "technology" it
explains it all there but it seems this is a commodity process as there are many
inexpensive competing services and products available to basically anyone that can
perform this fairly basic lab function here, here, here, here and here, etc., which
presumably is why Biomed failed in the US. I'm also confident if you call their old sales
partners here, their sales people will be happy to show you products that can get the job
done which are not from Biomed Immunotech.


Given the failed background, the acquisition price is jaw dropping. As a result, the
accounting of this transaction becomes pretty tortured as in order to justify the ridiculously
high price, CBMG's accountants had to ascribe a full $17.6m or 99% of $17.7m purchase
price to"goodwill and intangibles" which seems crazy because if you read the fine print of
the purchase contract Agreen apparently had <$1mof registered capital (5m rmb).

Agreen's profits go to a Jilin hospital for awhile with only 40% to Agreen, which doesn't
even matter much since Agreen's revenue is very small and has actually been declining
and the company is losing money.

How could this possibly be worth nearly $18m? I think since this business failed in the US,
it is likely to also fail in hyper competitive China where cost driven cut throat competition is
everywhere and IP protection is non existent. Even more confusing is that med equipment

businesses typically sell for 2-3x revenue so if you want to be optimistic, value Agreen at
3x the $1.1m in stated trailing revenue when acquired, or $3.3m total value, is a good
place to start and I don't understand how CBMG thought Agreen was possibly worth the
huge price they paid.


CBMG Accounting and Financial Statement Issues


Complex BVI structures are commonly associated with fraud as are Chinese reverse
mergers, with sharesleuth claiming 1 of 10 Chinese rtos in the US is fraud. With this
context it is very important when investing in a company like CBMG that you can trust and
understand the financials and accounting.


The first red flag that makes me concerned is, in my view, inexplicably complex corporate
VIE structure which potentially leaves CBMG stockholders very vulnerable. Remember
CBMG barely even has revenue and is a tiny speculative biotech with a small amount of
cash invested where you could likely recreate their facilities for<$5m. So why exactly does
this company require a spider web of a full EIGHT offshore subsidiaries around the world
to operate?


(from CBMG 10k)


Another red flag for me is that CBMG has been forced to restate their financials in the past
while the 2013 10-K stated:


"Our disclosure controls were determined to be ineffective based on the errors and
deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting as described below."

CBMG's auditor gave them a "going concern"statement and I estimate that of the last 8
quarterly 10q or 10k filings, CBMG has been forced to file a NT filing due to inability to
complete their filings on time. While CBMG claims to have remedied some of these
issues, I think this coupled with the quality of the team involved merits consideration.


CBMG's previous auditor Tarvaran Askelon & Company was also shown by the PCAOB to
have deficiencies regarding "potentially material misstatement in the audited financial
statements" and"failure to perform sufficient audit procedures" and then again in the next
examination a whole host of additional audit deficiencies were found.


CBMG Company Response:


I called CBMG literally more than ten times over the past weeks as I very much wanted to
answer some of the questions I have. However, it appears their phone number goes
straight to a voicemail and I was unable to ever get through to anyone.


Update, here is the CBMG company press release response claiming I maliciously
attacked their company. As is blatantly obvious, stated repeatedly, in my disclaimer, and
reiterated my members of the public in the comments section below: I share my opinions
and research for informing the public for the public good in an attempt to help and protect
the average unsophisticated investor.


Furthermore, it seems to me they did not address the points made in the research or
disagree with the fair value analysis clearly laid out below. I reiterate my near term price
target of $1.97 per share with long term price target of $0.0000


Also, it appears they rent this tiny place in Palo Alto, CA on a month-to-month basis, which
I do not find confidence inspiring.


Optimistically Valuing CBMG: -87% to -94.6% Downside


In valuing CBMG I am going to make a number of very generous assumptions to
demonstrate just how absurdly over valued CBMG stock has temporarily become. In the
analysis below I give CBMG credit for 100% of their R&D spending since end of 2012,and
we all know R&D is probably not even worth $0.50 on the dollar. I am also going to give
CBMG credit for 100% of their current cash value even though they are expected to burn
$15m+ this year. I will also generously assume the lab assay Agreen business is worth the
ridiculous 16x revenue CBMG paid for it and also assume the rest of their assets are
worth what management paid for them. Even using this very optimistic analysis we still
see CBMG has imminent near term downside of -89% if we average the two.

A more realistic analysis giving CBMG credit for 50% of the R&D spend, adjusting out the
-$15m cash burn for 2015, valuing the Agreen and Astromal businesses at 2x revenue,
discounting the Agreen patent and valuing the latest CAR-T acquisition at $0 (given
patient deaths), we get an estimated fair value with -94.5%downside from today's CBMG
stock price. Note that in order to make money in stocks you typically have to buy them for
a substantial discount to their fair value.

CBMG Stock Breaking Down Violently on Huge Volume


We all know what typically happens in the final innings of stocks with paid promotion and I
think we are seeing that now with CBMG. CBMG stock chart is exhibiting classic technical
broken-wedge pattern, note the huge increase in volume on the latest decline for
confirmation. Last time CBMG stock broke down back in 2014 it fell-75% from the peak
before finding support. We can see on the chart CBMG stock has no support near term
until the $11 (-75.4%) area but given the shares outstanding have ballooned dramatically
since then I think it's clear the next potential support on the chart is back to the price level
of $2.18 last year, for near term -89.18% downside.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3054796-cellular-biomedicine-strong-sell-on-car-t-failure-dishonesty-allegations-and-stock-promotion-minus-94_6-percent-downside


These downside targets also line up well with the average -75% declines we see from Life
Tech Capital stocks as well as the fundamental valuation analysis showing -90.3%
downside as well.


Conclusion:


I genuinely feel bad for CBMG shareholders who may have mistakenly gotten involved
because once you unravel what is behind the scenes and go through all the questionable
disclosures, CBMG seems clearly worthless or at least very close. Even if you assume
CBMG is an honest company, based on fundamentals alone there is at least near term
-91% downside.


Furthermore, CBMG's entire business model obviously doesn't make sense as IP
protection in China is nonexistent and I estimate CBMG has spent less than $12m in cash
total for what they have acquired recently, which doesn't come even close to justifying the
~$500m valuation. The stock has now begun breaking down violently and with insiders
and large shareholders free to sell stock as benefit from stock promotion fades, I expect
the stock will continue its implosion on the way towards true fundamental value of
$0.00-$4.77 per share.


In my research and valuation I sincerely tried to be fair but best I can tell it seems there is
virtually nothing of value at CBMG. In a nutshell I believe it is clear this group of extremely
questionable people, running a weird shell structure where CBMG shareholders have
limited claims to anything, only through paid stock promotion and hyping some weird and
worthless acquisitions, have they temporarily convinced investors this is worth HALF A
BILLION DOLLARS. This of course is absurd and is already falling apart.


On the PumpStopper "SCALE OF AWFUL" I rate CBMG a 1.41 out of 10, as CBMG is not
literally the single most awful thing I have ever seen (I'm looking at you GLRI) but CBMG
gets impressively close. As a result I would like to dedicate this song to the CBMG team,
because "you've earned it!"

It is also non shortable at other broker who is clearing through wedbush.

Nice job Pump Stopper. Wish I could short this. Pump Stopper deserves to profit from this, since they are doing the
due diligence to expose potential fraud. BBLU was another one they exposed. I recently received a call from the SEC
about BBLU. Not sure if there is fire where there is smoke with BBLU. Once in awhile the SEC does their job. Usually
after the small time investor has been fleeced. I appreciate the work Pump Stopper does even if I don't directly
benefit. At least it has made me very skeptical of who is pumping bull crap. Keep up the good work.

Nice research.


Small correction though: TiGenix's knee product (ChondroCelect) is not a stem cell product and has nothing to do with
adipose-derived cells. It is an ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation), using a patient's own cartilage cells
(chondrocytes) extracted from his knee, and implanting them back after expansion and thorough QC checks.
However, you are correct in saying that this product is not a big commercial success (net revenues are app. $1
million) which is your point. This is mainly due to its expensive manufacturing and competition from hospitals -- which
produce their own cell-based product outside of centralized EMA approval, something that should not be authorized
but which has never really been enforced. Those factors combined do not make ChondroCelect a terribly profitable
product, indeed. Besides, the FDA asked for a pivotal phase 3 to be performed before approval -- something the
company believed it could avoid due to its extensive data set from European trials -- which effectively killed the
product's prospect in the US, its most profitable market, as running such a clinical trial would have cost tens of
millions which the company could not afford.


Besides, I would stress the fact that any comparison between TiGenix and CBMG stops at both companies having
"knee related" products: TiGenix is a serious and transparent company, pioneering commercial stem cell research and
which can count companies such as Grifols, Novartis and Roche among its shareholders. TiGenix's current pipeline is
now focusing on allogeneic adipose-derived stem cell products (hence your confusion I guess) but this is not intended
to treat bone or cartilage defects -- the company is running a phase 3 trial in Crohn's disease fistulas, a phase 2 in RA
and a phase 1 in severe sepsis. TiGenix's poor stock performance in the last years is entirely attributable to the
disappointing sales performances of ChondroCelect but does not fairly value the potential in new indications -- that is
my opinion, of course.


More details can be found here:


http://seekingalpha.co...


That being said, I appreciate your work on denouncing scam biotechs surfing on the stem cell or CAR-T vibe to
sustain unrealistic valuations for the sole profit of their insiders. Those reflect very badly on the field and there needs
to be some cleaning done.

You deserve praise Pump Stopper. We need people exposing charlatans. I applaud you, and feel any reward you get
is well deserved. Even when I don't personally benefit, you are doing a great service to correct a market that is losing
confidence of the average investor. If the market wants to have any credibility, they have to get control of the outright
fraud you expose. I just wish I could play a larger role in your work. A profit in doing so would be a nice reward. That
is why I truly believe there is a market for what you do. People who work to right fraudulent activities are the most
deserved of being rewarded.

Went long 5,000 SH at avg of about 25. Was looking for an entry point for weeks and Citron gave it to me. Not at all
impressed by the short thesis, which does nothing more than go on and on about the crookedness of people and/or
entities with which CBMG has little or no relationship. The truth is that the CAR-T results were quite good, CURRENT
management pedigree is excellent, and the partnership between CBMG and China's leading academic hospital
(PLAUGH) makes CBMG an outstanding CAR-T play with tremendous upside and little downside at a 230M or so
MC. I suspect at least half of the comments here are Citron plants. Retail was lied to and played by Citron for a huge
short term profit. That goes for both those scared into selling, and those that shorted late. This will be back in the 30s
within weeks at the very latest.

CBMG‘s CD19 CAR-T showed a complete response rate of 22% in adult patients with R/R B-cell ALL, while
JUNO's CD19 CAR-T achieved a complete response rate of 90% in similar population.


08 Apr 2015, 09:16 PM


Bigwig99
Yes for CD19 2 of 9 complete remission and 4 of 9 partial remission overall response rate 66.66%. Promising
results. Also had promising results for CD20. Partnership with top China Hospital PLAGH gives CBMG
access to a potentially vast portfolio of CAR-T cell candidate therapies. This affiliation and not "promotion"
coincided with the CBMG PPS run up. 
Is CBMG JUNO...no it is surely not. Just as surely as it is not JUNO, it is not remotely a scam. They were any
easy target with recent run-up, China affiliation, and low float. I had no position UNTIL the hit piece BTW, so
while I find it distasteful I was grateful for the buying opportunity (as apparently are some others).

The article was insightful for novice investor such as myself. I have previously heard some of these allegations
concerning the management team. However, I was somewhat challenged by your lack of real evaluation of the market
potential of the ReJoin product. As a previous poster indicated, TiGenix offers a different product which is challenged
by the "home-brew" allowed in some markets. In truth, "home-brew" will remain a challenge until a company
manufacturers a device and a diagnostic ensuring an efficacious autologous product which provides evidence of
clinical benefit. The ReJoin product offers a alternative to HA which is proven to offer no lasting clinical benefit. The
clinical evidence is still in early stage but the value proposition is significant if the data holds. Bad characters don't
necessarily equal bad science. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells as a way to actually treat osteoarthritis will win
huge, if its proven to work. Today there is no treatment for knee osteoarthritis. Modern medicine only offers palliative
care and then implants. ReJoin and Biomet Biologics NStride which is an autologous protein solution offer the best
options for actually treating the disease state. If they work, ultimately CBMG (or it's purchaser) and Zimmer will win
huge. OA is most common musculoskeletal disease and whatever company comes up with a viable treatment to
reverse the process will win big.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3054796-cellular-biomedicine-strong-sell-on-car-t-failure-dishonesty-allegations-and-stock-promotion-minus-94_6-percent-downside


"Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc. CBMG, +0.26% ("CBMG" or the "Company"), a biomedicine firm engaged in the
development of effective treatments for degenerative and cancerous diseases, on April 8 2015 responded to false
statements and allegations made by Pump Stopper on Seeking Alpha April 7. The Company fully respects the right of
any third party to express its opinion but reminds investors that facts are facts.


The posting compiles false and misleading selective information in a manner to maliciously advance, we believe, a
"short agenda" for personal gain to the detriment of the shareholders of the Company.


Here are the facts:


Transparency: The Company welcomes investors and potential strategic partners to attend the Open House at
CBMG's facilities on April 17, 2015 for a half day of management presentations, question and answer sessions, a
facility tour and senior executive briefings. To attend please register with sarah.kelly@cellbiomed... CBMG is fully
committed to the highest standard of corporate governance as well as transparency and fair and timely disclosure in
full compliance with applicable law and SEC regulations.


Auditor Turnover: Like many other early stage companies CBMG engaged with a smaller auditing firm prior to listing
on NASDAQ. Shortly after the Company became a publicly reporting company, it underwent a diligent selection
process and engaged BDO, a top five accounting firm before the up-listing to NASDAQ.


Adverse Effects of Clinical Trials: CBMG employed strict protocols in patient selection for its CAR-T Phase I clinical
trials (targeting CD19, CD20, CD30, and EGFR1). The results of CD20 were published and those of CD19 were
accepted in peer-reviewed scientific journals [view here]. According to comparable trials conducted by the Company's
global peers, the adverse effects detected in these trial participants are on par with similar studies and, the efficacy
(overall response rate), if reviewed carefully, is promising. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to expect a 100% survival rate
during cancer drug clinical trials, especially considering that the admitted participants in the trials are advanced,
relapsed, and refractory candidates.


Code of Ethics and Conduct: CBMG's management abides by a strict code of ethics and conduct as set forth in the
Company's charter. As such, CBMG neither has nor had any investment or business relationship with the named
individual who was indicted as indicated by the report.


Stock Promotion: Investor Relations is a critical and important fiduciary duty of management and is differentiated from
"stock promoting." The Company employs the highest standards of full disclosure as evidenced by regular and
frequent dissemination of news through press releases, conferences and media. In addition, the Company's research
analyst possesses years of covering the stem cell and immune cell therapy sectors. CBMG retained this analyst as a
strategic consultant for two months between October and November 2014 for drug pipeline, operational review, and
technology recommendations. His research coverage is completely independent of this engagement.


"The Company prides itself on corporate governance and public company management and has made meaningful
strides over the last five quarters. We will continue to focus our efforts on building a world-class biotechnology
company focused on providing solutions to large unmet medical needs and improving patient quality of life while
delivering shareholder value," commented Dr. William (Wei) Cao.


The company intends to publish a more detailed response to the false and misleading allegations made by Pump
Stopper on the Company's website."

Patrick so you are not impressed with 5 pages of blather about Life Tech Capital and all of their purported
terrible associations (a company that did consulting work for CBMG for all of 60 days)? What about the
comparison between the IBB and what I presume is the performance of the 5 worst performing stocks that
this Life Tech company every did work for? What would be the comparison to the IBB if P.Stopper chose the 5
best instead of the 5 worst? How about the implication that a change in CFO was a negative? I guess not
worth mentioning that the corporate back ground of CBMGs CFO are executive positions at Alibaba and
Microsoft (yea that's right). As for the CEO's background includes 30 patents in immune-oncology field most
via Stanford and Harvard. No reason to mention that. Intentionally deceptive articles are designed for the non-
discerning reader. 99% of what was contained in the article was either false (let's say 30%) and the rest of it
(lets say 69%) was stuff that really had nothing to do with CBMG at all. The other 1% was already addressed
by the company. Actually very respected biotech analysts (Jay Silverman and John McCamant) at the MTSL
(probably the worlds most successful analysts publishing a biotech newsletter over the last 15 years and
running) recently recommended CBMG with a price target in the 50 range.
