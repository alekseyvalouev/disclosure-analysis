Unilife: Quarterly Results Reveal Mounting Operating Losses,
Continued Dilution, And Ambiguous Growth Plan

Introduction


Following the release of our first and second reports on Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS),
proponents of the long thesis have continued to defend the extreme valuation of the
business. In contrast, our research continues to indicate that shares remain severely
overpriced due to the poor underlying economics of the announced contracts and the
extremely competitive landscape. Yesterday's Unilife earnings call seemed to corroborate
our negative outlook as UNIS reported just $3.6m of revenue and a GAAP loss of -$16.3m
for the quarter-ended December 31st. Management failed to provide new detail on
existing contracts and no new deals were disclosed. Overall, the tone on the call was
muted. The result should be disappointment for investors that have bid up UNIS shares by
40%+ rise since the last earnings call.


Earnings Reveal Continued Operating Losses and an Unclear Growth Plan


Unilife's fiscal second quarter results was a harsh reminder to shareholders that UNIS is
an incredibly overvalued equity at best. Unilife reported precisely zero cost of goods sold
("COGS"), indicating that it failed to sell a single needle for the quarter. The reported
revenue of $3.6m wholly consisted of previously reported milestone payments from Hikma
and Sanofi in addition to other non-recurring revenue. Management was also guarded
about potential new deals, stating that no new material contracts are signed that haven't

already been reported. This may have shocked the many voices who flood $UNIS with
daily Tweets promising "EXPONENTIAL GROWTH" or "2 CONTRACTS PENDING." The
Twitter-chatter suggests that Unilife's recent share price appreciation was entirely driven
by new contract announcements. Without a constant stream of new deals to prop up
Unilife's share price, retail investors could begin abandoning the stock in droves.


Equally as alarming as the persistent lack of product sales is Unilife's accelerating
operating losses. Unilife reported $15.5m in operating expenses and a negative operating
loss of $11.9m. While cash burn was temporarily lessened by $10m in upfront payments
from Hikma and Sanofi, Unilife still managed to burn $2.3m of cash according to last
week's Australian filing. Over the last twelve months, Unilife has incurred more than $60m
of operating expenses. Even if Unilife shifts some of these cash expenses into stock
grants, UNIS is burning roughly $50m cash per year on an ongoing basis. This leads us to
believe that the previously disclosed $20m in milestone payments for calendar year 2014
won't be close to covering Unilife's operating expenses.


Cantor Fitzgerald's analyst, who has been a UNIS bull in the past, also appeared worried
about the ongoing cash burn, "[When] can we start to get approach of break-even point?
Or is the ramp still early enough that may get pushed out to next year?" (FQ2 2014 Call).
Unilife management refused to answer the question directly, saying "we're not focused on
the next quarter or the next quarter of this year of every to midyear or the end of next
year."

Unilife then had the gumption to compare itself to Amazon, "And I think I've said this to
you, Jeff, it's very similar to the Amazon approach of not looking at that short-term." We
wish Unilife luck in becoming the next Amazon and gaining Wall Street's acceptance with
a business model of perpetual losses. But we doubt that current investors had this
strategy in mind when speculating in UNIS shares.


Another glaring problem on the call was Unilife's lack of familiarity with its own financial
statements. Never have we seen a supposedly half-billion dollar business fail to answer
such seemingly basic questions. One analyst asked why Unilife's interest expense
increased from $645k to $4.35m, a very reasonable question since there was no new debt
financing. Unilife's management could only respond, "[CEO] Richard, can I pass that one
to you? [CFO] If you don't mind I do need to look at that and get back to you Keith." A
business with only $3.6m of revenue should understand the origin of an expense that
more than eclipses its entire revenue stream.


Earlier on the call, another analyst asked Unilife to explain how the upfront cash receipts
were treated in the income statement. Again, this concept would be understood in detail
by a skilled management team. In response to the question, Unilife instead managed,


"[CEO:] Obviously, will work on the and we work with Accounts Department and
other relations to deferred revenue. As you know, I've been away the last 4, 5
weeks. I haven't been involved in detail on that. [CFO:] As you might imagine, the
deferred revenue essentially is primarily in 2 areas and that has to do with the nature
of the revenue. So it's either milestone recognized or it is amortized over a period of
time. So that's actually what you're going to see overtime and you're going to see a
pretty big buildup of deferred revenue."


The specifics of the question, which Unilife failed to answer, are critical to Unilife's
hypothetical growth story. Management stated that it expects "sequential quarterly
revenue growth" through fiscal 2014. If this sequential GAAP revenue growth is only due
to the amortized benefit of the Hikma and Sanofi milestone payments, then Unilife isn't
actually growing. Instead, it would only be reporting previously disclosed milestone
payments. Until this issue is clarified, we'd expect the sellside to become more cautious
with their revenue projections and price targets.


The Dilution Continues

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1990921-unilife-quarterly-results-reveal-mounting-operating-losses-continued-dilution-and-ambiguous-growth-plan 4/


Unilife ended December 31st quarter with just $6.7m in cash reserves, covering about one
month of operating expenses. This critically low cash balance demanded an immediate
cash injection. In our most recent article, we argued that Unilife's secondary could be
priced below $3.50, which was a 15 - 20% discount to Unilife's trading price at the time.
While we were wrong on the precise amount, we were broadly correct about the discount.
The secondary occurred on January 16th, with Unilife selling 1.5m additional shares at
$4.25/share. This was well below the $4.75 - $5.00 trading price. The result was that
Unilife managed to raise just $6.2m in proceeds after expenses, leaving it with about
$12.9m in pro-forma cash at the start of the quarter. Even this adjusted cash balance
remains well below Unilife's $10-15m in quarterly cash burn, suggesting that another
highly discounted at-the-money offering could occur at any time.


Unilife attempted to ease these concerns with several hopeful remarks, "It is also my
intention to avoid using the ATM in the foreseeable future" (FQ2 Call), but we remind
investors that UNIS has made similar comments on past calls. Avoiding dilution has been
a focus for each of the past three quarters, "With so many transformational agreements
generating revenue immediately, we have no intention of doing any secondary stock
offering that would cause dilution to existing shareholders" (UNIS May 9th 2013 Call);
"What I want to do is minimize dilution, and that debt funding that the -- financing that's
available to us at any time we wish to partake in it is another lever to which we may pull"
(UNIS Sept 10th 2013 Call); "We have no plans to conduct any significant secondary
offering, either now or in the foreseeable future" (UNIS Nov 11th 2013 Call). After each
and every one of these comments, Unilife has issued stock under the at-the-money
agreement. In the last four quarters, Unilife has received proceeds of $13.4m, $10.6m,
$12.9m, and $6.2m from the issuance of dilutive secondary shares. Beware when
management teams say one thing and then perform the complete opposite.


Unilife also referred to a potential debt financing arrangement with "a large healthcare
investor." Given Unilife's high cost of equity and its ongoing cash deficits, the lack of a
secured bank financing arrangement has always been a major red flag. When asked
about the healthcare investor, UNIS admitted that "We had the option of putting a debt
financing in place since I announced pretty much I think around May of last year" (FQ2
2013 Call). In other words, rumors of a new debt facility are inaccurate in our opinion; this
deal is likely identical deal to the one mentioned in May 2013. Furthermore, we'd guess
that a private market investor would demand an equity-linked option, such as warrants or
a convertible. Private investors have a higher cost of capital than a bank. Until Unilife
reports a detailed term sheet for this potential debt financing, investors should remain
prepared for further dilution.

Conclusion


We continue to believe that Unilife's fundamentals cannot come close to justifying its
$440m market capitalization. Past deal announcements have been full of triumphant
rhetoric, each time boasting about transformative multi-billion dollar opportunities. But
Unilife's ability to translate these contracts into substantial product revenue remains as
elusive as ever. Once investors come to realize that Unilife's contingent partnerships do
not guarantee meaningful product sales, the market should begin to focus on the
fundamentals of the business. And based on yesterday's report and conference call, it's
unclear that Unilife will ever produce a profit, much less deliver an acceptable return to
investors.

Good observations. How can the CEO not know how interest expense rose from $645k to $4.35m? That's a
significant amount of money for this company which is scraping for cash.

The fact that UNIS could not answer the interest question baffles me. I have never seen a company not be
able to answer a question like that on a call. Companies get much tougher questions than that all the time
and handle them without a problem. Alan has never been a fan of questions that he must give a direct answer
to and this was just another example of that.

It's an accounting adjustment related to the end of an equipment lease, as they have subsequently answered.
Nothing to do with cash position. And not significant.

And, I might add, that is a very different situation to the presumptions and innuendo of the article writer.
Perhaps his declared short position has colored his writing.


Hikma's deal is likely to justify the current price in the first year of ramp up. With so many other deals signed
and in the pipeline, you'd have to be worried if you were short; so best for them to jawbone the price down as
quick as possible before a couple more announcements put them in real trouble. Could be anytime.

Author’s reply »  We discussed the interest expense to demonstrate the aptitude of the management team,
not to dwell on a $4.3m expense item. To believe in UNIS, you need complete faith in management's ability to
execute on the current contracts.


The only income stipulated under the signed Hikma and Sanofi contracts is $20m in 2014 and $30m in 2015,
if milestones are met. Unilife's run-rate cash burn will be twice this amount, inferring continued dilution unless
production revenue ramps from zero to tens of millions of units. We think Unilife's 15-year track record
warrants extreme skepticism when it comes to execution.


If your bull case is solely contingent on price reactions to new deal announcements rather than the underlying
economic fundamentals, then we have a difference in investment philosophy.


05 Feb 2014, 10:33 AM

And the management team answered the question and demonstrated that what you were strongly claiming as
a cashflow issue was not an issue at all. If you think (incorrectly) it is an issue and management cannot
answer, maybe you have a point. If you are incorrect, as you were, and management have correctly
addressed an immaterial lease accounting point (with the CFO not present at the Conference call) you have
only shown your own lack of competence and, more importantly, presumption and lack of objectivity.


If you consider that Hikma's contract for ramp up to a minimum of 175m units and $40m in milestone
payments is somehow at all similar to previous deals, then you do have a different investment philosophy to
mine - one rooted in the past and underpinned by your current short position. $5m paid and a further $35m in
milestone payments will be due under that contract through 2014/5.


Add $3m revenues from EZMix for customisation under that signed contract, over a 12-24mnth period, plus
any product delivery revenues . Add Sanofi's signed 15 year contract, with $5m already received and $10m
further contracted in milestone payments. Add revenues under the signed Occu-Jet contract, commencing
from January. Then debt finance for product delivery ramp-up under the Sanofi and Hikma contracts.


Prepare to be burned.

Author’s reply »  Those product sales aren't guaranteed. Instead, they are typically the minimum volume
required to maintain exclusivity, "Following a four year ramp-up period after market entry, exclusivity will be
maintained, subject to Sanofi purchasing a minimum of 150 million units of the Unifill Finesse or other Unifill
syringes per year."


As for Hikma, the minimum volume figure of 175m is not mentioned in Hikma' s press release.

And even if Unilife executes all its contracts flawlessly, we don't believe one can construct a reasonable DCF
that justifies the current valuation.

I find it intriguing that all of the Pro-Unilifers, who were so adamant that this stock was a great buy, who berated and
belittled others for their negativity of the stock, have now vanished. I once was an investor of Unis and I am glad that I
sold a long time ago. I believe nothing that comes from Shortfall's mouth, as his words appear to replicate a covert
Ponzi Scheme. I said it before and I will say it again, the numbers simply do not add up, the information on these
deals are ambiguous, and Shortfall as a person, I do not trust. As I stated recently, you can have all the multi-million
dollar deals in the world. What good is it if the company is not producing positive net revenue?

these are the hottest medical devices on the market- di u not see earnings report,  
all great news


November 2013, Unilife signed a long-term commercial supply contract with Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC ("Hikma")
for the use of Unifill(R) prefilled syringes with an initial list of 20 generic injectable drugs. Product sales to Hikma will
commence in early calendar 2014, with a minimum 175MM units per year to be purchased following a high-volume
ramp program. In addition to product sales, Unilife expects to receive $40 million in upfront and milestone payments
over the next two years. Unilife received the first payment of $5 million from Hikma during the second quarter of fiscal
year 2014. Additional milestone payments have also been received during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014.


-- In November 2013, Unilife signed an agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics arm of AstraZeneca, to
customize and supply devices from its platform of wearable injectors for use with several target drug candidates from

MedImmune's portfolio. Unilife is receiving regular payments from MedImmune under the contract.


-- In December 2013, Unilife signed a contract with a global pharmaceutical company seeking to use Unilife's Ocu-
ject(TM) delivery system to deliver a target injectable therapy into the eye. Revenue under the program is scheduled
to commence during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014.


-- In December 2013, Unilife signed an agreement with Novartis to supply clinical products from one of its platforms of
injectable drug delivery systems for use with a targeted early stage pipeline drug. Unilife began to generate revenue
under the Novartis under the program during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Additional payments are
expected as the program continues this calendar year.


-- Unilife also continues to receive milestone payments and revenue from other customer programs. This includes $5
million in payments from Sanofi during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, with an additional $5 million being received
during the current third quarter of fiscal year 2014. In total, Unilife has invoiced for more than $20 million since the
start of fiscal year 2014, with the majority of that cash having been received since November 2013.


Mr. Alan Shortall, CEO of Unilife, commented: "This has been a strong quarter for Unilife, in which momentum
continues to build. Many significant new long-term contracts have been signed with leading pharmaceutical
companies including Novartis, MedImmune and Hikma. Milestone payments and revenue are increasing as a result of
our execution of these and other customer programs. I expect this pace to continue as additional contracts
progressively emerge from our large, expanding commercial pipeline."

Yes, I did in fact see the earning report. Hence the reason the stock has dropped dramatically. Or maybe you were
reading Shortfall's personal, handwritten report that he prefers his investors to read in lieu?

Great article, as I really like the fact that the author called out Shortall. He seems more like a PR machine than
anything else. You never want to risk when you have a CEO who 1) Can't fully answer questions on a CC. He seems
almost like an amateur when asked to answer anything worth knowing. 2) I truly believe AS is all about himself, and
trying to take advantage of people who actually believe the hype that comes out of his mouth. He does NOT follow
through, has "new deals" that are re-releases of former ones. There is NEVER any clarification toward any of the
deals which come out. I really can't believe that at this point in the game anyone would actually listen to anything he
says. Longs may not like to read this but the only fact about UNIS is that you NEVER know what to expect.

This article was an exercise in hyperbole: Paragraph 2 & 3: “extreme valuation…severely overpriced… poor
underlying economics…extremely competitive landscape…Management failed…harsh reminder… incredibly
overvalued … precisely zero … failed to sell a single needle.”


“The reported revenue of $3.6m wholly consisted of previously reported milestone payments from Hikma and Sanofi
in addition to other non-recurring revenue.” So it’s held against them if they report early and don’t withhold information
until the QR?


“Management was also guarded about potential new deals, stating that no new material contracts are signed that
haven't already been reported.” I doubt this shocked anyone who has followed UNIS for any length of time. This is
SOP for them. You either accept it as a legitimate approach (and accept the risk) or you don’t.


“Equally as alarming as the persistent lack of product sales is Unilife's accelerating operating losses.” Alarming? You
need to temper your expectations. Accelerating operating losses correlate with ramp up growing pains. No surprise
there either.


“Cantor Fitzgerald's analyst…appeared worried about the ongoing cash burn.” Worried? Seems like a straightforward
question to me. Granted Shortall’s response was weak.


WRT dilution, yes it continues. I can’t argue with you there, but again, am I surprised? No. This too will pass. I am still
long UNIS.

Question for the author. The short case seems to be based on the premise that the valuation grossly exceeds this
company potential. Hyping by the CEO and fellow travelers has fooled the retail investors into supporting the stock.


How do you reconcile it with the number of institutional purchases that have occurred over the last year and especially
over the last 3 months? For example, JP Morgan Chase has increased their position between February 2013 to
January 2014 from about 7,346,351 to 8,482,037 shares. Check their recent 5% holder filings. Other institutional
purchases are abound. Not all have filed for last quarter of 2013, but those that did have a lot more purchases then
sales. Are they also being fooled by the CEO and exited by all caps twitter messages? How do you reconcile
institutional behavior with your theories?

Quite right, 6651781. When discussing hyperbole, one need only look to those holding short positions who excel at
promoting their own negative cause at the expense of the truth.


When looking for a more accurate picture of Unilife's emerging position as a global leader in the injectable drug
delivery market, investors should consider the actions of true market professionals - the funds you list - whose due

diligence is far more objective and thorough than that of a hedge fund whose position is already seriously underwater,
and whose commentary is thus fatally flawed by subjective negative bias as they seek to ameliorate their loss.


At the end of the day investors must ask one question: Who to trust?


The biased and fatally flawed commentary of market participants desperately trying to exit a losing trade?


Or Global Investment Fund Managers who have taken large positions after extensive due diligence in expectation of
profiting from the future growth of Unilife?


One could perhaps forgive one or two fund managers for supposedly getting it wrong, as the shorts would have you
believe, but the fact is that some 41% of Unilife's float is held by US Investment funds, including many of the biggest
and best in the business. It beggars belief that they are all wrong, and a handful of desperate shorts are right.


In this respect I would also point out that JP Morgan Chase are Unilife's second largest shareholder through their
Small Cap Growth Funds.


Naturally, this is an inconvenient truth the shorts don't like to dwell upon.

Author’s reply »  We have not changed our thesis on Unilife. According to the 8-K filed today
(http://1.usa.gov/1fTQSGc), UNIS received net proceeds of just $31.4m from the deal, well below the $60m
headline figure. In addition to the $40m of principal withdrawn upfront, $10m will be funded on December
15th, 2014 and $10m on June 15, 2015.


The loan pays interest expense of Libor + 9.25% plus a 2.75% royalty on Unilife's first $50m of sales, 1% on
$50m - $100m of sales, and $0.25% thereafter. Using the $40m of principal outstanding today, and assuming
that Unilife somehow manages to generate $50m of revenue in 2014, the loan will cost UNIS roughly
~$6m/year of annual expense just to borrow that initial $31.4m.


This egregiously expensive financing, implying that UNIS was unable to access a traditional bank loan,
supports our thesis that Unilife will never create sustainable value for its shareholders.
