Cloudweb:	A	$23	Million	Shell	Stock	Inflated	By	A	Misleading	Stock
Promotion

Summary


Zero	assets,	zero	revenue,	and	no	meaningful	business	operations	yet	boasts	a	lofty
$23	million	valuation.


OTCMarkets.com	just	added	the	dreaded	"Caveat	Emptor"	designation,	noting	a
public	interest	concern	with	the	company.


Company's	executive	office	disclosed	in	corporate	filings	is	actually	a	Mail	Boxes
Etc.,	and	there	are	no	employees	according	to	the	most	recent	10-K.


Primary	catalyst	for	the	recent	stock	price	movement	appears	to	be	a	penny	stock
promotion	campaign.


To	date,	the	Fraud	Research	Institute	has	published	13	research	reports	on	heavily
promoted	penny	stocks	that	we	believed	would	drop	sharply	in	share	price	in	the	short-
term.	Our	premise	is	simple:	short-term	fluctuations	on	the	stocks	we	report	on	are
generally	attributed	to	stock	promotion	campaigns,	and	once	those	campaigns	end,	stock
prices	experience	sharp	declines.


Typically,	these	penny	stock	companies	have	at	least	a	business	idea	or	some	operations
that	would	give	it	a	slim	chance	to	succeed.	However,	our	most	recent	research	report	on
Luminar	Media	(OTCPK:	LRGR)	published	in	April	2018	highlighted	a	self-disclosed	shell
company	with	little-to-no	actual	business	operations	that,	in	our	opinion,	had	its	share
price	inflated	solely	because	of	a	penny	stock	promotional	campaign.


Since	the	publication	of	our	Luminar	Media	research	report	as	being	a	"Shell	Risk"	stock
subjected	to	a	penny	stock	promotion	campaign,	the	stock	fell	by	over	98%	in	less	than	6
months.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4206244-cloudweb-23-million-shell-stock-inflated-misleading-stock-promotion 2/11


We	believe	that	a	very	similar	opportunity	exists	with	another	Shell	Company	called
Cloudweb,	Inc.	(OTCPK:CLOW).	With	no	assets,	revenue	or	company	operations,	it	is	our
opinion	that	the	stock	is	currently	worthless	and	will	go	to	zero	unless	a	material	change
occurs.


While	the	primary	concerns	published	in	this	report	have	been	brought	to	the	issuer's
attention,	to	date	we	have	received	no	response.


Company	History


Cloudweb,	Inc.	was	originally	incorporated	on	May	25,	2014	under	the	name	"Formigli,
Inc."	with	the	intent	to	sell	custom	road	bikes	hand-crafted	by	Renzo	Formigli.


About	18	months	later,	the	Company's	President	at	the	time	(Amy	Chaffe)	restructured	the
company	and	renamed	it	to	"Cloudweb,	Inc."	and	on	January	28,	2016,	the	company
entered	into	a	Share	Exchange	Agreement	with	Liao	Zhi	De	to	acquire	Data	Cloud,	Inc.


Through	its	acquisition	of	Data	Cloud,	Inc.,	the	company	previously	owned	Web	Hosting
Solutions	Ltd.,	a	UK-based	web	hosting	solutions	provider	managed	by	an	individual
named	James	Holland	that	never	amounted	to	a	lucrative	business.


On	April	1,	2017,	the	company	transferred	Data	Cloud,	Inc.	and	its	Web	Hosting	Solutions,
Ltd.	subsidiary	to	a	third	party	for	nominal	consideration.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4206244-cloudweb-23-million-shell-stock-inflated-misleading-stock-promotion 3/11


Since	that	time,	it	does	not	appear	that	Cloudweb	has	conducted	any	meaningful	business
operations.


Current	Business


Despite	boasting	a	lofty	$20	million	market	cap,	Cloudweb	reported	zero	assets	and	zero
revenue	in	its	most	recent	10-Q	filed	on	August	6,	2018:


The	Company	also	has	no	prospects	for	generating	future	revenue	since	there	are
currently	no	meaningful	business	operations	and	no	employees.


(Source:	Page	5	of	Cloudweb's	10-K	for	the	period	ending	12/31/2017)


All	prior	business	conducted	in	the	web	hosting	industry	has	been	ceased	since	it
transferred	Data	Cloud	Inc.	to	a	third	party	for	nominal	consideration	back	on	April	1,
2017:

OTCMarkets.com	currently	lists	Cloudweb,	Inc.	as	Caveat	Emptor,	undergoing	stock

The	Company's	domain	name	listed	on	OTCMarkets.com	(dataoncloud.co.uk)	is
available	for	sale	and	the	Company	does	not	appear	to	have	a	corporate	website
The	telephone	number	listed	in	the	most	recent	10-Q	(+44	20	8050	2379)	goes	right	to
voicemail
The	address	of	principal	executive	offices	listed	in	the	most	recent	10-Q	(12A	Greenhill
Street,	Stratford	Upon	Avon,	UK)	appears	to	be	a	Mail	Boxes	Etc.
The	only	UK	presence	was	previously	for	Data	Cloud	Inc.,	which	is	no	longer	owned
by	Cloudweb.	In	fact,	Cloudweb's	only	two	company	officers	both	appear	to	be
Chinese	residents:


(Author's	Note:	The	image	above	was	created	by	the	Author	to	display	both	reporting
owners	in	one	convenient	place.	Original	details	were	taken	from	Form	4	(for	Zhi	De
Liao)	and	Form	3	(for	Chen	Shi	Rong))


Besides	an	8-K	dated	March	29,	2018	regarding	the	appointment	of	Chen	Shi	Rong	as
Chief	Operating	Officer	and	Director,	it	appears	that	most	corporate	decisions	have
involved	capital	structure	changes	and	share	issuances:

(Source:	Page	F-9	of	Cloudweb's	10-Q	for	the	period	ending	6/30/2018)


It	is	worth	noting	that	Cloudweb's	convertible	notes	payable	with	accrued	interest	was
approximately	$109,761	as	of	June	30,	2018.	At	a	conversion	price	of	$0.005	per	share,
this	debt	can	be	converted	into	a	total	of	21,952,200	additional	shares	of	common	stock
by	undisclosed	third	parties	at	any	time.


Current	Stock	Promotion


It	is	our	opinion	that	the	sole	reason	why	this	apparent	shell	company	with	no	assets
boasts	a	$23	million	market	cap	is	because	of	a	current	penny	stock	promotion	campaign
spearheaded	by	unscrupulous	third	party	email	newsletters	such	as
TrustedPennyStockAlerts.com.


To	date,	we	have	been	forwarded	11	promotional	emails	from	a	colleague	featuring
Cloudweb	that	encourages	readers	to	buy	CLOW	stock.	These	emails	falsely	position
CLOW	as	a	"tech	company	with	the	most	potential	I've	seen	this	year"	although	there	are
no	actual	business	operations	at	Cloudweb:

The	stock	was	relatively	dormant	prior	to	early	August	and	since	that	is	when	the
promotional	materials	began	flooding	email	inboxes,	it	appears	as	though	the	primary
catalyst	for	the	CLOW	stock	price	movement	during	the	past	several	weeks	is	this	third
party	promotional	newsletter.	As	we	have	outlined	in	all	past	research	reports,	whenever
the	underlying	business	is	weak	(in	this	case	an	outright	shell	company)	the	share	price
will	collapse	after	the	promotional	campaign	ends.

Conclusion


Cloudweb,	Inc.	has	no	assets,	no	revenues,	and	no	apparent	operating	business.	The	last
time	the	Company	issued	a	press	release	was	back	in	2016	and,	besides	an	8-K	issued	in
March	2018	announcing	a	new	Director,	it	does	not	appear	that	Cloudweb	has	conducted
much	business	besides	capital	structure	changes	and	share	issuances.


Simply	put,	this	appears	to	be	a	shell	company,	and	in	our	opinion,	CLOW	shares	are
virtually	worthless.	Similar	to	our	past	research	reports,	we	believe	the	only	reason	why
the	Company	is	trading	at	a	lofty	$20	million	valuation	is	due	to	the	ongoing	penny	stock
promotion	campaign.


We	expect	shares	to	plummet	by	90-99%	once	the	current	promotional	campaign	ends
and	shareholders	realize	that	the	intrinsic	value	of	shares	is	zero.


Disclosure:	I/we	have	no	positions	in	any	stocks	mentioned,	but	may	initiate	a	short	position	in	CLOW	over	the	next	72
hours.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than
from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.


Editor's	Note:	This	article	covers	one	or	more	microcap	stocks.	Please	be	aware	of	the
risks	associated	with	these	stocks.

I	love	this.	But	I	love	good	schadenfreude.	
Sadly,	no	options	seem	to	be	traded	so	you	have	to	have	big	balls	and	naked	short...	thus	I	will	only	watch.
Many	of	your	other	picks	for	this	category	have	cratered	right	on	schedule.	Keep	up	the	good	work!
