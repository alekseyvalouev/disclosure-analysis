Odyssey's SEC 10Q: Out Of Cash In Weeks, Neptune Minerals
Declines -94%

Summary


OMEX’s legal 10Q filed with the SEC paints a dramatically different and darker
picture than the vague, hype-filled PR and conference call which is caveated by a
safe harbor disclaimer.


Out of cash in weeks - Legal 10Q: “Our consolidated cash balance at June 30, 2014
was $5.7 million which is sufficient to support approximately two months of
operations”.


Or Get ready for dilution - Legal 10Q: “We may enter into convertible debt deals... At
times, conversion prices could be lower than market price of our common stock”.


Look out Mako & Oceanica - OMEX re-traded and crammed down junior securities
at Neptune Minerals, officially valuing it at $1/share, a decline of 94% from $17.50
last reported.


$10mm marketing agreement “Binding LOI” (an oxymoron) hyped on the conference
call has NOT closed and seems dubious as OMEX does not have title to SSCA
coins.


After Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s Q1 disastrous conference call due
to critical questions piqued by our assessment of the Q1 10-Q (Odyssey Marine: Shrinking
Cash Position Fails To Cover Current Bills, CEO Greg Stemm Must Go), OMEX
management was clever enough this time to release the 10-Q immediately before the
conference call so that nobody would have time to read it and form critical questions. Most
investors don't understand the difference between the 10-Q, which is a legal document
filed with the SEC and the press releases and conference calls. The difference is that lying
in a 10-Q with the SEC can mean serious legal sanctions whereas false statements in a
press release or conference call are protected by a "safe habor" disclaimer: that
boilerplate that few investors read allows companies to basically say anything they want
under the caveat emptor of "forward looking statement." The OMEX Q2 10-Q legal

document and conference call / PR is one of the most divergent we have ever seen. As a
father may tell his daughter interested in dating a boy: pay attention to what he DOES
(SEC Legal filings) not what he SAYS (PR/Conf calls)…


We have made dozens of well researched statements about OMEX, all backed by hard
facts and have included the referenced, public documents linked in those statements. We
have no need here to refute blanket dismissals of those claims with no supporting
evidence made by OMEX management. There are enough new facts to focus on that are
important to shareholders that OMEX management omitted from their vague, hype filled
conference call.


CEO Transition a Step in the Right Direction but Too Little Too Late


First, to give some credit to the OMEX board of directors, we applaud the decision to
remove Greg Stemm as CEO. We advocated this last quarter and are impressed with the
decisive action. Unfortunately as Warren Buffett says, "When a manager with a reputation
for brilliance takes the helm at a business with a terrible reputation, it is usually the latter
that remains intact." The unending losses and unviability of the treasure hunting business
do not provide incoming CEO Mark Gordon an easy task. In addition, former OMEX
employees have recounted to us how Greg Stemm has described COO Mark Gordon as
his "Sock Puppet" does not leave us with a feeling of confidence that Gordon will be able
to hold the house of cards in order for very long after the Founder Stemm has left the
sinking ship.

SEC 10-Q: OMEX language appears to be a CYA for Bankruptcy Filing to be Made
Shortly or Dilutive Equity Raise


If cash inflow is not sufficient to meet our desired projected business plan requirements,
we will be required to follow our contingency business plan which is based on curtailed
expenses and requires less cash inflows. We may also have to revert to capital raises that
include equity and/or convertible debt to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our
consolidated cash balance at June 30, 2014 was $5.7 million which is sufficient to
support approximately two months of operations.... While we have been successful in
generating cash inflows and raising the necessary funds in the past, there can be no
assurance that we can continue to do so in 2014 or the following twelve months. …


We may enter into convertible debt deals whereas our shares may be acquired from time
to time upon conversion of the outstanding debt. At times, conversion prices could be
lower than market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. We previously had
outstanding senior convertible debt that was converted at a discount to market

New sources of Cash mentioned in PR / Conf Call Highly Suspicious and not

Longs will no doubt highlight that this was as of June 30, 2014 and since then they have
claimed to draw additional cash from the Fifth Third $10mm credit line and also have a
new $10mm "marketing agreement "Binding LOI". These two sources of cash are only
mentioned in the press release, protected by a 'forward looking statement' safe harbor and
are NOT mentioned in the 10-Q. Unlike in Q1 where the $10mm Fifth Third credit line was
announced and properly documented, these sources of cash appear far more tenuous
and dubious.


Firstly: We accurately predicted that $7.5mm would be the max allowable draw on
the $10mm Fifth Third Credit line back on July 17th (SSCA Inventory Unsealed:
Confirms Disappointing Salvage, Meson's Estimates). Our July 16 bankruptcy prediction
was always caveated on them being unable further draw on this line, they have bought
themselves a few more weeks from now it appears. 10-Q: "At June 30, 2014, the
outstanding loan balance on this credit facility was $7,436,514"


Secondly: We find it highly suspicious that the CFO would announce that they have
made an additional draw on the Fifth Third $10mm credit line given that A) the
Odyssey Explorer is still at sea (returning today) and the collateral needs to be on shore to
allow a further cash draw and B) He was evasive and would not answer questions about
the amount of the credit line draw. Regardless, this amount is likely to be small - perhaps
max $1mm and we will know in the next few days based on the inventory sheets from the
court.


Thirdly: A $10mm loan "Binding LOI" is referenced on the PR but not in the 10-Q. If
it were a material event, it would legally be required to be filed with the SEC. So either: A)
it is NOT material because the only thing "binding" about the LOI is confidentiality or some
other noneconomic issue and there is still substantial uncertainty that the deal will close
(CFO said it would close "in the coming days or weeks" - highly vague) or B) OMEX is
failing to satisfy its SEC filing obligations. A seems more likely. Further, why would any
coin dealer be willing or able to loan money to OMEX, at the brink of insolvency, while it
doesn't even possess title of the coins and those coins already have a secured loan
against them? This is highly suspicious and we believe this loan is unlikely to materialize.


Finally: What exactly does the CFO think "non-dilutive" means? This statement has
been used repeatedly in press releases and conference calls and our version of "non-
dilutive" is "that sharecount will not increase without a commensurate increase in value."
However, we are befuddled what definition is being used at OMEX as the sharecount
JUST in 2014 OMEX has " issued 1,290,155 shares of common stock" (Q2 10Q)

What Ever Happened to the Neptune Minerals Phosphate Project? It just officially
got valued again, down -94% from the last time OMEX updated shareholders!


OMEX has been working on undersea phosphate mining for years now, Oceanica is just
the most recent incarnation of this pipedream that has not been done anywhere
commercially in the world, ever. Neptune Minerals, run by OMEX co-founder and former
CEO, John Morris, was last valued at $17.50/share by management, indicating a
whopping $100m+ valuation for OMEX's stake.


source: OMEX Investor Presentation Oct 2013


We have previously highlighted the unusual structure of the Oceanica capital raise (Do
Mako Investors Realize Their Tenuous Security Position In Oceanica?) that leaves
investors in a very weak security position. With OMEX holding a senior security (the
$10mm receivable for services) and Oceanica insolvent by design, OMEX could in theory
cram down and wipe out the minority shareholders at MAKO or any new investors at their
whim. While some have pointed out they would have no incentive to do this - THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT JUST HAPPENED AT NEPTUNE THIS LAST QUARTER!

SEC Q2 10-Q: "during the three-months ended September 30, 2013, we, along with a
second creditor, loaned funds to NMI of which our share is $500,000...


The note was convertible into NMI's Class A voting shares at $12.00 per share upon
maturity. 26 During April 2014, we modified the conversion feature with NMI whereas,
during April 2014, the note was converted into 5,225 shares of Class A Preferred non-
voting stock. These shares are convertible into 522,500 shares of Class A voting shares
and require no further exchange of consideration for conversion. As a result of the
conversion of the loan into equity, we recognized $522,500 of additional investment in NMI
and appropriately wrote it down to the loss in unconsolidated entity."


Note that including accrued interest this works out to a valuation of Neptune Minerals
shares of about $1.00/share vs $17.50/share previously highlighted by management - a
decline of 94% in value! OMEX's 6.7mm shares would be worth a mere $6.7mm at best
even assuming no liquidity discount. More likely these shares are worthless as we believe
Neptune has ceased material operations.


Conclusion


We agree with one thing OMEX said on the conference call - investors should focus on
facts and not false statements made for personal gain. We have consistently included our
evidence here and have followed up in the comments section to legitimate questions.
Meanwhile, the CEO is now jumping ship and the incoming CEO asks shareholders to
have an "open mind" about what they are capable of while citing project economic
numbers for Gairsoppa with NO EVIDENCE to support it. The FACT is that the company
still lost $10mm/year for the two years while completing by far the most successful project
in its history. If it's true that the Gairsoppa created $67mm cash inflows and only cost
$27mm (implying a project profit of $40mm) - where did the other $60mm of expenses go
during 2012-2013? $60mm is a huge number! If a project is profitable them OMEX should
appropriately account for this in its legal SEC filings but it doesn't because they know this
is without support.


OMEX does some interesting projects but should not exist as a for-profit enterprise, it
exists as a vehicle to enrich insiders who make millions while making vague promises to
shareholders who need to place more "belief" on the legal SEC documents than
management statements protected by safe habor disclaimers. The wrap-up phase for
OMEX's nearly 20 year history of destroying over $190mm of shareholder value appears

Sins of omission. Following the statement, (directly below the sock picture) ... "support approximately two months of
operations...." the author omitted this:


"We have been the target of repeated attacks by third parties seeking to drive down our stock price. These attacks are
primarily organized by certain short sellers seeking to distort the truth and thereby profit from the decline of a

I submit that this entire article is more of what is mentioned in the omitted quote by an author whose stated position is
short and thus whose motive is to drive the price downward. His last two predictions of financial meltdown "July 16"
and "early August" have not come to pass. His current pronouncement that the company is "on the brink of
insolvency" will prove equally preposterous.

Key word you always forget to mention ---- FUTURE ASSETS 
While you leave out this important factor and hype the cash on hand, Fifth Third Bank and others loan money to
OMEX on FUTURE ASSETS (recovered via the courts and not monetized as yet) and very valuable mining
concessions that are in "the stage of development", plus future commodity wrecks that are on their books and likely
other projects we are unaware of. OMEX has plenty of assets


Isn't it prudent to borrow the least amount required with any project, so that the rewards/recoveries show a good
profit? Why pad the balance sheet with loans when you can wait for monetization of your assets.


Some banks, funds, investors and even the Mexican government DISAGREE with your convoluted theory of a
insolvent OMEX ----- because they continue to fund and endorse OMEX, who has BILLIONS of dollars in potential
future assets! I guess everyone is wrong but you --- NOT!

Ryan Morris responding to your comment , I note that your bio indicates that you are a CFA, which I would
expect means you should uphold their standards of conduct in the level of diligence and integrity of your work.
As such, I was less than comforted when I learned that the one source you did actually name in the article
happens to be a reputed local con man who has served time for fraud (real estate I believe). I presume that
he is the same person you previously referred to here on SA, that sent you the (false) information you
reported regarding Oceanica not paying its employees? Were you duped by this con man or is he now on the
payroll of Meson Capital? 
You also site the Mexican regulation under which you claim Oceanica did not comply with SEMARNAT
regulations. Clearly if you read and understood your own citation of Article 28, it ONLY applies to "Federally
restricted minerals". If you, like I did, verified the list of these "Federally restricted materials", it refers only to
materials such as uranium, while phosphate is a material listed in another section of the law with very different
requirements. Were you just careless, or did a convenient wrong answer better serve your motivation? This
fact was very easy to establish with any reasonable diligence on your part. Thus, how can you, as a CFA,
purport to have "searched" for something when you were not even looking in the right place. Still in my
experience, a serious CFA will actually ask a company about a serious claim involving illegal activities before
making a blanket statement across the Internet as to their guilt. You are certainly allowed to come to your own
analytical conclusions (by now most posters on SA discuss them for what they are) and we do understand the
pressure you are under as a business owner trying to support the decaying status of Meson Capital's portfolio
performance (based on material you shared with another business outlet), you now need to have an OMEX
failure to allow you to unwind a short position whose paper profits of Q2 are about to be obliterated by Q4...
but you are not entitled to your own facts and defend them with a lack of proper due diligence or by merely
repeating falsehoods from dubious sources for whom you do not offer the proper disclosure about their shady
character or editorial bias. These are not the standards of a CFA nor do I suspect standards that this board
expects of its authors.

More misinformation. 
From the 10Q: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.7 million at June 30, 2014, as compared to $5.8 million at March
31, 2014. Operating cash flows for the second quarter of 2014 improved by 39% as compared to the same period in
2013.


From Meson's 10Q: “Our consolidated cash balance at June 30, 2014 was $5.7 million which is sufficient to support
approximately two months of operations”.

<<Firstly: We accurately predicted that $7.5mm would be the max allowable draw on the $10mm Fifth Third Credit
line back on July 17th ">>


"Firstly" that is a nonsensical. The fact that they drew 7.5 million does not prove or even imply that was the full
amount available. It is a 10 million dollar credit facility. Has it occurred to you that it was fully collateralized to 10
million at inception by the bank's conservative estimate of the initial haul?...as opposed to your estimate which is
absolutely irrelevant to the transaction


Meson also typed 
<<What Ever Happened to the Neptune Minerals Phosphate Project?>>


It never existed. I think you have them mixed up with Chatham.


14 Aug 2014, 02:09 PM


teklord
Regarding Chatham, this is from an update from CRP today:


The relationship with our technical partner Boskalis continues to be a fantastic asset for CRP. Its 100-plus
years of experience in the marine dredging industry and its wealth of expertise in a wide range of areas
including engineering and hydronamics are invaluable. Boskalis works in 75 countries around the world and
environmental and existing user concerns are always the primary focus. The company has countless
examples of how it has designed a way of doing something to anticipate a potential concern – it is simply the
way it does business.


Boskalis is the company working with Odyssey in Mexico. Odyssey is an owner of stock in CRP. They could
not have a better partner in these ventures.

Have all you bulls on this board read the "Trends and Uncertainties" portion of the 10-Q? Its actually a little grim. And
Meson is definitely right about the complete disconnect between the way the call (safe harbor protected) and the
filing.


On the flip side, I am not exactly sure what mgmt's purpose would be in drawing this out/or lying. Collect a few more
paychecks? Scramble to get more funding? Maybe they are waiting until Labor Day to throw the kitchen sink out on
that Friday afternoon.


Meson, has definitely been aggressive (and wrong so far) in his bankruptcy call. Along with his assertion that no gold
would be found at the site.


Mgmt however seems incredibly sketchy in the cherry-picking they are doing of data and the discrepancy btw the CC
and the filing.


Just my thoughts.

I read the Q well before I listened to the call. Yes there is a stark contrast.


The Q is what has happened with a warning of what might happen if their plans do not bear fruit in as timely a
fashion as they anticipate. For instance I am sure they have spent time preparing fallback funding....if called
for.


The CC is the front burner of their efforts and what they expect to happen.


I agree to go either long or short this stock right now requires trust in one party or another...

I think time is on Omex side, your right the company is not all that sure footed, but gold coins and silver coins they

I suppose we have to keep the shorts honest. The latest inventory that came out today was pretty good, albiet, no
army gold yet, but there is still the last half of the ship to recover, which should be much easier and quicker now that
all the coal and debris is removed.


I did a very conservative quick value estimate for the latest inventory this morning and rough numbers I come up with
$7M -$10M on the low side. I'm going to do a line by line of all of the coins and artifacts tonight, and will provide
everyone with a more accurate value estimate tomorrow.


If the new inventory comes in at $10M, MY value estimate numbers including the previous inventories put the total
recovery so far approaching $50M dollars, with the all important bow section of the ship, still to be recovered.


There were a few numismatic highlights to this latest recovery. Of note, they recovered another (15) ultra rare 1857-S
3 dollar gold pieces. There were some things in this recovery that had not appeared before, which are also extremely
rare.......items such as $5 Wass Molitor private mint gold coins which are rarer and more valuable than the W&M $10
gold coins in the previous recoveries. There were also more Charolotte and Dahlonega gold pieces.....again highly
rare and valuable to collectors at auction. These are all wild cards on value. I valued them ridiculously low, but if I was
still a coin dealer, assuming the 1857-S three dollars gold pieces are higher grade UNC's, I would expect to get
anywhere between $150K and $500K EACH for them, maybe higher for any that grade at MS64 or above.


Of other important note, the Binding LOI which in this article was desbribed as highly unlikely and suspicious, has in
fact been consumated and OMEX has borrowed the $5M dollars and added it to their cash balance sheet, with 2
more tranches of 2.5M each as milestones are met, which may already be partially met with todays inventory.


So, our OMEX management team is executing on some of the topics they discussed at the CC just last week. I view
these developments as very good and encouraging. Certainly with the stock at about $1.18, it seems like a bargain for
a company that is bringing up gold every day, a project that has obviously become and will be profitable, and a
company that is not going bankrupt and is in fact becoming more financially healthy every day.


I think I'll buy some more.


Check tomorrow for my better valuation on the current inventory sheet.

Author’s reply »  How much upside do you think they sold with this loan deal announced today? They said they gave
away shares in a "subsidiary" (That is presumably the SSCA sub they set up for the project) as part of closing fees.

Meson/Rick Morris,


Well, I wish I was privy to the specifics and particulars of that deal, but I'm not........without knowing the structure,
special terms if any, what they set aside in the subsidiary, etc, I just don't know. They might have sold upside, or
maybe not. We just can't know at this point.

I can't really guess based on the republic deals because the CA coins are much more marketable and desireable. I
know for a fact the CA coins marketing and saleablity will be quite different in Odyssey's favor. Marketing and sales of
these coins will be very easy because there are legions of dealers, collectors and numismatic investors already lining
up to buy this material. It is virtually all that is talked about at any major coin show that I've attended recently. Nearly
everyone has their checkbooks wide open because there is so much money to be made here.


My gut instinct is telling me that Odyssey had multiple interested parties to cut marketing deals with and they were
holding all the cards because they knew that dealers/marketers would fight over these rights and pay up.


I'll give you an idea of what I'm talking about. Remember those 1857-S three dollar gold pieces I mentioned which are
ultra rarities, especially in higher UNC grades? It would be very likely that the marketer will have dealers and
collectors fighting over those coins (and others that I haven't mentioned). Private deals to capture even one of those
1857-S Three dollars coins could easily top $1million dollars per coin, because they are simply not available to
buy.....they are that rare----they only come available to buy once or twice in decades.......and it is highly likely that
some of those coins are "finest known" which causes added frenzy and value. If there is a MS65 or MS66 1857-S
three dollar piece, a dealer might pay $1.5M and sell it to a private client for $2.5M. And, those 3 dollar coins are not
the only ones in the total inventory that could command those numbers. There are others that are almost as rare, and
could be finest known.


All I can tell you is that if I were on Odysseys negotiating team, I would not have given up any upside, except an
agreed to percentage to sell them. In fact, I would have have fought for no percentage and tried to negotiate a "flat
rate" per sale based on how much the final sale value is of each coin and artifact. But of course, I don't know the
particulars.

All,


While I'm thinking about it, there is other information along this topic that is worth sharing.


OMEX management is very, very good at marketing shipwreck treasure and maximizing value out of it. A perfect
example is the SS Republic coins they recovered in 2003/2004. The great majority of coins they recovered were
about 43,000 seated liberty half dollars. Sadly, silver is prone to seawater damage hazing and the true numismatic
value of those coins was maybe $100 - $150 dollars each. Meaning that the majority of the Republic recovery was
only worth $5M - $7M dollars. However, OMEX was very smart in how they marketed and sold those coins.


What they did was to have them conserved and slabbed in plastic as "shipwreck affect" coins from the SS Republic
shipwreck. They marketed and sold them for 10 times their real value (about $1000 dollars each). Of course it's taken
10 years and there is still some Republic inventory left, but fact is, they got $40M dollars for coins that they by rights
only should have realized about $6M for.


They were also very smart about the 2000 gold coins recovered from the republic. Spot gold and numismatic gold
coin values were very low in 2004. Omex opted to hold those most valuable gold coins and use them for collateral on

fifth third bank securitized loans. Ultimately, they paid back the loans and sold the gold coins later at substantially
more than they would have realized had they sold them in 2004/2005.


The lesson here is that OMEX will have many coins that they take possession of from the Central America which they
will market and sell in the same way. All those seated liberty dimes in the last inventory sheet are only worth 75-100
dollars each as seawater damaged coins, but OMEX will likely market and sell them over time for 10 times their value
slated as Central America shipwreck affect coins. Same the many Quarters and half dollars too. They may hold on to
some of the gold coins or bars too whose values may be depressed today. So even if OMEX takes $30M-$40M
dollars in CA coins as their part of the recovery (which at this juncture seems they will take at least that much as their
share), over 5 to 7 years, they may turn their CA inventory into actual sales of $60M - $100M dollars.


Something to think about. there's more value here than meets the eye.

Everyone,


Just a quick update on the new inventory valuation. I completed the line by line last night and found that there were
alot more quater Eagles and Half Eagles that were common and figure to be circulated (dating from the early 1850's).
This affected my original valuation somewhat because those coins from a pure numismatic market perspective would
only be worth $1800 - $2500 dollars each. I had originally allocated a blanket $5000 each in the quick eval.


So after my more comprehensive valuation, I came up on the low side.......conservative value of $6.7M dollars.
Remember all my previous valuation restrictions apply to the conservative figure. I still only valued the double eagles
at 5K, which is artificially low. I also did not not factor in any silver coins or personal artifacts. I also did not factor in
value for the private mint california fractional gold coins (which there were a few hundred for those) and no value
added for the CA provenance. I also was very conservative on the three dollars gold pieces which have the potential
to be a big wild card.

So, keeping with my two value scenario.......


Extreme conservative value: $6.7M 
More realistic value with all items accounted in value equation: $7.5M - $8M

Bill,


One interesting point on the dimes. It is very possible that there are a substantial number of 1856-S dimes in the mix
of 9000 or so that dimes that have been brought up so far.


The 1856-S is a rare date. It catalogues for $125 in good and $4500 in MS60. They would likely all be
UNCIRCULATED or very close AU's. Any 1856-S dimes even seawater damaged would command a substantial
premium over not so rare seawater damaged silver coins.


I will be interested to see in the coming months and year or so, if OMEX markets them as shipwreck affect coins and
at what price. Even as seawater damaged coins, if they are UNCIRCULATED, I would be a buyer at $1000 each.
Somehow though, I can't imagine that OMEX and their marketing agent would miss that and will probably have them
priced at much more than their real value.


If you really want to buy some dimes of that era, do yourself a favor and buy common dates that are original,
undamaged, not cleaned. The common ones are not expensive in AU or MS60, and you don't have to settl;e for
damaged or impaired coins.


Use your redbook to get a rough value assessment for common ones like the 1850's Philadelphia mint dimes. The
redbook value will be about 20% higher than what you would really have to pay retail, especially if you bargain and
negotiate at a coin show.

Ship - How large is the market for 1856-S dimes in MS-60 or better? Will the addition of say 2000 of these
coins "flood" the market, or are there enough buyers to take them all without a serious price reduction? Will
salt water damage preclude MS-60 grading?  
What about 1857-S $20 gold coins, MS-60 or better?

Bill,


2000 of the 1856-s dimes in AU or UNC will cause a bit of price errosion, but not much because as with most rarer
date coins, circulated specimens are the most abundant, and the AU and UNCs are few and far between. Saltwater

damaged silver coins will not have a grade assigned to them by most of the grading companies except ANACs who
will assign a technical detail grade no higher than "UNC Detail", and then they will put another remark like "seawater
damage". What they try to purvey about the coin is the level of detail remaining on the devices based on wear, and
then qualify the damage problem with the coin. Most Grading companies don't do that because if a coin is damaged
or cleaned, grade technically becomes irrelavent because damaged or cleaned coins are viewed as not collectible.
However, with very rare coins, some collectors are willing to buy damaged or impaired coins to get the level of detail
that they desire to match the rest of their collection.


As for the 1857-S double eagles, there may be a little price errosion, but they will conserve out as original and the CA
provenance should carry their value higher once they hit the collector market. So you will see Mint State grades
assigned to them because there will be no evident damage once they are fully conserved. These coins in MS63 to
MS65 should still sell for about $7K - $14K each.
