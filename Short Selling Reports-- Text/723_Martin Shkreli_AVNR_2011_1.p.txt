Avanir Pharmaceuticals: Compelling Short Sale Opportunity
May 31, 2011 3:47 AM ET167 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


Shares of Avanir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AVNR) represent a compelling short sale
opportunity. I calculate fair value of AVNR at just $1 per share, versus the current market
price of $4.62. Importantly, I think the price will approach this value rapidly given weak
Nuedexta sales and short intellectual property life.


Nuedexta is the combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine for the treatment of a
neurological condition called ‘pseudobulbar affect’. This is a rare condition which results in
uncontrolled laughing or crying in patients with neurological damage (multiple sclerosis,
ALS, stroke, etc.). Nuedexta is Avanir’s only drug, either approved or in development. In
clinical study, the efficacy of Nuedexta was modest. For example, after 12 weeks of
treatment, the average number of laughing/crying incidences for placebo patients
decreased by 3, while the average number for patients on Nuedexta decreased by 4.


Put another way (as described in an AVNR press release in October 2009), after 12
weeks of clinical study, 61% of patients on placebo had had no PBA episode in the prior 2
weeks, compared to 80% on Nuedexta. That is, Nuedexta provided 19% fewer emotional
outbursts than did a sugar pill. Nuedexta also provided an advantage in another measure,
the least squares CNS-L score (Center for Neurologic Studies Liability Scale, a seven-
item self-report questionnaire with 3 items assessing crying and 4 assessing laughter). At
week 12, CNS-L improved in placebo patients by 6 points, compared to 8 points in
Nuedexta patients.


Having only one approved drug, with nothing else in its pipeline, makes calculating the
value of Avanir relatively easy.

Avanir’s second quarter launch isn’t going much better than the first. “Better” is all relative
of course as you’ll see in the valuation section. The discontinuation rate of Nuedexta is
quite high – NRx (new prescriptions) are not translating into TRX (total prescriptions),
which, as one analyst put it, describes the “episodic” nature of how these patients take this
drug. It appears many patients feel Nuedexta is worse than their PBA symptoms. Because
there has never been a drug for PBA, there should have been a bolus in patients at the
launch who quickly came on to Nuedexta. With only 300-400 TRx weekly (at $490 a Rx
that is a paltry $10 million/year sales run-rate), we are left to ask, “that’s it? Those are all
the patients who have been waiting and clamoring for a PBA drug? Definitely a head-
scratcher.


The notion that Avanir has to educate physicians to bring the PBA out of their patients in
testimonials is a tough sell. MS and ALS patients see their physicians often. The
discontinuation rate, coupled with the idea that PBA is simply not a common condition –
neurological issues are rare to begin with, and PBA so severe it merits special
pharmacokinetic intervention with a relatively cheap drug ($5,000 annual cost) spells a
product that can’t support its associated sales force cost. Finally, I wouldn’t underestimate
that sales reps are “journeymen”. Once they realize their drug isn’t hitting targets, they
leave for the next gig.


Valuation – IP

https://seekingalpha.com/article/272463-avanir-pharmaceuticals-compelling-short-sale-opportunity 3/51


Let’s remember the enterprise value (market cap minus cash plus debt) of Avanir is $450
million. My favorite part of the drug business is the relative ease with which one can value
approved drug assets. Drugs have finite lives which are easily determined, and sales
trajectories which are predictable and can be estimated both conservatively and
aggressively.


The poor launch of Avanir is just half of the short thesis. The other half, which seems less
appreciated, is intellectual property. A key determining factor of the value of any
pharmaceutical asset is the life of the asset. Recall the Buffett moat. There is no moat in
the drug business. Your product disappears and you know when it disappears. Sometimes
it’s not so clear, as in this case. However, a good rule of thumb is that if there is no new
chemical entity present in a drug, and it’s a small molecule (in this case, two), the life of
the drug is going to be pretty short.


The statutory exclusivity for a new combination is three years—so that’s the shortest
amount of time Nuedexta can be on the market without generics. An “ANDA” paragraph IV
filing can be filed quickly after approval. For instance, Somaxon (NASDAQ:SOMX)
received a paragraph IV filing for Silenor just weeks after FDA approval. I expect a
Paragraph IV ANDA filer to appear for Nuedexta soon. This begins a 30-month-stay clock
during which the ANDA filer and the innovator litigate over IP.


The IP for Nuedexta is extremely weak. Avanir invented nothing in combining
dextromethorphan and quinidine. Their four patents, 7,659,282, RE38,115, 5,166,207, and
5,206,248 all are preceded by prior art easily found here. The concept of metabolic
enablers and the use of dextromethorphan in pseudobulbar affect was well known before
these patents were filed. There are a number of papers that are easy examples of prior art
showing CYP450 bioconversion of dextromethorphan. Avanir has been working on this
drug for quite some time. Remember that for a patent filing to be valid, there cannot be
public "prior art" which would invalidate that patent.


The '282 patent, which was filed in 2005, has claims which are questionable given the
prior art revealed in the work Avanir published in 2004. Read these claims from RE38,115:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/272463-avanir-pharmaceuticals-compelling-short-sale-opportunity 4/51


We claim:


1. A method of increasing the effectiveness of dextromethorphan in treating chronic
or intractable pain, comprising administering to a patient suffering from chronic or
intractable pain a therapeutically effective dosage of dextromethorphan or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a therapeutically
effective dosage of a debrisoquin hydroxylase inhibitor.


2. The method of claim 1 wherein the debrisoquin hydroxylase inhibitor is selected
from the group consisting of quinidine, quinine, and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts thereof.


And contrast with the claims in 5,166,207 (expired in 2009 or 2014 with full Hatch-
Waxman restoration, too soon to stop a generic):


What is claimed is:


1. A method for enhancing the systemic delivery of dextromethorphan for the
treatment of a neurological disorder resulting in injury to nervous tissue, which
comprises:


administering to a patient suffering from said neurological disorder an amount of a
cytochrome P450IID6 enzyme inhibitor, sufficient to block dextromethorphan
metabolism, and an amount of dextromethorphan, sufficient to treat said
neurological disorder.


2. The method of claim 1, wherein said inhibitor is quinidine.


This is an obvious genus/species patent mistake that likely should have never been
issued. RE38,115 is "anticipated" in patent speak, by '207. One can't claim "enhancing the
systemic delivery of dextro with quinidine for neurological conditions" in one patent
granted in 1992 and then try again to claim "increasing the effectiveness of dextro with
quinidine in pain" in a new patent in 2003. Sadly, this innovation is indeed 19+ years old. A
few years too old for Avanir to fight off generics in just a few years.


Valuation – Based on sales, earnings, cash flow, fair value with asset life determined at
roughly 3 to 5 years, we can easily determine the fair value of the stream of cash flows
that encompass Avanir. While I contest Avanir will never be profitable, and ride off into the
sunset like Nitromed (NTMD) and other woe-be-gone companies, let’s assume Avanir is
purchased by a company who would almost eliminate all of their costs. This might be a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/272463-avanir-pharmaceuticals-compelling-short-sale-opportunity 5/51


more fair way to value Avanir since a buyer could afford to pay an enhanced price using
this methodology. Top funds employ frameworks like this to allow them to figure out fair
value when it is obscured by investment. Let’s be very kind to Avanir and see what
happens.


Sales Gross Profit SG&A Operating Income Net Income


2012 34 31 10 21 21


2013 70 63 10 53 53


2014 104 94 10 84 67


2015 136 122 10 112 90


2016 176 159 10 149 119


I’m being very generous to Avanir to illustrate a point. I don’t think Avanir will achieve
these sales estimates – the current sales trend suggests they’d be very lucky to achieve
half or a quarter of these estimates. Valuing Avanir assuming a takeout and almost zero
costs (SG&A is actually 5x what I am estimating) is also aggressive. The NPV of these 5
years of cash flows plus the current cash is just $321 million or $2.64 per share (10%
discount rate). If you don't know how to calculate NPVs, please learn as it is 1) easy and
2) the cornerstone of finance. In Microsoft Excel, type =NPV(discount rate, stream of cash
flows).


For example, in the above cash flow table, try =NPV(10%,21,53,67,90,119). You can use
your own estimates, of course, and toy with the discount rate. Keep in mind AVNR is
losing lots of money at the moment, so any forecast of cash flow is aggressive, and in my
mind, unlikely.


Part of my goal writing here is not only to "show my work", but also to teach how a fund
like mine values a firm like Avanir. This is my 12th year in the hedge fund business and I
am happy to share what I've learned and my experiences (good and bad!) with you all.


Avanir is likely the next Somaxon

Comments (167)


The similarities between Somaxon and Avanir are uncanny. Somaxon is a stock that has
fallen 75% since approval of their only drug, Silenor. Like Silenor, Nuedexta is not a new
drug, per se. It is a combination of two old drugs for a new indication. Silenor is one old
drug for a new indication. Both drugs have questionable intellectual property protection.
As mentioned elsewhere in this report, Somaxon received paragraph IV generic ANDA
filings for their drug just six weeks into their launch.


The weak sales of Silenor were evident early - as a matter of fact, Silenor actually out-sold
Nuedexta in its first quarter by a large margin ($1.274 million for Silenor versus $0.583
million for Nuedexta). The companies have very similar expense structures as well. Sadly,
Silenor will likely outsell Nuedexta as well in their second launch quarter. What does this
all mean? Well, Somaxon's market cap is $100 million, 1/5th of that of Avanir. This
suggests AVNR may fall 80% as investors realize the companies' prospects are not too
different.


When the best case scenario for a stock you own is you will lose 40%, you should sell.
The worst case scenario is the Nuedexta launch continues to be poor. At $490 per
prescription, the company would need to generate (on average) 10x the prescriptions it is
generating now to achieve these numbers. This would require a miracle ramp in sales
never seen before in the drug business (I’ve done every permutation possible a very rich
data set and I can say with confidence, the numbers above are BEST CASE)—all to result
in a 40% loss for shareholders, mind you. Because the drug will go generic in just a few
years (find a combination of two really old drugs that lasted longer than five years—you
won’t), and Avanir is spending quite a lot on their infrastructure (at this rate, the company
will be out of money soon), I suspect the stock will be down at least 50% in the next 6 to
12 months.


Disclosure: I am short AVNR, and the firm I work at is short AVNR and may change its
position at any time without notice.


Additional disclosure: I promise to donate 50% of my personal AVNR-related profits to
charity. I agree to be held accountable to this.

I'm in full agreement with Bert (and Betty urging him to publish a rebuttal). This "article" is so full of
inaccuracies and outright lies I quit reading it after the first few paragraphs and skipped right to the comments
section, knowing that there would be a thundering response exposing this author's outrageous claims, and I
sure wasn't wrong about that!


BTW, disclosing that you and your firm are short AVNR does not exclude you and SA from the liabilities of
libel, should AVNR choose to file suit against you. And by god I sure hope they do, someone has to stand up
and put a stop to those responsible for constantly attempting to torpedo stocks for their own personal gain.

Author’s reply »  Hi Bert. I don't need help with AVNR. I probably won't cover until the stock hits $1 - $2 as I
predicted. There are no factual errors, misleading statements or unreasonable comparisons in my thesis. I
have no interest in getting anyone to sell their shares. The market solves these problems over time and I am
patient.


I prefer to go long stocks which are mathematically viable investments. I outlined a very serious case for why
Avanir is one of my largest short positions. My work is based on reliable value investing methodologies that
take into account all possible scenarios. It is impossible for Avanir to be a compelling long.

B.S. I'll only waste my time mentioning one, your "Having only one approved drug, with nothing else in its
pipeline" statement. You obviously did zero DD on AVNR's "pipeline", and/or intentionally failed to mention
AVP-923:


Avanir files IND for AVP-923 
Tuesday, April 5, 2011


Avanir Pharmaceuticals has announced that it has filed the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for
AVP-923 which is an investigational product being developed to treat Central Neuropathic Pain in Patients
with Multiple Sclerosis.


Avanir expects to enroll 400 patients in the phase 2 clinical trial in 2011.


Still wanna stand by that ludicrous "I didn't lie about anything" statement? Else admit to a horribly sloppy
piece of writing designed to enrich your own pocket - the same way you tried to torpedo NEOP today in
another hatchet job.


I think you'll make a pretty damn good contrarian indicator on when to get into a stock if you keep it up at this
pace!

No, it's not. Although it has same two ingredients, they're testing different combinations/levels than what's in
Nuedexta, and for a different target population, one much larger than PBA.


If/when it gets approved, it will sell under a different name, as it will NOT be the same drug as Nuedexta.


Repeating lies doesn't make them true no matter how many times you say them. Duh.

LOL! Incredible-this article is nonsense. This guy has no credibility. It is obvious that the shorts in AVNR are
panicking and getting very desperate. And, hard to believe this article is released right at the same time as
the May 31 disclosures regarding the soaring sales and pill counts for Nuedexta, i.e. Scripts sales growth and
pill counts up sharply - week of 5/20/11 was the largest week-over-week growth in pill counts since the launch
of Nuedexta. His statements about the trials and studies are equally preposterous to anyone who has
followed this drug and stock and knows anything about it. And he even misrepresented the facts when he
claimed Nuedexta is AVNR's only approved drug. I guess Abreva doesn't count. No, you are dead on, and the
clear translation for this article is: "Yikes - I am caught short with my pants down - Please bail me out of my
huge mistake!"

Below is a response Avanir recently sent to some investors.


--Generally speaking for obvious competitive reasons we do not go into details about our patent estate and IP
strategies. However there is nothing in Martin's article that gives us cause for concern. His arguments are
flawed, inaccurate, and misleading. Although it is fair to say that the outcome of any paragraph IV litigation is
unpredictable, Avanir is confident that our patents are valid and enforceable and will stand up to challenge.
An example of the author’s clear lack of understanding of patent law (or desire to mislead a non-sophisticated
investor) is his assertion that the “2004 paper by Brooks renders the ‘282 patent invalid.” This statement is
completely false because the priority date (the date the provisional application was filed) for the ‘282 patent is
July 2002. Anything published after the priority date cannot be deemed “prior art.”--

it is very striking how you ignored it both here and in my multiple posts on the subject. Denying this fact

One has to wonder how much of what you write is intentionally misleading and how much is just a lack of a

value is dropping quickly. My math is very traditional and unbiased. I've dispassionately valued hundreds of
stocks and this is one of the most expensive relative to fair value. A drug with no IP is not worth much. Look
at Somaxon.

It is obvious they burn cash. Avanir is not required to keep this kind of high optempo. The cash-burn rate is
due to numerous issues.

I LOL'd too when i read it...it is incredible! You are going to need to write a lot of blogs to make up the losses you will
have. We'll see what the short level in a few days. My guess is you are using the congressional letter you wrote as
cover time.


Lets face it -- We have 72% institutional investors and growing. Smaller and smaller float for retail investors to
purchase. You have to buy back more shares than the retail investors currently own. My guess is shorts are swapping
spit, and trading shares back and forth as they have to repurchase shares. They are hoping for a miracle that the
price won't spike like DNDN. Sorry buddy but come the new year, we'll be looking at an approval for DNP and
European sales. Things will start ramping up quite nicely.

also basic therapeutic index/NOAEL. It doesn't really matter since AVNR will receive a Paragraph IV soon,
and a generic will launch at risk after the 30 month stay. This will render AVNR worthless.

compliance offer to ensure we do not trade on insider information. Thank you for your interest in this!


It was obvious to us that a paragraph IV would be filed. It should be obvious to anyone after witnessing the
debacle of Somaxon. The way I see it, Avanir is "the next Somaxon".


Regarding my CP filing, yes, I admit I had knowledge I was going to file it before filing it. :)


Thanks,

Obvious? For a drug, that according to you, would only have $10M in sales/yr, tops? Where's the profit for a
generic after all the costs of bringing it to market are subtracted, especially assuming that it would sell for a
substantially lower price than Nuedexta, slicing that $10M to shreds?


Answer: the market for Nuedexta is MUCH LARGER than you and others have been trying to claim here and
elsewhere. Huge, in fact, once other indications are approved for use.


P.S. Enron and WorldCom also had plenty of "internal and external counsel as well as a rulebook and a
compliance offer [sic]" officers....existence of said "overseers" doesn't mean squat.

company far from profitability. Generics are filed for all drugs almost immediately. It doesn't cost much and it's
worth it, even at $10 million in annual sales.

" Martin Shkreli Comments (221) It's obvious from the literature that lower doses of quinidine cause less QT
elevation. " 
Actually Avanir showed this is untrue because in their QT study, 10 mg of quinidine surprisingly prolonged the
QT interval about 10.3 milliseconds and this is about identical to the QT prolongation seen with 30 mg of
quinidine. 
The QT prolongation turned out not be the pertinent distinction. 
Clearly, the FDA wanted to establish the minimal effective dose/formulation of dextromethorphan/quini... 
The pertinent distinction with regard to what the FDA ultimately approved is that Avanir's study published in
October, 2004 by Pope showed that 10 mg of quinidine would be likely to be EFFECTIVE.  
This was not obvious to one skilled in the art without the data of the October, 2004 Pope article. 
Since the 7 659 282 patent had its first provisional patent application dated July, 2002, the October, 2004
Pope article is not "prior art" with regard to that patent. 
That patent appears much stronger than Mr. Shkreli has said.

Simply starting with your summary of the STAR trial data we can see elements of manipulation. Your comments on
the data could be fairly summarized as "there was a strong placebo effect". No one argues that however the way a
placebo effect manifest is presented in a dramatically slanted way to support your position.


First, a reduction of 4 episodes/day becomes a lot more impressive when one considers that patients started with an
average of about 5 episodes/day. This is the real effect observed by patients. A better way to frame this might be "if
you want a short term reduction in PBA with about 49% less effect than Nuedexta then you can just give placebo". As
with any placebo effect, the effect can not be expected to be sustained over time as evidenced by low satisfaction
data for patients currently on treatment for PBA and low overall treatment rates for PBA. In addition, simple episode
counts do not take into effect episode severity which was also reduced with treatment.


So as we tease out the treatment effect beyond placebo effect just how significant is it? Well, as I said its 49% more of
an effect which turns out to be highly statistically significant (p<0.01). In addition, the transition from the 12-week
blinded trial to the open label phase was very telling. Essentially ALL patients' episode rates jumped to the placebo
levels at entry with rapid reduction to the treatment rates upon resumption of therapy. This is a strong treament effect!


Finally, your reference given for rates of "no PBA episodes in the past 2 weeks" is a very small subgroup analysis. I'm
sure you understand the statistical problems with choosing one parameter to highlight from one small subgroup...yet it
is not presented with that caveat.


I have to say, I found the simple fact that a short hedge fund manager would take the time to write this as quite bullish.
Hedge funds are all about manipulating sentiment to their liking so they can take/exit positions, right? I guess you are
ready to exit yours.

70%. It's usually not a good sign when investors are willing to pay 50% APR interest rate to short a stock.
They could be making a mistake, but then again, such a high interest is a huge deterrant to shorting. Most
very-high interest rate stocks are great shorts excluding borrow costs.

Again, thank you for your article and your comments. I agree a paragraph IV ANDA will be filed shortly and
the real question is defending the patent. Perhaps N was priced so high to increase the damages that avanir
will claim if the patents are deemed valid and deter the potential infringer. The patent validity is the critical
issue relative to your (and mine) valuation assumptions.

sugar levels.


yeah. that's a real good comparison to a drug combo (a) you say is effective but no worth anything (b) doesn't
kill cells (c) is already made from previously safe molecules (d) doesn't have the same patient risk as MNKD
(e) wasn't touted up so high because it was the saviour for a condition (diabetes) (f) wasn't ALREADY a

andybaron
In your commentary on first-quarter sales, you fail to mention several key points:


- The launch began in the middle of the quarter, on February 7 
- The sales figures are based on IMS prescription estimates, which are self-admittedly inexact in the early stages of a
new-drug launch 
- The indication, PBA, is underdiagnosed because no effective treatment has previously been marketed. Physician
behavior must be modified to incorporate diagnostic tests for PBA, slowing initial uptake 
- The following quarter has seen WTRx almost double to date from 222 on April 1 to 425 on May 20 (WNRx from 178
to 310)


You provide no justification for your sales projections although they are significantly below those of other analysts.


I agree with OFP that the simple fact that you would take the time to write this for a public forum just as the stock is
about to break out above $5 is itself a bullish indicator. Unfortunately for you, the low percentage of float left in retail
hands leaves little room for the article to have much effect, and I doubt that the impressive set of institutions that have
acquired large positions will be influenced.

31 May 2011, 06:46 PM

I actually agree the launch has been slow but I disagree on your comment that the current ramp rate is not
sufficient. In addition, it is not quite as slow as you paint it.


As AndyBaron states, the official launch of Nuedexta was on February 7. Thirteen weeks of net revenue from
that date equates to approximately $1.4-1.5 million while the number you state for revenue occurred at about
11.5 weeks after the initial smattering of scripts written in mid January. Even after launch I think that slow
scripts are not surprising for a poorly recognized condition with a first in class treatment.


TRx pill counts may be initiating a geometric pattern now but assuming only maintenance of the current linear
TRx trend while incorporating a modest increase in pill counts over time we can project the following: 
Avanir will: 
end FY12 with $20mil in cash 
be approximately cash flow neutral start FY13 
end FY13 with $43mil in cash and a FY13 profit of $23mil


I would start to worry if they are not able to maintain that minimum ramp rate but a number of factors may
suggest this is a lower-end projection. We may in fact be about to enter that logarithmic TRx pill count growth
stage as physician awareness grows, screening of patients is instituted, and patients learn there's a treatable

reason for their emotionality. Nuedexta is relatively unique in these aspects and it is the reason, I believe, that
it made your list of slow launches (though I'd say at #8 or #9).


Added to these low end projections is the fact that Nuedexta is a potential pain treatment with completely
novel mechanism. The novel mechanism means it may be added to any pain regimen and, as anyone
treating chronic pain is aware, chronic pain control can ALWAYS be improved. Indications for central pain
should translate well to fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathic pain indications may follow. So with only low-
end projections we have a self-sustaining biotech developing a promising treatment for a potential market of
10+million (in US). If subsequent pain data supports that already collected, off label use should explode prior
to added indications for pain. Finally, there is an expectation of expansion to Europe in the next 2 years which
should double revenues followed by ROW expansion.

Author’s reply »  Thank you for your comments. The IMS data above are apples-to-apples, they include TRX
for the first 13 weeks (regardless of where they fall in the calendar) multiplied by AWP. I ran a regression for
accuracy of reported sales to IMS estimates and they correlate very strongly. Great drugs like Pradaxa and
Victoza launched strong and continued. Weak drugs like BiDil, Silenor and Nuedexta do not. This is more or
less an open-and-shut case.


As far as analyst estimates for Avanir are concerned, notice that all sell-side analysts have lowered their
estimates recently (Avanir missed sales expectations). Don't forget they have huge banking conflicts. I talk to
these analysts routinely (or people that work for me do). They're estimates are suitable toilet paper, but that's
about it.

If this is truly the worst launch, then you shouldn't need to have a disclaimer that says "and may change its
position at any time without notice." Sounds like you are praying for the price to come down so that you can
cover your shares at a cheaper price and profit without telling investors when it makes sense to cover.

Author’s reply »  I took the first 13 weeks of TRX and multiplied by $490. That makes it the slowest launch in
the last 4 years. How is that not terrible?


Also don't forget the drug will go generic soon. Even if they pull $20m in profits out of this that will be their last
year. $20m / shares outstanding = great short.


01 Jun 2011, 06:36 AM 


OFP
Your 13 week revenue figure roughly approximates the IMS TRx x 490 for the first 13 weeks of Q2 (starting
Jan 1). However, as noted the launch did not occur until Feb 7 making IMS data for the week of Feb11 the
first relevant data point. Did you incorporate the early weeks with 0 scripts and then the smattering of
prelaunch scripts?


If we accept your IP arguments at face value I agree the above calculations lose relevance. I won't claim IP
expertise to rival yours or the cadre of lawyers you work with (I won't claim any in fact). However, the
extraordinarily high institutional ownership of AVNR suggests that many firms with similar levels of expertise
and resources do not agree with your thesis that Nuedexta will soon be generic so I am not yet prepared to
accept that argument.

you had plenty of chances to cover at $3.8, why didn't you (or did you).


this is not the best short out there. you have too many uknowns to be shorting this.


you are basing this on a 'poor launch' but the condition was not a well supplied indication. you have therefore
2 unknowns. (1) the number of patients who have been quietly suffereing without help from a non-debilitating
drug and (2) the script growth rate.


this condition can be treated by powerfull antidepressants and other psychotic drugs that have quality-of-life
side effects. this drug doesn't have that. people who avoided the psychotic drugs or were not taking any now
have a sane choice. those that had used the less forgiving drugs now have a drug with tame side effects.


shorting is safer when there is a well known systemic issue aka Blockbuster video...

those numbers are big enough not enough to worry about discounted cash flows and all the rest.

patent attorneys and go to great lengths to prove prior art. A generic will be here soon for Nuedexta. When
have we ever seen old drugs with long IP? Concerta? Oxycontin? It certainly happens but I would not be
counting on it. The dismal sales thus far and Avanir's lack of staying power will result in most reps quitting by
the time a court case decides Nuedexta has no IP.

Thanks for the reply,


Walking away from this article, I could tell a professional level of due diligence was done. The issues you
raise are complex ones and not for the laypeople on SA, so I would caution you not to take the comments too
seriously.


While it's true that use patent are relatively easier to invalid, it doesn't mean that the company can't prove
validity. One point to consider, is that PBA has no other treatment, so how could there be sufficient prior art.
That's the USE in the use-patent. AVNR had to prove in large RCT it's effectiveness.

So the patent related weakness you identified is pretty much the same for ALL use patents and not AVNR's
specifically.


So with that in mind, how many use patents have maintained validity, and how many use patents have
maintained validity for treatment with no other treatment EVER defined.


The answers to these questions would be more relevant than what you've discussed, at least in my opinion.

Thanks for your thought provoking article. 
About AVNR's patents possibly being duplicative, you wrote:  
"The IP for Nuedexta is extremely weak. Avanir invented nothing in combining dextromethorphan and
quinidine. Their four patents, 7,659,282, RE38,115, 5,166,207, and 5,206,248 all are preceded by prior art
easily found here. The concept of metabolic enablers and the use of dextromethorphan in pseudobulbar affect
was well known before these patents were filed." 
The quinidine dose of the 11/1992 and 4/1993 patents is something like 50-150 mg per day while the 2005
patent is for something like 10-30 milligrams per day. 
Does the greatly decreased dosage of quinidine in the 2005 patent make it a patent that is not duplicative of
the much earlier patents? 
Apparently the patent officer thought so, but I would like the opinion of the most knowledgeable person at
your firm. Here's what the patent officer reportedly said, as per Big Gain Hunter on the Avanir Yahoo! Finance
message board: "Excerpts from the patent examiner's 'Statement of reasons for allowance'


"The pending claims of the instant application claim a method for treating pseudobulbar affect or emotional
lability comprising the administration of from about 10 mg/day to about 80 mg/day of dextromethorphan in
combination with from about 10 mg/day to less than about 30 mg/day of quinidine wherein the weight to
weight ratio of dextromethorphan to quinidine is 1:0.5 or less.


The closest prior art is Smith, US Patent No. 5,166,207 in view of Smith, US Patent No. 5.206.248 (Smith
'248)."


"...However, the Smith references do not teach doses of quinidine from about 10 mg/day to less than about 30
mg/day. The Smith references do not specifically teach a weight to weight ratio of dextromethorphan to
quinidine of 1:0.5 or less. 
Furthermore, Applicants have submitted 3 declarations on July 7, 2009 showing unexpected results and
demonstrating why it would not be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to lower the quinidine dosages
with a reasonable expectation of similar success in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect or emotional lability."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/272463-avanir-pharmaceuticals-compelling-short-sale-opportunity 22/51


As an aside, as far as "prior art" on this subject of the lower dose of quinidine being effective is concerned,
Avanir said in early 2007 that they had done an early (I assume around 1999 or 2000) pharmacologic study
showing that 10 mg of quinidine provides about 70% of the maximal inhibition of cytochrome p450 2D6 which
is caused by 25-30 mg of quinidine. I don't know if Avanir made this small study public. Correct me if I'm
wrong, but I guess it doesn't matter if the pharmacologic study was made public because it is all Avanir's
intellectual property anyway and the only question is if the later patents duplicate the earlier patents, right? 
" 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Plus all the weak hands were shaken out from congress. So may not be a great short, but nonetheless your ideas are

again 
125000 patients a year with $5000/ year / patient cost yields revenue per year of $625,000,000.


your numbers mean they only have 2000 patients.

While I don't disagree with your fundamental analysis, there is a very significant line of uptrending support on this
stock seen here. screencast.com/t/V8eEX...


I would wait until that trendline is broken to provide a level of safety before putting on any shorts. Besides..isn't it
difficult to short anything under $5/share?

so not only are you ignore rev run rate with the right patient base, you are now saying it was hard to short this
stock?


so you are betting that AVNR's patient estimate of 2M patients is wrong. 
you are betting that other analysts' patient estimate of 1M patients is wrong.


you have convinced yourself there were NEVER be more than 2000 patients using this drug.


and then went out of your way to short it.

agree with  
Tro Kalayjian that this is by far the best AVNR short story ever published in the media. Very well written and it appears
that market may have taken notice (as evident by the AVNR price drop)

"The indication, PBA, is underdiagnosed because no effective treatment has previously been marketed. Physician
behavior must be modified to incorporate diagnostic tests for PBA, slowing initial uptake"


How odd. If the need for a PBA "drug" is so great, wouldn't MDs be clamoring to prescribe it to their patients who
have suffered so long?


"You provide no justification for your sales projections although they are significantly below those of other analysts."


Not really. Cannacord Adams projects that 2012 sales will be #38 million, very close to 34 million.


"I agree with OFP that the simple fact that you would take the time to write this for a public forum just as the stock is
about to break out above $5 is itself a bullish indicator."


So how do you interpret the 10 AVNR pump pieces on this site since March? Using your logic, I assume that you
believe that those were bearish indicators?

here's some math.


$5000 / year / patient cost (remember congress was complaining and that is the number they used -- oops

$5000 * 2000 patients == $10M per year revenue.

Entertaining - The shorts have shown their hand and exactly how desperate they are. My guess is they now realize
that the institutions are probably still accumulating shares and the shorts are totally locked in - the only move they
have left is to try and write misleading articles like this or pull strings with congressman that owe favors. Either way it
doesn't matter because they are not going to be able to cover 30,000,000+ shares without dramatically increasing the
price. Shorts just better pray that a EU deal is not announced in the short term or interest from a large pharma
announcing a buyout.

With respect to shorts being desperate, and institutions accumulating shares, you are mistaken. Avanir will
need to finance at some point next year at this rate of burn. Shorts never "have" to cover. A lot of artificial
short sales exist due to naked call sales. The only smart institution I see on the Avanir holder's list is Adage. A
lot of funds bought in the last quarter because of Avanir's secondary. I bet some are out by now... we'll see
next quarter!

Dear Short Hedge Fund, 
If this is such a great opportunity and you really believe in your thesis, why wouldn't you add to your position at these
prices or sell call or buy puts. Rather it sounds like you are pleading with the market.


Intentional misrepresentation weaken your case. Here are just a few flaws: 
1) Sales cut to zero after 2016 ? 
2) No mention of other applications. 
3) No mention of other markets (Europe, Japan, etc) 
4) Comparison to Somaxon's market cap - without regard to respective firm's sales, size of market, growth,
competitors, etc.


Disclosure. I also run a HF and use DCF analysis.


31 May 2011, 06:44 PM 


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I added to my position on Friday and today. I'm not pleading with anyone.


1) Sales go to zero when generics happen. I've been in the pharmaceutical investing business for a while and
this is how it works. 
2) My supposition is the drug will go generic before other applications can be approved. 
3) Because the US market generating $10 million on an annual run rate basis at the moment, talk about the
European and Japan markets is a waste of time. 
4) Somaxon has more sales than Avanir and less market cap. I discussed that pretty clearly.

"2) My supposition is the drug will go generic before other applications can be approved." 
Other applications like neuropathic pain don't have to be FDA approved to generate revenues. 
About 20% of prescription drug use in the U.S. is used "off-label."  
Look at what Neurontin off-label sales were for pain, something like $1.3 billion.

1) There's a bit of a difference between selling into a crowded/established market and actually creating a market from

better job. Advancing the standard of care is a hard sell in an industry that is still grappling with the practical inability

to practice basic hygiene in between patients-- published by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. in 1843). In my mind, it might
be easier to target marketing Nuedexta to the primary care givers as opposed to the docs per se. What would you pay
in order to not have to deal with or see a loved one (who recently survived a major stroke that nearly scared you half
to death) sob uncontrollably for hours?


2) IMO, the IP analysis that was presented was incomplete and thus materially flawed, but you really can't have it
both ways here. There is no practical generic threat if there is no significant market. If and when Avanir builds their
market, then generics might start to take notice and think about filing an ANDA. If and when the generics enter the
Nuedexta fray, the "shorts" might be feeling a bit squeezed. There's clearly a window of opportunity here. The main
question is whether they'll be able to execute.


31 May 2011, 07:23 PM 


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1) I am familiar with companies "building markets" but I think the small price of this drug plus
the relative rarity and limited severity of the condition will result in very limited sales prior to generic entry.


2) Thanks for your opinion on the IP analysis. Somaxon generated just a million or so in sales in its first
quarter and still received a Paragraph IV ANDA. These days, as long as formulation is not difficult, generics
go after anything.

generics won't go after it because you say there's no business to go after.

CVS unit sued by IMS Health over drug-data contracts


By Phil Milford 
Bloomberg News


WILMINGTON, Delaware - A unit of CVS Caremark Corp., the largest U.S. provider of prescription drugs, was sued
by market-intelligence firm IMS Health Inc. for allegedly violating contracts to supply drug-sales data.


IMS, based in Norwalk, Conn., is asking a Delaware Chancery Court judge to force the CVS unit to comply with the
agreements. The contract terms weren’t disclosed in the complaint, filed under seal in Wilmington on Feb. 7.

“IMS has suffered and is suffering injury, which can be only incompletely compensated through a later award of
damages,” the company said in redacted court papers made public on Wednesday.


More than 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed in the U.S. annually, IMS said. It collects data from pharmacies for use
by drug companies, marketers and government agencies for research, sales, compliance, safety and tracking
disease.


CVS fills about 1 billion prescriptions a year, IMS lawyers said in a filing. CVS, based in Woonsocket, has 7,000

NUEDEXTA Scripts Growth Strong — 
Weekly Pill Counts Up Sharply


• As we previewed, weekly NUEDEXTA scripts were strong for the week of May 20th with an increase of ~4000 new 
pills prescribed, this week alone. This represents the largest week-over-week increase in pill count since launch. The 
Wolters Kluwer end-user demand estimate for the week of May 20th is $184 thousand and it appears that the launch
curve is 
steepening, given a near doubling in the run-rate since the beginning of the quarter.


• We believe, NUEDEXTA sales are on track to meet or exceed our end-user estimate of $1.6 million for the quarter, 
given weekly sales to date. Given that PBA is a condition for which no prior therapies existed and that physicians may 
have rarely, if ever, screened for the condition, the pace of the launch may not be indicative of the overall success of 
NUEDEXTA.


• The lower repeat Rx’s noted in this week’s data are not a concern to us, given that declines in repeat Rxs had also 
occurred in prior weeks and were followed by strong upticks. Repeat Rx numbers should be interpreted with caution. 
in our opinion. given that many may represent multi-month mail orders and that pill counts may better reflect sales. 
Lumpiness in the launch metrics at this stage in the launch is typical.


• The company has noted that MS and ALS physicians have been recommending NUEDEXTA to their colleagues 
treating stroke and traumatic brain injury patients. It appears that, given new evidence that MS and ALS physicians 
may be more conservative in their prescribing practices than originally thought, the company is beginning to tweak
their 
launch plans. Part of this unanticipated prescribing behavior may have resulted in the initially slow launch.


• We currently model the markets for NUEDEXTA in the stroke and traumatic brain injury indications at twice the size 
of the market for ALS and MS. Recall, as a base-case scenario, we had projected that peak sales in MS and ALS
alone 
would reach $500 million in 2017; accelerated adoption in these other settings could represent upside to our sales 
estimates. Considering stroke, AD, traumatic brain injury and PD, we estimate peak sales could be in excess of $1
billion in 
the US and EU.


• AVNR’s development pipeline remains robust and its “pipeline in a pill” provides an efficient reduced-risk path to 
additional sales of NUEDEXTA for other indications. As part of its strategy, the company is looking to expand 
NUEDEXTA into MS-related pain, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and behavioral disorders associated with
dementia; 
and may initiate trials in 2011.

100's. Go figure.  
The author is absolutely right, Avanir may well be a terminal short. Will they even become profitable before a generic
filing? Before a generic approval? The only interesting thing about Avanir I can find is the neuropathic pain data, but
I'm not sure the FDA would be comfortable granting approval for that large a "real" patient population for a drug with a
potential qtc effect.

"The only interesting thing about Avanir I can find is the neuropathic pain data"


Did AVNR ever disclose what this did in diabetic neuropathy? From what I can see in press releases there
were "lower pain ratings than placebo patients (p less than 0.0001 in both cases)" but I did not see what
magnitude of benefit was. Odd.


From their 10-K, it looks like they discontinued the diabetes neuropathy back in 2008 or so. That would have
been a pretty big market opportunity.


I guess it could work in central neuropathy.

AVNR, SOMX, POZN, Etc


I suggest everyone to read the article written by a Hedge Fund Manager, Martin Shkreli.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/272463-avanir-pharmaceuticals-compelling-short-sale-opportunity 36/51


It is about AVNR, and it is also about SOMX. In nowadays, Hedge Funds are almost the alias of Shorts – i.e., most
shorts are done by hedges. Hedge managers are intelligent, hard working and often successful. Except Cramer (was
a hedge manager – HM thereafter), I haven’t heard from any live hedges. Martin’s article enables me understanding
how HM are working.


For AVNR case, Martin’s key-points are Weak IP (intelligent property) and Poor Marketability. He repeatedly illustrated
SOMX’s case to support his judgment.


First at all, I admit that HMs did very well when SOMX was around $10, immediately after Silenor approval, with the
helps from blind pumpers on SOMX Message Board. However, their recent shorts on SOMX around $3 are very risky,
and their shorts on AVNR around $4 are even more risky. In the title, I hint that I will involve the POZN case, but I
don’t want to deal with the past. I will utilize POZN case to describe the changing IP environment.


Let’s take the last issue first: POZN and changing IP environment.


Recently, Judge Leonard Davis granted POZN a preliminary injunction with respect to the Treximet case (Case 6:08-
cv-00437-LED, Document 415, Filed 04/14/11). The final ruling is expected to come out soon. Treximet is a
combination of Imitrex and Naproxin. Long-term Pharma/Bio investors remember that, as Treximet approved in April,
2008, shorts spread “weak IP, existent generics, and poor marketability” and made a lot of money by shorting POZN
again and again. Now, Treximet’s annual revenue is about $200M and Judge Davis’ ruling may help Treximet moving
ahead aggressively.


Finding a new compound becomes harder and harder. Reformulation becomes a valid way in drug development: new
drugs by reformulating old compounds. Any real intellectual properties generated in reformulations should be
recognized. Judge Davis’ move will have a deep influence and big impact to drug development.


If AVNR’s IP on Neudexta can be validated, Martin will lose multi-million for sure.


Let me go back to SOMX -- the similarity between SOMX and AVNR would save our time of detailing AVNR.

Author’s reply »  This is a great reply - I think you are furthering this discussion meaningfully by bringing up
Treximet. Thank you!


I also mentioned other method of use drugs that have had successful long-life: Concerta, Oxycontin, etc.

stockcatalystsdotcom
all this denies simple math.


you have 2 variables. number of patients, yearly revenue per patient. 
$5000 is the yearly cost/ patient.


the shorts and their coherts only make sense of no more that 2000 people / year ever use this drug.

which if so, generics would consider it too small and wouldn't compete anyway.


this is about money, revenue and not apple/banana comparisons to irrelevant launches of other drugs. you
can have story correlation (SOMX) without business correlation (different molecule, different indication,
different revenue).

You say you are patient but times plays against bears. Repo rate (= interest rate that brokers ask to keep a short
position) is around 60%. At this level, if you hold your position for 1 year, it will cost you $4,5*60% = $2,70 per share!
You shorted @ $4,20 but what is the amount of interest you have already paid?

Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks hccm. As a large short seller I am faced with borrow costs everyday. I've never seen
a borrow cost stay high for very long. I was a large short-seller of ARNA and MNKD. When borrow rates spike
from 0% and easy to borrow to 60% and hard to borrow, you generally have a stock that's about to plummet
on your hands. That just happened to AVNR.


You're right that returns net of interest are very important and we track that closely internally. I think we're
paying roughly 50% annualized interest rate to borrow our AVNR shares.


01 Jun 2011, 04:14 PM

Hi Martin, 
Interesting article...the best short argument I've seen yet. I have a question: 
Why is it when shares are harder to borrow do you theorize that the price per share is about to plummet?
Seems to me it would be the other way around - but I admit I don't know much about shorting or how that
works. 
Thanks in advance.

Author’s reply »  When people like myself are jumping up and down to short a stock, so much so that they're
willing to pay a 50% annual interest rate to do so, you're dealing with a good short.

SOMX Case


IP -- 7AM Patents 
The generic to Silenor is the most on-time challenge in the history, only a few weeks after approve (usually about 6
months). I believe that it was due to FDA allowed taking doxepin (instead of Silenor tablet) as Reference for generic
Test. The primary patent for Silenor, 5,502,047, will be expired in March 2013. ANDAs even don’t challenge that one.
The challenged one, 6,211,229, will be expired in February 2020. IMO, the line to distinguish chronic and transient
insomnia is fuzzy. It will be very hard for SOMX to defend it. Just as everybody thought that Silenor’s exclusivity will
end in mid 2013, SOMX announced they have new patents coming.


Pharmas used to use 11PM patents to fence generics off, i.e., new patents come just before expiration of old patent.
Congress and FDA already took actions to ban any 11PM patents. However, in accord with FDA’s Guidance for
Industry “Listed Drugs, 30-Month Stays, and Approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) Applications Under Hatch-Waxman,
as Amended by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Questions and
Answers),” a new 30-month stay may be triggered by a new patent if


• The patent was submitted before the date that the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application (excluding an amendment or
supplement) was submitted to FDA, and  
• The patent owner or NDA holder initiates a patent infringement action on the patent within 45 days of the date that it
receives notice of the certification.


I.e., Congress and FDA allow 7AM patents.


SOMX disclosed five 7AM patent applications. One was issued by USPTO. That single patent has extended Silenor’s
exclusivity to November 2013 by 30-month stay only. Any issuances of new 7AM patent will extend Silenor’s
exclusivity. Furthermore, these 7AM patents are based on NDA clinical data, and old doxipin was approved 30 years
ago. Therefore, the novelty of the 7AM patents is very likely valid (I think AVNR may have their 7AM patents with
Neudexta as well).


Ramp Sales Up 
In December, 2010, TheStreet’s AF said Silenor won’t sell. However, Silenor’s weekly TRx is about 3,000 now. The
scrip number may appoach 5 digit at the year-end.


AVNR will follow.


Niche Product 
Without proper on-set effect, Silenor may never be a blockbuster. However, as a non-scheduled drug, Silenor’s sleep-
maintenance advantages promote itself against GABAs. I have established a small network, with a few elderly, to
monitor the use of Silenor. If the dose is more than needed, the patients may have had too much sleep. With
appropriate dose amount, Silenor gives every patient 7 to 8 hours sleep. More impressively, the sleep is almost
natural. Be aware, even 1% penetration of insomnia market will give Silenor $200M annual revenue.

yes, they and AVNR are the same story. you've now convinced me. no one has heard of insomnia (like PBA)

AVNR is heading down the road ALTH way, huge expectations but company couldn't materialize any significant sales
and look where ALTH is today.. ALTH have only one approved product - Folotyn which is priced $36,000/month and
company bloated the sales potential. Its sad what happened to those large funds which accumulated their shares -
whopping 98 percent is owned by institutional investors. I can draw some similarities between ALTH and AVNR..


But I have a question, why short AVNR now, especially it is trend favoring longs? The street sees the weekly
prescription data and that optimism is reflected in the trend going higher.


I would think, to short in 5's and cover in 3's would make better sense.

When should we expect to see the “ANDA” paragraph IV filing. I would of expected to see it already. This large short
interest has been hanging for awhile and has to be getting expensive. That would lead me to believe that those shorts
expect this “ANDA” paragraph IV filing in the imminent future?

Two comments that you made (one from the article, one a response), which go hand in hand... 
"Nuedexta is Avanir’s only drug, either approved or in development." &


"You realize this company is generating $5 - $10m in annual sales on a $50m+ budget?"


Well, my two cents is this...if Avanir only has one drug, Nuedexta, which just hit the market, how is the company
generating sales of 5-10m annually? Oh, that's right, I guess Abreva was an oversite....or just flat out BAD DD...

Hey Martin,


With all due respect to your research, I think this one is going to be your biggest blunder. I was short on this stock but
not anymore..I see weekly script numbers going up, and that optimism is reflected on the stock price of AVNR. I see
you're risking your client's assets on a 4 dollar stock, which is trending higher. Didn't you wrote, you have to pay 50
percent interest?


In the end, what matters is the "stock price" - who gives a flying eff whether they have a weak IP or sales are slow? If
chart is trending bullish, its time to get the eff outta there...............

Did you short SOMX as well. In your article, you treated SOMX as it is worth nothing. However, with 4 digits weekly
scrip (3,000 now, and going to approach 5 digit by the year-end), you'd better to cover ASAP. But if your short position
is too large, your covery will definitely trigger a squeez to hurt yourself.


Thanks to your article, I am understanding hedges much better than before. Your article reveals that you have lost
your coolness. A HM would be unemotional of facing possible loses (just working harder to get back from future
tradings).


03 Jun 2011, 02:56 PM 


sleepdoc
You present a cogent short argument, and even though I am long, I read your article with interest. Despite the links
above about your quotes on Northfield, you were ultimately correct on that one. I also agree with you on SOMX.
However, I believe you will lose on this one.


I won't argue with you that the launch has been less than stellar. However, using first 13 week data has its drawbacks
and is unlikely to be related to ultimate steady state and future share price. Were you aware that neurologists were
giving out 3 to 4 weeks of samples of Nuedexta? Other medications on that list were likely handed out with far fewer
samples. Thus, looking at just 13 weeks short changes accounting of actual scripts WRITTEN (not filled) during the
first 13 weeks.


The launch will be drawn out with Nuedexta because both the indication and the class of drug is novel. This also
reduces the value of looking at the first 13 weeks for guidance.


Also, off-label use will occur later in the game, not during the first quarter. Patients will stay on Nuedexta long term
and TRxs will increase more than you predict. Pharmacy plans will cover Nuedexta for neuro patients without too

In comparison, Silenor will have no off-label use, people not getting enough benefit will not refill and pharmacy plans
will not make prescribing it easy.


03 Jun 2011, 08:15 PM 


andybaron
You seem intelligent and careful, so I must conclude that you realize you are in trouble with Avanir. Even if IP troubles
eventually torpedo the stock, that won't happen for years and carrying costs will have eliminated any chance of a
profit on your position by then.


The simple act of a paragraph IV ANDA filing will be treated as routine. It may have some short-term negative impact
on retail holders but certainly wouldn't bring the stock to $1. Neither will a slow but steady sales ramp.


With $100 million in the bank, Avanir has time to let sales build without need to consider dilution. To come out ahead,
you need the stock to completely fall apart in the next year or so, a year in which awareness and scripts will continue
building for PBA, possibly taking off exponentially, while off-label use for neuropathic pain will also build.


The sales team isn't quitting. The executive team is squarely focused on commercialization with deep marketing
experience. And doctors who try the drug are getting positive results. The stock held up quite well this week in a down
market, and volume (over 22 million shares on Friday) continues to suggest institutional accumulation. You win some,
you lose some. I think you are looking for an opportunity to cover.


04 Jun 2011, 12:33 PM 


MontanaFede
Martin,


There is another school of thought regarding generics. You mentioned generics will enter soon in to Avanir's turf - The
sales for Neudexta so not that large at this point, since company is still building a market and educating physicians
about PBA. I don't think its viable for any generic maker to face a lawsuite where payoff isn't that huge. It makes
sense for a generic maker if drug has $200-300 million of sales, and Nuedexta isn't there yet.


Generic talk is mindless at this point.


I hope you're still reading the comment section.


04 Jun 2011, 05:09 PM 


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  You'd be surprised at how quickly generics strike. I am thinking about starting a small
generics company and the math makes sense to genericize drugs like Nuedexta. After all, look at the
Somaxon PIV. I think harder to make drugs are a different story but the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient)
is so easily sourced in this case. One would just have to defeat the Avanir claims in court which as I show
above, are trivial.

So Nuedexta is run-rating in the $10 million range. 180 day exclusivity would be worth $5 million, maybe $3
million after tax, legal expenses, manufacturing. That's the worst case and it already seems worth it (>50%
IRR). I'm not an expert in this field, but I know a few small generic companies and they certainly are eager for
opportunities like this--doesn't move the needle for TEVA or WPI, but those folks still try, too.


04 Jun 2011, 05:39 PM 


C.L.
It is supprise to me why Neudexta hasn't got an ANDA challenge so far. For any branded drug with a few
$10M potential revenue ($100M is like blood for "flies"), ANDA usually happened after 6 months of approval.
Now neudexta has been approved for 7 months!


What I can image is that the product may have some difficulties to be copied..


05 Jun 2011, 08:32 PM 


MontanaFede
If you're selling your generics at the same rate (saying that Nuedexta $10 million run rate) and expect to produce the
same revenues, why would Doctors and patients like will prefer your Walmart brand generics, when there is quality
product (Nuedexta) available in the market which received formal FDA approval?


You can imagine 10 different scenarios in your mind, but I'm not convinced (and I'm not a zealous long, like some
other folks who commented here)

Author’s reply »  The dynamics of two companies splitting an API market (innovator vs. generic) are very
interesting. SNY and MNTA are going at it on a very big scale at the moment. I think as a consumer you
generally want to go with the brand, but when there is no capacity constraint, price does rule. It will be
interesting to see if and when Nuedexta goes generic!

Thanks for your thought provoking article. About AVNR's patents possibly being duplicative, you wrote:  
"The IP for Nuedexta is extremely weak. Avanir invented nothing in combining dextromethorphan and quinidine. Their
four patents, 7,659,282, RE38,115, 5,166,207, and 5,206,248 all are preceded by prior art easily found here. The
concept of metabolic enablers and the use of dextromethorphan in pseudobulbar affect was well known before these
patents were filed." 
The quinidine dose of the 11/1992 and 4/1993 patents is something like 50-150 mg per day while the 2005 patent is
for something like 10-30 milligrams twice a day. 
Does the greatly decreased dosage of quinidine in the 2005 patent make it a patent that is not duplicative of the much
earlier patents? 
Apparently the patent officer thought so, but I would like the opinion of the most knowledgeable person at your firm.

Here's what the patent officer reportedly said, as per Big Gain Hunter on the Avanir Yahoo! Finance message board:
"Excerpts from the patent examiner's 'Statement of reasons for allowance'


"The pending claims of the instant application claim a method for treating pseudobulbar affect or emotional lability
comprising the administration of from about 10 mg/day to about 80 mg/day of dextromethorphan in combination with
from about 10 mg/day to less than about 30 mg/day of quinidine wherein the weight to weight ratio of
dextromethorphan to quinidine is 1:0.5 or less.


The closest prior art is Smith, US Patent No. 5,166,207 in view of Smith, US Patent No. 5.206.248 (Smith '248)."


"...However, the Smith references do not teach doses of quinidine from about 10 mg/day to less than about 30
mg/day. The Smith references do not specifically teach a weight to weight ratio of dextromethorphan to quinidine of
1:0.5 or less. 
Furthermore, Applicants have submitted 3 declarations on July 7, 2009 showing unexpected results and
demonstrating why it would not be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to lower the quinidine dosages with a
reasonable expectation of similar success in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect or emotional lability." 
As an aside, as far as "prior art" on this subject of the lower dose of quinidine being effective is concerned, Avanir
said in early 2007 that they had done an early (I assume around 1999 or 2000) pharmacologic study showing that 10
mg of quinidine provides about 70% of the maximal inhibition of cytochrome p450 2D6 which is caused by 25-30 mg
of quinidine. I don't know if Avanir made this small study public. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess it doesn't matter if
the pharmacologic study was made public because it is all Avanir's intellectual property anyway and the only question
is if the later patents duplicate the earlier patents, right?" 
Thanks for your consideration fo these questions.

The Brooks article is pertinent because it is a study showing 30 mg of quinidine with 30 mg of dex works for
PBA.  
But I believe the more pertinent article is the one by Pope in October, 2004 which "teaches" that 10 mg of
quinidine causes significant inhibition of dextromethorphan (Avanir has said about 70% inhibition). 
Mr. Shkreli's big error seems to be that he neglected to notice or mention that Avanir's patent 7 659 282 which
was filed in January, 2005 and granted in 2010 had a provisional patent application in July, 2002. 
This provisional patent application was duly renewed 1 year later in July, 2003 as is required. 
Provisional patent applications establish a "priority date" after which disclosed advancements in the art are no
longer "prior art."  
(Just google "provisional patent applications" and read the Wikipedia definition). 
Since Avanir's priority date of the 7 659 282 patent was July, 2002, their Pope article published October, 2004
is not "prior art." 
So to the extent the identification of the lower dose of quinidine (10 mg) and lower dose of dextromethorphan
(20 mg) makes the  
7 659 282 patent more valid, the 2004 Brooks article cited by Mr. Shkreli and the more pertinent Pope article
of October, 2004 are not "prior art" and the 7 659 282 patent appears to be significantly stronger than Mr.
Shkreli says.

Without the data of the Pope, L. October, 2004 article I do not believe it would be "obvious" to one "skilled in
the art" that a formulation of only 20 mg dextromethorphan and 10 mg of quinidine twice a day would be
effective for PBA. 
The FDA did not approve the 30 mg dex/30 mg quinidine formulation and also did not approve the 30 mg
dex/10 mg quinidine formulation studied in the STAR trial. The FDA only approved the 20 mg dex/10 mg
quinidine formulation of Nuedexta. So apparently the non-obvious lower dose of dex and quinidine was pretty
important in getting FDA approval so the 7 659 282 patent that claims that doses as low as 10 mg of quinidine
will have significant effectiveness, based on the October, 2004 Pope article seems to be pretty important
intellectual property on its own.

Read the court filings, Yakatan presented findings on the the 10mg stuff in 1999 at ACCP, which predate both
articles.


"Aspects of this paper were presented as abstracts at the 28th and 31st annual meetings of the American
College of Clinical Pharmacology. Financial support provided by Avanir Pharmaceuticals"

Thanks for revisiting this. It says "aspects" were presented, so I guess we don't really know if he presented
data on the use of 10 mg quinidine. 
If he did in 1999, I guess that means he got it out in the public domain before he had patent protection. Does
that make the subsequent Avanir patent with a priority date of July, 2002 "invalid"? Apparently Avanir was still
the first and only entity to patent the lower doses.


Also, if it matters, one "skilled in the art" would not be able to predict with accuracy that the 10 mg dose, or
even the 30 mg quinidine dose, would be effective for PBA without doing the clinical studies that Avanir did
after 1999. 
Seems to me if you study combining a much lower dose of a drug than was previously used and show that it
works by doing studies, that intellectual property should belong to you alone, even if it was made public
before your patent, as long as no one else patented it before you. 
Could patent law say it was out in the public domain before the patent and others could have surmised the
dose could be effective so the patent is not valid?

They presented data at the conference in 1999, including 10mg dosage. It would be in public domain then,
hence someone skilled in the art would expect less QT since less quinidine. Imagine some claims will get
taken out , it doesnt help that 2 of their patents expired recently leaving open some holes.


Disclosure: I'm not a patent lawyer.

Chasing, from a comment I made in 2011 above, " Avanir's study published in October, 2004 by Pope showed
that 10 mg of quinidine would be likely to be effective.  
This was not obvious to one skilled in the art without the data of the October, 2004 Pope article. 
Since the 7 659 282 patent had its first provisional patent application dated July, 2002, the October, 2004
Pope article is not "prior art" with regard to that patent. 
Maybe you're right that having the 10 mg quinidine data, as well as the 25 mg data, out "in the public domain"
in 1999 makes it prior art. Also, I see there was a 1995 article by Smith et al in Neurology, 1995, 45: A330
entitled, "The treatment of affective lability with dextromethorphan" which is later described (by a group
including its main author) in an October, 2004 Neurology article (page 1365) as, "a placebo-controlled,
crossover study, concomitant administration of dex and quin to ALS patients was found to suppress
pseudobulbar affect (p<0.001 compared with placebo)." I'm guessing this 1995 study was a Phase 2 study. 
One would think, though, that a company like CNS (Center for Neurologic Study or something like that) and
Avanir would be careful to have their patents filed before putting such data out in the public domain. So hard
to believe they would devalue their main work by presenting and publishing data before getting the intellectual
property adequately protected by their July, 2002 patent.

Hard to know why certain decisions are made. They arent helped by all the patents expiring by Smith, which
they desperately tried to get extended. Even sued the PTO and tried convincing FDA it was NCE. Might be
the reason for the licensing deals (optinose & deuterium Nuedexta).

Can you add your comments about why and how the Scripts are way up for the 3rd week of June reporting after you

Also the stock has risen (by a whopping 10% after Hrs),despite Two Months of attacks by bogus congressional letters

Do you think it will be at $2 in 6 months ?

After reading and digesting all of the detailed information and DD on Martin and his past on several other boards, I
place absolutely no significance on his thesis, other than to recognize that he is apparently heavily short here and in a
painful position where he desparately needs to have the PPS of AVNR go down.

Martin. 
Sales figures are out .AVNR is not going anywhere but up despite all the fabricated negative news that caused the
dip. 
The Congressional letter is just that, a letter. 
The ANDA FDA applications are not going anywhere.AVNR will file and cause the unknown company a 30 month
delay in which time they have to spend $$$$ on trying to prove they have not infringed on the patent(s) which is
clearly not going to happen. 
The unknown company that filled will drop it and carry on with other products to persue . 
It does tell me that Nuedexta is lucrative if other companies want it though...doesn't it ?


If I was your " Client" I would be knocking on your Apartment door where your "Firm" is wanting some answers.

Dear Martin,


Given the recent script growth, if we predict a VERY conservative 5% week over week growth in total scripts written
starting from the week ending July 15th, 2011 and ending the last week of this year, this will give us a run rate total of
2087 scripts written per week by December 30th, 2011.


Are you concerned about this?


Analysts at Jeffries, Wedbush, and Canaccord all reiterated that Avanir's patents are strong. Is IP really the only thing
you are relying on here? Seems like a great risk to me.
