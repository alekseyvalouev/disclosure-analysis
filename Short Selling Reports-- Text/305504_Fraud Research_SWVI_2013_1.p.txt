Swingplane	Ventures:	An	Inflated	Stock	Promotion	Balloon	That	Will
Pop
Feb.	20,	2013	2:19	PM	ET52	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


Swingplane	Ventures,	Inc.	(OTC:SWVI)	is	currently	subject	to	one	of	the	largest	and	most
blatant	stock	promotion	campaigns	that	our	team	has	witnessed	during	the	past	year.
Recently	the	stock	has	ballooned	from	under	$0.20/share	to	nearly	$1	and	unless	a
dramatic	event	takes	place	that	alters	the	intrinsic	value	of	the	company,	it	is	only	a	matter
of	time	before	this	grossly	overvalued	$400,000,000	company	reverts	back	to	a	share
price	that	is	more	representative	of	its	fundamental	value.


We	are	dumbfounded	by	the	notion	that	any	reasonable	investor	would	want	to	own	stock
in	this	company	at	prevailing	market	prices	and	in	our	opinion	there	exists	an	extremely
lucrative	opportunity	for	short-biased	traders	to	generate	returns	in	excess	of	90%	in	less
than	one	year.	Based	on	435,000,000	common	shares	outstanding	as	of	February	1,	2013
we	believe	the	fundamental	share	value	is	currently	less	than	one	penny	and	in	time	we
expect	the	stock	to	reflect	this	value	and	trade	for	less	than	$0.01/share.


While	we	did	our	best	to	estimate	the	fair	value	of	the	company,	it	is	very	difficult	to
calculate	the	fair	valuation	of	a	stock	that	has:


Zero	revenues
Limited	operations
Less	than	$50,000	in	cash	and	cash	equivalents
A	necessity	to	raise	$12,000,000	during	the	next	twelve	months	in	order	to	move
forward	with	the	business	plan;	and
A	"going	concern"	designation	and	the	intent	to	finance	future	development	activities
largely	from	the	sale	of	public	equity	securities.


Aside	from	the	fact	that	Swingplane	Ventures	has	a	severe	lack	of	substance	as	an
operational	business	due	to	the	fact	that	they	are	an	exploration	stage	company	with	very
limited	cash,	we	have	identified	a	number	of	red	flags	that	are	so	severe	that	we	must
question	the	company's	motives	since	its	formulation.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1207501-swingplane-ventures-an-inflated-stock-promotion-balloon-that-will-pop 2/9


On	October	16,	2012,	Swingplane	Ventures	announced	that	the	company	would	issue
300,000,000	shares	to	a	Belize	entity	doing	business	as	Mid	Americas	Corp.	in	exchange
for	the	option	to	acquire	a	partial	ownership	in	a	Chilean	mining	property.


Why	is	there	a	failure	to	disclose	the	individual	that	is	associated	with	Mid	Americas
Corporation	considering	the	fact	that	they	own	an	overwhelming	majority	of	SWVI.OB's
shares	outstanding?


Matthew	Diehl


Swingplane	Ventures,	Inc.	was	incorporated	in	the	State	of	Nevada	on	June	24,	2010	with
Matthew	Diehl	acting	as	the	company's	sole	officer	and	director.


The	company's	original	business	plan	was	to	operate	as	a	men's	and	women's	golf
fashion	manufacturer	although	there	is	very	little	evidence	that	any	actual	steps	were
made	to	execute	the	business	plan.


This	apparent	lack	of	effort	raises	a	lot	of	suspicion	as	to	the	real	reasons	why	Matthew
Diehl	decided	to	take	his	company	public	and	his	checkered	past	experiences	with	public
companies	only	exacerbates	our	uncertainty	as	to	his	real	motives.


Perhaps	most	disturbing	is	the	fact	that	Tapslide	Inc.	(OTC:TSLI),	a	public	company	which
Matthew	Diehl	formerly	acted	as	COO	and	Director,	was	suspended	from	trading	on
January	19,	2012	for	a	lack	of	current	and	accurate	information.

Shortly	after	this	incident,	he	was	the	sole	officer	and	director	of	Swingplane	Ventures	and
according	to	Swingplane's	S-1	registration	statement,	the	company's	headquarters	was
listed	as	the	personal	residence	of	Matthew	Diehl	at	220	Summit	Blvd.	#402,	Broomfield
CO	80021.


One	could	imagine	how	difficult	it	would	have	been	to	operate	a	golf	attire	manufacturer	in
your	own	residential	condominium	but	adding	to	this	problem	is	the	fact	that	Matthew
Diehl	also	lived	at	this	personal	residence	while	being	actively	engaged	in	a	number	of
other	public	companies:


PaperFree	Medical	Solutions	Inc.	(OTCPK:PFMS)	is	a	public	company	that	formerly
employed	Matthew	Diehl	as	the	Chief	Executive	Officer.


As	you	can	see	from	the	stock	chart	below,	this	past	venture	that	Matthew	Diehl	was
associated	with	failed	to	execute	the	business	plan	and	currently	the	stock	trades	for
$0.0002.

Matthew	Diehl	was	also	a	former	Officer	&	Director	of	the	defunct	public	company	Kushi
Resources.

Take	note	of	the	fact	that	Matthew	Diehl	lists	Aaron	Lamkin	as	a	business	associate	that
also	appears	to	have	been	a	former	roommate	at	the	220	Summit	Blvd.	residence:


Part	II	covers	a	seedy	relationship	between	Matthew	Diehl	and	Aaron	Lamkin	in	great
detail	but	some	pertinent	information	to	know	about	Diehl's	associate	including	the	fact
that	on	November	16,	2011	he	was	barred	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission
and	can	no	longer	be	associated	by	a	registered	broker	or	dealer.


The	complaint	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	includes	some	information
about	Aaron	Lamkin's	unregistered	distribution	of	shares	in	Xpention	Genetics,	Inc.	and
HS3	Technologies,	Inc.	(OTCPK:HSTH)	whereby	he	solicited	investors	to	buy	shares	in
these	companies,	handled	their	money,	and	directed	the	transfer	of	shares.

Every	penny	stock	that	is	subject	to	a	stock	promotion	by	Awesome	Penny	Stocks
eventually	loses	well	over	90%	of	its	value	and	Swingplane	Ventures	will	be	no	different.

Below	is	a	stock	chart	that	visualizes	the	precipitous	decline	in	price	per	share	after
Awesome	Penny	Stocks	promoted	Amwest	Imaging	Inc.	(OTC:AMWI).


In	our	first	investigative	report,	the	Fraud	Research	Institute	very	accurately	predicted	an
85%	decrease	for	shares	of	USA	Graphite	Inc.	(OTC:USGT).	In	the	report	we	stated,
"whenever	an	unrelated	third	party	shareholder	foots	a	big	cash	budget	to	kick-off	an
investor	awareness	campaign,	it	should	be	an	ongoing	concern	in	the	minds	of	investors.


This	was	the	same	argument	made	in	our	report	on	Echo	Automotive	Inc.	(OTCPK:ECAU)
prior	to	its	50%	decline	and	it	is	precisely	the	argument	we	are	making	with	Swingplane
Ventures.	An	overwhelming	majority	of	promoted	stocks	decline	by	50-99%	and	therefore
situations	like	Swingplane	Ventures	present	excellent	opportunities	for	short-biased
traders	to	reap	significant	profits	since	these	promoted	stocks	are	almost	guaranteed	to
eventually	fail.

opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have
no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.

I	am	surprised	there	is	not	an	FBI	investigation	into	Diehl.	This	kind	of	ongoing	shell	company	creation/pump/delete	is
perfect	for	the	laundering	of	illegal	funds	from	other	sources,	whether	it	be	drugs	or	terrorism	funding.	If	you	consider
the	demonstrated	facts	that	the	moneys	are	coming	from	large	Central	and	South	American	"companies"	it	does	make
me	wonder.
