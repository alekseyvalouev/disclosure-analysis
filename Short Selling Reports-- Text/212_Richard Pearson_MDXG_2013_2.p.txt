MiMedx: All Signals Say 'Sell Now'
Jul. 15, 2013 7:20 AM ET15 comments
by: Richard Pearson


MiMedx Group (NASDAQ:MDXG) is a very interesting company which could potentially
have a promising future. But at the current price, there is now substantial downside risk
with very little chance for further upside.


There have been a small number of factors which pushed its share price up by 60% in
recent weeks, making its peak gains since 2012 in excess of 600%.


However, we are now seeing the convergence of several very strong and concrete sell
catalysts which could presage a drop of at least 20-30% in the near term. The recent
departure of the chairman and founder, along with his large sales of stock has already
begun to cause the shares to start dropping daily. The next leg down will likely be the
result of a massive S3 offering where other insiders will be cashing out. The total size for
the S3 is a very large at nearly 25% of the company's market cap.

MiMedx describes itself as a developer of "regenerative biomaterial products processed
from human amniotic membrane". The company collects human placentas via a donor
program from mothers delivering their babies via C sections. These mothers can opt to

donate the placenta rather than have it discarded as medical waste. The placentas are
then processed into products which can be used to aid healing in traumatic wounds and
burns.


The use of placentas in medical care has been around since the early 1900s. However, it
dropped significantly in the 1980-1990's due to concerns over hepatitis and HIV
transmission.


MiMedx now sports a fully diluted market cap of $660 million, however the company has
never generated a profit. Total annual revenues stand at just $27 million. Revenues have
been growing, but the net loss has been consistent for the past few years at around $8-12
million. As a result, the company has no retained earnings and instead has an
"accumulated deficit" of $71 million.


At its current stage of development, the company must still spend very heavily on
incremental sales and marketing spend to generate any additional revenue. As a result,
there is not much chance that MiMedx will see profitability in the foreseeable future.

From its quarterly financials, we can see the following data:


- Gross margin is high due to low cost of donated placentas


- But typically around 90% of gross profit is consumed immediately by SG&A

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1548442-mimedx-all-signals-say-sell-now 3/11


- As a result, losses continue to grow despite slightly increasing revenues


On the balance sheet side, the company runs a very "asset light" business model with
only $3 million in Property, Plant and Equipment. The current cash balance is only $5
million relative to a $2 million quarterly cash burn. Both of these factors mean that there is
virtually no cushion of safety relative to its $660 million market cap.


The company now becomes difficult to value because there are no earnings and virtually
no cash or even assets.


The stock has had a very good run this year, doubling from $3.84 to over $7.00 in June.
Part of the run has been due to the company's uplisting to the NASDAQ in April. Prior to
April, the company had been a relatively illiquid micro cap on the OTCBB. This event saw
the share price immediately pop by nearly 40% from its then price of $5.00 to over $7.00.
It is almost always the case that small OTC companies will experience a brief pop
following their uplist to the mainstream NASDAQ.


The stock also benefited from being added to the Russell 2000, 3000 and Global Indexes
on July 1st. Index rebalancing means that index tracking funds simply must buy the stock
once it is added to the index, regardless of whether or not it may be poised for a near term
decline. Once the stock was uplisted to the NASDAQ, getting it into the Russell was fairly
straightforward and was almost guaranteed to provide a boost to the share price. The
Russell indexes cover around 98% of all traded small cap stocks, so inclusion of MiMedx
was almost a certainty.


Both of these recent catalysts delivered a boost to MiMedx shares, but in both
cases they are short term boosts that were not the result of fundamental business
changes.  
There have recently emerged several very obvious "sell signals" at MiMedx.


The biggest question for shareholders to ask is "why should we keep holding as the
company and the insiders are selling millions of shares at the top ?".


First, MiMedx's charismatic and well known chairman (Steve Gorlin) just stepped down to
pursue other interests as of June 26th. His resignation came shortly after the company
was successfully uplisted to the NASDAQ. An 8K was filed, but there was no press
release communicating the resignation to the street.


Mr. Gorlin had been chairman since its inception in 2008. He has also been the influential
founder of a host of other successful biotech companies including Hycor Biomedical,
Theragenics Corp. (NYSE:TGX), CytRx Corp. (NASDAQ:CYTR), Medicis, EntreMed

(NASDAQ:ENMD), MRI Interventions (OTCQB:MRIC), DARA BioSciences (DARA), and
Medivation.


Mr. Gorlin is not just stepping down from MiMedx, he is also selling stock in large size. In
the past year, Mr. Gorlin has already sold over 1.1 million shares, including 50,000 shares
which have been sold since the uplisting. His most recent sales were completed at $6.46,
but his earlier sales from late 2012 were as low as $2.70.


When key leaders at a company decide to step down and sell their stock, it is always
worth noticing. These are presumably the individuals that know the most about a company
and the prospects for its share price. Even when they are stepping down, they always
have the option of holding on to their shares. But in this case Mr. Gorlin has been selling
heavily.


But the biggest catalyst for a potentially sharp move downwards is the filing of a massive
S3 registration statement by MiMedx which allows for the sale of $150 million in stock -
nearly one quarter of the market cap of the entire company. This statement was just filed
in July.


Two thirds of the shares to be offered will be new shares, delivering up to $100 million in
proceeds to the company. But one third of the shares (around $50 million worth) are
coming from selling stock holders who are looking to exit their position in MiMedx.


Having $50 million in stock coming from selling shareholders sends a very strong sell
signal to those who are still in the stock. Meanwhile a deal size which is around 25% of
the company's market cap is likely to cause an automatic drop of at least 20-30% once the
shelf becomes effective in the next few weeks. This would imply a price somewhere below
$5.00.


MiMedx is not a widely followed stock, with only two boutique analysts covering the
company. Neither one is from a major Wall St. research house. However, these downward
catalysts have not escaped the attention of some of the more astute shareholders. The
share price has already begun to decline in the wake of Mr. Gorlin's resignation and the
filing of the S3.


The investors who are doing the selling are no doubt asking themselves why they should
wait around as the company and insiders sell millions of shares into the market. The near
term direction of the stock is now quite predictable.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1548442-mimedx-all-signals-say-sell-now 5/11


Prior to Mr. Gorlin's resignation 3 weeks ago, the stock had hit a new high of $7.72.
Following the resignation, the stock quickly came off by around 10-15% before stabilizing.
The shares had recovered to $7.00 by July 2nd. When the S3 was filed on July 3rd, the
stock once again quickly dropped to $6.50.


The shares have continued to grind lower since that time and are now testing the $6.00
mark.


Predicting the actual offering price for the massive secondary is difficult for several
reasons. First, the stock is up 600% since 2012. New investors will clearly require a
substantial discount to ensure they are not buying at the top of a spike. Second, the size
of the offering is so large that it will be difficult to manage in terms of daily trading volume
and percentage of float. And third, given that the company still has minimal revenues, no
profits and minimal assets or cash, there is no "intrinsic floor" above which MiMedx should
trade.


As a result, an offering price of $4.50-5.00 is most likely to be the case. This represents
about a 20-30% drop from current levels. At prices below $4.00 MiMedx starts to present
an attractive buy. But at prices above $5.50, there is still clearly substantial downside. At
prices above $5.50, MiMedx is clearly either an "avoid" or a "short".


Company fundamentals - longer term prospects


Over the short term, the insider selling and the huge S3 offering will clearly control the
direction of the share price. But once that overhang is removed, MiMedx will trade
according to its fundamentals and performance. As a result, over the longer term, it is
necessary to have a better understanding of the company's products and their prospects.


MiMedx's primary technologies are AmnioFix and EpiFix in tissue repair, which together
constituted 95 % of revenues in 2012.


MiMedx went public via reverse merger in 2008, but it was only in 2011 that the company
acquired its primary tissue repair business in the form of Surgical Biologics. At the time of
the acquisition Surgical Biologics developed allografts (tissue transplants) processed from
the membrane of the amniotic sac to be used for a wide range of medical applications
including ocular surface repair, gum repair, wound care, nerve/tendon protection, spine
surgery and burn treatment among others.


Following the 2011 acquisition, the new company launched what are now the company's
key products. First MiMedix launched AmnioFix to enhance soft tissue healing. The
primary applications for AmnioFix are in surgical, sports medicine, and orthopedic

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1548442-mimedx-all-signals-say-sell-now 6/11


medicine. Shortly thereafter the company launched EpiFix, a similar product but
repurposed for enhancing wound care, especially the healing of chronic, hard to heal
wounds such as burns and diabetic foot ulcers. MiMedx believes the wound care market is
the largest opportunity. Both Products are derived from dehydrated Amnion/Chorion
membrane (dHACM) using MiMedx's proprietary purion process which produces dHACM
from donated amniotic sacs. To protect the critical IP of the Purion process, MiMedx has 5
issued patents, and over 20 pending. The key to the effectiveness of both products are the
numerous growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins in dHACM. Not only
do the company's products reduce time, but also total cost to heal a soft tissue injury.
Notably, MiMedx's products also have a five year shelf life at room temperature.


A key distinction between MiMedx and other companies with novel healthcare offerings is
that MiMedx's products have not been approved or reviewed by the FDA as they qualify
for section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. As stated by MiMedx's 10-K, if a product
qualifies for Section 361, "no FDA review for safety and effectiveness under a drug,
device, or biological product marketing application is required."


While the company has already implanted its products in many patients, it is impossible to
know the exact impact of this regulatory difference over the long term. The most notable
risk from this specialized classification is the possibility that the FDA could reclassify it.
Obviously this would be enormously detrimental to MiMedx's businesses, as the company
could potentially be forced to apply through the typical lengthy and expensive FDA
approval process. As stated in the 10-K, "We also cannot assure you that the FDA will not
impose more stringent definitions with respect to products that qualify as 361 HCT/Ps."


To qualify for section 361, a product must be minimally manipulated (from the original
tissue), intended for homologous use, manufactured with nothing except water,
crystalloids, or sterilizing/preservative agents, and not dependent on living cells for its
primary function. It appears that if the definition of homologous use were made more
stringent, MiMedx could be at risk.


MiMedx has experienced strong revenue growth as the company's products have been
adopted in various situations requiring regenerative therapy. Of 2012's $27.1 million in
total revenue, 48 % was derived from surgical and sports medicine (AmnioFix), 42 % was
derived from wound care (EpiFix), and 10 % was derived from other sources. However,
the company expects EpiFix sales to overtake AmnioFix sales. Following the departure of
founder Steve Gorlin, MiMedx is run by Chairman and CEO Pete Petite.

MiMedx is an interesting company with an interesting product. Regardless of whether
investors are selling at $5.00 or $7.00 the stock can still be considered a home run vs. its
price of just $1.00 last year.


Revenues continue to grow, but the required SG&A spend has continued to prevent
MiMedx from breaking a profit. The company has only $5 million in cash and only $3
million of Property, Plant and Equipment.


Given that the company now sports a $660 million market cap, it is easy to see why
recently departed founder Steve Gorlin and other insiders have been quick to want to sell
millions of shares at current prices.


The S3 statement sets MiMedx up to offer $150 million in stock, roughly one quarter of the
company's current market cap. As a result of the size and the large component which is
insider sales, the upcoming offering will most likely be priced below $5.00.


The insider selling and the massive S3 overhang mean that the next 20-30% of downside
in the stock is highly probable in the near term.


But at prices of $4.00-5.00, the stock could start to become an attractive buy depending
on how the business continues to build. It should be kept in mind that at prices of $4.00-
5.00 (post offering) MiMedx will be very well funded with over $100 million in cash. In
addition, the overhang from selling insiders will have been removed. Both of these
strengthen the buy argument for MiMedx at prices of $4.00-5.00.

Richard,


You make some good points in your article re: MDXG, particularly about the insider selling. Never like to see that.


You are missing a few points, however. First off, revenue growth is poised to accelerate in the back half of this year
and into 2014 as additional regional MAC reimbursement coverage is gained and as the company's sales force is

augmented.


If you created a model, you would see that there will be tremendous leverage in their model as the company scales
above $100 million.


Secondary is already being priced in and, considering that it gives new and very big investors the opportunity to get
involved with a dynamic growth story, I would be quick to cover your short, as this is not a management team to bet
against in the long-term.

Any visitor to the MiMedx website can see that there has been no change in management for years and that
the company continues to exceed revenue expectations each quarter and is being granted new patents and
achieving phenomenal results in clinical trials. This is an extraordinarily well led and well-run company.

Looking at the insider transactions you seem to have missed the many insider stock purchases. I guess your short
view makes these invisible to your eyes. When a founder resigns it is often because the new management squeezes
him out and it is natural to cash out in angar. 
This company has a very hot product which is just beginning to take off. It is reasonable to raise capital fo finance
growth to the next level. 
This is really a hit piece. I'm holding on for the big payoff which is coming as these products grow.

Also Gorlin never was CEO and has not been chairman since 2008. Petit stepped in to rescue the company and has
been chairman and CEO ever since.  
He is a serial entrepeneur with 6 companies in his belt moving on to his next startup.

MiMedx To Exceed High End Of Second Quarter Guidance


MARIETTA, Ga., July 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- MiMedx Group, Inc. (MDXG), an integrated developer, manufacturer
and marketer of patent protected regenerative biomaterials and bioimplants processed from human amniotic
membrane, announced today that the Company will slightly exceed the $13.5 million high end of its previously
communicated revenue range for second quarter of 2013.


The Company's second quarter of 2013 revenue represents an increase of greater than 175% over second quarter of
2012 revenue, and for the six months ended June 30, 2013, MiMedx revenue increased by more than 190% over its
revenue for the first six months of 2012. The Company reported that the second quarter of 2013 marks the 7th
consecutive quarter in which MiMedx has met or exceeded its revenue guidance.


The Company also increased its guidance for the lower end of its full year 2013 revenue range. MiMedx reported that
it now expects the Company's 2013 full year revenue to be in the range of $54 million to $60 million. Where revenue
falls within this range is dependent on the reimbursement approval of the three remaining Medicare Contractors.

I am Steve Gorlin, and I wish take the opportunity to respond to the ‘Seeking Alpha’ article featured by Richard
Pearson.


As a founder of several successful biotech companies, I have dedicated my life to pursuing opportunities that will
improve life and support new discoveries in the medical field.


My colleagues will agree that I am an aggressive entrepreneur with a passion for helping mankind by investing my
time, finances, and energy to every project and initiative in which I am involved.


The decision to resign from my previous position with MiMedx was based on a pattern I have followed for many years;
start-up business with a successful model and future opportunities, a board of intelligent individuals to maintain
Executive operations, while I pursue other opportunities to continue improving the way in which humankind can live.


Historically I have exited a number of companies I have founded too early. MiMedx is being run extraordinarily well
and does not require any more of my efforts. My passion is finding new technologies with unmet needs and creating a
company around them. At the moment I see new challenges which are my passion.


The ‘Seeking Alpha’ article implies that my decision to sell some of my MiMedx shares is a result of not believing in
the long-term success of this company, which is not correct. As stated previously, I am an innovator of opportunity
who not only facilitates and coordinates new biotechnology, but also acts as an investor in multiple projects as they
present themselves. I fully support and stand behind MiMedx and the positive impact its technology will have on
society and the medical industry.

I am a long term holder of MDXG and have been an investor since 
its inception. 
Those who have sold as a result of this article do not know much about their company, and will get little sympathy
from me when they 
see this stock soar in the future.

A number of your comments are incorrect:


Steve Gorlin is not the Chairman of Mimedx. In February 2009 Pete Petit was hired as Chairman and CEO. This is
stated clearly on the company's website. Steve Gorlin deserves a lot of credit for being involved in the formation of
Mimedx, but he has never been involved in day to day operations of the company.


The fact that Steve is stepping down from the MDXG board now, when the company is fairly advanced, is no different
from what Steve has done with the other companies you mentioned. He helps found companies, recruits
management, waits till the operations are humming, then steps off the board. One can confirm all this on the internet.


Regarding the S3, most s3 filings are usually much larger in size than the eventual actual offerings. The amounts
stated in the s3 are the MAXIM amounts of stock to be potentially sold, not definitive amounts. The amount sold by
the company and by insiders will probably be much lower.


You infer the company's products are still in the testing stage. Quite the opposite. Mimedx's products have been used
over 160,000 times without any adverse effects.


Re: your insinuation that the FDA might change it's exemption of MDXG's products, the company has been through 
two FDA inspections with no adverse comments. Again, this is in the last earnings call transcript.


Disclosure: long MDXG.

Richard, two points you made.


1. Mr. Gorlin had been chairman since its inception in 2008 
2. As a result, an offering price of $4.50-5.00 is most likely to be the case.


How can you write a piece for publication stating that someone is chairman when he has not been for some time? Is
that not incredibly misleading? And, on what basis have you concluded that an offering price of $4.50-$5.00 is most
likely to be the case? On what basis? This is a shelf filing. They may not do anything for months, or longer, or ever for
that matter. MDXG has no current cash needs. Has it occurred to you that their growth expectations are so big that
they believe they may need to raise cash to support future growth and just want the filing effective so they can sell
stock at some point in the future at much higher prices?

Mr. Pearson your article is incorrect! The CEO Is Parker Petit and Steve Gorlin was a Director on the Board.
<br>Which I quote from the: UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FORM 8-K “Steve
Gorlin has resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of MiMedx Group, Inc., in order to devote more time to
other interests, effective June 26, 2013.”


The SEC Form 4 still shows Gorlin has 451,857 shares of stock remaining which equates out to almost $2.5 million.
This paints a much different picture than the paint brush Mr. Pearson used when he wrote his article.
