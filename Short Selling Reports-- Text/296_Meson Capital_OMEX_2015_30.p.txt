Chatham Rock Phosphate Drops 90%: Minor Setback Or More Serious
Issue?

Summary


Odyssey undersea mining partner and investee Chatham Rock Phosphate had its
marine consent application rejected - stock has dropped over 90%.


OMEX held approximately 10mm shares of Chatham so this is an immediate
economic loss of around $3mm.


More importantly, Chatham spent far more than Oceanica on attempting to achieve
environmental approval for a similar undersea phosphate mine but was resoundingly
rejected by the regulators.


This appears to be a major setback for OMEX's undersea phosphate project
Oceanica in Mexico as it shared a similar process with Chatham including Royal
Boskalis for dredging.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) became a major shareholder in Chatham
Rock Phosphate (CRP.NZ) by providing services and partnering with them for Chatham's
New Zealand undersea phosphate mining project.


Despite undersea mining for bulk materials not being demonstrated to be economic or
practical ever before, OMEX has made this a core focus of their business to pivot away
from historic shipwrecks after legal challenges have left that business apparently
impractical.

OMEX highlighted these "off balance sheet" value creators repeatedly to investors in 2013
before our initial report challenging the accuracy of these. Above is an update. First
Neptune Minerals was written off 94% last fall after OMEX lent $500k which was not
repaid. In November 2014, Oceanica was Suspended at the Mexican environmental
regulator SEMARNAT pending OMEX answering follow up questions - shareholders are
still awaiting an update on this approximately now 80 days after the process was
suspended. And today in New Zealand, Chatham Rock Phosphate officially appears to be
dead with the Marine Consent being declined.


Chatham's stock declined by over 90% on the news and it does not appear they have the
capital to continue the business.

According to Chatham's CEO, "We had a strong level of agreement by scientific and other
experts from both sides that the environmental effects were either limited or manageable."


The CEO also noted that they spent $33mm on the project over 7 years attempting to get
environmental approval. This contrasts to an estimated $10mm at OMEX's Oceanica in
Mexico over a mere 2 years so far. Chatham appeared more credible than Oceanica in
other ways including the large dredging company Royal Boskalis as a disclosed major
shareholder and partner. OMEX has not referred to Royal Boskalis in any official specific
capacity, nor as a shareholder, only vaguely that they are "working with" Boskalis.


NZ EPA Rejection Ruling against Chatham Phosphate


However the official NZ environmental regulator felt very differently about the project.


Summary of EPA report


Press release of EPA Report


The FULL CRP Rejection Report


Summary:


1. "It concluded that mining would cause significant and permanent adverse effects on
the existing benthic environment. "


2. "The DMC found that the destructive effects of the extraction process, coupled with
the potentially significant impact of the deposition of sediment on areas adjacent to the
mining blocks and on the wider marine environment, could not be mitigated by any set
of conditions or adaptive management regime that might be reasonably imposed


3. "DMC also concluded that the economic benefit to New Zealand of the proposal
would be modest at best"


4. there were also concerns about vibrations and noise impact on the environment from
this project


5. "concluded that the application could not be approved either in part or in whole "


Relevant quotes from the full document with relevant analysis to Oceanica and similarities:


Noise is a key concern with Oceanica regarding impact on local marine animals and whale
migration, NZ decided noise is a serious concern too:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2906006-chatham-rock-phosphate-drops-90-percent-minor-setback-or-more-serious-issue 4/16


"Other risks to the environment considered by the DMC included: effects on the
trophic web (including primary production, microbes and zooplankton), fish and other
pelagic fauna, rock lobsters, paua, water quality and seabirds; the effects of mining
related noise, including on marine mammals; and the risks to biosecurity and human
health."


The issues can not be managed and would permanently destroy the ecosystem:


i. The destructive impact of the drag-head on the seabed and on the benthic fauna in
and on the


seabed was a major concern, given that:


(NYSE:A) these effects could not be avoided, remedied or mitigated


...........(NYSE:D) the habitat would not return to its present form but rather would be
transformed


wholly into soft sediment habitat.


Desktop and computer models (like what Oceanica EIA is based on) are not sufficient to
approve these projects - actual time based, expensive field studies are needed


"uncertainties stemming from the fact that this would be the first seabed mining
project ever undertaken at such depths anywhere in the world, and from the heavy
reliance placed on insufficiently validated modelling to predict the impacts of the
project


Unlike Oceanica, Chatham proposed environmental compensation, acknowledging
implicitly that marine/environmental damage would occur.


"The various proposals made by the applicant for environmental


compensation did not in the DMC's view amount to mitigation."


It appears Royal Boskalis uses tax shelter Cyprus residency for vessels, potentially
making environmental liability enforcement challenging for these unprecedented projects,
this may concern locals near one of these phosphate projects....

", Mr van Raalte stated that normally Boskalis' larger


vessels sailed under the Cyprus flag. Mr Currie suggested that Cyprus was known
as a flag of


convenience, making liability compensation potentially difficult to obtain in the event
of


unforeseen circumstances.


81


This may explain why OMEX/Oceanica have not proposed a test pilot - it was simply too
expensive for Chatham:


"As indicated above, it might have answered some of the questions raised by
submitters and


resolved some of the uncertainties if it had been possible to run a pilot mining
proposal over a


limited period in order to verify Boskalis' initial design work. Such a test pilot was not
however


deemed viable by the applicant because of the initial investment required.


86"


NZ makes it extremely challenging to appeal this project and does not present any
pathway around the rejection ruling. Note this was after years of back and forth with
opposing scientists where Chatham was able to hear and address the objections and this
is particularly interesting given that OMEX has been suspended and nonresponsive to
SEMARANT in Mexico - why would they be dragging things out?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2906006-chatham-rock-phosphate-drops-90-percent-minor-setback-or-more-serious-issue 6/16


"Since the DMC concluded after reviewing all the


evidence and testimony that the application could not be approved (on grounds
largely


independent of the mechanics of the mining operation), the DMC did not consider it
necessary


to either seek more information from the applicant or ask the applicant to undertake
further work


on the proposed conditions and adaptive management regime relating to the mining
operation


Sediment could potentially be churned up into the water and drift for 103 square
kilometers and stay in the water for decades:


"For example, the modelling predicted that sedimentation of up to 1 cm thick would
occur over a


seabed area of 35 km2 and up to 1 mm thick over an area of 103 km2"


" Professor Watling, who stated in his evidence "In addition,


the time for sediment de-watering, known as self-consolidation, seems to be very
hard to


predict, but could easily be of the order of decades. "


Chatham phosphate was too high in uranium and, if used, would pollute soil over 40-50
year time frame until unsuitable for agriculture:


" The ESR report concludes that the use of


Chatham Rise phosphorite as a direct application fertiliser would increase uranium
inputs by a


factor of eight"


New Zealand government acknowledges the risks to fishing industry:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2906006-chatham-rock-phosphate-drops-90-percent-minor-setback-or-more-serious-issue 7/16


"In the area of commercial fishing generally, risks were identified in terms of stock
reduction,


displacement, product branding and sustainability certification."


"It seemed to be generally agreed that a price of around US$ 125 per tonne would
constitute a break-even point for the proposal.


Conclusion


Shareholders of OMEX have been completely left in the dark now since November about
why the company hasn't responded to SEMARNAT. This is similar to last summer when
there were repeated promises that the Oceanica EIA would be filed "shortly" which meant
many months of delays. Now with the project "suspended pending more information" at
SEMARNAT, it begs the question: Why would OMEX delay - now 80 days?


It would seem: Either


A) The SEMARNAT questions require costly test mining and field work environmental
testing which are beyond OMEX's financial capacity


B) The SEMARNAT questions are relatively simple and just require 'desk work' - in which
case why would it take 80 days?


or C) OMEX is deliberately delaying the process for some unknown reason. Do OMEX
insiders think that as soon as SEMARNAT officially rules on the project, it could all be over
including them being out of jobs?

Would you state to people here on SA, what you mean by that statement to me in my inbox. The message I pose to
you in your inbox for SA was this! 
I know that you are better than this statement you have post on SA.  
That said whomever is giving you your info is and has been manipulating you!  
The victory is well under way and the permitting process has begun well over a month and a half ago. With the first
Prepermit being approved by MOD, and the remainder on final. OMEX does not have application, as it is up to GB
and associated interest to apply and allow OMEX to recover.  
The rest of your post states allot of assumptions as to DON DIEGO and your relationship with BCS and assumes that
they will have influence over a project that has gone all the way to President Calderons office for a national security
approval .  
You also failed to discuss the CRP and the final disposition or prospect of that project!.  
Do your people not have influence in NZ?


Your reply to me was this!


Don't worry, we're all over Chatham, it won't make it past January??????????


Everyone here should expect an answer from you! And no reply should only imply one thing.

Odyssey Update: Chatham Rock Phosphate News 
Late yesterday afternoon, Odyssey learned that the New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) rejected
the Chatham Rock Phosphate (CRP) application seeking permission to mine phosphate from the Chatham Rise off
New Zealand. The CRP deposit and the Don Diego deposit in Mexico have entirely different characteristics including
the grade and geology of the respective deposits, as well as differences in the environmental and ecological settings
of the prospective mining areas and the potential environmental impacts of the two projects are dramatically different.


Odyssey remains extremely confident in the extensive ground-breaking scientific analysis, fieldwork and conclusions
contained in the Don Diego environmental impact statement, but as Mark Gordon stated in the November conference
call, "The potential size, quality, and strategic significance of this resource . . . has drawn the interest of strategic
investors who understand the phosphate industry and the significance of this deposit to the Mexican economy." The
statement from the November call remains relevant and Odyssey expects to provide an update shortly.


The environmental impact statement analysis (EIA) in Mexico is progressing and Odyssey expects that
documentation addressing the current iteration of the review process overseen by the Mexican government's
SEMARNAT[Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources]to be filed in line with government requirements. The
Don Diego scientific team has taken exceptional care to address the questions raised by SEMARNAT and the
environmental community, and we believe that the EIA is the most comprehensive and detailed study of its kind every
completed for an ocean mineral project.


As stated, differences between the proposed Chatham Rock Phosphate and Don Diego projects exist. Key
differences include:


Water Depth: The Don Diego deposit exists at an approximate water depth of 80 meters while the CRP deposit lies up
to 250- 450 meters water depth. The decision to refuse the application cited that this project would be the first seabed
mining project undertaken at these depths anywhere in the world. The use of the proposed dredging technology in
waters up to 450 meters depth is untried; therefore management techniques proposed to minimize environmental
impacts for the Chatham project are untested.


In contrast, the depth of the Don Diego deposit means the phosphate can be extracted with existing, proven dredging
technology. Its impacts have been widely studied and carried out for many years in coastal waters, including Mexico.


Concentration of Deposit and Footprint of Operational Impact: The CRP deposit averages less than 1 meter
thickness. The Don Diego deposit averages ~3 meters thickness with many areas shown to be of greater thickness.
As such, a fraction of seabed surface area needs to be disturbed to recover the phosphate in the Don Diego as
compared to the CRP proposal. (The CRP application proposed to mine 30 km2 per year anticipating that the initial
15 years an area of 450 km2 would be mined. Over 35 years a total mined area of 1050km2 was envisioned. The Don
Diego application calls for dredging in an area smaller than 2 km2 per year.


Benthic Population: The CRP deposit is an area considered an important nursery for the fishing industry. In denying
CRP's application, the EPA stated that mining would be largely occurring in an area where the seabed is currently
protected from trawling and dredging by the Mid Chatham Rise Benthic Protection area. The CRP proposal included
areas of seabed that had been specifically set aside as conservation areas to protect the benthic communities from
extensive damage that had occurred elsewhere in the area from the use of heavy bottom gear from trawling. The EPA
also stated the project would destroy "rare and vulnerable ecosystems" including communities dominated by the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2906006-chatham-rock-phosphate-drops-90-percent-minor-setback-or-more-serious-issue 10/16


protected stony corals (a species potentially unique to the Chatham Rise) while also causing "permanent and adverse
effects" to the nearby marine ecosystem.


In contrast, extensive surveys and environmental tests of the Don Diego area show remarkably low biodiversity in the
proposed dredging zone and are not known to be a nursery ground for commercial fish species. In addition, the
ecosystem components are not unique in the region of the project as the seabed deposits at the Don Diego site do
not support any species which are not represented in greater abundance in the surrounding areas of the Bay of Ulloa.


The comparatively small seabed surface area to be dredged each year combined with the rapid re-colonization and
recovery of biologic communities in benthic settings similar to the Don Diego site indicate minimal or no permanent
impacts will result from the project. Extensive sound propagation modeling and sediment dispersion models,
demonstrate little or no anticipated impact and toxicology testing conducted with Don Diego geologic samples
demonstrated no impact to the biological community of the proposed Don Diego project site as a result of project
activities.


Economic Impact and Government: The New Zealand EPA concluded that the economic benefit to the nation from the
proposed project would be "modest at best". The economic and strategic benefit to Mexico from the Don Diego
project is significant, potentially allowing Mexico to halt foreign phosphate dependence while transforming into a
phosphate-exporting nation. The resource tonnage of CRP of ~25 million ore tonnes represents a small fraction
(<10%) of the total ore tonnage from Don Diego


It is interesting to note that the report issued by the New Zealand EPA stated that "given their highly mobile behavior,
it was unlikely they would sustain any significant direct, physiological impacts even with frequent encounters" in
reference to noise effects on ten internationally or nationally threatened marine mammals sighted in the proposed
area. It was also reported that "suspended sediment plumes of concentrations predicted are unlikely to cause impacts
on whales and that in any case, plumes could be easily avoided" and "it was unlikely collisions or harmful interaction
with a cetacean would occur."

In addition, the mis-spelled terminology in the EIS was very telling of the care the "Don Diego scientific team"
applies to research.


IF the "scientific team" had done such a great job, why was there even a need for a request for information,
and why has the response to the request taken over 80 days?


One would also note that "Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental" translates to Environmental Impact

>>Mosaic Interested in Phosphate Investments in S. America<<


Well Taylor Swift is coming to my city for a concert so she must be coming to bring me muffins, right?


What's more likely, that they will continue to invest in world class deposits like the Bayovar region in which
they are already invested and partnered with companies like Vale and Mitsu, or muck around with Omex's
science project in the waters off Mexico.





11 Feb 2015, 05:59 PM


bulldog2014
Keubiko,


Of course it's too early for a Mosaic to get involved with Oceanica; not before an environmental approval. But,
besides Bayovar, which they own a third, what other world class deposits in Latin America can they invest in?


From Mosaic's conference call yesterday:


"Some years out there could be a Ma'aden phase three, but we are going to continue to look for opportunities
to be a bigger player in phosphate production and ideally to broaden our geographic presence. Latin America
is an excellent -- is one of the fastest growing agricultural regions in the world. If there was some way to get
into the phosphate business in Latin America we'd be interested in doing that."


Perhaps you could drop Jim Prokopanko a note with your thoughts.


Btw, Taylor Swift…interesting choice…

26922203
That makes no sense at all. Why is it too early? 
A mining entity understands an assay, it understands costs, and it understands value. 
Odyssey has touted the assay for years, even before they purchased the adjacent mining leases. If the assay
and costs were of value, why didn't any mining companies in the region purchase the adjacent areas? 
After all of the marketing efforts, why haven't any mining companies invested in Oceanica?


Drop someone a note about Oceanica, do you really feel that the mining interests in phosphate have no idea
of the 'value' of Oceanica? You have a better chance of Taylor Swift bringing you muffins.


For cash, what would a dilution at 68 cents bring? They only have about 65 million shares left to play with.
The stock was tested at 56 cents today. 
Good luck.


12 Feb 2015, 08:21 AM

269,


Mosaic invested in Bayovar two years after they began construction of the mine, which was after
environmental approval. "Odyssey has touted the assay for years." If "years" you mean two , then yes. Since
you only recently understood what phosphoric rock was (after you got over your portable generator idea) no
one expects you to come up with anything that makes sense regarding…anything. Most projects started by
juniors don't get a major to invest in until permits are in place or unless they give up a major chunk of the
business and major dilution. 
Oceanica has been around for only two years.


12 Feb 2015, 08:48 AM


26922203
What are you talking about? I have always understood the mineral and the mining process, and portable
generators?


You are completely wrong with your projects statement as well. A simple look at Nautilus, or even CRP,
shows mining company partners and investment.  
Oceanica has no such partners nor investment.


The adjacent lease areas were available, while the Odyssey roadshow was going around looking for investors
and touting the assay results.


Mining ventures in Mexico or worldwide did not invest, nor did they even lease the adjacent areas on
speculation.


Odyssey is keeps talking about all of the interested parties, and talking, and talking.


Weren't they supposed to have a permit by now, instead of trying to answer a list of questions? How are they
paying for the research work?

Anglo invested in Nautilus after they were a public company (i.e. several years after they- Nautilus- were

CRP went public in 2006: Boskalis took a 20% stake in 2013.


Oceanica has been in existence for about 2 years. They raised enough money to conduct tests, get a NI 43-
101 report, and conduct an extensive EIA. Yes, going forward, they will need a partner post approval, to carry
on.


So what part of the timeline is so difficult to grasp with the above?

Oh, and Metalloinvest (Russian billionaire Usmanov) took a stake in Nautilus in 2008..again, several years
into Nautilus's existence, not right off the bat.

Did Boskalis "take a stake" in CRP the same way that Odyssey got their 6% stake in CRP, in lieu of payment?


Odyssey cant let their share of Oceanica diminish in lieu of payments, because they would lose consolidation,
and the books wold be opened?


OMEX is publicly traded, have any mining companies invested or accumulating the parent company?


You also left out the obvious, mining companies in Mexico and worldwide, had the opportunity to take the
adjacent lease areas, it looked like odyssey was begging them to they way they presented to attempt to
bolster the alleged valuation, yet none did.

I hate to break this to you, and while not many understand why, Odyssey is a publicly traded company.

Between the Mosaic CEO on their cc, and Odyssey's letter to shareholders this morning regarding strategic partners,
doesn't it feel like pressing $0.70 is like picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer? Congrats on walking the stock
down from $3 in 14 months. That works out to $0.05 per article give or take.

5/21/2018 Chatham Rock Phosphate Drops 90%: Minor Setback Or More Serious Issue? - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMEX) | S…

Odyssey has been touting strategic partners in Oceanica for 2 years. Boskalis will be one, when you pay them $350M
for the dredge.


Mosaic has been purchasing mines and facilities for years in Latin and South America. Notice they stated production,
has Odyssey ever mentioned they have buyers lined up for the concentrate? Any production facilities lined up?


Rofomex just permitted a huge resource on the Baja peninsula, and there are plenty more quality land based
resources.


In the press release, which was far more damage control than anything, (the shareprice hit 56 cents) Odyssey
mentions they will resubmit the response under government timeframes. The project has been suspended, there is no
timeframe for resubmittal.

woody,


There are 10 documents, so the best place is the SEC filing.

In addition, SEMARNAT has filed an extension. It does not state how long the extension is for, but the typical 60 days
puts it around mid June.
