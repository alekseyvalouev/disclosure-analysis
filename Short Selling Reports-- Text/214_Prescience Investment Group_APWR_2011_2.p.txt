Clouds Thicken Over A-Power Energy Generation Systems
Nov. 9, 2011 8:17 AM ET25 comments
by: Prescience Investment Group


A-Power Energy Generation Systems (“APWR” or “the company”) is a U.S.-listed Chinese
company with accounting and audit-related issues. We originally published our research
findings pertaining to APWR on Friday, June 17. The analysis can be found here. The
company has yet to file its 2010 audited financial statements and is currently under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


As a cautious investment manager, we have gone to great lengths to verify A-Power’s
claims made in SEC filings and in press releases. Although our investigation is ongoing,
the data we have gathered up to this point has cast serious doubt over management’s
reporting of A-Power’s financial condition. Our evidence, discussed in this and our initial
report, includes the following:


Several events have transpired since we originally published our research that can be
interpreted as glaring red flags. These events include director and auditor resignations,
a halt in trading by the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, and the opening of an investigation
by the SEC regarding APWR potentially having violated federal securities laws.
APWR has a history of internal weaknesses over financial controls, which has resulted
in an adverse opinion from A-Power’s (now-resigned) independent auditor. A-Power’s
recently resigned auditor issued an adverse opinion in the 2009 audit and APWR has
yet to publish its 2010 audited financial statements.
APWR discloses a number of “Related Party Balances” in which APWR is both lending
money to and borrowing money from related individuals and businesses. However,
management does not adequately discuss the actual transactions occurring between
APWR and these related businesses. The relationship between APWR and its related
parties is one that will undoubtedly require SEC scrutiny and could possibly result in
material financial restatements.
Our attempts to locate and/or contact distributed generation facilities mentioned on A-
Power’s website and in recent press releases have failed. Our investigation team in
China has prepared a report for us in which 39 companies out of 39 companies on our
list have either not been locatable, or refused to answer even a preliminary set of
questions. Our spreadsheet includes addresses, phone numbers, Chinese and English
names, websites, and some other information we have put together. We also searched

for evidence of distributed generation facilities on Google Maps and found many
vacant lots (although data is sometimes outdated).


GLARING RED FLAGS


Several material events have transpired since we originally published our analysis that
can be interpreted as glaring red flags, validating our initial concerns:


The same day our initial analysis was published (June 17), APWR board member
Robert Leckie resigned “as a result of concerns that his views on process and best
practices were not necessarily shared throughout the Company”.
On the following trading day, Monday, June 20, APWR issued a ‘pre-response’ to our
analysis, stating that it was reviewing the issues raised in our article and that it
intended to provide answers ‘by way of a press release as soon as possible’. It has yet
to do so.
One week later, APWR’s auditor (MSCM LLC) resigned, announcing that it had
refused to sign off on the company’s financial position, and the NASDAQ stock
exchange halted all trading in APWR stock.
On Tuesday, June 28, another 2 independent directors resigned.
On Tuesday, July 5, APWR announced that its CFO Peter Mak would be stepping
down. (More recently, Mak stepped down as head of the audit committee of Trina Solar
Ltd. (NYSE:TSL), purportedly a result of his ties with A-Power.)
On Tuesday, August 18, APWR issued a press release entitled “A-Power Receives
SEC Subpoena,” announcing it is currently under investigation by the SEC. The SEC
is investigating whether the “Company or any of its personnel violated federal
securities laws.”


More recent decisions from the company indicate little intent of regaining investor
confidence.


DEAR AUDITOR – A WORD OF CAUTION


On Tuesday, September 20, APWR issued the following press release: A-Power Appoints
BDO Daejoo as its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The announcement
contained the following statement.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/306515-clouds-thicken-over-a-power-energy-generation-systems 3/11


…the Audit Committee of A-Power's Board of Directors has approved the
engagement of BDO Daejoo LLC as its new independent registered public
accounting firm and has specifically engaged BDO Daejoo LLC to audit the
Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010. The
appointment was made on September 16, 2011, effective September 15, 2011.


BDO Daejoo LLC is currently registered with the Public Company Accounting
and Oversight Board.


The engagement by the Company of BDO Daejoo LLC follows the resignation
of the Company's former independent registered public accounting firm, MSCM
LLP, effective June 26, 2011. As previously reported, MSCM LLP stated that it
had resigned because the Company had not retained a qualified independent
forensic accounting firm to evaluate certain business transactions that MSCM
stated was necessary for MSCM to complete its audit of the Company's
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 on a timely basis.


Strangely however, two weeks later on October 4, APWR announced that BDO Daejoo
rescinded its acceptance and engagement to serve as A-Power’s independent auditor. As
a replacement, A-Power appointed Simon & Edward, LLP as its Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm.


A-Power last reported a net cash position of $111.5 million. In 2009, it paid its recently
resigned auditor MSCM LLP a whopping CDN$581,275: It can afford to hire a top-tier
auditing firm with a strong, well-established reputation. Especially during this time of
severed trust and regulator scrutiny, hiring a Top-4 auditor -- or even a Top-100 for that
matter -- would seem the optimal deployment of cash on hand and a worthwhile
investment in restoring the trust of the investment community.


Instead, it hired Simon & Edward LLP. According to the APWR press release,


The selection of Simon & Edward, LLP was based on the firm's extensive
experience auditing public companies in the United States and China. The firm
is a U.S. based accounting firm with its offices in City of Industry, California and
Beijing, China. The firm's partners include individuals with significant
experience with S.E.C. reporting requirements and S.E.C. audits.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/306515-clouds-thicken-over-a-power-energy-generation-systems 4/11


Simon & Edward is not a Top-100 firm. As a matter of fact, according to its most recent
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection, it appears to be a tiny
firm with 3 partners and 5 issuer audit clients. Notably, Simon & Edward seems to be
making a late, ill-fated plunge into the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO space. In the past few
months, it has engaged other issuer clients that have been accused of hoodwinking U.S.
investors.


On April 6, 2011, Chinese RTO China Agritech (OTCPK:CAGC) announced it had hired
Simon & Edward LLP. LM Research has accused CAGC of being a scam set up to make
fraudulent transfers of wealth from the pockets of outside investors into those of inside
management. LM Research’s findings indicate the company’s reported facilities were non-
operational and that reported clients denied having a business relationship with CAGC.
Like A-Power, CAGC has yet to file its 2010 audited financial statements with the SEC.
Trading in CAGC common stock was halted by the NASDAQ on March 14, 2011. The
company was delisted by the NASDAQ on May 20, 2011. As of the writing of this report,
CAGC stock is down 93.7% in 2011.


It is no wonder that CAGC has made a mockery of the auditor institution, with Simon &
Edward LLP being its third in only a 2 year timeframe. But it is baffling that Simon &
Edward LLP is willing to take on such reputational risk.


On July 13, 2011, Chinese RTO China Green Material (OTC:CAGM) announced that it
had hired Simon & Edward LLP. For the sake of brevity, we’ll point out that CAGM has had
recent turnover in its CFO position, and has had 4 auditors since its reverse merger on
February 9, 2007. As of the writing of this report, CAGM stock is down 84% in 2011.


There is growing caution amongst auditors resulting from a renewed focus by the SEC on
the auditors of Chinese companies. We encourage A-Power’s auditor Simon & Edward
LLP to navigate with caution, and to carefully weigh what evidence they’ve collected that
would indicate that APWR is accurately reflecting its financial position.


‘WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS AGAIN?'


With help from our investigators in China, we were able to put together a list of A-Power’s
recent distributed generation clients in China. Part of this list came directly from APWR’s
website: When we began researching the company several months ago, both the Chinese
and English versions of the site offered a list of completed projects. Interestingly, APWR
appears to have removed the list from its site.

Fortunately we took snapshots of the old website. Here are a few: Changchun
Biochemistry Group Co., Ltd., Wuhan Iron and Steel, Wanshunda Starch Co., Ltd.


It had appeared to us that the list on the unaltered website had not been updated in recent
years. To supplement it, we also looked back at the press releases announcing project
wins since January 2010. Our final list contains 40 entries:


With this list in hand, we hired a reputable and independent third-party due-diligence
investigation team in China to contact as many of these organizations as possible. This
team is staffed with both American and Chinese citizens, and has been working in China
for over a decade. A spreadsheet of our investigator’s findings can be found here. To
summarize, only a handful of these customers were reachable, or even locatable in any
way. The few we were able to locate were unwilling to speak. Some of these companies
had websites which appeared “fake” to our investigators. Many had a locatable address
with no signs of construction or distributed generation facilities at the expected locations,
and many companies had no locatable address using common internet mapping software.

Comments (25)


We suspect that in the best-case scenario, press releases were issued prematurely and
proposed projects never made it to the development stage. In the worst-case scenario,
management wholly fabricated these projects.


CONCLUSION


We hope that investors who own shares in APWR and those considering buying shares at
what appears to be a fundamentally low valuation familiarize themselves with the risks
we've addressed in our initial report and in this update. We also hope that the NASDAQ
and Simon & Edward LLP follow the lead of the SEC in taking necessary precautions in
protecting investors. We encourage Simon & Edward LLP to make an effort to contact A-
Power’s distributed generation clients, both past and present, in order to determine if
management’s revenue and earnings statements can be relied upon. We hope that we
can help protect both U.S. shareholders and Simon & Edward LLP's reputation as an
independent auditor committed to the principles set forth by the PCAOB.


Disclosure: I am short APWR.

And don't forget to mention, protect your own pocket. Sounds to me like you need a new team of global investigators.
Why is it always the standard to play ignorant. The SEC needs to investigate this author to see if his firm actually
does have a team of investigators or if he's merely another short seller willing to dish out anything one cannot confirm
to benefit his own portfolio. If this author is still short after the last drop then i would say, his advise is not very good. A
smart investor would have covered at .30. I find it odd that this author releases articles with basically no proof but
merely assumes if he can't find it, it doesn't exist. These shorts are the problems with the markets today and they
need to be addressed by the SEC and more indictments need to be handed to authors like this one to set a
precedence. Until actual proof is brought forward showing any sign of any wrongdoing we have to assume all is well,
especially after the NASDAQ themselves are backstepping from delisting them. Most Chinese firms that went public
were forced to use auditors as part of the package to become public here in the US. Firms that helped these
companies go public made suggestions and wrote the paperwork and assigned the auditor to these companies. Of
course we are now finding out, most of those firms were not qualified to handle these businesses. Same goes with the
PR firms that were pushed on them as well. In the end, the best advice is to never take advice from someone who
openly and publicly bashes a company and is an admitted short.

Credible Investor Peter Siris of Guerrilla Capital stated on CNBC that he does not invest in companies who will not
allow him and his team to view the business yet APWR is one of his largest long holdings in China. Guerrilla Capital is
actually a global and reputable company and have taken short positions in Chinese companies who will not allow his
team to investigate their facilities and projects. I take a long position because reputable firms and reputable investors
do. Please view all the links posted in the previous article written by this author that i have posted and you will start to
get a clearer picture as to what these shorts are up to.

Shorting a penny stock on the pink sheets is about as risky as it gets, in my opinion. Even if you shorted APWR at
.88, the most you can make is .88/share, but the risk of a price jump is much greater than making any reasonable
amount of money on the short side. On a rumor and a whim the price of APWR could easily go back to its pre-
delisting price of 1.67, and you lose .79/share as a short, or about the maximum you would make if APWR goes to
zero. Now say some tangible good news comes out and it gets in the 3 to 4.00 range per share. If you shorted any
kind of quantity to make money on the downside you just lost over 3 times the maximum gain potential from shorting.
This makes no sense in penny stocks as movement is so chaotic. I couldn't sleep at night with a short position on a
penny stock. The author may be trying to just get some relief to cover his position.


I don't advocate APWR either way, this is a general investment opinion of mine about penny stocks. Shorting penny
stocks has a very limited gain potential and the risk of loss could be 3 to 4 times the MAXIMUM potential gain if

enough is enough this company is misleading everyone. Investor relations do not exist among its many negatives. I
hope they are spending my money wisely. Advice is to never ever invest in a chinese stock again. Nasdaq is their
personal Automated Bank Machine.

Tetra...I understand your attitude but this is a stock you need to play into. Listening to all these gloom and
doom writers who are short these companies is not the way to go. For them, it takes a fair amount of
investors who are gullible enough to believe whatever they print as gospel. Play the opposite strategy and
work the back end as the stock regains a foothold. Averaging down at these levels is where its at right now.

Shorting a penny stock is not a risk/reward move I'd ever make. First off the lowest it can go is zero. So okay, I short
100,000 shares at .70, potential earnings 70,000. So what if other market forces, true or untrue, move the stock up, it
could easily get to 1.67 (pre de-listing price) on a whim and a rumor. With 100,000 shares shorted, one would lose
97,000. At that is something that could happen in the blink of an eye.

After seeing the gross numerical mistakes this author made in his first attack article on ABAT earlier this year, I will not
bother reading his dribble on APWR which is simply another gangster style attack to help him cover his ill conceived
short position. It is people like him and those he is writing for that the SEC needs to investigate for fraud!

Again, here is the Shenyang Lucky Wind Facility from a satelite image. It was simple to find and im guessing would
equate to at least $1 to $2 a share on its own. Its an apparent working facility as five complete turbine sets sit in plain

The author of this article has again missed the boat all together. A large portion of his attack here was on the
Appointment of Simon and Edwards LLC as APWR's auditor. The author claims Simon and Edwards is not even a top
100 auditor when in fact they are part of none other than BDO International which is still a top 5 according to their
website and the PCAOB. I'll show you what this author will not because i do not profit from lies, take a look for
yourself http://www.secpa.us I also recently drove to Spinning Star's address posted on its website and in fact it was a
working office and not far from the Authors home base in Louisiana. He didn't even have to go all the way to China to
find business but merely down the road a bit to Austin. Oh yeah, and the doors are open. My point isn't to bash the
author, but merely to point out the plethora of inaccuracies in which this short seller has set forth as truth yet is far
from it. From what i can gather, APWR has merely moved from one BDO subsidiary to another. Apparently the illegal
and misuse of information, by authors such as this one, Alfred Little, and GEO INVESTING, to steal from long term
investors and capture short term profits for themselves and their constitutes has been the reasoning behind Simon
and Edwards launch into BDO International's legacy. Lets see if they can stave off assaults from these criminals. I'm
sure with minimal effort i can find 10 more mistakes from this and the aforementioned authors. My only hope is they
will soon be trapped shorts by Smart Money like Guerilla Caiptal so they can see what its like to be on the receiving
end of a long attack.

Connor, you've pumped this thing from 21 to 33 cents, and apparently stuck your head in the sand as every
reverse merger scam was exposed for exactly that. APWR is just another domino in a very organized plan to
defraud US investors. Sorry if you are too dumb to see that, or if you have a financial motive in not seeing it.

I also pumped this thing from $3 to $21. The company has a viable business. Whats your point. If you are a

Okay, good first thing is to admit you are just here to pump apwr. Now next why not admit that the journey
from 3-21 was on the backs of lies and misrepresentations? Hey, they did a great job at it even getting into a

incentive.

How does that work. Shorts are proven to pay posters. Never heard of a paid pumper. I'm also assuming that
anyone who has averaged down on this stock is a pumper because they own the stock. I just have seen
nothing from any basher that has ever shed any light on the "Fraud" or "Scam" thats supposedly going on
here. I'm assuming we should also all run from energy traders and banks and just about everything else that
has ever had a hint of fraud in it. Gimme a break. Watch and learn. This is where a smart investor averages
down. At this point, i need $2 to see profits. We will see much higher than that long term.

going on here."


Really? You haven't seen board member and auditor resignations, immediately followed by the receipt of an SEC
subpeona and the opening of a formal investigation into whether the company and its managers violated federal
securities laws? http://prn.to/vpZFuV


You are being paid by this company to pump this stock and you should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to
revive this fraud on which the market has already rendered judgment. You are a part of this scam, Connorport, and
that is obvious.

Only bashers (and probably a paid basher or short) would post such senseless nonsense, and leave out this
part of the article you sited to try and make it look like ABAT is a known fraud, when it is not a known fraud.
That article you so proudly posted also quotes the SEC saying:


"The SEC has informed the Company that the investigation should not be construed as an indication that any
violations of law have occurred."


In the USA, one is not guilty until proven guilty in a court of law. And so far they have not even been formally
accused of any violations of law by the SEC, much less been convicted of any. And "Investigation" is nothing
more than an investigation.
