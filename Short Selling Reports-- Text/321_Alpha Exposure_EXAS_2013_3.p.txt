Exact Sciences - Line Your Pockets, Not Your Toilet Bowl (3 Of 5)
Jul. 26, 2013 10:58 AM ET55 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Today, in part three of our five part series, we are going to continue to explain why we
believe that Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) is worth under $3 per share and that the
stock should be aggressively sold or shorted. As a reminder, in part one (here), we
illustrated why the Cologuard test is actually less effective than the Fecal Immunochemical
Test (FIT) and is therefore unlikely to receive FDA approval. In part two (here), we took
this a step further, and explained why Cologuard is not only worse, but also not
economically sensible, and therefore would be unlikely to be reimbursed by CMS or
insurers.


In part three, we will show why we believe the addressable market for Cologuard is very
limited. While Exact Sciences wants investors to think Cologuard's market potential is
vast, the patient population is likely to be small, and we believe very few doctors will
actually prescribe Cologuard, due to likely patient compliance issues and problems with
the test's efficacy. To explain this, we will explain the standard of care for Cologuard's
target market, adults over age 50. We will then give a graphic description of the
application of the Cologuard test and compare it to that of the InSure FIT.


The Addressable Market Is Much Smaller Than People Think


Adoption of the Cologuard test will depend on doctor's choosing Cologuard. Since
Cologuard requires a full stool sample, it will most likely be given to patients as a take-
home test. We believe this inherent feature significantly shrinks the addressable patient
population for Cologuard. The vast majority of the female and older male populations may
be screened without a take-home test such as Cologuard. As a result, the primary
addressable market for Cologuard is the younger male population, which is a small
market. Exact Sciences grossly exaggerates the total addressable market (TAM) for
Cologuard.


While colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women,
excluding skin cancers, it can be regularly screened for in the doctor's office. This reduces
the need for a take-home test such as Cologuard. Colorectal cancer is primarily seen in
people after the age of 50, and more than 9 out of 10 people with colorectal cancer are at
least 50 years old. Men, starting at age 50, are recommended to begin screening for
prostate cancer, which is the most common cancer in men, other than skin cancer. As part

of this screen, it is recommended that a Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) be performed
during routine annual check-ups, as explained here. A DRE, as explained here, is an
examination of the lower rectum in which a doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into
the anus. DREs are also performed to collect stool for sampling, which allows the doctor
to perform the FIT or FOBT, as seen here and here. Even FOBTs, as reported here, can
reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer by up to 30% if taken regularly. Women
are not spared DREs as they are part of a pelvic exam, which as explained here, start at
age 21 and are recommended to be repeated annually through age 70.


Therefore, if a doctor thinks a colorectal screening test is warranted, the doctor can
perform a FIT or FOBT as part of an annual check-up or gastroenterologist appointment
for men, or as part of an annual gynecologic examination for women using the fecal matter
that is left on the doctor's glove during a DRE. This way, a doctor can ensure 100%
compliance with an FIT as part of both men's and women's already recommended annual
check-ups. While these in-office tests may not be as powerful as the take home versions,
and should be taken in conjunction with other colon cancer screens, the fact that the
doctor can ensure 100% compliance every year is very important and impossible to match
with a take-home colon cancer screen. Simply put, if a patient is unwilling to undergo this
screen while at the doctor's office as part of another regularly scheduled procedure, we
feel that he or she is very unlikely to administer it to him or herself at home.


Further, by giving the tests themselves, doctors can eliminate the potential for patient error
that exists with a take-home test. Lastly, these tests are done annually, so they benefit
from the cumulative effect of multiple years of testing, as explained in our first article.


Since men older than 50 can receive screens during DREs and women get them during
annual gynecologic examinations starting at the age of 21, we believe that the only
untapped market for a take-home colon cancer screen consists of men 30-49 years
of age, or only about 41 million people per the U.S. Census Bureau. This is a far cry
from the 100 million average and high risk patients that Exact claims make up the
potential U.S. market for its test. Furthermore, men in the 30-49 age group have very low
risk of developing colon cancer, and it is unclear that they should even be tested on a
regular basis. Because DREs are invasive and because this demographic is at low risk for
cancer, doctors usually avoid performing DREs in men age 30-49. It is in this age group,
that a doctor, who wants to perform a colon cancer screen, will choose a take-home test
such as Cologuard.

What is the potential size of this market? According to the National Cancer Institute (here),
4.82% of men and women born today will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon and
rectum at some time during their lifetime. A male younger than 50 is only recommended to
receive colorectal screening tests if he is at high-risk with a family history of colorectal
cancer. 36.1% of colorectal cases are found in men and women over the age of 75, which
means that by the time he or she gets colon cancer, his or her children are likely older
than 50 years old. This means that the probability of a person getting colon cancer before
the age of 75 is actually 3.08% (i.e. 4.82% x 63.9%), which means that 6.07% of men
younger than 50 have a mother or father who has/had colorectal cancer and are therefore
at high risk.


The math is 1 - [(1 - 3.08%)^2] = 6.07%.


Of a population of 41 million men 30-49 years of age, 2.5 million of them (i.e. 41 million x
6.07%) are at high risk of colorectal cancer. Compliance within colorectal cancer is
notoriously low. As an example, of the 100 million average and high risk patients in the
US, only 12 million FOBTs and FITs are actually sent to the lab, or just 12%. Since men
30-49 years of age are overall at low risk of colorectal cancer, we believe an even lower
percentage of them are likely to get screened with an FOBT or FIT. The true market is
likely to be around 100,000 men who receive FOBT or FIT tests, which is a tiny number.
Even if Cologuard captures 50% of this market, that's only 50,000 tests or $20 million in
revenues per year at a $400 price point. The current market cap of Exact Sciences is
$840 million.


We believe even 50% market share is too high of an estimate due to the compliance
difficulties Cologuard is likely to face, which we address next.


Compliance Is A Big Challenge


In the unlikely event that a doctor recommends a take-home colon cancer screen to one of
his or her patients, we believe that the choice of the test will depend on the expected
compliance with the test (i.e. the chance that the patient actually follows through and



http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1575652-exact-sciences-line-your-pockets-not-your-toilet-bowl-3-of-5 4/25


administers the test to him or herself) and the expected quality of the test.


Compliance is significantly more important than the quality because the test itself
becomes completely irrelevant if the patient doesn't actually take the test. We believe that
compliance is directly related to the simplicity of the test and inversely related to the
amount of feces that a person is forced to handle. The grosser the test, the less likely
patients will actually do it. Quality is also important because doctors want the test not only
to catch as many true positives as possible, but also to flag as few false positives as
possible in order to avoid unnecessary colonoscopies.


Let's first compare the expected compliance of the two tests.


A picture of the Cologuard test can be seen on slide 13 (below) of the June 2013
presentation, found here.


The Cologuard test works as follows:


First, a patient must obtain a sample of his or her own excrement. Just like taking a urine
test, he or she must defecate into a container inside the toilet bowl. The patient then
collects a sample of the stool from the bucket and inserts it into a small vial that comes
with the test. Next, a preservative is poured over the remaining excrement in the bucket
and the lid is screwed on. Finally the patient puts both the vial and bucket either in the
mail or physically delivers them to a local lab. The lab then tests the stool samples for
abnormal DNA. If the test comes back positive, the patient then schedules a colonoscopy
to have any cancerous or precancerous polyps removed. As we previously showed, about

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1575652-exact-sciences-line-your-pockets-not-your-toilet-bowl-3-of-5 5/25


76% of these positive readings will actually be false positives and will result in
unnecessary colonoscopies. If the test comes back negative, the Company recommends
that the patient repeat this test every three years.


Now that we have an overview of the test, let's take it step by step. When the patient has
the urge to defecate, he or she gets the Cologuard test, opens it, and finds this clear
plastic bucket holder:


The patient places the holder over the bowl. This is the piece that the patient will be
aiming through. Now that the appliance above is secured over the toilet, he or she
suspends the bucket in the middle of the holder:


This is the bucket where the feces will end up. It is about the size of a large ice cream
container.


The patient then has to defecate into the bucket suspended over the toilet.


Once defecation is complete, the patient needs to get up and grab the vial. The patient
unscrews the top to find a small spoon, similar to a tube of mascara.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/7/24/959452-13746936999059298-Alpha-Exposure_origin.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1575652-exact-sciences-line-your-pockets-not-your-toilet-bowl-3-of-5 6/25


Then, the patient needs to reach into the bucket and use the spoon to extract a sample
from the stool. Remember that because the liner holding the can is still presumably lying
across the top of the bowl, the patient will be unable to wipe for the duration of the
procedure since it is in the way. The patient can remove the entire assembly and put it
either on the floor or in the sink; however, remember that it has been sitting in toilet water
and is likely to drip.


After obtaining the sample and placing it into the vial and screwing on the top, the patient
needs to pour the bottle of preservative shown below over the stool in the bucket. The
patient then has to screw on the lid to the bucket.


Finally, the patient needs to put both the sample in the vial and the larger stool sample in
the bucket into a box, tape it and secure it, and then mail it to a lab for examination.


The InSure FIT Is Much Easier


How does this compare to the InSure FIT, the leading take-home colorectal screening
test? A picture of the test itself is below. While more details about the actual process can
be found here, the basics are fairly simple. Subjects of the InSure FIT simply brush the
surface of their stool as it lies in the toilet bowl. The brush is then applied to a test card so
that the water sample retained within the brush bristles is deposited on the card. This is
then repeated for sample B. Then, just as a patient would need to do with the Cologuard
test, the Insure FIT needs to be mailed to a lab for review. At no point does the patient
have to handle his or her own stool, which is a point that the test highlights, as can be
seen here. While the InSure FIT is not without some inconvenience for the patient, it is
clearly a much easier test to administer, even on an annual basis.

Given what you know about the tests, if you are a doctor and compliance is a real issue,
which test would you choose? Given our belief that compliance is directly related to the
simplicity of the test and inversely related to the amount of feces that subject is forced to
handle, we think that it is clear that patients will be more likely to complete the InSure FIT
than the Cologuard test. In addition, the simplicity of the InSure FIT is likely to result in
fewer patient errors than with Cologuard. In our view, Cologuard's likely worse compliance
and greater number of patient errors relative to competing tests will impede its adoption.


Normalizing for Compliance Makes InSure Fit Even Better


Now let's compare the quality of the two tests:


Because of the compounded efficacy of FITs in general, and the even further compounded
efficacy of the InSure FIT due to it being a 2-sample test, the results are stunningly
obvious. Over the course of three years (the fair amount of time to compare the two tests
based on their designs), in a sample of 10,000 patients, the InSure FIT would be expected
to correctly identify more cancerous polyps (64 vs. 59) and more precancerous polyps
(610 vs. 316) than the Cologuard test. The InSure FIT would also be expected to miss
fewer true positives (142 vs. 441) and cause fewer unnecessary colonoscopies for healthy
patients (879 vs. 1,194).


Over the course of any single year (a comparison that is severely skewed in favor of the
Cologuard test, yet still looks better for the InSure FIT), Cologuard would be expected to
correctly identify more cancerous polyps (59 vs. 56). However, it will have more misses
(441 vs. 440). Having said that, the InSure FIT would be expected to correctly identify
more precancerous polyps (320 vs. 316), and would save 882 healthy patients from
getting unnecessary colonoscopies (312 vs. 1,194). The reason for this final eye-popping
5/18/2018 Exact Sciences - Line Your Pockets, Not Your Toilet Bowl (3 Of 5) - EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1575652-exact-sciences-line-your-pockets-not-your-toilet-bowl-3-of-5 8/25


number is the expected difference of false positives detected, determined by the
difference in the specificity of the InSure FIT (97%) and the Cologuard test (87%).
Accordingly, a colonoscopy resulting from InSure FIT has a 45% chance of being
unneeded, while a colonoscopy resulting from Cologuard has a 76% chance of being
unneeded. Based on these facts, we think that it is clear that a doctor would recommend
the InSure FIT over Cologuard.


In addition to the fact that the InSure FIT is not only the easier test to comply with, but also
the much better test over three years, we are now going to show that even if a patient is
only compliant in only two out of the three years, that its results under every reasonable
testing metric are still superior:


As can clearly be seen, even when the efficacy is only compounded over two years for the
InSure FIT, it is still the far superior test:


InSure FIT correctly finds 63 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds only 59
InSure FIT correctly finds 504 pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
InSure FIT only misses 249 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses
441
InSure FIT results in 614 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


Hence, InSure FIT can have just 67% patient compliance (2 of 3 years in which it is
recommended) and still be better than Cologuard with 100% patient compliance.


Let's Go To The Scorecard: Cologuard Vs. InSure FIT


Knowing what we know about the tests, let's compare Cologuard to InSure FIT and see
how it stacks up. The data is pulled from our part two write up (here), which compares
Cologuard and Insure FIT on an apples-to-apples comparison over the same timeframe.

The Conclusion: The Addressable Market For Cologuard Is Small And Doctors
Won't Choose Cologuard Due to Compliance Issues


In summary, we strongly believe that based on the market for take-home colon cancer
screening, the expected compliance, and the expected quality of the results, that doctors
will recommend the InSure FIT over the Cologuard test for patients who need take-
home colon cancer screens. We would like to leave you with four main conclusions:


1. Due to regularly scheduled check-ups for men (starting at the age of 50) and women
(starting at the age of 21), the market for non-invasive take-home colon cancer
screening is largely limited to men 30-49 years of age, or about 40% of the size of the
market that Cologuard claims.


2. The actual need for colon cancer testing in men under 50 is minimal and Cologuard is
therefore unlikely to be widely prescribed in that population.


3. Based on our belief that compliance is directly related to the simplicity of the test and
inversely related to the amount of feces that a person is forced to handle, patient
compliance with the Cologuard test will be lower than with alternative tests like the
Insure FIT.


4. Based on the quality of the expected results, even if patients are only 67% compliant
with the InSure Fit vs. 100% compliant with the Cologuard test, the results still favor

whether or not Cologuard is approved by the FDA.


More to Come


This article, number three in our five part series, showed you why we feel that very few
patients will actually use the Cologuard test, even if it gets approved.


Our next article we will deconstruct the bull case, and explain why the Cologuard test will
never be the Pap smear. Finally, we will conclude by diving further into the facts, highlight
management's history of misrepresentation and product failures, and explain how Exact
Sciences has misled investors (again). Stay tuned.

PS. You obviously don't even know that the InSure FIT test that you speak so highly of, REQUIRES 2 samples. It
says so right on their website:


"Because colorectal conditions may not bleed all the time, or blood may not be uniformly distributed in the stool,
multiple sample FOBT or FIT take-home tests are recommended by the American Cancer Society
(http://bit.ly/12ptyeA) as one of the screening options. A single FOBT done during a digital rectal exam in the doctor’s
office is not sufficient for screening and is not recommended by the ACS. The InSure® FIT™ test requires one
sample from two different bowel movements."


http://bit.ly/12ptyeE


Ooops! 
So much for your claim that 100% compliance can be achieved during a single visit to your doctor's office for an
annual physical and digital rectal exam.


Looks like you are back to square one Bro. 
Nice try though!

We are still using 88% sensitivity on Insure FIT and we are still multiplying and not paying attention to staging? We
are not calculating the cost of treating the cancers that are found?

for FIT than for Cologuard. You may believe that if you repeat a criticism enough times that it is valid, but you
would be incorrect in that belief.

Well, why haven't you admitted that the 88% is bogus and that 75% is probably high! Why have you not
addressed the staging question or the independence of events question? Why are all cancers equally
valuable? Won't it be much more expensive to treat later stage cancers? Why does CMS use the Archimedes
model to calculate the cost/benefit of a test, not a multiplication? How does the screening population look
20yrs from now at what are the total costs (not just of screening....treatment is much more expensive,
particularly for late stage cancers) What happens when Deep-C shows that FIT detects pre-cancers at a
substantially lower sensitivity than 20% (check the incidence of pre cancers in Deep-C vs. expectations).  
And anyone that claims Insure has an 88% sensitivity should not be making comments about reading
comprehension. 
I'm keenly interested why CMS and the FDA use the Archimedes model.  
And save the insults, you have already made it clear that you are a wizard and I'm a moron. Close your eyes
and multiply.

I made it abundantly clear that more assumptions are needed and a simulation must be used (incorporating
all costs and treatment benefits, i.e. what stage is found, how many cancers progress between screenings,
etc). please refer to my questions regarding staging, compliance (years 2 and 3 and all the way to 7 in some
of your examples), cost of treatment, path to eradication of the deadly stages of CRC, etc. Questions that can
only be answered with a simulation and very detailed assumptions, not multiplication. Which leads to why do
the FDA and CMS use the Archimedes model. Can't they hire a high school intern to multiply? This is a very
complex problem with implications on treatment (are we treating stage 3 or 4), possible eradication, and what
the general screening population looks like in the future (based on the stages that are caught among other
variables).

Drinking a 40 on my balcony and counting the minutes! why tease us with multiplications if you have a

consult...they are pretty expensive consultants! How are we going to verify the results of your simulation? We
will need a lot of inputs (and i'm not talking 10. with backup--all sorts of proprietary data that is hard to get
access to, population data, and data proving fit tests are independent. not to mention average treatment cost
by patient stage with the treatment tha you assume is used and escalation). As much as I love talking EXAS,
simulations give me a hard on! I seriously hope that we are doing math and not arithmetic, i'll go limp if we
multiply.  
You need to hurry up though! I have a low tolerance, the math is complicated and it's Friday afternoon.

Author’s reply »  If the FIT compliance is only 50% for take-home tests then I would colocrap to be much worse - the
test is far more complicated to administer and is absolutely gross in comparison to FIT. Neither is fun but Colocrap is
much worse to have to do as a patient. Have fun loading a box full of poop into your car and driving down to UPS.

AE, 
Your DRE sampling at annual physical argument is wrong. DRE sampling is never recommended for FIT testing.
From the InSure FIT FAQ web page:


quote: 
Can a digital rectal exam sample be used on the InSure FIT Test Card? 
No. The InSure® FIT™ test has not been designed for use with a digital rectal exam. Both the American Cancer
Society and United States Preventative Service Task Force state that a FOBT or FIT done during a digital rectal exam
in the doctor’s office IS NOT adequate for screening.1,2 Research has shown that colorectal cancer sensitivity of a
FOBT is as low as 4.9% when used with a single digital rectal exam. 
end quote.


You did plenty of homework to write this article, including specifics about sample collection for InSure FIT, so how is it
that you missed this point? Just an example of how you report only what supports your argument, ignoring any truths
that might disagree.

Author’s reply »  Hey genius, the articles consistently state that the insure FIT is a take-home test and other
FITs can be used via DREs. Quote from first article:


"While the FIT is a good test, the InSure FIT is even better and is the current leader in take-home FIT testing."


Doesn't that say that you take Insure FIT at home and not via DRE?


Reading is (still) fundamental

When you take a breather from telling people how they don't read, maybe you could read some yourself. I'll
repost it here:


"Both the American Cancer Society and United States Preventative Service Task Force state that a FOBT or
FIT done during a digital rectal exam in the doctor’s office IS NOT adequate for screening."


That statement is not specific to InSure FIT, rather it applies to all FOBT and FIT. What you recommend is
mis-using a marginal value test to make it a nearly useless test, citing that it's better than nothing.

Author’s reply »  You get a cut and past reply:


That is why the article states: " While these in-office tests may not be as powerful as the take home versions,
and should be taken in conjunction with other colon cancer screens, the fact that the doctor can ensure 100%
compliance every year is very important and impossible to match with a take-home colon cancer screen.
Simply put, if a patient is unwilling to undergo this screen while at the doctor's office as part of another
regularly scheduled procedure, we feel that he or she is very unlikely to administer it to him or herself at
home."


So you see, since compliance is already so poor it's better than nothing. Or, put another way, even if 90% of
cancers and pre-cancers are missed with a DRE, you still catch 65% of them in a decade (the amount of time
a colonoscopy is good for).


Giving people the colocrap test which they need to call and order and then need to take a box of poop back to
UPS... that is a recipe for non-compliance.

And yet a big part of your thesis in Part 3 of your article is based on an annual physical check-up at your
Doctor's office in which DRE is able to allow for a FIT test.


Gee, it looks like the foundation of THAT argument went down the toilet as soon as I posted the facts from the
ACS about how taking a fecal sample from DRE to be used in a FIT test is only 9% sensitive for Cancer.


Meanwhile, your beloved take-home FIT test from Enterix called InSure FIT needs not just one sample, but
two.

28 Jul 2013, 04:29 PM


Energy-Trader
I'm sorry, but the American Cancer Society clearly states on their website that using "DRE" to obtain a stool sample
for a FIT test is not recommended. 
In fact, it says the following:


"In a digital rectal examination (http://bit.ly/12EZV2e), a doctor examines your rectum with a lubricated, gloved finger.
Although a DRE is often included as part of a routine physical exam, it is not recommended as a stand-alone test for
colorectal cancer. This simple test, which is not usually painful, can detect masses in the anal canal or lower rectum.
By itself, however, it is not a good test for detecting colorectal cancer because its reach is limited.


Doctors often find a small amount of stool in the rectum when doing a DRE. However, simply checking stool obtained
in this fashion for bleeding with an FOBT or FIT is not an acceptable method of screening for colorectal cancer.
Research has shown that this type of stool exam will miss more than 90% of colon abnormalities, including most
cancers."

cancerfixer
I was pleased to see that you have finally incorporated compliance issues into your series. Unfortunately for you, your
first article is full of holes because of 1) declining detection rates with serial testing and 2) failure to account for non-
compliance in your FIT assumptions.


In your first article you claimed that 3 annual FIT tests could detect 61 cancers compared to 59 for ColoGuard. Your
math assumes that detection rates and compliance remain the same in years 2 and 3 of FIT testing. We don't know
what serial tests might detect with ColoGuard - it has never been tested. But we DO know what serial testing can
accomplish with FIT testing. It has been studied - and published. Perhaps you missed these articles in your research.


This article (http://1.usa.gov/16jzK4Q) found that annual FIT testing cancer detection rates were 69% lower in year
two than in year one within the same population. We don't know about year 3, but it is safe to assume the detection
rate will be even less.


This article (http://1.usa.gov/16jzK4W) found that of “5700 consecutive screening participants, the compliance rates to
FIT were 95.1%, 79.9%, 66.2% and 68.4% at years one to four, respectively.”


Returning to Table 2 in your first article I have taken the liberty of correcting your 3 year FIT cancer detection rates for
these reduced serial detection rates and non-compliance (I assumed 100% compliance on year 1, to be generous).
The math reveals that 3 years of annual FIT testing would only detect 52 cancers in 10,000 hypothetical patients.
ColoGuard? 59 cancers in 10,000 real patients. Which test is superior?


All of your subsequent arguments fall apart when your first assumptions are shown to be incorrect. I have stopped
reading them, although it is amusing to see you stumble through the exercise.


In summary: EXAS has a prospective study of over 10,000 real patients showing that ColoGuard can detect 59
cancers. You have only demonstrated that FIT may be capable of detecting 52 cancers in a hypothetical population of
10,000. ColoGuard has already demonstrated that its test is AT LEAST equivalent to FIT (and apparently better when
accurate statistics are used). You haven't shown anything but a bias toward FIT testing and a very limited
understanding of medical research, statistics, and the FDA approval process. Trust me, I've done this for over 30
years. ColoGuard WILL be approved by the FDA this year for more reasons than you could understand. I suggest you
spend more time on analysis and less time writing about things you clearly do not understand.

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Sigh. Your comment would be better if it didn't contain so many errors. Let's take them one
at a time:


1) Detection rates decline over time:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1575652-exact-sciences-line-your-pockets-not-your-toilet-bowl-3-of-5 17/25


A: Of course they do and my tables show that. I'm not sure where you get 69% from the abstract you link to,
but let's take my first table from the first article as an example: In year 1, there are 42 cancers found out of
10k people tested for a detection rate of 0.42% and in year 2 it falls to 14 out of 9348 or 0.15% - a decline of
64%. Pretty close to your 69%.


2) Regarding declines in compliance, you are correct that this exists. The best way to look at this is actually to
ding each and every year by your suggested percent - in this case comparing colocrap to Morikawa stats
would result in colocrap 56 cancers, FIT 54, colocrap 300 precancers vs FIT 283, colocrap 1135 false
positives vs FIT 977. These differences would not be statistically significant. Moreover, using average FIT
stats (forget about Insure), would result in FIT finding 57 cancers, 468 pre-cancers, and having 977 false
positives. However, this comparison also makes the assumption that Colocrap has the same year-1
compliance as FIT, which I find to be highly unlikely. Normalization happens with on a 4% difference in year-1
compliance - i.e. likely and also probably statistically insignificant.


It would behoove you to pose your comments in a politer fashion or otherwise to have some common sense.


26 Jul 2013, 03:27 PM


Energy-Trader
You don't seem to understand what a Real World "prospective" study means. Deep-C was a prospective
study.


The only thing that matters to the FDA is how FIT compared with Cologuard in the "Deep-C" study. That data
has not been released yet, and won't be until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal in the second half of
this year.


But I'm sure that won't stop you from making all sorts of erroneous calculations and claims about data that
hasn't been released as of yet.

I'd like to raise the following points:


1. The American Gastorenterology Assn does not agree that a DRE is an acceptable screening test for colon cancer
and that colon cancer can be routinely screened in the physician office. Most physicians consider a colonoscopy as
the gold standard test. There is a smaller group of physicians who use a flexible sigmoidoscopy in the office, but the
flex sig does not examine the entire colon. I suggest you read the screening procedures on the AGA website
(http://www.gastro.org) as you are wrong on the medicine. All your comments, your use of "therefore" (5th paragraph)
and "furthermore" (6th paragraph) are inappropriate. If fact, your entire thesis of benefits of the DRE and routine
physician office screening is misplaced and incorrect and any assumptions based on this thesis is also misplaced.


2. I agree that compliance is the key, as compliance in people having colonoscopies is low, which is why a substitute
is helpful. I don't see the differences in compliance in using Cologuard vs. FIT/InSure FIT. My experience is that

physician encouragement would be a factor with overall compliance.


3. I suspect that for the surveyed patient population, colonoscopies would be required every 10 years irrespective of
whether the Cologuard or InSure FIT would be performed. Keep mind that the dollars noted in your comparison table
are insignificant compared treatment of colon cancer. 10 -20 colon cancer cases would make up the difference. More
screening is better than less screening.


26 Jul 2013, 02:54 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1. Of course you can't use a DRE to find colon cancer. You need to use the fecal matter left
over to run an FIT to fund it. This is not without controversy and I acknowledge that by providing links to both
NIH (which seems to think this is ok) and American Cancer (which does not). My point is that with low at-
home compliance, this is better than nothing.


2. I disagree and think that when you make people handle lots of poop compliance goes down. Less poop =
better compliance IMO. Also, being able to mail via your mailbox rather than driving a box of poop to UPS
also helps compliance,


3. Full cost analysis is coming in part 4. Part 2 was simply meant to show that the test is not cost effective vs
FIT

You keep claiming that you can use the fecal matter left over from a DRE to run a FIT test with. Once again, you show
how terribly ignorant you are.


World renown colon cancer research scientist DA Lieberman who is on the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal
Cancer Screening states:


“A significant limitation of testing with gFOBT is that it is commonly performed in the doctor’s office as a single-panel
test following a digital rectal exam. ……While this approach may seem pragmatic, Collins et al2 demonstrated a
sensitivity of only 4.9% for advanced neoplasia and only 9% for cancer. The accuracy of this method is so low that it
cannot, under any circumstances or rationale of convenience, be considered as a method of CRC screening,.”

Moreover, the NIH has nothing to do with the USPS Task Force for Colorectal Cancer Screening, of which DA

Please note the comments made by Adam Feurstein in his article. Most of them make sense. I read all the links that
you provided and came to a similar conclusion. It is clearly pointed out in the reference that you used that Insure FIT
would be expected to have smaller CRC sensitivity than 88%. Quoting 88% is totally meaningless because it mixes
two populations a screening and a diagnostic one. You should consider only the screening population for which the
CRC sensitivity was 82.4%. By the way, that particular study was funded by Enterix the creator of Insure FIT. It
appears that they presented the results in a way that makes Insure FIT look better than what was observed. I really
find it strange that the accuracy on stage II and stage III cancers was not 100%. A 92% CRC sensitivity of Cologaurd
makes it substantially superior and really a useful test.  
The same study reported that for small adenomas Insure FIT had a sensitivity of 29.6% and for large adenomas (>= 1
cm) the sensitivity was 44.4% on the screening population. Whereas Cologaurd has a sensitivity of 66% for
adenomas that are greater than 2cm. These numbers are not exactly comparable but it still appears that Cologuard
has an advantage. 
Now you fail to address the most important issue, the time factor. Early detection saves lives. The survival drops
rapidly when cancers are detected at later stages and the cost of treatment increases substantially. For those that did
not survive, the cost of hospital stays towards the end is very high. You cannot just add the results of three years for
FIT and try to compare it to Cologuard because the cancers detected in years 2 and 3 are likely to have advanced
during that period.


27 Jul 2013, 06:03 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  It really doesn't matter which stats you use for Insure - it outperforms Colocrap over a full 3-
year testing cycle.


The difference between 88% and 82.6% may seem like a lot to you, but in the 64 patient population with CRC
that was screened in DeeP-C this is 3 people, all of whom would be expected to be found the next year. See
articles about the generally slow growth rate of CRC such as http://bit.ly/12vH6p0 which states "Colorectal
cancer is a slow-growing cancer that can take up to ten years to develop, leaving a generous window of
opportunity for screening."


I think you're missing the rate of growth of CRC. If you read the company's slides, they clearly show that pre-
cancerous polyps progress very slowly.

From a physician's perspective. The main limitations for cancer screening are poor patient compliance and poor
testing performance. Regarding FIT vs Cologuard:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1575652-exact-sciences-line-your-pockets-not-your-toilet-bowl-3-of-5 21/25


a)Physicians do not like uncertainty. When a physician diagnosis cancer he wants it to be early stage, not advanced.
FIT sensitivity depends on the patient bleeding as FIT detects globin. Cancers do not bleed all the time and therefore
yearly samples are required. Cologuard detects DNA which explains it better performance. American Cancer Society
and American Gastroenterological Association will love it.


b) Collecting a sample of stool and delivering it is an uncomfortable process. FIT and FOBT requiring scraping stool in
the toilet bowl; Cologuard doesn't (patient poops directly).


c) As a pulmonologist I have seen MANY colonoscopies in the intensive care unit (for life-threatening gastrointestinal
bleed). I can not recall a single patient being enthusiastic about having their rectal vault invaded (even under
moderate sedation).


Cologuard will not be marketed as replacing colonoscopies. I SUSPECT it will be marketed as having a 90%+
detection rate which will be seen by MDs as comparable to colonoscopy. EXAS will market it as very easy to do (1
sample) and that the company will make great efforts trying to get the patient to send the sample. What better
screening service for MDs:  
-It makes an early solid diagnosis  
-Less work for the clerk/assistant making sure sample gets done. 
-MD does not have to find a gastroenterologist that takes Medicaid (some will not take plain Medicare) for routine
colonoscopies

EXAS shares at a cheaper price

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1) I think the extraordinarily high false positive rate (expected at 76%) and the low
compliance with the test (because it is gross) will limit physician adoption


2) I think one of the biggest problems with compliance with cologuard is the need to ship (rather than mail) the
sample back. Also, I think shipping must be done within 1-2 days of collection. Lastly, the FIT collection via
brush is much easier than Fobt which requires a schmear.


3) I never claimed patients like colonoscopies.


I disagree what physicians will see. I think they will see a test that: 
-Is less effective over time than FIT 
-Has reimbursement problems 
-Has a very poor positive predictive value (lots of false positives) 
-Has poor patient compliance due to the extensive fecal handling

As a primary care MD, I personally think the FIT testing will likely have a higher compliance rate. Take a small sample
from stool in the toilet vs taking a BM in a bucket. I would be worried about stool getting outside the bucket, etc.
Really FIT testing seems easier to me. No MD I know does stool testing at the time of a DRE, let the patient do their
own dirty work which is also more accurate.


I am not commenting on the specificity nor sensitivity of the various tests.


In Canada (B.C.) we use the FIT as a screen, which if positive will require a colonoscopy. Some people won't do a
screening test cause they don't want to know. It's not my problem if they are non compliant or simply refuse it.


I have a hard time believing that MDs in the USA will use the Cologuard as a "replacement" to colonoscopies as
Lungman would suggest, given the way your medicolegal system works. The lawyers are licking their chops at that
prospect.

Nobody says that it will replace it. But it is very easy to see it as competing with a colonoscope for diagnosing
malignancy (90%+ effective). At the end of the day an MD does not like uncertainty and FIT is much more
uncertain.


Regarding stool collection. EXAS provides you the bucket in which the patient directly poops. Bucket is taken
out and sent directly to company; very simple (unless patient is quite crippled like from dementia or stroke).
Most 50+ years old should find it easy.


I have seen MDs do guaiacs many many times after a DRE in Atlanta, San Diego, Milwaukee and now in
Miami. Why not take advantage of the moment? It is not as effective but quite more than never doing any

testing at all.


@jhugard: 
The author from the Barron's article you posted does not mention his bibliography (this is VERY important). It
would be nice to know how he knows 10 million kits are sold annually. Assuming that data is accurate, 10
million screened patients is much less than the 80 million people they say are candidates for screening.
Having said this Barron's math might be off. According to the 2010 US Census Bureau, the population over
50 is at least 99 million, which creates a bigger market for any cancer screening technique

Cologuard is not meant to replace the colonoscopy whatsoever. It is meant to be in direct competition with FIT
testing. Cologuard is meant to be a pre-screen to a colonoscopy, where if you get a positive result you will be
urged to have a colonoscopy done. If your result is negative, the colonoscopy can wait.

Author’s reply »  Please remember that 76% of the colonoscopies that will be ordered as a result of a positive
cologuard test will actually be false positives.


I think taking a bucket of poop to the local UPS store within 1-2 days is actually a large burden and will cause
low levels of compliance.


As regards Barrons, I think they have simply quoted the entire FOBT/FIT market as being "take home," which
I believe to be incorrect.


Lastly, the commentator above clearly shows that docs disagree of the use of DRE collected stool for CRC
testing.

My only comment is that the above observation that for the ColoGuard test an individual "poops directly" into some
sort of container, presumably cleanly, is disingenuous. Few people have proficient enough control over their
evacuation process to produce only the measured amount of stool required. In fact, it takes little imagination to see
that the collection process could well be catastrophic.  
The most repugnant smell to the human animal is the smell of human feces, it has been determined scientifically.  
This is a nasty test, no doubt about it. 
I would think that if a physician can talk a patient into performing this sort of thing at home, it should be relatively easy
to convince the patient to enduring the day or so of loose stools as part of the colonoscopy prep.

You have to try 1 gallon of Golitely + having an entire night of diarrhea to understand what colonoscopy
preparation means. Having said this, to get a colonoscopy takes quite a bit of time from the MD and patient
perspective.


a) Clerk has to find a gastroenterologist that will take the patient's insurance 
b) A colonoscopy might take 10 minutes + roughly 1-2 hours post anesthesia supervision. This limits the
number of colonoscopies an MD can do. Gastroenterologists also have clinic and inpatient duties.  
c) After a colonoscopy, the day is blocked for that patient (because of remaining sedative effects).

Author’s reply »  Nobody is saying that colonoscopies aren't nasty. All I am saying is that if you take a FIT
regularly you will have a less disgusting test and better results over time.

I have a woman friend who weighs about 100 pounds. The prescribing doc failed to titrate the bowel prep
quantities to her weight in spite of her request to do so. She attempted to comply and ended up in
convulsions due to hyponatremia. I had to rush her to the emergency room, and she would have DIED had I
not been there due to inability to even dial 911.

Lets see a test ( ColoGuard ) my respected physician says can likely reduce my chances of ever having advanced
CRC and reduce the need for unnecessary colonoscopies and the aweful prep etc etc....please give me the bucket
ASAP ..compliance will NOT be a big deal


28 Jul 2013, 05:54 AM

Author’s reply »  And yet compliance problems with FOBT and FIT are routinely cited in comments to my
articles as reasons why my math around cumulative sensitivity is wrong. I'll show why that isn't the case
another time (already gave results in an earlier comment). But it's pretty interesting that people want me to
simultaneously believe (1) that compliance with colocrap will not be a problem and (2) compliance problems
with FIT mean that colocrap is better

Alpha - bravo because whatever your interests, a discussion of this quality and depth has been long overdue -
congrats on that. I think their study data presented so far has been disappointing and patchy. A quick question if I may

- what headline se/sp performance for (a) CRC & (b) pre-cancer detection do you think would have been "good
enough"? Do your models give any indication or do you have an opinion on that?


28 Jul 2013, 06:34 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I actually think the biggest problem with the test is specificity. Current stats suggest 76% of
colonoscopies ordered will be entirely unnecessary. 50% pre-cancer sensitivity would have helped.

One of the most significant issues is false-positives - health care already consumes much more $$$ than it should
and with 75% false-positives.... 
Another issue is early detection - a test that detects stage IV is worthless while a test for advanced adenomas is
precious. 
Finally, right-sided colon lesions are poorly seen even by a gold-standard colonoscopy, and quite a few of my
colleagues argue in favor of sigmoidoscopy. 
Compliance is and will be an issue, and the only way that I can see now is a blood-based test (something like SEPT-
9) that can be administered with the usual blood draw sample collection.
