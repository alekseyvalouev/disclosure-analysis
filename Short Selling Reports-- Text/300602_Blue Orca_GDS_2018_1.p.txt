GDS Holdings Limited (“GDS” or the “Company”) is a US-listed developer and operator of data centers 
in China.  GDS’s stock was up 400%+ in the last year until a recent pullback.  Measured off its July 2018 
highs, GDS was valued at an absurd 80x EV/ TTM EBITDA, even though its interest payments now 
exceed its reported gross profits.  Investors have indulged GDS’s staggering debt burden because of the 
belief in its supposedly impressive growth.   
 
But our research indicates that in reality, GDS is borrowing crippling amounts of debt to enrich insiders 
by acquiring data centers from undisclosed related parties which are not nearly as valuable as the 
Company claims.  We believe that since becoming a public Company, GDS has borrowed recklessly to 
siphon off at least RMB 696 million to insiders by inflating the purchase price of undisclosed related 
party acquisitions.   
 
We have also discovered evidence of unrelated data center operators selling a substantial amount of 
empty cabinet space in a building which is supposedly exclusively operated and 94% utilized by GDS.  
In our opinion, this indicates that GDS is inflating the size of its service area, its utilization rates and 
therefore its reported revenues and EBITDA.  In our model, we assume that the Company has overstated 
utilization of its data centers by 20% and that its growth is largely illusory.  After adjustment, we value 
GDS’s shares at $4.32, 87.6% below its last traded price.  Yet even this valuation, in our opinion, is 
likely conservative.  Given management’s shattered credibility, its crushing debts, and evidence that the 
Company is inflating the value and performance of its data centers, we think GDS’s equity could easily 
be worth $0.00.   
 
1. Overstating Area in Service and Utilization of a Flagship Data Center.  We decided to test the 


Company’s claims in a market where it purports to be strongest.  GDS claims that its Guangzhou 1 
data center (“GZ1”) fully occupies the entire six floors of the G6 data center building in the 
Guangzhou Innovation Park.  GDS claims that 100% of the space in the G6 building is 
“committed” and 94% is currently utilized, making it one of GDS’s flagship data centers in one 
of GDS’s strongest markets.  Yet we spoke with two different independent companies which claim 
to be operating data centers (and making cabinets available for lease) in the same building, which 
would be impossible if GDS’s claims were accurate.  One operator, GZIDC told us over a recorded 
phone call that it leased out 1.5 floors of the G6 building and operated at ~60% utilization.  GZIDC 
followed up our inquiry by sending a quote offering to rent us a significant amount of space in the 
very same data center GDS claims to exclusively operate at 94% utilization.  GZIDC also, at our 
request, sent us pictures of rows of empty cabinets in the G6 building.  This would be impossible 
if GDS’s representations regarding the data center were true.  We think such evidence shows that 
GDS is overstating the area in service and utilization rates of one of its flagship data centers, which 
in turn suggests it is overstating reported revenues and profits across its portfolio.

2. Inflating the Purchase Price of Undisclosed Related Party Acquisitions.  Our due diligence of SAIC 
filings and other publicly available information databases in the PRC indicates (in our opinion) that in 3 of 
GDS’s 4 major post-IPO transactions, GDS not only acquired data centers from undisclosed related parties, 
but overstated the purchase price of such acquisitions in its SEC filings.  In our opinion, this is a near textbook 
case of independent evidence showing that unscrupulous insiders looted RMB 696 million from the public 
Company.  We note that such transactions took place only months after GDS’s IPO, indicating, in our 
opinion, that GDS was eager to transfer newly raised public money to insiders.  This behavior is reminiscent 
of the worst offenders of the China-Hustle era of 2010-2011. 
 


a. Shenzhen 5 Data Center Acquisition.  In June 2017, GDS supposedly purchased Shenzhen Yaode 
Data Services (“Shenzhen Yaode”), which operates a Shenzhen datacenter (“SZ5”), for RMB 312 
million from a “third party.”  However, publicly available SAIC filings show that two GDS 
employees also served as the acquisition target’s (Shenzhen Yaode’s) director and supervisor prior 
to the acquisition.  Put simply, we found the same individuals on both sides of the transaction, 
indicating that this was an undisclosed related party acquisition from sellers secretly connected to 
GDS.  Furthermore, publicly available SAIC filings in China state that the true purchase price of the 
transaction was only RMB 500,000, not RMB 312 million as the Company stated in its SEC filings.  
We believe that GDS overstated the purchase price by 624x and presume that insiders likely looted 
part or all of the difference.     
 


b. Weiteng Network (Guangzhou 2) Data Center Acquisition.  In October 2017, GDS acquired 
Guangzhou Weiteng Network Technology, which owned a data center in Guangzhou (“GZ2”), 
supposedly for RMB 234 million.  Yet Weiteng Network’s SAIC filings state that it was sold to 
GDS for only RMB 72 million, indicating that GDS inflated the reported value of the 
acquisition in its SEC filings by 3.25x!  Furthermore, GDS failed to disclose that Weitang Network 
and its datacenter (GZ2) was built and owned by Shenzhen Ningguanghong Technology (“SNT”).  
SNT’s filings, available in the PRC, stated that the fair value of Weiteng Network and its data center 
was only RMB 70.4 million and that the PP&E value of the project was only RMB 168 million, not 
RMB 320 million as GDS claimed in its SEC filings.  Such filings indicate, in our opinion, that GDS 
not only overstated the purchase price of the acquisition, but also inflated the value of the acquired 
PP&E.  Furthermore, we found a number of overlapping connections prior to the acquisition 
between GDS, the acquisition target and its sellers, including common registered phone numbers 
and email addresses.  Entities with the same registered email addresses and phone numbers, in our 
view, are likely connected through common ownership or control; and such connections indicate 
that the acquisition was an undisclosed related party transaction.     
 


c. Weiteng Data (Guangzhou 3) Data Center Acquisition.  In May 2018, GDS consummated the 
acquisition of another data center (GZ3), purportedly for RMB 262 million.  Although GDS is coy 
about the name of the acquired entity and the seller, we think SAIC filings clearly show that the 
acquired entity was Weiteng Data.  Yet Weiteng Data’s SAIC files state that GDS purchased it for 
only RMB 40 million, indicating that the Company overstated the purchase price by RMB 220 
million, or 6.6x!  In addition, online corporate records indicate that prior to the acquisition, 
Weiteng Data shared the same registered phone number as a GDS subsidiary and another related 
party seller. The web of common registered email addresses and phone numbers between GDS, the 
acquisition target and the sellers, indicate, in our opinion, that this was yet another undisclosed 
related party acquisition. 


 
3. Serial Capital Raising and Crushing Debts for Offshore Cash?  Since its IPO, GDS has been a serial 


capital raiser, issuing equity and debt despite ample cash on its balance sheet.  GDS claims to need such 
money to grow.  Yet GDS discloses that it keeps over 65% of its cash balance off-shore (and only 24% of 
its total cash in RMB), where it would be essentially useless if the purpose of raising such cash was to buy 
and build data centers in China.  Why does a business that operates exclusively in China keep 65% of its 
cash off-shore? Why does GDS borrow at interest rates up to 9.7% in China, only to have most of its cash 
sit in foreign currencies earning less than 0.6% interest? Cash held offshore is easily looted by insiders but 
useless for building a data center in China or operating its business.  The Company’s debt levels are so 
crushing that its interest costs now exceed its gross profits in Q1 2018.  GDS’s net debt to reported LTM

GDS Holdings Limited│ NASDAQ: GDS                           www.blueorcacapital.com 
.com 


EBITDA stands at 9.4x, which is far more leverage than almost every other publicly listed IDC provider, 
even the fast-growing ones.  That GDS has incurred such debts only for the cash to sit idly offshore earning 
less than 0.6% or to be siphoned off in undisclosed related party transactions is a significant red flag 
reminiscent of other US-listed Chinese companies which collapsed in the China Hustle era.  
 


4. Mounting Balance of Unbilled Receivables.  In FY 2017, GDS reported that “unbilled receivables” 
comprised 70% of its accounts receivables and 16% of total sales.  In our years of experience, we have 
never seen a Company claim that such a significant portion of revenues are not even papered by an invoice 
to customers.  It is inexplicable, given that GDS’s proportion of unbilled receivables has almost doubled 
since its IPO.  To our knowledge, no other publicly traded IDC comp discloses such material balances of 
unbilled receivables in the ordinary course of business, making GDS a significant outlier.  In our opinion, 
this mounting balance corroborates other evidence of overstated revenues, because such unbilled receivables 
are more difficult to audit and verify. 
 


5. Mounting Balance of Payables.  Since going public, the Company’s reported days payable outstanding have 
ballooned from 205 to 470 days.  To put that in context, if GDS’s financials are true, on average it takes the 
Company almost 16 months to pay its suppliers.  This strains credulity.  Strip out acquisition related 
payables, and GDS’s DPOs are still 353.  We believe that inflated payables are a tell-tale sign of fabricated 
profits, and support evidence that the Company overstates the utilization rates of its data centers.   
 


VALUATION 


We believe that the evidence presented in this report indicates that GDS’s area in service and utilization rates are 
lower than the Company claims in its SEC filings.  First, we conducted a case study on one of GDS’s flagship data 
centers in one of its strongest markets.  GDS claims to operate the entire data center at a 94% utilization rate, with 
100% of the space already committed to customers.  To state the obvious, if GDS is telling the truth to U.S. investors, 
it should operate the entire building, and there should be no space available at the data center to lease.  
 
Yet two independent companies stated that they also operated portions of the data center, suggesting GDS does not 
have the entire building as it claims.  Furthermore, one operator offered to lease us a material amount of cabinet space, 
which again, would be impossible if GDS already had commitments for the entire data center.  In our opinion, such 
evidence directly undermines GDS’s claims regarding the area in service and the utilization of this flagship asset.   
 
There is never just one cockroach.  We think it’s fair to assume that if the Company is overstating utilization at one 
facility, it is likely doing so at other facilities.  If utilization and area in service are overstated, then so are reported 
revenues and profits.   
 
There is other evidence to suggest that the Company’s revenues are overstated.  GDS is a clear outlier among publicly 
listed IDC providers in that it claims 70% of its accounts receivables are comprised of unbilled receivables.  This 
amounted to 16% of GDS’s FY 2017 reported revenues, a staggering amount.  Compared to other publicly listed IDC 
providers, GDS appears to be a major outlier.     
 
Unbilled receivables, we believe, are ripe for abuse because without a direct invoice to the customer they are more 
difficult to audit.  It is our suspicion that the balance of unbilled receivables represents the amount of overstatement 
of revenues from overstated utilization and/or area in service.   
 
Accordingly, in our model, even though we give credit to the Company’s reported EBITDA margin of 30% (which 
we believe is also inflated), by assuming that GDS’s actual utilization is 20% less than reported (which is supported 
by the unbilled receivables and primary due diligence), we forecast that GDS’s actual EBITDA for FY 2018 will be 
RMB 551 million.

1: As of Q1 2018 
Source: Blue Orca Model based on our Estimates and Due Diligence 


Investors have indulged GDS’s debt burden and pushed its stock to absurd valuations because of the belief in its 
supposedly impressive growth.  But our research indicates that in reality, GDS is borrowing crippling amounts of debt 
only to siphon off a portion of the cash to insiders and acquire data centers which are not nearly as valuable as the 
Company claims in its SEC filings.  
 
There are more reasons to question the Company’s supposed borrow-spend-grow model.  Over 65% of GDS’s cash 
balance is kept off-shore, making it useless to a Company operating exclusively in China which is supposedly buying 
and building data centers exclusively in the PRC.  Such off-shore cash only makes it easier for insiders to siphon 
money through self-dealing transactions.  Why is the Company paying up to 9.7% interest to borrow money in China 
only for the Company to collect 0.6% or less in interest on a cash balance kept were it cannot be used to grow or 
operate a PRC business?  
 
Accordingly, we believe that GDS’s growth story, which has made it a market darling, is likely illusory.  We think it 
is smarter to compare the Company on an EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple to slower growing data center operators.  
For our model, we therefore assign a generous forward multiple of 20x.   
 
But it is not so simple because overstating the price of related party acquisitions is reminiscent of the worst US-listed 
Chinese companies which collapsed in the China hustle era of 2010-2011.  In the months after its IPO, GDS reported 
six data center acquisitions for a total consideration of RMB 1.18 billion.  Based on our review of SAIC filings and 
other publicly available records, we believe that GDS inflated the value of such acquisitions by at least RMB 696 
million, and that is without being able to verify 3 of the 6 transactions.  SAIC filings and other publicly available 
public records indicate, in our opinion, that 3 of the 4 major post-IPO acquisitions were undisclosed related party 
acquisitions.

Such transactions show a contempt for the basic values required to be a public company, so we also apply a 25% 
governance discount on this multiple.  Taking our EBITDA forecast together with what we believe is a more accurate 
utilization rate, we then apply this multiple to reach our valuation.

GDS’s debt burden is so significant that in Q1 2018, its interest payments exceeded even the gross profits reported in 
its SEC filings.  Based on the evidence in this report, we believe that such financials are not credible.  The profits 
may be fake or inflated, but the debt is real.   
 
After subtracting net debt, we value GDS’s ADR’s at $4.32 per share, an 87.6% downside from its last traded 
price.  Our valuation shows, given GDS’s crippling debts, the sensitivity of its share price to small tweaks in the basic 
assumptions about the Company’s growth, utilization, and trading multiple.  We also think our model is likely 
conservative.   
 
Given management’s shattered credibility, GDS’s crushing debts, and evidence that the Company is inflating the 
performance and value of its data centers, we could easily see GDS’s equity going to $0.00.

OVERSTATING SERVICE AREA AND UTILIZATION AT A FLAGSHIP DATA CENTER 


GDS tells investors that it has more than 50% of the carrier-neutral data center market in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen/Guangzhou.1  We decided to test the Company’s claims in Guangzhou, one of the cities it claims to be the 
strongest.   


A case study of one of GDS’s flagship data centers indicates, in our opinion, that GDS is overstating its reported area 
in service and utilization rates, suggesting the Company on a whole generates less revenues and profits than it claims 
in its SEC filings.   


GDS acquired the GZ1 datacenter and its parent entity, Guangzhou Weiteng Construction Co. Ltd (“Guangzhou 
Weiteng”), for RMB 129.5 million in May 2016, six months before the Company’s IPO.  At the date of acquisition, 
the GZ1 data center had just commenced operations. 


 
Source: GDS Prospectus 


According to GDS, GZ1 is a six-floor data center located in the G6 building, No. 31 Kefeng Road, in the South 
China Advanced Materials Innovation Park Co., Guangzhou (the “Guangzhou Innovation Park”). 
 


 
Source: http://www.sohu.com/a/105083602_354987 


GDS claims that GZ1 has had a customer commitment rate of 100% since acquisition and that its utilization rate 
reached 94% at the end of Q1 2018.  According to GDS, this makes GZ1 one of its nine self-developed “stabilized 
data centers,” a term the Company uses to categorize its best data centers with utilization rates above 80%.

When we called a GDS representative, she stated on a recorded phone call that the Company fits on average one 
cabinet per 2.5 square meters of utilizable space.  Based on our analysis of other IDC providers, this ratio is typical 
for the industry.  If GDS’s SEC filings are true, and it operates 6,521 square meters of utilizable space out of the G6 
building, we calculate that it would require at least 4.5 floors of the 5 floors available. 





Just to confirm our assumptions, we called a GDS sales associate in China, who again claimed that GDS operated the 
entire G6 building and that it was almost fully utilized.

GDS Sales Rep: Right. The 5th floor has some space which is not big and just over 30 
cabinets. Not a whole lot.

GDS claims in its SEC filings to lease the entire G6 building.  It repeated the claim to us when we called to confirm.  
And we calculate that for its stated capacity and utilization rates to be true, that must be the case.   


Yet we spoke with two supposedly independent data center service operators which claimed to occupy space in 
that same G6 building.  If other data center operators occupy part of the space, then the Company is overstating its 
purported area in service.  One operator offered to lease out a significant amount of empty space to us.  If GDS was 
telling the truth, then this would be impossible as the building is supposedly 100% committed and almost fully (94%) 
utilized.     


First, we contacted GZIDC, an independent operator of data centers in China, because it has a picture of the G6 
building on its website. 


 
Source: https://www.gzidc.com/idc.php 


We called a sales representative of GZIDC to inquire about renting data center space, and he stated that GZIDC 
currently operates a data center on 1 and a half floors of the G6 building.  The representative confirmed that the G6 
building, just as GDS claims, has 6 floors.  Five floors, according to the sales rep, are designed as a data center to 
accommodate services.  Each floor has two sections which can accommodate roughly 300 cabinets per section (600 
per floor).  According to the sales rep, GZIDC leases three sections on two floors to customers.  


GZIDC followed up our inquiry by sending us a quotation offering to rent available space in the data center in the 
G6 building.  Put simply, GZIDC is advertising to rent us a significant amount of space in the same data center that 
GDS tells US investors is 100% committed and 94% utilized.

According to our recorded phone call with a GZIDC sales representative, the utilization rate of GZIDC’s sections is 
around 60%.  This representative also stated that half of one of GZIDC’s floors is vacant, and that the vacant area can 
fit around 300 cabinets.  This interview suggests that the utilization rate at the G6 building is considerably lower than 
the 94% claimed by GDS to U.S. investors.  


To confirm that indeed the building had ample empty space available to rent, GZIDC, at our request, sent us pictures 
of empty cabinet space in the G6 building!  The sales representative said these pictures were taken a week ago (late 
July 2018).

From the pictures, we can see rows of empty server cabinets.  In our opinion, these images, together with our recorded 
phone conversations and accompanying marketing materials from GZIDC, are powerful evidence that GDS is lying 
when it tells US investors that the G6 building is 100% committed and 94% utilized.   


We considered the possibility that GZIDC rented space from GDS, or was a sub-lessor, even though GDS never admits 
in any public filing that it subleases to other data center operators.  When we asked the GZIDC sales representative 
about GDS, he said GZIDC leases the empty floor space from China Mobile and characterized GDS as a competitor.

In addition, we spoke with another data center provider, Big One, which also claims to operate a data center out of the 
G6 building.   


When we called Big One, a representative told us that Big One operates a data center out of the G6 building and it is 
almost full.  Notably, Big One also sent us a marketing brochure offering space available in the G6 building.  This 
presentation also included a blue print of the floor plan in the G6 building.

Big One is another example of an unaffiliated entity which claims to operate a data center out of the G6 building, 
which should, if GDS’s disclosures are true, be operated exclusively by the Company. Based on our due diligence, we 
believe that GZIDC and Big One lease out at two floors (perhaps three) in the G6 building.

and Quotes from Competing Providers 
 


For GDS’s SEC filings regarding the utilized space to be true, its data center must occupy all five server room floors 
of the G6 building.  Yet GZIDC and Big One also claim to operate floors out of the very same building, and GZIDC 
provided ample evidence of empty server cabinets, suggesting that GDS is overstating the area in service and the 
utilization rate of a flagship asset.  If GDS was telling the truth, then we wouldn’t be sent pictures of empty space in 
the building with an offer to rent out rows of empty cabinets.   


If GDS is overstating the amount of square footage it operates out of the GZ1 data center and/or the utilization rate of 
its space, we believe that it is reasonable to assume that GDS is overstating its service area and utilization at other data 
centers as well.  This has drastic implications for the value of its business.   
 
We performed a basic sensitivity analysis to show just how critical GDS’s reported utilization rates are to its financial 
performance.  Historically, on average 30% of GDS’s COGS have been power, which we assume is a variable cost.  
If we assume that the other 70% of its COGS are fixed costs which do not fluctuate based on occupancy rates, we 
calculate that if GDS’s true utilization rate is 5% less than it claims in its SEC filings, GDS would have a 0% 
operating margin.

Assumption: 1. Breakdown of cost of revenue: Variable (power) vs. Fixed (D&A and other): 30% vs 70% 


2. SG&A, interest and other expenses are fixed costs 
 
GDS’s debts are real, and many of its costs are fixed.  Small changes to its occupancy therefore have a toxic ripple 
effect on its financial performance.  GZIDC told us that the utilization rate of their section of the G6 building was 
60%, much lower than GDS’s reported 94% utilization rate for the data center.  Our sensitivity analysis shows that if 
GDS’s true utilization rate is only 20% lower than stated, the Company would operate at a negative 14% operating 
margin.   
 
We conclude, based on our analysis of one of GDS’s flagship data centers, that the Company’s area in service and its 
reported utilization rate are materially lower than it claims in its SEC filings.  If that is the case, then it is smart to 
assume GDS’s revenues and profits are also lower than reported.

INFLATING THE PURCHASE PRICE OF UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTY ACQUISITIONS 


One of the hallmarks of US-listed Chinese companies which have collapsed amid evidence of fraud is the use of 
undisclosed related party transactions to funnel shareholder money to insiders, typically by overstating the value of 
an acquired asset or entity secretly purchased from insiders.   


We believe that GDS is no different.  Despite punishing debt levels, the Company continues to tap debt and equity 
markets, supposedly to fund the construction and acquisition of new data centers in China.   


Since its IPO, GDS has announced six acquisitions for a total consideration of RMB 1.2 billion.  Two such acquisitions 
were tiny (BJ4 and BJ5), with less than RMB 26 million in consideration.  We could not find information for the 
Shanghai acquisition in May 2018 (SH 11).   


But our due diligence of independent public records in China, including SAIC filings, indicates that in 3 of the 4 major 
post IPO acquisitions (SZ5, GZ2 and GZ3), GDS not only purchased data centers from what we believe are 
undisclosed related parties but overstated the purchase price of the transactions by an aggregate RMB 696 million! 





In our opinion, GDS likely exaggerated the reported purchase price of these related party acquisitions because insiders 
simply looted the difference from the public Company.  Not only is this egregious behavior on par with the worst of 
the China Hustle era, but in our opinion, it shows that rather than borrow to fund supposedly impressive growth; GDS 
is incurring crippling debts in part to unjustly enrich insiders at the expense of creditors and shareholders.   


Once lenders become aware of GDS’s scheme, we believe the capital markets will be closed to the Company, and its 
purported borrow-spend-grow business model, along with its share price, will collapse.   


1) Shenzhen 5 Data Center Acquisition 


On June 29, 2017, GDS reported that it acquired a Shenzhen data center and its parent entity (“Shenzhen 5” or (“SZ5”) 
for RMB 312 million from a “third party.”

Records show that GDS’s WGYL employed two individuals in key positions who at the same time worked for the 
target company, Shenzhen Yaode, prior to the acquisition.  In short, these two individuals were on both sides of 
the deal (buyer and target).  We believe that such overlapping connections clearly demonstrate that the SZ5 
acquisition was an undisclosed related party acquisition.   


There are other connections between the supposedly independent sellers of the acquisition target and the Company.  
SAIC filings stated that the sellers were two entities which each owned 50% of Shenzhen Yaode: Yaode Investment 
Management (Shenzhen) Enterprise (Limited Partnership) (“Yaode Investment”) and Shenzhen Rui De En Investment 
Enterprise (Limited Partnership) (“RDN”).

2017.

on both sides of the deal (buyer and seller). Far from being an independent third party, such connections strongly 
indicate, in our opinion, that the acquisition was an undisclosed related party transaction.

SAIC filings also indicate that the Company significantly inflated the value of the acquisition, leading us to believe 
that Company insiders used the undisclosed related party transaction to simply loot public money for personal gain. 


GDS stated in its SEC filings that it acquired Shenzhen Yaode and the rights to the data center it operates (SZ5) for 
RMB 312 million.3   


Yet SAIC filings show that on June 21, 2017, Shenzhen Yaode’s shareholders agreed to transfer 100% of their 
shareholdings to GDS’s subsidiary, Beijing Wanguo Chang’an Science & Technology, for a total consideration of 
only RMB 500,000.  


 
Source: Shenzhen Yaode SAIC Filings 


SAIC filings clearly state that Shenzhen Yaode’s sellers, RDN (50%) and Yaode Investments (50%), transferred their 
shares to the Company’s subsidiary for RMB 500,000, not RMB 312 million as the Company stated in its SEC 
filings.   


The consideration was so small because Shenzhen Yaode’s paid-in-capital was RMB 0 at the time.  Shenzhen Yaode’s 
SAIC files state that it was incorporated in April 2016, but that its founding shareholders did not contribute any capital 
to the entity at incorporation.  Capital contributions, oddly, were to be made some time before December 2019.   





                                                           
3 The Company claims that with respect to the SZ5 acquisition, it paid RMB 70 million as of December 31, 2017, and stated in its 
FY 2017 20-F filing that it expects to pay the remainder of the consideration.  No time frame was given for the payment of the 
contingent consideration (or even the contingent amount), so it is possible that some of the announced purchase price has yet to be 
paid.

Financial statements in Shenzhen Yaode’s 2016 SAIC filings also show that shareholder equity was RMB 0.

In sum, SAIC filings indicate that the Company acquired Shenzhen Yaode, an entity with minimal paid in capital and 
zero shareholder equity, for RMB 500,000, not RMB 312 million as the Company claimed in its SEC filings.  That 
the acquisition appears to be an undisclosed related party transaction suggests, in our opinion, that insiders likely 
inflated the purchase price to simply loot shareholder money.

2) Guangzhou 2 Acquisition 


On October 9, 2017, the Company acquired a target group of companies that owned a data center project in Guangzhou 
(“GZ2”), supposedly for RMB 234 million.  Like the SZ5 acquisition discussed above, SAIC filings indicate that the 
real purchase price of the acquisition was substantially less than GDS claimed in its SEC filings.

The Company was coy about the identity of the acquired companies, but from its 20-F it is clear that the acquired

SAIC filings for Weiteng Network, the acquired PRC entity which operates the GZ2 data center, state that its 
shareholders Chen Lieyong and Guangzhou City Haoxi Technology Service Company (Limited Partnership) 
(“Haoxi”), actually sold Weiteng Network to GDS for only RMB 72 million.   
 
The data center was already complete at the time of the transaction, so we think it is safe to conclude that the purchase 
price reflected in the SAIC filings reflected the actual value of the underlying asset.

Because SNT’s shares were traded OTC in China and the disposition was material to its business, SNT released an 
Asset Sales and Material Asset Restructuring Report (the “Restructuring Report”) describing the value of Weiteng 
Network (and its data center GZ2).   


This report stated unequivocally that the fair value of Weiteng Network, as of June 30, 2017, was only RMB 70.4 
million.  Notably, this corroborates SAIC filings which state that GDS purchased Weiteng Network for RMB 72 
million.   


 
Source: Assets Sales and Material Assets Restructuring Report, September 8, 2017 


On the next page, we include a timeline showing the discrepancy between GDS’s claims regarding the acquisition and 
the documentary evidence from PRC public records.  At the time GDS claimed it acquired GZ2, PRC records show 
that Weiteng Network was still owned by Haoxi and SNT.  Such records show GDS only acquired the data center a 
month later, and at a much lower purchase price than the Company reported in its SEC filings.  


According to the bank document public company (SNT) provided, Mr. Chen and 
Haoxi transferred the consideration to SNT on October 17, 2017 and October 19, 
2017, respectively. The consideration was determined by the “Equity Transfer 
Agreement” and the additional agreement.

SNT’s Restructuring Report also indicates that GDS, in addition to inflating the purchase price of the transaction in 
its SEC filings, also inflated the value of the acquired PP&E.   


According to GDS’s FY 2017 20-F, the value of the PP&E acquired in the Weiteng Network and GZ2 acquisition was 
RMB 319.9 million as of October 9, 2017.

The data center was complete and operational at the time of the transaction, so SNT’s valuation should match GDS’s 
valuation of the PP&E in its SEC filings.  But it does not and it is not even close.  SNT reported that Weiteng Network’s 
PP&E was worth only RMB 167.6 million.  GDS said in its SEC filings that the acquired PP&E was worth RMB 320 
million, a 91% inflation in only 3 months.   


It is highly unlikely that Weiteng Network purchased RMB 152 million worth of property and equipment in that three-
month gap between the Restructuring Report and GDS’s acquisition, as Weiteng Network had neither the cash nor the 
financing to almost double its PP&E in such a short time.5 


 
Source: GDS FY 2017 20-F, SNT Filings, Blue Orca Calculation 


There is also evidence that GDS overstated the revenues of the acquired assets.  In its FY 2017 20-F, GDS stated that 
Weiteng Network contributed RMB 26.6 million of revenue and RMB 2.7 million of net income in the last three 
months of 2017.  


 
Source: GDS FY 2017 20-F, p. F-36 


However, SNT’s Restructuring Report suggests otherwise. The report stated that prior to its acquisition by GDS, 
Weiteng Network’s data center was fully operational and had a contract to lease its space to China Mobile through 
July 2021.  Because the data center’s contract with China Mobile had fixed pricing, SNT’s Restructuring Report 
provided a sales forecast for Weiteng Network.

5 Weiteng Network’s estimated 3-month EBITDA is only RMB 11 million, which is not enough to fund the PPE purchase.  
6 SNT filings indicate that the G3 building is a 6-floor data center with a leasable area of 15,469 sqm.  The data center is only 6,131 
spm (according to GDS), meaning it must be inside this space.

Based on SNT’s forecasts, Weiteng Network’s actual revenues in that three-month period (Oct-Dec, 2017) should 
only be RMB 16 million, 40% less than what GDS reported. 


 
Source: Blue Orca Calculation 


On the basis of SNT’s forecasts, if we annualize the amount of overstated revenue from this acquired data center, we 
calculate that just this one case accounts for RMB 42 million in overstated revenues.   


SNT built the GZ2 data center and owned a majority stake in Weiteng Networks.  Not only does the SNT report 
indicate that the acquired group’s PPE was 48% lower, but that the revenue attributable to the data center was 40% 
lower than the Company reported in its SEC filings.   


a. Undisclosed Related Party Connections between GZ2 and the Company 
 


We found a number of overlapping connections prior to the acquisition between GDS, the acquisition target and its 
sellers, including common registered phone numbers and email addresses.  Entities with the same registered email 
addresses and phone numbers, in our opinion, are likely connected through common or overlapping ownership or 
control.   
 
First, GZ2’s seller, Haoxi, shared the same registered phone number as Company subsidiary WGYL prior to the 
acquisition.

Haoxi sold Weiteng Network and its GZ2 data center to GDS in October 2017.  Prior to the transaction, online 
corporate records clearly show that the seller had the same registered phone number as Company subsidiary WGYL.   
And there are other connections between the supposedly independent sellers of GZ2 and GDS.   
 
Recall that SNT owned a majority stake in Weiteng Network and built the GZ2 data center.  SNT disposed of its 
interest in Weiteng Network to Haoxi only a few weeks before it was acquired by GDS.  SNT’s phone number on its 
website is 0755-29374359.

RDN 2017 Annual Audit Report 





 
Source: Online Company Record Database 


 
As discussed in the previous section, SAIC filings indicate that GDS employees also worked for Shenzhen Yaode 
and RDN prior to GDS’s acquisition of Shenzhen Yaode and its data center SZ5.  We believe the evidence is 
overwhelming, therefore, that Shenzhen Yaode was secretly a related party.  
 
At the same time, Shenzhen Yaode (and its parent RDN) had the same registered phone number as SNT, which was 
in the process of building the GZ2 data center prior to its acquisition by GDS.  The alphabet soup of acquired entities 
and sellers is head-spinning, but the point is simple.

GDS acquired SZ5 (we think from related parties) in June 2017, and then acquired GZ2 from purportedly unconnected 
parties in October 2017.  These transactions are, supposedly, totally unrelated.  So why would the previous owners of 
each data center share the same registered phone number?  We think the answer is obvious: common registered phone 
numbers are evidence of overlapping or common control or ownership.   
 


 
In our opinion, the Company concealed connections showing an entwined web of overlapping interests and control, 
overstated the purchase price of the data center, and inflated the value of the acquired asset.  Much to the detriment of 
shareholders and creditors.   
 


3) Weiteng Data (GZ3) Data Center Acquisition 


In its Q1 18 results announcement, GDS disclosed that it acquired another data center in Guangzhou, (GZ3), for RMB 
262 million in May 2018.  In our opinion, this transaction is a repeat of the pattern observed above: overpaying for 
undisclosed related party acquisitions from entities secretly connected to the Company.

As usual, GDS did not disclose the identity of the target group or vendor of this transaction.  But evidence indicates 
that the acquired company was 广州市维腾数据科技有限公司 (“Weiteng Data”), which SAIC filings show was 
acquired by a GDS subsidiary in May 2018 (the same time the Company announced the GZ3 acquisition) and is 
located in the Guangzhou Innovation Park (the same location as the Company claims for GZ3 in its acquisition 
announcement. It was purchased at the same time and located in the same place as the Company’s GZ3 acquisition, 
so we can reasonably infer it is the acquired entity. 


However, SAIC filings indicate that the Company purchased Weiteng Data for far less than the purchase price it 
announced in its SEC filings.  SAIC filings state that rather than a total purchase price of RMB 262 million as the 
Company claimed, GDS actually acquired Weiteng Data and its data center from sellers Jiangle Xian Ronglong 
Business Management Consulting Partnership将乐县荣隆企业管理咨询合伙企业 and Yaode Investment for only 
RMB 40 million; 85% less than what GDS reported. 


 
Source: Weiteng Data’s SAIC Filings 


The Company claimed that the acquisition included RMB 245 million of contingent consideration, but the SAIC 
filings we reviewed make no mention of this.  There is a chance that some of this contingent consideration has not 
been paid, meaning there is a possibility for shareholders and creditors to limit losses from what we believe are 
obviously self-dealing transactions if they act quickly.   


Because evidence indicates that Weitang Data and GZ3 came from the same web of related entities as previous 
undisclosed related party acquisitions.   


Weitang Data’s records indicate that in 2016 (before it was acquired by GDS), it shared the same registered phone 
number as WGYL (a Company subsidiary) and Haoxi (another undisclosed related party).  Weitang Data also shared 
the same registered email address, pre-acquisition with Haoxi (according to online corporate records).

Common registered phone numbers, in our view, clearly indicate overlapping or common control or ownership.  That 
a supposedly independent acquisition target (Weiteng Data) used the same registered phone number as a Company 
subsidiary (WGYL) and another entity with ties to GDS (Haoxi) indicates, in our opinion, that this was another 
undisclosed related party acquisition.

There are more pre-acquisition connections between GDS, its target and supposedly independent sellers.  For instance, 
after June 2017, Weiteng Data’s registered phone number changed to the same registered phone number as Weiteng 
Network, which GDS acquired in October 2017.  Why would two supposedly unrelated acquisitions share the same 
registered phone number if they were not controlled by common ownership, especially when Weiteng Data had not 
even (supposedly) been acquired by the Company at that time?

In addition, Weiteng Data was 10% owned by Yaode Investments, one of the entities that sold SZ5 to the Company 
in 2017 (discussed at the beginning of this section).   Evidence strongly suggests that SZ5 was an undisclosed self-
dealing transaction.  If the seller of SZ5 was also a seller of GZ3, it supports the inference that GZ3 was likewise an 
undisclosed related party acquisition.

Ultimately, we found evidence that in 3 of the Company’s 4 post-IPO acquisitions, GDS not only overstated the 
purchase price of the acquisition but concealed connections indicating, in our opinion, that such acquisitions were 
made from undisclosed related parties.  By adding up the difference between the reported purchase price in GDS’s 
SEC filings and the purchase price listed in Chinese documents, we estimate that insiders looted at least RMB 696 
million from the public company since its IPO.

SERIAL CAPITAL RAISING AND CRUSHING DEBTS FOR OFF-SHORE CASH? 


Companies looting a public vehicle for shareholder money and/or fabricating financial performance are often serial 
capital raisers, even when they are supposedly profitable and even when they supposedly have ample cash on hand.  
That is because their reported profitability and solid operating metrics are largely illusory, and insiders need to raise 
money not only to keep the scheme afloat, but to line their own pockets.   


This was true of many of the companies we exposed in the China Hustle era, including textbook frauds like Universal 
Travel (NYSE: UTA), L&L Energy (NASDAQ: LLEN) and China Medical (NASDAQ: CMED).  


Since its IPO, GDS has been a serial capital raiser, returning again and again to the debt and equity markets to raise 
capital despite ample cash on its balance sheet.

Perhaps a rapidly growing company could justify such serial capital raising on the grounds that such cash is necessary 
to build or buy data centers.  Indeed, many fast-growing companies borrow to cover rising working capital needs, to 
expand infrastructure or to fund capital expenditures.  


But GDS is borrowing in China at interest rates up to 9.7%, just to earn less than 0.6% on an unused cash balance.

If GDS is incurring crippling levels of debt and diluting shareholders in order to fund the construction of new data 
centers, then we would expect the Company to keep the vast majority of its cash on-shore (in the PRC) in RMB.

After all, if GDS is building data centers in China, it will have to pay for such data centers in the country with the 
local currency.   


Yet GDS reports that over 76% of its cash-balance is held in currencies other than RMB, which contradicts the 
Company’s justification for its serial capital raising.   


 
Source: GDS F-1, GDS 2016 20-F, GDS 2017 20-F, GDS 2018 6-K, Blue Orca Calculation 


 
GDS also admits that it keeps over 65% of its cash balance off-shore, where it would be essentially useless if the 
purpose of raising such cash was to invest in and build data centers in China.  The imbalance is likely greater today, 
because the Company recently completed an off-shore bond issuance.   


 
Source: GDS F-1, GDS 2016 20-F, GDS 2017 20-F, GDS 2018 6-K, Blue Orca Calculation 


 
Why does a business that operates exclusively in China keep over 65% of its cash off-shore? In our report, we 
present evidence, which in our opinion indicates that GDS inflated the purchase price of undisclosed related party 
acquisitions.  We think it is reasonable to infer that they did this because insiders looted the difference between the 
stated and the actual purchase price.   


If your goal was to loot money from a U.S.-listed Chinese company, you would want to keep as much cash off-shore, 
and in currencies other than RMB, because of China’s strict capital controls.  In this case, the shoe fits.  GDS keeps 
the bulk of such cash offshore, were it is easily looted by insiders but useless for building a data center in China or 
operating its business.   


The detriment to shareholders is obvious.  GDS’s debts have almost tripled from FYE 2015 to Q1 2018, and its interest 
expenses now exceeds even its reported gross profits.

GDS’s interest coverage ratio 0.2x is significantly worse than almost all of its slower- or faster-growing peers.  GDS’s 
net debt/ LTM EBITDA ratio is equally dire.  At 9.4x it exceeds the ratio of each comp in our IDC peer group.

GDS’s debt levels are crushing, even when compared to other IDC providers.  If GDS truly borrowed such large 
amounts to grow its business, the majority of its cash would not sit off-shore where it is useless for the purposes of 
building or acquiring Chinese data centers.  In our view, GDS’s behavior is a significant red flag reminiscent of other 
US-listed Chinese companies whose share price collapsed amid evidence of malfeasance.

MOUNTING BALANCE OF UNBILLED RECEIVABLES 
 
In FY 2017, GDS reported that “unbilled receivables” comprised 70% of its accounts receivables and 16% of total 
sales.  GDS’s mounting balance of unbilled receivables are a significant red flag, not only because they comprise an 
increasing proportion of the Company’s receivables and revenues, but also because GDS appears to be a clear outlier 
among publicly-listed Internet data center providers.   


 
Source: GDS 2017 20-F 


 
GDS claims that unbilled receivables are created “due to the timing difference between the billing and revenue 
recognition.”  Essentially, GDS claims such receivables are created when it provides data center services for a 
customer prior to the end of the quarter or fiscal year but has not billed such customer for such service.   
 
What is unusual about this disclosure is that the proportion of unbilled receivables has, inexplicably, increased 
dramatically since the Company’s IPO.  In FY 2015, GDS’s unbilled receivables accounted for 41.7% of its 
receivables and only 6.6% of total sales.  Yet in just two years, by FY 2017, the balance of unbilled receivables has 
almost doubled to comprise 70% of total receivables and almost 16% of total Company sales.

Data center services are typically provided under long term contracts.  Revenues are therefore predictable and GDS 
states in its SEC filings that it bills on a monthly or quarterly basis.  So how can GDS explain why its billing practices 
deteriorated to the point where it is not billing customers for 70% of its uncollected revenues?   
 
Of the thirteen publicly listed IDC comps in our peer group, only two, to our knowledge, have disclosed any material 
balance of unbilled receivables in recent filings.

In FY 2014 and FY 2015, QTS Realty Trust (NASDAQ: QTS) disclosed that unbilled receivables consisted of less 
than 3% of the total receivables of an acquired company, Carpathia Hosting.  Notably, such unbilled receivables made 
up only a tiny percentage of Carpathia’s total balance, and QTS has not, to our knowledge, disclosed any unbilled 
receivables in the ordinary course of its core business.   
 
Another IDC provider, Digital Realty Trust (NASDAQ: DLR), also disclosed that an acquisition, Telx, had unbilled 
receivables.  But again, notably, DLR does not claim any unbilled receivables in the ordinary course of business on 
its public financial statements.   
 
GDS’s minority investor, CyrusOne (NASDAQ: CONE), mentions the term in its accounting policies but does not 
disclose any material balance of unbilled receivables in its 10-K.   
 


 
Source: CyrusOne 2017 10-K 


 
Although disclosure obligations are potentially different for Chinese-listed companies, we could not find an A-share 
IDC provider which disclosed a material balance of unbilled receivables.  Data centers are a commoditized space, so 
it raises the obvious question of why GDS’s billing practices are so different from industry norms.  If other IDC 
companies aren’t reporting such high proportions of unbilled receivables, why is that unbilled receivables comprise 
the vast majority of the Company’s uncollected revenues?  
 
It matters because unbilled receivables are more difficult to audit.  Auditors can check a paper trail of an invoice or 
bill to a customer against the services provided to such customer.  But if revenues cannot be tied to a specific invoice, 
the absence of a paper trail makes it more difficult to check the authenticity of the receivables and the underlying 
revenue.   
 
In our opinion, unbilled receivables corroborate evidence of fabricated revenues.   Recall that other data center 
operators sent us a brochure and quote for space in a data center GDS claims to operate exclusively and at a 94% 
utilization rate.  But third parties selling space in the same building indicates that GDS’s claims are not true.  We can 
assume that if the Company is overstating capacity and utilization, it is also overstating revenues and profitability.  
GDS’s mounting balance of unbilled receivables supports this investment thesis, because it would be easier to fabricate 
such revenues if GDS did not have to produce an invoice for auditors to verify.

MOUNTING PAYABLES BALANCE 
 
GDS’s reported balance of payables is also a significant accounting red flag.  Since going public, the Company’s 
reported days payable outstanding (DPOs) have ballooned from 205 to 470 days.  To put that in context, if GDS’s 
financials are true, on average it takes the Company almost 16 months to pay its suppliers.   
 
Such a payables balance is not only prima facie ridiculous, but it makes GDS an outlier compared to other IDC 
providers.  The average DPO for other publicly-listed Chinese data center providers was 221 days in 2017, but the 
median was lower at 109 days.7   By comparison, 21 Vianet (NASDAQ: VNET), which also operates carrier neutral 
data centers in China, reports DPOs of only 47 days.  VNET and GDS operate a similar business in a similar location, 
so why are GDS’s payables so much higher?  
 


 
* Accrued expenses or liabilities are included in the calculations 
Source: Companies Public Filings and FactSet 


 
GDS also cannot claim that such payables are the result of its acquisitions.  As per the Company’s purchase price 
accounting, only 25% of its accounts payable balance is comprised of payment obligations of acquired data centers. 
 


                                                           
7 We exclude from our calculation of DPOs the Company’s “other payables” and other long term liabilities, including contingent 
payments related to acquisitions.  If we include these items, the Company’s DPOs would be far higher.

Excluding any acquisition related payables, the Company’s DPOs are still 353 days.  GDS’s primary inputs are power, 
so this raises the question as to why GDS would get better terms than most other Chinese IDC providers from a state-
owned utility.   
 
We believe that inflated payables are a tell-tale sign of fabricated profits, and support evidence that the Company 
overstates the utilization rates of its data centers.   


VALUATION 


We believe that the evidence presented in this report indicates that GDS’s area in service and utilization rates are 
lower than the Company claims in its SEC filings.  First, we conducted a case study on one of GDS’s flagship data 
centers in one of its strongest markets.  GDS claims to operate the entire data center at a 94% utilization rate, with 
100% of the space already committed to customers.  To state the obvious, if GDS is telling the truth to U.S. investors, 
it should operate the entire building, and there should be no space available at the data center to lease.  
 
Yet two independent companies stated that they also operated portions of the data center, suggesting GDS does not 
have the entire building as it claims.  Furthermore, one operator offered to lease us material amounts of cabinet space, 
which again, would be impossible if GDS already had commitments for the entire data center.  In our opinion, such 
evidence directly undermines GDS’s claims regarding the area in service and the utilization of this flagship asset.   
 
There is never just one cockroach.  We think it’s fair to assume that if the Company is overstating utilization at one 
facility, it is likely doing so at other facilities.  If utilization and area in service are overstated, then so are reported 
revenues and profits.   
 
There is other evidence to suggest that the Company’s revenues are overstated.  GDS is a clear outlier among publicly 
listed IDC providers in that it claims 70% of its accounts receivables are comprised of unbilled receivables.  This 
amounted to 16% of GDS’s FY 2017 reported revenues, a staggering amount.  Compared to other publicly listed IDC 
providers, GDS appears to be a major outlier.     
 
Unbilled receivables, we believe, are ripe for abuse because without a direct invoice to the customer they are more 
difficult to audit.  It is our suspicion that the balance of unbilled receivables represents the amount of overstatement 
of revenues from overstated utilization and/or area in service.   
 
Accordingly, in our model, even though we give credit to the Company’s reported EBITDA margin of 30% (which 
we believe is also inflated), by assuming that GDS’s actual utilization is 20% less than reported (which is supported 
by the unbilled receivables and primary due diligence), we forecast that GDS’s actual EBITDA for FY 2018 will be 
RMB 551 million.

Source: Blue Orca Model based on our Estimates and Due Diligence 


Investors have indulged GDS’s debt burden and pushed its stock to absurd valuations because of the belief in its 
supposedly impressive growth.  But our research indicates that in reality, GDS is borrowing crippling amounts of debt 
only to siphon off a portion of the cash to insiders and acquire data centers which are not nearly as valuable as the 
Company claims in its SEC filings.  
 
There are more reasons to question the Company’s supposed borrow-spend-grow model.  Over 65% of GDS’s cash 
balance is kept off-shore, making it useless to a Company operating exclusively in China which is supposedly buying 
and building data centers exclusively in the PRC.  Such off-shore cash only makes it easier for insiders to siphon 
money through self-dealing transactions.  Why is the Company paying up to 9.7% interest to borrow money in China 
only for the Company to collect 0.6% or less in interest on a cash balance kept were it cannot be used to grow or 
operate a PRC business?  
 
Accordingly, we believe that GDS’s growth story, which has made it a market darling, is likely illusory.  We think it 
is smarter to compare the Company on an EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple to slower growing data center operators.  
For our model, we therefore assign a generous forward multiple of 20x.   
 
But it is not so simple because overstating the price of related party acquisitions is reminiscent of the worst US-listed 
Chinese companies which collapsed in the China hustle era of 2010-2011.  In the months after its IPO, GDS reported 
six data center acquisitions for a total consideration of RMB 1.18 billion.  Based on our review of SAIC filings and 
other publicly available records, we believe that GDS inflated the value of such acquisitions by at least RMB 696 
million, and that is without being able to verify 3 of the 6 transactions.  SAIC filings and other publicly available 
public records indicate, in our opinion, that 3 of the 4 major post-IPO acquisitions were undisclosed related party 
acquisitions.

Such transactions show a contempt for the basic values required to be a public company, so we also apply a 25% 
governance discount on this multiple.  Taking our EBITDA forecast together with what we believe is a more accurate 
utilization rate, we then apply this multiple to reach our valuation.

GDS’s debt burden is so significant that in Q1 2018, its interest payments exceeded even the gross profits reported in 
its SEC filings.  Based on the evidence in this report, we believe that such financials are not credible.  The profits 
may be fake or inflated, but the debt is real.   
 
After subtracting net debt, we value GDS’s ADR’s at $4.32 per share, an 87.6% downside from its last traded 
price.  Our valuation shows, given GDS’s crippling debts, the sensitivity of its share price to small tweaks in the basic 
assumptions about the Company’s growth, utilization, and trading multiple.  We also think our model is likely 
conservative.   
 
Given management’s shattered credibility, GDS’s crushing debts, and evidence that the Company is inflating the 
performance and value of its data centers, we could easily see GDS’s equity going to $0.00.
