Miller Energy: Digging Itself Into Another Deep Hole?
Dec. 24, 2013 3:13 AM ET12 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Miller Energy Resources (Nasdaq: MILL) sure has proven one thing to the world, and it's
not the tremendous value of the discarded oil reserves that the company picked up for
next to nothing after more sophisticated players said, "No, thank you," either. Rather, as a
bleeding energy firm buried underneath a mountain of expensive debt - with that weighty
burden set to grow even heavier in a matter of weeks - Miller has by now established that,
if nothing else, it certainly knows how to dig itself into a dangerous hole.


Take the daunting challenge that Miller will face next month, just for starters. Desperate for
cash earlier this year and now on the hook for the promises that it made in order to secure
those essential funds, Miller must somehow find a way to come up with $75 million by the
end of January in order to avoid loan-shark interest rates (approaching the 20% mark) on
every bit of the bank debt that the firm currently owes. For a company with barely $20
million to its name right now - and commitments to cover not only the double-digit interest
payments that it already owes to both its lenders and its preferred stockholders but also
the $60 million that it just pledged for a major acquisition to boot - Miller can hardly afford
for its hairy predicament to grow even worse at this point.


To Chapman Capital Founder Robert Chapman, the former boss of Miller President/Acting
CFO David Voyticky and an obvious skeptic of both the company and its senior
management team, Miller barely even resembles a normal energy firm since it focuses so
much of its attention on raising capital that it seems to market its stock as its primary
product while selling a little bit of oil on the side.


"The gross production numbers are not big - they're tiny - and the company is still cash-
flow negative (from operations combined with necessary capitalized investments), so it
has to keep selling this story about its monstrous reserves," Chapman recently noted
during a revealing interview with TheStreetSweeper about the five-month period when he
employed Voyticky as a partner at his firm and found the future Miller executive too
incompetent (or unwilling) to fulfill the transactional activist, non-investor relations duties
required of that post.


"In the meantime, just look at the company!” Chapman declared. “It’s a preferred stock-
issuance machine that seems to be more in the business of raising money than making
money. And to me, it looks like a stock that's driven by a myth."

Like other dubious investors, Chapman refuses to buy that story. Indeed, Miller strikes the
fund manager as a dangerous company that has placed its trust in an executive that
(based upon his own firsthand experience) lacks any substantial skills outside of his ability
to raise capital by "smooth-talking investors and lenders into parting with their funds."


“With Voyticky involved,” Chapman bluntly proclaimed, “I can’t think of many better targets
for a short.”


Don't mistake Bristol Capital Advisors as a noble savior just because that "activist" firm
suddenly feels driven to overthrow the current leadership due to its alleged incompetence
and obvious greed, either. After all, Bristol secured its sizable stake in Miller courtesy of
lucrative consulting deals originally awarded - but recently cancelled - by the same
boardroom directors that the "outraged" firm now aims to replace with a brand-new slate
of its own.


If history serves as any guide, Miller could pay a rather steep price for that intervention
should Bristol ultimately succeed.


A notorious firm led by Paul Kessler - a former consultant to the company -- that often
caters to obscure firms in the penny-stock arena, Bristol has regularly provided welcome
cash to desperate microcap players that later wind up in agonizing pain. They often face
the threat of massive dilution or, if dogged by accusations of outright fraud, can go
completely bankrupt instead. Their shares may sink to mere pennies (or even lower),
history shows, with regulators sometimes stepping in to block them from trading
altogether.


By now, Miller has already shown that the company can make a big enough mess without
that sort of "help" all by itself. Back when its stock weathered a nasty hit on a revealing
investigative report published by TheStreetSweeper two years ago, after all, Miller
responded with such a reckless move - prematurely assuring the market that its
independent auditors had verified the gigantic reserves listed on its balance sheet - that
the company practically sent its battered shares into a full-blown death spiral. Despite that
harrowing experience, however, Miller still acts like a company that never learned its
lesson at all.


In short, Miller seems just as tempted as ever to pump more than ordinary crude oil.


Take the impressive figures that Miller released to investors ahead of its latest quarterly
report, for example. After rushing to pre-announce that it had sold "over 200,000 barrels"
of oil during its most recent quarter, Miller has since followed up with actual results

showing that the company never even produced that much oil in the first place. While
Miller scrambled to address that disparity with a rather vague explanation, suggesting that
it may have included sales of oil from its previous inventory in that total, the company
basically undermined even that handy excuse by posting revenue figures that failed to
reflect any contribution from that excess supply.


With its stock already riding a powerful wave of momentum by the time that the company
presented that update, impressing bullish analysts who somehow overlooked its curious
math, Miller kept right on flying to hit a record high just shy of the $9 mark - almost triple
the price that it had commanded at beginning of the year -- and only lost its steam when
the proxy battle erupted to knock the wind out of its highflying shares. Even after an ugly
haircut that chopped its stock by 15% last week to end around $7.50 a share, however,
Miller still boasts a handsome $340 million market value that strikes many financial
experts as far too generous for a bleeding oil company with relatively modest production
but incredibly burdensome debt.


By assigning a reasonable valuation to its oil reserves and then subtracting its mountain of
debt from that total, one hedge fund manager recently calculated, the true value of Miller
lies somewhere between a measly $17 million on the conservative end of the spectrum
and $107 million on the very highest end of that broad range. With almost 50 million fully
diluted shares at last count, those figures suggest, Miller should trade as a lowly penny
stock fetching as little as 35 cents and no more than $2.20 a share - or 70% less than its
current price - at the absolute best.


“Nobody else wanted to buy those assets anywhere near the price Miller paid, much less
where they are valued by the company today,” he reminded. “They figured there was
nothing highly valuable there (after estimating the size of the reserves and the costs
associated with extracting the oil).


"What Miller did was kind of ingenious, actually. When you buy reserves, it's something
that's inherently ambiguous. You don't know how much oil you have under the ground,
how much it will cost you to produce it or how much you will be able to charge for it, either.


"So you don't know quantity, cost or price. Those are three big levers that you can pull
when you're estimating the value of reserves to arrive at a really big number. (But) nobody
really knows how much those assets are actually worth."


While its reserves looked wildly overvalued back when TheStreetSweeper first
investigated the company a couple of years ago, since it bought those abandoned assets
for a paltry $4.5 million and then miraculously valued them at a whopping $350 million on

its balance sheet, Miller has since boosted that enormous valuation to even more
staggering levels and prompted its stock price to swell right along with it. Miller has staged
such a dramatic come-back over the course of the past year, in fact, that the company had
already recaptured the attention of TheStreetSweeper even before Bristol declared war on
its current leadership team. After heightening its scrutiny of Miller over the past several
months, TheStreetSweeper recently escalated its surveillance of the controversial firm by
launching yet another full-blown investigation of the company.


Think of this alert as a mere preview, a free trailer warning investors of potential danger in
advance, as TheStreetSweeper continues to gather revealing information about not only
Miller itself but also those now fighting to control the embattled oil firm. To be sure, by
extending the same riveting plot introduced in its first investigative report on the company -
and casting an even brighter spotlight on prominent members of that notorious cast -
TheStreetSweeper could easily produce a sequel that lives up to the original by delivering
some powerful punches of its very own.

who chopped the interest rate in half. The dissident stockholders say that the stock is under-valued, not inflated. Your

Plus Miller should post close to $30 million in sales next quarter unless a pump goes out with more coming online
each quarter. The reserves are not only there, there is more than anyone thought at the time of the purchase. Of
course why bother with facts.

I think it's pretty obvious the so-called "concerned shareholders" are nothing but the stalking horse for the Pack Of
Perps who had their eyes on the Alaska assets when Boruff made his brilliant coup and snatched them out the
bankruptcy proceedings, and right out from under the Pack Of Perps' noses before they could even blink, let alone
realise what had happened. They'll NEVER forgive Boruff or forget how he beat them, and how badly he did so. Now,
it's close to Crunch Time, as Miller continues to prove up the Alaska assets and put them into production, and rather
substantial production, at that. The Pack Of Perps have to act and have to act fast, because the Window Of
Opportunity for them to steal the Company legally - and do so on the cheap - is rapidly closing. If they can't do it now,
during this temporary setback in the stock price, they'll have to pay .. oh, I don't know.. maybe $20... maybe $30....
maybe $50 ..... maybe ... well, it'll be MUCH more than the current price, and who wants to pay more than they have
to, in order to steal something legally, right ? Look for lots more hatchet jobs such as this one as the Obsequious
Toadies, Sycophant Sock-Puppets, and Apologising Acolytes of The Perps and the "concerned shareholders" rachet
up the pressure to help The Perps with their legal larceny.

I'm definitely not a fan of Boruff and Voyticky and their entitlements, but to ignore the increasing revenue, production
and proved up, by a third party firm, reserves is just foolish.


The game on all sides (CMS, Street Sweeper & Boruff) is obvious and I look forward to the short term hit on the price
to continue adding to my position.


I do find it amusing that Street Sweeper goes back to the old geologist in the original piece who said nobody wanted
to buy the assets when they were available. They obviously didn't have the working knowledge that David Hall had
with the fields.


As the revenue and reserves continue to increase Miller will be able to shortly get out from under their Apollo credit
agreement which has already had it's interest rate cut in half. Lower cost of capital, and lower production costs per
unit as more wells come online is what everyone sees.

What are the facts in this case? CMS raises some important questions as to the penthouse in Marina del Ray,
excessive comp (I would say "excessive" does not do it), shuffling the BOD members around, personal use of
airplane (which I do not believe is needed, considering the amount of time mgmt spends in Alaska, the apparent
cronyism w/i mgmt/BOD, etc. We have seen this on a much larger scale with CHK and SD and the CEO's were
bounced (finally). I have no doubt that IF MILL produces, s/h's will be supportive for awhile but to watch mgmt loot a
small company is somewhat disconcerting. I have no position, was long a pfd but bailed fairly quickly when I noticed
extreme levels of G & A expenses. There is a lot of background noise w/CMS, Streetsweeper, etc so the drama does
not lend itself to a stock that is attractive.

A very colorful story. But if the company is on the brink of bankruptcy, 
why are the stakeholders fighting over who will go down with the ship?  
SD and CHK got better after the individuals were replaced.

Stephen, I do not believe we have a major disagreement; my point was, maybe it should have been made
more clearer, is that IMHO the company is in trouble with the current mgmt and board, both of which are of no
credibility (excluding David Hall, who is hampered by more senior mgmt but does seem to know what he is
doing). As long as the current mgmt is in place, MILL will continue to take hits and the sharks will continue to
swim around with negative reports. With credible mgmt, which is not looking to loot the company via comp
and stk options, MILL could move ahead on its production results and cost cutting efforts.

If you think this stock is a good deal, buy it up. I personally know Scott Boruff and have known him for years. This is
something I doubt any of the cheerleaders on here can say. I would never invest in anything that Scott Boruff is part
of. His record speaks for itself. Again, if you like what you see about the way this company is being run and managed,
then buy all you can. However, I believe caution is your best friend in dealing with Boruff or anything he touches. The

In December 2009, when the deal was made, Brent prices were in the crapper. And so were oil stocks. Furthermore,
the world was still in the throes of the worst financial crisis in a century. There were plenty of assets on sale, and
fewer bidders with less cash. Just sayin'.
