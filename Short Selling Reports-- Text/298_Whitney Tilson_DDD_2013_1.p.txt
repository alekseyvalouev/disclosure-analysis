3D Systems: One of the Great Shorts in Market of
Massive Stupidity, Says Tilson


Over the transom this morning comes a missive from noted hedgy Whitney Tilson of T2 Partners,


arguing that shares of 3-D printer maker 3D Systems (DDD) are among the "great shorts" that exist,


trading at 17 times projected revenue.


Tilson's missive cites a hearsay comment from 3D Systems CEO Abraham Reichental that he finds


stunning:


Ya can't make this stuff up! From a friend who met with the CEO of DDD (not some penny stock, but an


$8 BILLION company): Avi told me during a 1x1 that "his company is 50% technology, 20% innovation


and 30% awesomeness."


What is the appropriate discount rate to apply to "awesomeness"?

Remember that line – it's a classic; like Chuck Prince's infamous: "As long as the music is playing,


you've got to get up and dance." The only surprise is that Elon Musk didn't say it.


DDD is one of so many unbelievably great shorts out there right now. I haven't written it up (yet), but


Citron wrote an excellent report in February entitled, What do a Comb, an Egg Cup, and a Justin Bieber


Vibrator Have in Common? The stock is a much better short today, as it's up 26% since then but the


fundamentals are deteriorating and the company lowered guidance in its last earnings report. But that


hasn't deterred the bulls, as it trades within a few percent of its all-time high, at 17.2x REVENUES, 64x


trailing EBITDA, and 63x next year's earnings estimates.


Tilson goes on to write that he has "sure taken my lumps on the short side recently (really, since March


9, 2009), but I'm not deterred (call me a glutton for punishment)." He thinks today's market is "the best


environment to find great shorts since March 2000 (even better than Oct. 2007)."


"Everywhere I look, I find massively stupid, fraudulent and/or overvalued stocks." Tilson notes that he is


appearing tomorrow, Wednesday, at a Harvard Business School Club of New York forum to discuss


various short selling ideas.


Shares of 3D Systems were in the green earlier in the session but slipped after Tilson dispatched his


missive. The stock is now down 67 cents, or 0.9%, at at $76.22.
