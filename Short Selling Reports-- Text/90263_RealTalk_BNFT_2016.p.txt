Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Tech


BNFT


The acquisition thesis doesn't add up, and ZERO sizable hedge funds are betting
on Benefitfocus.


Realizable revenue is only ~3% of purported TAM due to significant competitive
disadvantages, underwhelming PEPM (Employer Segment), and a likely broken
business model (Carrier Segment).


Adj. EBITDA is being shamelessly inflated via related party dealings.


Stabilized earnings suggest >50% downside, assuming management's aspirational
income statement hopes come to fruition.


Extra credit: CFO turnover heightens the risk profile for investors.

8/8/22, 10:00 PM Benefits In Focus _ >50% Downside For Benefitfocus Shareholders (NASDAQ _ BNFT) _ Seeking Alpha

Benefitfocus (NASDAQ:BNFT) was founded in 2000 as an American Pensions "dot
com" venture and went public in 2013 (taking advantage of the JOBS Act). BNFT
provides a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service related to health benefits for Employers
and Carriers (two segments). Products for Employers include Benefitfocus Marketplace,
ACA Compliance, and eBilling. Products for Carriers include Marketplace, eExchange,
eSales, Analytics, and enrollment and billing.


BNFT is focused on businesses with 1,000+ employees (18,000 potential customers)
and carriers with a significant customer base. Significant Employer customers include
Brooks Brothers, Columbia Sportswear, and Under Armour. Significant Carrier
customers include Aetna Life Insurance Company and Allstate Insurance Company.


The company was co-founded by Shawn Jenkins (current CEO), who was a vice
president at American Pensions when BNFT was founded. American Pensions is/was a
small corporate-sponsored retirement plans service company (minimal barriers to entry).


Although BNFT has sent more tweets than Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software
(PAYC) combined, its business model is inferior by just about every other metric (set
aside the Carrier segment for now, which is a low-growth business and recently turned
unprofitable).


This write-up won't shock you with legal findings, but is meant to serve up some Real
Talk regarding realizable revenue via a TAM analysis, questionable Adj. EBITDA vs.
EBITDA findings, stabilized earning potential & net present value, and of course, CFO
turnover.


I am short this stock because I believe its intrinsic value is 60%+ less than today's
market value... and that upon stabilization, BNFT will still only be worth ~45% of today's
market valuation.


RTI Price target: $20


Prior to discussing my investment thesis, I'd like to briefly share why I'm not scared of
the "acquisition target thesis" that has been promoted on StockTwits since at least 2014.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 3/19


I discuss BNFT's valuation on a standalone basis herein, but it's important to note why
the company isn't attractive to a player already in the space. Let's say I charge $15 per
employee per month (PEPM), and I acquire BNFT. Benefits probably makes up <10% of
my ERM suite, so calling my customers and saying, "We've significantly (over
statement?) upgraded our benefit-related software, are you willing to pay $5 more
PEPM?", seems audacious. Perhaps I can squeeze out an extra 10-20% ($1.5-3.0) if
they really like the new upgrades. The problem is that the company's Employer
Segment produces gross profit margins of <40%, therefore $1.5-3 is a loss on a gross
profit basis. Perhaps inroads with BNFT customers is interesting, but you have the same
general effect - gross margins are akin to a cow headed to the slaughterhouse. This
excludes the fact that it's reasonable for company management to assume that the only
way an acquisition is potentially interesting is if the acquirer can let go of nearly every
BNFT employee (discouraging a sale).


In my opinion, an acquisition thesis amounts to a "greater fool" argument and is wildly
speculative at best.


I'd also like to mention that there are absolutely ZERO sizable (requiring a 13F filing)
hedge funds making an outsized BNFT bet (based on % of portfolio estimates). There
are, however, a lot of top-down asset allocators whose benchmark is effectively their
peers. These are indexers who need exposure to the name because their peers have
exposure. If the stock collapses, hopefully they have less exposure; if it rips, hopefully
they have more exposure.


Prior to jumping into the numbers, I'd like to discuss BNFT's competitive position from a
qualitative, easy-to-understand, Real Talk perspective.


Qualitative Discussion



http://whalewisdom.com/stock/bnft-2
8/8/22, 10:00 PM Benefits In Focus _ >50% Downside For Benefitfocus Shareholders (NASDAQ _ BNFT) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 4/19


Although I generally agree that the TAM for the entire space is large, BNFT's piece of
the pie is almost certainly very small. Although the company has a "focus on employers
with 1,000+ customers" (this mirrors WDAY's advertised focused, which has garnered a
huge EV/rev premium), its offering doesn't seem to be designed for the best large
businesses. Let's assume you're an executive of a large corporation overseeing
ERP/payroll/HCM software decisions, and you've decided to upgrade to a cloud-based,
user-friendly SaaS offering. Do you want to have a different piece of software (cloud,
SaaS, or otherwise) for all of your needs? In other words, do you want one piece of
software that manages your payroll, another for recruiting, and yet another for benefits?
Or do you want an HCM suite that manages everything?


With no constraints, the answer is easy... you want one piece of integrated software,
and to prove it, you run a cost-benefit analysis that shows how much time/money it
saves in the long run versus segregated cheaper options. There are certainly
companies out there who don't mind multiple platforms or are willing to offer additional
benefits-only software to their employees, but I don't think it's absurd to consider that to
be the minority of large businesses.


Many 1,000+ employee businesses undoubtedly have constraints, so perhaps your
answer was "None of the above, I look at what my allotted spend is and buy what I can".
I believe that's one reason why BNFT has been able to generate customers during a
period of time when executives focus on increasing earnings through cost-cutting. By
way of example, the HR department requests an upgrade to their software, executives
give them a measly $5 or less PEPM spend, and the HR head finds BNFT in their
search for the coolest/hippest software out there at <$5. If/when the company eventually
upgrades to a full suite, it'll need to decide if its benefit-only software is worth the
marginal expense.


What about businesses with <1,000 employees? Who is servicing them? Historically,
Paychex (PAYX), Paycom, and Paylocity (PCTY) have served those smaller businesses.
But unfortunately for BNFT, they've been converting far larger businesses as of late.
PAYC was very explicit in its last quarterly earnings call:

Source: Seeking Alpha


What does this mean for BNFT? It means the company's convertible piece of the pie is
being squeezed from both ends. The ADPs and WDAYs of the world take the best
clients looking for cloud-based and/or SaaS options, and the PAYXs, PAYCs, and
PCTYs of the world battle it out for the businesses that have 2-5k employees (excluding
smaller businesses).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 6/19


This all adds up to BNFT's competitive position being tightly lodged between a
rock and a hard place. It doesn't help that all those other businesses are not only cash
flow-positive, but they have war chests that BNFT will only have if it sells more shares
(good for the short case)!


In summary, I believe BNFT is at a clear competitive disadvantage and will be
fortunate to achieve stabilized earnings of >$30 million. I will build up to this estimate via
a TAM analysis and leveling Adj. EBITDA with EBITDA, prior to making some minor
assumptions to arrive at 2020-ish earnings.


Note: For conservatism, I am assuming management can achieve its aspirational
income statement sizing, and I'm not making any dilution adjustments.


TAM Estimate (Employer and Carrier segments)


Employer Segment: Looking through the investor decks, you'll find one of the most
optimistic and (in my opinion) misleading TAMs you'll ever see. Management estimates
that the Employer segment TAM is $10 billion, based on 18,000 potential customers.
That equates to a per customer spend of about $556k, which seems reasonable
assuming we're talking HCM spend and/or use WDAY numbers as a guide. The
problem? BNFT is a benefit-only suite and thus only generates ~131k from its
employer customers (2015 10K). Further, the company's long-term aspirational PEPM
spend is only 1.56x today ($7.0 aspirational versus $4.5 FY2015). For reference, WDAY
garners about $1 million/customer, and its PEPM is likely >$15. PAYC's base PEPM is
$10 and its "full suite" is ~$20 PEPM.


Based on an aspirational spend, the TAM should be closer to $3.68 billion
($131k*1.56*18k) as far as BNFT is concerned (benefit-only offering). For simple
math, let's say 10 are competing for this business (at least that many offer benefit
solutions, including ADP, WDAY, ULTI, ORCL, PAYX, PAYC, PCTY, NSP, and TNET).
Therefore, BNFT's aspirational pro rata realizable revenue is ~$365 million. If it can't
"land and expand", the company's realizable revenue is ~$234 million (in-place PEPM
as of 2015). Let's assume the mid-point and say that BNFT's Employer segment
realizable revenue is ~$300 million.

Note: I think assuming a pro rata proportion of the pie is conservative given there are
more than 10 players (see one sell-side estimate below) and the competitive dynamics
discussed within the "Qualitative Discussion" above.


Piper Jaffray surveyed about a dozen "businesses in the market", and when asked to
allocate a PEPM specifically to "Corporate Wellness" as an isolated spend, the PEPM
survey doesn't bode well for BNFT (admittedly anecdotal and tough to tease out what's
truly considered):

Insurance Carrier Segment: The Insurance Carrier segment is admittedly tougher to
estimate. BNFT promotes a TAM of $5 billion, which means it's purportedly less than 2%
penetrated ($90 million of revenue in 2015). The Carrier business was profitable from
2010-2012 (turned into a loss in 2013, and BNFT stopped reporting segment profits
thereafter), rev/customer is nearly $2 million ($1.86 million in 2015), and there seems to
be less competition within this segment. Given the relative attractiveness and
purported penetration, management's lack of focus and growth forecasts related
to this segment are perplexing. Management team said it expects the segment to
grow at ~10% (management has been consistent since the IPO) and seems more
focused on the Employer segment throughout the investor deck and earnings calls.


This segment has grown at a CAGR of 9.3% over the last 5 years, and the most recent
quarter produced a 1% decline YoY. Qualitatively, I would argue that the Carrier
segment is susceptible to customer losses because BNFT uses open source software
(see language from the risk section of the 10-K below) and the company's
offering/partnerships with carriers are likely uneconomical for the Carrier (see
disclosures below and math within the next paragraph).


BNFT's largest customer (highly likely that it was a carrier, see support below)
accounted for 9.7% of revenue in 2015, which equates to nearly $18 million. Assuming
a 10Y life, no growth, and a 10% discount rate, the PV of those costs to the carrier
is $153 million+. From 2011 to 2015, BNFT only spent $141.25 million in R&D (both
segments included!). Therefore, its largest customer clearly ought to build its own
software!

Concentration comes from Carriers (in case rev/customer is too much of a leap):

For simplicity and conservatism, and despite the above PV analysis, I've assumed the
Carrier segment can grow at 10% per annum (a higher rate than that in the previous 5
years) and reaches stabilization around the same time that the employer segment
reaches stabilization.

Total BNFT stabilized-realizable revenue: I'm arriving at stabilized Employer segment
revenue of ~$300 million and stabilized Carrier segment revenue of ~160 million,
equating to ~$460 million of stabilized-realizable revenue. Assuming stabilization in
2020-ish, the resulting CAGR is ~20%, compared to a previous 5-year CAGR of 22.5%.
In order to estimate conservative earnings, it makes sense to consider management's
long-term income statement aspirations:


Source: Company filings


Given management's aspirational Adj. EBITDA margins of 20%, we ought to expect
stabilized aspirational Adj. EBITDA of ~$92 million. In order to use that number to
estimate future earnings, we first need to level Adj. EBITDA with EBITDA.


Adj. EBITDA:


Although the bull case is that SaaS companies garner a huge premium once they
become EBITDA-positive (perhaps Adj. EBITDA-positive), and BNFT is expected to be
Adj. EBITDA-positive in the fourth quarter of 2016, RTI is here to remind investors that
the devil is in the details.

For those looking at the recent quarter, you may have noticed that stock-based
compensation is on pace to nearly double in 2016. Is that in line with any other line
item? Not even close. It is however in line with historical stock-based compensation
growth. Stock-based comp was $1.2 million in 2013, $5.6 million in 2014, and $10.5
million in 2015. If you were one of the privileged folks who were able to buy the IPO at
$26.5 and sell within the first 6 months, you have done very well. If you bought and held
at the closing price of the IPO date (~$50), you've lost about 20%.


How does that compare to the high-flying PAYC? PAYC's management took $3
million in 2015 despite garnering 20% more revenue than BNFT ($185 million
versus $224 million) and achieving 1.4x the revenue growth. This excludes the fact
that PAYC is profitable (on a GAAP basis) AND produces CF! In other words, PAYC is
likely far more deserving of large stock-based bonuses.


Wouldn't shareholders run for the fences if they felt like management is overpaying
themselves? Not if everyone is focused on Adj. EBITDA. In fact, anyone interested in
the short-term stock price (assuming they believe the market is focused on Adj.
EBITDA) would be in favor of paying employees with stock in lieu of cash in hopes that
the market pays a premium once the company is Adj. EBITDA-positive.


Doesn't everyone "push" for better numbers, especially within non-GAAP metrics?
Perhaps this has become commonplace, but I believe there is more to the story when
considering BNFT's Adj. EBITDA numbers.


The major adjustment that management clearly has no excuse to be making is the
line item titled "Interest Expense on Building Lease Financing Arrangements".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 12/19


Although Interest expense is obviously excluded from EB"I"TDA, what about when it's
not really interest and we're considering a non-GAAP measure?


It seems as though management has chosen to effectively "exclude rent from
EBITDA" amounting to $7 million in 2015 (on pace for about the same in 2016).
Although treatment of the arrangement as interest is almost certainly a GAAP
requirement, Adj. EBITDA is a discretionary, Non-GAAP metric. Therefore, in my
opinion, this is a clear sign that management has chosen to boost a key
profitability metric given that the market pays a premium for EBITDA-positive SaaS
companies per research by SEG.


Although this decision is misleading, in my opinion, perhaps the "GAAP oddity" fell into
management's lap and they figured "What the heck, let's use it to our advantage".
Unfortunately for BNFT shareholders, the EBITDA adjustment in question is tied
to a related party dealing:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 13/19


Source: Company filings


In other words, management is not only using a GAAP oddity to their benefit when
reporting a non-GAAP metric, it also created the GAAP oddity of which they are
taking advantage!


Is there a real potential benefit to those who are involved? If the market takes Adj.
EBITDA positive as deserving of a premium (one may reasonably assume that if
EBITDA-positive earns a premium, Adj. EBITDA ought to earn a lower premium), then
Holland and Jenkins could make a lot of money sooner rather than potentially later. A
10% bump from today would be about $4/share, which equates to $11.6 million for
Jenkins and $11.2 million for Holland (excluding options, recent insider sales, etc.).
Although a relatively higher Adj. EBITDA could help the stock price in the short term, it
likely is not indicative of medium- to long-term value.


Although I believe management's treatment of Interest Expense on Building Lease
Financing Obligations should raise some eyebrows and serve as a significant red flag,
I've covered the above with the primary goal of leveling Adj. EBITDA and EBITDA so
that we can make future earnings estimates.


If Adj. EBITDA is expected to be ~20%, what is non-adjusted EBITDA? Do we
extrapolate these "rent deductions", and does stock-based comp grow at the same rate?
It's tough to say, so I've chosen to be conservative (again, from the shorts' perspective).

The recent annual filing shows Adj. EBITDA of -$32.2 million, but making the above
adjustments results in an estimated EBITDA of -$49.8 million (delta of $17.6 million).
Throughout the first six months of 2016, Adj. EBITDA is -$5.1 million, compared with
estimated EBITDA of -17.7 million (annualized delta of $25.2 million). The delta is
growing on both an absolute and % basis. For the sake of conservatism, let's assume
this trends stops and the absolute number holds steady with 2016's annualized delta of
~$25.2 million (declines dramatically on a % basis going forward):


Source: Company filings and RTI Graphics Department


Now that we've leveled Adj. EBITDA with EBITDA, we can estimate future earnings, and
thus, value.


Stabilized Earnings And NPV:


I previously built up to stabilized Adj. EBITDA of ~$92 million and estimated adjustments
to be about $25.2 million, therefore actual stabilized EBITDA should be around ~$66.8
million (EBITDA margins of 14.5%). Let's assume that interest-based income and
interest expense net out to $0, D&A equals 3% of sales (6% in 2015 down from 11% in
2011), and a tax rate of 40%. That leaves us with 2020-ish earnings of $31.8 million:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 15/19


Source: Company filings and RTI Graphics Department


Net Income of $31.8 million equates to margins of only 6.9%. You may be thinking,
"That can't be right, how can margins be so low?" I'd suggest looking at where
BNFT margins are today compared to their competitors, along with considering that the
company's aspirational margins are only 60-70% (15-20% lower than PAYC today!).


I see this as a reasonably conservative case (again, from the short perspective) upon
stabilization (estimated 2020-ish). If you'd like to take today's EBITDA multiples and slap
a value on BNFT in 2020, be my guest, but I'd recommend reading The Alchemy of
Finance, as I see that as a reflexive-like mistake.


Current ERP EV/earnings multiples are more reasonable, in my opinion, and are
between 19-23x.


Assuming a 10% discount rate, BNFT's residual value is worth $370-450 million today. I
have CF'd the business and estimate that average CF over the next 5-ish years will
equate to ~$22 million, with an NVP of ~$60 million.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012657-benefits-in-focus-50-percent-downside-for-benefitfocus-shareholders 16/19


Aggregate NPV = $60 million (5Y of CF NPV) + $410 million (Residual PV) = $470
million


Current EV is about $1.2 billion, which equates to a theoretical over valuation of ~60%
and premium to BNFT's stabilized value of about 45%.


The bull and the bear will undoubtedly disagree on the "right" discount rate, but it's
tough to refute that CFO turnover isn't deserving of at least a marginal discount rate
premium (which I consider to be excluded from the aforementioned 10% discount rate).


CFO Turnover


I don't want to speculate, but I think this is important. Therefore, I'll simply lay out the
facts.


Dennis B. Story entered into an agreement with BNFT on April 24, 2016 with a start date
of July 1, 2016. Mr. Story signed an agreement with MANH only 26 days after his start
date and 5 business days prior to his would-be first quarterly BNFT filing.

Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market


The company stated that Mr. Story resigned (effective immediately) for family reasons
on July 28, 2016.


A couple months later, Jeffery Laborde was brought on as the next CFO of BNFT, who
had been replaced at Infor a few months prior. For what it's worth, Laborde was
presumably expecting to make a lot more money at Infor than what he's been offered at
BNFT.


BNFT's CFO turnover could be nothing (especially given that on-boarding can take a lot
longer than Story's tenure with the company). But at a minimum, I'd say it's worth noting
as a potential red flag, and certainly justifies at least a marginally higher discount rate
than if Story had stayed with BNFT.


Summary


A reasonable EV for BNFT is about $450-490 million, which equates to a theoretical
over valuation of 60%+. Some may say, BNFT will grow into its current value, making it
neither a good short or a good long. I've estimated the company's stabilized EV to be
about ~$600-730 million, representing longer-term downside of 40-50%, making
BNFT a decent short. A great short candidate would offer a lower short interest and a
clear near-term catalyst. Based on likely CF needs, my gut tells me that
management may be working on another offering (this would be the third), which
could potentially end up being a near-term catalyst.


BNFT is clearly at a competitive disadvantage both qualitatively (between a rock and
a hard place) and quantitatively (margins, PEPM, CF generation), serving as a
significant tailwind for the short case.


The stock is also deserving of a discount due to the company's current CFO
turnover, which is excluded from my estimates.

P.S: Before you bring up the value related to BNFT's NOLs, I'm arriving at an NVP of $2-
3/share. I didn't include dilution in my estimate, so I thought, "Let's go crazy and exclude
the NOLs to level that out a little bit!"


Offering the world some REAL TALK when expectations equate to irrational exuberance.
