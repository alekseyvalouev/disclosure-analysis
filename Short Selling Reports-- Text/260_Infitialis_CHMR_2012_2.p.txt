Chimera Energy Part II: Pemex Denies Contract As Fabrications And
Lies Continue Deceiving Investors

Note: The accuracy of this article has been disputed.


In part 1 of this report we showed investors how a Houston-based stock scammer was
manipulating the advertising platforms of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo (YHOO), IAC
Interactive (IACI), and AOL (NYSE:AOL) to dupe investors into purchasing shares of a
worthless company: Chimera Energy (OTC:CHMR), which has no operations, no physical
office, one employee, and just $4,549 (no zeros omitted!) in equity based on its most
recent financial statements. Chimera claims to have acquired for a monthly fee of $5,000
a technology from a Chinese company whose existence we have been unable to verify. As
a matter of fact the only consistent theme encountered in our due diligence has been the
extent to which everything related to Chimera is either fabricated or lacks any credibility.


It has now been nearly two weeks since we first wrote about this company yet
gatekeepers and regulators have done nothing to stop the company from trading or
issuing false and misleading press releases. For this reason we have taken things into our
own hands and have uncovered additional smoking gun evidence relating to Chimera
Energy such as its fabricated relationship with Pemex; WEIS, S.A being a figment of
Charles Grob imagination; and the identity of the lawyer who acted as a gatekeeper to
Chimera.


Originally part 2 of this report was supposed to cover Nova Mining (NVMN.OB) the sister
fraud to CHMR operated by the same promoters. However after receiving over a dozen
emails from investors that had been duped and suffered losses we decided to dig even
further and bring to light additional revelations relating to CHMR in the hope that investors
reading this will stay away and/or get out while they still can.


Here is an example of one email from an elderly investor aged 74:

Greetings:


Excellent article. A short time ago, I had read the press release and viewed their
video. Knowing the fracking uproar from environmentalists and local governments, a
waterless procedure seemed to be a promising enterprise.


This week I had intended to watch the stock and perhaps purchase some. Based on
your article, I now am aware that the company is a scam and have saved some of
my limited investment money. [It provides my retirement income now.]


I agree with you that the companies that take their advertising $$$ should be more
aware of them and do something to police them in some way. However, even more
important is that there should be some way to get the SEC or other governing
agency to take "immediate" action to stop them. These companies should be vetted
prior to being able to be listed on any brokerages or OTC stock lists.


What they are doing is the same as a bank-robbery-in-progress by defrauding the
elderly [like me at 74 yrs old]. I know there is a state law in FL, where I live, and
possibly many more states, where it is a crime to defraud anyone over 65.


Taking money from people living in more than one state should involve inter-state
commerce and the FBI should also have jurisdiction.


Please keep up the good work and spread the word other journalists to keep their
eyes out for similar set-ups to then write articles like yours to expose them.


You saved me a little money this week and I want to thank you for that. You are a
credit to your profession. Seeking Alpha is one of my favorite companies and one I
trust very much.


Name Withheld


One must ponder how an educated elderly man who is able to write so eloquently was
almost duped, only to be saved by an article written by Infitialis.


The answer is that CHMR appears to be an internet based fraud that uses gatekeepers to
manipulate the appearance of the company via the internet. Even educated investors that
attempt to uncover any truth to the company are met with thousands of articles that are
strategically distributed with relevant keywords to disguise any negative postings or press
articles. It is nearly impossible to combat this wave of "spin" that is applied for related
keywords. Even worst the perpetrators of this scam have hired message board posters on

Yahoo! Finance and various investor sites to constantly, almost 24/7, post only positive
one liners about the company. In this way investors complaining about losses get pushed
down with conjecture-filled posts updated almost every hour and placed at the top of the
page.


Does Charles Earl Grob Even Exist?


Since the date our piece was published we have tried to reach Charles Grob the CEO of
Chimera each and every day calling the virtual office and another number we found. Not
once has anybody answered nor have any of our voicemails been returned. Several other
investors have confirmed that they have not once heard from Charles Grob. A secretary at
Servcorp, the virtual office company used by Chimera to answer the phones, told us that
she has never met Charles Grob and that as far as she knew he had signed up for the
service over the internet.


The Gatekeepers


In part 1 of our report we focused on Google as the primary gatekeeper and facilitator of
this scam. After having witnessed the full extent of how this machine works we can
provide even more insight into the gatekeepers that are allowing Chimera to perpetuate
this apparent fraud on the investing public as well as provide an update from our efforts to
contact these gatekeepers.


1. Google , Yahoo , IACI , and AOL: These companies through their respective ad
networks continue to serve ads targeting elderly investors with "fixed interest savings"
and "safe mutual funds" as keywords. We have made an attempt to contact all 4
companies yet they have not pulled the ads. Only Rupert Murdoch's WSJ responded
swiftly and subsequently pulled the ads. Investors that have been hurt by these ads
should consider filing a class action against the search engines as they have had
plenty of time to react to complaints as evidenced by WSJ.


2. Business Wire: We are very disappointed with Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A)
Business Wire as it continues to disseminate press releases containing total
fabrications of companies, contracts, and human beings that do not exist. We have
been told by investors that have reached out to both Berkshire Hathaway and
Business Wire that they have been looking into the issue and have elevated it to their
legal departments, yet we continue to see CHMR issuing press releases daily using
these sources. CHMR's account representative in Houston Jessica Anderson has told
CHMR investors that it is not her job to verify the authenticity of the content her clients

decide to publish. This logic is unacceptable in our view and inconsistent with the code
of ethics set forth in Berkshire Hathaway s website:


Specifically, Warren Buffett states:


""…I want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any
contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper - to be
read by their spouses, children and friends - with the reporting done by an informed
and critical reporter.""


No less than 3 investors we know contacted Business Wire in Houston bringing to their
attention that CHMR was an apparent fraud and that even the phone number on the
bottom of the press releases didn't work yet Business Wire continues to collect $1,500 per
press release as they plaster these fabrications all over the world. At the least we would
expect Business Wire to prevent CHMR from tacking on the symbols of major energy
companies in each press release they issue.


Business Wire is one of the most strategic pieces in the puzzle as it allows the promoters
to put out a constant barrage of fake news daily. Each time they do this the press releases
get picked up by RSS feeds and blogs and reverberate through the Internet ranking much
higher than any other literature on the company, including this Seeking Alpha piece.


3. Law Offices of David Loev - David M. Loev, age 42 is the lawyer from Houston that
filed the paperwork with the SEC to take public a company with $97k in cash. Mr. Loev
is the gatekeeper, without him a company like Chimera would have never been public.
Since Dodd & Frank the SEC has made it an issue to prosecute gatekeepers with the
same wrath as the perpetrators of financial fraud. In this article readers can review
some of the steps that have been taken against gatekeepers. We believe that the SEC
should look into the activities of David Loev as he is the gatekeeper who had the
audacity to create these securities in the first place. Should the SEC pursue action
against Mr. Loev it would not be the first time. In 2005, Mr. Loev was sued by the SEC
for writing opinion letters on a Pump and Dump called Integrated Services. A key line
from the SEC complaint was this:


"Loev was issued shares in the ISVG offering and sold certain of these shares in the
open market for approximately $25,000 in net proceeds."

enjoining him from violating the Securities Act's registration provisions and directing him to

The Pemex Contract Does Not Exist and Pemex Executives Deny any Relationship

Since August 9th, 2012, CHMR has issued no less than 9 Press Releases through
Business Wire claiming they had signed a deal with Mexican energy giant PEMEX. Here

https://seekingalpha.com/article/829951-chimera-energy-part-ii-pemex-denies-contract-as-fabrications-and-lies-continue-deceiving-investors 6/16


Quotes from these releases include:


1. "executed a Memorandum of Understanding with PEMEX" (8/9/2012)
2. "been scheduled to directly meet with PEMEX" (8/10/2012)
3. "direct meetings with PEMEX " (8/13/2012)
4. "oversee the integration of CHMR's new Non-Hydraulic Shale Oil Extraction


system with PEMEX " (8/14/2012)
5. "PEMEX has already identified three Chicontepec Formation wells for use of


Chimera's…" (8/15/2012
6. "Chimera Energy Corp and PEMEX have been in meetings in Mexico city this


week" (8/15/2012)
7. "where PEMEX and Chimera have begun to collaborate on utilizing CHMR's


revolutionary exothermic…" (8/20/2012)
8. "announced the receipt of the official signed document from PEMEX" (8/23/2012)
9. ""I am elated to have this signed official document physically in my hands."


(8/23/2012)


Let's be serious for a moment. No legitimate company issues 9 press releases in 11
trading days. It's simply unheard of. Moreover it would be crazy to even entertain the idea
that Pemex, a multibillion dollar company, would meet Charles Grob to use a technology
he purchased for $5,000 per month less than 30 days ago from a Chinese company
whose existence cannot be verified.


This is all a blatant attempt to trick investors into purchasing shares at a price that
exceeds the $.0038 paid by the owners of the 20,000,000 free trading shares.


But in the interest of entertainment let us for a moment pretend that somehow someway
31-year old Charles Grob, the sole employee of Chimera Energy pulled it off. Wouldn't you
assume that the investor relations department for Pemex would know about this epic and
revolutionary development?


On August 22nd, we called the investor relations department for Pemex and spoke to Mrs.
Carmina Moreno, one of the Investor Relations Managers. She told us that they are fully
aware that Chimera Energy has been touting this hypothetical relationship and that under
no circumstance did they have any contract or relationship with Chimera. She told
us that Pemex's legal department had started looking into this and that they would
consider making a public response as too many investors were calling to ask about this
and it was beginning to concern Pemex. We then put out a tweet to investors on our

twitter page warning them that investor relations at Pemex denied the existence of any
relationship or contracts with Chimera and provided the email and phone number of Mrs.
Carmina Moreno for anyone to verify themselves.


On August 24th we received an email from an investor who recorded a conversation with
Rolando Galindo - head of investor relations at Pemex. We urge all investors to listen to
this conversation as it is yet another piece of smoking gun evidence that confirms there is
no relationship between Chimera and Pemex and that the contents of the press release
are a complete fabrication:


Recorded Conversation with Rolando Galindo - Head of IR for Pemex:


Chimera Energy not only touts a fake relationship and contract with Pemex it has a logo of Pemex


on their investor website. This is the page investors land on from the pay per click ads. Also note the


fake quote from USA Today by Charles Grob. The audacity of these perpetrators has never before


been encountered by Infitialis.


WIES S.A. And Valdamar Perez Rios Do Not Exist


Since August 14th CHMR has been mentioning an outfit named "WEIS S.A." headed by a
Valdamar Perez Rios. Chimera has gone so far as to call WEIS an energy "stalwart" in its
press releases. Since August 14 we have spent an average of one hour per day searching
for the existence of both WEIS S.A and/or Valdamar Perez Rios. We have searched US
Corporate Records, Panamanian Corporate Records, Mexican Corporate Records as well
as every other tool at our disposal. WEIS S.A simply does not exist as a registered entity.
As for Valdamar Perez Rios, we have found an individual named Valdemar with an "e" but

https://seekingalpha.com/article/829951-chimera-energy-part-ii-pemex-denies-contract-as-fabrications-and-lies-continue-deceiving-investors 8/16


no Valdamar with an "a" as is spelled in the press releases. Mr. Rios is supposed to have
attended the "University of California San Jose" where he graded with a "Master Degree in
Chemical Engineering".


Our research found that there is no University by that name. There is the San Jose State
University but there is absolutely no UC School named UC San Jose. This link provides
the names of all UC Schools.


Either Chimera is purposely misspelling the names and schools of Valdamar Perez Rios
so that they are not contacted or our belief is that the two simply do not exist. We believe
that just as with the Pemex relationship, WEIS S.A. and Mr. Rios are a figment of Charles
Grob's imagination serving as additional fuel for this fraudulent scheme.


How to Catch a Predator


We set out to merely expose what we thought was a small time fraud preying on
unsophisticated investors but have uncovered something bigger and more predatory than
we had imagined. As such we began to think how we could decipher the true identity of
the perpetrator of this fraud. Given that Charles Grob was not answering our calls we had
literally no leads to follow with the exception of the Marshall Islands companies mentioned
in Part 1. David Loev had been unhelpful as well clinging to his attorney client privilege
instead of using the opportunity to be a whistleblower and possibly even clearing his
name.


We knew the answer existed somewhere. As Mathematicians we reached to one of our
favorite quotes "Invert always Invert" by the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi. Jacobi,
when met with difficult mathematical equations liked to invert the math and found that
doing so would occasionally provide a more convenient solution to the problem.


In our case if we invert the equation we find more clarity in our route to uncover the
identity of the perpetrator of this scam.


Let us review the constants:


1. The objective here is to sell worthless shares purchased for $.0038 at inflated values
to unsuspecting investors.


2. As such the perpetrator is most certainly the largest net seller of shares in the
company.


3. Identifying the largest seller of shares will provide the identity of the perpetrator.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/829951-chimera-energy-part-ii-pemex-denies-contract-as-fabrications-and-lies-continue-deceiving-investors 9/16


Doing so is easier said than done as the perpetrators do not disclose their 20,000,000
share position. SEC law requires the disclosure of over 5% of shares in a company. Given
that CHMR has 66,000,000 shares outstanding that would mean that any block of shares
exceeding 3.3 million would have to be disclosed.


The rule actually applies to any beneficial owner but in CHMR's case we have reason to
believe that the perpetrator of the scam owns their 20,000,000 shares in 6 blocks of
3,333,333 each. Each of these blocks would have then been deposited in a brokerage firm
under a different company name and then liquidated onto the public.


But how could we decipher what shares belong to the perpetrator? This would be the $21
million dollar question (since the fraud began it has traded a total of $21 million in value).


Follow the Block Trades


We called several brokerage houses that we saw make a market in the shares of CHMR
and asked them how one would identify a large seller. We pondered what these large
share blocks were we kept seeing put up every day a few minutes after the close of
market. As one broker explained to us -- a market maker that receives a large sell order to
liquidate shares would execute the order throughout the day by short selling the shares
and at the close buy the total amount sold short from the broker that sent them the order.
This buy is the "print" and is the total sale amount at a price, which leaves a little room for
profit (their commission). This "print" is in effect the total amount sold by that account for
the day.


This graphic will help visualize this better:

Total 4,094,876 $ 4,342,684.71


Each and every one of these prints was sold by the perpetrators.These "prints" are the
day's bounty from at least one of the brokerages houses where the perpetrator deposited
their shares. Each of these trades has a unique identifier which is recorded with FINRA.
All the regulators need to do is blue sheet these specific trades and they will have the
identity of the perpetrator. Hopefully they do this soon before the proceeds are wired out to
their Marshall Island accounts but we should remind the brokerage firms and
clearinghouses dealing with these accounts that they have a duty as gatekeepers to
freeze any proceeds if they believe there has been foul play involved which in this
case is seemingly obvious.


Using the OTCBB Monthly Share Volume Tool we are able to uncover even more data
relating to these prints. The OTCBB data is one month old but this is actually a blessing
for the purposes of deciphering where the shares are deposited. CHMR traded a total of
615,813 in July. We know using our block scanner tool that there were three such prints in
July totaling 155,416 shares. This figure is extremely important as it tells us the selling
account had to have traded at least 155,416 shares of CHMR in July.

Using the volume tool we can clearly see that only two brokerage houses traded 155,416
or more of CHMR in July. They are Pennaluna & Company and Vandham Securities. From
this we can deduce that one of these houses maintains the selling account for the
perpetrator. The question is which one?


By employing the logic visualized in our graphic we believe the shares are deposited with
Pennaluna as their reported volume for the month matches perfectly with the amounts
printed. Vandham was most probably used as the executing market maker throughout the
day but is not the brokerage house where the shares are deposited. We could be wrong
about the relationships but are certain that at least one of these houses holds the account
of the perpetrator.


Conclusion


We urge investors to stay away from both CHMR and NVMN. CHMR has no contract with
Pemex and Pemex has had no contact with CHMR. Investors can call Pemex investor
relations themselves to confirm this but can save time by listening to the audio recording
that was uploaded on YouTube. Given how blatant the apparent CHMR fraud is we
believe that shares may be halted by regulators imminently with the best case scenario
being a decline towards an inherent value of zero within several weeks.


Disclosure: I am short OTC:CHMR. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have
no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Rforretired,


You are ridiculous.... Just look at the asks. If I was the SEC I would take a good hard look at you. See what you are
up too.


How can You Deny The Truth.

Pamela Long (Corporation Finance in DC) already sent Mr. Grob a a few e-mails (Nov and Dec) with a long list of
questions. Mr. Loev was also copied.


Not sure why there's not been any follow-up. Nice story. Ditto on part 1. Enjoyed the QWTR coverage as well.


Should anyone have further questions, I suggest they contact Ms. Long at the SEC.

This article is pretty compelling. Although I was hoping that CHMR was legit, all the evidence points to a SCAM. Very
sophisticated. Maybe someone will write a screenplay about this SCAM.

I am an older gentleman who has been trading stocks since 1961. Right now I am sick and tired of weasels hired by
hedge funds who are allowed to print garbage writings on stocks, that could appear to be true, but probably are very
false in most cases when the truth comes out.


Also, if the word Chinese is found anywhere in connection with a stock, the word fraud immediately is used by these
scoundrels and evil minded people.

Rforretired, 
Hmmm, no bio, not following anyone or being followed and only 7 comments, personal attack on author, all
adds up to paid troll.

Well. I did not receive your caution on CHMR until I purchased 2000 shares at $1.25 when I read about the fracing
process. I read your article as the price dropped and I sold at$.39/share...a $1720 loss in a few days. They should be
hung at dawn!

This is sickening I didn't think that you can buy your way into the stock market that easily I thought that all stocks had
to have some sort of an investigation by the SEC as in all IPO's???


But this goes to show all of us that even with all the regulation out there, still scams are being done!!!

One word: 10Q.


The 10Q filed with the SEC states, in part:


"We anticipate that we will require approximately $500,000 to fund our operations and fully execute our business plan.
We continue to rely on loans from third parties to fund operating shortfalls and do not foresee a change in this
situation in the immediate future. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have such funding available. We
will not be able to continue operations without additional financings. These conditions create substantial doubt as to
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern."

A compelling article, but it does nothing for your credibility that you are SHORT the stock you are exposing as a fraud,
and therefore stand to profit from any decline in the stock price. It makes you no more ethical than the stock pump
and dump perpetrators.

robgra, 
To note a stock that is failing and to short it is neither unethical nor illegal. He did give the disclaimer in an
ethical manner and if you look at the charts, they proved the article is not a reverse pump and dump. 
So get off your high horse, or are you another paid instigator?

vulnerable retail investors from this fraud!

It has always been startling to me the way the public looks at shorting. You know I take no side here as I am not a
buyer or seller of this stock because I do not trade penny stocks. But I stumbled upon the article and just wanted to
add a comment which I truly stand for. Going back to my point, it is crazy how when someone analyzes a company
and lists all the true facts about it and proves to the people it is in fact an obvious buy people will praise him and will
never think of him as unethical or unmoral, etc. Yet, when someone does the same thing and instead proves it an
opportunity to short the stock as it is an obvious scam, or overvalued, or toppy certain people bash that person and do
not praise him like they would had he made the good point from a buying standpoint. Well, I would like to explain
something... The market can go two ways up and down!!! That is it, it is ignorant to think that you can only make
money on the way up. Without shorts or sellers you would not have a market. Without shorting you would not have
people challenging anything suspicious as everyone would just want to buy anything that moves and has a positive
news flow. I want to end this by saying nobody and I mean nobody can control a stock in the long run. So when you
see someone writing an article and the stock drops it is not because of the fact that he wrote the article. It is because
there were more sellers than buyers, therefore, generating a move to the downsideeee. This author or the media or
anyone can not control a stock for the long run again if this article did not make sense people would not give 2 cents
about it. Go watch CNBC all you hear all day is oh "a new research report on XYZ today saying it is cheap". It is crazy
most people are just buyers because the media never introduced to them the shorting side of things so they do not
notice how buy biased the media is. I just think it is proper for people to learn that one should be able to make money
in both markets up and down, therefore, stop looking at shorting as unethical or unmoral. If your strategy is to simply
buy stocks that is fine but do not be biased. If your strategy is invest in companies that is fine do not be biased. The
bottom line is bulls make money, bears make money, pigs... they get slaughtered. That is the beauty of the market
there could be two opinions a buyers and a sellers and then those people match their brains against thousands of
others opinions to see who is right. As long as there is supply/demand, then we will have both a buyer and a seller
and we sure need both because without them there would be no market.

so chimera has a chance to go back up? or is it seriously done for? i cant see how a fake/scam/fraud got
public in the first place where people can even see it on google stocks or any kind of stock graph at that as a
legit company. guess i just dont understand

A chimera is an unreal, evil, and mythological creature. (The first tip off) The promoters somehow got their press
releases to appear under other legitimate companies when I was researching.

I am not a paid troll as you suggest. I am an investor who gets sick and tired of reverse scammers putting out
apparently well documented scams to push a stock down.


I takje a big exception to the guy below who suggests these short scammers do not have an effect on stocks. Take
some of the good Chinese stocks who got shot down due to guys like Muddy Waters saying pretty much that all
Chinese stocks are bad or frauds.

CHMR is worthless. The company has no employees and no board of directors.


I have no sympathy for Mr. Grob given the pain he has inflicted on investors.


However, posting pictures, names and contact info of Mr. Grob's family on the internet is wrong and should stop.
Inflicting pain upon innocent folks is terrorism and there is no justification.

ive been in chesapeak for a while and i had 9 grand extra side money and i wanted to play around and have a little
fun with penny stocks. i played the roller coaster game 3 times after the big 2.00 dollar a share drop to about 13 cent
or whatever it was. i bought at 41 cent, it went to 60 cent. i sold. i bought at 50 cent, sold at .74. it went back down to
.42. i again put the 9 grand back in "pocketing the gains from previous plays" it went up to like 56 cent and now its
sitting at .185 AFTER I READ ALL THE SCAM/FRAUD STUFF. sold it at .195 and even after the gains i still lost 5
grand. id like to see this made up CEO in person so i can show him how i feel after letting him hear my thoughts.
