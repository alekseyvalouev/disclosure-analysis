EBIX: If The SEC
Cometh, The SEC
Will Findeth (Or
So We Suspect)
Dec. 5, 2012 11:51 AM ET10 comments | Includes: Ebix Inc…


Today we published a report on Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX). It can be found in its
entirety at:


www.scribd.com/doc/115628889/EBIX-If-the...-suspect


Below is a piece of the report. THE REPORT SHOULD BE READ IN ITS
ENTIRETY AS THE SEGMENT BELOW ONLY CONTAINS HIGHLIGHTS
AND THE APPROPRIATE REFERENCES ARE FOUND IN THE FULL
REPORT:


On March 24th, 2011, we shared our first research report on Ebix in a three
part series that was published on the main page of Seeking Alpha.[1] We
argued among other things that Ebix had: misrepresented organic growth,
been reporting questionable cash flow generated by a potentially illegal tax
scheme, multiple auditor resignations, governance abuses, and a highly
promotional, contentious CEO. We concluded that Ebix was nothing more than
a roll-up with a misrepresented business model. Further, our analysis detailed
a lack of de novo growth, which was supplemented with two tactics: tax
arbitrage and destructive cost cuts (headcount reductions and offshoring). We
questioned the sustainability of this strategy and notified the IRS and SEC of
the material abuses we believed were so pervasive at Ebix. Since our original
report, damaging information has materialized, including accusations from
former employees of Peak that Ebix made "Fraudulent Misrepresentations"
and "acted with utter disregard and recklessness." It is our opinion that
the malfeasance at Ebix is even more egregious than what occurred at OCZ,

which we wrote about last year.[2] Since our report on OCZ, the CEO and CFO
have resigned, the stock has declined by 85%, and the company disclosed an
SEC investigation on November 21, 2012.[3]


Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported that the SEC is currently
conducting an investigation into Ebix in a story titled "Ebix Accounting
Practices Said to Be Probed by SEC."[4] According to Bloomberg, the SEC
investigation has been ongoing for the past year and is "focused on revenue
recognition, internal controls and the accuracy of the company's public
statements to shareholders." The Bloomberg article cited information from four
different sources, including three former Ebix employees who had conducted
interviews with the SEC, as well as naming the specific SEC attorney leading
the investigation. The article implied the investigation also focused on "Ebix's
strategy of booking U.S. revenues to units based in Singapore and India"
which we criticized as the heart of Ebix's potentially illegal tax scheme. Since
our initial report, we believe the ingredients for a full blown SEC investigation
have only grown. In this brief report, we will discuss: 1) The SEC
Correspondence History and a Vociferous Denial. Despite ardently denying any
knowledge of an SEC investigation, Ebix has filed 40 comment and response
exchanges with the SEC. Mysteriously, the public exchanges with the SEC
stopped around the same time Bloomberg reports that an investigation began.
2) The Continued Misrepresentation of Growth and Altered Disclosures. Based
on recent public disclosures, we believe Ebix has continued to misrepresent its
growth, and in fact organic growth was NEGATIVE in Q3'12. Ebix reported
1H'12 pro-forma organic growth in the most recent 10Q that does not
reconcile with the figures provided in the 10Q's from the first and second
quarter. An amended 10Q from the first quarter introduced new disclosures for
pro-forma revenues that were not presented in the original filing. Based on our
analysis, Ebix may have misrepresented its pro-forma revenue growth in the
first and second quarter 10Q's by 30x compared to the 0.2% that was implied
in the third quarter 10Q. Investors that bought Ebix stock in the first two
quarters of 2012 may have done so on the basis of organic growth numbers
that were overstated. 3) The Damning Accusations made in the Peak Lawsuit.
Another acquired company is suing Ebix for failing to make earn-out
payments. The plaintiff's testimony describes countless examples of
dysfunction, misrepresentation, and insufficient internal accounting controls at
Ebix. The lawsuit provides vivid accusations of behavior that ranges from
unscrupulous to incompetent, including an example where "Ebix's own CFO

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1341841-ebix-if-the-sec-cometh-the-sec-will-findeth-or-so-we-suspect 3/10


and Controller [were] unable to agree on Peak's revenue….and in fact
disagree[d] by more than $800,000 over a one year period." Despite the
severity of the accusations, we have been unable to find disclosures of the
Peak lawsuit in Ebix's most recent SEC quarterly filings. Should the allegations
levied against Ebix be true (failure to manage billing, collection, sales, taxes,
regulatory payments, and accounting for Peak), then it would seem probable
that those same failures would be found by the SEC at the corporate level. 4)
Additional Lawsuits and Contingent Payments. Ebix is facing at least two class
action lawsuits that appear headed to trial. One class action complaint includes
testimony from a former senior Ebix employee who corroborates the
dysfunction and weak internal controls alleged in the Peak lawsuit. This
incriminating evidence may be integral to any investigation the SEC has
launched. Further, Ebix also faces at least two lawsuits accusing them of failing
to pay earn-outs. With $30 million of balance sheet earn-out liabilities,
investors may begin to view this line as a debt-equivalent, and question "one-
time" P&L benefits from reversing the earn-outs. 5) Our Original $9.00 Target
Did Not Consider SEC or IRS Action. For a roll-up business with negative
organic growth, overstated margins given limited investment in the business,
quality of earnings issues, the potential for a massive overhang from
regulatory investigations, lawsuits, and the possibility of significant liability or
fines relating to the questionable tax strategy, we now believe that a more
appropriate multiple should be 4x to 5x LTM EBITDA. This would be
approximately $5.50 to $7.70 per share, or downside risk of 55% to 68%.

What BS. An ongoing one year plus SEC
investigation of revenue recognition? How?
By a SEC petition and testimony from
shorts or "witnesses" from that bogus
shareholder lawsuit? The SEC has no valid
information if it doesn't contact EBIX and
subpoena financial records like it did in
year 2000 which included all .com
companies. But the SEC will not comment
on anything; it's against their written
policy. They did not even publicly close the
2000 probe because there was no actions
against Ebix. However, Ebix made
reference to that probe until at least 2005
in their quarterly reports. As for the
deferred tax liability, all international
companies do it. Most of international
company's cash is in foreign countries

even if most of their sales are in the USA.
The SEC is looking at this and encouraging
companies to report it to shareholders
(most have complied) and the SEC is not
investigating its legality as far as anyone
knows, because it is legal. Ebix reports
their cash in each country that they have
operations. Ebix reported their deferred
tax liability if they repatriated ALL their
earnings at $51.4M as of Dec 31, 2011.
Ebix has tax loss carryovers to offset IRS
taxes. Ebix like all other international
companies do not intend to repatriate all
their earnings, but they all pay foreign
taxes on earnings. Some pay more foreign
taxes than others. Until laws change
(including tax holidays in the foreign
countries like India and Singapore), this is
and will continue to be legal. The tax rate
in all foreign countries is different and Ebix
lists them in their financial reports.


Can't you find something else to short,
Jon? And Greg Farrell seems to be overly
concerned about this small cap company
when he has bigger fish to fry.

Your hyperbole knows no limits,
desperately trying to stampede the longs
into selling, so you can make profits at
their expense 
You carry on and on about the "damning"
Peak lawsuit, but you fail to mention that
they are suing over $1.5 million. 
Immaterial. 
That is a clear intent to mislead and
deceive on your part. 
You should be working for the National
Enquirer.

Ebix's CEO: 
" The agreement with Peak shareholders
mandates audited GAAP numbers to be
used for the earn-out calculation. The
audited numbers were a lot lower than
$6.5 million.


If they had a dispute with that number,
then the contract mandates that they need
to give Ebix a 30-day notice, then submit
reasons for dispute on revenue. After all
this, it could lead to arbitration, failing
which, it would go to a court. The funny
fact is that they have not done any of that,
including giving us a 30-day notice or
taking it to arbitration. One wonders why
they were in a hurry to file a suit and
report it to the public, when the contract
does not even allow them to do that. So,
let us hold our thoughts for now and not
pass any judgment on Ebix practices or
management, based on this suit that
alleges a few hundred thousand in
understatement.

Raina: 
To put things in perspective, BDO Tax
Partners in 2005-2006 put Ebix's tax
structure in place. Subsequent to that, it
has been reviewed and enhanced by Ernst
&Young, with help from other firms like
BKD, Frazier Deeter, etc., besides multiple
offices of E&Y across the world. Ebix's
infrastructure setup of putting
development and IP in Singapore & India
was put in place much before any tax
planning was contemplated. Also, Ebix's
inheriting of NOLs in the United States was
something that was not planned, but

happened since Ebix had lots of losses in
the pre-2000 era. Our tax structure
worldwide was thus driven by our
infrastructure and efficiency needs of
putting development & IP in a place, which
could give us global economies of scale at
the highest levels of efficiency.


Ebix took care not to transfer any IP out of
the U.S. and thus does not expect any
issues on that account. All our IP
centralized in Singapore was either built
and funded by Singapore, or directly
acquired by Singapore through an
acquisition.


Our transfer pricing is not done by CB&H.
The transfer pricing, updates and reviews
are done by E&Y with help from their
various offices, and BKD. That is a
continuous exercise and not just a onetime
exercise. Every position of the company
has a strong documented basis, written by
these top quality firms who are rated one
of the best in this work worldwide. CB&H is
our U.S. auditor who checks all this from
an auditor perspective and they have an
international tax practice that specializes
in this field.


Besides following the advice of the best in
the business, the company always has
taken conservative positions and built
large FIN 48 reserves to offset any adverse
transfer pricing rulings. Also our US NOLs
in all those periods serve to largely offset
the cash impact of any adverse ruling."


This is from July 2011, and you are still
sensationalizing the same issues.


Have any current Ebix customers or
potential customers mentioned Barron's or
any of the short-seller articles as a point of
concern?

Raina: 
The short answer is no. My guess is that
our customers know a lot more about us
than any media article can tell them about
Ebix.

I want to thank Copperfield for the
excellent service. EBIX had been going up
a lot and this gave me a great opportunity
to add. The company is also buying back
shares at low prices which helps long term
buy and hold investors.


Keep them coming copper. I give you the
title Goldnugget research

That's the only redeeming quality of a
short, cheap stock. It's the only one
that Warren Buffett could even come up
with too. But fraud should never be
applauded; it should be condemned
instead. Copperfield is part of the
financial mafia profiting from investors.
Yes, Copperfield is a suitable name
since he uses smoke and mirrors. He's
even elated with the fact that he caused
the founder and CEO of OCZ to resign
over a misdemeanors conviction with
marijuana.

"EBIX: If The SEC Cometh, The SEC Will

could easily be true for every company. No
point wasting time reading your blog and it
is getting stale. Please come up with some
new dirt. We will get an opportunity to buy

Betty Smith
From: Ebix Q3 2012 Earnings Call
Transcript


"[Operator Instructions] Okay, and we'll
take our next question from Josh Smith
[ph] from Epcot.[ph]"


Unknown Analyst


"I was wondering, how much of your
revenue growth for the last 3 months and
9 months were due to organic growth and
how much was due to acquisitions?"


Robin Raina - Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and President


"Well, I think we've answered that in the
past that the way we run our business,
and it's very different -- difficult for us to
differentiate between what we get out of
acquisition and what we get out internally.
Part of it, we integrate these products very
tightly, there is no -- Ebix, as I was just
talking through the STP region, I actually
talked about one product. What is going to
happen if Ebix will become one product
company. So every day, that's what we are
doing. So we don't really -- everything
that's so entangled in each other, that's so
difficult for us to read. Our operations are
integrated and that's -- our selling process
is integrated, our products are integrated.
It's very difficult for us to disintegrate and
start breaking up that kind of revenue in
that sum. So it's almost impractical for us
to do it. And one of the reasons for Ebix's
success is precisely this. This is one of the
reasons why we produce better efficiency
and better margins than anybody else
because we integrate extremely tightly, we
sell in a very tight manner and so on."

----------------------...


As in the recent Autonomy/HP scandal,
companies who cannot differentiate
organic growth vs. how much was due to
acquisitions is one of the biggest signs of
accounting fraud.


06 Dec 2012, 03:20 PM


srmedava
Danaher, another acquisitive company
has similar ratio of goodwill/total
assets. Is Danaher a fraud too? I know
you are attacking the company for not
showing the organic/inorganic growth
ratio. Is that the only beef that people
have with this company? How are they
able to purchase all these shares and
pay dividends too? Goodwill might be
high and there might be an impairment
if these units don't perform as expected
but that is the risk investors are taking
and assigning a low multiple. Calling it a
fraud is taking to the extreme and the
intention of shorts is very clear.
