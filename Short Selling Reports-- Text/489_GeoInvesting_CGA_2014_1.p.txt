China Green Agriculture's Imaginary Fertilizer Production And
Vanishing Cash
Oct. 1, 2014 10:32 AM ET123 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


344 days of time-lapse surveillance of CGA's high-margin Jinong fertilizer factory,
contributing 75% of CGA's gross profit, shows it only shipped around 10% of the
volume CGA reports it sold.


51 days of time-lapse surveillance of CGA's low-margin Gufeng factory found 24% to
34% less volume shipped compared to volume sold disclosed in SEC filings.


We interviewed current and former CGA employees, one of whom told us that CGA's
Jinong factory exaggerated its production specifically for its stock listing in the U.S.


CGA's auditor, Kabani, signed off on $113 million of outrageous PP&E
reclassifications and deferred marketing assets wiping out CGA's cash. Kabani was
also auditor of the L&L Energy fraud.


In addition to potentially falsified sales volumes, CGA's PP&E reclassifications could
constitute capex fraud that in and of itself could be enough to have the company
halted and delisted.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Special Note:


Today, aware of the rising short interest in its stock and less than a day after our final
attempt to confront management, CGA announced a one-time dividend of 10c per share
($3.3 million in aggregate), payable four months from now. We doubt that CGA has the
capability or desire to actually pay this dividend. CGA's dividend announcement reminds
us of China Media Express (OTCPK:CCME), which announced a dividend policy following
a short seller's report calling the company a fraud. CCME never paid.

China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA) was taken public in December of 2007 via a
reverse merger with a U.S. shell company supplied by Belmont Partners, touted as the
"CarMax of shell corporations" by its CEO Joseph Meuse. Belmont and Meuse later
settled SEC fraud charges, and Meuse was barred from the penny stock business.


In July 2010, "Alfred Little" published excerpts from a detailed due diligence report on
China Green Agriculture that found CGA had exaggerated the sales of its key Jinong
fertilizer factory, paid only a fraction of the Chinese taxes it claimed, overstated the
purchase price of land-use rights by 4x, reported earnings of 5x to 6x what it disclosed in
Chinese SAIC filings, and used a tiny auditor, Kabani & Co., whose only other substantial
Chinese client at the time was L&L Energy (NASDAQ:LLEN).


In January 2011, J Capital Research published the results of their own very thorough
investigation that likewise concluded that CGA vastly inflated its fiscal 2010 sales by a
factor of at least four times. J Capital believed that its findings were:


"... very serious and merit delisting [of CGA] from the NYSE. In fact, it should be
embarrassing to such a prestigious exchange as the NYSE to host such an irregular
company. We wonder whether an excess of entrepreneurial spirit could have
affected NYSE, which has been actively seeking Chinese IPOs and seeking its own
listing in Shanghai."


Following the J Capital Report, analyst Ingrid Yin of Brean Murray downgraded CGA to a
"sell", citing CGA's failure to provide evidence refuting the short sellers' reports, perhaps
the first time a sell-side analyst covering Chinese companies sided with short sellers.


On January 7, 2011, without informing shareholders, CGA Chairman Li Tao told the
Chinese 21st Century Business Herald that the SEC had begun an informal inquiry into
the company, following the Alfred Little publication.


On September 5, 2012, the SEC informed CGA that it had concluded its investigation
without recommending any enforcement action against the company, according to CGA's
fiscal 2012 10-K.


For the next two years, CGA survived as a public company, but was awarded a miserably
low valuation by investors who discounted its questionable financials.


Now, over four years after the first allegations against CGA, GeoInvesting intends to put
an end to the debate. We believe CGA should be halted, investigated, and delisted from
the exchange, much the same as many others before it.

One Year of Time-Lapse Surveillance and Over 2 Million Images Shows Little
Production at CGA's Key Jinong Fertilizer Factory


In August 2013, investigators set up a time-lapse surveillance camera in an apartment
overlooking the only entrance to CGA's Jinong fertilizer factory, which, according to CGA's
SEC filings, produces CGA's highest-margin premium liquid organic fertilizers and
concentrated powder fertilizers. According to CGA, its Jinong division generated
$117,706,033 in fiscal 2014 fertilizer sales and $69,076,938 in gross profit, equal to 50.4%
and 75.7% of CGA's total sales and gross profit for the year.


The following satellite image taken August 13, 2014 is marked up showing the Jinong
factory and the location of the factory entrance and camera across the street:

The following sample image taken by the camera on October 13, 2013 shows an
unobstructed view of boxes of liquid fertilizer bottles being loaded onto a small truck inside
the Jinong facility:


From August 17, 2013 until August 24, 2014, our camera took pictures of the entrance
and staging area of Jinong factory every 10-15 seconds, 24 hours a day, interrupted only
by holidays, brief battery changes, and occasional camera/operator failures. This
amounts to a total of 344 days of time-lapse surveillance footage - all of which
indicates to us that CGA has inflated its Jinong fertilizer sales by around 10x.


The following table shows CGA's reported fertilizer sales (in metric tons) by its Jinong
division for the fiscal 2014 period July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014:


Quarter Ending Tons Sold


June 30, 2014 12,528

December 31, 2013 15,510


September 30, 2013 17,872


Fiscal Year Total 60,629


Source: CGA 10-Q and 10-K filings


As you can see from the table, Jinong sold 60,629 tons of fertilizer during the twelve
months ended June 30, 2014. On average, Jinong was thus purportedly selling an
average of 166 tons of fertilizer per day (60,629 tons divided by 365 days) during fiscal
2014. The Jinong factory primarily ships its fertilizer in the small truck shown in the sample
photo above, which, based on our observation, is usually only partially loaded with around
5 tons of fertilizer. Larger trucks are occasionally used, and we would expect to see an
average of around 10-15 trucks per day delivering fertilizer from the Jinong factory.


However, during the 344 days we filmed the Jinong factory, we observed an average
of only one to two trucks per day, shipping 13 (low estimate) to 20 (high estimate)
tons of fertilizer from the factory, or only 4,800 to 7,100 tons for the entire year,
compared to the 60,629 tons CGA reported Jinong sold in fiscal 2014.


In our opinion, CGA's Jinong factory is simply not producing anywhere near the
level of fertilizer sales that CGA reports in its public filings. Jinong's fertilizer sales,
accounting for over half of CGA's reported total sales and 75% of CGA's gross
profits, simply cannot be true, given the video evidence we have seen. With such a
small level of production, it is doubtful that CGA's Jinong factory can earn a profit at all,
after accounting for its overhead and high selling expenses.


To show just how "dead" the Jinong factory is, we compiled 24 sample time-lapse videos
spanning the year during which we filmed the factory. In each video, we note the daily
count of trucks exiting the factory (whether full of fertilizer or not). The 24 sample time-
lapse videos can be viewed by clicking the thumbnails below:

Jinong Employees Readily Admit to Low Volumes and Book Cooking for U.S.
Listing


After 9 months of filming the Jinong factory, we decided to further our investigation by
questioning the gate guards regarding the level of activity at the factory. On May 22, 2014,
our investigators interviewed one of the Jinong factory's guards inside the guardhouse
adjacent to the entrance to the facility. The following time-lapse image shows the
investigators approaching the guardhouse:

The key findings of the interview of the gate guard were:


1. The Jinong factory has 40 regular employees and 70-80 people in total.

2. Jinong has one cargo delivery truck and two drivers (supplemented by trucks the
company rents).


3. There is only one entrance to the factory.
4. The factory makes deliveries approximately once per week, even in the busy


season.


The recorded interview of the gate guard can be viewed here. A transcript of the interview
can be found here.


Former Warehouse Director Admits Jinong Production was Exaggerated for U.S.
Listing


On April 25, 2014, an investigator interviewed Chen Lianpeng, the former warehouse
director of the Jinong fertilizer factory, who we discovered after finding the resume he had
posted to a Chinese jobs website. The key findings of the interview with Mr. Chen were:


1. He had worked for CGA for about 5 years, resigning in March 2012.
2. Jinong's fertilizer production was falsely reported outside "for the listing" (referring to


the U.S. public listing) as 20,000 tons in 2011.
3. 20,000 tons of production is not possible unless the factory ran continuously for nine


months of the year, which was never the case.
4. He emphatically claimed that the total actual production of all types of fertilizers was


less than 8,000 tons in 2011, and roughly stable at only 8,000 tons per year.
5. There was no fertilizer production from January to March 2012.


Mr. Chen's comment that CGA's Jinong factory production was stable at only 8,000 tons
per year is completely at odds with Jinong's quarterly reported sales volume in calendar
2011 (the last full year Mr. Chen worked for Jinong) of 57,447 tons:


Quarter Ending Tons Sold


December 31, 2011 14,798

Calendar Year Total 57,447


Source: CGA 10-Q and 10-K filings


Mr. Chen's comments yield a capacity utilization rate of just 14.5% (8,000 tons divided by
Jinong's 55,000 ton capacity), far below the 87% capacity utilization rate disclosed on
page 10 of the CGA's fiscal 2011 10-K ended June 30. (In its 2011 10-K, CGA calculated
Jinong's capacity utilization rate by dividing Jinong's 48,038 tons sold in fiscal 2011 by its
stated annual production capacity of 55,000 tons).


Mr. Chen recalled that Jinong produced no fertilizer from January to March 2012,
contradicting the 14,925 tons CGA reported were sold by Jinong in the March 2012
quarter. Thus, the Jinong factory's production seemed to be declining at the time Mr. Chen
quit working. Our time-lapse surveillance showed the production had fallen to under 8,000
tons (annualized).


The recorded phone interview of Mr. Chen can be accessed here. A transcript of the
interview can be found here.


Gufeng Factory Fertilizer Shipments Also Appear to be Lower Than Volume Sold


CGA acquired the low-margin, high-volume Gufeng fertilizer factory in July 2010. Gufeng
produces various granular fertilizers that have much lower selling prices and gross
margins than Jinong's liquid and concentrated powder fertilizers. Gufeng's fiscal 2014
gross profit accounted for 23% of CGA's total gross profit, as Gufeng's gross profit margin
was only 19%, versus 59% for Jinong (calculated from the 2014 10-K). Both J Capital and
Alfred Little alleged that CGA overpaid for Gufeng's low-margin business, which CGA
claimed it turned around, increasing Gufeng's average selling prices from $288 per ton in
the quarter following the acquisition to over $400 per ton each of the last few years.


The following satellite image taken November 13, 2013 is marked up showing the Gufeng
factory and the location of the factory entrances and cameras we deployed along the main
access road to the Gufeng factory. Our effort to film the Gufeng factory was hindered by a
security guard Gufeng had stationed at the intersection of the factory access road and the
main highway, which repeatedly prevented us from approaching the factory:

heading southwest from "Entrance 2" appears to only be used by locals, including a
neighboring greenhouse complex (which may possibly be a small customer).

During the 51 days we filmed, based on CGA's quarterly SEC filings, we estimated
that Gufeng should have sold around 760 tons of fertilizer per day, on average.
However, our surveillance footage only recorded shipments of 500 (low estimate) to
580 (high estimate) tons per day, a 24% to 34% shortfall.


We compiled one week of sample time-lapse videos spanning April 1 to April 7, 2013 that
can be viewed by clicking the thumbnails below:

CGA Refuses to Respond to Inquiries Regarding its Fertilizer Production


One of our investigators first reached out on September 12, 2014 to try to arrange a call
with CGA's CFO, Ken Ren, to discuss these issues. The investigator called Ken's U.S.
phone number disclosed in CGA's SEC filings.


Mr. Ren answered his phone, but refused to even acknowledge that he was Ken Ren,
CGA's CFO. Mr. Ren hung up on the investigator. On a second call, Mr. Ren again would
not confirm his identity, but referred the investigator to contact the person shown on CGA's
most recent press releases, Mr. Fang Wang.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2533965-china-green-agricultures-imaginary-fertilizer-production-and-vanishing-cash 15/54


One of our investigators then emailed Mr. Wang, but never received a reply.


On September 30th, Dan David, Principal in GeoInvesting, called Mr. Ren and emailed
both Mr. Ren and Mr. Wang one last time to confront them, receiving no answer to either
his call or email.


After receiving no reply from management, Dan spoke to a long-time investor in CGA who
was able to reach Ken Ren. This long-time investor called Dan late on September 30,
2014 to inform Dan that Ken Ren could not reach Li Tao, but Ken would email or call Dan
to set up a conference call immediately. This call never came. Rather, today, CGA issued
a press release announcing a "first-ever dividend".


Today, aware of the rising short interest in its stock and less than a day after our final
attempt to confront management, CGA announced a one-time dividend of 10c per share
($3.3 million in aggregate), payable four months from now. We doubt that CGA has the
capability or desire to actually pay this dividend. CGA's dividend announcement reminds
us of China Media Express, which announced a dividend policy following a short seller's
report calling the company a fraud. CCME never paid.


Our Findings Cannot be Reconciled with CGA's Public Filings


We thought about some potential reasons for the nearly 10x shortfall of production activity
at the Jinong factory. One such reason we thought could be that the missing Jinong
"sales" are actually just wholesale trades in fertilizer products, or outsourced production,
rather than sales of fertilizer manufactured by Jinong. But we easily concluded that such a
claim would be preposterous and clearly contradicted by CGA's historical SEC filings,
including the 2014 10-K, which discloses on page 12 that CGA both "produced and sold"
its entire 316,450 metric tons of fertilizer sold in fiscal 2014 (according to the table at the
top of page 50). Hence, we believe that no material amount of production was outsourced
to 3rd-parties.


The following Q&A exchange from the Q3 2014 earnings conference call transcript further
ruled out an "outsourcing" explanation:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2533965-china-green-agricultures-imaginary-fertilizer-production-and-vanishing-cash 16/54


"Bill Whitfield: Thank you. Now do you produce 100% of the fertilizers you sale or
do you outsource or subcontract any of your production?


Li Tao: Except the number of fertilizer products, we almost surely produce our
fertilizer products ourselves. Roughly 1%.


…


Bill Whitfield: So, roughly 1% okay. And so what percent of your sales are your own
products that you can produce and if you tell that number?


Li Tao: Most of the products which is produced by ourselves.


Bill Whitfield: Okay. Is there anyway to get a percentage on that to quantify that?


Li Tao: Like we said approximately 1% as I say from the outsourcing parties and the
rest will be produced by companies owned."


Then, we considered whether the missing 90% of Jinong's fertilizer sales could actually be
giant intercompany cross-sales of fertilizer manufactured at CGA's Gufeng facility. This
reasoning would mean that CGA is asking us and investors to believe that its fully
automated Jinong liquid organic factory, built in part with funds raised directly from U.S.
investors, has hardly produced any fertilizer at all in the last year.


We discard this possibility for the following reasons:


1. The Jinong factory is CGA's only factory capable of producing CGA's premium liquid
organic fertilizers that are CGA's highest-margin product, with average selling prices of
well over $2,000 per ton ($2 to $3 per liter retail price for the basic liquid fertilizer
shown on Alibaba.com).


2. According to the 10-K, Jinong sold 60,629 metric tons of fertilizer for an average of
$1,941 per ton, over 4x the average selling price of fertilizer sold by Gufeng. To
achieve such a high average selling price, much of the fertilizer Jinong sold must be
expensive liquid organic fertilizer that can only be manufactured at Jinong's factory.


3. Our time-lapse data showed that the Gufeng factory shipped out less fertilizer than the
sales volumes reported in CGA's SEC filings. If Gufeng was producing large volumes
of fertilizer for Jinong, our cameras filming Gufeng should have recorded higher, rather
than lower volumes.


4. CGA's audited financials do not disclose any material intercompany sales, which

5. Historically (through fiscal 2011), CGA reported each Jinong's capacity utilization as
"tons sold" divided by Jinong's annual production capacity of 55,000 tons. Thus, at
least through 2011, when CGA reported "tons sold", the amount was the same as
"tons produced" for Jinong.


CGA's Vanishing Cash and PP&E Reclassification Justifies a Delisting on its Own


CGA has conducted a series of highly questionable, if not outright fraudulent, transactions
that diverted nearly all of the company's cash to questionable marketing ventures. In all of
our years of experience in the market, we're hard-pressed to come up with a situation as
absurd and alarming as this one.


As shown in the following table, in 2012 and 2013, CGA reported it invested $44,333,172
in Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):


2012 2013 Total


Originally Reported Investment in PP&E ($11,883,947) ($32,449,225) ($44,333,172)


Revised Investment in PP&E ($2,532,385) ($529,505) ($3,061,890)


Investment in PP&E Reclassified to Marketing


Related Deferred Assets


($9,351,562) ($31,919,720) ($41,271,282)


Source: 2013 and 2014 10-K


Note: $67,357 invested in construction in progress in 2013 is included in PP&E Investment
in our table above.


However, as shown in the table above, in its 2014 10-K CGA reclassified $41,271,282 of
its PP&E investments to "deferred assets" that the company vaguely describes as
"marketing-related assets" to be rapidly amortized and expensed over the next three
years:
5/23/2018 China Green Agriculture's Imaginary Fertilizer Production And Vanishing Cash - China Green Agriculture, Inc. (NYSE:CGA) | Seeking Alp…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2533965-china-green-agricultures-imaginary-fertilizer-production-and-vanishing-cash 18/54


"The primary amounts reclassified were certain marketing related assets that were
previously included in property, plant and equipment at June 30, 2013 that were
reclassified to deferred assets." (Page F-11 of 2014 10-K)


...


"Deferred assets represent amounts that the distributors owed to the Company in
their marketing efforts and developing standard stores to expand the Company's
products' competitiveness and market shares. The amount owed to the Company to
assist its distributors will be expensed over three years which is the term as stated in
the cooperation agreement, as long as the distributors are actively selling the
Company's products." (Page F-8 of 2014 10-K)


Thus, $41.3 million of the cash that CGA previously reported as invested in PP&E
two years ago is now quickly going to be expensed as marketing-related. This begs
the question of whether this amount should have been classified as marketing-related
when first incurred and expensed much sooner, negating and calling into question much of
CGA's reported operating cash flow of $38,491,225 in fiscal 2012 and 2013.


Even more mind-boggling is the fact that in the last 12 months, CGA invested an
additional $72,061,705 of its cash in marketing-related deferred assets, bringing the total
"investment" in marketing to over $113 million in the last 3 years!


What has this outrageous three-year "investment" in marketing accomplished? Almost
nothing, as far as sales growth shows:


2014 2013 2012


Net Sales $233,402,088 $216,897,956 $217,524,205


From 2012 to 2014, sales grew about $16 million, or only 7%! CGA's sales growth
guidance for 2015 is 9% to 15%. Thus, CGA's top line sales growth is failing miserably to
recoup its investments in marketing-related assets. CGA's marketing investments are
simply wiping out cash and greatly reducing reported earnings.


The hit to earnings will get worse. For fiscal 2014, CGA amortized and expensed
$27,390,957 of the marketing-related deferred assets. For fiscal 2015, CGA estimates
another $41,807,390 amortization expense of the deferred assets, far more than
management's sales growth forecast, resulting in a huge negative impact to earnings.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2533965-china-green-agricultures-imaginary-fertilizer-production-and-vanishing-cash 19/54


The huge cash outflow to marketing-related deferred assets has virtually wiped out CGA's
reported cash position from $75,031,489 at June 30, 2013 to $26,890,321 at June 30,
2014. Subtracting $25,700,586 of customer deposits leaves CGA with only $1,189,735.


We conclude that CGA's reclassification of PP&E and purported investment of over $113
million in marketing-related assets makes no sense, given that such an enormous amount
seems unlikely to ever be recouped from CGA's limited growth in sales. We question
whether any of this investment was real, or was it merely a way to move cash off of CGA's
balance sheet? Did this cash even exist in the first place?


Now Let Us Tell You What You Already Know


The irony behind GeoInvesting publishing this piece on what we believe to be another
brazen China hustle is the fact that we were such bulls on China in 2009. If you go back to
our articles throughout 2009, you can see that we were once bullish on names like CGA
and LLEN. We were bullish on China's economic stimulus in general.


U.S.-listed Chinese companies are intricate cases, cloaked by a significant language
barrier, murky disclosures, and inaccessibility due to geography. It is much more difficult
for U.S.-based investors to perform due diligence in China than it is for them to do so
domestically, a fact that Chinese companies understand.


Once we established our own on-the-ground due diligence team in China, our assessment
of U.S.-listed Chinese companies was diametrically opposed to our previous sentiments.
Our intentions from the beginning have always been solely driven by our desire to learn
the truth, good or bad, and we've found indisputable overwhelming evidence of fraud in
China-based companies since we've begun doing our on-the-ground research there (see
names like Longwei Petroleum (OTC:LPIH), Sino Clean Energy (OTC:SCEI), Yuhe Int'l
(OTCPK:YUII), Puda Coal (OTC:PUDA), and more recently, L&L Energy Common and
FAB Universal (OTC:FABU). PUDA, YUII, and FABU eventually admitted to their deceit.
Further, the Chinese press validated our findings pertaining to SCEI, LLEN, LPIH, and
FABU.


We've come to expect some initial skepticism and pushback to our reports. We
understand the reasons why investors do this, and we welcome it, as we know our reports
are backed by primary-source on-the-ground evidence. In the case of CGA, we offer
indisputable time-lapse video surveillance of the Jinong factory, conducted over a period
of one year, that simply speaks for itself. Once again, we hope our readers can use the
evidence to make better investment decisions in the future.

Comments (123)


As usual, we are submitting all of our evidence to the NYSE and SEC. Based on our
investigation, we see no way that CGA can survive as a listed company.


We'll also offer to present our evidence to CGA's auditor, Kabani & Company. However,
Kabani showed no interest in reviewing our evidence on L&L Energy , the last Kabani
audited fraud we exposed. In fact, Kabani only stopped providing positive audit opinions
for LLEN after LLEN stopped paying them and after LLEN's CEO, Dickson Lee was
arrested and charged with fraud (Lee recently pled guilty to two counts of fraud).


In his 1990 Letter to Shareholders, Warren Buffett warned:


" The term "earnings" has a precise ring to it. And when an earnings figure is
accompanied by an unqualified auditor's certificate, a naive reader might think it
comparable in certitude to pi, calculated to dozens of decimal places.


In reality, however, earnings can be as pliable as putty when a charlatan heads the
company reporting them."

Interesting article except in the 20 years I've been trading I've never seen a company with such inflated figures as you
claim issue a dividend, that on a yearly basis equals a 20% yield before. If even a tiny portion of your allegations are
correct they'd never be able to declare and pay such a dividend in the first place.

What I am trying to say is that management of CAGC will do everything what is in their power to convince
investors that it is doing the right job and trying to show investors that it is legitimate. That's why they initiated
a dividend. Possibly a little too late, in a show of desperation.


Geo did an outstanding job! So if management of CAGC thinks there company is legitimate and they are
honest business people, just let them explain everything.

annualized basis.

good piece. i ditched my remaining shares this morning.


It also seems weird that they issue a dividend to be paid in 4 months time. AND that comes right after the "so called"
telephone conversations you tried to have with them. i believe that this happened, although id like to try believe that
its made up (actual phone conversations and dialogue) lol.


also this was issued by the company an hour ago, comes way out of left field IMO

i have followed your work and dont dare try to bet against your calls and research. I cant get shares to borrow short
through my tdwaterhouse account here in canada, so i will watch from sidelines. i expect management to rebut and

look at past charts for all of the frauds uncovered by geoteam. they dont drop instantly as there is huge
buying support from shorts buying back shares to cover. 
i just feel that its now a gamble and its best to look elsewhere. 
increased volatility in the share price will exist so i definitely could have picked a better time to get out 8cents
higher..lol, but im not too worried.

Todays press release, show us that in a few weeks the online system is ready. Distributor can setup their

Yes, that is the reason why they have invested in their franchise System. 26.000 new franchise are developed during
Q4, this will add sales power to CGA. But the market is changing. CGA will sell more and more fertilizer to larger
companies directly without distributors. CGA is leading the change to Internet Sales.


If they were fraudelent, why did they have failed to reach the guided earnings for Q4.

LAST YEAR. NEW INFO PLEASE!


01 Oct 2014, 03:42 PM

Thanks for the insightful analysis of CGA. It opened my eyes: 
- First, Geoinvesting seems somewhat credible in its recommendations and past performances on Seeking Alpha 
- Second, the fact that CGA sort of unexpectedly "replied" not to the attacks, but through a dividend is deeply
troubling. It is like its mesmerizing P/E of 2+, management seems to reply to factual critics by calling to greed.  
- Finally, the latest attempts of management suggested by Renmycat: http://bit.ly/1qVs2q6 are also deeply troubling.
Basically, the company will resort to barter, getting "agricultural products" in exchange for its fertilizers. Not only does
that sound more like prehistory than "modern agriculture", but it will possibly create extra artificial income by inflating
liabilities in rice, soy or whatever monkey money they pretend to be paid with, and which they would sell in retail to
urban consumers. All this clouded under a ridiculous neologism of "online-to-offline" retail channels. CGA is the new
Alibaba. Give me a break.


In other words, this company does not seem to be investment grade anymore. It completely changed my outlook on
the company. I had reinforced my position on CGA not long ago (following YONG going private), as I thought it was
likewise an undervalued Chinese agricultural small cap. But I completely dumped it today. Future will tell whether
CGA is a complete scam or a decent company inflated by a dubious management.

Without any reply by the company it is impossible to conclude on these allegations.  
There are some open questions in this study such as:


Is this really the main factory or do they have other factory buildings?  
The Jinong factory has only one entrance, which is quite unusual for a factory of such a size.


I see many different trucks on the picture. In the study they say that the company has only one cargo delivery truck?


When they produce about 8000 tons, for what do they need 40 regular employees?


The trees on the photos have leaves during the entire year; are there no seasons in China?

According to a company presentation CGA has TWO production facilities in Jinong. One with 6495 square meter and
another one with 13803 square meter. The total output of BOTH facilities is 55k metric tons. I assume that they only
included the smaller facility in their study.


If this is the case, the study is complete rubbish.

Let me share a brief story with anyone who questions the Geoteams effort on CGA. This company was a massive
short play 4 years ago and has had an 80% drop to get here. I sent a note to Dan David w/ Geo and pointed out that
the massive effort expended to produce this report seemed like beating a dead horse. Anyone who trades
understands how difficult it is to make money on $2.00 shorts with a tight borrow and skyrocket high borrow costs.
The company will predictably support the scam with a proven disregard for the truth.


Dan answered my jibe by agreeing that the profit motive was questionable but " I need to keep new investors from
falling into this." Dan's attitude is not unique in the short seller community. The first rule is to make a profit but the lone
ranger aspect is also there. It is very satisfying to realize that investors around the world might have been protected
from stock criminals and fraud because of your work. I haven't looked lately but I would guess that over 200 Chinese
companies that were targets of aggressive short campaigns have subsequently gone broke, been delisted, and
provided a 100% loss to the unfortunate share holders. We are talking about many Billions of losses to the ill informed
investors who bought into the lies. Geo has spent many years shedding light on the shadiest of these mangy critters
and the investment community has a long list of point on warnings from Geo to thank and applaud..


I suggest that shareholders not react like insulted ostriches. Pull your head out and consider the possibility that Geo is
right. Get out of the way, find an equally attractive name and come back to CGA in a year if it is still worthy of your
money. On the bigger stage though remember that the China space is still populated with numerous outright frauds.
The fact they are still scamming US investors is a tribute to the skills of the crooks and the ineptness of the regulators.

I agree wholeheartedly. I was one of those investors who was in CAGC. I refused to listen to Muddy Waters
reports that it was a sham and a fraud. Eventually I did get out with only a small loss, thanks to other deluded
investors who also did not believe him and kept the price up. CAGC is of course now exposed as a sham,
dead, and buried. I second your suggestion that investors swallow their pride and get out safely while they
can.

John, I understand your comments. However, CGA claims that they have TWO facilities in Jinong. If Geo considers
only one factory instead of two, they did the most basic thing wrong in their report. I have contacted Geo to clear this
issue.

According to a company massage of today, the CEO and Chairman of the CGA invests another USD 1.1 Mio. in the
company (496,445 new shares for 2.25 USD each). If this is a fraud, such a transaction does not make any sense.

MBoller99 -


Not to suggest you are Pollyana let me ask you a simple question. Do you actually believe that the Chairman
went to the local brokerage house and bought those shares in the open market? Many example of the same
press releases and zero actual money out of CEO pocket.


CGA claims they have many things. I would suspect that the second plant is non existent. Geo isn't going to
miss something that obvious. And even presuming there is a second plant, how can you trust anything these
guys tell you when it has been proven they are lying to you. If you tolerate any deception in your holdings you
are doomed to lose the money.

Good point Waldo - the 8-K shows the Chairman signed an SPA that sets an unspecified future closing date
to be determined by both parties. Until a form 4 is filed, assume the Chairman hasn't paid. Even if a form 4 is
filed, who knows if he really paid.


02 Oct 2014, 01:24 PM

It is possible that Geo investing did a good job in the past. But I think with regards to CGA they are greedy. I
do not speak Chinese but see the comment below from CRMeyer. Geo didn't mention that there are several
factories in their report. Who is lying here?

A guy living in Belton Texas just up the road from me got a wild hair up his butt one day and filed a 13-D with
the SEC suggesting he had bought 1,000,000,000 shares of Google. The next day he reported that he had
bought 1,000,000,000 shares of Apple. Before the third filing was recorded and publicly deseminated
someone let the SEC know that they might be misreporting a major stock transaction.


Maybe you would expect some punishment for this fraudulent filing......nope. The SEC rules apparently have
no punishment provisions for filing anything you want to. Can you imagine the total indifference a Chinese
national must feel when shipping bogus filings to the SEC??


There is very small incentive for the SEC to stand between fools and their lemming like stampede to financial
ruin. Unfortunately MBoller and others haven't understood that the rapacious greed of the founders of these
shams drives them to ignore any rules of fair play. As I often repeat - the short side isn't asking you for any
money. It costs you nothing to believe us. Believe the company at great peril since they already have your
money.

We know the name of the CEO and CFO, we have the address of the firm. 
It is proofed by the SEC that CGA is without any wrongdoing. 
CGA has won awards by chinese goverment for being a credible taxpayer, or CEO has won Awards as one of
the best entrepeneurs. Company was awarded several times by Forbes.


On the other side Seeking Alpha has only anonymous Authors. We have no Address of Geo Investing nor his
authors. I trust in CGA and China, and i have no trus in all these liars here. Maybe CGA was a good short bet
in the past, but it can change. And i hope that these criminals will lose all their money.

I have been investing and trading Chinese stocks for more than 4 years and have experienced heavy losses during
my endeavors. From Lotus Pharmaceuticals (LTUS) to China Organic Agricultural (CNOA). It is just unbelievable what
happened in the China space. Scam artists, promoters, auditors, government institutions ........all are to blame for this
mess. Geo investing, Jon Carnes and many others have done a great job of confronting the companies with evidence
and advise.


Some companies improved their business practices, such as Sino Agro Food (SIAF), but the majority of US Chinese
small caps are still far away of being transparent and open to their shareholders.

True, Chinese stocks are risky. However, similar U.S. companies are risky as well. According to a study which I read
some days ago, 25% of all stocks which are traded OTC or on pink sheet go bankrupt in U.S!


Another study concludes as follows: 
Shell Games: The Long Term Performance of Chinese Reverse Merger Firms (Lee / Li/ Zhang), Summary: 
We examine the financial health and performance of reverse mergers (RMs) that became active on U.S. stock
markets between 2001 and 2010, particularly those from China (around 85% of all foreign RMs). As a group, RMs are
early-stage companies that typically trade over-the-counter. Chinese RMs (CRMs), however, tend to be more mature
and less speculative than either their U.S. counterparts or a group of exchange-industry-size matched firms. As a
group, CRMs outperformed their matched peers from inception through the end of 2013, even after including most of
the firms accused of accounting fraud. CRMs that receive private-equity (PIPE) financing from sophisticated investors
perform particularly well. Overall, despite the negative publicity, we find little evidence that CRMs are inherently toxic
investments. Our results shed light on the risk-performance trade-off for CRMs, as well as the delicate balance
between credibility and access in well-functioning markets.


02 Oct 2014, 11:41 AM


nemesisjudge
This study only considers a sample instead of the whole group. For example, in 2010, the total sample size
was only 24 companies out of a total possible population of 257. That sample includes both Chinese and
comparative US reverse mergers, so it is debatable whether this sample size provides an accurate
representation of the bigger picture.


The study also appears to make comparisons against US reverse mergers, instead of comparing against the
stock market as a whole. For most investors, comparisons against the rest of the stock market are more
relevant because that is more indicative of their potential investment universe, rather than comparisons being
confined to US reverse merger stocks as the only alternative.


The Bloomberg Reverse Merger Index, which showed a collapse in the value of Chinese Reverse Merger
stocks (before the index itself was apparently abandoned), tells a very different story about Chinese reverse
mergers based on their absolute share price performance, rather making comparisons to US reverse
mergers. So you still get a lousy absolute overall investment performance by investing in Chinese reverse
mergers.


In one of the last pages of this study it also says:


"We hasten to point out that our findings do not imply that the U.S. listing requirements of RM firms are
adequate, or the governance problems associated with Chinese firms are unimportant. On the contrary, our
evidence shows that a substantial proportion of CRMs do succumb to accounting fraud."

Unless you only ever intend to invest in reverse merger stocks, there are better much alternatives. For
Chinese reverse merger company investments, you will need to have extremely sharp forensic accounting
skills, a clear understanding of how Chinese frauds work, and be aware of how easy it is to manipulate the
share price of generally illiquid stocks.


02 Oct 2014, 01:57 PM


Michu
This is only one study which does not give you the full picture. Other papers mention the same aspects. See
for example


"Do investors overpay for stocks with lottery-like payoffs, An Examination of the returns of OTC Stocks".  
They conclude: We study returns on Over-The-Counter stocks and we find these returns are extremely
negative on average. The distribution of OTC stock returns is highly positively-skewed: while many of the
stocks in our sample become worthless, a few do extremely well. We investigate whether this negative return
premium can be rationalized by investors' preference for positively-skewed payoffs.


They find that 25% of all OTC stocks lose 99% of their value and a negative alpha for OTC stocks overall of
minus 2% per month. 
My recommendation is therefore: Avoid OTC and pink sheet stocks (U.S. or Chinese does not matter) as their
expected performance is extremely poor.

See the above May 22, 2014 Interview Transcript of CGA Jinong Gate Guard, last page, where the gate guard states
that, "Yes. The company is a large one, and it has THREE or FOUR factories. We are just one of them." So, you
apparently chose the smallest one to feature, choosing not to mention the other LARGER CGA factories.


02 Oct 2014, 01:48 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
CGA reports in SEC filings it has factories at Jinong (2 facilities in one complex) and Gufeng (8 facilities in
one complex). The transcript shows that the guard said that the Jinong factory is the only one in Shanxi
province. CGA has never disclosed any other Jinong or Gufeng factories. So I conclude that the investigators
filmed the right place.


02 Oct 2014, 04:01 PM


CRMeyer
My guess is there's still a conflict here. According to the May 22, 2014 Interview Transcript of CGA Jinong
Gate Guard, top of page 4, the gate guard responds to the question, "Okay, So this is the only factory in
Yanglin, right?", and he responds that, "Yes, that's right, the only one in Yanglin and Shanxi province. OTHER
FACTORIES ARE LOCATED IN BEIJING AND XINJIANG." So the investigators may NOT have filmed the
right place...

And then the guard goes on to say, "THIS factory is under Jinong, and is a subsidiary of another company.
That company is in Xi'an." So there is more here than meets the eye...

In addition, I don't think that these short traders did a great thing for investors.


It is true that they wiped out some fraudulent companies. However, because the stock price of many Chinese firms
were hit by the allegations of short sellers, these companies decided to go private. Obviously, these were good and
legitimate firms (otherwise to go private does not make sense) and they are not available anymore for investors.


I think that short traders did mostly a great job for themselves.

Don't forget the companies that went dark, leaving investors with empty hands. Most of the companies went
for the easy money to the American capital markets, but forgot the playbook rules (corporate governance, IR,

Criminal stock promoters could bring glory and fame to these Chinese companies, we know what happened

Of course the short traders did a great job primarily for themselves. Why else would they go investigate and
publish their findings? The point is that they accelerated the fall of the share price, which is why we are pissed
at them. But the inevitable remains: if the findings are true, the outcome is fair.


I wanted to sell the shares for some time already (I disliked the "online-to-offline" buzzing and did not believe
in the new "fertilizer for organic products exchange" system). This thing only helped me to decide to actually
do it. I hoped for a better exit price, sure. But I was already leaving anyway. I just like businesses that I can
understand (and trust).

Learned my China lesson through PUDA 3 years ago. Indiginous metalurgical coal producer supplying the then

listened to our national business news talking heads who basically poo pooed those reports. Last 99.99% at this
point. Will never touch another China company, nor will I keep a company that does any kind of junior
venture/partnership with any of them. Am still waiting for news that the Chinese president of PUDA has been
convicted and told before sentence that his organs will be used for animal cancer research. Won't happen though,
because he greased the palms that control the machine. If it says China, beware, whether it be a company, shirt, farm
raised shrimp (which they will not eat themselves), car parts (if it looks like a brake pad, it is a brake pad). Beware

I sold my stocks now although in my comments above I was quite critical about the Geo report. However, Geo did
send me some further information and it seems that Geo tried to write a honest report. It seems that CGA has 2
facilities in one complex in Jinong. In addition, I recently lost some money with the fraud of Lihua International.


Further, I remember that another writer, Chris Wu who visited the company, did conclude that CGA is a fraud some
year ago. On the other hand, a positive sign is that management of CGA quickly denied the allegations. A very
confusing case.

$LIWA is exactly the reason why I am rather glad I had a chance to exit CGA with a reasonable price. I never
had a chance to exit LIWA after the report (trading was halted soon after the report), and when it finally
opened on OTC, it took my broker two days to allow me to sell it (yes, it seems weird). Byt then, the drop was
so huge I did not really care about selling anymore and thus I still own the (now somewhat worthless)
position.


It was a sad story. All the reports seemed great, up until they were declared unreliable. Sad story.

How can anyone take anything from the conference call transcript? The conversation between Li Tao and Bill

poor, you'd think these companies could hire a trained court reporter/stenographer for a couple hours each quarter.
That way, anyone who misses the conference call doesn't have to suffer through an amateur transcript. Couple the
poor transcript with the fact that Li Tao either doesn't speak English that well, or is being intentionally dense, and you
have yourself an utterly useless transcript.  
Great article by the way. Year long surveillance and analysis! Hats off to that.

Another thing is that this stock is incredibly cheap. The company has an equity of 332 millions and a market
capitalization of only 69 millions. You only pay 20 cents for 1 dollar of equity. So even if half of the assets in the
balance sheet do not exist and operations are much smaller, this stock is still very cheap.


So the short seller probably picked the completely wrong company.

The reason they make up the numbers is to rob the investors...you. Fraud isn't their way of to build a

no concern for normal corporate value metrics.

I sold my CGA stocks so I have no interest to defend the company. You are probably right - if this is really a
fraud the stock could be completely worthless. My point is that it is hard to say and I am wondering, because
this company is in business for many years and survived SEC investigations.


In addition, they quickly denied the allegations (e.g. for Lihua Interational fraud, this was not the case). The
Geo study might be accurate, but they could have made also a lot of mistakes in their observations (To begin
with: not to include all relevant factories).


05 Oct 2014, 01:38 PM

In my opinion the strongest argument to sell (and this is why I did) is probably the following: It is unclear if this
company is fully legitimate. There are a lot of other stocks out there, why should you take the risk and keep
this stock if there are many alternatives?

Tyco had an SEC investigation and it was cleared. Later on, Tyco became one of the most famous frauds in
US corporate history. One reason why the fraud was not initially uncovered was because the SEC was
focusing on fraud occurring in specific areas, whereas the fraud was actually happening in other areas. This
miss was partly due to the SEC's limited resources and time constraints.


In the case of CGA, its historic SEC investigation was almost certainly limited by difficult access to certain
documents and other material in China. Firm evidence is needed for a prosecution. To date, the relevant
Chinese authorities' co-operation with the SEC has been patchy and selective at best. Moreover, auditors for
US listed Chinese companies are refusing to hand over respective audit working papers to the SEC for
examination because of very broad brush Chinese state secrets laws. These are just a few of the reasons
why there are a number of seemingly fraudulent Chinese reverse merger companies that are still listed and
trading at pumped up values in the US today, and some very good reasons why investors should continue to
be extremely wary of them.


This Geo report on CGA has provided evidence that will almost certainly get the SEC to ask questions again.
The NYSE may also want further clarification. The auditors will come under increased scrutiny as well. It is
hard to say how quickly things will move, maybe a few weeks or possibly a couple of years. I can see in the
CGA filings there are a number of huge red flags that are consistent with Geo's claims, so I do not think that
this will ultimately end well for CGA investors unless the company can find some mug to finance a going
private deal.

Beijing battles heaviest snowfall in decades with shovels and bamboo 
http://bit.ly/1usVSs5 
No plows? No problem. Residents, workers, and soldiers in China’s capital dug through eight inches of snow using
shovels and – at the new international airport – bamboo twig brushes. 
By Peter Ford, Staff Writer JANUARY 4, 2010


BEIJING — The Chinese capital is not used to snow. Winters here are among the driest I have ever experienced. So
when a storm on Sunday dumped nearly eight inches of powder onto the city – the most since 1951 – life pretty much
ground to a halt.


By Monday morning, though, armies of citizens (and the Army itself in some districts) were clearing the aftermath
using the tactic that the Chinese so often use in tackling unusual challenges – mass manpower.


Snowplows were nowhere to be seen. Instead, in bright sunlight signaling a reprieve from the snow – if not from the
bitter cold – men and women made the streets loud with the clatter and bang of shovels as they broke up the packed
ice and snow and swept it into piles.


Recommended: IN PICTURESIce and snow sculptures 
They didn’t need to be told to do this. A standing city ordinance makes every work unit – be it a shop, a business, or a
government department – responsible for “cleaning spittle, filth, rubbish, puddles and snow” from the ground in front
of their premises.

PHOTOS OF THE DAY Photos of the day 02/08 
Unusually for modern-day Beijing, where the automobile has long displaced the bicycle, the street sweepers made
clearing a bicycle lane their first priority, at least in my part of town. They shoveled an 18-inch wide swath along the
curb, and piled the snow into a long ridge which offered welcome protection from the car drivers – unused to these
sorts of conditions – skidding and fishtailing all over the place.


This manual approach is more or less OK when it comes to getting the city back in gear (though schools were closed
on Monday), but it proved less than satisfactory at Beijing’s gleaming new international airport.


Ninety percent of flights were canceled or delayed on Sunday, and my elder son, sitting on the tarmac for three hours
in a stranded London-bound plane, explained to me over the phone why: Two of the three runways were closed, and

the other was being kept more or less open in a most old-fashioned manner: hordes of airport workers wielding the
kind of long-handled bamboo twig brushes that have been in use here for centuries.

Poor little investor
GEO had another shot at AFSI not long ago and check what happened to the stock. It speaks of the quality of their
work.


Why would anyone trust a short seller who dares not use his real name? What to hide?


If CGA is a fraud, the best gain is $2. If not, the company is worth at least $10-20 based on a normal p/e and $0.4
annual dividend. The risk and reward ratio is simply not here. There is other ridiculous valuation in the market to short.
For the same reason, CGA can be a nice speculative long.

Doubts will always hang over this stock. Look at the recent cc transcript. The questions from analysts are not
of the sort asked of legit companies "how are you going to adress falling revenues/new competition/new
regulatory blah blah blah?" The questions instead seem to be attempts to determine if these revenues/this
company are indeed legit. They are asking how sales are recorded to try to determine if they have
misinterpreted previous regulatory filings, or the filings are indeed full of s#it. Whats worse is that the answers
from CGA seem to avoid the question. http://seekingalpha.co...


Thus it will never achieve a normal P/E.

Read the transcript. Analysts appear to be sussing out the company to see if they have an unconventional
manner of reporting revenues or the revenues are indeed overstated. For example "Nick Jones - Desert
Capital Venture 
And following up my last question, do you book those sales under Jinong or Gufeng?" 
Analysts are trying to figure if sales have been double booked. Good sign?


The answers from CGA do not appear to clear up concerns. Since only 1/6th of reported revenues actually
exist, a P/E of 15 or so is never going to happen. In that case a P/E of 2-3 is more appropriate. I'm going to
say 2 because the stock is at risk from an SEC halt.

If the revenue were only 1/6, so therefore earnings must also be maximum 1/6, but still the headline is :" ...
bla, bla.. vanashing cash." 
How can they claim cash is vanashed, if they belief everything is fake ? 
It makes no sense.

apologies for the double/triple post above. I thought the headline for the article was good. For those willing to review
the evidence put forward here by the Geoteam, I don't think any will see CGA as a good long. This is one of those
situations where the writing is on the wall for all who care to look, but a select few are attempting, unsuccessfully, to
obscure that writing. There is a reason this stock is trading at half of book value. Consider that for a moment and ask
yourself if CGA can afford to pay that dividend.

Racism? Have you seen the markets enthusiasm for quality stocks from China? What about Ali baba trading
at over 20 times price to book, even after a pull back from the IPO highs. What about Baidu, trading at about
10 times price to book. Most Americans have never even used Baidu and are willing to invest. Racism isn't
the reason for CGA's miserable valuation, suspicion is.

To begin with, an extraordinary number of puts on our stock are due to expire this month while the short sellers had
shorted our stock for the past 10 to 12 months. We learned that this activity was pegged to some kind of "significant
event."


We all know that October 1 is the National Day in China followed by a seven-day-long holidays week. On October 1,
2014, we announced a dividend payment to our shareholders with the record date set on October 31, 2014.
Ovezealous short sellers abruptly published their article post to our dividend announcement. Such action reveals their
desperate attempt to illegally manipulate the market before their puts expire.


We subsequently refuted the allegations on October 2 during the holidays. After that, we also announced investor
days on October 7 and hosted the two-day-investor-days event in Xi'an and Beijing on October 15 and 17,
respectively. On October 16, short sellers alleged the Company with false presentation again. Apparently, shorts
made another desperate move intended to damage the Company again before their put options expire on October 18.


We have been in the agriculture business for over 14 years. We have numerous customers worldwide. We have one
of the finest fertilizer product lines in China and are currently engaged in an exciting new business model at the
Internet era. I am incredibly proud of our Company. I condemn the short sellers' scheme as the capital market
terrorism. Just like our governments, I don't and will never negotiate with terrorists.


The shorts said they did 344 days of time-lapse surveillance of the Company's fertilizer factory, which showed we only
shipped around 10 percent of the sales volume reported. They also said they did 51 days of time-lapse surveillance of
Gufeng factory and found 24 percent to 34 percent less volume shipped compared to sales volume reported. This is
untrue.


Not only being untrue (which will be explained below), unauthorized video surveillance over a corporation is illegal
serious crime espionage in China where the Company's operations are based. The surveillance, over time, was part
of the short sellers' deliberate and destructive scheme aimed at weakening the Company's performance in the capital
market. By publishing fraudulent allegations on the Internet, the short sellers had spread misleading presentations via
illegal surveillance. The short sellers' business model is to disrupt the public with misleading information, sabotage the
Company during the holidays, profit from the drops of the Company's share price, and destroy the Company with
unprecedented tactics. The short sellers, who had engaged in corporate espionage, are saboteurs. They concealed
their identities because they are afraid of the consequence of their malicious actions. The law enforcement in China
does not take the espionage crime lightly. The city's police department in Xi'an had already taken up the case. The
anti-business-crime task force in the police department is currently pursuing this as espionage, and will actively
prosecute the liable saboteurs.


To fulfill the shipping requirement in the production process, we used various means of transportation such as
vehicles, railroad trains, air cargo carriers, third parties, and pipelines to move raw materials, inventories, finished
goods, as well as supply of parts and logistics from one location to another. Our sales of products were shipped,
recorded, collected, summarized, concluded, reported, and evidenced in complete set of records, documents,
invoices, receipts, payments, statements, and papers. We use a network of distributors to sell products. Our
distributors are well capable of making the best of our products as well as their benefits via various shipping methods.
The video clips recorded by the illegal surveillance do not contain the complete sales. If the video clips from illegal
surveillance over one location had been sufficient to examine a Company's sales, video surveillance would have been
adopted as an efficient and sufficient procedure in the accounting and auditing standard. There is no way that the
video clips can be relied upon to measure a Company's revenue. We also do not consider the clips are genuine.

These clips are currently in the evidence room under forensic analysis, and will be for the law enforcement's use to
prosecute the saboteurs in the espionage case.


As a Nevada corporation with operating subsidiaries in China, we are obliged to timely report our financial results
including revenues and earnings to the regulators and tax authorities in both China and U.S. Our financial reports, tax
payments and filings, as well as other registration statements, are subject to all means of comprehensive
examinations and audits from various entities in both China and U.S., including but not limited to, auditors, state
administration of industries and commerce, tax agencies, and credit lenders. We had paid all taxes including income
taxes and always fulfilled our reporting duties in both countries. We firmly stand by the consistent information
contained in all our filings in both China and U.S. and we are fully committed to the reliability and transparency of
financial reporting.


It had been a widely-known and well-documented fact that reports filed with certain authorities in China do not reflect
the comprehensive income and financial condition for many companies, and might be different from reports to the
authorities in U.S. The difference in reporting occurs particularly on small or middle size companies, who choose not
to reveal all financial information in order to avoid disclosing their operating metrics to competitors, suppliers and
customers. Albeit the different reporting schedules, procedures and practices in China and the U.S., we had managed
to reconcile the historical difference between the reported results to the authorities in China and U.S., i.e., any of our
reported filings in both China and U.S. are accurate and consistent. We will continue to fully, consistently, and
accurately report our sales and revenue figures to all authorities in both countries.


In the shorts' article, the shorts said they interviewed current and former employees, one of whom was an ex-
manager and said that the Company's factory exaggerated production. Again, this is outrageous.


In the first so-called interview, the short sellers purported themselves as beverage salesmen. They solicited with
disguises at the Company's premise at daylight time. By committing such unauthorized acts, the short sellers
purposely disregarded of the Company's official visitor policy and trespassed on the Company's property. Their
intentionally wrongful interference violated the Company's security codes. The disguised intrusion constituted another
crime of corporate espionage. We believe the interview was a scheme of setup and the content was false. Law
enforcement is currently pursuing this case. The prosecutors in China had detained the so-called interviewee related
to the scheme and will hold the parties who were involved in the espionage liable and will prosecute the espionage
crime with no leniency.


In the second interview, the short sellers claimed that they interviewed Chen Lianpeng, an alleged former warehouse
director of the Company who started working for the Company since 2008. That is impertinent. Contrary to the short's
claim, Mr. Chen was never a manager at the Company. Instead, he joined the Company as an entry-level employee in
2010. After having worked at the Company for 10 months, Mr. Chen was convicted of committing a series of
professional misconducts in his non-managerial role. During the 10-month period, he had violated the Company's
ethic codes badly numerous times. After reviewing his misdemeanors, the human resource division took disciplinary
action and terminated Mr. Chen's employment in 2011. During his tenure at the Company, Mr. Chen had never acted
in any managerial role and was never hired again by the Company. The discharge was the penalty to his
misconducts. Law enforcement in China had detained Mr. Chen. We strongly condemn that the so-called "interviews"
for them being both malevolent and manipulative. In addition to the centralized volume productions, we conduct pilot
production and rapid production in locations closer to markets and clients with proprietary formulas, technologies, and
oversights. The truthfulness of such an interview should never be relied upon.

On October 16, the shorts distorted the comments from the Company's employee, Ms Qi Hongli. Ms. Qi is a current
member of the Company's design team and had been involved in some improvement projects during the Company's
numerous campaigns for marketing infrastructure development. The number of outlets that one employee had been
working on does not necessarily equal to the number of all the premises that the whole company had sponsored,
supported, developed, owned, franchised, including but not limited to, franchise units, proprietary outlets, retail stores,
chains, and retail stands etc. Relating only a subset of the entire outlet family, which one employee had been working
on, as the population size of the whole sales outlets, is misleading.


The shorts alleged "the auditor, Kabani, signed off on $113 million of outrageous PP&E reclassifications and deferred
marketing assets wiping out CGA's cash."


Our auditor performed extensive audit procedures on the Company's financial statements per the auditing standards,
and they communicated with the Audit Committee with the procedures performed and the results found.


None of the auditors' audit reports on our financial statements for the past fiscal years regarding the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion since 2012, nor was
any such reports has ever been modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In addition, at no
point during the past fiscal years, were there any disagreements between our auditors on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or procedures, where disagreement(s), if not
resolved to the satisfaction of our auditors, would result in "reportable events" as such term is defined in Item 304(a)
(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, and cause an reporting obligation to make reference


The Company's audit committee and management believe that the Company's financial statements have always fairly
presented, in all material aspects, the Company's financial condition and results of operations during the past fiscal
years, the and that the Company's internal control over financial reporting always remains effective.


Regarding the deferred assets, it represents the amounts that the distributors owed to the Company in their marketing
efforts, as well as the cost for developing the promotion equipment to be displayed at the distributors' stores, including
product counters and shelves, and the signs of Jinong brand on the shop facades. Such cost is recorded as deferred
asset which is reported on the balance sheet as a long-term asset. Such marketing and promotion costs are
expensed as selling expense over three years as per the term as stated in the co-operation agreement. The process
of systematically reducing this deferred asset is known as amortizing the marketing and promotion costs.


The shorts erroneously claimed that the PP&E reclassifications constitute a capex fraud that is serious enough to halt
and delist the Company. Again, facts show that these laughable statements are deceitful.


I cannot help but laugh at how poor the shorts are in understanding basic accounting principles and how ignorant they
were by making irresponsible and idiotic claims. Such poor claims illustrate the shorts know nothing about financial
reporting. Instead of "professional analysts" they claimed to be, they are no more than bogus liars.


The Company had disclosed the deferred asset timely in quarterly and annual reports since the beginning fiscal year
2014. Deploying deferred assets had been an integral part of the Company's marketing strategy in five-to-ten-year
time line. We had been implementing such marketing tactics as early as 2010. Historically, the cost of developing the
promotion equipment was recorded as part of the Jinong's PP&E. In fiscal year 2014, we scaled up the deployment of
such marketing asset to support marketing campaign. Based on the fact that such promotion equipment are displayed
at the distributors' stores instead of utilized by the Company directly, we determined that it is more appropriate to
reclassify such costs into deferred assets and present them separately on the balance sheet due to their nature and

significance. We deployed $72MM, $31MM, and $9MM in 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively, and got reported in
cash flows from investing activities in the financial statement. It is typical in financial reporting for issuers to represent
historical assets out of seasoned categories to newly added categories as a result of asset or liability reclassification
to fairly compare the similar assets year over year.


While the short seller blamed us that "for fiscal year 2015, the Company estimates another $41,807,390 amortization
expenses of deferred assets," "resulting in a huge negative impact on earnings," with accordance that growth of
amortization is "far more than management's sales growth forecast," we never take sales expansion lightly -- the hefty
investments in marketing endorsed our decisive commitments to our products and our clients. When we made
investment decision in expanding the deferred assets, we aim at supporting our distributors in a period of five years or
longer, and we are affirmative to help our distributors in promoting their sales by developing retail franchise stores.
Such corporation action was intended to build our marketing infrastructure systematically countrywide.


As mentioned above, we amortize the deferred asset over a three-year use life. The amortization period is based on
term of our co-operation agreement with the distributors involved in our marketing campaign and we timely disclosed
an estimated $31MM and $10MM amortization expenses of the deferred assets for the fiscal year 2016 and 2017 in
Row 9, paragraph "Deferred assets" on page F-8 of the Company's annual report of fiscal year 2014. We expect the
marketing efforts will introduce improvement in sales over time concurrently with the decrease in amortization
expenses in the next fiscal years.


The short sellers stated that "$26,890,321 at June 30, 2014" "subtracting $25,700,586 of customer deposits leaves
the Company with only $1,189,735." This statement is simply incorrect as it does not include any consideration of
other current assets such as account receivable with $88,781,608, advances to suppliers with $32,630,865, and
inventory with $75,486,898 which are reported on the financial statement as of fiscal year 2014.,


The shorts alleged that they were blocked from obtaining information. That is also fictitious. We have consistently
welcomed inquiries and visitors to our offices and transparently provided information about all relevant aspects of our
production, management and sales through every possible channels. Any number of shareholders, analysts and
potential investors can attest to that.

Only analyst following CGA cuts rating to Sell, says management wouldn't answer her questions or allow her to attend
investor days, which she thinks may have been staged:


http://bit.ly/1yaOG43


CGA – Change in rating. Our rating of China Green Agriculture is changed to Sell from Buy. Since the collapse of
valuations for small-cap, China-based companies, CGA has traded generally downward from a peak stock price in
early 2010. Since taking profits during that period, we have been following a strategy of trading the stock on technical
indicators in order to accumulate gains that would improve total return on our remaining shares. Our view has
changed in recent weeks as we have become concerned the management team has been less than forthcoming
regarding the Company’s fundamental performance.


The Company recently announced investor events in Xian and Beijing. While the announcement provided only a two-
week preparation time, we made arrangements for a representative to attend the Beijing event. Indeed, this is the first

investor event ever held by a company in our coverage universe where we did not have at least a three-month notice
of the date. Our attempts to register for the event were not acknowledged. We are aware of others that attempted to
attend the event, but were also unable to register. Indeed, prior to the investor event announcement, we had made
numerous attempts to contact the Company by e-mail and telephone. None of our messages were answered. We
asked a senior executive of another public China company to contact China Green Agriculture with a reference for
Crystal Equity Research and we presented the Company’s legal representation in the U.S. with details of our
questions. None of these overtures were acknowledged, despite the U.S. attorney’s assurances that our questions
would be answered.


When we were unable to register for the investor event, we had again contact the Company’s attorney by e-mail and
by phone. We received a receipt for the e-mail and our call was answered by the attorney, who then claimed she
could not understand the conversation as soon as we identified Crystal Equity Research. Finally, after both investor
events were over, we received an e-mail message from China Green Agriculture’s investor relations representative,
indicating that it was too late to register for the events. The message provided evidence that all of our messages were
more than likely received and that no technical problem existed to prevent China Green Agriculture personnel from
answering our questions or giving our agent access to the investor event.


The sequence of messages as well as the conduct of the U.S. attorney and investor relations representative, have
given rise to suspicion that the investor events were staged. We suspect that China Green Agriculture management
has deliberately not responded to questions and that they did not intend to allow legitimate analysts to attend the
events.


The appearance of misconduct casts a different light on other corporate actions, namely the significant investment in
a marketing program that has required over $100 million dollars in cash investment over the past three years. Granted
the number of participating retail store has increased dramatically to over 26,000 at the end of the last fiscal year. Yet
the expenditure is significant on a per store basis given costs of signage and displays in China. If the investment
leads to higher sales in the long term, then it is easily justified. However, the lack of transparency around the program
and the change in accounting treatment now look deceptive. The marketing program is organized in such a way that it
could be easily compromised by fraudulent retailers or unethical employees.


Given that it appears the Company’s legal representation may be complicit in management’s efforts to avoid investor
scrutiny, we also have less confidence in the Company’s financial reports. The reclassification of the marketing
program assets from PP&E to deferred revenue was overlooked previously as an understandable mistake. Now we
have concerns that the auditor could be more a conspirator as well. That casts new doubt on the integrity of the
financial reports


While we had been managing our position in CGA using technical analysis and paid only tangential attention to
fundamental developments over the past couple of years, we find unacceptable the apparent lack of respect for
legitimate investor inquiry. In our view, it is preferable to exit CGA with a loss than continue to hold a potentially toxic
asset in the portfolio. We recommend divesting of this position as after the dividend record date of October 31st has
passed. We note that the stock could appreciate in value if the broader market turns more favorably toward small-
capitalization companies. Periods of trading strength would be preferable timing for position liquidation.

GeoInvesting, when you started your attack against CGA you said this:


"We doubt that CGA has the capability or desire to actually pay this dividend. CGA's dividend announcement reminds
us of China Media Express (OTCPK:CCME), which announced a dividend policy following a short seller's report
calling the company a fraud. CCME never paid."


I now see the CGA dividend in my account and, just to be sure, I also checked with my broker to make sure they do
not post dividends to customer accounts prior to actually getting payment from the company and this fact was
confirmed. How does this change your view about the legitimacy of the company?

Dead Wrong on the dividend. Making an assumption based upon some other unrelated Chinese company that failed
to pay a dividend was not only wrong but somewhat tainted with prejudice, IMHO.


XI'AN, China, Feb 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — China Green Agriculture, Inc. (NYSE: CGA; "China Green Agriculture",
"CGA" or the "Company"), a company that mainly produces and distributes humic acid-based compound fertilizers,
other varieties of compound fertilizers and agricultural products through its subsidiaries in China, today announced
that the Company made the payment of the previously announced dividend on January 30,2015. The dividend was
previously announced on October 1, 2014.


The dividend is of US$0.10 per share to the Company's stockholders of common stock of record as of the close of
business day on October 31, 2014.


“This dividend was of its first kind in the Company’s history. It demonstrates our commitment to growth momentum
and strong financial position. The Company reiterates its policy of returning value to shareholders as we aim to fulfill

our strategy of developing the new business model." stated Mr. Tao Li, Chairman and CEO of the Company, " As
effective stewards of capital for our shareholders, we also recognize the benefits of returning capital to shareholders
as a means of maximizing return on equity. The payment of the foregoing dividend is our latest effort in doing so."


What other allegations are inaccurate or meaningless in this report? ...is the question that investors must ask
themselves. The company is grossly undervalued but it must can get past all the unproven allegations that it has been
battling for years: http://bit.ly/16feL9g CGA has does a weak job in investor relations but it has stood the test of time
regarding all the attacks and is poised for further gains.
