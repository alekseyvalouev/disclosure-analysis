FuelCell's Backlog Faces A Steep Cliff
Mar. 24, 2014 10:20 AM ET64 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


FuelCell's largest customer (POSCO) is going away.


Order levels have been too low to offset the POSCO loss and FuelCell is at risk of
missing estimates.


Due to the POSCO loss, we believe FuelCell's cash burn will accelerate.


We believe FuelCell (NASDAQ:FCEL) is a compelling short due to the steep cliff the
company faces as POSCO, its dominant customer, transitions away from FuelCell. Since
signing large one-time contracts from POSCO and Dominion in late 2012 and early 2013,
FCEL has signed few orders of any size for additional fuel cells. With the POSCO order
book running out, FCEL is at risk of missing estimates and seeing declines in sales and
increased losses. Our price target for FCEL is $1.00/share, for a potential return of 60%.


POSCO is a major customer that is going away


Over the past three years, POSCO has accounted for 44%, 76%, and 54% of revenues,
as per the latest 10-K (here).


When viewed in dollars, the amount from POSCO is striking.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2105103-fuelcells-backlog-faces-a-steep-cliff 2/18


Furthermore, we understand that POSCO accounts for essentially all of FCEL's remaining
$144.6 million and 95MW of product backlog. Unfortunately, that's almost completely
going away. According to the terms of the contract signed in 2012 (here), POSCO is
building its own manufacturing facility in South Korea that is expected to be operational in
2015. Once open, POSCO will stop ordering from FCEL, start manufacturing its own fuel
cell kits, and pay only a 3% royalty. In other words, if POSCO continues its current rate,
FCEL's revenues from POSCO will go from $101 million today to only $3 million once
POSCO opens its manufacturing plant! That is a 52% drop in total revenue from current
levels!


Order trends are not encouraging


The only way FCEL can offset the steep decline from POSCO is through significant new
orders. However, the volume of new orders over the last 4 consecutive quarters has been
anemic, to say the least. As a result, product backlog (the lifeline of the company) has
fallen nearly 45% since 1Q 2013.


Even if the company starts booking new product orders, they would have to be incredibly
large in order to offset the looming POSCO declines. We think this is highly unlikely due to
the high cost of FCEL's technology, which has only been implemented in areas with

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2105103-fuelcells-backlog-faces-a-steep-cliff 3/18


stringent renewable mandates. While sell-side analysts expect significant growth in
revenues, we believe FCEL is facing dramatic revenue declines. Its order book and recent
orders make this clear.


Negative cash flows will accelerate


To make matters worse is FCEL's consistent cash drain. As of January 31, 2014, FCEL
had $104.6 million of cash, or only $0.41 per share. However, FCEL's cash drain over the
last 3 years has averaged $32 million per year, or $0.13 per share.


During the most recent quarter, FCEL had negative Cash Flow from Operations of $5
million and spent another $1 million on capital expenditures for a total of $6 million in
negative Free Cash Flow. On an annualized basis, this is another $0.09 per share of cash
that FCEL will quickly burn from its $0.41 per share balance.


Once POSCO transitions to its own manufacturing plant, we expect FCEL's cash drain to
become even more significant and put further strain on FCEL's share price.


Conclusion: 60% risk to FCEL share price


We think FCEL faces a significant risk once POSCO's current order backlog run outs. With
no large orders added to its backlog, FCEL faces a steep drop in revenues, significant
cash drain, and potential financial distress. We generously value FCEL at a more than
100% premium to its current cash balance of $0.41 per share and therefore give the stock
a price target of $1.00 per share. This represents nearly 60% downside from today's price.

I guess that must be why POSCO has purchased more than 30.7 million shares of FCEL to date -- becoming its
largest shareholder -- because it sees no future in the company or return on investment. Yep, no doubt you've talked
to numerous senior managers over at POSCO to back up your thesis on their lack of investment planning or foresight.
Or could it possibly be that this $22 billion South Korean industrial leader might be just a bit more astute regarding
their energy investments than a few bloggers boasting recent college degrees?

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  POSCO bought the stock at $1.50 per share and also received a licensing agreement. I
believe that it is this licensing agreement that will ultimately be the undoing of the company because it will
lead to a massive decline in revenue at FCEL as POSCO brings production in-house.


24 Mar 2014, 11:27 AM


jacob1
Presumably then POSCO could have entered into its multi-year manufacturing and licensing agreements with
FCEL solely, exclusive of them also 'investing' in and acquiring a substantial ownership stake in the company.

Out of the three stocks mentioned, BLDP has at least some technology IP.


But all three companies mentioned still lose money, no operating profits.


If you think hydrogen is "here" you will be in for a rude awakening. It will take many more years and
companies like PLUG are only niche players if the technology goes mainstream.


There's also huge downside risk. See yesterday where all three stocks lost 20+%. This is for traders who like
rollercoasters, not investors.

Mr Kwon Oh joon CEO of POSCO as saying that the steel maker will try to attract financial and strategic investors.
Making profits is the most urgent task for POSCO. The company will do its utmost to attract financial and strategic
investors for its business projects.


Mr Kwon said that POSCO has no plans to engage in expansion for the time being, instead it will seek to improve its
financial health by streamlining, selling stakes in its affiliates and raising funds through initial public offerings of
unlisted ones. For the whole of 2013, POSCO saw its net profit plunge 43% to 1.36 trillion won from KRW 2.39 trillion
a year earlier.


He said that “An excessive oversupply of steel products globally is posing a big threat to POSCO. It’s time to overhaul
our financial and management structure to enhance competitiveness.”


Mr Kwon, who previously served as president and technology chief at POSCO has outlined a broad plan to regain
fundamental competitiveness as a steel maker. Under the slogan of POSCO the Great he outlined four goals that will
be pursued.


He said that “First and foremost, POSCO plans to strengthen its fundamental competitiveness by introducing
advanced technologies and aggressive marketing. We will set up a solutions center to preemptively respond to
customer demand and increase sales of high end thick steel plates and energy related steel products.”

integrate businesses depending on their growth potential. It will also step up efforts to secure core raw materials such
as lithium and nickel, while CONTINUING TO INVEST IN THE FUEL CELL AND OTHER “CLEAN ENERGY”
BUSINESSES.


Finally, the company plans to reorganize its management structure including personnel, work processing and
corporate culture. It plans to cut the number of business divisions to four from the current six in order to facilitate the
decision making process.


He added that “We will reduce the number of executives who lead the business divisions by 40%. The affected
executives will be sent to marketing, steel mills and overseas business operations. Skilled workers in their own fields
are expected to play a bigger role for the growth of the company.”

There certainly is some risk to what this article points to in regards to the orderbook. But there is nothing to say that
the Posco plant will exclusively be able to fill all of the orders from the S Korean marketplace in the near term. I still
see some orders coming to Torrington to supplement this. I also expect orders to pick up in the near term stateside,
as utilities start to see the results from the Bridgeport project. If these scenarios do play out, the royalty from Posco
will be huge for the income statement. This will be very beneficial to FCEL becoming a profitable company.

alpha exposure: what are the products that Posco has been buying off FCEL for 2011, 12 and 13?


I find the article a bit unclear, has Posco been purchasing fuel cell power directly from FCEL? I do see tthe agreement
from nov5/2012 is for Posco to start building then their own fuel cell power plants using FCEL's technology, and
paying FCEL for this.


24 Mar 2014, 01:47 PM

also alpha exposure: i believe you actually got the royalty thing wrong. The nov 5/2012 article indicates a 3%
royalty is paid only on the sale of the power plants. In this article, you indicate that FCEL would be getting this
3% royalty on the amount of fuel cells Posco is buying from one of the power plants it constructs. That is not
correct per the nov 5/2012 p/r.


So since FCEL is getting 3% from sold power plants (build using it's technology it licensed to Posco), that
amount could be much higher than the revenues it is receiving now from energy sales to Posco. If a power

24 Mar 2014, 02:50 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
The "CELL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND LICENSE AGREEMENT"


is appended to the 8-K from Nov 2012. Here is the 3% royalty language:


Section 4.1 (b):


 
"(b) Running Royalty. A running royalty in the amount of three percent (3%) of POSCO Cells Net Sales shall
be paid by POSCO Energy in U.S. dollars. The royalty payment shall be paid quarterly and within forty-five
(45) calendar days of the end of each calendar quarter."


So then the definition of POSCO Cells Net Sales must be determined. For that we can go to the definitions in
the contract:


"“POSCO Cells Net Sales” shall mean the revenues generated from the sales by POSCO Energy or POSCO
Affiliate of the POSCO Modules; less the POSCO Cells Net Sales Adjustments, all determined in accordance
with Section 4.1(c) below."


So the royalty only applies to "POSCO Modules", but what is a POSCO Module?


"“POSCO Modules” shall mean Fuel Cell Stack Modules manufactured by POSCO under license from FCE. ."


Also note the "less the POSCO Cells Net Sales Adjustments":


"“POSCO Cells Net Sales Adjustments” shall include (a) any Duplicate Royalties amount, and (b) any costs or
expenses incurred for DFC Components, DFC Module Kits, or any components or parts for the POSCO Cells,
purchased by POSCO Energy and/or any POSCO Affiliate from FCE.


Further, sales and purchases, by and between POSCO Energy and any POSCO Affiliate to effect the sales of
POSCO Cells to customers shall be excluded from the revenues to be counted for the purpose of POSCO
Cells Net Sales only to the extent such POSCO Cells are not put into use or operation by such POSCO
Affiliate. If such POSCO Cells are subsequently resold to third parties, such subsequent sale to the third party
shall be included for the revenues to be counted for the purpose of POSCO Cells Net Sales."


 
The PR states:


"POSCO Energy will also pay a 3.0 percent royalty to FuelCell Energy for each power plant built and sold by
POSCO Energy during the next 15 years. This royalty is expected to develop into a consistent and growing
revenue stream as the Asian fuel cell market expands. The license agreement may be extended for two
additional terms of five years each by mutual agreement."


It's clear the 3% is on the Modules. i.e. module = "plant" for the PR purposes.

P.S. I generously assumed at even $2,000/kw in cost per module which is $2M /MW. The POSCO plant is
expected to run about 100 MW per year of manufacturing capacity so assuming even $2K/kw module sales
and assuming 100% of it is to third parties, we are talking $6M/year in royalties. Likely far lower as the author
as pointed out.


The only thing I disagree with the author on, and strongly, is his/her $1.00 target price. I have trouble getting
anything north of $0 per share on even Herculean assumptions.

FCEL has sales to POSCO until 2016. These fuel cells are booked and contracted for and account for a good bit of
FCEL's back log.


FCEL will stay busy on this backlog through 2016...2016. This is early 2014. Do your DD! It's all been discussed and
put in tables. Go to the FCE site and read.


In the next 2-3 years if FCEL does not replace POSCO, they will have a problem. This has been known for the past 2-
years and is why FCEL is languishing at the price it is. What is in this article is NOT new news to anyone who has
done their DD.


Now, if you are invested in FCEL and have done your DD, you believe they will replace POSCO with new work from
the US, Europe and South America, as well as getting their 3% on multiple hundred million $$ or billion dollar sales in
Asia. And, they will be OK.


FCEL's CEO says they have work coming in and based on their partners' needs and sales...this makes sense.


When the work comes in and it is added to the POSCO work, FCEL is profitable and will likely be profitable for several
years prior to POSCO ending.


So, short and maybe make some $$ from this price and likely get caught in a squeeze when they announce new
work. Trying to time a stock like this is IMHO just stupid for a retail investor.


FCEL is a belief stock. You own it if you believe there will be a need for a distributed grid using renewables in the
future.


If you understand the company and the stock and the company's place in the grid of the future, buy what you can
afford and wait.

Thought your analysis was good and made some interesting points. What it comes down to is what will the orders be
in the future. If they aren't, you'll of course turn out to be right. But I came away from the year end dialogue with the
impression they were working on some big deals that were just taking time to finalize. I certainly wouldn't want to be
short when they announced a big utility plant (s) contract. This is a bet on their technology being adopted in a big way.

FCEL is a long term play in an industry that shows gigantic potential. Nobody can judge what the next few months will
bring, but any company that can hang around will see a very bright future. It generally doesn't pay to short low priced
stocks, the payoffs aren't big enough. suppose that you're a big player on the short side and you sell 1 million share,
investing $2.43 million. You wrote this article with the idea of making 60% on your money, $1.34 million. Sounds good,
eh? However, if it sells where it did on March 10, up 60% ($3.88), you lose $1.46million. In my opinion, you have to be
sure that the end of the world is coming for FCEL to go short. There are so many variables on the upside that it's way
too risky to be short down here. I mean 2 weeks ago it sold over $4. Who knows who might want to buy into FCEL's
technology? Selling short here is the worst kind of rank speculation. 
I have no position in FCEL or any of the other fuel cell stocks, however I would love to see it go to $1.

The engineering for the product is brilliant. The management and marketing is a disaster.


Did POSCO sell its stock? How can anybody write this report but ignore that? With the massive volume POSCO
might have bailed out. I would be surprised if POSCO didn't learn the technology and go merrily on their way to sell
massive fuel cells throughout the world. FCEL would have no legal recourse. Koreans are far smarter than the FCEL
management.

Whenever the next stock market collapse comes its going to take FCEL with it. I'd take a chance at $.30.

would be required

Before I go further, would you please take a moment and explain your meaing of POSCO's "transitions away from
FuelCell."?


Best regards,

Isn't POSCO constructor here? Doesn't licensing a portion of the technology to a bonifide Asian player make more
sense then FCEL overseeing the repetetive aspects of their business? I think it's called partenering. How much
proprietary hardware will still come from FCEL? Is FCEL working for POSCO or vice versa? I read 3% plus. May not
exactly be Toyota in Tennesee but you get the point. This would seem to be the reasonable conclusion based on
POSCO's stake in FCEL. I'm still not seeing the baby in the discarded bathwater.

You sound like Jim Cramer before he loaded up on the stock and if you don't know what he was doing to it check out
FCEL's message board which I quote here from someone that must know him very well. cchen9830 • Mar 18, 2014

It seem Cramer has changed his tune now that he stocked up and is long on FCEL

I am struck by what seems like a concerted effort to short Fcel on TV and the blog o sphere and by "analysts" to lump
the company in with Ballard and PLUG. That would be like comparing the generators CAT makes to run a hospital in
case of power loss to the little one I drag with me when I go camping. Most surprising has been Cramer. Cramer on
FCEL has been like Bill Akman on Herbalife. I'm surprised to not see a MetLife blimp flying around New Jersey telling
everyone to get rid of FCEL shares.

While the timing wasn't good for me, I have to admit I appreciate this article because it forces me to take a second
look at what seemed like great news back in 2012. This may be the reason the stock couldn't really hold it's gains
back then.


So basically, we're all hoping FCEL will get contracts bigger than the POSCO deal in less than two years or revenue
will drop 52% (give or take). I have little doubt that FCEL can fill the POSCO void, but that just brings us back to even,
which is less than breakeven.


Considering how long it took for FCEL to get the contracts it currently has, what we're really hoping is that their
technology will suddenly be in high demand. But isn't that was we hoped 10 years ago when the stock ran up? We
thought, "what kind of idiots wouldn't see the need to replace coal with natural gas and hydrogen? What kind of idiots
wouldn't want to reinforce our aging electrical grid?"


Apparently, there have been a lot of idiots over the years.


And yes, we may need to rely on other countries to make the sane decision to use fuel cells, but I really don't know
how big that demand potential is (realistic potential based on realistic demand, not just assuming a 100% conversion).


Plus, we're assuming some new or improved technology won't kick FCEL's butt (which I realize is always a risk, but it
still needs to be added to the argument).


Personally, I think FCEL has a good long-term future, but I'm going to drop out for now until they get a replacement
contract. Or I'd be willing to drop back in anywhere under $1.50 (which is where I came in).

Investing is always a gamble, but FCEL is making me feel like betting to win the lottery.

I have bought FCEL in the $1 range over the past few years and on the recent spike sold half my position in the form
of a covered call April $4 at .35. Will be happy to see that call go away. And wait for the next spike on news of a take
over or large order maybe a unfortunate event that will again remind us to look at alternative sources of energy. So
short guy keep it up and hopefully I will be able to purchase more sub $1 FCEL.


25 Mar 2014, 03:17 PM

P.S maybe another forklift company will team up with FCEL to compete with PLUG.

This article is wrong headed. Once the POSCO manufacturing facility is up and running FuelCell Energy will receive
royalties on the production which should increase gross profit. Also, instead of selling stacks to POSCO they will be
able to install complete plants with more profit opportunity.

"FCEL's CEO says they have work coming in and based on their partners' needs and sales...this makes sense. 
I don't think this author realizes the size of the deals they are into now. IIRC Dominion order was $125MM.


When the work comes in and it is added to the POSCO work, FCEL is profitable and will likely be profitable for several
years prior to POSCO ending".


This comment is by thotdoc.


The author of this article states: 
"However, the volume of new orders over the last 4 consecutive quarters has been anemic, to say the least. As a
result, product backlog (the lifeline of the company) has fallen nearly 45% since 1Q 2013".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2105103-fuelcells-backlog-faces-a-steep-cliff 16/18


The crux of this discussion centers on whether or not FCEL can replace what they will lose. The last year's trend
doesn't favor FCEL. BUT, the potential future for the technology does. The fact the CEO of FCEL says 'work is coming
in' is a relative statement and I wouldn't put much into that since he didn't quote actual dollar amounts per contract.


This sector is a hot bed right now and any bullish/bearish article will be heavily scrutinized. Personally, I don't see
FCEL reaching the author's $1.00 price target. 
That alone makes me wary of his present motivation. The hype from the fuel cell sector alone will keep FCEL's share
price well above that figure. I don't have a position in this stock but have watched it closely. If I did, I certainly wouldn't
panic over this article. Investors know the score and would-be's are trying to isolate it's ever-changing support point. If
I waited till it reached $1.00, I might not live that long!

The stock will never see 1 and probably won't see under 2. Learn how to read a chart ,otherwise I recommend any
short to invest their puny odd lots in a money market fund. The stock market eats up fools, any FCEL shorts will are
going to devoured. I don't even care about the fundamentals, but 10 is coming next year.


26 Mar 2014, 07:26 AM


Rick Berger
Learn how to read a hyped-up sector. Charts are no better than crystal balls when it comes to this kind of
volatility. PLUG is spiking/dropping 25-30% a day. PLUG/FCEL/BLDP fundamentals and a quarter will get you
a large gumball.

How interesting that this stock soared 19.75% a day after this post. This article is based solely on the POSCO impact
and negates all other factors which come into play- including the energy market and the chart trends.  
Momentum may even continue into March 26 -

HUGE GROWTH AHEAD- Navigant Research forecasts that global stationary fuel cell revenue will grow from $1.4
billion in 2013 to $40.0 billion in 2022. 
Fuel Cells for Prime Power, Large CHP, Residential CHP, and UPS Applications: Global Market Analysis and
Forecasts


The stationary fuel cell industry continues to be the poster child of the entire global fuel cell sector. Focus on grid
stability is increasing and the costs associated with natural disasters are rising. As a result, the use of fuel cells as
small distributed power plants for grid stabilization or backup is moving forward faster than any other sector in terms
of megawatts.

The principal drivers for adoption continue to be focused on the shifting economics of adoption and the increased
need for more reliable power, as well as increased financing options. Since different countries are facing different pain
points, in terms of power and power availability, the adoption costs of distributed generation (DG) technologies,
including fuel cells, are also different. The core application segments of prime power, large combined heat and power
(CHP), residential CHP (resCHP), and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) continue to grow, albeit at different paces.
In addition, the stationary fuel cell industry is still led by a small number of companies, as just 20 key system players
accounted for over 95% of revenue at the end of 2013. Navigant Research forecasts that global stationary fuel cell
revenue will grow from $1.4 billion in 2013 to $40.0 billion in 2022

Cogeneration & on site power production 3/25/2014 
Fuel Cell CHP passes the point of no return


Fuel Cell Energy Solutions' hybrid DFC-ERGTM power plant recovers energy normally lost during natural gas pipeline
distribution operations Credit: Fuel Cell Energy Solutions


The use of fuel cell technology in combined heat and power applications is commonly viewed as being at an early
stage of development. However, Arjen de Jong and Martin Horstink argue that significant advances in the last 12
months mean this is no longer the case. 
Anyone who believes that fuel cells are stuck in the R&D phase needs a reality check. Last year brought several
remarkable key moments in fuel cell development: 
Fuel cells were outselling other micro-CHP technologies for the first time in history; 
The first fuel cell manufacturers began to break even; 
Startup of several new production sites; and 
Prolonged public funding in Europe and Asia for hydrogen and fuel cells. 
And the end of these positive developments is not in sight, with 2014 promising new commercial product releases,
especially in the micro-CHP field. Thus, the general outlook for fuel cell CHP is excellent. In fact, many organisations
have invested heavily and will have to pursue the way up in order to keep investors satisfied. 
Recent boom 
Japan, and to a lesser extent South Korea, is leading the world in fuel cell CHP. Japan has come a long way, with its
long-term programme called ENE-farm to develop fuel cell CHP technology and persuade end users to buy it. More
than 80,000 units are installed, with sales numbers exceeding yearly sales of other micro-CHP technologies. And
funding for this programme will likely be prolonged for the next few years
