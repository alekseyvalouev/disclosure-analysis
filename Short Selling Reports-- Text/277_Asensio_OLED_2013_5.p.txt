Oppenheimer misleads investors on Universal
Display’s undisclosed risks.


Posted on September 13, 2013 by asensio.com


Yesterday Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. published a rapid response to


our research report on Universal Display Corporation (“UDC”;


NASDAQ: OLED).  Below we explain why we believe that the


Oppenheimer report misleads investors.


Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz offered no evidence of


having read the 57-page investigative report and 9-page legal


opinion that were the subject of our report.  These fact-based


documents are pointedly directed at UDC’s central value claim that


it “owns” phosphorescent OLED.  They were produced by a highly


specialized expert with unique experience and knowledge in this


subject matter.  Mr. Uerkwitz claimed that he understands the facts


and reasoning disclosed by the expert, and then boldly claimed they


are “in the company’s 10-Q.”


The Oppenheimer report appears even more fundamentally


misleading than UDC’s own disclosures about its past loss of patent


claims in European Patent No. 1449238 (“EP-238”) or the difficulties


it has faced in defending its key patent claims at the appeal level at


the European Patent Office’s (“EPO”), where they face final


judgment.  This patent represents UDC’s central OLED claim.


A reading of Mr. Uerkwitz’s report shows a lack of basic knowledge


necessary to understand the seriousness of UDC’s circumstances in


a final proceeding that presents a material “sudden death” risk for


UDC shareholders, which UDC has not addressed.


Our report provided and discussed the Lowe Hauptman


investigation and legal opinion, both of which were formally filed at


the EPO’s Boards of Appeal.  No other analyst or publication had


previously discussed the Lowe Hauptman filing or the “sudden

death” risk of the proceedings.  The Oppenheimer analyst chose to


dismiss all of this material in a half-page of bullet points.


We address certain of Oppenheimer’s points below, each in turn,


with reference to actual supporting documents, to show why the


quoted statements are misleading:


 


“what we read in the article is no different from what we’ve


read in the company’s 10-Q”


It’s difficult to understand how Mr. Uerkwitz justifies this


statement.  We see no such disclosure in UDC’s documents or


speech.  Oppenheimer not only fails to address the scientific and


legal findings in the Lowe Hauptman filing, but this statement also


covers up the distortions evident in UDC’s description of the EP-238


opposition proceedings.


UDC does not disclose that it lost a significant portion of EP-238


claims in the first round of opposition proceedings before the EPO’s


Opposition Division.  Oppenheimer does not even appear to


understand that UDC has already lost some of its EP-238 claims. 


This is discussed in more detail below.


UDC’s SEC filings also do not disclose the date of the EPO Board of


Appeal hearing, the specific claims that are at issue, the significance


of those claims, or the finality of the Board’s decision.


 


 


“The one piece of evidence we believe is strongest is the EPO’s


announcement regarding maintaining of the patents in an


earlier decision in January.”


This appears to refer the decision of the EPO’s Opposition Division,


issued in January 2012, in the EP-238 case, but it shows a


fundamental misunderstanding of the contents of that decision. 


The January 2012 decision does not “maintain[…] the patents” – it
invalidates a significant portion of EP-238’s claims as granted.  The


Lowe Hauptman states that 16 of the 30 original claims in EP-238


were invalidated by the Opposition Division (see pages 47 and 53). 


Lowe Hauptman filing appendices B – G discuss the Opposition


Division proceeding, the reasons for the January 2012 decision,


including invalidation, and issues that the Opposition Division


failed to consider.


In its SEC filings, UDC does not disclose the invalidation of certain


EP-238 claims in the January 2012 decision.  Instead, UDC states


only, “the EPO panel announced its decision to maintain the patent

with claims directed to OLEDs comprising phosphorescent


organometallic iridium compounds.”  See UDC 10-Q for the quarter


ended June 30th.  Not only does this neglect to mention the claims


that were actually invalidated, it fails to state that the EPO


invalidated any claims at all.


We have prepared this response because we believe that the bull


case for UDC rests upon certain misunderstandings or distortions


that are allowed or perpetuated by UDC management and UDC’s


disclosure practices.  Indeed, we believe that the problems with


UDC’s disclosures are far larger than the misleading description of


EP-238 proceedings discussed above.
