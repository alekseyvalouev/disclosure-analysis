Sphere 3D: A Ticking Time Bomb Set To Self-Destruct?
Jul. 24, 2014 12:31 PM ET40 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Sphere 3D has achieved phenomenal gains with the relentless support of a
conflicted portfolio manager suspected of stock manipulation in the past.


Even with that former regulatory target blowing millions on stocks that his firm owns,
Sphere 3D ranks as a rare winner in that ugly portfolio.


With Sphere 3D set to close an overhyped merger deal, much of its stock will soon
land in the hands of a less supportive firm with clear incentive to sell.


Sphere 3D (Nasdaq: ANY; TSXV: ANY.V) can thank a former regulatory target with a
lousy trading record for much of the buying pressure that has allowed its highflying stock
to resist the forces of gravity.


With Sphere 3D ranking as a standout performer in the portfolio that determines the size
of his annual bonus, Pinetree Capital CEO Sheldon Inwentash has repeatedly stepped
forward to bolster the value of that risky investment by purchasing much of the stock that
others have chosen to sell. Just go back a few weeks ago for a particularly striking
example. When TheStreetSweeper published the latest in a string of reports on Sphere
3D earlier this month, Inwentash responded by purchasing so much stock that he literally
wound up buying more than half of all the shares that changed hands on the open market
that day. (The next section of this report presents a full account of those trades in graphic
detail.)


A former penny stock that barely topped the 50-cent mark as recently as last summer,
Sphere 3D rocketed all the way to a record-breaking high above $11 a share with the help
of that powerful buying spree.


Sphere 3D better hope that it fares a whole lot better than most of the other stocks that
Inwentash has purchased after Pinetree blew millions on their ill-fated shares, however.
Just look at the performance of the investments that cost Pinetree the most. Even with
Inwentash splurging on all of those stocks himself - often at prices well above those
fetched on the open market today - most of them still trade in the low end of their 52-week
range.

Dangerous Firepower?


With its share price recently exploding into the double digits, and its stock currently trading
near the top of its 52-week range - an incredibly wide span that stretches all the way from
52 cents to $11.20 a share - Sphere 3D easily stands out as a rare winner in the crowd of
losing penny stocks that Pinetree has stuffed into its portfolio. Unable to maintain its
breathless momentum, however, Sphere 3D has finally started to display some early signs
of vulnerability itself. Down almost 20% from the lofty high that it set just a few weeks ago,
Sphere has fallen back into the single digits and now trades below the prices that
Inwentash paid when executing all six of his last open-market trades.

Pinetree itself sure has racked up steady gains throughout that frenetic buying spree,
though. Since Pinetree paid barely $5 a share for its original stake in Sphere 3D - already
trading 50% higher on the day that it first announced that multimillion-dollar position - the
firm has managed to practically double the value of that lucrative investment (on paper, at
least), with its CEO relentlessly buying the stock and supporting its share price along the
way.


Look how much of the stock Inwentash bought from others willing to sell, though.

* Dates when TheStreetSweeper published articles about the company


Thanks to that buying spree, Sphere 3D has bolstered the confidence of retail investors
who feel reassured to see the CEO purchase so much of that highflying stock - without
fully appreciating his likely influence on the rising share price - and even inspired them
enough to follow his potentially dangerous lead. Despite all of the losing bets that Pinetree
and its leader have placed on the stocks in its portfolio, the firm still manages to win plenty
of respect from admirers who seemingly never bothered to do their homework.


Take The Midas Letter, a promotional "research" publication that caters to retail investors
with favorable coverage of microcap companies. While The Midas Letter included Sphere
3D in a bullish report designed to highlight the 10 most promising Canadian technology
stocks, it actually seemed rather unimpressed with the bleeding rollup company until it
noticed that Pinetree had gambled a fortune on its highflying shares.


"Frankly, I can't understand why the valuation and its technology is esoteric, to say the
least, with a value proposition that strikes me as modest at best," The Midas Letter
conceded. "That being said, I will be conducting a CEO pod-cast with the company's
president, Peter Tassiopolous, later this week. And I'll see if I can begin to wrap my head
around what's got Pinetree Capital sufficiently intrigued to buy 12% of the company if it
exercises all options and warrants.


"To see Pinetree buying stock in the market at this high valuation is a very bullish signal in
my mind," it then concluded, "as the fund is not known for making foolish wagers."


Talk about a generous compliment. Displaying either ignorance or - even worse -- a
reckless disregard for the truth, as evidenced by the figures that Pinetree has published
on its own website (and TheStreetSweeper has further dissected below), The Midas Letter
sure offered some rather high praise for an investment firm with such a horrible track
record.

In contrast, The Midas Letter literally ridiculed TheStreetSweeper after it published an
investigative report on another overhyped Canadian stock that managed to stage a decent
comeback (thanks to some rather curious buying pressure of its own) but has long since
lost that useless war. An overhyped graphite miner that peaked at $5 a share last
summer, back when Sphere 3D itself still traded as a lowly penny stock, Zenyatta (TSXV:
ZEN.V) sells for less than half of that price right now.


The same critic recently blasted TheStreetSweeper after reading its latest report on
Sphere 3D, too.


Total Meltdown


While Zenyatta has obviously endured a brutal correction, many of the companies that
Pinetree owns have actually fared a whole lot worse. Of the 20 stocks that Pinetree
identifies as its largest investments right now, in fact, only Sphere 3D and two other
companies (one of them a volatile microcap name and the other a technology firm that
seems worthy of intense scrutiny, too) have managed to avoid significant losses -- most of
them downright horrific -- since landing in the firm's portfolio


Look how much those big-ticket investments have plummeted in value to date.

No wonder an astute portfolio manager has labeled Pinetree "possibly the worst closed-
end fund - ever." In a scathing review published just a few months before Pinetree
announced that it had established sizable positions in both Sphere 3D and Poet
Technologies (TSXV: PTK.V) (the latter since exploding into its biggest winner of all
despite its total absence of revenue) that Canadian fund manager declared the firm an
outright "train wreck" after scrutinizing its horrible track record.


"The company functionally operates as a closed-end fund that invests in extremely risky
microcap ventures in the mining sector," he explained last November. "I've analyzed this
one many, many years ago and dismissed the idea for obvious reasons. Nothing much
has changed since then, other than that management has blown about half-a-billion
dollars. This is an accomplishment that very few non-fraud artists can claim …


"Management is entrenched in the company, and they make a pretty profit from simply
being there … Suffice it to say, pulling a cool million a year out of this train wreck is rivaling
what Robert Mugabe has done to Zimbabwe over the past few decades. (NYSE:SO)
management has a clear incentive to seeing that this train wreck continues as long as
possible.


"It is a million-dollar-per-year vehicle to extract capital out of unwitting investors. (But) it is
clear that nobody rational would ever want to own the common shares of the business."


Simmering Threat?


Investors might see no reason to place risky bets on Sphere 3D, either. To be sure, Cyrus
Capital hardly seems inclined to follow in the footsteps of Pinetree when it soon emerges
as the largest shareholder of the overvalued technology company.


If anything, in fact, Cyrus looks far more inclined to simply dump that expensive stock and
bank the hefty proceeds instead.


A fund manager that specializes in debt financing for distressed companies, Cyrus has
already wound up stuck with equity in two bleeding technology firms that needed help and
fell under its control. After facilitating (if not orchestrating) an overhyped merger between
Sphere 3D and the second of those struggling firms, Cyrus now stands to receive a hefty

18.2% stake in the resulting company - generously valued at a combined $265 million by
the market right now - as soon as that pending transaction officially closes sometime
before the current quarter draws to an end.


Still paying for an old mistake that effectively forced the firm to accept stock in a company
unable to pay its debts off in cash, Cyrus has spent the better part of a decade basically
recycling equity that it never really wanted in the first place. So don't feel surprised if Cyrus
jumps at the chance to sell its lucrative stake in Sphere 3D - worth a tantalizing $50 million
at current market prices - when presented with such an attractive exit strategy.


After all, Cyrus has waited an awful long time for that sort of opportunity.


Start with the original transaction that left Cyrus in control of a broke technology company.
Way back in the summer of 2006, Cyrus provided the funds that allowed Tandberg to
purchase fading Exabyte - a former highflier well past its prime - in a deal that the media
would later declare a "colossal mistake." Already vulnerable enough on its own, Tandberg
sank beneath the weight of that extra burden for several years before finally spiraling into
bankruptcy when it ran out of money to cover its onerous debt load.


Inheriting the mess that it helped facilitate, Cyrus spent the next three years fruitlessly
waiting for Tandgerg to recover and survive on its own. Clearly out of patience by early
last year, Cyrus finally gave up and arranged for Tandberg to merge with Overland
Storage (Nasdaq: OVRL) - yet another bleeding technology player unable to properly
support itself - in an all-stock transaction that left the firm with a controlling interest in the
latter company instead.


Even without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, some experts regarded that merger as a
dangerous plan.


"The two firms are not in good shape at all," one industry publication emphasized ahead of
that deal. "Will the combination of these two old U.S. and German storage companies
reverse the trend? We doubt (NYSE:IT)."


Cyrus never bothered to wait around for an answer. Less than six months into that
challenging marriage, Cyrus fell in love with a more attractive prospect instead. Rushing to
capitalize on the cozy relationship that Overland had established with Sphere 3D - a
recent penny stock rapidly soaring toward double-digit territory - Cyrus threw its powerful
support behind an overhyped merger that would allow the firm to swap its majority interest
in Overland for a smaller, but incredibly lucrative, stake in Sphere 3d worth a whole lot
more.

Talk about a clever move. Stuck with equity in cash-strapped technology companies ever
since Tandberg defaulted on that $23 million loan five years earlier, Cyrus had just struck
a deal that would provide the firm with a valuable stake in Sphere 3D that's now worth
more than double that amount. Once that pending transaction officially closes, Cyrus
might feel understandably tempted to start unloading that huge pile of stock, since the firm
stands to book a tidy profit even if it hammers the shares in the process.


Pinetree better watch out. No matter how much stock that its CEO rushes out to buy on
the open market, Pinetree cannot possibly offset the intense selling pressure that Sphere
3D would endure if Cyrus started liquidating a massive stake in the company that's
virtually twice as large as its own.


Regulatory Heat


Once a celebrated highflier itself, Pinetree actually caught the attention of authorities at
the Ontario Securities Commission - who suspected both the firm and its CEO of
manipulating stocks that it held in its portfolio during the "glory days" that preceded its
collapse. Displaying the same kind of resilience that Sphere 3D would later enjoy,
Pinetree survived jarring news of that investigation without any damage after a conflicted
stock picker staged a dramatic rescue of its own pricey shares.


An influential promoter who trumpeted Pinetree as one of his favorite names at the time -
and reportedly stood to profit from its winning streak - James Dines responded to news of
that regulatory probe by urging his followers to "back up the truck" and buy even more
stock in the embattled firm. Thanks to that helpful intervention, Pinetree swiftly recovered
from an early 30% plunge and actually ended the day with a healthy boost to its
phenomenal gains.


Still, even some Pinetree shareholders who normally listened to Pines felt uneasy enough
to act on their queasy gut feelings in this case instead.


"I'm bailing out till the dust settles from the investigation," one shareholder decided a few
weeks later. "I firmly believe that, where there is smoke, there is fire. I love the Dines
newsletter, but you have to remember he is heavily invested (I'm sure) in both companies.
I'm going to take my profits and look elsewhere."


Instead of succumbing to the pressure that normally follows a regulatory bombshell,
however, Pinetree actually stormed even higher in the months that followed - with Dines
dutifully singing its praises along the way - before reality ever began to take its inevitable
toll. While the stock would soon plunge into the low single digits and keep right on sinking

to its current home below 50 cents a share, Pinetree managed to rocket all the way to a
record-breaking high above $16 a share by the time that the company finally ran out of
luck.


With Pinetree achieving such lofty highs even after the Ontario Securities Commission
started investigating the firm and its CEO for suspicious trading, the media started hunting
for potential motives behind the ringing endorsements that helped fuel those inexplicable
gains. That exercise proved quite revealing, as illustrated by the striking conflicts exposed
below.


"There's nothing better than having someone influential recommending your stock to retail
investors," The Globe and Mail determined after completing its fruitful research. "Take
James Dines, the man behind The Dines Letter - a stock-picking report with a sizable
following …


"These days, (Dines) is touting a company called Mega Uranium Ltd., as well as Pinetree
Capital Ltd., which holds a big stake in Mega and shares the same chairman and CEO …
Why does Mr. Dines like Mega Uranium and Pinetree so much? He didn't respond to
requests for an interview, but he received 150,000 shares of a company called Maple
Minerals Corp. in July 2005 for selling the rights to the name 'Mega Uranium Ltd.' Maple
Minerals of course soon morphed into Mega Uranium, and the share price has climbed
from around $1 since Mr. Dines received his stock to over $6" following his bullish touts.


In other words, by pumping that expensive stock to his dedicated fans, Dines helped push
the value of his own stake in Mega Uranium - effectively received free of charge - all the
way toward the $1 million mark. Who knows how much Dines scored on Pinetree itself?
With that stock racking up even more phenomenal gains, Dines stood to make a serious
fortune on any shares that he owned in Pinetree before convincing his avid fans to "back
up the truck" and buy some more.


Too bad those stocks soon collapsed. Pinetree shifted into freefall mode the following
year, with Mega Uranium promptly taking a similar plunge of its own.


Years later, Pinetree still lists Mega Uranium as the most expensive investment in its entire
portfolio. After placing a $15 million bet on that risky stock and losing almost 80% of that,
Pinetree needs Mega Uranium to explode out of penny-stock territory -- where it has by
now remained stuck for years -- and stage a miraculous rally just to get its money back.

Maybe Pinetree should have paid less attention to the intoxicating hype that helped drive
Mega Uranium (and its own stock) to nosebleed levels -- where Sphere 3D hovers today --
and focused a little more on the sober voice of reason back when it had a chance.


"Make the money -- and take the money," a cautious broker advised near the height of the
overblown commodities bubble that helped send Pinetree and Mega Uranium on such a
powerful tear. "We are in the best boom since the 1970s. Don't waste it."

Sooo, the argument is that since Pinetree has had a few losing stocks, this one must be a loser as well? Good luck
with that..

The technology speaks for itself...the author obviously has not seen it function, nor reviewed it in depth to understand
how disruptive it already is. Therefore the author cannot address the actual technology and it ubiquitous benefits to

Hopefully the self-interest of the Short in creating doubt, and sucking in others to sell ANY short will not devastate too
many uninformed.

All peripheral stuff about price manipulation. Does the Glassware technology from Sphere 3D work or not? Don't
know? Don't care? Can't figure it out? The success of that technology will decide who is the winner here. You have

It seems the long thesis can be summed up as "Glassware technically functions".


That may be true at a $10M valuation as well.


24 Jul 2014, 03:59 PM


strut1702
What is the value of a technology that can potentially extend the lifespan of operating systems indefinitely?


Keubiko says 10M (or 0)? He will not debate whether the product functions as advertised or not. We shall see
over the coming months if Keubiko is correct. Perhaps the thousands of investors, including a handful who
have witnessed Glassware are incorrect? Keubiko and co., who have not seen Glassware, could be correct?
Anybody want to wager the Vegas odds?


I would argue glassware is worth well over 10M with school districts on a national level alone. That doesn't
include government, healthcare, banking, retail, etc. You have to wonder why Sphere has not released a PR
regarding the school district.. I'm quite confident that it makes one party extremely nervous. Those that are
following know what I'm referring to.

Well, perhaps, if you argue a few disjointed comments on the back end of a curious SA article constitute

Jacob and Cormark just got paid $600,000 for raising ANY $10 million in the $8.50 range. What do you
expect them to write?


Note $5M of that money was instantly forked over to Overland so they wouldn't bounce payroll.


25 Jul 2014, 12:06 AM


Shareholders Unite, Contributor
And what do we expect you to write..


You might have noticed from the CC that Overland expects $20M in cost savings from the Tandberg
acquisition by the end of the year. They will achieve break-even or better if that happens.


V3 Systems has sales, Sphere a little, but with integrated access to so many channels, this sets them up for
quite a bit more.


Yes, on current financials it isn't a buy, but if you argue like that, you should short every development stage
company.


The question simply is whether Overland can break-even on the Tandberg acquisition and Sphere and V3 can
sell more with the channel access of the company, present financials are not terribly telling on that and are
only used to scare people.


25 Jul 2014, 10:05 AM


Keubiko, Contributor
My personal view is the public markets are no place for venture capital investing. If ANY were to raise money
right now from credible VCs privately they would be lucky to get a $20 million pre-money value. a quarter of a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2338295-sphere-3d-a-ticking-time-bomb-set-to-self-destruct 16/22


Most two-way mergers are considered failures. This is a effectively a merger of four basket cases:


Sphere 3D 
V3 
Overland 
Tandberg


The F-4 is a hoot to read. E.g. in fall 2012 Tassiopoulous asked Overland to acquire Sphere 3D. I see in Nov
2012 Overland's market cap was about $35 million so why was Tassiopoulous so eager to sell for a small
amount when "Glassware 2.0" was about to become a "Citrix killer" ?


And what is this madness from two months before the V3 deal was even announced:


>>In December 2013, Sphere 3D began fulfilling orders for V3 products pursuant to an informal master
distributor arrangement between Sphere 3D and V3, as a result of V3’s inability to fulfil orders directly due to
lack of funding. <<


What the heck is that? A quarter-$billion public company entering "informal" arrangements? What is this
"fulfilling orders" business?


Sphere 3D's audited financials show revenue of zero. Not even $1, for 2013, but it was "fulfiling orders" on an
"informal" basis for another company? Now that we have audited financials we know that in December alone
the company shelled out over $200K to V3:


"At December 31, 2013, the amounts provided on an interim basis prior to closing amounted to $203,641."


But they didn't sign a definitive deal until Feb 2014!


IMHO the pump is ending, Iwentash has lost control of the stock, shorts smell blood, borrow is loosening up,
and it is going down hard.


I could be wrong though.


25 Jul 2014, 10:48 AM


Shareholders Unite, Contributor
They done one or two fundings since. The stock market used to be for funding. As in any development stage
company, one could look backwards and invariably the financials give little comfort. But stock markets have a
habit of looking forwards, and there are two relevant questions here: 
- Can Overland achieve the $20M cost savings from the Tandberg acquisition by the end of the year? 
- Can Sphere and V3 Systems leverage the sales channels, relationships, and support organization in order
to leverage sales?


If Overland comes close to that $20M cost saving they targeted in their latest CC, they might very well be in
the black, which would make the financials a great deal less scary.


By arguing Glassware isn't a real product, many shorts lost cred. This train has definitely passed. There was
never a question about V3 Systems product viability in the first place. The question now becomes, can they
use the Overland/Tandberg organization/relations... to generate more sales.

I think that's pretty likely. If you don't think so, short ahead, but don't keep looking backwards to parade a few
seemingly scary items, they've done funding and they have a window of opportunity to achieve the $20M cost
cutting and leverage sales from Sphere and V3. Whatever price that deserves is anybody's guess, but the
more they achieve these goals, the higher that's going to be.

validate anything you say. And if Sphere's product was so revolutionary there are plenty of smart companies and
players out there who would be buying it. You need to stop your wishful thinking and follow the money. Money talks.
And right now the lack of money/revenue says that Sphere has nothing of major interest to anyone that matters. How
stupid do you think consumers/companies are? It doesn't take them years to recognize a good product. They have all

The stock is down 25% in a month, I'd say someone is selling, and if shorts wanted to cover they would do so.
When the Overland deal goes through you can bet a lot of selling from them as well (assuming it does go
through - ANY can't afford a $5M per quarter cash burn so if they were smart they would back out of the
horrible, conflicted deal). IMHO of course.

Stock is down after running over roughly 1,500% since inception. This really isn't about Sphere. Look at the
article above, it's about an insider, not Sphere. The script is running dry. This is about the HF who is trapped
and underwater and looking for any talking point to bail themselves out. Truth is that the HF wants to get out
of this stock before Glassware reports revenues. Their worst fear is hanging onto borrowed shares as Sphere
reports revenues quarter after quarter. That is why you continue to talk about a rigid valuation based on
earnings alone. You can make the same argument for any startup tech including Facebook.


By the way, saw SS try these same tactics on Mimedx and I see the HF(s)covered and left. That's the game.
Seen this over and over again. The end result is that the HF wants out.

This morning's news is a tentative sign that Overland is stabilizing, possibly even turning around. This is the

enchillada is terribly overvalued.


They're also on track to achieve the $20M synergy benefits from Tandberg acquisition which could eliminate
most of their losses at a stroke, just a few Glassware sales from the mentioned customer trials might do the
rest.

Who are "you guys"? Anyone that's ever been short a stock of any company? I guess "you guys" said Enron

Also QCOR has gobs of revenue and cash flow. The thesis put forward was mainly that the company was
defrauding the system and that cash flow was vulernerable, especially with regulatory scrutiny. ANY has
almost nil revenue (absolutely nil before buying V3 which was seemingly on the verge of collapse), has a few
$million in the bank and is buying a company that is obviously not a strategic fit (to any sane observer)
burning $5M per quarter and is only meeting payroll because Sphere 3D is advancing funds before the
merger.

This message from a poster on IHub says it all:


"What many fail to see. The stock is still in retail investor's hands and they tend to invest based on emotion, not logic.  
The 1.74 million shares that are short know that.


Endless hit pieces going after everything and everyone BUT Spiffy's technology...why is that? They know their days
are numbered, they're desperate and to scare retail investors, they flash 49k share offers.


What is the record for hit pieces on Seeking Alpha for one stock any way?


If you're trading this for a buck or two, have a ball. The shorts are giving you that opportunity.


Any investor that has done REAL due diligence knows who Spiffy is working with. The talent that is coming on board
is starting to make headlines in the cloud space...why is that?


The last thing shorts want to see is the institutions come in, 1.74M shares will be impossible to buy. That time is
coming and they (shorts) know that.


Has one tech expert had anything but glowing reviews of Sphere 3D's technology?


There is an interesting battle going on here. Companies need Spiffy's cloud solutions to remain competitive in their
space AND tech (NYSE:IT) companies need Spiffy's solutions to remain a contender as well.


If you're looking at this as an investment, not a trade, the game just started. I can think of 1.74 million reasons why I

Those are in addition to the previously mentioned Chesterfield County School district deal for Chromebooks
which hasn't even been announced by Sphere. It is quite likely that there could be many other unmentioned
deals as the company seems to have gone into a quiet period until the Overland merger is complete. And of
course Overland by itself will most likely be bringing in $80M or more in revenues for 2014.

I saw the corporate update this AM. For starters a bit odd to be putting this out now if full results would have to be out
my mid August at the latest, perhaps done to get some news out to help support the stock 
This update has raised more questions for me. 
1) They indicate cash and ST investments is roughly 9$m...at end of q1 it was around 7.4...so cash went up only 1.6
million despite doing a 10$m equity offering, assume 6$m went to Overland as loan, where did the rest go? Did
Overland receive a larger loan ? Was there a bigger operating loss in the quarter ?


2) they mention total assets exceeded $35 m at end of quarter . At end of March total assets were $27.2m, so if I
were to add the $10 m equity issue, total assets should be approx $37.2m....what happened to the $2.2m , was there
an operating loss or a write off, it's not clear to me 
3) on the $1.7m revenue number , I would like to know how much of that is due to v3 being counted in the quarter vs
legacy Sphere revenues . The V3 deal closed March 21st, so this quarter will reflect a full quarter of V3 revenues.


Something does not add up to me here....

"Something does not add up to me here...."


What does not "add up" is your expecting a brief update to be the same as a 10Q. The answers to the kind of
questions you are asking are found in financial statements not brief updates.


Anyway, while the numbers are important and they are good, the real importance for investors in this update is this:


"Continued Innovation


Sphere 3D continues on its quest to redefine the boundaries of hardware through its "software defined everything"
approach to computing. DLA Piper, on behalf of the Company, filed a provisional patent for the first microvisor runtime
environment available on a chip. The latest IP creation is a culmination of years of miniaturization work with the intent
of making Glassware 2.0 completely portable and available offline.


Glassware 2.0 has seen its architecture streamlined and gain efficiency continuously since the first iteration that
required 8 individual hardware servers in 2010, to its current production state of availability on a single appliance.


The most recent progress of the Glassware 2.0 single chip architecture allowed Sphere 3D to showcase Glassware
2.0 server technology running on a single laptop for attendees at BriForum."
