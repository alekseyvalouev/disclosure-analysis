Sell Your Ampio Pharmaceuticals Shares Now: AMPE Is Setting Up
For A Secondary
Jan. 27, 2015 1:52 PM ET36 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


We believe AMPE is trying to raise money through a secondary.


Management previously ran an alleged stock promotion.


AMPE's development assets are worthless.


We had a number of conference calls with the company, and they’ve failed to
address any of these issues in a substantive manner.


We believe Ampio Pharmaceuticals (NYSEMKT:AMPE) is a stock promotion that is run by
management with an alleged history of fraud and is aggressively promoting itself in
preparation for a secondary. AMPE is quickly running out of cash and needs to raise tens
of millions of dollars. In order to boost its share price ahead of a secondary, we believe
AMPE management is aggressively promoting the company and trying to shield investors
from the reality that its pipeline assets are worthless. We have a price target of $0 and
recommend that investors short the stock.


CEO Michael Macaluso and CRO Vaughan Clift Have an Alleged History of Fraud


Two of the four executives at Ampio have direct ties to Isolagen, an aesthetic procedure
company that was accused by shareholders of malfeasance and ultimately went bankrupt.
As we documented here in a previous Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) article that we
published on SeekingAlpha (link), shareholders of Isolagen filed a class action lawsuit filed
against Michael Macaluso, Vaughan Clift and other Isolagen executives alleging that the
executives misrepresented the efficacy of Isolagen's product and probability of success.
Michael Macaluso was one of the Isolagen's largest shareholders and a main perpetrator
of the alleged fraud. In a particularly egregious act, Macaluso and other Isolagen
executives cashed out of millions of dollars' worth of stock through secondary issuances
and privately negotiated transactions.


The full lawsuit and settlement can be found here and here.


These same executives are now running AMPE, and we believe they are trying to raise
more money imminently from naïve investors.

Ampio Pharmaceuticals Needs to Raise Cash


Why do we believe AMPE is trying to raise money through a secondary? AMPE has less
than 12 months of cash remaining to fund operations and will run out of money by early
2016. Biotech companies traditionally want to have at least 12 months of cash reserves,
and we believe AMPE is now trying to set itself up for another secondary.


At the end of the September 2014 quarter, AMPE had $56.8 million in cash (link). Through
the third quarter of 2014, AMPE had burned $32.9 million in cash through negative Cash
Flow Used in Operating Activities and Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities. In other
words, AMPE has an annual cash burn rate of approximately $44 million. We believe
AMPE is likely to end the year at under $50 million of cash, which means they will have
enough cash for roughly one year.


This is important because this is usually the point at which biotech companies do an
aggressive secondary and sell additional shares. For example, AMPE was in a similar
situation at the end of 2013 when it had only $26.3 million of cash after burning through
$20.8 million in 2013. AMPE promptly sold 9.775 million shares and raised $63.3 million
(link). We think another raise is imminent given the similar timing and relative cash levels.

Ampio Pharmaceuticals' Pipeline Is Worthless


In order to boost AMPE's share price, management has recently been promoting two
assets in its pipeline, the STRIDE Phase 3 trial for Ampion in osteoarthritis of the knee
and Zertane. We believe the STRIDE Phase 3 trial is likely to fail and that Zertane is a
worthless compound.


STRIDE Likely To Have A Giant Misstep


Management is touting its Phase 3 STRIDE trial for Ampion in osteoarthritis of the knee.
We remind investors that Ampion just recently experienced a failure in a similar Phase 3
trial called STEP. The press release for the failed study can be found here.


Management blamed the Clinical Research Organization (CRO) for mishandling the drug
and placebo samples which affected the trial results. AMPE claimed samples of Ampion
that were exposed to temperatures below 15o C may lose potency.


However, in a press release (here) two weeks later, AMPE revealed that patients receiving
the temperature-affected samples of Ampion actually performed better than the non-
affected samples.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2854236-sell-your-ampio-pharmaceuticals-shares-now-ampe-is-setting-up-for-a-secondary 4/13


We believe this is a clear indication that Ampion failed to show any pain benefit of the
knee.


Furthermore, AMPE performed a post-hoc data-mining analysis and found that patients
with severe osteoarthritis (NYSE:OA), as defined by a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of IV,
performed better than grade III patients. This indicates that patients with a KL III grade
had no benefit. It's important to note that the phase 3 STRIDE trial has both grade III and
grade IV patients, as seen here.


If Ampion had no benefit in the grade III patient population and only tarnished drug
samples showed any benefit in the KL IV population, we think the likelihood of success in
the STRIDE trial is minimal.


Zertane Has Proven To Be Limp


Recently, AMPE was at the Biotech Showcase 2015 conference to promote its wholly-
owned subsidiary Vyrix (here), which it created in 2013 to develop Zertane, a repurposed
drug to treat male sexual dysfunction pertaining to premature ejaculation. In April 2014,
Vyrix filed a Form S-1 relating to a proposed initial public offering of Vyrix public stock
(here). We think Zertane is a worthless drug due to an already existing generic that is
readily and cheaply available in the market today.


Why do we believe Zertane is worthless? First, it's important to note that the previous
owner, BioVail, had terminated two European Phase 3 clinical trials for Zertane (previously
known as BVF-324) due to "slower-than-anticipated enrollment and a lack of commercial
interest in the product." In the 10-K filing (here), BioVail made clear that its decision to
terminate the Phase 3 clinical trial was made prior to its merger with Valeant and was
unrelated.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2854236-sell-your-ampio-pharmaceuticals-shares-now-ampe-is-setting-up-for-a-secondary 5/13


If BioVail did not believe in the viability of Zertane enough to abandon the drug midway
through its pivotal Phase 3 trials, why should investors believe in the compound?


Furthermore, since acquiring the drug in 2011, AMPE has signed only two partnerships
that have brought in a total of $500,000 from South Korean pharmaceutical company
Daewoong Pharmaceuticals (here) and $250,000 from Canadian specialty
pharmaceuticals company Paladin Labs Inc (See "Collaboration with Paladin" here).
These two upfront payments do not even total $1 million dollars. This is hardly indicative
of blockbuster or even meaningful revenue potential.


That is because the compound that Zertane is comprised of, tramadol, has already turned
generic and is cheaply available today. Tramadol in 50mg form can be purchased today
for $0.27 per pill, as we found here.


Zertane is simply tramadol in a 62mg or 89mg form. There is nothing secret to Zertane or
the dosage. In fact, multiple investigative trials using tramadol at 50mg have shown the
same purported effects of Zertane at 62mg and 89mg (here). We believe this is why

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2854236-sell-your-ampio-pharmaceuticals-shares-now-ampe-is-setting-up-for-a-secondary 6/13


BioVail abandoned Zertane and why AMPE has had difficulty signing any meaningful
partnerships in over three years. Tramadol is readily available today at the low cost of
almost a quarter per pill.


We believe this is the reason Vyrix has failed to generate any interest in an IPO offering.
In its September 2014 10-Q (here), AMPE noted that Vyrix has failed to generate any
interest and has shelved Vyrix's plans for an IPO.


It's also important to note that Zertane needs to conduct two Phase 3 trials in the US in
order to file for approval. These trials will cost around four million dollars (here). Vyrix was
capitalized with less than $300,000, which isn't nearly enough for further development of
Zertane. Since Vyrix cannot raise any money, AMPE will need to be the one to raise
funds. This is another reason we believe AMPE is desperately trying to raise cash.


Both compounds that the executives at AMPE have been recently promoting are
worthless in our view.


Price Target $0


We believe the case against AMPE is clear. Two executives have direct ties to an alleged
former stock promotion. AMPE is running short on cash. To raise funds, the Company is
promoting worthless assets in its pipeline that have a history of failure and non-
marketability. Our price target on AMPE is $0. We believe the pipeline assets are
worthless and that the executives will waste any and all cash on its balance sheet. We
recommend investors short AMPE.

You had the honesty to disclose your short position: kudos.


Other than that, this article just makes a point for whom is long: shorters are desperate.


Cashburn rate doesn't make a lot of sense, since most of the Ampion and Optina studies are already funded and
close to their completion.


And you didn't mention the next Catalysts at all...

arbtrdr
Marrock - OK. AMPE alrerady has a partner on Korea for Zertane. As to $4M to get Zertane approved in the USA -
seriously. Listen to AMPE and they already said they were looking for approval overseas where additional studies
were not needed.


As an aside, unless something has changed AMPE really does not care about Zertane. Ampio is where the $$ is. The
comment by the author that KL had a greater effect in grade 4 patients and therefore did not work in those with garde
3 condition is not logical. Simply stated it means the more severe patients had a greater benefit (at least partially
because they had more room for improvement by about actor of 2X) than those less severe.


A really scary artuicle that proves SA will print anything.

Author’s reply »  The point was that the current Phase 3 trial is poorly designed since it includes both grade 3
& 4 patients yet the post-hoc analysis showed that a benefit was only observed in grade 4 patients and that
the pooled patient group (i.e. both grade 3 & 4) did not see a stat significant benefit. This bodes poorly for the
company.

Author-


I am long AMPE...and I am just curious your line of thinking...and your thoughts on some things.


1) Do you have any comment on the Luoxis' RedoxSYS Diagnostic System that the company has just
established a distro network in Europe?


2) Do you think that that since the majority of trials have already been complete that the cash burn rate will be
slowing here in the near future?


27 Jan 2015, 11:34 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Do you realize that Luoxis is basically a joke. They sold 19% for about $4mm, which
suggests the other 81% they own is only worth $17mm. There have also been no sales and the so-called
research is a joke. It's basically worthless and I would be shocked if they sell more than $2 million this year.
Most likely close to $0.


R&D is unlikely to go down. They continue to run trials to supply hope to the muppets who own their stock.


28 Jan 2015, 04:22 PM


superforce_57
Alpha Exposure, everyone(except you) knows that Luoxis is meaningless to the AMPE story, as well as Vyrix.
Both are assigned no value by investors who have a clue.


It's all about Ampion. You conveniently forgot to mention the SPRING trial, which was successful.


You also forgot to mention that in an extended 20 week endpoint of that same trial which was comprised of
only K-4's AND K-3's, the WOMAC scores were close to 50% on a single injection. What do you think those
scores will be on 3 injections? Off the charts is where they'll likely be. 4's & 3's often times come in with
WOMAC scores that are identical.


STRUT results in March, STRIDE in May, and a $Billion+ valuation soon. Then the Short story will be over,
and there will be a perpetual bid underneath the stock.

It is interesting to note how “performed better” and significantly greater improvement” turn into “failed to show any pain
benefit” by Ampion’s short seller. The logic confounds the reader, but the article’s author is not relying on logic to
convince the reader, but on fear. Using phrases like “alleged fraud,” “alleged former stock promotion,” “running short
on cash,” and “worthless assets” are all designed to cause fear and uncertainty, but are given no actual support with
verifiable facts in the article. In fact, the author acknowledges that analysis of the tests shows improvement (see the
inset boxes), but then simply tells the reader not to believe.it. 
What we should believe at this point is that over the last year or more shorters have been systematically “walking the
stock down.” Any positive announcement by the company is met with up to 30 negative articles within minutes. How
does that happen? It happens because with up to 11,000,000 shares short, it seems obvious that those shorts have
only one way of winning. That way is to try put the company out of business by making funding impossible, i.e. by
destroying the company’s credibility. To cover 11,000,000 shares with a total of 57 million outstanding (40 million
float??) might get a little pricey.  
This company needs a fair chance to make its case without the yellow journalism. I will take this author’s comments
more seriously if the company announces new funding or if negative test results are announced. In the meantime, it
would be nice to have a fair market not dominated by the shorter’s “walk the stock down” trading algorithm!

I'm the vice president of marketing for Absorption Pharmaceuticals. We make Promescent, arguably (no such data
exists) the leading product on the market for premature ejaculation. Zertane has no chance. Men won't go their
doctors for a prescription of some drug with side effects when they can simply go on-line a purchase a new
technology topical medication like Promescent. Plus, even if Tramadol became somewhat popular, it is available
inexpensively on-line. Zertane couldn't generated the margins.


I can't comment on Ampio.

I CAN comment on Ampio. I've been in it before - long enough to see that your take on Zertane and the
accusations in this article are quite valid. 
A secondary can knock PPS for a loop with this one.

How is that fraudulent short call looking now? AMPE is only up 35% since your fantasy based, slanderous hit piece.
I'll say it again, shame on Seeking Alpha for allowing such garbage to be posted.


When AMPE reports results from their STRIDE trial in the next month or so, you'll eventually be looking at a $1.5
Billion market cap. I guess that's a far cry from your absurd & laughable $0 price target.

Looking back on this nearly 8-9 months later, I find this whole story fascinating. This definitely represents a cautionary
tale of trusting biotech management. The author brought out many valid claims, and the blinded longs only bashed
and bashed the article. Some commenters even claimed that Ampio would soon have a "$8 billion mcap". Yet the
author proved to be right. With another set of Phase 3 results coming up soon, it'll be interesting to see whether
shareholders will continue to believe in Ampios. Great call by the author. Cautionary tale of groupthink. I've fallen in
this type of trap before as well
