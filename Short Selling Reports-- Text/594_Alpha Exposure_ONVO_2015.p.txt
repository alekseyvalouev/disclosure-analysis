Apparent Connections To A Convicted Stock Promoter: Another
Chapter In The Organovo Saga
Apr. 1, 2015 12:46 PM ET164 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


We believe Organovo has ties to a convicted stock promoter named Howard Appel.


Howard Appel has allegedly been involved in numerous pump-and-dumps and
served prison time for securities fraud and money laundering in 2008.


Howard Appel is currently a person of interest in recent law enforcement actions.


We believe Howard Appel and his associates were top holders of ONVO before it
IPO’ed.


We believe ONVO is a compelling short.


Much has been written about Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO) and its shortcomings. Richard
Pearson showed that Organovo's 3D liver tissue is not unique, that competitors are more
advanced than ONVO, and that the market opportunity for liver assays is incredibly small
("A Very Detailed Look At Organovo"). Another has highlighted Organovo's gross
overvaluation compared to peers and shown that ONVO should be valued at $2.09 per
share or less ("My View on Organovo (Over-)Valuation"). Lastly, highly-respected short
seller Citron detailed how it believes Organovo was the subject of a stock promotion from
a Japanese boiler room that sent the shares up in late 2013 ("Citron Issues URGENT
Trading Warning to the Public").


We view this fundamental material as quite negative, and company results since these
articles were published have done little to change our opinion.


Even though shares are down from the highs of last July, the market value of the stock is
more than $350 million for a company that in its last quarter lost $7 million on just
$160,000 of revenue. How does one keep a stock like this kited for so long?


In the course of our due diligence, we have discovered connections between Organovo
and a convicted felon who has been associated with numerous financial frauds and stock
promotions, and has served prison time for felony crimes. We are sharing our findings
here today.

Introducing Howard Appel, Convicted Felon


Who is Howard Appel? Howard Appel is a well-known stock promoter with a long history
of defrauding investors.


For the past quarter century, Howard Appel has been associated with numerous stock
promotions, share price manipulation schemes, and acts of securities fraud, some of
which are documented here (start at page 10) and here (start at page 18). Howard Appel's
infractions date from at least 1989 when Appel's brokerage firm, Bailey, Martin, and Appel,
was fined $50,000 and suspended by the National Association of Securities Dealers
("NASD") for stock manipulation (NASD Disciplinary Actions December 1989, see section
titled "NASD sanctions Bailey, Martin and Appel, Inc., of Philadelphia and four individuals
for artificial pricing and excessive markups in Northgate Industries Penny Stock"). In 1991,
Howard Appel was "barred from association with any member of the NASD in any
capacity." This was due to Appel's participation in another fraudulent scheme to sell
securities to public customers at unfair prices (NASD Disciplinary Actions August 1991,
see page 5 in the PDF).


Over the next 15 years, Appel was alleged to have taken part in numerous small cap stock
promotions, including Florida West Airlines (WSJ article here) and Net Value Holdings
(aka Stonepath Group) (link here). Howard Appel has also been closely associated with
failed companies like Eastwind Group, Commodore Holdings, VDC, Osage Systems,
Aviation Holding Group, and NAL Financial Group. Howard Appel's connections to these
companies are documented in the Net Value Holdings lawsuit (Start at "Panzo's
Relationship with Appel" linked here). In each of the companies, Appel was involved in
insider dealings and all of the companies either went bankrupt or later experienced severe
financial distress.


As the years progressed, Howard Appel's actions eventually led to his serving time in
prison. In 2004, Howard Appel was charged by the United States in the Eastern District of
New York with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money
laundering in relation to a stock manipulation scheme (United States v. Howard M. Appel,
Case No. 1:04-cr-00505-JG). Howard Appel pled guilty to both counts and was sentenced
to 1 year and 1 day in prison and 3 years of supervision. Appel served prison time from
June 2008 through April 2009.


Amazingly, he remains active today. He is currently under investigation by the New York
District Attorney for another stock promotion ("Subpoena Sought In Penny Stock Probe").
Appel is also currently the subject of a lawsuit concerning the Latitude Solutions

bankruptcy where he is alleged to have perpetrated another pump-and-dump scheme
(Amended Latitude Solutions Fraud Complaint).


It should be noted that all of the companies that we have identified as being associated
with Howard Appel have either defaulted, gone bankrupt, or experienced severe financial
distress.


Organovo's apparent link to Convicted Stock Fraud Promoter Howard Appel


We have reason to believe that Howard Appel was one of the key participants who
brought Organovo public notwithstanding the fact that his name is not found in the
company's SEC filings.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 4/42


In ONVO's S-1 Registration Statement from July 5, 2012 (see section "Selling Security
Holders"), DIT Equity Holdings is listed as ONVO's 4th largest shareholder.


There are no footnotes provided in the ONVO S-1 that show who ultimately controls DIT
Equity Holdings, LLC or any of the other non-individual holders.


The lack of footnotes to identify control persons of non-individual owners is unusual so we
went digging. We found that DIT Equity Holdings, LLC was listed as a top 10 shareholder
in the January 2014 S-1 for Matinas BioPharma Holdings (see section "Selling
Stockholders") (OTCQB:MTNB). A similarly named investor named DIT Equity Investors,
LLC is also listed as a top shareholder in Matinas. We think they're connected.


What is interesting about the Matinas S-1 is that it was prepared by the same investment
banker as those who prepared the ONVO S-1. And yet Matinas' S-1 contains the
footnotes that are standard to such documents, while the ONVO S-1 does not.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 5/42


Guess who owns DIT Equity Investors, LLC. The footnote states, "Howard Appel is a
natural person with voting and dispositive power over the shares held by DIT Equity
Investors, LLC."


So Howard Appel clearly controls DIT Equity Investors, LLC.


But what about DIT Equity Holdings, which is the entity that held shares in ONVO?


The footnote for DIT Equity Holdings, LLC states, "Kyung Won Lee is a natural person
with voting and dispositive power over the shares held by DIT Equity Holdings, LLC."


We looked up Kyung Won Lee and found that he is closely tied with Howard Appel
through two companies: Rms Advisors and Fac Enterprises, both of which are
incorporated in the state of Nevada.


Rms Advisors:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 6/42


Fac Enterprises:


We also found a reference to a similarly named DIT Equity Holdings, Inc in the Latitude
Solutions lawsuit(1) against, among others, Appel, that states, "DIT Equity Holdings, Inc.
is closely affiliated with and effectively controlled, either through ownership or managerial
or operational control or otherwise, by Appel."


We think the connection between Organovo and Howard Appel is clear, and believe there
is strong evidence to demonstrate that Appel has been involved with ONVO from early on
before it IPO'ed through DIT Equity Holdings, LLC.


More Howard Appel Connections


Furthermore, at least one known associate of Howard Appel was also a top shareholder of
ONVO. According to the S-1, FEQ Realty, LLC was the 11th largest shareholder in ONVO.
Again, the control person of FEQ Realty is not noted in the ONVO S-1. We were able to
find the owner of FEQ Realty through other SEC filings. As seen in Exhibit 2.2 of the
February 14, 2012 8-K filing by Rio Bravo Oil (OTCQB:RIOB), Ernest Bartlett is President
and Managing Member for FEQ Realty, LLC.



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1502774/000114420412008930/v302250_ex2-2.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 7/42


Ernest Bartlett's connection to FEQ Realty is further supported in Exhibit 10.3 of the May
4, 2012 8-K filing by Virtual Piggy (OTCQB:VPIG).


Ernest Bartlett has his own past of legal troubles. He was fined and permanently barred by
the NASD in 1989 (NASD Disciplinary Action September 1989, see page 6 in the PDF).


He was also sanctioned along with Appel in the 2013 Cease and Desist order by the
Arkansas Securities Department for violating various provisions of Arkansas Securities Act
related to the Bamco debenture default. In the 2015 Latitude Solutions lawsuit, Bartlett
was noted as being a close associate of Howard Appel. Bartlett's relationship with Appel
goes back to 1997 when both were co-defendants in a securities suit filed in California,
Pacific Aid Venture, et al v. Max E Bobbitt, et al.


Also important to note, Howard's sister Vicki Appel was 7.5% owner in VPIG before its
IPO through Capital Growth Trust, as seen in this footnoted 2008 S-1 filing (see section
"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners, Management, and Directors"). We
believe this shows how Howard Appel and his associates work through many different
entities.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 8/42


We also note that VPIG, a company with its own sordid history, revealed in its 2014 10-K
filing (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings) last week that it had received a subpoena from the
SEC regarding unusual trading activity in VPIG's stock.


Together, FEQ Realty and DIT Equity Holdings held a combined 1.6 million shares of
ONVO, which would have made them the 3rd largest shareholder of ONVO pre-IPO. This
leads us to believe that Appel and Bartlett were involved together as major shareholders
in ONVO.


Lack of Shareholder Disclosure by ONVO


Lastly, we think it's interesting to note that Organovo did not disclose the names of the
beneficial owners of the entities listed as shareholders in its S-1. There wasn't a single
footnote explaining any of the holdings of ONVO's 189 pre-IPO shareholders. Identifying
the owners of pre-IPO shareholders, in addition to relationships between executive
officers and investors, is common practice.


We looked at a number of recent biotech IPOs; all of them disclosed the owners behind
the entities that held shares. We highlight two of them below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3045446-apparent-connections-to-a-convicted-stock-promoter-another-chapter-in-the-organovo-saga 10/42


We believe that these footnotes provide important information regarding potential conflicts
of interests, the nature of the shareholdings, and disclosure of the ultimate beneficiaries of
the shares.


We find it curious that Organovo did not disclose the ownership information. Perhaps it
was because it did not want to reveal an association with a convicted felon.


Conclusion: ONVO is a short


We are strong believers in the adage, "The fish rots from the head down." In Organovo's
case, we believe that we have found compelling evidence that it is closely associated with
Howard Appel as well as individuals associated with him who have also been indicted
and/or convicted for financial fraud. This just adds further evidence to us that Organovo is
a stock that should be avoided by buyers and shorted by sellers.

Comments (164)


In our opinion, investors may have reacted quite differently and been more skeptical of a
company associated with a convict known for stock promotions, share price manipulation
schemes, and acts of securities fraud had disclosures been made in ONVO's SEC filings.


Given the evidence that we have presented regarding ONVO's close association with
known stock promoters and convicted felons and given the evidence from others showing
that ONVO's products are not unique and are behind those of competitors, we value
ONVO solely based on its current cash value of $0.62 per share.

You have a lot of the Appel/Pelullo sga correct, but it's incomplete. At the same time as he was "cooperating"
with SDNY AUSA, his pipeline was going strong, as it has continuously for 20+ years. Just this week, in the

DeJoria, Garnick, Belzberg - but even that list is incomplete. In the interest of Investor Protection, I am

Also wanted to add a couple of red flags: 
Stephen P. Harrington has been working with Appel and Bartlett for 25 years. His current investment holding
companies used to be SST Investments and SPH Investments, but now I see an anonymously-owned
company called TSS Investments in the Latitude filings, and I would be dollars to doughnuts that is
Harrington's.

@FormerSEC..Thanks...I do not have that office but if it is making money wish I did! You can check my profile
on SA and see I have been around for awhile unlike you.  
You can also see I have been a believer and investor and trader in ONVO for years. 
You can also see I am an average guy who is trying to do more with my money since Obama wants to keep
taking more and more.  
You can see I am a patriot who served my country like many others of the 1% who only serve their country.  
I will concede on one thing and that is the stock market is getting more and more like throwing your money
down in Las Vegas. Hedge Funds and others with slanting and misleading articles can drive down the stock
of good companies. The Feds are also keeping this market up by pumping money into it and soon someone
has to wake up and face the facts. I feel sorry for many with 401s etc. as there are less and less retirement
programs. They will loose and keep loosing and have only Soc Sec to live on and its on life support.  
In conclusion I do not put much into article are comments by people who show up and try to drive Stocks
down. I know they are Gambling with Shorts as we are with Investments but the latter uses trickery to win as
we just try to use facts. 
LONG ONVO and we will see in June or so how they really are doing. In the mean time there is also a chance
that they come up with a new major breakthrough in Medical use.

What a pile of garbage. The author claims that an entity whose principal is allegedly a stock promoter owned
some shares of the shell into which ONVO merged three years ago. Wow. That is some smoking gun. The
author doesn't even attempt to allege or argue how that is relevant to ONVO today, or ever. And the company
has formally replied that it has never even heard of the individual referenced in the article. Great work. I hope
the author was paid well for his manipulative hit piece.

Iggy: Amazing to see any legitimate financial investment site publish these "half-truths" ... if it is possible to
even use the word truth, when the "manipulative" objective is so patently obvious as in this ONVO article.


I realize that SA enjoys the page hits this type of article generates, but a business model dependent on
ignoring blatant distortions in articles published with their editorial oversight is alarming. I once brought
another even more egregious falsehood to SA editorial attention with proof of the matter. The resolution was
for SA to agree for the author to add a "?" after their "bombastic" headline. Worse, SA did not take down the
original headline from other web sites they distribute to...so the fraudulent headline still appears on the
Nasdaq news listings. SA needs to level the playing field and not cater to the worst of the new "activist short"
hit pieces.

It is pretty ridiculous, Tincup. The whole purpose of this pointless article was to have a very scary headline
that is completely unsupported by any actual substance. I'd hate to meet the investor dumb enough to read
this piece and not immediately see that it is a blatant smear attempt based on irrelevant innuendo. By the
way, I know people that have submitted positive articles on ONVO to SA. You know what the response was?
Too positive. They weren't balanced out with any risk issues. Can you believe that? Can you find a single
word of positive balance to this most recent hit piece? It is almost humorous. It is quite apparent that the SA
staff is in bed with the 2 or 3 hedgies that have have been churning and attacking this stock for the last year,
who are most likely the secret interests that are publishing this garbage through various patsies and lowlifes.

Dear author: you make the following statement: 
"Lack of Shareholder Disclosure by ONVO" ... what on a 1989 third party etc? Shocking that he isn't rotting in Sing
Sing after such a deplorable crime!


More importantly, I find it inconsistent that such a statement be made by someone who is an author of a SA article
who does not declare what, if any, position you maintain in the subject stock. Isn't this a violation of SA protocols?


Just as Keubiko mentioned...there is never just one cockroach....I agree!

tinhat,


>> I find it inconsistent that such a statement be made by someone who is an author of a SA article who does

You can find a hint right under the title where it reads "Disclosure: The author is short ONVO."


P.S. I also think the author is smart.


01 Apr 2015, 01:40 PM

So do you SA authors work together to manipulate share prices or does everyone do the work on their own?

"...highly-respected short seller Citron..."


Is this the same 'highly respected' Andrew Left who was found by the National Futures Association to have 'made
false and misleading statements to cheat, defraud or deceive a customer', and subsequently disbarred for three
years?


That same Citron?


Just how much pain are you in from the ONVO gain today?

reveal if you have or have had any participation with ONVO. I have none, nor any relation whatsoever, with ONVO.

xmillionairex
After spending nearly 30 minutes reading, thinking, deducing and concluding....I'm left with this question:


Why are the writers of this article saying to short a stock under $5 now?


Something smells here and I think I know what it is: Go to NASDAQ.com and check the "last 100 trades". Most are a
few hundred, a couple of thousand which clearly indicates that these are small owners of the stock being scared out.


Interesting that this article is coming out at the same time that ONVO is announcing progress on their latest bit of
research.


Hmmmm again.


I don't expect everyone to agree with my assessment but I think this article doesn't smell good. It smells pretty lousy.


01 Apr 2015, 02:22 PM

An earlier today announcement that ONVO is ready to tackle live kidney tubular tissues must have scared the shorts.

Yes especially since ONVO's already proven they can't really sell the liver assays either, lol. Why not add
more science projects to the shelf?

Mark Fonnemann
It's amazing how little journalistic integrity is needed to publish an "article" today.


01 Apr 2015, 02:37 PM

And all it takes for ONVO to publish an 'article' is a willingness to pay the good people over at Retail Investors
Forum, or an in-house writer to put on their website.


You guys are never bothered by pump pieces but that's just the hypocrisy of the long mind.


03 Apr 2015, 08:14 PM

When I read About Alpha Exposure it says... They have chosen to contribute to Seeking Alpha anonymously. That
should be enough about credibility. But then I see they are Shorting ONVO which says even more...and to add insult
they reference to CITRON and the convicted Security Fraud Andrew Left... 
Eli you stated months ago you were going to clean up S A but you must stop putting these misleading Articles on SA.

This sounds like they were paid to write this article to protect shorts who are in trouble.

Citron has a huge following and his problems were many years ago. The reason so many people follow him is
because like Pearson he's got a good track record.


03 Apr 2015, 08:16 PM


IgnatiusReilly35
Pearson's last attempt, on ADXS, was a joke, and has ruined his reputation forever. That fact was clearly
highlighted by Adam Feuerstein and then the fact that Adage Capital and T Rowe invested even more money
shortly after you published his misleading hack piece. This article on ONVO has Pearson written all over it.
His credibility is so shot that he won't even use his real name anymore.

Pearson uses his real name and recently exposed an entire fraudulent scheme involving multiple companies
employing a pump and dump firm called The Dream Team. That IR firm was submitting phony bullish articles
under pseudonyms and now SA and Motley Fool both modified their submission practices thanks to Richard.

How has this individual effected the stock price? What has the management of ONVO done to "pump" the stock price.
Literally nothing. The CEO even has said on multiple occasions he does not care about the short-term stock price. He
is interested only in delivering long-term shareholder value.


01 Apr 2015, 02:56 PM

How does an article like this come out the same day and slight after ONVO reports substantial news for the first time
since November?


Someone at SA holding on this for a special occasion?


Or did SA receive, read, and approve this article in the course of a half day? If so, you folks need to overhaul your fact
checking department. SA's credibility is tied to articles such as these as well. Not impressed.

I just checked. 16.5 MILLION shares short on this deal. People who write bad article like this are manipulating for their
own personal gain and are defrauding the public. As such, IF the NaSd and SEC were actually doing their job, they
would not only investigate and ultimately charge the author(s) of this article, they would charge SA for allowing
anonymous and unsupported articles like this to be printed.


01 Apr 2015, 03:13 PM


Mukticat
You're assuming the information in this article is incorrect. In fact not a single poster here has even tried to
disprove the allegations. The SEC doesn't waste their time acting as a Pumping Enforcement Entity on you.


03 Apr 2015, 08:20 PM


Office Rat
"You're assuming the information in this article is incorrect."


Readers with intelligence realize the information in this article is irrelevant, and mostly speculation.


06 Apr 2015, 01:49 PM


jhaverlack
Here's the problem with your piece and your stance. It may or may not be factual, we don't know. The issue is just so
happens that this piece comes out after ONVO catches a bid on the heels of kidney news. Coincidence, I think not.
So an anonymous group spouting off about a short position with negative news with obvious purpose to move the
stock lower to support your position.


How is this any different than your alleged affiliation with a stock promoter who would want to take the stock higher?
Because he was "convicted"? Again, I think not. There is no difference. You're using the same freedom of press to
provide a catalyst to move the stock in your desired direction.


Game over.

Jefferson Rich
Let me get this straight, the author who hides behind his computer with a cloak of anonymity, who says he respects
Citron/Left/Pearson, also says that some other guy is a manipulator and that this other guy may have been a principal
of an entity that owned Pre-IPO stock in early 2012.


This is news?


How does this article's "news" equate to:


- For the first time in human history, fully human kidney proximal tubular tissues have been generated that are three-
dimensional, and consist of multiple tissue-relevant cell types arranged to recapitulate the renal tubular / interstitial
interface.


- Immunohistochemical analysis shows clear evidence of intercellular junction formation (E-Cadherin+) between the
epithelial cells, extensive formation of microvascular structures, and stable maintenance of the layered architecture for
at least two weeks in vitro


- Dr. Sharon Presnell, Organovo's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Research and
Development, stated, "Our bioprinted human kidney tissue represents a significant technical advance over the simple
monolayer cell line cultures that predominate today. The histologic and functional features of the initial prototypes are
compelling, and the in vitro durability of the system will likely enable the assessment of drug effects at chronic,
physiologically relevant doses. Furthermore, the cellular complexity of the system will likely support mechanistic
investigations into drug responses, including end points that have been difficult or impossible to assess in vitro,
including tubular fibrosis and post-injury recovery."


Wake up people. Short Sellers submit articles on days like this to protect their positions. They don't just anonymously
write something to "help protect investors."


Seeking Alpha has become myspace for investors.


01 Apr 2015, 03:15 PM


omeshrin
It doesn't equate, Jefferson. This has "I'm bitter and want to punish this company and pocket some cash but
since there is increasingly less things to nitpick as the company progresses I will research until I find
something that maybe probably could be true and twist that in my favor. oh, but I'll do so anonymously to try
limit any liability and use 'we' (as he refers to himself in the article) so I am seen as a research group as
opposed to very likely just one guy with Citron and Left emailing back and forth."


01 Apr 2015, 04:37 PM

WHY NOT SHORT THE STOCK AND REPORT THIS INFO. TO SEC INSTEAD OF TO S/A??? A LOT OF HARD
WORK FOR A FEW DOLLARS.....


01 Apr 2015, 04:16 PM


Mukticat
The longs are such belly-ache complainers! Frankly it's always amateur hour around here as the longs hang on for
the ride back to zero (plus cash value) but all the same I never hear them complain that their CEO is simultaneously a
dumper of shares and the biggest cheerleader for the stock you ever saw. How many times has he gone before the
ultra-amateur forum 'Retail Investor's Conference'? Five times? More? There he gets to pitch this stock to the trade-
from-home unemployed and retired who sadly are just gullible enough to swallow his bait. Meanwhile those who know
better; the biotech funds and HF's just stay away or short the stock.


Weigh Murphy's endless puffery against the occasional SA article which explains the truth about why ONVO is
worthless. Then bellyache on.

The recent seeking alpha exposes have a strange tendency to be published after the stock have already tanked 30-
40% in a month or so.


Don't see much alpha being left for the readers, except of course for the 'higly-respected' shortsellers.


01 Apr 2015, 06:00 PM

"...highly-respected short seller Citron..." Highly respected by you and who else? This is a steaming pile of conjecture
and inuendo, starting with the first word of your title, worthy of Citron and Pearson. Maybe you are all one and the
same.


BTW, your alleged evidence citing the Juno footnotes show nothing more than ARCH is ARCH. What does that prove,
that you are stretching for any kind of contrived evidence with which you can support your allegations?


01 Apr 2015, 06:43 PM


Mukticat
ONVO has absolutely cratered since Pearson and Left predicted that this company is an empty suit. It's gone
from a high of 13.50 down to 3.50 in 18 months. If that doesn't prove they were right what would?


01 Apr 2015, 06:59 PM


AlphaNerd
Even ONVO admitted their stock was over values when it was above $12, moron.


And the fact that the stock falls when prominent short sellers say it will has nothing to do with their being right
and everything to do with the manipulation we have been seeing since ONVO was in the 7s.

"It seems you don't understand how logic works."


It's been quite a while since I've had a logic class, but I'd call this rant a straw man argument. The author is
attacking ONVO for possible connections to someone who may or may not have done something vaguely
nefarious in relation to this company some time in the distant past.


Now how do you defend the author's use of an example where he's claiming that a different company (Juno)
discloses the invidividuals behind the investing companies (and Organovo doesn't) and inserts a chart that
displays ARCH Venture Fund is none other than ARCH Venture Fund? That's your idea of logic?

I think by now , everyone following ONVO can pretty much realize that when ONVO releases positive data there are
analysts who publish negative comments about ONVO almost immediately. Also, ONVO has been pretty good at
replying to these types of claims in a relatively small time frame. I am curious to see what their response will be. I
hope the do reply. Why all the hate for this stock? And, Alpha Exposure, you 'think' this and 'Believe' that. Let's try
writing the truth and not what we 'think'.


01 Apr 2015, 07:21 PM

there is no "hate". its just greed. they're short millions of shares of the stock and are trying to undermine the
company by manipulating the share price.

The market will prove out as always. My research is fairly compelling, and this technology has valuable, this company
is several years ahead of its competition and its value will prove. It will take time and if the shorts push it too low, a
competitor will buy it, if they are not already in the process of doing so as they risk reward at $4 or less per share if
more than compelling if one believes as my colleagues do, that this is a fantastic cost effective solution.


So, let the shorts push it lower, and if you believe as I do, in the technology and the products, say thank you as the
potential growth and revenues make this technology worth far far more than $4/share... even if they dilute...


01 Apr 2015, 07:49 PM


ccal
its also interesting to note that the "alpha exposure" author chooses to be anonymous!!! So, he "exposes" others who,
as far as I can see, have NOTHING to do with the company other than having been a shareholder (no evidence to
suggest Appel still is) but does NOT expose his own identity. I'm not a shareholder of this company but if I had some
gamblin' money lying around, I'd certainly give it a shot. over 22% of the float has been shorted. The motivation for
this rag is obvious. Best of luck to ONVO and its shareholders.

You know it's a good short when an army of retail longs come out to defend the stock after a cutting article, and then
those comments get 10+ likes for complaining about the author. Actually, that's probably the main leading indicator of

currently in production--they don't have any other products to market right now and if this product doesn't sell, they're
gonna have to do a secondary and/or take on more debt. I don't really think the stock should be popping on news of
farther-down-the-line concepts than the current one (the LIVER) that the longs ought to be hoping is selling this
quarter.


Disclosure: I have no current stock or options position in ONVO right now.


02 Apr 2015, 01:12 AM


Sam's Picks, Contributor
Disclosure: 0 position and know relatively nothing about the company.


That said, I love how everyone seemingly long this stock is attacking the author for pointing out FACTS that come
straight from ONVO's filings. I understand people don't like to hear facts that don't jibe with what they want to believe
but at least try and dispute the author with additional facts rather than attack him for being anonymous.

If you truly feel that ONVO has done, or is involved in, something improper or something illegal, then you should refer
the matter to the SEC.

They author backed up everything he or she wrote with easy-to-follow links. Why not take 5 minutes and look
for yourself?


02 Apr 2015, 09:52 AM


Market Cuts Both Ways, Contributor
If the author had wanted to provide objective information for the good of investors why didn't they present the
powerful proof points about ONVO. Roche's scientific study on their liver tissue, etc. This hack piece reminds
me of when shorts tried to demonize the stock because of their way they achieved up listing by merging into
another company. Again, no merit to whether they are going to make money in the future, just shorts sowing
doubt to shake down uninformed investors.

5/18/2018 Apparent Connections To A Convicted Stock Promoter: Another Chapter In The Organovo Saga - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ON…

So far from the truth. Go back to where Organovo started and you will see it is the University of Missouri. When they
decided to move west and go public they bought the real estate company that had no assets. Why ? It had been
delisted but was still registered and the perfect way to get listed on the market. So changing the name from whatever
real estate company to Organovo and with the correct paper work qualified them for the market. Howard Appel may
have been involved with the delisted real estate company and that is the only connection if any. Look at the major
stockholders and do you think they would not have researched and invested in Organovo if anything appeared out of
place.


02 Apr 2015, 10:05 AM


Market Cuts Both Ways, Contributor
I have followed ONVO for a few years now. Invested in them before they up listed, which made a pretty penny for all
involved (except the shorts of course). If you have followed its press as long as I have you see that it is a magnate for
the short press who see the type of investors it attracts - i.e., ones interested in cutting-edge technology, 3D printing,
bio-printing, all of the above - as easy marks for shaking out the "weak hands" to make themselves money.


ONVO has suffered a precipitous fall in price since February 18. You can now pick it up for cheaper than two days
before its leap in price when it up listed on July 11, 2013. The shorts like to point out a lot of useless trivia that is
ancient history (as evidenced here) or has nothing to do with the stock, but fail to mention its solid proof points. Did
this author happen to mention that ONVO's liver tissue was endorsed by Roche researchers as unique and
revolutionary (it would have saved the hundreds of million in research dollars)? No. Did the author happen to mention
that the company's guidance puts substantial new revenue from their new product into Q1 and Q2 of this year? No.
When is the perfect time for shorts to drive the price down so they can make money on the way down, and then buy-
in low and make money when the stock takes off? This is the perfect time to sucker investors out of a fair price for
their positions. Don't be the fool they are counting on!


Disclosure: I waited till the last price crash seemed to stabilize and have begun to buy in during the last few days. I
have never shorted ONVO and never will.

Did you ever ask yourself why Pfizer, after giving ONVO $1M for a 'first-look' at the liver assays in 2012, got
them, looked, and then was never heard from again? That is until they showed up as a client of ONVO's
competitor Insphero.

No. Did you ever ask yourself why Aventis sold H.P. Acthar Gel to Questcor for $100,000? Sometimes

This smells to me like the attacks on QCOR. Keep shorting, my friend.


02 Apr 2015, 04:04 PM


Mukticat
This is different Rat. Otoh you have ONVO CEO and serial stock-seller, Keith Murphy, claiming that their 3D
liver assays are 'revolutionary' 'disruptive' 'huge market', 'we're the only ones', yada yada yada, and otoh you
have the pre-eminent big Pharma; Pfizer, the kind ONVO would looooove to associate with, saying basically .
. . 'we looked and not so much, in fact we think Insphero has a better 3D liver assay'.


So you have to ask yourself who you gonna believe? Cheerleader Exec Officer Murphy or Pfizer?


I'm happy to take the Pfizer position every day of the week! And in fact it's paid off in spades - and will
continue to do so - as ONVO follows a pattern of no sales and lower highs and lower lows on our way back to
the OTC market.


02 Apr 2015, 04:14 PM


playitagainsam
I dumped all of my stock in ONVO at $3.70 following this article, taking a hit. Never know for sure what's going to
happen, but this stock has been nothing but a roller coaster ride from the beginning, and I started suspecting
manipulation when I saw huge swings on old news republished. I've already likely done a lot of damage to my own
liver while owning this stock.

At the investor relations section of ONVO's website there is an 'FAQ'. They updated a small portion of it in response to
this piece. I suggest everyone take a look.

It seems pretty risky to short a company that has the potential to generate global headlines overnight and capture the
imagination of people who might not normally invest. Successfully graft some 3d printed skin to a pig, and boom
you're making headlines around the globe, even if you have ties to Jobba the Hut nobody will care. Organovo knows
how to get in the spotlight, and I'm sure they have a few aces up their sleeve. If your short on ONVO the last thing you
should want is 60 minutes to do an investigation, all people will remember is seeing a fancy lab with white coats Dr.
looking figures showing off slides of 3d printed organ tissues, talking about how someday they might be able to create
organs for implant that could save millions of lives.

The IR "FAQ" that references this article is kinda funny:


http://bit.ly/1aRyFVl


They criticize the author for making a "guilt by association" argument, but then immediately does the same thing by
spending half of the response lumping Alpha Exposure in with another unrelated author who made unrelated

The shorts are really disliking the critics of this article. Anyone who follows this stock knows them well. You either
believe in ONVO and wait until this June or you get out. In the meantime I guess someone has to gamble until then. 
What is troubling is that new Investors may believe a lot of this article and get out and take losses unnecessarily.  
The very first words of the author should have told you something...We Believe? Someday SA and Eli will hopefully
start policing these articles better. Also when an Author remains anonymous that should be a red flag. 
At least you can read the dis-closer..The author is short ONVO. The author wrote this article themselves, and it
expresses their own opinions. The author is not receiving compensation for it. The author has no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. 
I ask you a few questions here..Why would someone write an article and not receive any compensation...Someone
surely is paying them...also why not write this to the Attorney General who could keep them anonymous if they really
wanted to be.. 
SA Eli please read this and let me know what you think of printing this!

This doesn't change the fact that this particular article, this one that we're all commenting on, is merely a guilt by
association hit piece that has nothing to do with what the company does, or the company's plan to execute and
generate value for long term shareholders, does it?


Oh thank goodness for you shorts! You shorts are the best because you are so smart and so right and know the truth!
You are just good people doing the saintly work, saving dumb retail longs from this company that is...that is....oh my
god...that is tied to...the mafia!!!!! So ridiculous. I am Still looking forward to the accusations that when ONVO reports
its accelerating revenues quarter after quarter that the money they're getting is counterfeit!!!!

I sat and read all 98 comments. This whole feud between the Shorts and Longs makes for a solid read! 
I think one needs to take every press-release and online article with a grain of salt, no matter what. For those making
a living off investments I understand the anxiety. Panic is an investors worse enemy, so take a deep breathe and clear
the fear.

When you take into consideration the time and effort that Mukticat is spending defending this article maybe he is the
author. Muk, I would like to point out one simple fact, while this article if full of unsubstantiated allegations, Left was
found guilty.


06 Apr 2015, 02:56 PM


ECapo
@flyer777..Muk has no other way to protect his short interest than make the comments he does. At times he makes
personal attacks when he gets frustrated the longs are out. I wonder how many thumbs down he would get if SA
would change their policy and start it like Yahoo or even better never publish any article unless the author does it
identifying themselves as is standard Journalism. Oh how good SA would become. For any of us that are long we
have come too far not to see what is at the end of this tunnel in June or soon thereafter. ONVO is still a good
speculative company and one to have in your portfolio.

Yup L'Oreal USA must be run by idiots and criminals to partner with so unscrupulous and ignorant a bunch as ONVO.
BTW, skin cell assays for biomedical use are a great diversification for ONVO which will now have three commercially
available products: liver, kidney and skin. Unless you want an instant profit it seems like there is no reason to not
invest a few long bucks in this speculative stock.


07 Apr 2015, 05:14 PM

@jeff... Some people do not understand and try to lump ONVO with all 3D. ONVO has a lot of potential and soon we
will know in June what company sales are. But as with all companies they start slow and build up after launch and I
am sure the shorts will bash whatever the results are.  
L' Oreal must have seen something in ONVO as you stated.

Yes it will go up but there is no doubt it will go down some as some take quick profits from the uptick lately as they

I think at some point people here should understand that Organovo is a company with a proven disruptive platform
which happens to be in an industry of the future. Being one of the pioneers in 3D printed organ's and tissues makes
this company worth owning.

to explain this to everyone.


22 Apr 2015, 10:09 AM

As usual none of these 'collaborations' involve Big Company giving any money to ONVO. It costs Merck nothing and
ONVO gets some nice publicity to distract from the fact that the liver assays that were going to make them millions of
dollars has fallen flat on its face. But forget the present and just keep thinking about the future.


So yes Pearson was absolutely right when he wrote that the liver assays would amount to nothing.


22 Apr 2015, 11:30 AM


hhess13892
As usual you comment about the past. Smart investments are based on the future of a company .


btw.... How many millions were invested in your heavily touted collaboration of Pfizer-InSphero


keep shorting MUK. I'll continue accumulating.


22 Apr 2015, 11:41 AM

Funny how all your past comments about the future, ie- how their incredible liver assays would revolutionize drug
testing and save Big Pharma billions of dollars while bringing in tens of millions of dollars are now suddenly relegated
to the 'past'.


So forget that failure and lets look for something new, lol.


And congratulations on owning one of the worst performing stocks right in the middle of the greatest biotech bubble
we've seen.

What part of the long thesis - your thesis - that liver assays would make this company worth half a billion dollars has

I've made very good money on ONVO and that's no joke either :)


All you've had is a deadcat bounce while the downtrend remains unbroken. Meanwhile the insiders and the company

The joke's on you dude.

There is much more to be made.


L'Oreal and Merck must be wasting their time through your eyes. You should make them aware of that with all that
personal knowledge you have.


Why have that not rushed to InSphero?


22 Apr 2015, 03:01 PM

As for L'Oreal why is ONVO recycling old news? They reported a 'collaboration' with them first in Oct 2013 or
did you forget?


http://1.usa.gov/1yTy6dO


Oh I know why . . . they need to keep a steady stream of sheeple to buy the shares they sell into the market
from their $50M standing Shelf Offering.


And why are you comparing ONVO to InSphero? We know ONVO is losing tens of millions of dollars a year
whereas InSphero is a privately held company which has to be making some money or they wouldn't still be
in business (since they can't rely on bagholders to continually fund their operations).


Also, I'm sure you made lots of $$$ longing this on the way down. You're that great of a trader, lol.

22 Apr 2015, 04:09 PM

Maybe you don't know how to click on links but the link I posted was announcement issued on Oct 2, 2013
which clearly states-


Item 8.01 Other Events 
Organovo Holdings, Inc. has entered into an agreement with L’Oreal exploring the use of 3D skin for testing
skin care products. Terms have not been disclosed.'


You seem to have trouble telling past from present.


And don't worry about InSphero, like we argued before they have 3D liver assays too and there's nothing
special about ONVO's (except an accumulated deficit of -$120,000,000 with nothing of value to show for it).


22 Apr 2015, 04:50 PM

How many more times will Muk call the liver assays a failure before the actual sales figures come in?


Pre-release of the product brought in 250k, I don't know about you guys but usually the pre-release is a
fraction of the size of the real release...


If the real realse is 4x larger then we are looking at a million a quarter for the VERY first product launch.


22 Apr 2015, 05:19 PM


Mukticat
Oh so much confusion from the illiterati! The 'pre-release' was an early release of (lack-of) earnings results for
the fourth quarter. The liver assay itself was released in Nov, 2014 and has clearly really rocked the market
with a quarter mil in sales and six million in losses ;-)


'Based on preliminary financial information for the fiscal quarter and year-ended March 31, 2015, Organovo
estimates:


Total net revenues of approximately $268 thousand for the quarter, and approximately $571 thousand for the
fiscal year'


'nuff said!

However with an average price in the low 4s, I'm in the green :)


If you want to answer the question, please answer why you are badgering a company for product revenues
when they clearly stated when the revenues will be available? You have no patience or you're a liar?

I didn't avoid your point, I told you that I don't believe a word Murphy says. Since you just got in the stock you
don't know much about its history of over-hyping and undelivering. The made the liver assays available a year
ago April for in-house work and nothing came of it. Their grand debut was last Nov and nothing has come of
it.


The end. And now I will let the illiterati have the final word :)

Muk,


Twist my words anyway you want. Your thoughts matter little to me. It's the people that may listen to your half
truths that I feel bad for.

Mukticat is getting worried!


22 Apr 2015, 05:14 PM

@hhess13892andlifestoc... Thanks for your point counter point..I have been in ONVO for awhile also. Muk is
out there and promoting the short for one and only one reason as you know all to well...if he did anything else
it would be cutting off his nose despite his face. Muk has no idea what is written into the agreements of MERK
and others or he would publish them.  
ONVO is needed and moving ahead as they promised years ago. As you say soon we shall all see...we can
wait but can he. We are now in the fourth quarter of the game and still have not left the game.  
I wonder what would happen if ONVO released information on some other medical related innovations. Say
like heart valves etc. or even some other tissues like Liver and Kidney. There are a lot of medical problems
and a lot of risk from medications. To be able to lessen the risk is to lesson the costly lawsuits later. I say GO
ONVO!

Mukticat
I promote a short of ONVO because A) it's a total POS and I've been right . . . the stock has utterly tanked
from 13 to 5, and B) I shorted the stock . . . duh.


You promote a long of ONVO because . . . you're long the stock . . . double duh.


'I wonder what would happen if ONVO released information on some other medical related innovations.'


What, you mean actually tell investors what's behind the headlines of their occasional PR'ed
'collaborations'?? Nevah!! lol


At best you get recycled press releases like the L'Oreal announcement.

Muk...I am an investor and trader trying to make a few more dollars and keep my retirement safe. I believe in
what ONVO is doing and their affect on the medical field. I also believe they are the one capable of success.  
I hold nothing against anyone who shorts as you should have nothing against longs. It does bother me when
some try to distort things with misleading or slanting statements or maybe those who are paid to do this. As
you know I have been with ONVO for as long as you but we are on different sides. I have made some profits
and stayed invested. If I and others stayed in this long we are in for the long haul. ONVO has done what it
said from the beginning and stated June-Aug it will release sales etc. Even then I do not expect the stock the
company to anywhere near its potential but it will give enough to see where the future may be heading.

MUK,


Why would you think this happened?

The author references Richard Pearson as stating that other competitors are better than ONVO. Well, Richard
Pearson also wrote an extremely bearish, short article on ADXS when it spiked from the $4 dollar range to $13+
earlier this year and sent it tumbling to the $7 range. IMO it was shorts driving the price lower to establish a position
knowing that significant catalysts were on the horizon and/or betting that such a quick spike indicated a pullback and
hence driving iot a slow as possible to maximize their gains. ADXS is now at $23+.


I can only hope that those long on ONVO benefit from the Pearson effect. Not condoning the practice, but if it is going
to be allowed to take place, then those who have long positions and invest in a company for the right reasons, should
benefit as well, perhaps even more.

TC_Trader
Despite the face? Lol. It's "to spite."


Anyway, Muk you had your short run at the right time. They are turning the corner to revenue so it is time to lose the
short if not go long. This is the biotech space, it takes a long time to generate EPS, you act like it's not the norm. Get
real man.


23 Apr 2015, 11:02 PM


Mukticat
This is just too funny. ONVO has finished its deadcat bounce and looks like we're on the way back to 3's.


Seems the market wasn't much impressed by either the failure of the liver assays to generate meaningful
sales or the recycling of 18 month OLD news about L'Oreal.


27 Apr 2015, 01:10 PM


TC_Trader
Seriously, dude? IBB got raked today. ONVO wasn't out of the ordinary for what happened to biotech today,
especially small caps. Before you make comments check the circumstances! Troll

'IBB got raked today'


Yes but the IBB is still up 53% this year, and 100% over two years. ONVO, the pretend biotech, is down for
the last year and has gone exactly nowhere over two years. So what's the basis of your comparison?


And yes if you're looking for stocks bid up by the least informed investors ONVO's a great place to troll.


27 Apr 2015, 05:20 PM


flyer777
Muk, you should change your name to Mukraker. I find it interesting that you post mainly in support of any negative
article. Seldom do you try your tactics on the positive articles or those with substance.


27 Apr 2015, 03:23 PM


ECapo
@flyer777..MUK has no other thing that he can do but try and drive ONVO down to make money on his short
positions.  
TcTrader..makes a comment that makes sense as you can see. It is too bad SA does not allow Dislike as they do
Like... 
As you can see ONVO is doing fairly well within its sector but still takes a hit not only with the biotech but 3D sector
also.


28 Apr 2015, 09:37 AM


flyer777
ECapo, I could not agree with you more that ONVO is caught between biotech and 3D. The last read that I
have on the short interest in ONVO is 20,594,100, a little over 28%. With ONVO starting to execute this
should prove to be a fun ride. Muk and the other shorts are doing their best to drive the price down so that
they can cover at the lowest price. I can't wait to see this back fire on them.

else is also aware he is up to no good.

Hey Former SEC -


1. Are you ALSO claiming that ONVO is 100% a scam, and that you are just trying to "help the common
investors" much like the author, Alpha Exposure?


2. Would you say these lists show that once and for all, there can be no doubt, ONVO is run by...wait for
it...wait for it... the MAFIA!?!?!?


3. Is ONVO so good at scamming people that the World Economic Forum, Yale, Merck and L'Oreal have all
fallen prey to their magical scheme in which they get people to use their scammy product?


4. Former SEC, who are you? Aren't you really just Pearson? Citron? Left? Mukti? Alpha Exposure? Come on
now! Be honest Former SEC! You are a guy who's posted 4 Comments on SA ever, and they're all related to
the absurd ONVO/Mafia scam theory.

20 May 2015, 12:25 PM

@Jefferson Rich..bravo...bravo...... has actually formed a bottom now and the only thing that will drive it down
is any is on the coat tail of a correction and maybe some with people still aligning it with the 3D sector in
general which is a big mistake. Soon shorts will have to find another or should I say move their bets to other
stocks after they are squeezed.

You don't have to believe the documents. I have a list of over 40 stocks that Howie has been associated with
in the last ten years - most are now unlisted, none are worth more than $1.50 - and all were pumped up to $5
to $20 at the height of the pump and dump. This baby is just another in a long line of Appel/Pelullo scams.


02 Jun 2015, 09:32 PM

A scam would infer they have no product. Are you saying Merck doesn't know what they're dealing with? 
As for your list of "relief defendants"-Relief defendants are nominal, innocent parties who hold funds traceable
to the receivership but have no legitimate claim or ownership interest in them. 
SEC you mean Southeastern Conference right?

Sam's Picks, Contributor
Where them longs at now? Is this another great buying opportunity? The company couldn't have issued shares to
raise cash when their stock was slightly higher? This REEKS of desperation.


18 Jun 2015, 02:46 PM


Mukticat
Oh it's way more than desperation, the company has $50M in the bank from earlier share dumps, err, capital raises,
they spend very little on R&D, and so they have to do another $40M raise at a 20% DISCOUNT TO MARKET?!?


The problem is that their liver assay release keeled over on the launch pad and they know that if they want to be
around for a long time they need to grab every last buck they can while they're still listed on (the very minor part of) a
major exchange.
