Did Lumber Liquidators Know It Was Selling Toxic Laminate?

by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


This question defines the bull-bear debate on Lumber Liquidators.


I think senior managers knew, for six primary reasons: industry scuttlebutt; Ray
Cotton; Lumber Liquidators’ behavior; knowledge of the industry, the product, and
China; knowledge of the Chinese mills; and a lie-detection analysis.


If they knew and this information becomes public, then it would be devastating to the
company (and the stock).


In many ways, the question of whether senior managers of Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL)
knew that they were buying toxic, formaldehyde-drenched, non-CARB-compliant laminate
from their Chinese suppliers defines the bull-bear debate on this stock. If this proves to be
the case, it would be devastating to the company in the courtroom, amongst regulators,
and in the court of public opinion - so much so, in fact, that I believe the fate of the
company (and the stock) will be largely determined by this issue.


The bulls, to the extent that they acknowledge any formaldehyde problem at all, tend to
think that Lumber Liquidators' Chinese suppliers deceived the company, claiming to be
producing CARB-compliant laminate but in reality not doing so to inflate their profits, so at
worst the senior managers of Lumber Liquidators are guilty of being sloppy, naïve and/or
overly trusting.


Conversely, the bears (myself included) think they deliberately sourced toxic laminate -
knowingly threatening the health and safety of their installers and customers, especially
children - to save ~10% on their sourcing costs, and are now engineering a massive
cover-up to hide their evil behavior.


Let me be very clear: I cannot prove my hypothesis. To date, no damning emails,
documents or whistle-blowers have emerged, nor have any Chinese suppliers ratted them
out. But I'm not surprised by this - these things take time, and it's only been 38 days since
the 60 Minutes story aired.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3057456-did-lumber-liquidators-know-it-was-selling-toxic-laminate 2/34


I'm confident that the truth will eventually be discovered by the many regulators, lawyers,
reporters and short sellers who are carefully scrutinizing the company. When the truth
does emerge, I think it's 90% likely that we will learn that at least some senior managers at
Lumber Liquidators knew exactly what was going on.


Why am I so sure? There are six primary reasons:


1) Industry scuttlebutt. I have spoken with numerous people in the industry and have yet
to hear a single person tell me anything along the lines of "I was shocked by the 60
Minutes story because it's not at all consistent with the company I know." In fact, no one
I've spoken with was the slightest bit surprised by it.


Without exception, they tell me that Lumber Liquidators is a notorious bad actor: cutting
corners at every opportunity, selling very low-quality products, treating customers,
installers and employees badly, and, most damningly, not being serious about compliance.


2) Ray Cotton. No company serious about compliance would hire (and twice promote)
someone like Ray Cotton to be Senior Vice President, Chief Compliance and
Sustainability Officer. As I document in the last section of this article, Lumber Liquidators'
Campaign Of Distraction And Deception, he's totally unqualified for the job and is not a
serious person (to see what I mean, take a look at his personal home page and Twitter
feed before he took them down - see links below). In fact, he's exactly the person I think a
company would hire if it was knowingly sourcing tainted product and didn't want the head
of compliance to know about it. Here's an excerpt about him from my article:



https://seekingalpha.com/article/2990196-lumber-liquidators-campaign-of-distraction-and-deception
5/23/2018 Did Lumber Liquidators Know It Was Selling Toxic Laminate? - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3057456-did-lumber-liquidators-know-it-was-selling-toxic-laminate 3/34


His LinkedIn profile reveals a college degree from an online, for-profit school
followed by plenty of job hopping (10 jobs at seven employers from October 2000 to
the present), yet little relevant experience related to his most important areas of
responsibility at Lumber Liquidators: quality control, sourcing, managing suppliers in
China, overseeing the testing program, etc. Rather, every prior job was related to
either "security" or "loss prevention."


Worse yet, Cotton doesn't appear to be a serious person, as evidenced by his
personal home page, which borders on comical and bizarre (he took it down a day or
two ago, but not before I took screenshots of every page - click here), and the fact
that less than two weeks ago, on February 24-26, he attended the Oscars and
posted to his Twitter account (#raycotton) a dozen photos of himself standing behind
the stars on the red carpet (again, he's since removed them, but I have posted my
screenshots here).


Why should anyone care if he took a few days off to attend the Oscars? Because at
the very moment that he was posting some of these pictures (check the time
stamps) - the morning of Wednesday, February 25th - the company was reporting: a)
terrible earnings; b) that the Department of Justice might be bringing criminal
charges against it for violations of the Lacey Act (for buying and importing
hardwoods illegally harvested in Siberia); and c) that 60 Minutes was running a
negative story a few days later - all of which crushed the stock 26% that day.


To repeat: on this crucial day, Lumber Liquidators' Senior Vice President, Chief
Compliance and Sustainability Officer was yukking it up at the Oscars. Talk about
fiddling while Rome burns...


3) Lumber Liquidators' behavior. Since the 60 Minutes story broke, the company has, in
my opinion, acted exactly as I'd expect a guilty company, not an honest and reputable
one, to act. Imagine if this story was about Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Immediately after it
aired, Home Depot would:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3057456-did-lumber-liquidators-know-it-was-selling-toxic-laminate 4/34


a) Stop selling the product in question (even if it doubted the validity of the testing 60
Minutes did, why take any chances with customers' health and the company's
reputation, not to mention future liabilities?);


b) Offer a full refund to any customers who wanted to return unopened product;


c) Set up a Special Committee of the board, made up of independent directors, to
conduct a full investigation; and


d) Hire an independent firm to do a wide range of testing, not just of Chinese-made
laminate, but all of the company's products.


This isn't rocket science - it's Crisis Management 101. Yet Lumber Liquidators hasn't done
a single one of these things. The only possible explanation, in my mind, is that they have a
lot to hide - and they know it - in which case, the deny-and-attack strategy they've
adopted, which I analyzed in my article, Explaining Lumber Liquidators' Reckless Strategy
And Rebutting Its Claims About Deconstructive Testing, makes perfect sense.


4) The industry, the product and China. The idea that Lumber Liquidators was duped by
nefarious Chinese mills is preposterous. As I wrote in my first article, Why Lumber
Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB:

Laminated wood is a low-end, global commodity product in which 1% or 2%
differences in pricing are meaningful. For a savvy player like LL, which has been
buying in China for roughly two decades, they would instantly know that if they were
buying 10% below the standard price for a particular piece of laminated wood that
something was wrong: perhaps it was stolen, used illegal or incorrect wood, was of
exceptionally low quality, or was filled with toxic chemicals.


Maybe this example will resonate. Let's say you're in Shanghai and looking to buy
the DVD of the latest Hollywood movie - let's say, Academy Award winner Birdman,
which is still in theaters, so it's of course not yet out on DVD. Ah, but lo and behold,
as you walk down the street, you see that a street vendor has a copy and sells it to
you for $2. Moments later, the police apprehend you and accuse you of buying
illegal/forged merchandise. You would of course claim that you had no idea - but OF
COURSE you knew, based on where you were (China) and the price you paid.


Similarly, LL had to have known there was something seriously wrong with the
laminated wood it was buying, given the absurdly low price and the fact that it was
coming from China, which is the wild west when it comes to environmental
standards and rule of law. Even if the Chinese mills said they were CARB 2
compliant and even if they were supposedly inspected, this cannot be relied on.
Heck, this is a country that sold us defective wallboard that soon because filled with
toxic mold, and which pumped pigs full of clenbuterol (see here). In short, many
Chinese companies, especially those in highly competitive, commoditized industries,
scoff at most regulations, especially if the product is being shipped to the US. Many
friends have told me that China is for the Chinese; if they can screw Americans, they
will - and they did with LL, which might take down company.


But LL's pleas that they are the victim here ring hollow once you realize that the two
biggest buyers of wood flooring in the US, Home Depot and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW),
also buy laminated wood in China, yet don't have a formaldehyde problem (to the
best of my knowledge). The reason is simple: they have serious, rigorous
compliance programs and understand that you can't hit the low bid in China and
expect to get high-quality, compliant product. So they pay more and get good
flooring - but earn lower margins, something LL wasn't willing to do in its pell mell
pursuit (regardless of the consequences) of a higher and higher stock price so
insiders could cash out.

5) The Chinese mills. As further evidence that Lumber Liquidators knew exactly what it
was buying, my sources with direct, on-the-ground experience in China tell me that the
Chinese mills openly sell non-CARB-compliant laminate - just ask them for a price quote.
This isn't surprising, as they sell to customers all over the world and many countries don't
have formaldehyde standards.


It's simple: the Chinese mills will produce whatever the customer orders and package it
however the customer wishes, even if it says the laminate is CARB-compliant when it's
not. Heck, they'll even provide phony documentation to that effect! This is all part of the
customer service package many Chinese mills are happy to provide - especially to a very
big customer like Lumber Liquidators.


I wrote about this in my article, Lumber Liquidators Is Evil:


In fact, someone who reached out to me after the 60 Minutes story aired, who's very
credible and knowledgeable about the industry, shared with me an email he received
from one of his suppliers (which happens to be one of the mills shown on the 60
Minutes segment), in which the Vice President of the mill offers to sell him laminate
and gives two prices: one for safe laminate with formaldehyde levels below the limit
set by CARB and one for toxic laminate that doesn't comply (for a lower price of
course). Here is the key part of the email:


I think it will be good manner to solve this problem of the carb2


boards. When u be here we can talk about it, ok?


Now customers need the carb2 need to add 0.5usd/Sqm.


Here's what really boggles my mind: this email was sent seven days after the 60
Minutes story exposed that the mill was selling non-CARB 2-compliant laminate -
they're not ashamed of it; rather, they're perfectly open about it.


It's also powerful evidence that, while Lumber Liquidators can show lots of
paperwork from the Chinese mills and testing facilities attesting to CARB 2
compliance, the company in fact knew exactly what it was buying in China - and, in
turn, selling its customers.

6) A lie-detection analysis. The ex-CIA guys at Qverity, authors of Spy the Lie, did a
careful analysis of what Lumber Liquidator' founder and Chairman, Tom Sullivan, did and
didn't say when he was interviewed by Anderson Cooper in the 60 Minutes story, and they
have posted a damning report that concludes:


QVerity's behavioral analysis of the interview concluded that Sullivan was likely
aware that his company was selling flooring that was non-compliant with these
regulations, and that he appeared to be withholding information, the disclosure of
which could result in serious negative consequences for himself and his company.


We have drawn that conclusion on the basis of the high volume and the specific
types of deceptive behaviors exhibited by Sullivan during the course of the interview.


Conclusion


I think it's highly likely that the senior managers of Lumber Liquidators knew that they were
buying toxic, formaldehyde-drenched, non-CARB compliant laminate from their Chinese
suppliers, knowingly putting untold numbers of American families at risk - and now that
they're been caught red-handed, are desperately trying to cover it up.


Why would they do something so immoral and potentially destructive? The oldest reason
in the universe: greed. Laminate is one of the company's most profitable product lines and
non-CARB-compliant laminate is ~10% cheaper, so the company saved a lot of money on
sourcing costs (not a few pennies, as Sullivan claims), which I think was a major
contributor to a quick doubling of margins, which in turn helped send the stock price up
eight times from $15 to $119 in less than two years. Sullivan and Lynch recognized a
golden opportunity when they saw it, dumping $37 million worth of stock at prices more
than double today's level in early- to mid- 2013.


If they knew - and this information becomes public - the result could be not only an
implosion of the company but also big financial penalties and even criminal charges
against the company and its executives. Consequently, seen through management's lens,
their current strategy actually might be logical in a twisted sort of way: deny everything,
take advantage of the uncertainty about the testing methods and the harm formaldehyde
causes to muddy the waters as much as possible, bully critics and regulators, and hope
the storm passes.


I think this strategy is very unlikely to work, however, so this remains my largest short
position.

yes jus because a government says it is toxic does not make it a real hazard. 
using scary language like "knew that they were buying toxic, formaldehyde-drenched, non-CARB-compliant

the regulator.

If you believe Tilson's theory that the main reason for the company's margin expansion has been using cheaper
formaldehyde laden wood(which I personally don't think makes any sense) to make more money because they are so
greedy then let's do a little thought experiment.

Why not sell wood with no chemicals? These chemicals have to cost something right? Why not cut even more corners
and make more money by selling the wood without these extra chemicals tilson seems to be saying they are using.
Their margins would be even higher and they would make even more money.


08 Apr 2015, 03:55 PM


Shelby Cardozo, Contributor
simplevalue274,


"Why not sell wood with no chemicals?" What would hold the laminate wood pieces together?


08 Apr 2015, 04:00 PM


simplevalue274
So are you saying formaldehyde is what keeps wood together? Are you an expert in wood manufacturing?


I don't know, glue, paint, who cares tilson says all they care about is making money and cut as many corners
as possible. Then just put the wood in a box and ship it, who cares.


08 Apr 2015, 04:04 PM


Zueter
You don't need to be an 'expert' to know the glue is what contains formaldehyde in manufactured flooring. Or
to know that glue is what holds the wood fibers together in manufactured wood products.


This formaldehyde issue is the biggest unknown of $LL


08 Apr 2015, 04:10 PM


grinandBULLit
Zueter is right. The adhesive is the component that contains formaldehyde. I don't have the link handy, but
there are extensive industry trade group white papers that discuss the entire manufacturing process
thoroughly.


There is no question that they could source cheaper products by using non-complying laminate.


As Zueter said, the only issues are what the CPSC determines the levels of formaldehyde in LL's products
are. If they clear LL, then most other products will be fairly moot, with the exception of lost goodwill, public
perception, earnings, etc.


If not, then it will be a mess.

Hey simple, would that the world would be so. However your comment precludes any knowledge of "wood".
First of all, laminate is not wood. MDF is more akin to paper; 1/2 thick sheet of paper. The "wood" or pulp is
actually like fine sawdust. That is is the base material. It is nothing but choking pile of dust "with no
chemicals". Formaldehyde is one of the key ingredients in the binders (simply - glue) that hold the dust in a
sheet. It is a key ingredient in the cheapest binders. More expensive binders use less, or no formaldehyde. 
It isn't that simple, simple.

I have no clue who is guilty of what here, but I'm about to dispose of $1500 worth of flooring purchased from LL. We
bought bamboo flooring, which they won't take back because they claim it has been "discontinued" and it's my tough
luck. I didn't notice until is was too late that the boxes say "Made in China" on them.


Bamboo flooring is made with adhesives that bind bamboo strips together. I'm also reading rumors that the bamboo
flooring is suspect, and not just the cheap laminate. Probably nothing I can do to get my money back, but I guess I
should have known better. Should have just gone with a USA product and got it done right the first time.

test it for a reasonable price, I might just do that. In the end though, after all the things I've read about LL and
their products, I'm not sure I even want to bother installing the bamboo. I should have done more research in
the first place. If I had been more thorough, I would have never shopped there.

Maybe you should remove your oven, cabinets, wallpaper and any type of glue from your house
SteveTheHawk - you know since those contain formaldehyde as well. Better safe than sorry. You never know
... god forbid you take those kinds of risks.

SteveTheHawk
PRickels, 
I don't have to remove the bamboo flooring. It hasn't been installed yet. My quandary is whether or not to
install it. It would be a lot of work and I would feel even more ridiculous if I had to then turn around and take it
back out.

cashewking
I have bamboo flooring throughout a vacation home. I have no concern about it and don't believe there is any
problem unless you burn the flooring or damage it in a manner whereby the formaldehyde is released.  
I also have a problem why you would risk your company on a small percentage of your total sales on Chinese
laminate flooring? I think Tilson gets a bit self righteous and really don't like the idea of using that band wagon
for your own self interests.


09 Apr 2015, 10:21 AM


SteveTheHawk
cashewking, 
Thanks for your input. I'm not sure what to think about the safety of the particular bamboo flooring that we
purchased. I don't really know what Tilson's motivation is but he's not the only one that is raising this issue. At
the very least, it gives me a reason to reconsider installation of the flooring. It may be perfectly safe, but like I
said, I would be really annoyed if I had to tear it out after all the effort involved in installation. Still undecided.

Youre buying into the false hype. First the test kit isn't tested by LL it is done by a third party lab. I have LL
floors in my house (solid hardwood, not laminate) and there is no problem with them. If you get rid of the floor
based on Whitney...well then you might want to rethink that decision.

I haven't bought completely into anything yet. I'm simply uncertain as to whether to just landfill the whole pile

Can't believe they won't take it back. I assume they'll take back the suspect laminate, right?


I guess they have to draw the line somewhere or they're going to be inundated with returns, something I'd be
more worried about if I was a shareholder.

What "rumors" of bamboo flooring that are suspect are you referring to? Please post the links.


09 Apr 2015, 08:48 PM


SteveTheHawk
Hi Rip, 
Here's some links. Don't know how useful/accurate they are, but I have to now wonder.


http://bit.ly/1BBdNfA


This link below mentions that strand bamboo (which I think mine is) uses "phenolic resins" that "may or may
not contain formaldehyde". Again, don't know what to think.


The next link says it's not clear if "Morning Star bamboo" (the brand that they sold me) has the formaldehyde
problem.


http://bit.ly/1CAC7yx


Here's another. Nothing concrete, but again... enough to make me wonder.

What does LL say? According to their website bamboo is not part of the issue. Your links only refer to
installation issues, not formaldehyde.


09 Apr 2015, 09:16 PM


SteveTheHawk
LL says there is no problem with any of their flooring (of course), and I'm not positive that there is.


If you search through some of these web pages, there is a focus on defective wood, cracking, splitting and/or
install issues. But, here and there, they mention Morning Star bamboo and talk about excessive
formaldehyde.


I can't find a direct allegation that the bamboo I bought contains dangerous chemicals but I know that bamboo
flooring is made with adhesives, just like laminate is. So, I'm left to wonder if it's the same adhesive, etc.


I just received a communication from someone who is in the flooring business (but not with LL). They advise
that they are aware of some of the testing done and they feel the solid bamboo is not an issue and that the
laminate flooring is likely the bad actor here. Apparently, LL switched to a water based adhesive for the
flooring that I bought and testing revealed no elevated formaldehyde. So, I don't know. Guess I need to
reconsider whether or not I can proceed with the install.


09 Apr 2015, 09:49 PM


rlp2451
Does anyone have any results from any testing done here in the US by a consumer, third party, to justify any
of claims made by Tilson et.al.? So far all I've heard are rumors of rumors.

I would slow your roll with the bamboo. There is a whole lot less binder in real wood (or bamboo) than in
MDF; you might be OK. Maybe just store it in your basement and not react to rumor.

@rlp2451 Most flooring materials came from China, it's the buyer (US companies) responsibility to make sure
the suppliers follow the SOP and check the quality before they ship and you hold your supplier accountable if
things goes wrong. You don't find HD or Lowe's do this because you will be in a lot of trouble if you did.
Simple.


If you find so many products in LL case are falsely labeled, good chances are LL are at fault and the supplier
are just follow their order, now the CFO, CEO left the boat, wonder what come next. ;)

I don't know how it works on SeekingAlpha, maybe authors with highly-clicked articles get kickback, and Mr.

In this case, we can possibly help him out, by chipping in 25c each.. then he can close out his positions and

I thought we all knew the story. There are many small, 7 year old orphan girls in China who they give one
meal of rice a day to drench laminate planks with formaldehyde glue. The girls dip their tiny hands in
formaldehyde glue and smear it all over the laminate planks.


Tilson mentioned the Oscars....perhaps he's trying to give the performance of his lifetime to show off his

First and foremost, the title of the author's latest attack article is a loaded question, similar to "Has Mr. Tilson stopped
beating his wife yet?"


All the while grossly ignoring that government agencies had taken steps that disproved his fabricated/false thesis.


I don't want to spend too much time on responding this, partly b/c I want to spend more time thinking about how to
trade on the transient volatility that the author tirelessly and maliciously creates, but I do want to point out that Mr.
Tilson's personal attack on Mr. Ray Cotton is extremely distasteful.


Sure, Mr. Cotton didn't go to Harvard as Mr. Tilson did, and did not have the same successful career as Mr. Tilson
does (sarcastic). But I doubt that's the only gauge for Mr. Cotton's qualification. (He did have a Master's from Boston
U, but I imagine Mr. Tilson would still find that to be inferior to his alma mater).


I simply think it's wrong to post personal attack articles for Mr. Tilson trivial purpose of making himself a few bucks.

My suspicion is that Sears car batteries contain toxins (possibly lead and acid!). Worse - I'll bet Sears has known for
YEARS that it has been selling toxic batteries.


Mr. Tilson, please do us all a favor and personally do some destructive testing on some Sears car batteries. The
easiest way to detect sulfuric acid is to drink it and see if it causes indigestion. Eat the soft metallic stuff inside to see
if it causes any brain damage - although in your case nobody would probably notice.

The author seems a little desperate and his writing style is terrible and unprofessional. I recently bought laminate
flooring from another vendor, everyone makes and buys the same type of stuff. I am not going to chop it up into little
pieces and inhale it. Same stuff HD and everyone else sells? 
This whole thing is a joke and LL should start suing the people that made up this nonsense and those that continue
with the charade.


I would not be the least bit surprised to see HD or someone else buy this company for $60 a share, if they could get it
that cheap.


Anyone still short this stock is looking to get their head handed to them when this stock rockets higher on a buyout
offer. You can be sure that half a dozen other companies are looking at taking them out.

The story is no joke and product mislabeling with formaldehyde levels 20 times higher than a standard

The situation with high levels of formaldehyde from Chinese flooring is real. You can see my case here:

It does not involve floorboards purchased from Lumber Liberators product but it is flooring from China that
has high density fiberboard in the core.

08 Apr 2015, 04:51 PM


User 8193591
I wouldn't rip out your floor for 3 reasons:


First, there hasn't been proof that the floors exhibit high levels of formaldehyde, nor that they aren't compliant.
Raymond James just tested finished products and they passed: http://read.bi/1ItFeR2 
While they only tested two samples, I would take this as enough piece of mind to wait until the CPSC comes
out with their findings. If it passes you're safe, if it fails, you'll have more recourse to get paid financial
compensation.


Tilson did a test that's just a screening test, it does not say anything of whether or not the product is compliant
or not. Benchmark (who did some of the tests for Tilson) stated this: http://bit.ly/1Fsugca 
To get the results on compliance you'd need to test the core before it was made into a laminate product. Once
you've made a laminate board, you cannot accurately test the core. The question will be does LL have
documentation that the cores used are compliant... and I'm sure CARB is asking for it, so we'll hear if they
don't have it.


Lastly, speaking of CARB, they have advised that you do not rip out the floor and give ways to reduce
formaldehyde in your home if you are concerned: http://bit.ly/1wJZEBi


I don't to see anyone else needlessly be harmed financially by this fiasco. Save your receipts, if this does go
south for LL you'll be able to get your floor replaced. If LL is right (and I'm leaning that way based on the
articles I've seen not written by Tilson), you'll never get that money back (and you would have spent it to
replace a floor that is, indeed safe).


08 Apr 2015, 05:17 PM


Zueter
From Mr. Tilson directly: 
"exposure to the levels of formaldehyde shown in the tests done by 60 Minutes, myself and others is unlikely
to cause cancer."


Based on my reading, it is REALLY unlikely to cause cancer. Irritated throat is the only real risk at these
levels. And that is only for people who are especially sensitive to it.

One word: Lululemon. (LULU)


What were the accusations again?


Oh yeah:


Lululemon Athletica won dismissal of claims that shareholders lost $2 billion because the athletic-wear company
misled them about quality problems with its products, including bleeding colors and see-through yoga pants.


U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan today dismissed shareholder claims against the Vancouver-based
company, founder and director Dennis Wilson and former chief executive officer Christine McCormick Day. Forrest
ruled the investors failed to show that statements made by company officials about product quality were false and
misleading.


The investors claimed Lululemon had poor quality control, including the failure to test its products on live models,
resulting in the March 2013 recall of it black luon yoga pants in response to consumer complaints that the material
was too sheer and would become see-through when the wearers bent over.


“Boiled down to a summary version, lead plaintiff alleges that if only Lululemon had someone try on its black luon
yoga pants before they shipped, it would have realized they were sheer,” Forrest said in an opinion today. “Similarly, if
Lululemon had only had someone exercise in certain athletic wear (enough to produce sweat), it would have realized
that the colors bled.”


Forrest rejected the investors’ claims that Lululemon misled them with statements claiming its products were high
quality and that it was taking steps to fix the problems with its products. She said the investor claims pointed to “at
most, corporate mismanagement,” not securities fraud. 
--------------


Funny thing...your accusation...if true...would be corporate mismanagement.


And this $2 BILLION dollar lawsuit was DISMISSED.


08 Apr 2015, 04:59 PM


David G.
Let me add something here. LULU's founder was a speaker worse than LL's founder. And they still prevailed
in the public eye. Where did the stock drop to? Where is it today?


LL's founder basically said LL will sell what the public wants. Not nearly as damning.


"Lululemon founder Chip Wilson — who famously blamed the company’s quality-control issues on women’s
thighs — stepped down as chairman today. The company has also announced a successor to CEO Christine
Day, who resigned amid Lululemon’s recall of defective yoga pants last spring. Day will be replaced by
Laurent Potdevin, who was most recently president of Toms Shoes, and Wilson will have a seat on the board.

After the pants were pulled from the shelves early this year for quickly becoming sheer and pilled, Wilson told
Bloomberg News the product just didn’t work for some women’s bodies.


Reporter: So the pants might be see-through on some women's bodies, but not on others? 
Chip: No, no. Because even our small sizes would fit an extra-large. It's more about the rubbing through the
thighs, and how much you're using it. 
Despite his subsequent, sad, non-apology video, analysts say Wilson alienated some core customers, like
size-eights. It's less about the defective pants and more about his bald head, and how little he was using it." 
---------------


LL's so called "crimes" are less than LULU's and far harder to prove. LL did its own independent testing on
laminates by sending it out to third party labs. You can't really prove intent if they are going by what third party
labs tell them.


If I have my water tested and an independent lab says no arsenic and then 60 minutes comes by and says I
have arsenic in my water, how exactly are you going to prove I'm purposely, knowingly, poisoning my family
with arsenic from my water supply? Why would I doubt a third independent party to lie?

On March 12, 2015 in your article "A Response To Lumber Liquidators" you said


"Going forward, I'm going to lower my public profile and allocate my time elsewhere as: 1) I've now shared publicly my
facts and resulting conclusions; and 2) It's not about me (or 60 Minutes or anyone else) vs. the company. It's about
the company's actions, what harm might have resulted, and what the consequences will be. With numerous state and
federal authorities as well as various law firms pursuing this vigorously, I'm confident that the truth will be out, so I'm

I contend that Lumber Liquidators management did know very well what they were doing.


The following:  
"The lawsuit was filed after an investigative blog commissioned a report on samples of the wood used in Lumber
Liquidators flooring. The toxin levels in the sample were reported to be more than three times the U.S. legal limit. The
suit then claims that the company’s response to the report was to lower the price of the flooring and unload the stock
in a sale."

You use the words "DRENCHED" "OSCARS" and "EX-CIA GUYS" to make points?


You aren't Mulder from the X-files.


Your article published at 3:03pm.  
Market closed at 4pm.


LL traded at $33.85 at 3:03pm, rose to a high of 34.33 and closed at 34.19.


So, a pretty ineffective article. Eh?


Raymond James financial services could tell its clients to buy, sell, avoid, short LL. They don't really care how they
make money on the stock. Raymond did their own testing on LL's China laminates, and LL passed. So they raised
their price target and rating. Is Raymond James being evil to their clients? That doesn't seem to make any sense.
Does it?

why would LL act like this on what only represents 10 to 15% in total sells? if they would do this, then they would be
also involved in poachers from Brazil and elsewhere cutting rain forest trees and making a killing on the wood they
sell etc.


Mr Whitney is in a lot of legal trouble if LL gets cleared by the Gov. Specially knowing he made money on his leaked

Who was that guy that said a thing of beauty is a joy forever? I guess the laminate floors and vinyl and aluminum
siding crowd would laugh in his face.


And on top of it all, the laminate floors sold by Lumber Liquidators might be toxic.

The Mayor
I just bought laminate flooring and to be perfectly honest, it looks better than the solid oak floors in my
previous house. It was a little more than carpet and looks great! 
I am quite certain that most of the people posting here have never been in a LL like I have. The one near my
home is busy and business is "better than ever" according the one of the managers. It seems that all the free
LL publicity and now radio adds has raised awareness of the brand.


If you want to make money, buy the long dated options, this will surely double by the end of the year or
sooner if the buyout rumors are true.

To add to the Mayor's point, presuming by his avatar that the Mayor has a dog, laminate is more scratch
resistant than hardwood and thus is better for people with larger four legged friends: http://bit.ly/1Cz9p0U


Also, I worked in some focus groups that looked at solid surface floors (hardwood, bamboo, laminate), which
is why I find this story interesting, and most people could not tell the difference between laminate and
hardwood, despite the fact that most people said they could easily tell, and would never put in laminate.


I love wood floors, I have them in my house. But I really think it's a vanity thing. Good laminate floors are a
great, durable, attractive product, but because it's synthetic, people treat it as cheap.


Laminate is a solid segment for LL, I think it's 20% of the business. I'm certain it fills a niche for their
customers. Makes sense that they would defend it rigorously if they know it's safe. In the long run if they're
right their confidence in themselves should benefit the company. Obviously if they're wrong it'll be devastating,
big risk big reward.

I'm reading about the "evil" Ray Cotton from his linkedin.


He was a Big Brother for United Way to children. The causes he cares about are animal welfare and children. One of
his mentors is Obama. He supports St Judes Hospital, Action for Children and ASPCA (American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) . He is Wilderness First Responder certified (The Wilderness First Responder
program is the ideal medical training for leaders in remote areas including outdoor educators, guides, military,
professional search and rescue teams, researchers, and those involved in disaster relief.)


He went to the FBI Compliance Academy.


So your argument is that this guy who looks up to Obama who believes in child and animal welfare/health, and
against cancers (St Judes), and FBI compliance with the law and trained to save people in disasters, has looked
away/ignored/disregard... conspired and enabled LL's Chinese suppliers to put out toxic, dangerous, cancerous
flooring to the company he works for?


Because in your opinion, he wants children, and animals....to receive and die from cancer?


Don't his interests, lifestyle, past endeavors and volunteer work, say exactly the opposite?


It seems a bit odd that he would conspire to protect the things (chinese laminate) from the things he cares about the
most (children and animals).


In fact, from your own admission, he jets from job to job to job. It seems to me that if LL were doing something against
his interest in child health and welfare and animal welfare, he would resign his position and go elsewhere. Especially
since he hasn't a problem leaving jobs from his past.


Instead I have to look at a page of him you captured doing security at the Oscars because of some off the wall
conspiracy theory of yours? There is research and there is stalking. Figure out which activity you are engaged in.

I think it is beneath you and any other investor to personally attack a member of management's in the way you are
currently doing. I wish you the best with your short position, but at this time it appears that the regulators are
adequately involved and there doesn't appear to be a need to raise awareness to your central thesis, let alone
personally attack people.


I am reminded of a phrase from Buffett, "Praise by name and criticize in general."


My reply:


Normally I wouldn't, but he's the head of compliance at a company that's been accused of extremely serious
compliance violations so I think it's appropriate to examine him carefully. And he is so massively unqualified for the job
and his web site and Twitter feed so bizarre and inappropriate that I stand by my decision to bring all this to light. This
-- and the fact that he's STILL on the job -- speaks volumes...

So Mr. Tilson's beef with Mr. Cotton was that he got invited to the Oscar red carpet *and* didn't go to a *good*
university for undergrad (even though he did later got a Master's from a decent school), hence he's not
qualified for his job.


He provided nothing related to his work to support the attack.


Since Mr. Tilson doesn't read this, we can only wonder to ourselves the wellness of his mental being, since
low-blows like these only serves to undermine his credibility, and hurt his own dubious agenda (evil?) of stock
manipulation. (along with all the attack articles).

I completely agree with your views on LL. However, I'm still not sold on keeping a short position at this time. Some
thoughts:


I'm not sure being mislead by false labelling from suppliers is a crime. If LL actions are pure, then they are a victim
too. Proving that LL knew or ought to have known that their wood was mislabelled is a higher hurdle to clear. I'm not
sure any government agency will go after LL hard enough to cripple the company without hard evidence of fraud.


Formaldehyde constantly outgases, hence the reason it is dangerous in wood flooring. However, you could take a
case of flooring and just let it sit there and overtime it will out gas until it would pass Carb2 testing. Every day that
passes it lowers the possibility that testing will reveal high levels of formaldehyde in LL's products assuming LL quit
importing non-Carb2 flooring after the 60 Minutes story.


I can see LL taking the position that all of their products are safe and then promote their new testing facility as being
the best in the world and even raise questions about other retailers' flooring. As much as I don't like the company, I
can see them spinning this to their advantage.


My reply:


I agree that if LL was misled by its suppliers (and it wasn’t willfully ignorant or reckless), then this would knock out an
important pillar of my short thesis, as I acknowledged in my article this afternoon. However, for the six reasons I
detailed in my article, I think it’s 90% likely that senior executives knew – and when this becomes public, as I think it
will, it will be devastating to the company (and the stock).


To your second point about off-gassing, I’ve already drafted and will soon publish another article addressing this (as
well as other topics related to formaldehyde), but in short, you are correct: once flooring is unwrapped (and
presumably installed), even dangerous levels of formaldehyde such as those shown in the tests done by 60 Minutes,
myself and others will off-gas down to safe levels in 3-6 months according to Dr. Philip Landrigan (the expert who was
in the 60 Minutes story).


This is all great news for Lumber Liquidators and its customers and installers who have been exposed to its toxic
laminate – but it doesn’t mean the company is off the hook. Many, many people – perhaps tens of thousands, maybe
more – have likely still been harmed, suffering all sorts of awful things like (according to the National Cancer Institute
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) “watery eyes; burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat;
coughing; wheezing; nausea; and skin irritation,” “upper respiratory tract irritation [that] can potentially exacerbate
asthma symptoms and other respiratory illnesses,” “chronic runny nose, chronic bronchitis, and obstructive lung
disease.” I think our judges and juries are likely to award high damages to people who’ve suffered these things,
especially if it comes to light that Lumber Liquidators knowingly (or even recklessly) exposed them.

Also where'd you get the 90%-sure metric from in reference to your " I think it’s 90% likely that senior

That is the main problem. Tilson seems to have some name recognition. But when you point out his
horrendous track record on SA of hyperbolic posts they get deleted. A lot of people are new to SA and read
his articles and say, wow look this experienced investor really knows what he is talking about.


I debated this pt w a SA editor over SA email. They disagree they say it doesn't matter how bad the author's

Let me start by saying that I made a 500% return in 6 trading days buying puts on LL after the 60 Minutes Report. I no
longer have a position, but still feel the stock will gradually go lower over time. What all you people are not getting is
that a stock trades on valuation. With margins contracting fast, for multiple reasons, the P/E will rise and the stock
price will fall. There reputation has suffered substantially, because most people that heard about this story will not
install this in there home. There are many options out there for flooring, and LL is not as cheap as people think. You
can get better flooring at Home Depot for less money.

protecting him in a manner not enjoyed by other authors. This is just my opinion, of course.  
If anyone were to call Mr. Tilson "evil", I would imagine that the comment would be deleted.  
Mr. Tilson can, however, call Lumber Liquidators "evil" and did so in an article title.

Some years ago, I negotiated to buy a truckful load of controllers from Chinese electronics manufacturers to use in-
house computer and resell half of the parts imported, instead of buying from quality manufacturers like Adaptec and
Boca. After evaluating 100 sample controllers from the Chinese manufacturers, the controllers were turned out to be
in high quality finish with very little defects, so we took a delivery of second 1000 sample controllers which also turned
out to be as good as first 100 samples. A month later, I gave a huge order of 30,000 controllers, but upon receiving
30,000 controllers, the controllers kept failing with very high rate, it failed more than 40%. When I contacted them
about the high failure rates, their reply was the “price quoted justified the board failures”, matter of fact they did not do
any quality control before the shipment. This was the mindset of Chinese manufacturers and businessmen a while
ago and it hasn’t changed even after decade of doing business with west. All they are looking for is short term profit
and there is no foresight in building long term business relationship. It only exists when drinking a cup of Chinese tea
together before and after the deal is signed.


Based on my own experiences dealing with them, I would blame 90% to Chinese manufacturer and 10% to LL
management. The LL management should have known about it long before it blew up on their face. Knowingly or
unknowingly, LL management is ultimately responsible for the product defects and the management is a willing
participant in this case.

Author’s reply »  Justin asks:


Regarding LL, even if they did sell contaminated laminate and they knew what they were doing, this does not
necessarily doom a disaster for the company. It takes 20-30 years for cancer to come from the exposure to
formaldehyde and even then there is no way (or very difficult) to prove the cancer was a result of the high levels of
formaldehyde. My question for you is what is the potential damages to the company assuming a guilty verdict from the
majority of the executives? I'm assuming a full refund on the laminate and a demo/re-installation credit, not much pain
& suffering though.

Hi Justin,


I’ve already drafted and will soon publish another article addressing this (as well as other topics related to

This is pathetic. There WERE more than 80 comments posted on this article yet somehow SA removed nearly every
bullish comment. I guess that is American-style democracy in action.


At this point the only facts that matter are the following: 
1) The formaldehyde levels are only high if the flooring is ripped down to the core. 
2) Destroying the floors is not normal use nor exposure. 
3) CARB does not require destructive testing and have already explained this on their web site.


I could go on to argue that CARB only has jurisdiction in California and the EPA does not regulate formaldehyde
levels in flooring, but given the above three facts that point is moot.


The analogy that doduhdew makes regarding gasoline could be tweaked to better fit this situation:


CARB requires that automakers not allow the fuel vapors outside of the vehicle to exceed a certain level, so Tilson
removes the gas cap, dunks the vapor sensor into the tank and screams, "SHORT GM! THEIR VEHICLES EXCEED
EMISSION LEVELS!!"


Not normal use nor exposure.


IMO Lumber Liquidators has standing to sue Tilson for libel, especially when he makes such hyperbolic statements in
his conclusion.


DISCLOSURES: 
- I do NOT work for LL. 
- I have never bought any flooring from LL, although I would have no problem doing so if we needed new flooring.

LL definitely knew about the formaldehyde. We had a nightmare experience purchasing flooring from them. They sold
us Morningstar Bamboo, made in China. It was one of the few products they actually had in stock--lots of it. And the
glued-shut boxes were all sealed in plastic--the only product they'd sealed in plastic. They told us to remove the
plastic at home to acclimate it. We removed it and immediately a powerful formaldehyde odor permeated the house.
We had to take it outside because our throats were burning. When we returned it and told of the formaldehyde smell
(remember frog dissection day in h.s. biology? that's the smell), they exchanged glances that made it so clear that
they knew exactly what was up. They also scolded us for removing the plastic overwrap (even though their associate
had told us to). We then realized why the store itself puts plastic on the product--it's to keep the workers from suffering
the ill effects. If you look online the complaints about the toxins go back for years. Thousands of complaints about
formaldehyde--so how on earth could they NOT have known? It's a ridiculous idea. This company is all about the
bottom line, consumer health be damned. Pretty crappy product, on top of it. I blame HGTV--all those free floors LL
installs (as an easy ad) makes the homeowners watching believe it's a decent product. WRONG. The floors are toxic,
and the company is, yes, evil.

It's so nice in the online world you can post anything you want. -like claiming you bought wood from LL and you had
this terrible experience. Sorry I don't believe you. Just another short troll

"3) Lumber Liquidators' behavior. Since the 60 Minutes story broke, the company has, in my opinion, acted exactly as
I'd expect a guilty company, not an honest and reputable one, to act. "


Mr. Tilson you are trying to point the possible reasons for the Lumber Liquidators' behavior but you fail to see the most
obvious one - an honest and reputable company that has not violated any laws and is confident about the safety of
their products will behave exactly as Lumber Liquidators are behaving under your attacks.

"Did Lumber Liquidators Know It Was Selling Toxic Laminate?"


The title sounds like it came from the Nancy Grace show. Whitey should hit up CNN for a job if Nancy ever
gets fired. Both Nancy and Whitey know when someone's guilty just by the way he talks in TV interviews.
