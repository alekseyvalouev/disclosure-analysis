China Integrated Energy (OTCPK:CBEH) is another Chinese RTO company that
has come under fire. The company recently reported 2010 vs. 2009 fourth
quarter EPS of $0.38 vs. $0.30, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.34.


We were recently turned off by the CBEH story when the company raised
money at insanely cheap valuations, despite having a "healthy" cash balance: 


CBEH raises funds


“ "XI'AN, China, Dec. 29, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia-FirstCall/ -- ChinaIntegrated Energy, Inc. today announced that it has entered into
definitive agreements with several institutional investors for a registered
direct placement of approximately $15.3 million of common stock at a
price of $7.00 per share. The Company will issue a total of 2,185,716
shares to the institutional investors.


“ In addition, the Company will issue to the investors warrants to purchaseup to 1,092,858 shares of common stock, which, if fully exercised, would
provide an additional $7.65 million in gross proceeds to the Company.
The warrants have an exercise price of $7.00 per share and are
exercisable for six months following the closing date.


“ The Company anticipates that the capital raised in this registered directplacement will be used for biodiesel capacity expansion and working
capital for wholesale distribution of finished oil and heavy oil products.


GeoTeam® Note: What can we really say? Why offer stock?


Cash balance of $79.7 million.

Analyst estimates indicate that 2011 EPS will grow 28.5% to $1.85.
Just appointed KPMG as auditor.


The company should let these positive developments play out before issuing
stock at an absurd PEG ratio of 0.22. Dilution will only be 8%, assuming
conversion of IN THE MONEY warrants. At least the this may end the overhang
that this development was possibly having on CBEH's stock price."


In our recent blog note, we had originally commented that:


The company had just finished working off past dilution. A new round of
shares will once again hamper EPS growth in 2011. (We should note that
EPS estimates have been raised to where now the street expects CBEH
2011 EPS to grow to $1.62 from $1.28. Previous 2011 estimates stood at
$1.42)
We believe CBEH has left the door open for another capital raise since its
10K states that it will have sufficient working capital to sustain its current
business for the next 12 months, as opposed to commenting that it has
capital to expand past current business goals.


On March 16, 2011 we issued an alert that we went short CBEH around
$5.00, inspired by a convincing hit piece.
