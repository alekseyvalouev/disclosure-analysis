PGWC: Another Use of The


NASDAQ Brand In The PGWC


Promotion


On August 3, 2006 Pegasus Wireless Corporation (NASDAQ:


PGWC, $5.76) announced the company’s use of


MetricStream Software (Click Here to Read PGWC:


MetricStream Does Not Address PGWC’s Compliance Woes).


PGWC’s President and newly appointed “Co-CEO” Jasper


Knabb, stated “Due to their strategic alliance with the


NASDAQ, we selected MetricStream’s software solutions and


ComplianceOnline.com as the foundation for all of our


compliance initiatives.” ComplianceOnline.com is


MetricStream’s website subsidiary.


It seems clear that the announcement of PGWC’s use of


MetricStream was nothing more than a thinly veiled method


of invoking the NASDAQ name in PGWC’s stock promotion.


The latest use of the NASDAQ name in PGWC’s promotion


comes after the NASDAQ su�ered the embarrassment of


having such a questionable company ring the NASDAQ’s


opening bell on July 21st, 2006, and after PGWC’s President


and “Co-CEO” was featured on the NASDAQ website in a


NASDAQ CEO Signature Series interview.


As for the “strategic alliance” between MetricStream and the


NASDAQ, it turns out to be nothing more than a discount
