Star Scientific: A Tobacco Stock Buoyed by Dubious Forecasts

* Editor's Note: This story is the first in a two-part investigative series, with the second
article scheduled to run after the Fourth of July holiday.


Over the years, regulatory filings show, Star Scientific (CIGX) has often changed its pretty
story -- with the former cigarette maker now spinning tobacco as the key to breakthrough
medical cures – but the company has rarely changed its ugly numbers.


Star posted its highest revenue as a discount cigarette maker more than a decade ago,
records show, and has generated dismal sales (and absolutely no profits) ever since
shedding that traditional tobacco business. Last year, for example, Star posted total
revenue of just $848,000 – or less than 1% of the $223 million in record 2000 sales it
achieved as a profitable cigarette company – while recording an annual loss (a number
that keeps growing) for the eighth straight year in a row.


Star nevertheless boasts a market value of almost $600 million, some 35% higher than its
peak market value during the year the company achieved its strongest financial results on
record, and currently trades at an astounding 720 times its prior-year sales. If investors
assigned Star the same multiple now as they did back then, the company would sport a
market value of just $1.68 million – with its $4.50 stock fetching barely a penny a share –
instead.


For years, corporate filings reveal, Star has enjoyed far more success selling its story (and
the stock it keeps issuing in order to stay afloat) than it has at actually selling its unpopular
products. Star executed the latest in a series of private placements during the first quarter
of this year, with enough warrants and stock options now outstanding – at average
exercise prices of around $2 a share – to increase the company's swelling share count,

which totaled less than 60 million back in 2000, by another 33% to almost 180 million
shares. The restrictions on the last of that cheap stock should expire this September,
records indicate, with the shares facing a potential slide toward $3 unless the company's
handsome market value further expands to absorb that looming dilution hit.


Of course, that price assumes that investors continue to value Star based on its ambitious
plans and keep ignoring the company's miserable results. Without the speculative hype
provided by its long-shot dreams, which alternate between beating Big Tobacco for
massive damage awards and beating Big Pharma for blockbuster miracle cures, Star
would arguably lose all of the appeal that makes it one of the most active (and volatile)
small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange.


Take a look at the company's latest quarterly results, just for starters. Star posted total
revenue of $156,000 during the first quarter, corporate filings show, with dwindling sales of
its most-established product – tobacco-based "Hard Snuff" lozenges now competing with
well-branded rivals – plummeting 26% to $110,000 "due to higher returned goods and
promotion costs." Star generated the rest of its meager revenue from its newer CigRx
offering, a nutritional supplement designed to curb nicotine cravings, but that product –
introduced a full year earlier – still mustered less than half the revenue posted by the
company's shrinking hard snuff business despite the celebrated launch of a national
marketing campaign.


Nevertheless, one of the most vocal stock promoters touting Star these days recently
portrayed CigRx as a looming blockbuster hit.


"Its market potential is staggering, and its eminent regional and national rollout gets closer
by the day," declared John Faessel, a longtime company bull who previously touted NXT
Nutritionals (OTCPK:NXTH) – a dubious microcap company exposed by
TheStreetSweeper before it later collapsed – in two "research reports" published by a
promotional website that caters to the penny-stock crowd. "Star and inVentive Health (the
company's big marketing partner) are preparing for a major push with new, state-of-the-art
call centers to handle the volume of sales that they anticipate.


"So you get the picture: inVentive Health has the muscle and know-how, sees a big – if not
huge – revenue stream and has the money to push CigRx out to a nationwide public …
Therein lies the moon-shoot potential."


Star launched that national roll-out a full month before the first quarter came to an end,
however, and still sold only $46,000 worth of CigRx – while losing $1.41 million on the
product -- during that three-month period. Nevertheless, even after Star released those

figures, Faessel began suggesting that CigRx could soon achieve annual sales of $100
million and eventually see that number explode to $800 million down the road. He pegged
the value of Star's stock at $6 using the first sales figure and at $40 to $60 using the
second.


That math, while intended to dazzle investors with explosive growth projections, actually
illustrates the huge distortion already present in Star's current share price. According to an
equation set forth by one of Star's most relentless bulls, sales of CigRx need to skyrocket
from a current run-rate of about $200,000 to $100 million – or roughly 50,000% -- in order
to justify a stock price that's just $1.50 above present levels.


In other words, that math suggests, Star should already be selling $75 million worth of
CigRx a year to warrant the stock price it currently enjoys. But for now, that math
indicates, current sales of CigRx warrant a stock price of just one penny – about the same
price rendered when assigning past valuation multiples to the company – instead.


This exercise clearly underscores an obvious point. With current sales of Star's hard snuff
actually fading and explosive sales of CigRx largely baked into its share price already,
investors are not buying the stock based on high hopes for the company's unpopular
products. Rather, they are counting on jackpot-size payouts – measured in the billions –
from a couple of apparent long-shot gambles regularly hyped by the enthusiastic bulls who
keep touting the company's speculative shares.


Star failed to respond to requests by TheStreetSweeper seeking input for this story.


Up in Smoke


For the past decade, filings show, Star has been pursuing massive damages against
tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds (NYSE:RAI) for allegedly infringing on its patented curing
process for reducing the deadly toxins in tobacco to create less harmful cigarettes.


Star has already suffered major setbacks in the case, records show, with both a federal
judge and a federal jury ruling against the company – by declaring that its "invention" was
not new – and siding with RJR instead. The company's stock plummeted below $1 after
each of those decisions, records show, but staged a big comeback when the U.S. Patent
& Trademark Office (PTO) took the opposite stand by confirming the validity of those
contested patents earlier this year.


The stock, which fetched less than $2 when select investors (including Star CEO Jonnie
Williams) purchased millions of shares through a private placement the week before that
ruling, rocketed toward $4 within days of that favorable development. Lifted by escalating

https://seekingalpha.com/article/277425-star-scientific-a-tobacco-stock-buoyed-by-dubious-forecasts 4/19


hopes for long-sought damages, combined with powerful hype about the company's
pursuit of tobacco-based medical breakthroughs, the stock continued to rally in the weeks
that followed and ultimately broke past $5 this April for the first time in years. With the
stock finally closing above the crucial $5 mark in late May, records indicate, Star
executives are now free to exercise millions of cheap stock options granted under new
employment agreements – signed days after the favorable PTO decision – that linked fully
half of those awards to a single-day closing price of $5 or more.


Meanwhile, despite the celebrated PTO ruling, Star still faces the inherently daunting
challenge of reversing earlier decisions through the courtroom-appeals process. For its
part, corporate filings show, RJR has portrayed the PTO ruling as an irrelevant
development in a distinctly separate case.


"For several reasons," the tobacco giant stated in its latest quarterly report, "RJR Tobacco
believes that the PTO's re-examination decision – which is not binding on the Federal
Circuit – should not materially affect the Federal Circuit's review of the district court's final
judgment, because the jury found non-infringement in any case and invalidity in RJR
Tobacco's favor on grounds not considered by the PTO."


In fairness, like any party embroiled in a legal war, RJR likely holds a biased view favoring
its own shot at victory. At the same time, however, Star General Counsel Robert Pokusa –
the insider arguably best equipped to weigh the company's chances in the case – has sent
some potentially negative signals to the market in recent months as well.


In late March, with Star climbing above $4 on the favorable PTO ruling four weeks earlier,
Pokusa executed the first insider sale by a company executive in years. He exercised
50,000 options set to expire, filings show, and then sold the underlying stock at $3.66 a
share (a price well below the reported low for the day) instead of holding onto it for
potentially bigger gains on down the road. Two months after that, records show, Pokusa
followed up by selling twice as much stock – this time cashing in options expiring a full
year later – as the stock raced toward a new multi-year high before losing some of its
steam once again.


Pokusa exercised almost one-third of his stock options through those two transactions,
records indicate, and directly owns just 1,200 shares in the company (or less than 1% of
the total number he sold) at the present time.


Pokusa can still score a big windfall if Star actually manages to beat the formidable RJR
down the road, corporate filings indicate, since the company has promised a portion of
any damages it receives in exchange for a cap on related legal fees. By cashing in a big

chunk of his stock options (exercised at prices roughly 60% to 75% below the prices that
he received) in the meantime, however, Pokusa has also scaled back his exposure to any
looming courtroom setbacks like those that have decimated the shares – and seemed to
threaten the very survival of the company – over the course of the past few years.


Down to Dreams?


If Star weathers yet another devastating blow in that legal war, as bearish investors have
widely come to expect, then the company could need to pull off nothing short of a miracle
– besting Big Pharma with an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease – in order to
support, and ultimately boost, its current share price.


Four years ago, with the company's stock hammered below $1 on its original courtroom
defeat, Star suddenly announced plans to expand into the biotech arena by seeking
potential tobacco-based treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Star abandoned the discount
cigarette business – the past source of most of its revenue and all of its profits – that same
year, records show, leaving the company almost entirely dependent upon proceeds from
stock sales to address its constant need for cash.


Star won a surprising legal victory in the meantime, records show, when it convinced an
appeals court to return its case back to the lower court for further review that would
include an actual jury trial. With its shot at a huge damage award seemingly revived,
records show, Star resumed its status as a hot litigation stock – its biotech story now
fading into the background – until a jury, like the federal judge before it, ruled against the
company in mid-2009.


After spending the rest of that year in survival mode, its stock spiraling well below $1 a
share, Star once again embraced biotech as a key focus for the company. Star soon won
over a growing crowd of bulls, records show, with even a former contributor to
TheStreet.com – James Altucher – trumpeting the company's chances of proving that a
tobacco-based "nutraceutical" could effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. In April of 2010,
just one day after Star announced that a research institute would begin testing the
compound (later identified as anatabine), Altucher boldly predicted that the company could
introduce a new Alzheimer's treatment within a few months and see its stock rapidly
skyrocket to $15 or $20 a share as a result.


When almost a year passed without that potential cure and Altucher returned with an even
bolder forecast – this one carrying a headline suggesting that Star had already cured
Alzheimer's disease – he sparked a strong rebuttal from a former colleague widely viewed
as the best financial journalist covering the biotech space.

"He knows full well there is no scientific evidence yet to back up a claim that anatabine
cures Alzheimer's," Adam Feurestein, a veteran columnist for TheStreet.com, declared.
"His column, despite the enticing headline, doesn't offer any proof, either…


"It's highly unlikely that any nutraceutical or nutritional supplement, including anatabine, is
going to be selective enough to cure a disease like Alzheimer's," Feurestein continued. "I
know some people swear by the efficacy of nutraceuticals, but I'm not one of them. I prefer
a bit more scientific rigor with my medical claims."


That science costs plenty, of course, with the pharmaceutical industry often spending
billions pursuing miracle cures that they sometimes fail to find. Meanwhile, corporate
filings show, Star itself spent just $650,000 on research and development during its most
recent quarter -- or roughly half the modest sum it spent the previous year -- even as it
further bolstered its public image as a viable biotech company within reach of a possible
Alzheimer's cure.


In a damaging report earlier this month, however, New York hedge fund manager Martin
Shkreli proclaimed that at least three drug companies have already conducted clinical
trials of similar tobacco-based agents and found no evidence supporting their use as
effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. He expressed serious doubts that Star, with
its "lack of success" in the nutraceuticals field and its "complete lack of experience" in the
pharmaceuticals space, could somehow manage to succeed where more established
health-related companies had already failed.


His firm placed a bet against the company by shorting its heavily promoted stock, pegging
the true value of Star – including its shrinking hard snuff business, its unpopular CigRx
offering, its potentially long-shot legal awards and its proposed treatment for Alzheimer's
disease – at well below $1 a share.


"What will make the stock go down?" Shkreli mused at the time. "I don't know … (But) I'm
not so concerned with when it will happen, as I'm pretty sure it will."

Nice piece, and I can't wait to see the follow-up.


I looked briefly at the YAHOO message board for signs of intelligent life forms. Instead I came away with the
conclusion that CIGX is the worst electronic boiler room promoted stock I have ever seen.

I can't say you will find many signs of life on the Yahoo message board anyway. Your brief look is hardly
adequate due diligence given the extreme conclusions you draw(worst...). And how about helping us out with
more than your "recall" as to the legal/fraud allegations you make. Too strong of stuff for us to rely on your

appreciated.

You write "As a matter of policy, Melissa Davis – the editor of TheStreetSweeper and the author of this story – never
takes a financial position in any of the stocks that she covers." Since you work for an organization that does take large
positions in the stocks you write about, are you compensated in any way based on the movement of the stock? Just
wondering? It would be a shame if you didn't benefit from all your hard work.

Hello Mr. Beck.


Having spent a long time on a 16000 character reply to your comment below Faessel's piece earlier today, I only have
time for brief observations here ... for now.


Regarding your "I looked briefly at the YAHOO message board for signs of intelligent life forms."


I regret to be forced to remind you of the old saying: "It takes one to know one."


I don't know if the cute-but-dumb little "attack people" there in recent days (all of 2 or 3) are your employees or your
aliases, but I suspect that, in the unlikely event you would indeed qualify to be able to spot "intelligent life", you must
have spent too much of your time there "reading your own (their) press".


I love your "Melissa" quoting RJR press releases when, to make any statement about the momentary subject on her
own,she would be forced to say something neutral or flattering about Star.

I also love the device of taking events out of chronological order because telling them serially would benefit Star.


I like how there was no mention of the actual big story for Star, and THE driver of the stock's price now ... the
PROVEN fact of the recent discovery that anatabine is a very effective, nearly-side-effect-free anti-inflammatory.


I like how there was no mention that clinical trials are ongoing in "the Flint study" that will showcase what is already
known ... that this substance helps a very wide variety of inappropriate inflammatory responses, and that it is already
known to be safe enough so that it may be taken daily so as to continue to receive that benefit indefinitely, for arthritis
for example. It is actually better targeted than aspirin and other NSAIDS ... AND safer. It even improves mood
(because of its safe but effective MAOI property).


I do REALLY love the quote of Martin Shkreli, self-proclaimed investment boy-wonder (who, I learned, does not like to
be called "Marty" ; ) who became so frustrated from being confronted with intelligent (you, of course, will have to take
my word on that) replies to the piece that "Melissa" cited ... his own attempted hatchet job ... that he finally turned that
instrument back on himself and took the column down! GOOD SHOW, MARTY!


Most of all I am thoroughly enjoying the net results of what was billed as a coordinated all-out attack on the stock ...
the lies (several points of misrepresentations of the facts of the initial marketing and a "national rollout" of CigRx, the
latter which has not yet occurred, by the way, Milissa), distortions of time and fact, omissions of fact, and all ... for the
sole purpose of lowering its value to your monetary advantage. The stock is slightly down on a low volume day.


I will allow this: I do not, nor do all of the stock's investors, endorse the hyperbole of Mr. Altucher ... and I'd bet you'd
have to admit that you've seen me calling him and others on the use of the word "cure" in conjunction with the
company's, and the Roskamp research center's hope that anatabine will offer some degree, any degree, of aid in
Alzheimer's (which is NOT, by the way, "priced into" the stock ... few if any are "counting" on that). I am most
interested in "what is" and what seems realistically possible at any moment, in the light of known facts.


"Cure" for Alzheimer's is not anywhere close at this time ... the "maybe" is a possibility of some aid for that. An anti-
inflammatory response from anatabine, helpful to many inflammatory processes, "is what is", on the other hand ... as
experienced directly by hundreds of people now ... people like me who weren't even looking for any such effect (thus
it is not some suggestive/"placebo" effect).


By the way, Melissa my dear ... all the "reveals" you have "in store" have been discussed on that Yahoo public MB for
CIGX that "Beck" mentioned ... over and over and over (and have already been "recalled" there today by bringing up
old posts).


In proveable truth, thanks to our constant research, no one outside the company knows as much about Star Scientific
and the milieu in which it is immersed than ... of all things ... its investors!


Also, Melissa, there ARE NO " ... similar tobacco-based agents ... " to have been tried. Marty Skwhatever knows less
about that than I know about making a souffle ... and that's one area I know almost nothing about. There are no other
tobacco-based agents similar enough to the minor alkaloids (Iike anatabine) to allow one to learn anything definitive
about their possible efficacy in specific diseases.


And one more "by the way", Melissa: you're going to have to explain, when you discuss any alleged misdeed in an
inventor's long past, how that affects the worth of any IP to a company to which that IP is licensed. For example,
explain how Ford's and Edison's notorious anti-Semitism negatively affects the worth of the mass-produced

automobile, the light bulb, or the sound recording. Uhhh ... you did know about that, right? Still drive, right? Turn on
the lights? You an anti-Semite too? No? Just don't care? I thought so.


As far as I can tell, very few, if any, of even those of the faith eschew those (or any other) life comforts and necessities
because of some nagging recollection of inventor misdeeds.


Explain just how many people even think of Fleming when they get a penicillin shot (much less any misdeeds he may
have done), or Edison when they turn on a light, or Ford when they turn the key in the ignition.


Hell, honey ... half the people in the U.S. don't even know their names ... unless it's on their car or on their light bill.
And "anatabine" wasn't discovered by, or isn't being sold by, "Mr. Anatabine"! Good luck with that!


Grind that hatched now! We're running scared! We're down all of ... lets see, now ... three cents! Actually was up a
little bit, part of the day. You're GOOD!

If I understand correctly what I thought I heard on a special on PBS recently, about the New York Times, we
likely have about 1/4 the research power they do ... perhaps more. That's a bit mind boggling ... and very
comforting. Hundreds of people willing to share their web gleanings because we know that, taken all together,
it amounts to an overwhelming (though imperfect) advantage in evaluating new bits of and sources of
information.


I liken them to fishermen/women, and I'm (just, mostly) "the stringer" that (tries to) keeps it all together. I have
seen nothing like it anywhere else.


Thanks to their (and my) research collectively, I (and those who are also "keeping up" overall) can read an
article by Cox or Faessel or Altucher or the likes of Davis and know right away what is or isn't likely true,
believable, etc. ... and how well or poorly the piece is researched ... and how the author is, always so far,
using writing devices to manipulate the material presented. And always, so far, what the mistakes are.


And we're not charging each other, and we're not charging anyone else, and we're not commercializing it ...
so we can "stand" archives, and discussions, that contain plus and minus on all counts.


When a large group of people really really only want to know the truth about a subject, and only so as to
make informed decisions, amazing, lovely (most of the time) things can happen.


I'll tell you something. I have even had people who LOST money, BIG money (for individuals), on Star ...
thanks to the manipulations in certain judicial circles ... who have emailed me and thanked me, on behalf of
our loose-knit group of "eyes", for what they have termed, despite their loss, the best investing experience
ever. You won't believe that. But then that's the funny thing about the truth: it's still true.

well when u cal it a tobacco company first you are wrong. It was a tobacco co but with the research going on by John
Hopkins, QRosekamp and others, it is an emerging pharma that has discovered a cure for Alz. and a host of other
medical issues. This article is the same crap posted earlier by a nother avowed short who looks at the numbers.
Investors are n ot in this for it being a tobacco stock . They are in it because of the discovery. if as this author tried to
do was just look at its revenue she is correct. everything they are doing is directly related to its R&D nd possibly one
of the gfreatest discoveries of all time. Articles like this just show the complete ignorance and the lack of research
done by the Author. She really should learn how to research the stocks before writing bout them. like trhat hedgie the
other week who as an avowed short rtrashed the co while completelyignoring the reality that they have discovered.
what are ytou nay sayers going to do when the real reports come out as they are starting tro do. Speak with the
researchers and find out what their results are before writing such misleadingf and outdqated cacca.

Melissa,


Your article is an interesting read, I'm looking forward to Part 2.


Now that StreetSweeper has undoubtedly bought enough shares to cover their short position and sold off all the
"PUTS" and will be probably going long, I'll be looking forward to seeing your investigative report about the "other"
side of the story about Star Scientific (CIGX) like...


RJ Reynolds and Star Scientific may be in talks about a settlement and possible co-venture in the smokeless market
and a license agreement of Star's proprietary tobacco cleansing process for less harmful cigarettes to meet the new
FDA standards.


And possibly...


The discovery made in Star Scientific's RCP-006 compound may potentially be the needed active ingredient of
several new medications to treat various forms of "Inflammation" associated with numerous disease disorders which
could be worth $100Billion to Star Scientific's balance sheet, based on the anticipated revenue potential for each of
the new medications that may be created.


And possibly...


Star Scientific (CIGX), while the share price is now only trading at 4.50, could possibly see $200-$300/sh in the near
term if all goes as projected...


After all, Melissa, if StreetSweeper is now going long you'll want to, and in all fairness, report that "other" side of the
story in Part 2, right?

thx, streetsweeper and continuing good luck with the muddy waters tip. contributors get paid by views on sa now, is
that true? should get paid by comments generated, and write exclusively on things like cigx and sirius.


there's some real alpha to seek!


these are not new red lights for this story. you missed the airplane lease backs, the massive short bets and such.
maybe that's part II. the chart shows the oscillation as each wave gets the news.


it briefly peaks to $5 and drops back < $3. this particular cycle is behaving differently. the snide aside has been that
the stock is a cash machine for the insiders, pumping and dumping but never dying- a frankenstock.


but this is like at least the fourth negative (and truthful) piece since the latest cycle crossed $4, and instead of
crashing, and resetting, it has challenged it's historic trigger point twice and still no crash.

Melissa Davis and Harry Beck have obviously irritated some folks who really believe in the CIGX biotech story.
Transforming from a tobacco company to a cure for a dreaded and terminal disease is a little dubious to me, but I am
not going to engage in any rhetoric. I first heard of CIGX more than a year ago from a Seeking Alpha article touting
the potential upsides of this company's unique products. So I played it as a "highly volatile, speculative trade" using
front month call and put options to get in and out of trades. Bottom line is this: we are in the stock market to make
money, that is what the Street Sweeper is doing. Forget about the miracle cure and the intellectual discourse about
who is right or wrong. It is all about greed. And the best way to play CIGX is a short term, speculative trade.


01 Jul 2011, 06:26 AM


Shane Farley, Contributor
I've said this before. Every single short article about CIGX fails to offer evidence that they have purchased Cigrx and
tested it themselves. I hate a lot of things about this company. Nearly everyone does. However, shorts would save
themselves a TON of money if they would just buy Cigrx themselves and do some tests with it. If they give it to people
with arthritis and make them take 4-5 cigrx pills 4 times a day they will likely see incredible results. Additionally, if they
give it to smokers or dippers who genuinely want to quit then they will also very likely see incredible results. I hated
CIGX when i first researched the co. Everything looks like crap on the surface. The thing is, hedge funds are testing
Cigrx themselves and have been getting great results. Almost unbelievable results. I have a badly arthritic foot and
when i take 15-20 cigrx a day the pain completely goes away. I know a hedge fund guy who has reported a near cure
for an a incredibly serious arthritic condition in a woman who took Cigrx and got better very rapidly. I gave Cigrx to my
cousin and brother to help them quit dipping. Both quit and couldn't say enough great things about cigrx. I know it
sounds too good to be true. Just test it honestly yourself. You will see. Shorts are wasting their time talking trash.
Hedge funds are testing Cigrx and getting remarkable results. This is why the stock will go to $20.

Basically CIGX should start a clinical trial for this.

Agree that we need a clinical trial. Anecdotal evidence is interesting, but not sufficient for a solid investment
thesis.

Let's be clear that investigative reporting is not done by gamblers with vested interest in the outcome of a stock
report. If the blogger wants to gamble, let her go to Las Vegas and leave substantive analysis to experts. Cobbling
together a story that suits a hedge does not make an expert- it makes a gambler on a mission. Short on investors are
hacks looking for ways to influence the price of a stock. Had this author been to the recent conference on the
preliminary promise of compounds on Alzheimer's, she would not be quite so negative... unless all she is interested in
is influencing the price of the stock. Short traders are short on ethics as well.


01 Jul 2011, 06:35 PM


justcase
Do you really think institutions like Goldman Capital, Barclays, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street that own together
more than 13 millions shares of CIGX are throwing their money away just like this? These institutions build up huge
positions in the stock despite bad quarterly results? Why is that? The answer is: they see future potential in the
company. It is that easy. This company is not about the past but about its future outlook.  
I bought this stock because they have two potential big catalysts: non toxic smoking alternatives and a potentential
inflamatory blockbuster drug. This combined with tremendous insider buying and the involvement of multiple highly
sophisticated institutions convinced me to take a significant positons in Star.


02 Jul 2011, 11:13 AM


valueinvestor123
Justcase: Often times the institutions that you named show up as holders because CIGX is held in an index they
control. That being said, you should not own a stock because of who the major holders are. According to Yahoo
Finance, the major holders of Longtop Financial include major hedge funds like Maverick and Tiger Global as well as
JP Morgan, FMR (i.e. Fidelity), and Putnam. I am sure Enron, Global Crossing, Worldcom, and Lehman Brothers also
had an impressive list of shareholders. I know Ron Burkle who made a fortune in grocery stores was a major holder in
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company and look what happened there.

President: What is the difference between someone short a stock who writes a negative piece and someone who is

Melissa,


I guess we can thank James Altucher's astute conclusion that possibly the discovery in Star Scientific's RCP-006
compound might lead to the cure or a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, but from what I read, that's not what the real
discovery is in Star's RCP-006 compound.


From what I'm reading, the real discovery, and all that has been focused on by the Roskamp Institute and John
Hopkins Research, is the ability of RCP-006 compound to treat "Inflammation", which is a key component in the
treatment of many known disease disorders including Alzheimer's Disease.


You might read this on the Yahoo Message Board...


messages.finance.yahoo...


I don't know, if the StreetSweeper is in the process of covering their short position and selling their puts to go long
they might actively do it quick before all the other shorts find out about this and jump to cover their short positions.


03 Jul 2011, 11:08 AM


Harry Beck, Contributor
The pumpers have their story, but the official story presented in Star Scientific’s own SEC filings is completely
different. Star Scientific hasn’t made money for the past nine years and doesn’t expect to make money for the
foreseeable future. In fact, they may need to raise more capital (again) next year:


“Absent the exercise of outstanding warrants and options for cash or a substantial improvement in sales and
revenues and/or royalties, we believe that the recent funding will support our operations through the first quarter 2012.
However, depending upon market conditions and the price of the common stock, we may decide to seek additional
funds before that date.”


Even Star Scientific isn’t suggesting they may hold the key to a cure for Alzheimer’s. Suggesting this is pure fantasy
and a great example of the shameful pumping this stock has seen. For example, the pumpers aren’t telling people the
research institute isn’t independent. A press release from the Roskamp Institute states:


“SRQ Bio, LLC, a for-profit affiliate of the Roskamp Institute, has a financial interest in Star Scientific. In April 2010,
Star Scientific issued to SRQ Bio, LLC 100,000 shares of common stock in a private placement. In addition, in March
2010, Robert Roskamp, the trustee of the Roskamp Institute, in an individual capacity, purchased shares of Star
Scientific stock valued at $1 million, and was issued a matching warrant for an equal number of shares, as part of a
private placement transaction.”


RCP-006 has been tested by the friendly institute since October of last year. There has been no published report of
their findings. The pumpers also ignore another fact that was published in The Street Sweeper:


“In a damaging report earlier this month, however, New York hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli proclaimed that at
least three drug companies have already conducted clinical trials of similar tobacco-based agents and found no
evidence supporting their use as effective treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. He expressed serious doubts that Star,

with its “lack of success” in the nutraceuticals field and its “complete lack of experience” in the pharmaceuticals space,
could somehow manage to succeed where more established health-related companies had already failed.”


Even if Star Scientific eventually produces a commercially viable product (Note: CIG-X does not seem to be likely to
be very profitable based upon poor results from the rollout in Virginia, where Star Scientific is located.), investors may
not see earnings justify the current stock price. From the latest 10-Q:


“At March 31, 2011, there were 8,570,200 options issued and outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of
$2.33 per share.”


It seems there are people who will benefit greatly from exercising these options at a high share price, even if the
company never earns money again.


The pumpers continue to attack those who question the company’s past and current lack of earnings, the likelihood of
any product being commercially viable, the president’s compensation, the presidents past involvement in a fraudulent
stock promotion scheme (www.sec.gov/news/diges...), the high current valuation of the stock, and the amount of
dilution that will come from the potential exercise of options. What the pumpers can’t do is find fault with the facts
brought to light by two recent negative Seeking Alpha articles.

Mr. Beck,


It's my understanding that there's outstanding litigation between RJReynolds and Star Scientific and, essentially, that
litigation is over a patent infringement and the US Patent Office had recently confirmed the validity of Star Scientific's
Patents and that's where that litigation stands right now. With this in mind, who do you think is holding the more
favorable position in the matter? And, with that in mind, wouldn't it make sense for RJ Reynolds to consider a
settlement with Star Scientific? This is real world business sense.


Analysts, looking at the tobacco industry, worldwide, are saying the market is calling for a less harmful cigarette and
they say that future regulations will press the industry in this direction. It would only make sense for tobacco
companies, like RJ Reynolds, to look at available processes like Star Scientific's patented cleansing process to be
able to provide less harmful products and meeting any new regulations and they're coming.


And, I don't know where you get the notion that Roskamp Institute is not independent, that SRQ Bio, LLC is a
company set up to isolate certain financial interests. So what?


Speaking of reports, Mr. Beck, Roskamp published a report of their lab results, in the form of a chart, here is a link to
it...


www.rfdn.org/inflammag...


I haven't read a report yet, either here or anywhere else, that's being referred to that has even addressed what
Roskamp's or John Hopkin's research is about. The articles written so far have only been about challenging Mr.
Altucher's astute conclusion that the discovery in Star Scientific's RCP-006 compound could be the cure for
Alzheimer's Disease. These articles that are referred to are just plainly based on ignorance, in my opinion.

Actually, the discovery in Star Scientific's RCP-006 compound is rather exciting and the chart published by Roskamp
is supportive of the potential of that discovery.


We'll see what the findings are from the clinical trial ("Flint Study").


Here's a link to the PR about that study...

Why don't you guys talk about the real story? I don't think these articles could be more misleading.

Billxx,


Dr. Mullam of Roskamp owns and controls SRQ Bio, LLC. Therefore, I would not consider either party independent. I
do admit it is not unusual for parties involved with research to have cross-investments, but there is a very important
(IMHO) stock pumping issue surrounding this stock. This issue is detailed in the second Street Sweeper article dated
7/4 that was released sometime earlier today.


If I recall, Martin Shkreli's writeup on Seeking Alpha determined that drug companies already conducted clinical trials
of substances/agents similar to the RCP-006. There was no magical "cure" for Alzheimer's found in those trials. I
guess you believe RCP-006 is in some way much different than the agents tested by big pharm.


I will read your links carefully. Perhaps you can explain to me why the "reports" you list and a host of other
"information" in circulation that the promoters deem material was never published on Star's own website?


In terms of the "you guys" comment, I am an individual investor. That's all there is to it! I am not solidly in a "growth",
"value" or "momentum" camp. I just like to see things that are significantly over/under valued and make bets. I am not
a basher because experience dictates anyone can be right for the wrong reasons or just plain wrong.

Mr. Beck,


My point of issue about SRQ Bio, LLC is that those companies are created all the time and it's a means to isolate
financial interests. Even Dr's. should have a means to invest. Again, so what?!


You should read the materials that I linked to before answering with such nonsense that somebody else says this or
that.


If you look, Mr. Beck, the link I posted goes to the horse's mouth. You said Roskamp never published a report and I
posted a link to it, that's all. Why would Star Scientific post that information?


Mr. Altucher made the astute conclusion that the disccovery in Star Scientific's RCP-006 compound may lead to a
cure or be a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, well, all I wish you to do is read the materials and make your own

conclusion. :)


Geez, I hope you don't invest solely on what you hear, who is Martin Shkreli?


I don't know, so far, these articles have yet to even mention anything about the research by Roskamp Institute and
John Hopkins so how can there even be any intelligable arguments made about anything?

Well, we will find out what Roskamp and the other studies find soon enough. Even if inflammation is reduced,
the amount may or may not be significant in terms of creating a product from the RCP-006 agent that works
any better than what is already available.


They have been testing this since last October, right? How much longer do you think it will take before the
results will be released that will determine if the compound "may lead to a cure for Alzheimer's Disease..."?
