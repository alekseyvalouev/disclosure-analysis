Aegerion: Addressable Market At Odds By 1,000%

RE: Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AEGR)


Summary:


Aegerion is trying to convince investors that there can be a population of 3,000 HoFH
patients in the US for its drug, "lomitapide"; Nobel Prize winners and scientists associated
with Aegerion use numbers that are closer to 300.


Background:


Aegerion is in a race against Isis, Amgen, Sanofi and others to provide another treatment
for those afflicted with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), an extremely
rare, yet very serious disease leading to excessive levels of cholesterol. Before modern
treatments, such as apheresis and statins, most patients did not live beyond 30 years of
age. Isis' new drug, called "Mipomersen," has just been approved this year by the FDA.
Competing with this new drug is Aegerion's drug, "Lomitapide."


Aegerion has only one drug on the market. As the SEC filings put it, "Our business
currently depends entirely on the success of JUXTAPID." (AKA, "lomitapide.") ~ (AEGR
2012 10-K)

Aegerion currently has a market cap of about $2 billion, with "full year 2013 revenue
guidance for net product sales to $45 to $50 million …" ("Aegerion Pharmaceuticals
Announces Third-Quarter 2013 Financial Results")


A controversy surrounds Aegerion's claimed patient population: management has been
promoting the idea that there are 3,000 HoFH cases in the USA; scientists associated with
Aegerion put the number closer to 300. That is a 1,000% difference.


The Patient Count Controversy:


"… consistent with our plan to discontinue offering specific launch metrics other than
sales, we no longer plan to provide guidance for the number of patients on therapy
at year end." (Q2 2013 Conference Call)


Why not?


With Aegerion's decision to stop revealing patient counts, we have only underlined an
older suspicion: the estimate of HoFH patients in the USA as used by the very scientists
associated with Aegerion may be correct and consequently, the actual U.S. HoFH patient
count promoted by the CEO would be a 1,000% exaggeration … 90% lower than
Aegerion's promotional material suggests.

"... there may be as many as 15,000 potential patients appropriate for lomitapide
therapy in total on a global basis, with at least 3,000 of them being in the U.S." (Q2

"… I would emphasize that what we're seeing in the marketplace is just reconfirming
that 3,000-plus U.S. number, that 15,000 -- approximately 15,000 patients globally,
and we feel comfortable committing that we can get 4,000 to 5,000 patients on
therapy globally and have this exceed $1 billion of revenue per year." (Q3 2013
Conference Call)


Dr. Marina Cuchel, top listed scientist on Aegerion's lomitapide phase 3 study uses a
prevalence of "1:1,000,000," which comes out to about 300 patients in the USA. (To see
her relationship to Aegerion, follow the links to Dr. Cuchel's presentation poster | Lancet)


See her YouTube presentation of Aegerion's Lomitapide, in which she also mentions
HoFH prevalence in the first minute. Quote from 0:30 into the video:


"... for a very rare disease: that is Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia. The
incidence is calculated to be one in a million, so about 300 patients in the United
States."


Dr. Daniel J. Rader, introduced by Aegerion as "the inventor of the patent," uses a
prevalence of "1:1,000,000," which comes out to about 300 patients in the USA.


"The estimated prevalence of homozygous FH is approximately 1 in a million
people." (Presentation before the FDA committee)

Aegerion financially supported a study on the prevalence of HoFH in Germany and that
study estimated a prevalence of 1:860,000.(Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
(HoFH) in Germany: an epidemiological survey) As of this writing, the U.S. population is
about 317 million. (US Census Population Clock) Even if this  
German study and its higher prevalence rate were representative of U.S. rates, these
numbers would still estimate the U.S. population of HoFH patients to be somewhere
between 300 and 400. That's a serious drop from Aegerion's promotion of 3,000.


The scientific community generally uses the number 300 for the U.S. -- that is, a
prevalence rate of 1:1,000,000. This prevalence rate has been widely accepted and
published. It is even used by Nobel Prize winners, Michael S. Brown and Joseph L.
Goldstein. Their research, as described on the official website for the Nobel Prize,
mentions the prevalence rate: "The severe form of FH (homozygous) is rare, about one in
a million people."(The Official Web Site of the Nobel Prize)


This latter number is even used in Michael Brown's Nobel Prize acceptance speech:

Follow the link to the official website of the Nobel Prize organization: Video of Nobel Prize
winner, Michael Brown, using prevalence rate of 1:1,000,000 for HoFH. The prevalence
rate is mentioned and illustrated 11:47 minutes into the video.)


Perhaps it's possible that those with a Wall Street interest in prevalence rates know more
than the scientific community, or perhaps some people just get high by smoking their own
math. Me, I think I'll bet on what the scientists are saying.


What is AEGR worth with 3,000 U.S. and 15,000 global patients? … but if investors have
been misled and the number is actually 90% less, what will we value AEGR's stock price
with a U.S. patient population of only 300? Here is a claim made in the third quarter
conference call:


"… I would emphasize that what we're seeing in the marketplace is just reconfirming
that 3,000-plus U.S. number, that 15,000 -- approximately 15,000 patients globally,
and we feel comfortable committing that we can get 4,000 to 5,000 patients on
therapy globally and have this exceed $1 billion of revenue per year." (Conference
Call Q3 2013)


But investors currently value Aegerion at a 2 billion dollar market cap, about $70 ~ $80 per
share -- as if all of these sales have already taken place and as if there were no issue of
an exaggerated patient population. If the generally accepted prevalence rate ends up
being correct and if the market adjusts revenue estimates down 90%, what stock price will
we adjust to? 90% down from here would be about $7 or $8 per share. That'd be a serious
drop.

I called Investor Relations at Aegerion and did not receive any information that was not
already made available through filings, conference calls, and the Investor Day
presentation. To sum up the conversation, Aegerion held to the 3,000 patient count. Their
data is "proprietary," and there is no "third party peer reviewed" information that I could
receive. A patient tracker was said to list 1,500 patients, with the "vast majority" being
from the United States. Based on this tracker, contact with doctors, and other data, they
are deriving their 3,000 patient count for the US. This data is not publicly available, so we
are left with trusting management for both the data and the method of calculation. When I
asked for publicly available sources, they pointed out the European Heart Journal article
featured on Investor Day. Let's take a look at that article.


Aegerion held its "Investor Day" on November 7, 2013. In it CEO Mark Beer refers to a
paper in the European Heart Journal, which supports, by "extrapolation," what Aegerion
has been trying to tell investors: there might be more HoFH patients than generally
accepted by the scientific community. (CEO Beer Investor day. Time: 9:10 minutes into
presentation)


9:10 minutes into the presentation, CEO Beer. said,


"We had nothing to do actually with this publication."


This is clearly not the case. One only needs to scroll down to page 12 to see that Aegerion
put up some money here.


"Conflict of interest: Consensus Panel members have received lecture honoraria,
consultancy fees and/or research funding from Aegerion (M.J.C., R.D.S., M.A.,

What about the original paper?


Familiar Hypercholesterolemia (FH) has a severe form, HeFH, and an extremely severe
and extremely rare form, HoFH. The fact that the study focused on HeFH and not HoFH is
not a concern, since HoFH is related to HeFH. "HeFH" refers to Heterozygous FH
(inherited from only one parent) and HoFH, to Homozygous FH (inherited from both
parents). So when the study challenges the widely accepted HeFH prevalence of 1:500
with the new number 1:200, we should accept that, if true and representative of the
general population, this would have a bearing on HoFH prevalence rates. So far, so good.


On Investor Day, this new prevalence rate of 1:200 for HeFH is extrapolated into a
prevalence rate for HoFH of 1:160,000, ending with an patient population of 2,000 in the
U.S. But how did we get this rate 1 in 200?


Why would Aegerion use the paper from the European Heart Journal and not use the
original paper from which the European Heart Journal derived the information, lumping
"Definite" FH patients together with "Probable" FH patients. When we read the text we
learn that the paper is recommending a scoring system which will categorize candidates
for FH into degrees of probability. Now we can lump "probable patients" with "definite
patients" and show everyone a higher prevalence rate. In the original paper, however, you
can see these scores separately, and, surprise, surprise, the prevalence for Definite FH is
the same old 1:500. Lumped together in the European Heart Journal we naturally come up
with a higher prevalence rate.

and undertreated in the general population: guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary
heart disease. (cited by Aegerion on Investor Day)

Do we even need to mention that two of the authors on the original paper also received
funds from pharmaceutical players? Do we need to mention that there are players here
who have a financial interest in finding a larger pool of patients rather than a smaller one?


And do we really have a right to make assumptions on the U.S. population of HoFH
patients from this particular study?


What is not immediately apparent is that this was a very specific study of "whites of
Danish descent." How representative would that be of a melting pot such as the U.S.
population? Additionally, the findings are contradicted by a previous study of 10,000
Danish infants which estimated an HeFH prevalence of 1:995. There is a serious gap of
several hundred percent between two different studies, both estimating Danish prevalence
rates for HeFH.


"11 infants were diagnosed with FH in a screening of 10,440 Danish newborns"

(10,440 / 11 = 1 in 949)

Another study which Aegerion did not mention is one which it also funded and which
determined an HoFH prevalence rate in neighboring Germany of 1:860,000. (Homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in Germany: an epidemiological survey)


In fact, many studies have been done by others regarding the prevalence rates for HeFH
and HoFH.


"The prevalence of FH is well-defined: it is one of the most common genetic
disorders. Heterozygotes number about 1:500 persons in the general population,
increasing to 1:50 when a founder effect is present, such as in French Canadian,
Finnish, Christian Lebanese and South African populations." (Kaye-Eileen Willard,
MD, ABIM Medical Director for Chronic Disease Management Wheaton Franciscan
Healthcare All Saints Cardiovascular Institute)


So we're not without a sample of prevalence counts, none of which should be taken off the
table. A study in the UK put the prevalence of HeFH at 1:623; in Japan, at 1:900. In the
illustration below, note that the numbers for the USA were derived from a Nobel Prize
winner's research, Joseph L. Goldstein, and were estimated to be in a range of 1:500 and
1:1000. (Genetic Causes of Monogenic Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A

Nice work Matt, but you failed to consider two very important things. 1. The founder effect: http://bit.ly/19joBAV 
2. Aegerion has no competition for HoFH patients. The drugs from "Isis, Amgen, Sanofi" lower cholesterol by allowing
LDL receptors to remain active longer. HoFH patients have no LDL receptors. Lomitapide prevents the formation of
LDL, and it is the only approved drug to do so.

That's Incorrect. Cory. You are mixing the ISIS drug up with the PCSK9 drug. The Sanofi/Genzyme/ISIS drug
Kynamro is better because it lowers the PRODUCTION of all arthroscopic lipids except HDL. AGER's Juxta
reduces the good HDL. Juxta does not lower lipid production, it increases clearance through the intestines
which is why diarrhea was reported in at least 93% ad gets worse with increased dosage.

Cory, ISIS drug actually is not in the same category as AMGN's drug which is a PCSK9 inhibitor. ISIS drug is
an ApoB100 inhibitor. So in actuality only Kynamro from ISIS/GENZ and Juxtapid from AEGR are the only
two drugs that can really treat the hard core HoF patient. It is my personal belief that the ISIS drug is better. I
believe that the liver enzyme elevation problem will be Juxtapid's alone as ISIS data shows that after about
seven months patients on Kynamro have their liver enzymes come back to normal or below baseline in most
patients. The reason that it takes so long is that the half-life for Kynamro is about thirty days and it takes five
doses to reach a steady-state level. The MTP inhibitor also has an increase in small intestine with fatty

infiltration. That IMO will have an inflammatory change with negative consequences. Also, with the mode that
MTP's inhibitors use for their lowering of LDL you also get a malabsorption type situation with malabsorption
of fat soluble vitamins such as Vitamin D, E, and A. You also have an increased amount of ox-LDL compared
to Kynamro. I believe over time that the market place will see the differences between the two products. The
main selling point for Juxtapid was that it was an oral medication and Kynamro is an injection. However, if you
look at how many times a patient will get poked with a needle with Juxtapid in regards to titration of the
dosage upward, and then rechecking that patient to see the response to the doseage change, the checking
for malabsorption in regards to vitamins and other essential nutrients, I believe that you will get more needle
sticks over the long run with the use of the Juxtapid. t

There is a substantial difference between the probability model (which is the core source of the 1:1,000,000 number,
and with 300M people in the US 1 in a million is how they derive the 300 count) -- and the actual number of reported
cases in the U.S. Which is at the 3,000 number. The 15,000 worldwide number is based on the actual
incident/diagnosed rate, not a probability number of what "should be".


If you trace the probability number of 1 in a million back through to its core sources, it references underlying studies
dating back to 1973 and older. In fact, the bulk of the research supporting the 1 in a million number is from 19xx, so
before the year 2000. Many things have changed since then and the actual number of patients diagnosed has gone
up considerably. This is very much like the dramatic increase in breast cancer & other diseases. As awareness of
these diseases increased, and also as treatments became available, it has become much more clear the actual rate
of these diseases which differed substantially from their probability model.


Many of the baseline assumptions that went in to the probability model were inaccurate. Said another way, a coin flip
should be 50% heads and 50% tails. Yet after observing actual results that were 90% heads we learn that the coin
wasn't properly balanced and that was why real world results differed from the probabilistic model.


It's the difference between an estimated prediction and actual results. AEGR's numbers came from real world results,
and given that they have already surpassed the 300 number (of patients) then we know for a fact that something was
wrong with the probabilistic model.

So far with Aegerion's population count I have seen claims, and not evidence. As if … "We have the data, but
we're not going to show it to you." Can you post references to your claims of a higher population count?
Where can I find publically available data in support of your claimed population count?


13 Nov 2013, 08:44 AM

Again, it is the difference between estimates (per your article you referenced, following your link) and actual
reports. While the 187 doctors in Germany surveyed (out of 303,000 doctors in Germany) is an interesting
data point, again, it is such a small sampling, that it isn't statistically meaningful. Similarly, the article did a
literature search "A systematic literature search in EMBASE and Medline was performed in conjunction with a
targeted manual search for epidemiological HoFH studies." which is hardly real world data. It was a search
launched based on research papers published.


While many short-sellers demand "Show me where it is published that the statistics are truly as high as you
claim" it simply doesn't work that way. All the literature points to estimates, but the reality is in the actual
patients who come on treatment. AEGR has a database of patients who have registered directly with them
seeking treatment. These patients have health insurance that will pay for the treatment, and you'd better
believe that those insurance companies are checking each and every diagnosis to be sure it is accurate and
legitimate before paying that hefty fee.


Since AEGR has already crossed the 300 patient watermark, I would have expected a different tactic from
those against AEGR. What will the argument be when they have 1,000 patients on treatment? Will the short-
sellers argue that it is massive fraud? I doubt it - since the insurance companies are checking each and every
case.


To the people claiming there is no global warming, sure there is. The entire planet was once completely
frozen over and it has been warming up ever since. Since we are no longer in a massive ice age, it is warmer
than it was when everything is frozen. That is reality. Similarly, the empirical evidence is how many patients
are diagnosed with the disease, and then how many go on treatment. Since nobody is going to fund a
research project to "prove" the old statistics were inaccurate, we wait and see how many are actually

AEGR's numbers approximate the level of HoF in South Africa which I don't believe is the entire world. The
numbers may be better than the one in a million, but not as low as one in 100K. t

Author’s reply »  >While the 187 doctors in Germany surveyed (out of 303,000 doctors in Germany) is an
interesting data point, again, it is such a small sampling, that it isn't statistically meaningful.


1. It is more meaningful as a study open to public scrutiny than a secret-study a company only claims to have.
Too convenient for a company to promote, “We have the evidence, but we’re not going to show it to you.” 
2. 303,000 doctors in Germany: The study focused on doctors/clinics which treat HoFH. I wouldn’t expect
podiatrists to be contacted, etc.


>Similarly, the article did a literature search "A systematic literature search in EMBASE and Medline was
performed in conjunction with a targeted manual search for epidemiological HoFH studies." which is hardly
real world data. It was a search launched based on research papers published.


You’ve presented only half of the aim. The literature search was done to compare with the empirical search.
The very next sentence reads ….


“Additionally, a nationwide survey was conducted in Germany in all identified apheresis- and lipid centers. The
purpose of this survey was the validation of the systematic literature search results based on empirical
(practice) data.”


So here is your empirical search, paid for by AEGR and which estimates a prevalence of 1:860,000.


Additionally, Dutch studies show a prevalence of 1:640,000 (and with founder effect involved).


>While many short-sellers demand "Show me where it is published that the statistics are truly as high as you
claim" it simply doesn't work that way.


AEGR claims a prevalence rate, without showing their investors or the scientific community evidence to back
it up. Now they stop quoting patient counts. Add to that the low revenue for last quarter, which if responsibly
deconstructed suggests that there was no patient growth.


>AEGR has a database of patients who have registered directly with them seeking treatment.


AEGR can create a database. Patients on therapy is another thing. Now we have no means of verification for
either of them -- and the low revenue for this last quarter points toward a ceiling on US patient growth.


>These patients have health insurance that will pay for the treatment, and you'd better believe that those
insurance companies are checking each and every diagnosis to be sure it is accurate and legitimate before
paying that hefty fee.


Here’s one that requires prospective Juxtapid patients to try the rival Kynamro BEFORE trying AEGR’s drug.

h. A documented prior trial and failure with mipomersen (Kynamro™)”  
Paramount Healthcare: http://bit.ly/1ijR29Y


>Since AEGR has already crossed the 300 patient watermark,


Where did you get that number? Break down the revenue from last quarter and show me how you can
calculate 250, let alone 300 patients on therapy without AEGR becoming a zero sum game by severely
discounting the drug? “Acceleration” in patients on therapy is not mathematically possible for the last quarter
if details given in CC are true. Do the math. At this rate, how will AEGR be able to justify its 2.5 billion market
cap?


>Similarly, the empirical evidence is how many patients are diagnosed with the disease, and then how many
go on treatment. Since nobody is going to fund a research project to "prove" the old statistics were inaccurate,
we wait and see how many are actually diagnosed and go on treatment.


AEGR funded an empirical study in Germany and counted actual HoFH patients in practice. The prevalence
rate was 1:860,000.

There is little I can add to the above comments on analysis, except to say, biopharma industry history has shown time
and again, when the first therapy for a rare disease comes to market, the expected number of patients in the market
almost always becomes larger. When a disease has no available treatment, many physicians in the community and
more rural areas do not refer their patients to specialist centers for treatment, because there is not a reason to do so.
Thus, the number of diagnosed patients is typically under-reported. It might be realistic to suggest that under-

Author’s reply »  No doubt that as the big players enter this area a lot of dust will be thrown in the air, but in
the end, with a healthy debate, more accurate numbers will arrive, so I agree with you there. We will see in
the end whether wall street has it right with "3,000" and the scientists had it wrong, with somewhere between
300 and 400. I'm betting on publically available information. Going with that public data, it seems that the
count has been grossly exaggerated.

Agreed. Look at the prevalence of breast cancer now. Before there was much awareness or any effective
treatments, it was hardly ever reported. Now you can't go anywhere without seeing another breast cancer ad
or awareness campaign. In the first 3/4 of my life I had only heard of anyone with breast cancer, but now it
has effected a very large number of people that I know. So you are dead on - in that if there was no effective
treatment for a disease, why ever report it? Now that there IS an effective treatment, expect those numbers to
rise to reality.


Lastly, you are again correct in that the CEO would have a basis for his numbers and likely they are more
accurate than any other philosophical probabilistic model. Only time will tell if the CEO's estimates are
accurate. If they are, will the short sellers have to pay restitution to shareholders for the losses incurred in the
meantime? Hardly. Yet conversely, if it turns out the CEO grossly overstated anything, you'd better believe the
regulators will come after him. So who has more at stake - the CEO who IS accountable, or short sellers who
are not accountable?

Hey Matt, did you know that biotech companies like QCOR, JAZZ, ALXN, etc all had prevalence rates (in
literature) far less than current patient numbers? This is especially true in an orphan disease. So, with AEGR,
as well, you need not rant (to support your short thesis) about the epidemiological data.


Orphan diseases are all underdiagnosed. When biotechs launch the products, they do the education and
increase the awareness. Take a look at ALXN and JAZZ. If the patient numbers are what the literature
suggests, they should have sales in couple of millions and not hundreds of millions...


Also, Amgen and Sanofi are just running phase3 trials, and they have couple of years away for registration
and the approval..so no point in arguing that they are competitors (only isis is a competitor). Just because you
have free time does not mean that u have to write stupid articles.....


15 Nov 2013, 10:59 PM

The huge difference between AEGR and the companies you listed is that these companies are able to
actually get MORE NEW indications for their products. QCOR has about nine different uses for their drug and
just this year expanded that out with another. They have even been able to go "mainstream" with some
patients who fail other MS treatments to be on their drug. Look at ALXN, they also have about nine different
indications for their drug. In regards to JAZZ, their drug is reliant on patients with phenotypical problems that
need/could be discovered. A huge difference when comparing that to someone with a GENETIC problem. It is
said that in pro-sports that a team is only as good as its management, and this is biotech not sports but the
rule still applies IMO. If you go to the website for AEGR you see all over the philosophy of the company as
per Mr. Beer. They are in the business to treat orphan diseaseS. With an S.....what other diseases are they
going to tackle in the next five to seven years? I know they are working on it. Let's see how that is going. Look
at the pipeline that they no longer publish. It is one drug, another MTP inhibitor that I believe was purchased
to reduce the possibility of competition down the road. Well maybe they'll discover something in the
lab.....they have no discovery lab. Well they say they are going for the pediatric use of juxtapid under
development of NEW products. How will they pull that off? Mr. Beer got extremely lucky in regards to how the
FDA handled their 23 patient study in adults. That won't happen again in children. That study will end up
costing in excess of $70 million IMO. Well let's see when they can fund something like that. Mr. Beer has

already warned shareholders don't expect to see any profits until late 2014, early 2015. Are all of those profits
going to go into a pediatric study? Then there is their foray into treating patients with FCS. They originally
thought that they would do that because they were convinced that the drug would work based on a one
patient experience with a physician from Harvard placing a patient with FCS on the MTP inhibitor about 14
years ago. Again a far cry from even the 23 patient study, and profits will vanish if this is attempted. Now with
their present competitor having a vastly superior product for that indication, and another drug from NVS also
in the pipeline that places this possibility of the FCS indication down below 1% IMO.


You then have the patent issue. They do have a patent on the dosing. Not much real medicine knowledge to
protect there. I predict in about three years someone like TEVA is going to challenge that patent. A company
of size will play "patent poker." Someone can counter with that AEGR could just pay them to back off which
has become common practice. AZN and generic makers under federal indictment for that very thing and the
FDA is moving to most likely make that illegal. A paper-mach company this AEGR. The argument can also be
that is the job of the CEO to really promote your company. However, when the CEO has gone to the extreme
that he is attracting negative attention to the company, and he has to watch every word he says know he has
made himself much less effective in trying to obtain that goal With a huge distraction, possibly a fine, and
making yourself much less useful.....maybe your usefulness has come to an end?! t

You also are misinformed in regards to ISIS. They invented the drug and sold it to GENZ that in turn got
bought out by Sanofi. So, Sanofi owns the ISIS drug. They thus have huge monetary reserves, they have
long time contacts with cardiologists because of their previous drugs. The ratio of cardiologists to lipidologists
is about 50: 1. AEGR just announced about two weeks ago that they were going after cardiologists now. They
also have posted on Yahoo that their work force is 98 people when about two weeks ago they listed 125
employees, go figure. Sanofi could theoretically offer both Kynaro, and the PCSK9 inhibitor to patients for less
than juxtapid. Might not happen, but if you are an investor with a vision and you want to protect yourself you
should IMO look at all possibilities that you can think of. So you see there is a point in arguing competitors
because it is even worse than you imagined in regards to utilizing resources to get your product out there and
to compete. t

No offense, and nobody is perfect, but your last statement is a perfect example of how the company has been
able to pull this off. Many people think that it is just a big strong statin and you have to watch the liver

his portraying that. At least to a certain degree. If you watch a Cialis commercial you're going to get more
fright out of that than with a Mr. Beer talk. That is because unlike the Cialis commercial, when he does a
nationwide commercial he doesn/t/hasn't yet put in those caveats like the Cialis commercials are required to
do. Also, many, many people think that juxta is safer than the competitor when in fact the competitor has data
that shows that after about seven months peoples' liver enzymes go back to normal, juxta can't say that. The
other biggy is that small intestinal fat build-up, the competitor does not do that, the competitor doesn't lower

your HDL like juxta does either, in fact it raises about 10% on average. You then come down to the famous
argument a pill vs. a shot. However, if you have to keep on moving the doseages of juxta up or down
depending on liver enzyme elevations, and tolerance to diarrhea you are going to have to be rechecking the
blood much more frequently to reassess you results. No physician is going to make a doseage adjustment on
a REMS drug without checking results of a change that the physician themselves are responsible for. Throw
in the fact you will need to continue to watch for malabsortion syndrome for deficiencies in fat soluble
vitamins, minerals, and other important substances and you're going to be having a lot more needle sticks
than people realize. The basic mechanism of action of this drug is along the lines of abetalipoproteinemia. A
big risk for those patients is sudden deafness from Vitamin E deficiency. So as you can hopefully see this isn't
just a big brother to statins. And unlike statins where you don't really ever have to check liver enzymes, with
juxta you will always have to. t

AEGR's drug having more indications has no basis in fact. ISIS has taken away FCS which was a hail mary to
begin with for AEGR based on one patient data. 
Where and when are the trials that will be needed for these indications to start? 
And they better have more than 23 patients in the trial. 
ISIS just announced excellent trial results Friday night on their LPa drug, Apoc3 data on Monday.

Author’s reply »  1. That number includes foreign patients. 
2. From qtr to qtr to qtr,-- from 75 patients, to 215 patients, and now with AEGR going silent on patient counts
we are left with trying to calculate patients based on qtrly revenue. There are a host of scenarios here, but it is
difficult to find a scenario where AEGR has more than a 20 or 30 patient acquisition over the last quarter. It
grew by 150 patients in the previous quarter. By what stretch of the imagination could this be an
"acceleration," as CEO Beer claims? Is this why AEGR stopped revealing patient counts this quarter?


For value in the underlying enterprise to get a $2+ billion market cap, from 50 million in sales, AEGR needs
extreme acceleration. Breaking down Aegerion's 3rd qtr revenue into patients on therapy: We aren't given a
breakdown, esp. the mix of multi-month foreign sales to single month US sales, but even the most favorable
scenario for AEGR suggests a sharp decline in growth in patient acquisition.


Also, if AEGR's 215 count represented US patients only, then as an investor I would worry about off-label use
while under a very strict REMS ETASU. From last Friday's FDA warning to Aegerion, one can be very
confident that the FDA is watching this team very closely.

Even if they get to $300 million in 2015 (which I doubt), due to the extremely small # of potential patients, the

The company is totally locked-in in regards to potential. They have only this indication for their product. They
had hoped to move into the FCS treatment space based on their one patient treated for that by the Harvard
physician over 14 years ago. With ISIS new drug, their ApoC III inhibitor that sucked out that potential. If they
try and get FDA approval in the pediatric population they are not going to be able to get by with that flimsy 23
patient single armed study like they were able to pull off with their adult approval for HoF. The amount of
money that will be needed to pull off a phase III pediatric use will be over $70 IMO. So their fate is to be
happy with what they have with GENZ honing in on the cardiologists big-time, or try and obtain additional
indications for the pediatric patient and for FCS patients. Not looking to good to me. That doesn't count the
distinct possibility of boot-legged drug for a small molecule that is over-priced, and for patent challenges in
regards to flimsy patents based on a dosing schedule, not real medicine. Part of the deceit of AEGR is that
fact that they bought out as their only pipeline drug another MTP inhibitor to stop that very competition. The
whole thing seems like paper-mach to me. t

slow(did they declare patients gradually so as to make the perception they were coming on like that?, he raised the
price of the drug with a lie that it was because the demand was so high, early on(I believe this also was planned), at
times Mr. Beer used some of the old data from BMY as theirs when talking to prospective shareholders, they really
downplayed their reduction of HDL with the use of their drug, they've changed their Chief Medical officer at least two
times, I believe it is three times in the two years they helped finance some of the "studies" and tried to make like they
were unbiased scientific studies, some of the analysts like JS are really in on the stock, and now you have the
mystery reduction in employees which was pulled off without any news. Even if you are a 50 cent stock usually
Reuters, Bloomberg, or some other financial news picks up the fact you are having a downsizing.


Let me go a little bit further. Everything in pathology to a certain degree deals with inflammation. This drug Juxapid
definitely raises the amount of fat in the small intestine. A really unnatural development. No one can tell you what that
does. Will it cause an increase in GIST tumors? Does it raise your CRP an other inflammatory markers like IL-6.....a
good scientist would want to know. Most studies show now that increased intestinal fat raises your CV risk, and that
coupled with increased liver which is also another increasing risk of CV disease. So Mr. Beer is telling a national
audience that with the simpleton idea that lowering your LDL is going to make it so these people see their
grandchildren when in reality he doesn't know, nobody does, the drug has only been out one year. Also, Mr. Beer was
a genius. He talked the FDA into allowing him to have patients also.receive Aphereses during this study. This is
similar to dialysis in that it cleanses your blood of LDL. The average person who has this procedure walks out of the
Aphereses center with an LDL of about 80. It will gradually go back up, but in those who did receive Aphereses that is
a huge boost. In fairness not all patients in their 23 patient study were on Aphereses. Then look at what Mr. Beer was
able to talk the FDA into. If any patient had a rise in their liver enzymes three times above normal they were allowed
to stay in the study and once their liver enzymes were back to normal that got back in and could be counted so the
average lowering of LDL was really not skewed by patients that were forced to be dropped from the study and then
averaged back as if they were treated like the competitor.. Most studies would have been written up in such a way
that they would have been excluded from then on once they violated the criteria.....in this case there were no criteria
only voluntarily removing yourself from the study.. This allowed them, along with Aphereses to really get their LDL
averages down, those things along with an extremely low fat diet that was pushed by the investigators.. AEGR also
had three subjects in their study that had a very rapid elevation of their liver enzymes to eleven times above normal.
These patients were allowed to stay in they study to find a lower dose once their liver enzymes went back to normal.
The competitor had to have any drop-outs in their study, no matter, when they occurred be averaged in on their
results greatly bringing down their LDL levels. The real klinker IMO is that their competitor really knows a lot about the
MTP target. They worked on drugs for MTP inhibition for a long time, way before AEGR became a public company,
and they decided that target was too dangerous. As a confirmation they sent out some juxtapid to Metablomics, a
company in LA, that does in the lab what their corporate name to see what they thought.


Metablomics called back with one question, and one statement. Question was, Where did you get that? The
statement was DON'T ever use it. So you see, Mr. Beer owes a lot to the FDA, he fell "victim" to the old saying, 'if you
give them an inch they'll want to take a mile.'. t

AEGR has 432 patients on drug at YE 2014. Ok maybe I'm off by 10-20 but this is the number. They will have +1,000
on drug at YE 2014, fits with guidanc. So,all your nonsense about 300 patients can go out the window. Orphan drug
compaies always under represent the actual populations because of under diagnosis. With doc/patient education,
intiial estimates are almost always surpassed. Look at (Eliprase for Hunter's Syndrome) from Shire for example. Initial
estimates were for $200-300M in sales, Shire just reported $545M. There are many other examples like Cinryse from
Viropharma & Firazyr from Shire.


Bottom line here: This stock is on the verge of a major breakout as sales indicate this is another underdiagnosed
Orphan opportunity.

Author’s reply »  The patient count of 300 was provided by the very scientists working on Aegerion's drug.
That prevalence number was also used by Nobel prize winners. I had/have nothing to do with that estimate --
I'm following the facts.


If the Nobel prize winners are correct with the number 300, and if AEGR is promoting the drug to 3,000
candidates, this could constitute an off-label risk and prompt serious regulatory scrutiny. And indeed the
department of justice is investigating them: search AEGR news for the subpoena.

Matt's had it explained to him plenty of times by me -and others- that the "very scientists working on Aegerion's drug"
were never working to determine the number of HoFH patients (& did not work for AEGR approval - the patent holder
filed before AEGR existed and those on the study just tested it - they didn't try to get the drug approved for AEGR).
Instead, they were listing the reported '300 in the U.S' ("1:1M") - a number which has been in medical books for
decades. At first with Matt, there was a lack of pharmaceutical pipeline process understanding here, which takes time
for anyone to understand. Yet I feel he's, certainly, been educated now of what he didn't comprehend here, but he still
seems to pretend he doesn't get it. I guess that's the life of a short seller. However, it doesn't change the fact $AEGR
had ~400 U.S. patients (as of Dec '13) ...almost three months ago.

Author’s reply »  And I've responded to you. 
1. If you feel that the number in the scientific community is incorrect, you need to take this up with the
scientists, not me. The number 300 is still used by scientists today. If it needs updating, why don't you contact
them and have them subject their data and analyses to peer review? 
2. If the Nobel Prize winners and AEGR scientists are correct with 300, then a sales method and promotion
toward a number greater than 300 puts AEGR at risk of off-label promotion. THE GREATER THE NUMBER,
THE GREATER THE RISK.

There is reason for the Department of Justice investigation of AEGR's marketing practices, what do you think
that is?

PS: The author's source for issues of higher HoFH prevalence is a Danish study from 1979 and the Noble Prize
reference from 1985. Genetic prevalence fluctuates and this drug treats people with the HoFH phenotype (or
symptoms), since there are probably many new genetic variations. Yet why would he be so set against $AEGR? Oh
yeah - don't forget, he's shorting the stock (and unlike CEO Marc Beer, a short seller is much less accountable to
regulatory bodies for what he says). Food for thought.

Author’s reply »  You don't defeat an argument by declaring how long it's lasted the test of time, but by
providing new and conclusive information.


Of course I'm short AEGR. I investigated it and, given the facts presented here, believe AEGR has mislead
investors.
