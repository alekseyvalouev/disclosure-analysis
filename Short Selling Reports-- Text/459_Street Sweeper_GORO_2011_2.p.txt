Gold Resource Corp Pays Execs Handsomely, Neglects Expert
Analysis

By Melissa Davis


Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) sure has raised some eyebrows with its
curious spending habits.


Over the years, GORO has splurged on plenty of things – glorified promoters for its stock,
hefty compensation for its insiders, expensive dividends for its shareholders – but the
company has regularly cut corners, adopting a downright thrifty stand, in one critical area.
Despite its evolution from a penny-stock company into a $1 billion corporation trading on a
respectable exchange, GORO has long refrained from hiring accomplished experts to
double-check the numbers that power its stock price.


For starters, as highlighted by TheStreetSweeper in a big investigative report already,
GORO has yet to invest in a standard feasibility study that would replace its own bullish
production estimates with formally established gold and silver reserves. The company has
taken a frugal approach on other key services as well, records indicate, saving additional
money (while further limiting outside scrutiny) by relying on a cheap auditor and a part-
time CFO to oversee its books. In fact, records show, GORO spent more on the
boardroom director who chairs its audit and compensation committees – identified as a
“promoter” in outside corporate filings -- than it did on its auditor or its CFO last year.


Still, GORO has long rewarded the relatives who serve as its top executives with the
biggest compensation packages of all. The company doubled the six-figure salaries for all
three of those relatives last year, and then further sweetened the deal by issuing them
“discretionary” bonuses equal to their newly expanded salaries. GORO spent more than
$2.3 million in cash last year on those three executives, who scored another $12.5 million
by dumping stock (most of it at much higher prices than those seen today) during a
massive insider selling spree that began just a few months after they snagged their
handsome raises.


Jason Reid, the son of CEO William Reid and the nephew of Vice President David Reid,
walked away with two new fancy titles as well. He became president of the company last
July, when GORO finally launched commercial gold production after numerous delays,
and then joined his father (the chairman) on the board before the year came to an end.

5/22/2018 Gold Resource Corp Pays Execs Handsomely, Neglects Expert Analysis - Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/294092-gold-resource-corp-pays-execs-handsomely-neglects-expert-analysis 2/14


GORO welcomed Jason Reid to the company back in May of 2006, records show, when
the junior miner hired him to serve as its “corporate development assistant” and issued
him 600,000 stock options (vesting immediately and priced at just $1 a share) upon
appointing him to that new post. He exercised all of those options over the course of the
next few years, without officially reporting a single stock sale during that period, and
scored a fresh batch of options – plus his first major promotion – along the way.


GORO named Jason Reid vice president of the company in 2008, assigning him the same
rank always afforded to his uncle (an original founder) over the years, and then followed
up with a notable move that still stands out today. That spring, records show, GORO
actually hired an accomplished industry veteran to fill a key management post at the
company. Specifically, in a feat loudly celebrated by management at the time, GORO lured
Reynaldo Jimenez Salazar away from Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) – one of the largest players
in the industry -- to oversee the operation of its own Mexican gold mine.


“The mining industry’s workforce is a competitive environment, and we are pleased to
have such an experienced professional join Gold Resource Corporation,” CEO William
Reid gushed when announcing the appointment. “We believe Mr. Salazar’s joining Gold
Resource as a key member of our management team speaks well of the potential of
GRC’s flagship El Aguila project.”


GORO soon found itself hunting for a new project manager, however, with Salazar
changing his mind – and sticking with giant Goldcorp instead – just a month after the
junior miner proudly announced his appointment to that crucial management post.
Although GORO quickly located a replacement and later went a step further by hiring a
countrywide manager for all of its projects in Mexico, records show, the company
continued to rely exclusively on members of the Reid family to fill every position on its tiny
full-time executive team.


Jason Reid currently ranks as the second-highest executive of the company, records
show, even though he arrived on the scene with a relatively thin resume. He holds a
degree in anthropology (rather than geology, engineering or business administration),
records show, and spent a decade running a tiny fencing/construction firm before joining
his relatives at GORO and following them into its exclusive executive suite. Notably,
Internet records indicate his original company (known first as Reid Fencing and later as
Reid Farrier) lost its corporate registration the year after he changed jobs, and reportedly
operated with a two-person staff at last count.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/294092-gold-resource-corp-pays-execs-handsomely-neglects-expert-analysis 3/14


For its part, however, GORO proudly trumpets the credentials held by the youngest
executive and director of the family-led mining company:


“Prior to joining the company, Jason was the founder and president of two successful
businesses he ran for 13 years,” GORO has stated publicly. “Our board believes that
Jason Reid’s experience founding and operating his own business, as well as his
significant participation in the development of business strategy and decision-making for
our company over the past several years, provides him with the appropriate experience
and qualifications to serve as a member of our board.”


Since 2008, when GORO first promoted Jason Reid to an executive position, the company
has given him $2.16 million in cash and stock options for his service to the company.
Despite his new role as president, however, he actually ranked as the lowest-paid member
of the company’s full-time executive team last year. But thanks to his big raise and hefty
bonus, records show, he still made almost twice as much the company’s auditor and its
CFO combined. GORO failed to answer questions for this story.


Hall of Shame


From the day it first surfaced as a brand-new penny stock five years ago, records show,
GORO has always counted on StarkSchenkein (formerly Stark Winter Schenkein) – a
favorite among fly-by-night companies in the microcap space – to audit its financial
statements. StarkSchenkein has otherwise catered almost exclusively to hopeless penny-
stock companies, records indicate, which languish on the OTC Bulletin Board or the lowly
Pink Sheets if they’re lucky enough to keep on trading at all.


At least three obscure companies backed by Bill M. Conrad – the chairman of GORO’s
own audit committee – rank as past clients of StarkSchenkein, historical records show,
including two companies that officially indentified Conrad as a “promoter” when they
operated under different names. One of those companies also shared a part-time finance
officer with GORO for years, records show, before wooing him away this spring with a
permanent job offer despite its more limited resources. That company – which actually
dismissed StarkSchenkein as its auditor well ahead of its own move to a larger stock
exchange --looks like a resounding success, however, compared to the crowd of disasters
that have surfaced on the firm’s client list over the years.


Take Skyway Communications, for example, a notorious microcap outfit that hired
StarkSchenkein in mid-2004 after the company’s previous auditor resigned in the middle
of an alleged pump-and-dump scheme. Less than a year later, records show, Skyway
wound up with more nominations for so-called “Scammy Awards” than any other company

5/22/2018 Gold Resource Corp Pays Execs Handsomely, Neglects Expert Analysis - Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/294092-gold-resource-corp-pays-execs-handsomely-neglects-expert-analysis 4/14


that landed on that shameful list. Skyway walked away with two of those dubious honors
(including “Worst Overall Scam of 2004”), records show, finally scaring away
StarkSchenkein, which expressed a newfound doubt in management at that point.


Despite the fresh stain on StarkSchenkein’s record, however, GORO soon embraced that
same firm as its own auditor of choice. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
has conducted at least two formal inspections of StarkSchenkein since then, records
show, and released horrible reviews of the firm on both occasions. The first report, issued
when GORO still traded on a penny-stock exchange like other StarkSchenkein clients,
revealed major deficiencies in all four audits the PCAOB reviewed. The second report, this
one published after GORO had already “uplisted” to a major stock exchange, identified
significant deficiencies in five out of seven of the audits inspected by the PCAOB when it
returned to check on the firm’s progress a few years later.


Just months after that second disturbing PCAOB report, records show, GORO
nevertheless chose to retain StarkSchenkein – with the unanimous support of its audit
committee – to serve as its independent auditing firm once again. GORO spent a mere
$37,000 on its latest audit, a figure that has barely risen (from $31,750) in recent years,
while its competitors – sporting similar market values and trading on the exact same stock
exchange – typically pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for Big Four auditors to verify
the accuracy of their financial statements instead.


Moreover, when TheStreetSweeper reviewed a list of public companies that currently
identify StarkSchenkein as their outside auditing firm, GORO jumped off that short page.
While many of the firm’s past clients have long since disappeared, records indicate,
StarkSchenkein still serves as the auditor for about 15 public companies at the present
time. Excluding GORO, records show, all of those clients rank as microcap companies
that trade – most of them for a nickel or less – on penny-stock exchanges.


Coincidentally, records show, the most valuable of those microcap companies,Santa Fe
Gold (SFEB.OB), operates in the mining space as well. Unlike GORO, however, Santa Fe
sports a modest market value ($83.4 million) and a low stock price (88 cents a share)
despite its own celebrated status as a young but growing commercial gold producer.


Compared to GORO, in fact, Santa Fe looks downright poor. Despite its limited revenue
and meager cash balance (less than $175,000 at last count), however, Santa Fe
somehow found enough money for a feasibility study that allowed the company to at least
establish some probable reserves.

5/22/2018 Gold Resource Corp Pays Execs Handsomely, Neglects Expert Analysis - Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/294092-gold-resource-corp-pays-execs-handsomely-neglects-expert-analysis 5/14


Although both companies use the same cheap auditing firm, records show, GORO paid
StarkSchenkein about half as much (on average) as Santa Fe did for the most recent
audits it received. GORO actually spent far more money on extra “audit-related” services
than it did on its mandatory audit last year, corporate filings reveal, even though most
public companies abandoned that risky practice following the notorious collapse of Enron
and Arthur Andersen about a decade ago.


For its part, StarkSchenkein initially told TheStreetSweeper that it would try to answer
questions for this story but -- after seeking permission from GORO to grant that interview -
- apparently changed its mind in the end.


Meanwhile, corporate filings indicate, GORO has never employed a full-time finance chief
at all. For years, records show, GORO kept appointing Frank “Monty” Jennings to serve
as its CFO on a part-time basis (paid by the hour) instead. GORO clearly saved some
money in the process, records show, with its CFO receiving a fraction of the salary -- and
none of the stock -- awarded to the three relatives on its full-time executive team.


Jennings spent five years at that part-time job before he finally resigned this spring,
records show, when he landed a full-time position at an obscure energy company that
counts the chairman of GORO’s audit committee among the members of its own board.


After that, records indicate, GORO found a way to further reduce its costs. For the next
two months, a period that would see GORO report its first quarterly profit ever, William
Reid – already doubling as chairman and CEO at the time -- stepped forward to assume
yet another critical role at the company. He temporarily served as interim CFO, despite his
lack of documented accounting experience, until GORO located another CFO willing to
work for the company on a part-time basis.


‘Men Who Make Mistakes’


In contrast, corporate filings show, GORO has always rewarded Conrad – the longtime
chairman of both its audit and compensation committees – quite well over the years.


Conrad launched a string of ill-fated penny-stock companies before he finally hit the
jackpot in mid-2006, historical historical records show, when he landed a boardroom seat
at GORO that now looks like the most lucrative -- by far -- of his entire career. Conrad
helped take GORO public shortly after he joined the company’s board, records indicate,
and soon wound up as the lucky owner of 100,000 shares of the miner’s brand-new stock

5/22/2018 Gold Resource Corp Pays Execs Handsomely, Neglects Expert Analysis - Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/294092-gold-resource-corp-pays-execs-handsomely-neglects-expert-analysis 6/14


and cheap options to purchase another 500,000 shares. By its first anniversary as a public
company, records show, GORO had almost quadrupled in price and pushed the value of
those 600,000 shares to roughly $2 million.


In total, records indicate, GORO has issued Conrad the equivalent of 850,000 shares of
stock (including options) for his service to the company over the years. If Conrad still
owned all of that stock, records suggest, he would be sitting on a paper fortune worth
$16.8 million right now.


Instead, records show, Conrad chose to cash out most of his options by the end of 2009 –
when the highflying stock had barely reached half its current price – and wound up
sacrificing the gigantic, if unforeseen, gains that followed in the process. By the time that
GORO filed its latest proxy statement this spring, corporate records show, Conrad held
just 407,500 shares of company stock (most of that in the form of unexercised stock
options) – or at least 442,500 shares fewer than the total he had received – even though
he has publicly reported the sale of just 45,000 shares of that stock instead.


Conrad scored more than $1 million on the sales he did report, records indicate, dumping
all of those shares at better prices – ranging from almost $25 at the low end to more than
$30 at the high – than the stock, at $21.47, currently fetches today. Even with his stake in
the company dwindling, however, Conrad could net another $7.8 million (if GORO
maintains its current price) by cashing in the stock and options that he still holds.


Conrad did not respond to a message from TheStreetSweeper seeking input for this story.


Despite his big windfall from GORO (both realized and potential), records show, Conrad is
now pursuing yet another venture in the penny-stock arena where he has operated
throughout most of his career. This August, just as GORO began its recent dive, “Liquid
Spins” – an obscure company listing Conrad among its boardroom directors and its largest
shareholders – filed a registration statement revealing plans to go public on the OTC
Bulletin Board (like GORO and other Conrad-backed companies before it) and become a
brand-new penny stock.


Liquid Spins boldly claims that it “developed the concept” of lyrical greetings cards, even
though regular Hallmark stores have been selling similar cards quite successfully for
years. Perhaps sensing that formidable competition, the company recently decided to
adjust its business model. Specifically, records show, Liquid Spins is now banking on an
exclusive agreement with the former lead singer of Little Texas – a group that disbanded
more than a decade ago – to somehow distinguish itself and give the company a better
shot at success.

Comments (20)


Originally known as Malemark, records show, the company first tried to carve its own
niche in the greeting card market by simply targeting an unusual audience. When
Malemark launched operations in 2009, records show, the company initially hoped to
capture a brand-new market by creating standard greeting cards (minus the tunes) for
“Men Who Make Mistakes.”


If nothing else, history suggests, that company could theoretically attract business from
investors who purchase stock in outfits backed by Conrad (including some recent buyers
of GORO itself) and then later wind up with a deep sense of regret. But they better hurry,
records indicate, because Malemark has already reported the disposal of its website –
writing off that entire investment due to tepid greeting card sales – although the site still
seems to operate, despite that write-down, at the present time.


For now, at least, the company (like other Conrad-led ventures before it) is still trying to
reinvent itself. Although it has yet to even go public, records show, the young company is
already chasing a brand-new rainbow – just pretty enough to woo future investors –
toward its own magical, but potentially elusive, pot of gold.


Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this article, TheStreetSweeper established a new
short position in GORO with the intention of profiting on future declines in the stock price.
Since Aug. 31, TheStreetSweeper has sold short a total of 40,506 shares of GORO at an
average price of $22.08 a share. It repurchased 3,389 shares due to a forced buy-in on
Sept. 15 before this story appeared. Going forward, TheStreetSweeper may choose to
adjust its investment in GORO -- by increasing, decreasing or covering its short position --
and will promptly disclose the details of any future trades as they occur.


As a matter of policy, TheStreetSweeper prohibits members of its editorial staff from taking
financial positions in the companies that they cover. To contact Melissa Davis, the editor of

Wow, you think this article might be influenced by the FACT that the person who runs Streetsweeper is Hunter
Adams, a felon previously convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, money laundering and racketeering
stemming from his participation in "pump-and-dump" stock schemes and his ties to the Gambino organized crime
family, Oh, and a current 40k+ share short position in GORO?

I can not be positive but I believe the author of this little spin job of an article is involved in many other "short raids" of
many other companies. Some of these coordinated raids have resulted in lawsuits based on slander and outright lies. 
The markets are full of people who make a living off slander and deceit,pure and simple.

Classic follow up to your busted allegations from yesterday. Complete and abject failure; now the icing on the cake
would be an SEC investigation into the practices of slandering a company in which you have a short position for
material gain. I for one will, for the first time in my career investing in micro/small caps, contact the SEC in the hopes
that they investigate your fraudulent practices.


Oh yeah...those shorts you have, underwater. Have fun squeezee.

preparing a 43-101 just to shut up all these wannabes.


I am loading up my 2.7% AND RISING dividend GORO on this bout of weakness and preparing to collect gold and
silver coins as the dividend in kind policy is put in place. God, can you imagine the cash flow per share once they get
to 100,150,200k ozs at ZERO cost thanks to the ultra high grade byproduct? What will the dividend be then???!!!


These boiler room shorts can go find gold and silver coins to mail me every month.


I am long GORO since $3.86. In future years, I will receive annual shipments of gold bullion represent a HUGE yield
on my initial investment. GORO has been one of my best performers in this gold/silver bull market and still trading at
low P/CF valuation.

SeekingAlpha is just TRASH for promoting this kind of TRASH journalism. The GORO rebuttal says it all:
Streetsweeper is a website run by a convicted felon with a history of financial fraud and "pump and dump" scams. He
is also a member of the Gambino crime syndicate.. This website's business model is to take short positions and post
articles that crap all over a company. What a bunch of effing scumbags and freaks. Everywhere you look today - THE
YELLOW PRESS IS ALIVE! W R Hearst would be proud.


I think its funny the guy is only short 40,000 shares. What a lightweight. He can't buy mine to cover.

Gold Resource Corporation Responds to "The Street Sweeper's" Recent Articles 
finance.yahoo.com/news...


COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Sept. 16, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to multiple negative pieces published by
a website known as thestreetsweeper.org, the management of Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE Amex: GORO)
believes the Company is being targeted by individuals or groups holding short positions in its securities in an effort to
manipulate the Company's stock price.


The Company's management is advising its shareholders and potential investors to consider the source of these
articles. Thestreetsweeper.org website is run by an individual named Hunter Adams, a felon previously convicted of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, money laundering and racketeering stemming from his participation in "pump-
and-dump" stock schemes and his ties to the Gambino organized crime family. While the site purports to be a
financial investigatory website, it appears its operations are financed by profits generated from taking short positions
in the stock of companies it profiles. As a result, the profiles it generates are neither balanced nor unbiased. The
website disclosed it has held various short positions in the Company's stock since it first published a piece on the
Company last month. Its most recent short position disclosure reveals it is currently short 40,506 shares. Any investor
or potential investor interested in learning more about the website, its personnel and its questionable journalistic
ethics can do so by reading an article published by the American Journalism Review at www.ajr.org/article.as....


With respect to the thestreetsweeper.org's piece published on September 15, 2011, the Company reiterates that it has
publicly disclosed compensation information for its executive officers in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since becoming a public company in 2006. The Company's named
executive officers received salary increases approved by the Board of Director's compensation committee in 2010 on

5/22/2018 Gold Resource Corp Pays Execs Handsomely, Neglects Expert Analysis - Gold Resource Corporation (NYSEMKT:GORO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/294092-gold-resource-corp-pays-execs-handsomely-neglects-expert-analysis 12/14


the basis of achieving the goal of getting its flagship mineral project into commercial production and this fact is
discussed in the Company's proxy statement filed with the SEC in April 2011. At the Company's most recent annual
meeting held on June 21, 2011, shareholders approved the say-on-pay proposal concerning the Company's
compensation policies and practices casting 99% of the votes in favor of the proposal.


As is typical during the start-up phase of operations, key personnel received grants of stock and non-qualified stock
options as part of their compensation package in order to preserve working capital and align management's
incentives with that of its shareholders. One key fact that the article fails to mention during its sensationalistic
discussion of Jason Reid's and Bill Conrad's option exercises and subsequent stock sales is that the options granted
in 2006 expired in 2009, which forced these individuals to exercise the options or lose them. The article also fails to
take into account the potential individual income tax burden that typically results with the exercise of in-the-money,
non-qualified stock options which may have factored into the subsequent share sales.


Furthermore, the Company was not subject to the insider reporting requirements mandated by Section 16 of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) until it registered under the Exchange Act with the SEC in
August 2010. Once a company is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, insiders are required to report
transactions in the company's stock to the SEC within two days of the transaction. The lack of insider stock sale
reports filed with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 or 5 prior to August 2010 is not a regulatory deficiency or an attempt to
mislead the public regarding insider share sales. Information regarding insider holdings have been available to the
public in the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K and various registration statements filed with the SEC each
year since going public in 2006. The continuous attempt to paint these circumstances as something unforthcoming or
sinister is disingenuous. Since becoming subject to the Exchange Act rules in August 2010, the Company's insiders
have diligently complied with Section 16 and timely filed their reports with the SEC—a fact that is also discussed in
the Company's proxy statement.


The Board of Directors of the Company continues to fully support Jason Reid and Bill Conrad as part of the Gold
Resource team and StarkSchenkein, LLP as its independent registered public accounting firm. Since joining the
Company, Mr. Reid has worked his way up to executive management and was recently re-elected as a director of the
Company by shareholders voting 94% in favor. Mr. Conrad is an independent, long-standing member of the Board of
Directors who spent significant time and effort developing corporate governance and overseeing management since
joining the board, and was also recently re-elected to the board by 94% of the votes cast. As a non-management
member of the board, Mr. Conrad is free to pursue outside business interests unrelated to the Company. The
Company's financial statements audited by StarkSchenkein have been filed with and reviewed by the SEC and have
not been restated. In a consistent application of its unbalanced view of the facts, the article is quick to point out the
deficiency comments StarkSchenkein received during its regular PCAOB review, yet fails to mention that nearly all
public accounting firms, including the Big Four firms for which the Company is criticized for not engaging, received
similar comments from the PCAOB.


Finally, in response to the assertion that the Company failed to answer questions or refused to allow StarkSchenkein
to answer questions, the record should reflect that the Company and its auditors were provided less than 24 hours
from the time of first contact until the piece was published. Regardless, the Company's management will not
participate in an interview with anyone associated with this website, or any similar website, that negatively profiles
companies while the site's backers take a short position in the stock of those companies.

I guess the cops are winning and the robbers losing this go round. Unless a position was taken before the 8th around
$22.99 high and up to day prior posting, 15th @ $22.25 high? Melissa and the Bandits are losing big time now at $23.
Prollly best to go catch criminal elements like themselves to finance the biz now on? Hard to cheat honest folk! First
lesson in investigative journalism,Melissa. Perhaps should repeat the course? Or even take it?


Today 321gold did post GRC's reply but has been a long time between shoes. Now just sparmy, not slimy stuff there.

Closed out the 20,120 margin buys, $445,758.60, avg $22.155 with today's 4,712 sale @ $22.81 11:53- 11:56 AM.
Trust Act. now has no margin debt so unusable for short borrow, supported PPS down to final $21.50 ask and cleared
408 permanent shares.Along way took all 20,120 .05 dividends for Friday as an extra $1006 to take even more
GORO. I believe that's the proper approach just as Jason feels performance not headless chicken race is what does
the trick. Any notice the sky isn't falling and the dumbness of the attack gave ALL ability to gather fresh golden eggs
thus far is all's happened. Just always need to ask the same old question. When do numbskulls EVER learn? EA

Other words, Street Sweeper Selling Self Short Seems Sorta Serious Sounding ( fill own 10th allit.) while I meself
have profited well  
selling long at least the same 40K or so margin buys as they have sold shorted if true. Why believe a convicted thief?
Meilssa, that's reporter's RULE ONE! I'd find another piggy bank. This one's gone to market eating rare roast beef! EA
