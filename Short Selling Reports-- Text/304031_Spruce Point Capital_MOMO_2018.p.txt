Correcting The Momo Misperception Through 
China-Based Investigative Research

View


Momo


Trader View

China-Based 


Forensic 


Research View


A “momo play” is trading vernacular used to represent a momentum trading opportunity. In a momo trade, the 
investor is not interested in the company's fundamentals, but rather, the stock’s very short-term price movements.  
Alongside of swing traders, who hold positions for days or weeks, these investors are focused on stock technicals 
and news flows, and have little regard for fundamentals and risks given their holding period.  Momo’s stock is a 
poster child for these types of investors with 12.5k StockTwits followers  


Leading mobile based open social networking and entertainment platform in China.  Momo’s platform focuses on 
allowing users to discover (anonymous) connections and build interactions through video, audio, chat and games.  
Momo’s monetization model is focused on facilitating virtual gifting, user subscriptions and marketing.   The 
Company’s historical financial performance has been driven by “blowout” results in Live Video (think webcam / 
Instagram live plus online/offline American Idol) and is expected to continue as a result of the professionalization of 
Live Video, broad user growth and additional engagement/monetization strategies.   Momo recently acquired Tantan, 
a yet to be proven Chinese version of Tinder, for $735m 


Spruce Point and its China-based investigator has spent months doing primary forensic research into 


Momo, Inc. (Nasdaq: MOMO or “the Company”) and sees $23 to $32/sh, 30% to 50% downside risk. Momo’s investor base is 


compromised of two distinct cohorts, fundamental investors taking management’s word at face value and momentum/swing 


traders trying to play the stock’s trend.  Both of these groups are oblivious to the serious risks underpinning a Momo investment.


Momo selectively reveals / conceals material disclosures from investors and is diverting attention from new 
challenges in Live Video. For example, Momo did not disclose SAIC charges of “Filing corporate information with the 
intent to conceal the truth and falsify” in Nov 2017. This may explain why three Momo directors resigned the same 
month for “personal reasons”. We have uncovered that Momo fails to disclose a web of 9 first level subsidiaries and 
114 undisclosed second level subsidiaries.  Momo also hasn’t disclosed an illegal gambling site in China. Lastly, our 
investigation finds that Momo owns at least two undisclosed talent agencies, evidence of related party dealing and 
disclosed related-party dealings don’t reconcile with local China filings. When visiting the registered business 
address of Beijing Mushang Culture Media, one of Momo’s top five agencies, we found a residential building with a 
door that said “home delivery, just walk in” – raising the potential for fabricated operations.

Framing The Diligence Challenges And Risks of 
A Momo Investment


• Momo’s current investor base is primarily comprised of U.S. retail investors and a select number of institutions, 
almost exclusively in small position sizes, looking to play the recently white hot China live streaming space through 
one of a handful of US listed companies


• If Momo were simply a North American based company selling a new technology (e.g., VR, AI), investors could 
conduct significant English based market research, evaluate the product, understand the regulatory environment and 
make an educated assessment as to whether this is a fad or the next big thing.  However, given the newness of the 
product space and the evolving nature of the competitive landscape it would still remain a speculative investment


• Additionally, if Momo were a North American based company, investors could take confidence in the fact its activities 
are likely to be transparently disclosed, fairly presented, legal and that management is acting in the best interest of 
shareholders


• Unfortunately, Momo isn’t a North American based company and this compounds the risk of an investment 
substantially.  Momo is a China based media company, offering a Mandarin based product to Chinese consumers and 
conducting business under the oversight of the MOC and SARFT.  In order to credibly understand trends in this 
foreign market, an investor must conduct the same level of company,  industry and regulatory diligence in 
Mandarin that one would conduct in English.  Anything short of this is simply a gamble


• When making a Chinese based VIE investment, the emphasis placed on performing forensic research into 
governance, ownership, the legality of operations and related party transactions takes on much greater importance 
than a comparable North American investment given different corporate governance practices in China.  Spruce 
Point doesn’t believe that an appreciation for the risks of a Chinese VIE based investment can be achieved without 
thorough diligence of the VIE structure and its subsidiaries


The diligence and risk potential of a China based investment operating under a VIE structure is materially 


different from a comparable North American investment, and Chinese investments outside of a VIE structure.  


As a result, a diligence process focused on conducting forensic financial analysis is a necessity.

Retail Investors At A Large Disadvantage In 
Owning Momo Stock As A Foreign Company


Spruce Point believes Momo is a heavily retail-owned company, and its shareholders are at a disadvantage 


thanks to exemptions Momo uses as a foreign private issuer.


Provision 
Exemption


Implications for MOMO Investors


The rules under the 
Exchange Act 
requiring the filing of 
quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q or current 
reports on Form 8-K 
with the SEC


The SEC put these forms in place to facilitate better informed investors.  
The absence of these reports potentially puts all investors in the dark 
regarding the financial condition of the entity (e.g., MD&A), changes of
internal controls and legal or regulatory proceedings. 


Key example: Momo failed to notify investors that the SAIC charged its 
operating VIE with “Filing corporate information with the intent to 
conceal the truth and falsify”. 


The Sections of the 
Exchange Act 
requiring insiders to 
file public reports of 
their stock ownership 
and trading activities 
and liability for 
insiders who profit 
from trades made in a 
short period of time


Retail investors are disadvantaged because Momo does not file 
traditional Form 4 disclosures when insiders sell stock. Form 4’s must be 
filed within 2 business days.


Key example:  Momo has filed numerous Form 144s, which are not 
required to be filed electronically. Momo’s Form 144s come by snail mail, 
which can extend public notification time (eg. To the right of 1 week). 
We find that Momo insiders have sold $300m of stock YTD


The selective 
disclosure rules by 
issuers of material 
nonpublic 
information under 
Regulation FD


Momo retail investors could receive material information (by accident or 
otherwise) only after it has been disclosed to its securities analysts, and 
then communicated to select institutional investors.  Institutions privy to 
the information beforehand are able to make a profit or avoid a loss at 
the expense of retail investors

Disturbing Momo Findings From Spruce Point’s 
Forensic Diligence Suggest 30% – 50% Downside


• In order to develop a full appreciation of the business case and financial risks of a Momo investment, Spruce 
Point engaged an experienced China-based research consultant to assist in conducting ~50 detailed Mandarin 
interviews of the live stream ecosystem, and a forensic analysis of Momo’s VIE operations and financials

Forensic Analysis of China Filings 
and Transactions


• Our primary industry and company research suggests that the China live video space is maturing, and that it 
will likely result in lower market share and higher cost of revenue for Momo over time. As a result, we expect 
growth to disappoint relative to current expectations. Meaningful elements of Momo’s “brand” of live 
streaming are also squarely in the crosshair of regulators.  This variant point of view alone suggests a lower stock 
price for Momo 


• However, the true risk of this investment resides in myriad, potentially catastrophic, red flags identified from 
our forensic analysis. We believe that Momo’s multiple will materially rerate to 13x-15x, the bottom end of the 
range since the introduction of live streaming, and that the Company’s operations and financial performance 
could also be impacted by regulatory actions

Momo’s Capital Structure And Valuation


Momo is a $8 billion China technology company trading near an all-time high share price given recent “blowout” 


results of its Live Video business. Shares might appear cheap given its blistering reported revenue and earnings 


growth. However, this view is predicated on taking management’s story at face value and turning a blind eye to a 


multitude of concerning red flags highlighted in this report.  


The nature of Momo’s disclosures around the funding of the Tantan acquisition should serve as yet another to 


investors.  Investors were to assume that the deal was to be funded out of cash flows until the convertible bond 


was announced 6/25/18 for $650m and the bank loan facility disclosed.  The convertible, unlike a cash payment, 


now potentially puts shareholders at risk of future dilution.

Spruce Point Has Significant Concerns Regarding 
Multiple Red Flags Identified At Momo


Undisclosed Charges of “Filing Corporate Information With the Intent To Conceal The Truth and Falsify” Against 
Beijing Momo By the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) in China.  This Announcement 
Coincided With The Resignation of Three Momo Directors For “Personal Reasons”


• In November 2017 Momo’s VIE, Beijing Momo, was charged by the SAIC with “Filing corporate information with the 
intent to conceal the truth and falsify”.  Beijing Momo’s corrected filings changed entities, suggest overstated operating 
profits, and changed the timing of Purple Sky/Matrix transfer of ownership from Tang Yan to Momo (BVI Company)


• On November 24th, 2017, Momo directors Ms. Sichuan Zhang, Mr. Feng Yu and Mr. Joseph Tsai resigned 


Spruce Point Has Identified A Significant Number of Undisclosed Momo VIE Subsidiaries. It Is Uncommon For A 
U.S. Listed Company To Fail To Disclose The Subsidiaries (Subs) of Its VIE 


• The Company discloses that its VIE, Beijing Momo has 6 first level subsidiaries and 1 second level subsidiary.  However, 
Spruce Point has discovered that Momo has 9 undisclosed first level subs and 114 undisclosed second level subs 


• Undisclosed entities, particularly Limited Partnerships (of which Momo has several), provide the opportunity for the 
legal management of the Company to extract benefits for themselves or hide the true nature of the operations


Spruce Point believes that anyone holding, or considering, an investment in Momo must get comfortable with 


the risks and unknown ramifications associated with the following red flags.  We believe that all of these items 


are unbeknownst to current investors and most (where relevant) to government officials.


Spruce Point Has Determined That Momo Owns At Least Two Undisclosed Talent Agencies And Is Engaging In 
Related Party Transactions 


• The unusual nature of these agencies financial statements and discrepancies with Momo’s 20-F call into question 
the integrity of Deloitte’s audit of VIE subs and raise the potential that talent agencies are serving other purposes 
(e.g., money laundering)


• Based on our investigators findings, we believe that one of Momo’s top 5 agencies (Beijing Mushang Culture Media) 
is partially owned by Momo, operating from an address different from its registered address, and likely illegally 
employing people without legal entities in other “branches”
11


Spruce Point Has Significant Concerns Regarding 
Multiple Red Flags Identified At Momo (Cont’d)


Acquisition of Tantan Doesn’t Appear To Make Much Sense From A Strategic Or Valuation Perspective.  The 
Insertion of Several Limited Partnerships Into The Ownership of Tantan VIE Shortly Before Deal Execution Also 
Seems Unusual.  Spruce Point Believes That It Has Uncovered Pre-IPO Transactions That Would Suggest 
Management May Have A History of Enriching Insiders    


• Spruce Point believes Momo overpaid when it purchased Tantan in Feb 2018 for $735 million ($600.9 million in cash and 
5.3 million A class ordinary shares).  The Tantan Series D financing in June 2017 valued it at $320 million (source) and it 
is expected to do $4.5 million in revenue for the month of June 18 (Q1‘18 Earnings) (zero revenues prior). It is not clear, 
why Tantan’s valuation increased by 130% in approximately 8 months between the Series D round and acquisition


• One theory is that Momo needed to use the cash it could not get out of China, a metric it ceased reporting after the 
Q3’16 earnings call, and something we believe has risen materially since. Momo acquired the Tantan VIE with RMB cash 
in China.  On October 25th, 2017 three equity LPs became shareholders of the Tantan VIE.  It’s possible that the newly 
added limited partnerships were put in place immediately before the transaction to hide who actually got paid the cash


• In early 2012, Matrix and Purple Sky became the first two outside investors (~10% each) in Momo via the Momo VIE.  
Both companies would later enter into a series of transactions with Momo and other investors that mysteriously 
indicate that both parties independently owned the entirety of Series A-1 shares, something that we are unable to 
resolve.  This raises the obvious question of whether one or both of these companies were used to reward insiders in 
advance of the IPO 


Spruce Point Has Also Determined Another Undisclosed VIE Has Invested In, And Possibly Operated, An Illegal 
Onshore Gambling Site That Was Shutdown Earlier This Year 


• Spruce Point research suggests Momo has invested via an undisclosed VIE, and was possibly operating, a very popular and 
highly rated illegal gambling operation (Pokermaster 德扑圈) in China.  It was exposed by CCTV in February 2018 and has 
now been shut down  


• It just so happens that Momo CEO, Tang Yan, is a well known poker player and gambler.  We expect this discovery to 
garner significant interest from the Chinese government


• Momo has not disclosed the revenue and/or earnings contribution to investors from Pokermaster and we haven’t been 
able to determine the full impact. This raises concerns that management is using shareholder funds for self-interested 
purposes, and could be enhancing recent financial results with these activities

Spruce Point Has Significant Concerns Regarding 
Multiple Red Flags Identified At Momo (Cont’d)


Recent Key Performance Metrics And Financial Results Are In Disagreement With Industry Data And Feedback 
From Detailed Interviews With Live Streaming Talent Agents


• Momo’s management recently reported record Monthly Active Users (“MAU”) for Q1 2018.  However, Analysys and 
QuestMobile data indicate that live stream industry MAU peaked six to twelve months back, and that Momo’s MAU is well 
below stated levels, and potentially in decline (per Analysys).  Interestingly, Momo has a risk factor to discuss discrepancies 
between internal and external reported user data


• The revenues of Beijing Mushang Culture Media, an undisclosed Momo talent agency, would seem to suggest that Momo has 
been much more dependent on agencies than previously portrayed.  This calls into question the legitimacy and efficacy of 
the “shift” in strategy towards agencies


• During the recent Q1‘18 earnings call, Momo management also explained away a decrease in cost of revenues by stating that 
strength in non-event day revenue resulted in “scaled back the revenue oriented operating efforts around the quarterly 
competition event. Therefore, cost on bonus or rewards offered to broadcasters during the March tournament, was 
significantly reduced.”  


• Spruce Point’s research consultant specifically asked 11 agencies, including a Momo owned agency, if there was any change 
in tournament payouts, and was consistently told there was no such reduction in revenue or incentive removal to 
agency/broadcasters. Additionally, the agencies all acknowledged the impression that the costs of advertising and running 
the tournament this year had gone up substantially from last year


Recent Regulations Focused On Content Are Likely To Hit Elements of Momo’s “Brand” of Live Streaming 
Particularly Hard


• New regulations were put in place during 2017 by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and the State Administration of Radio, Film 
and TV (SARFT) limiting the behavior of live streamers and raising accountability for platforms.  Agents mentioned that 
restrictions included no midriff (area between chest and waist) exposure, no filming on beds and limited cleavage, to name just 
a few.  Implementation of these rules has only recently been enforced with many sanctions since February 2018


• Based on countless hours we’ve spent viewing Momo’s website, it appears that Momo has limited interest/capability in 
shutting down violators of these policies and that these same performers are often the most recommended/viewed 
performers outside of competitions


• However, there is no need to take our word for it. Four of the agencies that we spoke with gave the unsolicited opinion that 
Momo has a reputation as a (sex) cam site.  We believe that this has directly contributed to Momo’s advertising woes
13


Fundamental Challenges On The Horizon For 
Momo’s Live Video Segment


Despite Management’s Wishes Otherwise, Momo Remains A Live Video Company


• As of Q1’18, 85% of Momo’s revenue was attributable to Live Video and Live Video’s ARPPU was ~12x that of Value-Added 
Services “VAS” ($84 vs $7m).  Momo’s financial performance is inextricably tied to live streaming, a business with low 
barriers to entry and coming under intense competition from well funded adversaries


Momo Has a Demonstrated Track Record of Product Applications Plateauing Over Time


• Momo’s revenue growth story has been predicated on growth of monthly active users (MAU) and more importantly 
Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU).  However, the performance of Momo’s underlying products (Membership 
Subscriptions, Gaming, Marketing and Live Video) along with key performance indicators (revenues, paid users, 
revenue/MAU and paid users, respectively) have all plateaued over time


Management’s Commentary And Financial Results in Q2 and Q3 2017 Indicated Concern About The Live Video Segment And 
Prompted A Shift In Strategy Towards Agencies


• By the Q3’2017, the Live Video segment was beginning to show signs of fatigue as paying users flattened out and conversion 
of MAU to paying users was in decline.  The revenues of Live Video continued to post strong growth, but this was almost 
exclusively driven by ARPPU growth


• Management explained on the Q2‘17 earnings call it was in the best interest of the Company to transition certain live 
streaming users towards other use cases even if it meant “divert traffic from our very monetizable live streaming service to 
more newer used cases.” The justification for such a shift, “I think the key thing here is that we’ve never been positioning 
Momo as a live streaming company“


• On the Q3‘17 earnings call, Momo acknowledged new competition and industry maturation.  “At the same time, we are 
seeing bigger players with strong community ecosystems taking initiatives to upgrade their content offerings and market-
share shifting from amateur broadcasters to more professional ones”.  As well as a strategic shift towards working with 
agencies, “Historically, agencies have a limited role in Momo's life streaming ecosystem”, including “adjusting our operational 
policies to better support the high value-added agencies in traffic and other resources, as well as economic incentive”


• We remind all investors that these business changes occurred precisely around the time the SAIC charged Momo with 
“Filing corporate information with the intent to conceal the truth and falsify”, three Momo directors resigned and new 
Tantan LP entities were created

Fundamental Challenges On The Horizon For 
Momo’s Live Video Segment (Cont’d)


Undisclosed Insights Into Momo Live Video Strategy


• Fee Sharing: Momo appears to tier fee sharing with Agencies based on their size and allegiance.  Momo’s take ranges from a 
high of 60% to a low of 50% in our sample


• Free Virtual Gifts: The majority of our sample indicated that Momo didn’t provide them with free virtual gifts.  However, 
several agencies referenced what one referred to as a “commercial secret” that Momo provides free gifts based on the scale, 
ranking and exclusivity of an agency.  It is unclear how these transactions are recognized from an accounting perspective


• Cash Rebates: Several agencies discussed that they also had the option of receiving cash rebates for purchasing virtual 
currency.  It is unclear if these transactions are considered costs of revenues 


• Momo Owned Agencies: When we asked agencies about whether or not Momo controls its own agencies we got a range of 
responses from “No” to their biggest agency is their own.  Most folks “in the know” were reluctant to provide specifics, but 
indicated that this is particularly the case with some of their largest agents.  This would indicate related party transactions 
and again the accounting treatment remains unclear


Live Video Financial Impact From New Competition And Shift In Strategy 


• Momo will now face formidable new competition in the live streaming space from well funded public companies and 
private companies with the backing of Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Bytedance  


• A majority of agencies we spoke with indicated that they were experimenting with other platforms where there are 
reputations for bigger spenders (e.g., Now) or the popularity of the channel is growing rapidly (e.g., Douyin). A good 
portion of the agencies expressed some concern over Momo’s outlook and the value in diversifying platforms.  We 
expect Momo’s market share to slip over the coming 18 months


• Most of the competing platforms maintain 40%-55% of virtual currency gifting, and emerging threat Now maintains only 
30%-40%.  We expect Momo’s cost of revenues to move up materially over time to match industry levels (50%-70%)


Given the shifting nature of the Live Video strategy and very limited financial and KPI transparency for the 


segment, Spruce Point relied on 50 detailed Mandarin based interviews with members of the Live Stream 


Ecosystem (Agency/Broadcaster/Users/Advertisers) to develop a forward view of Momo’s prospects.
15


Spruce Point Believes Momo (Nasdaq: MOMO) Is 
A Strong Sell With 30%-50% Downside


Poor Risk/Reward Owning Momo While Insider Selling Intensifies And Fundamentals Are Strained


• Twenty-one analysts covering Momo have a consensus “Buy”, but with a P/E multiple in the middle of Momo’s historical 
range, they are blind to the risks of our report


• Despite deep analyst coverage, institutional holders account for only 30% of Momo’s Shares (Nasdaq).  Notably absent 
from the holders list are Large U.S. Technology Hedge Funds.  Given the plethora or retail shareholders and institutions 
holding Momo in small size, we expect that few have conducted rigorous research into the name


• Momo insiders have sold $2 billion of stock since the IPO.  Momo Executives and Directors, except for Tang Yan, are on 
pace in 2018 to sell more than 2x what they sold in 2017 ($300 million). We believe this is a negative indicator for future 
business results


• Based on Spruce Point’s detailed interviews we expect going forward to see flat to down live streaming revenues, higher 
cost of revenues and negligible mobile marketing growth.  We then apply a significantly discounted P/E multiple due to 
heightened risks surrounding the significant red flags that we’ve highlighted in this report. This brings us to a price 
target of $23 to $32/sh and represents 30%-50% downside risk


Advertising Unlikely To Pick Up Anytime Soon


• Momo’s history of crime related to the site and reputation as a “live cam site for sex and this is something it cannot wash off” 
(Agent Interview #2) will likely weigh on marketing revenues in the intermediate term


• Key Opinion Leaders (“KOL”) appear to have almost entirely abandoned Momo as a platform.  Our consultant spoke with one 
KOL agency who pools his data with other leading KOL agencies.  The pool of agencies has a total of 3,000 KOLs.  In July 
2017, 1,500 (50% of the KOLs) listed Momo as a platform they would operate on. By December 2017, that number had 
fallen to 50 KOLs or 2%


• Momo has always shied away from increasing ad load during times of product transitions.  The present shift not only 
involves new product introductions, but also involves a repositioning of the organization. “Lastly, mobile marketing business 
bottomed out in the fourth quarter, both the effective CPM and the number of that in question sold increased meaningfully 
from the third quarter. While we think there is still potential in driving further growth in eCPMs and increasing the ad world. 
We won’t get aggressive in doing so as the focus in 2018 is on building user engagement.” (Q4 ‘2017 Earnings Call)

Red Flag 1: Undisclosed Charges Against 
Momo By The SAIC


In November 2017 Beijing Momo was charged by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce 


(SAIC) with “Filing corporate information with the intent to conceal the truth and falsify”.  Beijing Momo’s 


corrected filings indicate overstated revenues / costs and changes to the timing of Purple Sky / Matrix 


transfer of ownership from CEO Tang Yan to Momo.

Red Flag 1: Three Momo Directors Resign For 
“Personal Reasons” Following SAIC Charge


The SAIC charges against Beijing Momo were filed on November 2nd, 2017 and later resolved on November 


27th, 2017.  It was during this period, on November 24th 2017, that three Momo Directors resigned for 


“personal reasons” without further elaboration. 


Recent Development - Resignations and 
Appointment of Board Directors


On November 24, 2017, each of Ms. Sichuan Zhang, Mr. Feng 
Yu and Mr. Joseph C. Tsai resigned from the Company's board 
of directors for personal reasons, effective as of the same 
date. Upon resignation of these directors, the board of 
directors of the Company consisted of six members, namely 
Mr. Yan Tang, Mr. Yong Li, Mr. David Ying Zhang, Mr. Neil 
Nanpeng Shen, Dr. Dave Daqing Qi and Mr. Benson Bing 
Chung Tam.


On November 28, 2017, the board of directors of the 
Company has appointed Mr. Li Wang, the Chief Operating 
Officer and Co-president of the Company, as a new member 
of the board. As a result, the board size of the Company has 
been increased to seven. Mr. Wang joined the Company as its 
operation director in July 2011. Mr. Wang has been the 
Company's Chief Operating Officer since June 2014 and Co-
president since April 2017. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. 
Wang worked at NEC China Co., Ltd. Mr. Wang received his

Red Flag 2: VIE Structure Contains Undisclosed 
Companies  


• Momo uses a variable interest entity (VIE) to operate its mobile app business in China to circumvent foreign ownership 
limits on internet and mobile content platforms. This is now the common accepted way to operate such a company


• The Company discloses that its VIE, Beijing Momo has 10 first level subsidiaries and 2 second level subsidiary.  Spruce 
Point has discovered that it has 9 undisclosed first level subsidiaries and 114 undisclosed second level subsidiaries


Spruce Point has discovered that Momo has 9 undisclosed first level subsidiaries and 114 undisclosed 


second level subsidiaries (“subs”).  In our experience, it is uncommon for a U.S. listed Chinese company 


to fail to disclose the subsidiaries of its VIE. 


• Four subsidiaries are identified in the “Long Term Equity 
Investment” (Note 5 to the financial statements) as equity 
investments of the group, but not as subsidiaries of the VIE 
entity.  In the same note, there is an “others” item for both 
equity and cost method of investment sections that is the grab 
bag where the undisclosed entities are presumably recorded

Companies  (Cont’d)


Below are the nine undisclosed first levels subs that Spruce Point has discovered. Undisclosed entities 


provide the opportunity for the legal management of the Company to extract benefits for themselves or 


hide the true nature of the operations. Several of the disclosed and undisclosed entities are limited 


partnerships.  Limited partnerships (LP) are more opaque than limited liability companies.  Investments 


made by LP’s are based on the partners agreement, and the returns from the investments can be assigned 


to other companies or individuals depending on what is specified in the partners’ agreement.

Red Flag 3: MOMO’s Undisclosed Ownership of 
Talent Agencies + Related Party Transactions


Our forensic analysis has identified that Momo owns at least two, including what we believe to be one of 


their top five, talent agencies.  It is unclear how many additional talent agencies they may own through 


other undisclosed VIEs, but it appears that Momo is conducting undisclosed related party transactions.  


It also raises obvious concerns around conflicts of interest around the fairness of treatment across 


broadcasters/agencies affiliated vs. unaffiliated with Momo.

Red Flag 3: MOMO’s Undisclosed Ownership of Talent 
Agencies + Related Party Transactions (Cont’d)


The chain of virtual gifting transactions and accounting discussed publicly by Momo management is 


rather straightforward (“clean”).  However, this chain gets increasingly “murky” once you introduce Momo 


related party agencies, agencies supporting their own talent, free virtual currency and cash rebates.  


• Users purchase virtual currency from Momo and then give virtual 
gifts to other users (VAS) and broadcasters (Live Video) as a means of 
showing interest or as a token of appreciation


• Momo then takes a cut of the virtual gift’s value, typically 50%-60%, 
and then pays the remainder out (Revenue Sharing under Cost of 
Revenues) either directly to a broadcaster or the broadcaster’s agent


• Agencies act as representation for broadcasters and assist them with 
training, compliance with regulation, and online/offline promotion 


• This chain of transactions, as described above and in the neighboring 
image provided by Momo, is relatively straightforward


Source:  Momo, KGI


• Though never discussed publicly by Momo, our 
agency interviews reveal that payments are often 
being made by agencies to promote their own talent  


• Additionally, Momo is providing free virtual currency 
to some preferred agencies and giving cash rebates to 
others


• The nature of the above (right) transactions, and the 
fact that some of these agencies are Momo owned 
entities, creates uncertainty around accounting 
treatment and opens the door for potentially illegal 
activities (e.g. money laundering)

Momo disclosed in its 20-F Hunan Qindao Culture Spread Co as an equity investment of $4.4 million in 2016 


and having shared live streaming revenue of $3.9 million.  It has not been disclosed as a talent agent and we 


can’t understand why it would be receiving a $5.1 million prepayment from Momo. 


• In July 2017 Hunan Qindao Culture Spread established a subsidiary, Hunan Qindao Network 
Media Co Ltd, that we have discovered is now used to operate a Momo dedicated talent agency 
business. The Hunan Qindao Culture Spread branded agency website is registered to this

• Curiously, this subsidiary received an advance payment of $5.1 million in revenue sharing from 
Momo Inc, disclosed in the 2017 20-F (Note 15(1)).  Normally an agent will receive its share of 
revenue from Momo at the end of the month and then pass on the broadcasters share of 
revenue.  We can see no good reason why an agent should receive an advance payment

• Momo reported that it purchased (shared live streaming revenue) $3.9 million in 2016 and $9.1 million in 2017 from Hunan 
Qindao Culture Spread. However, Hunan Qindao only reported $6.4 million in 2016 and $2.1 million in 2017.  


• It was simply not possible that Hunan Qindao earned $9.1 million in 2017 from live streaming cooperation with Momo

These discrepancies indicate that at best the auditor has not checked the relationship between this 


subsidiary and Beijing Momo.  At worst, it is further evidence that the murky undisclosed relationship 


between Momo and agents may well be used for transactions other than the claimed broadcaster activity.


• Hunan Qindao Network Media Co Ltd was reported to have 
received an advance payment of revenue sharing from 
Momo amounting to $5.1 million


• Hunan Qindao Network Media only reported prepayments 
of $14,328 (fourteen thousand dollars). There is also no 
deferred revenue account. The other payables, which could 
be where a prepayment is recorded was $3.85 million,

Red Flag 3: MOMO’s Undisclosed Ownership of 
Talent Agencies And Related Party Transactions


Beijing Momo invested RMB 230,000 in one of its top 5 agencies, Beijing Mushang Culture Media, on 


November 30th, 2017 and failed to disclose the subsidiary in its 2017 20-F (filed April 2018).  Beijing 


Mushang’s financial reports are highly suspicious and may potentially suggest money laundering.


• Beijing Mushang has prepayments of $4.9 million, which has obviously been keeping the company operating.   
As Beijing Mushang only works exclusively with Momo, and Momo has not disclosed this prepayment, then it 
is reasonable to assume the payment must have come from a third party 


• Recall from the prior page, Hunan Qindao Network Media received a prepayment of $5.1 million from Momo 
and this was disclosed. Deloitte, Momo’s auditor, is clear that they audit Beijing Momo and its subsidiaries.  
Wouldn’t Deloitte have noticed $4.9 million in prepayments?  So either Deloitte is ineffective as an auditor, 
or the payment was made by a third party.  So why would a third party prepay Beijing Mushang?


• We believe that this may be evidence that Momo is using this agent to potentially syphon money.  Beijing 
Mushang could use the prepayment to buy virtual gifts on Momo, then Momo could keep or return some 
portion of the payments to operate Beijing Mushang.  If Momo is doing this with agents it owns, than it may 
well be doing the same with willing agents that it does not own. If auditors cannot track owned agents, it is 
unlikely they can track the activities of the [likely thousands] of agents that Momo transacts with

address does not exist


• Beijing Mushang Culture Media Co Ltd also claims to have branches (a 
legal definition that means a separate legal entity) in Changsha 
(Hunan), Chengdu (Sichuan) and Xuzhou (Jiangsu) in its brochure


• Investigators checked, and Mushang Culture has no legal entities 
established in those areas. In addition to these ”branches” investigators 
found job ads indicating that Mushang also has offices in Hangzhou 
(Zhejiang) and Changzhou (Jiangsu)


• It is illegal to operate a company from an address that is not 
registered, or to employ people in other provinces without a legal 
entity.  Employees would be unlawfully employed and their benefits 
are unlikely to be paid.  Broadcasters employed by this agency may be 
paid directly by Momo and the are unlikely to be paying income tax

The physical location of Beijing Mushang Culture Media appears to be somewhat of a mystery.  Spruce

Job advertisements for Beijing Mushang reference a different address than the legal entity.  Our 


investigators visited this address and were surprised to find an unmarked door in a high end residential 


building welcoming “home delivery, just walk in”.  Is this what a top 5 agency looks like?

• Investigators believe the operations of 
Beijing Mushang are run out of a high 
end residential building in Beijing

• On the right is the door to room 2010 
on the 20th floor.  The A4 sign on the 
door says “Home delivery, just walk 
in”.  There is no company signage  


• Is this the “impressive” operations of 
one of Momo’s Top 5 agents?

• International review sites claim Pokermaster is a highly rated app with a 
large number of users and games are conducted in RMB using virtual 
currency (Source). Deposits and withdrawals may be made using Skrill, 
Neteller, EcoPayz and Bitcoin


• Pokermaster arranges offline and online tournaments and you can see the 
details on the website www.pokermaster.com or on its Facebook page 


• There are hundreds of clubs and thousands of players at peak times.   
The games are considered to be high stakes  


• Players outside of China need to use an agent to join the gambling (access).  
In China, players go through an agent to gamble on the app.  Players can add 
value online but need an agent to convert virtual chips into cash.  Players can 
add value via the Apple store or WePay


Our consultant interviewed 18 mobile gamblers, 11 of whom gambled on Pokermaster.  Players considered 


the app one of, if not the most, popular poker gambling apps in China. 


• We interviewed 18 mobile app gamblers in China, 11 of whom gambled on Pokermaster and found the following:


 The typical player is male in his late 20’s to early 30’s and is based in major cities such as Beijing, Hangzhou and 
Changsha


 Players spend between 3 and 6 hours per day gambling on the app


 Most players spend around RMB1,000 per month gambling on the app.  However, one player claimed to spend 
around RMB200,000 per month.  Players claimed to win between RMB2,500 and RMB600,000 per month with most 
claiming to win more than RMB100,000 per month


 Players pay a 3%-5% commission of winnings to the club organizers when cashing out of the game  


• Gambling on the site was common knowledge and gamblers easily found agents via WeChat and other sites (Douban, 
Riji1). In fact, it is not to hard to find sites that will help you become an agent (pokercompany.com)

Red Flag 5: Making Sense of The Tantan Deal


The strategic acquisition rationale for Tantan, a dating app in China, appears limited to user base 


expansion given that operations between Tantan and Momo are to remain almost entirely distinct.  


Given this fact, and the premium paid to recent private funding rounds, the acquisition seems extremely 


expensive for client acquisition or speculation. 


We believe the Tantan acquisition was likely done to cover up slowing growth that started in Q2’17


• On February 23rd, Momo announced that it would acquire 
Tantan for $735 million of which $600.9 million would be in cash 
and 5.3 million A class ordinary shares


• According to QuestMobile and Iresearch Tantan had only 20 
million active monthly users at the start of the year 


• From the neighboring table, we see that Tantan had no revenue 
in 2015 and 2016, but more importantly there was very little 
activity in the Tantan VIE.  Tantan is a small company that only 
started to charge subscription in Q3 2017 and premium VIP 
service in January 2018 (source)  


• During the Q1 2018 earnings call, management guided towards 
only $4.5 million in revenue for the month of June 2018

well as business development under the leadership of their existing management, and we will be providing full support and expertise 
in areas including human resources, technology as well as monetization.” – Tang Yan Q4 2017 Earning Call


“With one section of the cash to invest or to buy Tantan, almost a management buyout, so how do you incentivize the funding 
management team to continue to work partly, that’s number one. Number two is Tantan working independently, how is the potential 
synergy between Momo and Tantan can be realized?” – Analyst Tian Hou Q4 2017 Earnings Call

Red Flag 5: Making Sense of The Tantan 
Acquisition (Cont’d)


One alternative theory is that Momo needed to use the cash it may be having difficulty getting out of China, so it acquired 


Momo Tantan VIE with RMB cash in China. Momo stopped disclosing the location of its cash holdings after Q3’2016. Three 


equity LPs mysteriously became Tantan shareholders on October 25, 2017.  It’s possible that the newly added limited 


partnerships were put in place immediately before the transaction to hide who actually got paid the cash, and that Momo 


insiders could be the beneficiaries of the sales. Recall: In Nov 2017 the SAIC charged Momo with of “Filing Corporate 


Information With the Intent To Conceal The Truth and Falsify” and three Directors abruptly resigned for “personal reasons”.

Tantan Financing Rounds


• We believe Momo overpaid for Tantan.  The Series D financing in June 2017 valued the Company at $320 million (Source). 
It is not clear with the information at hand, and revenue guidance of $4.5 million for June ‘18, why Tantan’s valuation 
increased by 130% in little more than 8 months

Ownership Structure of Tantan VIE Just Before Beijing Momo Took Control February 23, 2018



http://www.yixieshi.com/107123.html
38


• Momo’s IPO prospectus in the section “History of Securities Issuance” states that preferred shares were first issued to Matrix 
and “an individual investor” on April 18th, 2012.  The “individual investor” is not shy, Zheng Gang of Purple Sky has identified 
himself as that investor but claims he put up 49% of the money himself and his Purple Sky limited partners put up the other 51% 


• The IPO prospectus states on the April 18th, 2012 the 22,272,730 Series A-1 preferred shares were issued to Matrix and Purple 
Sky/Zheng Gang.  The split between the two was not stated.  The two paid $1 million for the shares on a valuation of $10 million 
and owned approximately 10% of Momo Inc. after the Series A-1 round


• Purple Sky did not participate in any further rounds of financing and disposed of it shares as indicated in the below table  


Red Flag 5: Does The Strange Addition of LPs In The 
Tantan VIE Structure Have Precedence From Momo 
Pre-IPO Transactions?


Based on stock sale transactions and IPO filings, it appears as though both Matrix and Purple Sky owned 


the entirety of Momo’s A-1 preferred shares.  This is irreconcilable and suggests that one or both vehicles 


may have been used to enrich Momo insiders prior to the IPO.


Date Buyer Shares Sold Proceeds ($mm)


July 2012 Alibaba Investments Ltd 4,894,500 $1.4


Jan 2013 Alibaba Investments Ltd 10,079,373 $4.3
May 15, 2014 Momo 7,298,857* $30.8


22,272,730 $36.5


*Note:  These shares were later cancelled by Momo.  Source: Momo prospectus


Purple Sky Stock Sale Transactions


• We estimate that Purple Sky provided Momo around $560,000 to $630,000 in financing in April/May 2012 and eventually sold 
its shares for a total of $36.5m, a return of between 58x to 65x (Source)


• According to the SAIC company registration, Purple Sky became an investor in Momo VIE on May 29th, 2012 before the date 
indicated in the IPO documents and that would mean that the investment was made inside China and the payments for those 
shares when sold were made outside of China 


• Matrix was a shareholder at the time of the IPO in December 2014 having 65,970,897 shares.  22,272,730 of those shares 
were issued to Matrix in the Series A-1 financing.  This would indicate that Matrix got all the shares and Purple Sky none

Red Flag 6: Recent Performance Metrics Are At 
Odds With Industry Data


Analysys and QuestMobile data indicate that live streaming industry users peaked almost six to twelve 


months ago, and that Momo’s MAU growth has been flattening or in decline. This is a different story in 


direction and / or magnitude from what Momo is reporting.  Additionally, according to QuestMobile, Tantan 


MAU appears to be only 20 million.


Risk Factor From Momo 2017 20-F Annual Report (p.14): “We rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain key 
operating metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.”

Red Flag 6: Momo Undisclosed Talent Agency 
Financials Indicate A More Significant Historical Role 
For Agencies  


• Based on Momo statements about the role agencies 
played in the Live Video business at the end of 2016, 
and the reported revenue of Beijing Mushang Culture 
Media, Spruce Point estimates that agencies 
accounted for 46% of Momo’s Live Video Revenue


Based on Beijing Mushang Culture’s revenues, we estimate that talent agencies likely represented a little 


less than half of Live Video in 2017, despite management statements about agents being insignificant to 


the business.  Maybe the “shift towards agencies” was more about rhetoric than reality.

Red Flag 6: Recent Management Statements And 
Results Rebuffed By Agency Interviews


In Momo’s Q1 2018 results, cost of revenue as a % of Live Stream Revenue suddenly declined for the first 


time since Q4 2016.  Management cited a decrease in tournament related bonuses as the key driver, but 


this was consistently rebuffed by every agency that we interviewed, including a Momo owned agency.  


Spruce Point finds this change in trend counterintuitive given a growing focus on agencies. 


• During the recent earnings call Momo management explained away a decrease in cost of revenues by stating that 
strength in non-event day revenue resulted in:


Consultant Questions Response From Momo Owned Talent Agency


When a broadcaster takes part in quarterly or year end competition how 
does the split between Momo and the Talent/agent differ from normal?


No, the split is the same


Does a broadcaster get any additional revenue from participating in 
quarterly or year end competitions? 


They will earn more at these events as their fans will 
give them more money


Was there any change this year? Was the split of revenue for competition 
different or any other change in in gifts etc? 


In my opinion, there is no change with last year. These 
are very important events for any agency


Source: Spruce Point Consultant Interviews


• Spruce Point expected costs of revenues to be increasing given a transition towards agencies and the added 
incentives that such a strategy requires (not to mention increasing platform competition):


In November, we rolled out a trial plan, whereby the qualified agencies are provided with a different level of additional cash incentives if 
they reach certain growth targets. Although such incentives will likely cause cost in revenue to continue to fluctuate in the future, we 
believe it will better motivate the agencies and individual broadcasters to invest and grow their business within our ecosystem, which 
in turn will grow ours.– CFO Johnathan Zhang Q4 2017 Earnings Call


“We scaled back the revenue oriented operating efforts around the quarterly competition event. Therefore, cost on bonus or rewards 
offered to broadcasters during the March tournament, was significantly reduced.”
- Momo CFO Jonathan Zhang on Q1 2018 Earnings Call


• Spruce Point’s Consultant specifically asked agents if there was any change in tournament payouts and was consistently 
told there was no such reduction in revenue to agency / broadcasters.  Additionally, the agencies all acknowledged the 
impression that the cost of advertising and running the tournament this year had gone up substantially

Red Flag 7: Regulations Focused On Content 
Could Hit Momo Hard At Any Time 


On February 14th, 2018 the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) issued a notice 


requesting the strengthening of online audiovisual live broadcast activities, standardizing online 


communication order, and preventing social risks.  Concerns about content could be a contributing 


factor in Momo’s transition towards agencies.


SARFT Requirements


1. The contents of live broadcasting dialogue must be correctly guided, vigorously promote the socialist core values ​​and 
advanced socialist culture, disseminate healthy and beneficial knowledge, and must not disseminate content that is 
prohibited by state laws and regulations, and must not disseminate content that promotes the worship of money and 
extravagance


2. The platform for launching web-based answering programs must have the statutory network audiovisual program live 
broadcasting qualifications.  Any organization or individual that does not hold a "Information Network Broadcasting Audiovisual 
Program Permit" shall not open a webcast answer program


3. A qualified platform for launching online live-answer programs must effectively implement the main responsibilities, strictly 
fulfill the filing review procedures, improve the content review management system and work program, and ensure timely 
disposal of the problems and accountability.


4. Host of broadcast answering programs should have the corresponding conditions for radio and television program 
presenters, with high moral qualities and good professional qualities

Small Exclusive Agent #2:


“I don't think Momo will be a long lasting platform as its reputation is not good. In most peoples experience it is a live cam site 
for sex and this is something it cannot wash off.”


Super Agency #6:


“Momo is good for publicity. Most people think of Momo as a sex site which has predominantly male users.” 


Small Agency #9:


“A successful broadcaster on Yizhibo would not survive on Momo.  Momo is low level.  Momo was successful because it was like a 
porn cam channel.  The users were 30 to 50 year old males in second and third tier cities.  Their motives were clear.  They 
wanted to see sex performances. Despite being cleaned up Momo is still this sort of channel and encourages people to climax. 
If Momo can not change directions then it will have a problem.”


Large Agency #11:


“90% of the audience are male.  They are not interested in art but more about sex.  Older men with their families in the US. 
They are lonely and spend a lot of money each month.”  


Four of the agencies our consultant interviewed gave the unsolicited opinion that Momo has a reputation 


as a (sex) cam site.  We believe that this has directly contributed to Momo’s advertising woes.

Business Insights Emanating From 
Chinese Interviews With Key 
Stakeholders
47


Quick History of The Momo You Know


Momo (Nasdaq: MOMO or “the Company”) went public in late 2014 seeking to fill a void in the lives of lonely Chinese by 
serving as an anonymous location based social networking site.  Early monetization of the site focused on a subscription (and
later Super VIP) model where subscribers received additional functionality to facilitate making new connections.  The first 
traffic monetization product revolved around the distribution of third party video games.  Concurrent with the push in mobile
games, Momo sought to monetize traffic through mobile marketing.  The mobile marketing effort leaned originally on 
partnerships with the likes of Alibaba and 58.com and later self operated marketing services focused on Dao Dian Tang and 
app downloads. 


Momo’s growth during 2015 was impressive, albeit shy of 2016 levels, but the internals of membership subscription services, 
mobile games and mobile marketing (per monthly active user “MAU”) were all showing signs of fatigue in early 2016.  During 
this same period Momo’s reputation as a “hook-up site” was further being soiled by the fact that a number of crimes, 
particularly rape, were being reported in media outlets (sources below).


In Q1 2016 Momo introduced live streaming and was able to reestablish the growth trajectory of the Company.  Momo 
shareholders would later benefit, to the tune of ~215% share price increase over the past two plus years, from the 
intersection of the J-Curve portion of China live stream adoption (particularly pertaining to user generated “UG” content) and 
the fact that Momo had an installed (largely male millennial) MAU base of 70 million at the time.  Live Video revenues, paying 
users, Average Revenue Per Paying User “ARPPU” and conversion of MAU to Live Video paying users all exploded during 2016 
and live streaming propelled Momo revenues to increase more than 3x.


By the 3rd quarter of 2017 the Live Video segment was beginning to show signs of fatigue as paying users flattened out and 
conversion of MAU to paying users was in decline.  The revenues of Live Video continued to post strong growth, but this was 
predominately driven by ARPPU growth.  At this point in time there appeared to be a realization by Momo management that 
the Live Video business would have to evolve in order to avoid the fate of live gaming before it.  Momo Live Video revenues 
were likely very concentrated (no longer disclosed) amongst a small subset of paying users and broadcasters.  The gold rush 
of user generated content was fading as live streaming was maturing as a business and becoming more professional from a 
content perspective.  This repositioning of Live Video isn’t playing to Momo’s strengths and also invites new competition from 
the likes of deep pocketed players like Tencent’s Now and the rapidly growing short video players.

Live Video Propels MAU


Mobile MAU (mln) Live Video Revenues ($USD mln)


YOY MAU Growth (Right)

The Dangerous Goal of Reinventing 
Momo’s Live Video Business


In an attempt to reposition Live Video to preserve market share and avoid the scrutiny of regulators, Momo introduced an 
agency based content improvement strategy.  “The goal is to set up the policies and incentive systems so that increasing number 
of quality agencies professional performers can feel motivated and driven enough to offer higher quality and more differentiated
content through our platform.” This is a tectonic shift from Q4 ’16 when it was stated on the earnings call that the “number one 
agency in December only represented somewhere around 3% of the total revenues from Live Video service and the Top 10 you 
know in aggregate represented somewhere around 16%.” Very little transparency has been provided around the agency 
strategy or the anticipated impact to Live Video’s financials


In addition to the proposed changes on the content side of Live Video, Momo also decided to introduce new use cases for the 
overwhelming majority of live streaming broadcasters that simply viewed it as a means of socializing with friends (rather than a
talent based occupation).  Momo once again introduced new products (radio, quick chat, quiz show, etc.), most free or without
Momo taking a cut for the time being, in hopes of maintaining and attracting new users


Up until this point in time, management had continued to beat the drum of Momo being a location based anonymous social 
networking site with a large set of monetization opportunities.  However, on the Q3‘17 earnings call there was a sudden 
acknowledgement by CEO Tang Yan “On the product side, one of the key hurdles that we had in improving the long-term user 
retention was the fact that our core use case, which was pretty much based on nearby people and instant messaging was kind 
of limited”. Momo management then doubled down on delivering a “social and entertainment experience” to capture the 
attention and wallets of the young Chinese


These above paragraphs encapsulate the endeavor that Momo is now undertaking to transform its brand and content from an 
anonymous hook-up and cam girl site to a social media platform focused on delivering professional entertainment (and 
marketing opportunities). The magnitude and risk of this transition shouldn’t be understated as Momo’s historical revenues 
(and growth) have been partially tied to their legacy “content” and the user base that it attracted


Momo’s ability to execute this transition and growth strategy is up for debate and is anyone's guess.  This will clearly be a tight 
rope act as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Tantan, a popular hook-up (and dating) site, that was questioned by an analyst 
for its strategic benefit on a recent conference call.  On one hand, the acquisition makes sense in the hope that it further 
broadens Momo’s MAU and introduces a more female oriented demographic.  Conversely, there are no plans to integrate the 
platforms and recognize material synergies, as it likely reinforces the brand that Momo is trying to distance itself from

Strategic Shift After Flattening Paid User Growth 
in Live Video During Q2 And Q3 2017


Q2 ’17 Earnings Call, Binnie Wong Merrill Lynch 


Q: So, I have two questions here. One is that we see the growth with the number of paid user this quarter 
has been quite flattish; conversion rate has also been coming down, what is the reason behind that? In 
relation to that, we understand the latest 8.0 version offers more social networking tools, be online 
forecasting, say, short video, Quick Chat and NDN, isn't that monetization potential is currently quite 
limited on this new function. Why would Momo divert its traffic away from live broadcasting, a very good 
monetization tool? That’s my first question. 


A:  I will try to capture everything. So the question is on the flattish trend in the live streaming paying users 
in this quarter. I think that can be attributed to the fact that some of the users have shifted part of their 
activities from the long tail smaller live streaming chat rooms towards newer used cases, I mean the audio 
and video-based life interaction experiences such as Quick Chat and Werewolf because essentially they kind 
of fit newer used cases kind of satisfied exactly the same kind of user demand.


I will give you an example here. For the Quick Chat experience on daily basis we had somewhere around 
50,000 daily paying users sending wrap packet. On a monthly basis, we had 800,000 these type of paying 
users sending wrap packer, however because the wrap packets are not recorded as the company's revenues 
because they were not taking revenue shares from the wrap packets and on the top line, so the revenues 
going to wrap packet are actually not recorded as the company's revenues, and thus the users that - the 
users sending wrap packet are not reported as our paying users either.


However, we are seeing for the Quick Chat kind of new social experiences, the paying users who paid to send 
wrap packet have been increasing pretty rapidly. Your second point is, why we would divert traffic from 
our very monetizable live streaming service to more newer used cases. I think the key thing here is that 
we’ve never been positioning Momo as a live streaming company. We have always been positioning 
Momo as a social company and we’re seeing these - the user experience, the social experience around the 
newer used cases are actually pretty good in some ways actually better than the live streaming service.


So although the newer used cases currently do not monetize at the same level as the live streaming -
traditional live streaming service does, we will like to make more explorations on those front to drive the 
overall user experience around the social activities. We think that kind of transition is very healthy for the 
platform. For Momo as a social platform in the long term. So that’s for your first question. – Tang Yan


Given the lack of data transparency into Momo’s businesses, one must pay particular attention to 


management’s (translated) comments.  Based on recent statements, it appears that they are looking to 


diversify from Live Video while becoming increasingly dependent on agencies.  


So the Live Video cash cow’s best 
days appear behind it?


Live Video business is really 
concentrated amongst both 
Talent and Users.


We’ve actually redirected these 
Small Users towards activities 
where we don’t get paid.


We’ve never been positioning 
Momo as a live stream company
(Really??), it’s just where we 
make all of our money.


Although it’s less profitable we 
have to do it anyway for the sake 
of the business long-term.

Strategic Shift After Flattening Paid User Growth 
In Live Video During Q2 And Q3 2017 (Cont’d)


Tang Yan Q3 ‘17 Earnings Call


This year as the market consolidation accelerates, live streaming players offering homogeneous 
products and services are gradually exiting the market. At the same time, we are seeing bigger 
players with strong community ecosystems taking initiatives to upgrade their content offerings and 
market-share shifting from amateur broadcasters to more professional ones.


We believe content building, as well as talent recruitment and management are becoming increasingly 
important as core competitive advantages in live streaming business. In that regards, we will in the 
future push harder to enhance constant offerings, as well as talent development. That will translate 
into several new priorities of ours. 


Number one, we will dedicate more resources to drive quality content in verticals that are highly 
compatible with Momo's platform attributes.  For example, singing, dancing, and musical instruments 
performances. We are also going to drive the content diversity by exploring opportunities in some of 
the non-talent show areas to appeal to a broader user base. 


Number two, we are working more closely with the professional agencies in talent discovery and 
management, optimizing our incentive plans and making them better motivated to help us improve 
the content quality and diversity.


Moreover, we're planning to go deeper with our exploration in the area of professional entertainment 
content production and distribution, both within and beyond the Momo platform. Other than the 
direct economic value that we potentially - we can potentially drive from it, we have two additional 
goals to achieve. Number one goal is to widen the career potentials of our top performers and 
that’s better motivate them to improve the quality of content. The other goal is to boost Momo's 
brand image and bring new users to our platform.


…What we do is that, we hand pick outstanding talents in those verticals and support them with 
additional traffic and promotional resources. The goal is to give performers with real entertaining 
talent, bigger opportunity to stand out, and build our career on our platform.


Given the lack of data transparency into Momo’s businesses, one must pay particular attention to 


management’s (translated) comments.  Based on recent statements, it appears that they are looking to 


diversify from Live Video while becoming increasingly dependent on agencies.  


Industry is maturing and 
competition is about to become 
much more credible.


Gone are the days where talent 
just appeared from our User 
Base at no cost to us.


The move towards professional 
content requires us to be 
dependent on agencies.


“Cam girl” isn’t a sustainable 
career compared to pushing 
products for our competitors. 
Changing our image can’t hurt 
advertising revenue either.


Spruce Point Interpretation


No longer looking to diversify 
across talent w/ our algorithm, 
look to concentrate instead.

Strategic Shift After Flattening Paid User Growth 
In Live Video During Q2 And Q3 2017 (Cont’d)


Tang Yan Q3 ‘17 Earnings Call


Other than these efforts, we are also working to strengthen our collaborations with professional 
agencies in building our talent pool and improving the content offerings. Historically, agencies have 
a limited role in Momo's live streaming ecosystem. We have noticed, since earlier this year that some 
quality talent agencies and MCNs are becoming increasingly mature in terms of talent management 
and content development.


As a result, we are adjusting our operational policies to better support the high value-added 
agencies in traffic and other resources, as well as economic incentive. We believe that such 
adjustment will give the quality agencies bigger room to develop and does better motivate them to 
help us in developing talent and driving constant quality and diversity. It will also allow them to 
grow their business in a bigger way within our ecosystem, which in turn will grow ours.


In November, we rolled out a trial plan, whereby the qualified agencies are provided with a different 
level of additional cash incentives if they reach certain growth targets. Although such incentives will 
likely cause cost in revenue to continue to fluctuate in the future, we believe it will better motivate 
the agencies and individual broadcasters to invest and grow their business within our ecosystem, which 
in turn will grow ours


Moving on to mobile marketing business, the new homepage design of 8.0 has diverted traffic from 
nearby people to other product modules. At the same time, we have also reduced the number of ad 
units in the nearby posts from 3 to 1. As nearby people and nearby posts are the two major carriers of 
the ad impressions. The 8.0-related changes have led to a significant decline in the ad inventory 
supply resulting in a sequential decrease in mobile marketing revenues during the third quarter.


On the product side, one of the key hurdles that we had in improving the long-term user retention 
was the fact that our core use case, which was pretty much based on nearby people and instant 
messaging was kind of limited. In the past two years’ time, we have made a lot of progresses in 
expanding the social use cases.–


More critical analysis of management’s recent (translated) comments


Complete 180 degree shift on 
the role that agencies play in 
supporting the business.


New business model will 
require greater strategy and 
likely costs, but will be worth it.


The move towards professional 
content requires us to be 
dependent on agencies.


Spruce Point Interpretation


Is our limited ad load already 
too much?  Hmmm.


Core use case of nearby people 
and instant messaging are 
limited.  There goes the baby 
with the bath water.

Evaluating the Live Video Business Is Extremely 
Challenging Given Current Metrics


Is Momo intentionally obfuscating performance trends? The only management provided insights into 


Momo’s Live Video business are the revenue and the number of paying users.  Momo actively avoids 


disclosing certain business practices (e.g., virtual rebates), Key Performance Indicators (including 


those previously provided) and complete segment financials.  Additional information should be easy 


for a technology and data-driven company that promotes its “Artificial Intelligence” abilities.


KPIs                
(Segments & 


Counts)


Spruce Point believes the following information would be required to effectively assess the health and prospects of the 
Live Video business 


• Talent by monthly earnings (previously disclosed) and agency representation 


• Paying users by monthly giving (previously disclosed), aging, and frequency of giving 


• Agents by size, exclusivity to Momo, and recipient of value added services


• Details around competition metrics


Financials


• Concentration of revenues by talent/paying user (previously disclosed) and agency/competition KPIs


• Effective fee sharing rate and accounting of virtual gift rebates & refunds  


• Segment level information: Allocation of costs, segment margin, capital expenditures


Discussion of 
Business 
Practices


• Rationale for owning their own talent agencies (undiscussed/undisclosed)


• Rationale for refund and rebate strategy for agencies (undisclosed)


• Instances when fee sharing with talent and agencies are reduced


• Strategy for agency value added services and client acquisition

Key Implications From Talent Agency Interviews 
On Live Video Financials


Area of 
Discussion Key Implication


Potential Financial 
Implication


Fee Sharing
Consolidation of Live Streaming Industry & Preferred Momo Agency Relationships 


Leads to Decline in Momo Premium Fee Share 
Pushes Fee Share to 
45%-50% over time


Talent 
Consolidation


As consolidation also plays out across Talent the cost of promoting Talent will 
eventually result in less “supporting our talent revenue” 


Eliminates some portion of 
tail revenue


Agency 
Consolidation


As Agencies consolidate and gain power we expect their negotiating power with 
Momo to increase


Pushes Fee Share to 
45%-50% over time


Agency 
Alignment


Once the “commercial secret” of offering select agencies refunds and rebates is out 
of the bag we expect that it will have to be offered much more broadly or 


eliminated completely to avoid disenfranchising agencies 


Eliminates 5-10% of revenue
through additional rebate or 


loss of “preferred” clients


Competition
The presence of extremely large, well funded, competitors likely drives down Fee 


share rates for the entire industry


Industry fee share levels 
compress over time, lost 


market share


Advertising
Momo’s reputation as a “cam site” will limit its ability to generate product 


placement revenue through live streaming and limit career paths of their Talent
Limits TAM


New Regulation
The new regulations, which agencies referenced and we also believe Momo is 


ignoring, will translate into lost revenues and potentially increased costs
Potentially reduces revenue 


pool and TAM


Based on the new strategic direction being chartered in Live Video, and the findings from our interviews, 


we estimate that the earnings power of Momo Live Video is likely to be impaired by 30%

Undisclosed Insights Into Momo Live Video 
Strategy Based On Talent Agency Interviews


• Momo appears to tier the fee sharing with agencies based on their size and allegiance  


• Momo’s take ranges from a high of 60% to a low of 50% in our sample.  Platform take rates on 
competitor’s platforms ranged from a high of 50%-55% to a low of 30%.  Logic would suggest 
that Momo’s rate will come down to match peers over time 


Fee Sharing


Free Virtual Gifts
• Momo once again appears to treat agencies differently depending on their size.  The majority of 


our sample indicated that Momo doesn’t provide them with free gifts, unless they are trying to 
“steal talent”.   One agency from each size cohort indicated that they receive free gifts from 
Momo and one indicated that this is a “commercial secret” 


• “This is a commercial secret. Depending on the ranking and scale of your agency you will get 
virtual gifts. I don't want to disclose how much.  Anyway there is this sort of thing.  It all depends 
on if your agency has that right. It depends on who you know and how good your broadcasters 
are.” – Large Agency #3


• “In the initial promotion period we will talk with Momo.  We can discuss with Momo that we get 
a rebate on all of the gifts that we give a new broadcaster.  They will return 100%.  To establish 
a broadcaster we will spend more than RMB100,000.  Hard to say how many new broadcasters we 
develop each month as it depends on the new peoples talent.” – Super Agency #7
58


Undisclosed Insights Into Momo Live Video 
Strategy Based On Talent Agency Interviews


Momo Controlled 
Agencies?


• When we asked agencies about whether or not Momo controls its own agencies we got a 
range of responses from “No” to their biggest agency is their own


• “Yes there are. Momo has one official agency. You will notice broadcasters that are called 
"official" broadcasters. Momo’s own staff open agencies. They do this privately. They keep 
it out of the spotlight. To do the agency business relies on your relationship with the 
platform. If you have a good relationship with the platform than you can get anything 
passed. Every platform has the underground agencies.” Small Agent #2


• “Yes, Momo directly contracts broadcasters. Momo gave these people money to establish 
their own agencies.  This agency is in Qingdao.  For confidentiality reason I cannot tell you 
the name.  This is Momo's largest agency.” – Small Agency #9


Cash Rebates
• Based on our interviews Momo support to agencies ranges from better positioning on lists, 


support for external events and cash rebates of 5% on virtual gifts.  These benefits generally 
appear to accrue to exclusive and large scale agents.  Agencies primary complaint in regards 
to Momo is that their share of revenue is too low


• “Better positioning on the APP.  Sometimes we can add value and get 100% free.  So if we add 
10,000 they will give us 10,000 or a rebate of 5%.  We don't work with Momo as their take is 
too high.  We also have to pay 6% tax. We care about our ability to make money on a channel.  
Agents and broadcasters care more about how much money they can earn than traffic. ” –
Large Agency #11


• “We are both aiming to make money. Momo will give us better positioning and place us on 
hottest lists.  When we add value on Momo we will get a 5% rebate.  In the back end system 
we can take this out as cash.” – Super Agency #6
59


Undisclosed Insights Into Momo Live Video 
Strategy Based On Talent Agency Interviews


Supporting Talent
• Every Agency we spoke with indicated that they support their own talent by giving virtual 


gifts.  Some agencies do so reluctantly as Momo keeps 60% of the money they are spending 
on their talent.  Others spend significant portions of their own revenues back into their 
talent, particularly at year end.  Two agencies estimated that their own spending represents 
10%-20% of their revenues


• “Yes, we will help broadcasters to become popular. We estimate about 10% of the revenue 
of Momo is from this type of activity. Sometimes we will pay this cost to help a broadcaster.” 
–Super Agency #6


• “We have to. This is just the same as Taobao fake sales.  Everyone does it.  Each month 
about 10-20% of our revenue is us spending money on broadcasters.  We share the loss 
equally with the broadcaster.” – Large Agency #11
60


Live Video Financial Impact From New 
Competition And Shift In Strategy


Cost of Revenues
• Based on publicly available information and our interviews, Spruce Point believes most of the 


credible competing platforms maintain 40%-55% of virtual currency gifting and emerging threat 
Now maintains only 30%-40% (higher cost of revenues) 


• Momo’s virtual currency gifting retention rate was described by agencies as being between 
50%-60% depending on the size of the agency


• Spruce Point believes that increased competition amongst platforms and consolidation 
amongst agencies will force Momo to lower virtual gift retention and increase cost of 
revenues going forward   


Competition / 
Market Share


• Half the agencies that we questioned had very favorable things to say about Now (backed by 
Tencent) and Douyin (backed by Bytedance) sounds as if it is the hottest channel at the 
moment


• “It looks like Now will overtake Momo, no other platforms look likely to overtake Momo. Now has 
the huge Tencent platform for promotion.” – Large Agency #1


• “Now is becoming much better. The audience is fresher and the broadcasters are more 
authentic. Now only approves 30% of broadcasters compared with Momos 45%. The big 
spenders spend more on Now.” – Small Agency #6


• We are trying out other channels, Now is really good at the moment, Douyin has just started 
doing live broadcasting, so we are just monitoring it. Douyin is the hottest channel recently. –
Small Agency #4


• “Now platform traffic development is really good. Their traffic is constantly increasing. Momo's 
traffic is not as good. For us older agencies we can make money, new agencies cannot make 
money.” – Super Agency #7


• Momo growth is stabilizing after rapid expansion, current growth is very weak and it is a very 
risky period. Momo was the No 1 now it is not.  Now entertainment media is the leading content 
online. Fans like Douyin the most. Super Agency #8

a potential 40%-50% increase in cost of revenues

Key Advertising and Regulatory Findings From 
Talent Agency Interviews


Image
• Four of the agencies gave the unsolicited opinion that Momo has a reputation as a (sex) cam site.  We 


believe that this has directly contributed to Momo’s advertising woes


• “I don't think Momo will be a long lasting platform as its reputation is not good. In most people’s 
experience it is a live cam site for sex and this is something it cannot wash off.” Small Exclusive 
Agent #2


• “Momo is good for publicity. Most people think of Momo as a sex site which has predominantly male 
users.” – Super Agency #6


• “A successful broadcaster on Yizhibo would not survive on Momo.  Momo is low level.  Momo was 
successful because it was like a porn cam channel.  The users were 30 to 50 year old males in second 
and third tier cities.  Their motives were clear.  They wanted to see sex performances. Despite being 
cleaned up Momo is still this sort of channel and encourages people to climax. If Momo can not 
change directions then it will have a problem.” - Small Agency #9


• “90% of the audience are male.  They are not interested in art but more about sex.  Older men with 
their families in the US. They are lonely and spend a lot of money each month.” – Large Agency #11


New Regulation
• Two different agencies spoke about how new regulations have been introduced to “clean up” 


aspects of Live Broadcasting.  The new rules appear particularly relevant to Momo given the sites 
perceived image


• “There are lots of new restrictions like you cannot show breast area, 2/3 of the breast area must be 
covered. If you wear a short skirt you cannot drop things. You cannot broadcast lying in bed.  There 
are broadcasters breaking all of these rules.  Momo does not try to clean it up unless they are 
caught because they want the traffic and the money.  We do not have that sort of broadcaster on 
our roster. ” – Small Agency #9


• “Last year was a revolutionary year for our industry.  This year is a difficult year.  There are more 
regulatory restrictions on the industry.  Some popular broadcasters have been kicked out.  They 
were on the edge of regulations and using words and actions they should not use.  There are a lot 
of restrictions on clothing now.” – Large Agency #6
63


Key Takeaways From Interviews With Advertisers 


Marketing Manager in Shenyan


“Momo's approval of advertisers and brands is not as strict as Tencent's and Momo has advertising from every industry such as medical 
care, automobiles, and tourism. Tencent does not allow advertising for loans but Momo does.”


“Momo prices are 30%-50% cheaper than Baidu and Tencent.  However, the click through rate for Momo advertising is poor and no 
comparison to Baidu.  Baidu is doing precision marketing.”


“Momo and Tencent may have similar results, but the number of Momo users is much smaller than that of Tencent.  Momo needs to 
improve ad optimization to be useful.”


“The reputation of Momo in Shenyang is not very good. In the past year, there have been a dozen customers who had used Momo, and 
80 customers that used Tencent.  Momo is more suitable for national brands in a launch phase. Momo is not good for regional 
advertising.”


News Feed Advertising Operations in Shenzen 


“We are the company that does hair and freckle removal.  We find ads placed on Weibo the most effective. This is because of the high 
percentage of young female users on Weibo. The impact on Momo is terrible.”


“I see that other large beauticians advertise on Momo so they must be getting results.  I think that the biggest disadvantage for a 
company like us is that there are too many male users and I cannot think of any advantages.”


“Everyone knows that the reputation of Momo and it has a lot of negative news. Men use the site to find people to have sex with them.“


Marketing Manager in Beijing


“The coverage of Momo is too narrow. Their advertising impact is very low for the hotel industry. Compared with the news app 
“Headlines” and iqiyi (Search engine Baidu’s video service like YouTube), it is very ineffective.”


“Momo has one advertising option that is okay, it the location based advert.  If someone is within 5 km of our shop then they can see 
your ad.  Apart from that you have to place ads by city.  We have found that very ineffective.”


To enhance our understanding of Momo’s advertising prospects, we spoke with three local advertising 


companies.  Momo’s user demographic and brand were repeatedly cited as challenges to achieving 


broader appeal from a platform marketing perspective.
Valuation Downside Case
65


The Bull Case From Momo Analysts Is Easy To 
Refute Based On Our Research


• Agency model is a boon as improved content quality 
and diversity drives higher engagement and 
monetization in Live Video


Stock Promoter View Spruce Point View


• Live Stream demand has potentially already peaked and the 
shift in strategy may carry significant execution risks.  Many 
existing agencies are shifting talent away from Momo and 
considering diversifying their platform exposure.  Relative to 
self-directed talent, agencies are likely to demand higher 
payouts and additional incentives driving-up cost of revenues 
and pressuring margins.  Agency and related Momo agency 
ownership and accounting is a major red flag


• User growth acceleration continues as a result of 
current trend and increased sales and marketing


• Tantan acquisition is successful in expanding users and 
delivers attractive performance on a standalone basis


• Expanding use cases generates additional VAS revenue


• Based on our interviews, advertisers don’t want to be 
associated with Momo given the Company’s tainted brand and 
reputation as a (sex) cam site.  Management continues to 
table advertising out of fear for limiting engagement


• Mobile Marketing revenue continues to improve on a 
trajectory towards peers


• Smart phone sales have been weak in recent periods, and this 
may act as a headwind to near-term user growth rates.  
Management’s comments of looking towards 2nd and 3rd tier 
cities don’t sound like big revenue opportunities  


• VAS revenue is likely to continue to grow, but not all paid users 
are equal from a monetization standpoint.  Momo’s ability to 
maintain top talent and big spenders, a potential issue based 
on our interviews, is the biggest driver of financial results


• Momo likely overpaid for Tantan given the need to deflect 
attention from core live video slowing growth. Tantan is 
unproven as a profitable business model and may be a drag 
on earnings for the foreseeable future
66


The Entire Institutional World Is Bullish Momo, 
But Blind To The Risks Highlighted In Our Report


There is not a single dose of skepticism expressed with a “Sell” recommendation amongst the analyst 


community when it comes to Momo’s 12 month outlook.  Despite this view, analysts believe Momo is 


worth 23% more than its current price.  Spruce Point cannot find any evidence that analysts have done 


the same level of forward looking due diligence or risk analysis that we have.
