Best Short Idea In 2014: Organovo Holdings, Inc.
Mar. 10, 2014 8:40 AM ET136 comments
by: Jake Bergmann


Summary


ONVO's promise of creating "3d bio-printed organs" for humans is a pipe dream
decades away, and ONVO has neither the capital nor people necessary to succeed
at such a venture.


ONVO's 3D bioprinting technology is far too slow and expensive to deliver a viable
product for drug toxicity testing, the only near-term market identified by
management.


ONVO's patent protection is extremely weak and does not come close to claiming all
of the methods necessary to "print" human organs in the future.


ONVO scientific co-founder, Gabor Forgacs, has left his role at the company and is
pursuing more viable opportunities (synthetic leather & meat) with notable venture
capital backers.


ONVO executives are cashing out: the top three (Keith Murphy, Barry Michaels and
Sharon Presnell) have sold ~$7 million worth of ONVO stock and pay themselves
nearly $1 million annually.


[Editor's Note: Some facts have been corrected in this article after we were contacted by
Organovo's management]


I am writing this solely to demonstrate high quality trade ideas for my investment firm,
Valkyrie Capital. In doing so, I am putting my personal reputation (and that of my firm) on
the line. I am not a serial short seller and ONVO had originally been brought to me as a
long idea, but after some research, it has become my top short idea for 2014. While I am
short, I am not looking to deliberately "short and distort" either: my position is based on
detailed research, my own deductions and an expectation that Organovo's share price will
decline significantly before December 2014. It's also worth noting I do not post frequently
and my last post recommended long positions in Two Harbors (NYSE:TWO) LEAPs and
levered Annaly Capital (NYSE:NLY) preferred stock on December 16th, which are both up
more than 50% and 18% - 25%, respectively.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 2/50


With that said, I'm recommending a short position in Organovo Holdings, Inc.
(NASDAQ:ONVO) against a long position in Cellular Dynamics, International Inc.
(NASDAQ:ICEL) as well as buying ONVO puts across multiple maturities. This is the first
of two posts, which will detail my short Organovo thesis. The next post will detail my
reasons for upside in Cellular Dynamics.


Short Organovo Thesis


My opinion is that Organovo Holdings, Inc. is a reverse merger company that has grown to
nearly $1 billion in market cap (and uplisted to the NYSE MKT) through a spree of press
releases and what Valkyrie considers a cult-like investor following. Its single largest asset
is $49.8 million of cash raised from selling stock.


ONVO has not developed any products, and its 3D bioprinting "technology" is substantially
slower and more expensive than traditional cell culture techniques. ONVO has no credible
partnerships or institutional investors; the stock is driven solely by press releases and
hype. Once the hype subsides, I believe investors will realize there is no intrinsic value
beyond reported cash in the bank of $0.65 per share - a downside opportunity of more
than 93%.


Organovo investors should sell and instead buy shares of Cellular Dynamics, with a
current market cap of ~$300 million. ICEL "develops and manufactures fully functioning
human cells in industrial quantities to precise specifications." More specifically, Cellular
Dynamics uses stem cells to grow specific human cells, including hepatocytes, which are
the raw materials Organovo must purchase to create liver tissue. ICELs technology is
protected by more than 700 patents + applications and it addresses a near-term market
opportunity of more than $10 billion.


Additional Rationale for Shorting Organovo:


1. Promise of creating "3d bio-printed organs" for humans is a pipe dream decades away,
and ONVO has neither the capital nor people necessary to succeed at such a venture


2. ONVO's 3D bioprinting technology is far too slow and expensive to deliver a viable
product for drug toxicity testing, the only near-term market identified by management


3. ONVO's patent protection is extremely weak and does not come close to claiming all of
the methods necessary to "print" human organs in the future


4. ONVO has no real partnerships; both Autodesk and Knight Cancer Research are over
a year old and neither has claimed any progress since announcement


5. ONVO scientific co-founder, Gabor Forgacs, has left the company and is pursuing
more viable opportunities (synthetic leather & meat) with notable venture capital

backers
6. ONVO executives are cashing out: the top three (Keith Murphy, Barry Michaels and


Sharon Presnell) have sold ~$7 million worth of ONVO stock and pay themselves
nearly $1 million per year while ONVO has no recurring revenue and a burn rate of
~$12 million per year


7. ONVO has few institutional shareholders compared to its peers, and its stock price
appears to be driven by Google searches for "ONVO" rather than revenue or cash flow


Catalysts: 1) I think ONVO's PR campaign is overextended and the speculative money
has been made; 2) Management is both issuing and selling shares on the open market; 3)
based on its own milestones the Company must prove it has a viable product by
December 2014.


Macro Background: 3D Printing


Commercial 3D printing attracted Valkyrie's attention in 2011 with the Economist's feature
"Print me a Stradivarius." At that time, total 3D printing revenues were ~$2 billion
(primarily prototyping and some limited manufacturing) and cash flow earned by the
market leaders, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD), was a
scant $70 million or so. Fast forward to today and cash flow for these two companies has
doubled to ~$140 million while their market cap increased to nearly $14 billion at the peak.


While commercialized 3D manufacturing may be revolutionary, we are in the very early
days. If the tech bubble taught us anything, it should be that 100x EV/EBITDA ratios are
not good investments - no matter how promising the technology. There is just too much
risk associated with early stage ventures to pay exorbitant prices.


Nowhere in my research, however, did I find viable investments in 3D bioprinting of human
organs. To be honest, I first heard about bioprinting through my wife because 3D organs
were featured on Grey's Anatomy. It makes great television, but the technology is decades
away at the earliest. Regular 3D printing is in its infancy: 3D bioprinting of living human
organs for implant is still a pipe dream.


Today 3D bioprinting is almost exclusively performed as research, and I can't find any
information on a "market" for 3D bioprinting. One group estimates a potential market of
$112 million by 2020 and $307 million by 2023. This is tiny and 6-9 years away. Moreover,
ONVO isn't even the leader in 3D bioprinting or regenerative medicine (as is often claimed
by investors). A simple Google search up turns up several prominent universities doing
more advanced work than Organovo:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 4/50


The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (which is moving away from
bioprinting due to high cost)
Princeton and Cornell have printed working human ears
University of Pennsylvania is printing vascular networks
Chinese universities are printing kidneys
A Sunnyvale, CA open source hackerspace group known as BioCurious (yes, really)
even created their own 3D bioprinter from scratch using, "a couple of old CD drives, an
inkjet cartridge, and an Arduino"!


Hepatotoxicity Testing is Intensely Competitive


Understandably, Organovo doesn't pretend 3D organs are around the corner, but instead
focuses on printing 3D liver samples for drug toxicity testing (known as hepatotoxicity).
Hepatotoxicity testing, however, is not a revolutionary new market; it is an intensely
competitive niche of pharmaceutical drug development.


(Source:"Diagnosing the decline in pharmaceutical R&D efficiency." Jack W. Scannell,
Alex Blanckley, Helen Boldon & Brian Warrington. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 11,
191-200 (March 2012)."


To better understand the opportunity in hepatotoxicity, I consulted Ph.D.s and academic
research (the most important of which is available here). The short story is that big
pharma is spending more on drug development while receiving fewer FDA approvals
(humorously referred to "Eroom's Law" in the pharma industry).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 5/50


Specifically, big pharma now spends almost 20% of revenue (~$70 billion annually) on
drug R&D. Only 5 out of every 10,000 compounds reach clinical trials and of these only 2-
3 out of 10 recoup their cost. In total, the average cost to develop a new drug (including
failures) is $0.4 - $1.8 billion and can take 10-15 years from discovery to approval.


Hepatotoxicity is a major cause (estimated up to 1/3) of drug development failure. Up to
50% of liver failure is caused by "Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)" and during 1995 - 2005,
34 drugs were withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity.


Due to the high cost of drug development and high likelihood of hepatotoxicity, it is
crucially important for big pharma to test for hepatotoxicity early and accurately. To-date,
there have been two methods for testing a drug's hepatotoxicity: in vivo ("in the body")
with live rats or in vitro ("outside the body") with 2D or 3D liver tissue samples.


It is important to note here that 3D liver test samples - considered the Holy Grail by
Organovo's management - already exist and are being supplied to most of the big pharma
companies at low cost by InSphero. InSphero can produce tens of thousands of 3D
cultures in a matter of days compared to a full month required to produce 400 samples by
ONVO.


I questioned Organovo's CFO and IR team via email about InSphero, specifically asking,
"I've heard that 3D printing of liver tissue is substantially slower and far more expensive
than traditional cell culture techniques employed by InSphero? What do you view as
Organovo's competitive advantage in hepatotoxicity testing?" IR's reply is telling:


"In regard to 3D liver competitive positioning - we believe that the data that we have
publicly described demonstrates superiority over the current market standard which
dominates market share, the use of hepatocytes in traditional 2D cell culture. We
also believe that because we are actively working towards launching the world's only
3D liver tissue that recreates human liver structure and activity, that if we reach that
goal, our 3D liver tissue will offer characteristics superior to all potential competitor
products."


I love "actively working towards" and "if we reach that goal" (I could say the same thing
about winning the lottery)! More importantly, Organovo does not even address their
primary competitor, InSphero, or the higher cost and time it takes for Organovo to produce
the same 3D product as InSphero. Instead, it states the "data publicly described" (note it's
data, not a product) is superior traditional 2D cell culture.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 6/50


In regards to 3D samples being superior, there isn't yet conclusive scientific evidence that
3D samples are superior to 2D samples. 2D samples can be more easily measured for
hepatotoxicity whereas 3D samples cannot be viewed in the same plane (which makes
toxicity measurements difficult). Moreover, in vitro testing (either 2D or 3D) will never fully
replace in vivo testing with live rats, because even 3D liver tissue cannot accurately
replicate the complexity of a living organ.


Per the above cited paper by van Tonder, Steenkamp and Gulumian:


"The ultimate goal of predictive toxicology would be to develop techniques that can
be used in vitro. However, it should also be noted that it is highly unlikely that animal
studies will be avoided altogether, at least not for the foreseeable future, which
leaves room for in vivo profiling technologies as adjuvants to conventional safety
pharmacology testing. In fact, it may help justify the use of animals for safety
pharmacology testing. It is not impossible to employ these technologies using in vitro
platforms, but more research is necessary to develop and establish effective
methodologies and biomarkers."


Hepatotoxicity testing is an important decision milestone in drug development, but
Organovo's potential product (if developed) will not be a silver bullet. It will be too
expensive and too slow and face intense competition from InSphero (backed by
RedAlpine), Hurel (backed by Sanofi-Aventis), Vivo Biosciences and heavyweights like
Sigma-Aldrich (NASDAQ:SIAL) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO).


Intellectual Property is Weak


As outlined above, Organovo isn't the only company (or even the first) to create a 3D
bioprinter. Of note, EnvisionTEC, a German company, has been selling its 3D Bioplotter
since 2001. Second, Organovo didn't even create its own "NovoGen MMX Bioprinter" in
house: development was outsourced to an Australian company named Invetech. Anthony
Bozza, of Lakewood Capital Management, also found the NovoGen MMX to be something
of a joke in his letter and this article:

"We were lucky enough to have found one university professor (and
prominent tissue researcher) who had evaluated Organovo's machine for
purchase…she pointed out that it was cheaper to build the machine in-house
with 'a few grad students.' Surely, a machine made by 'a few grad students'
would never match up against the revered product of a $1 billion market
capitalization company like Organovo," his letter notes, setting up the punch
line. "We asked the professor how much they had to sacrifice in terms of
quality by making it themselves. She responded, 'Oh no, our machine is
better.'"


Third, and most importantly, investors hoping Organovo's patents will claim all rights to 3D
organ printing are going to be disappointed:


The Clemson patent (US Patent No 7051654) only claims a method for forming viable
cells, "wherein at least about 25% of said cells remain viable on said substrate after
incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in a 5% CO.sub.2/95% O.sub.2 environment"
- hardly an all-encompassing claim on 3D organ printing (who wants a 25% alive
organ?).
The first Forgacs patent (US Patent No 8241905) appears to provide the broadest
protection, but only includes one claim covering "A method of producing a three-
dimensional biological engineered tissue" with no mention of cell life-span or entire
organ fabrication.
Organovo has another 5 applications into the USPTO (see patent application numbers
20140012407, 20130345794, 20130190210, 20130164339, 20120116568), but all the
application dates are within the past 1-3 years. For those unfamiliar with patent law, an
invention must be statutory, useful, non-obvious, and new. Both EnvisionTEC and Dr.
Anthony Atala at Wake Forest have publicly discussed and demonstrated 3D
bioprinting technology more than a year before Organovo existed, which is longer than
the 1 year requirement to be considered "new" under Section 102 of US Code 35.
Thus, I think Organovo has a minimal chance of receiving additional patents on
its 3D bioprinting process.


The intellectual property required to engineer living human organs will likely require
hundreds or thousands of patents claiming every method of fabrication. Claiming that a
single company (especially one with just 3 patents!) owns the rights to the entire 3D
bioprinting process is absurd. It's like claiming a single company owns all the rights to
manufacturing motor vehicles or smartphones.

By comparison, Cellular Dynamics has over 700 patents+applications for the manufacture
of human cells. At a $235 million market cap, ICEL trades at $335,714 per patent vs.
ONVO's outrageous $114 MILLION per patent. Yes, that means ONVO is 340 times more
expensive than ICEL on a per patent basis! And as a prelude to my next post, ICEL also
has a bigger market opportunity and a far more credentialed and experienced
management team.


Organovo's Partnerships are Questionable at Best


Organovo's lack of in-house technology or valuable patents probably explains why they
can't find a long-term research partner or acquirer. Investor presentations and press
releases hype up "partnerships" with pharmaceutical (like Pfizer, Harvard and UTH here)
but the only one I can verify with the actual partner is Knight Cancer Institute, and when I
called, Knight said there was nothing new they could report and they couldn't provide
further info without approval from Organovo. I ran into similar walls with Autodesk and
Invetech, both whom had to "check with the company first" and then never followed-up or
couldn't comment. Interestingly, L'Oreal (which ONVO claims as a partner) lists its
research partners for toxicity testing online:


"Private Sector Partnerships" refers to for-profit enterprise and Organovo is not listed (but
most of its competitors are there).


I also called multiple departments at L'Oreal, Pfizer and United Therapeutics. No one at
those companies knew of a partnership with Organovo. These are all large companies, so
it's possible I didn't find the right department or person. Given the importance of these
partnerships, however, I think investors should demand more information from Organovo's

management than a press release that says, "Organovo Holdings, Inc. has entered into an
agreement with L'Oreal exploring the use of 3D skin for testing skin care products. Terms
have not been disclosed."


Moreover, management hasn't provided any progress on other partnerships, many of
which are several years old but still touted in public investor presentations. When I
questioned IR about the partnerships, it refused to provide an update, responding:


"you noted that 'I've already reached out to contacts at Invetech, Autodesk and
Knight Cancer Research (all of whom declined to provide an update) and I've been
unable to identify the key people at United Therapeutics, Pfizer or L'Oreal.' We are
not trying to be overly harsh or reactionary in saying this, but we think it's entirely
appropriate for these partners to decline to update you, and entirely inappropriate
that you reached out to them directly."


Okay, "we are not trying to be overly harsh or reactionary," REALLY? I've spoken with
many management teams, and this is the first that DID NOT want me to speak with their
business partners and/or clients. Most companies love to make introductions to their
customers and business partners. They'll cherry pick the best ones, but they always
provide contact information for clients who can verify said company's services. Organovo
has no real customers to speak of, and they refuse to provide contact info or updates on
their partnerships? Does this mean they can't even find one partner they trust enough to
talk positively about the company?


I seriously question if all of these hyped up partnerships actually exist, and I certainly think
Organovo's management owes its shareholders regular progress updates on these
partnerships since they have no meaningful quarterly earnings to report.


Gabor Forgacs, the Scientific Co-Founder, has Moved on to Greener Pastures


In my view, however, the most telling sign of Organovo's weak competitive position is the
exit of its scientific co-founder, Dr. Gabor Forgacs, and his son, Andras Forgacs. The
Forgacs moved on to new ventures in 2013 to pursue what I believe is a more viable
business model in 3D bioprinting: synthetic leather and cultured meat. Organovo's
management claims Gabor still "consults" with ONVO, but that is yet another "claim" - like
ONVO's partnerships - that is impossible to verify. What we do know is that Andras
resigned from the Board of Directors and Gabor is no longer listed on the website.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 10/50


More importantly, the Forgacs's new company, Modern Meadow, is built on the same
intellectual property as Organovo and is backed by Peter Thiel's Breakout Foundation,
Artis Ventures, ULU Ventures, the Singularity University, the USDA and the National
Science Foundation. None of these notable venture investors have backed Organovo. In
fact, it seems Organovo has rarely had a significant percentage of institutional investors -
even its first $3.5M "angel" round included 57 people!


ONVO Has Few Institutional Investors; Share Price Appears Driven by Google
Searches


Institutional holdings of Organovo are only 16.4% according to Morningstar, of which 8.9%
are owned by ETFs, leaving less than 10% owned by institutions that perform professional
security analysis. Other large biotech firms have institutional ownership percentages
between 80% and 90%, and even ICEL (at a $235M market cap), has 58% institutional
ownership. Institutional owners typically perform more due diligence than most retail
investors, so the lack of institutional owners or partners should be a red flag for investors.


Another red flag should be the correlation between Google searches for ONVO and the
stock price. I pulled the frequency of searches for "ONVO" and compared it to the stock
price over the past 2 years. It appears that ONVO's share price is driven more by Google
searches than any fundamental measurement. I may be old school for thinking this, but
shouldn't the share price go up based on revenue and earnings rather than publicity?


Organovo's Management Team is Cashing Out


The R&D team may be researching real challenges in 3D organ printing, but the
management team looks like it's using the high share price and public financings to cash
out personally. Keith Murphy, the CEO, even warns investors to ignore "short and distort"
articles. Blind adherence is rarely a good investment strategy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 11/50


While asking its shareholders to ignore the short sellers, Organovo's management team is
selling $7.4 million worth of shares, with CEO Keith Murphy unloading $1M per month
since November 2013. The salaries of the top three insiders combined (CEO Keith
Murphy, CFO Barry Michaels and CTO Sharon Presell) are more than $800k per year -
this is multiples of what Organovo paid to license its hyped-up patent rights!! Management
should not get rich while burning through shareholder cash. Most start-up founders pay
themselves less than $75K/year, and Peter Thiel (notably NOT an investor in Organovo)
describes low founder salaries as an indicator of success because: "It goes to whether the
mission of the company is to build something new or just collect paychecks. In practice we
have found that if you only ask one question, ask that."


Per Seeking Alpha's due diligence requirements, I asked Organovo IR about the high
salaries and stock sales. Their response (predictably) is to simply quote their Rule 10b5-1
trading plan and Compensation Committee filings. They claim compensation is in line (or
even below) peers, but per Peter Thiel's advice, investors should question management's
motives, especially given the long time and low probability of ONVO ever delivering a
viable product.


Organovo requested a clarification to the above paragraph; asking me to note that their
response only referred to 10b5-1 and Compensation Committee filings, asked for my
"exact comparison peer companies" and that "it was compensation strategy of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to provide a cash component to
executives that was significantly below median for our peer group."


As noted in the paragraph above, I maintain that ONVO should not have become a public
company until they had developed viable products that generate sustainable revenue.
Thus, its management compensation should be similar to an early development stage or
start-up company. Per ONVO's objection, however, I will also detail my opinion on why
their executive compensation is still high relative to publicly traded peers:


Using Morningstar, I compared both CEO and Total Executive annual compensation
(including salary, stock options, etc - but excluding stock sales) to both ttm revenue and
ttm burn rate (defined as total operating expenses) for all biotech companies which went
public in 2012. Because ONVO is a pre-revenue, development stage company, I believe
the best way to compare executive compensation among different sized companies is not
absolute dollars, but rather the percent of either revenue or operation expenses spent on
executive compensation.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 12/50


I divided ONVO's public peers into two groups: 1) Development Stage (either zero or
<$5M ttm revenue) including KYTH, ICPT, DRTX, TSRO, SUPN and MSTX; and 2)
Revenue Stage (>$5M ttm revenue) including RGLS, HPTX, MACK, CCXI, CEMP and
VSTM. On average, Development Stage biotech firms pay their CEO 3% of burn rate and
they pay their entire executive team 6% of burn rate. ONVO pays its CEO 8% of burn rate
and its entire management 22% of burn rate - that is 2.9x and 3.7x the average for
development stage peers.


If anything, ONVO's executive compensation is more in line with revenue stage peers
(which ONVO is not yet at revenue stage). Full detail is provided in this spreadsheet. All
data is from Morningstar:


Management's historical performance doesn't help either. There is no demonstrated
record of start-up success and Barry Michaels prior two stints as a public company CFO
ended as zeroes:

In addition to cashing out personally, management has filed a shelf registration to issue
shares "at-the-market." Their investor presentation (page 29) claims it is less dilutive than
a marketed public offering, but we strongly suspect it is because they cannot attract any
institutional investors to anchor another share raise. So they are selling shares directly to
retail buyers in the open market!


The entertainment continues with the following slide justifying "the importance of sufficient
capital." "7.5% dilution would double opportunities" (dilution isn't bad, it's great!) and
"Avoid more significant dilution during market downturns or when cash on hand is low"
(aka [in my opinion] we gotta sell this sh*t while it's hot!). Best of all is page 31 warning
investors to, "remain on guard against spurious information." That's good advice in
general - does it also apply to Organovo's investor presentations?


Summary, Valuation and Trade Idea


Given all of the above information, it's interesting to take a look at "Organovo Highlights"
from the Investor Relations section of the website:
5/23/2018 Best Short Idea In 2014: Organovo Holdings, Inc. - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 15/50


1. Statement number one is just false: as best we can tell EnvisionTEC developed the
world's first commercial 3D bioprinting technology


2. Statement number two might technically be true, but InSphero creates "fully cellular"
3D liver tissue (and sells it for profit!) faster and in greater quantities than ONVO -
adding the bioprinter just takes longer; it's like bragging about building a house behind
schedule and over budget


3. Number 3: Should I invest because they were written up in MIT's tech review?
4. Number 4: TIME? Really? Not even technical validation there…
5. Number 5: There is no timeline, no financial details were released (I bet ONVO is


paying ADSK) and ADSK hasn't confirmed they are actually doing anything!
6. Number 6: This is the real kicker - they list 15 media outlets but no customers or


partners!


Since inception, Organovo has earned a paltry $0.04 of revenue per share, spent $13.5
million on R&D, issued 29 press releases and raised $77 million in capital. In a best case
scenario ONVO is barely worth the $0.64 per share of cash on its books (and even this
will probably be paid out to lawyers and liquidators).


Organovo has minimal institutional shareholders combined with stock uplistings, large
insider ownership and exciting new technology. It reminds me of the Poseidon Concepts
hydraulic fracking pool scheme that blew up last year. POOSF was listed on the TSX 500,
made it to the $1 billion valuation mark and even had a big 4 auditor! Its management

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 16/50


team owned more than 10% of the outstanding stock. The company was constantly in the
media and even picked up equity analysts from large Canadian banks (Organovo hasn't
even done that). Everyone was in love with Poseidon Concepts: then it collapsed.


Therefore, I recommend shorting ONVO stock against a long position in Cellular
Dynamics and buying put options on ONVO. ONVO shares are liquid with ~2 days to
cover per the last NASDAQ report, but the borrow rate ranges from 27% - 39% if you can
even find shares to short. Options are surprisingly liquid for ONVO, so I'd recommend a
short call spread and long puts.*


*Note there was some confusion about option strategies on my last post. This is just an
example of how Valkyrie executes trades: options are not for everyone and you should
consult your own financial advisor and do your own due diligence before making any
financial decision.


Risks


1. ONVO's share price trades on hope and dreams and the milestones are set by
the company, so management could continue the charade for a while. I think the
PR campaign has run its course and take my cue from management that now is the
time to sell. They've set December 2014 as their milestone for delivering a viable liver
toxicity assay, and I think a lack of progress and/or sales will disappoint before then.
Also, the long position in ICEL should hedge against any irrational bull run in biotech
stocks.


2. The US government is increasing its funding for 3D printing and Organovo could
get a significant research grant. There are dozens of universities developing this
technology with better teams and credentials than Organovo, but never underestimate
government ineptitude.


3. Organovo could be acquired by a larger pharmaceutical or biotech company. We
think this is extremely unlikely. Organovo has been shopping its ideas around for two
years now without any serious suitors or institutional investors.


4. Short Squeeze. This is always possible, especially in a bull market. However, the
stock is very liquid with ~2 days to cover and there aren't any large Carl Icahns who
might corner me on this, so I think the likelihood of a deliberate short squeeze is quite
low.


Conclusion

schemes:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 17/50


The company is usually recently founded through the reverse merger of a shell
company and with the name changed accordingly to address a particular exciting
disruptive technology such as 3D Printing, Nano Drug Delivery, Graphene, Solar, etc.)
The company possesses one patent or a small number of patents that are said to
address an application of said disruptive technology. These patents will usually be
acquired in the reverse merger or invented by someone in senior management whose
credentials and past successes are heavily touted.
The company's marketing materials, financial statements, SEC filings, etc., will expand
upon in great detail the size of the market opportunity and just how exciting of an
opportunity exists as opposed to the success of their product in capturing revenue
from said market application.
Many individuals on stock message boards such as the ones found on Yahoo Finance
will suddenly start posting messages touting the merits of the stock using phrases
such as "load up," "get on the train," "the next Microsoft," "easy ten bagger," etc.
Any constructive criticism of the company will be met with accusations of short selling
when in fact the short selling of OTC stocks is very difficult and rare.
The company will not have any significant revenues but will keep announcing
partnerships, memorandums of understanding, and agreements that never result in
meaningful revenues.
In addition to the original technology focus, the company will then start to identify other
application opportunities for their technology when the original opportunity does not
transpire.
They will then continue issuing private placements to support the company until the
share price completely collapses and the long-term shareholders are left holding
shares that are worthless.

Looking at their profiles I can only assume CDM Capital is the Author. Their SA profiles are almost Identical.
CDM Capital does not even have a website. This Authors website could of been made better at WIX. Neither
of them have a real office yet they are both Hedge fund managers. Who gives money to a hedge fund that is

Jake Bergmann Great try and great article to try and get shorts aboard. I agree with the other comment above,
jumping on the 3 D bashing articles. As You know ONVO is a speculative Biotech company and not really a 3D
company but uses 3D technology. All of us investors have heard this articles drum beat over and over but know
better.  
Many who follow this stock are Investors and have done their "DD" research. Many believe in ONVO and have added
this company as a speculative investment. We have read ONVO's web site and news. We know what the company is
doing. We know this company has been around since about 2007 and 2008. We believe in its current
accomplishments. We have also watched ONVO follow the highs, lows,short option moves and the market correction
with the 3D sector. Even as you know from your research, ONVO is not a 3D company, ONVO is a biotech using 3 D
technology. 
We know ONVO is not developing human organs at this time. However we believe in the technology and in ONVO to
use it. We also know that 3 D has made advancements in the medical field. They have made a human pelvis for a
cancer patient and have made prosthetic limbs, bionic ears and much more.  
I believe ONVO is contributing in medical science to assist with a better quality of life and save or extend human life.
ONVO is continually attracting other Medical Research programs that also believe in ONVO and its work.

With all due respect, but there is no such thing as a "speculative investment". You are either a speculator or
an investor. You can't be both - at least not with the same asset that you invest in or speculate in, respectively.

I do invest. And I do short from time to time in small amounts and only via options. In the strict sense, these
short positions are more a speculation than an investment mainly because of the time factor involved (options
expire at some point, theta and all that stuff).


13 Mar 2014, 09:51 AM

@tduong11: You didn't get my point. An investment can never be speculative. If it is "speculative", it will cease
to be an investment. A similar nonsense are "toxic securities" - there is no such thing. The only thing toxic
may be the price you pay. An AAA-bond may be "toxic" when you pay way too much for it and a D-rated bond
may be a good investment when bought under the right circumstances.


I know, most people regard this a s a purely academic issue. But it is not. Clarity about the risk-reward profile
is essential to long-term success in financial markets. Mudding its own waters at the verbal level is counter-
productive in this regard.

Ahh, here's the problem ECapo with your position . . . you 'read ONVO's website and news'.


All you're going to get from the company is some serious rah rah rah with no objectivity. After all they're
relentless promoters of the company as both the insiders and the company sell more stock to the retail public.


By now ONVO's down nearly 50% since the peak last Nov and most of the longs here are looking at growing
losses. The question you need to ask yourself is whether you want to ride this all the way down. Fair value is
still a long ways lower.

Ahh, here's the problem Mukticat with your comment!


But first a question Mukticat. Did you get caught short at ONVO's Peak November 18, 2013 at $13.65 and
loose a great deal and now so bitter to not move on to another stock? If you want to gamble as a short maybe
go put all your money on black or red at a casino. But if you want to invest in a bio speculative stock buy one.


Mukticat again..and again I will say: if you or anyone does not like or believe in ONVO do not invest in it...I
again state "INVEST" 
Your information is repetitive, and not necessarily relevant to this company a lot of the time and does not
include supporting analysis. I see from your posted bio you state you are: 
"Professional full-time trader (since 1999) specializing in both long and short opportunities."I am not a "
"Professional full-time trader (since 1999) specializing in both long and short opportunities."  
You seem to have an obsession with ONVO and a very large short position which can go bad any day. 
I guess I may conclude that with all the approx: 200 and adding more all the time negative comments on
ONVO Since May 2013, you are and have been shorting ONVO. I guess I can conclude if ONVO stock
increases every time since your negative comments you loose money. You are not a analyst and if you are
you are not showing your track record as analyst. And if you are they or a dime a dozen and like the saying
goes ( show me the money) or Mukticat your track record as an analyst.  
As I have noted before I am just an average retired investor and trader trying to manage my income and I do
not short stocks.

Very nice piece, we have done similar work on the name. We have contacted some drug discovery experts at a few
major pharma companies and we have yet to hear anyone who thinks ONVO has a viable product. We think this

We went from horse and carriage to walking on the moon in less than 100 years....where will ONVO be in ten?


11 Mar 2014, 12:51 PM


oofoofoof
In 10 yrs ONVO will be at ZERO. 
The moon landing was accomplished by massive govt. investment. ONVO does not have access to that kind
of money. 
I bought into the hype and owned this stock for a while, then did some research and discovered too many red
flags and sold it for a loss. I have no positions now.

I'm concerned the author is stating that co-founders leaving is a negative. Actually, if there is a difference in opinion, it
can be very positive for both entrepreneurs. Clearly, in this case, that is true since another organization was formed
with a different bio-product goal. Not focusing for a startup can be damaging.


Also, your process for validating partnerships is questionable. "These are all large companies, so it's possible I didn't
find the right department..." random calling departments really is not due diligence.


Bozza's comment really lacks value. Most college professors should be able to teach their students to engineer/build
a better product prototype. The question is whether they could mass produce it. If they were intending to your polling
a competitor, if not, then the're is a lack of insight into mass production.


The patent discussion is interesting, but the competitor comparison lacks details.

I would actually say that this is one stock def. not to touch at all. Especially on the short side.


Keep in mind everyone knows that 3D printing of organs is probably going to take a decade but 3 printing of organs to
be used by biotech companies for initial drug testing is probably very close and that by itself can push this much
higher - Its a billion dollar market


I say the risk reward on this does not pan out.


It could go to pennies but the odds of it going much higher too makes this a very risky short


My advice is - Sit back and Watch

Last month they delivered their first assay of produced liver "tissue". This was done two months earlier than
promised. The liver tissue sensitivity process is what is important here! Not the printing of organs!


The new assay extended the life of the tissue from 2 days to 40 days. This allows the toxicity tests to last
longer, for stronger results, thus providing a test on living human tissue and not animals. Animal testing does
not always translate favorably to human usage of drugs!


11 Mar 2014, 01:22 PM


cynicoptimist
Complex organs cannot be 3D printed. Not even in 10+ years. But sooner than that they will be grown in bio-
reactors. Simple organs 3D? Maybe? A pnis is probably even too complex for 3D. Sorry, just reality.

Excellent article! You touch on many of the reasons why ONVO is headed for the ash-heap of history; weak patents,
poor institutional coverage, no sales, no significant partnerships (with real revenues), major dilution and aggressive
insider selling, a non-stop media campaign to hype themselves to retail (ie- dumb) money such as the 'Retail Investor
Conferences' and on and on.


11 Mar 2014, 01:40 PM


Mark T. Phillips, Contributor
Agree with Mukticat; investors frequently buy into these 'dream' stocks with no regard for the price they pay.


In the end, a stock is only worth the present value of it's future discounted cash flows and substantial
revenues let alone profits are a LONG way off for ONVO.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 27/50


(Oh yes, also sold 1/3 of my 3D systems at $93.71, and the balance at $78.40 with a split adjusted cost basis of
$25.65)


Why would you NOT short 3D systems with a much greater potential for larger dollar returns, vs. ONVO? Let's see, I
can short ONVO and my maximum profit potential is ~$10/share, or, I could short 3D Systems and have a potential of
20,30, or maybe 40 dollars per share return.


As I have said in the past, and will continue to say, ONVO is "ad-venture" capital. Call it a "developmental stage
company" if it makes you feel better.


I hold my long term "investment" shares at a cost of $2.33 per share. If the stock goes to $0, I accept that as a
"businessman's risk" for investing. In the meantime, trading the stock between $7-10 dollars per share, can be
profitable, buying protective puts, selling calls, whatever.


Is ONVO "THE" company in Bio-Printing? What any end user of product wants is a company that makes a product,
AND, makes it correctly. Revenues and product expansion come as a result of producing one product, sticking with it,
becoming a success, then expanding from there.


Taking you back to those thrilling days of yesteryear, a "boots on the ground" approach in the semiconductor
production and sales industry. When the "suits" came walking through your plant and had a sit down confidential
discussion with management, one could figure it was only a matter of time when an announcement would be made
that your company had been selected as a "source" for a particular chip. Especially if you had one of the hottest chips
on the market. ISO 9000 was a standard that was used for consideration of such chips and when the "suits" spoke,
people paid real attention. (O.K. the "suits" was our reference for IBM. Most people in the Valley did not wear suits,
unless it was upper management because they knew the "suits" were coming.) In order to get IBM business, there
had to be 3 different companies to source from.


With the "shotgun" approach to 3D printing virtually exploding at current levels, seemingly everybody will have a 3D
printer soon. It's more "what" you do with the printer, how well you do it, and potential for expansion of product line.  
If I were to really "worry", I would be concerned with all the "machinists" who may lose employment if they don't start
converting to 3D manufacturing. 
Query? Why is GE getting "into" 3d printing? 
The key driving force for 3D printing/manufacturing is the conversion factor. Computer software is necessary to make
the transitions. EVERYTHING will eventually be written in code. He who has the key wins! (Take a look at DASTY and
ADBE) 
For ONVO, once they are THE standard for liver tissue, stem cells can't be far behind (STEM will want to place orders
instead of using human embryos for research.) They can continue to Bio-Print other items as well, as long as they get
the codes. Do they have to be the ONLY company that does this? No.


Looking to the future, let's say Pfizer needs some "fatty tissue" in bulk for research of whatever, and, they have the
cellular software, they send the software and the order to ONVO and 2 other companies one day, and within the
week, the order is filled.


We are moving into a new "technological production" age, and, ONVO is an "ad-venture" capital company in that new
age. Can they go out of business? Sure. Am I willing to take that risk vs. the potential for long term reward? You bet.

Last, might I point out one of my greatest coups? CMGI 
Look it up. Bought at 27, after merger, sold it at $152. Bought back in at 10 3/8, rode it to ZERO. You don't win on
every trade but, in the case of ONVO, I think I would rather be long than wrong.


11 Mar 2014, 01:58 PM


fxfx
you will be long and wrong on this one. 
apart from that, it is meaningless whether you short a stock at $10, $40 or $10,000 - you can always make
100% at the maximum if you sell it just short. Of course, you could make a fraction or a multiple of that
percentage, if you apply options strategies.


12 Mar 2014, 07:50 AM


Buckland
That does it for me. I had a small position in ONVO, which I just sold today. This article makes perfect sense--
especially to a guy who has been burned--twice--by small bio startups (both of which are now out of business).


I'll take the proceeds (at a 10% loss) and either purchase more FB, TRIP, DNKN, or a bio that looks like it's really
going somewhere...like ILMN.


The first line in ONVO's company description speaks volumes to me: "Organovo Holdings, Inc. (Organovo), formerly
Real Estate Restoration & Rental, Inc., is a development-stage company."


"Real Estate Restoration?" Are you kidding me?! May as well buy an ice cream shop that formerly made anvils.

Ummm, shorting a $10 stock that goes to $5 or a $60 stock that goes to $30 is the same % return. Using "dollars per
share return" as a whacky metric that ignores how much capital you risked up front doesn't make a lot of sense....


In my opinion ONVO is a complete and utter joke. Overvalued at half the price.


11 Mar 2014, 02:41 PM


Mukticat
Something not mentioned in your article is that the one and only bonafide analyst this stock ever had - Jason
Napolitano of Zacks - has severely panned this stock. As recently as last December he was asked in an SA interview
what he thought about ONVO.


Here's his response:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 29/50


'(SA): You have covered Organovo (ONVO) previously, and 3D printing remains alluring to retail investors. What do
our readers need to know to succeed in this space?


(JN): Avoid it. There's too much hype in the stock and too much risk for this investment to make sense for retail
investors right now. Organovo is a very interesting company with almost science-fiction like technology. Unfortunately,
the valuation is completely ridiculous because of the hype around 3D printing and I don't see how investing in this
name at today's valuation makes sense. Public Enemy said it best in 1988: Don't Believe the Hype.'


then later in the same article-


'(SA): Alternatively, what name do you see presenting the greatest risk to investors in the year ahead?


(JN): Above you asked about Organovo. I like the technology. I was a big fan of Organovo when the stock was $2 and
$3 per share. At nearly $10, I just don't see it.'


http://seekingalpha.co...


Remember that Napodano is the only analyst to be given full access to ONVO's results. From what he's seen he has
a stock price target of $3 - 5 for ONVO; generous in my opinion but so be it.

Your "professional" also made these comments


Answering this question is a little above my head. I know a good deal about Organovo's current technology,
but not so much as to where they will be in say, 3-5 years. I know when I speak to management about this
kind of "science fiction" stuff they tell me the technology isn't quiet there yet, but is heading in that direction.
But I simply don't know enough about exactly where is falls short to provide you with a good answer.

Another response from your "professional"


So this article is mostly "facts" with some forecasting and prediction from me, which I try to distinguish by
saying "We believe..." or "We model...". We = Me, but it sounds nicer if I pretend like I have a huge staff of
recent MBA grads slaving over SEC filings and financial models.

over $6.


2 - I do have a Neutral position on the stock and would not chase it here.' and, 'Ok, i defended the stock

and,


'I would think pure momentum. The fundamentals do not support this price level.'


'http://seekingalpha.co...


It's pretty clear what Napodano thinks of ONVO's prospects and their stock price; grossly overvalued. It hasn't
changed in the last year. Can you name one other financial analyst who's been given full review of ONVO's
books?


PS- This is a re-posting of a post that was deleted by mistake by SA. Some long complained that this was a

Guys, don't argue with someone who puts his 'research' (quotes because regurgitating what everybody knows
already isn't one) online and then disappears, not commenting anymore, because his mission is accomplished.


ONVO never promised bioprinting organs, although that may be a distant possibility. I certainly didn't go long on the
promise of printed organ replacements, but on the other exceptional opportunities that were promised for later *this*
year (and we're ahead of schedule as most of you will know).

I See you are back and welcome! I last thought you said good bye and good luck to all of us concerning ONVO? I
assume you are holding a short position again on ONVO . I am still only the average investor believing in ONVO and
its goals. I still am not the short betting and taking short positions to make money if ONVO is driven down. I must say
soon I will adding more to my position. I would write more but I refer you to above: 
just1tom comments.  
I wish I was as well versed as he and he has said it much better than I. 
Could you please present more recent news on ONVO. If analyst were correct all the time I would be spending the
rest of my life doing more than reading SA. All have various win and loss track records. I have no new information on
ONVO I admit since our last comments to each other.  
I would be very interested if you have more accurate current information than repeating old comments concerning
ONVO. I think the above analyst was commented on many times in the last short article. 
It is sad ONVO has to ride down on the short comments that are affecting 3D but like I said ONVO is a Biotech using
3D technology and yes I am hoping more success in helping medical research and the medical science field. ONVO
is a good speculative biotech stock at this time.

I disagree with almost all the points made in this article. Here are some counter points: 
1. Academic founders do not stay long-term at companies to run them. They are not operational experts; they bring
ideas and vision then move on to the next thing.  
2. The first substantive paragraph of any license and collaboration agreement prohibits disclosure of terms or details

by either party. For more information about ONVO’s partnerships/collabora... investors should read the SEC form 8-
Ks ONVO puts out every time they sign a new deal. 
3. The compensation of top three execs is in-line with industry standards. Look at any other market cap equivalent
company 
4. 10b5-1 trading plans are industry practice for execs. Otherwise they would never allowed to sell because of insider
lockups. 
5. The BOD of ONVO has required execs to hold shares between 3 - 5x their annual salary within 5 years. This is
spelled out in detail in SEC filings.  
6. The merit of a patent estate is not something that can be evaluated in six paragraphs by a stock speculator. The
merit of a patent estate can only be tested during litigation. This typically happens once a company starts selling
products. I have not been able to find any record of pending IP proceedings. 
7. ONVO has 11% Institutional ownership (including Fidelity and State Street) and 7% by mutual funds. This is quite
good for a newly-listed NYSE company. 
The best source of information for investors regarding the prospects any investment is the annual report. ONVO’s
annual report can be found on the company’s website under the investor relations section. I have also found their
investor FAQ informative.


11 Mar 2014, 04:27 PM


Jake Bergmann, Contributor
Author’s reply »  rschreckhise,


Thanks for your thoughtful and well-reasoned response. I think the difference between your view and mine
goes straight to the core issue with Organovo: they should be a private, venture capital backed start-up, not a
publicly traded stock.


1) ONVO's goals are going to require many years/decades of R&D, and without products, there are no
significant operations to manage, so it still seems a little early for the academic co-founders to bow out.


2) The information contained in most of ONVO's 8-k's is minimal. Of course financial details are not required
by Reg FD or SEC, but my argument is that the partnership announcements have a material affect on the
stock price, so I think ONVO should provide more information or at least regular progress updates.


3-5) Who are the public companies you'd compare against ONVO? Other companies with the same market
cap? How about companies with the same revenue, R&D budget or total cash invested? All of your metrics
would make sense for a mature, public company but not for a start-up turned public company well before
revenue ramps up.


6) Usually companies pursuing such audacious ventures as ONVO would have hundred or thousands of
patents making an investigation difficult if not impossible (note ICEL 700+). What strikes me as unusual is that
ONVO only has two patents. You can easily read through two patents and make what I think are reasonable
deductions. My argument here is that the patents "estate" (if you can call it that) seems to be lacking any real
substance.


7) Your statement that 11% institutional ownership "is quite good for a newly-listed NYSE company" is just
wrong. Reference any academic paper on the matter (Hanley and Wilhelm, 1995; Cornelli and Goldreich,

2001; Aggarwal, Prabhala and Puri, 2002; Ljungqvist and Wilhelm 2002; and Jenkinson and Jones, 2004)
and you'll find institutions are allocated 65% - 70% of IPO's. It doesn't matter if the institutional number is 8%
or 11%, they are both far below average.


12 Mar 2014, 11:03 AM


rschreckhise
Counterpoints: 
1. Outsized capital investment/timelines in biotech lead to outsized investment returns. This is biotech 101.
You should read "The billion dollar molecule" or "From Alchemy to IPO to get a better understanding of this
industry. 
2. I'm at a loss on this one. Providing regular updates on collaborations is not industry practice. 
3-5. Have a look at GNMK, RGLS, AMBI, or MSTX. Or purchase the BioWorld Today Executive
Compensation Report. 
6. See pages 7 - 9 for an extensive description of the company's patent estate. (More than the 2 you cite). 
7. ONVO was a Super Angel-backed private company prior to going public through a reverse merger. They
have raised money through secondary offerings and have targeted institutional investors. They did not go
public through an IPO, therefore references related to institutional ownership are not relevant.

'Technically ONVO chart looks extremely bullish. In fact it may be the most BULLISH chart in the entire sector.
We are on the start of a SECULAR BULL run on ONVO. You will never hit a ten bagger listening to short
sellers. Get in while it is still under 20 USD. To miss out on this stock would be foolish. Load up while you
can.'

IVEGOTTHENUTS
Actually the year is not over. And the chart looks even more bullish. Considering this author does not even
have an office as I called Regus the company that manages this authors claimed office space.


Smear campaigns like this obviously can hold this stock down temporary. I can not predict when some guy
decides to attack a company. But aftter my post we were trading at 8 dollars and did in fact climb to 11.25 plus
the chart will show you the bounce I predicted.


This guy does not even have an office I called the company. And you will take this guys advice. OK shows me
how much you know. Do you Want bet that ONVO hits 20 USD by next January. I bet it hits 20 before it hits 5
USD. I highly doubt you do.


Who do I trust leading scientists in medicine or some guy who does not even have an office. OK

ONVO and InSphero and Cellular Dynamics are rather different from one another.


InSphero's process means that while it can have tissues for toxicity testing, they are less precisely engineered. In
addition, for consistency and scalability, automation is the future and always has been, and you don't do that with
spheroids. What happens when you have a less versatile platform is you get somewhere very fast and then realize
you can't go beyond a certain level once you get there. That's where InSphero and Organovo are different, and why
Organovo is better.

The idea behind liver toxicity is to have an in vitro liver that *best* demonstrates the functions of the human liver in
vivo. Just because there is a cheaper liver out there, doesn't mean it's better. Remember that the further you stray
from the ideal, the worse your model is going to be and the fewer applications you have. The beauty of bioprinting is
that you have the right tissue density and it is truly 3D. Not only that but, unlike spheroids, once it is printed it is
immediately ready for implementation not only for testing but for direct clinical application. If people didn't think
bioprinting was better, there wouldn't have been anything sent to the KOL and ONVO and the FDA would not have
any meetings.


As for Cellular Dynamics. Their primary focus and specialty is in cell differentiation. That's not Organovo's mode of
operation nor is it its strength. Apples and oranges.


Do you really think that the investors and institutions who understand this company will sell based on an article before
seeing whether ONVO's promise holds up?  
What I don't understand is why any investor would sell shares before the KOL results come in. Silly thing to do,
especially since results are expected soon :p

If ONVO's 3D assays are so much better then why did Pfizer decamp to ONVO's competitor Insphero?
Insphero is CURRENTLY selling 3D liver assays - well ahead of ONVO's hoped for Dec launch - and they are
partnered with Pfizer. Why does this matter? Because a couple of years ago Pfizer paid ONVO $1M for a
first-look at their liver assays and this created huge expectations that a major pharma was endorsing ONVO.
However after getting and reviewing the liver assays over a year ago they were never heard from again but
are now listed as partners with Insphero.


They endorsed ONVO's competitor.


12 Mar 2014, 10:27 AM


omeshrin
LOL! smh


Organovo doesn't have competitors until it has a product to sell. And no pharma will buy product from you
until you've reached certain milestones. 
KOL results are coming. Product is launching this year. The rest is conjecture.


As I stated before, "what happens when you have a less versatile platform is you get somewhere very fast
and then realize you can't go beyond a certain level once you get there. That's where InSphero and Organovo
are different, and why Organovo ['s platform] is better."


12 Mar 2014, 06:04 PM


Mukticat
The marketplace speaks with far greater authority than any poster here does and that market has chosen to
go with Insphero's 3D liver assays. End of story. Pfizer which looked at both ended up in Insphero's camp.

Even in ONVO succeeds in producing a marketable product at a low enough cost, and succeeds in
developing a sales staff, this entire market is only a few million dollars a year.


Read what Rick Pearson, Douglas House and Jason Napodano have all said about that market size.


In the end valuation is what matters and ONVO makes a whole lot more sense as a $100M company than a
$800M company.

Yes he did and none of those comments were favorable. Andrew Left of Citron fame has earned enough
credibility from well-researched bearish calls that his reports now often provoke major down moves in stocks.
Consider Tuesday's intra-day 50% selloff of PLUG on a bearish statement by Citron. Or VJET recently.


So yes, you're correct, Citron thinks ONVO's crap too.

The problem about "valuation" that I have is that market makers talk about valuation when it is convenient for
them, but they don't act according to their own standards. They are there to make money. Valuation is just a
vehicle to them.  
And, in the end, retail investors will be hearing echoes of "valuation, valuation" and will wait, hoping the price
will drop, but it doesn't. Or they will sell and guess what will happen -- a market maker will gobble up those
shares and drive the price back up again.  
People see a company succeeding and they hold on. PPS rarely makes the sense that you want it to. Sorry
but it's just the way it is.


As for ONVO vs InSphero. Again, ONVO doesn't have a product out yet. No one "chose" anything. They took
what's currently available. Before making assumptions about a product that doesn't exist yet, why not wait
until it comes out and see how they do :)


Peace.

Has everyone forgotten that ONVO is also working on tissue types other than liver tissue? They have initial data on
cancerous breast tissue. Regardless of the possibility of printed organ transplants in the future - the availability of live

regenerative technology in creating human organs. They are about 5 years ahead of ONVO as far as technology, and
have successfully transplanted 8 human trachea's and patients are cured and still living. I would love to hear what you

I can not think of a worse company to short than a development stage bio company focusing on revolutionary
groundbreaking medical technology. Pharma companies spend billions on R&D and it makes sense that they would
want a superior technology to the two dimensional assays that they currently use. ONVO has already mentioned that
they were ahead of schedule with the liver assays. 
Liver is just a drop in the bucket compared to the vast possibilities that ONVO can explore. They are in the business
of making functional human tissue. Today its liver, tomorrow its skin. They have been reportedly been working on
brain tissue, lungs, heart, etc. The prospective tissue market is huge.  
Nobody is claiming they print functional Organs yet. That is the long term goal however. Keep in mind 20 years ago
the concept of the smartphone or the internet, hell 100 years ago the concept of the calculator was just a "pipe
dream" as you so eloquently bash. a functional transplantable human organ may be closer than you think. 
Perhaps the #1 reason to not be short ONVO is because anyday good news could come out and rocket these shares
much much higher.  
ONVO is no stranger to smear articles. Every time it has bounced back and this SA article is no different. The market
will ultimately make the fool out of someone. I for one plan to be on the side of technological advancement not some
short seller with a bias, a motive to bash and SA account. 
Have fun waking up some day to a 50% pop on good news shorts.

I believe that if you are short a stock that goes under $5 per share, there would be a margin call. I dunno, things may
have changed, but, one thing I have done with my shares is have my broker place them in a type 1 (cash) and type 2
(margin) account with instructions to NOT allow my shares to be loaned out (I think in a type 7 margin account). 
Usually within your account paperwork, there are stipulations that brokers can "loan" your shares to other firms
through their own "stock loan" departments so, you are the "box" so to speak, and shares are shorted against the box.

While you do have some valid points, on others you are far off base and/or your suspected reasoning is badly flawed.
When you are purely looking for the negatives., you will only see the negatives.


As someone that who knows the company inside and out, I agree that this is a speculative stock and is expensive in
some aspects, however in other aspects it is fairly inexpensive. But shorting it is most likely a very very bad idea.


All in all your article, where it does provide some facts about the company, you may want to investigate further into the
company and see if your thesis is bulletproof. Cause based on what you have put here, I can see that it is not.

Citron is being investigated because of its publication of falsehoods of PLUG in order to short. It is just a
matter of time.


The main problem with all of this nonsense, is that these articles are picked up as "News" articles. When, in
truth, they are forums for anyone who prints a disclaimer, without having to substantiate their so called facts.
These are opinions, at the very best, and should have a headline designating that. The unseasoned investor,

I'm just going to throw this out there for the short ONVO crew.


1. Do you believe 3-D bio-printing is real and a strong possibility in the future? +5yrs I'm factoring, not
tomorrow. 
2. If so what are the barriers to entry? Start-up costs, research, talent-acquisition, etc etc. How many tens of
millions would it cost just to find out if a particular process works or not? And how long would you burn before
having a commercially viable product? 
3. Viewed in that aspect, do you not believe there is a bottom floor for ONVO, value of patents, process, and
relationships? I'm not referring to $0.


By answering those questions you can see that it is hard to put a price on ONVO. Should the stock be in the
teens... eh probably not, can it go lower... yea possibly. Should it be lower... that's arguable. But if you believe
in the process, taking the traditional multi-year outlook on investing, would ONVO generate profit in your
portfolio... most-likely. You may have some up and down moments and possible dilutions over the next couple
years, but let's face the truth. The technology works, it will take time for it to improve to even remotely
consider one day being an FDA approved process, but the barriers to entry are simply too high for a
saturation of players and once the technology and process hits are certain point going acquisition becomes a
mitigating factor. As there are only going to be a small handful of players to choose from.


Just my 2 cents.

Not short ONVO, but I might be on any significant upward move.


1. 3-D bio-printing is already here, the industry is highly fragmented and the target market is small--even by
ONVO's own projections.


2. In my view, start-up costs are lower than many might imagine. I personally know two bio-engineering PHD
students at top programs who have been researching the viability of bio-printing (as a business)--which
unsurprisingly is quite poor at this point in time.


3. ONVO has what, 3 patents? That's nothing in a field as nascent as bio-printing. There are better connected
bio-printing companies too.


It's not hard to put a price on ONVO, should be worth 1-2$ a share. A company is only worth the present
value of it's discounted future cash flows, not 'hopes and dreams' of retail investors.


Lastly, the barriers to entry in this industry are low. There are only a handful of companies in this space
because of it's lack of financial viability.


I began researching this company with the thought of 'a potentially great long idea' but the more and more I
learned, the more I realized how expensive the current valuation is.

paper i did not have a position in $ONVO nor did i ever have a a position. Since that time i initiated a very
small short position.

Just checking back in. How's that ONVO short working out for you over the last 3 weeks, say vs. 3D Systems? 
Now where was that person who told me I would make more shorting ONVO than 3D, on a percentage basis? Hey
good call. :-) 
Consider the 3D short closed, and still long ONVO. 
How much did you make in the last 3 weeks? 
Lessee, 74 to 60. 14 points. Hey, that's almost 20 percent in 3 weeks. Uh, that annualizes out to about 330%. 
Still long ONVO 
Thank you

TFCAB nice to know what you think of ONVO but not much to go on with a discussion here. I notice that you
like to make comments on a whole lot of stocks and also SA deleted your link in above.


22 Mar 2014, 11:06 AM

Ecapo check my link on my comment maybe works. 
My link was just sending you to the Simon research pdf 
It should work if it is not go to Google finance you will get it. 
Btw it is scary. Someone with no position in Onvo will just run away from onvo. 
Let's see what is going happen on Monday

Seeking Alpha has removed its blurb concerning Simeon's unsubstantiated article about ONVO along with all of the
comments. in my opinion, this tells me the potential of SA being somehow involved.


The following was the last post under that erroneous "news" about ONVO


I have already been deleted, twice, commenting on the Bergmann article. I filed a complaint with the SEC, giving them
facts. I just updated my complaint with a copy of the Simeon post.


The mills of the gods grind extremely slow, but extremely fine!!!

This will probably be deleted as well, but one has to ask why it was allowed to be posted in the first place.

I have tryed to post a comment on the latest news published 
on SA  
And the Organovo debate continues Mar 20 2014, 10:46 ET but it was impossible so the research from
Simon it is just useless.


Here below my comment I was trying to post


 
Apparently no one knows about this Simon Research. 
Check this link to read the report from Simon. 
http://bit.ly/1ilHhHW


And btw the link on SA http://bit.ly/1ilHfzS has been removed from Onvo request


I did not find any things about Simon research. Someone is trying to short Onvo.

While you're all tying yourselves up in knots over the latest article to point out the numerous holes in the ONVO story
the stock itself looks to be rolling over. We're very close to 8 which any cursory look at a chart will tell you is a strong
support level going back to early Nov. If we pierce that this could go south in a real hurry.


Ya might want to consider bailing out quick if that were to occur because there's zero fundamentals (no revs, no
earnings, no obvious path to profitability) supporting this but a herd of momos who have kept it aloft. You don't want to
be left behind when THEY depart.

Mukticat.....thank you for pointing that out.  
Anyone who follows my work knows i study charts and watch option order flow. i very seldom delve into
fundamentals or valuation as a criteria for taking a position. I post many things about stocks i consider news
worthy or relevant to the conversation. I tend to avoid posting or taking positions in battleground stocks like
$HLF etc because in general, i do not appreciate all the comments that come flying out of the word work, or
worse, getting on the wrong side of big institutional investors that can push a stock around. I took a small
bearish position in this stock because as you say, if it loses its technical support, downward momentum could
accelerate. I really have very little knowledge about $ONVO or the controversy that surrounds it.

I find myself so quotable! lol


The market gave the momos such a pass for such a long time that I was beginning to think we'd moved
permanently into Bizarro World. Naturally with so much confirmation from other momos they began to think
they were trading geniuses. Alas, it appears the party's over. Now it's just a question of who the smarter ones
are who get out before they ride this all the way back to fair value (1.00 - 2.00).


27 Mar 2014, 02:58 PM

Yes this is the time when shorts get scared and need to try and drive down ONVO or start to loose. Time will
tell but there can only be so much scare that the sky is falling to wake up and see it is bright blue again. Then
the party is over with the shorts and it is a question of how to cover their position. It looks like the support has
supported. Too bad for the shorts.


28 Mar 2014, 10:15 AM


Mukticat
'this is the time when shorts get scared'


That's hilarious ECapo. Yes what get's shorts scared is the stock plummeting and making so much money, lol.
Of course we get scared too when the stock goes up and we're losing money. I guess we're just always
scared no matter what, right?


28 Mar 2014, 12:38 PM


ECapo
Mukticat, I can tell you are getting nervous as all shorts on ONVO are now! You are the one who is amusing!
Shorts tried to drive down ONVO a week ago with this bogus article:


And the Organovo debate continues 
Mar 20 2014, 10:46 ET 
Simeon Research publishes its report on Organovo (ONVO) asserting a fair value of $1.35 an 85% haircut
from its current $8.90.


Interesting that you are taking this haircut position now above!


Mukticat remember my post and your response you made on an this false article by an unknown Simeon
Research that was posted on a bogus web site and was taken down immediately from the web and SA. I will
remind you here:

What is going on with SA. Try and Goggle Simeon Research and you get nothing or am I wrong. Also
throughout the article there are grammar and spelling mishaps. Is this an attempt to drive this stock down by
someone who can not cover a short or what. Will someone please clarify! Why does SA even release such a
news release with out checking?

You guys are amusing . . . AS IF you actually read and digested then entire detailed 61 page report
immediately and are now ready to pronounce it all some awful manipulative attempt - with the connivance of
SA - to once again disparage ONVO.


I am in hopes that others may comment in here besides you.


28 Mar 2014, 02:12 PM

You can tell I'm nervous? Frankly this is prima facia an idiotic concept. Do you get scared when you're making
a ton of money?

Mukticat 
Well that was one of your greatest comments for all to see now. 
Thanks for updating all new ONVO stock holders that you are short ONVO and other 3D stocks you comment
on. 
Even as I comment here the VP Eli Hoffmann has posted an article on SA stating SA is now addressing the
problems of people who write false or misleading articles on this site and others: 
http://seekingalpha.co... 
As an Investor I am picking up more and more shares at these levels.


29 Mar 2014, 11:32 AM

Now everyone including all those new to SA can see that you will do all you can to drive the stock down. Now
who has the last laugh! LOL


30 Mar 2014, 06:56 PM


Mukticat
The last laugh belongs to he who was right about ONVO being little more than a money extraction operation
that lines the pockets of the top execs via MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A MONTH in stock sales.

Some may take your comments as the sky is falling and some may not. We know you are short on ONVO and all 3D
stocks except a few in Europe by your past comments and articles. ONVO seemed to not fall and rallied above
support.

Jake Bergmann, Thanks for your well researched article! All your points and conclusions make sense to me.


Don't worry about all the attacks you received here... press on!

All the best!

JH2012, You have my apology for my assumption. That only leaves one other person. JH no need to ****. To
your other question to me, I will try and answer it! 
I do have a few problems with some authors of articles and comments on articles. The problems I have are
those made by people who are short that are attempting to drive down any stock with their comments. These
comments mostly are not specific, they cherry pic, they are false, they are incomplete, they are misleading
and they are not related to the company or their specific product. There has also been stock manipulation on
Seeking Alpha.


As you are aware SA has an investigation going on at present:

I'm entitled to express my appreciation to an author without getting harassed.


You say his article is false - I don't agree. It rings true to me.


As far as stock manipulation goes - yes, the markets are absolutely riddled with corruption. I saw ONVO go from
$1.25 to $10 and back down again within a few weeks. So, what was all that? (please, it's only a rhetorical question :)


I'm really looking forward to Jake's next article on ONVO and ICEL.


Take care!

ONVO down 10% today to $5.55 - LOL!
