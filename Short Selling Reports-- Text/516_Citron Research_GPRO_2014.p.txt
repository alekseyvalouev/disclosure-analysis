GoPro Price Target $30 Within 12 Months.   
Citron Debunks the Hardware plus Media Story 


with Spot-on Comps 
 


Over the past month Citron has read over 100 articles and analyst comments 
about GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), both positive and negative. To date, not a single 
commentator or analyst has laid out the truth regarding this company's 
promotional "we're a media company" story.   


GoPro is a tech hardware company.  Yet it has spun a story, which is a very 
convenient fiction, for Wall Street to parrot:  that it can become a "media 
company".  Why?  Because users are uploading some of their videos to YouTube?  
Citron will now decisively document the gap between the most optimistic 
conceivable valuation that this company can ever command, and the current 
stock price. 


At yesterday's close of $84.32 per share, the company sports approximately a $10 
billion market cap.   Let's evaluate this in light of reasonable comps on both their 
hardware and their dream of a media business, and see how it stacks up.  


Clearly, GoPro manufactures and markets a leading electronic video camera 
which is all the rage.  They turned in a big quarter and nobody begrudges them 
the success of achieving a big score in the consumer electronics marketplace. But 
long term success in the consumer electronic industry is highly elusive to 
maintain, as evidenced by this chart (by a Seeking Alpha writer). The reality is 
that, analyzed historically, nearly all tech hardware device companies have a 
brutally difficult time maintaining consistently high margins.  The following graph 
illustrates the point decisively:

For this reason, hardware and gadget gear companies do not become Wall Street  
Darlings... for long.  


Don’t Listen to Citron -- Listen to Apple. 


The clearest comparison to GoPro is Beats Headphones. 


 Beats had all these things going for it : 


 Huge Brand Recognition 


 High Margin  


 A Compelling "Cool Factor"  


 A Media Element to its Valuation Story 


 Strong and Relevant  Management (Jimmy Iovine)

And on a takeout, Apple bought Beats for 2x revenue (and that is an acquisition 
price by a strategic partner). 


Here's how Morgan Stanley assessed the acquisition:  





At the time of the acquisition, much of the media opined that 2x sales was high 
for a product in a commoditized industry.  Citron further observes that Beats has 
a larger total addressable market and a stronger consumer brand whose products 
are as much fashion statements as electronic devices.  Compare the 
counterfeiting of Beats in China vs the “knocking off” of the GoPro in China.

The Bottom Line on GoPro's Hardware Business 


For the sake of argument, affording GoPro the benefit of all doubts, Citron 
projects GoPro's revenues all the way out to 2017.  For this we take the highest 
analyst's benchmark in the entire analyst universe, and disregarding any and all 
execution risks, including competition, pricing pressure, market saturation, 
cannibalization by lower-price points, and inventory risks.  With a stroke of the 
pen, lets confer upon them $2.1 billion in gross revenue.  At a 2x revenue 
multiple, this gets us a stock price of --$33.60 per share.   


The reason Citron uses price-to-sales is that it is only fair to any rational investor.  
We refuse to write a story where a commoditized camera maker, projecting 
growth in its core business below 5% per year in 2016 (2 billion to 2.1 billion), is 
conferred a 60X earnings multiple for 2016, while their management discloses 
their own concerns about the limitations of their growth curve in their 
prospectus.    


UBS (May 28, 2014): “Beats had $1.1bn of revenue in 2013 and we 


estimate close to $1.5bn this year. A price of 2x sales seems reasonable to 


us given apparently high margins.” 





 Morgan Stanley (May 29, 2014): “At a $1.4B 2014 revenue run-rate (up 


from $1.1B in 2013), the $3B acquisition represents 2.1x EV/Sales, lower 


than Apple’s current valuation of 2.3x.”

So where is the other $50 a share?  


Everyone knows the content companies are getting eye-popping multiples.  The 
company does everything possible to shift investors' attention from the hardware 
business to its media story.   


We have never seen analysts on consumer electronics gear company resort to 
social media "eyeballs" metrics to justify valuations such as “Facebook likes” and 
“Instagram followers” ... but there is a first for everything, especially if you ignore 
history.  In Wall Street's compulsion to fabricate a story where a story does not 
exist, you see its fingerprints on GoPro media.   





Here are some of the comments from analysts after the recent GPRO 
quarter   


Raymond James Tavis McCourt: 
“GoPro’s YouTube channel monthly views were 72 million….The 
company now has over 8 million Facebook followers and 3 
million followers on Instagram.” 





From Wedbush Securities: 


“We believe GoPro’s high valuation multiple reflects the belief 
among many investors that the company can successfully exploit 
its vast media opportunity”

GoPro has fueled this myth, stating in their prospectus:

We distribute GoPro programming through what we refer to as the 
GoPro Network, a collection of GoPro Channels hosted on a variety of 
platforms, including the following: 
  


 Facebook: over 7.2 million “likes;” 


 Instagram: over 2.0 million followers;  


 Twitter: over 950,000 followers; ...

72 million monthly views and 2.2 million subscribers sounds 
impressive ... until you put it all in perspective.   


Consider the comps.  Over the past 6 months, two YouTube content 
generation companies have been sold: 


 Maker Studios:  In March of 2014 Disney bought Maker Studios for $500 
million (incrementally more if certain milestones are reached) 
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/24/us-disney-maker-idUSBREA2N1PV20140324 


Maker Studios claims to have more than 5.5 billion monthly video 
views and 380 million subscribers across its channels 


 Fullscreen:  Two months ago, ATT bought controlling interest in 
YouTube content creator Fullscreen in a deal that Values Fullscreen 
between $200-$300 million. 


Fullscreen has 450 million subscribers and generates over 5 billion 
views a month.

story.html 
 


By comparison to Maker and Fullscreen, GoPro's content, which is not 
specifically monetizable, and which they have no ownership rights to, has 
little to no value and is far from being a blue sky opportunity adding 
materially to its $10 billion valuation. (unless you want a point of view video 
of my 13 year old riding his skateboard ... that he doesn’t even watch 
himself.)

So you decide: Is GoPro investible as a Social Media Company ? 


If GoPro is social media company in any way shape or form, then 
according to all metrics, investors can't tell the difference between 
Justin Bieber and Mark Zuckerberg. 
  


   Conclusion 


It is not a secret to anyone that GoPro's stock move has been fueled by Wall 
Street's typical small-float, large outstanding, IPO game; thus it has attracted a 
high short interest.  But soon enough, a secondary will inevitably put more stock 
into the market, and investors will be left to decide the value of GoPro's real 
tomorrow.   


When the dust settles this stock will trade down to $30 and will be fortunate to 
maintain even that price.  GoPro will be forced to innovate to compete in a 
brutally competitive camera market, where household names like Polaroid and 
Kodak ended up in bankruptcy, iconic names like Nikon and Canon went from 
mainstream to niche, and FlipCam simply disappeared into thin air.  


The truth is that stock valuations are based on a path to sustainable business 
tomorrow.  This company has hit a notable success "today", but explicitly 
discloses that its tomorrow is foreshadowed by declining growth.
