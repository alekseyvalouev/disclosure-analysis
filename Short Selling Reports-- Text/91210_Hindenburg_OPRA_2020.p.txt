Summary (NASDAQ: OPRA)


Opera went public in mid-2018 based largely on prospects for its core browser business. Now, its
browser market share is declining rapidly, down ~30% since its IPO.
Browser gross margins have collapsed by 22.6% in just one year. Opera has swung to negative $12
million in LTM operating cash �ow, compared to positive cash �ow of $32 million for the
comparable 2018 period.
Opera was purchased by a China-based investor group prior to its IPO. The group’s largest investor
and current Opera Chairman/CEO was recently involved in a Chinese lending business that listed in
the U.S. and saw its shares plunge more than 80% in just 2 years amid allegations of fraud and
illegal lending practices.
Post IPO, Opera has now also made a similar and dramatic pivot into predatory short-term loans in
Africa and India, deploying deceptive ‘bait and switch’ tactics to lure in borrowers and charging
egregious interest rates ranging from ~365-876%.
Most of Opera’s lending business is operated through apps o�ered on Google’s Play Store. In
August, Google tightened rules to curtail predatory lending and, as a result, Opera’s apps are now in
black and white violation of numerous Google rules.
Given that the vast majority of Opera’s loans are disbursed through Android apps, we think this
entire line of business is at risk of disappearing or being severely curtailed when Google notices.
Instead of disclosing to investors that its “high-growth” micro�nance segment could be imperiled by
these new rules, Opera instead immediately raised $82 million in a secondary o�ering without
disclosing Google’s changes to investors.
Opera’s short-term loan business now accounts for over 42% of the company’s revenue and is
responsible for eye-popping top line “growth”. Meanwhile, the segment experienced massive defaults
(~50% of lending revenue) and company-wide cash �ow has worsened.


Opera: Phantom of the Turnaround – 70%
Downside


Published on January 16, 2020
Post IPO, Opera promptly directed ~$40 million of cash into businesses owned by its Chairman,
including $30 million into a karaoke app, and $9.5 million into an entity used to acquire a business
that Opera had already operated and funded, via a questionable transaction.
We think Opera collapses on its own worsening �nancials, with that timeline accelerating
signi�cantly if Google bans its lending apps or if its Chairman/CEO continues to draw cash out of the
business through questionable related-party deals.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of Opera. All APR


extrapolations/calculations were based on a 365 day year. This report represents our opinion, and we


encourage every reader to do their own due diligence. Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the


report.


Introduction


When a new management team takes over a declining business, it can become a race against the clock to


cash out. This is what we think is going on at Opera, a company based around a once-popular web


browser that is now seeing its userbase erode.


In the year and a half since its IPO, Opera’s browser has been squeezed by Chrome and Safari, with


market share down (https://gs.statcounter.com/) about 30% globally. Operating metrics have tightened,


and the company’s previously healthy positive operating cash �ow has swung to negative $12 million in


the last twelve months (LTM) and negative $24.5 million year to date.


With its browser business in decline, cash �ow deteriorating (and balance sheet cash �nding its way into


management’s hands…more on this later), Opera has decided to embark on a dramatic business pivot:


predatory short-term lending in Africa and Asia.


The pivot is not new for Opera’s Chairman/CEO, who was recently involved with another public lending


company that saw its stock decline more than 80% in the two years since its IPO amidst allegations of


illegal and predatory lending practices (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1p9h1GAYwsDOyf).


Opera has scaled its “Fintech” segment from non-existent to 42% of its revenue in just over a year,


providing a fresh narrative and “growth” numbers to distract from declining legacy metrics. But with


defaults comprising ~50% of lending revenue (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-


details/opera-limited-announces-third-quarter-2019-�nancial-results), this new endeavor strikes us more


as short-term window dressing than a long-term �x.


Furthermore, Opera’s short-term loan business appears to be in open, �agrant violation of the Google


Play Store’s policies on short-term and misleading lending apps. Given that the vast majority of Opera’s


loans are disbursed through Android apps, we think this entire line of business is at risk of disappearing


or being severely curtailed when Google notices and ultimately takes corrective action.

https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-third-quarter-2019-financial-results
Meanwhile, Opera has exhibited a troubling pattern of raising large amounts of cash (almost $200 million


over the past 1.5 years), and then directing portions of it to entities owned or in�uenced by its


Chairman/CEO through a slew of questionable related-party transactions. For example:


1. $9.5 million of cash went toward an entity that appears to have been owned 100% by Opera’s
Chairman/CEO, despite company disclosures suggesting otherwise. Ostensibly, the reason for the
payment was to ‘purchase’ a business that was already funded and operated by Opera. To us, this
transaction simply looks like a cash withdrawal.


2. $30 million of cash went into a karaoke app business owned by Opera’s Chairman/CEO, days before
the arrest of a key business partner.


3. $31+ million of cash was doled out for “marketing expenses and prepayments” to an antivirus
software company controlled by an Opera director and in�uenced by Opera’s Chairman/CEO. The
antivirus company has no other known marketing clients, but is paid to help Opera with Google and
Facebook ads and other marketing services. (Note: Most �rms use a marketing agency for help with
marketing needs.)


We have a 12-month price target of $2.60 on Opera, representing ~70% downside.


We take the midpoint of the company’s $43 million annual adjusted EBITDA expectations


(https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-third-quarter-


2019-�nancial-results) and assign multiples to its business units weighted by contribution. We apply a 7x


EBITDA multiple to its browser & news segment (despite the steep pro�t decline) and a 2x EBITDA


multiple to its lending apps, in-line with Chinese peers. We do not assign a multiple to its licensing


segment, which the company has stated it expects to “signi�cant decline”. The company has about $134


million in cash (no debt) which we add.


We then apply a 15% discount to account for risks relating to its �ntech division, which we believe will be


signi�cantly curtailed over the next 12 months (for reasons we explain) and risks relating to management


and cash dissipating via questionable related party transactions.


Background


Pre-IPO: A Rosy Looking Story


Opera is a browser and mobile app business that has existed since the early days of the internet.


The browser business emerged in 1995 (https://www.businessinsider.com/opera-ipo-cfo-interview-frode-


jacobsen-2018-7) and maintained a niche share of the market over the years. In November 2016, Opera’s


browser and apps division was acquired by a China-based consortium


(https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/opera-renegotiates-its-1-2b-sale-down-to-600m-for-browser-


privacy-apps-chinese-jv/) including Kunlun Tech and Qihoo 360. Kunlun Tech


(https://venturebeat.com/2016/03/11/chinese-game-developer-kunlun-invests-3-million-in-silicon-valley-


ai-company/) is a publicly traded Chinese company focused on online game development and is led by

(https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/08/opinion/qihoo-360-lawsuit-spotlights-shareholder-risks/)), browser


company in China led by Opera Director Hongyi Zhou.


When taking Opera public in July 2018, the browser and apps business was growing gross pro�t at 30-


40%. The business had 40% EBITDA margins and it was generating positive cash �ow [pg. S-8


(https://investor.opera.com/node/6841/html)].


Post-IPO: A Quick Collapse in Opera’s Browser Market Share


Within months of transitioning to new management, Opera’s growth and pro�tability in the browser and


mobile ad business began to decline rapidly. The decline has continued post-IPO. Opera’s global browser


market share has dropped from 5%+ pre-acquisition to just over 2% most recently.


 (Source: GS StatCounter (https://gs.statcounter.com/))


In Opera’s strongest market, Africa, the declines were even more pronounced. Opera’s browser market


share in Africa hit highs of ~40% prior to its acquisition by new management and has plunged below 12%


as of the most recent period. Opera’s browser share has quickly been squeezed out by Google on one


side, and Safari on the other, as Android and Apple have both developed stronger footholds on the


continent.

Post-IPO: A Quick Collapse in Opera’s Financial Metrics, Negative
Cash Flow and Declining Browser Margins


This deterioration has contributed to “Browser and News” segment gross pro�t declines of 22.6%, from


$76 million to $59 million in the most recent y/y period [Q3 2019 report


(https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html)].


On the cash �ow side, the company generated (https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html) negative


$24.5 million in operating cash �ow in the nine months ended September 30, compared to positive cash


�ow of $21.7 million for the comparable 2018 period.



https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/africa/#monthly-201509-201911

https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html

https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html
But Alas, A New Business Has Emerged That Has Sent Reported
Revenue Soaring: Predatory Short-Term Lending in Africa and
Asia


Coinciding with these challenges, Opera launched a mobile app based short-term lending business, now


labeled under its “Fintech” segment, that scaled from no revenue in 2018 to 42.5% of Opera’s revenue in


Q3 2019 (https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html).


As we will show, Opera’s apps have entered the African and Asian markets o�ering short-term loans with


sky-high interest rates ranging from ~365%-876% per annum.


As one former employee of an Opera lending app described to us, in many cases “these (loans) are for


people (who) could not even a�ord their basic needs.” Another employee described a desperate


Kenyan borrowing market, stating:


“Most Kenyans, they are low income earners. And apparently most of them they don’t have


enough even for their families.”


The Predatory Lending Business Has 50% Credit Losses and
Limited Pro�tability, But It Makes Top-Line Growth Appear
Great


In all loan businesses, giving away money is easy and growth can be as fast as a company wants – until, of


course, the loans need to be paid back. In its latest quarter


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919022755/ex_164922.htm), Opera


reported that its credit losses reached $20 million, an astounding ~50% of its $39.9 million Fintech


segment revenue for the quarter.



https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919022755/ex_164922.htm
While mobile app loans can be a lot less pro�table (bottom line) than the traditional search & advertising


businesses due to high incidences of non-performing loans, Opera had nonetheless given itself the ability


to report high revenue growth (top line) and project a more optimistic future.


The short-term lending business was initially launched in Kenya and showed immediate growth from $6.5


million in Q1 2019 [Q1 Results (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-


limited-announces-�rst-quarter-2019-�nancial-results)] to $11.6 million in Q2 2019 [Q2 Results


(https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-second-


quarter-2019-�nancial-results)] to $39.9 million in Q3 2019 [Q3 Results (https://investor.opera.com/news-


releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-third-quarter-2019-�nancial-results)].


The apps have improved reported net income as well, but largely through non-cash valuation increases.


Year to date (YTD) net income was $35.9 million, with $26.2 million (73%) stemming largely from level 3


asset markups among its Fintech apps (https://investor.opera.com/node/6961/html).


We think Opera’s lending business will fail purely on economics: default rates, competition across dozens


of similar apps and user turnover will continue to take its toll on cash �ow and pro�tability despite any


top line revenue growth.


And we think Opera’s Chairman/CEO Yahui Zhou knows this drill well, having recently lived it.


Zhou has a close association with another lending business, Qudian (NYSE:QD), which has


plummeted more than 80% since its IPO ~2 years ago due to the same types of concerns we are


raising about Opera. We dig into the striking parallels between these two companies later in our


report.


Beyond basic economic unsustainability, we have found several additional issues that we think could lead


to a near term evisceration of the company’s newfound predatory lending business.


Part I: Opera’s Pivot to Sketchy Short-Term Lender
Is Already Imperiled


Opera is Flagrantly Disregarding Google’s New Policies on
Predatory Short-Term Lending


Opera has 4 apps that collectively o�er lending products in Kenya, India, and Nigeria, mostly through


Google’s Android operating system. Google/Android has over 84% market share in Kenya


(https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/kenya), over 94% market share in India


(https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/india), and over 79% market share in Nigeria


(https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/nigeria), making it the overwhelmingly dominant


platform that individuals in these markets use for personal loan apps. Opera’s access to the Google Play


store is therefore critical to the success of its lending apps.

We have found clear evidence that all 4 of Opera’s lending apps are in black and white violation of


Google’s rules on short-term lending and deceptive/misleading content. We will demonstrate this


evidence in this report. We have also reached out to Google for comment on our �ndings.


We believe this is a signi�cant risk to Opera investors. Without the support of Google, we have a hard


time imagining this predatory lending business survives. We also have a hard time imagining Google


takes no action when they realize the extent of the violations and the havoc these apps have created in


the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable users in Africa and India. The social consequences of


these mass-default products appear to be mounting, as we will detail.


Google’s �ules: Apps That O�er Short-Term Personal Loans of 60
Days or Less Are Not Allowed


Opera: All of Our Apps O�er Loans Ranging From 7 Days to 30
Days Despite the Ban (And Despite Pretending to Be in
Compliance)


Historically, Google had relatively vague policies against harmful �nancial products, stating


(https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy-print/):


“We don’t allow apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful �nancial products and services.”


In August 2019, Google updated its policies in response to a proliferation of predatory lending taking


place on its app ecosystem. The updated policies were much more speci�c, prohibiting “short-term


personal loans” (de�ned as loans less than 60 days). [Source 1


(https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/21/google-publishes-play-store-policies-for-personal-loan-


apps/), Source 2 (https://debanked.com/2019/10/google-bans-loan-apps-from-app-store-if-personal-loan-


o�ers-exceed-36-apr/), Source 3 (https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/2464998?hl=en)]


The updated policy reads (https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy-print/):


“We do not allow apps that promote personal loans which require repayment in full in 60


days or less from the date the loan is issued (we refer to these as “short-term personal


loans”). This policy applies to apps which o�er loans directly, lead generators, and those who


connect consumers with third-party lenders.”


Opera’s mobile loan business operates through four Android apps: (1) OKash and (2) OPesa in Kenya, (3)


CashBean in India, and (4) OPay in Nigeria.

https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/2464998?hl=en

https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy-print/
We had consultants test Opera’s lending apps in December 2019 and January 2020 and found that all


four of its apps were in black and white violation of Google’s rule, as we will show. In fact, none of


the loan products o�ered across Opera’s apps appear to be in compliance with this policy, despite


these rules going into e�ect over 4 months ago.


About 2 months after Google instituted its personal loan policy change, Opera’s Chief Financial


O�cer, Frode Jacobsen, was asked about the company’s loan pro�le. Jacobsen stated


(https://investor.opera.com/static-�les/495f4e33-be25-4561-ada9-6098ab7886ab) on the company’s


November 2019 conference call that its loan duration was still about 2 weeks:


“So our loans in India tends to be a bit bigger, in the $50; whereas in Kenya, it’s in the $30. So


while duration of loans, it’s about the same with an average of about 2 weeks, as you


mentioned.“


This is corroborated by Opera’s most recent prospectus, dated September 2019 (after the rule change).


Disclosures show that Opera’s entire microlending business provides loans between 7 to 30 days, which


all fall outside of Google’s policies [pg. F-11


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919018810/opra20190919_424b5.htm)]:


“The Group currently provides loans to consumers with a duration of between 7 to 30


days.”


The same prospectus fails to mention Google’s rule change.


All 4 Of Opera’s Apps Pretend to Be in Compliance with Google’s
Policies, But in Reality, They All O�er Prohibited Products


When we �rst discovered that Opera’s lending apps were in �agrant violation of Google’s rules, we


wondered how they had not been banned or been required to bring their terms into compliance. The


reason, we think, is because each app claims to be in compliance with the new policies in their respective


Google app descriptions, but then o�ers prohibited loans once users have downloaded and signed up for


the apps.


For example, here is the Google Play app description for OKash


(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplay.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US), which clearly


states that its loans range from 91 days to 365 days, which would place it in compliance with Google’s


policies. Even the example image shows a loan o�ered with a term of 360 days:



https://investor.opera.com/static-files/495f4e33-be25-4561-ada9-6098ab7886ab

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919018810/opra20190919_424b5.htm

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplay.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US
But these products don’t appear to exist at all. An email to the company’s OKash app division con�rms


that loans range from 15 days to 29 days in duration:
We further con�rmed this by having a local consultant apply for a loan through the OKash app. They


were given a 2-week loan:
All of Opera’s Apps Exhibit the Same Pattern: A Misleading
Description that Looks to be in Compliance, But Products Openly
Violate Google’s Terms


In addition to OKash, we reviewed the claimed loan length on the Google Play Store versus actual loan


length for Opera’s other lending apps. The pattern is clear. Here is the summary of our �ndings for all 4


apps, with more individual details following:


(Source: Google Play Store descriptions & Hindenburg Research due
diligence �ndings)


OPesa’s app description (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.opesa.microloan.kenya&hl=en) similarly presents its loan terms as being between 91 days to 365


days, despite no evidence that it ultimately provides any loans of those lengths.



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opesa.microloan.kenya&hl=en
There wasn’t even much sleuth work required for OPesa. After all, the app’s own FAQ page


(https://www.o-pesa.com/faq.html) shows that it o�ers a loan term of 14 days with an origination fee of


16.8%, which equates to an APR of ~438%.


To con�rm this, we had our consultant download the app in mid-December. They were o�ered a


repayment term of 15 days.


For CashBean (India), the app description (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_U


S) once again makes the same 91 day to 365 day loan term claim.



https://www.o-pesa.com/faq.html

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_US
Yet recent online reviews for the app consistently show the loan term to be 15 days:


We emailed the company to see if they o�er loans for any term other than 15 days and have not heard


back as of this writing.


OPay’s app description (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=team.opay.pay) also makes the


exact same 91 day to 365 day loan term claim.



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=team.opay.pay
We also inquired about the company’s loan terms via an email to customerservice@opay.com


(mailto:customerservice@opay.com). They replied that the loan’s rate and term would be “an origination


fee charged of 1.2% per day for a �xed term of 15 days”:



mailto:customerservice@opay.com
In a separate email chain, OPay ultimately provided us a loan application


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7kQ0Mi6EdQ1SF) that o�ered only loans with a 7-day tenure:


(Source: OPay Loan Application Form (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7kQ0Mi6EdQ1SF))


And so, despite Opera having 4 di�erent apps across 3 countries, it appears that each violates Google’s


Play Store rules and skirts compliance using the exact same technique. We have a hard time believing


that to be accidental.


Rather than Updating the Market on The Material Policy Change
That Could Eviscerate Its Lending Business, Opera Said Nothing
and Immediately Raised �82 Million in a Secondary O�ering


Google’s short-term lending policies were updated in August 2019 and would have had a materially


negative impact on Opera’s lending model, had the company chose to abide by them.


Amortizing high-interest rate loans over a longer period of time to “high-risk” borrowers would change


the borrower pro�le, impact default rates and create a headwind for the segment.


We believe most law-abiding companies would have promptly disclosed this rule change and reassured


the market on their plans for adapting to it.


Instead, Opera appears to have disregarded the new policies entirely, disclosed nothing about the


change to the market, even when it launched a secondary o�ering (https://investor.opera.com/news-


releases/news-release-details/opera-announces-proposed-follow-public-o�ering-american) in mid-


September that raised (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-


announces-exercise-underwriters-option-purchase-additional) net proceeds of about $82 million.

Must Include Accurate Loan Length, APRs and Representative
Examples

https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-announces-exercise-underwriters-option-purchase-additional
The above documentation clearly shows that Opera is violating the Google Play Store rules on short-term


loans. A further review shows the company to be in violation of additional rules.


For example, Google’s policies require that the metadata of apps be accurate


(https://play.google.com/about/storelisting-promotional/metadata/):


Furthermore, Google’s personal loan policies (https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy-


print/) require certain metadata to be included in app descriptions. This includes:


The minimum and maximum period for repayment (already shown above to be false in Opera’s
app descriptions);
Annual percentage rate of the loan, including fees; and


A representative sample of a loan and its total cost


Opera’s apps �agrantly violate each of these terms in its app descriptions.


Opera’s App Descriptions: Interest Rates Are 12%-33% Max Per
Year (APR)


Opera’s Actual APRs: 365%-438%.


Opera’s APRs if a Borrower is Late by One Day: 730%-876%



https://play.google.com/about/storelisting-promotional/metadata/

https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy-print/
Kenya, Nigeria, and India are home to some of the world’s most disadvantaged individuals. Borrowers


turning to short-term loans may lack access to traditional bank loans. These people are more likely to be


vulnerable and fall for misleading o�ers.


We think Opera is taking advantage of these people by claiming to o�er low rates and longer-term loans


then gouging borrowers with sky high rates and shorter terms.


We reviewed all of Opera’s lending apps and found that each claimed to o�er low rates in its app


descriptions. Based on our research, however, none of its apps charge the stated interest rates and all


ultimately charge obscenely high rates:

Bait and Switch


Additionally, we saw what appeared to be a 3-step pattern of ‘bait and switch’ on loan terms in each app:


1. The app description would lure in users with low rates and long loan length terms.
2. Once downloaded, the app would then suggest users apply for a loan, showing a slightly longer loan


length and terms that suggest a higher interest rate.
3. Once the user inputs their personal information and applies, the apps then either deny the


borrower or grant a short-term loan with sky-high rates.


A former employee of OKash described to us how unemployed individuals were often totally unaware of


the high interest rates they were paying, until it was too late:


“Most people are not educated. You see when you are downloading an app and opening an


account there are those terms and conditions. Most people never read the terms and


conditions. So when you are telling a person you are expected to pay a 1% fee (per day)


after you failed to pay the loan back…by the time that person �nds out it’s like 20 days.“
“…Now the rates had gone high and these are for (unemployed) people who could not even


a�ord their basic needs.”


Breaking Down the Bait and Switch Model for Opera’s 4 Lending
Apps: Worsening Terms Every Step of the Way


We took a granular look at what Opera’s apps claim they o�er in the way of interest rates, versus what is


happening in practice.


1. OPay (Nigeria)


OPay’s app description (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=team.opay.pay) says loans are


o�ered with a ‘maximum’ interest rate of 24% a year in the form of an origination fee:


When users get into the app, however, they see options for 60 to 90-day loans with origination fees that


correspond to a 91% APR.



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=team.opay.pay
But when users actually apply, a process that requires providing personal information and paying a fee,


they appear to instead be granted 15-day loans for signi�cantly lower amounts. See an example from one


user (https://twitter.com/syleyeghele/status/1209001603992375296?s=20) below:



https://twitter.com/syleyeghele/status/1209001603992375296?s=20
We saw multiple recent users on social media complaining of these same ‘bait and switch’ tactics [1


(https://twitter.com/Fhysx/status/1197964395772612608?s=20),2


(https://twitter.com/proxy2811/status/1197766626835419136?s=20),3


(https://twitter.com/PelumiAWOTEDU/status/1188943285039042561?s=20)]:


As to the actual interest rates, we received loan documents


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7kQ0Mi6EdQ1SF) from OPay as part of our research. The �ne print at


the bottom of the contract


(https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/114042045/1b3b6a0c0e3934c94e5baa72/LOAN+APPLICATION+


FORM+LATEST.pdf) shows that the interest rate is 1% a day, plus another 1% per day if a user is late.


In other words; 365% per year, or 730% for late borrowers:


An email to OPay customer service detailed an even higher 1.2% per day fee for 15 days and a 2% fee per


day for late loan repayments.



https://twitter.com/Fhysx/status/1197964395772612608?s=20

https://twitter.com/proxy2811/status/1197766626835419136?s=20

https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/114042045/1b3b6a0c0e3934c94e5baa72/LOAN+APPLICATION+FORM+LATEST.pdf
Given that these rates aren’t presented until the end of the borrowing process, users likely don’t learn


that they have a 2-week loan at absolutely crippling interest rates at the very last minute.


2. OPesa (Kenya)


OPesa’s lending app description (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.opesa.microloan.kenya&hl=en) shows a reasonable 12% APR with no service fee:



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opesa.microloan.kenya&hl=en
[Source: Google Play Store
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?
id=com.opesa.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US)]


When our consultant tested OPesa in late December, the screen prompting them to apply for a loan


showed a less attractive loan term of 70 days with service fees that suggested an APR of about 86%:



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opesa.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US
Once they put in all of their personal information, the loan terms were again worsened to a 15-day


loan with an APR of 438%!


In the �ne print of the OPesa terms of service (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ePkaOcosYqlWs6), we


see that late loans are charged at a rate of 2.4% per day, an APR of 876%.


The only other place we see the real OPesa terms are the app’s FAQ page (https://www.o-


pesa.com/faq.html), which contradicts the terms presented in the app description and the loan


application process.


3. OKash (Kenya)


And here is the app description for Opera’s OKash (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.oplay.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US), showing that the maximum interest rate is 24% per year with


no origination fees.



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ePkaOcosYqlWs6

https://www.o-pesa.com/faq.html

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplay.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US
[Source: Google Play Store
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?
id=com.oplay.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US)]


When it came time to apply, the app �rst suggested that our consultant could get a loan for 28-70 days, at


an implied APR of 84% through origination fees:



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oplay.microloan.kenya&hl=en_US
But then the actual loan term for our consultant ended up being 2 weeks, at an APR of 365%.


These rates were also corroborated by our email exchange with OKash support shown earlier, which


con�rmed that the actual interest rate is approximately 1% per day (365% APR), charged in the form of an


up-front origination fee.


According to the app’s Terms of Service (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2T8HeUX25NNNRB), late


users are charged 2% per day if late, an APR of 730%!


4. CashBean (India)


Lastly, Opera’s CashBean description (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_U


S) suggests a “maximum” APR of 33%.



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2T8HeUX25NNNRB

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_US
[Source: Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?
id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_US)
]


Once our consultant began the loan application process by inputting their basic information, the app


once again lured them in with a suggestion that they could get a loan “duration up to 61 days”:



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_US
Our consultant was unable to procure a loan, but we found numerous user reviews


(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_U


S&showAllReviews=true) that claimed 15 day loan terms at 15%, which doubles if late (365%-730% APRs).


Here are two recent examples:



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loan.cash.credit.easy.dhan.quick.udhaar.lend.game.jaldi.paisa.borrow.rupee.play.kredit&hl=en_US&showAllReviews=true
Google’s �ules: “We Don’t Allow Apps That Expose Users to
Deceptive or Harmful Financial Products or Services.”


Opera: When Borrowers Were Late by One Day, We Accessed the
Borrower’s Phone Contacts and Harassed Their Friends, Family,
Employers, and Co-Workers with Texts and Calls Until the Money
Was Repaid


We also learned of a ruthless OKash and OPesa collection policy that was only recently changed as of


June 2019, according to a former employee.


If a user was late to repay, the app had previously indiscriminately texted or called contacts in the user’s


phone as part of loan collection e�orts. This process began immediately after a loan repayment was


delayed, according to user reviews.


Numerous users reported that friends, family, employers, and other contacts were harassed and


threatened through Opera’s apps when a borrower was late. A Kenyan news article


(https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001310291/how-kenyans-give-up-privacy-for-costly-mobile-


loans) provided one example of the threatening messages used to elicit payment:


“Hello, kindly inform XX to pay the OKash loan of Sh2560 TODAY before we proceed and take


legal action to retrieve the debt,’ says the text message the service provider sends to people


in one’s contact list.”


This type of public shaming and pressure obviously created devastating social consequences for the


borrower. See several examples below from user reviews:



https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001310291/how-kenyans-give-up-privacy-for-costly-mobile-loans
In another example (https://twitter.com/oliviaobiero/status/1118053081701343233), the apps threatened


to place friends or family of a borrower on a national credit blacklist if they didn’t convince the actual


borrower to pay:



https://twitter.com/oliviaobiero/status/1118053081701343233
Additionally, complaints about violation of privacy were found on social media, like Twitter


(https://twitter.com/kirundiray/status/1115109604164239361):


We reached out to two Kenyan credit agencies (CRB’s) to ask whether it is actually possible to blacklist a


person for simply being a contact in a person’s phone who owes money and have not heard back.


A former OKash employee told us that this practice has been discontinued as of June 2019 “because it


was said it was illegal.”


Dire Consequences for Borrowers: Defaulters Are
Disproportionately Young People, O�en University Students,
Who Are Frozen Out of the Job Market and the Banking System


These mass-default lending products can have crippling societal consequences.


For example, several OKash employees described to us a treacherous cycle of fees, which in Kenya can


result in the borrower loaded with debt and unable to get a job. Most government and corporate


employers require a certi�cate from the Kenyan credit agencies, known as Credit Reference Bureaus


(CRBs), showing good credit. In the absence of such a certi�cate, many Kenyans are rendered


unemployable.


One former OKash employee told us:


“Before you take a loan, they usually ask for your ID number. And for us, using your ID number


– there’s usually something called CRB, Credit Reference Bureau…after 30 days they usually


forward names of people who haven’t paid to the CRB – the Credit Bureau is where now


the Kenyan government can come to ensure that most people pay their loans.“


She continued:



https://twitter.com/kirundiray/status/1115109604164239361
“You cannot get a job if you have a negative CRB – credit score or something. So that’s


how businesses ensure that you pay back.“


When we asked another OKash employee about the risks facing the business he said:


“University students. Most of them they are getting into loans. And most of them they don’t have


even stable income. That’s a very risky part for the business because you end up having a big


number of defaulters of which in the end its very young people who are not yet employed


at any point.“


He later described the consequence of these defaults:


“When you are applying for a job in Kenya you need CRB certi�cate. So that’s also a very


major concern…the main problem again, again the issue I was telling you about, the


young people, the age group that is around from 18 to around 28…Those are the most


guys who are in CRB right now.“


We were also told of how common it is for university students to download multiple lending apps and


borrow from each of them to pay o� loans from the other, e�ectively running thousands of mini Ponzi


schemes in order to (temporarily) avoid default while they struggle to pay exorbitant interest rates and


a�ord basics.


We’ve Seen This Story Before: Opera Chairman/CEO’s Deep
Involvement with Qudian, a Short-Term Lending Flop That Has
Plunged More Than 80% In the Two Years Since Its IPO


Opera’s sudden pivot to “micro �nance” is not Chairman/CEO Zhou’s �rst foray into short-term lending or


listed companies on US exchanges. Zhou was a director of Chinese lending business Qudian (NYSE:QD)


from February 2016 to February 2017, before it went public [Pg. 212


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1692705/000119312517312658/d282719d424b4.htm)].


Kunlun, a China-based company that Zhou controls (https://investor.opera.com/board-member/yahui-


zhou), was one of the largest investors in the company and owned 19.7% of it when it went public [F-1 Pg.


8 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1692705/000119312517287443/d282719df1.htm)].


Qudian raised $900 million (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qudian-ipo-pricing/qudian-raises-900-


mln-in-biggest-u-s-listing-by-a-chinese-�ntech-�rm-idUSKBN1CM3BD) in its IPO in late 2017, the biggest


U.S. listing ever by a Chinese Fintech �rm. The company IPO’d at $24 and has already cratered to


about $4.35 as of this writing, a more than 80% decline in a little over two years.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1692705/000119312517312658/d282719d424b4.htm

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qudian-ipo-pricing/qudian-raises-900-mln-in-biggest-u-s-listing-by-a-chinese-fintech-firm-idUSKBN1CM3BD
According to a detailed class action lawsuit, Qudian was alleged to have engaged in �agrantly illegal and


deceptive lending practices. The parallels to Opera’s current business are striking. The second amended


class action complaint (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1p9h1GAYwsDOyf) against Qudian alleged,


among other things:


1. The company falsely stated that it exited making loans to college students in response to a ban by the


Chinese government:


“Qudian nevertheless continued to actively operate and promote its business of lending


to college students up to the IPO and continued these illegal practices even after the


IPO.“


2. The company “employed illegal and unethical means in violation of Chinese laws and regulations, such


as threatening students and calling their teachers, parents, or spouses to exert pressure on the


borrowers. A former company employee reported that the methods used were so humiliating to


young vulnerable students that at least one committed suicide.”


3. The company lent at exorbitant and illegal rates:


“The Company had charged or attempted to charge overdue borrowers a daily interest rate


as high as 5% as “penalties” for overdue loans, which, on an annualized basis is 1,825%, i.e.,


76 times higher than allowed under the Chinese law.“


The allegations have not been proven and the lawsuit is still pending before the court.



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1p9h1GAYwsDOyf
Beyond the obvious similarities to Opera’s new predatory lending business, Qudian’s �nancial metrics


also show parallels. The company had periods of massive revenue growth (at one point almost 500% y/y)


yet its delinquency metrics, competition, and partner/regulatory hurdles ultimately have begun to catch


up with it.


Once again, it is easy to give money away—the hard part is making sure it comes back (particularly


when lending to the world’s most disadvantaged at sky-high rates.)


Conclusion: Investors Should Be Wary of Opera’s ‘Pivot’ to
Sketchy Short-Term Lender and Its Flagrant Violation of Google
Play �ules


We think Opera’s new ‘high growth’ lending business should raise alarm bells for investors. Opera’s


willingness to engage in deceptive, predatory lending to some of the world’s most vulnerable people


should say something about the approach embraced by management.


As we were told by a former OKash employee in Kenya, the “issue is repayment”:


“Now the issue is repayment. All these citizens are usually able – they can borrow, but most


of them don’t have the ability to pay back. Most people who are borrowing from the app –


most people are not employed. So when you’re dealing for example – when I was there – when I


used to call people during time for repayment, most of them would tell you that they’re not


working, so it’s a 50/50 kind of market.“


If Google becomes active about enforcing policies against deceptive and harmful short-term loan apps,


we think Opera’s apps are prime examples. We have reached out to Google for comment on these apps


and whether they violate its terms and will update this report should we hear back.


Part II: Financial and M&A Mysteries That Don’t Add
Up


Opera’s Opaque Related-Party M&A Transactions


Management’s pivot to misleading and deceptive lender to the world’s most disadvantaged raises the


question of what other behavior the company condones.


Why Did Opera Pay �9.5 Million for its OKash Lending Business
by Purchasing an Entity Owned by Opera’s Chairman/CEO, When
Corporate Disclosures Stated Otherwise?
Regarding Opera’s “OKash” Kenyan lending app, we see that the company paid $9.5 million for an entity


that Hong Kong records show was 100% owned by the Chairman/CEO, despite company disclosures


stating otherwise.


In December 2018, Opera paid $9.5 million to acquire a Hong Kong entity called Tenspot Pesa Limited,


which actually owned OKash. [Pg. 92 (https://investor.opera.com/static-�les/f42fc850-3e1e-45e6-8847-


57088e1540bd)]


Opera Claims it Bought the Entity for �9.5 Million From OPay, a
Related Company That Opera has a ~20% Stake In…


Opera stated that it had acquired Tenspot from OPay, a separate company that Opera has a 19.9% stake


(https://investor.opera.com/node/6521/html) in. Per the company’s annual results


(https://investor.opera.com/node/6521/html):


“In late December, Opera acquired OKash from Opay for a consideration of $9.5 million.”


This disclosure made sense given Opera’s other public statements on OKash. When Opera initially


announced the launch (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okash-lands-


kenya-allowing-android-smartphone-users-apply-loans) of OKash in March 2018 (about 9 months before


Opera acquired it) it stated that it was launched by “OPay, the FinTech company part of the Opera


Group.”


…But Hong Kong Corporate Records Contradict This, Showing
that Opera’s Chairman/CEO Owned 100% of the Entity the Entire
Time


We pulled the Hong Kong corporate records for Tenspot. The annual report �ling


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/JPh0EQpF4bYpnH) from just 3 weeks prior to Opera’s acquisition


states that OPay did not own the entity. Rather, Opera’s Chairman/CEO Yahui Zhou owned 100%


of the entity:



https://investor.opera.com/static-files/f42fc850-3e1e-45e6-8847-57088e1540bd

https://investor.opera.com/node/6521/html

https://investor.opera.com/node/6521/html

https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okash-lands-kenya-allowing-android-smartphone-users-apply-loans

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/JPh0EQpF4bYpnH
In fact, every Hong Kong corporate document we found showed that the entity was owned 100% by


Chairman/CEO Yahui Zhou – from inception until the acquisition by Opera. Here are the articles of


association (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/JKj2wYkvJkCtj6) for Tenspot, around the time of its


creation in November 2017, showing the same:


How could Tenspot be simultaneously wholly owned by 2 separate parties at the same time?


We reached out to Opera’s investor relations to con�rm whether it bought OKash from OPay (as


company disclosures stated), or from Chairman/CEO Zhou directly, as Hong Kong entity records state.


The investor relations rep wrote that he was “not sure on the speci�cs of how the entity was set up” but



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/JKj2wYkvJkCtj6
nonetheless re-a�rmed “Okash was purchased from OPay (so OPay received the cash not Yahui Zhou).”


Opera Has Funded and Operated OKash Seemingly from the
Beginning. So Why Did It Pay �9.5 Million to Own It?


Opera’s investor relations contact also wrote in relation to the OKash transaction that “The business was


basically a license when Opera took over”.


This makes sense. Hong Kong corporate records show that Tenspot was created in late 2017, just months


before the OKash app was launched, suggesting that the entity was created for the purpose of owning


OKash or perhaps a license for OKash to operate.


But as part of the disclosures around the transaction we see that Opera had actually lent at least $2


million dollars to Tenspot, thus it appears to have been funded by Opera since the beginning. [Pg. F-55


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919007403/opra20181231_20f.htm)]


Opera also looks to have operated OKash since the beginning. An Opera �ling dated 5 months prior to the


transaction [F1 Pg. 51 (https://investor.opera.com/node/6286/html)] shows that the company owned 80%


of the local operating entity for OKash, O-Play Kenya Limited (https://o-kash.com/kenya/en/Terms-for-


Kenya/) [pg. 52 (https://investor.opera.com/node/6286/html)]:


In other words, Opera funded an entity that it then later purchased for $9.5 million, in order to own a


business that it already operated. This strikes us as peculiar.


If the Hong Kong corporate records are correct, and our suspicion is that they are, the “acquisition”, once


unpacked, appears to simply be a cash withdrawal by Chairman/CEO Zhou, from the public company and


its shareholders.

StarMaker: Why Did a Browser Company Invest �30 Million of
Cash into a Private Karaoke App Owned by Its Own
Chairman/CEO? (With an ‘Option’ To Invest Another ~�49 Million
Soon)


On November 5 , 2018, Opera announced (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-


details/opera-announces-30-million-strategic-investment-starmaker) it had invested $30 million in cash


into Chairman/CEO Yahui Zhou’s private karaoke app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.starmakerinteractive.starmaker&hl=en_US), StarMaker. The investment gave Opera a 19.35%


stake in Zhou’s company, valuing the app business at about $155 million.


Zhou had acquired StarMaker in late 2016 (https://www.prunderground.com/starmaker-american-idol-


partner-to-o�er-front-of-the-line-audition-passes-to-aspiring-singers/00100615/) for an undisclosed sum.


StarMaker’s �nancials have not been disclosed, but Opera’s most recent 20-F states that it was generating


losses [Pg. F-56


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919007403/opra20181231_20f.htm)]. We


asked Opera’s investor relations about StarMaker’s �nancials and they replied that StarMaker was


growing revenue and is now pro�table.


The app looks to be fairly popular, boasting over 50 million (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?


id=com.starmakerinteractive.starmaker&hl=en_US) users largely (https://investor.opera.com/news-


releases/news-release-details/opera-announces-30-million-strategic-investment-starmaker) in India,


Indonesia, and the Middle East. Nonetheless, investors may wonder, what on earth does a karaoke app


have to do with the strategic long-term success of Opera’s browser business (or even with its predatory


lending business?)


Opera’s investor relations told us there is “No integration today with Opera and right now viewed as an


investment (versus strategic).”


Keep in mind that Opera’s July 2018 IPO raised $107 million in net proceeds [Pg. 1


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000114420418040447/tv499398-424b4.htm)], so the


investment into Zhou’s StarMaker app and the investment into the OKash entity represented about 37%


of its newly raised cash, out the door, within just about 5 months.


The StarMaker deal also included (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-


announces-30-million-strategic-investment-starmaker) “an option to increase its ownership to 51% in the


second half of the year 2020”, which we estimate would translate into another $49 million cash


investment, assuming the valuation remains constant.


We hope the company discloses StarMaker’s �nancials to investors before Zhou makes an executive


decision on that investment.

StarMaker Appears to Have Backed a Crypto Startup Meant to
Tokenize Its Revenue Model. Four Days A�er Opera’s �30 Million
Investment, the Crypto CEO was Arrested for Allegedly Looting
Funds, Among Other Misdeeds


StarMaker ran into some immediate controversy following the Opera investment. In 2018, prior to


Opera’s investment, StarMaker appears to have partnered with a crypto ICO called ICST


(https://bitcoinist.com/icst-story-pioneering-content-sharing-blockchain-network/). The ICST token (short


for Individual Content and Skill Token) was intended to give content creators a better ability to monetize


their intellectual property via the blockchain.


StarMaker was the �rst partner for the ICO, and StarMaker owner (and Opera Chairman/CEO) Yahui Zhou

The plan was for ICST to transform StarMaker’s revenue model into a tokenized business, and then later


branch out into other apps. Yahui was quoted (https://medium.com/@icstglobal/zhou-yahui-chinese-


web-tycoon-and-owner-of-grindr-launches-content-sharing-blockchain-company-801acd561da9) as


having a grand vision for the project:


“I see an opportunity to make a great investment, disrupt an entire industry and help


creators earn what they deserve“


ICST’s whitepaper (http://lianzhiliao.com/media/whitepapers/ICST_White_Paper_0.5_en.pdf) detailed the


partnership with StarMaker and described how its revenue model would be reliant on the new token.

The backing of Zhou and StarMaker helped the ICO raise an estimated $2.5 million USD by June 2018


(https://www.advfn.com/cryptocurrency/icolist/ICST). Opera made its $30 million investment into


StarMaker several months later, on November (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-


details/opera-announces-30-million-strategic-investment-starmaker) 5 . Four days after Opera’s


investment, the CEO of ICST was arrested (https://www.thedailybeast.com/grifter-journalist-jerry-ji-guo-

(https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/press-release/�le/1122706/download) alleging he had stolen ICST


funds, among other misdeeds.

At the time Opera announced its investment, there was no disclosure of any missing ICO funds or any


public signs of trouble with the partnership. The token is now valued at zero


(https://etherscan.io/token/0x4d71dd7ddf32a1�94f58ceed3ed1fe2435bb582).


Token buyers have claimed they were cheated (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/54977762) by Yahui Zhou


and that StarMaker should make good on their losses. Zhou has stated that the claims are baseless and


has subsequently distanced himself from the project. Opera’s most current �nancial statements have


begun to disclose the potential for litigation relating to the StarMaker crypto currency partnership. [Pg. S-

All told, we �nd the nature and timing of Opera’s $30 million related-party karaoke app investment to be


unusual. At best, it raises questions about the Chairman/CEO’s judgement relating to this crypto karaoke


misadventure.


More Related Party Transactions: Why Has Opera Directed Over
�31 Million, (Including an Advance of �18 Million in Cash) to
AntiVirus App Maker 360 Mobile Security for Help with Its
Facebook & Google Ads?


Usually, when a company wants help with its marketing, it hires a marketing company.


Contrary to what’s typical, Opera has instead directed over $31 million of marketing cash to another of


Chairman/CEO Yahui Zhou’s related companies, 360 Mobile Security.


Opera has had a marketing relationship with 360 Mobile since mid-2016


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000114420418036749/tv496863_ex10-6.htm), when


a deal to acquire Opera by current management was already in the works


(https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/chinese-tech-group-led-by-qihoo-360-bids-1-2b-for-browser-maker-


opera/?_ga=2.70487703.60213459.1578265609-230859612.1572631629). The agreement called for 360


Mobile Security to negotiate and manage its advertising/media services.

360 Mobile Security describes itself as a security company. We could �nd no other examples of the


company acting as an advertising agency. We reached out to 360 Mobile to ask whether it had any


other marketing clients and have not heard back as of this writing.

The original service agreement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000114420418036749/tv496863_ex10-6.htm) had


billed Opera at an annualized rate of about $10 million.


That rate seems to have stepped up considerably as of late. Two months after Opera’s IPO, �ush with


investor cash, an amended agreement called for a prepayment of $10 million


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919007403/ex_140236.htm) to 360 Mobile


Security.


That prepayment has steadily increased, with $18.4 million in prepayments due to the related-


party as of Opera’s September 2019 secondary o�ering prospectus


(https://investor.opera.com/node/6841/html) [Pg. F-17]:



https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6532232992306287928&hl=en_US

https://investor.opera.com/node/6841/html
The same prospectus indicates that Opera has paid out almost $13 million of marketing and


distribution expenses to 360 Mobile Security in the �rst half of 2019.


We �nd this combined $31 million in cash out the door in expenses and prepayments to be concerning,


and raises further questions for us about Opera’s cash payments to related parties.


To Summarize: Opera’s Cash-Bleeding Related Party
Transactions


1. $9.5 million to buy an entity that appears to have been owned 100% by Opera’s Chairman/CEO,
despite corporate disclosures stating otherwise, to own a business that was already funded and
operated by Opera.


2. $30 million invested into a karaoke app business owned by Opera’s Chairman/CEO, days before the
arrest of its key partner, an ICO backed and supported by Opera’s Chairman/CEO. Opera has an
“option” to invest another estimated $49 million into the app in 2H 2020.
3. $31+ million in cash for marketing expenses and prepayments, not paid to an advertising agency,
but to a related-party antivirus software company with no other known marketing clients.


Opera Appears to Be Quietly Restating Past Revenue, Making
Current Results Appear Better, Without Disclosing It


Beyond questioning Opera’s related party transactions, we also noticed some issues with the company’s


reported �nancials.


When numbers from prior periods start to suddenly move around without explanation it suggests there


could be an internal controls issue. Most companies that restate �nancials provide detail on


restatements in order to assure investors that any mistakes or issues won’t happen again.


Opera has seemingly taken a di�erent approach. Over the past several quarters, the company has


apparently restated past �nancials without disclosing why. The result has been that year over year and


quarter over quarter numbers have appeared better than otherwise.


Take, for example, the most recent Q3 2019 quarter (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-


release-details/opera-limited-announces-third-quarter-2019-�nancial-results). Opera reported that Q3


2018 revenue was $42.795 million:


But when we checked the Q3 2018 numbers reported at the time


(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/08/1647805/0/en/Opera-Limited-announces-


third-quarter-2018-�nancial-results-and-initiation-of-share-repurchase-program.html), we see that


revenue had actually been $44.7 million. Where did the other ~$2 million go?



https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-third-quarter-2019-financial-results

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/08/1647805/0/en/Opera-Limited-announces-third-quarter-2018-financial-results-and-initiation-of-share-repurchase-program.html
In another example, in Q2 2019 (https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-


limited-announces-second-quarter-2019-�nancial-results), Opera reported $49.8 million of revenue in Q1


2019.


But when we checked the Q1 2019 numbers reported 3 months earlier


(https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-�rst-quarter-


2019-�nancial-results), we see that revenue had actually been $51.3 million:


In both cases, the revising down of the previous period made the year over year and quarter over quarter


growth rates more impressive on the headline numbers.



https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial-results

https://investor.opera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opera-limited-announces-first-quarter-2019-financial-results
We checked to see if any recent accounting changes could have been applied retroactively and been the


source of these silent restatements. The company has adopted several accounting methodology changes


as of January 1, 2018, but none appear to in�uence the revenue numbers from Q1 2018 and beyond. [Pg.


F-20 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919007403/opra20181231_20f.htm)]


We contacted Opera investor relations about the quiet restatements. IR had no explanation for the


restatement of the Q3 ‘18 numbers but said they would get back on the speci�c reason.


The Q2 ’19 restatement was explained as follows:


“We changed our methodology as it related to microlending once we had more data. In Q1 we


recognized 100% of late fees. The data showed us that about a minority of late fees are


recoverable, so in Q2 we started recognizing only what our historical data showed we could


recover.”


We appreciate the answer from Opera, but we think these types of changes should be disclosed to


investors without the need for prompting.


We also think this answer shows that the lending segment may be employing aggressive revenue


recognition practices. To recognize 100% of late fees as revenue suggests that every late borrower, no


matter how impoverished, would be able to pay back late fees at a rate of 730%+ per annum. This is


obviously an absurd notion given the massive loan default rates, and makes us question the


revenue/default recognition methodologies in the overall segment.


Conclusion: A Turnaround “Story” That Is Little
More Than a Story


Opera’s deteriorating legacy business, declining �nancials (except revenue), bizarre business pivot, and


related party transactions suggest to us that we may not be witnessing the miraculous “turnaround” story


that the company would want investors to believe.


We believe Opera’s foray into predatory microlending – a business that has already led Qudian


shareholders to over 80% losses since the company’s IPO – will result in a tab that will also be coming due


soon for Opera shareholders.


We also believe that Google, once it realizes the abuses that it is (likely inadvertently) facilitating, will


eventually curtail or eliminate Opera’s lending practices.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737450/000143774919007403/opra20181231_20f.htm
Beyond witnessing the ‘micro�nance’ playbook in Qudian’s collapse, we’ve also seen a litany of other US


listed China based management teams engaging in extensive related party transactions. In many cases,


insiders are able to enrich themselves while the result is far less favorable for shareholders.


Put simply: We feel like we’ve seen this opera before – and the �nal act ends poorly for shareholders.
