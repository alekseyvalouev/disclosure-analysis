Harbin Electric: Who Allegedly Doctored SAIC Reports?
Aug. 24, 2011 12:16 PM ET128 comments
by: Chimin Sang


On August 3, 2011, Harbin Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN) responded to a Citron Research
report posted the same day at CitronResearch.com. In the press release, several
statements caught my attention as they were related to SAIC reports and my access to
those reports enabled me to have my own independent research as to who might not be
telling the truth between the company and Citron. And this article is intended to address
the truthfulness of the third point raised in the news release:


“3. The company believes that Citron used doctored SAIC reports. The
company has recently reconciled its PRC tax filings on a consolidated basis
with its financial statements reported in its SEC filings for fiscal year 2009 and
has not found any inconsistency in any material respect. Its SAIC filings are
largely in line with its tax filings in the PRC.”


Dial Back The Clock
Back in April 2011, I used my China source to pull SAIC reports of nearly all Harbin
Electric’s subsidiaries. After reading through those SAIC reports, I did not feel that the
SAIC representation of the company was far off from its SEC representation. To reuse the
language of the company, I could say that I “reconciled its PRC tax filings on a
consolidated basis with its financial statements reported in its SEC filings for fiscal year
2009 and has not found any inconsistency in any material respect.”
Then on June 1, 2011, Citron published a blog questioning the purpose of Harbin Electric’s
hanging LBO, suggesting that the company might not be as big as it claimed in its SEC
filings and the deal might not take place. What surprised me was not the allegation, but
two specific SAIC audit reports provided in the blog of Harbin Electric’s most important
subsidiary, Harbin Tech Full Electric (hereafter mentioned as “HTFE”). Those two SAIC
audit reports for the year 2008 and 2009 looked vastly different from the ones I had.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/289550-harbin-electric-who-allegedly-doctored-saic-reports 2/34


When I first looked at the two SAIC audit reports provided by Citron, they did not appear
high quality since I had read many well-documented SAIC reports before and I knew what
a proper SAIC report should look like. The 2008 report provided by Citron was apparently
organized out of order; the 2009 report was in the right order but it was computer-printed
and it did not have signature or official chops. In comparison, the reports I had were well
formatted and furnished with official chops and signatures. Not believing that Citron was
sophisticated enough to make up those Chinese documents, my initial thoughts were that
Citron was probably hoaxed by fraudulent documents.
Or so I thought. Nevertheless I took a second look at the SAIC documents I possessed
and I made an astonishing discovery.
Before I go on discussing what I found, I would like to give readers a little more
background knowledge on the SAIC reports. In addition to the annual audit reports
typically short sellers obtain from China and provide to the investor community, the SAIC
reports include all the document trails for company setup, name change, owner change,
capital change and other significant company events. A typical SAIC report includes a
cover page, an application form of about 10 pages long, denoting what changes need to
be made, applicants, company information and so on, supporting documents, and revoked
and renewed business licenses.
The SAIC reports for HTFE I obtained from China were very exhaustive. The size of the
compressed package I received was 36 megabytes, and it contained 28 different sets of
documents, covering every business life aspect.
In particular SAIC audit reports for the year 2007, 2008 and 2009 were included in the files
retrieved. What astonished me from a second look was that the balance sheet of my 2007
file did not match the 2008 file I obtained in the same retrieval but matched perfectly with
the file provided by Citron. What I mean by “match” is that the ending period of the
balance sheet of the previous year should be the same as the beginning period of the
balance sheet of the following year, which is common sense in accounting.
The following table summarizes the SAIC files pulled in April 2007 and you can see the
highlighted yellow area shows mis-matched balance sheet items between the 2007 filing
and 2008 filing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/289550-harbin-electric-who-allegedly-doctored-saic-reports 3/34


This following table shows how the 2007 SAIC file pulled in April 2007 matched the 2008
file provided by Citron. The green area shows the match.


Table 2 (Click to enlarge) 


This discovery was very alarming. My pulling of SAIC files was through a third party
unrelated to Citron, therefore it was impossible for Citron to know what data I had, and yet,
what offered by Citron magically matched the data I obtained, number by number. A check
of the file provided by Citron showed a creation date of October 21, 2010, half a year
earlier than the time I pulled my reports.
With this discovery, I could no longer conclude that Citron was hoaxed. I had two
dramatically different sets of 2008 and 2009 SAIC reports in front of me. They cannot both
be authentic - at least one of them was compromised. But which copy?

I put the suspicion in the back of my head for two more months until the press release of
Harbin Electric on August 3 rekindled my interest. Harbin Electric claimed that it believed
Citron used doctored SAIC reports. So I pulled the HTFE SAIC reports a second time in
August 2011, and what I saw opened my eyes.
This time I also received a huge zipped file, in which I found a dramatically different 2007
SAIC annual audit report and 2003, 2004 and 2006 SAIC annual audit reports that were
not there before besides all other files existed in my April pull (2005 SAIC filing missing).
This 2007 SAIC report contained refurbished financial information and the data, yes you
guessed it, matched the 2008 data this time around. The newly available 2006 file also
showed matching data to the 2007 SAIC report.
The following table shows how consistent the SAIC data look like now, and it portrays a
large and profitable corporation. But there is one thing shouting out: Citron is not able to
modify the digital files stored on the local SAIC computer network in China, but Harbin
Electric is.


Table 3 (Click to enlarge) 


Comparing the two 2007 SAIC reports, one pulled in April (the original document link is
here and an English annotated version link is here) and the other pulled in August (the
original document link is here and an English annotated version link is here), I could see
that the August one was a rescanned paper version with only the pages related to
financial information replaced. I noticed that the page number stamps on the right corner
of those pages showed noticeable differences for those financial related pages.
The following graph compares those stamps side by side. To the left are the stamps taken
from the April file, and to the right the stamps are taken from the August file. The left
stamps show that the second “0” to the right has cuts on the top left corner, the bottom left

corner and the bottom right corner. This characteristic is consistent throughout, including
the page 6 stamp. The same page 6 stamp in the August file shows no such cuts, and the
stamp shows more ink than the nearby stamps. All the “01X” stamps show an even base
line for the first “0” and the second “1” except for the three stamps for the financial pages
of the August report, which shows a lifted “0” base line compared to the “1." The shapes of
the two digits also look different than the others.

Armed with this insight, I went further to compare the 2008 report I pulled in April and the
2008 report provided by Citron. The graph below shows consistent page number stamps
from the Citron file but different page number stamps from the SAIC I pulled, only for the
financial related pages.

Even though I do not have a file to compare with the 2009 SAIC audit file, the following
graph of lined-up page number stamps from the file shows inconsistent stamps for the
financial related pages. They have a pronounced “0” that does not exist in any other page
number stamps.

If you disregard the differences of the page number stamps and trust the current SAIC
files even though the 2007 file dramatically and mysteriously changed from April 2011 to
August 2011, you would believe a sizable and profitable Harbin Electric that the company
would like you to believe, as you find in Table 3. You would belong to the “Company
Honest” camp.
If you do not take the company’s words for granted, and believe that the SAIC files with
inconsistent page number stamps have been compromised, you would come to find a
company much smaller in size, paid no income tax, and reported losses every year of its
existence, as what is shown in Table 2. You would belong to the “Company Dishonest”
camp.
Which side would you take?
My Short Thesis
With my recently gained insight, I have bought put options on HRBN.
I am aware that Yang, the CEO, and Abax Global Capital are using loans from China
Development Bank Hong Kong branch to buy out HRBN. Abax would put in $38.8m cash
equity, $25m debt, and China Development Bank would put in $400m debt to finance the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/289550-harbin-electric-who-allegedly-doctored-saic-reports 8/34


deal besides rolling over the existing shares of Yang and Abax. Being a financial investor,
Abax is looking to profit from the deal by reselling the business privately or publicly above
the buyout price.
There are two possible outcomes. One, the deal closes. Abax bears the financial burden
of repaying $400m to CDB and the rest of the investors get $24 per share. Two, the deal
breaks due to triggering of one of the termination conditions described in Page 9-10 of the
Merger Proxy Statement, failure of representation being one of them.
I would welcome the Outcome One to take place even if it means that I would lose my bet.
The long investors other than Yang, Abax and CDB would be saved from loss in this case.
But I seriously doubt that it would take place. With the great power of the Internet and the
insatiable appetite of humans seeking truth, future investors and exchange regulators will
read this article and view all the evidence I present today. They will do their own due
diligence and choose which camp they belong to. Abax will have the enormous burden to
find investors who belong to the “Company Honest” camp no matter where it chooses to
relist the company, be it Shanghai or Hong Kong. China Development Bank will also suffer
a loss if Abax is unable to resell the company with a profit. I view the exit from this big-
ticket purchase a formidable job for Abax given the evidence I provide. I wish them good
luck to find the next buyer.


The Outcome Two is more likely in my view.


Do Not Let Anyone Else Make Your Decision
Readers should still have doubts with my thesis. How can you be sure that I am not lying
since I took on a short position and I have the motivation to move the price lower? How
can you be sure that I did not doctor the files so that they appear consistent with my
thesis?
These are very legitimate concerns and I am very prepared to address them. You should
not automatically trust me, like I believe that Abax and CDB should not automatically trust
the company’s representation. And you should not assume that I would not do bad things
because I swear I am an honest person.
Always use a third independent party to cross check all the evidence. This is what you can
do to verify what I presented  - use a Chinese agent to get SAIC documents for yourself. In
a separate file that you can download, you will find four SAIC agencies through whom you
can get SAIC documents at around $120 each in about 1-2 business days. You can also
use Google (search 代理查询工商) to find those agencies that can perform the
procurement of SAIC documents. The bottom line is that you do not have to trust the
documents I provided, you can use those agencies that are totally unrelated to gain
access to the very original SAIC documents. And you can decide for yourself if the page

number stamps on those filings are consistent. Do it fast, before the company figures out
that they can cut and paste from the old documents and make it an Italian job.
If you are an institution directly involved in the transaction or invested in Harbin Electric,
ask for those SAIC copies directly from the company now. Or if you already have them,
check if the page number stamps are consistent.
I made all the SAIC files I gathered for HTFE available online, a total of 33 files. The file
list and their locations can be found in this file, including the two 2007 SAIC reports
annotated with English for easier understanding. Non-Chinese reading persons can also
understand other audit files by comparing with the annotated version.
Before I publish this article, I emailed the company IR and gave the company an
opportunity to provide evidence to back their claim that Citron doctored the SAIC reports.
Three business days and a weekend passed. No response. Nada. Nil. Silence.
Disclosure: I am short HRBN.

Chimin Sang:


You are right, of course. However, there was never any doubt that Citron was providing the correct documents, in my
opinion. Nobody was sitting around waiting for Citron to make an inquiry, so they could provide Citron false
documents. As other chinese frauds, such as ONP have done, after the cat is out of the bag about the mismatching
filings with the chinese government, such as SAIC documents, and the SEC filings, the company continues on its
fraudulent path by seeking to either get the Chinese filings changed or providing altered or false ones. The only point
to make is that this was quite obvious from the beginning.

LOL. You're still involved here. How's that short working out for you? Ouch. Its been a fun ride. I respect your
tenacity. Keep up the good work. I won't say I told you so. The share price speaks for itself. Citron has its
pro's and cons. Pumping LFT after putting a short call on it is just plain sleasy. Shows there true colors. But
putting a short call on HRBN by relying on work that Citron has previously published? Thats just lazy.

liberty 1
The $400 loan from China Development Bank is based on the assumption that prior financial statements can
be relied upon. If statements as far back as 2007 are proven to be fabricated, not only does that call for
restatements, and imply securities violations, it totally removes the likelihood that Abax could possibly 'flip' this
company for anything remotely close to what was invested. That in turn implies CDB hasn't a hope in hell
recouping their initial loan with interest etc. 
The SAIC filings are all that matter here.  
The company is at liberty to report any 'record' number they pull out of the hat for all the remaining 10q filings,
that's because these are unaudited. The ultimate, unscalable obstacle will be the 10k filing, in early 2012.
Defunct Frazer Frost will not be there to blindly sign off the numbers- a real audit will be required- and with
that, brings curtains to the charade.

China Development Bank would know better than to use SAIC filings for financial performance. I would
assume, being directly under the State Council, they have access to filings with the tax bureau, which is much
more accurate.

And HRBN with 11 subsidiaries, each required to file audited financial statements with both the SAT and the
SAIC, chooses to bribe the auditor to submit a completely different set of books to ....???? Is HRBN so
ineffectual that they pay for 2 audits? For 11 operating companies? Because...???


As any rational human would do, HRBN submits the same audited financials to the SAIC and the SAT
because it is much less expensive, it is easier to keep track of, and they only have to defend one set of lies.
They are also not so stupid to give one number to the Tax people and much different number to the SAIC who
can look up the tax report on the desk top terminal.

Is there any bank more corrupt than China Development Bank? Look at their history. The analysis being
provided concerning them assumes something that may not be true, that they are approaching this in a
legitimate fashion. Start thinking about ways that China Development Bank may be in on the scam, especially
with them heavily invested in ABAX, which owns a lot of HRBN and these chinese frauds already. You can
then see a motivation for China Development Bank to assist in the fraud. It certainly would not be inconsistent
with their past, in which they have admittedly been involved in a great deal of fraud.

hope that things turn around somehow. Which incidentally isn't what they would do if the buyout were imminent. In
that case, that wouldn't have any need to release such ridiculous PRs, they would just quietly celebrate the fact that
the shorts are about to become irrelevant.

It is one thing to commit fraud in a US-listed company while the company is in China, it is another to commit
fraud in China with the monies of the China Development Bank, which is a state bank directly under the state
council. If executives for state-owned enterprises can be shown the firing squad fraud, you can imagine the
courage and/or stupidity of the chairman (and the senior management team) if he is a fraudster

As deepthroat said, "you are missing the overall". 
See my comment above, where I said: 
Is there any bank more corrupt than China Development Bank? Look at their history. The analysis being
provided concerning them assumes something that may not be true, that they are approaching this in a
legitimate fashion. Start thinking about ways that China Development Bank may be in on the scam, especially
with them heavily invested in ABAX, which owns a lot of HRBN and these chinese frauds already. You can
then see a motivation for China Development Bank to assist in the fraud. It certainly would not be inconsistent
with their past, in which they have admittedly been involved in a great deal of fraud.

What proof do you have to say that CDB is corrupt? I believe that readers here would be most interested if
you can provide some solid evidence.


To put things into context - CDB has over US$200 billion of assets, and the market cap of HRBN is US$0.4
billion. Any gains they make will be a mere rounding error on their P&L.


Also, remember that CDB is a policy bank, and their involvement in the deal is unlikely to be purely for
financial gains. In this case, my sense is that they are here to set a tone, i.e., to prove all the short-sellers
wrong. Personally, regardless whether I am right or wrong vis-a-vis the SAIC filings, I am not smart enough to
bet against CDB.

I haven't found that large companies that act fraudulently have any propoensity not to limit their fraud to only
some involving large amounts. Quite the contrary, they tend to be involved in many more small fraudulent
transactions than large ones. 
Yes, lets believe the propaganda and not use any of our critical faculties and believe that CDB acts just in
accordance with their principles as a policy bank and are not involved in deals for financial gains. hahaha,
yeah, that is how those banks operate. Yeah, CDB really cares about short sellers and whether they are

Excellent work as always.


Might be of interest to you that CSKI shares the same auditor in Harbin...... Heilingong Haitong. The only reason CSKI
hasn't pulled the same trick is the very important structural differences between the VIE and the FIE's.


What may be lost on some of the readership is that Simo traces back to a government owned entity. It was privatized
in 2001 (memory ???). In addition to the YoY financials being consistent in the 2006 -2007 period - as you note - the
summary financials are consistent dating back to ownership by the government. Call me crazy but there doesn't seem
to be much logic in the government lying to itself so I place some confidence in the earlier reports.


It is also interesting to note that the Harbin group has 11 operating entities in China. They all file SAICs on an annual
basis. Though my review is from May or June; the modifications were not present on the smaller subsidiaries. Of
course it doesn't make any sense to have most of the subs report accurately but the major entity needed to revise its
submissions. Hmmmmm... I just file it away as another in the very long string of circumstantial indications that this is
not a legitimate enterprise.

I don't believe the buyout is real. However, I don't currently hold a short position, as the price dropped from its
high, and it could run up relatively close to its "alleged' purchase price, at which time I might consider putting
on a short position again. For example, I don't believe the CFSG buyout will occur, but its price has run up
above $8.30, pretty close to its buyout price of $9.00.

Great work, and as you pointed out there is an out for Abax, still. I considered the possibility that the financials are
accurate and under that scenario the buyout is a poor use of capital. The story of re-listing on another exchange is not
realistic either given current and historical multiples. So I see no rational explanation for this deal consummating other
than for reasons that are fraud-related and must involve the government/CDB. If that is the case, the deal happens
because government officials don't care about wasting taxpayer funds when their payout is sufficiently high. I would
not go long or short on this.

SAIC ensures that the company is in operation, and issues business licenses. The do not require audited financials,
and don't really care about financial performance. It may be a case where the company used an agent for the filings,
without regard to the accuracy. Since some "smart" money decided to pull these filings as evidence, the company
probably corrected the filings in retrospect. More accurate would be the tax filings, if you can get them. And China
Development Bank couldn't care less for what US investors think.

I don't have sufficient information to judge whether the company is dishonest, but it is the truth that many
companies in China do not pay attention to their SAIC filings, sometimes because it didn't matter, other times

to these filings. But simply depending on SAIC filings to say that the company is dishonest is jumping the gun.

I agree that the author likes the Chinese people and its culture overall, but it is despite all the frustrations he
experienced due to the fraud that is endemic to its culture. The book gives one a very good idea what it is like
doing business in China and with the Chinese, and it is consistent both with my experience and with the
experiences that others have shared. A GM executive will be coming out with another book this month about
his experiences in China. I am not attacking china, I am dealing with facts about its culture, including the
rampart fraud. Some of my friends that grew up in America and are not Chinese moved there and like it as
much as the author, and they also have the same or similar experiences and frustration concerning the
rampart fraud endemic to the culture. It is a mistake for you to conclude that because someone likes china or
its culture, they don't have observations, like fraud being endemic, that you (and I) consider negative.

Author’s reply »  I would like to use this space to relate a plot that is taking place everyday in China, no kidding.


Basically the plot goes like this: You walk on the street, and suddenly someone walks fast past you and drops
something, like a gold chain. Before you want to call the person that he dropped stuff, some one standing nearby
jumps in front of you and picks up the gold chain. He sees you, and pulls you into the street corner. He tells you that
now you see it, let's split the gold chain. At that time, the "loser" comes back and ask if you have seen the gold chain,
the pickup guy tells him a negative answer or points him to the other direction. The "loser" clearly mumbles that the
gold chain is worth 1000 RMB.


Now the split continues. One keeps the gold chain and the other gets compensation. The pickup guy won't be the guy
has cash on him, he needs your compensation. If you have enough cash, he takes it and leaves. If you don't, he will
be the guy to keep the gold chain but he needs a nearby bank to get the cash to give you. In order for him to trust
you, he keeps something precious from you and goes to the bank. You hold the gold chain and wait.


End result: He never comes back.

An even more amazing scam is when a Chinese company enlists a blind investment banker and they print
stock certificates. The blind banker tells very gullible people very far away that if they give the banker a bunch
of money for those magic stock certificates they will reap profits beyond the bounds of greed. All hunger pain
and need will be eliminated. You merely follow the piper into the land of Fulvic Acid, Probiotics, Slim Patches,

They get paid to promote the stock. So don't call them stupid, evil, etc...promotion is their calling and how they bring
home the bacon (either via investment banking/other capital raising activities, or through trading commissions). Some
do it ethically/accurately; some don't. But that applies to buyside analysts, short sellers, etc. too. Instead of making
sweeping allegations, I recommend being specific as possible.


Full disclosure: I've never been a sell side analyst and in fact, I've made fun of plenty of them. Let's not get carried
away though.

Silverleaf:


I agree to some extent, but I think the problem is that the sell side analysts try to present themselves as being
unbiased, doing legitimate analysis, and not as sales people for the stock. Someone who does analysis truly
unaffected by the fact they are selling the stock, which is my version of being ethical, won't last long in the job
as they will get fired or adjust to becoming biased. 
With the fraudulent companies, these sell side analysts become, in my opinion, co-consipirators in the fraud.
Look at so many of these companies where the sell side analysts were promoting them and crookedly
arguing against those who have pointed out the company is fraud. Look at the sell side analysts pumping
SPRD hard right now, they are clearly completely lying in my opinion and strongly arguing that the questions
raised by Carson Block do not point out serious problems with SPRD. Very bizarre to me is when they say
these are old, known issues, as if that somehow makes it alright.

It's one thing for sell side analyst to present themselves as unbiased; it's another thing for a fool to believe
that. I suffer no pity for fools who trust (at face value) sales people.


I also don't believe there's such thing as 'unbiased' analysis. . People who do are naive. This is the truth:
Some pump n dump, some short n distort. That is the fundamental nature of markets.


Co-conspirators of fraud... case by case, I agree with you. That said, incompetence is not fraud (and do not
underestimate incompetence).


Lying, deliberate misrepresentation , avoiding/distorting legitimate criticism, etc. are clearly wrong. I agree
with you that this occurred/occurs in the China fraud (and actually in all stocks) space and must be punished
accordingly. The problem I see is that you have similar problems all the way at the top. The Federal Reserve,
Big Banks, Large Corporations, Federal Government, US Treasury, etc. engage largely in similar activities,
yet when things go wrong, those at the top get bailed out. My theory is this has a poisonous 'trickle down'
effect where even the smaller moneyed interests think they're invincible. They believe, or they count on, crime
paying. You steal a loaf of bread, you go to jail. You steal hundreds of millions or billions of people's savings,
you might get a slap on the wrist.


Here's why crime pays less (but still pays) for those not at the top: govt needs to make examples of the easy
targets. Even better if they're small, as it's practically easier to prove fraud. So what we're seeing w/ the china
fraud space is, egregious fraud, and a whipping boy for fraud that is more widespread than just China reverse
mergers. I can almost guarantee you that these China frauds are distraction from going after the bigger
targets (HRBN honestly is a drop in the bucket; no one will care if it goes to zero).


Look at Green Mountain Coffee for example. Its accounting quality isn't much better than the mid-tier china
frauds, yet it's trading for over 1/2 of the Starbuck's market cap. GMCR alone is the size of about 1/3rd the
entire china reverse merger space.

You have provided a thorough and detailed analysis of the inconsistencies in documents obtained through "SAIC
agencies".


However, from my understanding, only persons authorised by the relevant company are entitled to obtain copies of
information filed with SAIC.


Pls refer to this official disclosure on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by a Co. that was also accussed of
discrepancies in its filings with the SAIC. Click on the link: www.hkexnews.hk/listed... 
Key in stock code: 246 and look for the disclosure on 01/06/2011


It is therefore a possibility that the documents you obtained through "SAIC agents" are anything but the official filings

Is it possible that HRBN is a fraud and CDB still makes the loan?


16 Sep 2011, 02:56 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Johnny Inca:


I believe that is possible. 
I am short HRBN and don't believe that the deal will go through.  
Before doing that, I considered any possible ways, no matter how likely or theoretical, that the deal could go
through even if I am correct about HRBN being a fraud. 
One possibility is that CDB does the loan anyway. How could that occur? If CDB executives agreed to do the
deal in  
I believe so. CDB has substantial fraud in its past. Bank executives could possible be bribed, or in on the
scam. CDB has a significant history of fraud with past executives. 
Another possibility is that the open option interest is many times more than the total float (shares outstanding
with the public). With arrangments with others, the company could arrange to finance the buyout, and even
profit from it, through options. 
CSR deal appears to have gone through, although I am waiting for confirmation that the $6.50 a share has
been paid. If one who believed CSR was fraudulent and is correct, and hasn't changed that opinion, it creates
concerns that fraudulent companies can find ways to do a buyout.


16 Sep 2011, 03:40 PM


johnny inca
Thanks BEA. I never heard anything about CSR being illegit. I believe, but could be wrong, that JBird said on yahoo
boards that he never saw a disconnect with their chinese filings and us filing.


I tried to look at CSR's price today and it won't come up on Yahoo. maybe the deal has been tendered / closed?


20 Sep 2011, 06:59 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Deal did close. It seems very likely that It must have been funded, but I have been unable to get any proff yet
that it has been funded.


20 Sep 2011, 11:28 PM


nostores
I'm also under the impression that Bird never found a smoking gun on CSR either which is one of several
disconnects from the CSR buyout and the HRBN buyout. Were there any big charges against CSR by
Chiman, Al, Citron, MW, GEO.. etc? All credible and all of them all over HRBN.


I also agree with BEA's concern that possibly there is some option game where this fraud gets funded. I'm
more confident that HRBN is cooking the books than i am that the deal won't go through.

longhrbn
Roddy / BEA, time for you to come out and say something! The proxy is now definitive and all now that's left is the
vote. Who in their right mind would vote this deal down? You really ought to sit down and think through this again...


So what if the company has some numbers that are not 100% accurate? Why do you care if the Chairman, Abax and
CDB are willing to buy it at a ridiculous price even if you're right? Let them buy a crap company at sky high prices
then! No matter what you shorts are saying, these Chinese deals have been closing: FTLK, CFSG and most recently
CSR.


If you just think through very logically, you'll realize that this deal has a very high chance of success and you should
run and cover your shorts


1) No matter what you say about their numbers, HRBN has gone through at least 5 significant due diligence
processes: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Abax, CDB, Ernst & Young (check the latest filing)


2) Since you guys are so good at reaching out to people to conduct due diligence, you should at least try to reach out
to Abax and CDB to find out what kind of DD process they conduct. Speaking to them would give you a whole
different impression about things. Dont you think CDB can just press a few buttons and find out right away if HRBN is
real or not? They are a state owned bank and has a very extensive network nationally


3) If you were Chairman Yang, why bother going through this buyout process for a whole year? What is the
motivation? If it is to prop up the share price to unload shares, why do it for over a year? The stock has traded so
much that he could unload the entire company a few times already! So why are they still pushing ahead? And why
bother issuing all these strong statements about closing the deal? He is a very reputable figure in Harbin and is part of
the NPC. There is simply too much to lose for everyone involved here (including Abax, CDB) if this were a fraud, and
if you understand only a little bit about Chinese culture, then you would understand


4) If you were Chairman Yang and are trying to defraud investors, would you go out and hire the best advisors to help
you do this fake exercise? Why would you get GS, Skadden and CDB to be your partners? And do you think it is

for a second and imagine how hard it is


Think it is time to face the facts. This will all be done and dusted in a few weeks.


CSR is a much shadier company and even they secured CDB funding and the deal just closed. If CSR can close,
then HRBN is definitely closing. Tell your friends to just cover their shorts and just move on.


03 Oct 2011, 12:07 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
I already said that I covered my shorts and think this deal might close, despite the company being a fraud. In
response to a poster awhile ago, i explained a number of ways the company could be fraudulent and still
have the deal close. I covered when I counted the number of shares there were options out for and it was
something like 4 times the total shares of the company. 
My first clue was when the CSR deal closed, and I didn't think it would. I lost a little bit on that deal. So it is
easy for me to think the HRBN will close now, even though I thought it wouldn't. even if it closes, It doesn't
change the fact that it has committed fraud.

You should have stuck to your conviction and shorted it all the way, how much more could you have lost, you

Saying I am wrong and don't make any sense doesn't make it true. People who committ fraud are often very
tricky about it. Are you familiar with false flag operations? People pointing out the truth often don't appear to
make sense to gullible people like you that fall for the false flag operation tricks. This is similar. I am not wrong
about the company being a fraud. I may end up being wrong in my initial view the deal wouldn't close . . . we
will see. 
If you use your brain and think, instead of shutting it down, you could come up with plausible scenarios where
the company is a fraud, yet the deal will close. It has certainly happened in the past. You will never figure it
out if you just look at the surface and assume everything you are told by the company is true.

You saying that it is true doesn't make it true either. And I love how you're now saying they're being tricky about it.

So you made this whole big stink about a fraud, put your money where your mouth is and ended up losing money.
