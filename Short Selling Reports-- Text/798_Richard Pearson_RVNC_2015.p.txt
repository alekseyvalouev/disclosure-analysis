How Revance Is Misleading Investors About RT002
Nov. 20, 2015 9:30 AM ET12 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Revance has soared 50% to all-time highs based on preliminary data from a Phase
2 study, which appeared to indicate that its RT002 was superior to Allergan’s Botox.


Revance has deliberately shown misleading data and withheld the real information,
which would actually be required for FDA approval.


The CMO quit one day after the data was released and Revance suddenly
announced that in Phase 3 it would no longer be comparing to Botox at all.


For reference, Valeant sold 5 drugs, including competing product Dysport, to
Galderma for just $1.4 billion – indicating that Revance is wildly overvalued.


With no revenues, expect near-term downside of 50% or more.

Background


When I first heard about Revance Therapeutics in 2014, I was convinced that it would be
a compelling long pick based on its story. Revance is best known for its product in
development, RT001, a "topical" botulinum toxin (i.e. Botox) gel, which can be applied
directly to the skin with no injections. But the company is also developing an injectable
RT002, which is intended to be a longer lasting version of the botulinum toxin injection,
hopefully lasting about 2 months longer than Allergan's Botox.


Upon closer analysis of recent events (and due to the recent share price spike), it has
become clear that Revance is in reality a truly compelling short candidate.


Given that the company has zero revenues and its first product is at least 3 years from
being on the market (and even that subject to ultimate approval), it is hard to quantify how
low the stock could fall. But based on the information below, a drop of 50% or more should
be expected.


For reference, Revance went public at $16.00 per share. After hitting $38 in 2014, the
stock cratered back to $15.00, when its RT001 failed a Phase 2 study.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 3/19


The "story concept" of Revance focuses on RT001, which is the topical gel. It is a novel
concept, but even the clinical trials for RT001 are suggesting that it could still be largely
inferior to traditional Botox. RT001 is currently being studied in a Phase 2 trial for use in
hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), but it is only being tested in a handful of patients to
see if it works for a mere 4 weeks.


That is the hope. But it needs to be remembered that traditional Botox works for as long
as 9 months. Revance also recently launched a Phase 3 trial for RT001 for "crows feet"
wrinkles, but results for that will not be in for at least a year. In these other applications,
many are doubtful that it will ever be possible for a large molecule protein to be effectively
absorbed through the skin. But again, that is the hope. It should be remembered that
Medicis Pharmaceutical (later acquired by Valeant (NYSE:VRX)) had an option to license
RT001 for just $94 million (including all milestones but not royalties), but Medicis walked
away, apparently deciding that RT001 did not have that much promise. Medicis' last 10Q
can be found here.


The point is that it is 'not' the RT001 topical gel concept that has been driving the
stock. Instead it is the injectable RT002. It was the presentation in October by
Revance management of interim Phase 2 data on RT002 that sent the stock soaring
recently.


The whole point of RT002 is that it is intended to be better than traditional injectable
Botox. It is hoped to deliver an identical result, but last two months longer. The
comparison to Botox is entire point of the Phase 2 "Belmont" study.


Prior to the release of partial data for its Phase 2 trial on RT002, the stock had been
trading at around $26.00. Following management's presentation of that data (the Belmont
study), the stock quickly soared by 50% to over $40.00. The conclusion presented by
management was that RT002 was superior to Botox across the board.


This is important for two reasons. First, management has hidden or misrepresented
the key data needed to evaluate the prospects for RT002. This is what caused the
stock to soar. Second, the valuation for Revance as a company (even if we assume
ultimate approval!) now visibly exceeds what it should be worth in the market. This
is explained below.


POINT #1: A brief word of common sense

Valuation alone is never a sufficient reason to get short a stock. Overvalued stocks can
stay overvalued for a long time. But when gross overvaluation is combined with underlying
fundamental problems, it creates the setup for compelling short trades.


This was the case when I wrote about Keryx Biopharm (NASDAQ:KERX) earlier this year.
Even though the stock was hitting new lows of $10.00, the stock was still grossly
overvalued at $1 billion market cap and had visible underlying fundamental problems.
That stock has since fallen to as low as $3.00 and now trades for around $5.00.
Downside of 50-70% since I wrote about it.


Not surprisingly, there were no shortage of sell side analysts pitching Keryx as a
compelling long trade with massive supposed "upside". With a high valuation and with
minimal revenues, Keryx made an ideal potential client for fee hungry investment banks.
The wildly bullish price targets followed accordingly.


Likewise, Revance is already trading at a spectacular valuation but several small
investment banks (William Blair, Cowen and Piper) are pounding the table telling us to
expect even more upside. With no revenues and no potential products on the market for
years to come, Revance is the ultimate investment banking client, so this support should
come as no surprise.


But as we will see below (as just as we saw with Keryx), there is likely at least 50%
downside in Revance from here.


Here's the rub.


The market for Botox and its competitors is a $3 billion a year industry. There are currently
4 approved players in this market, all with a highly similar offering. The best known is
Botox / Botox Cosmetic which is marketed by Allergan. There is also Myobloc marketed
by US World Meds. Then there is Xeomin, marketed by Merz.


Last there is Dysport, which (just like RT002) is intended for cervical dystonia and
glabellar lines. Dysport is important because it was sold as part of a package by Valeant to
Galderma in 2014. The total package included 5 other marketed drugs (Restylane,
Perlane, Emervel, Sculptra and Dysport).


The total purchase price for all of these FDA-approved products to Galderma was just
$1.4 billion. Restylane alone had $360 million in global sales in 2013. It was a sizeable
drug. So Dysport alone might have accounted for around half of that $1.4 billion value or
less. That is around $700 million for an 'approved' botulinum toxin treatment 'already on
the market'.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 5/19


Yet, at current prices, Revance alone (prior to approval of 'any' products) is already valued
at $1.1 billion.


Even according to its own time line, if everything goes as planned, Revance won't have
any product on the market for at least 3 more years (2018). And of course ultimate
approval is not guaranteed.


This alone sets up Revance to be a good valuation short at current prices. Its value
already well exceeds what already 'approved' competitors have gone for as recently as
last year.


But aside from just the valuation there are also more important fundamental points to be
made.


POINT #2: What happened to the missing 77 patients?


A cursory read of the Revance Belmont presentation on the Phase 2 results for RT002
appears to be compelling. RT002 appears to be better than Allergan's Botox across the
board.


The problem is that management is misrepresenting the data and playing games with the
numbers. Without such game-playing, we have zero indication that RT002 has any benefit
over Botox. If that is the case, then the downside in the stock is immense.


First off, in showing efficacy, Revance has withheld 77 patients who were involved in the
study. Their results were included in the safety numbers, but then omitted when looking at
efficacy.


This can be seen by a closer read of the presentation.


The study was divided into 5 populations. There was a placebo arm, a Botox arm and
three arms for different doses of RT002.


On the slide dealing with safety, management reports results for 268 patients in total,
roughly 53-54 in each arm. (See N=53,54 at top row in yellow).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 6/19


But when we get to the supposedly compelling data on efficacy, there are 77 patients
missing from the results. Notice that the N changes down to a range of 34-42 in the top
row.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 7/19


These patients were given the product and had some result (either satisfactory or
not). With 29% of the patients missing from the actual data, we have no idea what
the actual results are.


But actually the problems get much worse.


POINT #3: Revance has presented misleading efficacy data regarding RT002


In 2014, the FDA put out a document entitled Guidance For Industry: Upper Facial Lines:
Developing Botulinum Toxin Drug Products. The document spells out clearly what is
required in getting botulinum toxin drugs approved for facial lines.


The improvement in the appearance of wrinkles is scored in points on a 4 point scale. No
wrinkles is 0, mild wrinkles is 1, moderate wrinkles is 2 and severe is 3. Most patients
would start at a level of 2 or 3. This is a key reason why the FDA demands a two grade
improvement. A patient who starts at a grade of 2 and improves to a grade of 1 has
sustained an improvement that could also be considered "noise". That is why the FDA
demands a score of 0 or 1 AND a 2 grade improvement.


On line 364 of that FDA document, we can see clearly that:



http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM407983.pdf

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/19/4238561-14479810920015419-Richard-Pearson_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 8/19


"Success should be defined as achievement of a score of 0 or 1 AND a two-grade
improvement from the baseline, on both the IA and the SSA scales concurrently,
to ensure clinical significance. Because it may be possible to move to an
adjacent category on the assessment scale with only a small level of
improvement, a one-grade change may not represent a clinically meaningful
intrasubject change."


Note from the above that a "one grade change" does not count for significance
because it is simply too easy to end up moving to an adjacent category.


We know that Revance would have definitely measured the two grade changes in this
study. Yet in its presentation to investors, Revance only included the "one grade" change
in the following graph.


More so than any other slide in this presentation, this graph caused the massive
jump in the share price. The graph is basically saying "this is how much better we
are than Botox". This is very important.


The graph shows the duration and the decay in the results of RT002 vs. Botox vs. a
placebo. Clearly the placebo had no effect (bottom line). And just as clearly the green line
of RT002 is above the orange Botox line at all levels.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 9/19


Yet this is a graph measuring changes of 1 point or more wrinkle improvement. Basically,
(according to the FDA) this data is meaningless differentiation because a 1 point change
does not matter for FDA approval.


So to be clear, Revance has shown us data which makes RT002 appear favorable to
Botox, but has deliberately withheld the actual data which was measured and which would
be evaluated by the FDA.


We can be sure of one thing: if RT002 had shown a meaningful improvement at the
2 point level, it would have certainly been shown as a graph. In fact, on slide 8 of
the presentation Revance shows some 2 point changes - but only at 4 weeks, which
is less than the time period that Botox is effective.


So the data we have been given is totally irrelevant according to the FDA.


I am quite certain that the people bidding up the stock are not aware of the FDA's
guidelines on wrinkle scoring as it applies to getting FDA approval. If they were, then they
would certainly not be bidding up the stock at all based on that graph.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 10/19


(As we will see below, following the presentation of this "compelling" data, Revance
suddenly announced that in Phase 3 it would no longer be comparing RT002 to Botox at
all, and instead would be comparing to just a placebo. This should be highly concerning to
anyone bidding up the stock).


POINT #4: Missing patient data


Also in the document above, it is clear that the evaluation of wrinkle improvement needs to
be based on 'both' the assessment of the clinician as well as on the observation of the
patient. In other words, measured patient satisfaction is a required criteria for FDA
approval. Yet again, this key piece of FDA approval data has been omitted in comparing
RT002 to Botox. And again, if the data were favorable, then we can be sure it would have
been included.


It is important to note that if Botox and RT002 received even equal patient satisfaction
scores, then that would be deemed a failure for RT002 for lack of differentiation vs. Botox.
After all, the differentiation vs. Botox is what this study was supposed to be all about.


If Revance had reported patient satisfaction numbers which indicated that RT002 was
equal to Botox, then that would be a failed study and the stock would not have budged.


In any event, patient data is key to FDA approval. And that data was omitted the Revance
presentation which caused a 50% jump in the stock. As we will see below, the medical
review for Allergan's Botox clearly includes this data.


It should be considered very likely that RT002 and Botox BOTH had very high patient
satisfaction scores. In other words, RT002 would likely have been no better than Botox
which would have indicated a FAILED study.


POINT #5: Omitting baseline characteristics


A third omission by Revance was the omission of the baseline characteristics of the
patient populations. For example, it is well known that men are less responsive to
botulinum toxin treatments than women. Age is also an important factor because it
determines underlying skin resiliency. Whether a patient has received Botox in the past
also matters. Yet we are given no data on the comparative populations. To the extent that
there was any skew in the age or the gender between sample groups, then the data
become even more meaningless. Including the baseline characteristics is just common
sense in any such presentation. The lack of such data should be very noticeable.


We can see this by looking at data on Allergan's Botox.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 11/19


POINT #6: Comparing Revance's data to Allergan's data


The best way to illustrate how glaring these omissions are is to look at the medical review
for Allergan's Botox.


Even looking at just one single table provides a wealth of information in the Allergan
medical review, even as this data was all omitted in Revance's presentation.


The graphic above was taken from Allergan's medical review for Botox. There are 3 points
to note. First, because the FDA requires SUBJECT (i.e. Patient) assessments (not just the
clinician's) this is obviously a subject assessment table. It is basically a measure of patient
satisfaction. Remember that Revance did not provide any subject assessment data.


Second, in contrast to Revance, this table is measuring 2 point moves in wrinkle scores.
Again, this is included because this is explicitly what is required by the FDA for approval.
Remember that Revance only disclosed data for moves of 1 point or more for data points
beyond 4 weeks.


Third, there is a breakdown of results by gender for the 315 women and 58 men.


(And perhaps a fourth point to notice is the considerable difference in efficacy in men vs.
women in the data above. That's why this table is important to include in the first place).


Viewing the information above clearly makes the omissions and misrepresentations from
Revance glaring.


If this is not immediately clear, then readers should re-read the section above and
then re-read Revance's Belmont presentation.


POINT #7: Reading "between the lines"



http://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/Botox-for-glabellar-lines-medical-review-2.pdf

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/11/19/4238561-1447981259031377-Richard-Pearson_origin.png
5/22/2018 How Revance Is Misleading Investors About RT002 - Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RVNC) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 12/19


Again, the omissions and misrepresentations should now be seen as entirely glaring.
Based on the data provided, there can be very little certainty that RT002 is in fact superior
to Botox at all. Even if RT002 were a great product and was equivalent to Botox, this
would be a FAILED study because the whole point was to demonstrate superiority to
Botox. If this is the case, then the downside in the stock is now immense.


And now we can see that the plot thickens. A lot.


First, just one day after the Revance data was presented, Revance's Chief Medical
Officer (also a co-founder) suddenly quit the firm. In order to entice him to stay on for
two more months, the firm then offered him accelerated vesting on his options. This can
be found in the subsequent 10Q filing. Readers should ask themselves why the CMO
would suddenly quit if RT002 was such a success and with the stock at an all-time high.
One does not need to be too cynical to come to the conclusion that the timing of his
departure, right after the Belmont presentation, is not a coincidence.


Second, (it gets worse) Revance announced that in its Phase 3 trial, it would no
longer be running a comparative study of RT002 vs. Botox at all.


Instead, it would only be comparing vs. a placebo. Now that you can see the gross
deficiencies of the data provided by Revance, this development should in fact come as no
surprise. Phase 3 trials are much more rigorous that Phase 2 trials and if the ultimate data
showed no relative superiority of RT002 vs. Botox, then it would be a major negative for
RT002. As a result, Revance has simply opted to decline to compare to Botox in Phase 3
at all.


Third, just one week after the data, the company was quick to issue $126 million
worth of stock - even though they had $141 million in the bank already. In March,
Revance had disclosed in the 10K that it has ample funds to get through the next year
without raising money. The equity offering was completed at $36.00.


To be clear, Revance did not need the money. Instead, they simply took advantage of the
all-time high stock price which resulted from the misleading presentation of data. Revance
now has around $9 per share in cash (and no revenues). This provides virtually no
cushion for the share price.


Each of these factors is a clear indication of what management is trying to hide: the "better
Botox" is not what it seems.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 13/19


The fact that Revance will not be comparing to Botox in Phase 3 is of critical importance
for 2 reasons. First, it sheds light on the misrepresentations from the previous
presentation. After all, if the data were in fact so compelling in Phase 2, then why not
confirm it in Phase 3. But of greater importance is that fact that without a comparative
study in Phase 3, Revance will never even be able to market the drug as an improved
version of Botox. It basically loses all marketing ability to differentiate itself. And that is the
only selling point for RT002. This is of critical importance.


Conclusion


Revance is currently developing two products and is best known for its concept RT001, a
Botox-like "gel" which can hopefully be applied topically without needles. But RT001 is not
what has been driving the stock higher. Medicis walked away from RT001 suggesting that
it may not be the product Revance suggests.


Shares of Revance soared by more than 50% following the release of interim "data" by the
company in its Belmont presentation on RT002, the injectable product. The reason for this
share price spike is that Revance portrayed its RT002 as being categorically superior to
Botox.


But we can see a host of misrepresentations and omissions by Revance that cast massive
doubt on this conclusion. The share price should not have budged from $26.00 based on
this presentation at all.


Dozens of patients were omitted from the efficacy study. We don't know which ones or
why or what their impact is on the efficacy data.


In convincing investors that RT002 was superior to Botox (via a graph), the company
deliberately included wrinkle improvement of 1 point or more, rather than using the 2-
point criteria which is required by the FDA. The FDA has already specifically declared
that 1-point moves are irrelevant.


Revance would clearly have measured the number of 2-point moves, but they have
withheld this data in the only place that it matters. This strongly indicates that the real
data is not favorable for RT002.


Also required by the FDA are patient satisfaction scores. And Revance certainly obtained
these scores in the study. Yet Revance has also withheld this data from investors. Again,
even if the patient satisfaction results between the two arms were merely similar, it would

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3701536-revance-misleading-investors-rt002 14/19


be massively detrimental to Revance's ability to claim that RT002 is superior to Botox.
Being the same is tantamount to a failed study for RT002, because the whole point is to
be superior to Botox.


Next, it is glaringly obvious that we have been given no baseline characteristics or
demographics for the patient populations. This is of crucial importance in evaluating the
data because of the different responses for older vs. younger patients and male vs. female
patients.


By contrast, a read of Allergan's Botox medical review shows that ALL of that information
was included (as, of course, it should be).


The fact that the CMO quit his job just one day after this data fiasco should be seen as
very telling.


It is also telling that (despite the supposedly compelling superiority of RT002 vs. Botox),
Revance announced that it would no longer be comparing RT002 to Botox when it
proceeds to Phase 3. This strongly reinforces the idea that RT002 does not really show
any meaningful improvement over Botox.


The only question that remains is where should the stock trade once investors come to the
conclusion that RT002 is not in fact superior to Botox. The easiest answer would be that
the stock should trade back to $26.00, where it was prior to the Belmont presentation. But
in fact if RT002 is not superior to Botox, the real level for the stock should be dramatically
lower.


Because Revance is not running a comparative study of RT002 vs. Botox in Phase 3,
even if the product is approved, the company will have zero ability to market the product
as being superior to Allergan's Botox. This would place the company as another also-ran
competitor among 4 other existing marketed competitors. This is a far cry from being the
market dominating product.


In any event, from a simple common sense standpoint, we can see from the Valeant sale
of already-approved and marketed Dysport for an estimated $700 million, which, even in
the best-case scenario, indicates Revance is wildly overvalued at current prices.


Expect downside of 50% or more.

Let us remember that Revance has released preliminary data only on the RT002 phase 2 results.

Richard,


Excellent analysis. Thank you. I'm very impressed as you've picked up on some nuances (e.g., potential sex baseline
imbalance) that are hard to figure out, except for the most sophisticated healthcare investors. Chapeau!


I would only like to add the following three points:


1.) It is extraordinarily hard to gain market share against Allergan as what basically is a branded consumer products
business. It's a akin to launching a new cola against coke.

According to Bloomberg, both Xeomin and Dysport have a 3-4% Market Share in the US. Both are on the market for
many years. Both have certain advantages over Botox (e.g., faster onset of action of Dysport and Xeomin, no
refrigeration for Xeomin). Still they don't sell.


As you've pointed out, a claim for "6 months duration of action" is completely unrealistic, given the FDA guidance and
the efficacy observed in the P2. Therefore, RT002 would essentially be an undifferentiated fifth to market 'me-too'.


Botox was approved in 1989. If RT002 were to launch in 2019, it would enter the market with a delay of 30 years.


2.) Allergan is developing MT10109L as a potential 'next generation' Toxin. It appears to be superior to both Botox
and RT002. Compared to Botox, it showed a significantly higher response rate at 16 weeks. Unlike Revance, Allergan
was measuring a true 2 point improvement and not using a higher dose.


Here's the link to the study: http://1.usa.gov/1QVOzo9


3.) Revance gamed the trial using a higher dose.


The 20U arm was quite comparable to Botox. The magnitude of difference in duration of action was similar to the
ones observed in trials with Xeomin (http://1.usa.gov/1QVOzod).


Revance only 'won' in this trial by dosing higher and using a more sensitive endpoint, '1 point improvement'. However,
using higher doses has disadvantages in a real world setting since most patients don't want to have a 'frozen face',
but would rather like to retain some expression. I therefore think, that RT002 not only lacks differentiation to current
standard of care, but actually might be less preferred if dosed @40U.


Best, 
Wunderkind

Excellent article and thanks for the insight. I agree with your assessment that the company is overvalued. I have a
question about your second point though. There are missing data points from all arms of the study, including those
treated with a placebo. Why would the company remove placebo treated patients to game the analysis?

it doesnt matter
I completely agree w the author and have been short here since the spike from $26 to $38 and beyond. It's clear
someone is pumping up the stock price and the artificial price hike was to clearly move it for the $36 secondary. Soon
we will see huge unloading and this will drop back down to the 20s although I believe it's worth single digits. I do hope
this goes to $4 because it's a house of cards propped up on air and dreams.

Very comprehensive analysis. It reminds me "the devil is in the details" again. Thank you very much.

excellent article, there's a reason I follow you; )


nevertheless, the recent conference call is pretty clear about what they found: numerical advantage vs. botox, but
strong clinical efficacy vs placebo. lastly, one third still had responses at 6 months, 2 months longer than botox. So
with their revised study they probably hope to present that data to physicians, and let them draw their own
conclusions.


With a bit clever marketing they may still be able to capture significant market share. Plus they just raised a ton at
favorable prices from investors who must know what they're doing.


You're most likely right about price, I'm waiting a bit longer for trading signals before possibly joining you on this trade
like I've done before.


Btw mr. Pearson would you look into a stock I'm long, RKDA? I respect your research skill and have just written an
article on them. I'd love to know what you think of it.

In general the author should be aware that Revance reported data for a phase II and not a phase III study. Phase II
studies are usually designed for dose finding and not for showing superiority. Therefore aspects which need to be
included in a phase III study can easily be excluded from a phase II study design (e.g. patient reported outcomes). It
is no requirement to have such elements in a phase II study and actually they are often kept out of the protocol to stay
within the budget. Therefore the author should be aware that it should not be seen as a fact that data were hidden
because they look bad just because such data were not reported. Furthermore one should keep in mind that this was
the reporting of preliminary data. The full study analysis is still ongoing!


Regarding point #2: The explanation for the "missing" 77 patients is rather simple: The "safety population" contains all
patients ever receiving a single dose of the study medication. The "per protocol population" contains all patients which
fulfilled all the necessary requirements specified in the study protocol (e.g. showing up to the study visits for the
control of the treatment success). It is rather usual that a number of patients simply "got lost" during a study with such
a duration. Certainly no need to suspect any fraud here! And it will be veeeeery hard to do an evaluation for those
patients which simple did not show up anymore on the later study visits! 
Regarding point #3: To me it is a bit ridiculous to state that the company would hide the data for the changes of 2
point or more wrinkle improvements though the author himself included a table showing the data for such
improvements in his own statement (see the second table und point #2)! The data in this table support the information
shown in the graph. 
Regarding point #4: I explained above why such patient reported outcomes may not have been collected. But even if
they were recorded and if this would have been a phase III study and if the outcome was identical with the Botox
group this does of course not necessarily mean that the study failed! If you show that a treatment shows more
sustained clinically relevant effects, with a good or superior safety profile and the patient reported outcome is not
worse than that for the standard therapy then the FDA would have little reason to reject this! 
Regarding point #6: A full statistical analysis (as it was done in the NDA submission for Botox) of a phase II study with

a bit more than a handful patients in each dosing group is meaningless. It is not the aim of a phase II study to
generate such data since these studies are usually absolutely underpowered to show any statistical significance. This
is especially true if the data are further stratified. Botox did this for the genders with a 5:1 ratio of females to men. If
we assume that there was the same ratio in the Revance study this would mean that you would have to do a full
statistical analysis for 1/6th of a treatment group containing 30 patients. Can you imagine doing that for a group
consisting of not more than 5 to 6 men and are you seriously asking for such an evaluation? What would it tell you? 
Regarding your last point: The comparison with placebo. Please read the FDA guidance for the industry you cited in
your own article. On page 5, topic “Trial Design”, the FDA states: "The preferred design should include a comparison
to placebo or vehicle." The guidance is rather new dating from August 2014. Even if Revance had published other
plans before it is very obvious why they will conduct the comparison to placebo in the upcoming phase III study:
Simply because the FDA asks for it! Facing this fact your statement "Now that you can see the gross deficiencies of
the data provided by Revance, this development should in fact come as no surprise." appears to be a bit too
aggressive from my point of view!


I think you rather negative interpretation of the available data from this phase II study and also your conclusions
regarding the "omission" of data goes too far!

Good to read some questions being raised but I agree with MagicV that the conclusions are going to far. At this stage,
it is fair to say that the stock may be overvalued, but that is probably because of the optimism for this product
(RT002)'s potential. A few facts that you stated as such are also incorrect (1) It was not the CMO, Arthur P. Bertolino,
that quit recently, but the CSO and co-founder, Jacob Waugh. Also this was ~3 months before the data was released,
and its hard to conclude that it was because of the data. 2) When Dysport was sold as part of the deal along with
Restylane, Emervel, & Sculptra to Galderma, note that this was for the Aesthetic indications only. Ipsen, the
manufacturer, retained the right to therapeutic indications, and in fact has recently launched in the US on its own. So
even if one goes with your assumptions, ~$700 MM for Dysport rights for aesthetic indications - that could be a fair
price, and more importantly, does not cast doubt on the Revance product potential.


Finally, MagicV makes many (educational) points that this was a preliminary analysis for a phase II trial, so while the
stock can perhaps be overvalued, its premature to conclude on its long term value. Consider the fact that the stock
may have reacted to the news that its is at least as good as Botox (if not better) but has a longer duration of effect
relative to Botox, albeit at a higher dose, though importantly with the higher dose, per the data released, does not
induce any worse AEs. Importantly, its hard to tell at this stage whether this duration effect will hold in therapeutic
indications - which to Revance's credit is what the CEO states during the Q3 investor call. More of a wait and watch!

You're wrong. It was the current CMO Bertolino that 'resigned'. Simply read the 8k filed by co. a few weeks
ago.
