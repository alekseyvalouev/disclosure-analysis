The Universal Display patent troll faces U.S.
Presidential and Congressional bipartisan
opposition.


Posted on October 17, 2013 by asensio.com


Universal Display Corp. (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) is facing its own


real and immediate potential “sudden death” crisis this November.


But that is only one of its problems; another real problem UDC is


facing is ongoing executive and legislative action against patent


troll schemes. UDC’s OLED scheme is one of the most egregious


existing patent troll schemes. Patent trolls, or “Patent Assertion


Entities,” like UDC “don’t actually produce anything,” according to


President Obama, and try to “hijack somebody else’s idea and see if


they can extort some money out of them.”


As UDC’s drama at the European Patent Office (“EPO”) plays out, it


looks as though the U.S. government will be taking an even tougher


stance against patent trolls. Four major industry lobbying groups


recently initiated an ad campaign to urge Congress to crack down


on patent trolls, an idea which has reportedly garnered – believe it


or not – bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans.


Last summer, the White House announced a slew of measures to


prevent patent trolls like UDC from being a “drain on the American


economy.” The White House announcement included both


legislative priorities and executive actions without involving


Congress. This came on top of the reforms put in place by the


Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which institutes “new


mechanisms for post-grant review of patents.” This could be a death


knell for UDC especially since EPO mechanisms being used to


protect the OLED industry and its customers from the UDC patent


troll allow for even quicker and more sweeping challenges than


U.S. law. An invalidation of a UDC patent by the EPO would allow


for a surer path to invalidation in the U.S.

UDC was involved with mundane optimizing experiments in the


1990s that were used to justify absurdly unrealistic broad invention


and patent claims, based on our review of all available


experimentation disclosures and expert consultations and pending


litigation. UDC is attempting to use this scheme to “hijack” (using


President Obama’s language quoted above) development of a


commercial OLED by real OLED manufacturers and OLED


marketers.
