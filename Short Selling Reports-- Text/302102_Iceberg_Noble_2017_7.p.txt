OPEN LETTER TO NOBLE
GROUP’S CREDITORS


November 28, 2017  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 10 Comments  


Dear Noble Group’s Creditors,


It is fair to say that your investment journey with Noble Group has been a


tumultuous one. You probably feel nauseous after the months spent on this


ship. Noble was a very large and diversified commodity trader with revenue


of $86b. It was rated investment grade by three credit agencies. Now, you


own the debt of an agonising group rated CCC-/Caa3. The 2018/2010 bonds


fell to 46.8/40.8 cents on the dollar. The perpetual bonds lost almost all of


their value. Equity holders have been almost wiped out and you are probably


worried you will meet the same fate.


Your hard-earned money did not go up in smoke because the industry in


which Noble operates is suffering. Look at Vitol, Trafigura, Mercuria, and


Glencore: they are all busy counting the millions they make every day. You


suffered losses because a small group of people inside Noble and its auditor,


EY, intentionally misrepresented the balance sheet and the performance of


this company. For instance, an associate, Yancoal, was overvalued by $480m


or 48 times. A few weeks ago, Noble finally capitulated, recognising the


impairment. Billions of commodities contracts fair values were created out


of thin air. We now know that these contracts were worth nothing. Dozens


of other assets were vastly overstated. Etc.


You lost a fortune but a few people have thrived. For example the current


CEO Will Randall, the former CEO Yusuf Alireza and a few others made


dozens of millions. They are now excessively rich. We don’t know exactly


how much because Noble still refuses to disclose their individual


remunerations. When asked to justify this policy, Noble claims the


disclosure would “hurt its standing”. “Its what?”, you may ask. Its


standing… They have a standing at Noble. This is the corporate version of

https://iceberg-research.com/2017/11/28/open-letter-to-noble-groups-creditors/ 2/10


the middle finger and it is pointed at you and at the shareholders who lost


everything.


In the past five years, EY, the auditor that helped Noble to deceive you has


been paid a total of $35m. That’s a lot of money when you think about it.


Every year they substantially increase their fees. The credit agency Fitch


was paid to assign a rating to the new bond issuance in March. Their very


friendly rating of BB+ (stable outlook) was just below investment grade, and


four notches higher than the rating assigned by Moody’s. The arguments of


Fitch at that time were so absurd that there was a distinct smell of


commercial influence. But Fitch pocketed its fee so the agency won’t


complain.


The SGX, the “supposed-to-be-regulator” of the Singapore stock exchange,


financially benefited from the large trading volumes of Noble’s stock. Many


people did well.


The money Noble’s management and its auditor earned has not been


generated by Noble’s operations. The company has burned $1.9b in three


years. This money comes from… you and from the shareholders who


subscribed the $500m equity raising in 2016. You have been financing the


luxurious lifestyle of the few people who worked together to deceive you.


In other words, you have been royally screwed.


Nobody likes to experience that but this is really what happened. The


objective of this open letter is to warn you that you are about to get duped


once again by the very same persons who duped you the first time. We insist


on the “very same persons” because it is the crucial issue here, and we will


try to explain why. To them, you are a cow and they are coming to milk you


again.


Noble has been battling liquidity issues for months. The alternative now is


restructuring or liquidation. Noble has come to you with a seemingly


interesting restructuring proposal. The company offers no haircut on the


face value. The maturity of the bonds would be extended by two to three


years. With some patience, you may recover 100% of your capital. On the


other hand, the proposed mandatory convertible bond would delay a


dilution of the shareholders. Importantly, this allows founder Richard


Elman to retain its ownership percentage, and his influence.


So basically we take the same company without the good assets that have


been sold, the same expensive management team that brought Noble to its


knees, the same insufficient access to bank lines, and the same commodity


industry that sees Noble as a close-to-death counterparty. But this time,


instead of burning cash almost every quarter at an incredible speed as it has



https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFFit992542
7/8/2019 Open Letter to Noble Group’s Creditors | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2017/11/28/open-letter-to-noble-groups-creditors/ 3/10


done for a while now, Noble is supposed to generate lots of cash and


ultimately reimburse you.


We fail to understand how a company led by incompetent management that


has burnt $1.9b in 3 years, recorded trading losses due to bad risk


management, and paid itself sky-high salaries, etc. would be able to turn


this business around.


What remains now is mainly the Hard commodities business (e.g. coal). This


department headed by Will Randall is Noble’s dream factory: it is where


most of the fictitious fair values were created. Noble wants analysts to


believe that the Hards business is a strong cash generator. The CFO gave the


number of $250m to $300m per year in the latest conference call. An


analyst had the good idea of asking what this number was exactly. The CFO


first answered that this was “operating cash flow revenue”. No idea what


this means…. Then he clarified: this is the money Noble makes after buying


and selling cargoes. Oh… all right so this is what Noble calls “operating


income from supply chains”, which means this number is before SAO


expenses, and finance costs. SAO of continuing operations were $228m for


the first nine months of 2017 and finance costs were $156m. With these


numbers, it is clear Noble will be unable to generate a positive operating


cash flow to repay your debt. Most likely Noble will continue to burn cash.


We believe that Noble’s management knows that this plan will fail and that


what they want is to keep their jobs and their salaries as long as possible.


Noble has been sinking for a certain number of structural reasons none of


which are addressed by this restructuring proposal. The same causes have


the same consequences:


 1. Noble does not have the right traders. To make money you need good


traders, and to make it in a consistent way you need good risk management.


What Noble has are mostly financial engineering specialists, experts at


mark-to market creation. The trading loss Noble made in Q1 once again


demonstrated that they don’t manage their risk correctly. If these traders


worked for Vitol, Trafigura, or Glencore, they would have been fired and


replaced a long time ago by better traders. Don’t forget that the reason why


Noble created these huge fair values was to hide trading losses and bad


investment decisions. Trading losses are not a new problem at Noble.


2. Noble will continue to be strangled by the lack of financing/letters of


credit lines. This company has been completely unable to operate normally


for a few quarters already. Banks or counterparties will be reluctant to


increase their exposure after a restructuring deal is signed because they


don’t want to find themselves stuck, as some of you (the RCF banks) are


now. To make things worse, DBS dropped Noble recently. Besides, Noble is


paying prohibitive financing costs, which prevents the company from


competing with its peers.

https://iceberg-research.com/2017/11/28/open-letter-to-noble-groups-creditors/ 4/10


3. It is very likely future liabilities have been hidden on Noble’s balance


sheet. We have repeatedly warned the market about this risk. The problem


with this company is not only that assets have been wildly overvalued. Some


liabilities have probably been drastically undervalued. It is the only way we


can explain how bad Noble’s cash flow generation has been. This is a major


risk for you. You cannot estimate this risk because the auditor (EY) will not


tell you. Don’t believe that Noble’s balance sheet is clean after they


recognised billions of impairments. The numbers are still completely


unreliable.


4. Once again Noble is overly-optimistic on the valuation of the remaining


assets that would back the newly issued bonds. Noble claims these assets


including the stake in Jamalco or Harbour Energy are worth $1b. The


company sold Agri, Energy Resources, the gas-and-power business, and the


oil business. Every single time, the price they obtained was substantially


lower than what they promised. Jamalco is plagued by high energy costs and


there are no details on the stake in Harbour Energy that has been


substantially diluted.


This restructuring will not address any of the fundamental weaknesses that


led to Noble’s collapse.


Now, this is what will really happen. The company will continue to burn


cash or generate minimum operating cash flow. Incompetent traders will


continue to take the wrong bets and ignore basic risk management. Part of


this cash burn will be caused by management’s salaries and bonuses that


they will still refuse to disclose. Counterparties will continue to cut their


exposure to Noble. The company will continue to fabricate its bottom line by


signing dubious contracts that will never be realised. EY will be happy to


sign off on the accounts. Then a few months later, Noble will turn to you


and say: “Sorry the plan did not work because we don’t generate enough


cash flow. We need a new plan.” Oh really?… The company will be in an even


weaker position at that time but senior managers will be richer because of


the huge salaries and bonuses they pay to themselves. Finally, one day, the


head of a bank credit committee will shout at his relationship managers to


tell them that this clown show has consumed enough time and money in his


bank, and that liquidation should commence.


If Noble’s plan is not credible, does it mean that liquidation is the only


option for you now? Not necessarily but it’s high time to address the


fundamental reasons behind the collapse of this company. Everything boils


down to the toxic culture made of incompetence, cynicism, and greed, and


the few people who embody it.


Look around you. You are surrounded by the persons who are responsible


for your financial ruin. Let’s take the example of Noble’s CEO Will Randall.
7/8/2019 Open Letter to Noble Group’s Creditors | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2017/11/28/open-letter-to-noble-groups-creditors/ 5/10


As we suspected in our reports, most of the manipulations came from the


Hard Commodities division run by him. The $1.1b impairment at the end of


2015? That’s the portfolio of Will Randall. The $130m trading loss in Q1 that


accelerated Noble’s crisis? That’s Will Randall. The $1.2b impairment in Q2?


That’s Will Randall. Yancoal overvalued 48 times on the balance sheet?


That’s Will Randall.


Groups like Vitol, Glencore, and Mercuria would have replaced Mr Randall a


long time ago. They don’t keep traders responsible for big losses, bad risk


management; even less, traders who built billions of dollars in fictitious


profit. Mr Randall has been described as the protégé of Richard Elman and


owes him his successful career at Noble and financial wealth. Mr Elman is


undoubtedly the man who ordered Noble’s financial manipulations and Mr


Randall was his hand. We strongly believe that his loyalty to Mr Elman is the


reason why he was appointed and continues to be the CEO.


Noble will continue to do everything it can to hide its trading losses. You


should probably investigate the contracts that the Hard Commodities


division recently signed with an obscure rare-earth exploration company in


Malawi called Mkango Resources. The company is listed in Canada with a


small market cap of Can$11m. Here is a Google picture of the lovely but


unimpressive corporate address of Mkango’s head office in Canada.


Financing and signing offtake/marketing agreements with companies that


don’t produce anything is typical of the way Noble has created fictitious


profit for years.


The people you are talking to, have deceived you and will do it again without


hesitation. More than ever, you need managers who will tell you the truth


and this is not what you have in front of you. The current chairman Paul


Brough is not an outsider who joined Noble recently and has never been


involved in Noble’s shenanigans. He used to be an independent director at


Noble. This former KPMG partner vigorously defended Noble’s accounting

https://iceberg-research.com/2017/11/28/open-letter-to-noble-groups-creditors/ 6/10


back in 2015 when he declared: “The (PWC) reports demonstrate clearly that


the accusations of bad faith on Noble’s part in the preparation of its mark-


to-market valuations have no basis”. He was lying that day and with his


accounting background, he perfectly knew it. He misled investors and this


lie contributed to their financial loss. This is the man who now leads


restructuring discussions.


Another example: when Noble raised a $750m bond offering in March, the


company did not disclose any information about the coal trading losses it


recorded in Q1. When asked why Noble had not disclosed this information,


the CFO Paul Jackaman said that this was “not relevant”. Mr Jackaman is


now discussing the restructuring of this bond with you. The atmosphere of


the meetings must be a bit awkward. One question you may ask him is “Mr


Jackaman, is there a lot of “not relevant” information about Noble that we


should know before we make another decision that might cost us a


fortune?”. Please email us his answer.


There is no “new management” at Noble as we sometimes read. It is the


same people who sank this ship. If only they were good at their job, not


particularly honest, but at least competent. They are not. The disastrous


cash flow performance of this company and its seemingly unstoppable


collapse prove it.


The lawsuit between Noble and us is another example that shows that


nothing has changed. It is still ongoing, hardly progresses, and everybody


knows Noble will have to drop it eventually. This management pursues the


same futile efforts to vindicate its past actions that caused this mess and


your financial loss. As we repeatedly said, this lawsuit has only


strengthened our determination. We will continue to publish and we will


assist the stakeholders who want to legally go after Noble’s managers or its


auditor to recover their money.


A change in this toxic culture and in the few people who personify it is


essential and urgent if you want to put this company back on its feet. Noble


needs new senior managers, ideally coming from another commodity


trading house. They will bring competent traders with them, with an old-


fashioned mentality: a trader is paid to make money and responsibly


manage risk. If he loses money, he’s gone. Nobody will save his P&L with


fictitious fair values.


Top management will have to disclose remuneration, which will be aligned


to real performance. Unnecessary costs will be cut. For example can


somebody explain why Noble has three PR firms in addition to its own PR


department? EY that has completely lost credibility will be replaced by an


auditor that can rebuild confidence in the accounts.

You have left Alireza out – his public stupidity, incompetence and


arrogance are a critical part of this story and should mention the


frivolous lawsuit he filed that disclosed the egregious value of his


non-cash compensation for precisely zero value created.

Noble and the titanic have a lot in common – 1) both have been


steered by arrogant pricks, 2) delusions of being indestructible, 3)


lavish and wasteful spending 4) have caused great financial loss


5) both have been taken down by an iceberg


Any others??


Then at that time when the market knows that the key people who are


responsible for this fiasco are gone, when confidence in the financial


statements and risk management comes back, then banks and


counterparties may be willing to increase their lines, and Noble may have a


chance to survive.


Alternatively, you may continue to put your fate in the hands of Noble’s


management. But please don’t forget one thing: whatever happens to your


bonds/loans, these managers are still earning their salary and their


bonuses, and they still refuse to disclose how much they are paid. For them,


everything is fine. So unlike you, they enjoy the journey and they want it to


be as long as possible.

Where is the risk management at this firm? Isn’t there a credit


and market risk division that should sense-test or stop these


dealings? Is there a head of risk responsible for this?

Brilliant write up again. This is a scam as big as Enron. Creditors


should take the company to court, especially holders of the latest


bonds issued this year. 


You have done great work in exposing this company. A few more


strikes and the last nail would be in.

I don’t know about the liabilities being understated, they have to


expose some of these contracts they have. I seriously agree that a


lot of the assets are overvalued with a lot of goodwill. I think the


issue lies further than incompetent management, there is


probably fraud at hand. For example noble could be selling at a


loss to companies owned by their inside people. It’s basically


internal corruption, the only way noble could turnaround is to


change its management and investigate and repair the


wrongdoings of upper management, even then the share is only


worth 15 cents now.

It’s sad, but the expansions of noble left it with a bleeding cash

The only play i see is just liquidation value.
