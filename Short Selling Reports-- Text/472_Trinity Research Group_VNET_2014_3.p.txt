Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group
Sep. 17, 2014 9:30 AM ET62 comments
by: TrinityResearch


Summary


VNET co-founders Chen Sheng and Zhang Jun (CEO and former COO) directly and
indirectly control numerous related parties that have not been disclosed to the SEC.
We count 16 such.


Eight (8) members of VNET’s executive team and one (1) former employee are legal
representatives, directors, managers or supervisors of these companies. None of
these relationships have been disclosed.


Some of these companies have engaged in undisclosed transactions with VNET or
VNET’s disclosed related parties.


VNET co-founders indirectly control and therefore personally benefit from a related
party that competes with VNET. This violates the non-compete clause of any
standard employment contract enforced as a governance.


All these insider activities put into question the credibility of VNET’s management
and its board of directors, who we believe are not upholding their fiduciary duties.


1. The SEC's Related Party Disclosure Requirements


The SEC requires disclosure of related parties and related party transactions for all
companies listed on a US stock exchange such as 21 Vianet Group ("VNET"). The SEC
defines a related party as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 2/25


Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 57, Related Party Disclosures,
paragraphs 2 through 4 [AC section R36.102-.104], contains the disclosure
requirements for related party relationships and transactions. The glossary of that
Statement [AC section R36.406] defines related parties as follows:


Affiliates of the enterprise; entities for which investments are accounted for by the
equity method by the enterprise; trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension
and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of
management; principal owners of the enterprise; its management; members of
the immediate families of principal owners of the enterprise and its
management; and other parties with which the enterprise may deal if one party
controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies
of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from
fully pursuing its own separate interests. Another party also is a related party if it can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting
parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the
transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.


2. VNET's Undisclosed Related Parties


VNET's latest 20-F for fiscal year 2013, makes various related party disclosures on page
F-63.


Exhibit 1: VNET's 2013 related party disclosures
5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 3/25


We call to your attention the five related companies highlighted in Exhibit 1, all of which
were sold to allegedly unrelated "third parties":


1. 21 Vianet Beijing Intelligence Energy System Technology ("21V BJ")
2. Ningbo 21Vianet Information Technology Co., Ltd ("21V NB")
3. 21Vianet Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd ("21V FS")
4. Tianjin Yunlifang Technology Co., Ltd. ("Tianjin Yunlifang")
5. 21ViaNet Engineering Technology Services Co., Ltd ("VEE")


Footnote 1 of the 20-F states these five companies are to be considered unrelated after
their sale. Since we found inconsistencies between SAIC and SEC filings for VNET in our
first report we were naturally suspicious and investigated these companies' SAIC
registrations. We also ran a search on the SAIC database for all companies either directly
or indirectly controlled or otherwise affiliated with VNET or a VNET insider.

5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 4/25


We were not surprised to find the fingerprints of VNET's co-founders all over many
allegedly unrelated third parties. Other than VNET's VIE aBitCool Beijing Limited and its
holding company aBitCool Limited, our SAIC search returned 21 companies that either by
name, ownership or indirect control showed ties to VNET, its affiliates or their agents.
Exhibit 2 charts the legal corporate structure of these 21 companies (we suspect there are
even more we did not find). Screen shots of the SAIC registered ownership information for
the key companies highlighted below are included in the appendix.


Here are the highlights.


Chen Sheng and Zhang Jun are VNET co-founders (the "Co-Founders"). Chen
Haiying, Chen Li and Chen Wang (note the common last name "Chen") as well as Ye
Jiaxin ("Ye") are allegedly unrelated third parties
The blue arrows designate current ownership/control, while the dotted red arrows
designate ownership/control through 8/15/2012, when ownership was transferred to
third parties. The gold dotted arrow designates control of investments
The blue company is a principal operating entity of VNET and is consolidated
The green companies are disclosed related parties
The yellow companies are controlled by the Co-Founders directly or Chen Li and Ye,
the only shareholders of BCM, a related party company per the 20-F[1]



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17/29409765-1410932027918575-TrinityResearch_origin.png
5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 5/25


Since Chen Li and Ye are by definition related parties to VNET, how can the
companies they control not also be related or at the very least be under the influence
of VNET's co-founders?
The white companies are very likely to be related parties although no information in the
20-F makes them obviously so (as is the case with the yellow companies)


The first thing to note is that Chen Li and Ye are agents of the Co-founders. The 2013 20-
F identifies BitCoolMedia Group Limited ("BCM") as a related party controlled by VNET's
Class B Common stock holders [2], a class that only the co-founders control, with Chen
Sheng as the majority shareholder. SAIC filings (see Appendix) show Chen Li and Ye as
the only shareholders of BCM.


The problem is that Chen Li and Ye are not disclosed in any SEC filing and the various
companies they control (most of the yellow ones) either directly or indirectly through
holding companies are also not disclosed in any SEC filing. This is a major problem. It is
not just a governance red flag, it is also against the very spirit of SEC's insider and related
party disclosure regulations.


For example, Chen Li directly controls Beijing Xienshitong Technology ("XEST"), which is
not disclosed. Chen Li and Ye together control Beijing Wanwei Huoju Network Technology
("WWHJ"), also not disclosed. Their control of WWHJ gives them indirect control of four of
the five companies (21V BJ, 21V NB, Tianjin Yunlifang and VEE) that were allegedly sold
to unrelated "third parties" per the 2013 20-F. (Although we were not able to find the fifth
company in the SAIC database, we expect that company too is controlled by an agent of
the co-founders but may not have been registered with the SAIC.)


Now look at the dotted red arrows from the co-founders to WWHJ. WWHJ was a disclosed
related party to VNET until the 2012 20-F, where the co-founders disclosed a sale of their
shares to "third parties" [3]. Who were those third parties? None other than Chen Li and
Ye Jiaxin, WWHJ's only shareholders.


VNET would have you believe WWHJ and five other formerly related parties were sold to
completely unrelated third parties, but it sure looks like they were all transferred to agents
of the co-founders, does it not?


The obvious questions you might be asking are the same ones we would like to ask
VNET's board of directors. Why are these yellow companies (and possibly more we did
not find) not disclosed to the SEC as related parties? Why are agents of the co-founders
not disclosed by name in the 20-Fs and are instead referred to as unrelated "third
parties"? Who else is involved in these undisclosed activities?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 6/25


We could only find an answer to that last question.


3. VNET's Executive Team Members Are In on It Too


As we investigated the SAIC filings for all the companies in Exhibit 2, we found that
members of VNET's executive team are quietly moonlighting in various roles at VNET's
allegedly unrelated parties. We have summarized the affiliations below in Exhibit 3 and
included SAIC screen shots in the appendix.


Exhibit 3: Management Team Members' Roles in Companies Allegedly Unrelated to VNET


All but four of the 21 companies in Exhibit 3 we identified as related, related but not
disclosed or otherwise highly suspicious have an official of some sort from VNET's
management team. Eight members of VNET's management team and one former
employee are involved.


4. Undisclosed Transactions


Since all 21 of the companies listed in Exhibit 2 are in the data center industry, and most
are suppliers to companies like VNET, the opportunity for conflicts of interest is quite high.


4.1 Yunlifang



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17/29409765-14109328070561705-TrinityResearch_origin.png
5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 7/25


Consider the case of Tianjin Yunlifang, one of the five companies that was sold to "third
parties" in 2013. Yunlifang, according to its own website is a manufacturer of computing
cubes used to build data centers. Yunlifang is 100% owned by 21 Vianet Engineering
Technology Services, which is controlled by Chen Li and Ye, agents of VNET's co-
founders.


Yunlifang's website shows at least three projects that resulted in transactions with VNET,
such as the building of the Beijing Yizhuang and Foshan data centers.


Exhibit 4: Yunlifang's Website Shows Undisclosed Transactions with VNET



http://www.c-cube.cn/
5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 8/25


Yunlifang's website shows at least three projects that resulted in transactions with VNET,
such as the building of the Beijing Yizhuang and Foshan data centers.


In the press release above, Yunlifang announced that it took two months to manufacture
and build nine 52U container computing cubes for VNET subsidiary 21Vianet Anhui
Suzhou Technology Co., Ltd. in Suzhou, Anhui province. The project started on October
2012, two months after VNET's co-founders transferred their direct control of WWHJ,
which controls Yunlifang, to their agents Chen Li and Ye Jiaxin. The timing of the transfer
was certainly convenient if the intent was hiding the project from scrutiny as a related
party transaction.


Why are these transactions not disclosed to the SEC? Why did the founders transfer
control of WWHJ right before this major project? Why is it OK for VNET to do business
with an undisclosed party controlled by its co-founders without investors knowing the
exact terms of every transaction?


4.2 Beijing Xienshitong Technology ("XEST")


Another notable case of a clear conflict of interest is XEST. As we know from Exhibit 2,
XEST is controlled directly by Chen Li, one of the co-founders' agents who holds over
50% equity interest.
5/23/2018 Undisclosed Insider Activities At 21Vianet Group - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2501075-undisclosed-insider-activities-at-21vianet-group 9/25


Pages F-48 and F-49 of the 2013 20-F disclose an RMB 100 million investment in
Yizhuang Venture Investment Fund by 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. (one of
VNET's principal operating entities [4]).


Exhibit 5: VNET's Disclosed Investment in Yizhuang


Although Yizhuang Fund is not disclosed as a related party, at least the investment, which
is material and as large as most of VNET's past acquisitions, is disclosed. What is not
disclosed is that Yizhuang Fund is controlled by Yizhuang 21Vianet Venture Capital
Investment Center LLP ("YVVC"), an undisclosed related party.


Exhibit 6: SAIC filing of Beijing Yizhuang 21Vianet Venture Capital Investment Center LLP


VNET also failed to disclose that YVVC went on to invest in XEST, a company that is
controlled by Chen Li. In other words, VNET used shareholder capital to make a material
investment in a fund that then invested in a company (not disclosed as a related party)
controlled by an agent of the co-founders.


Why was this clear conflict of interest not disclosed?

5. Undisclosed Ownership of Directly Competitive Company


As bad as all that seems for VNET's governance, it gets worse. As Exhibit 2 shows,
VNET's co-founders directly control two undisclosed related parties: aBitCool Network
Technology and aBitCool XiaoWei Network Beijing ("XiaoWei"). One of them, XiaoWei,
controls SH Guotong Network, a company disclosed as a related party (see Exhibit 1) that
operates an MNS business.


There are two major governance problems with that. First, SH Guotong competes with
VNET's MNS subsidiaries. Below is a screen shot of a recent bandwidth reseller auction
run by China Mobile that shows two competitive bidders for China Mobile's business:
VNET and SH Guotong.


Exhibit 7: SH Guotong Competes with VNET in Bandwidth Reselling


No CEO or COO should ever own an undisclosed interest in a company that competes
with the very company they are allegedly running in the best interest of shareholders.
Making matters worse is that the business they control is an illegal one that is not allowed
to resell bandwidth it purchases from state-owned fixed line telcos China Telecom and
China Unicom [5].

6. Conclusion


The byzantine corporate structure of interrelated companies in Exhibit 2 appears to have
been set up to obfuscate VNET co-founders' effective control in companies with which
VNET does business. These relationships and the transactions with VNET have not been
disclosed to American investors through SEC filings, but those with the ability to do some
research through the SAIC can verify these relationships.


Moreover, VNET's co-founders have implicated half a dozen senior employees of VNET in
their undisclosed insider activities, using them as officers of their undisclosed companies.
These are senior employees who investors expect to be single-mindedly focused
professionally on running VNET.


As if that were not enough, the co-founders also control a business that is directly
competitive to VNET's MNS subsidiaries. Like VNET's MNS business, this competitive
undisclosed related party is not licensed to resell bandwidth and is therefore operating
illegally.


That all of the above represents atrocious governance not fit for a public company listed
on a US exchange is one matter. It is quite another that such atrocious governance is in
direct violation of the SEC's disclosure laws. We urge the regulators and E&Y, VNET's
independent auditor, to investigate these findings immediately and take appropriate
corrective action.

discovering the undertable deals and relationship. nice work....why Chinese management teams always do such
things. I remember there are Ambow, Global Water Resources, Longtop, all have undisclosed third party transaction,
and finally exploded and delisted. Chinese companies should learn some lessons.

chinainsights
I think in China many companies founders and senior managers are using their relatives and family members
to control some related parties and benifit from undisclosed and undertable transactions. especially some
public company, as founder could not sell shares, so they figure out some other ways to make money. I think
if it is in China A-share, probably the local auditors will be flexible, but they choose the wrong market for their
IPO. the big four auditor will not be flexbile on this and I think they will dig in, if there is even one related party
transaction undisclosed out these over 20 companies, the auditor will resign. maybe the story ends up this
way, E&Y tries to get some documents from the companies and company lock up all their documents. E&Y
will resgin. I remember it happened on Ambow, Longtop and many other delisted Chinese companies.

That nonsense report took the stock from around 30 to around 19 and change. Even if 10% of this stuff is
actually verified, this is major major shadiness and the regulators have to jump all over it. Absolutely
unacceptable for a stock listed in the USA to be doing this kind of thing.


17 Sep 2014, 10:34 AM


Deepfryer999
No, it was brought down from $30 by the aggressive short-selling of the hedge fund that hired this fraudulent,
anonymous blogger.


On 9/9, the stock was already under $22. The first report was published on 9/10. So the stock is still only
down by ~10% since the first report came out.


It dropped to under $16 briefly, but quickly bounced back.


The 2nd report, obviously has not been nearly as dramatic in its effect.


Almost every analyst following the company has reiterated their price targets of $30-$35 since the report
came out.


Lastly: IDG-Accel (the best VC firm in China) invested in VNET. IDG has invested in hundreds of Chinese
micro-caps and none of them has ever had any kind of fraud associated with them. Not one. Research it if
you want. Every single one of IDG's investments has been 100% untarnished. I will gladly give more info on
this if you're interested.


Long GOMO & VNET.


17 Sep 2014, 11:20 AM


oyechacho
if you think the report didn't cause the weakness after the company beat earnings and the stock dropped like
a rock, you are delusional. who cares when the report hit, obviously a lot of people knew or suspected it and
that was what catalyzed the drop. 30s to 19s is success in my book, 0 pt or not.


Anyway, who cares. The point is this management team has serious explaining to do if even 10% of this stuff
on this new article is right. Are all 20something pages of SAIC evidence in the appendix forged? Methink
NOT.


And by the way GOMO was a good call by the author so not understanding why you keep brining that up.
These guys have made two calls and been right both times on the stock price reaction. 2 for 2 so far, so
whatever they do next i'm following the herd brother.


17 Sep 2014, 11:25 AM


Deepfryer999
Good luck sir! You can ignore the facts and follow the anonymous guy with a 1-month track record.


I will follow IDG-Accel, the most successful VC firm in China's history, who has been investing there for
decades and has never, not once, invested in a company that was associated with any type of fraud.

We're going back over 10 years now but I had a tech startup in Beijing that worked with an IDG funded
company. We never got paid for the work we did and I complained to Pat McGovern. Cutting a long story
short it turned out the founder had done a runner with their money and IDG refused to pay us anything.


My point being that like most VC's/ PE funds IDG invested in it's share of frauds, but most of these funds
won't talk about it. I also strongly suspect that some of them figure out they have invested in fraudulent
companies but don't say anything if they think the company can IPO and they are able to cash out.

IDG invested in allyes and Framemedia (acquired by Focusmedia), AsiaInfo, all forced to go private due to
fraud allegation. one of fraud allegation on Focus Media was their previous acquisitions of Alleys and Frame
Media.


IDG also invested in http://www.116.com.cn, which was sold to VNET, but http://www.116.com.cn never
worked out. checked their website.

I hope you realize, the phrase "forced to go private due to fraud allegation" is the most ludicrious thing I've
ever heard. When a company gets bought out it is generally a great outcome for shareholders, and it is pretty
much the strongest possible evidence that a company is legit. Why would private equity groups purchase all
outstanding shares of ASIA if it were a fraud? You literally could not make any less sense here.


As for GOMO - wait and see. I will hold my long shares and I hope you put your money where your mouth is
and go short. I'll post here in exactly 12 months and we can see what happens. Seriously I will put a reminder
in my calendar right now. GOMO is a very transparent company, you can see their apps in the Google play
store with millions of d/l's. They have never even been accused of any type of fraud. Anyway, again all I can
say to you is good luck.

u need to ask a question, do you feel Auditor will ignore all the issues that Trinity pointed out during the next
annual auditing process?


maybe Trinity already send letters to Auditors...

So you made a diagram showing ownership of some companies in 2012, after which the ownership was transferred to
unrelated parties. And you're surprised that this diagram doesn't align with their related party disclosures... a year
later, for 2013?


And the part on SH Guotong is pretty funny. You try to portray them as an undisclosed related party, when in fact you
said yourself that they are disclosed as a related party on the latest 20-F.


Trying to scare and confuse people with a bunch of gobbledegook. It's only down 3-4% though. You should've closed
your short last week at the low.


17 Sep 2014, 10:37 AM


TrinityResearch, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Wrong on both counts.


#1, the diagram shows ownership of UNDISCLOSED related parties that control companies that were
allegeldly transferred to third parties. But there's two problems. One, the third parties are acutally agents of
the cofounders and therefore not third parties. Two, the undisclosed companies are related parties that MUST
be disclosed per SEC law.


#2. SH Guotong IS in fact a related party and is disclosed, yes. But what's NOT disclosed is that the co-
founders control it through an UNDISCLOSED related party. That's the issue.

I think it is very very suspicious that 1ViaNet's senior managers have various key positions in these sub related
companies. does that mean the company transfer the benifits out to their senior managers in some ways. i mean
these senior managers should know the founders can benifit from these transactions and in order to cover their
mouth, founder needs to give these senior managers something. so i think that is why many senior mangers hold key
positions in these related companies. in China, we call it grandchild company, which is used by company's
management team to steal profits from the company secretely.

The last name thing is suspicious not because Chen is like Smith or Johnson or whatever but because out of
6 names, the chances that 4 are Chen are very very very small.


Anyway Chen, Chin, Chong, Chu, or Chow is not the point!! The point is these guys no matter what the hell
their names are... are the founders relatives or friends or agents who do their bidding and take business from
VNET for the enrichment of the founders without disclosing to the SEC!!!! THAT is the point, and it's a very
serious point.

VNET is a well respected company. As far as I know, a lot of big Chinese internet companies are fighting to access
VNET's data centers only because VNET is the best.


Another co-founder（jun zhang） just declared that he is coming back to work for the company for 3 months to help
other colleagues in this special situation. He retired in this April. Obviously, he has the confidence on the company.


By the way, GIC just bought 5% of VNET. (http://1.usa.gov/1s79KJJ) 
GIC which manage $330B asset (http://bit.ly/1s79KJK) voted with their own money last week, what about you?

Sino-forecast, CCME, Camelot is biggest part for IBM China. Ambow is the largest private education instiution
in China, Longtop's clients are all big banks..


all these fraud companies owned by long term funds.


GIC bought 5% just because its brother company, Temasek's investment was in danger. GIC and Temasek
both 100% owned by singapore government fund. so they just tried to help their own investment out. does not
mean anything.

it, on a small chinese backdoor scale, will make millions, hedgefunds will short it, dump it, etc. The gov't will make
money investigating it, and it will all play out with these guys walking with a slap on the wrist.

I believe USA will be better after 10 years. But China will develop faster. Even though GDP of China will be
higher than that of USA. But GDP per capital of USA will still be higher.


VNET has good business. But in China, since the policy itself has so many flaws. Good business sometimes
need to do something to survive.(What they do can actually benefit shareholder). I give you an example: A
local government want to give a local company some incentives to keep the company. But all these tax rate is
decided by Chinese central government. So the company was told by the local government to report less
revenue and less profit to avoid tax. Then, If you compare a tax record from a local government with a record
from a public company, you will think the public company report higher revenue, which is not true.


China is developing very fast, the law is changing almost everyday. (just like USA 100 years ago, the
economy was developing very fast, but the whole society looks like in a chaos. )


I do not say VNET payed less tax to Chinese government. I just want to say there are a lot of things in China
is not that simple or clear.

TrinityResearch, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Once again, VNET management addresses none of the key issues discussed and denies
wrongdoing in their latest response.


Our key point was not failure to disclose related parties that did not transact with VNET. It was the opposite: there are
at least 21 entities that certainly appear to be related per the SAIC that were not disclosed, and it does not take a
genius to figure out that transactions ARE in fact occurring at some of them, if not all of them. We showed a couple of
examples out of many in which conflict of interest is very high and in violation of SEC's disclosure laws.


The SEC itself smelled something funny and has looked into it in the past, as noted by another poster above. They
simply did not have the local resources we do to investigate appropriately. However, we will certainly notify the SEC
that they missed a lot of important evidence, which we appended to this article.


Let's say for a moment that the company is right (they're not) and they have fully disclosed everything. Do you want to
be long a company whose founders own/control 21 other companies in the same industry? Do you want to be long a
company whose management team is complicit in this weird moonlighting, saying they are running VNET to investors

when in reality they are running a lot of competitive businesses too? Even if there were no related party transactions
(which there are, as we showed above), is that the management team you want to back? Is the board of directors
completely oblivious to all this or are they complicit? Because if it's the former, they should be fired for gross
incompetence, and if it's the latter, they should be sued personally for everything they own and then some for breach
of fiduciary duty.


Finally, while the day traders here appear to be thinking that the stock hanging around the $20 level is a victory, we
can assure you that the company, which was above $30 days before we started to share our work, does not think so.
More importantly, the Chinese banks that VNET relies on to fuel its Ponzi scheme appear to care a lot about what we
found as evidenced by their withdrawal from lending to VNET. See blog post from fellow SA contributor here:

The implications of undisclosed relationships primarily point to fraudulent revenue and assets. I haven't looked closely
but the predictable trend is to see receivables heading north fairly rapidly and the controlled sub to provide high
growth rates. If the author gets copies of the SAIC's for the subs it should become evident if they are actually
responsible for purported sales.


You will also see that the Chinese audit firm for the SAIC filings will be the same firm for the controlled subs as the
parent and the intercompany numbers will be eerily/suspiciously precise.

18 Sep 2014, 02:33 PM


TrinityResearch, Contributor
Author’s reply »  About 30% of the past three years' revenue has been burned in free cash OUTflow. Look at
the 20-Fs yourself, don't take our word for it. Given that, you do the math with their substantial net debt
position as to how likely it is that they really bought that much. Our guess is only a small portion of their
announced $105 million authorized buyback, which per their own press release is NOT a commitment, just a
pre-authorization. In other words, it is for show.


Since their new round of $175million worth of financing has been canceled for now (see here:
http://bit.ly/1uL1rSH), their cash position relative to how much they will burn has never looked worse.


We expect more sources of financings will follow suit and be reluctant to lend to a company that is such a
cash pig, contrary to what the company suggested in their rebuttal conference call. It will be interesting to
hear their explanation for why the new round of $175 million was cancelled. Note that they had NOT warned
investors that they'd be piling on that much incremental debt either.


After their acquisition of iPoo, which is *extremely* overvalued for the declining commoditized business that it
is, and then Dermot, the company will NOT be able to finance their projected cabinet growth without much
more debt. And whether they get that debt is a major question now. So it's back to the usual for VNET:
overpromising cabinets and completely whiffing on the delivery. Overpromise, underdeliver, then lie about it,
the VNET way.

I am trying to understand your report. It seems to me VNET (the listco) and aBitCool are completely separated
companies now, though they have common owners (the two cofounders of 21vnet). aBitCool sold some subsidiaries
or associates company underneath it to different Chen's and Ye in 2011 ( I am not sure if this was done before or after
the VNET's IPO). By regulation, you could call them related transactions. However, does it matter in reality to
shareholders of VNET? There seems no interest/cash transfer from VNET the listco to those Chen's and Ye or the
cofounders whosoever.


You also call those Chen's the agents of the cofounders. The only evidence is they have the same family name. I
think more evidences are needed.  
Cheers.


19 Sep 2014, 01:39 AM


TrinityResearch, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Wrong. We say the Chens are suspicious but make no allegations about their affiliation
based on name. Just point to the very high unlikelihood of four out of six randomly selected guys in China
having the same last name, whether Chen or whatever other name. What are the chances that if you select
six random people in the US, FOUR of them are named Smith or Jones or Jackson? Very, very low. But that's
just an observation.


The only Chen who is verified as an agent in the 20-F is Chen Li. Chen Li and Ye are the only registered
shareholders of WWHJ. WWHJ is disclosed as a related party due to its control by the Class B shareholders
of VNET. And who controls Class B? That's right, the Co-founders. Therefore, Chen Li and Ye are agents.


Just because there "seems" no transaction as you put it does not mean there is not. We gave two examples
of transactions that did occur, but direct attribution to the Co-founders was impossible unless you had the
SAIC data as well, which the 20-F does not have.


aBitCool is one of VNET's two VIEs, iJoy being the other.

Talking of insider trading, I think this author has a lot to explain on his own group's trading practices which show (from
the options trading activity over last 2 weeks) that the author does not really believe VNET going to zero and rather
wanted to cash out on a hit piece as soon as it can practically.

oyechacho
I call BS on that. Shows your inexperience with options. I bought a bunch of puts after reading the article.
Whether I thought the stock was worth zero or 15 doesn't matter that much when you express your view
through options. Unlike stock, options have a hard expiry. So it is not inconsistent at all to buy puts and cash
in on them before the stock goes to 0. AT ALL. In fact it would be the dumbest thing on earth to wait for a
stock to go to 0 when you make a huge return off of shortdated options. Why not longdated options then and
wait for 0? Duh. Because longdated options don't have the same return.


Did I insider trade because I bought puts and sold them at a profit 2 or 3 days later? Gimme a break....


23 Sep 2014, 12:15 AM

I understand options very well and how they work. You don't have to lecture them to me. The questions were
posed to Trinity as I don't see equivalent rolling of cashed in PUTS. A real short or long, for example Ackman
short on HLF or Carl long on HLF or MW short on NQ etc., disclose their positions and confidence in their
thesis. I don't see the same level of confidence in Trinity.

No you very specifically stated they had a lot to explain about insider trading. I don't see how that comment
applies or makes any kind of sense. Insider trading because they took profit on options, something you don't
even know for sure? OK buddy. Your comment made no sense. I took profit after 2-3 days. Did I insider
trade? I think not.


The guys who are obviously doing something as insiders are VNET's management team who is running 21
different companies not named VNET on the side as if that was A-OK for them to do as a US listed public
company with disclosure duties to the SEC.
