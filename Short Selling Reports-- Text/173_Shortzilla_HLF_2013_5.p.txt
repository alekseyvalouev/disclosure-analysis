Did Herbalife Repurchase Shares While In Possession Of Material
Non-Public Information?

by: NA Account


On January 10, 2013, Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) held a conference for the purpose of
rebutting Pershing Square's allegation that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme.


In the January 10th presentation (immediately preceding the Q&A section of the
presentation) Amy Greene stated the following:


Before we open for Q & A I just want to make one statement to you all. Herbalife is a
company, as I've said before, that strives for transparency and as such we would like
to comment on a recent news article. We contacted regulators in connection with the
current situation and beyond that we will have no additional comment.


It is noteworthy that Greene omitted the identities of the regulators (note the statement
was that Herbalife contacted "regulators" as opposed to a regulator). Also, Green omitted
the material fact (as revealed February 19, 2013, when Herbalife filed and published it
10K 2012) that "the SEC's Division of Enforcement…requested information regarding the
Company's business and financial operations" until it filed and published its 10K 2012.


On February 19, 2013, Herbalife filed and published its 10-K for year ending December
31, 2012. Item 1A (RISK FACTORS) begins on page 25 and concludes on page 44.
Slipped into this section, on page 30, is the following:


From time to time, we receive inquiries from various government authorities
requesting information from the Company. Following December 2012 market events
and a subsequent meeting we requested with the staff of the SEC's Division of
Enforcement, the staff requested information regarding the Company's
business and financial operations. Consistent with its policies, the Company is
and will fully corporate with these inquiries. (Emphasis added)


From the unknown date that the SEC requested information regarding Herbalife's
business and financial operations until Herbalife revealed this material fact in its 10-K
2012 on February 19, 2013, Herbalife was in possession of material non-public
information.

On February 19, 2013 Herbalife issued a press release which included its admission that
Herbalife "Repurchased 4.0 million shares of stock since December 31, 2012."


If Herbalife repurchased the (or any portion of the) 4 million shares of HLF stock after the
SEC "requested information regarding the Company's business and financial operations,"
Herbalife repurchased such shares while in possession of material non-public information.


It is difficult to imagine an event more material to investors then the SEC opening an
inquiry into both Herbalife's business and financial practices. While many have focused on
the probabilities of an FTC investigation, we have long stressed that the company's fate
may in fact lie in the hands of the SEC.


Herbalife's latest actions will only add fuel to the fire for the SEC. As stated in our first
report, Herbalife has repeatedly made significant material misstatements about its
business operations, and is operating in violation of a California court order.


We can't predict what will happen as a result of the SEC's request, but we do know that
based on our research and the series of missteps made by management, there is a strong
possibility that these inquiries could lead to significant consequences for Herbalife.


Disclosure: I am short HLF. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Your article would make sense if Herbalife or its directors sold shares.

Selling stock when you have material bad non-public information is a crime, but the same cannot be said of buying
stock in such circumstances. Therefore the point made in the article is mute, other than the "author payment"
mentioned at the bottom of the article.

So, Herbalife gets BAD news that it is about to be investigated that the public does not know about yet. Herbalife buys
shares.


If Herbalife had SHORTED their own shares (which of course they cannot do) you might have an argument. But they
didn't.


In sum:


1) Shareholders were not demonstrably or materially damaged. No damage, no case.


2) The information was not of the sort that would need to be disclosed in order to carry out a share repurchase
program -- particularly if it was previously announced.


This article does not hold water, at all. It lacks common sense, much less legal analytical rigor.


Sorry to say it.


20 Feb 2013, 05:28 PM


Zeus2012
I fully agree with James. While the purchase of shares by the company reduces the outstanding float and thus
shares available to be loaned, not quite sure why this is such a bad thing for the company's shareholders.

Author’s reply »  Whether or not they repurchased OR sold shares while in possession of material non public
information is irrelevant. The fact that they made ANY SORT of share transaction while in possession of the
information is important.

Now i won't sit here and speculate as to why they might want to repurchase shares while in possession of information
which may or may not be considered negative for the business. But if you use your imagination you may see the light.

Shortzilla I was apt to give your comments serious and respectful consideration, but having read your latest
contribution, must sadly conclude that what is 'apt' is your name - hopefully your business will not go the same way as
the Dinosaurs.


20 Feb 2013, 05:52 PM


Robert W Walter, Esq., Contributor
Your post may not be correct. It is not clear whether HLF used a 10b5-1(c) plan to engage in the repurchases.
Incidentally, HLF is not obligated to announce the adoption of a 10b5-1(c) plan, even though it must announce and
regularly update share repurchase information in each 10-Q and 10-K until the repurchase authorization ceases or the
total number of shares authorized for repurchase have in fact been repurchased.


If HLF did use a 10b5-1(c) plan, the only requirement concerning non-public information is that HLF cannot have had
possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan was adopted (July 30, 2012). That also happens to
be the day HLF filed its 10-Q and a Form 8-K. After adopting a 10b5-1(c) plan, the issuer may repurchase shares on a
regular basis pursuant to the plan, regardless of any material non-public information it later receives.


So, without more information about whether HLF adopted a 10b5-1(c) plan (which itself is non-public and is not
required to be disclosed by Herbalife), I'm not sure you can support the conclusion you reached.


20 Feb 2013, 06:00 PM

I believe a 10b5-1(c) would merely give HLF management an 'affirmative defense' to an insider allegation --
they could still get dinged if they actually used the information in making the trades.


20 Feb 2013, 06:24 PM


Robert W Walter, Esq., Contributor
Yes, that is true, it is an affirmative defense. But an intelligent management team will claim that they merely
instructed the broker to continue prior repurchase practices, or that any increase in repurchases under the
plan was made prior to the material non-public information being known. As the SEC is currently investigating
10b5-1 plans for insiders, it may be that this whole area will need to be revamped. In the meantime, however,
I don't believe the post is necessarily accurate absent more information that Shortzilla cannot obtain (absent a
court action).

I agree with your observation that HLF may be covered under 10b5-1 exemption if they can characterize the
recent repurchase of shares as consistent with prior repurchase practices (and that the facts about these prior
practices are not easily discerned) however Shortzilla may have a point: Is it likely that HLF has a valid 10b5-
1 that would cover the repurchase of 4 Million shares in less than 30 days? Neither you, I nor Shortzilla would
be able to obtain the information necessary to define a valid 10b5-1 exemption for the recent share
repurchases by HLF, but IMO the SEC certainly can.

Author’s reply »  Bob, it's a great observation, and thanks for the comment. Instead of leaving a three page
answer to your statement, we drafted up a response which can be found on our site here:


http://bit.ly/1579JGi


The long and short of it is, that based on information provided in its own press release and based on the law,
there is no way whatsoever that Herbalife could have, or did repurchase its shares under a 10b5-1 written
trading plan. We welcome any further comments on this matter.


21 Feb 2013, 09:44 AM


Robert W Walter, Esq., Contributor
I saw your reply and it is consistent with the initial observations you made. I don't subscribe to your response
based on my post above. Unfortunately, the rules around 10b5-1 plans are such that I believe they could have
used a 10b5-1(c) plan and you would not know if they did so.

If I was them I would have released the information, made a mis-step or two during the interview question period, then
bought the drop like crazy.


The only material informatiion they would have had would have been available to everyone... Ie: That they were being
investigated and their books are absolutely fine.


If anything the fact they didn't do this might indicate they are not as confident in their business as they say... Then
again buying shares before a dip might be the best indication of all that they are confident of their model.

This whole Ackman thing is going to go nowhere. Herbalife will privatize eventually, probably in the $45 to $50 per
share range. Ackman will probably still come out ahead as he shorted north of $50, but he will not realize his ultimate
goal of putting them out of business. I look for a trading range between $35 and $40 until a deal is put together.

redgem- that makes sense, however (yes there is always a however) 
I believe you are missing the 11.5 million shares coming off market (float decrease as Icahn exercises @ $26ish) on
March 6th ish. That transaction , which can be done in one full sweep, will cause a squeeze , propelling HLF 15-25% .

redgem
Well 20% above today's close puts you in the mid-40 dollar range. I use cap rates to estimate fair value, right
now HLF is about a 10.2% cap rate. I think a fair cap rate would be about 8% for a takeout given their growth,
or $46/share. So its a buy under $40, a sell above $45.

Are you new to the word insider trading and the the laws around buybacks? I didn't think so....


20 Feb 2013, 09:49 PM


BD1123
They would be repurchasing stock under a 10(b)5-1 plan which was set up pursuant to their buyback arrangement
and prior to "material information". Plan once started will purchase shares based on parameters specified in the plan
(a price range, a number of shares range etc). These are registered arrangements and they were not in breach of any
laws when they repurchased shares.

Funny, it was reported in many news sources on January 9th, 2013 that the SEC was initiating an investigation into
HLF. Did you miss it?

Did HLF really buy 4 million shares? How do we know? They are registered in the Cayman Islands, not the USA.
They can make up any numbers they want. There's no way to check on the accuracy of their financial statements.

The Cayman Islands is a tax haven, set up to provide complete secrecy for their registered corporations. The
government there will be of no help to shareholders seeking redress for financial injuries done to them by HLF.


They may have bought shares and can prove it, but they could have sold them right back into the market, and aren't
reporting that. HLF is a criminal business model. Everything about them is based on fraud.


21 Feb 2013, 05:54 AM


AllenKlee
I don't understand. If HLF had disclosed more about being investigated it is likely that would have caused stock to
move down. According to this article, company was buying back stock. So they were buying back stock at higher
prices than what they would have if they disclosed the information. It is not in the company's interest to buy back
stock higher if they think it is going lower in the future.

sacathanas
Let's say -- for the sake of argument and investing -- HLF didn't have a stock repurchase plan that they were
following. Management buying shares after receiving an SEC inquiry? Sounds like they're not too worried about the
inquiry. Bullish.
