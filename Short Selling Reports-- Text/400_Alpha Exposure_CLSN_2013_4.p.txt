Celsion's Bad News: Everyone Gives Up
Aug. 16, 2013 11:20 AM ET60 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


There's more bad news for Celsion (NASDAQ:CLSN) and we're here to report it. Based
on the Company's continued cash burn in the second quarter, we are revising our price
target down to $0.68 per share, the current net cash balance at the Company. This
represents 42% downside from the current price of $1.17 per share. We expect further
cash burn and for the fair value of the Company to continue to decline. Let's review the
bad news:


1. The "Smart Money" has given up


One of the repeated bull cases for Celsion has been the ownership of its shares by
respected biotech investors, such as Sabby Management and Perceptive Advisors. For
instance, commentator brandond wrote "Sabby, who made an almost $10M investment
recently at around $1.75/share has a good track record and they didn't invest without
having access to lots of information and thinking there is a lot of upside. "Follow the
money" has served me well in the past."


Unfortunately for Celsion's remaining shareholders, the professional biotech hedge funds
have sold every single share that they own. See for yourself. Both the Sabby 13F and the
Perceptive Advisors 13F show zero owned shares. Only a few thousand options remain in
the case of Sabby, including put options that would benefit from further declines in the
price of Celsion's stock. In contrast, these two investors owned a combined 2,222,270
shares at the end of the prior quarter as can be seen here and here that were worth a
combined $2,336,000.


The smart money has sold.


2. The Company has given up on approval based on the HEAT trial


One of the great hopes of Celsion's shareholders was that the post-hoc analysis of the
Thermodox trial would enable it to file for approval, if not in the United States then
elsewhere, such as China. This hope now appears to be dead following the statement in
the last earnings release that "We believe that the emerging data from our post hoc
analysis of the HEAT Study may provide a rationale for continued development of
ThermoDox® and a basis for discussion of a path forward for our HCC program with
various regulatory agencies." On the last conference call, the CEO further elaborated that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1640532-celsions-bad-news-everyone-gives-up 2/14


"our expectation would be in the first quarter of 2014 to begin enrolment of the
confirmatory trial in HCC." Just in case anyone is confused, confirmatory trial means that
the Company would need to run a whole new Phase 3 trial. Shareholders will have six or
seven more years of waiting and many many additional rounds of dilutive financing. This is
in contrast to many of the Company's supporters, such as the Griffin analyst, who believe
that some sort of mythical accelerated pathway exists to reach approval based on the
existing data.


3. The statisticians have given up on the original data mining


In the Company's initial press release detailing its data mining, it stated that "Emerging
data from the HEAT Study post analysis demonstrates that ThermoDox® markedly
improves progression free survival (NYSE:PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients who
had optimal RFA. The analysis indicates that if patients' lesions undergo RFA for 45
minutes or more, they clearly benefited from ThermoDox®. These findings apply to HCC
lesions from both size cohorts of the HEAT Study (3-5 cm and 5-7 cm) and represent a
sizable subgroup of patients." Unfortunately for Celsion's investors, the data seems to be
getting worse and not better. Specifically, in the most recent conference call, the Company
stated "Those patients with relatively small lesions did better when given ThermoDox, as
compared to the control group." Later in the call, the Company also stated that "When we
looked at all patients with a single lesion we saw that longer RFA procedures correlate
very well with improved outcomes in all tumor sizes. This was particularly enhanced in the
ThermoDox group." Unfortunately, this is a further narrowing of the subgroup that
supposedly benefits from Thermodox - whereas previously everyone who got a long
enough RFA treatment benefited from Thermodox, now only the people who either had
smaller lesions or single lesions benefited. This subgroup narrowing should be a warning
signal, because it most likely results from the Company realizing that the previously
defined subgroup was not showing enough of a benefit. As you know based on our prior
article about data mining, the more that a trial's data is sliced and diced, the more
opportunities a Company has to find a random positive data point. In other words,
companies narrow subgroups in order to take otherwise unimpressive data and put a
positive spin on it.


Conclusion


It's been another quarter of consistently bad news for Celsion. The Company's major
healthcare investors sold every share they own. The Company confirmed it needed an
entirely new Phase 3. The data mining got more extreme and the Company still can't find

decreased to $0.68 per share.

Lots of conjecture and half-truths here, again.


1. "Based on the Company's continued cash burn in the second quarter, we are revising our price target down to
$0.68 per share, the current net cash balance at the Company."


Who's we?


2. "Just in case anyone is confused, confirmatory trial means that the Company would need to run a whole new
Phase 3 trial."


Ummm, that's the opposite of "giving up" on approval.


3. In the Company's initial press release detailing its data mining, it stated that "Emerging data from the HEAT Study
post analysis demonstrates that ThermoDox® markedly improves progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(http://bit.ly/IvqSBx) in patients who had optimal RFA. The analysis indicates that if patients' lesions undergo RFA for

Thank you for confirming that ThermoDox still has hope.

Author’s reply »  The Company now admits that it will need an entirely new trial to approve Thermodox.
Previously, there was hope that the data from the HEAT trial would be the basis for approval.


I think you're missing the point on the data mining. The more that you need to dig in to the data to find
something good (i.e. the deeper you mine), the worse it is. Previously, the company thought they could find
good news based solely on the amount of time a patient received RFA. Now the company thinks it needs to
restrict the subgroup to both (1) long enough RFA and (2) either small lesions or single lesions. This is worse.

Will you cover your short at .68 cents? or will you wait for ZERO?

AE, who cares what type of fund they are? They wouldn't be buying if they thought it would hit your target. A
sale is a sale and a buy is a buy...isn't it? Just by skimming over the above numbers, it appears close to an
even trade from bought and sold and the buyers here appear to be more solid institutions. I'm focused on
dividend stocks but I buy others too.

trying to mimic their index. Quant funds turn their portfolios over many times a month. They were probably
playing for a few pennies and have likely sold.

No mention of of the Phase II trial Dignity for breast cancer?


No mention that cash burn has been reduced giving the company 3 or 4 more years of runway?


No mention that the company stated Hisun pharmaceuticals reaffirmed its commitment to CLSN?


Your articles would be much more believable if you included something positive, which there certainly are many
positives for the company. There are two sides to this company and you'd be better served if you acknowledged both
one in a while.

management is jumping out the windows.Only time will tell on this one, but it's no where near as dismal as you are
portraying it as. As far as the Sabby reports go, it seems they have a couple more 'losers" nestled in there...maybe
"smart money" adds and deletes stocks just like any other mutual fund does, it doesn't mean they lost faith...they just
want to make a profit and adjust accordingly. If celsion starts to trend upward, you bet they won't miss the boat.I hope
you can make some money shorting this right now...enjoy it while you can

I agree with your thesis that CLSN is a pile of crap, likely worth nothing, but to use "Sabby and Perceptive are
viewed as smart biotech investors and they bailed on every single share they owned" is illogical: presumably
were they really that smart they would not have bought shares in an obvious pile of junk in the first place.


Also, Perceptive are known to be smart, but sabby are arb players: just hitting the deal to get warrants and
get out.

As a scientist and as someone who has conducted clinical trials, the article hits the nail....., the conclusions are
absolutely correct. They heve to identify a sub-patient population that they "suspect" will benefit from Thermodox
treatment and conduct at least one Phase 3 comparative, randomized, preferably blinded, clinincal trial to convince
clinicians and the FDA. It may take years or the patient population may be so small that it may not be worth it.

The best play would be to sell CLSN now, put that money into APGI, whose business plan and rampup of sales will be
perfectly ramping and peaking starting in about 2 months and bull-rushing over the coming 3 year span, then sell that
once their business model shows that sustaining revenue is starting to lag, then buy CLSN again then, when their
P3's are starting to near the end of the heavy costs, and ride the MRg-HIFU-Mediated Drug Delivery wave to more
profits.


It's a theory. :-)

needs a high stock price so he can sell stock to finance the next phase 3 and pay his salary. $5k in purchased

I guess next month you can write the same article and state "Our fair value for Celsion is decreased to $0.58 per
share."


And then the month after that, you can write the same article and state "Our fair value for Celsion is decreased to
$0.48 per share."


And then the month after that, you can write the same article and state "Our fair value for Celsion is decreased to
$0.38 per share."


And then the month after that, you can write the same article and state "Our fair value for Celsion is decreased to
$0.28 per share."


And so on, and so on, and so on.


I love how you state "Shareholders will have six or seven more years of waiting and many many additional rounds of
dilutive financing. "


Are you kidding??? Six or seven???? HAHAHA


Ok, I love how you say "many many". You had to use the word "many" twice??? Tells me you are getting nervous. All
the lay persons get scared by your articles where you use Hyperboles, that means exaggerations.

Author’s reply »  Yes - six or seven years most likely. The HEAT trial was first registered with the FDA in
February of 2008. It took five years from that point to read out. I think that the earliest the Company will get
another trial registered with the FDA is in about a year - meet with the FDA in Q4, design the trial, etc. can
easily take a year from here. If the trial then follows the timing for HEAT, we're looking at five more years for a
total of six. But there several reasons to think a new trial will enroll slower than the last: 1) Thermodox has
already failed a phase 3 trial so Docs may be more reluctant to enroll patients in a new trial and are likely to
prefer a drug that hasn't already failed, 2) The new trial may have more stringent enrollment criteria (such as
only smaller ablations or only one ablation), which would make it tougher to find qualifying patients, and 3) the
new trial may require at least 45-mins of RFA to be administered which may discourage docs from enrolling
patients because docs value shorter procedures, there is a general belief that less RFA is actually better, and
newer RFA machines have actually been decreasing the amount of time it takes to complete an RFA
procedure. Hence, it could easily take seven years from today IMO to do a new phase 3.

It may take that long here with the FDA but they have become a non issue at this time.


Hisun will be moving this along much quicker than our red tape system ever will. Otherwise, they wouldn't be
reiterating their position and interest in CLSN. They could have backed out after our FDA disagreed with the
results. Our FDA always wants more and apparently Hisun sees what is required to get an approval in China
and leave the FDA wondering what happened. Maybe our FDA didn't receive an envelope as heavy as they
wanted.

geography without a successful phase 3 trial. Since HEAT failed, the company will need to run a new phase 3
- that's my 6-7 year estimate.

WAIT A DAMN MINUTE ; If these super know it all funds bailed out of C.L.S.N. and left all that stock laying on the
street , it should be worth $.00 , but it ain't . Somebody bought all this worthless stock at a Buck or above . I still have
confidence in the Co.as I believe they have other fish they are frying and who knows good news might just be around
the corner . Another addage in closing ITS ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN .....I'm Starting to take a new
position in the stock and I am going to buy on the way down . I hope it does hit $.68..... ROCKYRON

What do you think about the dignity trial? Do you feel anything positive will come of it or will it be a total
failure?

Author’s reply »  I think there are major problems with the trial, not the least of which is that it's been recruiting for 4
years to try to find 20 people. That's not a good sign. It's also open label (and I think there is no placebo control) so
you can't really tell what the effects are. I'm sure the miscreants running clsn will claim it's some huge success and
then pursue a phase 3 based on it. Laughable

I like the inclusion of the "when " in your response to pete p..."I don't work for anyone else (when) I write these
articles"...how about when you're not writing these articles?...the devil is in the details, nice try though

Why would he be working with pharmaceutical companies? That question doesn't even make sense. The
usual question is if he's working for hedge funds, and he was polite enough to say he wasn't working for
anyone. I have to say all the comments by retail traders on this article are embarrassingly pathetic. Looks like
all the smart money is gone from this stock for sure.

Gee, I don't know, maybe a competing pharma company wants CLSN to fail. hmmmmmmmm


The question makes more sense than you think. Let's face it, there are things going on behind the scenes
here that are shady. While I'm sure we'll never find out about them, they are going on. It's simply a fact of life.

Author’s reply »  Short squeeze. ha ha. I would welcome the opportunity to short more at higher prices. It's a
small position for me, but I think the mgmt is basically crooks so I like to write about them.

how sad for you. Obviously there are some underlying issues and innerworkings here that aren't being
disclosed.

"1. The "Smart Money" has given up"


You mentioned "the professional biotech hedge funds have sold every single share that they own." Can you name
some? The two you mentioned, shows they don't own any CLSN shares, but also doesn't show they used to own it.
Did they ever own CLSN shares in the past?


Yahoo shows: 
13.4% held by institutions 
37.29% held by insiders 
Also shows that the short position has declined.


"2. The Company has given up on approval based on the HEAT trial"


Is this a fact? Did you ask the company? Did CLSN said they've "given up"?


"3. The statisticians have given up on the original data mining"


Who are these "statisticians"? Did you asked them? Did they say they've "given up"?


In the past you mention that ThermoDox is a drug, is it a drug or a delivery system? Because, I don't see in this article
that you mention it as "drug".


Thanks.
