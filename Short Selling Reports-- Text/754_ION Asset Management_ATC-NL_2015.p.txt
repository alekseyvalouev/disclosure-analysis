Altice has overpaid for its acquisitions

Industry headwinds threaten traditional Pay-TV 
 









































- 7.3% of US households have broadband but 


no pay-TV subscription, up from 4.2% in 2010 


- Rise of alternative OTT players  


- Broadband connection has become 


commoditized – aka “dumb pipe” 


Altice valuations have soared as sector headwinds have accelerated

Implausible EBITDA margins 
- Altice claims that it has increased margins across its holdings 





























 We question whether HOT’s “real” EBITDA margin has improved by 900bp

Cablevision: Does this deal mark the top? 
 









































- Altice is paying a historically high multiple of 10x EBITDA for Cablevision 


- Unsecured bonds raised for the Cablevision deal were sold at over 10% 


yield, reflecting doubts around the company’s ability to service its debt

Wall Street overlooks the issues 
- “Our 12-month ROIC-based price target of €41/shr incorporates a premium above our €30/shr valuation 


to capture Altice’s M&A potential” –Goldman Sachs note on Altice, Sept 8, 2015 





- “Given that the NAV is clearly growing, we place a 25% premium to NAV in determining our 
€38.00/share equity valuation.” –RBC Capital note on Altice, Sept 18, 2015 





- “Adding €3.5bn for a 50% probability of a revived Bouygues deal and a further € 4.7bn from additional 
M&A (based on our “PE” model) leading to a post-M&A Dec-16 TP of €28. –JPMorgan note on Altice, 
Sept 1, 2015 





- Citi adds €2.5 of value for unknown future deals to Altice’s price target in a Sum of the Parts 
 











Lucrative Wall Street fees ($200m for Cablevision alone) coincide 


with many sell-side analysts assigning lofty multiples and adding 


value for unknown future deals

10 questions for Altice management 
1. How do you explain fully the discrepancy between HOT’s reported 2Q15 43% EBITDA margin and your reported HOT 


margin of 48%? 


2. Why has HOT been aggressively growing capitalized content costs while reducing expensed content costs? 


3. Has Numericable shifted content costs from the P&L to the Balance Sheet? 


4. When do you expect to reverse subscriber losses in Israel and France? 


5. How much are content costs expected to rise at Cablevision over the next 3 years? 


6. How can Cablevision without a mobile offering effectively compete against Verizon triple play? 


7. Can you explain the difference in Cablevision cost-cutting guidance between equity holders and bond holders? 


8. Why do you think that you can generate EBITDA margins in the US that far exceed those of any other US operator, 


including those with greater scale? 


9. Why did you create a dual class structure despite the Expert Corporate Governance Service advising against it? 


10. Your aggressive cost-cutting efforts in Israel resulted in a large number of customer losses “due to poor service” and 


you’ve had to invest in “restoring customer service levels” (Altice 3Q14, 1Q15 earnings releases) . Why do you believe 


that this creates long-term shareholder value?

Summary  
History is replete with sectors whose valuations reached 


disproportionate levels and then crashed. Every boom and bust cycle 
has a poster boy. In this cycle, it’s Altice 





 
- We believe that Altice’s operating track record is far less impressive 


than we’re led to believe 


- We question management’s ability to retain subscribers and 


whether they’ve utilized aggressive accounting to inflate EBITDA 


margins 


- In our view, Altice has overpaid for Pay-TV acquisitions against the 


rising tide of OTT alternatives and cord cutting 


- On realistic multiples, we believe shares are worth ~50% below the 


current price
