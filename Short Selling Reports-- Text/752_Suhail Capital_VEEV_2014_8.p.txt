Veeva: 'Back To School'

"Oh, you left out a bunch of stuff!"- Thornton Mellon


While we are grateful for an 8-k actually acknowledging that everything we published was
factually accurate, (Btw - Nice knee-jerk note Pacific Crest! We think you smashed the
time record for a bullish sell-side underwriter analyst being shot down with a contradictory
8-k from the company he covers), we'd like to know, if Genentech was no longer a
customer as of July 31st, 2013, then why was no 8-k put out in response to all these
articles?


CNBC 10/16/2013 - "Veeva Systems IPO Shows Updraft in Cloud Business"


Same Article On Veeva Website Under Media - Yes, we know you probably can't believe
that this is STILL UP ON VEEVA'S WEBSITE and clearly contradicts its 8-k disclosure
from yesterday. But yes, it is in fact true and we have time-stamped this, so please go
ahead and take it down.


Also, doesn't one wonder, with Genentech only accounting for 2k seats, why was it
repeatedly highlighted in IPO press as the other big customer name next to disclosed
2012 10% revenue customers Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS)? We will tell
you why - because its brand equity as far as innovation and being the first mover (it was
Veeva's (NYSE:VEEV) first big name customer) to the cloud is so strong, and Veeva
wanted to milk that. This is just another example of excessive promotion/distortion around
an IPO. Veeva knew this customer was gone, but felt fine claiming that it still had the

customer throughout the entire quarter which covered its IPO. Then, only when we point
this out after discovering it during honest field research does the company actually come
out and provide the requisite disclosure.


Better questions….


Why did we not get an 8k on the Marketline report that is clearly inaccurately cited by
Veeva in its S-1? Is a 50% overstatement between what the industry report actually states
was life sciences industry revenue and what Veeva attributes it as stating in their S-1
irrelevant?


Why have we not gotten an 8k on the CRM TAM data or broader Veeva TAM data
overstatements?


Why has all the material inaccurate sell-side data which factored into the TAM calculations
in underwriter initiation reports regarding publicly traded Cegedim not been corrected?


Ahh, so many questions, so few answers.


What is one to do?


Well, you can start by reading the recently filed (Jan 2nd) IMS Health (IMS)
prospectus.


In its S-1 it discloses that it has,


"over 10 petabytes of proprietary data sourced from over 100,000 data suppliers
covering over 780,000 data feeds globally, we have one of the largest and most
comprehensive collections of healthcare information in the world, which includes
85% of the world's prescriptions by sales revenue and approximately 400 million
comprehensive, longitudinal anonymous patient records."


Note that IMS Health has been around for 60 years. There is probably not a single
legitimate commercially-focused life sciences company that does not do some sort of
business with them. The same goes for regulators, academic institutions, consultants, and
financial related players in the life sciences industry. The company is effectively the gold
standard in this space when it comes to data.


From the S-1:



http://store.marketline.com/Product/global_pharmaceuticals_biotechnology_life_sci?productid=MLIP0746-0001

5/23/2018 Veeva: 'Back To School' - Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1949081-veeva-back-to-school 3/12


"The average length of our relationships with our top 25 clients is over 25 years and
our retention rate for our top 1,000 clients in 2012 was approximately 99%."


Pretty impressive. wouldn't you say?


Now, they also disclose that they have 5,000 customers worldwide.


Compare this against Veeva, which in their S-1 just a few months earlier disclosed:


"The life sciences industry is one of the largest industries in the world, with over
23,000 life sciences companies of record in 2012."


IMS, which has been around for 60 years and has 85% of the world's prescription data by
sales revenue, has only 5000 customers. Are we supposed to believe that 80% of the
Life Sciences Industry does ZERO business with them?


Our due diligence indicates that is utterly impossible. In fact, it is a near certainty that
anyone who is the least bit reputable in life sciences does some sort of data subscription
business with IMS Health. This means Veeva managed to overstate the size of its
'addressable customer' segment by at least 300%.


And the huge inconsistencies continue when you move on to industry size…


Veeva management has repeatedly stated that life sciences is a $1.6 trillion industry.


We have shown where this glaring data mistake comes from in their S-1, but the
management continues to reiterate this number in every interview we have seen.


Like here, for example.


Veeva's VC investors also have made this statement when trying to highlight that their
vertical market is "huge", except it's not $1.6 trillion in revenue but instead is $1.6 trillion in
IT spending and other expenses.


"The typical scenario on vertical companies is that they are kind of niches they are
small areas. The LS space and healthcare space in general is enormous. Life
Sciences companies alone spend about $1.6 trillion every year on IT and expenses"
- Emergence Capital Co-Founder Gordon Ritter, Bloomberg Interview

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1949081-veeva-back-to-school 4/12


This statement is a bit crazy when you consider global life sciences IT spending is 2.7% of
that number. This statement also implies that the life sciences industry lost somewhere
between $500-$600 billion last year, and operates at a -50% margin. That, obviously, is
not the case. We'd equate such a statement to an NYC hot dog street vendor saying that
the United States produced $15.6 trillion worth of hot dogs and other stuff in 2012 when
questioned about his addressable market. Normally, we'd chalk all this up to a simple TV
interview error, but that is not what is going on here. As we have show over the course of
the past two months, whenever an opportunity arises to make Veeva's vertical market
look bigger than it is, it is seized by all parties who stand to benefit, no matter how
far from the truth it may be.


Now, look at how the leading global data provider to the life sciences industry with 85% of
all global prescription data sizes its market in its prospectus.


From the IMS S-1:


"The life sciences industry is a large and critical part of the global healthcare system,
generating approximately $1 trillion in annual revenue. According to our research,
revenue growth in the life sciences industry globally is expected to accelerate from
2.5% in 2013 to approximately 6% in 2017."


Wouldn't you say a 60% discrepancy between two S-1s that have come out a few
months apart is just a little bit too much to ignore? Are we talking about Tesla Model S
sales here or global pharmaceutical sales? Is $600 billion a rounding error these days?


And speaking of IMS' S-1, has anyone taken a close look at what this company has
been buying over the last year?


We'd like to think so, but our faith in investor due diligence is about as weak as it has ever
been.


Here are IMS' notable acquisitions over the last year:


360 Vantage- Cloud-based multi-channel CRM and CLM SAAS provider built on the
Force.com platform. (Hmm, who else does this?)


Appature- Cloud-based relationship marketing platform.


Semantelli- Social medial analytics company that offers cloud-based tools which automate
the collection of healthcare-specific social media content.

Comments (35)


Vedere Group- Pharmaceutical industry-focused provider of software and services that
help improve sales and marketing performance.


Incential Software- Life sciences-focused SAAS that provides technology and services
that, "integrate incentive compensation, data management and business intelligence
applications for more effective, results-driven sales operations."


Diversinet- Healthcare industry-focused publishing platform provider which supports rapid
deployment of secure and HIPAA-compliant Web-to-mobile applications.


Any clue what they are building here? Can you see where IMS One is heading? Who do
you think makes more sense as a Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) partner down the road,
the company with more proprietary life sciences data than the IRS has financial records or
the one that built an iPAD CRM app? Sorry, we forgot competitive threats are irrelevant
here. This is why not a single Veeva sell-side initiation report mentioned IMS One or
the existence of other life sciences CRM ISV's on the Force.com platform.


Honestly, we are starting to wonder whether or not there is any point to doing real
analytical work or field-level research. If the WFC analyst who put out what is arguably the
worst bottom-up market sizing we have ever seen can say buy the dip without the slightest
mea culpa, let alone a retraction, what is the point? If Pacific Crest can put out a note
saying they are skeptical that Veeva lost the Genentech business without even making a
phone call, and then a few hours later Veeva acknowledges this is in fact the case, why
should we even bother?


Where is the SEC? Where is FINRA? Where have all the hard-hitting investigative
financial journalists gone? Investing in these markets is becoming a total joke.


Disclosure: I am short VEEV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have
no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I find it troubling that the author deleted his comment about genentech after I responded to him asking him if
he thought Roched was a Veeva customer. Here was my comment that he refuses to post:


Do you think the Roche was a Veeva customer? Did you think that Genentech purchased Roche? I am not
sure why you are claiming that Veeva lost Roche as a customer.


My understanding is that Roched acquired Genentech, and like Roche has done with its other acquisitions, it
required Genentech to use the company-wide CRM system. Genentech was forced to switch because it now
is part of Roche. Do you disagree with any of that?


20 Feb 2014, 02:43 PM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We have not deleted anything. Only the administrator can do that. And your statements are
FACTUALLY INACCURATE.


Genentech was on SFDC/ Veeva and Roche Primary care was on siebel pre-merger. After the merger Roche
PC was migrated to sfdc/veeva.


Roche ex North America gradually started replacing multiple vendors globally with sfdc in 2010.


Then last year genentech switched to sfdc custom.


Genentech wasn't forced to do anything. So yes we disagree with all of that. And more importantly you are
missing the key point here. Genentech was veeva's first major big name customer. The fact that for a mere
2000 seats they built their own veeva ontop of sfdc is what you should be focusing on.


20 Feb 2014, 03:33 PM


quadrant8
"Genentech wasn't forced to do anything." Of course Genentech was forced to go with the company-wide
CRM system. Roche owns Genentech in every way possible. Was that not made clear to you in early 2009,
when Roche replaced Art Levinson, Genentech's CEO since 1995, with a Roche guy, Pascal Soriot?


Where do you get this idea that Genentech was calling its own shots?


Roche was not going to pay for multiple CRM systems. They want to standardize on one platform. Why would
they let Genentech be the exception?


20 Feb 2014, 04:09 PM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Other than the fact that we thoroughly researched and confirmed everything?


Well, you could start with the fact that roche switched to genentechs crm system and not vice versa.

"you could start with the fact that roche switched to genentechs crm system and not vice versa"


I disagree since that is not what happened. Roche was using Siebel and did not switch to Veeva. Roche went
from Siebel to SFDC.

quadrant8
"Well, you could start with the fact that roche switched to genentechs crm system and not vice versa."


What? Are you claiming that Roche was using Veeva? That is very far from the truth. Roche has always used
Siebel/StayInFront prior to going with SFDC. I can say with certainty that -- outside of acquiring Genentech,
which used Veeva -- Roche never used Veeva.

Author’s reply »  go find this profile on linkedin.....we don't need to claim anything because roche usa moved
to genentech system after the merger which was a full two years before any sfdc was deployed
globally....which btw is covered by the roche presentation publicly available on slideshare which we linked.

Privately Held; 10,001+ employees; Biotechnology industry

I don't disagree that Roche was rolling out SFDC globally. As with any global CRM rollout, it takes time --
years -- to fully implement, test, validate, etc. a CRM system across a global, multi-billion dollar organization.


It didn't matter what CRM system Genentech was using, it was going to be changed to SFDC as part of a
global rollout.

You might want to understand that veeva/sfdc going to sfdc custom does have a lot to do with the fact that
anyone on veeva is basically using sfdc for their crm. The front end layer that is veeva...building that with
today's sfdc developer ecosystem .....is nothing.

Why dont you answer this question : why would a company be dumb enough to build its whole product offering on
force.com and then watch as salesforce slowly cherry picked its customers?


I dont think theres any coverage of the "heathcare CRM" space going on here . Just a concerted ineffective attempt to
smear a company.

Private Trader, Contributor
IMO, Suhail Capital has made several excellent points. Arguably, you've addressed only one of them.


If this is a smear campaign, I would be surprised for so many contributors to be involved in it. Also, you say
that these articles haven't knocked the stock down. Talmadge, as best I can tell, from December 1st - now, it's
down 8%. For a stock to go down from around 40 to 32/share, during a period of record market highs, is what
I would consider significant. After reading this Suhail Capital's article, it seems like it would be difficult to do,
however, perhaps you could write an article or instablog presenting an argument in favor of VEEV as a value
stock.

Author’s reply »  Because by the time you have all figured that out the handful of people involved would have
already cashed out billions. So it is not dumb. It was in fact a genius shortcut, but shortcuts do come with
longer term consequences. Using salesforce allowed them to go get customers fast and gave them flexibility
to massively undercut competition on price. Meanwhile salesforce gets embedded as defacto platform and in
the process of all these implmentations they get a huge boost to their developer ecosystem. Thats phase 1
for them. Phase 2 is quietly starting.

This article also talks about Cegedim and Salesforce.com, and once again the author fails to disclose his
positions in these companies.


If there is "additional disclosure" as you've stated, can you show me how to find them?

Can you show me a link? For future reference, where is the additional disclosure located? I usually rely on the
one that is stated above the article. I searched the whole article and cannot find the additional disclosure.

The additional disclosure is below the article for the stocks mentioned in the aricle. You can use your own link
to see.

@PSalerno ... Okay, I see the additional disclosure for CRM at the bottom of the CRM article. Thanks for that.


However, I do not see the additional disclosure for CGMJF in the CGMJF article. Do you?

@PSalerno ... Waiting for your answer on my question, " I do not see the additional disclosure for CGMJF in
the CGMJF article. Do you?"


I also responded to Suhail, but my comments have not been published? It's all based on facts. Any guidance
on that?
