SodaStream
(SODA) - Sorry
SodaStream
Traders, Pepsi
ALREADY Has A
Partner
Feb. 7, 2014 1:16 PM ET12 comments | Includes: SodaStreâ€¦


In the wake of Coke's (NYSE:KO) notable endorsement of Green Mountain
(NASDAQ:GMCR) as the in-home vending machine of the future, SodaStream's
stock has jumped by 20% from its after hour lows Tuesday night. As is
typically the case, investors/traders have shot first with the prudent questions
and facts to follow later. This actually includes other short sellers whom we
have a great level of respect for that are simply off the mark believing it is a
fait accompli that Pepsi will partner with SODA. The linear assumption Pepsi
must partner with somebody or risk falling behind in the home soft drink
market is somewhat correct. While we certainly cannot rule out that Pepsi will
partner with SodaStream, we believe anybody that has bought, or promoted,
SODA stock in the last 48 hours has missed a critical fact that we have not
seen in any sellside reports thus far. PEPSICO ALREADY HAS A PARTNER
IN THE HOME BEVERAGE MARKET.


It has come to our attention that Pepsi has quietly partnered with the
European multi-drink in-home company Bevyz.

It is somewhat understandable how investors have missed Pepsi's choice of
partners, Bevyz is after all private and European, a combo that can often fall
off the radar of most stock market speculators. And if you are buying SODA,
you are speculating. The Bevyz dispensers (4 different models in total) provide
cold drinks, hot drinks, as well as still and SPARKLING filtered water. Like the
future Green Mountain Cold system, Bevyz uses a patented packaging
technology that creates a consistent consumer experience. How committed is
Pepsi to Bevyz? They have already made several of their most important
brands available on the Bevyz system, including Pepsi, 7 UP, and Lipton Ice
Tea. We would expect much more visibility into this partnership as Bevyz
begins to commercialize their machines domestically.

We cannot rule out the possibility that Pepsi will partner with more than one
machine manufacturer. It would not seem logical that Pepsi and Coke will
ultimately view in-home dispensers agnostically, the same way they view
vending machines. They would still compete viciously for consumer mindshare,
but the likelihood of consumers having separate dispensers for separate
brands seems completely unreasonable. Green Mountain's CEO, Brian Kelley,
seemed to understand this obvious dilemma and his remarks suggest there is
a high probability Pepsi partners with Green Mountain as well. On its earnings
call from February 5th, Brian Kelley was asked about Coke exclusivity, "So to
me that tells me that they're [Coke] being exclusive to you, but you can sign
on other brands. Is that the right way to think about it?" To this question
Kelley seemed to unequivocally state Pepsi is in the works as well, "It is
[exclusive]. Although, we're going to bring on the best brands. There are
many, many cold brands in North America and in the system. And obviously,
we can't bring on every brand at once. We want to bring on the biggest and
the best brands, and that'll take a little bit of time as we cycle through it. But
what you stated is accurate. And that's the way the platform has worked in
hot. And that's the way the platform will work in cold. And it's because that's
what the consumer wants." As a reminder in hot, Starbucks, Peets, as well as
Dunkin Donuts sell K-Cups for Keurig, despite vicious competition among
brands.


While it appears to us that Green Mountain is aiming to serve all beverage
brands with the vending machine analogy, it would also seem SodaStream has
further removed any possibility of relevance with Coke and Pepsi. SodaStream
has proudly taken every opportunity to incessantly insult and alienate the two
beverage giants. Its own website explicitly antagonizes Coke and Pepsi with
the slogan "Sorry, Coke and Pepsi." This was also a jab that was used in their
unedited Super Bowl add which can be found on YouTube. Really, Scarlet
Johanssen and a Super Bowl commercial? Levying insults and attacking Pepsi's
business model would clearly be an odd way to treat a potential partner.
Finally, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out yesterday in an article titled,
"Secret to homemade Coke: Instant Cold, No Canisters", Coke is adamant that
the key to the home market will be a system that is easy - meaning no
dangerous and clumsy CO2 canisters.

It seems the assumption Pepsi must rush to buy SodaStream is completely
irresponsible given the facts in the market place. It was indeed Pepsi's CEO
herself, Indra Nooyi who called rumors that Pepsi was interested in buying
SodaStream, "completely untrue" the last time this rumor surfaced.


If there is in fact no white knight, not only do SodaStream investors own a
business with aggressive accounting, horrific forensic attributes, waning
machine usage, a depressing Q4 preannouncement, but also now looming
competition from Green Mountain and Coke. As we highlighted on two
separate occasions when SODA was in the mid-50's and mid-60's, we think the
model is in grave danger. With A&P up 41% in Q3 ahead of the Holidays, a big
Q4 disappointment speaks volumes about the ROI on that spend. We believe
SODA is in the unvirtuous cycle of slackening demand that can only be
stimulated by more and more spending, which will have deleterious effects on
profitability. America's growth, once the key to the bull story, has declined
from 88% in 2012 to 65% in 1H'13, and likely under 20% in 2H'13.


Based on the implied Q4'13 guidance and awful sell-through data, investors
must hope any white knight shows up quickly before SodaStream is forced to
share their Q4'13 results, discuss 2014, and file their 20F replete with details
about their acquired distributors. With inventory out of control (43% inventory
growth & DSO's at 86) in the last quarter, and negative cash flow from
operations despite reporting adjusted profits, we believe SODA will be starting
behind the 8-ball in 2014. Even if Pepsi had interest, given their shrewd
reputation and existing bet on Bevyz, it would seem likely they let SODA bleed
for a while - again if there was ever a scintilla of sincere interest in
SodaStream. Whether SODA management actually confesses when discussing
2014 guidance remains to be seen, but there appears to be a two week
window of hope before the proverbial rubber meets the road.


Disclosure: I am short SODA.

amazon, bed bath, best buy and many
more.


Roughly 20% homes in Sweden and
Finland actively use Sodastream, is it
indicitive of something ? , what makes you
so sure other market will not follow ?


pep and ko are ~ 300B$ business,
sodastream does offer healtiher
alternative, is it so crazy to assume they
will have their niche of 2%-3% ? (which
means they have a hugh upside)


Would be great if you could share your
"aggressive accounting" thesis.


All the best.

Bevyz is a plumbed in machine and uses
CO2 bottles. The simple fact that Pepsi or
7-UP would sell syrup to them tells me
they could do this with SODA as well.
Those flavor packs just fit into the machine
and are premeasured like Sodacaps.
Thanks for the heads up!

Please help me figure this out.


While GMCR is x100 times bigger in the
US, more people in the US visit SODA
rather than GMCR website, does it make
sense ?

Oh well, at least the author admits he is
short and shaking in his boots. PEP could
buy several of these vendors to push
multiple platforms for consumers. So could
Coke by the way. 
This game is in the very first inning. Keep
shorting. I think you will find that SODA
will one day grow to a MUCH bigger
company if they remain independent.

Looks like a office type product , that is
very expensive. , not the same market. I
will say this. If yu have kids in your
household or entertain you DO NOT want a
single serve device . You want the
flexibility of bottles. The ease of use per
serving. You cannot compare the
occasional switch of a co2 tank vs ever
time make a cup which takes time. . In
addition all systems open up taste issue. .
The single serve by the amount of water
used per serving. Sodastream by the
amount of carbonation and flavor added. ,
if using soda caps only carbonation can
differ.

If you go to Amazon and look up Bevyz,
you get nothing. If Pepsi is collaborating
with this company, why are Bevyz's
products not available in North America?

I saw the Bevyz commercial unit at the
NAMA show and its pretty cool. it combines
hot, cold and carbonated beverages all
from one machine and the taste was way
better than from other systems which i
tasted.

Welt, Contributor
Unfortunately lovedrinks, unless you have
some sort of evidence, I don't really
believe the fact that Bevyz is going to
launch a home version in the US here
soon. You have 2 comments, your name is
lovedrinks, and your 2 comments are
pretty much the same thing.


If I am wrong I sincerely apologize, but I
am skeptical of your accounts.

i pressed enter by the first comment too
early and do not know how to remove

i have seen pictures of what seems to
be their home machine on the bevyz

They claim to be coming to the US soon
with a home unit. I tasted a Pepsi product
produced with this machine two years ago
while in Italy, and it was quite good.
