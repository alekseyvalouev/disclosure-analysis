American Addiction Centers: Could Be Worse Than Expected, 50%
Downside Possible
Apr. 16, 2015 9:30 AM ET15 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


AAC's business model is entirely reliant on high reimbursement from urine testing,
which is coming under pressure.


The company has told analysts that it is already seeing reimbursement pressure in
California and Florida, but never disclosed that on the call.


AAC's valuation compared to a major competitor and the companies it is acquiring is
vastly out of line.


The largest player in the addiction center field was just acquired at a multiple that
suggests 50% downside for AAC.


Introduction


AAC Holdings (NASDAQ:AAC), also known as American Addiction Centers, was the
subject of my previous article published on March 3rd. Since then, new information has
come to light that warrants a follow-up. In fact, information made known in the defenses
from analysts covering the stock likely makes AAC an even better short now. We now
know how much AAC is getting reimbursed per urine test and what the trends in that
market look like. There is also the case of Avee Laboratories, which worked with former
AAC subsidiary Leading Edge, receiving subpoenas from the US Attorney for the District
of New Jersey, suggesting that this could turn into a legal case and that someone is taking
the allegedly fraudulent drug testing very seriously. AAC has grown even more reliant on
its testing business, and...


...AAC Is Totally Reliant On Drug Testing


AAC is not really an addiction center. Rather, it is a model to get people in the door to test
their urine at very high prices. While management may think they are helping people, the
business reality is that AAC likely does not make any money from treating patients. In
2014, AAC did $133 million in revenue and $11.5 million in operating income, for margins
of 8%. In its defense of AAC, Avondale estimated that 22.5% of AAC's total revenue, or
$29.9 million, comes from testing.

This means that if the margins from AAC's lucrative testing segment were 38%, that
testing would make up all of AAC's operating income, and margins in that segment
are almost certainly way higher than 38%. The test itself is usually no more than a $3
dipstick while some competitors charge between $25-75 for similar tests per
conversations with people in the industry. In fact, one addiction center operator told me
that he would not be able to sleep at night if he charged more than $75 for a urine test.


What Is AAC Charging For Urine Tests (And How Much Is It Getting Paid)?


Before delving into the new information about AAC's urine drug test reimbursement rates,
here's a review on the practice. From the original article:


In order to understand how fraudulent drug testing works, it is important to
understand the two fraudulent components. First, there is Point of Care Testing
(POCT). This is the testing provided in a clinician's office and is typically performed
with an inexpensive (less than $50) test. The fraud in POCT testing is simply the fact
that clinicians a) test too often and b) bill out this cheap testing to insurance
companies at prices as high as $1,200. The profitability on unnecessary testing is
massive.


The second component to understand is the "confirmatory testing." In the event that
a test registers a negative result, clinicians can then send the test on to a central lab
for a "confirmatory test", which is then billed to the insurance company at a price of
$1,000-$2,000. The fraud here occurs when clinicians automatically send the tests in
for expensive confirmatory tests, even when it is not merited. In this way, the firm
can bill as much as $3,200 for a single urine test (combined POCT and confirmatory
tests). In fact, this business is so lucrative that AAC has now even opened its own
lab in Tennessee, so that it can capture all of the profits from unnecessary
confirmatory tests.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3074686-american-addiction-centers-could-be-worse-than-expected-50-percent-downside-possible 3/13


Before Avondale's defense, it would have been impossible to estimate how much AAC is
getting reimbursed from insurance companies per test. Thanks to its defense, however,
we can now make an estimate of AAC's reimbursement rates on its urine tests. Here is the
math.


AAC's average daily revenue (ADR) is $920. The average stay is 28 days; it means that
AAC is generating about $25,760 per patient. 22.5% of $25,760 is around $5,800, which
means that AAC generates around $5,800 from testing each patient over a 26-day stay.
Each of the analyst reports suggested that AAC tests 4-9 times per month. If AAC is
testing patients on the low end of that spectrum, then it is charging about $1,345 per test
($5,382/4).


So clearly AAC generates much higher margins than just 38% from its testing business. It
is clear that without its lucrative testing practices, AAC would likely not be generating an
operating income at all. Even with its lucrative and potentially fraudulent testing practices,
AAC only generates 8% margins from the whole business.


Given how tremendously important testing is to its business, one might expect AAC to
provide clear disclosure into the margins of this segment and be transparent about its
reimbursement trends, but instead AAC is as opaque as possible when it comes to
disclosing what is going on in its testing segment. It should be noted that it is not an official
segment of the business since that would require AAC to break out margins. All of these
numbers are estimates from the filings as well as Avondale's defense.


Drug Testing Pricing, It's Coming Down!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3074686-american-addiction-centers-could-be-worse-than-expected-50-percent-downside-possible 4/13


Given the extreme reliance of the company's business model on how willing insurance
companies are willing to reimburse AAC at the levels that it is currently charging what was
disclosed about the company's recent guidance in the defenses was perhaps the most
alarming aspect of the various defenses from analysts.


Raymond James writes:


"We believe the company's recently-issued 2015 initial guidance assumes that
payors will pressure lab revenues, especially on point-of-care testing, though
management has noted that it is not seeing pressure except in California and
Florida."


This is huge news. AAC is already seeing pricing pressure in POCT tests in two of
its main markets, California and Florida. It is safe to say that drug testing is by far
AAC's highest-margin segment and it is seeing pricing pressure, yet management
has never disclosed this publicly.


The report goes on to say:


"In short, we believe the risk of pressure on test "frequency" is low, but the risk of
pressure on test "rate" is a legitimate risk and one that is factored into guidance."


Avondale writes:


"While almost a quarter of AAC's revenue is generated from lab, we do not believe
that there is much risk to overall lab revenue based on pricing. Management has
indicated on several occasions that point of care test pricing would be
pressured, but would be offset by a higher penetration of high complexity lab tests,
which carry better pricing. In November 2014, AAC obtained the Florida license for
quantitative tests and is expected to get licenses for California and Rhode Island in
2H 2015. Plans are in place to obtain licensure in NJ, where AAC will have future
operations. To conclude, we expect lab revenue to increase as total revenue from
additional growth in beds increases despite pressure on POC pricing."

"We believe the potential risk to AAC related to lab testing utilization, while present,
is not a major issue. The more pertinent lab-related risk, in our view, is
reimbursement rate pressure on the lab segment; however, we do not believe
this is a lab-specific risk, given the company's status as an out-of-network provider.
We also believe that management's guidance and most Street estimates
account for lower lab reimbursement rates in 2015."


Was this included in guidance? Maybe. But this is the first time that AAC is mentioning it.
AAC did not mention this once on its call, and the analysts only mentioned it after the
previous article came out. The risk of reimbursement rates coming down merited a
mention in AAC's "Risk Factors" in its 10-K, so why is AAC not publicly disclosing that it is
already seeing pricing pressure in key markets?


Again, why has AAC not disclosed that there is a risk of pricing pressure on tests? These
analyst defenses are the first that investors have heard of this. There was absolutely no
mention of this on either of its quarterly calls. Apparently, AAC didn't see fit to let investors
know that reduced pricing was included in its guidance.


We can already see the result of the lower reimbursement rates, at least in California.
Revenue from California actually had declined year over year, as revenue from Blue Cross
Blue Shield California has declined $.2 million year over year, suggesting possible
pushback from the insurers already.

AAC is clearly already seeing reimbursement pressure in key markets, so why did it rely
on analysts to convey this and why was it not disclosed during the conference call? The
analysts write as if everyone was aware that the guidance included reimbursement

pressure, but this is clearly not the case.


Valuation: What's The Secret Sauce?


In addition to having numerous business issues outlined in the previous article as well as
above, AAC trades at a shocking premium. AAC trades at 78x 2014 earnings and 18x
EV/EBITDA.


While this is a clearly elevated valuation compared to the market, the valuation gap
between AAC's beds and the value of the beds of companies it is acquiring is a more
interesting discrepancy.


Since going public, AAC has acquired five locations, paying between $2 million and $22.5
million for these facilities.


Source: AAC press releases


While AAC did not disclose the bed count on the CSRI acquisition, it was only $2 million.
For the other acquisitions, AAC paid on average $180,952 per bed for its acquisitions. As
it currently stands, AAC is valued at $1,119,643 per bed.


AAC has to be doing something dramatically different than the previous owners for the
market to allow this type of value discrepancy to exist. While some of it might be due to
better operations or creating a national brand, the answer likely lies in AAC's drug testing
practices.


Wall Street encourages this kind of valuation arbitrage to exist in a roll-up, but in AAC's
case, it likely would not be possible without its testing practices, which, as I have shown
previously, are beginning to come under pressure.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3074686-american-addiction-centers-could-be-worse-than-expected-50-percent-downside-possible 7/13


If AAC is really following industry standards like Raymond James claims, then why is AAC
valued at over $1 million per bed while the companies it is acquiring are valued below
$200K per bed. This discrepancy would not exist unless AAC was doing something
radically different with those beds.


AAC could be doing a "better" or more aggressive job of marketing than the smaller
companies it is rolling up. AAC has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau, and most
of the complaints are about misleading advertising and billing issues.


Analysts covering AAC are quick to note that it is the only pure play in this sector. While
that is correct, we can draw some comparisons to CRC to get a clue on the valuation.


In a deal completed in February of this year, Acadia Healthcare (NASDAQ:ACHC) paid
$1.3 billion for CRC. CRC is a leading provider of treatment services related to substance
abuse and other addiction and behavioral disorders. CRC operated 35 inpatient facilities
with over 2,400 and 81 comprehensive treatment centers in 30 states. From this 8-K, we
know that CRC did $340 million in revenue over the first nine months of 2014, up 10%
year over year. An annual run-rate of $453 million in revenue, which is 3.4 times more
than AAC's, and $80.5 million in operating income.


This means that ACHC paid 2.9x sales and 16x operating income for a more
geographically diverse, larger addiction center. CRC has private and Medicare exposure,
which isn't as much of a pure play as AAC, but it is a more stable revenue base. AAC is
projected to grow 31% this year, and operating income estimates are around $21 million,
which means AAC is trading at 33x forward operating income.


This means that the largest player in the addiction center space was just bought for half of
AAC's current valuation, giving AAC the benefit of the doubt on projected future growth. If
AAC was acquired tomorrow at the same multiple of CRC, it would be trading at
around $16/share, 50% lower.


Is There A Legal Case Brewing?


From the original article, AAC has been sued by Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. To
refresh:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3074686-american-addiction-centers-could-be-worse-than-expected-50-percent-downside-possible 8/13


AAC is currently the subject of this exact type of fraud lawsuit. Horizon Blue Cross
Blue Shield of New Jersey vs. Avee Laboratories et al., alleges that the defendants
submitted unnecessary and fraudulent drug tests. One of AAC's subsidiaries,
Leading Edge, was named as a defendant. The case claims that the defendants
began causing others to submit "false and fraudulent claims for unnecessary and
ineligible POCT and confirmatory tests." Leading Edge was a relatively small
addiction center in New Jersey, which was opened by Treatment Solutions (more on
that shortly).


According to the lawsuit, despite its tiny size, Leading Edge fraudulently billed Blue
Cross Blue Shield over $6 million in fraudulent claims for urine tests. The suit goes
on, saying,


"As a result of this scheme, healthcare providers, including Leading Edge Recovery
Center and Laurie Deerfield, rendered unnecessary [point-of-care tests]. Despite
repeated negative results and the absence of any clinical reason to believe that the
results were inaccurate, healthcare providers requested Avee to perform
unnecessary confirmatory tests on the same urine samples."


This lawsuit by itself is serious, especially since Blue Cross Blue Shield companies
reimburse over 40% of AAC's commercial payor revenue. However, something disclosed
in Alere's (NYSE:ALR) 10-K is perhaps even more alarming. Alere acquired Avee, the lab
company working with Leading Edge. From the 10-K:


We are not a party to any other pending legal proceedings that we currently believe
could have a material adverse impact on our business. However, on December 10,
2014, we and our subsidiary, Avee Laboratories Inc., or Avee, received
subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey
seeking marketing materials and other documents relating primarily to billing
and marketing practices related to toxicology testing. We are cooperating with
the investigation and have begun to provide documents responsive to the
subpoenas. Our subsidiary, Arriva Medical, LLC, or Arriva, is also in the process of
responding to a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, from the United States Attorney
for the Middle District of Tennessee in connection with an investigation of possible
improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid.

While it's possible that AAC and Leading Edge would not be implicated here, it does show
that someone is taking insurance fraud and excessive testing very seriously and that the
Leading Edge case could potentially turn into a legal case.


I contacted AAC IR about whether or not AAC and/or Leading Edge had received
subpoenas, but did not receive a response.


Summary And Conclusion


I would like to take this opportunity to challenge AAC to disclose the dollar and margin
breakdown for its testing business. It seems clear that this segment makes up all of its
operating income, and if it truly has nothing to hide, then why not disclose this segment
information?


Here's a summary of some of the issues with AAC:


Originally was an OTC reverse merger that quit filing financials.
Forterus, AAC's predecessor, was featured in a report that highlighted four deaths at
its addiction facilities.
This Forterus clinic had its license revoked after the fourth death occurred.
AAC is being sued by Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey for actions related to
Leading Edge's allegedly fraudulent drug testing.
Estimates suggest that AAC charges for tests at a level that has been found to be
fraudulent in the past.
A company founded by the wives of the CEO and President manage AAC's revenue
collection business, and the company lowered its allowance for doubtful accounts after
this acquisition, boosting earnings for the IPO.
AAC used proceeds from the IPO to settle a lawsuit against the company.
AAC subsidiary FitRx CEO Ralph E. Carson claims to have a PhD from Auburn, but
records show he also claimed a degree from Donsbach University, a non-accredited
university that operated through the mail.
The former CEO of AAC's Greenhouse has a degree from Century University, which is
a non-accredited degree mill.

Comments (15)


Given the numerous issues highlighted here and in the previous article, AAC
should at least consider being transparent in the testing aspect of its business, as it
is essentially what its entire ability to make money is based on.


Note: I have contacted investor relations about whether or not AAC or Leading Edge has
received a subpoena and have not received a response. I am short shares of AAC.

frequency.

this is fraud though and we have always turned them down. I know many companies that are making
TONS$$$ of money doing this though. Its very frustrating! I think that most states are cutting back heavily on
this practice because its costing them so much. AAC has obviously found a way to do this legally and I am
sure they wouldn't have continued this practice without legal opinions after going public. The amount they are
receiving will probably go down over the next few years but they just need to find a way to make up for that
lost income through acquisitions.

The reason that CRC has higher margins than AAC is due to the fact that CRC owns the largest group of MMT clinics
in the US ( the world I think?) The profit margins for MMT/OTP's are anywhere from 30-40%. The SEC fillings reveal
that Methadone is by far the most profitable segment of CRC's now far flung addiction treatment business. From 2003
to 2005, CRC grew its Methadone operations by about 130 percent, with annual opiate revenues reaching almost
$84M, which equaled 40 percent of CRC's total sales in 2005. During 2005 CRC saw operating profits from their
Methadone segment soar by 240 percent suggesting that CRC has been able to bring substantial economy of scale
efficiencies to the business. CRC has their MMT clinics averaging 428 clients each, twice the industry norm. The

profitability of CRC's Methadone business far outstrips that of its residential segment, with operating margins from the
opiate division reaching 37 percent in 2005 vs the 26 percent operating margins registered by its residential
treatment. AAC currently has zero business in MMT/OTP's and this is why I feel the margins are so different. I think
that AAC is going to have to step into this side of the business in the near future due the profitability of the segment
and publics and governments increased acceptance of Medicated Assisted Treatment. It isnt the taboo business that
it used to be in the past. Also insurance companies are looking for proven cheaper outcomes with shorter stays. It
only costs a patient around $4,680 to $5,200 per year to complete a full years worth of therapy on Methadone or
Buprenorphine. I am sure when AAC enters this niche market they will do it in a big way. It is a highly fragmented
market with many tiny mom and pop players ready to be acquired. Most MMT/OTP's have almost zero marketing
costs also and operate with "Waiting Lists" compared to the highly competitive residential business that requires
enormous marketing costs!
