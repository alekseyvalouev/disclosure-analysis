The Market Is Misunderstanding Lumber Liquidators' Announcement
May 7, 2015 2:08 PM ET63 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Lumber Liquidators announced three pieces of news this morning that are being
misinterpreted by the market as positive developments, but they’re not.


What we have witnessed in the past 67 days has, I believe, been a frantic attempt to
engineer a massive cover-up - and today’s announcement means that this has
failed.


The company needs to immediately take a number of steps to do right by customers.


I view the stock's rise today as a gift, so I materially increased my short position this
morning.


Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) announced three pieces of news this morning: a) that it's
suspending sales of its Chinese-made laminate flooring; b) that 97% of the initial tests it
commissioned of the air in customers' homes show formaldehyde levels below the limit set
by the World Health Organization; and c) that it hired the firm run by former FBI Director
Louis J. Freeh "to serve as an independent compliance advisor to the company."


These announcements are being misinterpreted by the market as positive developments,
but they're not. In fact, we may look back upon this day as a decisive point in the eventual
collapse of Lumber Liquidators.


Let's review each piece of news in turn.


Suspending Sales Of Chinese-Made Laminate


In the 60 Minutes story that aired on March 1st, the board and senior management of
Lumber Liquidators were confronted with overwhelming evidence that their Chinese-made
laminate didn't comply with CARB standards and was emitting a dangerous level of
formaldehyde, a known carcinogen that was likely causing serious adverse health effects
among a significant percentage of people exposed to it, especially children. As one father
emailed me recently:

I just wanted to thank you for your work on Lumber Liquidators. My wife and I put the
St James Vintners Reserve (a Chinese-made laminate) in our house back in May
2013. We have a 7-month-old who had basically been sick his whole life with all the
symptoms caused by formaldehyde poisoning (asthma, rashes, upper resp.
infections, daily breathing treatments, constant wheezing) and we (including the
pediatricians, who were trying everything) for the longest time could not figure out
what was wrong with him until we saw the airing of 60 Minutes. We got our things
and got out of our house while we could figure out what steps to do next. During the
time out of the house (little over a month) my son started almost immediately doing
better as did my wife, me and our little girl.


Yet, rather than taking the obvious step of immediately suspending sales of the product in
question, they, shockingly, did the opposite, slashing prices to dump this toxic product as
quickly as possible on unsuspecting customers, all the while assuring them that:


…our laminate products, all of our products, are 100% safe.


These attacks are driven by a small group of short-selling investors who are working
together for the sole purpose of making money by lowering our stock price. They are
using any means to try and scare our customers with inaccurate allegations. Their
motives and methods are wrong and we will fight these false attacks on all fronts.


In addition, Chairman and founder Tom Sullivan went on national television saying that "60
Minutes did a great job of scaring people, making up this story."


This is one of the most immoral and reckless decisions I have ever seen a company
make, which led me to conclude that Lumber Liquidators Is Evil.


Halting sales now - after selling thousands of American families tens of millions of dollars
of toxic flooring in the 67 days since the 60 Minutes story aired - is too little, too late, as
the damage has already been done.


Importantly, it also likely means that Lumber Liquidators is under immense pressure from
regulators, who will, I expect, take decisive action to rein in and punish this rogue
company. I simply don't believe Lumber Liquidators would halt sales of its own volition,
given that it must now write off ~$13 million of inventory and be out of stock on some of
this high-margin product for many months, which will seriously impact results for the

second and third quarters. (One source tells me that the decision to halt sales was made
by the board, over management's objections, which, if true, means that perhaps they kept
the board in the dark about their nefarious actions.)


Lumber Liquidators certainly tried to sell all the Chinese-made laminate it could right up
until the stores closed yesterday, according to a friend of mine who sent me this email
earlier today:


What's amazing is I had heard hints of this and have been calling stores this week. I
spoke with three stores in Florida and all three told me I could buy the (Chinese-
made laminate) product on Tuesday or Wednesday, but had to pick it up by
Wednesday night. So, they were actively selling it while knowing that they were
going to pull it. That's a dream for a class action attorney...


If my supposition is correct that a regulator has contacted Lumber Liquidators and is about
to take action (my best guess would be CARB, whose results will, of course, show that
virtually every sample fails its standard and that the average sample is 6-7 times the
standard), then this is very bad news for the company and increases the odds that this
stock eventually goes to zero (perhaps from 20% to 40%).


Making things even worse for the senior executives of Lumber Liquidators, I'm 99%
certain (for reasons outlined in my article, Did Lumber Liquidators Know It Was Selling
Toxic Laminate?) that they knew that they were sourcing non-CARB-compliant laminate in
China. They were not deceived by the Chinese mills; rather, the mills did just as Lumber
Liquidators instructed.


Why would they knowingly poison their own customers? The oldest reason in the book:
greed. Laminate is one of the company's largest and most profitable product lines (prior to
the 60 Minutes story, Chinese-made laminate was ~14% of the company's $1 billion in
annual sales), and non-CARB-compliant laminate is ~10% cheaper, so the company
saved a lot of money on sourcing costs. I think illegally cutting corners on sourcing (both
for this product and others) was a significant contributor to a quick doubling of margins,
which in turn helped drive the stock up eight-fold from $15 to $119 in less than two years.
The top two executives, Chairman Tom Sullivan and CEO Robert Lynch, recognized a
golden opportunity when they saw it, dumping $37 million worth of stock at prices more
than double today's level in early- to mid- 2013.


Initial Test Results

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3154666-the-market-is-misunderstanding-lumber-liquidators-announcement 4/21


In its announcement this morning, Lumber Liquidators disclosed:


Initial Indoor Air Quality Testing Program Results


Initial results of the indoor air quality testing program for certain laminate flooring
customers - conducted by independent, accredited laboratories - indicate that over
97% of customers' homes were within the protective guidelines established by the
World Health Organization for formaldehyde levels in indoor air…


… While various groups have recommended higher or lower levels, there is currently
no national standard for recommended indoor home air concentrations in the United
States. The company has used the guideline established by the World Health
Organization, which is an international consensus standard that draws on recent
research and the expertise of the many governments, academic institutions and
researchers that have studied formaldehyde emissions.


Phew, we can all breathe a big sigh of relief, right? WRONG! These results are
meaningless for three reasons:


First, the testing program, according to expert testimony, is "the cheapest possible way to
test," "cannot be considered valid" and "will likely provide some consumers with poor data
that give them a false sense of security," as I detail in my article, Lumber Liquidators' Offer
to Do Indoor Air Quality Testing Appears to Be A Sham. In short, Lumber Liquidators has
rigged the testing program to show the results it seeks.


Second, for many customers, the formaldehyde will have off-gassed - a process that can
take anywhere from a few months to a year or two. Thus, even if the testing program was
rigorous and legitimate, it would show low levels of formaldehyde in the air of most
customers' homes (I'd guess pretty much all of them who'd installed their flooring more
than a year ago). But that doesn't mean that they weren't being poisoned to a significant
degree in the first year or so after the flooring was installed. And it certainly doesn't mean
that the Chinese-made laminate that Lumber Liquidators is selling right now is safe - in
fact, all of the evidence indicates that it's not.


Lastly, the WHO standard of 81 ppb that Lumber Liquidators chose is for "30-minute
average concentration," which is not the appropriate standard for flooring in one's home,
where babies and children might be playing/crawling on the floor for many hours every
day. As I discussed in my article, More On Lumber Liquidators And Formaldehyde, four
different regulators have set limits for homes ranging from 7-33 ppb.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3154666-the-market-is-misunderstanding-lumber-liquidators-announcement 5/21


Here are questions Lumber Liquidators needs to answer:


1) Why isn't Lumber Liquidators offering customers a professional test conducted by an
Industrial Hygienist or other accredited technician?


2) If a homeowner pays for a professional test themselves, will Lumber Liquidators honor
the results?


3) What are the results broken down by how recently the flooring has been installed?
What's the average formaldehyde level for flooring installed in the past month, 3, 6, 12, 18
and 24-plus months?


4) What were the exact results: how many were below 10 ppb, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, 50-
75, 75-100, 100-200, and 200+?


5) Why does Lumber Liquidators think the WHO standard, which is only for "30-minute
average concentration," is appropriate for homes? Why is the company ignoring standards
for the home set by CARB, FEMA, NIOSH and the California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment?


6) For customers with formaldehyde levels exceeding the WHO threshold, Lumber
Liquidators makes only a vague promise to "take additional steps that may include further
in-home air testing and testing of floor samples from the customer." Why does the
company think customers will be satisfied with this lame offer? Why doesn't it offer to
immediately replace the flooring or pay for removal and give a full refund?


Hiring Louis Freeh


I'm delighted that Lumber Liquidators has hired the firm run by former FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh "to serve as an independent compliance advisor to the company," as this makes it
even more likely that the truth will come out - and that truth, I believe, will be damning: that
senior executives of Lumber Liquidators knowingly sourced non-CARB compliant laminate
in China, thereby poisoning their customers, in order to save ~10% on sourcing costs.


If I'm right, then what we have witnessed in the past 67 days has been a frantic attempt to
engineer a massive cover-up -- and today's announcement means that this has failed. If
so, then founder and chairman Tom Sullivan, CEO Robert Lynch and Senior Vice
President, Chief Compliance and Sustainability Officer Ray Cotton (and perhaps others)
should be fired, and appropriate regulators should investigate them and, if warranted,
bring civil and criminal charges.

Next Steps


Since the 60 Minutes story aired, Lumber Liquidators has consistently done the wrong
thing at every turn. If it wants to break this dismal streak and start behaving like an honest
and reputable company, it needs to take a number of steps:


1) Offer a full refund to any customers who want to return Chinese-made laminate that's
already been delivered but not yet been installed.


2) Rather than waiting for inbound calls and complaints, Lumber Liquidators should send a
letter to every customer who has purchased its Chinese-made laminate flooring in the
past, say, five years, informing them that the product may be emitting dangerous levels of
formaldehyde and offering to send someone to their home to conduct a proper test (not
the sham testing that the company is currently offering).


3) For any customers with a reading above 0.016 parts per million (16 ppb), the standard
set by both FEMA and NIOSH (I'm being generous - 7 ppb is the limit set by the California
Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment), offer to pay all costs for them, if they
wish, to temporarily move out of their home until the flooring can be removed and replaced
with safe flooring, at Lumber Liquidators' cost (even if the customer chooses carpeting or
wood flooring bought from another company). Also, for these customers, offer to pay all
medical bills for anyone in the home suffering symptoms consistent with formaldehyde
exposure.


Conclusion


The stock should be down 20% on this announcement. The fact that the market is totally
misunderstanding what's going on here and driven the stock up is a gift that I will gladly
take, so I materially increased my short position this morning.

LL actually came down to less than $25 in pre-market this morning, but then it went back up and all the way to more
than $29. I don't know what is going on, but if Tilson and Seeking Alpha are shorting the stock, I am out.

Whitney,


Big fan of your work and theses. Curious as to what your horizon is on LL?


Best, 
Owen


My reply:


I think CARB will release its findings within a month or two. The CPSC will take maybe six months. All the class action
lawsuits will take years. And who knows when evidence will emerge that LL’s senior management knew exactly what
they were buying in China.


The uncertainty around the timing is one reason why I’m simply short the stock, rather than trying to get cute with
options. And I’m only paying a 5% annualized cost of borrow.


Best,


Whitney

Mr Tilson. If I recall correctly in CNBC it was mentioned you had about a mere 1-2% short equity position, but since
then I have continued to read and hear about your short position, and changes to it, without actually being able to
grasp its actual or approximate size or magnitude. So the one thing that I think is missing is a bit more transparency
on your history with trading this stock...

Could you please provide details about the relative weight of this short equity position within your portfolio, and how
this compares to your typical weight of your short positions?


What is the size of the LL equity short (you could reference it by approximation or within a range), how did this weight
change today (or if you would how has it changed since you started the short, and after the main different catalysts
like the 60Minutes report, the Company's business update announcement, its earnings call, and today's
announcement where you claim to have materially increased your short)? ...obviously any information should openly
distinguish between the actual equity position and any additional options exposure


This disclosure would add significant value to your own transparency, and for the understanding of the rest of us
regarding how big this idea, and what yopur level of conviction in it, really is.

Whatever LL's Corporate Decree on what the formaldehyde standard is, is irrelevant. The Standard is established by
the CA Legislature and CA EPA. The CARB 2 Standard is .05ppm or 50 ppb. LL marketed that their products met
CARB 2 Standards. They either do or dont. Chances of the CA EPA reducing a carcinogen standard to satisfy one
comercial enterprise are about the same as Gov. Jerry Brown denouncing Global Warming.

out. Logical and rational people are playing the odds, which is what active investors do. I'm in the camp that
LL will come out of this ok and believe there is value to be extracted from the long side.


Most people replying to Tilson are spotting holes in his argument due to his extreme hubris and selective
information distribution. His tactics are walking the line of legality and is pandering to the people who will
subscribe to his diatribes without question.


In the end, LL will probably get fined to some degree, but they are not going bankrupt. Tilson on the other
hand should be looking over his shoulder for Mr. Bharara. With all the articles full of half truths that Tilson has

fact did add value because other people posted comments/replies in opposition to my thoughts. When people
debate their differences we gain knowledge through understanding.


In the previous article, I was commenting on the situation as it pertains to LL and laminate testing. In this

Either LL or Tilson are wrong and guilty of defrauding the public. I owned the stock and have to flooring as well so I
have a lot of skin in the game. I sold the stock at a big loss and went short this morning because it appears LL is the
defrauding party. For my sake I hope they aren't since I will be left with tainted flooring and have to decide do I rip it
out. One party is guilty of fraud and should be punished by our legal system once this all shakes out.

well
as always another good article- but im not surprised the market is always irrational 
full of manipulating bag holders(cantor,wedbush, and others) trying to recoup value to amateur gamblers thinking its
cheap, and clueless analysts 
the damage has already been done ..ll's reputation is done, sales with take a huge hit, and the lawsuits will eat a hole
in the bottom line.. in the long term there is a great drop from here .. this is only round 1..


on a positive this pop just made puts cheap..  
piling on another 600k short position ..... and adding more puts.... 
the announcement just confirms that LL dug its own grave....

Probably all this story is just a "bear raid" to buy the company cheaply in future. I think suspending sales of its
Chinese-made laminate flooring is good news because they remove the reason to continue sell off. "Chinese-made
laminate was ~14% of the company's $1 billion in annual sales" -even if they stop selling that  laminate - will
company go bankrupt? I think no because it will have 86% of sales left. But current price valuations is like market
thinks total sales of LL laminate is 86% of company sales.

Reemax, 
I wish I did, I could have saved a lot of trouble for the company. But sorry to disappoint you, the answer to both of your
questions is no. It is sad that SEC does not get involved here because this is stock manipulations at its worst. This
must not a big enough fish for the SEC.

These are just PR moves, and in that regard they will be positive for LL. The American public associates Chinese
products with being unsafe and poorly regulated. It's all about perception.


In reality, it is pretty clear that there was no violation by LL. 60 Minutes used the wrong test method. LL is 100%
CARB-compliant and they always have been - that is why CARB has not taken any regulatory actions against them.
And neither have any other US agencies.


BTW, as an investor: it's fine if you short LL for your own reasons, just don't put too much faith in a tv show. TV shows
are for entertainment, not for any real scientific or financial analysis. 60 Minutes has been wrong many times before -
and they are wrong again on LL.

This is not factually correct. I explain in my video, why the testing method used by 60 Minutes is correct and
LL has mislabeled their goods as CARB phase 2 compliant when they are not:

Actually, it is factually correct. I will not watch your 26 minute video, but feel free to explain your argument
here.


I have read the CARB regulation, and I know that 60 Minutes did not use the correct ASTM which is
described in the regulation.


If you want to test for compliance, you need to use the method described in the regulation pertaining to
formaldehyde limits. Using other methods is incorrect.

Deepfryer,


Good luck with that portfolio if that's your way of thinking. Trust me, LL committed many violations and they got
caught. It's just a matter of time before they go down. LL claim that 97% of their air quality tests came back compliant.
And that's a good thing??? So it's ok for 3% of the population to be exposed to a dangerous toxin?? Unless you work
for LL or have family that work there, it makes no sense to me why anyone would defend this terrible company.

Alabama, Florida, Nevada, and so on.


Wouldn't your outrage be more effectively used in forcing the other states to adopt California's environmental
requirements?


09 May 2015, 12:28 PM


Deepfryer999
Sorry my friend, but you do not understand how these things work. None of these results are non-compliant
with any existing laws or regulations. If you disagree, then please explain what the "violations" are, and what
specific rules they violated.


Secondly, almost 100% of the population is already exposed to this "toxin" on a daily basis. Formaldehyde
occurs naturally in apples and many other fruits and vegetables. So it is important to understand the issue
before before saying that 3% of the population was "exposed" to a chemical that they were already exposed
to anyway.


If you think this 3% was exposed to a dangerous level, then why do you feel that way? How much emissions
are given off by other company's installed flooring? Are other companies going to be higher or lower, if you
measure them using the same test kits that LL sent out?


What do you consider to be a safe level of formaldehyde?


You need some data & education if you are going to start making these types of alarmist statements.


10 May 2015, 06:34 PM


KnowYourFacts1st
Allow me to educate you on something extremely simple and information that is accessible to you in various
manners. If you knew anything about this, you'd know that formaldehyde is in countless things in people's
homes... cabinets, linens, new furniture, makeup, SMOKING...you can realize that that 3% most likely is
come from something else in their home... such as the above.


13 May 2015, 04:37 PM


reemax
Point is...why risk it? No need to take additional risks when there are other options. Do you really believe LL's
Chinese made laminate flooring is as safe as all the others? I don't. I firmly believe, because of greed, LL cut corners
and didn't follow the rules. To save a few dollars and drive up their profits they purchased and sold flooring with higher
levels of formaldehyde. Obviously they didn't think they would get caught, but they did. Is it making people sick?? The
jury's still out. All I know is, it's cheaper to manufacture flooring with higher levels formaldehyde and that's why they
purchased it. I don't want flooring with higher levels of toxins in my house and no one else does either. I also know
there are rules and regulations you must follow in the flooring business. When you put the CARB sticker on the box, it
better be CARB compliant. Deliberately mislabeling your product is a major violation. Doesn't matter if California is the
only state who enforces these rules and regs. Also doesn't matter if we are already exposed to formaldehyde anyway.
You guys are missing the point. Did Pete Rose bet on baseball? Yes. He's still banned from baseball for life because

he broke the "golden rule". He did the one thing you can't do and he's paying the price. One could argue the players
who used PHD's committed a far worse violation, yet they still are allowed to play and are still involved in the game.
What's LL have to do with Pete Rose and baseball??? Nothing other than I believe, LL committed the one violation
they couldn't commit. There are enough risks out there to worry about without having to worry about the safety of your
flooring. Still can't figure out why people want to defend this company? I guess some people genuinely like to argue a
point. If I say the sky is blue today, some people will argue and take the opposite side. Good luck to all. I went short
long ago and I've seen or read nothing that has changed my mind. Bad choices made by a bad company. Still has a
long way to drop.

Robin Hewitt, Contributor
"California is the only state who enforces these rules and regs"


It's not that California is the only one enforcing limits on formaldehyde from laminates. No other state in the
union has limits on formaldehyde from laminates. There's nothing to enforce, because there are no rules.


10 May 2015, 09:53 PM


Deepfryer999
This is an almost incomprehensible, hysteria-filled post.


You mention that no one wants to buy laminate with higher levels of formaldehyde. Ok, fair point. But there is
no reason to believe that LL has higher levels, because no one has compared them to any other companies.
Understand? So it doesn't make any sense to talk about "higher levels" until you have compared them to
other suppliers of laminate.


They didn't violate CARB, they are 100% CARB compliant and always have been. 60 Mins used the wrong
test. Why didn't they just apply a little common sense and use CARB's test method? That's what I'd like to
know.


In the end, I hope that 60 Minutes will have to pay for any damage to LL's stock and their reputation. Once
again they have used sloppy journalism, and as a result the public is jumping to all sorts of unfounded
conclusions.

What is the correct CARB's test method? I can't find any other but only one CARB test method.


13 May 2015, 09:05 AM


Robin Hewitt, Contributor
"What is the correct CARB's test method?"


Under CARB Phase 2 rules, labs are required to use two test methods to evaluate formaldehyde emissions of
composite woods. They are further required to show that the two methods correlate -- in other words that they
don't contradict one another -- as an extra precaution.


These two test methods are ASTM E 1333-96(2002) (large  
chamber test method) and ASTM D 6007-02 (small chamber test method). In both methods, the product is
placed in a chamber and brought to equilibrium. Air levels of formaldehyde are measured at equilibrium.


The large-chamber test method very specifically says that the sample is to be presented in its sealed form --
i.e., you're NOT to expose the core, because that would give readings that are too high. In the small chamber
method, samples need to be small enough to fit in the small chamber, which is about the size of a large
microwave oven. Flooring tiles are the right size. The intent of both methods does clearly appear to be NON-
DESTRUCTIVE testing.


There are some additional options that labs can use (see the regs for details).


After reading these materials, I agree that 60-minutes looks very suspicious here. They appear to have
created the appearance of a problem by distorting the intent of the law and abusing the test protocols.

We agree with this author. The company needs to make this right with consumers and hardwood floor professionals
all over America. After 25 years in the industry we have seen many up's and down's but situations like this hurt
everyone. It is highly unethical and compromises the health and stability of an entire industry. People purchase
hardwood flooring for its health benefits, specifically those that suffer from allergies are trying to improve their quality

t is curious that MaxVision and Whitney Tilson both wrote articles on the same day citing: 1) time limitations to sell
Chinese laminate and 2) inside info on LL's inventory.


How did Max Vision and Tilson gain confidential information re: LL's inventory status?

" The plaintiff attorneys will drool over the implications that management and even store level employees knew that
Chinese laminates would be pulled Wednesday night, but were still actively selling them on Monday and Tuesday
even while knowing this. "


^^^^^^^^MAX VISION NOTES THAT CHINESE LAMINATE WILL BE PULLED WED NIGHT.


" And finally, sales are going to take an even more serious hit on this news because Lumber Liquidators does not
have adequate stock of European or U.S. laminate to replace the Chinese laminate that they are removing from the
shelves. For example, just two months ago, LL had 33 SKUs of 12mm laminates. This count is down to 16 SKUs,

made up almost entirely of their Dream Home brand. Their competitive advantage of having more stock than the big
box stores will be non-existent this summer. In some regions, laminate sales (for example Florida and Texas) make up
between 30%-40% of store level sales. These stores will suffer dramatically in the near term without adequate levels
of laminate products."

"Importantly, it also likely means that Lumber Liquidators is under immense pressure from regulators, who will, I
expect, take decisive action to rein in and punish this rogue company. I simply don't believe Lumber Liquidators would
halt sales of its own volition, given that it must now write off ~$13 million of inventory and be out of stock on some of
this high-margin product for many months, which will seriously impact results for the second and third quarters. (One
source tells me that the decision to halt sales was made by the board, over management's objections, which, if true,
means that perhaps they kept the board in the dark about their nefarious actions.)"


" Lumber Liquidators certainly tried to sell all the Chinese-made laminate it could right up until the stores closed
yesterday, ACCORDING TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO SENT ME THIS EMAIL EARLIER TODAY.


^^^^^^^ MR. TILSON WRITES ABOUT THE WED DEADLINE (TO SELL CHINESE LAMINATE FLOORING) AND
STATES THAT THIS INFO WAS EMAILED BY A "FRIEND".


"What's amazing is I had heard hints of this and have been calling stores this week. I spoke with three stores in
Florida and all three told me I could buy the (Chinese-made laminate) product on Tuesday or Wednesday, but had to
pick it up by Wednesday night. So, they were actively selling it while knowing that they were going to pull it. That's a
dream for a class action attorney"


^^^^^^^ TILSON'S "FRIEND" EMAILS THAT HE WAS CONTACTING STORES AND MENTIONS "FLORIDA" - MAX
VISION WROTE EARLIER SAME DAY THAT HE WAS CONTACTING STORES IN FLORIDA AND TEXAS. 
----------------------...


go back and reread both articles. I found it quite a coincidence that two articles, written by different authors (on the
same day) would address the very SAME points.


Mr Tilson mentioning that a "friend" emailed him the SAME info shared by Max Vision on the SAME day, leads me to
believe that it is Max Vision who contacted Mr. Tilson - OR - they are both sharing the SAME mole inside LL - OR - it's
also possible that Mr. Tilson plagiarized Max Vision.

The national limit set in 2010, which congress does not seem to remember, is 90ppb. That is 10 points higher than the
maximum number found in the 3% that needs further investigation. 
I will remind you again, OSHA sets the limit for folks that work with formaldehyde for 8 hours a day at 750 ppb. That is
about 9 times higher than what congress has set for home levels. All the workers should have asthma, and lung
cancer by now if this was that toxic.  
It is sad that many of these folks do not give smoking a cigarette a thought and expose themselves to over 6000ppb
of formaldehyde but complain about 30-40 ppb from their flooring. This is not about reality but about law suits.

According to this information http://bit.ly/1PGDlzQ CARB “has stated that they are in the process of developing a FAQ
that addresses the misrepresentation of the data used in the 60 Minutes segment, how CARB will interpret the data,
and the proper use of the Standard Operating Procedure.”


Hopefully they post the FAQ soon and this will make it easier to understand all this and the CARB position on the
issue

Startup123, thanks for the link.


I was surprised to find that the CARB standard was apparently being misrepresented. That seems egregious
to me.


I've since started looking at SA profiles of the most outspoken posters expressing outrage or concern. What I
discovered is that these accounts were created in mid or late March and that they're only used for
commenting negatively on LL. They appear to have no interest except stirring up negative sentiment against
LL.


Usually I'm terribly reluctant to embrace conspiracy-style explanations but this is looking more and more like a
co-ordinated misinformation campaign to bring down LL.

I think the truth is not far from coming out. I just hope SEC gets a clue and incorporate rules that unjust rumors (good

than yelling fire in a crowded room. People do not ask questions and run. Many will get hurt and that is actually a
