Linn Energy: that did not work so well
From the original 8-K which triggered this series of posts: 


Fact #1 – LINN is confident in the validity and accuracy of its audited financial
statements.


Drolly I note that for 2012, the company reported net loss of $387 million, or $1.92 per unit. For the
quarter the loss was $187 million. (Source here.) Obviously a good part of this loss was write-downs
from writing off oil and gas properties that became less valuable as gas prices fell. 
 
However there should be an offsetting write-up in the value of the hedges so that defense will get only
so far. 
 
Whatever: unusually for a stock I write about in Linn's case I (mostly) believe in the validity of the
accounts. The accounts say quite bluntly that 
 
(a). This is a loss making enterprise. 
(b). That this business pays out large and increasing distributions despite those losses and 
(c). The business raises ever increasing amounts of funds using ever-more-novel ways of doing it. 
 
To me that looked like a Ponzi scheme on its last legs. Indeed to come to a different conclusion I
thought you had to accept some non-standard non-GAAP measures as reality. In other words you
have to ignore the audited bottom line for the company. 
 
Many people it seems do ignore the bottom line. They are encouraged by the management - and they
might be right - but for the moment I have (and retain) a different opinion. 
 
But I was wrong 
 
Despite not changing my opinion on the fundamentals of Linn I will confess to being wrong on one
important (nay critical) point. 
 
When Linn launched Linco (their non-MLP associate which exists only to hold interests in Linn) I
thought the money-raising was on its last legs. Specifically I thought that rather than target the non-
sophisticated mom-and-pop investors who buy MLPs they were being forced to target more
sophisticated investors as they had run the non-sophisticates out of money. 
 
I thought LinnCo meant Linn was on its last legs. 
 
I was wrong. Spectacularly (and unprofitably) wrong. 
 
Yesterday (as many will have noticed) Linn used Linco stock as a currency to buy a C-Corp - a very
big acquisition - their biggest to date. 
 
I did not see it coming. It was not even on my original list of risks in the position. Wrong! 
 
This is a great deal for Linn. They get to swap what I believe to be near-worthless stock for some old -
but still valuable oil assets. Those assets will generate cash - cash that can keep this whole thing
rolling along for a few more years. 
 
So even if I am right that Linn is a Ponzi (and many company supporters disagree with me) it is not a
Ponzi that will collapse next week. And so my opportunity to profit will not be next week. 
 
I covered most of my short. 
 
For a loss.

PS. The company now has some time to prove that it is not a Ponzi. Substantial GAAP profits might
be a start - but hey - ten more years of distributions would also be effective.

I always assumed one of the main goals of creating clearly overvalued stock [via Ponzi,
fraud, or other] was to acquire real assets before you got discovered.

If you live and work in MLP land, LINN looks a little more normal. E&P and pipeline MLPS
are going to report basically no income for years to come, while piling up and depreciating
more and more assets. The cash flow is real. The runway is pretty long. There are
probably a trillion dollars worth of assets to buy out there and more to build. Who knows
really. It's a big number. 
 
At some point the gravy train has to end, but it's hard to know which shoe will drop. Credit
markets? Disruption in energy markets? Regulatory change? And when will it happen?  
 
Until things go south, the value proposition to the individual investor/yield zombie, is
pretty huge, just because of tazes. You basically pay no taxes on that yield for 10 years.
And if you roll some of your income over, you can avoid taxes almost indefinitely. If you
are elderly you can bequeath them to a spouse, roll over the basis, and he/she pays no
taxes for another ten years.  
 
I totally agree that it's a bubble. But it's a bubble with stronger economic foundations that
most. The fracking revolution is real. At some point the music will stop, but I suspect it
won't be for a while. They are in a pretty big sweet spot....

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Linn Energy: that did not work so well


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2013/02/linn-energy-that-did-not-work-so-well.html 3/8


" This is a loss making enterprise." 
 
I have to disagree with you here. LINE generates a profit in almost every year it has been
a public company. It's not that much, nevertheless, it is not a loss for most years. 
 
For 2012, there are 277 million in unrealized losses on derivatives used in hedging. That
has to be added back to the reported GAAP Net Loss to get a more reliable number. The
fair value of the hedges has lost value, but the other side of the hedging transaction is
that the if the hedges lose value, the hedged item, which is the oil/gas reserves,
increases in value. But GAAP keeps the reported value of the oil/gas reserves at
historical cost, not the fair value.  
 
So, only one side of the change in fair values is reported. That creates a material
distortion in Net Income/Loss on a GAAP basis. The asset impairment is in addition to
this. So, the GAAP Net Loss is wayyyyyy off the economic reality. Check this out with a
CPA with experience with hedge accounting. You owe your audience that much. What
you are saying about a loss making enterprise simply is not based on facts. 
 
The asset impairment, as you say, is due to the decrease in NG prices. I view that as
temporary, though GAAP will not allow a write-up if prices should recover back to
previous levels.  
 
GAAP has serious problems that need to be addressed, and hopefully they will be in the
next few years. AT present, financials with serious distortions due to hedging transactions
get approval by the auditing firm. Sad, very sad. Having been an accountant, the
profession is destroying its own credibility with such nonsense. With a company like LINE,
you cannot accept the GAAP audited financials as creditable. They aren't.  
 
I don't see the MLP model, like LINE, as a good model. Too much debt, not that much
profit. It could be a house of cards. But, as long as oil and gas prices generally increase
over time, the reserves will be worth more and more. That adds value to the company
which GAAP does not recognize.

John, 
Thanks for posting you opinions regardless of whether they turn out right or wrong. 
 
A quick question. Why do you feel individuals who buy MLPs are getting ripped off? 
I haven't invested in one yet, but I think the tax advantages mediate much of the risk. 
If you put in 100k and are in a thirty percent tax bracket that 100k only cost you 70k
because of the 100% first year write off. If the MLP was only able to return your
investment (the 100, no dividends etc, nothing else) you have almost a 43% return. If that
takes five years it's 8.6% annualized and all the MLP has done is return the 100K. 
Curious about what you and your readers think about this. Am I missing something?

John, 
Why do you feel individual investors are getting ripped off by MLP's? 
 
Supposedly there is 100% write off of your investment the first year. 
If you are in a 30% tax bracket putting in 100k costs you only 70K 
If the MLP only returns the investment and nothing else you have almost a 43% return? If
it takes five years and is annualized that's still over 8.5%. 
Am I getting this wrong? I have assumed it is these tax advantages that supports the
industry.

The link below explains the different accounting under SFAS 133, depending on if a
derivative is designated a hedge or not. LINE does not designate its hedging activities as
hedges, so "Case 3: speculative or derivative not designated", in the link, is where LINE's
hedging would fall. 
 
Note in that example, that while an $800,000 loss in fair value of the NG futures contract
was recognized in September, that the corresponding $1,000,000 increase in fair value of
the inventory was not. Only one side of the economic reality was recognized.

That is what I am saying about the $277 million unrealized loss for LINE for 2012. The
other side of the coin, the increase in fair value of the reserves is not reflected.  
 
In the end, when the NG sale takes place and the derivative contract is settled, the
interim period gains/losses is irrelevant.

I wonder if there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the price Linn pays for their puts.
One normally thinks of puts as American style options where you are paying for the right
to put the asset AT ANY TIME prior to expiration. In this case the price of the put is equal
to the exercise price minus current price plus time premium. Linn's puts AREN'T
American style, they're European style. In the European case you can only put the asset
AT EXPIRATION. Thus the purchase price of the put equals the exercise price minus
THE MARKET'S EXPECTED PRICE OF THE ASSET ON THE EXPIRATION DATE plus
some premium related to the probability that this future expected price is correct. So let's
take a simple example. Linn wants to hedge nat gas 5 years out at $5/mcf. The current
price is $2.50/mcf. If it were an American style put the cost would be $5 - 2.50 + time
premium. However because Line puts are European style and, for example, the future
expected price of nat gas in 5 years is $4.50/mcf the cost of the put is $5 - 4.50 + risk
premium. This is why Linn can accurately say they aren't buying deep in the money puts.
In the above example their puts are only $.50 in the money. 
 
I think a lot of the confusion about Linn has been by people who are used to dealing with
stock options. Stock options are almost always American style so this is what people are
used to. But if you deal with options on the VIX, for instance, they are European style. I
believe that if John had understood the difference he never would have shorted the stock.

John, 
 
For full disclosure, everyone should feel free to view me as biased in favor of the MLP
space. I have no desire to get into any adversarial low brow type of discussion (which
sometimes happens from “Anonymous” commenters) but have no problem having an
intelligent discussion with anyone who has a directly opposite view because I believe that
avoiding confirmation bias helps make better investors. 
 
In one of your earlier posts you had the following question: 
 
“They also own gas swaps (i.e. forwards) which are a long way out of the money. Do they
also budget cost for buying those? I would like to know.” 
 
An oil and gas producer entering into a hypothetical 5 year oil or natural gas swap can
enter into the trade with a counterparty and it will initially cost it zero dollars out the door.
The swap is priced by the counterparty using the forward futures price curve at the time

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Linn Energy: that did not work so well

average monthly futures price for calendar year 2019 is around $5.06). 
 
How does the counterparty make any money?  
 
They offer the price to the producer after taking some profit for themselves, so if the
forward curve shows a 5 year average price of $92 per barrel then they could offer the
swap to LINE at say $91.50. The counterparty trading desk can then layoff that exposure
to lock in the $0.50 profit per barrel (this is a high profit number by the way) times the total
number of barrels hedged.  
 
What about mark-to-market exposure to the counterparty, how do they get comfortable? 
 
If the oil and gas producer has a Secured Revolving Credit Facility you will typically find
all of the producer’s hedging counterparties to also have exposure to the company in the
Revolver (i.e. they are also a secured lender to the company). This situation then means
that when the forward curve shifts higher compared to the swap price (making the
company have a non-cash mark-to-market loss) the producer will not have to post any
collateral to the hedge provider (LINE explains this on page 53 of their 2011 10-K,
Counterparty Credit Risk
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/LINE/2324302444x7165155xS1326428-13-
7/1326428/filing.pdf). The hedge provider is comfortable because they have a secured
claim against the oil and gas reserves (i.e. they already have a collateral position) that
have now increased in market value based on the increased forward commodity price
curve. 
 
To Ponzi or Not to Ponzi 
 
In a big picture sense do you view all 90+ U.S. Master Limited Partnerships as “Ponzi
schemes” or is your thesis primarily for the upstream/oil and gas producing MLPs
because they have producing assets with a decline curve? I’ve often kicked around the
idea of shorting Royalty Trusts as a hedge for Upstream MLP exposure due to the finite
lives of Royalty Trusts and their inability to directly add to their assets but just haven’t
gotten around to the full analysis yet. 
 
Also as a side note, if you look at all of the wells in the United States on average and
compare that to all of the wells in say Saudi Arabia you might come to the conclusion that
on average the entire United States has “really clapped out assets.” 
 
Cheers, 
Phil

I'm not a supporter of the stock. If you are referring to my explanation of why GAAP is
wrong as "bogus" then I would challenge you or any CPA to counter it. 
 
KPMG says the same thing I have in their short explanation of derivatives and hedge
accounting in link below. It seem obvious to me that GAAP is wrong in this instance. 
 
"The accounting for derivative instruments at fair value creates a common issue for
organizations that hedge risks using such instruments. Specifically, such organizations
may face an accounting mismatch between the derivative instrument which is measured
at fair value, and the underlying exposure being hedged, as typically underlying
exposures are recognized assets or liabilities that are accounted for 
on a cost or an amortized cost basis, or future transactions that have yet to be
recognized. This

accounting mismatch results in volatility in the financial statements as there is no offset to
the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument."  
 
http://www.rfpconnect.com/Content/userfiles/hedge-accounting-kpmg-
whitepaper1%281%29_612.pdf 
 
 
The fact is that in most cases, when a company like LINE uses derivatives as cash flow
hedges, but does not "designate" them as such, the reported unrealized gains/losses of
these derivatives, which are included in Earnings, never materialize. They simply create
volatility in a company's Earnings, creating irrelevant and unreliable information before
the hedges are settled. The link explaining the hedge accounting is a good example of
this. 
 
Bottom line, the NG hedge allowed BestGas, Inc. to realize $1.8 million more in revenues
than without the hedge, the difference between the futures price at the beginning, versus
the end when the contract is settled. If the hedge is used as a cash flow hedge but is not
"designated" as such, the reported changes in fair value of the contract before settlement
simply create volatility in the earnings numbers. As can be seen from this example, these
changes in fair value were materially different than what BestGas Inc. realized upon
settlement of the contract. Therefore, as a cash flow hedge, to have such changes in fair
value reported in Earnings materially distorts the Earnings prior to the settlement of the
contract.  
 
IMO, LINE's changes in fair value of the derivatives would be better reported in OCI than
earnings because they are using the hedges for cash flow purposes, even though they
are not "designating" them as such.  
 
The GAAP numbers are not reliable, IMO.

As I see it, one very important aspect of LINE which keeps it a going concern is the
underlying value of the assets it acquires. We're talking about oil/gas reserves. Over time,
that value tends to increase, not decrease. GAAP fails to recognize this. However, the
economic reality of this trend is that LINE's Net assets tend to increase in value over time
not only from Earnings, but also from this general increase in value of the reserves.
Failing to recognize that will result in miscalculating LINE's actual Net Worth and ability to
continue its operations, IMO.  
 
The increase in value of reserves adds to its Net Assets, just as Earnings does.

This is like deja vu. I had the exact same analysis and the exact same braindead
arguments with the bulls on Kinder Morgan. Fraudulent accounting plus big divvy plus
acquisitions with overpriced currency = short trap.

bjroberson's situation looks like a good example of getting it wrong as far as the
accounting goes. 
 
Let's look at BestGas, Inc., in the link I provided, again. 
 
Let's say that instead of the futures contract price being $3.39 in December, that it
remained at $3.52, the same as September. Also, that the Chicago spot price in
December remained at September's price of $3.55. 
 
So, in September the Futures contract purchased to guarantee a $3.48 delivery price, has
dropped in value by 4 cents or by $800,000. So, you would write down your futures

contract by $800,000. Since it had no value when you purchased it, it is now a liability on
your books, something you will have to pay out if prices don't change by December. You
would also charge Other Comprehensive Income (meaning reduce) with $800,000. So,
your equity section of the Balance Sheet is showing $800,000 less in equity in
September. 
 
If these prices remain the same through December, then you can sell your NG for $3.55
per unit or for $71,000,000. But, then you have to settle the futures contract which
requires you to pay $800,000. So, the net result is that your profit is $10,200,000. You are
fine with that because the hedge is simply to protect your cash flows. The bottom line is,
you wanted to sell your NG for at least $3.48 to yield $69,600,000 in revenues and a
$9,600,000 profit. You did better than that by $600,000. 
 
Even though the loss in value of the hedge caused a reduction in Equity prior to
settlement. Once the transaction was consummated and you sold your NG, the hedge
and the hedged item offset one another so that the cash flows and profit are close to what
you desired at the start.  
 
So, the $1.4 billion Other Comprehensive Loss for KMP in the 2nd qtr of 2008 was
irrelevant, as was the $800,000 OCL in the above example. What is overlooked in both
these examples is that the fair value of the hedged item, what is to be sold in the future,
also increases in value and offsets the loss on the hedge.  
 
In the end both Best Gas and KMP were able to sell their product and receive what they
desired from the transactions. This is not fraudulent accounting, but a lack of
understanding of how the accounting works, i.e not able to see the Big Picture and the
end result.

bjroberson said...


Don, I agree with you about the KMP accounting. The OCL accounting is not what I was
talking about, and is in fact irrelevant. I provided the McDep link just to show that the
short case on MLPs has been around for a long time, and has burned many sophisticated
investors. In fact, I would say that KM didn't have fraudulent accounting, it had misleading
accounting. I don't want to get into the short case against KM, and this is not my blog, but
you can read about it at the McDep links.


February 26, 2013 at 11:11 PM


Don Petty said...


bjroberson, 
 
I'm no expert on MLPs or their accounting. But, the accounting for the cash flow hedges I
think I do understand. 
 
YOu said or seemed to imply to me that KMP was selling their product at $50 per barrel
when the market price was $98. What would keep them from settling the hedge for $50
per barrel, not selling the oil, taking that loss, then selling it on the market for $98?
Something similar to what I just described takes place doesn't it? In the end they achieve
what they wanted, a stable cash flow for their sales with no significant losses. 
 
I'm simply asking a question, nothing more.
