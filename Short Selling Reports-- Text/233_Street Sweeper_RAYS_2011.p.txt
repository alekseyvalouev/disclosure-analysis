RAYS Of Sunshine, Or Clouds Of Doom?
Dec. 9, 2011 8:00 AM ET15 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Raystream (RAYS.OB) recently began lighting up the skies of Pennyland by proclaiming
that it had developed a new video-compression technology that outshines anything on the
market today. In reality, however, Raystream appears to be selling open-source software -
available at no charge - to anyone who wishes to use it. That software, known as "x264,"
can be downloaded here for free.


Raystream burst into the spotlight with the help of an aggressive promotional campaign
financed by an outfit known as Unlimited Trade, which also furnished startup money for
the company. In a striking coincidence, covered in more detail below, Raystream and
Unlimited Trade share a common link with a once-famous - but now-fallen - German
Wunderkind named Tan Siekmann.


When Raystream began trading under its current symbol this fall, the company issued a
press release introducing the public to its video compression software. At the time,
Raystream CEO Brian Peterson proudly declared that the company's "disruptive
technology could forever alter the way business is done online." The announcement
further explained that this "proprietary" technology "could reduce the bandwidth required
to stream HD video online by up to 70%."


The next day, Raystream revised that figure to "up to 90%" and revealed that - thanks to a
generous infusion from Unlimited Trade - the company now had almost $2 million in cash
on hand. Raystream and its promoters spent the weeks that followed celebrating the
importance of this technology, boldly predicting that it was likely to unleash a torrent of
demand.


So who, exactly, is the genius responsible for this magical breakthrough? The CEO runs a
Dallas signage company known as Peterson-Hines and, upon joining Raystream, brought
most of his staff from that firm (who worked as salespeople) along with him. Only
Raystream Chief Information Officer Roman Rumpf and his sidekick Thomas Friedl, who
heads the company's German subsidiary, appear to have any real technology experience.


More importantly, just how "proprietary" is Raystream's video-compression technology?
Not at all, it appears. On its website, Raystream invites the public to view a slick video that
illustrates the technology's capabilities. While no technology publication has reviewed - or

even discussed - the Raystream software, a few techies took an interest in it and then
took a close look at that video as well.


With little effort, they made a remarkable discovery. They found that the Raystream source
code begins like this: x264 - core 112 - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - Copyleft 2003-2010.


In a nutshell, that code reveals that Raystream "created" its technology using x264 - an
open-source video-compression encoder based on the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - that
serves as the industry standard. Comically enough, Raystream never even bothered to
change any of the default parameters included in that sequence.


Jason Garret-Glaser, one of the developers behind x264, told TheStreetSweeper that
Raystream could have better concealed its secret by simply removing the header that
included the telling "x264" within it. Thanks to that oversight, however, that four-digit
introductory code jumps out as the first thing that anyone who examines the code will see.


Garret-Glaser offered two more important observations as well. For starters, he said, any
company that distributes x264 as part of its commercial proprietary software without
purchasing an appropriate license from x264 LLC has violated copyright infringement
rules. It remains unclear whether Raystream itself has complied with those mandatory
guidelines.


Secondly, Garret-Glaser indicated, Raystream has touted a compression rate that - even
when boosted toward 90% - falls well short of that recorded by others in the field.


"Modern video compression can achieve 100 to 1,000 times compression over raw video,
or "99.9%," he said. "For example, raw 1080p RGB is 1.5 gigabits per second, but can be
compressed to 3-6 megabits at relatively reasonable quality."


Perhaps Raystream has recognized that its technology looks vulnerable. On its website,
the company offers a "free trial" that supposedly allows users to experiment with its
powerful software. TheStreetSweeper signed up for the free trial two weeks ago, however,
and has yet to receive that promised service. Another visitor apparently ran into the same
dead end and then called the company to complain.


"A girl just told me that the trial version is not ready and may be ready in a week," that
curious shopper reported on an Internet message board. "I asked if it had ever worked,
and she said, 'No.'"

TheStreetSweeper called Raystream seeking comments for this story. It sent a detailed
email to the CEO as well. So far, however, it has yet to receive any feedback from those
inquiries.


Shell Game


Like so many penny-stock names, Raystream went public through a reverse merger with
an existing shell company.


That company, originally known as Interdom (ITRD), was going nowhere before it changed
hands. Incorporated in Nevada two years ago, records show, Interdom had total revenue
of just $200 - and a mere $45 in the bank - when its founder Igor Rumianstev, a Florida
real estate agent, decided to sell his controlling stake in the company. While Interdom had
managed to secure a listing on the OTC Bulletin Board ahead of its sale, the stock had yet
to begin trading at that time.


On June 14, two months after Interdom landed its spot on the penny-stock exchange,
Rumiantsev sold his 83.8% stake in the company to Unlimited Trade for $200,000 and
walked away from the firm. At that point, Roman Rumpf briefly took over as the sole officer
of the company. Although Peterson technically replaced him as the top executive about
four weeks later, Rump stayed on as the CIO and continues to hold down that position to
this day.


Earlier this year, Rumpf helped launch a German technology company that carries the
Raystream name. He began serving as the "general manager of Raystream GmbH" in
March of 2011, official records state, somehow assuming that post four months before the
company even surfaced as a registered business. Like its American parent, Raystream
GmbH - a company co-founded by Rumpf and Thomas Friedli - specializes in video-
compression technology.


Raystream issued 20 million shares of stock, or roughly 40% of its shares outstanding, in
exchange for the German subsidiary that gave the company its name. It issued another 5
million shares to Unlimited Trade in exchange for $2 million to fund its operations.


A Panamanian company, Unlimited Trade shares two of its officers - Francela Ivonne
Findlay Silva and Orlando Zamet Reyes Salda√±a - with another mysterious outfit based in
that same country. Those officers double as officers at Gekko Industries, the same
Panamanian firm that financed a notorious stock promotion for Lithium Exploration (OTC:
LEXG.OB) earlier this year.

Like Gekko Industries before it, Unlimited Trade spared no expense on its big penny-stock
campaign. Although it has spent millions promoting Raystream, however, Unlimited Trade
has obviously skimped on its rent. As this video shows, the firm operates from a building
in Panama City - with no elevators or even electricity - that looks like an outright dump.


Fallen King


Before Rumpf and Friedli joined forces to establish the German technology firm that would
soon give Raystream its name, they both crossed paths with a notorious entrepreneur
who saw his fortunes swing by amazing extremes.


Back in the 1990s, a young Tan Siekmann found himself basking in glory - hyped by many
as a German Bill Gates - after taking his company, Biodata AG, public during the dot-com
boom. Like many technology stocks, however, Biodata soon collapsed during the dot-com
bust that followed. Biodata filed for bankruptcy in 2001, with documentary filmmaker later
creating an award-winning film about the dramatic rise and fall of the once-celebrated
leader of the company.


The year after that, Siekmann hit another new low. A German prosecutor filed charges
against him for allegedly engaging in fraud and violating insider- trading laws.


Still ambitious, Siekmann kept trying to repeat his early success. He created a new
company, known as Safe-Comand hired none other than Rumpf to help him. While now
dormant, Safe-Com lists Rumpf on its domain registration to this day.


In 2006, Safe-Com entered into a joint venture with a U.S. company now known as
BodyTel Scientific (OTC:BDYT.PK). Like Raystream, BodyTel touted a remarkable
invention. The stock crashed in 2008, however, plummeting from $3.50 to 70 cents a
share in less than a week. It fetched mere pennies a few months later and continues to
trade on the lowly Pink Sheets through the present date.


Meanwhile, in 2009, Siekmann launched yet another company. He founded an outfit
known as eLogic, which markets a magic algorithm designed to perform FOREX (foreign
exchange currency) trading, with Friedli stepping forward as his partner this time around.


All of those companies - as well as Raystream GmbH - list the same fancy German
address. They share office space at Burg Lichtenfels, a picturesque medieval castle
owned by the fallen tech wizard who founded the firms.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/312867-rays-of-sunshine-or-clouds-of-doom 5/9


When Rumpf and Friedli incorporated Raystream GmbH in March, Siekmann showed up
as a representative for a related company - Unlimited Trade - housed in much shabbier
quarters. As noted above, Unlimited Trade owns 5 million shares of Raystream and paid
millions for a promotional campaign designed to increase the value of those shares.


The promotion began with an over-the-top piece by "Elliott Dobbs" of Stock Market
Authority that appeared a few days after Raystream began trading. Dobbs enthusiastically
declared that the company offered "a revolutionary technology that's ready to create a
monopoly" and then offered more of the same in a "report" posted on a different website:
"Its technology can't be matched by the competition," he marveled, "and it can't be
reverse-engineered, which provides a significant barrier to entry."


According to x264 developer Garret-Glaser, however, any software can in fact be reverse-
engineered.


Dobbs proudly reminded investors that he had introduced them to LEXG earlier this year,
while declaring that Raystream "has every bit as much potential for gains of 1,000% or
more." Fueled by a multimillion-dollar publicity campaign, LEXG indeed skyrocketed from
12 cents to $10 a share - a rare feat for any stock in the microcap arena - but soon lost
most of those rapid-fire gains and now trades for less than $1 a share.


Since then, Raystream has rallied with the help of a seven-figure stock promotion of its
own. Stock Market Authority received $150,000 for touting Raystream, an official
disclaimer reveals, with Unlimited Trade covering that handsome fee (through an
intermediary) under a $3.25 million promotional campaign that ranks among the biggest of
the year.


Smart Market Authority published its original bullish Raystream call on smathority.com. A
few days ago, however, GoDaddy suspended that domain registration for "spam and
abuse." Stock Market Authority continues to promote Raystream through two other
domains in the meantime, both of those registered with an outfit known as NameCheap
instead.


The Stock Detective, another LEXG promoter, followed Smart Market Authority as the next
website to embrace Raystream and heartily tout its shares. In a bold move, The Stock
Detective listed "the 10 companies most likely to acquire Raystream" - beginning with
YouTube (Google) and Netflix (a company that well knows how to download and use
open-source software if it ever wishes to do so) - and set a price target for the stock at $10
a share.

Comments (15)


"Call your broker now!" The Stock Detective urged. "We believe that, as video quickly
dominates the Internet, this could translate into a valuation for RAYS of several billion
dollars."


That bullish report remains live, found on a domain registered by Agora Multimedia -
another outfit connected to the LEXG campaign - and hosted by NameCheap as well.


Since than, SuperStockHunter - yet another LEXG promoter - has joined that group of
paid cheerleaders by urging investors to snatch up shares of Raystream before "the Wall
Street insiders realize the opportunity" and take advantage of it themselves. Notably, both
SuperStockHunter and The Stock Detective use the same disclaimer found in the original
Stock Market Authority report.


With 5 million shares of Raystream, Unlimited Trader - the backer of that expensive
publicity campaign - arguably ranks as a clear insider of the company. It could attract
some unwanted attention from regulators as a result, since the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission recently launched a formal investigation of Jammin Java
(OTC:JAMN.OB) in an effort to determine whether any insiders participated in the
aggressive promotion that fueled a powerful - but fleeting - rally in that company's shares.


Raystream boasts a lofty market value of $89 million in the meantime, even though the
company had generated a mere $200 in revenue - under its original owner - when it
reported its most recent financial results. Despite the overblown rhetoric delivered by the
promoters paid to tout its shares, however, Raystream has so far yet to approach the
remarkable highs achieved by LEXG (before its crash) earlier this year. Nevertheless, on
paper at least, a few key insiders have clearly struck it rich.


Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this article, TheStreetSweeper (through its
members) established a short position in Raystream with the intention of profiting on
future declines in the stock price. Since Nov. 15, TheStreetSweeper has shorted a total of
20,000 shares of RAYS short at an average price of $1.38 a share. Due to a "forced buy-
in," TheStreetSweeper covered 3,950 of those shares at $2.07 a share before this article
appeared. As a matter of policy, TheStreetSweeper prohibits members of its editorial team
from taking financial positions in the companies they cover.

I have been following this shell from the start and all you indicate above is what I have observed. I haven't invested
one cent into this game. Myself and my close associates kept asking the question just how can you compress so
much data into the same time & space using a magical formula without loss of quality or time slicing time at a faster
rate. No magic bullet here. Great story.


Thanks

Looks like I got burned again! Luckily only a few hundred bucks, but still, it would be nice to find a winner once in a
while. Of course, these guys are short the stock, so that creates a bit of doubt, but the story seems well researched.
And it's true, the link to the trial download is broken. Oh well, maybe time to go short...

I am 75 years old and happen to trade my IRA, therefore cannot short. On 12/10/11 I lost $510.00 on RAYS. Overall, I
have lost $1,846.00. Can't afford this as I am on S.S. and my investments with Ameriprise have dwindled due to the
economy. I don't know whether to sell RAYS now at $1.17 or hope for a rally. Bummer!


10 Dec 2011, 01:49 PM


bionic1
If you lost $510 on 12/10/11 ( a Saturday???)maybe you shouldn't be trading at all..I hope you have a lot
invested in solid dividend paying co.s If you can't afford these type losses you shouldn't be gambling on
stocks like this which should only be owned if you can AFFORD to LOSE your whole investment without it
impacting your life!!!

Sell your stock and don't hope for a rally. Invest the money you scavenge from RAYS into AAPL or DFS. You could
also invest in ZYNG it's going public in a few days and could fly upwards.

Scavenge your money from RAYS because it's too risky and don't hope for a rally. Instead, invest what you have left
into stocks like AAPL or DFS. You could also invest in ZYNG; it will go public in a few days and is likely to soar.

The main people behind RAYSTREAM and LEXG are very good at starting companies with one main contrived
gimmick that gets heavily and skillfully touted and then the stock gets heavily and skillfully promoted and then they
very heavily and skillfully take their stock profits and move on to forming their next elaborate pump-and-dump
creation.

Bought $55k worth of RAYSTREAM on the morning of the Monday that it lost over 40% of its value. If I had waited till
the next morning, I could have bought it at or near $1.02 and made a good profit and have been out of it by the end of
that week or sooner. I should have sold for a loss a long time ago, but I remained blindly optimistic about their
chances. I never bought stock before and wanted to make my inheritance from my late father grow. That Super Stock
Hunter publication really fooled me! The dumbest thing I ever did.

They should be arrested and tried for fraud. They got me also for a cpl hundred, but it was as learning experience as I
was just starting to invest when I bought Rays.ob. I have since gotten into Mutual Funds and have spent many nights
researching before I invest. Lesson well learned. I f I evevr see the name Raystream anywhere on the a billboard I'll
