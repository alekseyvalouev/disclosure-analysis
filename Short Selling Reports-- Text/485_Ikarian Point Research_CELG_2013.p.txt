Celgene And The Chronic Disease Fund: The Next Domino To Fall?
Dec. 11, 2013 12:08 PM ET23 comments
by: Ikarian Point Research


In October we posted an article on Seeking Alpha detailing some apparently shady
dealings between the Chronic Disease Fund (CDF) and Questcor Pharmaceuticals
(QCOR). A week later, on its Q3 earnings call, QCOR announced that the, 'USAO [US
Attorney's Office] for the Southern District of New York and the Los Angeles Office of the
Securities and Exchange Commission are also participating in the ongoing investigation
by the USAO in Philadelphia,' which has been investigating the promotional practices of
QCOR since September 2012. This is no simple matter as another regulatory body, the
SEC, has begun investigating QCOR and is working in conjunction with the US Attorney
for the Southern District of New York, which, unlike the SEC pursues criminal proceedings.
The timing may be a coincidence - or not.


Banigan's Gone


Another event which occurred in the last few weeks and which we find very unlikely to be
a coincidence is that the Founder, Chairman and President of the Chronic Disease Fund,
Michael Banigan, has stepped down from his post at the CDF. Michael Banigan is no
longer on the Leadership page nor is he the Chairman or a Trustee of the Board. Even the
'Our Founders' Story' discussing Michael Banigan's personal struggles with Crohn's
Disease has been scrubbed from the website. The new Board Chairman is the Hon. Glen
M. Ashworth, a retired judge and professional arbitrator/mediator. We find it curious that
just as the CDF is receiving a large amount of scrutiny it hires a Chairman well versed in
lawsuits of all kinds. Maybe they are getting ready to deflect future legal problems.
Further, we highlight the fact that the entire CDF Board has turned over. In 2012 the Board
consisted of seven people: Michael Banigan, Al Henry, Jay Arbetter, Kenneth Brown,
Steven Block, Mike Scholten and Joel Fineberg. Not one of those people is currently on
the Board. Banigan, Henry, Arbetter, Block and Scholten had been on the board for over
five years. In our view, this is not a coincidence. The CDF has been exposed and they
appear to be covering their backs. This may potentially produce large problems for one of
the CDF's largest donors: Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1892111-celgene-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-the-next-domino-to-fall 2/9


We know that CELG works with the CDF because its major drugs Revlimid, Abraxane,
Thalomid and Pomalyst, which collectively account for ~86% of CELG sales, are covered
by the CDF. According to the 2011 CDF Audited Financials we also know that two
pharmaceutical companies account for 81% of the $215 million of donations received that
year. Based on conversations we have had with experts in the industry and directly with
CELG we believe one of these donors is CELG. Assuming CELG represents 40% of total
donations then CELG donated $86 million to the CDF in 2011 and possibly much more in
2012. If the CDF were to shut down or curtail its operations significantly it would be a big
problem for CELG because the CDF's copay assistance program drives a large proportion
of CELG's revenues.


CELG reported in its most recent 10-Q that it increased its donations to independent non-
profit organizations in the United States by $25.5 million Y/Y which accounted for 27% of
the company's $94.1 million SG&A increase Y/Y. This is a huge number - CELG is on
pace to increase its donations to US-based charities for copay assistance programs by
$100 million annually (which is an acceleration from the $72 million increase in 2012). We
also note that the $72m increase Y/Y in 2012 was a 6x acceleration from 2011 when
donations increased by just $11.7 million Y/Y. These increases are extremely important
because copays average about 10% of the cost of the purchased drug. In other words,
$100 million in increased donations to copay assistance programs like those run by the
CDF can ultimately generate $1 billion in incremental drug sales for CELG. Given that
CELG is likely to increase revenue in 2013 by about $1 billion this year and according to
Street estimates another $1 billion next year we think any meaningful change to their
ability to drive revenue through copay assistance programs will impair earnings growth.
Finally, we note that if CELG donated $86 million or more to the CDF in 2012 then such
donations likely drove as much as $860m worth of CELG's total revenues (16% of the total
and 27% of US revenues).


Companies like CELG and QCOR need these large scale copay assistance programs
because very few people can afford their high-priced drugs. What we find remarkable is
despite the fact that CELG's drugs sell for tens of thousands of dollars per year, they
continue to raise prices. The CELG 2012 10-K indicates that 24% of the company's
revenue growth that year was due to price increases ($162.2 million of increased revenue
related to price increases vs. $685.9 million of total net product revenue increase). CELG
highlighted its US price increases in the 10-K: 'the increase in price was primarily due to
price increases on Revlimid, Vidaza and Thalomid in the US market.' CELG's pricing was
actually down Y/Y in 2011 as the company had problems with Medicare: 'The decrease in
prices was primarily due to increased Medicare Part D Coverage Gap [the donut hole]

rebates resulting from the Health Care Reform Act.' We find it hard to believe that CELG
increased donations to charities like the CDF in 2012 by $72 million without expecting
some sort of revenue increase. They had a problem getting reimbursed due to changes in
Medicare laws and utilized charities like the CDF to help sell their high-priced drugs.


Financial Implications and Price Target


Without the increased utilization of copay assistance programs like those provided by the
CDF we estimate 2012 price increases for CELG would have been nil and total revenues
would have been $720 million lower ($72.0 million in increased copay can generate 10x
the sales) This compares with reported US sales growth for CELG in 2012 of $309.1
million. We believe that without the increased help of charities like the CDF, CELG's US
sales could have declined meaningfully in 2012. Incremental margins for CELG are
around 55% so lower sales of $720 million would lower EBIT by nearly $400 million (15%
lower) and EPS by $0.80 (16% lower). In other words, without help from charities like the
CDF 2012 non-GAAP EPS could have been $4.11 (up just 8% Y/Y vs. the reported $4.91
which was up 29% Y/Y). CELG is an expensive stock; it currently trades at 28x 2013E
consensus EPS estimates. Any hiccup to its growth rate could result in meaningful
multiple contraction. Assuming the CDF's activities are largely curtailed and CELG has
difficulties ramping up spend elsewhere we see 2014 revenues 10% lower than
expectations at $6.55B and EPS of $6.20 (representing growth of just 3% Y/Y) vs.
consensus expectations of $7.05 - a 12% miss. Our price target is $112 (down 34%): 18x
our $6.20 2014E EPS estimate.


Conclusion


Some critics of our analysis would say, 'Even if the CDF is shut down Celgene will simply
move their copay assistance dollars elsewhere.' While this may be true we think it is
instructive to highlight just how big the CDF is compared to the six other charities with
copay assistance funds CELG operates with. The CDF took in and spent about $200
million in 2012 on copay assistance programs. Collectively, the six other copay assistance
programs CELG works with spent about $224m, only slightly bigger than the CDF itself.
And nearly half of these expenditures come from just one charity: Patient Access Network
($108m). The rest are relatively small: CancerCare ($6.8 million for financial assistance),
The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ($46 million for copay assistance), HealthWell
Foundation ($42 million), National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD - $11 million
spent on patient services), and NeedyMeds ($10.5m in total 2012 donations). Looking at
this analysis it would stand to reason that the CDF represents about half of all the copay
assistance donation dollars CELG spends ever year.

Comments (23)


The potential dismantling of the CDF, likely CELG's largest copay assistance partner, will
produce revenue and earnings growth problems for CELG and we think investors should
heed our warning. While the CDF is not the only copay assistance program out there it is
by far the largest and may be a harbinger of changes to come in this charitable industry.
Finally, given what we believe about Michael Banigan and his dealings with the CDF as
well CELG's relationship with the CDF we think it is fair to wonder what else could be
going on at CELG.

Interesting story. I hadn't thought of CELG as dependent on co-pay charities as QCOR but it's something to think
about.


A big difference between QCOR and CELG, however, is the latter's drugs are considered standard of care by
oncologists. This is particularly true about Revlimid, which is the dominant drug used to treat multiple myeloma. There

is no replacement or alternative option for Revlimid. QCOR doesn't have that protection, so it's more vulnerable if
docs choose a cheaper alternative than Acthar.


11 Dec 2013, 01:36 PM 


PeterScriabin
Mr F: Docs generally "choose" Acthar when the cheaper alternatives didn't work (IS - where Acthar is
considered the standard of care - excepted). It is very often a last resort.


I suspect you knew all that. If I am mistaken, then it seems you are certainly not shy to comment on things
you don't know much about.

The ties to CELG revenues on this is not accurate. Immaterial really. They help with copay of those on drug -
not to get them on drug.

I guess I really don't understand what the issue is here (really, I'm not just being snarky). Amgen runs its own co-pay
program in parallel with independent non-profits. Wouldn't Celgene just do the same thing?

Just about every orphan drug company has some sort of co assistance program.with more complex govt. regulations
it is increasingly necessary to have a lawyer on a nonprofit board.If the directors don't have the skills or time you
replace them. 
An investigation is not an indictment or a fine. An indictment is not a conviction and a fine generally doesn't put a co.
Out of business. 
JP Morgan has paid billion upon billions of fines and has admitted in a sleazy backhanded fashion that it committed
wrongdoing ( but in such a way as to minimize private liabilities). That has happened here. 
Do I think CDf could do a better job of running its organization? Yes.Do I think it will be shut down?No. Could I be
wrong? Absolutely. 
You're just using McCarthy (joe) tactics.Guilt by association and innuendos on top of other innuendos based on
guesses. 
Maybe, you have a future at the National Inquirer.

"The CDF has been exposed and they appear to be covering their backs." That is quite a strong statement on
circumstantial evidence. Where are the indictments? Regarding "Banigan gone", he is in fact retiring, which anyone
can read on their gooddaysfromcdf page.

This is absolutely misleading.The link to CELG revenues is inappropriate and inaccurate...CELG is on its way to 5
separate billion dollar a yr drugs, Revlimid will be the largest cancer drug of all time, international sales will double in
the next 2 yrs, and the sales generated by the above are not material to CELG. The Bannigan comments are fair but
the other comments are misleading. CELG has been clear they help patients with copays as a result of them using
CELG products not causing them to be on drug...patients have multiple sources to get assistance with copays.
Another negative article during ASH week - I am buying. Thanks for the dip


11 Dec 2013, 07:15 PM 


biothoughts
You realize CELG ASH data has KOL's saying Revlimid maintenance is now going to be std of care
worldwide....analysts say this will double duration of therapy which is the single largest generater or incremental
revenue and EPS. The sales related to the above even if it closed down would be eclipsed like a tsumami by
European Front line, Japanese front line and US increased duration. Approvals in China/Brazil/Mexico/Ca... will drive
sales much higher.Then NHL will kick in. Pomalyst will be a multi-billion dollar drug and is launching in Europe as we
speak....add in Vidaza, Abraxane and Apremilast and you will have 5 separate billion dollar a yr drugs at high margins
and low tax rates. The above is very very minor. There are reasons Credit Suisse just upgraded CELG from neutral to
a buy with a $210 target after being neutral since $60. Adding on this dip. 
Here is Credit Suisse upgrade

Copays can be 0% to a pretty hefty 30-50% of total cost of drugs whereby most ppl are at 10-20% copays.
Their insurance covers the rest.


So, all in all, patient pays nothing/minimal amounts of money to get drug/tx/care/etc.

The Highwayman, Contributor
I'm a QCOR long and think that the only reason everyone is including Banigan now is because of the Barrons Article
in Oct. and Mr. Citron's attack on the CDF. Now he's being proven wrong by Banigan retiring and has to cover his
bottom.


You stated that "We find it curious that just as the CDF is receiving a large amount of scrutiny it hires a Chairman well
versed in lawsuits of all kinds." First off who is "we"? Do you speak on behalf of all Seeking Alpha or are you working
with others?


Secondly, maybe they placed a former judge as the Chairman so that they would be able to rightly discredit and
possibly identify legal action against people who make defamatory claims against them...that includes Citron and any
other publication who present articles founded on speculation rather than actual numbers and facts. And they do it all
to strike fear into the stock and manipulate the PPS as we've seen time and time again with QCOR...I guess Citron
was right about insurers dropping Acthar and the PPS being single digits?


I also highly doubt a former judge would knowingly run a company that is corrupt simply so he could defend it. Don't
you think that sounds a little stupid?

James Melvin, Contributor
Another swiss cheese argument based on "if's," maybe's, and "the mysterious unanswered questions." Your argument
against Celgene is at least has some figment of an argument, but you really will so loosely tie in Questcor as the
same? You seem to neglect any research.


How about the fact that a large portion of QCOR sales increases in the last 3 years are a reflection of very successful
new rollouts into Nephrology and Rheumatology. Even though this is all under Acthar sales, it is still very meaningful
diversification as infantile spasms and MS use to be virtually all of their sales even just 3 years ago.


Again, I am really excited you are the people who are shorting the stock. I love your lack of any real evidence and
willingness to put $ on the line. I bought this stock before it crashed at $39, bought at $19 and buying again! This is
my best performer ever.


To put it simply, a PEG of .31 and the 3rd fastest growing company in the last decade... it must be Christmas early!!
