CT Environmental Group Ltd (HK: 1363) (“CTEG” or the “Company”) primarily engages in industrial 


wastewater treatment and hazardous waste disposal.  In a crowded and heavily regulated industry where prices 


are typically set by the Chinese government, CTEG has reported margins far in excess of its competitors.  It 


claims that its success is driven by its business model of building, owning and operating wastewater treatment 


facilities (the “BOO” model).  





In this report, we present publicly available wastewater treatment data from the Chinese government which 


directly contradicts CTEG’s reported wastewater treatment volumes at two of its primary facilities.  In our 


opinion, this is clear and irrefutable evidence that the Company has lied to the investing public about the volume 


of water treated at its facilities and as a result, its reported revenues and profitability.  This report also presents 


SAIC filings and other government records showing that, in our opinion, CTEG has engaged in undisclosed 


related party acquisitions of companies secretly connected to its Chairman.  Shockingly, we have found evidence 


of intimate dealings with the former chairman of China Metal Recycling, which Glaucus exposed as a fraud in 


2013 (report available here) and which was subsequently liquidated by Hong Kong regulators. 





When we consider the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the Company is materially misrepresenting its 


reported financial performance and that its management is so untrustworthy that CTEG is simply uninvestable.  


But to be conservative, we value CTEG’s shares at HKD 0.38 per share, an 82% downside from the current share 


price.  Given that CTEG’s debt levels have ballooned to RMB 2.3 billion in 1H 2016, we believe that it is 


reasonable to expect even further downside pressure on the Company’s shares. 





1. Inflation of Reported Wastewater Treatment Volumes.  Because wastewater treatment is a highly 
regulated business, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (“MEP”) publishes an annual list of the 


volume of wastewater processed at key facilities in China.  This data directly contradicts the Company’s 


reported figures for the utilization of two key facilities.       





a. Xintao.  CTEG’s Guangzhou Xintao Industrial Park Treatment Facility (“Xintao”) is the Company’s 
primary wastewater BOO facility, with total design capacity for wastewater treatment of 100,000m³ 


per day.  CTEG claimed that Xintao operated at 97%, 99% and 100% capacity utilization in 2012, 2013 


and 2014, respectively.  But the MEP’s National Urban Sewage Treatment Facilities Lists state 


unequivocally that the Xintao facility only processed 54,400m³ in average daily volume in 2012, 2013, 


and 2014, respectively. These lists are published annually, are unambiguous and are corroborated by 


other sources.  In our opinion, the lists clearly indicate that the Company overstated the amount of 


wastewater processed at the Xintao facility by more than 82% from 2012-2014.   





b. Yinglong.  MEP data shows a similar exaggeration of actual wastewater treatment volumes at another 
key facility, the Guangzhou Yinglong Wastewater Treatment Company Limited (“Yinglong”).  


Yinglong, also operated by CTEG using the BOO model, has a treatment capacity of 100,000m³ per 


day.  CTEG disclosed that Yinglong operated at 73%, 80% and 90% capacity in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 


respectively.  However, the MEP data states that Yinglong only treated 49,300m³ of wastewater per 


day in 2012, and only 53,800m³ in 2013 and 2014.  This data indicates that CTEG overstated the 


amount of wastewater treated at the Yinglong facility by over 54% in those three years.   





c. Profit Overstatement.  MEP data indicates that the Company significantly overstated the utilization 
rates and therefore the volume of water processed at its two key BOO facilities.  Because CTEG’s 


wastewater treatment segment from its BOO facilities is the Company’s primary driver of 


profitability, we estimate that CTEG’s gross profit from its BOO segment was 67% less than 


reported for that segment from 2012-2014.

2. Den of Thieves.  In 2013, Glaucus released a report alerting the market that according to MEP data, Hong Kong listed China 
Metal Recycling (HK: 0773) (“CMR”) was a blatant fraud that was fabricating its reported revenues and profits.  In an 


unprecedented step, the SFC moved to force CMR into liquidation.  Hong Kong courts agreed, saying there was “compelling 


evidence” that CMR had engaged in “industrial scale fraud.”  CMR was one of the most blatant and aggressive frauds in Hong 


Kong history.  Imagine our surprise when we discovered that CMR’s Chairman, Chun Chi-Wai (“Mr. Chun”), was intimately 


involved in the foundation of CTEG.  SAIC filings reveal that disgraced CMR Chairman Chun Chi-Wai was a founding board 


member of Xintao and Guangzhou Kaizhou, two of the Company’s three original PRC operating subsidiaries.  In addition, 


CTEG’s Chairman Mr. Tsui Cham To (“Chairman Tsui”) was named as Mr. Chun’s business partner in CMR’s Global Offering 


and, among other things, purchased assets from CMR prior to CMR’s IPO.  Such records suggest that CMR’s disgraced chairman 


was intimately involved in the construction of CTEG and that CTEG’s Chairman Tsui maintained close ties with the orchestrator 


of the one of the most notorious stock frauds in Hong Kong history.   





3. Inflated Purchase Price for Undisclosed Related Party Acquisitions.  In 2015, CTEG acquired 100% equity interests in three 
facilities for a total aggregate consideration of RMB 276 million.  But this understates the cost to shareholders.  The three acquired 


entities also carried on their books a total of RMB 352 million in mysterious payables to undisclosed recipients, meaning that 


it cost the Company RMB 628 million to acquire three facilities.  CTEG claimed that in each case, the beneficial owners of the 


acquired entities were independent third parties.  We believe that this is a lie.  SAIC filings reveal that each of the entities was 


majority owned by Guangzhou Yingzhou Investment Co. Ltd. (“Guangzhou Yingzhou”), an undisclosed related party which 


we believe is controlled by or connected to CTEG’s Chairman.  Worse still, SAIC filings show that undisclosed related party 


Guangzhou Yingzhou acquired all three entities for just RMB 46 million one year before flipping them to CTEG at a 6x 


markup (or a 13.7x markup if the mysterious payables are included).  Put simply, public records indicate that CTEG’s 


Chairman was connected to all three facilities which the Company acquired at a massive markup from an undisclosed related 


party, a clear violation of Hong Kong securities rules.  In our view, these transactions either represent a naked transfer of wealth 


to the Chairman or are fake capital expenditures designed to mask fabricated profits.   





4. SAIC Filings Suggest Fabricated Financial Statements for Major Acquisition.  In April 2014, CTEG acquired Qingyuan 
Lvyou Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited (“Qingyuan Lvyou”), a company engaged in sludge and solid 


waste treatment, for RMB 125 million.  The Company disclosed that Qingyuan Lvyou generated a loss in 2012 and net profits of 


RMB 11.9 million in 2013.  Post-acquisition, the Company stated that Qingyuan Lvyou’s profitability skyrocketed, generating net 


profit of HKD 80 million in 2014.  However, Qingyuan Lvyou SAIC filings reveal that it generated a net loss of RMB 13.8 


million in 2013, and only generated a net profit of RMB 27.2 million in 2014, 82% less than the aggregate profits reported 


to investors in those two years. 





5. Entrusted Operations: Undisclosed Related Party Revenues.  In 2015, CTEG reported a mysterious new source of revenue 
which it labelled “entrusted operation services.”  According to CTEG, this segment reported an EBITDA margin of 99.7% and 


accounted for 16% of the Company’s total FY 2015 EBITDA.  Yet SAIC filings reveal that 49% of the revenue from “entrusted 


operation services” came from six entities which are ultimately owned by Guangzhou Yingzhou, the undisclosed related party 


which we believe is secretly connected to the Chairman.  Given that the Company reports an inexplicable 99.7% EBITDA margin 


in this segment, that it failed to disclose such related party relationships calls into question the authenticity of such reported profits. 





6. Questionable Idle Land Purchase.  On November 25, 2013, Xintao successfully won land use rights at an auction for RMB 44 
million.  As a condition for purchasing the land, construction had to begin within 12 months after signing and construction had to 


be completed within 36 months after signing.  Yet a Baidu map and site visit reveal that nearly three years after the signing date, 


Xintao has not begun construction on the property.  Why would the Company take on debt to spend RMB 44 million in cash for 


a property that sits idle in violation of the land purchase contract?   





7. Incredible Profitability at Odds with Serial Capital Raising.  Wastewater treatment in China is a crowded and commoditized 
space, heavily regulated by the Chinese government.  We would not expect a business like CTEG, without a technological 


advantage over its peers, to report financial performance which significantly deviates from its competitors. Yet in 2015, CTEG’s 


reported return-on-capital and net income margins figures were 127% and 108% greater, respectively, than an average of other 


Chinese wastewater treatment and disposal companies.  This simply defies credibility.  It is even more suspicious that despite such 


record profitability (net income margins between 33-46%), CTEG is still a serial capital raiser.  CTEG’s supposed profitability 


has been squandered on capital expenditures and acquisitions of questionable authenticity, and since 2008, the Company has raised 


via equity and debt issuances a total of RMB 4.4 billion (RMB 3.5 billion since 2013).  Like China Metal Recycling, despite 


supposedly generating consistent and world-beating profit margins which bear no resemblance to the economics of its competitors, 


CTEG repeatedly returns to the capital markets to raise  money.  In our experience, this is a tell-tale sign of fabricated financial 


statements.

VALUATION 





In this report, we present publicly available evidence, which in our opinion, indicates that CTEG has significantly inflated the 


utilization rate of its primary BOO water treatment facilities.  For its primary Xintao facility, the Company has claimed that it 


operates near 100% utilization.  Yet MEP data indicates it operated at 54% utilization in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (the most recent year 


for which we have MEP data).   





The BOO segment is the driver of CTEG’s supposed superior profitability (relative to its peers) and the primary component in the 


sell-side valuation of the Company’s stock.  Yet the MEP data indicates such supposed profitability is a mirage.  This makes sense 


given that the Company is a serial capital raiser despite its inexplicable financial performance.   





Additional evidence suggests that the Company is violating Hong Kong securities rules and exaggerating its reported financial 


performance.  SAIC filings indicate that the Company fabricated the financial performance of a recent acquisition.  SAIC filings 


also indicate that several of the Company’s recent acquisitions, which included mysterious payables on top of the reported aggregate 


consideration, were from an undisclosed related party.   





When we consider the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the Company is materially misrepresenting its reported 


financial performance and that its management is so untrustworthy that CTEG is simply uninvestable.   





But in an effort to be conservative, we prepared an estimated valuation.  Based on the MEP data and other evidence presented 


in this report, we estimate that CTEG’s actual revenues are at least 30% less than reported.  We also believe, based on the 


evidence, that at best, CTEG is just another player in a crowded, commoditized space littered by thousands of other companies.  


Accordingly, in our valuation, we normalized the Company’s EBIT margins to match its peers.  Rather than using the 


Company’s reported 52% EBIT margins (which we believe are fabricated), our valuation uses a blended average EBIT margin 


of 28% generated by other Chinese wastewater treatment and waste disposal companies in 2015.   





Simply normalizing CTEG’s EBIT margins implies a significant downside in the price of its shares.  By applying a blended 


P/E ratio of its peers, and applying a 25% corruption discount, we value CTEG’s shares at HKD 0.38 per share, an 82% 


downside from the current stock price.   





 
Source: Bloomberg; Glaucus Estimates 





But we believe that even this valuation is too generous to CTEG, given the evidence that the Company has materially deceived 


investors about its financial performance.  In addition, CTEG’s 1H 2016 debt balance has ballooned to RMB 2.3 billion.  We 


believe that such debt levels are problematic if, as we believe, the Company is much less profitable than it claims.  Ultimately, 


while we conservatively value CTEG’s shares at HKD 0.38 per share, given its debt levels and the scale of misrepresentations 


to investors and regulators, there is a reasonable probability of further downside to the Company’s shares.

INFLATION OF REPORTED WASTEWATER TREATMENT VOLUMES 





CTEG’s business model is to process wastewater into clean water and resell the reclaimed water to public or private 


users.  This requires large initial capital expenditures to build treatment, processing and disposal facilities.  


Accordingly, companies in this space generate sustained profitability when their expensive facilities are operating at 


a high capacity utilization rate.   





Wastewater treatment is a commoditized industry in which the Chinese government typically regulates pricing.  It is 


also fiercely competitive, crowded with players undifferentiated by basic technologies.  In China, by the end of 2014, 


there were 4,436 operating urban sewage treatment facilities with a total design capacity of 171 million cubic meters 


per day and real processing volume of 135 million cubic meters per day.1   





Despite this difficult operating environment, CTEG has attracted investors with its industry-leading margins.  The 


Company claims that its reported profitability is generated by its Build-Own-Operate (“BOO”) business model.  From 


2010 through 2012, CTEG reported that its BOO segment generated 87% of the Company’s total reported gross 


profits.  Prices for wastewater processed by a BOO facility are not typically set by the Chinese government, allowing 


the Company to charge a higher price on its services.2  In theory, this could lead to higher profit margins if the 


Company’s water treatment facilities operated at or near full capacity, as CTEG claims.   





1) XINTAO 
 


CTEG’s Guangzhou Xintao Industrial Park Treatment Facility (“Xintao”) is a wastewater treatment plant and the 


Company’s primary BOO facility during the pre-IPO track record period, with total design capacity for wastewater 


treatment of 100,000 m³ per day.     





CTEG reported that the Xintao facility’s wastewater treatment services accounted for 69% (RMB 486 million) of the 


Company’s aggregate gross profits during the track record period from 2010 through 2012.  


 
Source: CTEG Prospectus, p. 8 





During the track record period, the Company attracted investor interest by highlighting the success of its BOO model 


and specifically the superior financial performance of the Xintao wastewater treatment facility.   





CTEG’s wastewater treatment revenue generation is dependent on (i) the volume of water treated, and (ii) the average 


price of water treated.  CTEG disclosed in its Global Offering that Xintao processed an average 97,364m³ of 


wastewater per day in 2012,3 achieving a 97.4% capacity utilization rate.

Guangzhou Xintao Volume of Wastewater Treated 2010 - 2012 


 
Source: CTEG Prospectus, p. 4 





We believe that this was a blatant lie.   





Because wastewater treatment is a highly regulated business, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection 


(“MEP”) publishes an annual list on its website of the volume of wastewater processed at urban sewage treatment 


facilities around China.   





On April 24, 2013, the MEP announced that in 2012 there were a total of 3,836 urban sewage treatment facilities in 


the PRC, with average daily treatment capacity of 116 million cubic meters.   





 
Source: MEP Announcement April 24, 2013 





This same announcement included a link to a detailed list of treatment facilities published by the MEP. Below is an 


excerpt from the 2012 MEP National Urban Sewage Treatment Facilities List which states that Xintao’s average daily 


volume of treated wastewater was 54,400m³ in 2012.

This evidence directly contradicts the Company’s claim that the Xintao facility treated an average daily volume 


of 97,364m³ per day in 2012, and indicates that CTEG overstated its treated wastewater volume by 79% for 


that year. 





The 2013 and 2014 MEP lists tell a similar story.  CTEG told sell side analysts that Xintao operated at 99% and 100% 


in 2013 and 2014, respectively.4  Yet both the 2013 and 2014 MEP lists state that Xintao’s average daily volumes 


remained flat at 54,400m³ in both years, implying that CTEG overstated Xintao treated volumes by 82% and 84% 


in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

These two independent sources, one a government website and the other an industry website, corroborate the MEP 


data and indicate that Xintao’s actual utilization rate was less than 55% in 2013 and 2014.  This data directly 


contradicts the Company’s reported utilization rate for the Xintao facility in those years.

2) Yinglong 
 


MEP data shows a similar exaggeration of wastewater treatment volumes at Guangzhou Yinglong Wastewater 


Treatment Company Limited (“Yinglong”), another wastewater treatment facility operated by CTEG using the BOO 


model. 





The Yinglong facility was acquired in 2012 by CTEG, and in the MEP lists it is referred to by its former name, 


Guangzhou Development Xintang Water Service Company Limited (“Xintang Water”).  As disclosed in the 


Company’s Global Offering, CTEG acquired the facility from Xintang Water in 2012.   











Source: CTEG Prospectus, p. 102 





CTEG disclosed in its Global Offering that Yinglong processed an average 72,681m³ of wastewater per day in 2012.   





 
Source: CTEG Prospectus, p. 4 





However, the 2012 MEP list states that Yinglong’s average daily volume of treated wastewater was only 49,300m³.  


This directly contradicts the Company’s reported utilization rate for this facility and indicates that CTEG exaggerated 


the volume of wastewater treated by the Yinglong facility by 47%.  Note that MEP lists refer to Yinglong by its 


previous name, Xintang Water.

Subsequently, the Company disclosed to sell-side analysts that Yinglong’s capacity utilization was 80% and 90% in 


2013 and 2014, respectively.5  However, the 2013 MEP list and 2014 MEP list reveal that Yinglong’s average daily 


volumes remained flat at 53,800m³ in both years, implying that CTEG overstated the volume of wastewater treated 


by Yinglong by 49% and 67% in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

The table below illustrates the discrepancy between the Company’s claims and the MEP data regarding the average 


daily volume of waste water treated at Yinglong.  On average, from 2012 through 2014, this data indicates that CTEG 


overstated its Yinglong average daily volume treated by 54%.

Like Xintao, the MEP data for Yinglong is corroborated by an independent source.  In this case, an article on the 


industry website Dowater.com, published in September 2014, confirms that the average daily volume of water treated 


at the Yinglong (again referred to by its previous name Xintang Water) was 53,800 cubic meters per day.

This industry source stated that Yinglong was operating at 54% capacity, well below the 80-90% capacity claimed by 


the Company.   





In examining the credibility of the MEP data, we compared other publicly listed companies and found that overall, 


the MEP data tracked the claimed utilization of their facilities.6  





First, we examined Hong Kong listed Beijing Enterprises Water Group Limited (HK 0371) (“Beijing Water”).  We 


compared Beijing Water’s claimed utilization rate for its PRC based wastewater treatment facilities with the utilization 


rates from the MEP data.  The MEP data matched Beijing Water’s claims, almost perfectly.   





                                                           
6 MEP data was not available for all of Beijing Water’s or Kangda’s facilities, so we compared the claimed overall utilization rates 


with the MEP utilization rates for facilities for which data was available.  In the case of Beijing Water, this represented roughly 


half of its overall capacity and its major facilities, so we believe that the MEP data was sufficient to give a representative sample 


to measure Beijing Water’s overall utilization rate.  For Kangda, we likewise found MEP data for roughly 55% of its facilities, 


including its major projects, which we believe is a sufficient number to analyze Kangda’s claimed utilization rates against the data 


set.   


 



http://www.dowater.com/company/2014-09-24/272564.html
13 





CT Environmental Group Ltd. │ HK: 1363                        www.glaucusresearch.com 








We found the same pattern with respect to Kangda International Environmental Co Ltd (HK: 6136), another Hong 


Kong listed wastewater treatment company (“Kangda”).  Data was only available for comparison in 2012 and 2013, 


during Kangda’s track record period.  But the MEP data matched the utilization rates claimed in Kangda’s public 


offering.   








MEP data largely conforms to the utilization rates reported by two other Hong Kong companies, Beijing Water and 


Kangda, increasing our conviction in the accuracy of the data set.   





3) Profit Overstatement 
 


MEP data indicates that the Company significantly overstated the utilization rates and therefore the volume of 


wastewater processed at its two key BOO facilities.  Because CTEG’s wastewater treatment segment from its BOO 


facilities is the Company’s primary driver of profitability, the impact of the Company’s misrepresentations is 


severe.   





Using the utilization rates from the MEP data and average estimated tariffs obtained from sell side analysts, we have 


estimated what we believe to be the amount of revenues overstated by the Company at each of its key facilities.  We 


calculate that the Company overstated its Xintao facility revenue by RMB 268 million between 2012-2014, and 


overstated Yinglong facility revenues by RMB 128 million over that same period.

Based on these estimated tariff rates and the MEP data, we calculate that the Company’s actual BOO revenue was 


52% less than reported from 2012-2014.7 





 
Source: Company Filings, CTEG Prospectus, p. 8, Guosen Securities, 2012-2014 MEP data, Glaucus estimates 


 
Simply estimating the overstated revenue does not capture the extent to which we believe that the Company has 


misrepresented its financial performance.  The Company’s BOO sector was responsible for 64% of CTEG’s reported 


gross profit from 2012 through 2014. 





To estimate how much of CTEG’s profits were overstated at its key BOO facilities, we make a key assumption.  We 


assume that the Company reported accurate COGS and that the fabricated revenues were added directly to reported 


gross profits.  Based on our assumption, we estimate that CTEG’s gross profit from its BOO segment was 67% 


less than reported for that segment from 2012-2014.  





 
Source: Company Filings, CTEG Prospectus, p. 8, Guosen Securities, 2012-2014 MEP data, Glaucus estimates 





Ultimately, we believe that the MEP data clearly indicates that the Company overstated the volume of wastewater 


treated at its key BOO facilities and that as such, CTEG’s gross profits were significantly overstated.   





                                                           
7 We exclude 2015 from this analysis because we do not have MEP data for this year, but we believe that the Company continued 


to materially misrepresent the performance of its BOO business in these years.

DEN OF THIEVES  





On January 28, 2013, Glaucus released a report alerting the market that according to MEP data (the same source as 


the data presented in this report), Hong Kong listed China Metal Recycling (HK: 0773) (“CMR”) was a blatant fraud 


that was fabricating its reported revenues and profits.   





In an unprecedented step, on July 29, 2013, the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) moved to force CMR 


into liquidation.  Hong Kong courts agreed, saying that there was “compelling evidence” that CMR had engaged in 


“industrial scale fraud.”  On August 12, 2013, Bloomberg reported that Hong Kong police arrested the CMR Chairman 


along with his wife and two other officers of the disgraced company.   





CMR was one of the most blatant and aggressive frauds in Hong Kong history.  Imagine our surprise when we 


discovered evidence that CMR’s Chairman, Chun Chi-Wai, was intimately involved in the formation of CTEG.  





Xi Zhou Enterprises (Hong Kong) (“Xi Zhou”) is a Company subsidiary which serves as the Hong Kong holding 


company for all CTEG’s PRC subsidiaries.  It is obviously a significant entity within CTEG’s corporate structure.  


We can safely infer that the actions of Xi Zhou are ultimately directed by Chairman Tsui Cham To (“Chairman Tsui”). 


 
Source: CTEG Prospectus, p. 106 








SAIC filings reveal that Mr. Chun Chi-Wai (“Mr. Chun”), the disgraced former Chairman of CMR, was appointed by 


Xi Zhou as a founding board member of CTEG’s critical PRC subsidiary, Xintao.

The relationship appears to be so intimate that CTEG’s Chairman Tsui was mentioned in CMR’s Global Offering as 


Mr. Chun’s business partner.  The listing document also discloses that Chairman Tsui purchased assets from CMR as 


part of CMR’s reorganization during its pre-IPO period.   





 
Source: China Metal Recycling Prospectus, p. 94 





Such records suggest that CMR’s disgraced chairman was intimately involved in the construction of CTEG and that 


CTEG’s Chairman Tsui maintained close ties with a blatant stock fraudster.  Such intimacy with a man arrested for 


orchestrating one of Hong Kong’s most notorious stock frauds is a major red flag for investors.  In our opinion, this 


relationship bolsters the credibility of the evidence in this report that CTEG is similarly misrepresenting its financial 


performance to investors.

INFLATED PURCHASE PRICES FOR UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTY ACQUISITIONS 





In 2015, CTEG acquired 100% equity interests in three facilities for a total aggregate consideration of RMB 276 


million.  CTEG claimed that in each case, the beneficial owners of the acquired entities were independent third parties.  


We believe that this is a lie.  SAIC filings reveal that each of the three entities was owned by an undisclosed related 


party secretly connected to CTEG’s Chairman.   





Worse still, SAIC filings show that undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou acquired all three entities 


for just RMB 46 million one year before flipping them to CTEG at a 6x markup.  Records indicate that 


Guangzhou Yingzhou was incorporated only weeks before the first transaction, which to us indicates that the entity 


was formed simply to serve as a related party middleman to mark up the value of acquired facilities.  





Put simply, the records indicate that CTEG’s Chairman was connected to all three facilities which the Company 


acquired at a massive markup from an undisclosed related party, a clear violation of Hong Kong securities rules.  In 


our view, these transactions either represent a naked transfer of wealth to the Chairman or are fake capital expenditures 


designed to mask fabricated profits.   





a. Ganghui Huanbao Acquisition.   
 


In November 2015, CTEG subsidiary Xintao acquired 100% equity interest in Ganghui Environmental Sewage 


Treatment Co. Ltd. (also known as Foshan Shunde Ganghui Wastewater Treatment Company) (“Ganghui Huanbao”), 


for a total consideration of RMB 73 million. In public filings, CTEG’s claimed that all Ganghui Huanbao’s ultimate 


beneficial owners were independent third parties.

Guangzhou Yingzhou’s landlord, To Kee Enterprises, is an entity 89% owned by CTEG’s Chairman Tsui.  Its 


shareholder is the board supervisor of a different entity owned and controlled by CTEG’s Chairman and his cousin.  


Accordingly, we believe that Guangzhou Yingzhou is clearly a connected party.   





We believe that the Company concealed this information because records indicate that CTEG inflated the purchase 


price of Ganghui Huanbao and the other entities acquired from undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou.   





CTEG reported that the total acquisition consideration for Ganghui Huanbao was RMB 73 million.  Because CTEG 


inherited the entity’s RMB 149 million in payables to an unnamed party, the true cost of acquisition was RMB 222 


million!

SAIC filings suggest that this price was significantly inflated.  First, SAIC filings show that Guangzhou Yingzhou 


bought Ganghui Huanbao for RMB 25 million in September 2014.

Strangely, SAIC filings reveal that Guangzhou Yingzhou then sold Ganghui Huanbao to the Company in December 


2015 for a purchase price of only RMB 3 million, which is 96% less than CTEG reported in 2015 company 


filings!

If the true cost of the acquisition was only RMB 3 million, SAIC filings indicate that the Company fabricated over 


RMB 70 million in acquisition costs.  Given the evidence that the Company acquired Ganghui Huanbao from an 


undisclosed related party connected to the Chairman, in our opinion, this evidence of overpayment suggests that 


insiders used an inflated purchase price to loot the Company.

b. Zhongtuo Kailan Acquisition.   
 


In November 2015, CTEG also acquired 100% equity interest in Zhongshan Zhongtuo Kailan Industry Co., Ltd. 


(“Zhongtuo Kailan”) for a total consideration of RMB 116 million.  In CTEG’s public filings, the Company claimed 


that all of the Zhongtuo Kailan’s ultimate beneficial owners were independent third parties. Again, we believe that 


this is a lie.   





Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/0923/LTN20140923853.pdf 


SAIC filings reveal that Zhongtuo Kailan was (and continues to be) owned by Guangzhou Yingzhou, the entity 


secretly connected to the Chairman.  Investors should find alarming that in 12 months, a Company acquisition is still 


registered to its sellers.  Perhaps the Company has not bothered to update the shareholder registration because, as 


discussed extensively in the previous section, evidence indicates that the seller, Guangzhou Yingzhou, is an 


undisclosed related party secretly connected to Chairman Tsui through a series of shell companies.

SAIC filings also indicate that the Company paid an inflated price to purchase Zhongtuo Kailan.  Filings show that 


undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou acquired Zhongtuo Kailan for only RMB 20 million, in two separate 


transactions, the first in October 2014, and the second in May 2015.

SAIC filings show that Guangzhou Yingzhou acquired Zhongtuo Kailan for RMB 20 million, only to sell it to CTEG 


one year later for RMB 116 million.  The undisclosed party secretly connected to CTEG’s Chairman flipped the 


facility to the Company at a 5.8x markup.  But this likely understates the true cost to the Company, because Zhongtuo 


Kailan supposedly carried RMB 162 million in payables to an undisclosed party, which we suspect is either CTEG’s 


Chairman or parties closely connected to him, resulting in a total purchase price of RMB 278 million, a 13.9x markup.  


We think the evidence is clear, just like with Ganghui Huanbao, that insiders massively inflated the purchase price of 


facilities acquired from undisclosed related parties.   





c. Hanyang Shuiwu Acquisition.   
 


A third acquisition follows a similar pattern.  In November 2015, CTEG acquired 100% of Shunde Hanyang Industrial 


Water Supply Company Limited (“Hanyang Shuiwu”) for a total consideration of RMB 87 million.  In CTEG’s
31 





CT Environmental Group Ltd. │ HK: 1363                        www.glaucusresearch.com 





former operating agreement with Hanyang Shuiwu, CTEG claimed that all of Hanyang Shuiwu’s ultimate beneficial 


owners were independent third parties. SAIC filings reveal a different story.    





Below is a screenshot from the SAIC website which discloses that Xintao is the current shareholder of Hanyang 


Shuiwu.  However, prior shareholder information disclosed in SAIC filings reveal that Hanyang Shuiwu was 


previously owned by Guangzhou Yingzhou, the same undisclosed related party that was/is the beneficial owner of the 


other acquisitions discussed in this section. 








 
Source: http://gsxt.gdgs.gov.cn/aiccips/index 








The Company acquired Hanyang Shuiwu for RMB 87 million.  Yet like the other transactions discussed in this section, 


SAIC indicates that this purchase price was massively inflated.  SAIC filings show that ten months prior to the sale 


of Hanyang Shuiwu to CTEG, Guangzhou Yingzhou acquired the entity for only RMB 1 million!

Source: Hanyang Shuiwu SAIC Filings 





SAIC filings show that the Company paid 87x times more than undisclosed related Guangzhou Yingzhou paid to 


acquire the exact same facility only ten months before! 
 


Such a massive inflation of the purchase price of a facility purchased from a secretly related party is, in our opinion, 


so indefensible that on this basis alone, the actions of CTEG’s management renders the Company uninvestable.   





In aggregate, the deception appears to be systematic.  Guangzhou Yingzhou acquired three entities for RMB for 46 


million, then one year later flipped these same facilities to the Company for RMB 276 million in 2015.  But because 


these entities carried mysterious payables to unnamed third parties, the actual cost was closer to RMB 628 million.
33

Source: Company filings, SAIC filings 





If we consider only the acquisition consideration paid by the Company to acquire these three entities, it appears that 


undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou marked up the value of the three entities by 6.0x in just a year.   





SAIC filings indicate that Guangzhou Yingzhou was only incorporated on July 29, 2014, just a few weeks before it 


acquired Ganghui Huanbao.  In our opinion, this suggests that Guangzhou Yingzhou’s sole purpose was to serve as a 


secret related party middleman through which CTEG could mark up the value of its acquisitions.   





If we include the mysterious payables, the purchase price of these three facilities was inflated by 13.7x.  CTEG does 


not disclose the identity of such creditors, but in our experience, this is an established method of quietly funneling 


money to undisclosed related parties.  We believe, based on the size of the payables and the undisclosed related party 


connection to the acquired entities, that insiders are likely the beneficiary of such payments.  We leave it to regulators 


with subpoena power to determine whether such payments ended up in the hands of insiders, but in our opinion, the 


evidence is compelling. 





d. Menghui Technology.   
 


On January 8, 2015, CTEG entered an operating agreement with Guangzhou Menghui Technology Company Limited 


(“Menghui Technology”) to upgrade, operate and maintain its wastewater treatment facility in Zengcheng, China.  The 


agreement states that CTEG will invest RMB 35 million into Menghui Technology in exchange for a 20-year fee, 


payable monthly to CTEG for services rendered. CTEG’s claimed that all Menghui Technology’s ultimate beneficial 


owners were independent third parties.  Again, we believe that this is a lie.   





SAIC filings reveal that Menghui Technology is owned by Guangzhou Yingzhou, the same undisclosed related party 


that is/was the beneficial owner of the three separate acquisitions made by CTEG in 2015.

weeks before CTEG announced it was investing RMB 35 million in the entity.   


 
Source: Guangzhou Menghui SAIC Filings 





This case raises obvious questions.  If the Company wanted to invest in or build a facility, why didn’t CTEG do so 


directly? Why was the investment in Menghui Technology routed through Guangzhou Yingzhou? In our opinion, the 


answer is obvious.  Insiders insured that the entity, worth only RMB 500,000 was first purchased by an undisclosed 


related party, making that undisclosed related party the beneficiary of the Company’s RMB 35 million proposed 


investment.

CT Environmental Group Ltd. │ HK: 1363                        www.glaucusresearch.com 





But in this case, Hong Kong regulators have a rare opportunity to stop CTEG and its insiders before further damage 


is done to shareholder interests.  





The Company announced in 2015 Annual Report that it paid acquisition deposits in aggregate of RMB 88 million to 


acquire Menghui Technology and two other entities (Guangzhou Jimei and Zhongling Chemical), which are all owned 


by undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou or its shareholder Mr. Guanghui Liu.

Furthermore, SAIC filings indicate that Menghui Technology was purchased by undisclosed related party Guangzhou

purchased by an undisclosed party a year earlier.

We believe that like the previous acquisitions from undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou, the Company will inflate acquisition costs, thereby hurting shareholders 


and unjustly enriching insiders.  The difference is in this case, we believe that if regulators act quickly they can halt such undisclosed related party transactions before 


shareholders are irreparably harmed.

SAIC FILINGS REVEAL FABRICATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ACQUISTION 





In April 2014, CTEG acquired Qingyuan Lvyou Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited (“Qingyuan 


Lvyou”), a company engaged in sludge and solid waste treatment, for an aggregate consideration of RMB 125 million.   





The Company disclosed that Qingyuan Lvyou generated a loss in 2012 and net profits of only RMB 11.9 million in 


2013.

To increase investor confidence in the transaction, Qingyuan Lvyou’s founder Mr. Gu Yao Kun (“Mr. Gu”) guaranteed 


to generate a minimum profit of HKD 80 million, HKD 100 million, and HKD 120 million for the three years 2014 


through 2016, whereby he would pay cash compensation equal to ten times the shortfall in the event of missing the 


minimum profit threshold. 





In its 2014 Annual Report, CTEG disclosed that Qingyuan Lvyou generated net profits greater than HKD 80 million 


in 2014, resulting in zero shortfall payments by Mr. Gu back to CTEG.8 





 
Source: CTEG 2014 Annual Report, p. 21 





Yet SAIC filings indicate that the Company has misrepresented the financial performance of its acquisition.  Publicly 


available Qingyuan Lvyou SAIC filings reveal that it generated a net loss of RMB 13.8 million in 2013, and generated 


a net profit of only RMB 27.2 million in 2014, at least 82% less than the aggregate profits reported to investors 


in those two years.

extroardinary income that would have been booked if the company received some type of guaranteed payment.

The 2013 net losses revealed in SAIC filings are corroborated by the Company’s own disclosure regarding Qingyuan 


Lvyou’s tax holiday.   





According to CTEG, Qingyuan Lvyou has the right to enjoy three years of a tax holiday starting from the year in 


which it starts generating an operating profit.  As we can see in CTEG’s disclosure, Qingyuan Lvyou is not subject to 


income tax from 2014 to 2016, suggesting that Qingyuan Lvyou did not make money prior to 2014.   





 
Source: 2014 Annual Report, p. 88     Source: 2015 Annual Report, p. 104 





This is consistent with SAIC filings showing a net loss in 2013, but directly contradicts the Company’s prior 


disclosures that Qingyuan Lvyou generated a net profit of RMB 11.9 million in 2013.9  If Qingyuan Lvyou was indeed 


profitable in 2013, then the tax holiday would have begun that year, not 2014 as the Company admits.

ENTRUSTED OPERATIONS: UNDSICLOSED RELATED PARTY REVENUES 
 


In the Company’s 2015 annual report, a mysterious new source of revenue appeared which CTEG labelled “entrusted 


operation services.”10 The Company did not tell the market much about this segment, except that in its breakdown it 


disclosed that entrusted operation services accounted for RMB 131.4 million in revenue and RMB 130.9 in EBITDA, 


and generated an EBITDA margin of 99.7%.   





 
Source: 2015 Annual Report, p. 95  





Odder still, the category of entrusted operation services did not appear in the similar breakdown of EBITDA in the 


2014 annual report.  The Company discloses that in 2015, 49% of the entrusted operation services came from six 


entities: Zhongtuo Kailan, Ganghui Huanbao, Hanyang Suiwu, Menghui Technology, Guangzhou Jimei, and 


Zhongling Chemical.  As discussed in the previous section, all six entities are owned by or were acquired from 


undisclosed related party Guangzhou Yingzhou. 





                                                           
10 In the 2014 Annual Report (p. 10), under the segment labelled “Provision of WWT” the Company discloses “entrusted operation 


projects.”  But we consider it a new source of revenue because in the segment breakdown in 2015 Annual Report (p. 95-96), CTEG 


reported zero revenue and zero EBITDA for this segment in 2014.

EBITDA from entrusted operation services accounts for 16% of the Company’s 2015 reported total EBITDA.  We 


can infer that at least 49% of such EBITDA is supposedly generated by agreements with entities connected to the 


Chairman through Guangzhou Yinglong.  Given that the Company reports an inexplicable 99% EBITDA margin in 


this segment and that CTEG lied about its connected party relationships, we question the authenticity of such reported 


profits.

RECORD PROFITABILITY AT ODDS WITH SERIAL CAPITAL RAISING 





Wastewater treatment in China is a crowded and commoditized space which is heavily regulated by the Chinese 


government.  We would not expect a business like CTEG, without a material technological advantage over its 


competitors, to report financial performance which significantly deviated from its peers.  Yet CTEG’s reported 


financial performance so exceeds that of its peers that its reported figures simply defy credibility.   





For example, from 2010-2015, CTEG reported returns on capital as high as 29% and never dropping below a 


staggering 17%.  During that same period, a basket of other wastewater treatment and waste disposal companies in 


China reported an average return on capital of 7-9%.   





In commoditized space with thousands of treatment facilities, how can a Company like CTEG without a technological 


advantage or economies of scale so significantly outperform other Chinese companies building the same facilities to 


treat the same waste?

CTEG’s supposed profits have been spent on acquisitions and capital expenditures of questionable authenticity and 


purpose (such as the idle land purchase), sending CTEG back to the capital markets time and again to raise money.  


Indeed, its cash flows spent in investing have exceeded cash flows from operations by RMB 1.9 billion since 2008.

This is a major red flag and in our opinion, bolsters the credibility of evidence presented in this report, such as the 


MEP data, indicating that the Company is fabricating its reported profitability and financial performance.   





We have seen this pattern before in other listed companies that turned out to be frauds.  Like CMED and CMR, despite 


supposedly generating consistent and world-beating profit margins, CTEG is a serial capital raiser.  Just because 


CTEG is in a capital-intensive business is no excuse.  Recall that CMR, one of the most brazen frauds in Hong Kong 


history, also tried to make the excuse that its serial capital raising was justified by its need to invest in capital intensive 


scrap recycling facilities.  We were not fooled with CMR and we are not fooled here.

VALUATION 





In this report, we have presented evidence which in our opinions indicates that CTEG has significantly inflated the 


utilization rate of its BOO water treatment facilities.  For its primary Xintao facility, the Company has claimed that it 


operates near 100% utilization.  Yet MEP data indicates it operates at 54% this level in 2013 and 2014 (the most recent 


year for which we have MEP data).   





The BOO segment is the driver of CTEG’s supposed superior profitability (relative to its peers) and the primary 


component in the sell-side valuation of the Company’s stock.  Yet the MEP data indicates such supposed profitability 


is a mirage.  This makes sense given that the Company is a serial capital raiser, despite its inexplicable financial 


performance.   





Other evidence also suggests that the Company is violating Hong Kong securities rules and exaggerating its reported 


financial performance.  SAIC filings indicate that the Company fabricated the financial performance of a recent 


acquisition.  SAIC filings also indicate that several the Company’s recent acquisitions, which included mysterious 


payables on top of the reported aggregate consideration, were from an undisclosed related party.   





When we consider the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the Company is materially misrepresenting its 


reported financial performance and that its management is so untrustworthy that CTEG is simply uninvestable.   





But in an effort to be conservative, we prepared an estimated valuation.  Based on the historical MEP data, we estimate 


that CTEG’s revenues are at least 30% less than reported.11  We also believe, based on the evidence, that at best CTEG 


is just another player in a crowded, commoditized space littered by thousands of other companies.  Accordingly, in 


our valuation, we normalized the Company’s EBIT margins.  Rather than using the Company’s reported 52% EBIT 


margins (which we believe are fabricated), our valuation uses a blended average EBIT margin of the other Chinese 


wastewater treatment and waste disposal companies (28% in 2015).

11 MEP data is only available for certain facilities from 2012 through 2014.  Our estimate of 30% is based on our assumption that 


CTEG has continued to exaggerate revenues and profits at facilities in years for which MEP and other data is not available.

Note: We used the average EBIT margin of CTEG’s peers operating in China to estimate what we believe to 


be the Company’s real EPS. 





Simply normalizing CTEG’s EBIT margins implies a significant downside in the price of its shares.  By applying a 


blended P/E ratio of its peers, and applying a 25% corruption discount, we value CTEG’s shares at HKD 0.38 per 


share, an 82% downside from the current stock price.   





 
Source: Bloomberg; Glaucus Estimates 





But we believe that even this valuation is too generous to CTEG, given the evidence that the Company has materially 


deceived investors about its financial performance.  In addition, CTEG’s 1H 2016 debt balance has ballooned to RMB 


2.3 billion.  We believe that such debt levels are problematic if the Company is much less profitable than it claims 


(and thus generates much less EBITDA to service such debts than it claims).   





Ultimately, while we conservatively value CTEG’s shares at HKD 0.38 per share, given its debt levels and the scale 


of misrepresentations to investors and regulators, there is a reasonable probability of further downside to the 


Company’s shares.
