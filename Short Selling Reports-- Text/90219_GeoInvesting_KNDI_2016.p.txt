New Chinese Media Report May Link Kandi To Subsidy
Fraud

On September 8, 2016, the Minister of Finance in China issued an announcement regarding
an investigation and suggested punishment for five companies that were found to defraud
the Chinese government for electric vehicle (“EV”) subsidies.  This may


Bloomberg reported this incident and listed those five companies’ names. They are: Gemsea
Coach, Chery Wanda Bus, Shenzhen Wuzhoulong Motors Group, Higer Bus Co. and Shaolin
Bus. Serious fines are going to likely be coming for these companies. For example, Gemsea
Coach may be cancelled for national subsidy eligibility, and all of the produced EVs in 2015
may not be subsidized, potentially clawing back the entire national subsidy already paid to
the company in 2015. For the other 4 companies, the government may claw back the
national subsidy received for the 2,416 EVs they sold and may issues fines. These 4
companies’ eligibility of receiving national subsidies will likely be taken away effective 2016.


Today, new light was shed on this issue when a Chinese article from Sohu Finance added
more color. According to the article, the reporter obtained a so-called [paraphrased]
“Important Information Notice” that has been circulated within the new energy companies’
circle. According to the Notice, in addition to these 5 example companies that were on the list
announced in the MOF’s statement, there are many more companies that are involved in this
potential subsidy fraud.


In this Notice, the first category contains all 5 companies mentioned in the MOF’s statement.
The second category was for vehicles that were found to have no batteries or have their
batteries potentially moved. The third category is for vehicles with batteries installed that do
not match what the company claimed. The second category has 12 auto companies’ names
and the third category has 8 companies’ names under it.


Geely’s name showed up in both the second category and third category reported in the
article, as you can see from the below translation.

The article cited a person familiar with the matter regarding the third category. The person
commented that using a battery that isn’t what the company has claimed is a more subtle
way to cheat the subsidy. According to the article, the reason why Geely is involved is
because the company’s Kandi micro electric vehicle is suspected as defrauding this subsidy
(see red line highlights below).


The suggested punishment for these 20 companies, according to this Notice in the article, is
that the 2016 subsidy pre-pay eligibility is cancelled, the questionable EVs’ subsidy in 2015
will not get paid and the subsidy received in 2013 and 2014 could be taken back by the
government. EVs by these companies not found to be in violation are allowed to continue to
be sold.


At the end of the article it states that no government authority has confirmed this Notice. If
this Notice is real, and Kandi (NASDAQ: KNDI) and Geely are involved with this national
subsidy issue, then KNDI could face serious repercussions, as the company might need to
pay back all of the national subsidy money received in 2013 and 2014. Additionally, the
subsidy the company could receive in 2015 might now be up in the air. If 2016 subsidy
eligibility is to be cancelled due to this subsidy defrauding issue, the company’s guidance for
2016 might be materially negatively impacted.
3/3


One caveat is that we have not vetted that the Geely mentioned in this article is the Geely JV
with Kandi, although the article states that the scrutiny on Geely is due to Kandi’s micro
electric vehicle.


Our preliminary analysis regarding amount of subsidies received by the 50/50 JV Company
between Geely and KNDI, Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd., is as follows:


(in USD millions) 2013 and Q1
2014


Q2
2014


Q3 and Q4
2014


2015 total


National subsidy
received


$31.8 $31.8 $44.3 $59.6 $167.5


As you can see, $167.5M in USD could potentially be at risk. As of the Form 10-Q from Q2
2016, Kandi is reported to have about $34M in cash in USD.  We look forward to a company
comment on this matter.


DISCLOSURE: We have established a speculative short position.
