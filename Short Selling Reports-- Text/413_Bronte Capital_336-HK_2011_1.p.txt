Elegant ladies in high heels, water at $1000 per liter and
Huabao, an interesting stock on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange
A couple of years ago my wife and my business partner's wife turned up at our office in Bondi
Junction and then went shopping in the mega-mall below. 
 
This is the sort of thing that gives a tight-wad like me nightmares. 
 
A couple of hours later they returned with their bags. My wife was wearing a new perfume which I kind
of liked. 
 
I would have told her I liked it even if I was completely indifferent (she is my beloved wife) but I could
say it honestly. It was Chanel Gardenia. 
 
This was about a month before our tenth wedding anniversary so I had solved the gift problem – or so
I thought. Later I popped down to DJs (think Nordstrom for Australia) and Myer (the also-ran
department store) looking for Gardenia. No chance. Eventually a customer took pity on me and told
me you could only find this at the Chanel shop. 
 
I could see the bill going up. 
 
I found the Chanel shop in a part of the mall I never visit and the shopkeeper (an elegant woman in
high-heels who looked straight through me) eventually showed me the perfume which came only in
sizable and expensive bottles. Three minutes later and $230 lighter I had my gift. 
 
Mission accomplished. 
 
Australian labeling laws require that Chanel specify some of the ingredients. Here is the label (now
somewhat decayed): 
 


 
 
It is a pretentious label. They call water “Aqua”. Guess they can't bring themselves to admit they sell
water at almost $1000 per litre. Alcohol is the main ingredient – probably a good proportion of the

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Elegant ladies in high heels, water at $1000 per liter and Huabao, an interesting stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange

total. Most the rest I had never heard of. 
 
Being an inquisitive type I looked them up – I even looked on Alibaba for the cost (per tonne) of these
chemicals so I could get some idea of how much I was being ripped off by the fancy box and the
elegant lady in high-heels. It spoiled the romance but was educational. According to
Wikipedia, Citral is a 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal or lemonal, is either of, or a mixture of, a pair of
terpenoids. The E-isomer is known as geraniol (also an ingredient of the perfume). It is pheremonal in
insects (and in the hope – probably vain - of the perfume manufacturer pheremonal in humans too).
There are lots of suppliers on Alibaba – mostly by the barrel. Most of these are distributors
for Givaudan – a Swiss flavors and fragrances business. 
 
Linalool is a major fragrance chemical used – according to Wikipedia – in 60-80 percent of “perfumed
hygene products” and also by pest-professionals as an insecticide. (Note what this perfume does –
drives insects wild with pheremones and kills them. Think what it can do for you!) Again most the
distributors on Alibaba are distributors for Givaudan. You can buy it here for $5 a kilogram and they
will sell you 1000 tonnes per month. It is kosher (and Halal) too! 
 
From there I went looking at Givaudan – the company that probably manufactured this fragrant
“Aqua”. It is an interesting company with an enormous website containing technical specifications
(instructions, FDA approvals etc) for the thousands of flavors and fragrances it manufactures. When
you see apple-pie and cheesecake flavored yogurt what you are seeing is their fine Swiss technology.
There are - if you do a Google count - about 11 thousand pages on this website. This is a
sophisticated and wide-reaching business. 
 
Givaudan is an interesting stock (we think about it as a long) and it is currently trading fairly low
relative to sales vis its history. It is the technological leader in flavors and fragrances. 
 
Here is its P&L in Swiss Francs for the past two years... 
 


 
 
 
This company does CHF336 million (almost 400 million dollars) a year in research and development.
That is what your cheesecake flavored yogurt and Britany perfume cost to develop. This R&D is a
pretty solid barrier to entry. After quite considerable distribution costs (you have to interest the food
manufacturer in the bizarre terpanoid you have developed) and considerable R&D Givaudan winds up
with operating income of 13.1 percent of sales. 
 
There is another flavors and fragrances company – International Flavors and Fragrances – that used
to be the leader and is still the leader in tobacco flavoring (a declining business I would guess). IFF is
well known to people who have read the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon
Profits”. IFF had a tech leadership for generations and was a fantastic stock - it is still not a bad one.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Elegant ladies in high heels, water at $1000 per liter and Huabao, an interesting stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/10/ladies-in-elegant-high-heels-water-at.html 3/10


Somehow (I don't know how as I do not have the history) it ceded much of that leadership to
Givaudan. 
 
All very interesting and grist for the memory bank. 
 
Recently I came by Huabao – a Chinese flavors and fragrances company listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange. Market cap is about 20 billion Hong Kong dollars - about 2.5 billion USD. 
 
The web site clearly is not as sophisticated as Givaudan. Counted pages on the site in Google total
49. 
 
Huabao has a market cap of a bit over a third of Givaudan, and is a strange beast. Like IFF it claims
to be primarily a tobacco flavorant. Here is the P&L. 
 


 
 
Huabao it seems is a truly miraculous business. Gross profit is over 70 percent. Marketing and
distribution expense is 80 million Hong Kong dollars – roughly a twentieth of Givaudan. Research and
development expenses are 73 million HKD – a little over 10 million or about a fortieth of Givaudan's
expense. 
 
Profit before tax is 1871 million Hong Kong dollars on total sales of 2852 million HK dollars. That is 65
percent of sales and it compares (very) favorably with 13 percent at Givaudan of sales. 
 
Huabao gets superior margins – nay vastly superior margins – whilst doing much less R&D and
having much less selling expense. Truly miraculous. Givaudan – the putative technical leader –
should watch out. 
 
I wanted to work out what Huabao actually sold – what R&D they had – what technology they had that
justified their superior returns. Alas this was difficult. You see HBGlobal.com is not a very informative
website. 
 
Here – in pictures – is the page (yes one page) that describes their product set.

Compare this page to the very detailed  specification at Givaudan. HBGlobal does not even allow its
product specifications to be indexed on Google. (Go on – look at the page – it is pictures of text, not
text, and hence not indexed.) 
 
I went looking for all the chemicals in my wife's perfume on Alibaba. I could not find Huabao as a
supplier. Nor could I find HBGlobal. 
 
I googled “+Huabao. +citral” and the core reference I found was to Jishui Huabao Natural Medicated
Oil Factory being a buyer of citral. Similar results were obtained for other chemicals. 
 
I did this with lots of combinations of chemicals and the brand names they operated under (at least
the brand names they operated under according to the HBGlobal website). 
 
The website states that Kongque is a long established food additives brand in China. Kongque turns
up in one index as one of literally 40 pages of suppliers for food flavor additives. Here is their entry
which tells you nothing about them but gives a limited range of products (Lecithin, Foodstuff Essence,
Flavor, Collagen Protein, Stuff Additives, Trichloromethyl Sucrose, Crystalline Fruit Sugar, Phosphate,
Water-retaining). I have no idea what "stuff additives" are - and Trichloromethyl Sucrose is also a
strange product - according to some links a sweetener 8000 times as sweet as sugar - but I can't find
any non-Chinese references to it. Moreover this claim is likely false: saccharine is usually thought to
300-500 times as sweet as sugar and that is sweeter than most of the other standard sugar
substitutes. 
 
This tiny list of lightly specified products does not compare favorably to the sophisticated list at
Givaudan. 
 
For the life of me I can't work out what Huabao does that makes it so profitable – I can't work out what
chemicals it makes, what  products it sells and why it manages to do so with much less research and
development than Givaudan (or International Flavors and Fragrances). 
 
Still Huabao must be real. You see it is audited by Price Waterhouse Coopers, it is not a reverse
merger and it is listed on the Hong Kong Stock exchange – and we know that the HKSE is far more
honest than the reverse mergers in the US. Mr Charles Li, the CEO of the HKSE told us. 
 
So – if any of my readers know more about the flavors and fragrances business than you can get
from reading Wikipedia and a perfume label and looking at Alibaba will you let me know. 
 
Please. 
 
Meanwhile – on the basis I can't understand any of this I am short on behalf of my clients. Super-fat
margins in a chemical company almost devoid of research and development does not sound very
sustainable to me.

My readers are a clever lot – so if you can help me, or talk me out of this position I would be thrilled. 
 
Thanks in advance.

Post scripts: Some commentators have suggested that this company is a reverse merger - going
public via the back door in 2006. I have not checked. 
 
Also some commentators have suggested that Trichloromethyl Sucrose is the sweetener known in the
US under the brand name "splenda". The 8000 times as sweet as sugar statistic sort of matches - and
splenda has three chlorine atoms in the structure so cold be "trichloro" as per the name. But I am not
sure where the methyls (ie CH3s) come in. There is a structure illustrated here.

I had been told by an importer in the mid 2000's as much as 2/3rd of brand name
perfume in Australia was counterfeit.

Another interesting "fragrance company", if your interested, is Robertet SA. Unfortunately,
the company hasn't printed financials in English since 08 and, I believe, it doesn't trade in
big volume (my data is questionable so I am not sure).

A wild guess. 
 
"Like IFF it claims to be primarily a tobacco flavorant." 
 
There. Tobacco flavours being a mature business. You only have to sell to cigarette
manufacturers. The flavours have been around for years, the relationships are solid, so
low marketing and low research costs. 
 
However, this leaves the margin: why isn't anyone competing with them? IFF for
example?

On Huabao: 
I did some research on Huabao a few years back when it was hot, and ended up owning
some shares before it crashed a few months back. I didn't dig deep enough to know for
sure if the accounts of the firm were genuine, but the story worked like this: 
a) The company is the largest(near monopolistic) supplier of cigarette flavoring to most of
the big Chinese cigarette makers (all of which are state owned). This is where the
extraordinarily high and consistent profit margin comes from. 
b) it's unclear how the entrepreneurial founder/CEO came about this "golden goose". 
c) The company started to invest in food flavoring and fragrance business 5-6 years ago,
but there is not much to show for so far, as far as I can tell -- other than the Annual Report
has gotten a lot "greener" (literally, too). 
d) At least some of the acquisitions the company did since listing were buying unlisted
businesses related to the founder/CEO, at very high valuations. Also, the founder
periodically sold her holdings, and often the stock had run-up right before her sales. 
e) The company's recent decision to go into the more capital-intensive cigarette
manufacturing business (some sort of low-tar version, I think) was attributed by "the
Street" for its de-rating. 
f) The company did go public in Hong Kong via the back-door in 2006.

If the company is a fraud as the financials seem to suggest it is, why does it pay a
relatively large dividend? That would trouble me if I were short. One could argue that the
recent dividends have been financed with debt, but still, why let any cash leave the
company at all?

I suspect the IFF/Giv/Firmenich business model is very different from someone selling
commodity fragrances. 
 
Also I suspect the big fragrance houses are hideously run from a cost perspective, just
given the extremely high product gross margins, and oligopolisitic industry structure. 
 
This isn't to say the chinese thing isn't a fraud, just that comparing its P&L to Giv's might
not be that meaningful.

Trichloromethyl is a method for synthesis, its most common use (I would think) would be
a cheap way of making chemical weapons. I imagine its big in 3rd world countries who
want to synthesise liquid compounds for release into humid air. It's been a while since I've
done any sort of practical chemistry, but I'd imagine perfumes may use this kind of
technology, and I'd imagine this is a cheap way of doing this. 
 
Perhaps this company is a clever guise for chemical weapons business. Given the world
we live in, I'd be leaning long rather than short. 
 
One avenue of research might be to see if some of the previous R&D department heads
worked for arms programs (or general research) in China or elsewhere, this is a hunch
but it sounds like the type of people they'd hire to be a part of converting this chemicals
use into consumer products. They may just be using government cost-cutting tricks from
government weapons into consumer products and no one else has picked up on this
application yet, hence the margins.

John Hempton,  
 
How can you eliminate the possibility that they are following the usual Chinese business
model of stealing the IP from Western companies and using corrupt relationships to sell a
relatively commodity product to a few state-owned companies at inflated prices? However
seedy this scenario is, it's not a scenario in which the shareholders necessarily lose.

Grayleaf... yes, you are correct, Huabao primarily services tobacco clients (80%+
sales/EBIT). I met them back in 2007 and even then, they enunciated their strategy was
to focus on tobacco. They've benefited as the industry consolidated; that probably has
kept them afloat. While the rest of the world continues to make life difficult for smokers, in
China, smoking remains rampant. (All my ex-colleagues who worked in China smoked
like chimneys.) Check out another company I met during that period, 3318 (the much
smaller China Flavors & Frangrances, USD 575m mkt cap) which is still trading pretty
much at March 09 lows and no where near the lofty highs of 2007, having fared much
worse than Huabao. I did not like them because they could not explain the R&D process
and their patents satisfactorily; I suppose that without the consistent demand from

The fact they have dividend combined with a poorly described product makes me think
they might have a real business, and they don't want you to know what it is. Do they
make money by paying bribes for a monopoly supplier position to one or more state
owned enterprises? Do they sell illegal clone fragrances to facilitate the huge international
business in fake perfume, which copies every aspect of packaging and smell of the
original products? 
 
I did find it amusing that the subsidiary's About Us page shows a photo of an aircraft
carrier! Maybe there is a military or weapons connection after all:

Mr. Hempton 
As a avid reader of your blog, I have to say I am quite disappointed at this post. It has
been three months since your post on Charles Li's comment re frauds in the HKex, but
what you came up with is a fairly weak case for a short. There are much more rotten

I am not so sure that tobacco flavoring is a declining business. In some parts of the world
Chewing Tobacco or Smokeless Tobacco or Snuff (or many other names it is called) is a
growing business as far as I knew, which is why Atria bought UST a few years ago.
These Chewing tobacco comes in many bizarre flavors, and many ex-smokers are taking
up Chewing Tobacco to stop smoking. 
 
In norway and Sweden they use Snus still and it is sold in other parts of the world (US
also I believe), I have seen when I was in Norway some strange flavors like Mint and
Vanilla. Some of my colleagues in Norway were using this stuff several times a day. I
believe this is a growing business in Norway and the US also. 
 
Tobacco flavorings might be more lucrative than you think.

The 8000x sweetness claim (on the linked-to page) refers to Neotame, and is consistent
with its perceived sweetness reported elsewhere.  
 
"Trichloromethyl sucrose" looks to be a loosely-contracted non-technical name. It may be
tri-chlorinated O-methyl-sucrose, which would make it chemically very similar to Splenda.

if you want an interesting short candidate, have a look at Hidili (1393). If you look at the
fraud cases in Asia, very often, they have issued $ bonds and or convertible bonds. That
is because they need many ways to finance the negative free cash flow. Sinoforest and
Chaoda had both. So does Hidili.

Multinationals are not doing tobacco flavoring because of litigation issues. That is why the
margin is high. Also, once you sell a flavor to a tobacco co, you supply until that brand of
tobacco is discontinued. I'm not a smoker but smokers seem very loyal to a certain kind
of cigarettes. Brands won't change flavor until the line is discontinued. 
It may be more competitive to get new contracts but they should be ok with the ones they
have now.

If we had the same logic in fine dining you might receive a menu listing including "Ovis
Aries protein, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis" etc. Not quite the
same romantic connotation as a grilled organic lamb cutlet infused with rosemary oil, is it? 
 
2. Chanel is renowned for the very high quality of its fragrance ingredients:
