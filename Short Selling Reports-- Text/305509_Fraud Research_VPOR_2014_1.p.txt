Summary


The	company's	current	President	&	CEO	was	accused	of	breach	of	fiduciary	duty

Clear	violation	of	Exchange	Act	Section	10A(a)	in	tandem	with	the	resignation	of	the
company's	accountant.


Pathetic	financials	and	no	material	changes	lead	us	to	believe	that	shares	are
inflated	as	part	of	the	broader	marijuana	bubble	and	thus	will	pop.

An	Insolvent	and	Financially	Unsound	"Going	Concern"	Company


In	our	years	of	reading	financial	statements,	we	have	rarely	encountered	a	company
valued	at	$112	million	with	such	atrocious	financial	statements.	Vapor	Group	Inc.,	is
completely	insolvent,	with	minus-$442	cash	and	cash	equivalents	and	assets	totaling	just
more	than	$6,000.	With	such	few	liquid	assets,	it	will	be	virtually	impossible	for	this
company	to	raise	capital	via	debt	financing.	Therefore,	we	fully	expect	further	dilution	in
the	near	future	through	equity	financings.


About	The	Business


Vapor	Group,	Inc.	sells	e-cigarette	brands	and	specially	formulated	"Made	in	the	USA"	e-
liquids.	Testing	labs	are	FDA-registered,	and	products	are	sold	nationwide,	either	through
distributors	and	wholesalers	or	directly	to	consumers.	Those	products	are	marketed	under
the	Vapor	Group™,	Total	Vapor™,	Vapor	123™	and	Vapor	Products™	brands.	The
company's	e-cigarette	liquids	are	made	entirely	in	the	U.S.,	and	all	e-cigarettes	are
manufactured	with	lifelong	batteries.

According	to	the	company's	website,	electronic	cigarettes	are	not	just	a	healthier
alternative	to	smoking	tobacco	cigarettes	and	cigars	but	also	are	a	better	financial
alternative	as	well.	Propylene	glycol,	one	of	four	ingredients	found	in	e-cigarettes,	is
"generally	recognized	as	safe"	by	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA),	according	to	a
public	health	statement	summarizing	the	toxicological	profile	for	propylene	glycol.

The	market	for	e-cigarettes	continues	to	grow	rapidly.	Sales	more	than	doubled	to	$1.7
billion	in	2013	compared	to	the	year	prior	according	to	Bonnie	Herzog,	an	industry	analyst
for	Wells	Fargo	Securities.	We	remain	skeptical	about	the	company's	ongoing	ability	to
thrive	in	this	increasingly	competitive	marketplace	with	such	little	capital,	but	it	appears	to
have	forward-looking	intentions.	On	March	12,	2014,	the	company	announced
development	of	"The	Vapor	Box	TBH,"	which	vaporizes	dry	herbs	by	gently	heating	them
at	a	controlled	temperature	inside	a	heating	chamber.	One	would	assume	the	demand	will
increase	for	products	like	the	Vapor	Box	TBH	as	a	result	of	recent	legislative	changes	to
marijuana	use.	But	regardless	of	the	external	market,	the	company	will	fail	if	its
management	team	does	not	execute	the	business	plan.


Accusations	of	Securities	Fraud,	Inadequate	Disclosure	and	a	History	of	Failed
Public	Companies


Dror	Svorai,	SPLI's	president	and	chief	executive	officer,	founded	the	Vapor	Group,	Inc.	in
2012,	along	with	its	subsidiaries	Total	Vapor	Inc.,	Vapor	123	Inc.	and	Vapor	Products	Inc.
While	his	bio	suggests	Svorai's	past	experience	includes	serving	in	executive	positions,	it
fails	to	mention	anything	about	Case	No.	13-20190-CIV-GRAHAM/GOODMAN,	filed	in
U.S.	District	Court's	Southern	District	of	Florida.	In	that	case,	Svorai	was	accused	of
breach	of	fiduciary	duty	and	securities	fraud:


1.	Defendant	Dror	Svorai	and	Defendant	Jorge	Schcolnik	(collectively,	"Board
Defendants")	had	a	fiduciary	duty	to	shareholders	which	the	defendants	breached
through	their	intentional	misconduct.


2.	Defendant	Dror	Svorai	also	tried	to	create	an	untrue	employment	agreement	for	the
former	CEO,	Defendant	Haim	Mayan.


Dror	Svorai's	bio	published	in	an	8-K	dated	Jan.	22,	2014	also	fails	to	disclose	the	specific
executive	positions	he	previously	held.	Compare	Svorai's	bio	dated	Nov.	25,	2010	to	his
more	recent	one	dated	Jan.	22,	2014:

Specifically,	Svorai	failed	to	mention	that	he	was	a	former	president	and	chief	executive
officer	of	Green	LED	Technologies,	Inc.,	which	later	was	acquired	by	Hi	Score	Corp.
(OTC:HSCO).	We	are	convinced	that	Svorai	deliberately	omitted	his	involvement	with	Hi
Score	Corp.	because	HSCO	was	suspended	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission
on	Jan.	27,	2014	due	to	questions	"regarding	the	accuracy	of	publicly	available
information	about	the	company's	assets,	acquisitions,	business	activities,	control	persons,
securities	offerings,	and	financing	arrangements."


Svorai	also	has	acted	as	the	sole	officer	and	director	of	Inelco	Corp.	(OTC:INLC)	since
2010,	alongside	barred	attorney	Diane	D.	Dalmy,	who	had	charges	brought	against	her	in
2013	relating	to	a	pump-and-dump	scheme.	During	Svorai's	tenure	with	the	company,
Inelco's	shares	plunged	by	more	than	99	percent.


False	Representation	and	Violation	of	Section	10A(a)	of	the	Exchange	Act


On	Nov.	27,	2013,	Harris	F.	Rattray,	CPA	resigned	as	the	independent	registered	public
accounting	firm	for	SPLI.	According	to	a	Public	Company	Accounting	Oversight	Board
(PCOAB)	order	instituting	disciplinary	proceedings	in	the	matter	of	Harris	F.	Rattray,	dated
Nov.	21,	2013,	Rattray	was	barred	from	being	an	associated	person	of	a	registered	public
accounting	firm,	and	his	license	was	revoked.	Specifically,	Rattray	violated	Section	10(b),
Rule	10b-5	and	Section	10A(a)	of	the	Exchange	Act.	These	proceedings	were	in
connection	with	the	auditing	of	financial	statements	of	four	public	companies:	Patient
Portal	Technologies	Inc.	(OTCPK:PPRG),	AvWorks	Aviation	Corp,	Caribbean	Pacific
Marketing	Inc.	and	Urban	Ag	Corp.	(OTC:AQUM).


AvWorks	and	the	three	other	respondents	misrepresented	several	audited	financial
statements	as	having	been	conducted	in	accordance	with	PCOAB	standards.	In	doing	so,
all	four	public	companies	violated	Exchange	Act	Section	10A(a),	failing	to	include

procedures	designed	to	provide	reasonable	assurance	that	any	illegal	acts	having	a	direct
and	material	effect	on	the	determination	of	financial-statement	amounts	would	be
detected.


NVLX	Lost	50	Percent	after	Our	Warnings,	and	We	Believe	SPLI	May	Be	Next


Unfortunately	for	current	shareholders,	we	believe	the	recent	catalyst	for	the	surging	SPLI
share	price	is	marijuana	mania.	We	featured	Nuvilex,	Inc.	(NVLX)	in	a	previous	expose
and	warned	investors	of	the	dangers	of	holding	a	stock	in	the	midst	of	a	bubble.	Sure
enough,	within	48	hours	of	our	expose,	NVLX	shares	lost	nearly	50	percent.	It	is	our
opinion	that	SPLI	soon	will	have	a	similar	pullback.	Additional	marijuana	stocks	that
inflated	into	some	of	the	most	overvalued	stocks	on	Wall	Street	include	mCig,	Inc.
(OTCPK:MCIG),	Signature	Exploration	And	Production	Corp.	(SXLP)	and	Growlife,	Inc.
(OTCQB:PHOT).


Marijuana	mania	aside,	we	have	seen	better	financial	statements	for	companies	that	were
about	to	file	for	bankruptcy.	And	yet,	this	tiny	e-cigarette	company,	which	has	not	sold	a
significant	amount	of	product	to	date,	boasts	a	market	cap	of	more	than	$100	million.	We
believe	that	aside	from	the	business	barely	staying	afloat,	bigger	troubles	lie	at	the	top	of
the	organization	in	CEO	Dror	Svorai	and	his	checkered	past	relating	to	failed	penny-stock
dealings.	We	also	can	not	forget	the	company's	violation	of	Section	10A(a)	of	the
Exchange	Act	as	part	of	its	business	dealings	with	a	recently	barred	accountant.	These
are	very	serious	issues	and	despite	our	repeated	attempts	to	contact	the	company	by
phone	and	email,	we	have	never	received	a	response.	These	unanswered	red	flags,	along
with	an	obscene	valuation	which	no	rational	investor	would	take	seriously,	leave	us	no
choice	but	to	urge	investors	to	reconsider	owning	this	stock,	which	could	see	its	share
prices	slashed	in	half	at	any	moment.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	SPLI.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.
I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business
relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.
