Hi-Tech Pharmacal Set To Drop By 60% On Earnings And Fraud
Investigations
Nov. 29, 2012 9:13 AM ET35 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Hi-Tech Pharmacal (NASDAQ:HITK) is a $450 million market cap manufacturer of
prescription and OTC drugs. The company came public in 1992. It was founded by
Bernard Seltzer, and is now currently run by his sons, David Seltzer and the very colorful
and entrepreneurial Reuben Seltzer. The two now fill the roles of CEO, Chairman of the
Board, President, Vice Chairman and Director.


On the surface, Hi-Tech has many of the hallmarks of a very safe investment, including:


a strong cash balance with nearly $6 per share vs. $33.32 share price
an apparently low PE ratio of 11x (trailing 12 mos)
a presence in a stable, counter-cyclical industry
a high level of management ownership
over 50 different drug products currently in the portfolio


However, a closer look reveals that Hi-Tech Pharmacal is a company beset by significant
near-term problems from all directions. A notable lack of sell-side analyst coverage has
meant that the significance of these problems has not been widely disseminated or
understood by investors. Only one major sell-side brokerage covers the stock (Bank of
America), which reiterated an "underperform" rating when the stock was at $31.00,
however the coverage has been infrequent.


As soon as next week (when earnings are announced before market open on Thursday),
Hi-Tech shares are likely to begin a rapid descent of at least 20%-30% and could
subsequently stabilize at a level that is as much as 50%-60% below the current share
price of $33.32.


These problems facing Hi-Tech are all described in detail below and can be summarized
as follows:


over-dependence on a single drug, fluticasone (generic for Flonase), which generates
42% of revenue and nearly 70% of net income and which has very recently become
commoditized by additional new competitors, leading to a rapid and extreme collapse
in profitability. Based on statements from management, this decline is expected to
further accelerate in coming quarters.

a second lead product, dorzolamide, which accounts for more than 20% of sales is
also in rapid and steady decline, as described my management on the last conference
call.
as part of its Medicaid fraud investigation, the Attorney General for the state of Texas
recently sent Hi-Tech a "Civil Investigative Demand" investigating false reporting of
information to establish reimbursement rates for Medicaid. The Attorney General
recently demanded that Hi-Tech produce 50 categories of documents pertaining to
Medicaid drug pricing and sales by Hi-Tech.
this follows on the heels of a Massachusetts "whistleblower" civil action naming Hi-
Tech for violations of the Federal False Claims Act. The Massachusetts civil action
stated that the defendants knowingly submitted false records or statements causing
false claims to be made for unapproved or ineffective drugs, including Hi-Tech's
Lodrane. With Hi-Tech, 11 different drug products were identified with false claims
totaling $46 million. The civil action is seeking treble damages as well as civil
penalties.
Following the Massachusetts Civil Action, the FDA cited Hi-tech's Lodrane as an
"Unapproved Prescription Cough, Cold, and Allergy Product" and Hi-Tech was forced
to discontinue sales. Prior sales had amounted to over $19 million while losses on
discarded Lodrane inventory amounted to an additional $1 million.
in 2010, Hi-Tech received its second FDA warning letter, which stated that "your firm
manufactures a prescription drug without an approved application" and "you must
cease manufacturing and distributing all your unapproved new drug products." Then
again in 2011, Hi-Tech received an FDA Form 483 (which precedes a formal warning
letter) citing 7 "observations," which have not yet been disclosed in detail.
in the past 4 months alone, nearly $5 million of selling by a wide range of insiders
including David and Reuben Seltzer, additional members of senior management as
well as board members. Nearly $3 million of this selling came within the last 45 days,
after Hi-Tech's last earnings miss and at prices below the current share price.
zero management buying over the past 10 years , but a whopping $56 million in insider
selling ($28 million from Seltzer brothers alone)
"ownership recycling" whereby the Seltzers have simply awarded themselves options
on 815,000 new shares (shares worth $27 million) to maintain their ownership stake
despite selling $28 million in stock.
uneconomic related-party transactions where Hi-Tech has repeatedly invested millions
into unrelated and highly speculative ventures run by Reuben Seltzer, which have
ultimately failed, while expensing investments to Hi-Tech R&D

As a relatively under-followed and closely held stock, the current share price in no way
reflects the massive problems that are about to become visible at the company as soon as
next week when Hi-Tech releases earnings.


Oddly, some shareholders seem to hope that Hi-tech will eventually be acquired by a
larger player in the space. However massive ongoing stock sales by management totaling
nearly $5 million in the past 4 months alone make me believe that this is highly unlikely to
be in the works. An in fact, given that Hi-Tech's assets consist simply of the right to sell
existing generic drugs, there is very little rationale for any pharma company to pay any
type of premium to acquire these rights when it could simply acquire them on its own at no
premium.


At the risk of stating the obvious, the potential impact of the Medicaid fraud investigations
on the future of Hi-tech as a company far outweighs the impact of a single quarter's
results. However given that the earnings release will likely cause a significant drop in the
share price in just a few days, I will address that first below, followed by an analysis of the
implications of the fraud investigation.


Part I: Q3 earnings next week will be nothing short of catastrophic


Hi-Tech last released earnings on September 5. The stock had closed on the previous day
at $36.54, but upon announcement of a triple fumble by the company, the stock plunged
as much as 17% to as low as $30.20, closing down 10% at $32.77. The triple fumble was
a 15% decline in revenue, a 40% decline in net income and a 5 point drop in net margin,
even on the dramatically lower sales. Hi-Tech had previously traded as low $27.31.


Since that time, the share price has rebounded slightly to $33.32 even though all of the
issues contributing to the earnings collapse have actually gotten much worse rather than
better. In general, the stock appears to trade in line with other generic drug makers such
as Teva (NYSE:TEVA) and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL), such that when those stocks rebound,
Hi-Tech does as well, even when Hi-Tech's fundamentals are deteriorating.


Hi-Tech is scheduled to announce its next quarterly earnings next week on Thursday,
December 6, before the market opens. It does not require an exceptionally sophisticated
analysis to determine that earnings will once again be dismal, for the 5th quarter in a row.
Anticipation of this fact, along with uncertainty over the Medicaid fraud investigation may
well explain the heavy selling of shares, which has gone on by management as recently
as October, at prices within around 10% of the 52-week low for the stock.

Just because a company's earnings are in a steady and persistent downtrend is certainly
no guarantee that the trend will continue going forward. Instead it is of much greater
importance to try to understand the underlying reasons for the downtrend and how those
issues will evolve going forward. However, in trying to gain insight into Hi-tech's upcoming
earnings release a trend analysis is a simple and useful place to begin.


These numbers reveal several extremely negative trends, all of which paint a very clear
picture of the direction in which Hi-Tech is headed.


Revenue has effectively stagnated over the past 5 quarters
Net income has steadily declined in every single quarter, plunging 40% last quarter
alone. Relative to last year, net income is now down 57%.
In fact, EPS is now down by a slightly greater 58% due to the impact of additional
dilution coming from additional share grants to management during this time, even as
results have deteriorated massively.


Quarterly results Jul 12 Apr 12 Jan 12 Oct 11 Jul 11


Total Revenue $52.0 $61.3 $55.6 $56.9 $56.2


QoQ change -15.1% 10.2% -2.2% 1.2%


Gross Profit $25.3 $31.8 $30.7 $33.4 $33.2


QoQ change -20.5% 3.5% -8.0% 0.5%


Net income $6.0 $10.0 $10.8 $13.8 $13.8

EPS $0.44 $0.73 $0.79 $1.04 $1.05


QoQ change -39.7% -7.6% -24.0% -1.0%

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 5/24


Gross Margin 48.7% 51.9% 55.3% 58.7% 59.1%

Net margin 11.5% 16.3% 19.4% 24.2% 24.5%


QoQ change -4.8% -3.1% -4.8% -0.3%


Again, of much greater relevance is the underlying reasons why earnings have plunged so
dramatically and how the situation is likely to evolve going forward.


Hi-Tech derives fully 42% of its revenue from a single product, fluticasone. The price of
fluticasone has been subject to continuing downward pressure due to competition from
other generic manufacturers and the entrance to the market place of a 4th new competitor
selling fluticasone in early 2012. In addition, as competitors steal sales, Hi-tech's overall
sales of Fluticasone have declined, even as the margin shrinks dramatically.


In fact, while Hi-Tech's revenue is clearly heavily dependent on this single product, its net
income is in fact vastly more dependent on fluticasone due to the fact that each of Hi-
Tech's other product divisions are not even profitable. The profits from fluticasone are
needed to offset the losses in the other divisions and therefore account for well in excess
of 42% of Hi-Tech's profit. This can be seen from this disclosure included in the company's
latest 10Q, which details profit and loss per division. It should be kept in mind that
fluticasone is part of the "Hi-Tech" division.


Hi-Tech HCP ECR Other Total


2012


Net sales $45.9 $3.0 $3.1 - $52.0


Operating income $14.8 ($0.7) ($1.8) ($3.3) $9.0


2011


Net sales $49.0 $3.5 $3.7 - $56.2

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 6/24


Operating income $23.7 $0.3 ($0.2) ($2.9) $20.9


The table above reveals the following information.


Sales within the "Hi-Tech" division, (which consist mostly of fluticasone and
dorzolamide), account for 88% of total sales - meaning that the results of any of the
other divisions are really just a rounding error to the financial results of Hi-Tech the
company.
Both sales and operating income fell substantially for each of the four divisions without
exception, including the "Hi-Tech" division.
The "Hi-Tech" division is now the only profitable division of the four, with the other
three divisions losing a combined $5.2 million in just the past quarter alone.
For the "Hi-Tech" division, operating income fell by 38%, while for the other three
divisions, losses increased by 105%


Hi-Tech does not give earnings guidance, however it did disclose on its conference call
that:


We anticipate growth across our leading health care products, OTC product lines,
and sales from the re-launch of Nasal Ease, the homeopathic allergy reliever.
Additionally, we will get a full year of sales from our newly acquired Sinus Buster
products, which we purchased in March. These factors will contribute to a double-
digit growth rate for this division.


But again, this "double digit growth" is coming from a division that only accounts for just
3%-5% of sales.


The numbers above help to illustrate the disproportionate overdependence of Hi-Tech's
net income of fluticasone and dorzolamide. For the past quarter, Hi-Tech's total sales fell
by just 7% however total net income fell by 40%.


When that happened, the stock quickly dropped by as much as 17%, but has bounced
back slightly. Yet we have already been told that this exact same phenomenon is going to
be repeated with fluticasone sales and margins, so further dramatic stock price declines
should actually be entirely expected.


On the quarterly conference call it was explicitly noted that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 7/24


We expect to see continued declines on our top selling Fluticasone product as a
result of the additional competitor which came on the market in January


Other products which were acquired in 2011 and launched since that time have helped to
slightly offset some of the dramatic declines in the two lead products, however their slow
rate of market adoption and their tiny size relative to fluticasone and dorzolamide have
kept their contribution to the overall bottom line negligible.


However the launch of an undisclosed "mystery product" has now been delayed from
December 2012 until February 2013 at the earliest, meaning that any revenue bump we
might see from the "mystery product" will likely not be felt until late 2013 at the earliest.


The importance of the product / revenue mix simply cannot be overstated.


Even if we assume just a 5%-10% drop in fluticasone revenues (which is likely
conservative), we can expect to see EPS drop to just $0.30-$0.35, once again a 30% drop
in just one quarter.


The continued drop in sales of dorzolamide will further exacerbate this, but to a lesser
extent that fluticasone.


From a valuation standpoint, this "new normal" of EPS becomes extremely critical.


In looking at historical 12 month EPS, Hi-Tech appears to trade on a PE of roughly 11x,
which would be expected for a company in the highly commoditized business of selling
generic pharmaceuticals.


However in the same way that PE is misleading for high growth companies (where we
must use a PE-growth metric), PE is also misleading for companies such as Hi-tech, who
are in steady decline.


The historical 12 months PE calculation includes the following EPS numbers.


Jul 12 Apr 12 Jan 12 Oct 11 TTM Total


EPS $0.44 $0.73 $0.79 $1.04 $3.00


Decline % -39.7% -7.6% -24.0% -1.0%
5/22/2018 Hi-Tech Pharmacal Set To Drop By 60% On Earnings And Fraud Investigations - Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. (NASDAQ:HITK) | Seeking…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 8/24


So Hi-Tech has earned $3.00 per share over the past 12 months, resulting in a PE vs. the
current price of 11x. However even if we normalize that PE ratio going forward at $0.44, as
was reported last quarter, the resulting PE over four quarters jumps to almost 20x
earnings, implying that at these prices investors would require some type of substantial
growth going forward, rather than steady decline.


And in reality, with both revenue and net income from fluticasone and dorzolamide in
steady decline, if we normalize at a more realistic $0.30 per share (which we will almost
certainly see next Thursday), the PE ratio jumps to nearly 30x earnings, which is clearly
downright absurd for any commodity generic drug maker.


As this materializes, then a medium-term correction in the share price of at least 50%-60%
should become entirely expected. And in the very near term (immediately following the
earnings report), a share price drop of 20%-30% should be in no way surprising.


Based on sustainable quarterly EPS of $0.30-$0.40, Hi-Tech would be expected to trade
somewhere around $12.00-$16.00.


Hi-Tech has made a number of substantial (and very expensive) efforts to diversify into
other product areas, including into higher margin branded (non-generic) pharmaceuticals.
As highlighted by management, the expected bright spots include Tussicaps, Nasal Ease,
Sinus Buster, Dexpak and Bupap which should in fact show some revenue growth.
However, as we can see from the table above, each of the other product divisions remains
entirely unprofitable and the overwhelming dominance of fluticasone in their product mix
ensures us that no amount of success (even massive success) from any other product will
offset the steady decline in revenues and profits from fluticasone.


Part II: Medicaid (and possibly Medicare) fraud investigations have the potential to
take the stock to single digits, a decline of more than 60%


In 2010, Hi-Tech and a subsidiary were named in a Massachusetts "whistle-blower" civil
action alongside a number of other drug companies including Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT),
Mylan Inc , Teva Pharmaceuticals and Watson (WPI). As shown, the civil action states that
the defendants "knowingly provided false information" in order to received inflated
reimbursement from Medicaid and seeks triple damages along with additional civil
penalties. Hi-Tech drug products identified as being submitted with false information
totaled $46 million for 11 different products. In a revised complaint, Hi-Tech notes that its
subsidiary was no longer named, only Hi-Tech itself.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 9/24


Now, in June 2012, the Texas Attorney General initiated a separate civil action requiring
Hi-Tech to preserve and produce all documents across 50 categories in connection to its
Medicaid fraud investigation regarding price submissions for drugs to Medicaid.


Obviously it is important to note that there is nothing unique about the legal environment in
Massachusetts, or Texas, nor is there anything unique about Hi-Tech's specific business
practices in those states. So it seems quite safe to assume that the issues being raised in
Massachusetts and Texas should be equally applicable to all 50 states and to the federal
Medicare program as well.


In other words, Massachusetts, and Texas, should likely be viewed not as the only states
taking action against Hi-Tech, but instead are just the first states taking action against Hi-
Tech.


As a point of reference, Forest Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Forest Labs (NYSE:FRX)
paid over $313 million when it settled a similar whistle-blower suit under the False Claims
act. And earlier this year, generic drug maker Actavis settled for $118 million for inflating
drug prices for reimbursement. The point is simply that when the dollar amounts are large
and triple damages become involved, the potential settlements can be enormous.


For those who are not familiar with the situation, Medicare/Medicaid fraud by drug
companies (both large and small) has been downright rampant for years. The government
seems to be unable to muster the resources to properly monitor and enforce the program
on its own, and for a long time, submitting inflated prices to Medicare and especially
Medicaid was very easy and seemed to carry no consequences. In an effort to combat this
widespread abuse of the system, the Federal and State Governments have implemented
a massive incentive for "whistle-blowers" to come forward with information regarding
fraudulent practices by drug companies. The results for government prosecutors (and for
whistle-blowers) have been nothing short of spectacular.


Under the "False Claims Act", the whistle-blower can typically receive 15%-25% of the
amount that the government recovers from a fraud case against a drug maker, and the
recent settlements have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars, creating a massive
incentive for future whistle-blowers to come forward as well. And as would be expected, a
wide variety of law firms have now sprung into action to specialize in handling these
whistle-blower cases. Whistle-blowers have now received an estimated $3-4 billion in
recovery money from False Claims Act lawsuits.

Not surprisingly, both the number and sizes of the whistle-blower cases are increasing
sharply each year. In their 2012 Mid-Year False Claims Act Update, law firm Gibson Dunn
states that,


Since January 2009, we have noted a nearly 50% increase in the number of new
whistleblower matters filed with the Department of Justice (DOJ), along with FCA
recoveries exceeding $11 billion. More than 760 new FCA matters were initiated in
2011, and 2012 is (not surprisingly) on pace to be the largest recovery year of
all time.


During the first half of 2012, several other state lawmakers introduced bills to enact
or expand false claims laws, which bills remain in various stages of the legislative
process.


Gibson Dunn predicts a tremendous increase in state false claims activity as
state attorneys general and private plaintiffs begin to take full advantage of
these laws.


The incidents in Massachusetts, and Texas, do not appear to be isolated problems for Hi-
Tech. In fact, just over the past two fiscal years, Hi-tech has had a series of run-ins with
the FDA, and Medicare/Medicaid through the Federal government and several individual
states. Even though some of these problems appear to ultimately have been resolved
from a legal standpoint, the financial consequences ran into the tens of millions for Hi-tech
due to forced discontinuation of products.


In just the past two fiscal years, Hi-Tech has had the following regulatory and legal
conflicts which are still outstanding:


The Texas Attorney General has recently submitted a demand that Hi-Tech produce 50
categories of documents relating to price submissions to Medicaid in that state. Hi-
Tech has simply disclosed that "The Company has no estimate at this time of its
potential exposure and cannot, at this time, predict the outcome of this matter".
Hi-Tech was named in a Massachusetts "whistle-blower" lawsuit stating that Hi-Tech
and other defendants "knowingly provided false information" in order to obtain
Medicaid reimbursement on 11 different drug products which resulted in $46 million in
Medicaid sales. Hi-Tech later disclosed that the allegations against Hi-tech's subsidiary
had been removed, but not against Hi-Tech itself. Hi-Tech has disclosed that "The
Company cannot predict the outcome of the action".

Likewise, Hi-Tech's Midlothian division received a subpoena from the Inspector
General from the Federal Department of Health and Human Services demanding
production of business records relating to Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements for
certain drugs. Again, Hi-tech has disclosed that "The company has no estimate at this
time of its potential exposure and cannot, at this time, predict the outcome of this
matter."
Again in 2010, a complaint was filed in California naming Hi-tech in another "whistle-
blower" lawsuit under a federal False Marketing Statute. Hi-Tech settled the lawsuit by
paying an undisclosed sum.
In 2011, Hi-Tech was named in the FDA's Medwatch publication as selling products
(three different Lodrane products) without FDA approval, with the result that these
products had to be discontinued. Sales of Lodrane had amounted to $19.1 million in
revenues for Hi-Tech in fiscal 2011 and early fiscal 2012, and now amount to zero. In
addition, Hi-Tech had to take an additional reserve of nearly $1 million for obsolete
inventory related to the discontinued Lodrane.
Hi-Tech was also the recipient of an FDA Warning Letter which cited the company for
certain unnamed drugs being sold without FDA approval with the result that these
drugs also needed to be discontinued. Sales had previously stood at $5 million and
now amount to zero, while an additional $865,000 in inventory again had to be written
off.
Again in 2011, Hi-Tech received another FDA Form 483 (which typically precedes a
formal warning letter) citing 11 undisclosed "observations". Hi-Tech has responded in
writing but there has been no closure of the issue by the FDA after a full year.


It is odd that despite this long history of expensive legal and regulatory problems Hi-Tech
disclosed on its last conference call:


In August, the current quarter, we introduced Paregoric USP to the market. The
product is unapproved; however, the FDA is aware that this being marketed for
use in drug shortage and it is being reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid. We are
currently the only company marketing this product and believe it will be a good
contributor to this year's generic business.


Because Paregoric contributes only a tiny percentage of generic sales, the risk of
continuing to be the "only company this product" without FDA approval seems to arguably
outweigh the small amount of revenue it will generate relative to the repercussions that
this activity could have in the near term.

Part III: History of the Seltzer family fiefdom with Hi-Tech


Hi-Tech was founded in 1982 by Bernard Seltzer. When the company decided to go public
in 1992, Bernard Seltzer appointed his two sons, David and Reuben, as board members,
who then later evolved into management figures as well. The two brothers now
simultaneously fill all the roles of CEO, Chairman of the Board, President, "Vice Chairman"
and director of Hi-Tech. After serving for a stint as an associate at Hi-tech itself, a third
brother, Steven Seltzer, has been responsible for "business development" for their other
company, Marco Hi-Tech, in which Hi-Tech owns a 17% stake.


In years past, Reuben Seltzer was not particularly involved in Hi-Tech Pharmacal. Instead,
he seemed to be focused on replicating the Hi-Tech model by taking a big stake in a small
venture and then taking it public via reverse merger. Notably, Reuben Seltzer even chose
to copy the naming convention used by his father, and named his new ventures Marco Hi-
Tech and Neuro Hi-Tech.


Although not even an employee of Hi-Tech Pharmacal, Reuben Seltzer did act as a
"consultant on special projects" to the company, in order to broker millions of dollars worth
of investment by Hi-Tech Pharmacal into his own companies. As shown below, each of
these ended up losing substantial amounts (up to 99%) of the principal. In exchange for
these "consulting services", Reuben Seltzer was paid six figure consulting fees by his
brother at Hi-Tech Pharmacal. Hi-Tech also picked up the tab for his automobile allowance
and health insurance.


Reuben's Seltzer's first attempt was with Marco Hi-Tech, which was to specialize in
"neutraceutical" healthcare products such as green tea from China. Here Reuben Seltzer
assumed the role of CEO and President. Hi-Tech Pharmacal ended up investing in Marco
Hi-tech, buying a 23.3% stake in the company as a "joint venture" despite the unrelated
nature of the business. Hi-Tech then signed a guarantee of up to $1.5 million in debts for
Marco Hi-Tech. At the time, Reuben Seltzer owned an identical 23.3% stake.


Hi-Tech's stake in "Marco Hi-Tech" has now declined to just 17% and over the years Hi-
Tech has never realized any material income from the "joint venture". In 2011, this
investment resulted in a loss for Hi-Tech Pharmacal of $174,000 and by 2012, the carrying
value of the entire investment was down to just $213,000.


Marco Hi-Tech's only notable publicity seems to stem from an incident where it was sued
by Pfizer in the U.S. District Court of New York. According to the lawsuit, Reuben Seltzer's
Marco Hi-Tech actually forged a "letter of certification" from the Jewish Orthodox Union,
the leading U.S. kosher-approval group, in order to state that its products were Kosher.

5/22/2018 Hi-Tech Pharmacal Set To Drop By 60% On Earnings And Fraud Investigations - Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. (NASDAQ:HITK) | Seeking…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 13/24


According to the lawsuit, Orthodox Union letterhead was used to make it seem Marco's
grape-seed extract had received the group's stamp of approval, and was then sold to
Pfizer. Pfizer ultimately reassured consumers that none of Marco's products ever made it
into any Pfizer products, which were being sold as Kosher.


Marco Hi-Tech was ultimately combined into a reverse merger which completed a public
offering as a newly formed "Neuro Hi-Tech", whose business was unrelated to both Marco
Hi-Tech and to Hi-Tech Pharmacal. Reuben Seltzer was CEO and director. The company
raised over $4 million in a private placement, but went bust within 2 years and now trades
on the pink sheets as NHPI.PK for just $0.0003. As expected, Hi-Tech Pharmacal again
invested in the going-public private placement. Hi-Tech still owns its stake in Neuro Hi-
Tech, however the stake is now worth just $15,000 down from its peak of over $7.8 million.


For Reuben's most recent (and third) venture, EMET, Hi-Tech has already invested over
$7 million, but this time Hi-Tech has oddly expensed it as R&D even despite explicitly
describing this activity as "developing a generic product outside of its area of expertise".
Hi-Tech continues to invest more each year in the EMET venture, despite originally
stepping up for a large 50% stake.


Until 2009, Reuben Seltzer was not a direct employee of Hi-Tech at all, but instead was a
simply a consultant on "new business development," where he was paid six-figure
consulting fees to broker the deals into his own companies. However, following the
implosion of Neuro Hi-Tech, in 2010 Hi-Tech formally hired Reuben to fill the somewhat
ambiguous role of "Vice Chairman" at Hi-Tech. Since 2009, he has already received nearly
$5 million in direct compensation, and has personally sold over $6.3 million in stock which
he had been awarded in options. $11.3 million certainly seems like a very attractive
payday for three years of serving as "Vice Chairman" of his brother's company.


He has sold 295,000 shares since his employment began, but has received additional
options on 220,000 new shares during that time. Most recently, in October 2012 he sold
an additional $1 million in stock, however he has already be awarded options on 100,000
new shares ($3.4 million worth of stock) in 2012 alone. He continues in his role as "Vice
Chairman" today.


Part IV: "Ownership recycling" - Insiders have already sold over $56 million in
stock, but management has simply given itself options on additional Hi-Tech shares
to maintain ownership during this time.


The Form 4 filings by David Seltzer, Reuben Seltzer and Hi-Tech Pharmacal tell the story
in a concise 1 page way for each party involved.

5/22/2018 Hi-Tech Pharmacal Set To Drop By 60% On Earnings And Fraud Investigations - Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. (NASDAQ:HITK) | Seeking…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1035131-hi-tech-pharmacal-set-to-drop-by-60-percent-on-earnings-and-fraud-investigations 14/24


As shown in the links above, David Seltzer has sold 561,250 shares of Hi-Tech to realize
proceeds of just over $15 million. During this time he has never purchased a single share,
however he has awarded himself options on precisely 500,000 shares, effectively
maintaining his ownership despite the $15 million cash-out.


Meanwhile Reuben Seltzer has sold 477,001 shares of Hi-Tech, bringing him $13 million
in proceeds. During this time he has also never purchase a single share of Hi-Tech stock,
but instead has been awarded 315,000 shares via options, again helping to maintain his
ownership stake in Hi-Tech despite his 8 figure monetization. (Note, the only stock
purchase Reuben Seltzer has ever reported on Form 4 was for $100,000 of Neuro Hi-
Tech, the pink sheet traded company in which Hi-Tech invested and which now trades at
$0.0003).


Also as shown in the links above, additional members of management and the board have
also been heavy sellers, including Jack Van Hulst (director), William Peters
(NASDAQ:CFO), Kamel Egbaria (Chief Scientific Officer), Gary April (President, HCP
division), and Martin Goldwyn (director).


Together these insiders have also sold nearly $3 million stock just this year alone, while
never having purchased a single share at any time.


All told, despite having only 12 million shares outstanding, Hi-Tech has awarded insiders
over 400,000 shares worth of new options in 2012 alone, despite the 40% plunge in net
income and stagnating sales which have been witnessed.


Conclusion:


Hi-Tech Pharmacal had a very profitable one-hit wonder with fluticasone for several years,
allowing it to record revenue as well as profits, and propelling the stock into the $40-$50
range. However the "new normal" for Hi-Tech is one in which it must rely on its broader
portfolio of lesser selling drugs to generate sales and profits. Hi-Tech will undoubtedly
generate meaningful sales, and eventually some level of profit, from these other drug
products and in the future the company may once again achieve a decent level of
profitability. In addition, over time new product launches may help to begin an eventual
growing of revenue once fluticasone finally bottoms out and stabilizes.


In the meantime, Hi-Tech is likely to see a period of several years where quarterly EPS in
only in the $0.25-$0.50 range, which only justifies a share price in the $10-$18 range, at
least 30%-60% below the current levels even if there is no fallout from the Medicaid fraud
investigations that are now ongoing or from the FDA's latest Form 483 issued to Hi-Tech.

Comments (35)


The consequences of the outstanding FDA issues, whistle blower lawsuits and Medicaid
fraud investigations remain to be seen. However at the current price of $33.32 the share
price is clearly not factoring in the reasonable risk of tens or hundreds of millions in
payouts by Hi-Tech or of the risk to revenue that Hi-Tech products could be excluded from
Medicare / Medicaid in the near future. If these events do materialize in any meaningful
way, then the real downside in Hi-Tech stock becomes difficult to gauge, but certainly a
share price in the single digits would suddenly not become at all unreasonable.


The stock is under-followed by research analysts and tends to trade along with the
fortunes of larger, unrelated generic drug makers. As a result, it will almost certainly take
some sort of catalyst before Hi-Tech begins its rapid descent.


The most likely catalyst for this sharp drop will be when earnings are released on
Thursday, December 6, before the market opens and I expect to see the share price drop
by at least 20-30% at that time.

"It does not require an exceptionally sophisticated analysis to determine that earnings will once again be dismal, for
the 5th quarter in a row."


You may be right on this, but it would be a stronger argument if you had some data to back it up. Have you done any
meaningful channel checks on sales of HITK's products, or are you simply assuming the trend will continue?

Previous day put activity (11/28/2012) is about 400 puts traded ($0.4 to $0.5), strike $30, Dec 22, 2012 expiration. Not
sure it this was for hedging or pure short play. Either way it appears that the thesis played out just as the article
suggests in a day, even before the earnings.

Do you find the put activity and this article to be pure coincidence? You may want to note the volume level as well.


I believe RP may have learned a thing or two from Muddy. Not a bad write-up or outcome here for the bears. I'd stay
short into the mid 20s.

I was going to sell one of my long positions of HITK when it reached my fair value calculation of 45/share.
However, since you stressed that they were about to miss big on their earnings and had evidence of big
insider selling I unloaded my high shares at 23/share to lessen my blow. The very next day they announced
their special dividend of 1.50 per share and today they completely blew up your theory about their earnings
miss. You're a freaking amateur! I knew I should have stuck to my calculations. You cost me about $500 USD.
If you don't know what the hell you're talking about then stay off the boards. Shame on Seeking Alpha for
even letting you post.

So you're short and the company announces a $1.50 special dividend, You don't really address their deep pipeline of
products at FDA awaiting approval. Clearly there are issues with management and corporatge governance here but
not sure it is as bad as you try to state. Will be watching to see if earnings theory plays out.

I have been following this since reading the article (and observe some statements by management that appear to at
least partially mitigate the company's immediate concerns). It makes sense that the share price is appreciating with
the special dividend announcement. Maybe the time to look for an ideal entry point to sell it short would be tomorrow,
the day before earnings?

of this because fundamentally the short thesis still seems quite interesting...

Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for the comment.


As I said below, this earnings "beat" was the result of two small miracles - Flonase sales went slightly up
rather than slightly down. As I said in article, bottom line is ultra sensitive to flonase sales. The other surge
(over 50%) in sales of a single product was a one time event ahead of a price increase. Neither of these
events are likely to reoccur, so mgmt needs to find 2 new miracles in 90 days.


Rather than deliver the worst qtryl eps in 3 years, HITK delivered the 2nd worst eps in 3 years. Doesn't seem
inspirational to me, but it means we need to wait until next Q to find out....even though stock is very pricey
even at current levels.


As Adam said above, short thesis still in tact, just needs to wait a bit longer than i had expected.

of October 29th, which delayed some sales. Next quarter will benefit, and in the cc Hitk said that there was some nice
demand for flonase in mid-November.


Unfortunately, Pearson should be more careful when he uses the term "fraud". Some innocents might have been hurt
by his article if they relied upon it. I would even suggest that a fair amount of "fraud" accusations are very old and
were disclosed timely. And for Pearson to say that another complaint against a company (Forest Pharm) is "similar"
implies significant knowledge of the complaint and the actual facts - items that I doubt that Pearson truly investigate or
had actual knowledge of (although I am truly speculating on such doubts, not stating them as facts).


Do I have problems with insider sales of stock - absolutely, although I would suggest that the amounts he stated as
sales are lesser than stated or include options exercised or do not include some retention of options exercised and
not sold. Further, they may include some sales in 2010, after the dismal 2009 for all stocks including hitk when (in
2010) hitk recovered very nicely and some may have wanted to protect their families finances in the future.


Is Reuben Seltzer "colorful" - most likely, and I would tend to blame him on some of the bad investments of hitk
(although I am still speculating), and maybe he might have been responsible for some winners too (again, I am
speculating).


Mr. Pearson put a lot of people through some real anxiety, and those who sufferred but held on are being rewarded
today (at least for the moment).


06 Dec 2012, 10:39 PM


Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  the anxiety is well deserved and a one day short squeeze does nothing to change that.


you also are concerned about insider sales and destructive self dealing investments. although I think you should be
more concerned about the fraud investigations. maybe they end up as absolutely nothing, but the fact that there are
on going lawsuits and investigations is not being factored in at this price.


in fact even without any fraud issues, we can see that the company is wildly over valued based on these earnings
which were simply less bad than expected.


when I wrote about HITK the stock was at $33, now it is at $35 due to a short squeeze, so not exactly a ringing
rejection of the problems at the company or the over valuation.


HITK trades very thinly, which means that most of the time it does not move much at all. but when it does (like post
earnings) it moves pretty big. the downside moves can be just as big as the upside moves. so this will be an
interesting stock going forward.


the likely catalyst downward probably doesn't come until next earnings now, unless their are further developments
from TX, Mass, or elsewhere.


in any event, there isn't much else to make the stock go up from here, so this remains a very good short over the next
few weeks and months, in my opinion.

I appreciate you responding to my comments, but I will respond to yours again.


At this time it is just not one day of short covering, but two. And yes there have been insider sales, but many
companies have insider sales, ban these are not rich people in the first instance, I believe that many are just
hardworking people trying to keep their head above water, and my review of the past year indicates that the
Seltzers, on one occasion, exercised significant options, but did not sell any stock.


Again, I would be careful in using the term "fraud". In Massachusetts, there is a civil action concerning "unfair
trade practices", a fraud type statute, and any plaintiff would be committing malpractice if they didn't include
some allegations asserting fraud.


And it is not trading at 35, but now over 36, approaching 37 at one point. And it dropped to the 20's as a result
of your harsh article. so it really has bumped up nearly 20%. And on good volume. I would be careful about
arguing that you are right so far.


And they have had good volume in the past two days.


The FDA letter was addressed many moons ago, and hitk has had no adverse actions since address
themselves.


Be very careful with your allegations of fraud. I didn't see you writing any articles about Merk when they had
to pull their pain relieving drug in 2004.

Remember- you said 60% drop WITH EARNING-company blew out earning and stock is 36$ not 20$. How about
nobody wants to hear your opinion on anything-That was worst report i have seen in 20 years-not even close.

Why all this euphoria? Solid results? If you compare them to the dramatic last quarter yes, but yoy revenue is flat,
EPS dramatically down and no sign of a turnaround. Sales of their most important product were down again and one
can wonder where this bleeding will stop and how they'll manage to enlarge margins again. Apparently they often
have to give price reductions to get their products sold, which is not surprising in a very competitive sector. 
Better than expected is not the same as solid, especially when estimates are extremely low. 
And what about the dividend. As far as I know HITK hasn't paid a dividend in recent years, but now after a negative
article on SA, out of the blue, as a deus ex machina, appears a "special dividend"! Has management suddenly turned
shareholderfriendly? I don't think so. They only intended to support the shareprice, which had gone down severely
down after mr. Pearson's article, and they succeeded. So now they're not only cashing in on this dividend, but will be
able to sell their shares again at a higher price. 
BTW, I have heard nothing about a recurring dividend... I wonder where the shareprice will be heading once the
support of the "special dividend" has gone. 
Sure, mr. Pearson was overenthusiastic when he predicted the shareprice would go down by 60%, but I still think he's
right fundamentally. There are to many dark clouds hanging over this company and there's no justification for this

valuation. There are better and safer investments on the market. 
Disclosure: I allready was short HITK , shorted it again near it's Friday's high and will short it once again if the price
keeps going up. 
Stupid? Perhaps, but at least I put my money where my mouth is, which can not be said of management! Why did
they keep selling shares in the wake of quarterly results they knew or should have known were "solid"?? 
Oh yes, perhaps they also should change their name, because now they sound too much like a Chinese reverse
merger scam...(not implying that they àre a scam)

Author’s reply »  My call was for down 20-30% on earnings with the rest to be realized over time. I was not predicting
a 60% drop on earnings.


In any event, my prediction was mostly based on my expectation that HITK woluld report their worst quarterly EPS in
roughly 3 years.


Instead, HITK pulled two rabbits out of their hat. Flonase sales were better (less bad) than expected and there was a
one time surge in sales of a single product due to advanced buying ahead of a price increase. Neither is
sustainable....and the result from these dual rabbits was that instead of reporting the worst EPS in 3 years...HITK
reported the 2nd worst in 3 years.


Is that reason for joy ?


People who piled on to this trade (myself included) were expecting a fast and easy payday on earnings. When that
didn't happen, may shorts continued to cover. Looking at the volume, we can see this to be the case over the
following 2 days.


HITK will continue to have a revenue stream and net income, the problem is simply that the valuation at over $30 is in
no way justified.


The fraud issues are a wild card, they may amount to nothing or they may prove very costly. We won't know until the
news hits. But this too is not being factored into the price, and thank you, because Merck is a good example of this.

So Rick you are adding to your shorts and have zero plans to cover ever?

I believe you should cover your short position.........


You have not convinced me that HITK will drop 20-30%.....

As the price performance shows thus far, the stock has RISEN lately and it is at $36. I think you must have been
burned a lot.....

I actually owe Richard Pearson an apology because I made an error. I read the complaint and the company report (I
wonder if Richard Pearson read either) – it did not include a Massachusetts statutory fraud claim. But a review of the
documents do show that it took the whistle blower until the 7th Corrected/Amended complaint to name hitk, that the
10th amended complaint dropped a subsidiary of hitk from the action, and that the U.S. government has declined to
intervene against all of the more than 25 defendants except one (query, if the whistle blower commenced this action
to benefit the U.S., why isn’t it taking a role). By the way, Richard Pearson should be filing naming Mylan, Watson,
Teva, and a host of other large companies as companies participating in “fraud” because they are also named as
defendants in the Whistle blower’s complaint in Mass.


Now Mr. Pearson is backtracking. He did not say hitk was going to fall 60% immediately. Well, actually he said a
“rapid descent of 20 -30%, and could subsequently stabilize at a level that is as much as 50 – 60% below the current
share price of 33.32.” He even suggests that the current price of 36 isn’t much over 33. Well, hitk has increased over
5 dollars from its preannouncement of 31 (nearly 20%), and if you use the 29 which hitk hit after Pearson’s article, its
more than 30%. And his 50 – 60 really wasn’t long term, it suggests a more immediate decrease.


Instead, he blames more slight of hand. Well, maybe Mr. Pearson should be more careful about making allegations
based upon allegations and items fully disclosed. Maybe he should really investigate and read documents. Maybe he
should understand that hitk may just have a base of about 60 cents of profits a quarter, and that translates into less
than a 15 pe ratio at this time, and that this is a very respectable pe ratio.


I'm not saying that hitk is perfect (and he will jump up and down saying that such a concession means I agree with
him). There have been delays, miscaculations, and errors in judgment. But they have built a nice little company that
has expanded nicely and has significant potential if it continues to grow.

Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yes, thank you for agreeing with me.


I don't disagree that they have built a nice little company. However their big run with flonase is over which has left
them tremendously over valued.


This stock is not too volatile between earnings, so this will be a slow trade rather than a quick trade, but into the $20's
we will go.


Anyone long this stock will need to realize that they pulled off two small miracles to make earnings this past quarter.
Which is fine, and congrats to hitk. But in order to make earnings next Q they will once again need a couple of
miracles. Maybe it will happen...again. Then again maybe not.


Any bets on whether or not Seltzers sell more shares now that stock is at $36 ?

Just curious.


Either way, good luck with your trade.

The article got my attention enough to examine the conference call prior to this earnings release; however, I
have not reviewed HITK's most recent Report. The information recorded below only consists of things that to
me have made a case against shorting the stock. Maybe you would care to address each here or in a
different article, "e." below in particular?


a. Currently has 14 products awaiting FDA approval and 20 additional products in active
development...clinical...


b. Launch of NasalEase


c. Increased sales over Bupap and Dexpak line and more recently acquired TussiCaps and Orbivan
(TussiCaps will have a much stronger year in sales...more opportunity to train sales representatives)


d. Successful launch of newest Zostrix hot and cold therapy, including the two leading drug chains in the
country [WAG & CVS?]


Analyst Q&A: 
e. CEO David Seltzer says revenue can be expected to be above $230 million...Williams Peters CFO,
definitely second half loaded.


f. Four more unit dose products to the market this fiscal year...enough product launches and pipeline for good
to decent year. [later four products requiring clinical trials at least a year out].


g. Margins recently hurt by one time pricing promotions.


h. Cost cutting and efficiencies for second half of year margin expansion.

And thank you for agreeing with me.


I don't think that the Seltzer's will be selling any more stock for a couple of years. And I add this. Although
they sold some stock recently (and maybe that is wise given some tax issues), they last sold stock in 2010. If
you remember, that was when the stock was in the 20's, the companies price had dipped into the single digits
at the height of the 2009 panic, and I can't really blame them for taking some money off the table if that is
going to give their family some security.


I also add that they exercised some options in the last year, and did NOT sell any of it. They easily could
have, particularly in order to pay for it. Give them some credit.

Others may have sold stock too - but these are not rich people - they work hard, and sometimes deserve
security. I do wish they would all keep their stock/options (one company which I once had stock in required
management to buy stock on loans in order for them to keep their long term conscience), but these are not
simply issues.


Yes, the mystery product delay bothers me - and prior delays of others also bothered me (i.e., zolpimist), but
they have learned to keep things close to their vest for good reason.


One other note, a subsequent post states that they have 14 products before the fda - but the conference call
said 12 - the 14 is consistent with prior announcements - I am curious on this issue.


But I do think they will have a decent quarter. $2.50 a share on an annual basis is not too shabby. It certainly
supports the present level. I have always said that they need more products; and I think we will see them in
the next 24 months.


And one last thing - you say that you didn't say 60% short term - but the title of your article says "set to drop
by 60% . . . " Change the title if you don't mean it.

The stock continues up. To date you are wrong by about 20% vs the drop of 60%. Not an ideal situation fora short but
maybe time will play out in your favor. 
Meanwhile, the company continues to bring product to market and the longer it holds here the worse off your short bet
will become. 
Perhaps its time to consider covering the short and stemming your losses.

Perhaps he should do another article taking hitk to task??? It might go up another 20%.


And it might be up more than 20%, based upon the price you use (the 33 when he came out with the article, or the 31
close the day before the earnings announcement, or the 29 low after the article came out). And do you add back the
$1.50 dividend?


We should not consider hitk out of the woods yet. Flonase must still make a real contribution. They MUST get some
new approvals - they really haven't had any for several months. Even the "mystery" product due in April is only
targeting a $30 market (maybe this might add $15 million within a year??).


I think Mr. Pearson was plainly wrong. He raised issues that have been disclosed and are almost part of business in
the drug industry (although "fraud" can not be condoned, it should not be alleged lightly). But hitk is in a little lull, in
that it has no immediate new products, although it seems to be expanding others nicely. A good base, yes, but
nothing to be too excited about.
