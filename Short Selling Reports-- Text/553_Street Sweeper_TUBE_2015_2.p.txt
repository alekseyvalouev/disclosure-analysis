TubeMogul: It's All About The Numbers
Mar. 24, 2015 12:33 PM ET30 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


TubeMogul’s ad view traffic dropped over 16% in February, even as industry
numbers rose 18% . This follows a 20% drop in January, as the industry rose 5.4%,
data shows.


In ad videos viewed, TubeMogul has tumbled from being 79% as large as BrightRoll
in January 2014 to about 55% in February 2015.


TubeMogul’s unique video viewers, another critical metric, declined by 10.8% in
February compared with the previous February, data shows.


Overall, TubeMogul’s video metrics are declining as the industry grows slightly.


With TubeMogul video traffic about 55% behind BrightRoll, a fair valuation of
TubeMogul stock would be about $220 million - $252 million versus current valuation
of about $400 million.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


New industry data on TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE) provides a brutal reality check for the
digital video advertising company that has recently become a Wall Street darling.


This infatuation has given TubeMogul a $400 million market valuation. But that valuation is
not supported by key industry factors defined by big-data analysis firm comScore.


The data on unique video views and ad videos viewed show that TubeMogul's
performance is falling behind the rest of the industry.


TubeMogul's ad view traffic began its downhill slide in December, falling 9%. January ad
views year-over-year dropped almost 21% and more than 16% in February.


In contrast, BrightRoll, a Yahoo (YHOO) division, enjoyed 116% growth YOY in December,
44% in January and 39 percent in February.


The trend for TubeMogul, then, has clearly been just the opposite of the industry in
December, January and February.

See various viewpoints here, and the chart below. Our chart shows key comScore data.
The data mashes month-by-month figures for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)
(NASDAQ:GOOGL), BrightRoll, AOL (NYSE:AOL), LiveRail (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)
acquisition), SpotXchange, Specific Media, Hulu, Tremor Video, Videology Inc. and
TubeMogul going back as far as June 2009.


It's also clear that, considering ad videos viewed, TubeMogul has tumbled from being 79%
as large as BrightRoll to about 55%.


BrightRoll is growing admirably. But TubeMogul is shrinking.


The following chart shows that another important indicator - ability to attract new eyeballs -
unique video viewers - has fallen significantly for TubeMogul:

Investors can see that not only have actual numbers dropped each month from December
through February, but unique video viewers declined by 10.8% in February compared with
the previous February.


Though conventional wisdom suggests TubeMogul stock can't really be valuated, the
charts suggest a reasonable means of getting to a fair valuation. Considering that
TubeMogul comes in at about 55 to 63% of BrightRoll's size, rather than a $400 million
valuation, a reasonable valuation would be about $220 million to $252 million.


Wall Street may be raising an admiring eyebrow at TubeMogul, but the numbers reveal the
company's ugly little secrets: The industry is somewhat growing while TubeMogul appears
to be shrinking.

OK Streetcleaner you are Short TUBE, you should mention that in your first paragraph. I am long TUBE. 
You fail to talk about revenue which was up from $22MM Q4/03 to $36MM Q4/04 
TUBE is an unfolding story, 
CEO Brett Wilson said, "We continued to see strong adoption of our software in the fourth quarter by both brands and
agencies. Brands and agencies increasingly recognize the advantages of a centralized buying platform and the
opportunity to gain more control over their media spend. We are well positioned to partner with them as they make
this transition to a software-driven advertising platform. Our outlook for 2015 is exciting as we begin to make inroads
to accessing television ad budgets and add display and social advertising formats to our software."

What does this sentence mean," Conventional wisdom says TUBE cannot be valuated (sic.)..." You did. The market
values it. What drivel.


I think this is a home run and now a good entry point.

I am noticing a trend... every time Street Sweeper writes a negative piece on TUBE, the stock sees a move
up. They seem to be good at calling the short-term lows, they just don't realize it.

love it when longs start calling for short squeezes instead of refuting any of the points


24 Mar 2015, 08:26 PM

Really, is this even worthy of refuting? Apparently the data she uses has an opposite correlation to revenues.
Not concerned, and yes very long as you should be if you understood the story.

Is that why the stock's down 40% YTD?


25 Mar 2015, 12:39 AM


347242
I don't know, maybe because it was up 200% since the July IPO. Maybe the market over-reacted based upon
conservative guidance. Clearly 2015 forecast was top down vs. bottom up on all the contracts they now have.
Not a believer of Heineken, Quiznos, Foxtel in just the last four months? Did you listen to the earnings call?
CEO is very impressive and nailed it. No doubt this is volatile but if you don't understand where the company
is going you're not researching well enough.

"I'll see you next month at $20, after Q4 is announced and they blow the doors off."


Clearly you don't have a firm grasp of where the stock is headed. This is another one of these "disruptive"
companies in a highly competitive market and has to plow all that it can into SG&A to keep growing revenue.
This is sort of like the bus from Speed that will blow up as soon as mgmt lets off the gas. Meanwhile stock
can't catch a bid after that "blowout" Q4 report.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3024606-tubemogul-its-all-about-the-numbers 6/10


I wondered if you'd waste your time reading comments vs. doing research. They did blow the doors off in Q4
and the stock was up after hours until the conservative guidance sank in. What if they guided toward analyst
expectations for 2015, would it have passed the $21 average estimates like it has done in the prior quarters
(beating the prior raises)? My assumption was yes. However, in the near term we took a bath due to a very
conservative outlook. Does the recent 15%+ surge in the last 7 trading days mean anything as well, since
you're clearly only analyzing stock price?


Agreed there will be a hefty spend on SG&A in FY15. But TUBE is valued on revenue multiples until profits
bear fruit. My bet is 2H2016 starts to see profitability due to the rapid revenue growth and increasing gross
margins as they shift more and more to programmatic direct spending. You can't ignore TUBE's customers
are not only growing but are spending more YOY (retention rate of 80% the last three years). That is a clear
picture in the filings.


MarTech is "the" next industry to invest in the future. Only issue is who will be the leader in the space. As far
as an independent platform provider (vs. a GOOG which is trying to sell its platform to buy it's own Real
Estate digital space-viewed as a real conflict of interests to Brand advertisers), TUBE is clearly a pioneer and
first mover in the space.


And what happens at $300M revenue by 2018? At 75%+ (more likely to be 80% at those levels by then) gross
margins is this a $25M profit company? What about $500M revenues; does that mean $50-100M profits?
Think of those P/E multiples from today's valuations.

UP, I don't think he will understand what you said. For some investors, they used numbers before they
understand the business. They feel a company that grew 100% a year will at lest grow 50% next year, and
35% the year after. The truth is once a company hit ceiling in its market potential, it will either grow much
slowly or even decline.


FUEL is a good example for these investors to learn.

Nobody says the stock is not volatile but this is a great entry point and I wouldn't be a short seller at the $13
range. and You do have an idea of where this stock is headed? Lol. This was not your article- so what are
your reasons and what is the value?


I am very happy with my long position so I have put my money where my mouth is.


25 Mar 2015, 05:23 PM


Uncommon Profits
Right on Stan, agreed. I'm really, really looking forward to the day where investors aren't forecasting 4+ years
of flawless execution in order to try and justify present value.

Uncommon Profits
What are my reasons? The firs three risk factors in the S-1 summarize my issues perfectly:


1. "We have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future." 
2. "Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects." 
3. "We may not maintain our recent revenue growth."


There are all sorts of gems in there, you guys should probably dust it off and give it a glance. Bottom line is
many of these recent tech IPOs are unproven business models. People value these companies off of revenue
and projected revenue growth on the basis that one day in the distant future they can magically cut SG&A
and suddenly become profitable/cash flow positive. Whether it's flash storage, AdTech, HR, coupons, or
whatever else is "THE" next industry...bottom line is many of these business models are unproven and people
don't take the time to actually think about the economics of the underlying business. Instead they console
themselves with, "yes, gross margins will expand forever, revenue will grow indefinitely, and one day, they will
be profitable"


25 Mar 2015, 06:33 PM


347242
But aren't we trying to seek the "Alpha"? By the way the 3 points above are general key risks, blanketed by
most start ups. What substantive reasons do you have for TUBE reaching a revenue ceiling?


Agreed there will be an investor shift that moves from the revenue multiple high flier to the P/E investor. I don't
doubt that the stock will continue to see ups and downs (perhaps even below the 13 level today). But there is
legs to run in the interim. I will watch for a sell and further revaluation down the road.


But the business my friend! What say ye, that it is done for? That's the real test and in the long term my
money is on TUBE. But please, this article is fluff as is your 3 points of generic that can be found in many of
high growth companies.


If you want real education on TUBE, follow it's board member and investor, Ashu Garg that runs a $2.5Bn
fund and has a white paper on the industry and opportunity. TUBE is clearly in a sweet spot.


25 Mar 2015, 08:40 PM


Uncommon Profits
Yes, my three points are complete fluff. A company that's giving weak guidance (upon which present value is
predicated), that is unprofitable with no real prospects of becoming profitable (not even forecasting positive
"adjusted" EBITDA), and has an unproven business model...yeah, those aren't real concerns.


I don't care which VCs have invested. Box had a much more impressive investor syndicate and how's that
working out for them? About 2/3 of VC backed companies either fail outright or are sold at or below invested
capital, which is the reason why VC's are eternally optimistic. You don't need to suggest anything to me.

The Company admits in the prospectus that competitors have far more resources to throw at SG&A. Once the
indefinite stream of growth capital shuts off, TUBE will be hurting. When we reach that point is unknown.
Classic return of capital vs. return on capital debate.


Best of luck.

I often found some investors put huge confidence on a stock by talking everything but business. They use
P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, or hedge fund ownership for their main points. At the end, they basically blindly
assume the business dynamics will not deteriorate. Sometimes, they get lucky. The business is unchanged.
They make good money. However, often the business deteriorates beyond their imagination, and they scratch
their heads to figure out why. At the end, they blame either management or the market.


Many years ago, I was one of these investors.

Not sure if you saw, but Jeff is looking for your response below. As a follow up to Jeff, what in your mind is a
deterioration to the operating performance in TUBE? In the meantime I'm up nicely since $12.50 as investor
sentiment seems to be on my side as to the true growth potential.

I'm confused as to why you'd be on a board like TUBE. I understand value investing (at least the broad concepts).
You are correct a tech stock will rarely if ever make a graham screen - I think we all understand that. I just don't get
your point vis a vis TUBE. you might as well post your same message to every start up, not profitable co. Do you?
How did you pick TUBE?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3024606-tubemogul-its-all-about-the-numbers 9/10


Jeff, I am not a Ben Graham investor. I actually have more growth stocks in my portfolio than value plays. The
reason why you are confused is due to your lack of understanding of the difference among different growth
stocks.


You may see two growth stocks. Both enjoy P/E of 100, but one grows 30% a year while the other grows
100% a year. Naturally, many investors prefer the latter due to the higher growth. However, they don't know
that the former actually has high visibility to continue grow at 30% for 10 years while the latter will see its
growth declines to 10% in 3 years. At the end, it is the former company that should enjoy a higher valuation.


If you could not differentiate growth companies, your success of growth stock investing will solely depend on
your luck.


09 Apr 2015, 02:32 PM


347242
Stan, that was actually a great answer. Thank you.


I believe that TUBE's revenue growth is sustainable at 30%+ in the near term (2-3 years) but obviously the
street wanted the same 100%. All in all, I suspect TUBE will revalue multiple times throughout the next 24-
months even if that assumption (30%) is true.


I'm as enamored today with its business as I was 6 months ago, just not stock price. Although as I predicted
(with some luck admittedly), there was legs to run since the $12 bottom however I know they will need to beat
estimates to move materially higher (that remains unclear to me).


Good luck.


09 Apr 2015, 04:19 PM


Stan Ackman, Contributor
347242, thanks for your kind words.


I personally believe the market is not expecting growth rate near as high as 60%. Rather, it has some doubt
about TUBE's the ability to sustain 30% for many years. So, the key is whether TUBE is able to beat and
raise. If TUBE is able to raise, the market will have more confidence the growth's sustainability.


Again, the doubt is really due to the unpredictable nature of the business. The adtech business is not a moat
adding business given the current competition landscape. TUBE has the chance to become the biggest
adtech company in the world, but the probability is just very small.


If I were you, I will take a quick 30% return now. The chance for it to go up to $17 or drop to $10 is 50/50.
Also, most high beta stocks like TUBE could easily enjoy 30% rebound during the down turns. However, they
seldom get more than 40% rebounds.

Bottom line--assuming walled gardens don't emerge TUBE is well positioned to grow gross profit 40-50% CAGR for
the next few years. Does the business score particularly well on a porters five forces analysis? No but as they build
their customer base and continue to stay at the forefront of the industry in terms of R&D, the moat improves
