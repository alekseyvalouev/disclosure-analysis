Summary


Dividend Strategy


BPT's own annual report shows that shares are overvalued.


BPT's annual report shows that BPT will terminate.


BPT's yield will go away; yield investors should sell.


Last week, we published an article explaining why investors should sell their shares of
NYSE:BPT today, even if they believe that oil prices are going to go up.


We showed why BPT's dividend will go down and eventually go to zero in a handful of
years.


Annual Report discloses BPT valuation


On Wednesday, BPT filed its Annual Report with the SEC. Everyone can read the
Annual Report at this link.


Page 47 of the Annual Report contains a valuation of BPT's cash flows discounted at
10%:

According to BPT's reserve auditors, at December 31, 2014, the present value of BPT's
cash flows was $1.4 billion, or $65.54 per BPT share.


$65.54 is very close to today's current stock price.


However, the $65.54 price implied by the company's internal valuation assumes an oil
price of $94.99, even though the price of oil today is close to $50.


From pages 46 and 47 of the BPT annual report:


"At December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flow relating to proved reserves attributable to the Trust [was] based on the 12-
month average WTI Prices for 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $94.99, $96.78 and $94.71 per
barrel, respectively…"


Using today's lower oil prices, BPT's cash flows will be much lower than $1.4 billion, and
the appropriate target stock price will be much lower than $65.54.


JP Morgan has modeled BPT's cash flows carefully. JP Morgan assigned BPT a SELL
rating a target price of $40.


As explained in our prior article, we have also modeled BPT's cash flows carefully, and
we believe the stock is worth less than $40 using today's oil prices. We also believe that
the stock is overvalued even if oil goes back to $80 per barrel.


Annual Report discloses BPT will terminate and shareholders will stop receiving
cash


In our prior article, we explain that BPT is likely to terminate in a handful of years.


When BPT terminates, shareholders will be left with nothing other than the dividends
that they have collected until then.

This means that BPT's current yield is unsustainable.


In page 4 of Exhibit 99 of the Annual Report filed Wednesday, BPT reveals that their
own reserve auditors estimate BPT will terminate in 2028, assuming an oil price of
$94.99 per barrel:


"Based on the SEC-defined 12-month average West Texas Intermediate Price of $94.99
per barrel… the projection that royalty payments will continue through the year 2028 is
reasonable. For the economic conditions and production forecast as of December 31,
2014 per barrel Royalty will be zero following the year 2028."


But if we use today's lower oil prices, BPT will terminate much sooner than 2028.


BPT terminates once cash distributions from British Petroleum to BPT fall below
$1,000,000 for two years. Cash distributions will fall very quickly in today's oil
environment - much more quickly than in the $94.99/barrel environment assumed by
BPT's auditors.


At $55 per barrel of WTI oil, which is higher than today's prices, we expect BPT to stop
paying cash in 2021 and to terminate in 2023.


BPT's yield is going away


We believe many investors may hold BPT for its yield. We do not believe yield is an
appropriate metric for a trust whose dividend is unsustainable.


However, even if you trade BPT on its yield, our analysis shows that you should sell
BPT shares.


As shown in our last note, BPT's cash flows are very easy to predict if you build an excel
model and make a few simple assumptions.


We have created a model that shows that BPT's will pay an April distribution close to
$1.05 (this figure may change slightly depending on changes in the oil price between
today and the end of March).


At an 8% annual yield, BPT's April distribution implies a share price of $50, well below
the current stock price.
