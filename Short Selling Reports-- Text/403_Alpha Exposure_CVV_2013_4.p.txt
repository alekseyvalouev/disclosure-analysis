CVD Equipment - Northland Initiation Basically Cut And Paste From
ThinkEquity
Sep. 11, 2013 1:30 PM ET48 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


It's always great to see the analysis behind the other side of one of our investments. We
got to see just that today when Northland Capital Markets initiated on CVD Equipment
(NASDAQ:CVV) with a $16 price target and an Outperform rating. A copy of their report
from their website is here. Once we read today's initiation report, we were easily able to
conclude that it actually corroborates our views on CVD and our price target of $5.


Copied And Pasted From His Report Two Years Ago At Now Defunct Broker
ThinkEquity


First, today's report is nearly a cut and paste from the analyst's initiation piece on CVD
Equipment back from 2011 when he was an analyst at ThinkEquity. It appears that much
of the material was copied verbatim from the 2011 report, meaning little has changed with
CVD over the past 2 years.

Prior Estimates Were Much Too High


Moreover, it appears that the new initiation report uses the same exact model as was used
at ThinkEquity, which was far too optimistic. Look below to see how similar the models
look. It appears that the only change was the name of the broker at the top ... and of
course the numbers were drastically reduced to better reflect CVV's poor operating
performance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687802-cvd-equipment-northland-initiation-basically-cut-and-paste-from-thinkequity 3/20


When comparing the models, it's striking just how overestimated revenues and profits
were. The 2011 initiation report forecasted revenues of $41.6 million in 2012 and earnings
of $0.48 per share. CVD earned just $22.2 million and earned $0.07 in EPS. This means
that revenue was overestimated by 87% and EPS was overestimated by 580%!


(Click to enlarge)


Another way show the poor performance of the company is to look at today's initiation
report which forecasts CVD will have $31.8 million in revenues in 2015, which is nearly
25% below the 2012 revenue estimate from the original initiation report. Bullish investors
claim that the poor results were caused by the disruption from moving into a new plant;
however, a miss of this magnitude suggests far deeper issues. We explained these issues
in our Seeking Alpha articles (here and here) where we exposed the truth behind the
graphene hype, highlighted the extremely competitive nature of CVD's business, and
showed that CVD has no meaningful intellectual property.


Where's the Graphene?


Another thing that struck us was the lack of emphasis on graphene in both the past and
new initiation reports. Graphene is hardly mentioned in either of the reports. While the
bulls on CVD focus on graphene, the exclusion of graphene from these reports makes it
appear that graphene is irrelevant in the near-term. For what it's worth, this corroborates
our view that graphene is irrelevant.


Using the Valuation Metrics from the First Initiation Shows CVD Has A Lot Of
Downside


What's most curious to us is that the valuation metrics for CVD have completely changed
since the first initiation reports from two years ago. In the original initiation piece from
2011, CVD was valued at 2x 1-year forward revenues (meaning his 2012 estimate). In the
Northland initiation piece today, CVD is valued at 3x 2-year forward revenues (meaning
his 2015 estimate). Boosting the multiple by 50% on even more distant revenues provides
instant upside, but we don't believe the increase is justified given CVD's declining backlog,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687802-cvd-equipment-northland-initiation-basically-cut-and-paste-from-thinkequity 4/20


orders, and revenues. If the same 2x revenue metric was used today, then CVD would be
worth just $7.86 per share, which equals 36% downside from yesterday's close of $12.24.
Even if we the new 2015 revenue estimate of $31.8 million, we still get 16% downside.


(Click to enlarge)


Furthermore, in the original ThinkEquity report on August 15, 2012, CVD's price target
was set by valuing the company at 18x forward EPS. If we use that same valuation metric
today, then CVD would be worth just $1.98 per share on his $0.11 EPS estimate for 2014!


If we take the current 2015 estimate of $0.35 in EPS, then CVD would still only be worth
$6.30 per share!


(Click to enlarge)


Conclusion


We don't believe today's initiation report by Northland Capital Markets adds anything new.
If anything, it serves to shed light on the ridiculous valuation of CVD today given its
declining backlog and order book, and shows that the estimates are most likely overly
optimistic and cannot be relied upon.


We believe CVD is a compelling short, and have set a price target of $5 based on its
historic earnings, which is a generous valuation for a company that has since turned
unprofitable and is now shrinking.


Disclosure: I am short CVV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company

Technology moves very rapidly. The primary seller of graphene (when are they going to update spellcheck to
include graphene!) is http://bit.ly/15IuZVp owned 100% by Graphene Laboratories in New York. CVD sells
equipment. I wouldn't advise anyone on how to deal with the stock, but going long at $ 10? Going short at $
10? The chart is flat-lined indicating a defense line has been drawn after the initial plunge to $ 7. I wouldn't do
either. there are better trades.

Agreed. Your short position must be making you terribly desperate. Funny how so many folks disagree with you, but

There is no trend in the charts. Going short or long involves a trend if you are a trader otherwise you are
simply trying to manipulate stock for a takeover or buyout. So, which one is it? What is their patent chest look
like, that might determine a greater off-book value.

Hah. Great article. I love calling analysts out on BS like this.


One thing that's important to mention is ThinkEquity was the sole underwriter for the firm's May 27, 2011 deal, raising
$9.6 million:

ThinkEquity earned a $609,809 fee for this.


The deal closed on May 27, 2011 and less than a month later ThinkEquity comes out with it's "strong buy".


Given nobody else covers CVD, and trading revenue would be miniscule given it's a microcap, think really really hard
about why they would dust this off.


Why not dust off the old report and spend a few hours tweaking it if it means you get a shot at earning a huge fee the
next time CVV taps the market.


If indeed the business is falling off a cliff, they would be wise to raise equity now before the stock tubes.


I put zero stock in the analyst's arguably conflicted "recommendation" and see it as a flag that dilution may be coming.


InvestorWisdom - feel free to comment but don't expect any replies from me.

InvestorWisdom
"and see it as a flag that dilution may be coming."


They have issued less than 1,500,000 shares since 2007 (6 years) and are well financed for their needs and you
somehow see dilution coming? lol


If they were going to dilute they probably would have done it to fund the move, new equipment, clean rooms, etc but
they didn't need to, did they? They still have plenty of cash for their needs, after all the expensive stuff is complete
and they are ready for significant growth, beyond their previously maxed capacity.


Not many companies are as responsible/stingy with their shares as CVV. The proof is in their history

This is so funny, IBM will sink and CVV will rise no matter what you think or write about what should happen... You're
losing with CVV, forget about this graphene hype. It's just gonna go away a few decades from now after
revolutionizing the world we live in!


Did not comment before, but couldn't help myself this time... This is hilarious. Do you really think you can sink or

The CVD this company sells is CUSTOMIZED. This is not cookie cutter stuff and they sell a lot more than
CVD. You are harping on a single product line out of many. There are HUNDREDS of other systems,
equipment, raw materials, etc they offer. Dont confuse the name of the company with the broad range of stuff
they do through their multiple subsidiaries


Lets also not confuse people posting about the stock because they are bullish, with PAID stock promotion. No
pumpers have been paid by the company, everybody posts about hot stocks on twitter, this is no a big

"The predominant thing graphene really has to do with this company is the stock promotion that was going on

So, selling CUSTOMIZED "turnkey" systems, equipment and raw materials that are used for the production,
manipulation and application of Graphene somehow suggests that they dont work with Graphene? Its all
hype?


Quit twisting the facts please. From the 8/14 news release


“In addition we also received orders for two large Graphene systems – one for a square 300mm substrate
and the other for a round 200mm substrate. Our application laboratory is playing an important part in our
ability to deliver next generation equipment that meets the evolving needs of this growing material area. Our
expanded application laboratory now enables us to work with an increasing selected customer base in the
fields of Nanotubes, Nanowires, Graphene, TCO coatings and other deposition requirements. If you have not
looked recently at our Website where our conference presentations are published, I urge you to do so. You

materials into large volume, value added products.

@Alpha Exposure  
One more interesting fact about CVD Equipment Corp (Just in case you want to write one more article) 
By making and selling graphene by chemical vapor deposition, CVD Equipment Corp is infringing this patent:
"Graphene synthesis by chemical vapor deposition",  
PUBLISHED July 25, 2013


United States Patent 8470400. 
Link http://bit.ly/162iOyc 
Processes for synthesizing graphene films. Graphene films may be synthesized by heating a metal or a dielectric on a
substrate to a temperature between 400.degree. C. and 1,400.degree. C. The metal or dielectric is exposed to an
organic compound thereby growing graphene from the organic compound on the metal or dielectric. The metal or
dielectric is later cooled to room temperature. As a result of the above process, standalone graphene films may be
synthesized with properties equivalent to exfoliated graphene from natural graphite that is scalable to size far greater
than that available on silicon carbide, single crystal silicon substrates or from natural graphite.

Prove that they are "infringing" that patent? That is a serious claim without having ANY proof.


I already provided proof that most of their IP is licensed through their customers, Universities, etc. It states
this on their site.


Infringe: Actively break the terms of (a law, agreement, etc.).


How do you know CVV did not build the system for them and got the IP through a joint agreement? Or, they
could simple be licensing it?


CVV is not a new company, they have been around a long time (pioneers). They are not naive when it comes
to this sector and the patents that are out there.


I bet you they built the system for them. That is about the exact same time CVV got involved with Graphene
and started marketing these systems, along with the raw materials (CVD Graphene)

dimensional graphene products that will be marketed under the trade name 
CVD3DGraphene™ and is expected to enable new high performance products.


Karlheinz Strobl, V.P. of Business Development, states, “The CVD3DGraphene™ cellular material platform is
based on a three dimensional graphene-foam like material having several two dimensional (a few atomic
layers thick) graphene sheets that are mechanically and electrically fully interconnected in three dimensions.
This novel, highly customizable material platform enables the preservation of many of the high performance
material properties of the traditional one atom thick two dimensional graphene sheets. Such three
dimensional graphene materials can be further functionalized by chemical vapor deposition, electro
deposition and/or chemical grafting to develop even more advanced materials for high performance product
developments. This new nano-material platform interconnects the two dimensional nano world with the three
dimensional macroscopic world of products in a more manufacturable manner. The novel material platform is
already being explored by innovators for a growing range of product applications. It is anticipated that as
additional variations of the material are developed, more growth market opportunities will become available.”


"CVD Materials Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of CVD Equipment Corporation 
that focuses on providing a range of nano-enabled materials and products,” said Leonard Rosenbaum,
President. “By leveraging our custom equipment design and manufacturing capabilities with the process
development and manufacturing capabilities of our Application Laboratory, CVD Materials Corporation can
optimally focus on shortening the time to 
market for novel “nano-enhanced” material products. With the commercialization of 
CVD3DGraphene™ cellular materials using a range of Nickel foam templates and by 
tuning the thickness of the carbon film layers we can provide an expanded range of 
CVDGraphene™ research materials that enables our customers to develop new products, including: higher

tallest carbon nanotube arrays yet developed.


In 2012 we expanded our laboratory staff and began conducting cutting-edge research and development
independently with promising preliminary results. In 2012, we incurred approximately $1,330,000 of research
and development expenses of which $389,000 were independent of external customer orders compared to
2011, when we incurred $955,000 of research and development expenses, all of which were incurred on
customer orders.

I found no record of a licensing deal between CVD Equipment Corp. and The University of Texas at
Austin/Texas Instruments, Inc.

If you sell a product that is protected by a patent without IP rights, you are infringing the patent. It is exactly
the case for graphene on copper foil sold by CVD Materials Corporation.

The dont release any info on their MANY licensing agreements, do they? Read the 10K


They list dozens of Universities and companies (a partial list) that they are partners with, but no details on
each individual agreement.


Again, you are making serious claims you cant back up.


13 Sep 2013, 01:40 PM


InvestorWisdom
But companies do license patents right? And CVV clearly states that they co develop and/or licensing Nano
related IP is a big part of their strategy.


CVVs "custom" equipment is known for growing the longest Nanotubes. They might be relatively small, but
they are a long standing NAME in this young Nano industry.


Their whole business strategy is accelerating OTHER companies Nano patents, into products. They are not
trying to compete. You apparently dont even understand their business.

CVD Equipment forms CVD Materials subsidiary


CVD Equipment Corp of Ronkonkoma, NY, USA (a designer and manufacturer of equipment for developing
and manufacturing electronic components, materials and coatings) has announced the expansion of the
materials part of its business. The materials will be marketed through the subsidiary CVD Materials Corp.


“We believe that now is the right time to build on the processing capability, material manufacturing, marketing
and business growth success of our Application Laboratory, which continues to open new business
opportunities in both traditional and non-traditional chemical vapor deposition related markets,” says president
Leonard Rosenbaum. “We will further develop our in-house next-generation material manufacturing
capabilities and capacities and expand our marketing and sales efforts directly to researchers and innovators
at universities, government and Industrial R&D facilities that are working on application development for
tomorrow’s next generation products in semiconductors, solar, batteries, capacitors, water filtration, catalysts
composites, and other traditional and non-traditional chemical vapor deposition applications through CVD
Materials,” he adds.


“These applications will primarily utilize graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNT), nanowires (NW), and other 1D,
2D and 3D surface and surface-area-enhanced materials,” Rosenbaum continues. CVD Materials Corp will
primarily focus on (1) contract CVD-related process development, (2) research material manufacturing, (3)
CVD and other nano-enabled material manufacturing licensed from third parties, and (4) on CVD Equipment
Corp’s proprietary materials and material processing platforms.


“We expect that this business model extension will help to accelerate the commercialization of tomorrow’s
technologies and will bring future equipment, material manufacturing and joint venture business opportunities
to CVD Equipment Corp,” says Karlheinz Strobl, VP of business development. “This expansion of the
Application Laboratory will further accelerate the commercialization of tomorrow's technology and our
‘Sustainable Growth with Low Risk” business strategy.’

CVV licenses Nano related patents from anybody that has them and creates the "turnkey" custom system
which allows OTHER manufactures (whom order custom equipment from CVV) to implement these
material/process patents into their products.


These types of patent will be used by 100's of companies one day. This is not the type of patent that
companies hoard and use for themselves. There is too much potential in letting everyone license and use it.
Its like plastic, everybody uses it, but the various processes to construct and manipulate it were obviously
patented, right? You could never make enough money using a process patent like that yourself (a single
company), the money is in licensing it


The link you provided states this right on top:


***This Patent May Be For Sale or Lease. Contact Us***


Since CVV clearly states that they license "CVD and other nano-enabled material manufacturing licensed
from third parties". Isn't it logical to assume that they licensed this years ago? Its not hard to find that patent,
just type in "CVD graphene". No doubt they know about it, along with all of the other related patents. They are
always hunting for this stuff, its a big part of their business plan, as i have provided proof for, unlike you.


13 Sep 2013, 02:10 PM

The patent I mentioned is so called "roadblock" in graphene industry. May be you should call them and ask if they
have rights to use this patent.


13 Sep 2013, 01:47 PM


InvestorWisdom
Even if i have already called and have the facts, you would still not believe me. Why dont you call and find out
for yourself.


Researching and licensing this stuff is a major part of their business plan, as i provided proof for. They know
about all these Nano related patents and license, especially the ones that they can make money with.


It takes less than 5 minutes to find that info, its a simple " CVD graphene" search. Do you really doubt that
their scientists and engineers haven't figured it out after this many years of digging for Nano patents? lol


Its an extremely basic/obvious patent search, which is why you found it so fast.


13 Sep 2013, 02:28 PM


XXXXnhgXXX
There are NO public records that CVD Equipment Corp. got any graphene-related IP either in form of a patent or a
licence. It would be nice if CEO comments on this issue.

Again, read the 10K. They do not comment on ***ANY*** of their IP licenses.


There are not required to release strategic/competitive info in regard to IP. Its not uncommon for companies to hold
their cards close to their chest, for various reasons.

First computer has been build based on Carbon Nanotubes: 
MEMS) and industrial coatings as well as equipment for surface mounting of components onto printed circuit boards.'


Within the next decade a carbon nanotube structure that will lift rockets into space before they start up will be
possible.


Long term investment... Backlog will NOT be full within 1 or 2 quarters. Improvement however should be visible by the
end of Q2-2014...


Just wait and see what the CEO's comments and guidance will be on the next publication. Transparency from them is
warranted however.


Looking at the balance sheet from Aixtron (Germany) for example, I think CVD is the best choice. Although investing
in this segment is risky, because of the very early stages of development and future uncertainties regarding the use of
these technologies. No guts, No glory...


I'm long CVD.

Nice prediction lol. They've inked $21+ million in orders over the past 4 months, which is the most they have
ever done over a 4 month period. This puts them on pace to double+ their best year. Still short?

This from business wire pr on results: "However, orders levels have begun to rise as evidenced by the $4,219,000 of
orders that the Company has already received during the period from October 1 through November 13, 2013" 
Also " I am at this time announcing our forecast that order levels for the 4th quarter 2013 are expected to exceed
