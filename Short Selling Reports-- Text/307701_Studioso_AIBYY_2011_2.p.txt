Absurd:	Allied	Irish	Banks	Valued	More	Than	10	Times	Higher	Than
Bank	of	Ireland
Jul.	19,	2011	1:53	PM	ET19	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


In	our	last	article	analyzing	Allied	Irish	Banks	(AIB)	we	reviewed	the	capital	raising
initiatives	announced	by	AIB.	We	concluded	that	the	bank	had	significant	downside
potential,	due	to	a	capital	raising	of	500	billion	shares	at	a	price	of	0.01	EUR	per	share,	a
discount	of	more	than	90%	from	its	current	price.


Although	the	AIB	share	price	has	declined	since	the	publication	of	that	article,	
we	maintain	that	AIB	remains	incredibly	overvalued,	and	reiterate	our	price	target	of	0.033
EUR	(Ireland	shares).	For	the	NEW	YORK	ADRS,	we	have	a	slightly	lower	price	target	of
0.033	*	10	*	1.4500	=	0.4785	USD,	reflecting	the	decline	in	the	EUR/USD	exchange	rate.


In	this	article	we	will	analyze	AIB’s	balance	sheet,	and	compare	it	with	that	of	its	closest
rival,	Bank	of	Ireland	(NYSE:IRE),	(BKIR).	Our	analysis	shows	that	AIB	is	trading	at	a
price-to-book	valuation	of	3.08,	compared	with	a	price-to-book	valuation	of	0.26	for	IRE.


1.	Analysis	of	AIB


As	announced	July	1,	AIB	has	completed	its	acquisition	of	EBS.	Therefore	we	will	analyze
the	combined	financial	position	of	the	two	entities	as	of	December	31,	2010,	the	date	of
the	two	companies’	last	reports.	Although	these	figures	are	more	than	6	months	old,	it	is
likely	that	AIB’s	financial	position	has	deteriorated	since	that	date.	This	is	a	reasonable
assumption	given	the	company’s	10	billion	loss	in	2010,	and	the	Central	Bank	of	Ireland’s
requirement	for	the	bank	to	raise	11.9	billion	EUR	in	new	capital.

Price	to	book	value	=	3,042.0	/	11,757.0	=	0.26	times	book	value.


3a.	Comparison	of	AIB	versus	BKIR


We	believe	that	BKIR	is	a	stronger	bank	than	AIB.	This	is	confirmed	by	2010	financial
performance	of	the	two	banks,	as	well	as	recent	actions	by	the	Irish	government.


For	the	12	months	ending	December	31,	2010,	BKIR’s	loss	(pdf)	was	“only”	609	million
EUR,	compared	with	a	massive	loss	of	over	10	billion	EUR	for	AIB	(pdf).


After	completion	of	500	billion	share	issue,	the	Irish	government	will	hold	a	99.8%	stake	in
AIB	-	effective	nationalisation.	Even	if	the	Irish	government	is	required	to	buy	all	of	the
shares	issued	in	BKIR’s	rights	issue,	it	will	only	hold	a	69.7%	stake	in	that	company.

7/18/2019 Absurd: Allied Irish Banks Valued More Than 10 Times Higher Than Bank of Ireland - Allied Irish Banks, P.L.C. ADR (OTCMKTS:AIBYY) | Seeking…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/280225-absurd-allied-irish-banks-valued-more-than-10-times-higher-than-bank-of-ireland 4/6


The	share	price	for	AIB’s	capital	raising	is	0.01	EUR,	whereas	BKIR’s	rights	issue	is	0.10
EUR.	The	higher	share	price	for	BKIR’s	capital	raising,	and	the	resultant	lower
government	stake,	suggests	that	the	Irish	government	is	more	confident	about	the	future
performance	of	BKIR	when	compared	with	AIB.


3b.	Irish	economy	and	banking	system


In	2010,	Ireland	received	a	bailout	following	a	substantial	rise	in	government	bond	yields.
At	the	time	of	writing,	Ireland’s	2-year	note	fetches	a	yield	of	23.22%,	indicating	the
market’s	concern	over	the	solvency	of	the	country,	and	potential	for	a	sovereign	default.


Furthermore,	AIB	(and	presumably	other	Irish	financial	institutions)	have	faced	a	gradual
decline	in	customer	deposits	–	a	slow-motion	bank	run.	As	announced	on	April	12,	2011,
customer	deposits	declined	by	22	billion	EUR	to	52	billion	EUR,	which	(at	best)	has	the
effect	of	raising	net	interest	margins,	and	at	worst	could	result	in	bank	insolvency.


In	stronger	economic	times,	banks	are	often	valued	at	a	price-to-book	valuation	greater
than	1.0,	reflecting	economic	growth,	profitability	and	low	provisions	for	non-performing
loans.	Given	the	headwinds	facing	the	Irish	economy	and	the	Irish	banking	system,	a
price-to-book	multiple	at	or	below	1.0	is	more	appropriate.


4.	Price	targets	for	AIB

Market	capitalisation 3,042.0 56,347.0


Price	to	book	ratio 0.26 3.08


The	above	amounts	in	million	EUR,	apart	from	share	prices	and	price	to	book	ratios.
Market	capitalization	and	price-to-book	ratios	are	calculated	based	on	the	shares
outstanding	after	capital	raisings.


As	calculated	above,	BKIR	will	have	a	price-to-book	of	about	0.26.	This	reflects	concerns
about	Irish	economic	growth,	non-performing	bank	loans	and	the	potential	negative	effects
from	a	sovereign	default.


At	a	valuation	of	3.08	times	book	value,	AIB	is	incredibly	overvalued.	When	compared	with
its	rival,	BKIR,	this	valuation	is	even	more	extreme,	the	later	being	valued	at	a	price	to
book	valuation	of	less	than	10%	of	AIB’s	valuation.


At	a	generous	price-to-book	multiple	of	0.92	(compared	with	0.26	for	its	stronger	rival),
AIB	would	fetch	a	valuation	of	16.782	billion	EUR,	equivalent	to	a	share	price	of	0.033
EUR,	matching	the	price	target	mentioned	in	our	previous	article.	Using	a	EUR/USD
exchange	rate	of	1.4500,	this	gives	a	target	of	0.4785	USD	per	ADR.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	AIB.
