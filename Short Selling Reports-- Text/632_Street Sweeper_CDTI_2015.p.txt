Clean Diesel Technologies: Burning Cash, Emitting Spotty History
And Financials
May 15, 2015 1:42 PM ET14 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


The big three - revenue, operating losses and gross margins - all worsened for CDTI
last quarter amid the auditor's substantial doubts about the company's ability to
continue as a going concern.


CDTI has survived primarily on debt, selling assets and stock offerings, including two
offerings in 2014. Burning cash, CDTI appears to be on the verge of a more potential
dilution.


The company's tax credit and loss issues arising out of a merger, emissions funding
challenges, executive turnover and history of troubles with federal regulators add to
the unfortunate mix.


If a company's business is so flimsy that optimistic analysts must resort to commenting on
the company's "body language" for good results, you know you're in for a ride.


But if you dare look past Clean Diesel Technologies' (NASDAQ:CDTI) body language into
the financials, rapidly dying legacy products, the emissions funding problems, lost tax
credits, fleeing CFO, historical allegations of behavior believed detrimental to
shareholders validated by federal regulators' orders - and SEC charges against a CDTI
promoter - you know it has all the markings of one short, unforgettable, miserable ride.


CDTI manufactures and distributes emission control systems and products for the light-
duty vehicle and heavy-duty diesel market. The bull thesis contends the company will
make progress in transforming its business and will make commercial strides with its
DuraFit offering. Roth Capital, which notes it expects to receive or intends to seek
business with CDTI in the next three months, reiterated its "buy" rating in a research
report sent to investors Wednesday morning. With the stock sitting at about $2.17, Roth
set a $2.50 price target.


Investors should check out other viewpoints here while we describe our concerns about
CDTI and why we think the stock price should collapse.


Terrible Financials

Investors may see in the table below that CDTI's financial picture worsened in all three
important areas:


Clean Diesel Tech. (CDTI) Q1 2015 Q1 2014


Revenue $10.3 million $11.6 million


Operating Loss -$2.7 million -$1.5 million


Gross Margin 27% 32%


(Source: SEC filings)


The company's total losses zoomed up to $194 million. Earnings per share for 2014
remained in the red at -$0.78. Indeed, CDTI's independent auditor has "expressed
substantial doubt about CDTI's ability to continue as a going concern."


Unfortunately, the company is expected to continue spilling red ink on investors. Check
out what normally optimistic analysts anticipate:

At the same time, CDTI is torching its cash even faster than this time last year:


Clean Diesel Tech. Q1 2015 Q1 2014


Cash $4.3 million $3.6 million


Cash Burn $3.0 million $ 1.5 million

Dilution Machine


So, at this rate, we imagine CDTI is gunning its dilution engine. We're watching for another
potentially dilutive stock offering right away. Filing footnotes show that's the way the
company has always done business.


Along with borrowing, credit facilities, and selling off its Nevada exhaust parts business,
CDTI says it is staying alive with stock offerings. It has offered millions of shares of stock
under a shelf registration - first in 2013. In 2014, it ripped out blocks totaling ~$11 million
worth of stock in April and November.


The shelf registration allows for $50 million in stock offerings. So, look out below! There's
plenty of room left for more potential dilution.


Like Other Big Diluters


Retail investors now are thanking TheStreetSweeper for warning them just Wednesday
about a similar stock - Gevo (NASDAQ:GEVO). Much like CDTI, bad financials pointed to
the inevitable. And about 2 1/2 hours after TheStreetSweeper's warning that a potentially
dilutive offering loomed - Wham! Gevo ripped out a stock offering and now the stock is
down over 20 percent in 48 hours.


That Gevo warning followed our tweet on Monday about Viggle (VGGL). We noted its
stock rally, but also massive debt, low cash and going concern issues, thinking Viggle
would issue stock soon. Sure enough, Viggle issued stock two days later, sending the $4
shares crashing to ~$3.


Legacy Technology Dying Faster Than Anticipated


CDTI is hoping its new DuraFit will help take up the slack for the declining diesel retrofit
business. But its own filings portray the increasing misery here:


"…we launched DuraFit™ to take advantage of the emerging market opportunity in
replacement diesel particulate filters and to drive near-term sales. Our legacy diesel-
retrofit business, however, declined much more than expected, negatively
impacting our financial results for the year. While we are disappointed with our
2014 financial performance, we are pleased with the progress we have made
advancing our technology initiatives."


Emissions Funding Gets Cut

CDTI has relied upon tighter emission standards and emissions control programs to help
generate money. But CDTI is losing access to those matters, as its SEC filing explains so
well. Please see the full notation on page 13:


"Future growth of our business depends in part on the general availability of funding
for emissions control programs, which can be affected for economic as well as
political reasons. For example, in light of the recent budget crisis in California,
funding was not available … its start date was pushed back. Additionally, funding for
the EPA's Diesel Emissions Reductions Act, or DERA, for 2014 has been
substantially reduced … future funding remains uncertain…"


Extreme Dependence on One Customer Backfires


Honda's (NYSE:HMC) motorcycle division reached an agreement in 2010 with CDTI for
developing ZPGM catalysts. Disappointingly, that was a purchase order arrangement.
Unfortunately, the deal expired in March 2014. Read the notation on page 14:


"Manufacturers typically seek to have two or more sources of critical components;
however, there can be no assurance that manufacturers for which we are a shared
supplier will not sole source the products we supply."


Merger Issues: Damages Loss Carryforwards, Tax Credits


These days, CDTI can't even seem to catch a break-even when it's losing millions and
grasping at tax loss straws:


"The Merger adversely affects our ability to take advantage of the significant
U.S. federal tax loss carryforwards and tax credits accumulated.


... our ability to use our net operating losses and credits in future tax years has been
significantly limited. In addition, due to the "ownership change," our federal
research and development credits have also been limited and, consequently, we do
not anticipate being able to use any of these credits that existed as of the date of the
Merger in future tax years."


And, this time, the stock offerings may hurt not just those poor souls holding the stock, but
the company itself:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3187786-clean-diesel-technologies-burning-cash-emitting-spotty-history-and-financials 5/10


"Our limited ability to use these net operating losses and tax credits as a result of the
Merger or otherwise, including as a result of equity offerings subsequent to the
Merger, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations."


Executives Suddenly Resign


Often, an early sign of big trouble is a sudden executive departure. And CDTI has had its
CEO resign to "pursue other opportunities" in December 2013, along with the Chairman
and the CFO in 2014.


Maybe CDTI had set itself up for problems with its creation of the "Office of the CEO"
which two people shared. After an apparent blowup, Nikhil Mehta suddenly resigned "for
good reason," six months after serving as part of the Office of the CEO. The board axed
the Office of the CEO and appointed Christopher J. Harris to serve as president and chief
executive on July 2, 2014. On July 31, 2014, Mr. Mehta resigned.


As it turns out, Mr. Mehta wasn't the first CFO who has butted heads with CDTI.


Fined: Fires CFO for Reporting Conduct Believed Detrimental to Shareholders


Financial and ethical concerns raised by a proposed merger got a former CFO fired when
he reported them to directors. The US Labor Department's OSHA investigated the
whistleblower's allegations in 2010 and ordered the company to fork out $1.9 million.


According to the Labor Department's September 2013 announcement:


"The former CFO believed that a proposed merger was: detrimental to the company,
critical financial information had been withheld from board members, and the conflict
of interest violated internal company controls mandated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as well as the company's own corporate code of ethics."


None less than the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr.
David Michaels sent a strong warning to CDTI.


"We protect those who are courageous enough to speak out, even internally, about
violations of securities rules and regulations."


Dr. Michaels added:

"This order should send a clear message to publicly traded companies that silencing
those who try to do the right thing is unacceptable."


SEC Charges: Investor Relations Firm Partner, CDTI Promoter


Thirteen times between June 20, 2013, and July 7, 2014, the name Kevin M. McGrath
appears as the contact person for more information on CDTI's financial information in SEC
filings. An example is here. About two weeks after the last filing bearing Mr. McGrath's
name, the SEC issued a press release headlined: "SEC Charges Investor Relations
Executive With Insider Trading While Preparing Clients' Press Releases."


The SEC charged Mr. McGrath with insider trading on confidential information he learned
about CDTI and another client, MISONIX, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSON) while he helped prepare
their press releases.


"McGrath used one hand to help clients draft their press releases while using the other to
trade illegally in their stock," said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC's
New York Regional Office.


The SEC alleged that Mr. McGrath worked on a press release announcing a big CDTI
order and minutes after finding out on May 24, 2011, that the press release would be
issued the next day, he bought 1,000 shares of stock. On the stock rise, he sold and
profited over $6,000, according to the release. Mr. McGrath agreed to pay $25,044 to
settle the charges. Such results are one more reason investors should be cautious
whenever they see hype coming from companies.


Conclusion


So, CDTI's stock has rallied lately as the market forgets or remains unknowledgeable
about the company's history, prospects, financials, going concern issues, cash burn and
dilution engine. We believe the weak bull thesis and all the "body language" in the world
will become quite unimportant amid the screams of investors who'll ultimately be left
holding the bag.


Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in CDTI
and stand to profit on any future declines in the stock price.

Wow! Great article! Thank you to Seeking Alpha for finally exposing this company. 
In addition, I would add the following to your short thesis: 
1)The amount of insider ownership is misleading. Mainly two wealthy individuals own the lions share of stock. A
director by the name of Bell bought shares on the open market a few years ago and Kanis who has been converting
most of the debt owed to him in form of stock. Fortunately for the company, Kanis has been more than kind as he
could of foreclosed on them many times. But how long can Kanis put up with the consistent losses? 
If you take the CEO, the CFO and the Founder they have a sum total of around 100K shares of stock. 100K shares of
sub $2 stock is a paltry sum for the main three executives that run the company. I don't believe any of it was ever
bought on the open market, so it was given to them. 
Why would they even be willing to sell the company when they own hardly any stock? They have no skin in the game
and it's embarrassing that even the founder owns such little stock. Maybe this why some of their secondaries are
placed well below the market prices? 
2)I don't believe that in the entire history of the company that they have ever had even one quarter of earnings that
were profitable. 
3)The company has a history of dealing secondaries through less than desirable methods. The last secondary was
done with a hedge fund who shorted the stock when it was run up on false hope press releases and then dumped
their shares. 
Also, there was another secondary done for around $1.30 where they gave away about 1/3 of the company for a
song.


There is one issue that you have me confused upon and that is about the Honda agreement that you say was
cancelled. I don't believe it was cancelled because they are still selling catalysts to Honda. Also, that agreement is
with the auto division not the motorcycle division. I have not looked up the agreement but all I know is that CDTI sells
their catalysts for many different automotive models that Honda produces. While this is a bright spot, I've always
wondered why no other OEM buys from CDTI


Also, you have to be careful about your short position because CDTI will soon be releasing (maybe June) their test
results for their new Spinel technology that they claim is close to ZPGM. This could temporarily spike the shares. Of
course, you could just increase your short position even more and most likely be successful as they will continue to
bleed red.


CDTI is more like a biotech than a company that is out to make profit.


Overall, great article with the exception of the Honda business.

Yikes, it feels like something is very wrong with this "article". I don't know if it's the fact that it's a hit piece reverse
constructed by a short-seller, the mean-spirited tone, the slandering of people no longer working for the company, the
misinformation on the company's products and customers, the conspicuous omission of the game-changing materials
technology and the IP associated with it, or the strident use of negatively charged language. The last time I read a
short recommendation anywhere near this skanky was on Advaxis(ADXS) a cancer immunotherapy developer which I
also happen to own. Same deal. Rabid short-seller casting aspersions based on ancient history, long gone
management, cash burn- a very narrow and selectively constructed hit piece. The day the short recommendation was
published on Seeking Alpha, the stock was 6.50. Within 90 days Advaxis was trading above 20 and the short-seller
was presumably up to his neck in margin calls. I believe CDTI is on the verge of a similar break-out.

This slanted article would not even be a good post on the Yahoo Finance message board, much less pass for
journalism. 
Just a couple of glaring examples, it creates the impression that CDTI is not doing business with Honda now while
actually Honda uses CDTI's catalyst on some of its cars and has for years now. 
Also, the authors must have intentionally left out the recent news that CDTI's Durafit will be used by the NY City
Department of Sanitation on its fleet of trucks which number about 7,000. 
There is no mention about CDTI's new Synergized Platinum Group metal (SPGM) diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC)
which decreases platinum group metal use by 80% and no mention of Spinel Technology. 
A fitting punishment for this would be for the authors to have to present the bull case for CDTI as best they could but
the world is unfortunately not that fair. 
I have to wonder if the authors are using this cyber-garbage to try to drive down the price to cover their short soon.


15 May 2015, 08:45 PM


rayonmanl
Almost 48 hours since Comments point out the ongoing Honda business and the Department of Sanitation
deal, not to mention the national Durafit distribution deal recently announced, yet no correction or
acknowledgement from the authors. 
I must correct my comment to read that the Dept. of Sanitation in NY has about 3,000 trucks and street
sweepers, not 7,000.

I think there are some facts and some misleading statements, which means always do your own DD. I have to say
this company had problems in the past, but I think things are getting cleaned up.


Ray, good point, don't know why the author did not reflect the recent developments by NYC sanitation.

I agree that the article presents half the truth. I agree that there is significant cash burn and a near term share issue is
inevitable, I am certain the company has cash remaining only for another two months from now. However, the article
talks about Honda motorcycle whereas CDTI provides catalysts for their cars more than motorcycles. Also it ignores
Spinel, and recent announcements on distribution partners etc. There is great potential here. In the short term there
might be more dilution, but in the long term this could turn into a >$1bn company. 
It is a risk for sure, however the technology is new and far from obsolete and the potential market is huge -in the bln's


19 May 2015, 06:55 PM


jp.ace
People overestimating Honda being a customer. Honda is a customer because CDTI sells them product under its own
cost and market price, compensating it by endless dilutions.


Spinel tech is nothing exclusive, just google and you will find that there are over 10 research labs testing their own
versions + the real heavyweight players in this business. Also people should understand that cdti is a micro player on
this market.


CDTI is like 5 men biotech trying to fight with PFE in commodity business. 
Yes, there is a chance, but Powerball has better odds.


03 Jun 2015, 09:14 AM


Mirdad
Didn't know about the other companies researching spinel. Do you know if any of them have patents or patents
pending. 
I'll have to dig a little further.


Good post.


I noticed this latest fluff PR with AP has no dollar figure attached to it.

They all call it by different names, but thinking that industry heavyweights like BASF, Johnson Matthey,
Umicore just sitting in their hands waiting until someone comes up with cheap solution, so they can buy their
licence is a delusional.

I totally agree and that is why no one other than Honda has given them an order and also why no one has bought
them out. To think that multi billion dollar companies are not researching and advancing the next zpgm technology is
indeed delusional. What supply chain manager in their right mind would team up with a company that is listed by
accounting professionals "as a going concern"......?
