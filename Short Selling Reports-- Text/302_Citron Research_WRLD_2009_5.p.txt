WORLD ACCEPTANCE
CORP (NASDAQ:WRLD) :
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS
A BORDERLINE-LEGAL
PONZI SCHEME WHOSE
DAY OF RECKONING HAS
FINALLY COME.


Over the past almost 8 years Citron has put
together an unparalleled track record of
uncovering scams.  It is our opinion that as this
story unfolds, it will rank right up there with the
best of them. 


Citron exposes the only publicly traded
“Installment Loan” Company as a
potential ZERO!!


Citron uncovers appalling consumer loan
practices, at least two ominous and
previously-undisclosed consumer class
action lawsuits, potentially catastrophic
regulatory risk, and the worst portfolio
loan risk we have ever seen in a publicly
traded company.


Citron introduces World Acceptance Corp
(NASDAQ:WRLD) and advises readers that there is

a lot of substance to this story.   There is a huge
disconnect between reality and the image that
World Finance presents to its customers and Wall
Street.  Citron will lay out the contrast with its
customary links, and as usual, invites readers to
judge for themselves.


Undisclosed Lawsuits  ( Yes, plural intended ! ) 
and Insider Stock Sale


First and foremost Citron notes a lawsuit �led in
New Mexico, just a�rmed by the State Supreme
Court clears the way for class action status,
overturning the mandatory arbitration clause in
World Finance’s loan contract terms.

[http://www.publicjustice.net/briefs/Cordova_Brief_020508.


Second, a separate suit �led Feb 9, 2009 in Illinois
state court, also seeking class action status, alleges
the company’s loan forms violate the Federal Truth
in Lending laws.  The company has not disclosed
either of these suits, or the direct business risks
they pose to WRLD.


Meanwhile the company just reported “great
earnings” in an 8-K, and two days later, WRLD’s CEO
�led and sold stock.  As a matter of fact, the insider
selling has been so constant that as of writing, the
CEO holds only 125,000 shares of stock — not very
much skin in this game.


The company has had years to disclose the New
Mexico suit and over three months to disclose the
Illinois suit, and has not done so as of today,
probably because they are  in a legal �ght for their
lives to just keep the business operating.  In part 3
Citron will show how almost every state they

operate in, as well as the federal government, is
taking a long hard look at these predatory
practices. 
Citron believes that if the federal government or
any state that they operate in imposes even slight
changes on the way they do business, the
catastrophic risks of WRLD’s entire loan portfolio
will be exposed and this entire company could just
“go away”.


Citron Research Roadmap


In this report, part 1 of a multi-part series, Citron
will introduce you to a business so unbelievably
abusive of society’s most economically vulnerable
citizens, you simply will not believe it is even legal. 
In fact, it might not be legal for long — in its current
form.  In the regulatory risk section, we will show
you, in the freshly penned words of the company’s
own business association, that they indeed fear
they may soon be put out of business.


In part 2 we will reveal how the company indulges
in accounting shenanigans which, in combination
with its inconceivable fee structure, allow it to front-
load earnings exaggeratedly while burying a
growing mass of loans of dubious collectability on
its balance sheet.


In part 3, we will review the various regulatory
initiatives underway at the state and national level
aimed speci�cally at preventing the type of abuse
World Finance in�icts on its borrowers.  We will
describe the lawsuits challenging World
Acceptance’s business practices and the validity of
its existing loans.  We will also review a civil case
won against the installment loan industry with facts
so outrageous that it serves as a “poster child” story
for why sweeping regulation is required.

Dirty Secret #1:  Entire Business Model Runs
on “Loan Flipping”


The company claims these loans are for the
unexpected medical bill or car repair — which
sounds like a fair rationale….until you read WRLD’s
10-K, where you come upon this:


“In �scal 2008, approximately 83.0% of the
Company’s loans were generated through
re�nancings of outstanding loans and the
origination of new loans to previous
customers. A re�nancing represents a new
loan transaction with a present customer in
which a portion of the new loan proceeds is
used to repay the balance of an existing loan
and the remaining portion is advanced to the
customer. The Company actively markets
the opportunity to re�nance existing loans
prior to maturity, thereby increasing the
amount borrowed and increasing the fees
and other income realized. For �scal 2008,
2007 and 2006, the percentages of the
Company’s loan originations that were
re�nancings of existing loans were 73.3%,
74.3% and 75.6%, respectively.”


This statistic proves that WRLD’s business model is
overwhelmingly dependent on an unsavory and
increasingly prohibited practice called Loan

Flippping.  Not only do they engage in loan �ipping,
they brag to Wall Street that they actively market
the �ipping of loans!  They try so hard to stay under
the radar that they are the only business with 900
branches and no branch locator on their corporate
website.  www.worldacceptance.com
[http://www.worldacceptance.com]


Here is how the business really works:


Someone walks into one of these storefront
locations to borrow a small sum, say $100 to $300. 
With just a signature and a list of references, he
gets an 8-month loan with a fee payable up front
(tacked onto the loan balance), and a loan with
interest calculated using a frontloaded method. 
After two months, whether he tries to pay o� the
loan, just make his monthly payment or neither, he
is aggressively sold a renewal loan.  In appx 80% of
the company’s loan transactions, the customer has
signed a “renewal” and is handed a few more
dollars.  The catch is there is a new set of fees
tacked onto the loan balance, bookable as
immediate revenue to the company, as well as
more front-loaded interest (more about this later). 
Any subsequent installment payments made by the
borrower will go almost exclusively to interest, and
the borrower will face a higher payment threshold
to reduce his principal.  This is how the e�ective
APR on these loans can quickly spiral to above
100%.


The dark purpose of the “active marketing” of
re�nancings is to ratchet up a borrower’s balance to
a value that exceeds their next check, be it SSI,
unemployment, social security or welfare, assuring
that they will be unable to pay o� their loan in full. 
(Yes, industry employees have already testi�ed to
this practice in court cases.)  This traps borrowers in
a cycle where most of their payments will be
applied to fees and interest, and not reduction of
principal. That is the “sweet spot” for the company’s
pro�ts.


Even though the company charges o� a hefty sum
for bad loans, Citron asks the question that the
market will have to decide: 
What is the real value of a loan book comprised of

appx. 700,000 unsecured loans averaging $800,
owed by borrowers who have been �ipped
multiple times, have already paid MORE than
their fair share of interest, who have been
exposed to intense collection harassment as
documented in class-action lawsuits, and whose
total payments have already far exceeded the
principal…..but still owe more than they ever
borrowed?


That is the question that we will all soon be able to
answer.


Dirty Secret #2:  The Face of Installment Loans
Victims.


A human face was given to this shadowy business
when a lawsuit was won in usually business-friendly
Oklahoma, on behalf of a mentally disabled man
whose installment loan was handled with such
abuse that he was driven into homelessness. 
Although WRLD was not the primary defendant,
they were an active perpetrator, extending a loan
to a man with an IQ of 59, to pay o� his previous
installment loans to another company – after he
had already been �ipped 25 times!  
. 
Here’s the recap of the lawsuit.

law.com/content/default.asp?contentid=21]  
(Please scroll down halfway to “Security Finance
Predatory Lending Practices”)


The circumstances of the New Mexico case
(Cordova) are just as outrageous (see above links.)   
Citron will examine these suits and their
implications in parts 2 and 3.


Dirty Secret #3:  The Company Itself Fears The
End is Near


Citron notes the obvious changes in the political
environment with regard to consumer protection. 
These will be detailed in part 3.  For now, let us
observe that, regardless of the legislative debate
about what level to cap interest rates, if “loan

�ipping” is prohibited, the music stops for the
installment loan business – it is e�ectively over.


Don’t take our word for it.  Look at the words
penned by the hastily-formed industry mouthpiece
comprised of World Finance and a few of its
competitors to �ght regulatory change: 
http://www.nilaonline.org/
[http://www.nilaonline.org/]


“Enactment of this legislation will not only
restrict what installment companies may
charge for our services, it could well force us
out of business altogether.”

Conclusion


As the �nancial pressures of unemployment,
foreclosure, repossessions and bankruptcies take
their toll on the country’s most economically
disadvantaged, political pressure is mounting
within more and more states, as well as federally, to
take action to curb predatory lending practices.


Citron believes the prospects for sustainability in
this business are bleak, not just in terms of social
policy and politics, but WRLD’s exceedingly dubious
�nancials also fail from a business standpoint.  Any
reasonable “stress test” of WRLD’s iceberg-size loan
portfolio would render the company a zero.


Cautious investing to all.
