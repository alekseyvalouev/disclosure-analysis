Just Like Omontys.com, Affymax Is Likely To Disappear

Past case studies can provide important information about how current events are likely to
play out. Regarding Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY), we conducted in depth research looking
for past examples of drugs that had been subject to recalls and subsequently made their
way back onto the commercial market in the United States. We hoped that this would
inform our analysis of its drug, Omontys, which has been recalled. We didn't find many
case studies and in the examples that we did find, the facts and circumstances
surrounding the drug and its reintroduction were extremely unique with few similarities to
the current situation with Omontys. This reinforced our initial conclusion that a return of
Omontys is very unlikely. We present two case studies below (Tysabri and Lotronex),
which we believe delineate key characteristics of drugs that have a reasonable chance of
being reintroduced to the U.S. market following a recall. Omontys has none of these
characteristics. As a result, we remain short Affymax, with a price target of $0.44.


TYSABRI


Tysabri was approved by the FDA for treatment of relapsing remitting forms of multiple
sclerosis (MS) on 11/23/2004. At the time, Tysabri was thought to represent a significant
advance in the treatment of MS, with studies showing Tysabri was effective in substantially
reducing patients' relapse rate. This table from a 2004 JPMorgan report summarizes key
differences among MS treatments at the time:

However, on 2/28/2005, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn after two reported cases of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML] associated with patients receiving
Tysabri for MS, including one death. In conjunction with the withdrawal, the FDA stated:
"FDA continues to believe Tysabri offers great hope to MS patients" (note the FDA did
not make such a statement about Omontys).


After an exhaustive study that included reviewing each patient who had been administered
Tysabri, an FDA advisory panel unanimously voted in favor of Tysabri's return to market,
requiring no additional studies in March 2006. On 6/5/2006, the FDA approved resumed
marketing of Tysabri under a special restricted distribution program with significant
limitations recommended specifically for, "patients who have not responded adequately to,
or cannot tolerate other treatments for MS."


Unlike Omontys for the treatment of anemia for patients on dialysis, Tysabri demonstrated
a meaningful improvement in MS therapy for a broad population by reducing relapse
rates, slowing disease progression, and improving patients' quality of life. While Tysabri
could also be administered on a more efficient dosing schedule (IV monthly vs. SC daily-
to-weekly for other MS drugs), there was no mention of this factor in the FDA's decision to

re-approve Tysabri. We believe the key benefit of Omontys over existing drugs in the
market, most notably Epogen, is its ability to be administered on a less frequent dosing
schedule, and aside from this, Omontys demonstrates very limited clinical benefits over
existing treatments. Importantly, even this benefit is of limited utility to dialysis patients,
because many of them need to visit dialysis centers multiple times each week for
treatments other than Epogen. As a result, we believe it is very unlikely that the FDA re-
approves Omontys based on its rationale for re-approving Tysabri.


LOTRONEX


Lotronex was approved by the FDA for treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome [IBS] in
women whose predominant bowel symptom was diarrhea on 2/9/2000. In October 2000,
the FDA announced it was re-evaluating Lotronex as a result of reported serious adverse
reactions. On 11/28/2000, Lotronex was voluntarily withdrawn after reports of 5 deaths
and additional bowel surgeries.


According to an FDA briefing document [pdf] from December 2000 to December 2001,
following the withdrawal of Lotronex, both the manufacturer and the FDA, "received an
unprecedented number of communications from physicians, IBS patients and IBS patient
advocacy groups requesting that the withdrawal of Lotronex be reconsidered." This
resulted in an FDA Gastrointestinal Advisory Committee being convened to review
Lotronex. The advisory panel voted 14-2 in favor of approving Lotronex for IBS with
diarrhea as the predominant symptom subject to severe marketing restrictions. On
6/7/2002, the FDA re-approved Lotronex for restricted marketing only in patients with ALL
of the following symptoms: (i) significant stomach cramps and pains or bloating, (ii)
inability to control the needs to have a bowel movement or have "accidents", and (iii)
inability to lead a normal home or work life because of the need to be near a bathroom.


The FDA released the following statement along with its re-approval: "The FDA is aware
of the need to balance between access to effective therapies (particularly when
conditions are serious, debilitating, or life threatening, and when no satisfactory
alternative therapy exists) and protection of the public from serious drug-related adverse
events. Since the withdrawal of Lotronex, the FDA and GSK have received numerous
emails, letters and telephone calls from patients who related how their IBS symptoms
were not responsive to any therapy other than Lotronex, and how their quality of life was
adversely affected by its withdrawal. FDA has determined that in some patients the
benefits of Lotronex outweigh the risks associated with the use of the drug" (emphasis
added).

Unlike Omontys for the treatment of anemia in patients on dialysis, Lotronex had patients,
physicians and patient advocacy groups all agitating for its re-approval. There were also
"no satisfactory alternative" therapies for a segment of the population suffering from d-IBS.
We have not seen the same constituents advocating for re-approval of Omontys; there are
safe and effective existing therapies for patients on dialysis suffering from anemia. As a
result, we believe it is very unlikely that the FDA re-approves Omontys based on its
rationale for re-approving Lotronex.


An Ominous Sign: Omontys.com is Gone


Lastly, we would like to point out that far from advocating for the return of Omontys,
Takeda's latest action, removing the Omontys.com website, appears to be a sign that it is
simply hoping memory of the drug fades into oblivion. When we attempted to visit
omontys.com on Friday 9/6/13, we were expecting to see the same old website that had
been up since February. Instead, we found that the site was down. When we checked
today, the site was still down. We think that means one thing-Omontys is not coming back.


This is a cached version of the website from 8/26/13, and this is what we had expected to
see:


But instead, we saw this:

We weren't sure if it was just us, or if it was down for everyone, so we checked here:


It wasn't just us.


We thought that maybe the skeleton crew at Affymax forgot to pay their bills for a month,
so we checked the domain registration:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1685162-just-like-omontys-com-affymax-is-likely-to-disappear 6/23


Omontys.com is managed by Takeda, not Affymax. Per the latest AFFY 10-Q, "Takeda
assumed full responsibility for OMONTYS, including the ongoing recall and investigation
of OMONTYS as well as any subsequent decisions as to whether the product may be
subject to reintroduction…". The website, administered by the company that has sole
discretion over the reintroduction of Omontys, is down. We think that means one thing-
Omontys is not coming back.


CONCLUSION


Tysabri and Lotronex were re-approved by the FDA following recalls for very different
reasons-Tysabri was re-approved due to its efficacy, and Lotronex was re-approved
because there were no satisfactory alternative therapies and patients wanted the drug.
Omontys does not have these characteristics. What we do know about Omontys is that it
is a drug associated with life-threatening risks, with unclear clinical benefits at best, and
there is no publicly available data around risk factors and how to reduce the risk of
occurrences of serious adverse events. We believe these case studies overwhelmingly
show that the most likely outcome is that Omontys never comes back. Finally, it appears
that the website for Omontys (www.omontys.com), administered by Takeda, is down and
has been since at least last week. We think this means one thing-Omontys is not coming
back.

Comments (77)


John Walker, an Affymax director and "biotechnology industry veteran with more than 30
years of experience in the healthcare and biopharmaceutical industries" apparently
agrees, dumping all of his AFFY shares on 8/28/2013 at $1.92.


We remain short AFFY with a price target of $0.44 per share based on our probability
weighted scenario analysis, which is described in depth here.


Disclosure: I am short AFFY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

position clearly, and I thought it was well written. I am long, but I am glad to have someone point out that the website
omontys is down, and do research into it.


I think the only thing that I take issue with is the price target. 0.44 looks arbitrarily chosen. Why not 0? Is 0.44 where
you would close the position, or is it your 1 year target?

pharmaman58
Joel,


Right. That board is a short infested jungle. Here are some facts Alpha might have mentioned:


First, Affymax owns the royalty rights to OMONTYS for $180MM so there is a whole lot at stake here for
Takeda and Affymax.


Second, Takeda has hundreds of millions invested into Affymax and OMONTYS, so shareholders would not
expect them to just walk away.


Third, there are dozens of drugs that have equal or worse side effects than OMONTYS currently on the
market.


Fourth, evidence from the large trials proved safety and efficacy or the drug would not have been approved.


Fifth, look at the usage history of OMONTYS. Everything going fine for months and more than 25,000 doses,
and then three attributable fatalities from a few dialysis centers and none from subQ administration. What
happened? Were the Fresenius dialysis centers not monitoring these fragile patients closely enough?


Please read the Fresenius letter: http://1.usa.gov/17OWQDu


Lastly, and really all that matters, now we just need to wait patiently for the data to be released by Takeda on
their timeframe, and the likelihood of OMONTYS return to market.

By the way, the $180MM does not include perpetual global royalties--which could be huge.


11 Sep 2013, 08:08 AM


livalytl
Pharmaman, you are right about the $180 Million but those are JUST for Milestone Payments...Then there
are the Perpetual Royalty Payments on top of those which average about 17% on gross sales of Omontys.
For each 10% of Amgen's market share (which currently has a monopoly on this market) these royalty
payments are worth about $1.50 per Affymax share Per Year !!! That's is NOT a price per share but an Annual
Yield per share...30% takeaway from Amgen equals $4.50 per share per year in Royalties...In Perpetuity!!!


Add that Royalty Stream back to the $180 million which equals a bit over $4.50 per share (using 40 million
shares, though it is really closer to 38 million) and discount back that to net present value. NOTE: While some
have argued that Affymax's net operating lost tax carryforward may ('May') not be bought by a third party, the
first $560 million in Milestone Payments and Royalties are all Tax Free!!!

AE what are you trying to prove with this article? AFFY not getting as low as you tought? Com'on. A website taken
over by Takeda makes you think Omontys is not comming back. realy? If you called the FDA they would have told you
Takeda is now in full controle. Maybe another reason why John Walker sold all his remaining 16540 shares... I guess
you did some DD on the insider buying and selling to. Strange that there are insider selling (director CMO CEO)
between 4 and 11 dollar, just months before AFFY hit hights between 20 and 27 dollar. You realy think these 16540
shares are a prove that omontys is not comming back. You realy think closing down the website is a prove of
Omontys not comming back? And what's with the 0.44 target? If you are so sure of all the things you write then i
would put a price target of ZERO on AFFY... Why 0.44? It just makes no sence.


The PPS of AFFY is not comming down like you expected, today you saw the reversal in the chart and you pulled
another rabbit out of you hat... Com'on you are losing all credibility with articles like this... But hey there wasn't much
credibility left was there. Yours, David;

Hi loyal SA Readers:


Here is AFFYMAX’s Website and I am holding strong and may add more on any dips TY: http://www.affymax.com


Also, the Company has shown in the filings that there is about $7.5 million in the bank for going forward and some
carryover legacy expenses, so we have lots of staying power I am told. If you dig further you will see that almost all
large creditor obligations have been paid off so a dissolution is not likely if you can read the company's last few
months actions posted on its website.


Please see the latest company filings for more factual information.

Because the upside potential is massive based on the price prior to withdrawal. Is it a risk? Yes. But where do
you know the potential of a spec stock in terms of price before you invest. And if you did your homework you
would know they are spending about $150,000 per month or 70 months of normal ops since bringing in TBG.

to 5 million now, however they are in the neighborhood of 7.4~7.6 million with a burn rate of 50k~100k a
month. Cash is not the issue here. Let's look at it from a perspective from someone other than you who just
blindly throws out misinformation.

7MIL. Current assets are down to 12MIL on 06/31/2013 from 57 on 03/31/2013. These are facts that your
investment decision should be based on, not your assumptions. Oh, did I mention 14MIL in current liabilities.
And you are telling me cash is not a problem?

In the interest of full disclosure, I work for Takeda, so homework is there :) And frankly, I don't care about the
potential of a stock and neither should anyone, I care about the potential of a one-drug company when
making investment decisions. Based on public information out there, it is almost non existent. You're better off
playing roulette, at least you get 48% odds there.

Alpha--


I hardly know where to begin except to say you are truly scraping the bottom here in your single-minded quest to drive
down the share price of AFFY.


1. You use two examples of drugs that were re-approved by the FDA as examples of why OMONTYS won't be re-
approved. Are you serious?


I think you just made the case that OMONTYS re-approval is likely. The FDA has a long history of re-approvals when
they believe problems have been solved, and I have faith in Takeda to investigate, solve the problems and get
OMONTYS re-launched. This is one of the largest and most respected biopharma companies in the world. If they
planned to mothball OMONTYS, we would have heard same long ago.


You have a slight misstatement about Tysabri. It was not voluntarily withdrawn. It was forced off the market by the
FDA. And how do I know? Because I was a vendor to the company who developed the drug. And even though forced
off--it was re-approved. Now what does that tell you about FDA policy.


2. You use the OMONTYS web site unavailability as a reason why the drug will not be re-approved??? Are you
serious??? Of course the site is down, the drug is temporarily off the market. Leaving the site live would be confusing
to patients, providers, and interested parties, don't ya think?


I thought some of your other attacks on AFFY were at least somewhat credible. This piece? I would label it in-
credible. This piece needs a black box warning.


10 Sep 2013, 06:14 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yes - by looking at drugs that came back we can see the elements that are needed. The
most important is that the drug fills an unmet medical need. This was true for both Tysabri and Lotronex.
Omontys meets no unmet medical need. Hence, I think the chances it comes back are very small.

Simply because one director... sells all their shares (16.5k @ approx. $1.92 is pocket change IMHO) does not indicate
that Omontys will go into oblivion... You really should do more DD and check the NASDAQ site and you would see
that a substantial number of "Officers" to include John Orwin (former CEO and now Head of the Board of Directors)

I did look at the form 4 (research before I write is second nature to me) .... It is "you" that really should read
the entire document. John Orwin sold 16,334 shares on June 27, 2013 and then gifted 15,000 shares on June
28, 2013 and "Continues" to hold 76,666 shares.


Like I mentioned in my previous post..... check the NSADAQ site for the correct information with regards to
who is still considered as AFFY Insiders (4 individuals) who continue to hold their shares.... a total of about
177k shares altogether!


With that being said..... all other info you published in your article / articles carries "No Credibility", IMHO,
because of your attempt to dissuade other investors with partial / manipulated information.


With such a short and evasive answer without answering my question.... Apparently "You" are the one that
shorted @ $0.78! Did GWP give you the tip that $AFFY was going to go bk right away?


BTW, I am thinking that when a Company has nothing to sell and no money in the bank....... Wouldn't their
Share Price equal "0"? How did you get a Target price of $0.44? Mighty generous of you!


Again, I see your article as a desperate attempt to manipulate share price to cover your short position just
before "Good News" released! I can understand your desperation when I consider the math.... Shorting
1,000,000 shares @ $0.78 would put $780,000.00 in your account..... Buying 1,000,000 shares today @
$1.50 to cover would be..... "OUCH"...... $1,500,000.00.... You just might want to submit your articles to a
paying publisher(s) for publishing as "Wishful Fiction" to cover your anticipated losses..... Have a Blessed

The headline is inflammatory and misleading. Again, the OMONTYS web site "disappeared" because OMONTYS was
voluntarily recalled by Takeda. The web site will be back when OMONTYS is back on the market. You wouldn't want it
any other way and neither would patients or medical professionals.


With its current cash position, AFFY will not "disappear" for years.


Alpha--this is a very simple investment thesis and its time for you to stop confusing your readers.

Investors in AFFY believe the global pharma Takeda intends to do what it takes to get OMONTYS back on the market
and protect their $800 million investment. That's it, that's all there is. If we are right, AFFY is a five, ten or twenty
bagger. If we are wrong, then our investment is probably worth pennies per share.


My 30 years in the industry says we are right. My 30 years in the industry says that Takeda would have long ago
announced the shelving of OMONTYS if that was their intent.


Have to say, you got under the skin of some longs with this article, and maybe that was your intent.

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Another way to look at the disappearance of some Omontys.com is that Takeda wants the
drug to go away and getting rid f the website is a good step in that direction. It seems to me that's a pretty
good conclusion here. We will know soon whether or not the drug is going to be withdrawn. A voluntary recall
can frequently lead to the drug sponsor withdrawing the drug, such as with Vioxx. I will try to write another
article examining some drugs that were voluntarily recalled and then withdrawn and I will show why those
drugs are better comparisons for Omontys than drugs that come back. This might also help you conclude that
Omontys will not come back. In the meantime, here's a list of withdrawn drugs - http://bit.ly/17OWHjt - note
that many drugs that were originally subjects of voluntary recalls, like Vioxx, were ultimately withdrawn.

Uh-huh. Takeda could keep the OMONTYS site live and, devil-may-care, confuse the daylights out of patients

AE's hypothesis that a voluntary recall frequently leads to the drug sponsor withdrawing the drug is hardly
farfetched in Omyntys case. Indeed, Affymax's own press release, dated April 2, 2013, reports "discussions
with the FDA including a potential withdrawal of the OMONTYS New Drug Application (NDA)."

Adverse Event profile even remotely like Omontys and it was an antibiotic in the same class as six comparable
antibiotics and was deemed "redundant" and not returned to market. ALL others had adverse event and mortality
statistics far worse (FAR WORSE) than Omontys.


Conversely, there are currently hundreds of Rx's on the market today that have worse A.E. (what a coincidence, eh)
and mortality stats than Omontys and remain on the market...This includes Acetaminaphen which just a month ago
was cited as having 97 deaths (from one of many AE occurrences with fatalities, especially from liver failure).
Acetaminaphen is still on the market and will likely be forever.


Most significantly, the most likely cause of the three (3) fatalities under Investigation by Takeda is Anaphylaxis, a
completely treatable reaction (if caught in time and properly dealt with by epinephren) experienced by hundreds of
drugs and various hyper allergenic foods (e.g., peanuts, shellfish, etc.). The author completely ignored the
Anaphylaxis probabilities (which are extremely high, even cited originally as such by the FDA) and the ease of treating
such a condition...And also ignored the fact that the fatality rate in question is 3 (under investigation) out of 25000
patients who used Omontys (none had problems after first dosage) which in medical terms is statistically insignificant.


Fact checking is critical for such articles and this one seems to have not done any industry recall or Omontys case
specific research.

AE--you know the answer of course. OMONTYS is administered less frequently, delivering the same or better
treatment result.


Less expensive for insurers, less hassle for patients--and only your complicated math reached the conclusion
that Epogen was "much safer" than OMONTYS.

both adverse events and fatalities (particularly due to cardiovascular issues) along the entire usage life-cycle,
whereas Omontys ONLY experienced the 3 fatalities under investigation by Takeda during the first 30 minutes
of First Dosage...And NONE when administered subcutaneously...These out of 25000 patients and up to a
half million administrations of Omontys. Statistics do not lie, they tell a good part of the story.


But the rest of the story is that Omontys is the First FDA Approved drug to take on Amgen's ESA Monopoly.
And with once monthly (versus every other day) Medicare, Medicaid and the Insurance companies
desperately want the substantial cost reductions (in terms of both drug cost AND medical services time) that
was originally brought to them by Omontys. If you want to ignore the ultimate weighing in by these third
parties by all means do so, but the cost advantages take the Efficacy (a wash), Safety (a plus for Omontys)
and COST which goes entirely to Omontys equation to the most compelling outcome which is the restoration
of Omontys by Takeda!!!

Author’s reply »  There is a reason the drugs get pulled from the market post approval - the approval studies
are often not large enough to show adverse events that happen at low rates but that nonetheless are
unacceptable side effects (like death) given the alternatives. See Vioxx as an example.

This is easy to understand. O is no better than other ESAs. O's clinical trial (PEARL) and actual patient usage has
proven O to be unsafe. Why would the FDA allow O back? Convenience you say? O's convenience is "lost" on CKD
dialysis patients who must go to a clinic 3x week to be infused when competitive ESAs would be administered.
Significantly, Roche's Mircera, approved to treat anemia in all CKD patients (not just O's CKD dialysis patients) can
actually claim convenience since it is adminstered once every 3 to 4 weeks. Mircera has been withheld from the US
market until mid 2014 due to a patent settlement with Amgen, but has been marketed in Europe for years.

If it is no better than other ESA's then that is just fine. You could also reword that as just as good. Makes no
difference. The Pearl trial is not relevant because they are not using O for that indication. You know these
facts but you continue to say this over and over.


11 Sep 2013, 07:16 PM


YngvaiMalmsteve
The PEARL trial is relevant now given the recall. This is because the rate of AE's in the PEARL trial was quite
high. This brings up the critical question as to why were the AE's higher in the PEARL trial, which was one
healthier patients, compared to the EMERALD which was on sicker patients? This makes no sense...unless
the AE rate in EMERALD was abnormally low. Then it makes perfect sense.


A very strong possibility is that the AE rate was abnormally low in EMERALD. This would not be the first (and
won't be the last) time where AE rates have turned out to be higher than what were detected in a clinical trial
(EMERALD in this case).

Godwin-- 
More stretched truth here. Every biopharma in the world faces litigation on a number of fronts. Most lawsuits
disappear or settle for a fraction of the damages sought, and it takes years.


All of which you know, of course, but you and Alpha have a three-part mission: 1. distortion; 2. confusion; and
3. misdirection. All leading, you hope, to panic selling and a lower share price--which is where you have
placed your bets.


Takeda is investigating. They have not pulled the plug on OMONTYS, and that means they are working their
hardest to resolve issues and re-launch.


This is good news and it is the only news.


Given Takeda's track record globally and in the diabetes space, and given the tiny, tiny percentage of patients
who presented with serious reactions to OMONTYS--I am betting they will succeed.

with worse track record, and how Omontys is simply wonderful everyone is cheering for the drug. Well prior
investments are sunk costs and are not relevant in any decision-making (Accounting 101). There is going to be a

in their clinics, given the bad rep. In addition, Omontys downside and the potential for litigation will be reviewed very,
very closely before any decision is made. So to me, that's enough to be pessimistic. However I hope I am wrong, the

Alpha, Although the drug is "redundant" it is used in fewer doses and therfore cheaper than Epogen... Google is a
wonderful thing:


It’s All in the Dosing – and the $$$ 
The key differentiator for Omontys is in the dosing. As a once-monthly injection, Omontys immediately has significant
advantages over Epogen as patients and doctors will almost certainly prefer the convenience and added compliance
that this will inevitably bring. But whilst patients will be going to have their dialysis 2-3 times a week anyway, the
timing is perfect – the US CMS has recently replaced the “cost-plus-markup” methodology that stimulated so much of
the EPO sales with bundling rules for the reimbursement of dialysis drugs. This means that there is a single “fee for
service” for dialysis – which in turn means that a three-weekly drug like Epogen will really push into profit margins for
dialysis centres. A once-monthly injection, on the other hand…

It is over ten years since a new erythropoiesis-stimula... agent (ESA) reached the market, despite the fact that there
has been a significant need for new alternatives for some time – and particularly since existing drugs on the market
have struggled with safety concerns in recent years. All the major EPO-type drugs – including some of the best-selling
drugs in the last few decades like Epogen, Aranesp and Procrit – have received significant regulatory warnings
related to associated cancer and heart problems, and sales at Amgen, which manufactures many of these drugs,
have been decimated. This has in turn led to major development hurdles – the onus is on showing the products are
safe, whilst having similar or better efficacy than well-established agents on the market.
