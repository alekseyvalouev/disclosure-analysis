Why Is Air Media Falling?
Apr. 30, 2015 9:40 AM ET23 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Air Media rebounded on Tuesday as retail investors "played the bounce" in
anticipation of a company response.


After the company responded on Wednesday, the stock opened lower, traded down
and closed at the lows of the day, down 12%.


Air Media has now disclosed new information which is pressuring the stock.


We can now see clearly if there is a "deal" or "no deal".


What about the WiFi business ?


Summary


Last Friday (several days before I wrote about it), shares of Air Media (NASDAQ:AMCN)
fell by around 20% on heavy volume in pre-market trading. It happened to be
immediately after the release of the company's annual report. It appears that someone out
there actually bothered to read the annual report. But shortly thereafter, retail day
traders pushed up Air Media's stock on continued speculation about a potential "deal" to
acquire the company. The stock closed flat on that Friday. But traders were clearly a bit
shaken.


On Tuesday, I highlighted at moxreports.com the fact that Air Media "had no deal" with
Shenzhen Liantronics. It was solely the belief in that deal that had propelled the share
price upwards by as much as 150% in just a few weeks. To the extent that there was no
deal, the stock should be expected to fall by at least 50%, back to around $2.00. This is
just common sense.


Following release of my article, the stock fell by as much as 14%, but rebounded to close
basically flat on the day.


As far as I can tell from Chinese trading sites such as xueqiu.com, the buying came from
Chinese retail buyers who expected a strong response from the company.

As expected, Air Media did put out a response to my article on Wednesday. The
company's PR was entitled "AirMedia responds to false allegations". It did not mince
words in saying that:


The Company believes that the allegations and accusations set forth in the article
are false and inaccurate and contain numerous errors of facts, misleading
speculations and malicious interpretations of events.


As soon as the PR was released, the stock opened lower. It traded steadily downward and
closed at the lows of the day, down 12%. The drop looks set to continue.


The reason the stock fell is that some investors actually bothered to read the contents of
the press release. Despite the confusing and reassuring verbiage in the PR, we can see
that: a) there is no deal; and b) new (and potentially greater) issues of concern have been
revealed.


As shown below, the stock continues to be heavily held by retail investors (particularly in
China) who have clearly failed to read the actual disclosure. The bet is simply one based
on speculation of "deal" or "no deal".


There are 5 key problems which were raised from the response PR, and which are
causing the stock to now decline. Although some retail investors can be slower to catch on
as they grasp these problems, Air Media is likely to see a much more rapid decline.


Problem #1: What about the "due diligence"?


In its response to my article, Air Media noted the following:


The claim that Liantronics has not even conducted due diligence in connection with
the Transaction is erroneous. In contrary, Liantronics engaged a major PRC
accounting firm, a recognized PRC law firm, a qualified PRC assets appraisal
company and a recognized PRC financial advisory firm to conduct due diligence of
AM Advertising in March 2015.


I have no doubt that Liantronics has engaged an accountant. I have no doubt that
Liantronics has engaged a law firm. I have no doubt that Liantronics has engaged an
asset appraisal firm. Of course they have. Duh.


So why do I say that Liantronics has not done due diligence?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 3/16


It is… well… um… because Liantronics told me so.


In fact, to emphasize this point, Liantronics was good enough to contrast Air Media with a
different situation where they actually HAD completed due diligence resulting in a real
deal. We can see from this deal what it would actually require for Air Media to get a deal
out of Liantronics.


On the same day (April 7th) as the original Air Media PR, Liantronics announced that it
had completed a transaction for a very different media company, Shenzhen Precise
Focus Media 深圳市精准分众传媒有限公司(no relation to the former U.S.-listed Chinese
company called Focus Media).


In that case, Liantronics had completed due diligence (yes, Liantronics told me so) and
found that its target was: a) profitable; and b) growing rapidly year-over-year.
Liantronics announced that it acquired a 28.4% stake in Precise Focus for around $12
million. We can see the parts about the profits, profit growth and profits targets in the
announced key deal terms.


Key Point: If you believe that Air Media's advertising sub will earn $31 million in 2015,
then you should believe that this deal will ultimately go through. If you believe this, then
you should buy Air Media stock with both hands, and do not stop until it hits around
$6.50.


Precise Focus is very different from Air Media


The point to be made is that Liantronics' basis for the pricing, even on just a tiny 5% stake
in Air Media, was that the Air Media sub earn an audited profit of $31 million in 2015.
Otherwise, Liantronics has the full right to simply cancel the transaction.


Unlike Precise Focus, Air Media has been losing money for 5 years. Unlike Precise Focus,
Air Media's business has shown continuous declines in revenues. Unlike Precise Focus,
Air Media has already given partial guidance that revenues are set to decline further. Of
greatest concern is that nearly 50% of Air Media's concession rights will expire by the end
of 2015, with aggregate concession fees of over $400 million. These are the reasons why
Air Media is looking to get out of this business.


These are also the reasons why Liantronics will not end up buying the Air Media sub
(once due diligence has actually been done and financial results are in for 2015).


On April 7th, Air Media told us: "AirMedia Sells 5% Equity Interest of its Advertising
Business for RMB150 million".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 4/16


This statement was wrong. It was factually incorrect. It was erroneous. There had
been no binding or completed deal.


The point is that Liantronics has not even done due diligence. In contrast to the April 7th
press release from Air Media, there is no deal. It is something that is to be considered by
Liantronics once they have actually done the due diligence and come up with acceptable
financial numbers.


So the question now becomes: "Will there be an eventual deal?" Read on.


Problem #2: What about the $31 million in profit?


In its original April 7th press release announcing the deal, Air Media failed to mention the
fact that the basis for pricing on the supposed deal was a net profit of $31 million. The
company gave the impression that this 5% stake was a "done deal".


Key Point: If Air Media had mentioned this $31 million profit term in its original press
release, the stock would have never shot up in the first place.


In its more recent response to my article, the company addressed many points that I
made, but quite notably stopped short of saying anything about the $31 million profit as
the basis for pricing. The fact that Air Media said nothing in its response PR about the $31
million profit target is a key reason why the stock fell by 12%.


Air Media did state that once the company divested several money-losing business lines,
it "believed" the sub would be profitable (to some extent). But that statement should be in
doubt even with just cursory analysis of those tiny divestitures. This should be fairly
simple.


The two businesses in question are: a) TV-attached digital frames; and b) airport digital TV
screens.


Back in April 2014, Air Media disclosed that:



http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.nX9a.htm#1stPage
5/22/2018 Why Is Air Media Falling? - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 5/16


The interactive platform is built on our TV-attached digital frames and will integrate
with our digital TV screens in airports in the future. By sending a text message or
scanning a QR code through mobile devices, air passengers can attend lucky draws
to win attractive prizes. Through the interactive platform, clients can continuously
reach and engage air passengers not only at airports but elsewhere in their daily
lives through mobile devices. We believe that this interactive platform will not
only increase the media value of our products by attracting greater viewer
attention, but also enable us to charge clients an effectiveness based
performance fee in addition to the regular display fee.


First point: Within just 9 months of that bullish disclosure, Air Media announced that it
was divesting the promising TV-attached digital frames business, describing it as
unprofitable. At the same time, the company announced that it would be divesting itself of
its airport digital TV screen business, again unprofitable.


Second point: These divested businesses were tiny in size. Air Media divested itself of
81% of the TV-attached digital frame business for just $1.1 million. The digital TV screen
business accounted for just 5% of revenues in 2014.


The key point here is that these divestitures were so small that they are clearly not going
to swing money-losing Air Media to a $31 million profit all the way from a $25
million net loss - even as other revenues are in sequential decline. Anyone can do the
math here.


But again, I repeat: Anyone who believes that Air Media's sub will earn $31 million in 2015
should certainly be buying the stock with both hands. Because that is the basis for pricing
on Liantronics taking this supposed 5% stake.


The fact that investors do not believe this is borne out by the 12% drop in the share price
following the PR.


Problem #3: What about the "put options"?


Another major reason why the stock fell after the press release was that this was the first
time that many retail investors came to understand the "put options" embedded in the
supposed "deal".


In the original April 7th press release, Air Media failed to mention the fact that this "deal"
could be cancelled for any reason whatsoever.



http://ir.airmedia.net.cn/phoenix.zhtml?c=214947&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2007130
5/22/2018 Why Is Air Media Falling? - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 6/16


The company has described one of these options as a "call option" and the other as a "put
option". But both of these options amount to the same thing: the right to cancel the
transaction. Each of Liantronics and Air Media therefore have the full right to simply
cancel the deal. As a result, I continue to use the term "put option" for both of these
clauses.


In its response PR, Air Media noted that:


... Liantronics requested and has obtained a put option to revoke the Transaction
after the expiration of the Waiting Period.


The reason that the stock originally soared by 150% over several weeks was that the
initial press release from Air Media indicated that the company had a "done deal" on 5% of
the Air Media sub. That "done deal" fueled the speculation that Liantronics would buy the
entire company for $500 million.


Yet, even the 5% "deal" can simply be cancelled for any reason (such as the $31 million
profit target), or in fact, cancelled for no reason at all.


The 150% run-up in the stock was nothing more than a naïve retail trade based on
incomplete and misleading information that had been put out by Air Media.


Problem #4: Air Media will now exit the advertising business?!?! Huh?


In its initial press release, Air Media announced: "AirMedia Sells 5% Equity Interest of its
Advertising Business for RMB150 million". This was then repeated in the annual report
that came out last week.


Shareholder approval for that proposed transaction was apparently not required, because
the transaction was very small. But now, in its response to my article, Air Media has
revealed that:


We intend to sell the remaining equity interests of our advertising business in
the foreseeable future so that we can focus our resources on the exciting Wi-Fi
business.


This statement alone clearly hit many investors as a thunderclap. This statement alone
would have caused pressure on the stock.

5/22/2018 Why Is Air Media Falling? - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 7/16


The "advertising business" comprises 80-85% of the business of Air Media. The company
is suddenly planning on exiting it entirely. This is the equivalent of Starbucks
(NASDAQ:SBUX) saying that it will be exiting the coffee business to focus on selling
pastries - but without ever having told its shareholders.


If true, this exit is a monumental shift in the company's business, yet there was no
disclosure of it in the annual report that just came out a few days ago, nor was there any
hint of this on the recent conference call.


Again, this was a thunderclap.


For those who actually caught this statement in the press release, it is yet another reason
why the stock fell 12% and closed at the lows of the day.


Yet, the fact that Air Media should want to exit the advertising business is entirely
understandable. The business loses money every year. Revenues are declining.
Guidance is for further declines. The company is dumping off once-promising businesses
for almost no consideration. Nearly 50% of its existing concession will expire by the end of
2015, with aggregate concession costs of over $400 million. So again, the desire to get
out of this business is completely understandable.


The point is that if it were a profitable business, Liantronics would genuinely be thrilled to
buy it. If it is not profitable, then Liantronics will not. It is entirely as simple as that. That is
the reason why Liantronics included a $31 million profit condition, as well as the right to
simply cancel the transaction for any reason.


Problem #5: What about this new WiFi business?


Air Media now has said that it wants out of advertising, and for very obvious reasons. The
business is faltering badly. But the new direction of the company into WiFi appears to be
not much better. Air Media would prefer the uncertainty of the new venture over the
certainty (which is bad) of the existing business.


To be sure, the WiFi business has some enticing headline numbers. Air Media has already
told us that the Shanghai Bureau alone had 275 million passengers on high-speed rail in
2014, while ordinary trains had 175 million passengers.


It was already one year ago that Air Media won its first contract to provide WiFi on trains
from Guangzhou Railway Corp . At that time, the company had told investors that:

5/22/2018 Why Is Air Media Falling? - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 8/16


We believe the huge traveler volumes by airplanes and high-speed trains, which can
be easily monetized, have great commercial value.


But now it has been a year later. There have been multiple new WiFi concessions
announced for Beijing, Shanghai, Xinjiang and several others.


Yet, we can see that none of these WiFi announcements has ever moved the stock. The
question is: "Why?"


One reason is that a full year later, we have yet to see any meaningful revenues from this
business. But more important is the business model itself.


In the recent conference call, Air Media stated that it would be giving away the WiFi
service for FREE on trains, and then hoping to make up the losses by getting revenues
from advertisers or e-commerce companies.


This may come as a shock to those few who have thought that Air Media would actually
be charging for providing WiFi. So after a decade of being an advertising company, it will
now be switching 100% of its business into giving away free WiFi. Again, this is a radical
and unproven strategy for the company, which may take years to show any results, while
requiring substantial upfront capital.


This is why such news has never buoyed the stock. And this disclosure is yet another
reason for yesterday's 12% decline.


Some background on the retail hot money


A few weeks ago, I wrote a scathing article about a small company with significant
problems. Following my revelations about this company, the stock was down by more than
50% within a few days. As with Air Media, it was a stock held overwhelmingly by retail
investors.


As with Air Media, that company quickly responded to my article with a strongly worded
press release, and noted that: "The Company believes the statements made in
yesterday's Report are inaccurate and contain numerous errors of facts, speculation and
interpretations of events". Yet the stock fell further.


At this time, I quickly began seeing online commentary from small investors that it was
time to "buy the dip and play the rebound".

5/22/2018 Why Is Air Media Falling? - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 9/16


Much of this was inspired by the company's promise to put out a further response and
business update on the following Monday. With the stock down 50%, clearly there was
more upside than downside, and there was a positive catalyst in the works. Or perhaps
not.


When Monday rolled around, the announcement they got was that the chairman had been
arrested over the weekend as he was attempting to flee the country, following my article
and that the business prospects were actually quite mediocre.


That stock quickly plunged yet another 20%, and was then halted. It remains halted today.
Prospects look grim. Sadly, I see retail investors stuck in this type of "fool's trade" all too
commonly.


Prior to the response from Air Media, the stock had been listed as one of the top 10 "hot
stocks" on Chinese retail trading site xueqiu.com. Today, it fell off that list, and we can see
from the comments that sentiment has turned suddenly negative. Retail sentiment on
Twitter has also suddenly turned bearish. Likewise for retail sentiment on Yahoo Finance.
The comments on Seeking Alpha are almost unanimously negative on Air Media.


The point is that retail hot money can easily move stocks up or down, particularly when
they are relying on inaccurate or misleading information provided by the companies they
follow. These investors often follow simple headlines and rumors, and are much slower to
read the actual disclosure which will determine where the stock will ultimately trade. Some
of these investors will no doubt eventually read the disclosure from Air Media and then
add to the selling pressure. Other retail investors may simply tire of a "headline trade" that
is now faltering. Either way, with the only hoped-for catalysts (a company response and a
hoped-for "deal") now out of the way, there is little to support the stock from further
downside.


Conclusion


The misleading information coming out of Air Media over the past month saw the stock
rise from $2.00 to $5.00 - a rise of 150%.


Air Media led investors to believe that it had a "deal" for 5% of its subsidiary, when in fact,
there was no deal. Air Media failed to mention the fact that there was a $31 million profit
target. The company then failed to mention that the deal could be canceled by either side.
It has now led investors to believe that Liantronics has completed due diligence, when it
has merely hired advisors to simply begin looking at the company.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3120506-why-is-air-media-falling 10/16


And now the company says its "believes" that the sub responsible for 80-85% of its
business will suddenly become profitable after 5 years of consistent large losses simply
due to the divestiture of two negligible subsidiaries.


Despite this never-before-released positive guidance, Air Media has suddenly disclosed
that it wants to exit the advertising business entirely, just to focus on giving away free
WiFi. Until yesterday, it had never disclosed this bombshell to anyone.


The reasons for exiting the ad business are clear. The business has lost money for 5
years straight. Revenues continue to decline. Guidance is for further declines in revenue.
Nearly 50% of the current concessions expire by year-end, with aggregate renewal costs
of over $400 million. Business is very, very rough.


Yet, we are expected to believe that after Liantronics completes due diligence, it will want
to buy the Air Media subsidiary for DOUBLE the current value of the entire company.


This simply defies common sense, and it fully explains why Liantronics required a profit
target along with the right to cancel the deal.


The response PR made these problems much clearer to investors who previously had no
idea.


As soon as the response PR came out, Air Media's stock began to fall and closed down
12%, at the lows of the day.


The company is overwhelmingly held by retail investors. Some retail investors who have
bid up the stock may be slow to figure out the nuances of the PR. But we can see from the
stock price action that the new information in the PR has shown that others are clearly
starting to "get it".


We can see this from new sentiment on retail-focused sites such as Yahoo, xueqiu.com
and Twitter, as well as on Seeking Alpha.


As that sentiment spreads to other fickle retail traders, Air Media could be set for much
steeper declines in the next few days.

I put fair value somewhere south of the $2.05 it was trading around before they announced this equity/debt fiasco. A
5% reputation haircut would be generous considering similar experiences with Chinese related listings; I think -10% or
more is appropriate. That'd put it at $1.85 and I'd chop it from there to account for the strategic looniness that is their
free WiFi on trains product and their unexpected announcement regarding plan to exit advertising to be a pure play.


After reading all the public documents I think the most charitable possibility is that AMCN simply didn't understand
that their sale was really a loan and should be explained as such. Their response to your initial article wasn't polished
(included a screen shot of Nasdaq's website) and your points in this article are on the mark. Maybe they're just
confused. Even then, fair value is 60% lower than current bid.

I would like to see the share price back to $2 as you forecast, maybe even lower according to Brice. Simple logic, I
am able to accumulate it in low price!


BUT, I will advise you/all NOT short this counter! Just remember this is a Chinese Company list in US, it's not a
American company. If you still using the way to value a Chinese company, you will simply lose money in the end!


Good luck!

Richard -


Excellent work and I am onboard for a small taste. Obviously I agree with your targets and timelines but I also need to
remind any shorts of the play book available to the opposition.


The most obvious risk is for Liantronics to make all the moves heading towards a deal. Announce the financing,
disclose the deal sheet, announce board participation...decorate the tree with low cost glitter and pedal shares to the
sucker retail market. Probably 20 -30 million trading profit before they pull the plug. We have to assume they are all
lying so it seems a good bet that they won't stop just because you are on their case.


And lets not forget unfunded funding - pulling the shares lent to the short community - bringing a the second bidder -
management offering to buy it - and the circus never ends.


Keep up the good fight.

Holy smokes, someone read the annual report of a sketchy microcap? Why is this article not on the front page?!
Uninformed retail longs actually not only opened the annual report, but maybe even read some or all of it! Someone
call the WSJ, this is news. Call 60 Minutes, they're going to do another special and this is bigger news than the LL
debacle.


Nice report.

For friends who want to short, I hope you go and understand the risk. Go and check how many outstanding share you
can borrow to short, and if build huge short position, need consider if the company got privatize offer, what you will do.

For friends who want build short position on the coounter, think twice before you do. 
It will be sad if you build your short position just based on this article (I don't deny Rechard's article is a good work).
Try to do "due diligence" for what happens now in China capital market. Try to understand why the asset in China now
is so expensive based on your analysis.Try to understand what is the motivation behind Liantronics. 
BTW, USD 25 Mil is consider a quite small money for Liantronics, and what they actually pay for the 5 percent of
AMCN is much less, think why :)

I won't trust any man's word on wall street i don't care who it is. I'll make my money on the street by my own
merit, Shorted AMCN and wow it really went down so far that i lost on a 7.90% upside day. No more advice or
looking at blogs or even listening to articles on Seeking Alpha I'm done with people that know as much or less
then me.

And I probably ought to add the likelihood of paid flacks on message boards. You can recognize them by the lack of
any activity prior to the "client" asking them to make supportive comments on public venues.

Look at this noob thinking that one day of price performance is material or even relevant at all in a
manipulated stock. Call me in 12 months and tell me what the pps is.

Tuesday trading volume was about 6.9 million, the stock was up 1.2%, not as you said"rebounded to close basically
flat on the day.". why don't you admit the fact?


If we use average 5 dollar per share, long buyers spent more than 30 million on Tuesday. You must be naive to think
"the buying came from Chinese retail buyers".


You refused to accept the fact that Liantronics did due diligence. Just because " 
It is… well… um… because Liantronics told me so.". But don't you remember Liantronics also had a public
announcement about the deal with AirMedia on the April 7? It is also a public company. Are you saying Liantronics
also lied? Why do you just hear what you want to hear.


If you really think there is no deal, just get more short position or buy put option.


Wish you good luck

AMCN is breaking down. It took out the 20 day moving average today and looks like the next stop will be the 50 day
moving average at around $3. The 200 day average of $2.38 might be support in the short term.

"As you know, we endeavor to transform into a leading in-flight and on-train Wi-Fi operator in China. We would like to
capitalize on the sale of our advertising business at a much more attractive valuation to companies in China so that
we can focus our resources on the exciting Wi-Fi business. We are excited about the agreement with Shenzhen
Liantronics Co., Ltd. to sell 5% equity interest of our advertising business for a consideration of RMB150 million in
cash. We intend to sell the remaining equity interest of our advertising business in the foreseeable future. We are in
the process of restructuring our advertising business according to the aforementioned agreement. Meanwhile, we are
also discussing with other unrelated third parties who expressed interest in buying our advertising business,"
commented Mr. Herman Guo, chairman and chief executive officer of AirMedia.

hi Richard - any thoughts on AMCN here? earnings were pretty weak and cash burn was impressive. nevertheless the
stock continues to rally...

Chinese stocks are hot..... not smart to short any of these names. Look at WBAI CHOP AMCN...... earnings aren't
existent but shares are up 100-200% in short order.


4 mill Chinese brokerage accounts were opened last month on the retail side - supply and demand 101.


CNTF reports Tuesday am


171mm in cash 200mm in real estate, 4G smart phone biz ramps in q2 along with smart watch ramp and a GPRO
durable camera launches in q3... at 60mm mkt cap the shares could double like these names. Stock went to market
via IPO thur Merrill


good luck

Richard, this is good analysis but the wild card and plausible explanation is that Shenzhen Liantronics or senior
executives is in cahoots with AMCN management to pump and dump.


Here is how I would run a scam like this:


1) AMCN sees a low stock price and calls up a friend at Shenzhen Liantronics to issue some non-binding acquisition
agreement or some binding agreement with a lot of "wiggle out" clauses.


2) Guys at AMCN and Shenzhen Liantronics already take positions in AMCN stock before the announcement.


3) These guys make a nice profit from $2 to $4 or now to $7.


All Shenzhen Liantronics or the guys they are in cahoots with needs to do to keep pumping the stock is to release
little morsels here and there about this phase of DD being complete whatnot. They have all the time in the world.

Yes, eventually the scam run out but they can keep the charade up for a long time. Meanwhile shorts pay borrow
coasts everyday as this is going on.


The problem with the short theory or the buy put theory is that they have more time than we do.


Unlike NQ where it's about financial fraud, there isn't an accusation of financial fraud or an investigation that is putting
pressure on the company to achieve a deadline (i.e. 20-F not filed, SEC asking questions, etc.). This is a merely a
case of a company doing a pump and they can do that forever, practically speaking.

Any views on the recently announced "transaction" by AMCN? Pretty interesting trading action in the stock over the
past couple of days.
