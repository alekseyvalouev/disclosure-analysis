Why Is Uni-Pixel Falling?
Jan. 25, 2013 10:08 AM ET227 comments
by: Richard Pearson


In the space of 10 weeks shares of Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) more than tripled from
$6.00 in November to a high of $19.67 in January. Trading volume increased as much as
100 fold from just $200,000 per day to over $20 million per day. The catalyst for this
upward move was a press release, which came out on December 7, and an outpouring of
bullish opinions from Seeking Alpha authors. The predictions from the authors have
consistently stated that the company is a 10-20 bagger and will quickly become a "multi-
billion dollar company."


Since that time, the share price has quickly fallen back to $13.80, a decline of 30% from
the recent high of two weeks ago. The shares have now declined in each of the past five
trading days on substantial volume of around $12 million per day.


MDB Pulls its Research and Uni-Pixel Begins to Plunge


Two things are contributing to the continuous drop. First, two short-biased articles came
out questioning Uni-Pixel's technology. Second, immediately after the short articles, MDB
Capital removed all of its research reports from its website with no announcement or
explanation. These pages had all been available to any reader up until two weeks ago
when they were suddenly removed. MDB had also eliminated all reference to a number of
former case studies, which highlighted 10-bagger stocks that have since imploded to
pennies on the pink sheets.


Many investors who have become extraordinarily bullish on Uni-Pixel are likely not aware
that MDB takes large equity stakes in the low float stocks that it covers (including Uni-
Pixel) and then employs unregistered analysts in Nicaragua to write bullish reports on
these stocks. MDB then reserves the right to sell these shares as a principal, and even
take short positions


MDB stocks have demonstrated a persistent pattern of surging (sometimes by several
hundred percent) following MDB's involvement and a flurry of optimistic but vague press
releases. The low float of these stocks contributes to the exceptionally sharp rises that
can be seen even with the slightest amount of positive news. Yet MDB's deals also have
shown a persistent pattern of imploding thereafter, at which time MDB ceases research
coverage. By that time MDB has presumably exited the stock.

The fact that MDB has now pulled all of its research from its website may be a
reason for near-term concern.


A number of bullish authors have consistently cited the research of MDB Capital in arriving
at their billion dollar and 20-bagger conclusions. However these authors and experienced
investors failed to mention the key disclosures contained within MDB's research. The
disclosures made by MDB are all so unusual in the world of finance that it is quite odd that
the authors failed to highlight them when putting out their tremendous forecasts.


Because these reports have been removed by MDB, I used a web service called
archive.org to retrieve the contents. Archive.org contains a feature called "The Wayback
Machine," which trolls through billions of web pages every day and then archives them for
future reference. As a result, we can still see most of the data and disclosure, which has
been removed by MDB.


I will use disclosures from Uni-Pixel as the most relevant example, however I encourage
readers to view the other MDB reports using the Wayback Machine to see the consistency
of this disclosure.


I have also found historical MDB presentations, which have been archived elsewhere.
These presentations contain case studies, which show the spectacular results of MDB's
promotional research with examples of 10-bagger stocks. However, the case studies have
now been discontinued by MDB (along with the research) due to the implosion of the
companies after MDB's involvement.


MDB deals: sharp spikes on vague news, but then the plunge.


It has been a consistent theme that MDB obtains an equity stake (including free warrants)
in a very low float stock right before initiating coverage on the stock. MDB then bestows its
"MDB Best And Brightest Award" and "MDB ASTRUM Award" upon its new investment.
As with Uni-Pixel, a series of vague but promising press releases come out from the
company and the stock price soars dramatically. MDB then disappears for a period of time
and then the stock plunges back to pre-MDB levels. At some time later, MDB comes back
and issues a "re-initiation report" just in time for the company to raise money. Then the
whole process begins again.


It is certainly notable that whenever MDB puts out new bullish research on its latest "billion
dollar" reverse merger, the firm seems to benefit from an outpouring of independent
analysis from ultra bullish authors in various online locations. Examples from past MDB
deals will be highlighted extensively below.

What About Craig Hallum?


It is notable that MDB companies seem to frequently appear in Craig Hallum conferences,
research calls and equity financings and seem to always get very bullish attention and
price targets from Craig Hallum. Craig Hallum's involvement will also be highlighted in the
examples that follow.


Uni-Pixel -- A Recap and a Starting Point


MDB first became involved with Uni-Pixel in 2010, but then disappeared as the stock price
plunged. According to an MDB case study:


"the company was pre-revenue with 2 months cash and 3.1 million in convertible notes
maturing in 2 months". MDB's stated activities included:


Lifted company from OTC.BB to NASDAQ Capital Markets
Executed financing to raise $17.25MM including over allotment
Actively covering with research coverage and introducing to investors post
financing.


In 2010 MDB also presented Uni-Pixel with the ASTRUM award and MDB's "PatentVest"
determined that Uni-Pixel was "ranked in the 90th percentile for technology leadership
from over 1,600 small-cap companies."


When MDB first became involved, the stock was trading at just over $3.00. Within weeks
it had nearly tripled, closing as high as $8.40 and within a year it was trading above
$9.00. Then it proceeded to fall.


Following that, MDB seems to have lost interest for a considerable period of time with little
or no further activity or interest from MDB.


But in 2012, when the share price was back down to around $5.00, MDB issued a "re-
initiation report," just in time for Uni-Pixel to complete another equity offering via Craig
Hallum. The "re-initiation report" has now been removed by MDB, but a link to it using the
Wayback Machine can be found here.


The information regarding the unregistered analysts in Nicaragua and the right to take
future short positions can be found on page 7. Earlier in the report we can see mentions of
such giants as Apple Computer (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung.

It is now eight months later. And now, once again, the share price more than tripled
following a "rediscovery" of the tremendous upside potential, which has suddenly
reappeared now that MDB is again involved in the stock. During that time the only positive
news was a single press release in December, which provided minimal detail.


This situation is in no way unique to Uni-Pixel. Numerous examples will clearly
demonstrate this persistent pattern in MDB deals over time.


I have deliberately given numerous examples and extensive detail, which makes
this article quite long. The examples all make the same basic point. Some readers
may feel satisfied after reading just a few. Those readers can feel free to skip to the
conclusion at their own option.


Microvision -- Déjà Vu for Uni-Pixel Investors?


Summary: After MDB gets involved, bullish independent authors seize upon several vague
technology press releases and stock goes to near $50.00. Stock then implodes to below
$2.00. But by this time MDB is long gone.


A few years ago MDB became involved with Microvision Inc (NASDAQ:MVIS), which
develops high-resolution mini laser display and imaging engines. According to an MDB
case study, Microvision had one month left in cash and was swamped in near term debt.
Its situation was therefore very similar to Uni-Pixel prior to MDB. MDB helped Microvision
raise $33 million to pay down debt and maintain operations. More importantly, MDB states
that it "devised approach to reposition the perception of the company with investors."
The approach devised by MDB clearly worked quite well.


Shortly after MDB became involved the company benefited from an outpouring of detailed
technology analysis on Seeking Alpha, similar to what we have recently seen on Uni-
Pixel. Shlomi Cohen began by describing its "serious potential," which he bases on a
newly issued "Buy" recommendation from MDB Capital as well as the attention that
Microvision would get at an upcoming CES conference in Las Vegas. The stock had
blockbuster potential "since the company is already fielding inquiries from leading handset
manufacturers." As with Uni-Pixel, the names of the manufacturers were not given. Is this
starting to sound familiar? It gets better.


When the share price was below $2.00, Craig Hallum then put a $6.00 share price target
on the stock in a "Buy recommendation," clearly sharing MDB's optimism.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 5/73


Just like Uni-Pixel, various Seeking Alpha authors suddenly discovered this hidden gem
and began to publish detailed analysis of Microvision's product and the industry. Just like
Uni-Pixel, Microvision had multi-bagger potential because it had devised a better
technology and because it was clearly about to begin competing head to head with multi-
billion dollar industry giants such as Corning (NYSE:GLW) and 3M (NYSE:MMM).


Microvision continued to announce partnerships with undisclosed global players.
Although the names of the partners were not disclosed, these diligent independent
authors were able to deduce with 100% certainty that it must be Sony Ericsson. Uni-Pixel
investors have now concluded it will be Dell Computer (DELL).


All of this hype caused Microvision to quadruple over the space of less than a year,
reaching almost $50.00 (as adjusted for its recent 1:8 reverse split) despite very limited
and vague disclosure and no actual commercial progress. The stock later subsequently
traded down to around $7.00 (down 85%) as time wore on and revenue did not
materialize as planned and as the partner was not disclosed.


At that time, a second round of press releases from Microvison again pushed the stock up
from $7.00 to near $50.00 - a quick 7 bagger. In the wave-two push, the press releases
included very specific "multi-million" dollar contracts with specific parties such as the U.S.
government, Corning and Lockheed.


Eventually it became clear that these were one-time contracts to purchase prototypes and
other non-commercial applications. As a result, the allure of the headline value quickly
faded. Despite all of the hype and the absolute certainty of many bullish authors, as based
on the compelling press releases from Microvision, the stock has now fallen from near
$50.00 to just $1.90. Despite the many press releases announcing millions in potential
business, Microvision has had nothing but cumulative losses, which now exceed $150
million.


Now that the stock has fallen from near $50.00 to below $2.00, MDB no longer
provides research updates on the company.


Crossroads Systems -- Multimillion-Dollar Partnerships, Multi-bagger Potential


Summary: After MDB's involvement, shares quadruple based on news of major global
partnerships and disruptive technology. MDB disappears, but then "re-initiates" when
stock falls back down to $2.00 with new opportunities.

5/22/2018 Why Is Uni-Pixel Falling? - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 6/73


In 2010, Crossroads was a pink sheet company trading at around $0.20-$0.50 per share.
Relative to Uni-Pixel, the opportunity with Crossroads could be described as even more
compelling. Comparable companies in the exploding high tech field of data storage, such
as Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) and EMC, command market caps of anywhere from $5
billion to $50 billion. Crossroads currently has a market cap of just $20 million.


MDB became involved to help Crossroads raise up to $10 million in new financing in 2010.
Within a six-week period, the share price tripled from $1.60 to $4.80, hitting its peak right
as MDB closed the $10 million financing for Crossroads. MDB received $750,000 in cash
along with 1.3 million warrants on Crossroads Stock.


MDB notes that its services to Crossroads as included "actively covering with research
coverage and introducing to investors post financing."


In 2011 (after MDB was long the stock) the excitement began to build with a stream of
new press releases from Crossroads including:


a partnership with European consulting megagiant Capgemeni (terms not disclosed)
MDB Capital placed Crossroads on its "Best and Brightest List." Crossroads had also
received the "ASTRUM Award" from MDB.
presentations at conferences held by MDB Capital, the Craig Hallum Alpha Select
Conference and Las Vegas industry events.
a new board appointment, who had previously worked at Fidelity
a strategic agreement with IBM (terms not disclosed)
Crossroads reverse split the stock and uplisted to the Nasdaq


All of these exciting developments did not go unnoticed and Crossroads stock quickly rose
to $7.60, roughly quadruple where it had been before MDB got involved.


Similar to Microvision and Uni-Pixel, once the stock peaked out, MDB seems to have lost
interest and disappeared for a period of time as the stock started falling sharply. However
in June 2012, MDB came back, issuing a "re-initiation report." Once again, this
Crossroads report can no longer be viewed on the MDB web site, so the link I included is
from the Wayback Machine at archive.org.


The net result of the promising partnerships with the global giants such as IBM and
CapGemeni has been $18 million of losses without ever turning a single annual profit.
Rather than taking off as expected, revenue has been declining further.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 7/73


Similar to Microvision, Crossroads bottomed out, trading down from over $6.00 in 2012 to
around $2.00 (on minimal volume) at present. But as with Microvision and Uni-Pixel,
Crossroads is now attempting wave two, so the press releases and partnerships have now
(by necessity) become far more specific. In August 2012, shortly after MDB "re-initiated"
coverage, Crossroads had a "non-recurring one-time event" with industry mega giant Iron
Mountain. However, also similar to Microvision, the deal ended up being a non-recurring
one-time event. $3 million of the "deal" was actually an investment by Iron Mountain, and
so does not even count as revenue.


For investors who bought into the 18 months of hype and press releases the results have
been quite the opposite of what was expected. MDB's involvement coincided with a run-up
in the stock to as high as $7.60. The shares now trade at just over $2.00, right in line with
where they were prior to MDB's involvement.


What does this have to do with Uni-Pixel?


At this point in time, readers may benefit from going back to the press release from
December 7, 2012. Hopefully readers will notice a number of key omissions. The press
release:


Does not say who the PC maker is
Does not disclose the amount of the agreement
Does not say over how many years the revenue is to be realized
Does not say if the revenue will be recurring or if this is a one-time agreement
Does not say if the products provided will be used commercially, or just for marketing,
research or prototypes


As with other MDB clients, the presumed reason for the non-disclosure is to protect
"competitive secrets." But if we don't know who the partner is, then it should have been
safe to disclose the dollar amounts. And if neither of those items is disclosed then
certainly we should be able to know if the products will be used commercially as opposed
to simply being used for one-time R&D, prototypes or marketing purposes.


Knowing more detail is clearly very material in making an investment decision. If this were
a $9 million commercial contract to be realized during 2013 alone, then this could be a
very meaningful event for Uni-Pixel. However if it is a non-recurring $2 million contract to
be realized over five years then the effect is basically immaterial. Right now a number of
very bullish authors are simply using their imaginations and envisioning the best-possible

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 8/73


scenario. This was the same optimism that was expressed by authors (and investors) who
drove up the prices of Crossroads and Microvision by several hundred percent before they
ultimately plunged.


Has MDB research ever produced a "billion dollar company"?


MDB has repeatedly laid claim to the successes of two stocks, Medivation
(NASDAQ:MDVN) and VirtnetX (NYSEMKT:VHC), both of which have grown from tiny
companies into companies worth more than $1 billion. MDB does not make the "billion
dollar" claim with any other companies. But the question becomes: just how did MDB
contribute to the billion dollar status of these two companies ?


In both cases MDB's role was to provide an empty shell to these companies so that they
could complete a reverse merger and raise funds. MDB bought an empty shell and then
provided it to the companies, while retaining partial ownership for itself. The point is that
MDB never even covered the companies with research but states that it launched these
companies into the public markets. So MDB sold them a shell.


Now that these companies have gone on to become billion dollar companies, MDB has
suggested that their success should for some reason to be extrapolated to other
companies, which MDB covers on the research side.


ClearSign -- Another 20-Bagger and Billion-Dollar Company


Summary: After several bullish media plugs describing it as a "billion-dollar company," low
float ClearSign surges, only to plunge afterward and become illiquid.


A recent article highlighted from Gene Marcial seems to see things quite differently in
terms of MDB's involvement with VirtnetX and Medivation. Mr. Marcial was formerly a
journalist for Business Week, where he noted his column "was one of the most influential
market columns as it moved the stocks I highlighted each week."


Mr. Marcial is no longer a journalist at Business Week. Now, as a "contributor" to a simple
blog at Forbes.com, Mr. Marcial has prominently highlighted MDB's ability to find "not just
stock winners but great super-stock achievers."


Mr. Marcial highlights the involvement of MDB with Medivation and VirtnetX. For some
reason he fails to notice that neither of these companies were even covered by MDB
research. For some reason MDB's stock picking is also mentioned alongside both Apple
and Google. This entire theme then segues into an incredibly highlighted for MDB's latest
stock pick on the research side, ClearSign Combustion (NASDAQ:CLIR).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 9/73


ClearSign seemed an odd pick for a former journalist to highlight in his blog at Forbes,
especially alongside a group of mega-cap super performers. The tiny, illiquid ClearSign
was trading just 1,000 shares per day and had a market cap of just $40 million. As might
be expected, the sudden high profile attention caused the stock to take off. ClearSign rose
nearly 30% in three days on over 1,000 times the previous volume. The stock quickly
reached an all-time high of $7.55. The stock has now fallen back to $4.90, well below
where it was at the time of Mr. Marcial's plug. Volume has fallen to just 10,000 shares per
day.


The parallels to Uni-Pixel should be clear. In describing ClearSign, Marcial quoted MDB as
saying:


We think it has the potential to be as big or bigger than Medivation or VirnetX
because its technology platform effectively addresses a market that is probably 20
times larger than those of Medivation or VirnetX…The technology is so game
changing that the margins could equal pharmaceutical or software margins…We
expect the combustion industry will soon be lining up to partner with ClearSign and
its valuation will be on its way to a multi-billion dollar level


It wasn't the first plug for a tiny MDB reverse merger. While Marcial was with Business
Week, the publication delivered a described for MDB regarding the now-imploded
Microvision. Seeking Alpha followers were quick to note that plug, in an article entitled
"The Business Week Effect: Watch for Microvision's High Open Tuesday" The exciting
catalyst for a surge in Microvison was described in Business Week as:


The market for the laser-based displays in micro form is huge, as the cell-phone
market is still basically untapped," he says. Joel Achramowicz, an analyst at MDB
Capital, rates the stock a buy and expects Microvision to partner with a handset
maker by summer.


As with ClearSign, Microvision did experience the "Business Week Effect" and rose
sharply as expected. As we know, Microvision has fallen to below $2.00 after trading near
$50.00 in the past. Mr. Marcial also included an interesting development. The former CEO
from MDB's now imploded Microvison has now been installed as the CEO at MDB's new
hot pick ClearSign.

As with Uni-Pixel, ClearSign has now become a hot topic for debate on Seeking Alpha.
Again, the parallels with Uni-Pixel should be clear. The most recent article (November
2012) comes from an author who describes ClearSign with:


This is one of the most exciting investment opportunities I've ever been a part of,
since the Company's technology has the potential to massively disrupt the existing
economic model and environmental impacts of combustion systems. ClearSign is a
development-stage company - there are no revenues yet - and with that carries
substantial risk. But if things continue on the current trajectory, this could very well
be a billion-dollar company.


We can see from their posting history that four of the recent Uni-Pixel authors had never
written about a single other stock prior to their flurry of articles and comments on Uni-
Pixel. As with the Uni-Pixel authors, it is noteworthy that this author had never felt the urge
to write about any other stock ever, even though he states that


I've been involved in founding, building and investing in early-stage technology
companies since the mid 1990s


It is equally noteworthy that when this experienced technology investor finally chose to
break his 20 years of silence with his first article, he discloses long positions in three
stocks, which are currently being promoted by MDB research. The three stocks are ZBB
Energy (ZBB), ClearSign and Parametric Sound (PAMT).


MDB issued bullish reports on all of them in 2012, which were still readable two weeks
ago. Unfortunately, as with Uni-Pixel, the links to these reports were recently removed so
they can no longer be viewed. I have included the reports, which have been captured by
The Wayback Machine as an appendix to this article.


MDB Case Studies -- the Past and the Present


A review of continued and discontinued case studies from MDB is revealing.


I am quite deliberately not "cherry picking" case studies in order to make a certain
point. I have deliberately addressed each and every case study included by MDB
from its archived presentation as well as on its current web page.


A Discontinued MDB Case Study -- Idera Pharmaceuticals



http://www.mdb.com/investors/equity-research-report.html
5/22/2018 Why Is Uni-Pixel Falling? - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 11/73


In a presentation from 2010, MDB included Idera Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IDRA) as a
successful case study. In its current case study page MDB no longer includes this
company for very obvious reasons. As shown in the link, this presentation was archived in
a third-party site.


In 2007 MDB initiated Idera with a Buy recommendation. The MDB case study (which
MDB no longer uses) notes that MDB:


Elucidated why IDRA was superior to competing technologies and communicated
investment thesis to sophisticated institutional investors that resulted in a 3x
increase in market value within 15 months


Key elements of the pitch included details of MDB's "intense due diligence" along with
the fact that "the competition has failed while Idera evolved as the leader inking three
successful big Pharma partnerships with Merck, Novartis and Merck KGA:.


As with Uni-Pixel, the partnerships with established global giants drove the share price
sharply higher. Within 12 months, Idera was trading at over $15.00. At the time of the
MDB case study the stock was already down to $5.00. The stock currently trades at
$0.69.


MDB no longer provides research updates on Idera and no longer cites Idera in its
case studies .


Another Discontinued MDB Case Study -- Maxygen Inc.


In the same presentation, MDB also cites Maxygen (NASDAQ:MAXY) as yet another MDB
success. When the share price was $8.19 MDB initiated Maxygen as a Buy with a $15.00
share price target. Like Uni-Pixel, small-cap Maxygen apparently had some special IP that
put it on par with a mega-cap global giant. For Maxygen, the comparable was $30 billion
Amgen.


The presentation tells us that "IP analysis involved an extensive review of the patent
landscape of MAXY-G34 versus Neulasta (by Amgen)." It goes on to state that "Our
review of the IP revealed that MAXY's optimized G-CSF is distinct from Amgen's Neulasta
at several sites in the amino acid sequence and has novel PEGylation sites that are
outside of Amgen's patents."


Now that Maxygen trades at just $2.44, MDB no longer covers the company with
research and Maxygen is no longer included in MDB case studies.

Yet Another Discontinued Case Study -- Allos Therapeutics


MDB's presentation clearly states in big bold letters that:


subsequent to our research, institutional investors, including Warburg Pincus and
Baker Brothers took large positions. ALTH increased in market cap from $65M to
almost $700M


At the time of the presentation shares of Allos were trading above $8.00, making it a
temporary 10 bagger for MDB.


In 2012 the stock fell as low as $1.25 and MDB no longer covered the stock from the
research side and no longer included it in its successful case studies. Allos was
later bought out for $1.82.


MDB Case Study: Lipid Sciences -- How Low Can You Go?


In its case study on Lipid Sciences (OTC:LIPD), MDB notes that it:


Raised in excess of $80MM in private placements and merger financing.
Took company from inception to over $200MM in market value in 18 months.


Lipid Sciences does still occasionally trade, but on the pink sheets for less than one
penny.


MDB no longer covers the company with research.


MDB Case Study: Hollis Eden -- You Can Still Go Lower


From the MDB case study we can see the following in regards to Hollis Eden
(OTCPK:HRBR):


What MDB Delivered:


Positioned company with a powerful platform technology capable of multiple uses
Arranged seed capital
Recruited board and directors and key management to assist in execution of strategy
Sourced public company and executive merger and financings aggregating
approximately $50MM
Market value of shares reached approximately $200MM in 18 months from when we
started and over $800MM peak market value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 13/73


(Note: the MDB case study still lists the ticker for Hollis Eden as HEPH. The ticker was
subsequently changed to HRBR after the termination of the CEO for cause.)


Hollis Eden at one time reached a share price of $30.00, but now trades for just $0.12
(that is twelve cents). In addition, these numbers need to be adjusted for a 1:1000
reverse split.


One obvious problem was that the CEO had to be fired for cause. Although the company
did not issue a news release, it was noted that:


The possible offenses include misappropriation of funds, fraud, engaging in an
activity that is harmful to the company or conviction of a crime, according to the
contract


After the termination, Hollis Eden changed its name to Harbor Biosciences.


Following the termination, MDB continued to list Hollis Edenamong its Best and Brightest
conference attendees. Accordingto MDB's press release (which includes Hollis Eden):


Bright Lights Conference Will Showcase 50 of the Most Innovative U.S. Small Cap
Companies with Disruptive Intellectual Property in San Francisco on May 10 - 12,
2010


Hollis Eden (aka Harbor Biosciences) is no longer listed among MDB's "Best and
Brightest" and MDB no longer provides research coverage on the stock.


Are there more case studies from MDB?


No. I have deliberately addressed every company that is featured as an MDB case
study as is shown on the current web page and as is shown in the archived
presentations.


Conclusion -- a Few Questions Investors Should Ask Themselves


Many bullish investors will no doubt continue to ask what does any of this have to do with
Uni-Pixel or its billion dollar technology.


These investors (and authors) will point out that Uni-Pixel is somehow different simply
because it has performed such extensive and specific analysis on Uni-Pixel's described
technology. I have quite deliberately refrained from making any evaluation of Uni-Pixel's
technology.

5/22/2018 Why Is Uni-Pixel Falling? - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 14/73


In the past many investors have taken the brief and vague press releases issued by
numerous MDB clients and repeatedly extrapolated billion dollar market caps and 20-
bagger stocks. They have based their predictions on analysis that is every bit as rigorous
as that which has been recently published on Uni-Pixel. However, as with Uni-Pixel, the
underlying information (press releases) on which they based their analysis was often very
vague and open to a wide range of interpretations. As with Uni-Pixel, these investors (and
authors) presented in writing the most spectacular conceivable outcomes based on a tiny
shred of incomplete information.


In November 2012, shares of Uni-Pixel were trading at around $6.00-$7.00 on average
volume of just 50,000 shares per day. Starting two days before the December 7 press
release this began to change. The volume more than quadrupled and the share price
reached a high of $8.50. It seems clear that this material information was not a well kept
secret. Following the press release the low float stock then surged to over $15.00 on
substantial volume, a double from the previous week.


Investors should take the time to re-read the press release and ask what does it actually
say vs. what it is just heavily implying. Investors should ask themselves why Uni-Pixel
could not give any more information than what it has provided. Competitive secrets could
still be maintained by any company even while giving investors substantially more
information upon which to make an investment decision.


Investors should then ask themselves why the experienced investors who are calling this
stock a near-term 20 bagger failed to make any mention of the disclosures from MDB
Capital. These disclosures include ownership of a large stake (including free warrants) in
Uni-Pixel by MDB, use of unregistered analysts in Nicaragua to write bullish reports and
the right to sell as a principal as well as to go short Uni-Pixel. The authors writing these
articles have made heavy reference to the MDB reports such that simply not seeing this
disclosure would seem highly unlikely. These authors have made repeated mention of
various discussions with MDB bankers, but never mentioned the notable history of stock
implosions and discontinued research following MDB's involvement.


And now the research reports from MDB have all been pulled from MDB's web site just as
the stock begins to plunge on very heavy volume every single day. The information was
made fully available as the stock was rising such that it could be widely cited by bullish
authors. But now it is gone.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 15/73


References to MDB's historical case studies, which touted numerous high fliers (gains of
up to 1,000%) have also been removed, but only after these stocks imploded to as low as
the pennies.


Investors should ask themselves why has all of this information been removed without
explanation ? And why has this sudden removal coincided with a steady drop in the share
price of more than 30% on heavy daily volume ?


For those who feel they have an answer, I always welcome any feedback.


Appendix I -- Archived Copies of the Pulled MDB Reports


Once again, it is not my intention to "cherry pick" any information regarding MDB. As a
result, I have taken the time to look up every single research report that has been pulled
from MDB's web site and post the appropriate link from The Wayback Machine located at
archive.org. Not all of the reports were captured by The Wayback Machine, however I
have posted all of the ones that were captured. Readers should feel free to test any and
all links from MDB's web page using The Wayback Machine.


The links are listed below.


Please note: As of this writing many investors have already become aware that these
reports have been removed from MDB's web page. The links, which used to lead to these
reports have now been re-directed to a general information page about MDB instead.
MDB has the ability to re-connect these links at any time so that the reports can become
available immediately at MDB's option.

opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

JTB
Just wondering if Ladenburg is also involved in the conspiracy. They have positive research as well on UNXL.

Very solid article. Thanks for the diligent work & analysis.


25 Jan 2013, 10:27 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Firstly, this article is poorly written and a little difficult to read. 
Secondly, All analysts have winners and losers and that really shouldn't affect your decision. MDB is a high-risk high-
reward type of shop.


Finally, and most importantly, do you do any Due Diligence? If you had, you would have emailed MDB to ask WHY
they "removed" the reports on Unipixel. You also would have realized that ALL of their reports have been removed for
ALL companies. You also would have realized that they very recently gave their website a significant overhaul, which
is why NONE of the pdf links work.


Honestly, it is a little embarrassing that you are hanging your merits on this analysis, when it is blatantly false. I will
assume that this is just a mistake, but If it is not corrected shortly, I will be contacting SA to ask them to remove this
article due to its blatant misinformation.


As to JTB's point, I'm not sure if Ladenburg is involved in the "conspiracy" or not, but Williams Financial Group
certainly isn't, and they have very positive things to say about Unipixel.

Richard is right. All the Research Report links are on the still on MDB's site but clicking them only brings you to their
home page.


Unipixel is one of MDB's client. I assume that's the case with the other companies covered in their research reports.
That's the case with three other companies that are the subject of their research reports Parametric Sound, ZBB
Energy and ClearSign Combustion.


Maybe they see it as some sort of conflict of interest.


25 Jan 2013, 10:56 AM

As for the MDB Research reports...if you click on the links for any of the companies you'll see none of them are

Never read anything on SA and sell in a panic! Always evaluate the information! Chris is right: verify your sources and
make sure you know if all links are down or if it's just the one or 2. And also do note that any new technology does
have a chance of failure and success. It is not directly conclusive that this is a failed technology. It is new but it is not
being abandoned a la PCs.


I will admit that I normally allocate far less to venture capital/ startups but am currently reluctant to sell. The number of
individuals directly employed by this company have a lengthy work history in touch/ sensor equipment and also has
links to management personnel at hardware manufacturers. They are well connected and have relationships with
individuals in management positions at other major firms. You can verify that on LinkedIn.


http://linkd.in/11WPgF6


As quite a few areas of this article is indecipherable, I find it difficult to fully accept your so-called research as valid. I
do not believe you are fully capable of evaluating and presenting information (aka qualifying as an analyst).


25 Jan 2013, 11:11 AM


On Base, Contributor
Richard,


Thanks for the well-written article. I had no difficulty with your few redundant phrases.


To me, your article is of substantial value in describing MDB's disclosures, alone. I would not consider a stock that is
promoted by an organization with such complicit involvement.

Aristides Capital, Contributor
Congratulations, you have successfully proved that microcap companies often have investment bankers that
represent some questionable companies. We have seen bad deals from Ladenburg and from Craig-Hallum, and we
have seen good deals from both as well. Do you think that because GS and MS underwrote a lot of MBS deals that
any company they've done an offering for is suspect? Obviously not.


I've never seen such intense activity on Seeking Alpha from the shorts on a company with a market cap this small.
Having reviewed all of the short arguments in detail, it seems to me that this company has the sort of execution risk

that would be typical for a company trying to go from the prototype stage to mass production, and has a CEO with a
promotional style, but that there is no good evidence whatsoever that this company is a fraud, that the company's
products won't work, that the company cannot attain excellent margins, or that the company's market opportunity is
not massive. To the contrary, probably thanks to the lawsuit and the negative SA articles, this company sports a
discount considerably greater than is warranted for an emerging hardware growth stock.


We are long the stock, and long call options. It is not a large position for us. I much prefer sure things to speculative
names, and this company has a great deal of execution to show in the next 3-6 months, but the shorts in this name
are on very weak logical ground.

I am the Director of Investment Research at MDB Capital. The links to my reports were not removed; actually, anyone
can see they are still there. We re-designed our website a couple of days ago, which caused the links to break. We
are working on a fix and the links should be restored shortly.


There are several other inaccuracies in this article, but I will have to wait to speak with my colleagues to determine
how we decide to respond. At the moment, I will merely note that my phone number is available on all of those linked
reports, and the author of this piece never once tried to contact me for additional information.

Chris Hofmann, Contributor
If you don't believe that they are real employees, then follow their suggestions and call them up. As Ankur
states, his phone number is on the research report.


If you did call them up, you would know they are legit. Too bad you would rather spread rumors then do Due
Diligence.


25 Jan 2013, 07:34 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
No, not curious. I'd classify it as PR/ damage control. Neither negative nor positive but to be expected when
Unipixel is your client -- and people are accusing your company of doing something that they're not (ie.
website down for maintenance/ upgrade vs deliberately removing pages to manipulate perception on certain
firms).


As for whether UNXL will perform in the next 12 months, I will wait and see. Just a lot of research and chatter
at the moment from non-company people. Hmmmm... waiting for the company to announce they are done
with their setup of plants and manufacturing equipment. That will be good news. Cheers!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 21/73


I am Director of Research at MDB Capital. Just a few factual points:


- Chris and others are dead-on -- our research was never "pulled." We re-designed our website last week, and the
links to the research broke. I hope they will be fixed by the time you are reading this; in the meantime, anyone who
wants copies of my reports should feel free to email me using my contact info on our site. I am eager to get inquiries
and feedback on my research, so I more than anyone want to make sure they reports are available to all. (Seasoned
investors will note that it's a little unusual for a bank to give away its research to anyone who wants it; most banks
only provide their work to customers.)


- I am not sure what the author's fetish for the term "Unregistered Analyst" is, but I would like to assure everyone that I
am the lead analyst on these names, and I am fully registered as a Series 86/87 analyst with FINRA. I do have some
unregistered associates in our foreign branch office-- FINRA allows them to assist in the preparation of the report,
provided we disclose their contribution.


- The reason these names are "re-initiations" is that MDB did not have a research department for a short while. I was
hired last January, and since then have been working to re-launch our coverage.


- My name and phone number are on every report. The author has never once reached out to me to determine the
accuracy of any of his claims. Personally, I find it very troubling that Seeking Alpha would allow an author to post this
kind of an article without having to do even the most basic level of journalistic research.

Richard, I'm not a sophisticated writer, just a hick out here in the hinterlands. I'm still trying to figure out what I'm not
supposed to believe about UNXL? 
Is it market size? 
Is it that the Company has zero IP? 
Is it that they won't be able to roll out the film necessary to meet the alleged hyped up demand? 
Is there no cost presently for touchscreens for modern smart phones, or do the Apple's and Samsung's presently pay
$40.00 and up per phone? 
Is UNXL able to provide these large Companies a finished touchscreen for $20.00 with a 50% gross profit margin built
in? 
Does UNXL have an office, or are they just a boiler room? 
Is there a motivation behind some of the recent negative pieces on UNXL? 
I don't think that even the most cynical finance writers would ever have as a thesis for his piece, guilt by association
with MDB, but what do I know. Especially considering that since I've been able to leave my cave, I found out that
there's a thing called the internet that has all the information that was mysteriously deleted from the MDB website.
Hell, You found it!!!!!!

25 Jan 2013, 12:02 PM


Benjamin Padnos, Contributor
I am an investor who wrote the rebuttal piece on ClearSign Combusion (CLIR) referenced in Richard Pearson's hit
piece. What a pathetic attempt to cause fear and manipulate UNXL, which unfortunately I do not own. I am, however,
long a basket of companies where MDB is the investment banker and have done phenomenally well. I'm posting the
"year end" email I received from MDB CEO Chris Marlett which I think does a very good job articulating their model
and addresses fear-mongers like Pearson.


Dear Clients and Friends,


As the year comes to a close, I’d like to take some time to provide all of you with an update on the MDB universe. I
think everyone on Wall Street would agree that this year has certainly seen its ups and downs—through them all, I
remain steadfastly optimistic about the companies we have lifted into the public markets, and immensely proud of the
investors who have joined us.


To begin, I want to share a brief summary of our investment model, because our belief in that model is what grounds
us during these ups and downs in the market.


Our Model


At its root, our model is fairly simple:


1. Find companies with technologies that can be disruptive to very large markets. 
2. Validate their technologies through diligence and the opinion of credible third party experts. 
3. Help them construct an integrated business and IP strategy to get through development and to the point that large
companies publicly validate the technology. 
4. Finance the companies at valuations that increase the probability of generating significant returns. 
5. Launch the companies into the public markets, both to allow the value of the company to increase with commercial
validation and to provide liquidity to shareholders.


Historically, we have seen that when diligence demonstrates that a technology makes sense, large commercial
partners usually validate it. The burning question, of course, is, “When?” Unfortunately, it is hard to know the answer
to that with any degree of accuracy—macroeconomic, supply chain, strategic and operational factors can all play a
role. This is why we fund these companies at valuations that reflect the early-stage nature of the company’s
technology and business.


We have found, however, that when that validation does come, the value generally goes higher than anyone expects.
In general, we have found that disruptive technologies often trade well above $100M when validated by large
commercial entities, and in some cases can trade as high as $1B.


Before that validation point, however, early-stage companies can often face a kind of “valley of doubt.” This is the time
in an early-stage company’s lifecycle in which critics—some whose intentions are good, some whose are less so—try
to poke holes in something they view as being “too good to be true.” Often, these critics will speak loudly enough to
create selling pressure.

5/22/2018 Why Is Uni-Pixel Falling? - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 23/73


This is why we need to do a good job of building faith in our investors—so that this selling pressure doesn’t rattle
them. We believe that active communication is the key to building that faith. To that end, we are working with our
client companies to help them better communicate their accomplishments to both their investors and Wall Street in
general. We are also helping them develop response plans in case their critics come out with spurious attacks.
Finally, we will also facilitate our own public diligence calls with noted industry experts, which we have found can also
help build faith and quell doubts.


To provide an example hot off of the presses: On December 7th, Uni-Pixel, a company we financed in December
2010, announced it had signed a multi-million dollar license deal with a “major PC manufacturer.” Uni-Pixel’s stock
has almost doubled since the announcement. Uni-Pixel is moving out of the “valley of doubt,” and investors who had
faith in the company are being rewarded.


Parametric and ClearSign


Of course, some of the companies we have financed have not yet received that validation. In fact, two of the
companies we have financed in the past year (Parametric Sound and ClearSign Combustion) recently experienced
downward price pressure due to a lack of investor confidence. Both suffered from negative articles published on
Seeking Alpha, links to which appeared on reputable sites like Yahoo! Finance and Bloomberg.


The goal of both of these articles was to plant doubt in advance of lock-up expirations to profit from short selling.
(Unfortunately, they “worked,” and prices did indeed decline as a result.) To that end, the authors of these articles
used words such as “scam” and “fraud” to describe the companies. Of course, we know nothing could be further from
the truth, and that both companies have real innovations and management with the highest standards of integrity. Still,
when people read these kinds of inflammatory words, they ask themselves: “Could this be true?” We believe this
caused panic among investors. (Exacerbating matters were macro trends outside of anyone’s control, including the
weakness in the small cap market overall in October and November, and the push by investors to realize capital gains
and losses in the face of an uncertain tax environment.)


We want to make clear that these critics have not shaken our faith in these companies. We’ve been in constant
contact with management in both cases, and we actually feel more positive about these companies today than when
we originally financed them.


• Technology: Both companies have been delivering on their stated goals with the development of the technology; in
fact, both have exceeded expectations with respect to technological milestones. 
• Validation: Both companies are in active discussions with high-profile commercial partners that would provide the
validation that investors seek. 
• Risk-adjusted Return: Both companies offer exceptional potential returns to investors, as the valuations are still
modest even though the companies have significantly reduced risk since their last financings were completed.


So, as one of my mentors in the business of investing in early stage companies would often say, “Keep the faith!” We
know that we will all weather this storm together.


I want to thank you all again for being part of the extended MDB family. We all wish you a safe and happy holiday
season, and look forward to having you by our side as we enter 2013.


Warmest regards, 
Christopher Marlett

Mr Padnos, you said, " I am, however, long a basket of companies where MDB is the investment banker and
have done phenomenally well."


Care to elaborate with that basket of stocks by MDB?


At least, the author gave a long list of failed "Case studies" by MDB, which spoke volumes. By attacking the
author with empty words only made you look empty.


I'd like to see you list those stocks of yours and let everyone take a look. But I doubt you would do so. We
already knew about VHC and Medvision.

Excellent due diligence of how "Pump and Dumps," so typical of Small Caps, work. Regardless of whether or not the

buying the next big thing only to watch the stock tank as the company burns through cash raised from overly-

It may take few hours and sometime 1-2 days for website returns normal.


Our website crushed few times before due to server problems and always for the hosting company to work 1-
2 days to resolve the problems.


The price drop is a simple correction or profit taking. It is normal to take some profit off the table after it gained
about 100% in short duration.


Stock pulled back big as many may have sold it at about the same time and this is a very small float stock.
Big swing is normal.

the comments, especially of MDB employees, were a funny read. i don't say i believe anything the article
implies, but the reactions were very amusing.


from a sidenote regarding the formerly not working pdf links: technically it does not take 1-2 days to fix a
problem like this. it takes less than 5 minutes, an hour max (if you must call a non-exclusive webmaster first).
every web server provides backups on a frequent basis. it's not a big challenge to restore a single page with
all subsequent internal links and files. especially if a website crashed several times in the past, i'd assume
that technical server security/fallback solutions would have been tightened.


and it is suspiciously coincidental that those links work immediately after MDB got aware of this article.

Richard, I think your article is excellent. I find it interesting that people are commenting more on your writing style (btw
I find your writings perfectly normal) rather than your thesis. It is understandable that you would reach such a
conclusion because of MDB's recent activities. And your example of MVIS is a good one. I researched this company a
couple of years ago, and I totally agree with the pump and dump methods of MDB. What I also find interesting is
MDB's presence in this message board. If a company was experiencing minor glitches, it does not warrant all this
involvement. Your thesis, to me got a lot stronger because of their involvement (ironically).

I also currently have a substantial position in Neonode which I've made a modest profit to date. Unlike UniPixel,
Neonode is proven and expanding rapidly. NEON is at $5. If you haven't already, you should check it out. Z-force has
a lot of advantages over the competition. It has been applied to an almost endless array of applications.


I believe UNXL is still overpriced at this stage at anything above $10 or so. I realize anything can go higher on
speculation. Add in the controversy brewing here, so for now I'd rather put my larger wager on NEON than on UNXL.
For me it is a much safer play, although not nearly as likely to make giant leaps and dives.


26 Jan 2013, 02:37 AM


jsIRA, Marketplace Contributor
Current market cap:


UNXL 141 million 
NEON 165 million


NEON has 33 million shares 
UNXL has 10 million shares


But  
NEON is expected to earn $0.33/share this year and  
UNXL will earn $0.66/share.


Also UNXL could make additional deals and will earn much more than $0.66/share.


Therefore UNXL has the potential to go much higher than NEON does.


26 Jan 2013, 05:54 AM


pahrah
reference FINVIZ


NEON earnings increase this year +64% 
earnings increase next year +500%


UNXL earnings increase this year -14% 
earnings increase next year +159%


reference Morningstar 
-Wall Street Analyst give both stocks a BUY recommendation of 5 (highest possible) 
-both stocks price target is roughly 50% above the current price


And I believe, both stocks have potential to continue to go up in the not so distant future. I just believe that NEON
provides the safer path for the next 50% price increase.


-UNXL is more volatile and being highly promoted as evidenced here.


-NEON is less volatile, z-Force is already being widely used, have positive earnings now and expected to go up 8 fold
next year; and summed up, is the more conservative play. I think NEON is the sleeping giant waiting to explode. If
NEON promoted itself as aggressively as UNXL, I imagine NEON's stock price would much higher right now.

And NEON has the original patent for the "sliding unlock" feature. I still wonder if NEON will ever go after Apple for
patent infringement. For whatever unknown reason, all is quiet on that front.


My big bucks are on NEON for the time being. That could quickly change, as I believe both have potential to be 10
baggers some day in the distant future. Time will tell.

Valuable Insights, Contributor
In our 20+ years in investments, we spend a decade at 3 investment banks ranging from several hundred to tens of
thousands of employees.


We find it shocking that any employees MDB would choose to post in this venue. In our experience, we would be
sanctioned by management, if not fired for doing so. The comments from MDB are critical of this post, but MDB
neglects to disclose information such as fees received for investment banking or ownership positions (ie information
customarily provided by guests on CNBC).


This speaks very poorly for MDB, as if Mr. Pearson's well researched background on MDB wasn't damning enough.


Full disclosure: we have no position in Unipixel.


For any Unipixel longs, we'd be curious to know of any examples of merged Nevada shells that have spent as little as
UNXL (under $10 million combined for 2009-2011. It would be easier to believe this is a Cinderella story if there were
examples of some from the past. Unfortunately this appears to walk and quack like a duck.

To realize now that I had more stock than most of the insiders, I thank my lucky stars to have sold above $19.
This is looking to be one of the most sophisticated ploys I have ever been pulled into. Of course, that has yet
to be proven. I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock tank next week. That said, I also wouldn't be surprised
to see the stock hit $20. What a joy ride.


27 Jan 2013, 09:08 AM

I agree with Valuable Insights on this subject. For a few things:


1) Mr Pearson's article was mostly good. The fact that MDB website is down and thus caused the author to
speculate that the reports were pulled doesn't invalidate the other points made in the article that were spot on.


2) Just because you're a bull and holding the stock doesn't mean you know something for real about this
company. There're always blind bulls in very stock.


3) Look at LPID, IDSR, MVIS, etc. Those colossal failures in research - if that is the right word to use -
suggest typical "pump and dump" by some dubious stock promoters, if one is truly honest with the facts laid
out by the author. Poorly written research reports? I don't buy that argument.


4) One more question - What was the success ratio, winners/losers, by MDB?

Interesting link though the validity of the information to our circumstance is questionable: being a company
with its flagship product in pre-mass production, I don't think this page you're referring to addresses that
information adequately. The speedometer-like object on the right does raise alarms, but coupled with other
known information on the company, I would discount it very much. The net loss bar chart looks horrid, but I
doubt it contains the information of the agreed $ injection schedule set with the OEM.


Here is something you may be interested in as it has to do with the earnings of the company, volume, etc. As
you will note, earnings varied over time though the most recent numbers are promising (up).

When will people realize that this sort of information has absolutely zero bearing on pre-revenue companies?
You can't valuate a pre-revenue company on indicators such as revenue, earnings, and returns. Obviously
they are all negative. That is why the company is <$200M market cap. You have to look at the 'story'. The
potential for revenues and earnings. You have to use qualitative analysis to create an expected probability of
the company reaching various revenue targets over the next 12 months. I have done this in my SA articles,
and my Bayesian analysis tells me that, at $15, Unipixel is dirt cheap.

I didn't make a judgment, rather I asked.


Here is an actual factoid that has caught my attention. Since you have such a close relationship with UniPixel,
I'll ask you.


Raptor Capital Management LP is listed as an insider since they had 10% ownership. They sold over a million
shares at $5.25 on August 9, 2012. I assume Raptor Capital Management LP sold these shares on behalf of
UniPixel to help fund the operation. Correct? If there is a scam, certainly UniPixel has no part, as they would

have waited to raise capital once the share price had gone up. My goodness, Raptor Capital could have

So you see Chris, I'm not your boogieman you tried to paint me. I'm just being a cautious investor before I
make another "big" play.


And Chris, I would really like to understand your involvement with UniPixel. You appear to have what I call a

UniPixel?

I can't speak to Raptor's trading as I have no idea what they were thinking. The only thing that I have heard is
that they came under new management and wanted to change their trading strategies, and Unipixel no longer
fit into their new portfolio.


As for my connection with Unipixel - there isn't any. I'm simply an investor (a rather small one due to my very
limited portfolio size) and I have never received any compensation for any of my research in any way besides
from Seeking Alpha.


My only goal is to spread facts. I have had many great conversations on other articles about Unipixel where,
as you can plainly see, I am not the 'pumping promoter' that you make me out to be: http://seekingalpha.co...


I understand that there are risks involved, but believe that the stock price is extremely under priced when you
take into account these risks and the potential opportunity. I also believe that many people, including yourself
at times, purposefully spread half-truths in an attempt to scare away investors. Maybe you are short, maybe
you want a better entry price, maybe you just like trolling. I have no way of knowing.


What I do know (or at least expect) is that Unipixel has earnings on Feb 26th. While the report will be as
expected (lost money), the guidance and discussions during the conference call will be extremely bullish. I
would also expect 1-2 more PRs before earnings, but they may or may not come.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 32/73


What it really comes down to is this: I am long Unipixel, I want the company and the stock price to do well, I
have undertaken extensive research, and I believe I am on the right side of this investment. I have absolutely
no idea what will happen on a daily or weekly basis, but have my predictions which I have laid out clearly for
all to see for the long-term. Everything that I write is clear, concise, and factual; or it is stated as my opinion.
What bothers me is when people attempt to deceive investors (Xuhua Zhou, Benjamin Wiley) for their own
purposes. This is similar to what you have just done pahrah. You linked to a website that claims Unipixel has
a 96% chance of bankruptcy based on negative revenues, earnings, and returns. You obviously hope that this
will scare people away from Unipixel, or else you wouldn't have linked it. However, when I press you on it, you
admit that judging a company like this doesn't make sense. - This is deceitful, misleading, and dishonest.


The author of this article is doing the same thing with his accusations towards MDB. Before posting, he could
have easily checked with MDB what the issue was, but he never did. I actually knew the links weren't working
and told MDB about it a day or two before this article. It was brought to my attention by an investor asking me
for more information. The author of this article did not perform this DD, because he didn't want the truth. He
wanted a motive.


As an aside, what he states about VHC (one of MDB's successes), also is not true. This is from a separate
message board:


"To correct some points in the linked article, and provide some history... MDB didn't "sell them the shell". MDB
was involved in the original transaction in which the formerly private VirnetX merged with PASW (which
thence became the current VirnetX Holding Corp., VHC), and assisted in raising capital, but it never owned
PASW.


In compensation for its services in the transaction, MDB received a bit over 3.5 million shares in VirnetX
(adjusted for a 1 for 3 reverse split), according to the 14-f-1 filed at the time of the merger."


Again, the author could have easily confirmed that, but decided to mislead investors. No firm is accurate
100% of the time, MDB even less so since they play with micro-caps which are high risk, high reward.


What interests me is that the author of this article has yet to give a single response despite it being attacked
so harshly. Does he have nothing to defend? Perhaps he has no defense. I have sent him a private message
as well, but he did not respond their either.


Pahrah, I do not mean to attack you personally, as I have no idea what your intentions are. However, you
seem to have something against me, and your posts fit into the category of "half-truths" where you
purposefully try to mislead investors.


A quick summary: you post links that the company will go bankrupt, even though you don't believe it. You
claim the insiders don't own many shares (true), but leave out the fact that, together, they have about 4 Million
shares in options/warrants. You claimed that Unipixel may need to do another secondary soon, when this has
been disproven numerous times (as I know you know). You made the claim that they are only in the
conceptual stage, when clearly they have signed with an OEM and are building out production. After all of
this, I honestly don't know if your goal is to manipulate investors, or if you just have the worst due diligence
out of anybody I've ever seen.

I think Pahrah is okay -- he's pretty much said that these articles spooked him to sell out at $19 despite
originally liking the company. Given all the conflicting information, he ends up day trading the stock and a bit
iffy about the whole thing. His alarming information will spook some but for someone who has been following
it all, everything still stays in balance -- neutral, wait and see. I think he is not completely short, not quite
certain it's a long. I can understand that.


And the author of the piece should step up and say something if he wants to maintain his credibility. But what
do I really know -- i am relatively new to SA (used to just read and just recently started commenting/
frequenting the discussions). What do I know about the protocols =)

I do sincerely appreciate the fact that you have done a lot of investigation. I lack the time to dig as deep as
you have. I have probably misjudged you, and so, for that I am sorry.


I think we could have a better relationship if you would not jump to conclusions that I "purposely" am trying to
mislead investors. I'll be honest, I had a year of my retirement money invested in UniPixel before it tripled. I
was elated. By the same token, I began to wonder how something not yet in production could climb so high
so quickly. Yes, I became suspicious, but at no time have I ever tried to purposively manipulate the stock. I
have either been long UniPixel or out. Never short. If you notice, I am a nobody. I am surprised if anyone
would listen to me. I am a has been retired Electrical Engineer who graduated in 1986 summa cum laud (not
that means all that much in the real world). And no, calling myself a nobody doesn't mean I'm not a real
person. It just means I'm not as involved as some here.


In the old days, some people were lucky enough they could "smell" something fishy. Since I've never made
this much money this fast in my life, I admit, I have become suspicious. As I said, I not a guru in stock picking,
although I most often beat the indexes by a good margin.


I own several hundred stock at any given time. I can't even keep in my head all what I'm invested in at any
given time. But I do wake up when a single stock I have, makes enough to help buy my youngest son a
modest home. If I could have as much faith in UniPIxel as you do, I would buy back all those shares I sold. I
bought back about 10% of my original investment which as of Friday was up. I don't want to lose money on
any of my investments, so I don't have any incentive to cause the stock to drop.


Today, I just happened to get up and explore some more about UniPixel. Your repeated attacks against me
have motivated me to attempt become a more informed investor (at least regarding UniPixel). Many of my
stock picks are growth stocks that only require me watching the chart and keeping track of news. I do have a
number of value stocks which I fall asleep thinking about. But almost 40% of my portfolio is small and micro
caps. I have just over two dozen. I pay a steep annual fee to get new small cap recommendations. No, I didn't
find UniPixel on my own. The person who researches them, has done me very well over the long haul. I find
micro caps extremely challenging. Out of all my small caps, only UniPixel is being written about so
extensively here.

Such extreme interest peeks my curiosity. I asked about your involvement in part, because I was amazed that
you were able to follow through with my concern about how UniPixel was linking their Press Releases. I
asked you about Raptor because they had the biggest position and I rationalized maybe they were connected
in some way financing UniPixel. Obviously, if I had the time, I could have figured that out without asking you. I
thought I was paying you a compliment by asking you. I was lazy and thought it was easier to ask you since
you seemed to have close ties to UniPixel. You see we are all prone to making errors based on perceptions
and appearances.


Depending on how this week goes, I may increase my position in UniPixel, but not to it's prior level. I need to
regain my faith. I'll be honest, I feel the discussions on this board have had more to do with the stock price
than any fundamentals or company news. UniPixel might want to hire a PR person about now because of the
impact of this message board.


I feel somewhat better about you personally. Nothing wrong with being zealous about what you believe in. I
can also settle down now my position in UniPixel as it is a bit more realistic according to my comfort level. If
the stock goes to a $100 a share , I would have made a half million or more. I've never been comfortable
holding onto a half million dollar small cap. It would take some real guts for someone like myself to ride a
single small cap stock up that high. I guess I'll never become another Warren Buffet.


Have you considered NEON? I am impressed with the new deal they cut last week?


27 Jan 2013, 03:52 PM


SamsaricSufferer
Pharah, I have been in and out of both NEON and UNXL. I am out of both at the moment. The tech on NEON
is very different from UNXL's. UNXL uses projected capacitance sensing for their touch interface. NEON uses
infrared interference via an X-Y axis array of infrared LED's and detectors for theirs. The form factor for such
arrays presently require a raised border around the touch screen area to encase the LED's and detectors.
NEON biggest application so far has been in e readers such as Barnes and Nobel's Nook. My only concern is
that the present requirement of a relatively wide border area for the sensing array is not an aesthetically
pleasing form factor to todays consumer. Think of smart phones and tablets, they all have borderless flat
glass front's. That has become desirable to consumers because of products like the iPhone and iPad. I think
dedicated e readers are dinosaurs that are going the way of dedicated GPS's. They are evolving into tablets
or being supplanted by them. The Kindle is the prime example. NEON's sensors will only have niche
applications going forward without some technological leap allowing borderless, sleeker designs making them
more acceptable to consumers. Again, all this is just my opinion. Good luck to you.

The author outlined a pattern of investment that referenced multiple instances of MDB's involvement with
companies resulting in their multiplying in value while MDB was involved only to subsequently crash and burn
when MDB's involvement ended. The author also referenced the disclosures made by MDB, and seemed to
suggest that although nothing explicitly illegal was afoot, MDB's overall conduct was suspect and that its

involvement in Unipixel may suggest that Unipixel's trajectory will follow the same path of other companies
with which MDB has previously been affiliated.


Those criticizing the article seem to focus on the broken links and Unipixel itself without addressing the
history that the author went to great pains to outline.


27 Jan 2013, 06:01 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Hello Pahrah,


I had no intention of directly singling you out, and only did so as you seemed to be doing the same. For that, I
am sorry. I can assure you that all I am is an overly-zealous investor. My portfolio is very concentrated, so I
give each position a lot of attention. This is especially the case for Unipixel since it is the largest of my
positions and also the most "exciting" currently (two others are in post-trial litigation just exchanging
meaningless forms... very boring... very slow).


I'll be completely honest with you, I have read SA for a while and, due to my belief that UNXL was extremely
undervalued and under-the-radar, I decided to write my very first article about it. It was posted on Dec 31st,
and the stock rose 26% that day. Since then, I have received numerous comments / PMs either
congratulating me for my great research, or attacking me as a pump and dump scammer. MDB reached out
to me to know if I wanted to discuss UNXL further, as did another professional analyst. I have spoken with
both MDB and the other analyst, and both were very forthcoming and knowledgeable and I had great
conversations. I do not believe MDB to have any malicious intent whatsoever from my conversations with
them.


I always wanted to speak with management / IR, and decided to use this '15 minutes of fame' to reach out to
them. IR was responsive, and I was able to set up a call with them, which I held about a week ago. Again, the
call went great, and I had no reason whatsoever to believe that their was anything fraudulent or suspicious
going on. Reed Killion (the CEO) is clearly very excited about the opportunity and, unfortunately, this leads
him to often promise timelines that he can't quite keep (although they do seem to come true eventually. I don't
think he is used to the sluggishness of large companies). His zeal also leads to a few PRs being a little "fluff"-
filled, although honestly I don't think this is a real problem.


When we had the discussion regarding the "press releases" link, I decided to email IR and let them know that
some people were put-off by this. To my amazement, they remedied the situation almost immediately.


Back to Unipixel... I always believe that everybody should do their own due diligence and everybody has their
own risk-tolerance. And it is very important to discuss both sides of the story. However, some of what is being
discussed in these 'short' articles is blatantly false, which really annoys me, especially when these same
authors / commentors (not you) are the same people who like to attack me personally.


As for NEON, I have been in and out of it a few times. A week or two ago I sold out and put it into UNXL
instead. As SamsaricSufferer said, its opportunity is limited due to the bezel and its difficulties with 5 or 10
finger touch (once you interfere with the IR, if you interfere again in the same x or y axis it won't pick it up). I
have heard that NEON is working on technology to allow for 10 finger touch and bezel-less screens that still
use IR. I hope the best for them because this will be truly powerful, but I honestly don't know how this would

be possible. Is it a sell at these prices? I don't think so, it is fairly safe and will have a lot of design wins in
transportation and military, which should support a $8-$13 stock price over time.


27 Jan 2013, 06:36 PM

Chris, I'll go a step further than just being "sorry" and actually apologize to you: now that you opened up more
about your dealings with UniPixel, I feel you are well intentioned. Overzealous is not a bad thing, but can be
easily misinterpreted, as evidence by my response.


With regard to NEON, I like that they are signing up new players. The latest:

For anyone not familiar yet with Neonode I invite them to visit their new website. http://www.neonode.com
Browse, spend a little time and enjoy. It is obvious that Neonode is getting on top of marketing curve.


Now back to UniPixel, just think if they had a bigger budget for marketing, how that might draw in new
investors, as well as potential unforeseen partners and customers? Just a thought.

I appreciate it pahrah, and same to you.


From what I understand, UNXL has huge interest from OEMs and from institutions. I expect big things
between now and earnings, but could be wrong. Always hard to tell, but I'm just putting my opinion out there.


As for NEON... sometimes I think its incredible, other times I feel like it is one of those things that is "cool" but
not really "marketable" for the cost. Who knows. I might get back in eventually, but for now its all about UNXL
(and VHC and VRNG)

I agree about the z-force shortcomings, but for now, NEON is beginning to earn and NEON is coming up with
new patents. I can change gear on a dime with a $7 trade. Thanks.

Raptor Capital Management is run by Jim Pallotta the Hedge Fund manager. I know of them and I doubt they
would be involved in a situation like you describe.


So I took a quick look. Raptor and its affiliates have held shares of Unipixel since February 13, 2007. So it
was not fund raising for Unipixel but just a shareholder liquidating his position.

UNXL appears to continue to build a launching pad as it still above 50 day moving average and trading
sideways. This may portend another upside move in the near future. Cross your fingers.

Transcend Asset, Contributor
Thanks for the updates, pahrah =) keep them coming! This morning I checked to see if the "sky" has fallen on
UNXL due to Mr Z's screaming about insider sales. Haven't seen anything!


I have not done any research on the stocks you mentioned yet. I am currently very interested in RIM (which
will trade as Blackberry soon). As a tech who loves looking for value stocks, stocks in distress and with
potential mergers and acquisitions, this company is very interesting. Of course, I`ve bought and sold a few
times already. And current volatility proves a bargain for someone who is bullish.


You should do your own research and see if you like it! I did not like their phones for years, but have recently
seen one pre-Z10 and Q10 (the Bold 9900) with touch and the Porsche version which convince me the firm is
truly listening to customers. Also, despite the people selling in fear, the stock now trades in calmer waters and
received many analyst upgrades or confirmations to hold today.


I find BB's CEO more to my liking than Nokia's as I continue to listen to them speak. I am currently long on
both stocks.


Keep the comments coming =)

SamsaricSufferer
It has based / consolidated here. Selling pressure has abated and supply and demand is coming into
equilibrium. With so many shares sold short, it creates its own downdraft. The volume is dumped, increases
supply "artificially" as it effectively increases the float on the shares sold short. Enough shares sold short
creates it's own drop in price. Now that it is "hard to borrow.", those shares available to sell short have dried
up. Any updrafts and they will have to cover, that is what happened with NFLX, lots of shares sold short and
they killed on earnings----> short squeeze. I never sell short, only short with puts. Caps my downside. I don't
know about y'all, but I like my downside capped.

Interesting. I've only done options through an advisor and the guy was an idiot and lost me money in a highly
favorable market for covered calls. I would go to their fancy presentations where he would tell me how well he
was doing. Then one day I finally looked at my account with him! Was I irate and that is when I started to do
all my own stock investing. I've had some ups and downs along the way, but never as bad as Smith Barney
did in a good market. I have a margin account with about $600,000 of available margin on average. I guess I
need to learn enough to feel comfortable doing my own options. I certainly couldn't do worse than the idiot
working for Smith Barney at the time.


NEON is doing great today. CSII is killer after earnings. I bought MPEL in the 11's and it's double and just
keeping chuggin like the Energizer Bunny. I'm as happy as a pig in slop.


31 Jan 2013, 02:40 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Yeah -- I care about the downside so I never look at stocks that are over $100/ share. If I don't own it already,
I'll go find something else. There are other things to do with the dollars. Someone else can worry about how
much more upside potential that thing has.


31 Jan 2013, 02:52 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Personally, I am not a fan of options. I have trouble tracking them and can't run too many at the same time.
Also ties up monies. Preference is to buy value and keep on looking for value to buy.


Might reconsider if I thought the market was tanking though! haha

I'd bet money Richard isn't even a real person anymore. 16 articles on SeekingAlpha since 2009 but 8 have been in
the last two months and everyone is a short idea designed to dump a stock. The eight before, none since 2010, do
not have a single short article.


Also the MDB research links all work as others in the comments have shared.

Ah the irony of slamming MDB for "unregistered analysts in Nicaragua". Where would "Richard" get an idea like that?
We'll that might be the most telling piece in this whole slander piece.


At the end of the day I think I will stick with UNXL's management and board of A+ players who all have excellent track
records. They have more to win/lose then any of us traders and we aren't talking about a team of unknown
"unregistered analysts in Nicaragua" on that front. My money is that they know what they are investing their time in.
Peter Shin alone is enough to tell UNXL is legit.

I don't question whether Richard Pearson is real. I question whether he is right. The blogs at Forbes are just
that blogs. They are not associated with Forbes whatsoever and have their share of hack writers. A prime
example is Gene Marcial.


http://onforb.es/W9geWK


Read this POS article he published on his Forbes blog.


http://onforb.es/VgWtsF


Note this is not a Forbes or Forbes.com article. It is a post on Mr. Marcial's personal blog. That is clear by
reading the comments on the article by a REAL Forbes staffer calling Mr. Marcial out for his distortions to the
point of almost lying in the article. The Forbes Staffer's comments are highly critical of claims Marcial makes
in his blog post.


Again, Richard Pearson posts on his blog. He doesn't write for Forbes.

Transcend Asset, Contributor
Thanks, Ba1k3es -- very interesting reads!


As MDB does small and micro cap, risk is to be expected. Typically, all companies that are just right out of
IPO status, or anything under $5 is higher risk. UNXL is definitely in a unique position all its own -- having
blazed through the $10 range without having the production line setup. GS and other banks have also
promoted flops. It is the nature of investment banking -- they're out to sell the company to investors -- and
yes, sometimes what they're selling isn't that great (typical of Wall Street).


Unless you're buying a blue chip, you'll always have this risk.


Let's all keep our eyes on UNXL and continue to process all information to see if it's a duck or a goose (that'll
lay the golden eggs)!

I've been studying MDB Capital Group's website on and off for the last couple of weeks. I firmly believe to understand
UniPixel one needs to completely understand how MDB is promoting and molding this company. If you believe in
MDB, then you will likely believe UNXL will become a billion dollar company. I say this because MDB only wants
companies with this potential. MDB goes through a rigorous process. MDB has experienced both losers and winners.
I'm cautiously long for now. 
Peace


28 Jan 2013, 04:00 AM


pahrah
When I looking through MDB website I find myself making many of the observations you have. I haven't spent enough
time with what you wrote to know if you are being fair overall, so I'm not intending to critique, just pointing out
investors would do well to consider your observations with an open mind.


In my opinion most of the small start ups that have so called "disruptive technologies" don't generally have much of
chance to become great on their own. Most fail for many business reasons, seldom for lack of a good idea. I think
MTB gives these start ups a fighting chance providing expertise a small company often lacks. Even with strong
support, investor needs to remain vigilant. I have no doubt their assessment of UNXL is extremely optimistic. But who
wants to invest in a start up that sets it sights low?


I wouldn't had invested initially as heavily were not it for major backing from somewhere. I believe MDB increases
UniPixel's chance of success, not diminish it. I don't have to believe a startup company has to become a billion dollar
success in order for me to invest. I need to believe there are others willing to invest long. At a bare minimum, like
anyone, I need to believe the stock will go up long enough for me to make money. I rather invest than speculate.
Small start ups are mostly speculative in reality, but require one to go long, normally forcing you to stomach the ebb
and flow with every tidbit of news. That is where MDB might be beneficial from time to time trying to keep the share
price goosed.

Non-employee director shares vest monthly. 25% vesting for some key employees are today. You have your
dates wrong, Xuhua. Lame.


Vesting has been occurring over the years. That is nothing new. This is how key employees at small firms
who are important to the business are paid. This is a normal practice for enticing smart people to a startup. If
you make a million dollars a year, but are asked to take only $100k salary for the next 5, you might take it if
you get options that vest. So you get paid in stocks.


Key employees of any firm historically do not do a mass exodus. They do take some monies out to pay for
things they like. And you can't blame them if they take such a big salary cut for so long and have been
working so hard.

Not freakin the least bit. This is a great opportunity to get in as you rally. I'm willing to bet 10 to 1 Mr Z is
wrong about $10 by the end of week. I have so much leverage, If I want, I can double my position for every $
it drops. At some point before it ever gets to $10, I'm confident that the real money will step in and put an end
to Mr Z's nonsense. In my opinion, as much as Mr Z wants to believe his BS, he is underestimating the
collective interest in UniPixel. A month ago I would have agree with Mr Z about $10. It is a very positive sign
that support is holding. Mr Z knows it as well and he is foolish if he doesn't capitulate soon. Depending how
much he has at stake if he does cover, will reflect in the price when he does. I'm beginning to believe he is
small potatoes and hot air. Time will tell. I've been wrong before, but not as many times as I have been right.

pahrah, remember when you said this, your starting to sound like one of Chris's personalities.  
"Chris, I'll go a step further than just being "sorry" and actually apologize to you: now that you opened up
more about your dealings with UniPixel, I feel you are well intentioned. Overzealous is not a bad thing, but
can be easily misinterpreted, as evidence by my response."

katgod, ha ha. You'd be wrong. I'm very conservative. Chris is a bit of a dreamer. I wish I could be a dreamer,
but I'm pragmatist by nature.


Mr Z doesn't appear to appreciate capitalism.

I think this stock trades below 10 by the end of the wk...vast majority of the shares are vesting today...if i were the
mgmt, i'd sell as fast i could..as they should...worked hard this past three months to pump the stock to this level, how
could they not cash in the chips...

Well, you AREN'T the management -- and that's where the difference is. In fact, if there was a mass exodus,
the SEC would investigate them. Insiders have to file their transactions. We would know. So you can quit the
scare-mongering now haha!

It only makes $ense for them all to run away pre-production if they were not a legit business. Guess that's
where your views differ from mine.


I think that anyone who works so hard will wait for the pieces to come off the production line. Because THAT
announcement will make the price jump UP. And it's only a few months away!

Yeh they have two days to report...So you'll see on wednesday the mgmt sold a huge amount of shares then folks like
you will panic and sell your shares..we got a drama coming on this stock this wk. its exciting

Cool!


"On January 25, 2013, the Company issued a press release announcing that it will hold a conference call on
Tuesday, February 26, 2013 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time to discuss the fourth quarter and full year ended
December 31, 2012. Financial results will be issued in a press release prior to the call."

So you are saying unequivocally that UniPixel has sold a huge amount of shares? You will stand by that
claim? Remember you are under scrutiny and being held accountable for everything you claim to be true. Be
careful, as any intentional false claims on your part designed to manipulate the stock price, believe me, there
are those here who will do what is in there power to hold you accountable.

Mr Z let go. Cover, count your profits and please exit the stage to your left. I doubt if you see $12.50 again, so take
what you can get.

I'm defin waiting for 5 dollar a share before I'd make a move covering...definitely not covering here..This is

will play out...


28 Jan 2013, 10:55 AM

Mr Z, $10 WAS a good number a month ago. That opportunity for you has vanished.


And I thought you had your sht-bag together. I give you 10 to 1 odds you won't see 10 by the end of the week. I know
you are on an endorphin high about now, but I can help talk you down.

lol I know it's a 5 dollar stock in a few months when all the hypes are gone...where's the rush for me?? I'm

Regardless of whether it is a scam or not, I don't think this is the time it will unravel. You could be right, and if
you are, I will forever be in awe of your ability to predict a dump. And I will have to eat humble pie which i hate
with a vengeance. I just tend to believe MDB has some more cards to play out. We'll both see. Oh my, it is
back up to $13.73. Just when you thought you had stampeded the herd over the proverbial cliff.

lol the stock's got no buyer that's why you see volume on the downside and no volume on the upside..I just
don't see how they can maintain the scheme for much longer without actually committing securities fraud..The
mgmt isn't that type that's willing to go so far so its my guess they will play by the borderline and shut it off
right here...but we'll see

"More excited about the unfolding drama than any amount of money I'll make" ! Oh My!


Oh man, tell me you don't have big bucks riding on this? Then, you just do this for the jollies? Oh, I'm sorry,
but you really need to find a different hobby.


Try reading 50 Shades of Gray. My wife enjoyed it. For you, I think it would be a better way for you to get your
rocks off than getting your thrills by stampeding innocent investors. Not knowing you, so I might be totally off
base here, but have you looked in some better professional advice, perhaps the SEC can give you some as
has been hinted at here by others.


I was okay overall, until you told me you do this for excitement. That borders on being sick, don't you think?


28 Jan 2013, 11:51 AM


pahrah
Mr. Z, you made a claim about below $10 by the end of the week. I tried to wager you, giving you incredible
10 to 1 odds. I would have backed that bet up to whatever amount you felt comfortable betting (I'd probably
stop at $10,000).


Why didn't you take the wager? Even a $1 bet would have shown some level of conviction. If you put up
$1,000, and you won, you would have walked away with $10,000 by now. If you made a bet like that with me,
(even giving me the same odds as I gave you that UNXL would fall below $10) I would have taken you up in a
heartbeat.


So, it doesn't seem you have much conviction behind your claim against UniPixel. Please correct me if I'm
putting too much into all this.


So, what is your next claim, now that the fall below $10 scare tactic has come and gone. If you want to have
credibility here, we need to see some of what you predict, actually Happen.


Like I said before, UNXL seems to have found possible support for the time being. It even made a short lived
attempt at a breakout to the upside.


This is becoming a great stock for day traders.


Keep a close look out for the next company press release. The stock has been building a launching pad.
Good news, and the jet climbs away from the aircraft carrier. Bad news, and the stock drops into the drink.
Either way, I doubt if your gloom and doom the sky is falling will happen any time soon.

Oh, don't worry about me. I made my small fortune buying under $5 and selling above $19. In full disclosure I did pick
up a small position at $14.35 primarily to keep track of the stock. It could go to $5 and would have a negligible impact
on my portfolio.


I like to give you a nickname, but only if you agree. I know the hobbit is popular at your school right now, but I was
thinking more like honoring you with Z for Zorro. Zorro, the defender of that poor defenseless investor up against the

Yeh I find it funny too that Chris is missing from the discussion. Not sure what is going on...hmm...If you've
made your money in the stock, I congratulate you and you should keep your profits..It's really not a name
worth looking at anymore..If you are retail, you can't get shorts on this..Maybe buy a few puts for a
gamble..don't lose the money you've already made is the best advice I could give you.

Chris Hofmann, Contributor
I'm still here, just try not to reply to your pointless posts.


"It's really not a name worth looking at anymore..." What does this even mean? Literally, nothing has changed
so far in January, yet you have been very adamantly short, and now believe it isn't worth looking at? Your
inconsistencies amaze me Mr. Z.


I for one continue to do more REAL research, and have yet to find anything to dissuade me from my position.
Thus, I hold long and ignore the noise from day to day movements. Feb 26th will come soon enough and
many of our questions will be answered then.

SamsaricSufferer
Lets looks at Mr. Pearson's SA article track record. Everything that follows are publicly available facts and only facts. I
will post my conclusion and opinions at the end of this post and they will be clearly labeled as such.


Mr. Pearson posted 7 articles in 2012 and 1 so far in 2013. All the articles are prefaced with the disclosure statement,
" I am short XYZ".


I will list the title of the SA article, the ticker, the date of the article, the close on the trading day before the article was
posted, and the close today. The reason I am using the close of the day before the articles is that all the articles were
posted in the morning, shortly before trading or within the first hour of the trading day. The only exception was the
ZIOP article, posted at 1:42pm.

"Richard Pearson Responds On Ziopharm"


ZIOP 10/26/12 - 5.14 - 4.01


Now some other observations, a couple of the stocks he shorted, then wrote an article about were low float stocks,
HITK at 13.4M shares, or ultra low float like CLNT at 2.7M shares. With such thinly, it doesn't not take much buying or
selling to move the share price significantly.


Most of the stocks listed had significant negative share price movements the day of the article. The exception was
BIDU which actually closed higher. Only 3 of the 8 are significantly lower today than they were on the day before Mr.
Pearson published his article. They are ZIOP, CBAK, and HLF. Two of the companies are essentially flat, TSL and
CLNT. Three of the companies are significantly higher than the day before the articles appeared, BIDU, HITK, and
NEPT. I define significant as a move up or down of more than 10%. The stocks that are flat are within 3 and 7 cents,
respectively, of the pre article price.


NOW MY OPINION AND CONCLUSIONS:


Mr. Pearson engages in blatant attempts to manipulate the stock prices of the companies he writes about. Mr.
Pearson is often successful in influencing the price of these companies in the very short term. Mr. Pearson has on
several occasions has written articles targeting low float stocks, such as CLNT, HITK, and now UNXL. That is most
certainly because he knows that low float stocks are much easier to manipulate by his methods. Weak handed retail
investors will see the price on their newest "babies" price fall and trade emotionally out of fear without doing their own
due diligence. I know because I have been such a "weak hand" in the past and traded based on emotion. Those times
have ALWAYS been to my detriment. Over the longer term the market wises up and more rational pricing results. I
believe my data with respect to Mr. Pearson's longer term outcomes supports that view.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 49/73


I do want to highlight one case in particular. NEPT lost over 30% of it's value from 2.46 to 1.71 in the day of and
following the article. What was particularly offensive to me as a human being was that Mr. Pearson crassly included
information for interested persons to send money to the "victim's fund" within the same article he was using to drive
the stock price down for his personal gain. Those worker's injured economically by being out of work, were further
injured by his attempt to drive the company out of business for his maximum profit while he feigned concern for their
plight. There is nothing immoral about shorting a stock and putting your case before the public for doing so. It is no
different than any long posting their bull thesis in support of their investment decisions. However, Mr. Pearson's use of
the victims of the NEPT explosion as a fig leaf for his short article went beyond the pale of decent human conduct, in
my opinion.


Look at the articles and the facts posted and draw your own conclusions. In my mind, Mr. Pearson is a not someone I
would care to take investment advice from. I feel this way, not because he is a short, but for the cynical behaviors he
exhibits toward the employees of companies like NEPT and toward retail investors such as myself.


EDIT: I am long UNXL, again, on todays retrace. I will continue to average back in on my position. I am long BIDU
calls and have done very well despite Mr. Pearson's opinion.

Great post. Every shop, every investor, every SA author has winners and losers. It is important to research
the underlying company itself, and not just the information distributor (MDB or Pearson or Craig-Hallum, etc.)
in order to make an intelligent investment.


My research into Unipixel, the company, is very bullish. $1 Billion annual revenues are in our sights (2014)


29 Jan 2013, 10:04 AM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Dude I really can't stand how you make revenue out of thin air.....you have any idea what it takes to build a
1bil annual revenue business?? Name one company that turned from making 0 dollar to making 1 bil dollar
over the course of two years??? You need to stop giving people false hopes on this name..


29 Jan 2013, 10:26 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
I know exactly what it takes. Do you? It will take sales of 50 million units of UniBoss at $20 per unit. That is 1
billion in revenues.


Currently, Unipixel expects to be selling approximately 3 million units per month. by end of 2013 / early 2014.
Assuming they can increase this to 5 million units in 2014, thus averaging about 4 million units per month in

2014, gives you 4*12 = 48 million units of sales in 2014, or, approximately, $1 billion in revenues (Diamond
Guard / other products will start generating some revenues by then and make up the difference).


Lets phrase this another way. 50 million units. Currently analysts expect, depending on the analyst, between
200-400 million 'large-screen' touch devices to be sold in 2014. Lets take the midpoint at 300 million (which is
still conservative because it doesn't include any 'small-screen' devices such as smartphones). In order to sell
50 million units of UniBoss, Unipixel will have to capture approximately 15% of these 300 million units. This is
very possible in my opinion given the numerous advantages of UniBoss.


For what its worth, $1 Billion in revenues is approximately $400 million in earnings, or $28 EPS.


Mr. Z, please do me a favor and refute anything that I just stated. If you can refute a single point intelligently, I
will sell all my shares and short the stock. Otherwise, it will be proven that you are a clueless short attempting
to manipulate the stock price.


I eagerly await your response. You have until 3:30pm EST.

With regard to NEPT, I too had a rather large position which was doing okay until the plant literally exploded.
Which reminds me to file a claim as I was a rather large holder. Trading was halted for quite some time and
when it resumed, I took a bath. Neptune may end up found to be operating criminal. It is a rather interesting
story and can easily be found with Google. I wouldn't be too harsh on anyone investing in Neptune up to the
date of the explosion.


What is intriguing about Neptune is that the stock is now trading significantly above the price it resumed
trading at following the explosion. I had been advised to hold onto the stock for awhile. It is advice I wish I
listened too. It is the single worst loss I suffered last year. It taught me to research whether a company has
more than one plant it can operate with. The plant that produces Krill Oil was literally destroyed in the fire.
The loss of life and injury is devastating.


EDIT: I just glanced at this a litte more as I didn't notice Mr. Peason pumped NEPT AFTER the explosion. No
wonder the stock didn't keep going down. MMM. I'll have to give this one some thought, as I took some heavy
losses because I sold immediately when trading resumed as I couldn't see any way the stock would bounce
back up within months of the explosion.


29 Jan 2013, 11:41 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
You bring up some good points about NEPT that can actually relate to UNXL. It is important to have back-up
manufacturing lines in case anything happens.


Unipixel has already ordered two print lines in addition to the one they already own. Each printing line is
capable of 1 million units per month. Why do they need 3 already? 1. Huge growth is coming, and they know
it. 2. So they have back-up (I'm sure that as all 3 fill up, they will order more for backup).

Also, Unipixel has mentioned that its current facilities only allow for about 15 or so plating lines, which is
about 1.5 Million units per month. They are already looking to purchase new facilities in different areas so that
1. They can expand further, and 2. They are 'geographically diversified' in case one manufacturing warehouse
is hit by a natural disaster of some sort.


Unipixel's management is very smart, and they know what they're doing.


Still waiting for a reply from Mr. Z. You now only have 3 hours and 45 minutes. Will you concede your lack of
understanding of UNXL with your silence?


29 Jan 2013, 11:46 AM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
I think you should stop announcing guidance for the CEO on SA...I haven't seen a single press release by the
company stating they expect to sell 3 million units per month. If they issue such a press release, at least there
could be a class action lawsuit against the mgmt when they cannot sell a single unit around the time they
promised to deliver. Unfortunately for the retail investors who buy into your claims, they have no recourse
against you or the mgmt.


It's meaningless to make projections, do multiplications and calculate revenue/gross margin/EPS when the
very assumptions you base your claims on are completely invalid.


29 Jan 2013, 12:02 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
oh Mr. Z. you try so hard to spread doubt, but your efforts are pointless without proof or due diligence! Try
reading the most recent presentation that Unipixel released (Jan 4, 2013), or listening in on analyst calls.
They have pretty charts detailing their expected roll-out. These calls have been happening quite frequently,
not that you would know. I'd be happy to provide you with some audio recordings if you'd like. Of course... I've
offered you this before, and you didn't accept. Perhaps because you don't care to do real due diligence?


Every report I have mentioned in my comments or my SA articles, I have copies of in my email. I can't post
links to them, because they aren't uploaded any where. If you, or anybody, wants a copy, please just send me
a PM with your email address and I'll be happy to forward it along.


Sorry Mr Z, but you've failed to refute my points. Please try again.


29 Jan 2013, 12:07 PM


pahrah
Mr Z, aren't you suppose to be doing your homework for your business classes.


There are two guys near me who started putting their alpha into pellets and putting them onto container ships
and selling them to Japan. These two guys became millionaires within a year of their brainstorm. These two
guys didn't appear to have graduated from high school when I set up their facility. I'm guessing they are
billionaires by now at the rate they were raking it in.

Anything massed produced can be worth millions, if not billions. Those simple little reflectors they put in the
middle of highway lanes, made the "inventor" millions.


How successful were you with your short stint as an analyst? Don't blow smoke up my butt until you get
through business school.


Want to take that 10 to 1 bet yet?


29 Jan 2013, 12:10 PM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Well, if you are getting on the call and the general public isn't..the company has serious reg FD problems. If
they are disclosing material information such as their roll-out projection or guidance, it should be disclosed in
public via a press release or public accessible investor conference calls.


Btw, I have indeed listened to one of the calls in December. I didn't hear the management formally giving any
projection; rather the analyst more or less made up the production numbers in the call if I recall correctly.


Chris, if you are so close with the management, you should have advise them to put out a formal press
release detailing their guidance and projection..I'd be very happy if they would do that in the upcoming
earnings call...at least when they go on record, the class action lawyers will have something to rely upon in
the future.


29 Jan 2013, 12:17 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Again, more fear and doubt. I don't even know what you're talking about half the time. Public companies give
presentations to investors all the time. They put together materials. None of this is illegal. All calls are open to
the public, not my fault if you're not listening. And on the call in December, which you claim to have been on,
management, not the analyst, outlined their manufacturing ramp-up plan with 4 data points, ending with 1.3M
units per month at the end in 2013.


In a call in January, with a different analyst, management then updated these numbers, to increase to around
3 million units per month by the end of 2013 / early 2014.


Again, if you want any of this information, I have it. It is public information. Not everything is released in formal

Fidelity has 2 sells, 2 underperforms and 2 neutrals, does not look promising except for people who want out. We are
all wrong some of the time so take it with a gain of salt. I have no position and will not be taking one in this stock


29 Jan 2013, 01:43 AM


pahrah
katgod, I doubt if you want my take, but if you do, then keep an eye on the 50 day moving average. It is
starting to appear the 50 day moving average may be a good support level.

Everybody load up on DRYS and leave UNXL as a longer term hold -- relax, nothing's going on with it for the
moment. My shipping stocks have been beyond awesome! ;)

skylard99, good idea to give out other stock ideas. We are all here to make money, so why not share an idea
or two. Maybe it will catch on while we wait for microPixel to catch on; oh my bad, it's Uni not micro,


Notice it is hovering above the 50 day support. The longer it does, the more likely it will take another run up
toward resistance. I do believe it might be finally defining a little range to daytrade within (hope, hope).


Here are two I like a lot. Both my sons have sleep apnea and now I find that I have it too. Look at RMD
(Resmed) and PHG (who sells Respironics, as well as, LEDs, etc).


Sleep apnea is becoming really big, and I mean Big with a capital B. I've almost doubled riding PHG, and so I
just jumped aboard RMD as it's chart looks super.


That is my two stock picks/tips for the day.


30 Jan 2013, 10:46 AM


pahrah
I believe UNXL is approaching a reasonable price, especially near $12. I will likely add to my position when and if it
dips to $12. I will definitely re-enter in a big way if it drops to $10. Anything below $10 and I will aggressively start
accumulating. Mr. Z be forewarned as I will thoroughly enjoy changing money from your pocket to mine.


Of course I will be closely watching for any actual company events that might change my stance.

That was a short squeeze? If so, wasn't it extremely short lived? Got any numbers supporting that we can all
chew on?


I do agree that investors are likely watching to see if support holds. This has got to begin to worry any serious
shorts out there. If I had shorted, I would have covered before now. But then again, I have never short a stock
directly, However, I have bought plenty of inverse ETFs.

I do not own, and have never owned, UNXL. I have, however, owned CLIR and still have a little. That's what drew me
to this article and to reading the lengthy comments that have followed. What I find most striking is that Mr. Pearson
has not commented at all in support of his allegations or to address any of the very serious counter-allegations that
the commentators above have made against him. I have no dog in this fight -- at least not directly, in that I'm simply an
owner of CLIR (another MDB company) -- but I do think everyone would be well served by asking himself or herself
what is the likely meaning of Mr. Pearson's failure to make even one comment in follow up to all that has been said
above in response to his article. It would be nice to hear from Mr. Pearson in this regard.

I have responded to anyone that sent me any reasonable comment via SA direct mail. I have had very sensible
dialogue with both longs and shorts on this name. There are now about 150 comments on this article, so I am not
going to sit and track all of the daily comments, including those which suggest that I don't exist.


Also, just so you know, I did try to call MDB's research analyst for 3 consecutive days, multiple times per day, in
advance of my article. The number did not ring nor was it transferred to a secretary. It simply went to
voicemail...obviously given the nature of my past articles I was not going to leave a voicemail alerting MDB to my
short article.


The fact that MDB an "investment bank" immediately posted on SA was very surprising. I have never seen any real
investment bank do this due to the obvious compliance problems it raises, especially when MDB actually owns the
stock as well as arranges financing for it.


I am still confused about MDB's response. Were the links broken ? or was the site being re-designed ? Actually, we
know that the links were not ever broken because we could see that the links were "re-directed" to a descriptive page
about MDB. This had to be done manually. If the links had been "broken" we would have seen an error, and if MDB
had fixed the "broken" links to re-direct them to a generic page, then they could have just as easily restored the links
to the pdf files at that time.


My article came out at 10:30 am...MDB responded before 11:30 am...and readers were already seeing the restored
links to research within 37 minutes (12:07 pm day of article)...so clearly fixing this "technical difficulty" was not too
difficult. So why did it take nearly 2 weeks to get us the research back ? And when it was restored how is it possible
that it was done so quickly ?


Easy, because MDB took the research down and then put it back up after my article called them out on it.


If you would like to discuss further, please send me an SA direct mail.


thx

Mr. Pearson, Your record speaks for itself as I have already documented above. There is nothing for you to
dispute. I posted the stock price the day before your short articles were printed and the stock prices as of that
post last week. In the majority the stocks mentioned were either up or flat. Only 3 of the 8 stocks you posted
articles on last year (from October 2012 on I might add) are down after your revelations. Your track record
speaks for itself. These are simple, incontrovertible facts. You were dead wrong, 5 out of 8 times. I wouldn't
beat any money following your advice.

Nice detective work Mr Homes. May very well be the best piece of evidence about this contributor to date. It's
all in the man's record. Now, why didn't I think of that? Bravo.


Had there been an issue, I had stored copies of MDB's PDFs in iBooks on my iPad. I find my iBooks is an
excellent place to store important stock info and investment documents (just in case documents go into the
shredder).


Which reminds me, I wonder if I can deduct my two iPads off my income tax?

It might be possible to get some deductions if you're running a business. ie. trading frequently and must count
your activities as self-employment income. I'm speaking as a Canadian. I've no idea what US rules are, if you

skylark99, I make several thousand trades a year. The money I have set aside for trading purposes is
presently running under a mil. I'm retired. I don't own a business. I rely on a number of pensions and other
annuities to live on. But as you might guess, I'm dependent on my computer, my cellphone and my two iPads
to make trades. I'm a U.S. citizen. When I purchased my Mac Pro a number years ago I counted 20% of it as
a business expense. As I do my own taxes, I wasn't absolutely sure I could take it as a deduction, but just the
same, thought it made sense. It had a very small impact on my return for a couple of years. It doesn't really
make a difference any more as I no longer have enough deductions to itemize.

Mr. Z, I tried to tell you. UNXL continues to behave properly. Expect some up and downs within a defined band.
Another breakout to the upside is possible. Longs should feel vindicated. I just love a disruptive stock that behaves

The stock has developed a possible bearish S&H pattern. This stock has been very volatile lately because of the low
float and easy manipulation. Will buy back later. Will not let profit gone.


08 Feb 2013, 02:22 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
James: interesting observation but I would say it's not a true H&S as the volume is not decreasing from one
peak to the next and the next. But nevertheless, I can appreciate your caution.


I am using SMA, EMA & Volume and noting the stock continues to be above the 50 day moving EMA; and is
once again going above a 10 day EMA.


I think the uptrend will continue as it gets closer to the earnings report date of March 4th.


08 Feb 2013, 03:02 PM


pahrah
Could be a bearish upward wedge forming, but as I said before (and skylark99 seems to agree), the 50 day moving
average seems to a good indicator for the time being.

Chris, Williams Capital's coverage is good news, at least in the near term. There research group must know
something I don't. There coverage alone will drive up the price. Still, one caveat is UniPixel needs to achieve
a production milestone in order to justify the current price level. The greater the height, the greater the
potential drop should the first shoe drop. I still may be tempted to short the stock above their price target. I did
sell my long position today. Likely a mistake given William's coverage.

Not to throw sand in anyone's vaseline, but there hasn't been any real news that I'm aware of to justify these price
levels. Longs might do well to lock in some profits. The Williams' piece provided a price target which is likely the
reason for the recent rally. I would think there is going to be some back and forth here, so day trading seems a good
way to milk some money out of this -- until solid news comes out. Comments welcome.


And darn it, I've been busy, so I missed out altogether on this lovely rally.


I get the impression that Mr Z probably only has his lunch money invested as a short. The worst thing that will happen
to the likes of him is he might miss out being able buy chips with his sub sandwich.


I wouldn't be at all surprised if these hit pieces done by the likes of Mr Z and company could have been to generate a
little revenue for doing a SA hit piece. Students need to do extra credit work to impress their Professors. I've tried to
get him to open up offline, but he keeps very closed lip, so I can only guess.

I disagree. While there hasn't been any news recently, there was news back in December. I believe that
investors are slowly realizing that the 'OEM' (Dell) deal alone will put this stock in the $50-$100 range. It has
been stated in both Craig-Hallum and William Financial Group's reports that they expect the 'OEM' deal to
account for around 1 million units per month at year end... that is around $6 in EPS.


New news will of course drive us higher, but the probability of failure is currently priced at around 90%, which
is huge, as it should, realistically, be closer to 10%.


15 Feb 2013, 02:48 PM


pahrah
Chris, Williams Capital has their own research group. I'll rely on their price target, which is just about
exhausted with this push. If they are right, I can find better places to invest for the time being. Like I say, I'm
waiting for a press release from the company. You might want to see why your target and Williams is a
country mile apart. Your comments are always welcome as your optimism is inspirational. Thanks and I hope
you are spot on.


15 Feb 2013, 05:58 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Pahrah, have you read Williams Financial Group's research report? I have and can send you a copy of it if
you wish. In the 18 page report, the analyst describes that his $30 price target is extremely conservative and
actually expects earnings to be in the high-teens in 2014. I would argue that my target is actually quite in-line
with WFG's target... they simply can't give a $15 stock a $100 stock price... but they can give it a $30 stock
price, and then steadily increase it throughout the year.


15 Feb 2013, 11:10 PM


pahrah
Chris, that would be great. I searched for their research report online but couldn't find anything for FREE. How do we
go about sharing files here? I really don't favor sharing my contact info online. I've seen other recent targets following
William's coverage as low as $22, but I agree Williams target is $30. $30 would enough for me to buy in on the next
15% or so dip (if there is one, that is).


I am cautious, as most investors should be. I'll borrow something recently expressed by the Street:


"We expect a number of deals similar to the PC agreement, but possibly larger, to be announced through 2013... The
biggest question now facing UniPixel, in our opinion, is whether or not it can deliver its products reliably and in high
volume..."


This is a reasonable concern and warning. Any of us at this juncture are free to speculate, but for me the real catalyst
depends heavily upon UniPixel's future Press Releases. Full production is not a proven. Speculation may drive the
stock into the stratosphere, but any unforeseen hiccup could just as easily drop the price back to earth. In my mind,
Mr. Z's vision of $5 a share is no more of a stretch than $100. Can you guarantee that the technology can be mass
produced yet? And what concerns me the most about placing a large bet is that if there is a dump, it will happen in the
after hours market. I will be left holding a bag of $5's. I'm recently holding a large bag of 1's after ETRM recently failed

to deliver. The fastest way to become a pauper is to keep changing $5's into $1's and $20's into $5's. At this point in
UniPixel evolution, UNXL is a high risk trade. I don't put my whole paycheck riding on single number on the roulette
table. I might put my lunch money, but not too much more at this stage. I rather spread it into 20 speculative trades,
than all on one number. Sometimes you hit your lucky number, but the odds are against you in the long run.


But yes, I would love to get William's research report. Maybe it will inspire me to put breakfast, lunch and dinner
down.

I have not posted for weeks BUT believe I correctly predicted $22 price level at that time and for ALL shorts to cover
immediately and come back another day. And, that the real money to be made in this rare stock opp. was to buy and
hold long term. The small float of unxl is a major force and easily forgotten and overlooked as it is unusual per se in
the stock investment world. 
I will reiterate that a major piece of news is forthcoming in just days as opposed to weeks. There are several excellant
posters on this Board but, no slight to anyone, I think Chris is as intelligent as any that come down the pike. Start
believing in what he espouses and you will not go wrong as he is right on the money and actually conservative
overall. I increased my position with both stock and Calls. I chose the July time period for safety. I was an investor in
VHC at the $2-3 level and sold throughout the rise and all out around $42. I absolutely see UNXL as performing
Better thjan VHC especially when considering % rate of returns. Both great companies! UNXL is excellant buy at $20
if you do not own it. I do not intend to sell this year unless it skyrockets like a scalded dog. I do Not like to trade at all.
Real big money is made long term hold.

I personally expect around $3-5 in EPS for 2013 and well into the double digits for 2014. Could be much

I indicated before, I would buy on the dips. I'm back in today at $18.55. I'll keep adding if the price continues to drop.
Assuming the 50 day moving average is support, I'll next add somewhere in the low $16's.

5/22/2018 Why Is Uni-Pixel Falling? - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1133671-why-is-uni-pixel-falling 63/73


and sell for now.


If anyone has any updates, that will be welcome! For the moment, it's one of The Most Curious Items on my
Watchlist. I would rather buy in once good news is released and then keep it for longer then rather than
having to monitor this one with a microscope almost every 2 days or 3 hours... depending on how "odd" I
deem the activities on the stock.

"Uni-Pixel, Inc. is expected to report earnings on 02/26/2013. The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending
Dec 2012. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 3 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS
forecast for the quarter is $-0.25. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $-0.26."


I'll play it safe and will likely lock in my small profit for my latest swing trade sometime today. I don't envision
much of a bump up from an earnings beat (unless the earnings are great). On the other hand, I believe an
earnings miss could result in another dip that is swing trade buyable. I plan to swing trade this puppy until
some "earth shaking" news surfaces.


My stock tip of the day, VIPS. VIPS has been very kind to me. If you decide to invest, wait for the next dip to
give you some safety margin. VIPS could very well be China's equivalent of our Walmart. A Walmart, that is,
without any real competition. Can you even imagine?

Chris Hofmann, Contributor
No serious investor will be paying attention to whether UNXL beats or misses the EPS forecast of -0.25.
UNXL was and still is pre-revenue, and therefore revenue (and earnings) is a useless number to follow. The
earnings report tomorrow is important because of the conference call, where UNXL is expected to give some
sort of forward looking guidance towards production capacity / future revenues / future earnings. Also, this will
provide a tremendous opportunity for potential investors to ask questions directly to the management team.


25 Feb 2013, 11:51 AM

Great points Chris, not holding UNXL but you do know your information and investments very well.

I just hope the company doesn't get bought out. With zero debt and the tech they own, it's a real possibility. Most
shareholders would consider a $30 buyout extremely disappointing even if it does represent a 50% appreciation on
current stock levels.

Buy on dip. But taking some nice profit (about 60% in less than 1 month) is not a bad idea. For me, I sold all my
shares days ago at 21.00.


Waiting for pull back.


25 Feb 2013, 12:35 PM


pahrah
My stock tip for the day was to buy VIPS (and consider taking some profit on UNXL). Out of curiosity, did anyone
perhaps buy VIPS on my advice? I didn't think so.


25 Feb 2013, 03:28 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Pahrah: kudos for the VIPS tip -- I did look at it earlier but it was not doing as well as ZNGA or EGLE when I
was looking... and also, since it's a company located in China, I would never participate. No amount of
research will get me to buy a Chinese or Indian firm directly.


I am Chinese but do not trust Chinese businesses. I will buy Japanese banks and Japanese electronics but
not Chinese stocks or resource stocks that do most of their business in Africa or Cambodia or China. I don't
trust the accounting and believe it's more of a house of cards than anything.


Having worked in the financial industry, I know of Enron, Worldcom, Bre-X, and Sino-Forest. And as the
communist government party leaders continue to play a major role in Chinese companies, I think the danger
of the corruption causing a free fall keeps me away.


I've not problem with foreign businesses that invest in China or do business in China but also have a global
presence.


Not sure about others on here but this one wasn't right for me ^^"


Thank you for the kind thought though!


25 Feb 2013, 10:08 PM


pahrah
skylark99, I agee wholeheartedly about the corruption factor.


That being said, I tend to believe VIPS is the real thing. Even so, I sold half my shares at the close of trading. Usually,
VIPS will pull back 5 to 10% after a day like today. I'll buy back on any pull back. I also have shares in QIHU and
MPEL.


I have a Chinese daughter-in-law that came here from Beijing. She goes home every couple of years to see her mom
and sister. I'll ask her what she thinks of VIPS.

Transcend Asset, Contributor
pahrah, 5 to 10% moves up ** and down ** on just the one item sounds crazy. I can find enough items with
the 5 to 20% ups with better reportings.... and pass this up. Of course, I'm the one who passed on Alibaba too
haha. I want things I can hold even if another recession hits. I won't flinch.


If I can't understand it, I don't invest in it. So you can say my reaction time to certain stocks is slow. I
sometimes miss the boat ;) but that's ok... in my books =)


BTW, another danger with investing in China? I heard there are now laws forbidding the sharing of accounting
information with the SEC. How the heck are these companies to be held accountable? Shorts can kill them.
Someone could tell me there's accounting fraud in every country, etc etc... anyways, personal preference... no
VIPS =)


And you should consider a China ETF for peace of mind and long-term investing! But maybe you only put
lunch monies to things like VIPS...


27 Feb 2013, 04:07 AM


pahrah
Oh skylark99,


So sorry. VIPS is perfect stock in so many ways. In just a short time I have made almost 500% return.


What is to understand? VIPS is basically the Chinese version of our Walmart (maybe even Amazon). Have
you even gone to their website? Since you are Chinese, you must understand how the Chinese crave to buy
Western products. Vipshop has everything many Chinese want to buy. U.S. should love the fact that they sell
our products, as well, as from around the world.


The stock is RED HOT! Emphasize RED for China, ha ha. Any stock that can go up 30 or 40% quickly, also
expect profit taking.


You can invest in VIPS two ways and make lots of profit. I keep a modest core position. It's returned about
300%. I also swing trade, above my core position. When VIPS dips for profit taking (this last dip was about
15%), I buy and then wait a few days or possibly weeks. The stock surges ahead up 20 or 30% and I sell at
end of big up day. I do over and over.


I can't think of a better money maker. Will it all come to an end because Chinese business is often corrupt.
Okay, so what, I lose some of my core position. Boo hop. In the meantime, I pocket most of the 500% profit.
Also, I support American made products. What can be bad?


Meanwhile, UNXL very jerky. Yes, I made 400% very quickly, the first big run up. I pocket it. I swing trade it. I
make money. I don't consider UNXL the perfect money maker, but it has been nice to me so far, but very
stressful now, compared to easy VIPS. VIPS already has product and great earnings. Chinese VIPS
businessman get filthy rich, just like some American businessmen. Why on heaven's earth would Chinese
VIPS want to give up on great money maker? You tell me, because I don't know of any reason.


UNXL may go to $100 -- pure speculation based on what ifs Possible, but house of cards. After hours is my
big worry for going long.

VIPS may go to $100 -- very conceivable based on sound business model.


VIPS = core position + swing trades


UNXL = very small core position + swing trades


With proper strategy, VIPS is good play.


UNXL high risk until the UniBoss is rolling off the presses in bulk.


I can invest in VIPS. I can speculate UNXL. There is a difference.


It is all about peace of mind. Nothing I can say will convince you if you are afraid of Chinese corruption.
Remember, a lot of riches made during Prohibition.

I have been watching UNXL's rise in price, and have been wondering, as with other stocks, just what people are
looking at. It is one thing to speculate on a stock, but should there not be some sanity to it? After all, there is no
confirmation to any deals, licensing, etc.. There is no confirmation as to whether or not this production process will
actually produce the results they say. There is no confirmation that a certain market share/price is realistic. This is a
company that is losing money, and is valued like it is making millions. I have other companies that are selling product,
unlike UNXL, and are under $2.00 per share, and have as much promise and more for upside potential. I put UNXL
on the same list as other grossly overvalued stocks such as NFLX, AMZN, LNKD, etc.. This is just my opinion, and in
no way suggests a position one way or another in UNXL.


26 Feb 2013, 09:55 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
you clearly haven't done their research. As per the CC earlier today:


Manufacturing is fully up and running and ready to be sent to OEMs 
They will have 1.3 Million units per month of capacity by eoy 2013, potentially more. 
They expect a second preferred pricing agreement in the next few weeks, and a JV partnership in Q2

Growth and more growth.


27 Feb 2013, 12:16 AM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
rtcatfow: Ah! the price has certainly risen. Due to the small number of shares available, I wonder how much of
the price movement is due to the same number of people trading on UNXL. I also have a niggling bit of doubt
due to comments from shorts which unfortunately cannot be proven or disproven by way of rationale due to
lack of significant proof from the company.

Then again, price is not everything. The market cap of this company is still small. Mkt cap is the real way to
judge the size of a company.... though I can think of many stocks that will give me a bigger profit in the
meantime, while this thing remains iffy.


I currently do not hold the stock.

27 Feb 2013, 12:26 AM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Ah, interesting! I've thought of similar things. As for UNXL, for now I am done with it. My requirement is that
the company reveal the name(s) of OEMs or start showing a profit. Even were the shares at $40 at that point,
I am not back in until then.


I found the transcript for this conference call weak in 2 areas: 
- lack of mention of new clients 
- lack of following (questions) by analysts at big names such as BAC, MS, Jefferies, etc


I still think it's a fog.


In this instance, the article Mr. Zhou shared does fall in line with my thinking. Unless other analysts show
interest and publish on UNXL, this thing is going to have limited upside for the near future. Usually, a stock in
the $15+ range attracts a huge analyst following already. This one has been giving me a strange feeling as
my experience in stocks make me think it is behaving unusually.


I will look for something else while keeping UNXL on my watchlist.


27 Feb 2013, 03:38 AM


Small Cap Machine, Contributor
and now you've all been woken up to the inherent dangers of seeking alpha. Uninformed and inexperienced investors
posting garbage that even less informed investors actually listen to. Hopefully no one listened.


27 Feb 2013, 09:15 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
It is up for the reader to decide whether the "garbage" is in fact worthy of being followed. While this article has
clearly been wrong so far, there have been numerous other articles by myself and Green River Asset which
have been spot-on so far. Hopefully these investors will realize which research is more reliable... although
they should always do their own DD as well.

Mr Z, can you feel the squeeZZZZZe yet?


I'm walking my stop loss up as UNXL goes up, up and away. God, I love a disruptive technology stock when it
behaves like one. I went long again at $18.55 and loving evey click of the up dollar. I willing to take a 30% gain and
call it good any day of the week.


I have to give Chris thanks for sending me the Williams Research article..


Mr Z iZ feeling the squeezzzzzze today!


When I sell UNXL today, then I buy in more VIPS. Swing trade. Back and forth, like a Zee Zaw.


27 Feb 2013, 10:39 AM


rtcatfow
Chris, I have done DD on UNXL, and all I am saying is that no information as to licencing deals, (who with?), contract
deals, (how much?), and production numbers, (are they achievable and does the mass production process actually
produce the desired results?) All I have seen so far are statements from the company, and cannot find any verification
of these statements. I'm not long or short, and like Skylark99, I will keep watching until nagging concerns become
clear. If you have any sources that verify managements statements, please post them for our reference.


27 Feb 2013, 11:33 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
The only possible verification of management statements at this point would be the $5M engineering payment
that UNXL will be / has received in Q1. Since UNXL is pre-revenue, all other information will of course come
from management.


With that being said, I have spoken to analysts / large investors who have done a tremendous amount of DD,
including conversations with various Touch Controller companies and OEMs and they all have very positive
things to say about Unipixel and they all point towards Dell being the OEM. I would expect this to be
confirmed by management in April when they ship their first product to the OEM.


Your other questions can be answered by management and have been discussed ad nauseum, however, as
you pointed out, they cannot be confirmed by a 3rd party. By the time they are, I expect the stock to be well
over $50 per share. Investing at that point is still smart, as I expect it to climb over $100, but I am willing to
take the little bit of extra risk to receive a much better buy-in price.

Chris, since you have a symbiotic relationship with the pixie folks, would you be able to arrange a tour of their
production facility? I think I would like to fly down with a couple of my investor friends and tour their facility.
One of my friends is a Kellogg heir and I've been trying to convince him of this great investment, but he is one
of those investors who won't invest in anything he doesn't understand. He is another one of those seeing is
believing folks.


In fact, I'd even consider taking a camera crew down so we can put together a little dog and pony show for
Vimeo. My brother-in-law is a producer living in Manhattan. He's produced for A&E and the History Channel,
as well as Bloomberg and others. He has been looking for something extra to to do, so this might work out
nicely. He'd expect to be paid.


At this stage it is just an idea I'm kicking around. It would be a great way to help remove the shroud of
mystery.


04 Mar 2013, 05:11 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
I have absolutely no connection with Unipixel, so you're asking the wrong guy. sorry.


04 Mar 2013, 05:13 PM

Okay? Have you personally toured their facility? Perhaps you have some photos to share?


04 Mar 2013, 05:16 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Pahrah, I have looked up a bunch of Unipixel people on LinkedIn. You could do the same... maybe chat with
some of them. Reed Killion is definitely on there. Along with some 22 others. Maybe you can arrange
something that way. Hope that helps!


04 Mar 2013, 05:20 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Use "Companies" search and not "People" search. Of course, tours and interviews can usually be arranged
by calling a firm's investors relations/ PR too.


04 Mar 2013, 05:26 PM


pahrah
Great idea. I'm just thinking, all the Pixie folks need are some really good PR. For a company that headed into
the stratosphere, what they need right now is some really good PR, think video. Perhaps, video taking you
through the stages of production. Some shots of their new printing presses. Some one on one interviews with
their technical staff. That sort of thing. I don't know how much my brother-in-law would need. I'm thinking he
could do a nice piece for around $250,000. I could be off by country mile.

Mr Z, as before, I won't hold my breath. Your batting average so far is zero. You need to get a hit before you
can make first base. It's getting close to the ninth inning.


I get it, you must think those new printing presses are for printing money to pay off MDB.


We should take a trip to see their new presses. I'm from the see um state.


In the meantime I just banked more uni-pixie gold dust. Day trade is the safest play. Swing trade increases
profits, but the real risk is in the after hours.


Are you adding to your short position? I might join you soon because at these high levels I need to see one of
those UniPixel genies pop out of the bottle. I need proof that UniBoss will soon be rolling off the presses. Talk
is cheap. Seeing is believing.


I'm no longer long. I'm not short. I'm in the ether. Day trade until confirmation.

UNXL is going to sink - blah, blah, blah. How much did you lose covering your short positions? You guys who keep
writing these articles of doom on UNXL really need to find another stock to try and spook investors. Is UNXL going to
fall? Who knows - all I know is that I have done quite well as a swing trader in UNXL. Is it good for the long term? No
one knows but I sure as heck don't pay attention to anyone writing a doomsday report who holds the stock short as he
is trying to scare investors to sell the stock so he can make a bundle from his short position.


27 Feb 2013, 05:54 PM

Folks, today Unipixel went up 23% and it was upgraded to $34 from $24. No brokerage firm is perfect. If they do they
will be called "GOD". If you guys can pick a perfect stock every time I will you guys "GOD" as well. Knowing that we
are all average investors and not millionaire by any status otherwise we wouldn't be wasting time on this board. No
millionaire that I know is spending time here to discuss baloney issues and write stupid argument back and forth.
Bottom line is just invest what you think can make you money. Sometime you lose sometime you gain, so don't blame
on anybody whether it's MBD or whoever...

James,


It has been a good one, no arguing that. I'm especially liking the volatility right now.


Over the last 3 months, VIPS holds a slight edge in percentage increase. For me, VIPS is a lower risk. I cashed in
some of my UNXL profits (having bought below $5) and put to work in VIPS.


Plus, so far, I haven't seen the short sellers circle over VIPS yet. I have several others that I own that are red hot right
now.


When you say "strong", what metrics are you using?


04 Mar 2013, 10:46 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Since you guys seem comfortable with small cap stocks, here's some on my watchlist that went up a lot
today: HGSH(22.67%), SSY(19.98%). BYD(14.40%). Thanks for adding MBI, CIMT, VIPS, and VHC to my
radar =)


As for large caps (which are a personal favorite), SNE has been awesome if you got in around 10. Japanese
banks such as MFG and SMFG are also cheaper to buy than US or Cdn banks. Leaves more cash for other
things while securing the safe part of your portfolio with a good yield play.


Even though I'm out of UNXL, I love this group because I've learned a lot from everyone =) THANKS!


04 Mar 2013, 10:57 PM


Transcend Asset, Contributor
Oh, right! Here's one I don't mind day trading: SPWR. Only do it when I see it going up to about 2%.
Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be much interest that day.


04 Mar 2013, 11:24 PM


pahrah
skylark99, here is my hot tip for the day. Buy tson now before the price soars. Although I already have a large
position, I'm adding to it. TranS1 just acquired Braxano. Don't worry about the volatility. At some point it will
catch on and away it will go.


There are so many plays that have great potential without all the hoopla.


I would have told you to buy CREE, but it took off today. I bought a 1,000 shares yesterday and I'm glad I did.
Sometimes you just get lucky.
