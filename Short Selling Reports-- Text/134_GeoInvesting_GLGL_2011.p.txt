GLG Life Tech: On The Ground Due Diligence Confirms Weak
Business Outlook
Oct. 11, 2011 2:25 AM ET5 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Introduction


On October 3rd we mentioned that that we shorted GLG Life Tech Corp. (GLGL), a
Chinese supplier of stevia extract zero-calorie sweetener, based on weak on-the-ground
due diligence field notes that our team had just received and noted that on our blog. We
were in the middle of preparing the following details when just 3 days later, and to our
surprise, GLG Tech came out with commentary discussing operational obstacles that have
negatively affected the company’s business.


On the morning of October 6, 2011, GLGL issued a press release highlighting operational
difficulties it claimed to have recently come face to face with. However, based on our
preliminary findings we believe that situation could be even worse than what was
portrayed in this press release. You will learn from the following bullets that we estimate
that the facilities have only been in operation for about 3 months in all of 2011 thus far.
Even after the October 6, 2011 sharp decline in stock price, we see little reason that the
stock will stage a significant rebound.


Based on our due diligence we believe that there is a high probability that GLGL’s 2011
SEC financials may have been misrepresented and that GLGL has had significant
undisclosed operational issues for most of 2011.


Investigator Observation and Information Gathering


GLGL has five facilities. Our investigator was able to visit each of these facilities to glean
information related to production volumes and processing activities. We have reached the
consensus that GLGL may be suffering from a shrinking business not able to sustain
multiple facets of its operations. It has become evident through our observations of
reduced employee counts and overall worker sentiment of substandard product and poor
incentive to be a part of workforce that GLGL will have a going concern in the near future.


1. Bengbu: R&D and operation center
GLGL has a small R&D center at Bengbu, which includes a small three floor office
building and a several mu (one mu is equal to 666 m2) stevia plantation garden.
However, the stevia plantation garden occupies only one dozen square meters. All

other areas in the garden contain several other plants. Local farmers told our
investigator that the whole garden did plant stevia last year (2010) and they did not
know why Bengbu’s current volume of stevia significantly lacked in comparable size to
last year.


At the same time, Bengbu is also a purchasing agent of stevia for GLGL. As it is not a
harvest season for stevia, there are no operational activities at Bengbu.


2. Chuzhou Runhao: processing stevia leaves
Chuzhou Runhao has impressive facilities. However, based on its employees,
Chuzhou Runhao stopped production at the beginning of August 2011 and only
produced from June to August (three months) in 2011. Local farmers and one former
worker of GLGL said that this facility stopped production because of reduced sales. An
abundance of purchased stevia leaves are still stocked in the facility without any
production. These leaves became black and putrid (pictures coming soon). The
harvest season of stevia starts from mid-May to August.


Local farmers also complained that GLGL did not purchase all harvested stevia from
local farmers in 2011 and some farmers do not plan to plant stevia for GLGL next year
even though bad weather in 2011 accounted for a shorter harvest period.


3. Dongtai Runyang: processing stevia leaves
Dongtai Runyang has impressive facilities and includes two production lines. Based on
the information of its employees, only one production line produced from June to
August in 2011. During ten months in 2010, one line operated at full capacity while the
other line operated at part capacity. This company at one point had 200 workers and
now only has around 150 workers, all of which still need to report to the company for
paid basic salary (around RMB 1,500 per month).


4. Qingdao Runde: processing of stevia leaves into different grades of stevia
extract products
This company has the smallest facilities compared to other subsidiaries of GLGL. Our
investigator talked to one employee. This employee told our investigator that GLGL
told them not to disclose any information to anyone or risk being fired. This worker was
not concerned with being fired, explaining that GLGL was not a good place to work
anyways. The employee said that this company used to have around 50-60
employees. By 2011, the business turned sour. Currently, it has less than 10 workers
and there are not even enough products for a full day’s expected output in any given
week.

5. Qingdao Runhao: processing of stevia leaves into different grades of stevia
extract products
Qingdao Runhao has impressive facilities. Employees stated that in 2011 there was
only periodic business activity. Furthermore, since Aug. 2011, this location’s production
activities were halted for shortage of sales. In 2010, busy operations sustained around
120 workers. Now, this company only has 20 workers without substantial production
activities.


AN0C project (Xiaogang) in Fengyang County and other relevant information
gathered


In 2010, in Fengyang County, local farmers sold harvested stevia to GLGL for an
acceptable price (RMB 5-8 per pound depending on different qualities). However, in 2011,
even though the harvested amount of stevia decreased due to bad weather conditions, it
is hard for local farmers to sell the stevia.


In the site of the AN0C project, there are nine different facilities and several others under
construction. GLGL plans to establish five different product lines.


The first is for low calorie sugar and is ready for production at the end of October.
The second is for civil usage sugar and there is designed facility but no equipment
and/or workers.
The third one is for cereal and there is designed facility but no equipment and/or
workers.
The fourth one is for Ginkgo biloba liquid with only temporary production.
The last one is for beverage. The worker told our investigator that the production line
can produce 15,000 bottles hourly with 24 hour round-the-clock production. However,
this information is contradictory to observations made by the employees who stated
that the small number of delivery trucks per day is insufficient for the production line’s
capacity. Furthermore, our investigator also contacted several sales agents for the
beverage products sold by GLGL. The sales agent told our investigator that the sale
volume of the beverage product was too low for several reasons:


1. Poor beverage palatability
2. High price compared to other famous brand beverages
3. Low advertisement and endorsement for the beverage
4. Newly introduced products without apparent advantages (The Chinese do not care


about calorie content as much as Americans do.)


Relationship with Cargill

Comments (5)


GLGL reported a strategic alliance with Cargill in its 2010 annual report. The key points of
the relationship are as follows:


"an agreement by Cargill to purchase a minimum of 80% of its global stevia extract
requirements from us for the first five years of the agreement commencing October 1,
2008;"
"our being Cargill's exclusive Chinese supplier of stevia extract for the term of the
Strategic Alliance and Supply Agreement and Cargill's agent in China for any
additional stevia extract sourcing opportunities that arise;"


We do not know Cargill’s stevia sales volume thus far in 2011. Based on the relationship
between GLGL and Cargill, it is reasonable to believe that the sales of stevia extract made
by Cargill substantially dropped in 2011, as compared to 2010.


Here is a link with the contact name of Cargill’s representative regarding the cooperation
with GLGL.


Conclusion


It is reasonable to believe that GLGL may have experienced a significant drop in revenues
in 2011 due to ceased production activities (stevia extraction) after August 2011 in all its
relevant facilities. Regarding the new beverage business, the current market response for
the beverage is not good. Again, even after the October 6, 2011 sharp decline in stock
price, we see little reason that the stock will stage a significant rebound.


Disclosure: I am short GLGL.

cyclocross
let's see, on 9/18 andrew sizemore says significant near-term upside. then the author, who is unnamed and hides
behind the "geo team" says after a nice bounce that on 10/3 he shorted the stock. then he writes this article saying
he's short and that the company's outlook looks weak. I guess that's one way to pay the bills! at least name the
author. "disclosure: i am short" does no good when the author is "the geo team."


nice job guys.

"says after a nice bounce"


Where does it say this?


Are you saying this?...I don't see a nice bounce. There has been a general down trend in the stock all year.
