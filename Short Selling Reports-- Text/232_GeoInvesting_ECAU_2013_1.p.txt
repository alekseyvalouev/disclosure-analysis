Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question

Pump and Dump ("P&D") stocks that rise above $1.00 can offer the closest opportunity to
achieving a 100% success rate in investing. Of course, that is if you decide to short the
stock before the dump. It's been 13 months since we published our inaugural U.S. Pump
and Dump expose on Raystream (OTC:RAYS), highlighting the web of deceit woven by
the company in its attempt to round up investors. We introduced the RAYS story from our
perspective on December 8, 2011 at $1.75 and followed up with an extensive 40 page
report on December 29, 2011. RAYS shares have since careened from $1.75 to just
pennies. Since our RAYS work, we highlighted some of the most high profile pump and
dump stocks, warning investors of the impending implosions in share prices. Here are a
few:


Sefe (OTC:SEFE)
Great Wall Builders (OTCPK:GWBU)
First Quantum Ventures (OTCQB:DIMI)


This brings us to Echo Automotive (OTCPK:ECAU). On December 3, 2012, when the
stock was trading at $0.72, we informed GeoInvesting premium members that ECAU had
the makings of a potential P&D:


"Company just became public through a reverse merger transaction and claims to be
developing a set of technologies that it believes will reduce overall fuel expenses in
commercial fleet vehicles by augmenting existing power-trains with highly efficient
electrical energy delivered by electric motors. Although we have not noticed any
promotional pump activity on the company yet, we will monitor the story for such
developments since the industry they are playing in has been ripe with pump and
dump activity."


As it turns out, ECAU did not disappoint. On January 13, 2013, a promotional campaign
commenced through DH Media. We received two mailers from two notorious third party
P&D newsletters called Five Star Equities and The Bedford Report, both compensated by
DH Media. These newsletters are owned and operated by Providence Media Strategies
LLC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 2/22


A couple of weeks after we started to notice this promotional activity, on January 24, 2013
we stated:


"… we had been receiving new pump and dump material on this name. We added
ECAU to our Speculative Screen on 12/3/2012 at $0.72. We mentioned the
company had hired a third party for an "awareness campaign". The email campaign
seems to be in full gear as we have been receiving more pump newsletters in our
inbox. Please see email pump campaign here."


The stock responded and climbed to a high of $3.61 (an over 400% increase) on January
29, 2013.


Investors may be interested to know that The Bedford Report issued a bullish report on
Longwei Petroleum (LPH) on January 3, 2013, a couple of hours before we published our
in-depth investigatory report on this company, a piece in which we contended LPH to be
most brazen U.S. Listed Chinese company fraud to date. The company's shares fell over
70% to $0.62 within one hour of our report. During LPH's current halt, China's State-
owned CCTV news network confirmed some of our findings with their own on-the-ground
research, finally coming to some of the same conclusions as us.


Investors following ECAU may have noticed a Seeking Alpha article, "Echo Automotive
Stock Due For A Pullback?" published on January 29, 2013, insinuating that a pullback
was imminent, a sentiment that we shared due to our due diligence findings and
understanding of the Pump and Dump time frame as noted in the chart below. We are not
sure if this article was the catalyst to ECAU's current price drop (the stock was down 40%
in the January 30, 2013 trading session), but we believe the price will continue to drop.


Below is our detailed analysis of ECAU.


In our previous P&D articles we introduced the pump and dump time chart outlining the
average life of a pump before an ensuing dump.

* ECIT Ecoland Intl. changed its symbol to NRBT.


** SNPK changed its symbol to PHRX


*** ECAU's current IR firm, Crescendo Communications, LLC, also represented STEV and
STVF. Furthermore, all three were/are being touted by a common character in the P&D
world: Chuck Hughes


**** TBD


Please note that the same third party promotional characters behind the ECAU campaign
were behind STEV and STVF, two stocks which eventually collapsed.


Since ECAU has been pumping hard for 13 trading days we believe the pump will end
sooner rather than later. In fact the stock is already breaking down.


Through a holding company that is part of the corporate structure of ECAU, the company's
president along with the CEO received a combined 52.5 million shares as a result of the
reverse merger transaction with a shell company, Canterbury Resources. At ECAU's
highest price these shares were worth nearly $200 million. The reverse merger transaction
also resulted in the shareholders of the shell owning over 23,750,000 shares in free
trading stock (after a forward 4 for 1 stock split), and were worth close to $90 million at
ECAU's high. Financing arrangements concurrent with the reverse merger have also
created cheap shares through the issuance of warrants. This chain of events should not
come as a surprise to veterans of the P&D space who will probably know that the profit
tied up in these shares has to unwind, especially when considering the performance of the
stock.


Too Good To Be True


Echo Automotive LLC, a product of a reverse merger on October 15, 2012, is playing in a
"green" industry that has facilitated past P&Ds.


"Its operations consist of Echo Automotive, Inc. which is "developing a set of
technologies that it believes will reduce overall fuel expenses in commercial fleet
vehicles by augmenting existing powertrains with highly efficient electrical energy
delivered by electric motors powered by Echo's modular plug-in battery modules."


In simple terms, the company claims that its technology converts existing vehicles to
hybrids.

5/23/2018 Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 4/22


Echo states that it has developed a revolutionary advanced plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
("PHEV") technology, branded as EchoDrive™.


We find this amazing since according to the audited financial statement in the reverse
merger document this fledgling development stage company logged a total of $461,000 in
operating expenses and $423,000 from financing activities since its inception. We
question that the company has been able to develop a ground breaking technology and
test it on such a budget, especially since until its reverse merger operations consisted of
selling carbon credits, with little success.


The company's claim to fame is that its conversion process will be significantly less than
that of the competition, yet it clearly appears too early to make such a claim:


"While the basic technology has been verified, we only recently have begun the
commercialization of the complete plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) system in
preparation for our initial conversion of a vehicle. This limits our ability to accurately
forecast the cost of the conversions or to determine a precise date on which the
commercial platform for vehicle conversions will be widely released." (Source:
October 15, 2012 8K)


The company projects that:


In order to keep operations at the current level, $3.0 million will be required over the
next three months to cover our anticipated monthly expenses.
In order to successfully execute its business plan including the planned development
and marketing of current products, an additional $7.0 million will be required in long
term financing. (Source: Q3 2012 10Q)


We find these funding assumptions hard to believe since as we will show, similar
companies that require north of $100 million just to prepare their businesses.


Echo's SEC filings also make it quite clear that the attainment of profitability is not in the
cards anytime soon.


"Prior to obtaining customers and distribution for our products, we anticipate that we
will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We
therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 5/22


Dilution is a certainty and the company may already be in a liquidity crunch since the end
of 2012:


"Our cash on hand and working capital will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated
cash requirements through 2012. To date, our working capital has been a
combination of private investments, private loans, shareholder capital contributions,
and advances through promissory notes. We are currently seeking both short term
funding to finance current operations as well as significant amounts of long term
capital to execute our business plan."


Even so, with zero sales, negative equity, and 75 million shares Echo's capital structure
may not be conducive to raising capital, even if it has a viable product:


"We are pre-revenue and in the developmental stage and therefore we do not
internally generate adequate cash flows to support our existing operations Moreover,
the historical and existing capital structure is not adequate to fund our planned
growth."


Finally, it appears way too early to recognize Echo's ability to deliver results:


"Of even greater significance is that fact that we have no operating history with
respect to augmenting existing power trains with highly efficient electrical energy
delivered by electric motors powered by our modular plug-in battery modules."


As we will discuss later, based on comparable companies, we value ECAU as little as
$0.08 for investors who choose to consider it to be a legitimate operating entity. For those
who believe it is another fly by night P&D, a valuation of $0.013 may be more appropriate.


How to Build Legitimacy 101


The Echo pump has worked well as ECAU appears to be riding the coattails of existing
technology.


The Clean Futures Connection


ECAU has signed a licensing agreement with a company called Clean Futures LLC,
allowing ECAU the use of its conversion technology. As part of this transaction, Clean
Futures received warrants with an exercise price of $0.01. Thus far we have been unable

5/23/2018 Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 6/22


to find much information on a company called Clean Future LLC, but it appears that it was
established in April 2011. However, we did come across a website for Clean Futures Inc.


The Bright Connection


Bright Automotive ("Bright") was once a well-recognized company in the same space.
ECAU claims to have purchased some of Bright's intellectual property. In the end, Bright
did not receive the funding from the Department of Energy ("DOE") necessary to continue
operations, a failure which eventually led to Bright closing up shop in February 2012. The
DOE tightened up its lending program to the alternative vehicle industry when Solyndra
filed for Chapter 11 in September 2011 shortly after receiving $535 million from the
government and $198 million from the private market.


Bright was in the process of creating a fuel-efficient line of plug-in electric vehicles, but…


"one of its main focuses was plug-in technology retrofitting. This involves taking a
currently combustion engine powered car and turning it either into a hybrid or a fully
electric car."


Before Bright's demise, its future actually looked promising. It had received around $22
million in funding from bellwether names such as Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and a
branch of General Motors, General Motors Ventures, LLC.


Apparently, after the DOE tightened is lending standards, Bright could not receive
adequate funding or chose not to court venture capitalists. In total, Bright was asking for
$450 million from the DOE. So this gives us quite a sobering glance at what it would take
to commercialize some of Bright's IP!


The fuel for ECAU's promotional pump is not just comprised of the alleged purchase of
Bright's IP, but also includes the common P&D move of beefing up the Board of Directors
and Advisory Boards with recognizable names. In this case John Waters, the founder of
Bright, is a key figure head. He currently serves as part-time Chief Technology officer
("CTO") for Echo Automotive. To our knowledge and per SEC documents, it does not
appear that he has brought any funds to the table, meaning that ECAU, or should we say
Bright, will have to start from ground zero. We do not know if John is aware of the P&D
game.


A Pump and Dump Setting Could Not Ask For a Better Launching Pad

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 7/22


On May 22, 2012 ECAU claimed that it planned to spend $112,500 to purchase battery
pack IP and other assets from Bright Automotive. Then on June, 28, 2012 ECAU claimed
it had entered into a licensing agreement with Bright for $50,000:


"Bright hereby grants to Licensee a royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid up, worldwide,
non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sub-licensable limited license to use the
Battery Management Software and CAD of Exhibit A(l) ("Software") and intellectual
property of Exhibit A(2) ("Bright Intellectual Property") to develop, modify and/or sell,
offer for sale, market, distribute, import and export derivative works"


In consideration for the granting of this license, Licensee hereby agrees to pay to Bright a
one-time up-front license fee in the amount of Amount of $50,000."


Referencing the May 22, 2012 filing, a strange transaction occurred where ECAU loaned
$50,000 to Flagship Enterprise Center (landlord for the facility Echo claims to rent) to
purchase assets to be used by Echo.


Third party promotional letters wasted no time in touting ECAU's dream. Promoters have
insinuated that ECAU is a game-changer in its industry and have jumped all over the
knowledge that Google and a branch General Motors funded Bright's early development,
but in our opinion fail to sufficiently articulate the significant hurdles posed by the following
challenges:


The $450 million in capital Bright needed to commercialize its IP.
The extreme difficulty that similarly-focused companies have had in accessing capital
and succeeding in this market, even with viable IP.
The millions of dollars that a formidable competitor has received; a competitor that
appears to be cornering the conversion market.


This green vehicle push has become the "green monster", consuming capital at a rapid
rate and claiming casualties. The mere fact that GM's subsidiary invested $5 million in
Bright does not substantiate Bright's technology since it was never fully commercialized.
Furthermore, that fact that many companies have failed after receiving hundreds of
millions in financing drives this point home. One only has to reference past failures in this
industry. For example, the Solyndra Chapter 11 also underscores how tough it is to
succeed in the electric/hybrid vehicle industry.


This sequence of events forced us to seriously question the credibility and viability of
ECAU's story.

5/23/2018 Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 8/22


We find it illogical that just three months after Bright ceased operations, ECAU, a company
that…


Reported no revenues as its 2012 third quarter
Sports negative equity
Is operating with negative working capital
With 75 million shares outstanding does not have a shareholder friendly capital
structure for raising capital.
We believe could likely require north of $200 million in financing


…was able to strike a deal to purchase/license valuable intellectual property for a couple
hundred thousand dollars from a company that had raised tens of millions of dollars.


On the flip side, if Bright's IP referenced in ECAU's SEC filings is only worth $200,000, it
tells us that the venture capital market does not see a future in it, or they would have
certainly at least entertained paying for such a "ground-breaking" technology. ECAU wants
investors to believe that a reverse merged company generating no revenue is going to be
able to do what Bright could not - Raise some of the hundreds of millions of dollars Bright
was seeking in order to bring its product to market. We can only bid good luck to ECAU
and fortuity to investors who think ECAU will be among the first penny stock P&D to
deliver long lasting business success. Some will say that Bright folded due to the DOE
rejection. Well, only the strong survive. It seems that one company was able to survive
the DOE's tightened wallet and raise capital elsewhere from private equity and
partnerships. ECAU needs to be aware that it is going up against an intimidating
competitor with a significant head start - ALTe Powertrain Technologies.


Late To the Party - Assume For Arguments Sake That ECAU Is a Viable Operation


Despite the bold statements made in the promotional material describing ECAU's
opportunity, we don't think that the company is close to being a viable competitor at this
time. To really get a feel for what a legitimate company in ECAU's space should represent,
you can research ALTe Powertrain Technologies' ("ALTE") accomplishments and
achievements. This private company has raised significant capital amid a difficult financing
environment that has hurt its competitors.


ALTE descriptions:

"ALTe is developing range extended electric powertrains focusing initially on fleet
vehicles such as taxis, limos, delivery trucks, vans and shuttle buses in the light to
medium duty vehicle classes."


"ALTe is the developer of the first range-extended plug-in electric hybrid powertrain
used to repower light commercial vehicles. The system will be retrofit into existing
fleet vehicles as well as used in "glider" applications of new vehicles to dramatically
increase their fuel economy and lower emissions."


The company focuses on retrofitting used commercial vehicles.


Its first product line will be retrofitting Ford Motor Co. F-Series trucks for commercial fleets.
The trucks make up 55 percent of the commercial fleet market in the U.S.


Go here to see a demo of ALTE's conversion process.


Ahead of the Funding Curve


A quick look at ALTE news flow will show that ECAU will likely have to raise millions of
dollars to be in a position to compete with ALTE.


April 7, 2011 article from the NY Times:


"The company said it had also raised $16.5 million in private capital and that
hundreds of millions of dollars will be needed to deliver a finished product."


August 25, 2011 article from Crain s Detroit Business.com:


"Alte LLC has secured $100 million in financing to bring its range-extended
powertrains for commercial fleets to market,"


December 2012 Article at thegreenjob.com:


"ALTE has raised $20 million in private equity, and is setting up a $200 million joint
venture in China to manufacture and sell its conversion powertrain in Asia. $70
million is slated for R&D at its US location."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 10/22


ECAU has yet to ink contracts with suppliers for its components and has not identified
which company it will use to fulfill its manufacturing needs. More importantly, the company
has no customers at this time (Source: Q3 2012 10Q).


On the other hand, ALTE has all these ducks in a row.


In 2011 ALTE stated that:


"it has had interest to retrofit up to 900,000 vehicles with the Alte powertrain.
Thomas expects production to start in the second quarter of 2012. He projected
about $60 million in revenue next year." (Revenue generation was subsequently
been delayed by one year)


Furthermore ALTE:


"claims nearly 100 major fleets have driven an ALTe prototype vehicle. Ten are ready
to do pilot programs of up to two dozen vehicles."


"has demonstrated its powertrain technology in the United States by retrofitting Ford
150 trucks and Ford E350 vans for potential fleet customers."


"has a big Fleet Advisory Board, as ALTe calls it, composed of dozens of companies
such as Frito-Lay that operate big fleets."


ECAU is name-dropping potential customers like FedEx, but our research indicates that it
would face serious challenges in selling its product to a commercial customer base unless
it first shows it can achieve mass production. ALTE mentions this dilemma and crossed
this hurdle in 2012 when it secured a 4-year, $680 million deal with a Chinese customer to
supply 27,000 power trains for trucks and vans. Our knowledge of ALTE strengthens our
contention that ECAU could shape up as a Pump & Dump.


Valuation


Scenario 1


Investors who believe that ECAU is just another P&D will value shares as Shell Company.
We will be aggressive and use $1 million as our shell price tag which equates to a price
target of $0.013 per share. ($1 million aggressive shell valuation divided by 75 million
shares outstanding).


Scenario 2

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 11/22


Some investors may choose to compare it to a publicly traded company. AMP Holding
Company (AMPD.OB) converts gas powered vehicles to electric. Like ECAU, AMPD
generates insignificant revenues. Unlike ECAU, it claims to have the backing of a global
truck manufacturer, publicly traded Navistar Intl Corp (NYSE:NAV). AMPD's market cap is
around $6 million compared to ECOU's market cap of around $350 million at its peak.
ECAU would have to trade at $0.08 to be on par with AMPD valuation. To be fair, AMPD is
targeting a smaller market segment.


Scenario 3


Other Investors may choose to believe that ECAU is company that will take a stab at
building a viable company such as ALTE.


Our research indicates that ECAU will have to raise significant funds to start generating
meaningful revenue. We will be conservative and assume a $25 million funding
requirement at $1.00 per share. This would put shares outstanding at about 100 million.
We will also assume that ECAU:


Will raise capital in 2013 and generate $60 million in 2014, matching what ALTE
believes its revenue will be during its first revenue-generating year, and
Will optimistically be profitable with 10% net margins right out of the gate, even though
the company clearly mentions in its filing s that it will lose money for the foreseeable
future.


In this scenario, ECAU will earn EPS of $0.06 in 2014. Using a P/E of 15 to 25 implies that
ECAU would be worth $0.90 to $1.50. (Note that ECAU claims that it will require only $10
million to be in position to commercialize its IP, but based on our research we do not
subscribe to this assumption.)


In our opinion, any legitimate valuation scenario is likely a far-fetched one since the
company can be associated with the usual suspects of third party promoters. The
shareholders that buys stocks based on these promotions knows how the P&D game is
played and will not stick around as they attempt to guess when promoters and insiders
may start to sell their shares. As we expected and as relayed to our subscribers, these
parties end abruptly leading to shares free falling to just pennies.


Where Is The Proof?


The recent claims ECAU has made in its press releases and corporate presentation are
certainly eye grabbing. Several facets of the story leave us wondering how transparent
ECAU is being with investors.

Press Release Lacks Details


In a January 23, 2013 press release the company was proud to announce that it claimed
to have had its first public display demonstrating its proprietary hybrid electric vehicle.


"For example, the vehicle we previewed today is capable of running as a HEV,
PHEV or BEV with a simple push of the button. In BEV mode, it's running completely
under the propulsion of EchoDrive™ with the internal combustion engine turned off."


We expected to find link to a video presentation or photos of this grand event, but so far
we been unable to.


We have only been able to find a blueprint illustration of its concept presented on its
website and a 5 minute clip of what we deem to be investor hype.


Pricing Transparency


Apparently, the cost to convert an existing commercial vehicle to a Hybrid using the
EchoDrive system ranges between $10,000 to 12,000, which is much lower than
competitor's prices that can be as high as $30,000.


Electric vehicle companies cite battery costs as the overriding reason for the heavy price
tag charged to perform conversions. For example, the cost of the batteries its competitors
pay in their systems can reach north of $15,000.


If competitors are buying batteries at prices as high as $15,000, how can Echo claim that
its total conversion process is cheaper than the battery itself. A plausible explanation
would be that Echo is omitting battery costs from the conversion estimate. If this is the
case, then their value proposition is significantly altered.


Basically, per the company's investor presentation, it looks like the company it saying that
its technology enables it to utilize a battery with 12 kHw vs. 48 kHw used by the
competition. Better yet, it claims that there is no loss of performance in commercial
vehicles when using the smaller batteries in conjunction with its technology. ECAU alleges
that it also achieves cost savings because its EchoDrive can be easily bolted onto or
retrofitted onto an existing vehicle's powertrain. ECAU claims that it gives it a competitive
advantage since its peers require the removal of the original powertrain to complete
conversions.

5/23/2018 Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 13/22


ECAU's IP seems like a gold mine, yet it chose to go public through a reverse merger
transaction. Keep in mind that ECAU clearly states that the battery pack is not the only
cost to consider:


"The EchoDrive components include an electric motor, power electronics, hybrid
controller, battery cells, and modular battery-pack."


More importantly, recall that the company disclosed:


"While the basic technology has been verified, we only recently have begun the
commercialization of the complete plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) system in
preparation for our initial conversion of a vehicle. This limits our ability to
accurately forecast the cost of the conversions or to determine a precise date on
which the commercial platform for vehicle conversions will be widely released."


Although we would like to see the company demonstrate its capabilities before blindly
accepting its cost assumptions, inconsistencies we discuss next have raised some red
flags.


The Flip Flop


It appears that there is one subtle inconsistency that indicates something is amiss in
ECAU's presentation of its business model. We came across a website that highlighted
the ECAU story on November 29, 2012.


Here is a screen shot from this website which appears to be a page taken out of ECAU's
website.

5/23/2018 Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 14/22


Notice the following quote:


"The cost of the battery is expected to run between $10,000 to 12,000, which is
perhaps a cost saving compared to some current compact car battery packs that
begin at $12,000 to $15,000."


This quote is somewhat perplexing. It is clearly saying that the cost of the battery is
$10,000 to $12,000, which appears to contradict Echo's claim that the entire conversion
process will range from $10,000 to $12,000. This contradiction supports our opinion that
ECAU'S conversion cost estimates may be off.


Moving on, we found it odd that we could not locate this quote at ECAU'S current website.


ECAU P&D: The Common Thread


Although a dissection of potential P&D business plan can give insight into the credibility of
its story, this task is really not necessary for those who are not new to the P&D space. By
now, investors should easily realize the presence of a common thread woven into pump
and dump stories, no matter how alluring they appear.



http://www.echoautomotive.com/about-us

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 15/22


The second that promotional activity commences in the penny stock world with the usual
suspects is when we can begin to surmise that the target company has entered the pump
and dump zone.


We have yet to see a P&D perform well much past the average dictated by our pump and
dump clock.


So let's take a closer look at Providence Media Strategies ("PMS"), the company that is
funding the ECAU third party promotional campaign. PMS owns the following tout letters;


BedfordReport.com
EastwindResearch.com
ElitePennyStock.com
FiveStarEquities.com
MomentumHunter.com
PennyAuthority.com
ParagonReport.com
PennyLaneReports.com


For the sake of brevity, here is just a sampling of pump and dump stories affiliated with
PMS which can give investors in ECAU a glimpse of what they can look forward to if they
hang on to their shares too long:


*ECAU's current IR firm, Crescendo Communications, LLC, also represented STEV and
STVF.


Motivation for the Pump


Reverse Merger Process


P&D reverse merger transactions often create liquidity and shares with little or no cost
basis.
5/23/2018 Echo Automotive's 'Bright Future' In Question - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 16/22


A P&D scenario needs to be accompanied by ample volume so that participants of the
reverse merger shell will have an environment to sell shares of stock in order to rake in
huge profits. The process of ECAU's reverse merger included a 4 for 1 forward stock split
creating the perfect scenario to absorb increased share volume and over 20 million shares
of freely trading stock owned by pre-merger shareholders.


As we mentioned earlier, through a holding company that is part of the corporate structure
of ECAU, the company's President t, Jason Plotke, and CEO, Dan Kennedy , received a
combined 52.5 million shares as a result of the October 2012 reverse merger transaction.
At ECAU's high these shares were worth nearly $200 million.


Financing


A notable amount of Pump and Dumps attempt to build investor confidence by
announcing financing arrangements. We deem these actions to be just a smoke and
mirrors game. These financing arrangements are usually structured so that the provider of
capital receives stock that will more than cover the amount of the loan commitment,
especially with the onset of a successful pump campaign.


On July 13, 2012 Josh Lambert entered into a promissory note agreement, lending the
company $65,000. In return:


"Within 120 days of the execution of this promissory note, Borrower will issue Lender
warrants to purchase $65,000 of stock (130,000 shares) at no more than $0.01 per
share."


At ECAU's high Mr. Lambert's warrant s were worth about $470,000


On July 13, 2012, William Kennedy, CEO, entered into a promissory note agreement,
lending the company $50,000. In return:


"Within 120 days of the execution of this promissory note, Borrower will issue Lender
warrants to purchase $50,000 of stock (100,000 shares) at no more than $0.01 per
share."


At ECAU's high Mr. Kennedy's warrants were worth about $350,000.


Both note agreements carry a hefty interest rate of 21% and entitle the lenders to receive
1 share of stock at $0.01 for every $10 of outstanding debt at the end of each calendar
month. These are essentially riskless loans as long as the stock is equal to or greater than

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147071-echo-automotives-bright-future-in-question 17/22


$0.01 and the structure of the loan provides a great incentive for a "third party" pump
campaign.


There are a few other factors to rationalize a pump:


Per the terms of a $2,000,000 financing agreement on May 16, 2012 an outfit called
Hartford Equity allegedly committed to provide financing of not less than $2 million within
twelve (12) months of this agreement.


The terms of this financing agreement call for Hartford or its associates to purchase
common shares at $0.50 and included warrants at an exercise price of $0.75.


Based on information in SEC filings, we calculate that Hartford or its associates likely own
about 2.5 million shares of ECAU common stock (not even including the warrants) that
were worth around $9 million at ECAU's high; easily enough to reel in a profit from its
investment in a company with no revenues and still honor its "commitment."


Licensing Arrangements That Contain Warrant Clauses


On February 1, 2012 ECAU entered into a licensing agreement with a company called
Clean Futures. Apparently Clean futures is allowing ECAU to use its "technologies" in its
products. As part of the licensing agreement Clean Futures received warrants enabling it
to purchase shares of ECAU's common stock at 0.50.


We do not know if a related party relationship exists between ECAU and CleanFutures,
but this is quite a deal for Clean Futures. We presume that the company has converted its
warrants since:


"CleanFutures will have the right to sell the common stock at any time after the initial
funding of ControlledCarbon subject to the terms of the voting rights agreement."


We are assuming that the July 13, 2013 promissory notes and the Hartford loan have
satisfied this requirement.


Dose of Reality: Investors Need To Wake Up


ECAU is possibly shaping up to be one of the most cunning pump and dumps we have
come across due to the fact that it goes a long way to sprinkle specs of legitimacy across
its story. Like many P&Ds, ECAU portrays an air of legitimacy by discussing:


patents,
trademarks,

licensing agreements,
potential relationships with fortune 500 names ,
marketing material showing their products with Fortune 500 names imprinted on them,
even though no relationship has been established (in this case ECAU is using the Fed
Ex name)
a billion dollar opportunity ,
being first to market
prepackaging an old story


We are not saying that investors can't make money during the pump phase, but our P&D
time chart and current price action indicates that ECAU is in the process of imploding. The
clock is winding down…Tick Tock.

Bright Future
Thank you for this thorough report. I got in on Monday morning, January 28th at $1.88 after reading a piece here on
Seeking Alpha ("Echo Automotive Crushes The Hybrid Vehicle Competition," PabloPicker's Instablog) that was
posted Friday evening, January 25th. I'd been watching ECAU for several weeks and, hopeful that this company
might be on the brink of building a truly great business, I pulled the trigger when I noticed that the stock was really
starting to move. The enormous gains that followed later that day and on the 29th gave me reason to suspect this was
a pump and dump, but I could not be sure until I read this article. On Friday, February 1, I sold at $1.44. Yes, I wish I
had gotten out at $3.00 or $3.50, but I thought I was long. Regardless, I am grateful that my losses were minimal, and
for the all-too-personal education on pump and dumps.

If you follow Paragon, you will realize that they get paid around $75,000 to tout a stock. Usually after a few
days of their touting the stock inevitably shoots up. And a few days later inevitably comes down. Happened
with ORYN, GRPH, ECAU, and others I'm sure. Keep an eye out for these deceitful pumpers. Paradoxically, if
anything, I'd regard their advice as a shorting opportunity.

For those shorting the stock, can I ask where you have your accounts? The company I have my main account does
not allow me to short OB stocks. I regularly get spam about stocks like these and have just been deleting them. Then
it hit me that I should wait until they run up from the hype and then short them. I just need to find a platform. Thanks.

Author’s reply »  The rides up and down can surely be substantial. We've been trying to stay disciplined to our "clock"
outlined above. It has an uncanny rate of success, and hopefully as we continue to identify more p&d's as well as the
major fee collectors/promoters, we can hone the methodology to making money on both the upswings and
downswings.

I live in Indy and have seen this vehicle; the technology is ingenious and will revolutionize the hybrid industry for
service vehicles. 
I attended the NTEA this week and visited ECAU/Booth 633. 
There was tremendous interest in the product on Wednesday!


The naysayers are creating unfounded financial fears to capitalize on stock fluctuation - calling this a pump and dump. 
No question the stock was pumped, but not by internal consulting/marketing teams, rather external financial
newsletters, seeking to capitalize on price movement.


Surprising how another Seeking Alpha contributor writes an article: 
"Echo Automotive (ECAU) Crushes The Hybrid Vehicle Competition" and concludes in his final paragraph: "Instead of
the costly manufacturing of other hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Motor Prius and Ford Motor Company's Fusion, Echo
Automotive has a real shot with their "bolt-on and go" feature at changing how fleet industry vehicle manufacturers
look at fuel-saving research and design....While it might appear to be inconsequential to those not so familiar with

hybrid electric vehicles, for those who have their finger on the pulse of demand for fuel-efficient vehicles, it's a huge
deal...."  
http://seekingalpha.co...


Regarding cash burn rate: 
It is no surprise that start up companies burn through capital, frequently for years to develop a product. The big
difference for ECAU >> they have a product that has been running for almost a year.


And don't be lulled into believing that just because competitors like Alt-E have burned through millions to get to their
present state, that ECAU will need to follow the same path and yield no results. 
In fact the innovative edge that I believe will allow this technology to quickly move into the market, is the fact that they
already have a product, and have built relationships with large national franchises: AAMCO & Meineke for installation
- a creative and cost-effective method to quickly ramp up sales/install.


Alt-E requires removal of engine/ exhaust/gas tank and replacement with an alternative power train; a complex and
lengthy process. If the new system fails, the vehicle is rendered useless until it can be repaired. 
http://bit.ly/WfQyYl


EchoDrive is a bolt-on technology that mounts to existing drive train, and thus not requiring the complexity nor time to
complete the process. Furthermore, in the unlikely event of a system failure, the vehicle can be immediately
converted to the original fossil-fuel system and thus not result in a vehicle out-of-service. 
http://bit.ly/V5SZyh


There are some saying Mayor Ballard was duped; I assure you this savvy Mayor/war veteran is no dupe; his
comments are genuine.


I am surprised at the lack of understanding of an innovative product like Echo Drive being so quickly written off
without any of the authors understanding or commenting on the technology.


As Pablo mentions in his Seeking Alpha Article: the March Truck /Equipment Convention will be a good proxy for the
reception of this type of technology.


Having seen the vehicle firsthand, knowing that it has been functioning for almost a year; I am a believer that this
technology will be well received by the industry. I am in for the long-term!
