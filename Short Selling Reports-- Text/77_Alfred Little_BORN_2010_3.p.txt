China New Borun: Investors Race to Exit as Concerns Mount
Nov. 10, 2010 3:59 PM ET16 comments
by: Alfred Little


Following the resignation of four directors announced yesterday, China New Borun
(NYSE: BORN) private equity investors (Star Elite, Earnstar and TDR) are now racing to
sell their holdings (see table below). On December 10  the 180 day lock-up agreement
they signed expires, allowing them to sell up to 5,152,189 shares at any time.


Additionally, the expiration of the lock-up allows the 14,847,811 shares held by Chairman
Jinmiao Wang’s mother Mrs. Shan Junqin to also be sold. Both Mrs. Shan’s and Star
Elite’s share sales require disclosures to be filed upon any sale and are subject to volume
restrictions.


However, Earnstar and TDR will be free to sell their combined holdings of 1,440,237 or
5.6% of the outstanding shares without restriction in the open market and with no filing
requirements since they each hold under 5% and their Director appointees resigned last
week according to BORN’s press release yesterday (available here). Two additional
executive directors (the COO and Controller) also resigned while retaining their
management roles, reducing the total number of directors from 9 to 5.


The remaining board now consists of two executive directors and three independent
directors, meeting the minimum requirement for a majority independent board according to
the NYSE.


According to Borun’s Shareholders Agreement (available here), the directors representing
the private equity investors each have the right to serve until the next Annual General
Meeting which would occur after the 2010 audited financials are filed on Form 20-F, most
likely next March. These investors also each have the right to nominate at least one
director to serve on Borun’s board for the next term. So BORN’s sudden, unexpected and
unplanned announcement that Earnstar and TDR’s appointed directors resigned is a clear
sign that these investors plan to imminently sell their shares.

I contacted Earnstar today and in fact, a representative, Mr. Li, told me the fund wants to
sell and was interested whether I know any buyers. Additionally, Star Elite is likely also
eager to sell the 3,711,952 or 14.4% of the outstanding shares they hold since they have
more than 500% gain over the past two years. Together, all these shares constitute a huge
overhang for BORN.


Private equity investors with huge gains cannot be blamed for wanting to sell and take
their profits. However, the abrupt decision and manner in which they are choosing to sell is
very revealing. Normally, a company will coordinate with its private equity investors to find
suitable replacements for their Board appointees well in advance of their resignation. In
fact, normally the private equity director appointees will serve a full term, even if their
funds sell a portion of their share holdings.


The fact that these two directors resigned last week immediately following the allegations
and questions I raised in my prior articles (available here, here and here) clearly indicates
their lack of confidence in the company. Keep in mind that they have unrestricted access
and insight into BORN’s business through their board seats that gives them a huge
advantage in timing their exit from BORN compared to public shareholders.


The questions I raised in my prior articles, especially the 270 million RMB undisclosed
debt and the fact BORN is conducting a secret upgrade of its antiquated wet production
method, are enough to explain why anyone would want to sell this stock. I plan to publish
additional details on BORN’s secret plant upgrade along with proof of how they have
attempted to conceal the plant upgrade later this week.


BORN reports earnings on Tuesday. Analysts expect results to be seasonally weak and
down year over year due to the dilution from the IPO. Although management has
completely avoided responding to any of my questions, I hope that on Tuesday’s
conference call they will finally be cornered and forced to admit the truth, unless of course
they choose to only allow easy questions from the bankster analysts who don’t want to
rock the boat while their firms compete for a lucrative piece of the widely anticipated
dilutive secondary offering.

There's a lot of speculation in your article. You assume that those investors will sell their shares on December 10th.
How do you know for sure? You saw that in a crystal ball?


You also say: "I contacted Earnstar today and in fact, a representative, Mr. Li, told me the fund wants to sell and was
interested whether I know any buyers."


It sounds a little strange that this person would ask if you knew anyone interested in buying their shares. It would be
pretty stupid of them to tell you in advance that they are planning to sell their shares, since that would cause a drop in
share price and lower the current value of their investment. No one in their right mind would ever say that.

The alcohol producer announced that two of its board members resigned. China New Borun reports earnings Nov. 16.
Analysts see profit rising 17% to 35 cents a share. It had previously delivered four straight quarters of triple-digit
growth.


i agree with the last person's comments 100%. Also you say in your prevoius report that you do not count earnings of
the other branch of borun becuase it is unavailable to you, HOWEVER, THE OTHER BRANCH IS DOING MORE
THAN EXPECTED 26% - ACCORDING TO AMERICAN ANALYSTS REPORTS LAST WEEK.


PREVOIUS LISTING: 
Investors Business Daily gave it the No. 1 position in the IBD 100.


CURRENT LISTING: 
The stock boasts a 99 Composite Rating and is highlighted at the top of the Alcohol/Tobacco sector column in IBD's
stock tables.

I smirk at this company's "outstanding performance records". I reside in China and know edible alcohol is an over-
supply industry. Most manufactures were on brink of bankruptcy in 2009 and just got back their feet in 2010.
Producing alcohol from corn has low profit margin and profits risk on the price of corn. BORN frauding 2009 financials
for IPO is for sure. Whether or not they are cooking its 2010 Q1,2,3, well, most likely, yes.


Common sense, perhaps, matters for common investors.


Thank you, Little, for raising the concern and surfacing the truth!

You should have listened to GRRF's CC this morning. They totally cherry-picked who they allowed on the call and of
course the horrific balance sheet was totally avoided, meanwhile they pumped up the PPS with a totally fraudulent PR

at the end of October saying they won a big contract, yet I learned that this contract bid win was only for the right to
negotiate for future sales for some of their products. The PPS is soaring pre-market on a Q-4 revenue guidance raise,
but of course no one wants to discuss the EPS over the last 9 months, or 0.00, or a loss of $712K with huge liabilities,
growing A/R's and a cash position that only allows them two more quarters of operations. Ya think a huge capital raise
is on the way ? Geez, GRRF is selling at $3.58 pre-market, up .60 and it's not worth a penny over $1.25

Alfred Little,


How much do hedge funds pay you to post your lies?

You are short and with each new post you lose credibility and power. Keep talking...

another factor you did not count on was the: 
INCREASE IN GOODS SOLD & RISE OF THE SALES COST 
therefore with the cost of production down and the inventory stock is up due to the new factory BEING FULLY
OPERATIONAL;  
There is an automatic increase in profit from sales and from asset about 27%. ALSO YOU HAVE TO COUNT ON
THE INVENTORY HELD PREVIOUSLY AT A REDUCED COST BASIS ONE IS TO DEDUCE AN AUTOMATIC GAIN
IN PROFIT MARGIN BY A MINIMUM OF 30% ON TOP OF CURRENT NUMBERS .  
As you have said you lived in China for 10 years; Therefore ANYONE can deduce a RISEin alcohol production and
consumption for the 3rd and 4th Quarter are consistent year after year. 
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE TRIPLE DUIGUITS GROWTH FOR THIS QUARTER AND OF COURSE
THE LAST AND MOST PROFITABLE QUARTER.

BORN 
i was going long before, but since these poor articles wriiten, i am using 50% Long to see after reports of earning
come in, and 50% short to take advantage of these abuse articles. 
I am holdings 16,000 shares pruchased below $10.00 My short have consisted of 4000 shares only. THE LONG IS
WHERE THE MONEY IS FOR CHINA NEW BORUN; When the earning report comes out, you can count on a
$3.00-$4.00 increase in same day profits.


CTRP 
I have been long on this stock for some time now, but as the 3rd and 4th quarter arrive, it is time to short this stock
and begin reaping some profits. 
I am holding 600 shares

A series of negative articles by someone shorting the stock. How self-serving, unethical and biased. Maybe you are
missing your calling, Mr. Little. You should see if Fox News is hiring.

Author’s reply »  Refco, Inc. entered crisis on Monday, October 10, 2005, when it announced that its chief executive
officer and chairman, Phillip R. Bennett had hidden $430 million in bad debts from the company's auditors and
investors, and had agreed to take a leave of absence. 
Refco said that through an internal review over the preceding weekend it discovered a receivable owed to the
company by an unnamed entity that turned out to be controlled by Mr. Bennett, in the amount of approximately
US$430 million. Apparently, Bennett had been buying bad debts from Refco in order to prevent the company from
needing to write them off, and was paying for the bad loans with money borrowed by Refco itself. Between 2002 and
2005,[1] he arranged at the end of every quarter for a Refco subsidiary to lend money to a hedge fund called Liberty
Corner Capital Strategy, which then lent the money to Refco Group Holdings. Bennett's company then paid the
money back to Refco, leaving Liberty as the apparent borrower when financial statements were prepared. It is not yet
clear if Liberty knew it was hiding scam transactions; management of the fund has claimed that they believed it was
borrowing from one Refco subsidiary and lending to another Refco sub, and not lending to an entity that Mr. Bennett
secretly controlled. On October 20, they announced plans to sue Refco. 
In April 2006, papers filed by creditors of Refco seemed to show that Bennett had run a similar scam going back at
least to 2000, using Bawag P.S.K. Group in the place of Liberty Corner Capital Strategy.[1] 
The law requires that such financial connections between corporation and its own top officers be shown as what is
known as a related party transaction in various financial statements. As a result, Refco said, "its financial statements,
as of, and for the periods ended, Feb. 28, 2002, Feb. 28, 2003, Feb. 28, 2004, Feb. 28, 2005, and May 31, 2005,
taken as a whole, for each of Refco Inc., Refco Group Ltd. LLC and Refco Finance Inc. should no longer be relied
upon." 
This announcement triggered a number of investigations, and on October 12 Bennett was arrested and charged with
one count of securities fraud for using U.S. mail, interstate commerce, and securities exchanges to lie to investors.
His lawyer said that Bennett planned to fight the charges. On October 19, trading of Refco's shares was halted on the

New York Stock Exchange, which later delisted the company. Before the halt, Refco shares were trading for more
than $28 per share, and as of October 19, they had dropped (on the pink sheets) to $0.80 per share.

What about the recent Citron Research Report alleging they are a fraud? Could that be why they want to sell all their
shares asap? Do they know something we don't know? Are they running for the exits and then someone else is left
holding the bag?

Another scam article Alfred? The title says it all. Are you sure investors raced to the exit or was it traders? So far there
are no SEC reports for sellers. Maybe its time you stop misleading people and clean up your act. This company
continues to deliver and the stock has recovered since you made these allegations. You too may find yourself in front
of a judge. Just because the executives and the companies reside in CHINA there are investors here in the US who
plan to take action on those who smeared our investments.
