iBio: A Wannabe Ebola Player Infecting Buyers With False Hope

Summary


iBio has suggested that its technology might play a serious role in the mass
production of an Ebola drug that already utilizes a rival delivery system to handle
that process instead.


Rival Icon Genetics developed its own plant delivery system more than a decade
ago, and has spent the past eight years collaborating with the actual maker of the
new Ebola drug.


The head of the government-funded lab where iBio would like to offer its services
has essentially ruled out any changes to the existing process used to make that
experimental drug.


Mere weeks ago, before it suddenly exploded as a speculative Ebola name, iBio felt
willing to sell a mountain of new shares at a fraction of their current market price.


Low on cash and poised to sell a ton of dilutive shares, iBio relied on hype to set its
stock on fire – and might try that same trick again.


Shame on iBio (NYSEMKT:IBIO) for pulling a dangerous stunt that could soon cost its
shareholders a staggering fortune. No matter how tempted IBIO might have felt to further
capitalize on the Ebola scare - or how thrilled it must be with the immediate results - the
company should have known better than to hype a vague possibility so remote that it
looks downright far-fetched.


Get ready for the truth to unfold and reality to exact its inevitable toll.


Let's cut to the chase and get straight to the point. In short, IBIO has suggested that its
technology might play a serious role in the mass production of a promising new Ebola
drug that already utilizes a rival delivery system to handle that process instead. Since IBIO
has so far tested its own delivery system on just a handful of vaccines in early-stage
safety trials - and the company never even bothered to mention the word "Ebola" in its
recent 92-page 10K report - the government might feel understandably reluctant to let

some manufacturer casually substitute the firm's experimental technology for the very
platform used to engineer that vital treatment and simply hope that it produces the same
kind of results.


Last week, in fact, the head of the government-funded lab where IBIO would like to offer
its services virtually ruled out the likelihood of any changes to the existing process at all.
Look at the revealing comments shared by Dr. Brett Girior, chief executive of the health
science center at Texas A&M, in the following excerpt from a recent media report:


"'We believe there are substantial opportunities to increase the yield of ZMapp (the
new Ebola treatment) in plants while keeping the product the same,' Giroir said in an
interview. The compound needs to be identical to what Mapp (the maker of the drug)
has already vetted in animals, 'or you would have to go back to the beginning for
safety testing,' he said."


Based upon the information that we've uncovered while conducting our extensive
research, we feel so confident that IBIO will play no role in the urgent mass production of
ZMapp that we dare the company to share any concrete evidence that clearly suggests
otherwise. We also strongly encourage bullish investors to present the same type of
request to IBIO or - better yet - Caliber Biotherapeutics, the firm that IBIO likes to treat as
its potential ticket to the ZMapp production line, since it has put so much money on the
line. We highly doubt that it will feel quite so confident in its investment once it finishes that
exercise, but we certainly invite the company to share any feedback that might prove us
wrong as well.


So far, of course, IBIO has simply hinted at the tantalizing prospect of an Ebola-related
deal. If IBIO had any legitimate reason to expect an actual contract of some kind, its
promotional nature strongly suggests the company would have jumped at the first chance
to broadcast that news in all of its glorious detail. By merely highlighting an unrelated
agreement with one of the firms equipped to to ramp up production of ZMapp, however,
the company has relied on vague innuendo to make investors arrive at a favorable
conclusion instead.


With little to hype beyond a somewhat dated agreement to supply its delivery system to
Caliber for the development of an ONCOLOGY drug (a pesky detail that management
conveniently forgot to mention), IBIO hardly seems like a real contender in the race to
produce that new Ebola drug at all.

Its chances look even slimmer with a rival like Icon Genetics already in the picture.
Founded long before IBIO ever surfaced as an obscure penny-stock company, Icon
developed its own plant-delivery system more than a decade ago, and soon went on to
forge such a close relationship with Mapp Pharmaceuticals and Kentucky Bio-Processing
(KBP) - the creator and the manufacturer of ZMapp, respectively - that at one point, the
trio practically decided to merge. While they may have changed their plans about that
particular deal, they maintained their partnership (collaborating together for a total of eight
long years at this point) and now credit the entire team for the potential success of their
new Ebola drug.


Just ask Mapp how much it depended on both Icon and KBP throughout the process that
led to that celebrated breakthrough.


"Two partnerships were crucial to us in the development of the plant system for ZMapp:
Icon Genetics AG (Halle, Germany) and Kentucky BioProcessing (KBP, Owensboro, KY),"
Mapp emphasizes on its own website. "Icon pioneered vectors for engineering Nicotania
(a low-nicotine tobacco plant) to produce pharmaceuticals. KBP specializes in GMP
manufacturing of therapeutic proteins" in that same kind of plant.


Mapp has shared credit with Icon and KBP in the media, too. This summer, in fact, The
New York Times - none other than the self-proclaimed "newspaper of record" itself -
reported that Icon had developed the system used to introduce the genes from modified
antibodies into tobacco plants and ultimately produce the new Ebola drug. By now, many
other media outlets - ranging from Time magazine to all sorts of trade publications - have
cited Icon as the firm responsible for providing the unique delivery system required for that
process as well.


Given that sort of publicity, IBIO must surely know the truth at this point. Unless the
company has somehow managed to completely overlook Icon for some inexplicable
reason, however, it must have decided to conveniently pretend as that German firm - far
more established than itself - doesn't exist at all. Mere days ago, in fact, a company
spokesman reportedly told the press that "any lab that wants to make a ZMapp vaccine
using plant-based technology would have to license it from IBIO" itself.


Wow. Talk about a bold statement. Perhaps IBIO should have decided to just kept its
mouth shut.


After all, as its recent stock chart so vividly illustrates, IBIO immediately plummets as soon
as investors sense any reason for doubt. Exploding one day and plunging the next, that
volatile stock has swung all the way between $3.48 and $1.24 a share over the course of

the past week alone.


Who knows where IBIO might trade by the time that it issues the mountain of stock that it
just registered to sell under a prearranged fundraising deal? Still, we do know this much
for sure: IBIO felt willing to sell more than 20 million shares of stock - enough to dilute the
value of its current shares by roughly 30% - for as little as 44 cents a share just a few
short weeks ago. Plus, as recently as mid-September, a major IBIO shareholder (and a
frequent seller of the company's stock) continued to trim his position in the bleeding firm at
a modest fraction of the current market price, too.


If anyone knows how much IBIO is really worth, the company and an investor who owns
more than 10% of the firm certainly should. So maybe their actions make perfect sense.


Think about it.


With no mention of Ebola in its recent registration statement or its latest Annual Report -
both comprehensive documents filed less than a month ago - IBIO likely never dreamed
that it might somehow luck out and explode in value as a promising Ebola play. In
fairness, given the circumstances, IBIO could have always changed its mind since that
time. If IBIO suddenly realized that it might have a realistic shot at landing a contract to
help produce a new Ebola drug, however, the company just missed the perfect chance to
make that clear. IBIO failed to mention Ebola in the detailed prospectus that it filed just two
short days ago as well.


Granted, IBIO seems to prefer playing it a bit safer by hyping its prospects in casual press
releases instead. And now that it's free to start selling all of that stock that it registered
earlier this month, the company might just decide to test its luck once again.


IBIO better not count on such amazing results next time, however. By then, after all,
investors will know all about this dirty trick.

Its the Ebola pump and dump frenzy right now ... good times. An author posted on this stock about ~2yrs ago when it
was trading around $1-1.50 that it would trend down to $0.50 for various reasons, the pumpers were "outraged" and
filled the comment board with the usual fact-less 'how could you say that' posts. All I see with IBIO is a stock with zero
revenues, ongoing dilution, and a "wonderful pipeline of potential" that has failed to produce anything...

Of course, the problem is that this article was written, in part, to help drive down the stock price so the owners of
Street Sweeper will profit. Unfortunately for IBIO longs, what's in the article is completely true. IBIO has been a pump
and dump operation for years, just keeping its head above water by diluting its stock value and convincing more of the
gullible to "buy it while it's cheap". Let's see, it's at $1.36 as I write this. Cheap enough for a company that has almost
nothing but blue sky for assets? I doubt it.

A decent enough compilation of existing information and historical realizations except for two crucial omissions. If
production of ZMAPP were to be quickly ramped up, who could do that? The organizations referenced above do not
have that capability. Caliber Biotherapeutics seems the obvious choice but another question is: What exactly does
IBIO's licensing agreement with Caliber entail?


Given that WHO seems to be getting this Ebola outbreak under control now, IBIO will likely drift lower anyway, but
until those crucial production questions are addressed, the info in your article is nothing more than market chatter.

Nothing more than an attempt to cloud issues, confuse would be investors and scare the hell out of longs. I
bet the author could have a successful career in politics. Assumptions that clinical trials need to be held for a
plant inoculation process, when the drug itself being produced in those plants is not approved by the FDA, is
faulty logic at best. The Gov has already stated a goal of stockpiling 50M doses. That figure is not based on
whether or not we ever see another case of Ebola in America. Current production rates are estimated at 20K
doses PER YEAR. IBIO technology claims to ramp that number up to 20K per month. The Feds are
desperate and IBIO is going to get a chance to prove its technology much to the chagrin of anybody unlucky
enough to be short the morning that news breaks.

"The plant expression vector technology for antibody development in plants used by Mapp was obtained under a
research license from Icon Genetics AG; however, issued U.S. patents owned by iBio dominate the Icon technology. 
Therefore, to avoid patent infringement in the U.S. any manufacturer of the ZMapp product, unless the production
process is degraded to using public domain methods alone, will require a commercial license from iBio. 
Manufacturers of ZMapp may also require a commercial license from Icon for the use of that company's proprietary
technology even though it falls under the claims of certain iBio patents." http://bit.ly/1xeIOp3;t=

Streetsweeper,


That was an amazing job cutting up IBIO.


Impressive. I believe I recognize these prose but maybe not ....


I bet I know what time your boss covered from watching the action. Well done with the disclaimer as well. Paid staff
writer.


Well since the person who wrote it was doing a hatchet job. Well done but kinda sleazy. I would prefer to live honestly
to unctuously and this was written to manipulate. It is what it is but it lessens the site. So boo to you streets weeper I
feel dirty having read this.


I believe fecesshmeerer or dungthrower would be a more appropriate handles then streetsweeper and provide way
better pictures for your avatar in the future.

Accusations are not facts and certainly not proof of any wrong doing. In the case of IBIO, Rosen has neither
fact nor proof, but thats beside the point. Rosen’s only goal is to drive the stock price down for his clients. Ask
yourself, “how would Rosen have any proof of its claim?” It’s asinine to think someone outside of the company
would have such information, let alone a hack law firm that works in collusion with professional traders. And
Rosen is making this claim less than a week after IBIO made the statements in question. Again, wheres the
proof? IBIO was the victim of 2 hit pieces and a phony lawsuit all in a single day. Now the message boards
are rife with paid bashers. IBIO suffers because a drop in stock price from current levels to previous offers
those who have taken a short position the greatest potential gain. This is stock price manipulation 101 and
jackals like Rosen hurt many good people badly.

all the "research" you have done I can't believe you did not come across the fact that Robert Erwin has some intimate
ties to multiple companies involved in this process including prior chair for Icon Genetics before it was acquired by
Bayer and a partner of Novici whom Mapp themselves have stated they are in discussions with. Obviously it's all
speculation but the ties are a bit eerie but in the LONGS favor. The sad part is all your bashing will and has
accomplished what you want which is to drop the share price to allow you to profit with a company of such great
potential. Also I hope you sleep well knowing that I'm sure this will create a lot of over head price resistance due to all

the negativity making investors who do not take the time to do adequate DD but listen to narrowminded view points
like yours in making investing decision. What does that cause? The inability for this company to reach its true value to
allow them to fund their research and production. Many promising therapeutics never reach the light of day due to
inadequate funding before bankruptcy and articles like yours contributes to that travesty. Also completely misleading
statement in regards to the Aspire funding. The company could not predict the great exposure the ebola crisis has
provided so of course they looked for funding. However the fact that they control the timing and price of sale based on
current market pricing is highly in shareholder favor as it decreases the risk of dilution. You call it a "mountain" of
shares but the only reason it is thus is because of all the shorting causing decrease share price which in effect allows
them to get more shares for their investment. You are in fact creating the dilution you so easily chastise the company
for. Part of me wonders if potentially Aspire is funding the bashing to to allow them to get more shares at the cheap
value during this 24 month restriction period. Sleep well for now but I hope Ibio is working on a counter suit for such
vague slanderous remarks you have made.

Looks like the Street Sweeper succeeded in crashing iBio's share price bringing on lawsuits from greedy lawyers who
are too happy to take the case (well plaintiffs never see more than a few pennies on a dollar even if they win and
lawyers take all). Many cite the article to support their case, gee don't lawyers do their own investigation anymore?
(kudos The Street Sweeper pun intended). Wonder why bloggers blog and folks write and expound their opinions
(clearly to serve their own objectives). I would encourage everyone to read this well written article (on D&O Diary by
