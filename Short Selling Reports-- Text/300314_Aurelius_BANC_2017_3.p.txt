BANC: Whistleblower
Revelations, Bad Loans, And
Undisclosed Related Party
Transactions


JANUARY 26, 2017 | BANC


Summary


In this research report, we focus on the single most important issue
at present: Has widespread fraud infected the Banc of California?


We were contacted by a whistleblower with a deep
knowledge of Jason Galanis’ business dealings with the
Sugarmans. We learned how Jason Galanis’ ownership in
regulated companies alongside both Steven Sugarman and
Lead Independent Director Brownstein was concealed from
the SEC, FINRA, and investors.


The whistleblower alleged that BANC has engaged in
mortgage fraud by hiding bad loans in “mortgage pools”.


BANC has acquired over $1.7B in mortgage pools tied to
disreputable parties with a history of robo-signing and
mortgage fraud. Aggressive assumptions produced
accounting pro�ts that represent 60% of cumulative pre-tax
income since 2013.


The credit quality of the mortgage loan pools is deteriorating
and displays deed record irregularities. BANC marks these
loans at a signi�cant premium from where industry experts
would expect them to trade.


Deed records show BANC sold mortgages that “didn’t meet
its investment standards” to an undisclosed off-balance

sheet entity controlled by insiders. The mortgages then
became securitized alongside other loans in a process that
suggest it was designed to hide bad mortgages.


BANC’s opaque securities portfolio increased by $2 Billion
during the same timeframe as the undisclosed transactions
with the related parties ramped up. If BANC is buying
securities comprised of its bad loans, we believe BANC’s
balance sheet is at signi�cant risk.


BANC’s industry-low tangible common equity ratio and loan
reserves leave no room for fraud, material losses, or
accounting shenanigans.

Background:
7/10/2019 BANC: Whistleblower Revelations, Bad Loans, And Undisclosed Related Party Transactions - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 3/18


On October 18, 2016 we published a research report which revealed
extensive and indisputable ties between Jason Galanis and Banc of
California’s (NYSE:BANC) senior-most offers, board members, and
founding shareholder . We warned investors of the similarities
between BANC and Gerova Financial (OTC:GVFG), a giant NYSE
fraud that left investors with nearly total losses.


Soon after our report, the company hired Gerova’s former PR �rm
and threatened us in a retraction demand that declared a purportedly
independent investigation into these issues had already vindicated
the company. After we issued another report revealing that the
independent investigation was conducted by Steven Sugarman’s
personal defense attorney, BANC delayed its 10-Q �ling and
announced a new internal investigation.


Earlier this week, the company announced the receipt of subpoenas
pursuant to a formal SEC investigative order, disclosed that its
auditor, KPMG, raised concerns in a letter to BANC, and that
Chairman & CEO Steven Sugarman had resigned. Finally, BANC
admitted that a previous 8-K “contained inaccurate statements.”


A Whistleblower Emerges


Several weeks ago, a whistleblower contacted us with detailed
information regarding the dealings between Jason Galanis and the
Sugarmans as well as allegations of fraudulent activity at BANC. The
whistleblower supplied documentation revealing that Jason Galanis
held a large equity stake in Steven Sugarman’s COR Securities
Holdings (a subsidiary of COR Capital). Thus, all of the bank’s
transactions with the COR Companies could potentially have been
for the bene�t of Galanis alongside Steven Sugarman.


The whistleblower states that the transactions were made pursuant
to a longstanding partnership between the Sugarmans and Galanis
that were purposefully designed to conceal Galanis’ ownership and
involvement in regulated companies from the SEC, FINRA, and the
investing public.


We believe that the Board has not come clean regarding Galanis
because of the risk that the FDIC might interpret this as a violation of

the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (which prohibits felons from
having either direct or indirect ownership or control). The act states
that a knowing violation could result in a �nes of up to $1 million
dollars a day (an amount now above $1 Billion which would obviously
render the bank insolvent).


But we also think the Board may be concerned about their own
potential liabilities in light of the now formal SEC investigative order.
The whistleblower described how Galanis pledged shares he
secretly held in Prospect Global, a public company co-founded and
closely associated with BANC’s Lead “Independent” Director Chad
Brownstein, to �nance his equity investment in COR. The
whistleblower states that the existence of this transaction was
concealed from the SEC. (Please see the appendix for a more
detailed discussion of this transaction, including the forensic steps
we took to independently support its existence.)


The most important question now is: Has widespread fraud infected
Banc of California?


The whistleblower informed us that Banc of California has engaged
in mortgage fraud by hiding bad loans in “mortgage pools.”


To support the allegations, we performed an extensive analysis of
deed records across the country. We discovered a series of
undisclosed related party mortgage transfers between Banc of
California and entities controlled by a BANC subsidiary. After
discussions with industry experts, we have identi�ed what we
consider to be a number of red �ags within the transactions.


These transactions, in our opinion, are extremely troubling and act
to signi�cantly increase the fraud risk pro�le of the Banc of
California.


(Note: The whistleblower is not an insider of Banc of California and
owes no duty to the bank. We believe the whistleblower was in a
position to have knowledge of the information he provided, which we
believe to be accurate. However, we have chosen to omit certain
allegations which we cannot yet support.)

The Palisades Group


The Palisades Group (“Palisades”) is a registered investment advisor
that manages residential loan portfolios. The �rm was ostensibly
founded in 2012 by former Carrington Capital executives, but the
whistleblower informed us that it was created with a strong
interconnectedness with Steven Sugarman’s COR Companies.
Palisades hired a longtime COR employee and even operated inside
an o�ce leased by COR Securities Holdings, a company that we now
know was partially owned by Jason Galanis. Banc of California
closed its acquisition of Palisades in September 2013 before its
abrupt divestiture in early 2016.


BANC’s “disinterested directors” approved a series of related party
transactions with Palisades including reimbursement payments to
COR Securities Holdings, which may have bene�ted Jason Galanis.
Jason Sugarman was hired as a key Palisades consultant for his real
estate expertise, and subsequently earned over $1.3 million in
bonuses. We previously exposed Jason Sugarman’s ties to
Westmoore, a real estate ponzi scheme.


Banc Of California’s Poorly Understood Earnings Addiction To Gains
from Subprime Loan Pool Acquisitions.


Few investors recognize the degree to which Banc of California’s
earnings depend on the acquisition of large pools of single family
loans. Between 2012 and 2015, BANC acquired over $1.7 Billion in
unpaid principal balance of seasoned mortgages. Roughly 70%
percent of these pools consisted of Purchase Credit Impaired
(NYSE:PCI) mortgages or those that have evidence of credit
deterioration after origination.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 6/18


There was a signi�cant opportunity for investors in this business
following the �nancial crisis because banks were forced to o�oad
billions in distressed mortgages. Since these mortgages could
oftentimes be acquired at attractive prices, these deals proved
pro�table for many investors.


The beauty of the accounting treatment for PCI loans (from the
perspective of public companies) is that it relies heavily on the
judgment of management. By making optimistic future cash �ow
assumptions, management is able to signi�cantly increase the
accounting pro�ts from the loan pools. Please see Appendix B for a
more detailed accounting discussion, including how an implied 2013
change in BANC’s accounting policies began accelerating the
recognition of managements estimated PCI gains.


Since the implied accounting change, Banc of California’s earnings
have become increasingly dependent on management’s estimated
gains from the PCI loan pools. Despite representing just 12% of the
bank’s total loan portfolio, we calculate that the bank has earned
over $130 million from PCI loans since 2013. This equates to an
astounding 60% of the bank’s cumulative pre-tax income earned over
the same period!


Based on our conversations with industry experts, an improving
housing market has eradicated the PCI bargains that proved so
pro�table for investors during the �nancial crisis. This makes us

wonder how Banc of California, magically, has continued to earn
large (and increasing) returns from this business.


While this earnings stream is clearly unsustainable, our research
shows that Banc of Calfornia’s outsized accounting pro�ts may have
been enhanced through undisclosed related party transactions.


Banc Of California Has Purchased Loan Pools Tied To Disreputable
Parties


We began to search through deed records across the country in an
effort to understand the loan-level economics and ownership
histories of the mortgages.


We discovered that BANC has acquired large loan pools tied to,
among others, a mortgage investment �rm named Arch Bay Capital.
Based on our review of the deed records, we believe the Arch Bay
mortgages comprised a signi�cant percentage of BANC’s $1 Billion
seasoned loan acquisitions in 2013. The loans were acquired just
months after Arch Bay was shuttered after its private equity backer
stormed its o�ce and seized employee laptops. We note that several
current key Palisades Group executives and portfolio managers held
similar roles at Arch Bay.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 8/18


(Source: Public Deed Records)


Loans purchased by BANC have been attached to robo-signing
scandals. The individual named in the upper left of the above
document is a notorious robo-signer. Industry experts explain that
this is highly problematic because repairing title impairments can be
extremely expensive for a bank to resolve.


Furthermore, many of BANC’s purchased loans were originated by
fraudulent lenders. These include NovaStar Mortgage (also above), a
fraudulent mortgage originator that resulted in a Harvard Business
School Case Study (describing how famed short seller, Marc
Cohodes, exposed the fraud).


Industry experts we spoke with indicated that loans pools of similar
quality would be expected to trade at anywhere between 25% to 55%
of unpaid principal. However, Banc of California currently marks its
PCI loans at 92% of unpaid principal. While we realize that the
housing market has recovered, we question the accounting
assumptions made by Steven Sugarman and his associates. We also
note that six �nancial o�cers have departed BANC since current
management took over.


Bad Loans Have Been Sold To An Off Balance Sheet Entity Managed
By Related Parties.


According to BANC’s SEC �lings, it has consistently sold loans from
its seasoned SFR pools that “did not meet the Company’s investment
standards.” In aggregate, BANC has sold loans with $529 million of
unpaid principal balance or 30% of its cumulative acquisitions. From
these sales it has booked cumulative gain on sale income of $30
million. These gains, in turn, have been used to give credence to the
quality of the company’s PCI loan valuations.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 9/18


We believe investors consider these sales to be arms length
transactions, however, We have learned that BANC sold mortgages
to undisclosed related parties. Deed records across the country
show hundreds of loans being transferred from Banc of California to
an entity named Palisades Mortgage Acquisition Company, LLC
(“PMAC”).


(Source: Public Deed Records)


Beginning one month after BANC acquired Palisades, it began
transferring loans to Palisades Mortgage Acquisition Company
(“PMAC”). According to SEC Filings, PMAC is the conduit for
a�liated Palisades Mortgage Loan Trusts (discussed below).
Neither the existence of PMAC or its trusts have ever been disclosed
by BANC, yet we have evidence that these entities were controlled by
related parties.


Documents from the deed records show that PMAC mortgage
transfers have been signed by Palisades co-founder, Jack
Macdowell, as Co-President of PMAC. These transfers were made
when BANC still owned Palisades, making this executive a related
party of Banc of California at the time.


We also believe that PMAC is an off balance sheet entity. BANC’s
�lings named the Palisades Group, LLC as its (now former)
subsidiary. Characterized as an asset-light RIA, The Palisades Group
was credited with only $2.9M in assets. The fact that deed records

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 10/18


attribute tens of millions of loans to PMAC renders it impossible for
PMAC to have been consolidated. We also note that PMAC
maintains a separate Darien, Connecticut address and notably, has
not �led as a foreign LLC in California (as it presumably otherwise
would).


These facts are problematic for Banc of California because it creates
the impression that these entities were designed to hide bad
mortgages. Thus, BANC’s reported gains from the sale of PCI loans
may actually re�ect sales of bad loans to an off balance sheet entity
controlled by related parties.


The Loans Have Been Securitized Inside Undisclosed Mortgage
Trusts.


After gestating inside PMAC for a period of time, the loans are
transferred to Palisades Mortgage Loan Trusts (PMLTs). Documents
show that the PMLTs are tied to Banc of California’s headquarters
building and controlled by related parties. We therefore believe the
PMLT’s are private mortgage-backed securities created and issued
by PMAC.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 11/18


Deed records show that the trusts have also purchased large
quantities of loans from other institutions, introducing the possibility
that bad Banc of California loans are being concealed by being
mixed into more diverse loan pools. As the whistleblower analogized,
“it is easier to hide $1 Million dollars in bad loans in $100 Million
than $10 Million.” Industry experts explained that these kind of
nefarious maneuvers would be very di�cult for regulators to detect.


Deed Records Reveal Numerous Irregularities


Our review of the deed histories for the mortgages obtained by
BANC show a number of irregularities. For example, the table below
details the ownership history of a mortgage from Palm Beach
County Florida. It shows the mortgage starting in an Arch Bay Capital
trust and ending up in Palisades Mortgage Loan Trust, Series 2015-1.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 12/18


(Note: Paci�c Trust Bank was Banc of California’s prior primary bank
subsidiary).


We found hundreds of transactions with the same or slightly varying
patterns:


Multiple transactions occurring months apart are recorded
on the same day, often times months after the transactions
occurred.


PMAC holds the loans for an extended period of time,
sometimes over a year, before transferring to the trusts.
Generally, the securitization process occurs shortly after the
issuer acquires the loans.


The mortgages are �ipped between the PMLT’s, generally
staying for a few months or less.


Deed records show mortgages being transferred out of the
PMLT’s months before they were legally owned by the trusts.


A signi�cant percentage of loans required the modi�cation of
previous loan transfers, a clear sign the loan was subject to
robo-signing mortgage fraud.


The industry experts we spoke with expressed signi�cant concerns
about this fact pattern, with one expert stating that “the activity is
highly irregular, even for the non-performing loan market.”


The largest outstanding question is: who is �nancing the PMLTs?


BANC Holdings of Opaque Securities


BANC’s securities portfolio has increased by $2 Billion during the
same timeframe as the transactions with Palisades have ramped up.
7/10/2019 BANC: Whistleblower Revelations, Bad Loans, And Undisclosed Related Party Transactions - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-whistleblower-revelations-bad-loans-undisclosed-related-party-transactions/ 13/18


If these securities are related to the loan pools that have been
securitized, we believe BANC’s balance sheet is at signi�cant risk.


BANC of California’s portfolio includes over $1.3 Billion worth of level
2 assets (described as “structured products” in call reports) that
have been subject to only sparse disclosure and subject to
management’s valuation models. This leaves BANC investors
holding a portfolio of non-transparent securities that far exceeds the
bank’s $650 million in tangible equity.


One thing that really stands out to us is the extreme turnover of the
securities portfolio. In the �rst six months of 2016, BANC sold $3.5B
and purchased $3.9B in available-for-sale securities–On an average
balance of $1.4B. To us, BANC appears to be trading its securities
book more like a hedge fund than a bank.


The securities also have abnormally low yields, at less than 2.75%. It
seems nonsensical for the bank to be selling its higher-yielding
internally originated loans and using the proceeds to invest in lower-
yielding collateralized debt securities.


When asked by an analyst from another �rm, Steven Sugarman
reportedly declined to provide any explanatory detail regarding the
bank’s securities portfolio. A call our attorney placed with the bank to
request comment was not returned.


We Have Serious Concerns About The Bank’s Balance Sheet And
Equity Capital.


The red �ags in BANC’s securities book underpin our broader worries
about its balance sheet and capital position. Simply put, this is a
bank with a negligible margin of safety to absorb losses from either
fraud or bad loans (much less pay $100 million over coming years to
name the Sugarman’s Soccer Stadium).


BANC has a set aside substantially lower loan loss provisions than
peers and its Tangible Common Equity Ratio (which we believe to be
the most relevant for equity market investors) is only 5.8% versus
9.5% for peers. Said another way, to protect common equity holders

in a manner in line with its peers, it would have to raise $400 million
in fresh equity.


(Source: Internal Analysis)


Meanwhile, non-performing PCI loans have started to increase
signi�cantly after more than doubling in 2015. The bank’s 10K
partially attributed the increase to temporary “confusion of
borrowers” resulting from a loan servicing change. But the
delinquencies increased by another 40% through June, 2016 and
now represent $57 million of the $751 million in total PCI loans. Due
to PCI accounting treatment, BANC has set aside only $100k in this
portfolio.


Appendix A: Galanis Transaction


The whistleblower alleged that the Sugarmans had a longstanding
partnership with Galanis that extended across a variety of regulated
business concerns including offshore insurance companies, asset
managers, and investment banking concerns.


In 2011, one year after the COR Companies led the initial
FirstPactrust recapitalization, Steven Sugarman formed COR
Securities Holdings to acquire Legent Clearing (now COR Clearing).
The whistleblower explains that a deal was struck with Jason
Galanis whereby Weston Capital (an entity controlled by Jason
Galanis via Fund.com) would provide equity to be used as regulatory

capital to acqure Legent. However, Weston’s principal, Albert Hallac,
used the capital on other ventures (Weston & Hallac were
subsequently charged by the SEC with fraud).


With the Weston transaction no longer viable, the whistleblower
described how Sugarman and Galanis agreed that Galanis would
contribute 3 million shares he secretly held in Prospect Global. We
note that Prospect Global is a now-imploded OTC potash company
co-founded and Vice-Chaired by BANC’s lead independent Director,
Chad Brownstein. According to the whistleblower, the transaction
was drafted by Steven Sugarman and designed to conceal Galanis’
involvement from the SEC, FINRA, and other COR investors.


Documents show that Galanis transferred the shares through his
Thorsdale Trust entity to Sugarman & COR in exchange for a
preferred interest (convertible into the equity). The complex
transaction involved several of the numerous COR entities including,
COR Investments II, LLC.


We were able to support the existence of this transaction through a
forensic examination of SEC �lings. We learned that Galanis secretly
held his Prospect Global shares under the name of “Balkan Hellenic

Hellenic held 4.1 million shares and tellingly, Balkan’s 13 �ling
contained no signature. After the Galanis/Sugarman transaction,
Balkan’s ownership interest disappeared.

Then magically, subsequent �lings disclose that Sugarman’s COR
companies owned 4.1 million shares of Prospect Global (and
Sugarman’s 13D �ling offers no explanation as to the origin of the
shares). While only 3 million shares were pledged for the transaction,
we speculate that Galanis’ other 1.1 million shares were pledged to
the other COR entities under some other arrangement.


This further explains why Steven Sugarman began to publicly pump
Prospect Global, declaring in 2013 that:


“We think Prospect Global is the best potash investment opportunity
in North America”


By the end of 2014, shares would be nearly worthless.


The whistleblower stated that the transaction, which was speci�cally
designed to be concealed from regulators, was made with the full
knowledge of Mr. Brownstein. Our �rst report already established
that Chad Brownstein was one of only four shareholders of

Appendix B: PCI Accounting Discussion


Accounting for PCI loans falls under FAS ASC 310-30. Unlike non-
credit impaired loans, which recognize income based on contractual
cash �ows, PCI loans recognize income based on expected cash
�ows. When PCI loans are acquired they are recorded at fair value
(i.e. the purchase price) and no allowance for potential losses is
recorded. Write-downs are not recorded unless impairments fall
below management’s expected cash �ow.


Instead of earnings cash interest as the loan is paid down, interest is
earned on the difference between expected cash �ows and fair value
over the expected maturity of the loan pool (called Discount Yield
Accretion).


Because expected cash �ows and maturities are determined by
management and can be changed quarterly, management is able to
use optimistic assumptions to signi�cantly increase the accounting
pro�ts from the loan pools. And BANC’s accounting for its PCI loans
appears to have loosened over the years.


In 2012, BANC �lings stated that the company did not recognize
Discount Yield Accretion income until the loan was paid off or “on a
case-by-case basis when a material event that signi�cantly improves
the quality of the loans.” This language disappeared in 2013 when
BANC’s PCI loan purchases ballooned from $114M to $473M.
