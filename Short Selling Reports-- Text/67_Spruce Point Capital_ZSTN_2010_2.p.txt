ZST Digital Networks' Q3 Raises More Questions Than Answers
Dec. 2, 2010 6:23 PM ET10 comments
by: Ben Axler


Last month ZST Digital Networks (NASDAQ:ZSTN) reported its Q3 results. Yet again, the
company reported glowing results, indicating that total revenue for the period was $38.5
million, an increase of 34.6% compared to Q3 ’09, and net income grew to $6.4 million, an
increase of 94.7% compared to Q3 ’09.


As discussed in our previous analysis of ZSTN, we prefer to look at the balance sheet and
cash flow statement to assess the real quality of this business. After a closer examination
of this quarter’s results, we continue to have concerns and a cautionary stance on this
company’s operations.


The Curious Case of Quarterly Cash Flow


According to CFO John Chen:


“We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash
equivalents increasing significantly over the previous quarter as a result of an
influx of collections from products and services delivered earlier in the year, in
line with our normal cash collection cycle.”


Upon closer examination of this statement, we find some inconsistencies that beg further
investigation. To illustrate, as of Sept. 30, 2010, total accounts receivables were $27.5
million, a very modest decrease of only 4.9% from $28.9 million as of June 30, 2010.
However, accounts receivable are still higher by $2.6 million or 10% from the beginning of
the year.


So how did cash increase significantly as the company has indicated? To answer this
question precisely, we have to take a closer look into the cash generated from operations,
which entails looking into changes in the working capital accounts (current assets, and
liabilities).

The Curious Case of Advances to Suppliers


We will focus our attention on the items shaded in gray as areas of interest. As can be
seen from the table, the company’s largest source of cash this year has been from a
sudden reversal last quarter in the account called “Advances to Suppliers.” So what
exactly is this line item? According to the company’s recently filed 10Q in Note 4:


“In accordance with the purchase contracts, ZST PRC is required to make
advance payments to its suppliers to purchase the IPTV and GPS devices,
materials and add-on process work. The advances are applied to the total
invoice balance upon satisfaction of the goods received by ZST PRC. For the
year ended December 31, 2009, advances of $7,399,141 represents advances
mainly made to two suppliers accounting for 55% and 45%, respectively. As of
September 30, 2010, there were no prepayments made to suppliers due to the
Chinese National Holiday. Prepayments were made after the holiday ended on
October 7, 2010.”


Other disclosures in the company’s 10-K include the following language:


“We typically need to place certain deposits and advances with our suppliers
on a portion of the purchase price in advance and for some suppliers we must
maintain a deposit for future orders.”


Given the magnitude of this advance and sudden reversal this quarter, we would have
expected a more detailed discussion from the company about this change. After all, this
one account change represents almost 35% of the cash from operations for the entire
year. Unfortunately, due to lack of disclosure by the company on this issue, we are left

https://seekingalpha.com/article/239814-zst-digital-networks-q3-raises-more-questions-than-answers 3/9


with more questions than answers. If, as described, the advances are to be applied to
invoices when goods are received, then why is the company receiving the money back?
Does this reversal indicate problems and/or troubles with its two main suppliers? Has the
company lost major customers, and no longer needing to receive supplies for future
orders, and thus receiving its advances/deposits back? Also, why does the reported YTD
cash inflow of $7,249,152 differ from our calculated amount of $7,399,141? It’s easy
enough to verify by looking at the 12/31/09 Advances to Supplier account. It appears to be
sloppiness on the part of the company, which can’t even get its own numbers correct,
across almost all reported amounts. This casts further doubt on the reliability of this
company’s financials.

The Curious Case of ZSTN’s Magically Shrinking Inventory


Perhaps the answer to the foregoing discussion of the Advances to Suppliers account is
better understood by looking at inventories. ZSTN’s inventories continue to fall at an
alarming rate. Yet again, they’ve decreased from $502k last quarter, to a mere $202k this
quarter. If we are correct that the company is having problems with its suppliers, then it
would make sense that it cannot build new inventories. After all, a company growing as
fast as ZSTN surely must build some inventories to sustain all of its superior growth in
sales and earnings that it is reporting to investors. However, ZSTN grew revenues by $5m
from $33m in 2Q’10 to $38m in 3Q’10, while inventories fell by $300k. At this rate, ZSTN
will deplete all inventories and be the only distributor in the world that we are aware of to
grow sales without holding a single dollar of inventory.


According to the company’s 10-K Risk Factors

“Cancellations or reductions of customer orders could result in the loss of
anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and
operating expenses. Furthermore, because we depend on a small number of
customers for the vast majority of our sales, the magnitude of the ramifications
of these risks is greater than if our sales were less concentrated with a small
number of customers. As a result of our lack of long-term purchase orders and
purchase commitments we may experience a rapid decline in our sales and
profitability.”


ZSTN’s decision to wind down and not restock its inventories may signal its expectation of
losses of customers. We are very wary of the trend of declining inventories, and think it’s a
potential indication of problems the company is either currently facing or expects to face in
the near future.


The Curious Case of ZSTN’s Accounts Payable


Our interest also was piqued when ZSTN reported this quarter that its accounts payable
balance was a mere $2,650. Curiously, this is the exact same amount the company
reported the prior quarter at 6/30/10. In other words, ZSTN did not incur a single dollar of
incremental amounts payable in three months of operations, all while reporting growing
sales and earnings. How is this possible? We don’t have an answer to this question, but
we certainly welcome an explanation from the company.


The Curious Case of ZSTN’s $1 Million Share Repurchase Program


Another curious matter is the company’s announcement on Aug. 24, 2010, of an initiation
of a $1 million share repurchase program.


In a press release, the chairman was quoted as saying:
5/22/2018 ZST Digital Networks' Q3 Raises More Questions Than Answers - ZST Digital Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZSTN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/239814-zst-digital-networks-q3-raises-more-questions-than-answers 5/9


"The Board's authorization of the share repurchase program reflects our
confidence in the favorable growth outlook for ZST. As we enter the second
half of 2010, the demand for our products and services remains robust,
supported by the continued expansion of our end markets. In addition, our
strong second quarter 2010 results and the rapid development of our
commercial GPS products give us confidence in the long-term growth
prospects of our business. As such, we believe that current share price levels
do not fully reflect the fundamental strength of our business and outlook. We
remain committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value, and believe that
our stable financial position and healthy balance sheet will allow us to execute
a share repurchase program while continuing to invest in our business.”


On the day of this announcement, ZSTN’s share price closed at $6.26 per share, not far
from its 52-week low of $4.43 per share. Given the foregoing announcement that ZSTN
believed its share price was cheap, investors would naturally believe the company would
be actively buying it at the current price. However, as we recently learned this quarter, the
company’s actions speak louder than its words. According to the company's quarterly
statement of cash flows, we find no indication of any share repurchases in the past nine
months, which are typically contained in the cash flows from financing section of the
statement. While we acknowledge that the announcement of share repurchase program
does not legally bind the company to take action, we are clearly disappointed ZSTN could
not commit to buying 1 single share at prices it acknowledged didn’t accurately reflect their
value.

Conclusion: Still More Questions Than Answers


We have illustrated more than a few unusual developments with ZSTN’s quarterly report
that exacerbates our concerns with the company’s financials and business prospects. We
continue to have grave concerns with the company’s balance sheet and cash flow
changes that could signal big problems in the quarters to come. Unfortunately, the
company does not disclose enough information to investors to accurately assess these
impacts on its future prospects. As a result, we stand by our previous conclusions that
ZSTN’s business remains deceptive and not an investment worth making.


Disclosure: Short ZSTN.

You are not wary of the inventory issue or any other thing, you are only wary about your short position dude! The
company does explain a lot of things just not to shorts. lol


When I read this new piece it certainly shows me again that you really can't read a balance sheet so you might be
better of in a different industry.

You should write fairy tales, it all sounds so imaginative. Seriously, how do you think this months piece will even make
a dent in share price when your last month's effort was a big FAIL. You should go work for the guy who just caused
the entire Shanghai market to drop 5 percent in one day based on his email recommendations to investors, you might
learn something.

Quoted in article posted Dec. 2, 2010 by Glen Bradford: 
"ZST Digital Networks (ZSTN) has a lot of cash and is cheap by my calculations."


Glen Bradford is the CEO of ARM Holdings LLC as well as the VP of China Growth Partners.


Well, there you have it. Now, if you're like me -- you'll find yourself putting your money where your mouth is. Or, you
could be like everyone else and talk about the great things you could have done. The choice is yours. Please excuse
me while I get back to making a fortune, but before I leave I want to tell you what I would do if I had a billion dollars.


I'd take half of it, and buy up entire companies at these multiples, roll them up into a billion dollar conglomerate and
take them public on the Hang Seng / Shanghai and make something like xxx% on that half billion. I'd use the other
half a billion to scoop up private placements at the same multiples. I figure I could turn $1 billion into much more -- the
trick is being large enough to be able to buy entire companies and then piecing together a conglomerate to take public
overseas.


Disclosure: Glen and his investors hold long positions in all the companies mentioned and he takes pride in putting his
money where his mouth is.


He puts his money where his mouth is and is CEO of ARM Holdings and VP of China Growth Partners. Whats not to
like???

If investors like wood looks like CUT has outperformed Spruce Capital for some time. Little wonder if this is an
example of your decision making. Of course ZSTN has outperformed both and will continue to do so.

ZSTN has successfully solved the problem about customer's accounts receivables. While their accounts receivables
have decreased, their cash position has increased substantially. 
This offsets any need for ZST to borrow from the Chinese banks which are tightening their belts to independent
businesses. 
This allows ZSTN to weather the bank storm while other companies cannot grow their business due to lack of
borrowing from banks. 
ZSTN has obviously decreased their accounts payable position due to their high cash on hand. Since they have a
position of minor expenses this allows ZSTN to invest in their own operations increasing their inventories or making
other expenditures as need fits for them whenever the time is right. Smart to have alot of cash on hand to use when
you need it rather than try to borrow from the Chinese banks which are not freely lending. This gives ZSTN the upper
hand in their sector above all other companies.  
Yes its hard to believe a company can tighten their belts, reduce accounts payables, increase cash, not reply on
banks for high growth, wait for the right time to invest in themselves and other opportunities. Only the best of the best,
the cream of the crop.

Here is a post off the Ihub Value Microcaps Message Board...


What he doesn't want to point out is that in Q3 there were a lot of positives:


a) Sales: +35% y/y  
b) GM increased substantially, 26% v 16.9% y/y.  
c) Pretax margins increased substantially, 23.1% v 15.4% y/y.  
d) DSOs were down to 65 days vs 80 days in Q2 FY10. That shows the company did a better job of collecting its A/R.  
3) TTM fd eps is now 1.47, or < 5x earnings.  
4) The company has forecast a strong Q4 for fd eps, continuing its trend of higher margin sales growth. Using the
midline of guidance, fd eps should be 1.76.....implying a forward PE of 4x.  
5) OCF was very strong, primarily due to net income growth, better A/R collections and yes, advances to suppliers
dropping to zero.


As noted in the financials, this was largely due to the timing of holidays:


NOTE 4 – ADVANCE TO SUPPLIERS


In accordance with the purchase contracts, ZST PRC is required to make advance payments to its suppliers to
purchase the IPTV and GPS devices, materials and add-on process work. The advances are applied to the total
invoice balance upon satisfaction of the goods received by ZST PRC.


For the year ended December 31, 2009, advances of $7,399,141 represents advances mainly made to two suppliers
accounting for 55% and 45%, respectively. As of September 30, 2010, there were no prepayments made to suppliers
due to the Chinese National Holiday. Prepayments were made after the holiday ended on October 7, 2010.


-------------------


What is the issue here? It seems as if the author won't give the company any credit for its high margin sales which
have driven stronger than expected net income, nor will he acknowledge that they did a good job of A/R collections
either.


Inventories are very low because the company outsources all its production and there is a fairly quick turnaround time
to build its products according to customer orders.


With the trailing and forward PE at such low levels, I would argue that the downside risk is pretty low, absent a true
case of fraud. If you listened to the last CC, the sales of its GPS devices are going well and they have some large
bids out that may provide meaningful revenue growth in FY11. If they announce a contract win, I think this fund that is
short will be forced to cover.....


FWIW, there was an insider purchase filed today as well. The CEO bought a modest 6k shares @ 7.37 on Nov 19, to
add to his 4.5MM total.

ZSTN has been falsely accused several times of fraudulent activities and this article like the others are unfounded
conjecture at best. How come none of the authors are long ZSTN? They write inaccurate and unresearched articles to
benefit their own short positions and cause irreversible damage to those companies they target. Shame on Ben and
others like him. He should be banned and prevented from publishing unproven articles.

trouble.
