Clearsign's Lies, Omissions, And One 'Bad Actor'
Feb. 7, 2013 9:11 AM ET58 comments
by: Matt Berry


Clearsign Combustion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLIR) "appears to be one of the first, if not
the first, in the nation to make use of the new JOBS Act." (The Seattle Times) Perhaps
this is only an ironic coincidence, but it's a shame that this new program had to start off
this way: Clearsign has no credible inventors to account for its "revolutionary" technology,
and that's why I believe that the Clearsign story has suffered a critical failure.


A recent attempt at a rebuttal to my earlier article has either omitted or neglected key
facts. Further evidence supports the key problem with Clearsign:


Without a doubt someone in Clearsign has lied about the business and science
experience of the Chief Science Officer ‒ the so-called "original inventor" of its
technology. Without the inventor, what claim does Clearsign have for a "revolutionary"
technology?
Material information has been withheld from Clearsign investors: the co-inventor on
Clearsign's "pending patent" found his name attached to a transparent technology
scam. A recent attempt at a rebuttal to this exposure has misrepresented the facts.


Additional evidence that I have gathered presents other problems:


Clearsign inked an agreement with John McFarland for Investor Relations work.
McFarland was permanently barred from the securities industry.
CEO Rutkowski and McFarland are both co-members of a separate investor relations
company which was formed this last June, just after McFarland got more than $50,000
worth of Clearsign shares and which was above and beyond the original agreement. I
have found no disclosures of this in Clearsign's filings.
MDB Capital Group underwrote Clearsign's IPO, whose S-1 contains false and
misleading statements.
MDB Capital Group professes expertise with patents and claims to have done due
diligence on Clearsign … yet Clearsign's original inventor faked patents. How could
MDB not know this?
MDB Capital Group claims to have helped Clearsign with investor relations during the
same time period that Clearsign's banned investor relations agent was active. FINRA
members such as MDB Capital Group are prohibited from having any association with
barred members such as John McFarland.

(Unless otherwise provided, source material for the above and following can be found in
the two slide shows, ClearSign's False and Misleading statements about David Goodson
and ClearSign's Omission of Material Fact Regarding Thomas Hartwick. A larger report is
also available. For more detail, please see my blog here.)


David B. Goodson


In a rebuttal to my article, Benjamin Padnos attempted to minimize the lies told in
Clearsign's S-1 filing and prospectus:


I will say that in my research, I did find there may have been some exaggerations in
David Goodson's biography in ClearSign's S-1 filing, as well as outright errors such
as wrong numbers of specific patents he holds with the U.S. Patent & Trademark
Organization (USPTO). I hate sloppiness, and don't have any inclination to excuse it
in this instance. But this minor bit of sloppiness alone is not enough to discard the
Company's fundamental story.


~ Seeking Alpha contributor Benjamin Padnos


But it is not just "sloppy." Someone has clearly lied in the S-1 Registration Statement - and
in a very serious way. With more research one finds that the problems with Clearsign's
original inventor and Chief Science Officer are not just with the false claim of having
collaborated with Nobel Prize winners, nor with the false patent claims, but with almost
every claim of having commercialized a technology. In fact, uncovering the history of
Goodson's "electric field" technologies reveals a disturbing pattern of deceit - both to
investors then and to investors now.


It matters because David B. Goodson is said to be the "original inventor" of Clearsign's
technology: ECC. He is also listed as an inventor on Clearsign's pending patents ‒ he's a
co-founder of the company, the largest shareholder, and a director. Here is a summary of
false, misleading and highly improbable claims made in the prospectus and S-1
Registration Statement.

Dr. Thomas Hartwick


Thomas Hartwick is the top-listed Technical Advisor for Clearsign's technology. He is also
listed on Clearsign's pending patents as co-inventor. But Hartwick was also the technical
advisor for John Rivera's technology scam at Sustainable Power Corp. John Rivera was
convicted of fraud, and central to the SEC's case were the false claims about his
technology ‒ the same technology that Hartwick was tasked with summarizing for
investors.

Seeking Alpha contributor Benjamin Padnos quotes Hartwick, telling us that Hartwick and
Rivera were not contemporaries. Hartwick supposedly even says that SSTP's technology
worked better than Rivera had claimed.


In Dr. Harwick's own words:


Regarding SSTP, Berry's assertions are totally incorrect. Rivera, the former CEO,
was thrown out by the good guy directors who wished to rehabilitate the company.
First, they had to find out if the technology was worth saving. So they got a contract
with Texas A&M to measure and characterize the conversion process and got me as
referee/advisor to critique the A&M results and comment on the business viability.
Surprise! The basic technology was even better than the Rivera claims, but the
company was too far gone with the lawsuits to recover. I never received my full
compensation. I was on the team opposing Rivera, not supporting him. He was
thrown off the board in Spring of 2009 before I even signed up to scrutinize the
manufacturing process in October. Any contention that I was in league with Rivera is
hardly credible...never even met the man. All of this is fully documented and
available for scrutiny.


~ Seeking Alpha contributor Benjamin Padnos


My Response: First, Rivera was running a technology scam, and Hartwick was there to
summarize the report on Rivera's technology for investors. It wouldn't matter if Rivera
were there or not.


Second, Rivera was indeed active in the winter of 2009 and beyond. He was the largest
shareholder of SSTP and his involvement was contemporary with Hartwick's involvement.
We have a very good inside-view of this technology scam, because at the precise time of
Hartwick's involvement, the SEC case against Rivera was ongoing. We have depositions
and exhibits that we can download from PACER.GOV. As for Rivera's involvement during
Hartwick's time, here are my two favorite pieces of evidence. These events take place
during and after Hartwick's name is used by SSTP.


1. The CEO sends an email to Rivera, conferring with him about a press release in which
Hartwick himself is featured.


2. Rivera grants voting rights by proxy to a newly appointed chairman. Then in a dispute
Rivera revokes that proxy and the now former chairman declares that he never really
had any power, but only took on additional liabilities. And the best part ‒ when he
resigns he feels it necessary to include Rivera in his notice.

These are events that occurred during and after Hartwick's presence. Needless to say,
Rivera was a de facto leader in this company.


Mr. Padnos investigates the "timeline" of Hartwick and Rivera's involvement, by asking
Hartwick. However, the evidence gathered from the court case presents a very different
perspective and perhaps explains why Hartwick was brought in at precisely this point in
time.


The SEC had requested an onsite examination of Rivera's technology. This was to be
performed by Tunstall Adams, Inc ‒ the SEC's expert witness in the federal case. Was this
a crisis point for those who knew that false claims were being made about the technology?
I ask because, the very next month, SSTP rushes out and signs an agreement with some
researchers from Texas A&M. They are to perform a research study of their own. Now
SSTP is in a race with the SEC.


Texas A&M finished its report in the fall of 2009. That's when Hartwick was brought in to
put together a "summary," to validate the technology, and to explain it to the layman. But it
wasn't your ordinary summary ‒ it was a kind of substitute report. See, the original Texas
A&M report was not shown to investors. It was declared "confidential." (Who would fall for
this?) What the investors received was a "summarized" version put together by SSTP's
science team, of which Hartwick was the head. Using Hartwick's name and prestigious
history, SSTP now declares that its technology has been validated and that it is preparing
the reactors for the commercial production of bio-fuel.


Then the SEC commissioned report comes out. It states very clearly that Rivera's
technology was not commercially viable.


[SSTP] "... got me as referee/advisor


to critique the A&M results and


comment on the business viability.


Surprise! The basic technology was


even better than Rivera claims." ~


Hartwick, according to Padnos.


"In conclusion, USSE/SSTP does not produce an approved


or certified liquid or gaseous fuel that is suitable for


commercial sale and use in reciprocating and combustion


turbine equipment." ~ SEC commissioned study which was


submitted as an exhibit in the case against John Rivera:


Case 5:08-cv-00245-DCB-JMR Document 61-28.


According to Padnos, Hartwick was quoted as saying that he was there to verify the
technology's business viability. Hartwick also said that the technology worked better than
Rivera claimed. But just when you think things couldn't get worse for the Hartwick story,

we find that the report by the SEC's expert witness included the very Texas A&M Report

CEO Richard Rutkowski


Clearsign's CEO, Richard Rutkowski, signed an agreement with John McFarland for
Investor Relations services. However, John McFarland had been permanently barred from
the securities industry by FINRA.


Here are some of the official documents that shed light on the situation:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163741-clearsigns-lies-omissions-and-one-bad-actor 9/30


It is very difficult to make the excuse that Rutkowski might not have known about
McFarland's past. Just this last June, Rutkowski and McFarland joined up and formed a
separate Investor Relations company called, Ormont LLC. This might cause some
problems.


First, I have not found a disclosure of Rutkowski's relationship with McFarland.
Second, there is a sudden increase in McFarland's compensation in April, above and
beyond what was outlined in Clearsign's agreement. McFarland was to receive 4,500
shares for March (and each quarter thereafter), but a later filing declares that he
received 18,000 shares for March and April. That's 13,500 shares on top of the
agreement. At $4 a share, that would be more than a $50,000 bonus. Then in June,
McFarland and Rutkowski suddenly show up on the original formation record for an
investor relations company. Given that starting a business takes some planning, how
many months before the June formation of Ormont did Rutkowski and McFarland
agree to become partners in an investor relations company? How close together was
this agreement and McFarland's increase in compensation?
Third, McFarland's regulatory penalty, in legal terms, is called a "statutory
disqualification" and with that there are certain exemptions that Clearsign and
McFarland may not qualify for. There are also business relationships that FINRA
members are not allowed to have. For example, MDB Capital said that it performed IR
and PR services for Clearsign, but how could they do that without teaming up with
Clearsign's investor relations' man ‒ John McFarland?


It would take a legal team and an inside look into McFarland's role with Clearsign, MDB
Capital, investors, and retail brokers to know the extent to which Clearsign and others
might be legally vulnerable.


I don't wish to make light of the preceding, but I have to say however that one of the first
red flags for me was just the simple fact that Rutkowski, with no apparent experience with
combustion science, listed himself as an inventor on the first expression of Clearsign's
technology. What was he thinking? ECC was supposed to be a "revolutionary technology."
What is his name doing there? As an investor relations man, he is perfectly aware of the
role that the words "Patent Pending" have in boosting a stock price. After listing his name
on the patent ‒ as an inventor ‒ why should we believe anything he has to say?


What's a little more than ironic is that MDB Capital professes expertise with patents, says
it has its own patent database and patent experts. MDB Capital Group also claims to have
done due diligence on Clearsign and to have advised it on IP strategy. Yet Clearsign's

original inventor faked patents. How could MDB both take its due diligence seriously and
not know this? A simple Google patent search was enough to expose the lie.


MDB Capital's analyst claimed, "No existing technology currently competes directly
against ECC." (MDB Capital: ClearSign Combustion Corporation Research Initiation) Yet
many inventors have already patented inventions which apply electric fields to flames.
More irony: Clearsign itself has a duty to supply a list of relevant patents to the USPTO as
part of its patent application. This form is called the "Information Disclosure Statement"
(IDS). Click here to see Clearsign's IDS and how the listed patents conflict with MDB
Capital's report (slide #5). In short, Clearsign's technology is not alone and these patent-
pros should know it.


Sometimes I wonder if Clearsign and MDB are just having a lot of fun at everyone else's
expense. Nonetheless, at its core, Clearsign is a fairly simple case. Clearsign has no
credible inventors to account for its technology. This critical failure in Clearsign's story has
yet to be addressed: how is it possible to have a technology without an inventor? I believe
that the Clearsign story has suffered a critical failure.

Matt, my rebuttal to your misguided analysis will come in the form of CLIR stock price over the next year or
so. You may be good at researching on Google and cobbling together PowerPoint presentations, but you're a
terrible stock picker. Seeking Alpha readers would be advised to review your "short" call on QIHU from mid-

Furthermore, Matt, it would be nice for you to disclose who is compensating you, as well as how much, for
your so-called "research." I've done my homework and have been able to identify the guys you're working
with. There's a full investigation under way, and our findings will be shared with several organizations who
frown on market manipulation.


Bottom line: You ought to be very careful making accusations of "scams" from that see-through glass house
of yours!

Author’s reply »  My research on Qihoo was and is correct. It has not only held up it was recently confirmed
just last week.


Interestingly, I exposed Qihoo’s fake Microsoft security patch last August. The SAIC has only now concluded
its investigation, and my reporting was validated. The fact that Qihoo’s stock price stayed up is in no way
"proof" that this Chinese Government agency’s (SAIC) report is incorrect. Facts are facts – Madoff’s investors
piling on, or Qihoo’s, don’t change them.


My article from last August: http://bit.ly/12ic26b


The Chinese Government’s recent Feb 2013 response is here: http://bit.ly/12EopOC (run it through the
Google translator) “…In August 2012, 360 security guards to its users, has released a product called
KB360018 "high-risk vulnerability patches. The foreign authority website System Explorer is confirmed in the
post-test, the patch is posing as Microsoft's IE patch. …”


SA article last week confirming the event: http://bit.ly/12EoyS2


Other articles: http://bit.ly/12ibM7d


“How Qihoo is committing Fraud” -- http://bit.ly/XQxfRz


http://bit.ly/12ibM7j


These are stories coming out last week. I wrote my article last August. It has held up. My research was and is
correct.


My work on Qihoo’s ARPU was also validated … by Qihoo in their later conference call. They adjusted their
numbers downward – divisible by 3! -- to a more reasonable level after my article …. Without an explanation
and without anybody really caring. As long as the stock price goes up … very few investors ask questions.

If there were a number “5” on one side of the playground and “4” on the other, a rope in the middle, and if the
object were to pull the rope toward the correct answer to the equation: “2 + 2 =What” The kid should always
pull on that side of the rope that leads to 4. If he’s outnumbered and the tug-a-war goes the other way, he
loses one game … but at least he keeps his clarity. That’s worth something, and on average he can expect to
win more than he loses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163741-clearsigns-lies-omissions-and-one-bad-actor 12/30


My report on the underlying reality of Qihoo was and is correct: http://bit.ly/PFhMUl


Here's Qihoo's recent contradiction, 
Q1 2012 CC: “ … the ARPU for the month was about 440 …” 
Q2 2012 CC: “"Web game gross ARPU for this quarter was approximately RMB400."


Question: Does 440/month even come close to 400/quarter? A third grader could figure this out. Where do
you stand on this?


I am again short QIHU -- going into this audit season. CLIR however is my focus.


I focus on “fractured fairytales” – and have a basic faith in human judgment that most lies/errors will
eventually be exposed. How long that takes is beyond my ability: estimating how far irrationality will carry a
matter is not a rational exercise. The facts however never go away and this unrelenting and unavoidable
contact by all interested parties will effect its slow conversion. This is a faith however that is sometimes
difficult to keep. I'll admit that.


If you think my analysis is wrong, point out the errors. “I’ve had a great return on my money” is not a refutation
– just ask Madoff’s victims … or SPU’s ... http://bit.ly/YHgQBI


But if you really think the “price is proof” then CLIR’s drop in price has refuted your position. But it doesn’t
always work that way. The facts are the facts. Whether a crowd masses this way or that way is irrelevant. The
basic risk of being a short seller is that human gullibility is a tangible fact. Frauds and human errors can last
hundreds of years … thousands – flat earth, etc.


>>Furthermore, Matt, it would be nice for you to disclose who is compensating you, as well as how much, for
your so-called "research."


I am a private investor and have no other compensation than my own funds in my own investments. I am also
a participant in the SEC Whistleblower program. Other than that I have not and do not receive compensation
from outside sources for my research on Clearsign or MDB Capital Group.


>>I've done my homework and have been able to identify the guys you're working with.


Being me, I know you’re lying. I work alone. I am a private investor. Of course your other readers will have
room for doubt – but not me. You can play this game with your intended audience … that’s a limitation
inherent in the fact of human subjectivity. But I know you are just making this up.


Now, here’s the next move that you can’t make: you have said you have done your homework and you can
identify the “guys.” At this point, you need to publish your evidence and name names. Who am I working
with? You can’t do that because you’re lying. I know you’re lying because … well … I’m me. I work alone. All
of the research I have presented is my own, all court clerk fees, etc, paid for with my own funds, and
compensated only by my own short (and with some slight hope that the SEC Whistleblower program will pay
off a few years down the road).


You wrote an adjective-dependent rebuttal of my original report. I refuted your rebuttal thoroughly. My original
report stands and the additional material I have presented here raises new questions. You have failed to
respond.

Matt, have you ever spoken with any of the management team at CLIR, visited the company's headquarters/lab and
seen the technology in action, or interviewed any of the principals at MDB Capital?


Didn't think so.


Folks, here's what Matt Berry's analysis fundamentally misses: ClearSign's technology is hugely disruptive and IT
WORKS. Who's names are on the patents isn't relevant.


Berry's research is thorough, but his thesis is wrong. All this innuendo and the personal attacks have absolutely
nothing to do with the fact that CLIR is executing its business plan and is moving down the path of commercialization -
- see the announcement from this morning, "ClearSign Combustion Corporation Develops Novel Power Amplifier for
Cost Effective Implementation of ECC(TM) Technology" - http://yhoo.it/UFnJGm


Matt, mark my words: You are going to get absolutely hammered with your short position. The fact that you're
attempting to manipulate a short @ $4/share while taking on unlimited risk to the upside exposes how illogical this
whole effort is. I'm not in Uni-Pixel (http://bit.ly/11QcqNH), which also is backed by MDB, but the shorts have been
annihilated on that one. As were the naysayers on VirnetX (http://bit.ly/YrMPpY) and Medivation (http://bit.ly/zicQfg),
which also have roots to MDB. So, Matt, keep publishing your defamatory pieces, and just know you've been warned.

a poorly told story? You made the refutation necessary and the refutation of your article is something you

“Who's names are on the patents isn't relevant.”


You can’t have an invention without an inventor. Their names are not just relevant. They are critical.
http://bit.ly/TAskCc


“Berry's research is thorough, but his thesis is wrong.”


I suppose that a less thorough researcher can tell a better story here. I don’t doubt that. But there is a
difference between a commercially viable technology and a story. As for debating the viability of a technology,
if you need to know which side is correct, and which, wrong -- you shouldn't avoid the more thorough report.

Noticeably absent from the "more thorough report" is any mention of ClearSign's team working on the technology and
commercialization efforts, Board of Directors, its technology platform, and the market size. It's simply an attempt to
create fear, uncertainty and doubt, and fundamentally misses the mark.

Author’s reply »  You’re article has been thoroughly refuted. http://sdrv.ms/XqUnpT


You methodology was and is flawed. Instead of looking at the facts underlying management’s story, you
talked to management to get a better story! Instead looking into the facts surrounding Hartwick’s involvement
with Rivera’s technology scam, you say that you went to Hartwick for his explanation?!


I do the opposite: I search for stories which are fractured by the underlying facts. (long or short) This
methodology results in either dishonest or incorrect storytellers – why would I want to go to them for the
“better” story?


“Notice how he avoids the key question...’Matt, have you ever spoken with any of the management team at
CLIR, “


It’s not a key question. It’s a fatal one. After Markopolos determined that Madoff’s trading strategy was
mathematically impossible, it would be a case against himself to debate the merits of that strategy. And why
would Markopolos depend upon Madoff’s explanation and not his own common sense? He goes to regulators
… he tries to get everything out in the open. http://bit.ly/VK8WKM

Now, is this you? (Even the middle name is the same.) If it’s not you, it still works as a metaphor. Before
investing, did Benjamin talk to management before he invested, or did he look at the facts underlying the
story?


Benjamin L. Padnos V Skypeople Fruit Juice http://bit.ly/YHgQBI


Benjamin L. Padnos V. China Education Alliance http://bit.ly/VK8WKN


There’s also a 10-Q with a suit by a Padnos against Andatee China Marine Fuel Services Corp
http://bit.ly/YHgT0B


In the above, would Benjamin have done better by investigating the facts underlying management’s story – or
by listening to management?


One difference between being a short seller and a plaintiff might be whether or not one wises up during one’s
own due diligence or someone else’s.


And why does everyone want a “closed-door” discussion. How would an off-the-radar encounter with
management serve investors? Here I am – out in the open. Management is there, join the debate --- out in the
open. It’s happening now … no special lighting, no dog-and-pony show. Make a public statement that you are
legally bound to. This our dialogue. I have asked management, regulators, and the other investors questions
– they are here: http://bit.ly/VM9TyS. I await a response.


Why have a dialogue with someone that insists you go back into a dark alley and not forward into a well-lit
place where everyone interested can see and hear all. Why the secrecy? Here it is: the facts are presented. I
await Management to join this dialogue.


You made a case; it has been refuted. You have not responded: http://sdrv.ms/XqUnpT

Mr. Berry,


Your write up on this situation has attracted my attention and I will be taking a closer look.


I was a bit disappointed to see that no one from MDB decided to post comments on seeking alpha as they did with my
recent article discussing UNXL. Perhaps comments from them will be forthcoming.


I am continually surprised by investors such as Mr. Padnos who continue to think that the best way to get objective
3rd party information is to ask the people who stand to benefit the most from spreading misinformation.

In Dec 2010 I personally visited China Education Alliance (referenced above) and I was taken to fake schools that
bore a different company's logo. The chairman was taking me around personally.


In one case we showed up a bit early because there were two employees trying to tape a China Education Alliance
logo over the real logo for a different school. Unfortunately they were using scotch tape and it wasn't sticking.


When I asked the chairman about this, he made an unintelligible comment and excuse and assured me that the
company had really just done $35 million in revenues. He encouraged me to take pictures of all the students at this
school and publish them.


At first I thought that he assumed that I was stupid enough to believe it. But then I realized that when he pretended
that it was true, he assumed that I would pretend to believe it and the only people to lose out would be the suckers in
the US who didn't actually know.


Many people who pump these stocks simply do not care if the companies are in fact committing fraud as long as they
(the pumper) can personally claim plausible deniability when the whole thing goes up in flames.


The people perpetrating the fraud seem to get frustrated when someone calls them out on it and won't go along with
the pump party and make money on the way up.


After all. when the stock keeps going up, everyone wins. Right ?


Thanks for your research in this article. I will have a closer look at the details and links this weekend.

“I was a bit disappointed to see that no one from MDB decided to post comments on seeking alpha as they

I was surprised at their mass presence in the comment section of your SA article …. But then Padnos posted
what he said was Martlett/MDB’s year-end letter: “We are also helping [MDB clients] develop response plans
in case their critics come out with spurious attacks.”


Perhaps that was part of their organized response? …. But then why not here? … hmm.


As underwriters of CLIR's IPO, and in light of the false statements in the S-1, how much room does MDB
have for a due diligence defense? http://sdrv.ms/WEl0uM ... hmmm....

Matt: 
You have obviously done your homework. Though not invested in CLIR, I have had experience with this sort of thing.
When evidence exists as to the charachter of the person, their history, their other dealings and whether these
dealings show the integrity of a person, one only has to remember this: "By their fruits shall they be known". If they
aren't producing good fruit, there is a very good chance that the tree itself is diseased. The trail of deception is pretty
apparent. I commend you for your thorough analysis.

Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  “By their fruits …” It was a tough decision when I began. Normally, I wouldn’t deal too much
with who is who … but in this case the company has no products, not even an independently tested
technology and so everything hinges on the “original inventor(s).” Given severe cash burn, the science team
is the only real asset and so it is not only permitted but critical that the science team be examined for
credibility.

attack CLIR. We all know you have taken a short position. We also know that I am a long and believe in the Company.
I then came across something that sounded real familiar. It was a blog posting on SA about a topic called Short and
Distort.


What is the definition or meaning of "short and distort"? 
(From Investopedia) Definition of 'Short And Distort'


An illegal practice employed by unethical internet investors who short-sell a stock and then spread unsubstantiated
rumors and other kinds of unverified bad news in an attempt to drive down the equity price and realized a profit.


Read more: http://bit.ly/Xgp5FV 
Another Definition: 
A "short and distort" is basically the exact opposite of a "pump and dump".


In a "pump and dump", investors will buy up shares of a stock, sing its praises to anyone who will listen (usually
exaggerating the future potential of the company), and then dump their shares when people start to buy.


In a "short and distort". you have people who first short a stock and then spread false rumors about a company. If the
stock drops based on this bogus information, then the short-sellers will cover at a lower price and realize a profit.


Example: A trader shorts 2,000 shares of XYZ at $10. He then signs up to every financial message board and chat
room imaginable, spreading false rumors that XYZ is the subject of a SEC investigation and is about to restate their
earnings for the past two years.


This trader is hoping that some of the holders of XYZ will "panic sell" their shares, causing the stock to drop. Then this
rogue trader can cover at a lower price and realize a profit.


Now I am not accusing you of spreading false information. That would be illegal. What you have done is look long and
hard for a Company that you could openly and easily attack so you could affect or manipulate the stock price and
make a profit by shorting. This is a gray area, you have not really lied, but you have manipulated the stock price. One
of the comments above is from one of your victims. He lost his money. In effect, you are abusing the system. You
have found a loophole that allows you to profit. The unsuspecting longs, the inexperienced investor takes it in the
shorts, but you, and I would suspect, your confederates, make a profit and all is fair. You profit at the expense of
others. Your method affects other people monetarily, professionally and personally. You don’t care. Sounds a bit
sociopathic to me. But that is just my opinion.


I happen to believe what CLIR is doing is great. The technology works and will do well. It will also make the longs a
good profit in the long run. That is what longs do.


You and your type are just another impediment to avoid in the world of investing. Lesson learned. From here on out I
will just ignore you and your bluster and rely on my own DD. I would suggest everyone else do the same.

platform for individuals like Matt Berry to abuse “free speech” in an effort to profit from short-term stock moves as well
as satisfy internal pleasures by seeing their effort create controversy or pain for others. What people need to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163741-clearsigns-lies-omissions-and-one-bad-actor 20/30


I will summarize my thoughts below:


1) First and foremost, this is not a “technology scam”. ClearSign's technology is very disruptive to a multi-billion (or
trillion) dollar industry, and IT WORKS. 
2) Secondly, and very importantly, who’s name is on various patent applications is absolutely meaningless. 
3) Third, MDB Capital is a serious, IP-focused investment bank run by very smart people who have banked multiple
companies from the ground floor to billion-dollar market caps. CLIR has a shot at being their next one. 
4) Please keep in mind that Matt Berry has i) never spoken with anyone at ClearSign; ii) never visited the company or
seen a demonstration of the technology; iii) despite multiple invitations, he has never directly addressed his concerns
with ANY of the other advisors, bankers, lawyers, etc. who he maligns; and iv) we probably do not know the full story
about Berry and any compensation he’s receiving from third parties with short positions. If you look at the publicly-
available “short interest” data, you’ll see that the timing of his articles – particularly the first two – coincide with the
build-up of a large short position: http://bit.ly/YMvDet 
5) And finally, the company is executing its plan: building out the technology platform, expanding the IP portfolio, and
working toward commercial validation.


I would highly urge individuals to speak with management at CLIR and/or MDB Capital. Better yet, go visit ClearSign's
headquarters and get a demonstration of the technology. That will eliminate any doubt.

Matt and other shorts are looking to buy back their shorted shares at as low of price as possible and so will
provide a negative light.


This is the case on any stock. At this point investors need to examine the claims and evidence of both
viewpoints and decide for themselves where the truth actually is. At this point the market for the last several
months has seen this closer to Matt's views.


Since you are so close with management, does their plan include having their technology evaluated by an
independent party anytime soon?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163741-clearsigns-lies-omissions-and-one-bad-actor 21/30


Matt; We went over this back in September and October. It does not matter. What does matter at this point is your
Short and Distort Scam. The only people benefiting from this is you and your confederates in the scam. I asked you
back in September what your motivation was and you refused to answer. Well, six months later, your still at it. The
only scam here is yours. Here is something I found last night on SA.


The Short & Distort Scheme


Stage 1: Monitoring  
In stage 1 of a Short & Distort scheme Short groups Monitor spikes in volumes on stocks with no rumors.


Stage 2: Flagging  
Shorts Flag stocks that run up then sits back and wait patiently for their time.


Stage 3: Preparation  
The Shorters research the company and develop their Distortion of the rumors to be used later.


Stage 4: Actual Shorting  
The shorts step in selling on every possible up tick. This is the Reverse of front loading. Preparations are made to
attack the guy who had earlier written positively about the company and take out, discredit, any new long-term
champions or messengers.


Stage 5: Distortion Campaign  
The shorts step in and increase selling on every possible up tick. Just as with the pump, newsletters, e-mail, PR firms
against P & D, etc. are simulated. Expertise in the field is recruited for credibility. Any possible twist using POS
(Purposely Omitted Syntax) and PAS (Purposely Added Syntax) is conveniently used on every possible angle. If the
POS/PAS is discovered then attack the messenger. Above all control the message boards.


The group clutters the message boards so no positive information can be readily found. Justification is the Value of
the Company in the market. Projections of $0.00 worth and loss projections of 100%  
Note: The market manipulator will do everything in his/her power to keep buyers OUT OF THE STOCK. Cut your
losses is touted to stimulate fear. You bought higher but now they need you to sell lower.


Stage 6: Pressure  
The shorts have taken it too far. The volume is increasing and the price is not effectively dropping. A stalemate
occurs. Personal attacks increase. Threats of legal action, SEC involvement, and yes even death threats increase.
Increased secret IDs are employed to increase the cluttering, personal attacks and the distortion. So begins a string of
lies that run for as long as one's stomach can take it. Desperately playing on the "you have been had" scenario. Any
new news will be hit it hard by shorters to kill any interest.


Note: Watch the volume not the share price. A market manipulator will have various brokers buying and selling the
stock to give the APPEARANCE of increasing volume but the price goes down. Thus stimulating the story the
company is selling or an off shore reg S or other convenient scenario. Watch for large blocks that show up but have a
MM special code, cross overs, etc.


Stage 7: The Cover  
Without warning the buying pressure is too much and the short begins to cover. Short covering combined with new
investors buying into the stock causes the stock to go up. Often the whole thing starts again. Just a vicious cycle
sometimes.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163741-clearsigns-lies-omissions-and-one-bad-actor 22/30


______________________... 
Note: Pump & Dump schemes are investigated by the SEC most of the time, however the Short & Distort scheme is
not apparently high on the SEC's agenda. The shorts, unlike the dumper though, has an unlimited loss factor should
the stock price go up.


Most traders have heard and read of the Pump & Dump scheme. But very little has been written about the other side
of the trade or its opposite, which is the Short & Distort.


Now lets take the Short & Distort scheme and apply it to the rules of Pump & Dump for stock manipulators.


In order to make these market manipulations work, the professionals assume:  
(a) The Public is STUPID and 
(b) The Public will mainly buy at the HIGH and 
(c) The Public will sell at the LOW.  
Therefore, as long as the market manipulator can run crowd control, he can be successful in his agenda of stock
manipulation by controlling the market's greed and fear.


Now this sure sounds familiar. If we go back and look at Matt's article from September and October,
http://seekingalpha.co... and http://seekingalpha.co... the process is evident. So now we are at the hold. Keep the
pressure on and hold down the share price.


Now the real question is? Where did you borrow the shares from or is this a naked short? The only reason I can think
of to hold down the price is to extend the cover period. Do we have a Fail To Deliver problem here?


Lets all look at this realistically. The only ones benefiting here are the shorts which Matt has already stated he has
taken a short position. If you search various message boards, there's Matt and his buddies, hammering anyone that
has anything positive to say about CLIR. Interesting business model. Find a micro-cap with a couple of warts, exploit
the warts, short the stock, make a buck or a lot of bucks. Toeing the line of legality, nothing said is untrue, but making
much ado about minor indiscrepancies. Great indignation, hiding behind the screen of protecting the little guy. We got
your number.


Now comes the next phase. Use the profits from the short to quietly accumulate shares, let the price rise, sell the
equities, short it again, start the rancor all over.

Dr. Thomas Hartwick, an early technical advisor to ClearSign, asked me to post this comment for him:


Now I know what a celeb feels like when slimed by a tabloid! Apparently, Mr. Berry seems to believe that if my
integrity and character are impugned, then investors will believe that ClearSign Combustion Company technology is
flawed. He carries his SSTP deductions to absurd conclusions as regards my involvement. My five decades of ethical
professional conduct are widely acknowledged, hence, his indictment of me by distorted allegations won't work.


I cannot speak for ClearSign management, but as an early participant in their technology I can say that ClearSign
technology is based on experimental fact. I can also state that my effort to establish the science basis largely explains
experimental data. I summarized the basic science status before I left ClearSign in a report dated 3/7/2012.


My advice to serious investors is to not rely on specious allegations, but instead go to ClearSign management for a
dose of facts and reality .

The facts are the facts. I have provided concrete evidence, see: http://sdrv.ms/Wk8dhO


>>Apparently, Mr. Berry seems to believe that if my integrity and character are impugned, then investors will

No. The question is, given the SSTP case, is Hartwick willing to rent his name out for a fee? You yourself,
Ben, provided evidence when you claimed that Hartwick advised over 700 companies. Either you are lying,
are incorrect, or this creates a serious problem for Hartwick’s story.


In your article, Mr. Padnos, you said that Hartwick has advised over 700 companies ‒ and when you look at it
that way, it sounds impressive. But just 3 years ago, in an SSTP press release, Hartwick was said to have
advised 500 companies over the previous 50 years. http://reut.rs/Y3l9o9


When you step back and calculate the amount of time available to each company, it appears that somebody
is not being straight with somebody else.


What would be the ratio of money received to scientific contribution delivered? Let’s do the math. According to
SSTP and Padnos, Hartwick advised 500 companies until three years ago and 700 companies to date. That
comes to 200 new companies over the last 3 years, or 66.6 companies per year. If this is all true, then
Hartwick can dedicate, on average, a total of 5.5 days to each company. (This presumes that Hartwick never
takes a day off, gets sick, or travels.) How much scientific effort is actually involved with cutting edge science?

… “world changing” science, like solving the world’s energy problems by applying a secret catalyst to a
thousand-year-old technology or re-inventing fire by applying an electric field like William Brande did 200
years ago? Given the time constraints, is it possible for Hartwick to make a meaningful contribution to the
majority of these companies, is he only lending his name for a fee, or is someone lying?


See http://sdrv.ms/YuDn7O


>>I cannot speak for ClearSign management, but as an early participant in their technology I can say that
ClearSign technology is based on experimental fact. I can also state that my effort to establish the science
basis largely explains experimental data.


Yes. It has a scientific basis – but it’s not new. It’s old . That was the point of my first report:
http://bit.ly/UFnuVu The experimental facts date back to the Kaehni’s – 60 years back. http://bit.ly/UUvW9W


Presenting an old but obscure technology as if it had a “secret sauce” was precisely what Rivera did and what
he was found guilty of. Rivera ran a technology scam, Hartwick’s name was used to help promote that
technology, not only according to press releases but according to your (Padnos) own citations of Hartwick.


> I summarized the basic science status before I left ClearSign in a report dated 3/7/2012.


This is interesting. Is Dr. Hartwick saying that he is not with Clearsign anymore? That he left Clearsign as of
3/7/2012? Or did you mean to say that he left “Clearsign a report dated 3/7/2012” …? Which is it? (He is still
listed as the top-listed advisor in the April prospectus.)


>>>My advice to serious investors is to not rely on specious allegations ….


I have provided facts. You have provided adjectives.


Clearsign’s ECC technology has no credible inventor.

I have to give it to you Matt. You are sticking to the script of the Short and Distort, lash back at anyone that states a
contrary position to your own. The only response you made to me after I accused you as the one perpetrating the
scam was "Who invented ECC". Not word one about me accusing you of being a blatant stock manipulator.
Interesting. Nope, follow the script, attempt to keep the share price down to allow a longer period to cover.


Short Interest was the highest right before the expiration of the lock-up period in October. Since then it has steadily
fell, current short interest, as of the 01/31/13 report was 134,069 shares, days to cover has continued to lengthen. So
if you shorted CLIR in late September or early October when the share price was between $7.30 and $8.00 on a 6
month contract then you are running out of time. This latest article is timed to try and push down the price as far as
you can so you can maximize your profits. CLIR was up $0.09 today, what did that cost you? Looks like CLIR hit
bottom at $4.29 on 02/05/13 and you missed the boat.

In my opinion, this latest article is nothing more then another attempt to manipulate the share price. It sure would be a
bummer if something happened to raise the share price.


As far as I am concerned your scam has been exposed. You have used SA as tool to perpetuate your scam and
manipulate the share price at the cost to others and for your financial benefit. I have reported you to SA and would
suggest that any others that have been damaged or insulted by Matt’s actions, file a complaint with SA as well. You
also might add some harsh words to SA for aiding and abetting a stock manipulation scheme.


Oh, and I do not care who invented ECC. I just know it works, many others know it works and do not care about the
inventor credit either. Once the ECC technology is commercialized, those that got in early, say at, $4.45 will do real
well.

1. "I have reported you to SA and would suggest that any others that have been damaged or insulted by
Matt’s actions, file a complaint with SA as well. You also might add some harsh words to SA for aiding and

What? You're saying that you reported me to those who were "aiding and abetting" me??? Who would do
that? (If I thought you had committed a crime why would I report you to your accomplice?)


 
2. " Not word one about me accusing you of being a blatant stock manipulator. Interesting."


I did respond Steven. I'll say it again -- with different words.


The one who is influencing the price -- up or down -- WITH FALSE INFORMATION is guilty of manipulation.


I'm not making this up. "Injecting inaccurate information" is the distinguishing feature in legal
prosecutions/defenses of stock manipulation.


The one who is providing the corrected information is in fact doing the market a service.


3. "I do not care who invented ECC."


You can't have an invention without an inventor -- even if, as you say, you "don't care."


Critical Question: Who invented Clearsign's ECC technology?


 
4. You say "ECC technology" as if you are aware of something new and unique to Clearsign. What would that
be?


5. "I just know it works."


The knowledge that electric fields influence flames is not new and unique to Clearsign's ECC technology. Of
course "it" works. "It's" worked for over 50 years and there are many patents already in existence.

How do you know it works? Where is the independent test results? Is this your attempt to "distort" the truth?


12 Feb 2013, 01:36 AM 


stevenkind
How do I know it works? I have witnessed tests and demonstrations, something you have not done. My basis
of expertise? My educational major was physics, I have been a Mechanical Engineer involved with the
combustion and boiler industry for 30 plus years. I have specified, installed and commissioned the same type
of emissions testing equipment used by CLIR to verify their test performance. I have built, modified and tested
more burners and combustions systems then I can count. I have been hired as a consultant by some of the
largest companies in America, all branches of the Military, DOE, DOD and DARPA. I am one of the few
individuals that has the experience to evaluate CLIR's technology and make a judgment about its validity.


I am a Long, I have no need to distort the truth.


12 Feb 2013, 01:05 PM

So you have actually witnesed and looked at data that it does infact reduce NOx emmisions, remove
particulates, and improve efficiency at a level that makes it attractive commercially at commercial scales
(>1MMBTU)?


If you have not then you cannot claim it works. Again, where is the third party verification?

The technology is variation of the bug zapper having no practical application in the industrial or commercial
boiler application. However, it is extremely fascinating about how this gee-wiz bs has captured attention and
investment without any evidence of any actual boiler having this burner technology.

SEATTLE , Feb. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ClearSign Combustion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLIR), and Aera Energy
LLC announced today that project objectives of a field demonstration of Duplex™ Technology in a Once-Through
Steam Generator (OTSG) have been achieved. The Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) steam generator, located at

Aera, alone, is a $40-$50 million revenue opp.


The 700 additional Once Through Steam Generators in San Jaquin are $280mm opp. Add in the 3000 Alberta
