SEC	Filings	Warn	Halcon	Resources	Corporation	Shareholders	of
Significant	Dilution

[Author's	Note	2/9/12	-	The	transaction	described	below	closed	on	Wednesday	8	February
2012.	
As	part	of	the	transaction,	RAM	Energy	Resources	changed	its	name	to	Halcon
Resources	Corporation,	and	its	ticker	symbol	is	HK.]


On	22	December	RAM	Energy	Resources	(RAM)	announced	a	highly	dilutive	capital
raising.


Since	that	date,	RAM	shares	have	soared	from	an	intraday	low	of	$1.65	to	an	intraday
high	of	$4.13	on	19	January.	Although	shares	have	since	retreated	to	a	closing	price	of
$3.82	on	3	February,	they	remain	at	a	level	more	than	triple	the	capital-raising	price
of	$1.25.


This	article	reviews	the	transaction	details,	including	the	substantial	dilution	that	will	be
imposed	upon	shareholders	as	early	as	Wednesday	8	February.	RAM	shares	are
significantly	overvalued	given	the	dilution	caused	by	the	capital	raising.


Transaction	details


RAM	will	receive	$550	million	from	Halcon	Resources	LLC,	in	exchange	for:


220	million	shares	of	common	stock	at	$1.25	per	share
$275	million	senior	convertible	note,	convertible	into	common	stock	at	$1.50	per	share
after	2	years	(275	/	1.50	=	183.33	million	shares)
warrants	to	purchase	another	110	million	shares	of	common	stock	at	$1.50
(exercisable	after	5	years)


RAM	currently	has	78.809	million	shares	outstanding.


The	following	table	outlines	the	increases	to	the	company's	share	count	following	the	three
components	of	the	Halcon	transaction:

Warrants	exercisable


110	million	at	$1.50 592.142	million


The	transaction	is	scheduled	to	close	on	8	February.	Given	recent	share	prices	well	in
excess	of	$1.50,	we'll	assume	that	the	convertible	note	will	be	converted	into	common
stock,	and	that	the	warrants	will	be	exercised.


Although	the	company's	market	capitalisation	is	now	only	$301	million,	the	company's	pro-
forma	market	capitalisation	will	rise	to	
482.142	million	*	3.82	=	$1,841	million	upon	closing	of	the	transaction.


As	the	company	warned	about	this	dilution	in	its	information	statement:


"Our	stockholders	will	experience	substantial	dilution.	The	consummation
of	the	Halcon	transaction	will	have	an	immediate	dilutive	effect	on	the
ownership	interests	and	voting	power	of	our	existing	stockholders."


and


"Conversion	of	the	note	into	common	stock	or	exercise	of	the	warrants	will
further	dilute	the	ownership	interests	and	voting	rights	of	existing
stockholders."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/343221-sec-filings-warn-halcon-resources-corporation-shareholders-of-significant-dilution 3/6


"The	warrants	and	the	conversion	rights	under	the	note	could	result	in
significant	"market	overhang"	which	could	restrain	or	limit	increases	in	the
market	value	of	our	stock."


Benefits	of	transaction


As	a	result	of	the	transaction,	RAM	will	change	its	name	to	Halcon	Resources
Corporation,	and	Floyd	C	Wilson	will	become	CEO	of	renamed	company.	Wilson	has	had
success	previously	at	Petrohawk	Energy	(NYSE:HK),	and	RAM	will	benefit	from	his
expertise.


Excessive	"Floyd	Wilson	premium"


However	at	a	share	price	of	$3.82	the	market	is	placing	an	extreme	"Floyd	Wilson
premium"	on	RAM	shares.	As	the	company	warned:


"We	may	not	be	able	to	profitably	deploy	the	funds	that	we	will	receive."


and


"Our	growth	and	profitability	will	be	largely	dependent	upon	our	ability	to	deploy
the	$550.0	million	in	new	capital	that	we	will	receive."


Pro-forma	balance	sheet

transaction	on	the	company.

As	described	earlier,	upon	transaction	closing,	RAM's	pro-forma	market	capitalisation	at	a
share	price	of	$3.82	will	be	$1,841	million.	Yet	for	this	increased	valuation,	shareholders
will	only	receive	a	company	whose	assets	are	largely	$327.6	million	in	cash	and	$203.8
million	in	oil	and	gas	properties.


Assuming	that	the	warrants	will	be	exercised,	we	then	have	a	pro-forma	market
capitalisation	of	592.142	million	*	3.82	=	$2,261.98	million,	for	a	company	with	$492.6
million	in	cash	(increase	of	$165	million	warrant	proceeds)	and	$203.8	million	in	oil	and
gas	properties.


Rather	than	continuing	to	describe	the	excessive	valuation	placed	on	the	company,	we
encourage	readers	to	review	the	company's	information	statement	for	further	descriptions
of	the	valuation	placed	on	the	company	by	Jeffries	in	its	advice	to	RAM.	The	company
also	describes	in	detail	the	risks	associated	with	the	dilution	that	is	a	result	of	the	capital
raising.

RAM	is	trading	at	an	extremely	high	"Floyd	Wilson	premium."	While	we	understand	that	he
has	been	successful	in	previous	oil	and	gas	ventures,	a	pro-forma	market	capitalisation	of
$2,261	million	for	the	company	is	excessive.	Until	shareholders	(whose	number	will	rise
from	78.8	million	to	592.1	million	pro-forma)	can	see	that	the	cash	infusion	has	been	used
to	generate	substantial	profits,	there	seems	to	be	little	reason	for	the	stock	to	trade	this	far
above	the	capital	raising	prices	of	$1.25	and	$1.50.

Laurence,	NYC
Author	left	out	one	very	important	fact...Jeffries	continues	to	hold	about	22%	of	the	Common	stock!	Why	would	they
hold	it	if	dilution	will	kill	its	value?	See	Appendix	G.


----
.	Furthermore,	as	of	the	date	hereof,	we	own	17,198,366	shares	of	Common	Stock,	representing	approximately	22	%
of	the	outstanding	shares	of	Common	Stock	(before	giving	effect	to	the	Transaction).	In	addition,	we	may	seek	to,	in
the	future,	provide	financial	advisory	and	financing	services	to	the	Company,	the	Investor	or	entities	that	are	affiliated
with	the	Company	or	the	Investor,	for	which	we	would	expect	to	receive	compensation.	Except	as	otherwise	expressly
provided	in	our	engagement	letter	with	the	Company,	our	opinion	may	not	be	used	or	referred	to	by	the	Company,	or
quoted	or	disclosed	to	any	person	in	any	matter,	without	our	prior	written	consent.


Based	upon	and	subject	to	the	foregoing,	we	are	of	the	opinion	that,	as	of	the	date	hereof,	the	Purchase	Price	to	be
received	by	the	Company	in	exchange	for	the	Shares,	the	Note	and	the	Warrants	pursuant	to	the	Transaction	is	fair,
from	a	financial	point	of	view,	to	the	Company.


Very	truly	yours,

You	are	correct	with	your	quote,	however,	you	did	not	provide	the	important	context:	"The	full	text	of	the
written	opinion	of	Jefferies,	dated	as	of	December	19,	2011,	is	attached	hereto	as	Appendix	G."	Therefore	we
do	not	know	whether	or	not	they	continue	to	hold	RAM	shares	since	that	date.
