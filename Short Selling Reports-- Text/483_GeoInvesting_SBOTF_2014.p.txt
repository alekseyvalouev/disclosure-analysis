Stellar Biotechnologies: We've Seen The Pump, Now Here Comes The
Dump
Sep. 23, 2014 10:15 AM ET31 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


We believe Stellar Biotechnologies' share price to be a product of a well-timed
promotional campaign.


SBOTF's share count has risen 88.2% in three short years, and the September 2013
PIPE was done at a fully diluted share price of $0.3415/share. (sourced below).


The company appears to be operating far below its capacity, and has reported net
losses of ($14.8M), ($5.1M), and ($3.5M) for the past three years. (source 3).


Promotions have touted the company's former agreement with Sigma Aldrich, but
we've found that this agreement had expired in 2013.


SBOTF's biggest competitor, BioSyn, established in 1984, claims to be able to
produce far more than 1,500 grams/year. (SBOTF's current capacity).


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Stellar Biotechnologies (SBOTF) has been an intriguing story these last two months.


We've found three things about Stellar Biotechnologies to be concerned with right off the
bat. These items, combined with the results of further due diligence, lead us to believe that
Stellar will make its way back to $0.70 and resume its descent downward from there.


First, we've found a promotional campaign that we believe to be the cause of the
company's stock price moving up in rapid fashion without material news or fundamentals
to back it up. We've found third-parties that have issued questionable campaigns that are
touting SBOTF, and these promotions have made some robust claims that we believe they
can't back up - including, at one point, commenting that SBOTF would list on the
Nasdaq "as soon as August 31, 2014."


Second, we will shine light on exaggerations made by these promotions about future
operational expansion, which we view as unnecessary and a non-issue due to Stellar's
already anemic history of production (sourced below). In addition, the company itself

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 2/48


admits that it does not know if it is economically feasible to expand at this stage in its
growth. We question why the company would think about expanding when we believe it to
be operating far under capacity and production appears to be falling. Our conversations
with BioSyn, a 30+ year veteran in the Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ("KLH") niche, confirm
to us that Stellar's capabilities are nowhere near as robust as this competitor. Stellar's own
20-F from 2013 states that it produced under 50g of KLH for 2013, representing less than
4% of the company's 1,500g capacity. Stellar's V.P. of Corporate Development &
Communications, Mark McPartland confirmed that the company was operating at far less
than capacity, and had never operated over 10% capacity.


Finally, we question the validity of promotions tied to the company's former agreement
with Sigma Aldrich. When SBOTF's CEO was questioned about production during the
2014 Rodman & Renshaw conference, he commented on the record that Stellar currently
supplies KLH to Sigma Aldrich (NASDAQ:SIAL) via a publicly disclosed agreement
between the two companies. His comments implied that this supply agreement was active
and ongoing, yet we can't find any mention of it in either company's recent filings. SBOTF
VP, Mark McPartland told us that the company doesn't comment on who it sells to, and
that the agreement was a "rolling agreement".


Furthermore, posing as a buyer, GeoInvesting tried to purchase KLH from Sigma Aldrich,
who told us it was manufactured in-house by its operation in Israel.


To further back this up, we found that according to Stellar's Form 20-F filed on
December 31, 2013, its contract with Sigma Aldrich had expired in June 2013
without being extended.


It calls itself the "world leader in sustainable manufacture of KLH (source 28)," but from
what we've found, this is probably not the case. BioSyn, a U.S./German company, is
acknowledged as Stellar's main competition. We called BioSyn to discuss Stellar's
production capabilities of 1,500 grams/year, and BioSyn's president, Shammana
Muddukrishna said, "We already produce much more than that."


In addition, the company states in its own filings that it doesn't know "if it is economical to
manufacture KLH and related products on a large scale" (source 3).


After a steady walk down from the $1.60 levels in March of this year, SBOTF found itself
trading around $0.70 to end the month of July - less than a month and a half ago.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 3/48


Beginning on August 11th, and seemingly without rhyme or reason, the stock began a
rocket-like ascent from those $0.70 levels to near $2.30/share on no news and record
volume - all in less than one month's time.


What major material news could have occurred in such a short time that would cause this
struggling, money-losing company to mysteriously triple its value? According to a
company-issued press release, nothing (source 8). According to what we believe, this
is the product of a comprehensive and well-timed promotional campaign about a
company that is in no way as exclusive as the promotions it is making it out to be.


In this piece, we're going to show:


The promotion that we believe caused a rapid ascent in SBOTF's share price to
current levels.
That a partnership agreement used to tout the company by promoters has been
expired and has not been extended since June 2013.
Why we think SBOTF's stock crashed just days after spiking - and why we expect
another decline.

That SBOTF's own paid research firm only has a $1.14 price target on the stock
(sourced below) - representing about a 33% downside to current trading levels around
$1.70.
The company appears to be operating far below its capacity,  
 
and has reported net losses of ($14.8M), ($5.1M), and ($3.5M) for the past three years
(source 3).


The company does not have a monopoly on KLH as newsletters claim, nor do we
believe it to be the leader in its industry; in fact, its biggest competitor, BioSyn, claims
to be able to produce far more than 1,500 grams/year (SBOTF's current capacity), and
also claims to have supplied the KLH to "almost 90% of the clinical trials that have
taken place to date and the ones that are continuing now."
SBOTF and some "lucky" investors valued shares at around $0.34/share during the
company's September 2013 private placement. (sourced below)
Why we think there's significant more downside to SBOTF at current levels, and well
below the $1.14 price target set by the company's paid analyst report.


The Promotions Begin


Stellar Biotechnologies drew our attention due to its bizarre trading.


When we began to dig and look for information as to what could have caused the stock to
move the way that it did on such short notice, we turned up some interesting information.


First, we obtained the following e-mail, which appears to have been issued on August 18,
2014. (source 1)

The enclosed link to "our most exciting initiative ever" has been taken down recently, and
we are instead given the following message when we try to follow the link:

Using Google Cache, we were able to locate a copy of the report, which appears to first
have been issued in July 2014 (source 2).

The name "Stellar" or ticker symbol "SBOTF" do not appear in the report itself, but the
similarities between this report and SBOTF are uncanny. The newsletter also fails to
mention any other public companies, prompting potential investors to reach out to Michael
A. Robinson, the name signed on the report, for "the goods."


The newsletter is clearly a lead in to a promotion of Stellar, as you can see from a few
examples showcasing the similarities between the data points in the newsletter compared
to SBOTF's SEC filings (source 3).


Things like the "Scientific Board" that is touted in the newsletter fit Stellar to a tee. Here is
an excerpt from the newsletter:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_4.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 8/48


The above statement from the newsletter runs commensurate with the "Scientific Board"
in SBOTF's 20-F filings:


A post at Stock Gumshoe (source 4) also believes that the newsletter was, in fact, touting
Stellar:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 9/48


If you want to read into this particular newsletter a bit more, you can log onto the Stock
Gumshoe site and read the comments to this piece. A lot of them seem to be of the
consensus that this was a well-timed and well-placed promotion.


This was taking place from the July date on the newsletter through August 11th, 2014,
when the stock began its run. Sources that we have spoken to have told us that they
received a copy of this newsletter for the first time on August 18th, 2014, well after the
stock had begun its ascent upward.


Here are some other similarities:

We even found promos using the exact same text as the newsletter on Facebook (source
5):

Also, we found a couple of interesting statements that were made in an e-mail blast that
we believed to have gone out around August 19th, 2014 (source 6). This e-mail from
Money Morning also has Michael Robinson's name in it:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_10.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 12/48


After speaking with the company, we take Stellar at its word when it says that these
promotions did not operate in conjunction with the company, nor do we believe that Money
Morning actually got this uplist date directly from Stellar's management. However, when
we spoke with Stellar's VP, Mark McPartland, he told us he was aware of these
promotions.


Regardless of whether or not the company had anything to do with it, the statement about
uplisting is irresponsible. We find such a forward-looking claim to be a red flag, regardless
of whether or not it was the CEO or simply the newsletter that put it out in the first place.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 13/48


Stellar's corporate video (source 25) seems to be the source for many of the images that
were included in the newsletter. Here are two example images used in the newsletter and
in Stellar's corporate video:


On August 25th, word went out that the newsletter that was touting SBOTF was going to
have to "shut down the most extraordinary venture [they've] ever developed (source 7)."



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_12.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 14/48


In either event, in terms of the uplist, it is worth noting that we are well beyond August
31st, and SBOTF continues to trade on the OTCQB.


"Coincidentally," during the first hours of trading on August 28th, the company lost over
29% of its value. From August 27th to September 2nd, the price dropped from over
$2.20/share to as low as $1.40/share, an astounding 36% drop in just three short trading
days. Those that were buying on the hopes and dreams issued by this newsletter had
taken significant losses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 15/48


On August 29th, the company issued a press release (source 8) that stated it was "not
aware of any material change in the Company's operations that would merit such trading
activity." We find it interesting that SBOTF (or its securities lawyers) felt prompted to put
this press release out after the drop in the stock price, but not while the stock was
rocketing upwards without "material changes" occurring. After Stellar made us aware
that it knew of these promotions, we were taken back by how the company has
seemingly failed to control this dissemination of false and misleading information.


With the company admitting no material changes had taken place, we strongly believe the
drastic swing in the stock's price was nothing more than a result of this newsletter going
out.


Again, it comes as no surprise to us that this company is still listed on the OTCQB in the
U.S. and the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada at the time of this article being prepared
on September 16, 2014 (source 29).


Supplemental Findings


We've also noted that Stellar's stock seems to be associated with MissionIR and
DreamTeam - two names that give us pause due to their questionable track records.
While we don't believe the company has directly hired these promoters, we find it
noteworthy that these names are involved in touting how great of an investment SBOTF
is.


For a little background, we know that MissionIR is a brand that's affiliated with
DreamTeamGroup (source 9).



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_14.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 16/48


To familiarize yourself a bit more with DreamTeam, you can read Richard Pearson's write-
up entitled "Behind the Scenes with DreamTeam, CytRx, and Galena" on Seeking Alpha
(source 10). Put simply, in this piece he claims that DreamTeam disguised themselves
under different pseudonyms to promote CytRx. As a result, the article notes that over 100
DreamTeam articles had been removed from various sites across the web.


A follow-up article was published by ValueWalk (source 11).


Again, we are not implying that SBOTF hired DreamTeam or any of its affiliates, but simply
pointing out that we think it's a red flag that an affiliate of DreamTeam is promoting SBOTF
online.


We also believe these promotional touts for SBOTF contain false and misleading
information.


MissionIR seems to have been posting about SBOTF for some time now (on various
websites). Here are a couple of the posts that we've found:


1. On February 14, 2014, there was an instablog written on Seeking Alpha by MissionIR
(source 13). The article had this vague disclaimer at the bottom of it.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_16.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 17/48


2. On August 14, 2014, there was a post made by MissionIR about SBOTF on Investors
Hub (source 14). The post has the "Compensated Awareness Post" banner at the top of it,
leading one to that assume that MissionIR may have been compensated by the company.


The MissionIR post claims that:


"Stellar has also entered into an agreement with the SAFC division of Sigma Aldrich,
a highly respected international vendor of specialty chemicals and biologics for
commercial life science applications. Under the terms of the contract, SAFC will
"sell, distribute and market" Stellar's high molecular weight keyhole limpet
hemocyanin (HMW KLH) for application in therapeutic vaccines."


We find it interesting that in 2013, it appears that SAFC allowed the "Marketing and Sales
Agreement" with SBOTF to expire. This is what the company's Form 20-F reads from
more than a year ago (source 3).


If this is true, MissionIR is promoting the company with a deal that isn't even in place any
longer. Here are two more examples that we believe to be extremely misleading.

MissionIR seems to have published this article in as many venues as they could. Aside
from Investors Hub and Seeking Alpha, you can find it on MissionIR's website (source 15),
Small Cap Network (source 16), DreamTeam Network (source 17), and Twitter (source
18).


The Latest Promotion


It was surprising to us when we saw SBOTF up 5% at the open September 5th.


Once we checked, we saw the following headline (source 19):


Despite the fact that it's unusual for a company to issue a press release announcing an
analyst report, we found that this BrokerBank Securities, Inc. link to this particular report
led us to a website called smallcapstreet.com. You can view this by following the link that's

leads us to numerous results - most of which seem to be the same style of analyst reports.

From the same search, we found disclosures like this one, which tie the two names
together:


"Apr 9, 2014 - No liability is accepted by Small Cap Street, LLC and BrokerBank

We also recall that "Small Cap Street" seems to have had a history of promotions, as
they're noted in a critical article about Provectus (source 20):

a week ago, PVCT traded around $3.75, the stock now trades around $2: a crushing
-46% plunge in the stock" -- May 2014. (Now it trades at $1.05)


In addition, Bleecker Street Research also released an article (source 21) about VGGL,
where they are critical about Small Cap Street's involvement in potentially promoting it.
The stock has gone from $5.73 near June 3rd (when this piece was put out) to $3.44,
what it is trading at today. This represents downside of nearly 40%.

In 2014, Promoters Are Touting an Agreement that Expired in 2013


We should note that with regards to Stellar's 2011 "Marketing and Sales Agreement" with
SAFC, a Sigma-Aldrich subsidiary. This announcement of a "strategic agreement" was
announced in a press release on 8/03/11. When it was released, Stellar's CEO, Frank
Oakes stated:


"The agreement solidifies our position as the only source for a scalable supply of
cGMP-grade HMW-KLH for the vaccine business. We have put Stellar's aquaculture
KLH supply front and center in combination with what we believe is the most
important manufacturer and marketer of cGMP biologics in the world, Sigma-
Aldrich's SAFC business unit. This exciting development will allow us to move
aggressively forward on our diagnostic programs, knowing that the state-of-the-art
quality assurance and production capabilities of SAFC will be providing the
backbone for companies seeking the highest quality HMW-KLH available for vaccine
developers anywhere in the world. We look forward to continuing growth in this
relationship and will begin manufacture of SAFC's initial order as soon as possible."


After an initial purchase order, for which a press release was issued in September of 2011
(source 22), there doesn't seem to be any tangible traction resulting from the 2011
partnership. The last note that we see about this relationship appears in Stellar's Form 20-
F for 2013. The Form 20-F notes that the "agreement was active until June 2013 when it
expired without extension."


Sigma Aldrich or SAFC does not appear on Stellar's website under partners, nor does it
appear in any subsequent filing after this information was disclosed in the 2013 Form 20-
F. There is also no mention of this partnership in the company's most recent corporate
presentation, published in June of 2014 (source 23).


A search on Stellar's website for "SAFC" yields only the original release and the initial
purchase order:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 23/48


When we asked Stellar about whether or not this deal was active, VP Mark McPartland
told us it was a "rolling agreement", but would not tell us if the company had made any
sales to Sigma Aldrich this year.


When we asked Sigma Aldrich's IR if there was any continued business going on between
the two, he stated:


"To be honest, I'm not aware of anything and we don't tend to comment on
agreements other than what we put out in our SEC filings; so I can't really give you
much comment beyond that. I don't believe we've said anything in our filings."


Just to double-check, we went back through Sigma-Aldrich's filings through when the deal
expired, and we don't see Stellar, or KLH for that matter, in any of them.


To triple-check, we called Sigma-Aldrich sales, and a nice gentleman was happy to walk
us through the procedure to distinguish what the origin of its KLH product is.


He gave us the lot number of the KLH it was selling, and that led us to this:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 24/48


Once we pulled up the certificate of origin, the gentleman confirmed over the phone that
since the KLH was manufactured in Israel, that it was indeed Sigma's own product (not
manufactured from an outside source).


We also watched CEO Frank Oakes' presentation at the Rodman & Renshaw conference
just days ago. We've obtained the video and audio from this presentation, and have
posted them here so that everyone can see.


We note that at 18:29, when asked about the competitive landscape, the CEO responds:


"Stellar supplies KLH through a publicly announced agreement with Sigma Aldrich, a
major global reagent supplier, we produce the KLH intermediate from our aquiculture
program - they purify it into a proprietary formulation that they supply to drug
companies"


We question if the company is still, in fact, supplying Sigma Aldrich, and if they are, in
what capacity, given its limited production.


We also obtained a research report by Stonegate Securities that went out on July 15,
2014 on SBOTF. Stellar VP, Mark McPartland confirmed that Stonegate was compensated
by Stellar, and in this report, they only give SBOTF a valuation of $1.14/share:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 25/48


We also noted the disclaimer at the bottom of the report says flat-out that Stonegate is
receiving compensation from Stellar.


If company-paid analysts think SBOTF is only worth $1.14, what do non-company paid
analysts think?


The Share Count Has Risen 88.2% in Three Short Years, and the Company Placed a
Valuation of Just $27M on Itself As Recently as Last Year


We note that the number of outstanding shares in SBOTF has increased dramatically over
the last 3 years. According to the company's 2013 Form 20-F, the number of shares has
risen from 41.6 million in 2011 to 78.3 million as of today. That's an increase of 88.2% in
just three short years.


If it keeps adding shares at this percentage rate, the company will have 147 million shares
outstanding three years from now.

In the past, shares have been issued at alarming discounts.


If you reference the September 2013 private placement, you'd see that each unit was
issued for $1.05, and included a half share warrant to purchase at $1.35.


"The Company issued 11,428,570 units for total gross proceeds of $12,000,000.
Each unit consisted of one common share and one-half of a share purchase warrant,
with each full warrant exercisable into one additional common share at a price of
$1.35 for a period of three years from the issuance date of the warrants."


SBOTF, on the day prior to the announcement, closed at $1.89 per share.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 27/48


How can we look to see how much SBOTF values its own shares in this particular
placement?


We can do this in an easy three-step exercise:


1. First, we can compute the value of the 5,714,285 three year-long warrants issued
during the PIPE using the Black-Scholes model.


2. Then, we subtract the value of the warrants from the gross proceeds raised by the
company during the placement ($12,000,000-$8,096,897.44). This gives us a figure of
$3,903,102.56


3. We take the result of step two and divide by 11,428,570 (number of common Shares
issued), which gives us the alarming result of $0.34/share. The work looks like this:


From this, we can derive two more alarming figures:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_35.png
5/23/2018 Stellar Biotechnologies: We've Seen The Pump, Now Here Comes The Dump - Stellar Biotechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SBOT) | Seeking …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 28/48


1. The company offered shares on September 23, 2013 at a 81.93% discount to the pre-
announcement trading price of $1.89.


2. This deal only values the company at around $27M vs. its current market cap of
over $130M, despite any material developments at the company. We found this by
taking $0.3415 times the 78,865,031 shares outstanding at 12/31/2013 (source 3).


That leads us to ask: Why should shareholders and investors value this company at
about FIVE TIMES what the company values itself- especially given the inability of
the company to generate profit?


The Company is Operating Far Under Capacity and Is Not the Leader in KLH


In addition to the share count increasing, the company has constantly been talking about
increasing production. However, filings show that the company is by far consistently
operating under its current allocated production. The company has disclosed that for both
the fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013 (source 3), it has a production capacity of 1,500
grams of KLH/year. The Form 20-F states:


"Currently, the Company's production capacity is 1,500 grams per year. The
Company currently has live M. crenulata inventory sufficient to increase KLH
production volume by approximately 3,000 grams per year. The Company
anticipates scaling up its production through the addition of the required equipment
and personnel as demand warrants using funds received from the September 2013
private placement."


Yet, what we found in the company's last annual report is that for 2011, 2012 and 2013,
the amount of KLH grams produced seems to have been a small percentage of capacity -
and has declined year over year. The 2013 20-F (source 3) reads:


"The quantity of KLH pharmaceutical intermediate produced in fiscal 2013 was
approximately 46 grams for product development and research. The Company sold
approximately 0.34 grams of KLH in various formulations from prior years'
production. The quantity produced in 2012 was 161 grams for commercial sales,
contract obligations, product development and research and 20.5 grams of KLH in
various formulations were sold, including a portion from prior years' production. The
quantity produced in 2011 was approximately 340 grams for commercial sales,
contract obligations, product development and research. The Company sold 0.76
grams of KLH in various formulations in that fiscal year."
5/23/2018 Stellar Biotechnologies: We've Seen The Pump, Now Here Comes The Dump - Stellar Biotechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SBOT) | Seeking …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 29/48


From this, we can project what capacity SBOTF has been operating at over the last three
years:


FY KLH Produced+Sold (Grams) % of 1,500g Capacity Used


2011 340.76 22.71%


2012 181.5 12.1%


2013 46.34 3.09%


We asked the company about the amount of grams produced in 2014, but we were told
we would have to wait for the coming 10-K.


This data seems to suggest to us an astonishing figure: SBOTF only produced at 3.09%
of its potential production capacity in 2013. In addition, the percentage of capacity
seems to have dropped significantly since 2011.


Puzzling about these figures is that the company seems to be pushing the
possibility of ramping up production.


In the MD&A (Exhibit 99.2) for the nine months ended May 31, 2014, the company wrote
the following:


Then, we have this mystifying paragraph buried in the company's 2013 Form 20-F (source
3):


We have to ask how much business the company actually expects to do in the coming
years that it would need to expand production by 1200%, when it's currently only
using under 4% of its 1,500g capacity and openly admit in its own filings that it
doesn't know if it's economical to manufacture?



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_37.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 30/48


Finally, SBOTF does not, by any means, have a monopoly on the KLH niche as the
promotion was suggesting. Biosyn Corporation has been the market leader in KLH for the
past couple of decades (source 26), and it's been in business since 1984. We reached out
to BioSyn's president, Shammana Muddukrishna, who was nice enough to speak with us
via phone. When I asked whether or not Stellar had a monopoly on KLH, he laughed.
From our conversation with Mr. Muddukrishna, we were told the following items that
should alarm SBOTF shareholders:


BioSyn got its first approval in 1997 to use KLH to treat bladder cancer, "which Stellar
is trying to mimic now."
It has supplied KLH for "almost 90% of the clinical trials that have taken place to date
and the ones that are continuing now."
If "all of the clinical trials going on now are approved, [BioSyn] will have more than
necessary to supply."
[BioSyn] has "interacted with almost all of the major pharmaceutical companies
working with KLH and they continue to use our KLH."


To add insult to injury, when told that Stellar has the capabilities to produce 1,500
grams/year, BioSyn's president said, "We already produce much more than that."


Summary and Investment Thesis


What we have here is the case of a yet another company with a "good story", but a
company that's also significantly overvalued, in our opinion. Like any other speculative
company in the biotech sector, this is a case where there's the prospect of a win in the
distant future, but we believe SBOTF to be years from tangible results and steady
fundamentals. Until they reach that point, dilution is likely going to be a reality as the
company fights to fund itself, like any other speculative biotech.


We were pleased that VP Mark McPartland took time out of his day to have a call with us,
and we in no way believe that he was being anything but honest and realistic to us when
we spoke to him. He came off as extremely knowledgeable and passionate about what the
company is trying to do, and he invited us out to visit the company - an offer that we may
take him up on in the future. He seemed to know exactly what we were talking about when
we questioned him about the promotions, and when we suggested that the stock price
may have gotten away from being realistic, he didn't come out and disagree with us.


The unfortunate circumstance that this company has found itself in, however, is one where
the stock has been pushed up to an unrealistic valuation, and the company has made the
mistake of not aggressively going after the parties involved in the false and misleading

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 31/48


promotion.


We believe SBOTF to be far overvalued, and we place a value on the company near what
the company placed upon itself during its September 2013 PIPE - somewhere around
$0.35-$0.50.


Now that the promotion is wearing off and the true "niche" of SBOTF's business is
exposed as one that has substantial competition with far more production capability, we
believe SBOTF will resume its pre-promotion decline, eventually making its way back to
$0.70 and resuming its downward move from there.


We expect the descent to be further catalyzed by continued dilution from the company in
coming months, as well as by lack of intrinsic fundamentals to hold the company afloat.
The company, as of its last quarterly report, has $11.2 million in shareholders' equity,
which equates to roughly $0.15 per share in equity.


So far, SBOTF has failed to achieve any substantial revenue, and is currently trading at a
price-to-sales ratio of 178.25. If "grant revenues" are excluded from total revenues, we are
left with an astounding price-to-sales ratio of 403.88. Assigning a generous multiple to
these intrinsic values, we believe a $0.35-$0.50 price target to be a reasonable and fair
measure to value the company's future prospects at this point.


Investors buying at these levels should assume caution; with Stellar Biotechnologies, we
believe we've seen the pump, and are now as is often the case, just waiting on the
inevitable dump.

I agree with Mike, I read 2 very positive articles on SA on Stellar, one was written in Nov/13 and another
Mar/14. I bought some shares partly based on those articles. Now we have this article really slamming the
company. I have several questions? 
1. Are the numerous trials mentioned on the Stellar website legit?

2. If legit, and at least one succeeds, where is the supply of KLH going to come from? Biosyn? 
3. If Biosyn, don't they harvest and kill the mollusk to extract the KLH? If so, is the only supply off the CA
coast, or was that a myth? If not a myth, and there is a large demand for KLH, how long would it be until the
US Gov. or CA gov outlaws the harvesting of the mollusk? 
4. The power point going with the CEO's recent presentation in NY to many Wall Street insiders, had in it that
they were attempting to uplist to the NASDAQ. If this is a false statement, why would they put it in print in
front of many of the smartest minds in NY? Wouldn't it be a SEC violation to make such a statement, if not
true? 
5. Did the authors read the other Seeking Alpha article that seem very positive? If so, who is right and who is
wrong? I don't know if there is a moderator on Seeking Alpha, if so, how can there be at least 3 article on the
same company in less than a year, with two being very positive and this one be very negative? just
wondering?

Well done, nice job. I went long last year at 1.70 but when I was able to collect more information about the company I
realised the mistake but I thought there could be some future pump&dump scheme so I hold my position and here
comes the pump&dump scheme you have described. I dumped as soon as I got back up to 1.70. Glad I'm out of this.

Great Job here. I once owned shares in SBOTF, but couldn't sell fast enough after i saw the pro money "liquid metal"

@BuyersStrike for tweeting the link before it was shut down. I am happy to see that you agree with my opinion that
the company is a victim in this mess. Also agree that the company has long term potential.

"I strongly believe the company is not a mere victim." ... you are completely right! ...


when you have the CEO stating false information at a Conference (R/R) ... it is clearly a sign the company is
involved in the stock Price manipulation (Or at least ... it's a sign to me).

Good points, the Sigma issue is a concern. Would love to see what pro money would have said about the

Also, after doing some DD of my own, I copied this directly from the Biosyn website....Biosyns KLH is for
INVESTIGATIONAL uses only..


"Customers using biosyn hemocyanin products for clinical (immune status or other clinical applications) use are
responsible for ensuring that the biosyn hemocyanin is appropriate for their use. Since the biosyn hemocyanin and
immunocyanin are investigational products, it is limited to INVESTIGATIONAL use."

Studies have shown that different forms of KLH have distinctly different structural properties and, importantly, may
have different inductive effects on the immune system.


Further, studies have reported that the culture, handling and processing of KLH can impact isoform structure and
immunogenicity.


So, my question to the writer is, what form of KLH does Biosyn sell compared to the KLH that Stellar sells? You
compare the two in your article but fail to identify the structural properties associated with each companies KLH.


Also, what safeguards does Biosyn use when extracting their KLH from the Limpets?

ANOTHER LIE told by SBOTF to investors ... is that .. all the competitors are bad guys .. and kill the limpets
... lol lol lol ...


This is not true. From you post, it seems to me you are reading a script. Maybe you need to perform further
DD other than the DD MissionIR and MoneyMapPress delivered. No?


24 Sep 2014, 05:11 AM


stellar defense
Unemon1..explain what is the lie, and also how is the KLH extracted by Biosyn? I would like to know how the
KLH is extracted and the limpets are used and either kept alive by Biosyn or do the limpets die? please site
your information so I can follow up...thank you


24 Sep 2014, 10:10 AM


Phildog
stellar defense - go to the Biosyn website and click on the KLH pages. They claim that they have been
extracting the KLH without harming the limpets for years. They also say that they return the limpets to the sea
where they recover in a more healthy way than they do via aquaculture methods.


I'm still hanging on to my Stellar stock in hopes that this will pass. I'm close to my cost basis. Ugh.

StellarDefense, I am quite disappointed at you. You should perform your own DD before making any claim.
Your post clearly shows that you have failed to perform the most basic DD. Had you done your own DD
before replying to this article, you would have found out that BioSyn uses non-lethal methods to extract KLH
from the limpets.

Looking at its balance sheet, cash flow, income statement and notes to the accounts, I can see that there are a
number of other glaring red flags with this company. They can be spotted very quickly if you know what to look for.


24 Sep 2014, 10:50 AM


TrixieBlues
I find it interesting that the author skates up to the edge -- but never quite over the line -- of accusing the promo
writers of illegal activity (pump 'n' dump) when in fact, those companies don't actually have a position in the stock
itself. Whereas the author is actually SHORT this position and apparently was able to move the stock down based on
this article. So, one has to ask -- who really has something to gain here?


24 Sep 2014, 02:40 PM


scott nelms
I notice many comments on the recent article, seem to think anyone who questions the recent article is either a
company insider or someone who only reads the Stellar website. I think it only fair to post a Seeking Alpha article on
Stellar posted here.... less than 6 months back that has an entirely different prospective.


This article pasted from Seeking Alpha seems to contridict the current article. In this article, it clearly states the
mollusk dies when the KLH is extracted as well as several other differences. In an earlier SA article, published in
Nov13, it also had a far more positive view than yesterday's article. So if we read all 3 articles posted in SA, how does
an investor know which parts of which article are corrent and which are false?

Stellar Biotechnologies: Low Risk Biotech Provider With Significant Upside


Summary 
• Stellar's main product (KLH) is involved in 20 active clinical trials. 
• Studies include cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, arthritis and AIDS. 
• Stellar's valuation is only $125 mm vs. peers valued in the billions.


(Editors' Note: Stellar Biotechnologies trades on the TSX Venture Exchange,symbol KLH.V, with average daily volume
of C$350,000.)


Stellar Biotechnologies (OTCQB:SBOTF) (KLH.V) is the world leader in sustainable manufacturing of Keyhole Limpet
Hemocyanin (KLH). Although KLH has been known as an important immune-stimulating protein (a substance that
naturally induces an immune response) for over 40 years, its role as an ideal carrier molecule for vaccine antigens
(substances that promote the generation of antibody and cell-mediated immune responses) against cancers and
infectious agents is the basis for the fastest growing new class of drugs known as active immunotherapies.


KLH is currently involved in a mind-bending 20 active human clinical trials where many of the world's finest drug
developers are seeking to cure dozens of serious diseases. These include Alzheimer's, Arthritis, Cancer (over 20
different types, including a late stage 3 clinical trial for breast cancer), Lupus, HIV, MS, Asthma, hypertension, etc.


If even one of these new drugs go into production, the world's only sustainable KLH supply is from Stellar; they have
revolutionized the KLH industry, turning this vital, natural protein into a renewable, quality resource.


KLH


Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) is a potent immunogenic high-molecular-weight protein; i.e. a substance that
naturally induces an immune response. KLH is a highly effective T-dependent carrier protein that induces MHC Class
I and Class II-restricted immune responses via antigen presenting cells.


Sources: company unless otherwise noted


Active Immunotherapy uses a patient's own immune system by first activating then training it to recognize and kill
tumor cells. This treatment may provide a viable alternative to chemotherapy or other therapies, dramatically
improving quality of life.


Please review the selected list of active clinical trials below; note that these are not all present Stellar KLH users, but
we believe they will become customers upon drug approval given Stellar's unique position.


Potent yet safe in humans, KLH is highly prized as a critical component of certain therapeutic vaccines including ones
for lymphoma, bladder, breast, colon and other cancers.


In essence, the KLH-based drug alerts the immune system to something it doesn't see - like with cancer (such as the
sugars on the surface of cells not normally seen) or a tumor. In this way, the body's own immune response is
triggered.


KLH-based drugs seem to work best with smaller cancers or tumors, thus would be most applicable either in early
stages or, for example, after a tumor was removed, thus effecting a final cure or prevent recurrence.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 38/48


While it is still a long way away, and we recognize it would be virtually impossible to develop a clinical study, the
scientific theory seems valid that a KLH-based drug could act as a vaccine and prevent cancers in high-risk potential
patients avoiding the horrors associated with diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian or cervical. We are certainly
hoping for such. In this regard the Asian markets offer more promise in that users are not so restricted and are willing
to try preventative medicine. For example, those determined as pre-disposed to certain cancers may opt for a KLH-
vaccine - recent news regarding actress Angelina Jolie's preventative double mastectomy have brought this issue to
attention.


The growing advancement of KLH-conjugated therapeutic vaccines and KLH-based diagnostic products is rapidly
increasing the demand for GMP (pharmaceutical grade) KLH.

Background


Founded in 1999, Stellar was initially funded through grants totaling $7 million from both the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).


Stellar has generated KLH-related revenues since 2001; its customers and partners include multi-national
pharmaceutical companies, world-renowned laboratories and research centers, as well as biotechnology companies
and vaccine developers.


The Giant Keyhole Limpet can only be found on the coast between Central California and Northern Baja California.
Source: klhsite.org


Stellar specializes in the production of KLH which is refined from the hemocyanin of the rare ocean mollusk,
Megathura crenulata (the California giant keyhole limpet). The extreme complexity and very large size of KLH
glycoprotein make it unsuitable for synthetic production; therefore it must be purified from its natural source, which is
rare and diminishing in population.


Stellar has developed important intellectual property which relates to aquaculture technologies, spawning, selection
and maintenance of the limited natural source, as well as processing, purification and engineering of specific GMP-
grade stabilized formulations.


In a fortunate stroke, Stellar acquired faculties at the Port Hueneme Naval base as part of a base closure process,
which gives them direct aquaculture access to the Pacific Ocean. The Company believes this was a once-in-a-lifetime
chance to obtain a facility on the coast of California having direct access to the Pacific Ocean, smack in the middle of
the limpets natural breeding grounds. With all permits in place, Stellar can now provide clean, traceable KLH from
native source to finished product - a world-wide exclusive.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 39/48


In 2012, Stellar Biotechnologies achieved an industry milestone in aquaculture science by successfully controlling the
complete life cycle of multiple generations of the Giant Keyhole Limpet.


This section is very important:


We are aware of only two other companies in the world that provide KLH in GMP form. One, a Fortune 1000
company, Sigma-Aldrich, already uses Stellar's KLH… the other literally sends divers into the ocean to capture the
limpets.


They extract the KLH - then the limpet dies.


Source: Stellar


Since GMP KLH (in clinical trial volume) sells for between $20,000 and $50,000 per gram, that is one valuable limpet.
However, we do not believe ocean harvesting is a sustainable model and will most likely quickly exterminate the
limpet population if even one new drug goes into production, especially since there is no batch control and harvesting
is subject to natural events. In fact, we would expect the State of California to ban or restrict wild limpet harvesting
before such a tragedy, as with the abalone or sea cucumber.


For this reason, Stellar's approach, although still perhaps a year or two away before the major demand appears, is
unique in that 1) their patented process removes the KLH without killing the limpet and 2) they already have patent-
pending re-production process and multi-generation breeding success at the aquaculture facility. It would take 5 to 10
years to replicate this facility, given the difficulty of permitting in California, and probably $20 million, giving Stellar a
considerable advantage.


C. Diff Immunotherapies


Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a major and growing cause of mortality and morbidity in hospital patients. It's a bacteria
which is normally present in the intestine, but which can overgrow as a result of antibiotic use. It causes severe
diarrhea and life-threatening intestinal conditions such as colitis.


C. diff related treatments in the U.S. and Europe are estimated to cost a total of over $7 billion. Effective treatment
would not only provide a substantial revenue stream for Stellar, but also bring relief to the 300,000 new cases that
hospitals are seeing annually, up three-fold from just a decade ago.


The patented technology allows Stellar exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell human vaccines to treat C.
diff infections, from the Stellar technology.


The potential market size of this application alone would most likely be worth 5x Stellar's current $128 mm valuation.


Amaran Biotechnology Partnership


Taiwan-based Amaran invested $5 million in Stellar's September 2013 financing. KLH is a key ingredient in OBI
Pharma's OBI-822 Active Immunotherapy drugs: 
1. Metastaic Breast Cancer: Phase II/III trials in U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, India, Hong Kong. 
2. Ovarian Cancer: Phase I/II for ovarian cancer in Taiwan
5/23/2018 Stellar Biotechnologies: We've Seen The Pump, Now Here Comes The Dump - Stellar Biotechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SBOT) | Seeking …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 40/48


From the OBI website: "OBI is also devoted to developing next generation active immunotherapies for difficult to treat
cancers, including lung, prostate, pancreatic, stomach, and ovarian."


We will have more on this specific trial in a further update, however, this could be the 1st "blockbuster" for Stellar, and
we suspect this is the reason Amaran invested - a smart move to keep themselves 'close' to the only supply for such
a critical ingredient.


Near-term catalysts and valuation objective


In addition to news from over 20 active clinical trials, from our conversations with management, we believe Stellar is
active in seeking additional corporate partners. As the new class of therapeutic vaccines moves towards market, we
would expect increased sourcing interest. Certainly, Stellar is getting close to achieving a "critical mass." As you can
see in the chart below, the commercial potential is understandably enormous.


Given Stellar's current 78 million shares issued equates to a valuation of $125 million, and that the potential revenues
from even one new drug could be over $100 million…and given that biotech companies routinely sell for 10 X sales,
our estimate of "billion dollar potential" may turn out ultimately as very, very low.


Even one drug showing evidence of an impending move from clinical trial to manufacture would be enough, in our
opinion, to raise the valuation to the $300-$500 million range. This could occur even if a smaller drug, such as
Celldex's compound targeting glioblastoma (an aggressive form of brain tumor), currently in phase 3 trials, were to be
approved. Although the KLH-related revenues to Stellar may be only $10-$20 million per annum, we believe it adds to
the overall creditability and encourages additional development.


In the chart, please note the market size for some of the KLH-based drugs under clinical trial and the estimated
revenues for Stellar. Our point being, only one or two of these is needed to be a "company maker."


For some reason, Stellar's IPO was via entry into the Canadian markets and the stock languished mostly unknown
until 2013, when it finally started moving. In 2014, we expect Stellar to list their shares on a US exchange - basically
as soon as the stock trades over $2. We would encourage investors to buy ahead of this event as most biotech funds
and investors do not buy shares listed on the Canadian venture exchange. We suspect Stellar could really pick up
some traction and the shares move to the $3 level in short order.


Indeed, we saw Stellar present to a full house at a recent institutional investor conference and suspect they will have
an increasing professional audience.


The early bird gets the worms


Many years ago one of our clients funded a start-up called Cheniere Energy (LNG). Although Cheniere is worth $12
billion today, we will vouch that, in the early days, there was no "blessing" from CNBC's Jim Cramer and nary an
"analyst" in sight.


Cheniere shares have gone from $1 to $54 since the '08 crash, primarily because they locked up the best-located
properties for a new, unknown industry - the manufacture and transport of liquefied natural gas . By the time the
market and competitors caught on, Cheniere owned the best property; the majors (like Chevron) had to come and
grovel for a deal.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 41/48


Sure, natural gas is a world apart from curing cancer, Alzheimer's, or AIDS, but Stellar is similar in that they have
obtained a prime physical location and an early-mover advantage, which puts them at least 5 years ahead of any
sustainable competitor. Stellar thus could become the "go to" source for an entire new class of drugs, in addition to a
"play the field" approach for investors.


Risk Factors


Because it's too complex to be synthetically created, KLH must be harvested. Stellar has the sole aquaculture facility
for the GMP production of KLH; however, it is possible that a synthetic method to produce KLH will be created which
could dramatically affect Stellar's future sales and earnings. In addition, other competitive aquaculture facilities may
be developed, and even though Stellar's limpets are raised in a safe, out of ocean environment, they still are living
creatures and may be subject to disease.


Probably the biggest risk to Stellar could come from an Asian or other competitor who steal some limpets and try to
raise them in Asia. However, Stellar's proprietary production process tracks every gram from every limpet and
provides a detailed record for GMP standards, and we do not think legitimate KLH users or Big Pharma will be buying
black market bootleg supplies.


The biotech industry has had a remarkable run for some time and all bull markets end. This could be disruptive to
Stellar's share price. However, our thesis for investing is that Stellar's valuation, compared to any peers, is so low it
should do well regardless over the next several years as more clinical trials morph into drugs. In this regard we think it
highly unlikely that all 20 clinical trials fail, but it could happen and also some sort of controversy could arise as part of
these clinical trials.

Conclusion


Stellar is an entirely different company than when we first looked at them 3 years ago; progress has been enormous
and we see no reason for that to not continue.


Stellar has a unique, proprietary niche within the biotech industry - as the world's sole sustainable KLH provider, an
essential ingredient in a whole new class of drugs.


With nearly $17 million in cash, Stellar is in a fine shape as the monthly burn rate is only $400K-$500K - they are not
a cash guzzler. Stellar does not pay for the clinical studies involving the KLH-based therapies, which we believe offers
investors significantly less risk than peer biotech companies.


In the near term we expect these drugs to move forward. We also believe investors have a natural bridge ahead, in
that at $2 USD the shares should qualify for a full US listing, thus opening Stellar to a whole new world of professional
investors. We could envision a rather rapid ascent (upon US listing) to $3 - given comparable biotech valuations - and
given that Stellar is the world's exclusive key supplier in a whole new class of drugs.


With only 78 million shares outstanding, our $7 target price is a market valuation just over $500 mm, which is a price
where we ultimately believe one of the dozens of cash rich biotechs - with inflated shares - would seek to own such a
valuable supply; a likely exit, in our opinion.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 42/48


Biotech investors may wish to take some profits in the more richly-valued names and allocate the capital into Stellar.
The next two years look promising, whichever way the market goes.

Of real interest to me is the fact that the company has not responded to this article.


That tells me that they know the allegations are true as a true believer would fight them tooth and nail. There is
nothing on the website disputing the article. Or perhaps the company policy is to not discuss negative articles. If that
is the case, it is a major error on their part as the longer these allegations stay out there unanswered, the more fixed
as truth they will become in the market's mind.


This company has been pumped relentlessly, Nick Hodge in particular pumped it long and hard, resulting in a share
price climb.


Interesting to find out now that the mollusks can be harvested without killing them, which is contrary to what the
pumpers flat out stated and the company implied very strongly.


With all the facts brought out in the article, I predict that this company will be shorted into oblivion, led by the market
makers. It will be like taking candy from a baby.

Companies rarely respond to lies. Mollusks can be harvested without killing them. I've visited the company
and seen their operation. If you'd take the time to make a visit, you'd find out the same. And as to what you
say are facts in the GeoTeam's biased bashing, most are not facts. Here's just a few things they left out of
their report.....


What's never mentioned, coincidentally, by the GeoTeam that's short are the primary reasons Stellar will
ultimately be the winner in this market. 
It doesn't mention that Biosyn still sends divers down to get their Limpets. It doesn't mention that they have to
return them to their native habitat and that no one knows whether they live or not. It doesn't mention that
Biosyn doesn't have a sustainable population of Limpets that it grows and reproduces on land... because
Biosyn can't do that... only Stellar can. It doesn't say whether Biosyn can extract the Limpet blood without
killing it — Stellar is the only one with a patent for this (US 6852338).


It doesn't mention whether Biosyn can control the quality of its KLH by controlling the entire lifecycle of the
Limpet. Biosyn can't, only Stellar can... and patents have been filed for that.


It doesn't mention if Biosyn has ever controlled the source so much as to have multiple generations of land-
bred Limpets under its control. Biosyn can't... only Stellar's done that.


It doesn't mention that the California Fish & Wildlife Department will likely shut down the wild Limpet fishery. It
doesn't mention what Biosyn's “capacity” will be when that happens.


It doesn't mentioned the study done with Stellar's KLH by Amgen, which concluded that Stellar's product was
more pure and predictable than that from wild Limpets. And it certainly doesn't mention that that's the kind of
KLH drug companies will want for commercial deployment.


The last bogus claim is that Stellar's financing last September was at $0.34, allowing “lucky” investors to get
rich. As the press release from September 10, 2013 reads: Each Unit, sold for US$1.05, comprises one share
of Stellar's common stock and one half of a share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a "Warrant").


Full stop. Saying it was at $0.34 is a flat-out lie.


A few more things to tie together and wrap up...


We were pleased that VP Mark McPartland took time out of his day to have a call with us, and we in no way
believe that he was being anything but honest and realistic to us when we spoke to him. He came off as
extremely knowledgeable and passionate about what the company is trying to do. I would urge anyone on the
SeekingAlpha web site to call Mark McParkland for yourself. Mark is Stellar's VP Corp. Development and
Communications. He can be reached directly at 805-488-2800 ext. 103. He is passionate about his job and
he is an expert's expert in the biotech space. Rather than listening to people who have their own agenda, call
Mark and then draw your own conclusions!

And it also doesn't mention the fact that marine life is dying off the west coast. What will Biosyn do when they can't
find any more living limpets as Stellar is the only company 'farming' them?


http://bit.ly/1okgDAn


the first few lines from this article if you'd prefer not to click on the link is:


A grisly horror show is playing out along the West Coast of North America. Remains of millions of dead and dying sea
stars, commonly known as starfish, litter the shoreline from Vancouver to San Diego. 
Those stars are the victims of a swift and brutal illness. First, the animal’s body deflates, as if drained of all its water.
Then the trademark arms begin to curl, detaching from rocks. White lesions appear, like festering canker sores. Then
the star explodes as organs rupture though the body wall. The arms fall off. Ultimately, the sea star dissolves, as if
melted by acid, disintegrating into goo. 
Researchers in Washington state first noticed signs of the so-called “wasting syndrome” in June 2013 during routine
monitoring of populations of bright purple and orange Pisaster ochraceus sea stars. The outbreak continued through
the summer, spreading down into California’s central and southern coasts. Scientists hoped it would subside during
the winter. It did not.


2 more articles about the die off:

The talk of a die off is just that, talk, when Stellar reports it as a material event on Edgar or Sedar, the market will take
notice.


I will take the article's valuation any day over the doubters here in the comment section. You can't just value a warrant
off of the shelf prospectus, you have to dig deep into the fine print and look at the actual warrant agreement(whatever
the exact name is) and study the fine print. In this case, the operative phrase is Black Scholls. The calculations
displayed and the methods use to arrive at the valuation in my mind trump someone here parroting the line from a
news release. Stellar hasn't deigned to respond to his math so I will choose to believe the writer who is putting
significant capital on the line shorting this stock.


Regarding the statement that the company shouldn't respond to lies- that is absolute hogwash. In this day and age of
tweets and Facebook postings going viral, a negative social media event can bring a company to its' knees, they need
to respond forcefully or such an event could severely impact the company valuation, and with it its' investors.


And since Stellar needs private placement funds regularly, like we humans need our blood, to survive, keeping those
investors unworried should be a priority, unless they feel that there are enough suckers out there to replace the
current batch if needed.


The main point from the article which has not been mentioned by the doubting Thomas's here pertains to the actual
production by Stellar vs. Biosyn. Biosyn quite frankly is beating them like a drum, like a redheaded stepchild. And they

only 46 grams sold in fiscal year 2013?

I've got Pancreatic Cancer, and have had the Whipple Procedure ( Major Surgery) on April 27th, 2007, and if Stellar
Biotechnologies (OTCQB:SBOTF) (KLH.V), would like to use me, and, or my body for a viable test, i would be
available at your convenience. I'm with you Stellar for the long haul. What you all have been working on is nothing
short of a miracle, in fact it is a miracle.

Complete con job. I asked Mr. Robinson to clearly explain what I was getting if I purchased "Blocks" of 100 or 1000 for
100 and 1000 dollars respectively as recommended by him. Was I getting shares or what exactly was I getting. Could
these blocks be turned into 1 dollar shares etc ? The reply that I received was that they didn't give independent
financial advice and I could have my subscription of 1,950 dollars returned. Looks like I touched a BIG NERVE!

The only thing you need to know about this stock is who the main investor is and check his track record on google.
Every single stock he has invested in has tanked or gone bankrupt...after a spectacular run-up, of course. Mind you,
skimming the take on the ride up can be profitable ;-). Just be in early and out fast.

Nick hodge keeps promoting this stock($SPOTF) can he be that wrong month after month after month?Stellar
Biotechnologies (TSX-V: KLH)(OTC: SBOTF)


Stellar is simply playing the waiting game, waiting for the first approval of a KLH-based drug, which grows closer
every day.


The two closest are Celldex's therapies for glioblastoma (brain tumors), which are in Phase II and III, and OBI
Pharma's OBI-822, a breast cancer vaccine that is in Phase III in Asia, and which has already made an investment in
Stellar to secure its long-term supply. Celldex's therapy has been given fast-track status by the FDA — the first KLH-
based drug to receive that designation and set a great precedent for all the others.


We know the story here... No other company is able to provide the highly controlled commercial quantities of KLH that
the pharma world will soon need.


Stellar's as cheap as it's been since last July at ~C$0.91. It ran to $2.50 last summer.


Stellar is a buy at market price. 6/5/15
