Huabao Suspends Trading After Falling on Short-Seller
Report
Huabao - a Chinese flavours and fragrances company in Hong Kong - has suspended trading after
falling on a short-seller report. To quote a Business Week article: 


 
Huabao International Holdings Ltd. (336), a maker of flavors and fragrances used in
cigarettes, suspended trading in Hong Kong after the stock plunged on a short-seller
report that questioned its finances. 


Huabao fell 8.1 percent to HK$3.98 at the close in Hong Kong yesterday after short
seller Anonymous Analytics said the company “reports absurdly high margins, which
industry sources say should not be possible.” 


The company didn’t give a reason for the suspension. In a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing late on April 24, Huabao said it wasn’t aware of any reasons for the changes in its
share price and trading volume.


 
Readers of this blog should be familiar with the stock as I blogged about it here. I also blogged about
the (now in excess of a) billion US dollars the CEO had cashed out and the derivative transactions
that she had used to do so. 
 
The suggestions in my blog post - and a few other things - were covered in the short-seller report. 
 
 
 
 
John Hempton 
 
 
Disclosure: We remain short this company - albeit in modest quantity.

Nice work. That looked an interesting short. My only concern was can you close the short
given the tendency of HKEX stocks to remain suspended forever. I remember thinking
2339.hk Norstar Founders Group looked too good to be true. It got suspended and
remained so for years afterwards!  
 
I'm still arguing with IB about the mark taken on a short of yours - Universal Travel Group
- why it can't be written down is annoying!

Hi John kudos for the good work from you and AA. Base on the report from AA I am
pretty sure HuaBao is a fraud but I can't understand why they are able to generate such
fabulous financial statements. Thanks for your help to clear my doubts

Fab financials are because when Deloitte signs off on them, it's really a local firm that is
affiliated with Deloitte, and may not conform to international audit standards. It's just one
way that rampant fraud in China stocks is allowed to occur. See also

Anonymous didn't mention th epoint you made in October about the derivative
transaction. Makes me wonder if some idiot IB is long all of her stock having sold a
devillishly clever put call strategy!
