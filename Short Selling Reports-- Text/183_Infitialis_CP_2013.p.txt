Canadian Pacific Railway: Off The Tracks After Ackman

Introduction


Investors in industries deemed popular or in vogue by the general public have a
propensity to engage in folly often resulting in the manifestation of valuation bubbles for
the pioneering companies. As the great Charles Mackay wrote in 1841: "Men, it has been
well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover
their senses slowly, and one by one." Nearly two hundred years later, these words are still
relevant as even nowadays men find it difficult to act against the herd while the herd goes
mad.


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in an effort to identify bubbles
before they implode. Our track record of success speaks for itself. In this report, we will be
exposing folly on the scale of our prior report on Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
(NASDAQ:MLNX) in September 2012 when the firm's shares were trading at a shocking
$119/share.


Canadian Pacific Introduction


Like Bill Ackman's legendary bicycle ride on the Montauk Highway last summer, the
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (the "Canadian Pacific" or the "Company") (NYSE:CP)
share price has recently spurted ahead of its comparables in an unsustainable fashion as
it has more than doubled to $126.96/share from $60.62/share before Ackman started his

activist campaign less than 18 months ago. While Canadian Pacific's recent share price
performance is impressive, investors may soon be yelping in pain like Mr. Ackman when
his Montauk bike-ride pace faded and debilitating leg-cramps set in.


Like its peer Canadian National Railway Company (CNI) [TSX: CNR] Canadian Pacific is
a Class 1, transcontinental mainline railway. A core tenet of the mainline rail business is
funneling as much rail traffic from feeders and connectors as possible onto a high-density
mainline railway network. Thus, the two main divers of railway profitability/cash-flow are
carload volumes and cost controls, both of which are intended to be maximized through
the economies of scale in the mainline business model. In addition, the railroading
business in general has high sustaining capital intensity, as both the physical track and the
rolling stock (locomotives and rail cars) require frequent maintenance and replacement to
sustain efficient and safe operations.


Canadian Pacific's potential economies-of-scale are significantly limited relative to its
peers because the Company operates a significantly smaller network of only 14,400 miles
of track through predominately rural areas with approximately 55% of the geographic
footprint in Canada and the remainder in the United States. For comparison, Canadian
National Railway operates the largest rail network and the only transcontinental network in
North America with over 20,600 route miles of track. Moreover, from an operational
perspective, Canadian Pacific is less competitive than its peers as it has a higher average
track grades because of its Canadian Rockies crossings (estimated 2-3%) which
significantly increases its fuel costs (with limited pass-through ability to customers), has
less United States connectivity, is more northerly, and has a higher mileage concentration
in Western Canada (~40% of volumes). The latter two factors drive increased winter
network outages due to snow, flooding, and landslides. Moreover, the steeper average
track grades and mountainous geographic footprint increases the capital intensity of the
business relative to its peers and makes it more difficult for even the most talented
management teams to affect operational improvements, such as average train velocities
and locomotive dwell times.


Recently, Canadian Pacific was subject to a proxy battle (publicly launched 10/28/11 when
shares were trading at $60.62/share) which was initiated by Mr. William Ackman of
Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. of New York ("Pershing Square"). Pershing
Square believed Canadian Pacific was ineffectively operating the railway and successfully
removed the prior C-suite management team as well as several sympathetic board
members. Pershing Square then was able to select Mr. E. Hunter Harrison as the new
Chairman of the Board and CEO for Canadian Pacific on 06/28/12. Mr. E. Hunter Harrison

is best known for his prior leadership of the Canadian National Railway Company and
Illinois Central Railroad Company, but his recent track-record is of more concern with the
$4bn bankruptcy of Dynegy Inc. and the independent finding of a "fraudulent conveyance"
of certain of the firm's key assets while he served as Chairman and CEO. Pershing
Square owns 24.2mm shares of CP, approximately 13.9% as of 12/31/12, for a current
market value of ~$3.1bn, or >30% of Pershing Square's total AUM.


Interestingly, Mr. William Ackman's subsequent activist campaign on Herbalife (NYSE:
HLF), which utilized the same techniques as his CP battle including a massive conference
presentation and extensive media engagement, almost immediately blew-up in his face as
the market quickly poked significant holes in his thesis and took a countervailing position,
driving the share price above the level before Pershing Square's presentation. While this
dynamic may take longer to play out for the CP situation, it seems the market could
quickly revert once these and other flaws are exposed in the Pershing Square investment
rationale for the Company.


Canadian Pacific Summary Valuation Metrics:


Interestingly, during the proxy contest, one of the purported failures highlighted by
Pershing Square of the prior management team of Canadian Pacific was its 10/30/08
acquisition of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation ("DM&E") for
~$1.8bn at an 18.0X LTM EBIT multiple. Astute investors would note that because of the
recent run-up in Canadian Pacific's share price, the Company is currently valued at a
shocking three full turns higher at 21.1x LTM EBIT.


Investment Thesis: SHORT Canadian Pacific


Because of the recent and unsuitable run-up in equity valuation, Canadian Pacific is a
compelling short opportunity because of 1) an irrational market assumption regarding the
timing and feasibility of the railroad operational improvement plan, 2) sub-optimal
corporate governance oversight, and 3) impending Pershing Square liquidation of CP
common stock following the implosion of their recent J.C. Penney Company, Inc.

(NYSE:JCP) investment and limited partner redemptions following their bolloxing of the
Herbalife situation coupled with a purported SEC investigation into Pershing Square's
trading activity.


The current irrational market behavior appears to exist because many investors have
been blindly riding the coat-tails of Pershing Square's pre-2012 success on such names
as MBIA Inc.(NYSE:MBI) and General Growth Properties Inc. (NYSE:GGP); which
conveniently overlooks Ackman's prior implosion of Gotham Partners and failed activist
investments in Borders and Target. These primarily Canadian-based individuals, funds
and sell-side analysts are largely playing a momentum trade, not a fundamental
investment, in CP shares. Further, in their blind following of Bill Ackman, it seems that they
are quick to forget that Pershing Square's position has been completely illiquid to date,
due to the size of the position and reputation risks of selling shortly after installing their
own management team. Finally, the risk of a merger take-out, long rumored, seems
extremely diminished at this point in time because of the exceedingly rich valuation of CP
relative to its peers and anti-trust regulatory concerns in Canada and the United States.


Canadian Pacific Turn-Around Plan is Fatally Flawed


CP shares are currently pricing in full achievement, with no room for shortfalls or delays,
of an aggressive turn-around plan. This plan contemplates both achieving an Operating
Ratio ("OR") of ~65% by 2016 and generating a revenue CAGR of over 6% from 2012-
2016. The lowest annual OR that CP has achieved in the last 20 years was 75.3%,
approximately 1,000bps above the OR that the stock is currently discounting and also the
most recent 4q12 performance by Mr. E. Hunter Harrison. Moreover, CP was on the only
Class 1 railroad to have significantly lower train velocity on their network, YoY, in January
2013. CP is clearly trading as a "story" instead of an investment based on the underlying
operational performance of the business at this time.

Of particular note, the market seems to believe CP can transition from a bottom decile OR
performer to a market-leading firm in less than four years. Moreover, CP Management and
sell-side estimates earnings estimates are paired with exceedingly aggressive CAPEX
intensity targets, as forecasted CAPEX spend is to be below both CP and CNI precedents.
Simply put, in railroading, it is difficult to increase operational efficiency without sustained
investment in new equipment and technology to both capture incremental efficiency
improvements in new technologies and avoid equipment malfunctions and delays
associated with service outages and delays.


Blood on the Tracks: Oil-on-Rails Future Potential is Over-Played


In addition to a dramatic operational improvement, CP bulls have priced-in significant
revenue growth from crude oil-on-rails transport as oil/gas producers choose to ship
liquids from Alberta and North Dakota via rail versus being subject to heavy negative
pricing differentials on the constrained existing pipeline capacity. Mr. E. Hunter Harrison,
CP's Chairman and CEO, has done little to temper investors' expectations, declaring on

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 6/28


the 10/24/12 investors call, 'If you put it [oil-on-rails projects] all together, it'll make people
forget the Gold Rush in 1849." CP has attempted to capitalize on the boom in crude
transport, forecasting its ~$90mm in CAPEX will allow it to transport nearly 70,000
carloads a year by 2014, up from the only approximately 500 carloads in 2009.


Because of some current pipeline capacity constraints in moving liquids out of Alberta and
North Dakota, the crude oil pricing differential to PADD III (Gulf Coast) has been
~$30/barrel, making rail-transport a price-competitive alternative at this time. However, as
the Keystone XL, Northern Gateway, and TransMountain pipeline expansion projects
move closer to fruition, astute investors should remember that, on a mile-for-mile basis,
pipeline transport of crude is roughly half the cost of transport via rail and is significantly
safer with lower probability of catastrophic spills or leaks. Moreover, the pricing dislocation
between crude and natural gas has significantly crimped demand for coal, further limiting
CP's potential for consolidated volume and revenue growth.


Just last week on 03/27/13, CP demonstrated the significant dangers of shipping crude oil
via rail when 14 cars on its 94-car train heading for the Chicago area crashed off the CP
tracks approximately 150 miles northwest of Minneapolis near the town of Parkers Prairie.
The derailed crude tanks released a gusher of more than 30,000 gallons of untreated
crude oil onto the prairie, shutting the rail line for an estimated 2-3 days, and requiring a
massive remediation effort to clean up the literal river of crude oil. Luckily, the derailing
happened in a relatively rural area and the spilled crude did not combust, but this is a
poignant example of the potential risks of shipping highly volatile cargos on relatively old
tracks. Moreover, it reiterates the importance of the continuous CAPEX investment
required to ensure tracks and trains remain in safe and efficient operating condition.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 7/28


As an analogy to the current oil-on-rails mania, investors would be well-served to review
CP's disastrous 10/30/08 acquisition of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad
Corporation ("DM&E") for ~$1.8bn at an 18.0X LTM EBIT multiple. At the time of the
acquisition, bullish investors were excited about CP's possibly to start hauling Powder
River Basin ("PRB") coal and capture a portion of the rich "dark-spread" pricing differential
between natural gas and coal commodities at the time. Moreover, DM&E's 70% OR at the
time of acquisition was supposed to be accretive to CP's operating statistics. However, CP
paid this significant premium to become the 3  rail provider in the PRC basin, a relatively
weak strategic position in freight negotiations with potential customers. In 4q12, CP
announced it was indefinitely deferring plans to complete the expansion of its rail network
within the PRB region and was forced to take a $180mm impairment on construction and
land option expenses.

Like the CP's strategic position in the PRB for coal, CP is also competing with BNSF and
CNI for oil on rail shipments, both of whom arguably have better and faster network
connections with the Bakken field and PADD II/III refineries. With CP currently trading at
21.1x LTM EBIT, investors should consider purchasing the Company at the current market
valuation as a replay similar to the DM&E acquisition disaster.


Post-Pershing: An improvement in governance?


After all the drama involving Pershing Square's proxy rebellion, investors seem to be
blindly assuming that new slate of management and Board of Directors will result in a
dramatic increase in operational efficiency and shareholder returns. However, a closer
review of their respective biographies raises some significant governance concerns.


E. Hunter Harrison: Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer


Mr. E. Hunter Harrison is best known for his prior leadership of the Canadian National
Railway Company and Illinois Central Railroad Company, but his recent track-record is of
more concern with the $4bn bankruptcy of Dynegy Inc. and the independent finding of a
"fraudulent conveyance" of certain of the firm's key assets while he served as Chairman
and CEO. Also, it is difficult to understand how Mr. E. Hunter Harrison can serve as a
"hands-on" manager as he still resides in Wellington, Florida, approximately 5,000km from
CP's corporate headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. Also, investors should compare the fact
that Mr. E. Hunter Harrison purchased CP stock at a significantly lower VWAP relative to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 9/28


the current market price as part of the proxy battle should also be compared against his
purchase of the similar amount of Dynegy stock, which is now worth $0/share following
the firm's bankruptcy.


Moreover, after the dramatic run-up in CP's share price, it seems prudent for investors to
remember Warren Buffett's (a now proven rail-road investor and executive, in addition to
all his other accomplishments) extremely prescient quote from 1989, "When a
management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for
bad economics, it is generally the reputation of the business that remains intact."


Richard C. Kelly: Board of Directors and Chairman of the Audit Committee, Finance


Mr. Kelly was President and Chief Executive Officer of NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG"), a
former subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. from June 6, 2002 to May 14, 2003, and a director of
NRG from June 2000 to May 14, 2003. In May 2003, NRG and certain of NRG's affiliates
filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
to restructure their debt, wiping out equity holders.


The Hon. John P. Manley: Board of Directors, Audit and Finance Committee


Mr. Manley was a director of Nortel Networks Corporation and Nortel Networks Limited
(collectively, the "Nortel Companies") when the Nortel Companies applied for and were
granted creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act on January
14, 2009, wiping out equity holders. In addition, as a result of the announcement in May
2004 by Nortel Companies of the need to restate certain of their previously reported
financial results, the Ontario Securities Commission made a final order on May 31, 2004
prohibiting all trading by directors, officers and certain current and former employees
including J.P. Manley.


William A. Ackman: Board of Directors, Corporate Governance and Finance
Committee


William A. Ackman is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Pershing Square Capital
Management, L.P. Pershing Square Capital Management had an economic exposure to
more than 40% of the stock of Borders Group, Inc. ("Borders") via a combination of
common shares and cash-settled total return swaps at the time of the company's Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing on 06/16/11, which wiped out all equity holders as
the firm was liquidated. It is estimated that Pershing Square investors lost in excess of
$200mm on its investment in Borders.


Paul C. Hilal: Board of Directors, Finance and Compensation Committee

Paul C. Hilal is a Partner at Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. Pershing Square
Capital Management had an economic exposure to more than 40% of the stock of Borders
Group, Inc. ("Borders") via a combination of common shares and cash-settled total return
swaps at the time of the company's Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing on
06/16/11. It is estimated that Pershing Square investors lost in excess of $200mm on its
investment in Borders.


Rebecca MacDonald: Board of Directors, Finance and Compensation Committee


Rebecca MacDonald is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Just Energy Group Inc.,
an independent marketer of deregulated gas and electricity, and previously founded
Energy Marketing, Inc. Just Energy has hit the skids over the last year, with its shares
down 48.1% on an LTM basis and allegations of accounting fraud circling.


Pershing Square Will Become a Forced Seller


After reviewing the current market dynamic, it appears an impending Pershing Square
liquidation of CP common stock is looming. First, Pershing Square's high-profile
investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. has imploded after the last year as Bill
Ackman's hand-picked CEO, Ron Johnson, alienated the Board of Directors and failed to
halt a >30% decline in same-store sales. It is estimated that Pershing Square has lost
>$200mm on their JCP investment.


Next, on 12/19/12, Bill Ackman launched a high-profile short-sale campaign against
Herbalife Inc. After Ackman publicly admitted to shorting over 20mm HLF shares, Third
Point and Icahn Associates took an opposing long position, driving share prices higher
than the price before the Pershing Square presentation in a "mother of all short-
squeezes." As the Pershing Square limited partner begin to realize a significant portion of
their net worth is now tied to a single controversial stock, investor redemptions are posed
to skyrocket. Investor redemptions will require Pershing Square to liquidate its long
positions, such as its largest holding CP. Finally, based on the SEC FOIA response in
Appendix 1, it appears the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is now
investigating Pershing Square and William Ackman's trading regarding Herbalife. This will
also likely cause LPs to reconsider their association with Ackman and CP.


It is also important to review the differences in the background and perspective of the
notable self-made investor Carl Icahn, who grew his net worth inch by inch over decades
with investment acumen, as opposed to Bill Ackman, who primarily grew rich from
management fees on billions of others people money under management. Moreover,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 11/28


Ackman appears to have taken an inordinate sizing risk as the trading volume of CP
indicates that Pershing Square's position is way too large for a dynamic capital fund
should he face any redemptions in the future.


Precedent Transaction Multiples and Canadian Resource Protectionism Limits Take-
Over Risk


Below are ALL the significant railroad mergers in North America in the last 20 years with a
transaction value great than $1bn. Please note this is also the same comparable
transactions peer-set Evercore utilized in its fairness opinion for the BNSF acquisition by
Berkshire Hathaway.


Based on these precedent transaction multiples, it seems difficult to believe that even if
the United States and Canadian anti-trust regulators would approve further consolidation
within the industry, that a strategic acquirer could afford to pay more than 7-10x CP's LTM
EBITDA, or $47.63-$78.78/share. In addition, the Brookfield Asset Management and
Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec buyout consortium that purportedly expressed a
preliminary indication of interest in CP back in 2007 would be unable to stump up the
>$30bn premium enterprise value check and limited capacity for additional leverage,
which is more than double the enterprise value of CP back in 2007 when rumors started to
circulate within the marketplace.


Moreover, because of the recent displays of Canadian resource nationalism and
protectionism, it seems unlikely that Canadian anti-trust regulators would allow one of its
two remaining Class 1 railroads be acquired by foreign firm or merged into another
railroad. First, on 04/10/08, the Canadian Government blocked the proposed $1.3bn sale

of Canadian aerospace and information technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler &
Associates Ltd. to U.S. defense company Alliant Techsystems Inc. on national security
grounds under the Investment Canada Act, which is rather ironic considering Canada has
never been invaded! Under the Investment Canada Act, rulings are made by the industry
minister, a politician, and require only that the proposed transaction show a "net benefit" to
Canada, a largely subjective assessment. Second, on 11/02/10, Canadian Government
again utilized the Investment Canada Act to block the proposed $38.6bn purchase of
Potash Corporation, a Saskatchewan fertilizer miner and producer, by BHP Billiton, a large
Australian mining company. Most recently, on 03/20/12, Gencore International PLC was
required to make several adverse deal structure concessions, such as divesting assets
which comprise a majority of the Canadian operations segments to Agrium Inc. and
Richardson International Ltd., to ensure regulatory approval for its $6.1bn acquisition of
Viterra Inc., a global grain and logistics business that was headquartered in
Saskatchewan. In addition, Canadian protectionism concerns have been raised in the
Nexen and Progress oil/gas transactions as foreign acquirers have pursued companies
listed in Canada (never mind the fact that a majority of the respective target companies'
assets were outside Canada).


Thus, based on these recent poignant examples of Canadian resource nationalism and
protectionism being utilized to derail merger agreements with compelling industrial logic, it
seems unlikely any rational railroad peer would attempt a take-over or merger run at
Canadian Pacific in light of its extremely rich valuation metrics and the adverse
geopolitical environment.


Pair-Trade Possibility: Short CP / Long CNI


Because CP is up a shocking 51% over the last 6-months versus 11% for CNI and 67%
versus 24% for the last 12 months, respectively, a pair-trade with a short CP leg and long
CNI leg may be attractive for those with a bullish macro perspective. In addition, because
CP currently trades at a significant valuation premium to CNI, it is likely this relative
valuation dichotomy will converge over time. Moreover, CNI should benefit from a more
robust operating history and key structural advantages of 1) larger network size, 2) higher
US exposure, and 3) more efficient track operations.

5/20/2018 Canadian Pacific Railway: Off The Tracks After Ackman - Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 13/28


While a pair-trade introduces some basis and tracking risk to the investment thesis, it
seems to be an appropriate macro hedge in light of increased interest in infrastructure
investing and potential bulk commodity demand volatility.


Conclusion


Like our previous report on Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. in September 2012 when the
firm's shares were trading at a shocking $119/share, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited
(NYSE/TSX: CP) is an overvalued company with limited potential upside. Below are the
top five reasons why long investors should consider selling their position in CP or why
aggressive traders should consider entering into a short-sale position:


1. After rallying over 67% over the last twelve months and outperforming all peers,
CP shares have entered unsustainable levels based on irrational market
assumptions regarding the timing and feasibility of the Company's operational
improvement plan.


2. Potential business growth for crude oil via rail transport has been overplayed
and is detrimental to more important coal transport.


3. Sub-optimal corporate governance structure and the Board of Directors
composition raises serious concerns about prior risk tolerances, accounting
issues, and bankruptcy filings at such issuers as Dynegy, NRG, Nortel, Borders,
and Just Energy.


4. After bolloxing their JCP and HLF trades and under investigation by the SEC,
Pershing Square may be required to begin selling down a significant portion
their oversized CP position, which has been completely illiquid to date, in order
to meet investor redemptions and reduce portfolio risk exposures


5. Pair-trade with Canadian National Railway Company can be utilized to reduce
macro risk exposure.

CP is probably overvalued at this point, but it's prospects are much better than the doomsday scenario portrayed in
this article. Many feel that all the rails are overvalued now as all have had a big run up (except for CSX). The fact
remains that Hunter Harrison took CNI and transformed it in to what is perhaps the best railroad in N America, and
over the long haul I think he will do the same for CP.

zorro2828
Being a conductor that was laid off due to this new wonder management, I can tell you, CP will suffer the
same fate as CN with short term gains and then the lull and then the fall. Moral is at an all time low, unions
are fed up and productivity gains are only because they have cut way too deep in the employment pool


Shorting CP is the best policy.. it is coming down hard.. CN is not the best railroad.. and where in heavens
name would you think that? Ask the employees how Hunter did.. HE WAS AND IS BRUTAL

Being a conductor with cp rail, his management team are brutal. the moral is at all time low. The saying goes,
"the beating will continue until the moral improves"!!!! Cp rail does NOT play fair. With the Employee's or with
the UNION. Hunter Harrison only objective is to please the shareholder, but with NO diplomatic skills with with
in the company that he is controlling, As conductor on local jobs Equipment is constantly breaking down, All
Locomotive that are used in local short heavy hauls or yard service are over 40 years old. where it was at one
time ONE locomotive could do the job now requires TWO do the same job. ONE still burns the same amount
of fuel, Now you need two, and twice the amount of fuel, So where is the saving. These Engines are old and
tired, and lack of some very serious maintenance. To be come fuel efficient. There rail yard are very old and
out dated. Need very serious up dating. There is a poster on the main office that states the management is
accountable to All. There is No transparency in that claim. As Accident happen every day in My Rail Yard.
And all's management put the blame on US the employees, When the company CP Rail. Could help us in
making it a safer Rail Yard. This is just the tip of the Ice Berg. There is So many problems With this
subdivision.

Many solid arguments.  
I have just an objection about Ackman position in HLF: The stock price in this case DID NOT turn above the level of
Pershing presentation (around 46), but it is still well below around 37. 
Anyway that fact does not take away the short thesis about CP.

The author is short CP....YA THINK! 
Released a gusher of oil? Thats ONE TANK CAR that opened up. It didn't combust? Try to get crude to combust...go
ahead try it. Rather difficult and the colder it is the harder it gets. 
The author has conveniently forgotten that CP uses the easier CN grade to get over the mountains out west and CN
uses CP to go the other way on the easier downhill side. They traded that years ago. 
The downside, and the author well pointed this out, is the play of Pershing in all of this...and their 'track record' if you
will.  
Toss in EHH? He turned IC around, did great things with CN and probably will with CP. Rather the share price should
reflect on his PAST abilities is yet to be determined but that's what investing and speculating is all about. 
I'm just a railroad conductor here in Michigan and I shot a couple holes in the story...read into that what you will. I'll
leave the technical jargon and numbers to the crunchers out there.

CP does NOT use the easier CN grade for ot westbound traffic to the coast. The co production that you speak
of on;y exists between Kamloops - Vancouver. After Kamloops, Cp uses the southerly and much higher grade
Kicking Horse pass, CN uses the northerly and MUCH gentler grade Yellowhead pass. Less snow too.


When Hunter took over CN, much of the heavy lifting has already been done by the previous CEO, Paul
Tellier.


Also the vaunted operating ratio improvements. Understand this. Illinois Central always had a OR of about
50%. No grades, no adverse weather (compared to western Canada). CN's OR was higher (like 80%).
Lemme see - looks like averages just plain helped out here.


Don't get me wrong - Hunter was big part of CN's success, but he is strictly short term. He had very little to do
with CN's success of the last 4 years. There is a reason that he was not asked to be on CN's board after he
"retired". He was Ty Cobb, a great player that NOBODY could stand.

This ignores the simple fact that train derailments are more frequent than pipeline leaks, and that regardless
of the severity of these incidents, they will only motivate governments to push harder for pipelines.

Hum.. and Tellier was such a treat.. a total pain to the Company and the employees.. He and Hunter are of
the same cloth, destroy moral, cut people and let the chips fall where they may .. Both are rich people that
have no idea what it means to actually have to work for a living.. Tired of saying this, but if you want a
Company to be great, the employees have to think they are at least worthy of respect and are listened to..
These men are both dumb and deaf to staff and only listen to their own voice .. and please do not compare to
Ty Cobb.. more like Bobby Clark.. tenacious and determined with a very limited skill set but steel jawed.. I
liked Bobby, but these two are regrettable

One more thing....the crude oil play? I think that's only just begun. Record number of tank car orders are on the books
for immediate production by various builders. Greenbrier, Trinity, etc. have the production ongoing for Valero and
Phillips 66 to name just two. Toss in the ownership of UTLX by Buffet...like I said, that's only just begun. Pipelines will
take years to build..i.e. Keystone and that's not even a done deal. Probably just as easy to whip up a nuclear power
plant right now in the US. Oh yeah, toss in the pipeline break in Arkansas this weekend on top of all this??? I think
that spilled MORE then 30K gallons by the way/ Nuff said.


02 Apr 2013, 11:16 AM


daro
but capex for the railroad cars will be high and the play wont last too long until the pipelines get finished.
moving oil is a short term plus. not a long term play.


I agree that his statement that the crude might ignite was a bit farfetched. If I was writing the article i would
have stressed environmental concerns not fire concerns.


At the end of the day, the argument that the PE is too high is reasonable.


02 Apr 2013, 01:32 PM


Doug-
Very informative article. I just researched CP and I have to agree that CP is overpriced. CP has already reached my
projected target price 10 years out, which means it has little or nowhere to go but sideways or down. It would better to
sell this overpriced stock and buy CSX which is still undervalued.


As far has shining a light on Ackman history, you did an excellent job. BTW, shorting a company like HLF which is an
extremely undervalued growth stock will prove to be fatal to Ackman in the long run. JCP and Target - how many
more examples do you need to show that Ackman's manipulative tactics cover up that he really does not know what
he is doing.


You are also right that the SEC is investigating Ackman.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 18/28


Not sure I follow the Ackman arguments. Icahn is clearly in HLF as part of his grudge against Ackman - he can't
articulate a single reason to be long the stock he once recommended shorting. And isn't Ackman ahead on that one
so far? Sure he's had some losers, but he's had some big winners, so his involvement is probably not a great
predictor either way. And the SEC investigation is a red herring. Fraudulent companies (think MBIA, Allied Capital,
etc.) get the SEC to investigate vocal short sellers. Why wouldn't HLF do the same? So what? Ackman has been
investigated before, so it would be surprising to see this cause material redemptions.


The valuation arguments were much more interesting. These would be more powerful if a best case scenario for the
stock was laid out showing the current valuation would still be too high, if such is actually the case.


02 Apr 2013, 12:00 PM


Doug-
Icahn has stated clearly that he went long HLF because it is undervalued and that his objective is to make
money. Icahn has articulated many reasons he went long and you can find them in a Youtube video where he
called in after the famous online battle. I have listened to this video over and over because I want to learn
from the master.


The fact that the SEC is investigating Ackman for blatant stock market manipulation is not to be taken lightly
because he moved HLF down based on such manipulation after he took a position, not because of
fundamentals. Anyone who would try to destroy a corporation for his own profit is despicable. In the end it
won't work because he picked on the wrong company, one that is very strong fundamentally.


As far as MBIA goes, that company was leveraged over 100 to 1 so it was ripe for shorting, although it took
years to work out. If HLF took years, it would be trading over 300 a share.


02 Apr 2013, 02:20 PM


Doug-
So it all comes down to one thing a very poor management team and when the tide turns, look out below.


02 Apr 2013, 02:33 PM


jacobtr
The SEC investigation is absolutely to be taken lightly, and is more evidence that the people running HLF are
fundamentally dishonest. That you are apparently a shill for HLF does nothing to enhance your credibility.
What is despicable is what this company is doing to people who are vulnerable for various reasons. Whislte
blowing is admirable, even if for a profit. Whether or not he makes a profit ultimately I don't know, but it is
unreasonable to say that sharing one's research and conclusion publicly is manipulation.


02 Apr 2013, 03:02 PM


Doug-
HLF people are very honest in the way they conduct business. You have been brainwashed by Ackman. I am
not a shill for anybody, I just speak the truth. No one is losing with HLF and you have fallen for a myth. This
company does great things for people. Oh, yes I lost with HLF, about 10 pounds in 3 months. I am just placing

HLF does not have any product in exclusive. What you buy from them you can buy somewhere else. 
There are problems in the company as even the executives are trying to remove some dishonest distributors .

Doug-
Sorry to disappoint you but if you read my most recent threads you will find out that I bought Best Buy in
December at $12 a share and it is currectly over $21. It nabbed the second best spot in the S&P 500, only
beaten by NFLX an Icahn stock. Funny how both Icahn and I like HLF. Your hero, Ackman's JCP was the 3rd
worst performing stock in the S&P. So please. Following Ackman, you will go down with his ship.


03 Apr 2013, 05:01 PM


Zeus2012
It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. While I agree with you on HLF (and long the name), I think people
are too negative on JCP. The play on JCP is to buy the bonds as they are quite cheap. Bought some of the 4-
year maturity yielding around 11.4% about 2.5 weeks ago and they are up around 5 points. Looking to
accumulate the 2097 maturity if they trade down below 65 cents on the dollar.

Doug-
Yeah, yesterday I told you about my long in BBY - In one day it moved from $21.5 to $24.5 Is that good

You are either medicated or living on another planet. Ackman used his short thesis in HLF to cover his poor
performance to date in his fund. He knew from the beginning that the stock would tank, as it did when Einhorn
questioned them, and he could then book the gain and make his funds performance look good.


17 Jul 2013, 07:03 PM


Yteeld
Every company encounters problems sooner or later. Look at the auto manufacturers for one. As to being
exclusive, you do not have to be, the company just has to be adept at marketing and making you think it's
exclusive. Most personal care products attempt to differentiate their product through marketing, but a close
analysis will show very little difference.

Interesting points, but a couple of holes that need to be pointed out.


"These primarily Canadian-based individuals, funds and sell-side analysts are largely playing a momentum trade, not
a fundamental investment, in CP shares." --


this is wrong, the CP bulls reside in the US (look at Analyst ratings) as Canadians are well aware of the history of
under-performance out of this asset.


Secondly, Canada has been invaded before, during the War of 1812, but emerged victorious....


02 Apr 2013, 01:57 PM

It should also be pointed out that Nortel announced its intention to restate its financials in the fall of 2003. The
long series of financial mismanagement occurred before this. The 3 executives implicated, and later charged,
were fired in April 2004. John Manley was appointed to the board in late May 2004.

The Canadians just realize that this stock has run too far too fast and in the end the shorts will sink this as CAPEX is
way too high and the rail/oil combo will only last as long as the pipelines are not built.. I am a seller and have no faith

Michael Blair, Contributor
I think the accolades for Hunter Harrison are a bit overdone. He is 68 I believe, and he is human. He did a pretty good
job at CN following on the heels of already good progress by his predecessors.


However good he is, the fact remains that CP is a railroad and not a technology firm. You can run trains faster, run
longer trains, and run the organization with fewer people. You cannot dramatically alter its business. Short term
volumes from oil transport are filling a gap made by reduced coal volumes. They are not here forever, as pipelines are
being and will be built.


Full credit to CP for the improvements made and underway. But the stock is way way way ahead of the profitability of
the firm. This kind of situation generally does not have a happy ending for the bulls.


I am short CP.

So a prerequisite for a sovereign nation (in this case Canada) to be concerned about national security is that it must

CP is a beuatiful short. It's trading at an absurdly high p/s, p/e and p/b ratio compared to it's 10 year average. What's
more, it's in a capital intensive industry. Even the Morningstar Analyst who covers it - and likes it's prospects - has
pegged it a fair value of $80.00 a stub.

While your CP short thesis is quite compelling, there are several inaccuracies in this article.


1. Ackman is not underwater on his HLF position. See Seeking Alpha Market Current http://seekingalpha.co...

It would seem he is up by 250 million dollars.


2. Your comparison of Ackman and Icahn in terms of how they gained their wealth does not provide context of
Ackman's fund's returns or his management fees.


3. The SEC reply does not state in particular what the investigation is about, therefore assuming that the investigation
is entirely about Pershing is blatantly misleading. Note that an SEC inquiry into Herbalife currently exists as well.
Correct me if I am wrong, but the SEC reply does not state that Pershing is the target of an investigation, rather that
the information cannot be released due to potential interference with Law Enforcement activities. Based off the
information given, the SEC reply is not revealing of whether there is an investigation of Ackman's trading practices.
Such claims are entirely speculative in nature.


Other than these 3 points, your CP short thesis overall compelling.


03 Apr 2013, 01:50 AM


Doug-
1) Ackman is not underwater yet on his HLF but he will be. He is currently up about $140 Million. This can
change very quickly. For a break even the stock has only to rise $7 points. If Ackman wants to get out with 20
Million shares, his own purchases would cause a spike in the price. The shorts have 47% of the float.


2) Ackman has actually done very poorly for his investors. For example, this year, so far in 2013, he has a
return of only 4% when the averages - Dow and S&P are up 11% and 10%. A very poor showing. Yet Ackman
gets his very large fee. I would say he is feeding off his clients.


3) I know as a fact that Ackman is being investigated by the SEC for stock market manipulation surrounding
his massive HLF short because he than went to the media to intentionally drive down the price of HLF. When
he started his scheme, the stock was around $45 a share and he drove it down to $26 within days. His only
mistake was that he did not cover any and the stock has since rallied to $38. In about a month an event will
happen that will drive the stock over $45. I have uncovered this information from the Scuttlebutt method of
research.


Bottom line, Ackman is unethical and a bad apple. Just ask Carl who had the unfortunate experience of
dealing with him.


03 Apr 2013, 07:31 AM


Doug-
I was correct that the price of HLF would go over $45 in about a month. Well, it is about a month later, the
good news I was planning did come true, mainly spectacular earnings and the stock did go over $45 a share
a couple of days ago.


11 May 2013, 09:23 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
The shorts have not 40% of the float, they have just 27%, and Ackman is only part of it, around 64%.

I gave a clue about what the upside surprise on HLF will be by saying it was a month away.

I see they have a floating of just 75.910.  
Somewhere else I saw an higher floating number.

Could they have removed Icahn's shares from the float?

PSalerno, Contributor
I don't know. Anyway I think Icahn is just trying to make some buck. Using a lot of money he can control the
price a little bit, but in the end not by much. He could sell the shares soon.

One of the issues of this excellently written article is that if stocks go against Ackman, investors who ask for
redemptions will force Ackman to sell his CP. Well in the last 2 days JCP has been down significantly, HLF
has been up significantly and CP has been down significantly so all 3 major positions of Ackman are going
against him. I already know that Ackman is an imposter. Soon the rest of the world will know. No one talks
much about what parted Loeb and Ackman, but it had to do with Ackman's fund that he started that only
invested in one stock and that stock was Target and that fund went bust costing all the investors in that fund
huge loses. When will people learn.

Will you ever learn not to speak so soon. He is holding steady with his shares.

Interesting this Loeb/Ackman story. Yes, JCP is the main problem than could force Ackman to take some profit from
HLF and CP.

There will be many more as this company has constantly refused to look at the safety issues with the
reductions it has made in both senior staff and the number of staff.. Glad no one was hurt

How timely. Just reading breaking news that George Soros wants to redeem several hundred million from Pershing
Square Fund .(Maybe he read your article. ) A good read by the way and a bold call. Thank you.

Well I thorough enjoyed reading this article Infintialis. Well done.


Morever, I agree with your assertion that shares of CP rail are way over valued.


In this comment I'm not going to get into picking apart things I liked in your report and highlighting things I don't.
Instead, I want to take you guys back to last year when Fred Green and John Cleghorn [Former CP Rail CEO and
Chairman repectively] came to our shop to sell us on the virtues of their grand plan for the business [translation: save
their skins]. Why I want to share this is interesting because on the one hand our shop ultimately voted AGAINST
Green and Cleggy and in favour of Hunter and Ackman and at the time we were a BIG CP Shareholder. We did so
knowing that the shake up in the C-Suite would add a good chunk to CPs market cap [this is market cap it might have
captured anyways with the run up of industrials but perhaps not to the same extent]. In any event, we exited CP
[entirely] shortly after Green and Cleggy got their walking papers. For us it was a nice profit and we took our $$$ and
plunked it into CN. Now the issue here was that this was a TRADE to us and the whole thing with Hunter Harrison is
that he's probably never going to get the Operating Ratio down to 65%. Green and Cleggy showed us their own plans
for the business and - frankly - they were probably right net net. Hunter's whole thing is basically this: fire LOTs of non
"yes" people, run trains with more cars, wear out those trains more quickly and replace them with better technology
and essentially take more chances. This spill in Northern Ontario the other day - I can only venture to guess - will
basically find its way back to the desk of Hunter Harrison...and there will be more.


Think of it this way...that guy has nothing to lose: he's in his late 60s. Has more money than God. Stands to make a
killing if he actually does turn CP around. Why not go for broke and hack and slash until we get train derailments all
across Canada?


Green and Cleggy were for sure "cruisers" and the whole culture of CP probably was. But after thinking about this for
a long while you have to take a look at what they were up against. Don't you think someone else at CP would have

looked at how to make the ocmpany more profitable? Bottom line is profits do not equal safety.

I re-read the article and comments and decided to add to my short. Fred Green deserved better. CP had a very good
board and solid if unexciting management that considered not only the quarterly results but also the long term security
of the funds entrusted to them and the safety of their employees and the people who live in the communities they
serve. Two derailments in a short period is not likely happenstance and is more likely the result of running trains too
quickly for the sake of a lower operating ratio. It is easy to sack a lot of people and take risks with their lives and
livelihood in the name of short term gains. It runs against the grain of good management practice.


For Ackman, it may work out but he will exit when he can and leave behind a weaker company. Harrison will take his
place in history, not as the saviour of CP but more as a once effective and admired CEO who sold out to an activist
interested in a quick buck, cashed up and cashed out, and wants to be held in high regard for doing so. I think he
should have retired gracefully on the already solid financial footing he enjoyed and not take chances with other
people's careers, finances and safety. No disrespect intended.

You make some good arguments but do not help your case with the initial list showing your track record. "Subsequent
low" is not an especially meaningful measure of performance since, as you well know, stock prices are volatile, and
since few people are fortunate enough to know when a stock has reached its low price (I could just easily note that
after its penny low CHMR "spiked" to 5 cents, thereby arguing that it was a fantastic investment because its price
increased fivefold). And it takes only minimal due diligence--which, to be sure, too many "investors" are incapable of--
to show that the OTC stocks you skewered are unworthy investments. MLNX--which I think you recognize--is really
the only worthwhile comparison here (a large, well-capitalized company trading on a legitimate exchange), and as
such provides heftier support for your future insights.

Author’s reply »  A foolish argument indeed, laid out so illogically it begs a response. Our readers know the
collective rarely responds - but we have heard this argument before and thought it warrants a response to
those who still maintain a troglodytic framework.


When we publish a report the price of a security at the moment of release is used as the official price in the
track record. That price represents a line in the sand. We are "on the hook" for any subsequent price
performance following the consumption by market participants of the information we have published.


Infitialis makes fraud or folly calls. Fraud calls are straightforward and essentially mean we believe the
company is intrinsically worthless due to malfeasance. When we make a folly call such as CP or MLNX we
are making calls where we feel very comfortable that a severe misalignment between price and intrinsic value
has occurred - in a manner that is highly asymmetric. For this reason making a cover call would be an

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 27/28


exercise of futility as we have made an obvious proclamation to the street that there will be a significant
reversal in the value of the security over time - and from our specific publication date. With that said, short
cover calls have been made on our twitter accounts on $MLNX.


Ultimately the only thing that matters is whether the price of the security declines following our publication
date at a sufficient percentage rate to allow our wide audience to profit. In the case of our track record it is not
the subsequent low that matters, but rather the percentage decline between the publication date and the
subsequent low (something you and others have apparently missed). In our case that average percentage
decline is in excess of 50%. Put differently, out of 13 highly targeted reports any investor following our advice
would have generated a return of between 0-50% on AVERAGE with each respective investor deciding what
level to crystallize their profit.


We take our track record very seriously as weeks/months of research are completed on our targets as well as
significant cash expenditures for private investigations prior to an idea making it to publication. And there are
elements of our track record where we use lower publication prices in order to be truly transparent and
intellectually honest with our audience (CYBX for example where we used 47 vs 53 as the initial price even
though the idea was clearly front-loaded by a former distribution partner and was on scribd @ 53).


Finally, it should be clear to any of our readers that Tweets are not included in the track record for obvious
reasons. When we are in possession of information we feel is pertinent to the market place we will make a
tweet/short call however such call does not carry the same conviction as a bona-fide report. With that said,
with the exception of GMCR each tweet has been a winner (when measured by subsequent decline) and we
remain convicted on GMCR as an ultimate folly valuation worth teens.


The most ridiculous assertion you have made in your comment relates to CHMR. A company where Infitialis
alerted the public @ $1.83 and for which the company was subsequently suspended and investigated by the
SEC. Shares which declined from $1.83 to $.01 representing a potential gain of 99.9% or a potential savings
to retail investors of that much. Yet you focus on some stupid move from .01 to .05 as representing a
"fantastic investment". You have shown not only your lack of understanding of markets - but a severe
deficiency in logic.

I believe you are willfully misreading my point, which was not that CHMR is a fantastic investment, merely that
the cherry-picking of prices is a questionable tactic when calculating returns (you did read my comment well
enough to address this, and I thank you). If you are going to offer a realistic assessment of your track record,
you also need to provide proper points of comparison--not a well-capitalized, large operation vs. an OTC
scam. (The cost and availability of borrow may be relevant too, but that's getting a bit far afield).


The track record chart above shows a ~66% average decline. Is this the appropriate return yardstick? Or is
the yardstick the somewhat more amorphous "in excess of 50%" in your response (yes, I know 66% is in
excess of 50%) or the seemingly contradictory "0-50%" (which is to say, less than 50) also offered in your
response? This was the thrust of my main point: choosing the stock's low price as a return endpoint

somewhat weakens your argument, because it offers an unrealistically high return. I don't think we disagree
on this.


With that in mind, it's somewhat baffling to me that you would engage in what comes perilously close to an ad
hominem attack and use language like "some stupid move." If you're trying to appear professional, this does
you no favors. Again, I was not arguing with your theses--as I noted in my original comment, you make some
good arguments, and you make some good arguments in your response as well--but rather with some
aspects of your presentation.

CP Rail Reports Best Q1 in history!


From Progressive Rail News:

Looks to me like EHH is making progress. I think most of the nay-sayers on this message board sound like union
supporters complaining about change just as they always do. CP is still richly valued, but the future is bright. I've
made a ton of money with it, and am in for the long haul.
