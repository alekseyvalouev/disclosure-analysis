Pay Per Click Ads Help This Houston Promoter Run 2 Simultaneous
Scams - Part 1: CHMR

Note: The accuracy of this article has been disputed.


After learning about the world of OTCBB scams and issuing our first piece of research on
Quest Water Global (OTCPK:QWTR) we thought we had experienced one of the nastiest
manifestations of micro-cap fraud. Here we had a company that was clearly setup to sell
shares to US investors at inflated prices by undisclosed persons residing offshore. Worst,
the story being sold to naïve investors was one of a humanitarian mission that would help
produce water from air to the impoverished in Angola.


Then we encountered Chimera Energy Corp. (OTC:CHMR) and Nova Mining Corp.
(NVMN.OB) two interrelated scams that combined have less than $130,000 in cash, no
physical office space, and negative shareholder equity that have been manipulated to a
combined market valuation nearing $200,000,000 by an unnamed Houston based stock
promoter.


Unfortunately the facilitator of these stock scams and many others like it is one of our
country's most innovative and respected companies: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) - through
their online advertising system AdWords. Without Google, scams like CHMR and NVMN
would never find their way to the portfolios of naive investors. Google is the trusted bridge
investors cross when searching for keywords that are relevant to their investment goals.
Keywords such as: "Safe investments", "Online Trading", and "Fixed Investments". Only
on the other side of this bridge are stock promoters who pay more than TD Ameritrade or
E*TRADE for the right to place their ads on top of Google's search results. Inexperienced
investors click these ads and eventually a few take the bait purchasing shares directly
from promoters for $1, $2, and even $3 a share having no idea that the shares being sold
to them were purchased for less than half a penny and that the company underlying these
shares has no inherent value.


We sincerely believe that Google executives are completely in the dark and don't fully
comprehend the destruction in wealth being facilitated by these ads. We remind Google to
refer to its Prospectus from 2004 where it stated "DON'T BE EVIL"

In our view Google should not allow non-registered firms to advertise any securities
period. Just as Google does not allow offshore gambling sites from advertising to U.S.
persons it should regulate the entities bidding on financial related keywords. A copy of this
report was forwarded to Google's Chief of Compliance. We recommend that readers who
share this view do the same.


In Part 1 of this report we will cover CHMR - a Company with one employee and tangible
equity of just $4,549 (not even enough to buy a 2003 Ford Focus) that is valued at
$120,000,000 with nearly $40,000,000 in free trading float shares being liquidated into
unsophisticated retail investors. Part 2 will cover NVMN and more details on the identity of
the man from Houston orchestrating these frauds through offshore companies in the
Marshall Islands.

Full Time Employees 1 - Charles Earl Grob, Jr. AKA Chuck Grob,


Age: 31


Corporate Offices


Chimera Energy doesn't have a physical corporate office. Instead they lease a virtual
office from ServCorp for $200 a month electing to use their address forwarding and virtual
phone number plan. We are puzzled as to why the perpetrators of this scam didn't elect to
choose the $305 a month plan which included access to a conference room. Surely even
promoters could make use of a physical conference room.


The Business


The most effective exercise in demonstrating to readers that CHMR is a scam is to review
its chronology from inception to now through the perspective of Charles E. Grob Jr. the 31
year old who is the only named employee in the company, as well as through the role of
the unnamed Houston promoter that owns the 20,000,000 free trading shares purchased
for $.0038.


Charles Earl Grob Jr.

December


21, 2011


Receives approval for his S1 from the SEC


January 6,


2012


Sells 5,000,000 free trading shares relying on the S-1 filed with the SEC to "third


parties" @ $.015 per share.


Here the roles split…


Charles Earl Grob Jr. Unnamed Houston Promoter


March 1, 2012 - As the sole CEO/COO/CFO and


Director, awards himself a salary of $2,500 a month.


April 2012 - Sets up a cloud server hosting


account with Rackspace in San Antonio


Texas. This account will be used to host


the websites and promotional referral sites


used in the scams CHMR and NVMN.


June 26, 2012 - Effectuates a 4:1 Forward Split


lowering his average cost to $.00025 and that of the


20,000,000 free trading float shares owned by the


unnamed Houston promoter to $.0038.


May 2012 - Hires an Indian web design


company to build the websites:


chimeraenergyusa.com, nova-mining.com,


zerowaterfracking.com,


foxmarketreport.com,


July 26, 2012 - Licenses a technology from a Chinese


company nobody has ever heard of for $5,000 a


month in a 4 page contract with no mention of any


patent numbers or description of the technology.


June 2012 - Produces a 2:29 minute long


promotional video full of sound bites and


generalities relating hydraulic fracturing.


Aside from conjecture relating to the


conceptualization of the licensed


technology no tangible evidence is


provided to as to the history, effectiveness


or existence of this potentially world-


changing service.

July 30, 2012 - Puts out a sensational press release


touting a technology licensed less than 90 hours


prior as a "breakthrough" that will replace an industry


standard drilling technique employed by multi-billion


dollar energy companies for nearly a decade.


July 2012 - Sets up and funds a Google


AdWords account as well as accounts with


other online PPC (pay per click)


companies. Sets up and funds an account


with the Wall Street Journal online network


for display ads that will run on: WSJ.com,


Barrons.com, and MarketWatch.com.


Initiates the distribution of the ads


coinciding with the first press release


issued by Charles Earl Gorb Jr. on July 30,


2012.


From August 1, 2012 - August 10, 2012 puts out 6


press releases in 8 trading days discussing everything


from how the recent drought makes his technology


even more attractive to how he plans on attending a


conference anybody with $475 can attend while


making sure to cram as many multi-national stock


symbols into the press releases like (NYSE:HAL)


(NYSE:SLB) (NYSE:ECA) and (NYSE:CLR) so that


naïve investors browsing those company's


financial news feeds might accidentally see these


releases and be duped into investing their hard-


earned savings.


July 30-Present - A blitzkrieg of display


and text ads is ultimately successful in


duping retail investors into purchasing


CHMR shares directly from the promoter.


During this period the promoter liquidates


some of the 20,000,000 shares that were


purchased for $.0038 at a minimum price


of $1.00 and as high as $2.00. From July


30th until August 10th over 5,288,000


shares of CHMR trade hands at an


average price of $1.55 for $8,218,000


worth of dollar volume.


Unfortunately the perpetrators of this scam have thus far rung the register to the tune of
over $8,000,000. That money has come from the brokerage accounts of hard-working
U.S. investors that were most probably new to the world of investing or were gullible
enough to believe that CHMR was a legitimate enterprise. As we explained in the opening
section of the report it is not entirely their fault as the path which led them to CHMR was
one they instinctively trust.

Even the most astute investors could fall for such an ad believing that the Wall Street Journal with its


impeccable reputation would at minimum scrub their advertising clients before allowing an ad on


their website. There is no doubt in our minds that Rupert Murdoch would have put an end to this


immediately had he known his most prized possession is being used as a tool to dupe investors.


Investors that are outraged should email their complaints to: wsj.ltrs@wsj.com


The Google Adwords Promotion


The WSJ network display ads were only a small component of the CHMR promotion. The
real heavy lifting was done through the Google Adwords platform. Here the unnamed
Houston promoter was able to leverage Google's search engine to target keywords that
would deliver the most relevant investors to his doorstep. Using SEO profiler we were able
to identify 7 different text ads used by the promoter:


These ads were displayed whenever a variety of keywords were typed by unsuspecting
googlers. While it is nearly impossible to know exactly what keywords were used with
SEO profiler we found at least 7:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/808601-pay-per-click-ads-help-this-houston-promoter-run-2-simultaneous-scams-part-1-chmr 7/18


The keyword selection should make any reader feel sick to their stomach. Picture a retiree
searching for "fixed interest savings" in this low yield environment only to be matched with
an advertisement for Chimera Energy. The retiree then proceeds to invest his/her savings
by purchasing shares of CHMR at $1.55 only to find the shares worthless several months
later. As we mentioned in the opener this is simply wrong and Google has to put an
end to it. They can no longer sit by while investors are being delivered to promoters like
sheep's to the slaughterhouse. Quality control must be employed before allowing anyone
to target investment related traffic. We recommend a simple rule requiring a firm to be
registered with the SEC as an investment advisory in order to recommend a security for
purchase.


While the majority of the PPC campaign was carried out via Google Adwords other websites like


Yahoo (YHOO) and Ask.com were also used by the promoters. These companies need to beef up


their quality control as well and refuse this type of business. In this screenshot we see text ads that


were displayed on other leading websites. These ads are still being displayed as of 8/13/2012.


The Smoking Gun


The smoking gun was discovered when we traced the IP Address of the server used to
host the website for Chimera Energy. Basically all web servers (which are nothing but
computers running software to serve web pages) are assigned unique IP addresses on
the Internet. If a web server is hosting a website, the IP address of that site will be the
same as that of the server. And if multiple domains are hosted on that web server they will
all have the same IP address which will again be the same as that of the web server.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/808601-pay-per-click-ads-help-this-houston-promoter-run-2-simultaneous-scams-part-1-chmr 8/18


Using CMD, we pinged the chimeraenergyusa.com website and found that the IP Address of the


web server was: 184.106.176.97


Next we used Bing to do an IP Search. The results are the websites being hosted on the
same web server as the IP address being entered:


A Coincidence? We think not. There are only 5 websites being hosted on this web server which


indicate that it's an exclusive server as opposed to a shared server with many independent sites. But


this one server hosts the sites of two publicly traded OTCBB companies: NVMN and CHMR, which


are both run out of virtual offices in Texas, started trading at or around the same time, and have had


the same type of display and keyword ads being plastered all over the internet.


As far as we are concerned the nail in the coffin in terms of connecting the promoters to
the companies is the fact that foxmarketreport.com and zerowaterfracking.com are both
hosted on the same servers as nova-mining.com and chimeraenergyusa.com. Fox Market
Report is a fake investment report website meant to appear as though it's related to the
Fox News Network. ZeroWaterFracking is a site used to refer investors to Chimera
Energy's main site. These sites act as conduits and refer even more traffic to each
respective company leading to more conversions (investors being duped into buying
shares). The promoters use these sites to monopolize the available space on the Google
Adwords system as one site can only take one spot. Two sites bidding the highest price
will take the top two spots. Two simultaneous scams with two referral sites will take up 4
spots meaning that every conversion results in a sale of worthless shares at artificial
prices.

Comments (37)


We urge investors to stay away from both CHMR and NVMN as they both have no
tangible value and are simply publicly traded tools being employed by unscrupulous
promoters to sell shares to the unsuspecting investor. In the first part of this report we
covered CHMR. In part 2 we will cover NVMN as well as unveil more data relating to the
man behind these two scams. In full disclosure we are short shares of CHMR and NVMN
but stress that the amount of shares is insignificant as a percentage of our assets. We
write these exhaustive reports in an effort to educate investors and prevent them from
falling into these traps. With this report we also hope to see policy changes implemented
at Google, News Corp, Yahoo, and AOL, companies we greatly admire that simply do not
understand the extent they are being used as pawns in these schemes.


"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while
they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one. - Charles Mackay, 1841"


Disclosure: We are short shares of CHMR and NVMN

I am glad you put this out today. I believe I saw this symbol on the CNBC website and also on yahoo finance. I was
researching CHMR to see what it was about and if it would be a good investment. I am thankful I did not loose my
money and feel sorry for the ones who already have. I feel our government has allowed this to go on knowing that
people who cannot really afford to loose their money are the one's who are getting hurt by scams like this. We are
loosing investors to legitimate companies by letting them get taken by the deceitful people All while our government
seems to do nothing to stop them. Goes to show if you invest in a company do your due diligence before turning loose
your hard earned money.

Tom Tuo, Contributor
Chimera is clearly a fraud. You are doing the world a service by posting this well researched article. You are right,
Google needs to take responsibility and do some basic vetting here. Legitimate companies don't promote themselves
in this fashion, it shouldn't be hard for this to raise red flags at Google.

Although I had suspicions about NVMN I foolishly purchased 5000 shares at $3.25. I hope the parties responsible for
these scams get to sample prison food.

I read the Yahoo article, then called the company..."Mr. Grob stepped out for a while."


Now, will the SEC take this person to court? Will our money be refunded, as this is out-and-out fraud?


The SEC ought to hammer this into Grob's head and pocketbook!

I have a question for the contributor of this article. You say you are currently short shares of these two stocks. When
you make a killing on your short in the coming weeks (and you will), aren't you profiting from the "bilking" of the
investors you say you are trying to protect?


Just asking.

Bald Won,


I will be honest to say that as a shorter of many of this stocks, there are a tiny amount of shares to be borrowed... I
mean tiny. So per person you may be able to short several thousand shares. I think this person whoever it is, is doing
this more to protect others because 1000 to 3000 shares is not alone worth it to take all this time and do this type of
research. This research must take hours upon hours! Another point to be made, is that the borrows on these stocks
have certain restriction on days as well so its not like shorting a company such as GOOGLE where you can hold it for
more than a week easily... This person deserves to make the money that he will most likely make because just in

these comments we witnessed at least 4 people who were thinking about buying and then after seeing this article
changed their mind. That saved their hard earned money from being lost. Last point, all of these pumps and dumps
go to 0 its just a matter of time. So putting this article simply helps both protect the retail investor and gives a chance
for the SEC to see the truth about the scams! People are always knocking down shorts and it is really ashame
because there are two sides to the market and without shorting we would not have knowledge about scams. Take
David Einhorn he always gets bad press for the shorting but yet the people that listen end up saving their money.
Anyways, Bald Won I think you get my point and sorry for being so passionate :) but to the author... I appreciate what
you are doing and I hope you continue doing your great DD!

I bought nearly 20,000 shares of Nova Mining due to the fraudulent postings about the Lithium market. Bought
between $1.20 and $1.70 and closed out at between .77 and .84 today. Lesson learned

Great investigative work. Thank yo for warning investors about this fraudulent "investment". 
I admire your thorough research. Just crossing my fingers that more people read this before they buy any CHMR or
NVMN. 
Thank you!!

Great service to your readers. Hope this can get distributed far and wide. I was watching NOVA and the press
releases looked too good to be true - My thoughts-- "pump and dump". I have been had by these in my earlier trading
days and this could save many from learning the hard way. . . thanks much.

Anyone who looked into Chimera for 20 minutes and could not see plenty of red flags should not be playing with real
money. Your radar is broken. 
The SEC is a disgrace. How could they allow them to go public in the first place? Case in point: the bar for a
successful S1 filing approval is very low.


16 Aug 2012, 01:39 PM


Mysur
If you look at the volume of transactions on Aug 15th the day the article was posted its approximately 1.1M which is
approximately 10 times the normal amount. This implies that converse to what one of the previous readers has
assumed the short sale is not in a few thousands but many times over.


Its common knowledge that Lithium is in short supply, demand is high and prices are raising. The article ignores the
contracts that Nova has signed for supply and mining of Lithium. Its true that their cash on hand is approximately only
$26000, but the lithium deposits have been evaluated to be woth about 1.3 billion at today's Lithium price. This may
be something to consider before dumping the stock.

In response to your terrible insertion, I find it interesting you and bald won have both a history of one
comment which happens to be on the ONLY article exposing the truth behind CHMR and NVMN.


In regards to the activity you should go to this page http://bit.ly/PtCJzM and learn that when the promoters
and insiders who hyped the stock dump their shares the stock crashes. In this scenario the article allowed
people who saw it to get out of the shares they had, protect the money they would of lost (60% more) had
they still kept their shares, keep other investors from buying it, and minimize the profit which the people
behind the scheme will make.


Lastly, before pumping the stock you should consider that anybody can evaluate something for money. But as
of date, I have never seen a good company as your portraying NVMN to be have a 1.3B deposit and yet
happen to have the same ip address of 3 other sites, two of which are promoting the stock, the other for
another company which HAPPENED to have the same activity as NVMN around the same time.

You gotta be kidding. Or long the stock and hope to hype it for a few more pennies before you agonizingly get
out. Don't wait-- get out now if you are long.

WHERE IS PART TWO? WHO IS NOT DOING THE JOB OF OVERSEEING AND GIVING THE POWER TO PUT TO
PRINT ON THE INTERNET, MAGAZINES,NEWS, AND ANY OTHER WAY OF ADVERTIZING TO DECEIVE THE
INVESTOR. AND I WONDER WHY PEOPLE DON'T INVEST !! IT IS LIKE GIVING MONEY TO THE DEVIL.

activestocktrader10,


I'm hurt. I never really thought of myself as a "one-hit wonder". All that aside... everybody should now realize trading
in these two stocks is an exercise in "bigger fool". If you are short, stay short (and congratulations). If you are long,
RUN for the exits. There is no future here and do not wait for someone else to perform the due diligence. As a wise
songwriter once pined.... "Nothing from nothing leaves nothing". Good luck, all.

Well. I bought CHMR based on the fracing advantage at $1.25 and now it is at $.50. Speculations are what they
are...speculations. What a fool am I!

If a company, especially a BB company doesn't provide verification to their claims, then you must ignore
them. They should know there is greater skepticism toward small companies, so they should work to
overcome this. The onus is on THEM to convince investors by validating their claims. If they don't, run.

Thanks for your research. You deserve whatever you get from going short. If this type of research is your specialty I
hope you will look for other frauds and let us know.

While completely sleazy, I admire the elegance of the scam - and think anyone so blatantly stupid to invest in these
obvious scams deserves to lose their money.

Appreciate this article! Maybe NVMN is renting the conference room. . . I found them while rounding up lithium stocks
and "bought" (in a practice account with imaginary money, thank heaven) 400 shares, only to watch them coast into

Lost on CHMR too. I bought at 1.87, and fortunately put in a stop loss at 1.72. I began to have suspicions when I put
the stop limit in. I called PEMEX investor relations in Mexico City on 08/17/12. They were not aware of Chimera
Energy Corp or the new non Hydrolic technology. I was told by IR they would look into it, and get back to me. If this is
a scam, there should be some serious prison time for those involved.


18 Aug 2012, 03:26 PM


farwest
There is ZERO chance of prison time. And perhaps in 5 years, the SEC will win judgement against these
guys - by which time the cash will have vanished. These guys are serial scammers. This is a dime a dozen
scam - and they prey on the ever-present nitwits who never seem to be in short supply.

Big time scam....and his Dr. Romero is a total fabrication...google him he only exists in Mr. Grobbs made up press
release. I checked the Commission of Hydrocarbons of Mexico, and Dr. Nestor Martinez Romero is not mentioned or
listed on the board of commissioners.

Microcap Millionaires, Contributor
the truth is that the SEC would have 99% less of these types of scams to crack down on if GOOGLE would use some
discretion as to who they let run PPC ads (adwords)....


Google sees that these sites are only asking for an email address and are not trying to "sell" anything on the landing
page...so they see that as a good "user experience"...so they let these promoters run ads and happily collect the $5 or
so per click (omg!) thinking that they are offering searchers a good offer....


yet the irony is that they are an ESSENTIAL element for these shady promoters' schemes!! Wake up Google!!

I just today sold 50 shares of NVMN for a $50 loss. What happens to perpetrators of such scams.? No jail time and
repayment for this selling fraud? It is a criminal act isn't it?. There is no tree high enough for their hanging.
Punishment by jail time is in order. I bought the stock because I believed it existed. Why are people still buying it when
it clearly does not exist?. Wakee wakee people.

Five senior officials of Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) has been kidnapped by organized crime, four of 'Integral Active

height of the rancheria Corregidora, third section, known as the "Y" Greek, was intercepted by some individuals, those
who fell from his unit kidnapped and taken away to an unknown destination.


Later, the kidnappers contacted the family to whom they demand the amount of 10 million dollars for his release.


Dr. Nestor Martinez Romero, from March 31, 2009 held the position of Manager of Integral Asset sub Muspac
Southern Region, replacing Mr. Filiberto Anaya Lopez, who was appointed Administrator of Integral Active Tertiary
Gulf Oil, belonging Northern Region to the sub.

Two other comprehensive asset Muspac officials were deprived of their liberty by members of organized crime, who

On April 14, a group of armed men kidnapped the accountant and the managing director of the petrochemical
complex 'The Brown', being abandoned Ferris Fabian. Hours later sent one message to the family of Marco Antonio

Huimango of this county.

May we have " Part Two " of the original article, focusing now on 
NVMN ?


Of course we should have the initial investigatory material, but 
additionally, having lost a bit (while gaining with LIT), I would  
also be interested in hearing the subsequent story:-


What accounts for the stuttering nature of the drop in price 
after your expose - simply the incompleteness of detail in 
Part One and slow permeation of the message ? 
Why the rise of price again through August 24? Is there 
a sensible reason for it ( faster rise than LIT ! ), or simply 
the action of a new flock of gullible sheep, or truly a  
further conceptual nugget to be gleaned from the 
ingenious fiasco that this "CEO" set up ?


THANKS FOR YOUR DILIGENCE !

Hey everyone I uploaded a video on YouTube about this scam http://bit.ly/PI4neP. Watch that and also this video
which I linked on my video that shows CHMR having no contract with PEMEX http://bit.ly/ReHGv8.

Here's a shocker: as part of Seeking Alpha came (I thought) Daily Trade Alert. So I just opened the latter and there is
the video promoting CHMR--the whole slick scam is presented. And I see why some ( many?) could get sucked in. 
What does this say about Daily Trade Alert? (See the ad as part of "upgrades/downgrades").
