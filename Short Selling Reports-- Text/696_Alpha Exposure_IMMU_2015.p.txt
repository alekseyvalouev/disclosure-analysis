Immunomedics - The Trail Of Tears (For Shareholders That Is)

Summary


IMMU's orphan designation for veltuzumab is meaningless.


IMMU has failed to approve any drug since 1982.


Our price target on IMMU is $0.71 per share.


On Tuesday, August 4, 2015 Immunomedics press released that their antibody
veltuzumab had been awarded orphan drug designation for the treatment of immune
thrombocytopenia purpura or ITP (here). This was a rather surprising announcement since
Immunomedics does not even feature veltuzumab in the pipeline graphic on its web page.


This is a screen shot of Immunomedics web page taken on August 4, 2015.


As you can see, veltuzumab is not featured. In fact, the first studies of veltuzumab in ITP
were started over 8 years ago, as can be seen on its ClinicalTrials.gov page here! Some
further digging reveals that Immunomedics had previously licensed veltuzumab to

Nycomed on July 14, 2008 (here). Roughly five years later on October 3, 2013, Nycomed
returned the drug to Immunomedics (here). Despite the fact that the agreement was
terminated on October 3, 2013, Immunomedics waited a full 6 days until October 9 before
press releasing this news (see Note 10: License and Collaboration Agreements here).
Immunomedics pursued arbitration claims against Nycomed but no damages were
awarded (see Note 10: License and Collaboration Agreements here). Veltuzumab
completed its Phase 2 and Immumomedics has yet to articulate a development plan.


The timing of the orphan drug press release by Immunomedics is also highly suspicious. It
turns out that Immunomedics was awarded orphan designation on July 28, 2015 - the very
same day that UCB, Immumomedics' partner for epratuzumab, announced that both
phase 3 EMBODY trials of Immunomedics' epratuzumab in lupus failed to meet their
primary endpoint (here). See the screen shot of FDAs web page below.


Immunomedics, for its part, waited until after the market closed on the 28th and slipped
out an 8-K in which the confirmed that the studies failed (here). Naturally, husband and
wife team David Goldenberg and Cynthia Sullivan sold plenty of Immunomedics stock in
advance of the EMBODY trial failures (here). One has to ask who decided an event that
ostensibly sent the company's hopes up in flames only warranted an 8-K but orphan drug
designation of an antibody that has been sitting around at Immunomedics for years
justifies the release of a pre-market opening PR? Not only that, it justified waiting a week
before releasing that PR? I don't think one has to be a genius to figure out what happened
here.


Immunomedics history of failure would best be called the "trail of tears" if that name wasn't
already taken. Since its founding by the current CEO in 1982, Immunomedics has
delivered precisely zero approved drugs. That is 33 years of abject failure under the same
founding CEO.

It is unclear why anyone would believe that "this time it's different" for Immunomedics and
their pipeline. It hasn't been different for the first 33 years. Anyone hanging their hopes on
Immunomedics' next drug being a gem is likely to be disappointed. We are short shares of
Immunomedics with a price target of $0.71 versus the last closing price of $1.85, which is
60% gain from current levels. We derive the price target as follows:


Cash and marketable securities: 106 million


Convertible debt -96 million


Pipeline value 50 million. We believe the pipeline has limited value since it's very early
stage products and given IMMU's abysmal track record of development success.


Total value 66 million


Shares outstanding: 93 million


Value per share $0.71


Disclosure: I am/we are short IMMU.
