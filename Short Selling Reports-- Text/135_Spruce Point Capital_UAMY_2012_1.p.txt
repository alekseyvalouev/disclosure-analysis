UAMY is Being Promoted as a Play on a Scarce Commodity 


 A little over a year ago, UAMY was an obscure $0.50 cent stock on the bulletin board 


until a promotional campaign began touting them as an incredible play on antimony 


 Antimony prices have already adjusted higher from 2008 -2011 in the post-crash 


commodity cycle. Prices have since stagnated, and continue to soften; there are 


plenty of global exploration projects underway to increase supply 


 There are limited organic demand drivers to push prices higher, as global 


consumption of this commodity is tied to GDP growth, with no known new 


application drivers to spur added demand.  Multiple substitutes of this commodity 


also exist, which will also suppress further price increases  


UAMY’s Financials Are Suspect: They Have Never Made a Profit 


 UAMY is primarily a processor of the commodity, and just earns a spread. Higher 


antimony prices have never provided earnings leverage to the company; UAMY has 


never made more than a penny per share in the last decade  


 UAMY discloses two material weaknesses affecting their disclosure controls and 


financial reporting, both of which have not been remedied as of June 30, 2012 


Numerous Holes and Risks in the Mexico Growth Story 


 UAMY’s growth case is to expand into antimony mining, but has no SEC compliant 


proven/probable reserves, and previously wrote off the mining operation at $0 a 


few years back. Since 2006, the company has only invested $5.5m in Mexican capex 


 The company’s filings contain numerous lapses in risk disclosures around their 


growth operations, which leave the door open for many lawsuits   


Weak Capital Structure with Significant Dilutive Instruments 


 Numerous convertible preferred and warrant securities in the capital structure to 


dilute existing shareholders. UAMY is not shy about diluting, and quickly raised $2.8 


million in June 2012 at a 28% discount to the closing price 


 UAMY has a weak shareholder base that includes no institutional support; the stock 


is held ~63% by a retail base led by overly promotional promises 


Share Price Appears Significantly Overvalued and Likely to Fall 


 UAMY’s stock price is overvalued by at least 500 -600%; there are numerous publicly 


traded global peers across the value chain in the industry to determine relative value  


 Global M&A transaction values also support significant over-valuation

United States Antimony (AMEX: UAMY or “the Company”) is a former penny stock on the bulletin board that is promoted as 


a must own commodity stock in short supply. In reality, demand for antimony remains constrained, and the company has 


shown no earnings leverage to rising prices. Furthermore, investors are significantly overvaluing their ability to 


produce antimony in Mexico given they have no SEC complaint proven or probable reserves. Conclusion: UAMY is worth no 


more than $0.50 cents given the speculative nature of their Mexico operations, and inability to generate profits.

Introduction 


United States Antimony Corp (Amex: UAMY) made its graduation from the bulletin board to the AMEX 


on May 21st at approximately $4.00 share, giving the company a $275 million valuation. The company 


was incorporated in Montana on January 1970 to mine and produce antimony products. In December 


1983, the company suspended antimony mining operations but continued to produce antimony 


products from domestic and foreign sources. In April 1998, the company formed United States 


Antimony SA de CV or USAMSA, to mine and smelt antimony in Mexico.  On August 19, 2005, UAMY 


formed Antimonio de Mexico, S. A. de C. V. to explore and develop antimony and silver deposits in 


Mexico, which is presently being merged into USAMSA. Today, the company’s principal business remains 


the production and sale of antimony products, along with zeolite products mined in Idaho. 


So what took UAMY multiple decades to achieve its listing status and a valuation more than a quarter 


billion dollars, as compared with it being a bulletin board stock with just a $30 million dollar valuation 


about a year ago? In our opinion, the answer is a lot of promotion aimed at retail investors, with 


attempts to draw a specious parallel between antimony and the rare earth investment story. In our 


opinion, the company’s recent AMEX listing is not a celebrated milestone of their corporate growth, but 


rather a catalyst and platform to sell their overvalued stock to new investors. Our analysis will show 


exactly what new investors are buying into – a company with material operational and financial 


weaknesses that do not justify even a fraction of the current stock price. We’ll start with a quick primer 


to demystify the antimony market, and then illustrate why we believe the odds are in favor of UAMY’s 


share price declining significantly from current levels.

The Reality of Antimony – Limited Supply but even More Limited Demand Drivers 


Antimony (Sb) is a silvery-white, shining, soft and brittle metal. It is a semiconductor and has thermal 


conductivity lower than most metals. Due to its poor mechanical properties, pure antimony is only used 


in very small quantities; larger amounts are used for alloys and in antimony compounds. Antimony’s 


abundance in the earth’s crust is 0.2 ppm, making the element about as scarce as some of the heavier 


Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and a little above silver (Ag). Scarcity and supply origins in China are about 


the only thing antimony has in common with REEs.  





Few Demand Drivers with Declining Growth 


According to the US Geological Survey (USGS) and European Commission, the largest end market for 


antimony is flame retardant products that find their way into electronics and clothes. Antimony’s 2
nd





biggest end market is in lead-acid batteries, which is a declining due to the shift to newer battery 


technologies.

Whereas REEs are necessary for many of the next generation batteries in hybrid electric vehicles, 


antimony will not play any role in this future growth. Historical demand for antimony has exhibited a 


GDP-like 2.9% CAGR from 2007-2011 in the US, and a similar long-term rate for world consumption as 


estimated by Roskill in an April 2012 report entitled “Antimony: Changes in the Pattern of Supply and 


Demand.” However, the growth rate may actually decline going forward warns the EU Commission 


report. It’s easy to understand why the EU report made this prediction given the anemic world growth 


rate and potential for displacement of lead acid batteries. Furthermore, there are few if any future 


technology applications that depend on antimony as a critical element.

World Estimated Demand








Supply Contracted in 2011, Set to Increase in the Future 


Focusing on the supply aspects of antimony, there is no question that China has historically played a 


major role.   China’s Hunan Province hosts the world’s largest known deposits and is believed to account 


for ~60% of world supply, with another 20% coming from other Chinese locations. As we’ve seen in 


many critical commodities such as rare earth and graphite, China has taken measures to more closely 


control their resources from mine to value added production, and reduce export quotas. The Chinese 


government took measures to shut down certain antimony mines and smelters in 2011 in an effort to 


control environmental issues and resolve safety problems. The tables below show the global locations of 


current antimony supplies and reserves. At the current production rate, there are safely 10 years of 


antimony reserves, and that doesn’t account for additional exploration efforts that are currently 


underway to expand supplies.

Including UAMY’s efforts to expand production in Mexico, there are numerous other companies 


advancing antimony projects around the world. It should be noted that the USGS doesn’t even recognize 


Mexico as having any reserves. Many of these projects include bringing on past producing mines. For 


example, Anchor Resources is advancing the Wild Cattle Creek project in Australia, while Adroit 


Resources is working to advance past producing mines in Italy.  The Hillgrove mine in Australia is another 


example of a formerly producing mine that could quickly come into production if the right buyer can 


finance the reported $60m purchase price that the owner Straits Resources Ltd is seeking.

Prices Have Already Adjusted Higher, Few Catalyst for Higher Prices 


The price of antimony has adjusted to reflect the actual and perceived supply shrinkage from China. Like 


many of the scarcer commodities tied to China, antimony prices peaked in 2011 at $8/lb ($17,600/mt) 


and have softened considerably since. In the absence of additional supply shrinkage, a material pick-up 


in global demand, or new uses for the material, antimony prices are likely to stay range bound for a 


while or continue to soften as market reports already indicate.

Plenty of Substitutes for Antimony Will also Suppress Demand and Higher Prices 


The USGS lists plenty of substitutes for antimony. For example, compounds of chromium, titanium, zinc, 


and zirconium substitute for antimony chemicals in paints, pigments and enamels. Combinations of 


cadmium, calcium, copper, selenium, strontium, sulfur and tin can be used as substitutes for hardening 


lead. Selected organic compounds and hydrated aluminum oxide are widely accepted substitutes for 


flame retardants. The higher price of antimony also incentivizes additional substitution effects to take 


place. For example, phosphorus can be a substitute for antimony metal when it comes to production of 


flame retardants. Phosphorus has been one of the materials subject to a WTO ruling against China when 


it comes to their current export restrictions - which according to the ruling is unfair. A recent order by 


the WTO all but assures China will remove their current export barriers for this material.
4
 Phosphorus 


will then become an even more attractive substitute to antimony metal based flame retardants. The 


result is that we will probably see many producers in the flame retardant business investing in new 


technology able to handle this material, making antimony metal less attractive.

United States Antimony – Profitless Market Position 


No company on the planet has ridden the illusion of the extraordinary profit potential of the antimony 


market than UAMY. No one can dispute that there is currently no antimony mine production in the U.S., 


and that UAMY owns the only smelter in Montana. However, given the magnitude of the company’s 


share price move and its $200 million valuation, are investors completely understanding what they are 


purchasing and appropriately valuing the company’s earnings potential?  


Limited Profitability, No Recent Cash Flow 


UAMY sells both antimony and zeolite products, with ~80% of revenues coming from antimony. While 


they are the only producer of antimony products, there are at least 10 companies in the U.S. that 


produce and sell zeolites, which are used in the animal feed, odor control, pet litter, water and waste 


purification, fungicide or pesticide carrier, and horticulture markets. The rise in antimony prices have 


been the greatest driver of UAMY’s revenue growth in the past few years. The company has seen 


stagnant antimony volumes since 2007, so the growth in their revenue is primarily a function of 


antimony price inflation.   


UAMY is purely a processor of antimony; they acquire the concentrates, and sell the final products at 


market prices to earn a low margin spread. An analysis of their costs indicate that, for the quarter ended 


March 31, 2012, raw materials were approximately 50% of cost of goods sold.  Most of their production 


costs are fixed in nature, and cannot be decreased easily without decreasing production.  While UAMY 


has managed to earn just 1 penny per share the past two years, a closer look at the company’s free cash 


flow reveals a more perilous situation. The company has never generated a single dollar of free cash 


flow in the past 5 years, and is burning capital at an accelerated rate.

Riskless Investment or Skeletons in the Closet? 


When we review prospective investments, we always pay close attention to the risk factors listed in a 


company’s annual report or prospectus. What we found in UAMY’s 10k risk disclosures shocked us. We 


found only 3 risk factors faced by the company, which made us wonder if UAMY was the least risky 


investment we had ever evaluated, or a company that was hiding skeletons in the closet?  The very first 


risk factor blew our mind: 


1) If we were liquidated, our common stockholders could lose part, or all, of their investment. 


“In the event of our dissolution, the proceeds (if any) realized from the liquidation of our assets will be 


distributed to our stockholders, only after the satisfaction of the claims of our creditors and preferred 


stockholders.  The ability of a purchaser of shares to recover all, or any, portion of the purchase price for 


the shares, in that event, will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied by 


those funds.” 


On the surface, UAMY’s balance sheet looks ok, with a positive book value of $11.6 million, and no 


imminent debt obligations. The disclosure is a big red flag because we don’t typically see companies 


warn investors so boldly upfront as a first risk factor that in liquidation they could lose all or part of their 


investment. Perhaps, the second risk factor is where investors should be paying closer attention: 


2) We may have unasserted liabilities for environmental reclamation. 


“Our research, development, manufacturing and production processes involve the controlled use of 


hazardous materials, and we are subject to various environmental and occupational safety laws and 


regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and 


some waste products….We do not have environmental liability insurance now, and we do not expect to 


be able to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost. “ 


This disclosure should make any prudent investor worry. UAMY is in the business of processing 


potentially hazardous materials and they can’t afford to obtain insurance at a reasonable price? The only 


reasonable interpretation we can draw from this statement, is that UAMY is operating an extremely 


risky business, such that no insurer is even willing to cover them at any premium rate.
8 1991 Broadway, 27th Floor *  New York, NY 10023 * ph. 212-579-1176 


www.sprucepointcap.com 





3) We have accruals for asset retirement obligations and environmental obligations 


“We have accruals totaling $241,500 on our balance sheet at December 31, 2011, for our environmental 


reclamation responsibilities and estimated asset retirement obligations. If we are not able to adequately 


perform these activities on a timely basis, we could be subject to fines and penalties from regulatory 


agencies.” 


Of the three risk disclosure, this one appears to be the most innocuous. However, we are slightly 


skeptical that less than $250,000 is all that’s necessary for environmental and reclamation activities for 


an operation such as UAMY’s that’s been around for decades.  


Overall, we are concerned by the dearth of risk factor disclosures made available to investors. UAMY 


operates in an extremely cyclical, capital intensive, and competitive business, yet offers no explanations 


that cover the multitude of ways that investors can be harmed. The company’s international activities in 


Mexico, and possible dealings with China, also add another layer of risks not formally addressed to 


shareholders. These omissions may have real consequences for the company in the future at significant 


costs to shareholders through lawsuits if future results fail to materialize as expected.  


Capital Structure Leaves Little Value for Common Shareholders 


In the table below we detail UAMY’s capital structure. The major surprise for new shareholders should 


be the significant amount of preferred stock in the capital structure. The preferred stock has rights to 


earnings ahead of common shareholders, and offers cumulative dividends that are currently in arrears. 


The preferred stock liquidation value of $5.7 million currently exceeds the amount of cash on hand, and 


is ~65% of the company’s current book value.

No “Smart Money” Institutional Shareholders Own UAMY 


If we are to believe that UAMY is a major force in the antimony market with significant upside earnings 


potential, and undiscovered asset value, surely we would expect to find some of the savviest hedge 


funds, value investors, and smart money crowd owning large blocks of shares. To the contrary, the 


current shareholder base is one of mystery and intrigue. While we are pleased to see the CEO has a 


large ownership stake, the remainder of the shareholders appear to have no experience in the mining 


business. The current roster of shareholders includes a dermatologist, dentist, veterinarian, and oil 


wildcatter.  The majority of shares in the float are held by the public. Institutions appear to refuse 


owning the shares and currently have ~1%.

precisely to maximize its chances of selling its shares to new investors, and to capitalize on the 


misperception that antimony is the latest must own commodity. We are not just speculating that this is 


the reason, we have proof it is already happening.  On June 25
th


 the company announced a quick capital 


raise of $2.8 million by issuing 953k of shares at $3.00 and nearly a half million warrants struck at $4.50.

The company wasn’t shy about sticking it hard to its existing investors through punitive dilution. The 


stock had closed the previous day at $4.20/share, so the issuance came at a whopping 28% discount to 


the closing price. This discount is 2x larger than the discount used for a $2 million capital raise earlier 


this year on Jan 13, 2012.

The most concerning aspect of UAMY’s potential dilution is the overhang of the Series D preferred stock. 


The 1.75 million shares have a liquidation value of $4.7 million.  It makes perfect sense to convert them 


and slowly sell them into the open market. We believe this major overhang could cause UAMY’s share 


price to deflate sharply when the Series D preferred is converted. An additional 1.8 million warrants 


outstanding also mature in the next few years, with some in-the-money. 


There are also reasons why UAMY’s largest shareholder, the Dugan family, could begin selling large 


blocks of their 6.3 million shares. According to public record, family patriarch Al Dugan recently passed 


away in October 2011.

 The oil and real estate business appeared to have been his core holdings; 


therefore, it would not be surprising to see his family holdings diversified away from riskier holdings 


such as UAMY stock.  


UAMY’s Growth Plans Hinge on a Once Worthless Asset with No Proof of Any Reserves 


If there ever were a case to be made that UAMY’s share price offered compelling value at a $200 million 


valuation, there would have to be significant tangible evidence that the company owned vast antimony 


holdings, and had a clear path to production and earnings leverage. Investors are currently being lured 


by the prospect that UAMY will be realizing potential upside from their Los Juarez mining properties in 


Mexico. UAMY also owns the Puerto Blanco mill, and a smelter at Madero. Combined, UAMY is telling 


investors that these operations are expected to begin producing a significant portion of their raw 


materials in Q2’2012. The production of concentrated smelter feed from their Mexico operations 


shipped to the Montana smelter for refining is expected to allow UAMY to produce more products for 


sale during the ensuing reporting periods.  They expect to have a lower production cost and a greater 


recovery of precious metals due to the increased smelter feed from Mexico.  


There is one very BIG problem with this business plan that investors must take a leap of faith on that 


UAMY bluntly discloses:  


We have no "proven reserves" or "probable reserves" of antimony or zeolite, as these terms are defined 


by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In other words, there are zero assurances that UAMY will produce any antimony quantities of sufficient 


quality and duration to cover any of its capital and operating costs. UAMY offers some explanation, 


which also leads more to hope than actual proof their Mexican assets have any value. They claim that 


their Mexican properties, including San Miguel I, II and part of San Juan III, were originally drilled by 


Penoles (Mexico’s 2
nd


 largest mining company) in 1970, when antimony metal prices were high. They did 


not proceed with the property, due to the complex metallurgy of antimony. Subsequently, the Mexican 


Government did additional work and reported a reserve of 1,000,000 metric tons (mt) grading 1.8% 


antimony and 8.1 ounces of silver per metric ton (opmt) in Consejo de Recursos  Minerales (Publicacion 


M-4e). However, the Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize this report, and the 


Company claims no reserves. We believe that if the metallurgy was difficult and uneconomic to 


develop 30 years ago, chances are these assets are still difficult and uneconomic. 


An even closer look into UAMY’s history in Mexico corroborates our suspicion. UAMY has two Mexican 


subsidiaries:  ADM and USAMSA. Antimonio de Mexico SA de Cv "ADM" was incorporated in 2005 under 


the laws of Mexico and the State of Jalisco. On December 16, 2005, ADM signed a contract and option 


agreement that gives ADM the exclusive right to explore and exploit the San Miguel I and San Miguel II 


concessions for an annual payment of $50,000, and an option to purchase payment of $100,000 


annually. Total payments would not exceed $1,430,344, reduced by IVA taxes paid. During the years 


ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $186,956, $186,956 and $86,956 was paid or accrued and 


capitalized as mineral rights towards ADM. ADM is presently being merged into United States Antimony, 


Mexico S.A. de C.V. “USAMSA,” which was formed in 1998 through a 50% interest. UAMY had written off 


its 50% stake as entirely worthless (aka $0) on December 31, 2005 due to volatile antimony prices and 


the lack of operating and development capital. During 2006, UAMY acquired the 50% interest in the 


stock of USAMSA for just $165,000 in the form of $48,500 of cash, $61,000 of UAMY common stock, and 


a $55,000 note payable.  The company has spent $5.5 million since 2006 to prepare its Mexican 


operations for this supposed ramp in production, so we believe its shareholders shouldn’t be terribly 


surprised if future results fail to meet expectations.

UAMY Has Material Financial Weaknesses and Financial Control Issues 


As of June 30, 2012, UAMY reported material weaknesses affecting their disclosure controls and 


procedures and, as a result of those weaknesses, their disclosure controls and procedures were not 


effective. These material weaknesses are as follows: 


 The Company lacks proper segregation of duties.  The president authorizes the majority of the 
expenditures and signs checks 


 During its year-end audit,  the company’s independent registered accountants discovered 
material misstatements in our financial statements that required audit adjustments 


We reviewed these material weaknesses and found that the company has had them listed since 2007. In 


other words, the company has failed to address these issues for over 5 years and has repeatedly had 


financial misstatements. Key Takeaway:  Investors should approach the company’s financials with 


extreme caution.   





UAMY is Excessively Overvalued, and Worth No More Than 50 Cents 


We have used a couple common sense approaches to determine that UAMY is excessively overvalued. 


First, let’s consider the company’s market value in relation to the market opportunity for antimony 


products. According to the company’s own 10k disclosure on page 5, they estimate their share of the 


domestic antimony products market is approximately 2%. This would imply a staggering $10.5 billion 


dollar market value for the entire U.S. antimony market. However, as we’ve shown earlier in our 


analysis, the entire world market for antimony products is approximately 169,000 metric tons. The 


current price is approximately $14,000 per metric ton, which equates to $2.4 billion in annual world 


turnover. The U.S. consumes approximately 16% of world production, so we estimate a total revenue 


opportunity in the U.S. of approximately $372 million. This figure is nearly as large as UAMY’s entire 


market cap even though the company only has a 2% share of the market. The absurdity of UAMY’s 


valuation in relation to the total world and US market opportunity for antimony is illustrated below.

We have also evaluated UAMY’s value in relation to known antimony players across the world and 


determined its shares to be exorbitantly overvalued. In the table below, we have listed a variety of 


companies engaged in antimony mine production, value added products, and exploration.

The largest world producer and smelter of antimony is Hunan Nonferrous Metals (HK:  2626), which 


produces 34,000 tons of antimony per year, and also produces zinc, tungsten, lead and other metals. 


The next largest producer of antimony products is Campine NV (EBR: CAMB) of Belgium. Lastly, Village 


Main Reef (JSE: VIL) in South Africa and Mandalay Resources (TSE: MDN) of Australia mine 


approximately 4,600 tons and 1,700 tons, respectively. Antimony is typically found near gold and silver 


deposits, so investors in these two companies also receive production ounces of these precious metals.  


At the bottom of the table is UAMY with a paltry 675 metric tons of antimony, and a de minims amount 


of gold, silver and zeolite.

We have also tabulated a list of every deal we could find in the past few years that included an antimony 


asset and was stunned that the average deal size was approximately $40 million. The only operating 


mine in North America is Canada’s Beaver Brook Antimony Mine which was acquired by Hunan 


Nonferrous in 2009 for $30 million. Even if we assume its value has doubled or tripled in the past few 


years given the rise in antimony prices, it would put the value of Beaver Brook at $60 - $90 million. 


Beaver Brook reportedly spent $15 million to revive the mine, planned to produce 6,000 metrics tons

  To put UAMY’s Mexico ambitions in perspective, the 


company has spent under $6 million since 2006, is estimating a maximum throughput of 1,800 tons per 


annum, and has no proven reserves. From this perspective, UAMY’s $200 million enterprise value 


appears wildly unjustified.

From a valuation perspective, there is no way to justify UAMY’s exorbitant valuation. UAMY is trading at 


14x sales vs. 0.9x peer average and a 300x P/E vs. a 13.5x peer average. If we applied the peer group 


multiples to UAMY’s current financials, we estimate the share price would between $0.20 cents. 


Because the company has no proven or probable reserves, we give no credit for future revenue or 


earnings upside, which we view as entirely speculative. On the other hand, if you consider that the 


company has spent approximately $5.5 million on its Mexican operations since 2006, and take a leap of 


faith that it could yield a 3x return on the investment, this would be only worth an additional $0.30 


cents per share or a total share price of approximately $0.50 cents.

Conclusion:  High Risk, Little Reward for Owning Shares of UAMY 


We have conducted extensive research into United States Antimony and determined a highly 


unfavorable risk / reward proposition. We are concerned that investors are ascribing too high a value to 


the company’s earnings potential and misunderstanding the prospects for the antimony market. The 


overvaluation of UAMY is directly attributable to excessive promotion of their earnings prospects. The 


promotion first started in April 2011, when the company paid for a Wall Street Transcript interview.
8
 


Shortly after, a Forbes article intimated that UAMY might be the next Molycorp, and could do $100 


million of revenues and $0.30 cents of earnings by 2013. With a year to go, UAMY would have to 


increase revenues and earnings by 7x and 30x to reach these lofty goals.
 9
   UAMY is also covered by one 


sell-side research firm with an aggressive $5 target, and a SeekingAlpha.com blogger who claims the 


company is sitting on billions worth of antimony and could be a $45 stock.
10





Antimony is undoubtedly a scarce commodity, but demand potential is limited to a few end markets, 


and growth will not outperform GDP. Unlike rare earths, antimony will not play a leading role in future 


technologies, and has numerous substitutes. The price of antimony has already adjusted in the past few 


years to changes in China’s policies, and is unlikely to move any higher now that Chinese growth is 


slowing, and new sources of supply are aggressively being explored and brought to market.  UAMY is 


indeed the sole U.S. processor of antimony, but it controls only 2% of the US market, and has never 


been able to generate consistently positive earnings.  


In our opinion, the company’s recent AMEX listing is not a major corporate milestone to signal future 


upside opportunities for new shareholders. Rather, the listing provides a platform for the company to 


rapidly dilute public shareholders, and offer long-time holders a better means to liquidate large 


holdings. The company’s capital structure also does not support additional value for common 


shareholders because of the large preferred stock classes that must be liquidated or converted.  


However, our biggest concern is the excessive valuation of the company at $200 million that hinges on 


them commercializing new antimony deposits in Mexico without any proven or probable reserves. 


Investors are risking major disappointment if actual results do not meet or beat expected results. 


Because of the deficient financial filings, material weaknesses, and omission of numerous risk factors, 


UAMY would face countless shareholder lawsuits. We have presented a plethora of comparable 


companies and transactions to show the degree of overvaluation in UAMY’s share price. By giving no 


value to the Mexican operations due to their highly speculative nature, we believe UAMY’s share price 


would be worth no more than $0.20 cents if it were valued at peer averages.  On the other hand, if you 


consider that the company has spent only $5.5 million on its Mexican operations since 2006 and it could 


yield even a wildly bullish return of 3x on the investment, this would be only worth an additional $0.30 


cents per share or a total share price of $0.50 cents. Ironically, this is exactly where the share price was 


trading about a year ago before the first promotional efforts from the company began.
