Avanir - Closing Short Position
Nov. 27, 2011 8:09 AM ET25 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


I recommended shorting Avanir at $4.62 on 5/31/2011. Friday, 11/25/2011, the shares
closed at $2.00, or -57%. This is annualized return of 146%. Even if shorting Avanir was a
small position in your portfolio, you would be having a good year on this trade alone.
Congratulations if you joined me in shorting.


Avanir is not a compelling long just because I am no longer short. When I invest, I am
acutely focused on the return profile of the proposed investment. Quite simply, I have to
have some idea of what the return profile is, and the risks associated with that profile.
Funding of the trade is relevant as well -- most of you don't operate insurance companies
or other businesses that bring in cash. Don't mistake the ways others invest for things that
you should do unless you fully understand their "setup".


One silly myth I'd like to dispel is that it's difficult to make large returns shorting stocks like
Avanir. The 146% annualized return generated in this trade is a building block to some of
the best returns you can get in the market today.


I'm not here for page views. I'm here to make readers money. Why? I have my reasons -
suffice it to say, it does not involve manipulating your thinking. A sucker is born every
minute, and the supply of people who want to get rich quick will never dry. One person
could never combat these waves of ignorance.


Let us recap the performance of my ideas thus far:

These results are great, but the IRR assumes you can continue to find high quality ideas
routinely. If you do this full-time, like me, you might be able to. I haven't published a lot of
new ideas as I've been busy with some other major projects. However I promise to give
you a fresh batch shortly!


Happy trading.


Disclosure: I am short MBLTY.PK, ONTY, CIGX, HGSI, NEOP.


Additional disclosure: I am long CHTP and BMRN. I may change my positions at any
time without notice.

Some of your methodology and actions may be viewed as questionable and/or suspect. Nonetheless, congrats on the
gains.

Bert, his "methodology and actions may be viewed as questionable and/or suspect"?!? He shorted AVNR, for
instance, on 5/31 as shown in the table above, then released/published his BS hit job "patents won't hold up"
article the very same day? If that's not a "questionable" action I don't know what is! He did the exact same
thing with NEOP too, probably all of the shorted stocks. He uses SA as his bully pulpit to spread FUD.


God only know why it's not illegal (yet).....and if the groundswell to prevent congress-critters from trading on
inside info leads to real action (not likely, but will shine some light on the cockroach's should-be-criminal
activity) perhaps someday the SEC will get around to moving on bloggers writing pure fiction to further their
own financial gain.

Hi Marty. Enough to have banked some decent coin on the name, as well. (without having to put out a hack
piece)

Martin, The ultimate test will be if NEOP is approved/rejected by FDA. If it is approved by FDA, then all the
gains that u had are using questionable practices (Well, it does not matter then, because u already made ur
money, but Bernie Madoff also made lot of money using some questionable practices. Unfortunately Martin, u
have swooped to those levels). If it is rejected then you stand right.

I am wondering of the charity if choice and the integrity of the contributor, in reference to the following comment:


"Additional disclosure: I promise to donate 50% of my personal AVNR-related profits to charity. I agree to be held
accountable to this."

You wrote a piece about Avanir which had a central essential falsehood, i.e. that its pertinent patent was from 2005
and that data from 2004 therefore made the patents unenforceable. The important data was actually from the Pope
article of 2004, not the article of the Phase 3 study you cited but that was a minor mistake of yours. 
Your major problem, was that the patent was enforceable from when it was originally submitted as a preliminary
patent around July, 2002. This was also stated by Avanir's Investor Relations. 
In your original article you boasted that you could go into "great detail" on intellectual property and your firm hired
experts and this was your "day job" and so on and so forth. 
But when your central falsehood was pointed out to you, you did not even acknowledge it although you spent the time
to indulge in all kinds of silly banter quoting TV shows and movies with posters and became a regular message board
participant on at least two message boards. 
The Seeking Alpha article was taken off Yahoo's "Headlines" and I imagine it was because of the central falsehood in
the article. 
No doubt some small investors sold the stock based on your 
article with the central falsehood--although luckily they did well as the stock price decreased.

You have replied on message boards that all you care about is "making money" and you taunted in another message
that you had taken the longs' money. 
Apparently, you care about others thinking you have great investing acumen. 
If you write an article that gets incorrectly labelled "Headlines" by Yahoo and you pass yourself off as a
knowledgeable hedge fund manager, declare yourself an expert on intellectual property issues and you claim a small
biotech with one drug has an unenforceable patent, based on a falsehood and never acknowledge the falsehood and
the stock goes down, does that mean you have investing acumen? 
I think anyone could do that but not many would choose to do it. 
Obviously the stock did not go all the way down to $2 based on your article so you get credit for the vast majority of
your short term gain from when you shorted AVNR at $4.22. 
You made perhaps a legitimate 50% gain on your short.  
Longs in small biotechs sometimes make 1000% when things work out and that more than balances out 19
investments where they lose 50%. But you don't see Seeking Alpha articles from longs saying they made 1000%
much, nor do you see them extrapolating a 50% gain in less than a year to an annualized 100% gain to try to show
what great investors they are. 
Have to wonder why you do this on a small investor message board except either as an ego thing or trying to
augment your reputation for the next time you write an article with core inaccuracies to try to again have it have a big
impact on small investors who put their trust in you.  
Yahoo should put blogs like yours in the "blogging" section, not as "Headlines". 
All my opinion of course.

Please notice that after claiming to be a professional advised by intellectual property experts, he never
addresses that his original blog on Avanir centered on an intellectual property falsehood that was repeatedly
pointed out to him to be false and yet he never corrected it .


28 Jul 2012, 04:43 PM


rayonman
And you don't calculate interest charges while maintaining a short but clearly that would eat into the profits of most
small investors who followed your advice.

I am 100% in agreement on Chelsea Therapeutics! I don't have to tell you my research, as you more likely know more
about the company than me. But I have a large amount of shares, that I predict will see $10/share by mid 2012.
Thank You for a overall great article!
