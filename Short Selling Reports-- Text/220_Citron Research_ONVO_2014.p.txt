Citron Issues URGENT Trading Warning to the Public 
regarding Organovo.   





At the present moment, Organovo (NYSEMKT:ONVO) is a highly speculative company in biotech 
which has been swept up in the mania for 3D printing stocks.  ONVO has been spinning a story 
that its technology would allow the “bio-printing” of replacement organs.   
 
Admittedly this “story” has sizzle but that is where it stops.  Citron is not going to waste readers 
time rehashing the arguments that have been made tirelessly by writers showing that 
Organcovo is nothing but fluff and the technology discussed by the company is 10 years away 
and they are not even the most credible player in the space, even when compared to the 
accomplishments and strategic partnerships of companies with 1 / 100


th
 of ONVO’s current 


market value.  
 
Here is some of the great research done by others on Organovo:

%E2%80%93-Pfizer-NYSE-PFE-partnership 
 


Citron cannot think of a stock with this high market cap and so little institutional ownership or 
analyst coverage. 
 
Citron notes that biotech funds are some of the sharpest research guys out there.  And not a 
single one appears here.

 So with all of that known, we ask ourselves the age old question:  
“Who buys this SH$% ?” 


 
Answer:  Yes, They Have Wolves in Japan 





On January 7, 2014, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority issued a warning 
specifically about Kanagawa Associates unauthorized cold-calling on ONVO stock into Sweden.

As US regulators have done a wonderful job shutting down these types of operations, boiler 
rooms selling U.S. securities have been popping up worldwide. 
 
Online commentator  “unemom” has done an excellent job explaining the issue:

Citron produces the following links to verify that the warning and the agency is legitimate:

Associates/  
 


2)  The Japanese Financial Services Agency issues a warning about Kanagawa – 
Cold Calling – Investor Alert (Latest Update November 2013)  
http://www.fsa.go.jp/en/refer/cold/ 
 


Again, the agency is legitimate.

3)  Further ominous signs about Kanagawa and Nakamura, which are easily verifiable:  
Kanagawa operates with the identical address, phone number and fax number as “Nakamura 
Venture Capital”  http://nakamura-venturecapital.com/  
(Note:  Isn’t it humorous that the websites for these companies both appear in English only, 
despite their Tokyo location? )  
 
 


   Analyst Coverage 
 


It goes without saying that Citron has no love lost for sell side research, but when a company 
has a $ 3/4 billion dollar market cap with limited to no sell side research, than buyers have to 
be especially on guard.  As for Organovo, it appears that the only firm that covers them is JMP 
Securities.   


 
Needless to say JMP was a placement agent for 4 million shares with insider selling:  
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1497253/000119312513457208/d636802d424b5.htm  
 
BTW:  The coverage from JMP had the stock fully valued at $8 a share. 
 


   Conclusion 
 


Please note that at present Citron has no evidence, and is not suggesting, that the boiler room 
operations retailing ONVO stock are explicitly linked in any way to the corporate governance of 
Organovo Holdings; yet management has not been shy about selling stock into this upward 
movement. 
 
What is a problem is that Organovo has tied its heavily hyped story to the promise of a 
collaboration with Pfizer.  Large companies’ compliance departments are usually extremely 
cautious about creating over-exaggerated promises of relationships with smaller companies 
that invoke their name, especially in the context of small-cap stocks.

Organovo and Government Boiler Room Alerts   January 21, 2014 Page 4 of 4 





With no signs of a legitimate and enduring material research relationship between Pfizer and 
Organovo emerging since the latter’s vague (no financial details) announcements over a year 
ago, these warnings create a situation of extreme risk.  Due to the emergence of these boiler 
room associations, and the warnings of legitimate government agencies, Pfizer’s hand could 
now well be forced – to distance itself from Organovo -- removing the uncertainty which has 
invited speculators to chase Organovo to a near-billion dollar valuation… on nothing but 
dreams.  This would cause an immediate cliff-dive for ONVO stock.   
 
Unfortunately, that is exactly the type of event which would wake up the most naïve victims of 
these cold-callers – too late to save their money.  
 


 Cautious Investing to All.
