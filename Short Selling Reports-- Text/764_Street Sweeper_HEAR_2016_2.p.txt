Turtle Beach: Digging The Hole Even Deeper
Sep. 28, 2016 11:51 AM ET28 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Turtle reverse-merged into a company holding old, unwanted technology. After
holding on a couple of years, Turtle finally realizes it's a losing proposition and
announces restructuring plans for the division.


With cash dwindling to $1 million, Turtle is left to try to squeeze profit from the
troubled gaming headset division.


Turtle's headsets are largely ignored by reviewers and many are doomed to discount
bins. Meanwhile, gamers are playing on their phones, eliminating the need for
consoles and headsets.


Net revenues in the first half of the year are down dramatically from 2013. Net losses
have more than doubled.


Return on equity and profit margins are far worse than the rest of the industry.
Institutional ownership is extremely low. Additionally, Turtle has disclosed a material
weakness in financials.


Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR) has forgotten Will Rogers' famous quote: "If you find
yourself in a hole, stop digging."


The San Diego, California headset company has dug itself into a money pit that
necessitates the desperate restructuring of its HyperSound business. But in our view, the
effort will only prolong the misery, as Turtle creeps toward further decline. Let's look at
nine reasons TheStreetSweeper expects more Turtle troubles.


1. Reverse Merger Grabs Old, Unwanted Technology


Turtle became publicly traded in January 2014 via a reverse merger stock swap with
Parametric Sound Corp. (PAMT), whose technology centered on directing sound waves in
a narrow beam.


MDB Capital underwrote Parametric just prior to the merger. TheStreetSweeper has
written about the decline of other companies underwritten by MDB Capital, including Uni-
Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) and Resonant (NASDAQ:RESN).

Parametric had traded as a penny stock until it conducted a 5-for-1 reverse stock split in
early 2012. Parametric received the money-losing HSS technology through a 2010 spin-
off from LRAD Corp., which had grown tired of the unappreciated tech. LRAD CEO Tom
Brown said, "we have been unsuccessful in developing a market for HSS, [and] we have
no current plans to invest further resources in it."


That technology has been around nearly two decades now and has been very slow to
commercialize. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration cleared HyperSound for
marketing to people who wanted 
improved "clarity and comprehension of sounds."


This is where the odd story gets even odder.


2. HyperSound Gets Off To A Bad Start


So with the FDA's clearance in hand, Turtle might have been expected to rush off to target
audiologists or consumers with hearing impairment. But no. They went after gamers.


Turtle chose to commercialize by launching HyperSound embedded in displays of
Activision's videogame Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in around 1,000 Best Buy stores.


By then, the 11-year-old Advanced Warfare series was showing signs of decline, Forbes
warned Activision investors. Franchise fatigue had set in for many fans, and they
demanded something new and different - but HyperSound didn't fit the bill.


The bad news had just begun for Turtle's effort. Best Buy soon endured a drop in
customer traffic, despite aggressive, expensive promotions. Within two years of Turtle's
display launch, the retailer closed 50 stores, and has continued to quietly close stores
through the present.


In short, after HyperSound had been abandoned, Turtle turned around and mis-marketed
it. But it took a long time before Turtle decided the other guys were right.


3. Guess What Gets Restructured?


Fast forward to recent days. Now Turtle has decided it's time to restructure - something
that is virtually always the beginning of the end.


Indeed, Turtle announced Sept. 26 the restructuring of its money-gobbling legacy product
HyperSound.

Though the announcement may have surprised investors, there were plenty of signs that
Turtle was getting fed up - or at least should have been getting fed up - with this
technology the company hitched itself to just before its IPO. In fact, the company has
repeatedly noted that HyperSound has done nothing but create operating losses:


Our HyperSound business has not generated significant revenues, has a history of
operating losses, expects additional losses and may not achieve or sustain
profitability. [source]


Our HyperSound business has incurred operating losses since the spin-off of
Parametric Sound Corporation from LRAD Corporation in 2010, and we expect
additional losses in the near-term as we continue to expend significant resources on
personnel, consultants, intellectual property protection, research and development,
marketing, production and administration. [source]


Even as HyperSound continued to drag on the company, leaders talked up the technology.


CEO Juergen Stark said during the Q1 2015 earnings call:


The quarter was also highlighted by good progress for the launch of our HyperSound
healthcare products scheduled for later this year.


Turtle seemed to shift focus from the weird idea of marketing HyperSound to gamers to:


...executing the successful launch of our HyperSound hearing product. Our
groundbreaking in-home solution for helping people with hearing loss to better
understand and enjoy TV, music and other media.


But Turtle seemed to shift focus again months later. The Q4 2015 earnings call
concentrated on the headset business (initially held by the parent holding company) and
away from the bothersome legacy product...So we should have expected that
restructuring announcement that came about two months later.


There will be lots of slicing and dicing, considering the company last year invested a
whopping $11.6 million to commercialize HyperSound and add some headsets to its
lineup.


So if HyperSound ever had a speck of potential we can safely assume it's just about all
gone. And potential isn't the only thing that's coming up short.

4. Cash-Poor


Imagine having to operate a business on one-sixth the cash that was available just six
months ago. That's Turtle's situation. Turtle is running out of cash:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The company had about $12 million in revolving and term loans on June 30, 2016. Excess
borrowing availability is $4.9 million. But it looks like some sort of capital raise will be
needed in the future.


But what is the potential for the remaining business - gaming headsets?


5. Headsets: Once Moldy, Now Ignored


Turtle's headset business has been troubled and still looks uncertain.


Just last October, the company had to recall ~$6 million worth of its next-generation
gaming headsets due to mold problems.


(Source: US Consumer Product Safety Commission)


With this recall well behind Turtle Beach, its headsets still weren't mentioned in the 2016
headset review by PC Gamer:

(Source: wiki.ezvid, click to view list)


And Turtle's product barely squeaked by to earn last place in PCMag's review:


The reviewer commented: "Turtle Beach's Ear Force Stealth 450 is an affordable and
functional wireless gaming headset, but it's a solid example of getting what you pay for. It
doesn't sound bad and it doesn't feel cheap, but it pales in comparison with the Editors'
Choice Logitech Artemis G933. If you really want a wireless headset, the G933 or the
Skullcandy PLYR 1 ($149.99 at Amazon) are much better options, though more
expensive."

*6. Bargain Basement Discounts


Fierce competitors' new cutting-edge products often send older, less desirable products
straight to the discount bin. And that's what Turtle is enduring with some of its products,
according to an Amazon search:


In some cases, customers were picking up Turtle's headsets at discounts as steep as
47%.


7. Smartphone Trend Weakens Opportunity

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4008946-turtle-beach-digging-hole-even-deeper 8/17


Entertainment Software Association has been tracking an interesting trend. The group
found that a whopping 36 percent of the most frequent gamers play on their smartphones.


That means Turtle products will face additional challenges as more and more gamers play
video games on their smartphones, turning up their noses at video consoles that require
headsets.


If that trend continues as expected, Turtle could see a continuation of another unfortunate
trend...


8. Losses Increase


Turtle is seeing increasing net losses. While net revenue did increase 26% in the first half
of the year, net losses more than doubled:

While the industry is recording horrible profit margins over the past 12 months, Turtle's are
even worse:

When we look at how many dollars of profit Turtle generates for each dollar of
shareholders' equity, we find that return on equity is poor:

The institutions must have seen all the signs, and decided they don't want Turtle.


(Source: Nasdaq)


9. Material Weakness Revealed


Last, but not least, Turtle revealed in its most recent 10-Q (see page 35) that the company
has "identified a material weakness in [its] internal control over financial reporting" that has
not yet been remedied. This is not only a confidence-killer but could lead to issues such as
late filings, restatements, and even suspension or delisting from the Nasdaq.

Turtle is not a growth stock or a turnaround stock. This reverse-merger company can't
seem to stop digging even as it faces continuing losses, low cash, institutional apathy,
miserable returns, unremarkable products, and a restructuring of its legacy business.


Turtle stock is quickly turning into turtle soup. We think adventurous consumers will soon
be able to scoop up a cold cupful for just $0.85 per share, which we see as a very
reasonable valuation.

What a garbage of an article - nice try with sensationalist reporting.


Your "short" thesis speaks absolutely nothing about HEAR's 20%+ growth in new headsets and 2016 being the final
year of legacy sales (already down to 5%). If they are so weak how did they get 40% market share in their core
markets?


Many small caps have "weaknesses" in their financial filings but since when was this evidence the company would be
delisted? Care to justify your $0.85 px target? Actually, I don't really care how you got that.


Differences in timing of working capital and cash receipts thru the year obviously leads to the fluctations in cash
balance you speak of.


Your entire article is nothing but pomp and exaggeration, trying to manipulate the stock price so you gain financing.
Piece of scum.


"Losses increase" - what are you smoking. It's because of the investments in Hyper-Sound, which will soon be off the
balance sheet so that the clean core headsets biz will be seen. It's not a new story. Core headsets biz gets 10%
operating margins or more.

Perfectly fine here with a short biased article because after all, we're all in this to make money. But for those who are
used to seeing balanced writing, I'm going to bring in some of the positive aspects of company that were not
addresses above :


1. They have ongoing discussions in place, right now, for Hypersound glass. Licensing in fact is a new shift for them
as they are not tied to the heavy SG&A focused audiologist market. Heck if they wanted to they could sell the Tinnitus
solution now on QVC if they wanted to.


2. The mold issue with the headsets is so like 1980. They made a mistake and they fixed it. Can we please stop
dragging around this dead horse? Have you seen mold on anything after that?


3. Any idea on who is looking or involved with Hypersound right now? McDonalds had a test to beam audio to your
table for an extra fee. Build a bear is using it. There is research out in a very top end college on the west coast where
US car manufacturers are looking at Hypersound to augment a car's horn in that the car could "speak" to pedestrians
too close to the moving vehicle. And lastly a "7-11" type store in the EU tested this and unit sales went through the
roof when they used Hypersound to beam audio about a product to a person in line.


4. Museums, Hershey Park and all sorts of other places are very interested in using Hypersound in a kiosk type
"personalized" model


5. Headsets are actually pacing ahead of forecasts for the year...did you miss this part?


6. If Piper is involved and this spins off or is sold, don't you think that will actually add value for existing shareholders?


The company at Turtle Beach and those involved were not born yesterday. I'm very confident that they will figure out a
way to navigate through these issues.


Caveat here that I personally have (as I have been 100% bullish in my comments ) is that I can't figure out why
Carmine and Romano are dumping shares hand over fist these past few weeks. I know there is a legal action involved
but the reasons for selling still elude me. Its something to keep in mind in addition to all that I mentioned above.


Secondly I think the issue with Hypersound is from an ROI standpoint I mean seriously...how many extra units of Red
Bull do you need to sell in a grocery store to offset the licensing cost of installing directed speakers in your check-out
line? Or how many additional tickets do you need to sell at a museum because you installed Hypersound speakers
near each painting?

The Hypersound / Turtle Beach saga is a fantastic story steeped in drama and emotion. To me, that is one of the best
scenarios to be involved when you have pure risk capital involved. This is not an investment for the faint of heart but
certainly something to watch closely if you are looking for large risk and large returns.

Some thoughts. Sadly, Turtle Beach was a solid headset company with 50+ percent market share in the US.
All it needed to do was modernize its business practices and cut production costs to increase margin. That
and clean up the financing so it was more steady and less costly. If someone could get the company cheap
they might be able to revive it. The only value really left is some of the audio engineering talent and the
relationships with Best Buy and some of the other retailers.


Hypersound: 
They should have sold the the Hypersound product on QVC, it might have been successful. But the CEO,
who has no experience in either consumer products or audio, went a different route. He wanted higher
margins so he steered distribution to the audiology/hearing aid market and tripled the retail price. Why? First,
he always chases unrealistic margins. He would chase a 40 point margin and sell 10 units when he could get
a 20 point margin and sell 100,000. Second, he does not like and does not understand marketing or branding.
he thinks products should sell themselves, and he believed the audiologists would sell the product for him
removing any marketing cost.Total disaster. 
The Hypersound case studies you cite pre-date the reverse merger. Go back and read the materials that
support the merger and you will find them mentioned. Not that the technology is not cool, it is. The issue is
cost. When you normally spend $4 on a kiosk speaker and Hypersound wants $80 you have a non-starter.
They have been working hard to cut production costs, but that bleeds money, which the company does not
have much of. The headset business was a cash cow until Stark started meddling with it, now the company is
on thin financial ice.


Gaming: 
Every new headset released in 2015 had a significant problem (14 out of 14 SKUs). As the CEO has
pressured the product design team to cut costs they cut corners, and now headbands snap easily because
the plastic is too weak, wires fray because they are too thin, they are too tight because the headband angles
are wrong, etc. So yes, the mold problem is behind them, but it was indicative of design, Q&A and supply
chain issues that persist. The brand was known as perhaps unexciting, but a genuine gaming brand that
delivered a quality product you could rely on. That is no longer the case. The reputation in the gaming
community has suffered. The majority of new 2016 models are entry-level, where competition is brutal. The
only high-end model was way, way, way overpriced. Why? because Stark is always trying to jam more
technology into the product, which increases costs, instead of focusing on what matters. Just ask the product
team about Superhuman Hearing and watch them roll their eyes.


There is not one person with gaming or audio experience on the management team or in a senior position.
Stark fired every experienced person that he inherited and has replaced them with people from other
industries. They don't understand the gaming industry, they don't even understand how to compete in
consumer electronics.

Sales may be up in 2016, but the company hemorrhaged market share and allowed competitors to dig in
while Stark was distracted by HyperSound. They can never get that share back. And some of the company's
best talent, and the industry relationships they developed, went to competitors.


As for new markets, Stark is totally at sea in China, not that it matters, as Chinese companies are making
headsets and selling them at prices levels that Turtle Beach could never, ever compete at. Europe does well
because he ignores it, but a stronger dollar and a weaker pound mean that Europe is not in a position to help.


With 80 percent of the stock in the hands of less than a dozen people (last I paid attention) shareholders are
left waiting for them to decide to take a loss and move on, selling the company to whomever might want it for
pennies on the dollar. So far they have found no takers.

Product quality has been an issue. Take the 500X for example and note how many users are complaining
about broken headbands. And look at the reviews for the XO One and see that 11 percent rated the product 1
star. The new pro-gamer headset is very well designed, and barring any defects, would be a good sign about
product development in a vacuum. But the price point is significantly higher than what Astro offers, which is a
recurring mistake. They cannot steal markets share from Astro, which is leading at the high end, by pricing
$50 to $150 more. The company, at its core, can make really good gaming headsets, but management is
unrealistic about what the company is and what it can become.

I wrote an article on HEAR a while back. I was too hopeful in China coming on line and the new console cycle, but I at
least hit on Hypersound shortcomings. The fact that management thought Hypersound was going to fit well in the
audiology market at $1,500 is insane.


StreetSweeper are an interesting bunch. At least they put their money where their mouth is. .

Will agree as well that its a shame there are people employed with a salary at Turtle Beach who can make
such short sighted and misguided decisions such as taking on the audiology market as a viable sales
channel.


All someone, anyone, needed to do in the company was to visit 5-10 audiology stores in the mid-west (not in
CA...not in NY) and see first hand what its like in there ( old carpets, water color "sea scape" paintings on the

wall and state-of-the-art IBM computers with CRT monitors).


To think for one second that a high tech tool such as Hypersound that "beams" sound magically through the
air would fit in with this culture is mind boggling. On top of this, you want an 80yr old person who has been
back to the store 5x because he/she can't make up their mind about a hearing aid to plunk down $1,500
instead?


This is why the audio companies in this channel have to spend incredible amounts of marketing dollars just to
get someone in the door - yet another factor Turtle Beach should have looked at before they signed on the
dotted line.


So add this to my caveats above as well when I say management wasn't born yesterday but still that doesn't
make them perfect.

Do not ever, ever, ever assign any value to a USA company that says China is a "huge market" they tap into -
100% of the time it's just talk, because whatever US company that succeeds in China, 2 years later a Chinese

China might be a catch 22 on this technology? Unlike typical Americans the Chinese put a value on the
"quality of quiet". The hypersound technology tends to lend itself to that direction. Hypersound is very high
end technology at todays prices. IMO I think the Chinese market would be very limited right from the get go.

While I enjoy short coverage as they are well usually well researched, this is certainly very biased. How can one
mention PC Magazine without including their "Excellent", "Editor's Choice", September 2, 2016 review of Turtle
Beach's Elite Pro Line

The so-called reviews at PC Mag and many, many other sites are totally meaningless. These are affiliate sites
that collect commissions. They are just advertisements for the companies that are willing to pay. They hire
non-experts (like college students) to write the reviews to attract traffic.

good point, someone who is short doesnt usually notice the positive side of things

I like the fact that you see some value in HEAR, thanks for the article. I have talked to some bears who say they
wouldn't buy it at any price. I wonder how much turtle will get for hypersound...

Worse, how can short article not even attempt to come up with a reasonable enterprise value for the company? There
has been a lot of bad news the last few years that has driven the stock price down to $1 with EV around $100mm.
You cannot pull an $.85 target out of nowhere. The positive case is not that this is a great company but that without
the continuous sales overhang from previous management, an improving headset business, and some monetization
of hypersound, it might be worth a few times more than it is currently, which seems like good risk/reward.

I have one of the lower to midrange Turtle Beach headsets and it is easily the best product at this price point (~$70).
Too bad about the results for shareholders in HEAR.

I've owned 3 Turtle Beach headsets, all of which were great products. The high-end i60 is still the best sounding
headset I've heard. They may well need to improve their business practices, but the quality of their products,
particularly their enthusiast products is superb.

Quality was a hallmark of the company. Then it dipped horribly. It does not surprise me that the new pro line would
return to the earlier levels of quality and I am pleased to hear it. However, that won't swing their financials, the pro line
is overpriced and the segment it targets is quite small. The hope of course is that the pro line would act as a beacon
at the top of the pyramid, and consumers would purchase the mid-range and entry-level headsets based on the
reputation of the pro line. That would only work with an investment in brand marketing.

Wake up People! Please review the Earnings Conference call from December 2016. This company is strategically
growing and making partnerships. This article was written before the latest earnings release. All looks good for HEAR

Just wanted to bring to your attention that last 3 quarters have shown declining losses. And have beaten analysts
estimates in 2 of them.

I'd be curious to see year-end market share in NA. They used to have a share in the low 50s. It has been dropping for
a few years as competitors successfully attacked the mid-level market, which was their bread and butter, and
expanded the lower end of the market where Turtle Beach never had a qwuality presence. Recently Turtle Beach
shifted more of the product mix towards really low-cost, entry-level headphones. It has paid off in increased sales, but
I'm not sure you are going to see a corresponding increase in profitability because the margins are razor thin at the
low end. There is no reason they shoud not be able to clean up the financials and run a small profit. But they will still
be dragged down by servicing the debt they took on with the reverse acquisition. If they can't find a way to profit from
Hypersound (and they have no road map that I can see) they may never dig out from under it.

HEAR has been a huge disappointment. Still trades at 8x 2017 EBITDA guidance with significant uncertainty
subject to both console and game cycles. Major uncertainty in 2018, and management failed to find outlet to
monetize Hypersound. Forget about this stock. Execution mistakes. Management also holds too little of the
company.

How does management hold too little? Yahoo Finance quotes insider and 5% owners ownership share at
73.52% of total company?


29 Mar 2017, 12:45 PM


Project Starshot
Active management Jurgen Stark holds about 1% of the company. Older management are selling out and no
longer involved with running day 2 day ops

The management forecast last year for a break even point with the HyperSound blood letting is 2Q 2017. The last
earnings release indicates they are still on track with that objective. After that I am not certain.

It's not about that. It's about their absolute failure to monetize hypersound, and the vastly reduced rev
guidance. Shows their products aren't competitive.
