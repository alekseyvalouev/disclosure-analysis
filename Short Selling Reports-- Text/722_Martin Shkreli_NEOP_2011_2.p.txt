Neoprobe: Follow-Up on ASCO, Citizen Petition and Readers'
Comments
Jun. 9, 2011 4:08 AM ET279 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


First, thank you for your interest in my writing. I have received a lot of great positive and
less-than-enthusiastic feedback.


Now, on to Neoprobe (NEOP). My guess is most of you did not attend ASCO. For your
viewing pleasure, I am providing the discussant (Dr. Michael S. Sabel) slides and talk on
my website. Dr. Sabel discussed the Lymphoseek results and his talk was right out of my
line of thinking.


Dr. Sabel noted that Lymphoseek is superior to blue dye, but sulfur colloid and blue dye is
the standard of care. He even went as far as to display a slide of an “elephant in a room”
to demonstrate how awkward it was for Neoprobe to conduct a study without sulfur colloid.
He noted how lengthy Neoprobe was in explaining why they used just blue dye as a
comparator, joking that when one goes to great lengths to explain why one is doing
something, it usually is the wrong thing to do.


The discussant simply suggested what I have suggested, Neoprobe should run a study
reflecting the real world. Dr. Sabel presented a slide that said, “How does Lymphoseek
plus blue dye compare to sulfur colloid versus blue dye?” Neoprobe hasn’t answered that
question and the FDA won’t approve Lymphoseek so until they do. Dr. Sabel referred to
Lymphoseek as a “good first step”.


Thing brings me to my Citizen Petition. If you haven’t read my “CP”, it is available on my
website. I can’t talk too much about this as I will let the press release and CP speak for
themselves, but I am pleased to again participate in the FDA process. I have previously
submitted similar materials for MannKind (Nasdaq: MNKD) and Arena (Nasdaq: ARNA).
My track record for predicting FDA outcomes is reasonably good and I hope I am right
once more with Neoprobe.


One more thing about ASCO: There were 22 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in NEO03-
09 which were not well-disclosed by the company. The company says these were not drug
related and won’t go through the details about what the SAEs are. While this included a
30-day follow-up period, I think the FDA will be interested in diving into the safety profile of
Lymphoseek. I’m not totally concerned about this, but some of you might find it alarming.

Let me respond to a lot of your comments. First, I often get the comment, “Lymphoseek is
great for finding the sentinel node, it is better than blue dye with respect to false negatives,
etc.” I hate to be mean on this point, but Lymphoseek is simply further out on the receiver-
operator characteristic curve than blue dye. This is basic diagnostic science and I
encourage you to learn more about it. One can interpret blue dye as liberally as one wants
and achieve the same result. Combined with no sulfur colloid, you really have an
inadequate test that doesn’t merit approval.


I get a lot of comments about RIGS. The market has thought RIGS to be worthless for
some time judging by the share price, but I have reviewed it and here are a few brief
thoughts. RIGS is a neat idea but it fails to exploit tumor biology properly. Surgery margins
are important knowing how much tumor to excise sounds like a fantastic idea. There’s only
one problem: TAG-72, the antibody target of RIGS, is not perfect. In fact, so little is known
about it, I suspect it is not a meaningful diagnostic for tumor margins. We don’t know if
every metastasis will overexpress RIGS, or how sensitive the antibody is, or if it helps
resection and survival. For example, TAG-72 might be so “downstream” of the cancer
process that core mutational processes that go awry in cancer (PARP, AKT, p53 etc) might
be leading indicators for metastasis while TAG-72 is a trailing indicator. There’s just too
much unknown. I look forward to the outcome of any studies Neoprobe is interested in
conducting, but they’ll be expensive and take years. The prior studies look like post-hoc
data mining to me. I promise to investigate RIGS and TAG-72 more, however.


The next comment I get is “Neoprobe is smarter than you, FDA is smarter than you, these
cancer doctors are smarter than you, etc.” I think that after a few years of investing in
healthcare, one realizes that there is a lot of snake oil out there. Management makes
money no matter what the stock price does. Unless Neoprobe is paying you a salary I
would be a little more cynical!


I used one of the expert networking firms to conduct a sulfur colloid pricing survey and the
numbers support my prior article.


Finally be sure to read my Citizen Petition where I show that the FDA did ask Neoprobe to
do a regional nodal dissection study for Lymphoseek and Neoprobe disclosed this in their
2008 Annual Letter to Shareholders. This is one of the most alarming things I’ve seen and
my understanding is Neoprobe doesn’t have a great answer to this. Stay tuned to my page
for an actual long recommendation!


Disclosure: I am short NEOP but may change my position at any time--including
increasing, decreasing, hedging, liquidating or reversing my position.

"“How does Lymphoseek plus blue dye compare to sulfur colloid versus blue dye? Neoprobe hasn’t answered that
question and the FDA won’t approve Lymphoseek so until they do."


Good morning. Interesting statement, considering that Neoprobe has publicly responded to that question in numerous
press releases lately, responses which you've continued to ignore I might add.


As the company officials have explained in detail, during their post-Phase II meetings with FDA to prepare the Phase
III trial design, FDA personnel provided guidance to Neoprobe management that they could not and SHOULD not use
an off-label tracing agent as a comparator in the trial design, but should instead use the only FDA approved tracing
agent, VBD.


Had Neoprobe elected to design a trial contrary to the advice and guidance of FDA personnel, and used an off-label
Sulphur Colloid as the comparator, the data collected from such a trial would been considered irrelevant and could not
have been considered in the FDA’s decision to approve Lymphoseek.


As to your comment, “… the FDA won’t approve Lymphoseek so until they do.”, I have amended my complaint filed
with SEC yesterday to include this statement.


Martin, you’re a hedge fund manager that has disclosed a short position in NEOP. You were not in meetings with FDA
personnel and Neoprobe management, you do not make drug approval decisions and you do not speak for the FDA.
Your misrepresentations as such are deceptive and blatantly manipulative.

I think it's important to realize that in 2008 Neoprobe was told by the FDA (this is in their 2008 Annual Letter
to Shareholders) that approval would require a trial with full nodal dissection. This is logical and supported by
statues as well. With respect to the comparator arm, the FDA has never weighed in publicly. Neoprobe uses
careful language and I think anyone with experience can tell you that the FDA is often difficult to interpret. The
ambiguity they apply in conversations is useful. As they gather facts they can change their mind. Take a look

at MELA. MELA swears that the FDA signed off on their trial. Evidently the FDA disputes this. It's a very
similar situation. I wouldn't trust the company if I were you.


[As the company officials have explained in detail, during their post-Phase II meetings with FDA to prepare
the Phase III trial design, FDA personnel provided guidance to Neoprobe management that they could not
and SHOULD not use an off-label tracing agent as a comparator in the trial design, but should instead use the
only FDA approved tracing agent, VBD. ]


Trusting a small-cap diagnostics company. Very hard to do. Especially when the market is quite small for this
agent in the first place, so the reward is very limited.


[Had Neoprobe elected to design a trial contrary to the advice and guidance of FDA personnel, and used an
off-label Sulphur Colloid as the comparator, the data collected from such a trial would been considered
irrelevant and could not have been considered in the FDA’s decision to approve Lymphoseek.]


There are a lot of damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't situations. That's why I short stocks where the
company is attempting to improve upon a standard of care that can't be improved upon. It's Neoprobe's fault
for even bothering with Lymphoseek.


[As to your comment, “… the FDA won’t approve Lymphoseek so until they do.”, I have amended my
complaint filed with SEC yesterday to include this statement.]


Great!

You didn't read all the subsequent SEC filings.


In 2009 the FDA met with Neoprobe to discuss Lymphoseek's clinical data to date, and the joint decision was
made to seek a designation as General Lymphatic Mapping agent, and pursue specific Sentinel designations
for different indications in post-marketing trials.


That's why the FDA dropped their requirement for ALND-based trials as a condition for approval. It's clearly
spelled out in detail in their SEC filings.

"That's why I short stocks where the company is attempting to improve upon a standard of care that can't be
improved upon." - Martin Shkreli


Let's dig into that. First, VBD + SC is a combination of two agents. That's two injections. I believe every
patient who ever underwent SLNB would agree that ONE shot is better than two. A simple point perhaps, but
I've already proven that the Standard of Care CAN be improved.


Next let's explore the two compounds. Isosulfan Blue is FDA approved for SLNB, but Sulphur Colloid is not. In
fact, I don't believe that Sulphur Colloid has ever been tested in any FDA clinical trial for use in SLNB (Hey,
you may want to submit another CP to stop the use of Sulphur Colloid in SLNB!).


Blue Dye has problems… clinically documented adverse reactions in up to 2% of patients receiving it,
including anaphylactic shock. Blue Dye may not always remain in the node long enough for surgical
identification due to its quick transit time. Another disadvantage is the inability to preoperatively identify the
site of the SLN. As a result, incisions may be placed some distance away from the SLN, resulting in longer
flaps and extensive dissection (Noguchi, 2001).


Sulphur Colloid has its own set of shortcomings due to its molecular makeup, including excessively long
injection site clearance and inconsistent nodal uptake. Some use a filtering process to enhance these
performance issues, but the boiling & filtering process takes additional preparation time. However, the larger
issue with Sulphur Colloid is that it does not bind to the Sentinel Node, instead passing through the node to
subsequent nodes downstream in the nodal basin, creating potential challenges in determining the true
Sentinel Node using a gamma detection probe. Because of the rather slow site clearance and the tendency to
pass through the Sentinel Node, the timing of the Sulphur Colloid injection must occur within a relatively
narrow timeframe (measured in hours).


Then we have Neoprobe’s new Lymphoseek, which is specifically designed to bind to lymphatic tissue,
ensuring uptake in the Sentinel Node while NOT passing further downstream to non-Sentinel Nodes. It’s a
single injection, ready to use and ph-balanced to minimize injection pain. Lymphoseek clears the injection site
within 15 minutes, and binds to the Sentinel Node for up to 24 hours. This site clearance is 8X faster than
filtered Sulphur Colloid (ref: 3.bp.blogspot.com/_DRy...). This expanded surgical window of 15 minutes to 24
hours provides a surgical scheduling advantage.


So yeah… to those who’ve studied it, it’s obvious that SLNB not only can be improved, it’s long overdue.

Martin Shkreli


It is hard to trust any company, unless it earns your trust. This one has earned the trust of its shareholder over
years by playing it straight, being conservative and doing it right. The company teetered on the edge of
bankruptcy, fought its way back and has excelled in recent years. It is a comeback story you cannot

companies do. But their reputation as a slow, steady achiever is well deserved.


You’ve been short NEOP less than a month. You simply don’t know the company like those who’ve followed it
for years, and your opinion is obviously jaded by previous experiences.

Author’s reply »  Two injections that work versus one that is uncertain is an easy choice for physicians. Stick
with the two.


Approvals don't matter to doctors. Ask them! Check out Flagyl for c. difficile. It works best and it's cheapest.
Doctors use it first-line with no approval. The FDA recognizes this when they help companies design c.
difficile trials!


The rest of your stuff is Neoprobe corporate propaganda. In the real world, physicians are fine with what
they're doing for SLNM.

"I'm not sure I believe them!" - Martin Shkreli


So the bottom line is that you believe Neoprobe's management lied to the investing public about the FDA's
guidance on the design of their pivotal, Phase III trials. Then they raised the money and executed two
separate multi-year, multi-million trials knowing that the FDA would ultimately deny the NDA approval?

Marty...for every medical advance there was an existing therapy that "physicians were fine with doing", until

I clearly spelled out the many advantages that Lymphoseek should bring to SLNB. If your position is that
Lymphoseek won't get approved or won't be adopted because physicians don't like change, I'm afraid your're
not paying attention to the medical industry at all.

In lupus, it's the opposite. It would be wrong to say "doctors have been fine" with steroids and off-label
Cellcept, but let's just say they were. The marginal impact of a new drug would be very useful, even if just an
"okay" drug. Hence Benlysta approval.


This is a situation where any improvement is bound to be marginal. If you're interested in cancer diagnostics
there are plenty of interesting plays out there. EXAS?

There is plenty of drawbacks to VBD + SC


One more time - Lymphoseek advantages


1) Easy to use, no prep (like SC) 
2) A single injection (ph-balanced, less painful) 
3) No dual approach (gamma wand + hunting stained nodes) 
4) Faster injection site clearance (as fast as 15 min) 
5) Expanded surgical window post injection (15 min to 24 hrs) 
6) No downstream pass through of the compound to non-SN's


And I didn't even get into the clinical advantages like superiority, higher accuracy and lower False Negative
rate...

No, they don't. What they said very clearly is that Neoprobe's clinical tests were very impressive and a good
start (per Dr. Sabel) but they would like to see additional studies conducted to help them translate how this
will impact clinical use.


What you've claimed is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.


Your claim is that Lymphoseek won't be APPROVED by the FDA because it wasn't tested against VBD + SC.


That's not at all what the discussant, or any other physicians, have said that I have heard or read in print.

Author’s reply »  There's a difference between being honest and being literal. You can be dishonest (and you
are) by taking contextually understood elements and applying a literal standard to them. It's both unbecoming
and silly. We all know the odds are stacked against Neoprobe. I suspect it's about a 5% probability of
approval with the current data. I'm willing to give 10-to-1 odds if you're interested in being personally
accountable.

Oh, I'm honest and literal, and I've pointed out enough of your deceptive posts today that you cannot claim

Of course the odds are always stacked against small biotechs, that's why smart investors delve into every

Is the ASCO discussant happy with your posting of his slides and comments, or has he requested that you
remove same? And this informal poll, what were these colleagues of Sabel at Merck? Who were they who
polled them?


Too funny, on one hand you accept rumor, informal polls, and snip others material and post on your newly
refreshed website (enjoying all the attention aren't we now) and on the other hand you decry the fact that
NEOP has conducted the exact study per the FDA's sugessted protocol. I think there's some unresolved
issues swirling around you that you might want to attend to. Honesty, integrity, living within your means, try it.


In Robert Browning's Andrea Del Sarto there's a line that reads "“Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his
grasp, or what's a heaven for?” While it's good to reach for the top, how one finally gets to the top matters as
much as if they get there.

You say: 
"RIGS is a neat idea but it fails to exploit tumor biology properly"


Let us be serious here. Rigs has already completed phase 3 trials and all results were fully acceptable to FDA. The
only reason Rigs did not get approved from that phase 3 trial was that FDA wanted long term survival data and
Neoprobe at that time did not have the money to complete that study. Neoprobe was stupid not to keep following the
patients but a company which is likely to be bankrupt in a year can be excused if it does not have a five or ten year
time horizon. In any case that data was collected by outside investigators and is so good that EMEA has told
Neoprobe that they will consider sale of Rigs even while the proposed phase 3 study is going on. So when you claim
all these terrible things about Rigs you are claiming that FDA, EMEA and the huge physician community do not
understand anything and a short is the most knowledgeable of all. Come on, do you think your readers are a bunch of
idiots who do not do any due diligence themselves.

Just consider the large number of patients who were treated with RIGS who were still alive compared to those who
didn't get RIGS. That figure alone would be enough for me to demand it in my treatment.

The above comment is central to the validity of Rigs. A simple look at the plot


lh6.googleusercontent....


shows that Rigs is able to improve patient survival by multiple years. Now-a-days drugs that improve survival
by months are able to command revenue in billions. Rigs can do far better and addresses a large patient
population. EMEA is not a bunch of fools who have already accepted prior Rigs results and told the company
that they will consider sale of drug while the phase 3 study is ongoing. This is not a small decison by EMEA.
The entire current market cap of Neoprobe can be justified by just that decision.

Senators ask FDA to reform citizen petition process to avoid abuses 
By Julian Pecquet - 05/25/11 10:34 AM ET


Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are urging the Food and Drug
Administration to increase transparency in its citizen petition process in the wake of alleged abuses by the drugmaker
Sanofi.


The process allows individuals and health experts to raise concerns about the safety of medicines regulated by the
FDA. But a new congressional investigation alleges that Sanofi paid more than $5 million to two medical groups and a

researcher who unsuccessfully used the process to try to delay or prevent approval of generic versions of the
blockbuster blood-clot treatment Lovenox.


"Generic drugs help keep health care costs down and we absolutely cannot let powerful drug companies keep those
life-saving drugs out of reach," Baucus said in a statement. "This report uncovers evidence that paying off doctors to
lobby the FDA against generics was a drug company strategy — and that's wholly unacceptable. The FDA needs to
work closely with doctors, so we must ensure that doctors' sole motivation is the well-being of their patients."


Sanofi said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, which uncovered the payments last year, that the citizen
petitions brought "legitimate and important patient safety facts and considerations to the attention of FDA."


In a letter to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, Baucus and Grassley suggest the agency require that petitioners
disclose their financial relationships with entities affected by FDA's decisions. The letter also requests that Hamburg
explain "what steps FDA (has) taken to ensure the integrity and transparency of the citizen petition process."


"If the FDA isn’t asking for disclosure of financial relationships, it's operating from an uninformed standpoint,"
Grassley said. "The FDA has a responsibility to conduct due diligence in this area in order to make sure its reviews
have credibility. Disclosure here and elsewhere with drug company payments helps to establish accountability when
gathering input from experts."

Hey Martin,


Since you don't have a M.D. next you your name, I think the people at this conference have a bit more knowledge
regading this topic of Lymphoseek's validity. Don't choke too much on the information in this press release:


Press Release Source: Neoprobe Corporation On Thursday June 9, 2011, 8:30 am  
DUBLIN, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Neoprobe Corporation (NYSE Amex: NEOP), a diversified developer of
innovative oncology surgical and diagnostic products, today announced that full results from the NEO3-05 study,
demonstrating Lymphoseek® (99mTc-tilmanocept) met all primary and secondary endpoints in intraoperative
lymphatic mapping (ILM) procedures. These results were featured yesterday at the Society for Nuclear Medicine
(SNM) Annual Meeting in San Antonio. Recognition of these results by SNM follows closely the presentation and
discussion at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting in Chicago on June 6.


The primary endpoint of the NEO3-05 study was the comparison (the Concordance Rate, or the rate of agreement) of
Lymphoseek versus vital blue dye (VBD). As is typical of regulatory comparator-based trials, which routinely compare
a novel agent to an on-label agent approved in the indication being studied, Lymphoseek was tested against the only
on-label agent approved in the U.S. for lymphatic mapping, vital blue dye. The FDA approved agents are used as the
appropriate comparator for registration studies because they are supported by evidence from adequate and well
controlled clinical trials to establish and demonstrate their expected performance. VBD meets this standard; no other
compound currently does. Accordingly, and in consultation with the FDA, the Lymphoseek registration studies were
designed to compare Lymphoseek performance to the required, on-label, approved agent, vital blue dye, in order to
position Lymphoseek for FDA approval.


“The NEO3-05 data presented here at SNM reinforce findings of other clinical studies that suggest Lymphoseek
provides significantly higher specificity and sensitivity, and a lower failed detection rate, than vital blue dye,” said Dr.
Vernon Sondak of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida.


Following the presentation of the Lymphoseek study data at the Society of Nuclear Medicine meeting, Dr. Robert
Carretta, past president of the SNM and former Vice President, Medical Affairs at Mallickrodt Medical, the imaging
pharmaceuticals division of Covidien, commented, “Having dealt with the FDA approval process for

comparative studies. It is clear that only products specifically approved for the indication under investigation may be
included as the appropriate comparator for purposes of registration with the FDA.”


Also following the presentation, George Mills, M.D., former Director, Division of Medical Imaging and
Radiopharmaceutical Drug Products at FDA and a Neoprobe consultant, also commented, “The design of both of
Neoprobe’s Phase 3 clinical trials for Lymphoseek, NEO3-05 and NEO3-09, have met the safety and efficacy
expectations as planned with FDA. Neoprobe has conducted the trials in accordance with the parameters discussed
and agreed with FDA. Direct comparison of Lymphoseek to vital blue dye – the only FDA-approved product for ILM
procedures – is the appropriate comparator to demonstrate the clinical value of Lymphoseek.”


NEO3-05 Primary Endpoint Met


The primary endpoint of the NEO3-05 study was the comparison (the Concordance Rate, or the rate of agreement) of
Lymphoseek versus vital blue dye, where vital blue dye is considered by FDA as the only approved, on-label agent for
lymphatic mapping, thus making it the appropriate requisite “Truth Standard” comparator for registration purposes.
The Concordance Rate was analyzed on both a per-node and per-patient basis.


In NEO3-05, study subjects yielded a total of 215 lymph nodes stained with vital blue dye. Of these blue-stained
nodes, Lymphoseek detected 210, for a Concordance Rate of 97.67%, which was a highly statistically significant
finding (p<0.0001).


On a per-patient basis, the NEO3-05 study yielded a total of 136 patients with lymph nodes stained with vital blue dye.
Of these patients, Lymphoseek detected the same blue-stained nodes in all 131 patients, for a Concordance Rate of
96.32%, a highly statistically significant finding (p<0.0001).


“The results presented yesterday reinforce prior clinical evidence indicating that Lymphoseek is an encouraging
modality for surgical oncologists to intraoperatively identify and diagnose potentially cancerous lymph nodes in
neoplastic disease versus the only currently approved agent, vital blue dye,” said Dr. Fred Cope, Neoprobe’s Senior
Vice President, Pharmaceutical Research and Clinical Development.

ddbuyerhere@yahoo.com
Martin, while you’re busy doing NEOP due diligence allow me to move along to other points.


In your original SeekingAlpha article (June 1) you attempted to determine the overall market potential of Lymphoseek.
As a starting point you stated that “The AWP of sulfur colloid is $53.20[3]”. Your reference [3] was the Noridian’s 2005
Wholesale Prices for Code A9520. However, Noridien’s 2005 price for that code was $71.25 not $53.20 as you
quoted. Here is the price list for your reference (please refer to it this time).


www.google.com/url?sa=...


Obviously if your basic, original assumption was incorrect any subsequent calculations are immediately flawed. Then
you compounded your miscalculation by using 2005 prices instead of 2011 prices. However, addressing only 2005
Wholesale prices for Sulphur Colloid was but a few of the many mistakes you made.


Obviously you aren’t aware of the details of Neoprobe’s agreement with Lymphoseek’s distributor, Cardinal Health.
Had you done so you would be aware that it’s a revenue sharing agreement that grants Neoprobe 50-53% of the
RETAIL price Cardinal Health receives from the end users. Thus, all of your “wholesale-based” calculations were
erroneous.


Then, despite your admission that Lymphoseek has been proven clinically superior to Blue Dye, you did not
contemplate or include any Lymphoseek revenues for its substitution of Isosulfan Blue. However, I did it for you.
Isosulfan Blue comes in packs of six individual dose bottle of 5ml each, for a cost of ~$6,500 per six-pack. Dosage
recommendations of 3ml per patient yields up to 10 treatments per pack, or a COST TO THE HOSPITAL of
approximately $650 per patient for Blue Dye.


www.medexsupply.com/la...


Obviously the facilities will mark the price up from the cost of $650 per patient to be profitable. But then again perhaps
with large bulk buying they will be able to get quantity discounts, which could wash against the profitability markup.
However, a known retail COST of $650 per patient is certainly a good starting point to debate how much Lymphoseek
will garner, considering that Lymphoseek was proven superior to VBD in the recently concluded trial. Don’t you
agree?


At this point we could also go into the price of Sulphur Colloid + Blue Dye COMBINED (which Lymphoseek will likely
replace), PLUS the rest of the world market potential that you intentionally ignored, but I think your so called “analysis”
has been sufficiently shredded.

You state "Blue dye will never go away". By this do you mean that, if Lymphoseek is approved, it will be used
with Blue Dye instead of on its own? I do not understand your reasoning on this at all so please explain in
detail. Please explain why Blue Dye would never go away (and please don't say because Lymphoseek will
never be approved - you don't know that).


This is your first credible attempt at refuting DDBuyers calculations so I commend you on that but until you

Okay, now your calculations make more sense to me and also your statement on why "Blue Dye will never go
away". I have never heard this arguement before and I have a hard time understanding it since it seems the
point of NEOP strategy is to replace Blue Dye. Can you help me understand why you believe that, if
approved, why Lyphoseek would be used in combination with Blue Dye rather than on its own? Wouldn't the
test results at least suggest that Lymphoseek alone is as good as (if not better) to the combination Blue Dye
and Sulfer Colloid? I realize that the testing procedure is at the heart of your arguement and that no definitive
conclusions can be drawn until such a test is conducted. Are you saying that, in real world practice,
Lymphoseek would have to be used in combination with Blue Dye until such a study is conducted? That is
credible (But, with respect, I would probably come to some different conclusions than you)

"If Lymphoseek were approved, Lymphoseek users would use it in combination with Blue Dye" - Martin
Shkreli


Why would a physician using Lymphoseek also use an inferior agent such as Blue Dye, considering these
results from the Phase III Superiority trial.


Nodes detected - Lymphoseek = 378 
Nodes detected - Blue Dye = 229


Lymphoseek Concordance Rate w/Blue Dye = 100% 
Blue Dye Concordance Rate w/Lymphoseek = 68.63%

Author’s reply »  Remember sulfur colloid + blue dye is near perfect. So Lymphoseek alone wouldn't replace
it unless it was perfect, too. Since the two have never been compared (combination versus Lymphoseek), we
just don't know. Doctors don't take things by chance! They prefer the drug with proof.


09 Jun 2011, 05:46 PM


ggl26
Understood, but that does not address my question. My question is why would Lymphoseek be used in
combination with Blue Dye? Not whether Doctors would choose Lymphoseek or a combination of Blue Dye
and Sulfer Colloid. That is a valid point that will probably need to be addressed at some point. No need to mix
up threads of debate.


I still am not clear on what benefit they would have in combination. If Lymphoseek can be used without Blue
Dye (and DD Buyers calculations are remotely correct), then your point on cost is moot. Without a credible
response you should concede this point because it hurts your overall arguement.

reasoning is having two somewhat diagnostic assays always (even when one is better than another) is more

examples of this are "triple" and "quad" diagnostics for Down Syndrome screening. This is the case with
diagnostics in general. The only time you can safely replace is when you have large sensitivity/specificity.

Those who use SC + VBD do so because they recognize the shortcomings of each if used separately.
Lymphoseek recently proved superior to VBD and, contrary to the myths, it has also been compared to
Sulphur Colloid in Phase I clinical trials.

Lymphoseek would likely never be used in conjunction with Blue Dye, given the results of the recent
superiority trial.


The theory of non-linear addition assumes the addition of an agent that contributes sensitivity. Since Blue Dye
proved inferior to Lymphoseek there is no logical reason to add Blue Dye to the mix.

Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid


The following adverse reactions have been reported associated with the use of Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur
Colloid Injection: cardiopulmonary arrest, seizures, anaphylactic shock, hypotension, dyspnea, abdominal
pain, fever, chills, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, perspiration, redness, urticaria, numbness, dizziness and
burning at the injection site.


Several deaths and cases of lung and soft tissue uptake other than RES have been reported in association
with the use of Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid Injection"


and


"Elimination: 
Renal, about 3% of the administered activity eliminated within 48 hours after intravenous administration. {04}


 
Precautions to Consider


Carcinogenicity/Mutage...


Long-term animal studies to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid
have not been performed. {22}


Pregnancy/Reproduction


Pregnancy— 
Tc 99m (as free pertechnetate) crosses the placenta. However, studies with technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid
have not been done in humans.


The possibility of pregnancy should be assessed in women of child-bearing potential. Clinical situations exist
where the benefit to the patient and fetus, based on information derived from radiopharmaceutical use,
outweighs the risks from fetal exposure to radiation. In these situations, the physician should use discretion
and reduce the radiopharmaceutical dose to the lowest possible amount. {12}


Studies have not been done in animals. {08} {14}


FDA Pregnancy Category C. {08} {22}


Breast-feeding


Although it is not known whether technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid is distributed into breast milk, it is known
that Tc 99m as free pertechnetate is distributed into breast milk. Based on the assumption that the Tc 99m in
breast milk is in the form of pertechnetate and based on the effective half-life of the radionuclide in breast
milk, the daily volume of milk, a dose factor relating the radionuclide to its critical organ (thyroid) in the nursing
infant, and the maximum permissible dose to that organ, a guideline has been proposed. According to this
guideline, it has been calculated that nursing can be safely resumed when the concentration in breast milk
reaches 30.3 × 10 -4 megabecquerels (8.2 × 10 -2 microcuries) per mL. This level of activity is probably
reached, in the majority of patients, within 12 to 24 hours after administration of technetium Tc 99m–labeled
radiopharmaceuticals. {11} {14} {24}"

That's right folks - there have been NO studies examining the long term health effects of sulfur colloid, no
studies on it's effect on pregnancies or breast feeding, no nothing. I cannot believe this stuff is actually FDA
approved - and I bet you 50 quatloos that if it came up for FDA approval NOW it would be sent home packing.

(RIGS) "The prior studies look like post-hoc data mining to me." - Martin Shkreli


Of course it is. Neoprobe has been very transparent about the fact that it's post-surgical follow up of patients who
participated in the RIGS Phase III trials. But what an intriguing picture it paints of survival benefit:


lh6.googleusercontent....


RIGScan CR met all clinical endpoints in the full battery of FDA clinical trials and Neoprobe submitted the BLA to the
FDA.


The FDA then requested additional data addressing patient survival benefit and/or how it affected patient treatment
and outcome. Neoprobe did not have the data at that time, and it took the passage of years before RIGS’ survival
benefit became apparent.


Neoprobe is now in the process of reactivating RIGScan CR, recently commencing manufacturing and validation of
the compound, in preparation to commence one final, confirmatory trial to properly validate patient treatment benefit.

"Blue dye will never go away, so factoring the cost of that in any calculation is a waste of time." - Martin Shkreli


Of course Blue Dye will never go away. There will always be other uses for it.


However, it will be replaced in SLN and SLNB indications by the clinically proven, superior technology, Lymphoseek.
That's the nature of medical advances.


As you've already indicated, the price of a competing product is a factor in establishing a price of a new product. I've
already proven to you that Blue Dye has a COST of ~$650 per patient, so it is only reasonable to assume that the
replacement compound (Lymphoseek) will be priced accordingly.


Considering Lymphoseek's proven superiority in a head to head comparison it's not unreasonable to assume
Lymphoseek will command a premium over the older, inferior compound.

After the recent clinical studies documenting Blue Dye's inferiority to Lymphoseek Blue Dye will find itself
used only at non-nuc facilities. All nuc equipped facilities will go with the superior agent.


There's are good reasons why Methylene Blue isn't the standard agent in the U.S.

“There were 22 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in NEO03-09 which were not well-disclosed by the company.” –
Martin Shkreli


To the contrary, they were explicitly described in detail at ASCO detailing each and every event, along with the
investigators conclusions. The investigators concluded that the adverse events were either minor in nature (rashes,
nausea, etc.) or, for the more significant events, consistent with historically documented side effects of Isosulfan Blue,
including anaphylaxis.


The investigators are well aware of the history of Isosulfan Blue, and are in a much better position than a hedge fund
manager to determine cause and effect of an adverse event during a clinical trial.


You were not involved, Martin. The investigators were, and they were in the position to assess the correlation
between the earlier injection of Lymphoseek and the later injection of Isosulfan Blue, and then make the proper
decision regarding the association of an adverse event with each respective agent.


You may wish to note that the FDA requires a warning label on Isosulfan Blue noting the history of an overall
incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in approximately 2% of patients including life- threatening anaphylactic
reactions, respiratory distress, shock, angioedema, urticaria, and pruritus. In laboratory Tests Lymphazurin (isosulfan
blue) 1% interferes with measurements of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry and of methemoglobin by gas
analyzer4. Additionally, Isosulfan Blue can result in transient or long-term (tattooing) blue coloration.


The adoption of Lymphoseek will alleviate, and in all likelihood eliminate, this problem incurred by the use of VBD.


You see, Lymphoseek has been tested on 508 patients to date in Phase 1, 2 and 3 FDA clinical trials over a period of
10+ years (starting in 2001). This is in addition to a portion of the estimated 196 additional patients currently
undergoing the Head & Neck Sentinel Trial who have completed their surgeries, also with no significant adverse
events to date.


During all of the Lymphoseek trials and subsequent follow ups during this 10+ year period, not one (yes ZERO)
significant adverse event has ever been attributed to Lymphoseek. This is an enviable, and practically unheard of,
safety record for a new compound.


The same cannot be said for Isosulfan Blue, or even Sulphur Colloid for that matter.

Again, you're uninformed Martin. The company has stated numerous times on conference calls that Lymphoseek is

Capital raised through the sale of their Gamma Device product line will be used to expand their drug pipeline, through

"Lymphoseek is simply further out on the receiver-operator characteristic curve than blue dye." - Martin Shkreli


As it should be, since the ROC is a measurement of the true positive rate vs. false positive rate.


Considering that Lymphoseek demonstrated a False Negative Rate of 0% (the most important measurement in SLNB,
btw), it should and WAS way out there on the ROC, compared to VBD.


Translation = Lymphoseek was more accurate at locating the true sentinel node while missing none.

the ROC curve and that is what Lymphoseek is.


Lymphoseek is not more accurate, it just takes 50-80% more nodes.

Instead let's discuss the CP itself. As a basis for your complaint, you cited:


"It is imperative that new mapping agents go through the same vigorous investigation the medical community has
conducted…" - CP


Can you provide us with the FDA requirement, or any other standard for that matter, that mandates a new agent must
go through studies as "conducted by the medical community"?

Also, on the CP you stated:


"The combination of technetium-99 sulfur colloid and blue dye is the standard of care relied on for almost two
decades."


First and foremost, the current Standard of Care is both debatable and subjective. Some facilities use only
variations of VBD (Isosulfan, Methylene, etc.). Others use colloid-based products exclusively. The rest use
both in combination, because each agent (VBD and colloids) demonstrate numerous shortcomings.


Regardless, the phrase Standard of Care is NOT interchangeable between the FDA and the medical
community. While some portion of the medical community considers a combination VBD + SC as their
Standard of Care, the FDA only recognizes VBD as the Standard.


The FDA DOES NOT designate VBD + Sulphur Colloid as the Standard of Care. If that were the case the
FDA would have required the amendment of the labeling of VBD to include that it be used in only conjunction
with Sulphur Colloid for SLN. They have not.


In the eyes of the FDA Blue Dye is THE STANDARD agent for SLNB.

This is not true. It's colloid+BD. Nearly always (>90% of the time). That is a standard of care. I footnoted more
than 10 places where the appropriate sources, including Neoprobe-related authors, have called it the
standard of care.

There is no FDA requirement that a new agent must go through studies comparing the agent to the best

"With respect to the comparator arm, the FDA has never weighed in publicly. Neoprobe uses careful language and I
think anyone with experience can tell you that the FDA is often difficult to interpret." - Martin Shkreli


The FDA doesn't "weigh in publicly" on their discussions with companies about clinical trial designs. That's normal
and very typical of the agency. Neoprobe was treated no differently.


Of course Neoprobe uses careful language. They're a publicly traded company, responsible to others for their actions
and representations. We should expect nothing less.


With regard to the "FDA being difficult to interpret", you are correct. That can be true. Neoprobe learned that difficult
lesson in 1996-97 with the RIGS BLA.


That's also why Neoprobe maintained an ongoing dialogue throughout the clinical process with Lymphoseek,
conducting numerous on site post-clinical and pre-NDA meetings with the FDA, soliciting FDA guidance, verifying
their clinical pathway, and then documenting every single step.

DDBuyer, it has been brought up that NEOP should have gotten an SPA for the NDA to avoid any criticism
that the trial was flawed. Do you know why they didn't? Figured you might know some history behind that.
Also, what about an SPA for RIGS?


Not that I think the trial was flawed but just seems like an SPA would have been a no-brainer here with so
much on the line for NEOP. Hard to understand why any small Biotech company would not get one (I
understand that it does not ensure approval) with so much on the line. Any comment on why a small Biotech
would not get an SPA? (Not trying to move the conversation away from your debate with Martin but figured it
was relevant).


09 Jun 2011, 03:36 PM


ddbuyerhere@yahoo.com
ggl, with regard to RIGS, according to management's latest comments they still intend to pursue an SPA for
the final, confirmatory RIGS trial. So I believe that's still their intent.


With regard to Lymphoseek their stance at the time was that they had maintained such a high level of
dialogue with FDA during their post-Phase II meetings and going forward that they didn't believe an SPA was
necessary.

Despite the company's full disclosures and transparency leading up to and during the Phase III trials there
has never been any dispute or controversy that I'm aware of regarding the Phase III trial design, until it was
raised by Martin Shkreli and MSMB Capital, after going short NEOP.


In retrospect it would certainly be helpful to have an SPA to deflect the issue raised by the shorts. But
management continues to display high confidence that the FDA guidance they received was correct, and the
trial they designed used the proper comparator.

Thank you. It has been brought up that NEOP disclosed RIGS SPA discussions with FDA in 2010 10Qs but is
strangely silent on the matter 2011 forward and that implies that things did not go well regarding an SPA for
RIGS. That is why I asked.


I agree that in retrospect an SPA for Lymphoseek would have helped here. We'll find out what the FDA truly
thinks soon enough. I think if I was in small Biotech mgmt, I would err on the side of getting an SPA unless the
cost was just too high to justify. Obviously, many do not (for whatever reason) and NEOP felt good about it
per their discussions with FDA. Thanks.

ggl,  
RE: RIGS, The original position of management was that they would use an SPA for the final, confirmatory
RIGS trial planned for 2012.


Since then, they've been researching a new trial design that could potentially shift from a survival-based
design to a diagnostic-based design. The new design has a much shorter timeline, as the top line data would
be available the same day as surgery. Patient survival would still be monitored long term, but it would not be a
requirement for FDA approval under this proposed newer design.


Management met with FDA once earlier this year to discuss this new trial, and other meetings are planned for
later this year to explore it further. Once they've nailed down the new trial I'm sure we'll get an update on their
intentions regarding an SPA for RIGS.

RE: Lymphoseek. Because management was so proactive and maintained an aggressive dialogue with FDA
starting with their post-Phase II trials, through Phase III design and into numerous pre-NDA meetings, they
never felt the need to utilize an SPA for Lymphoseek.


In retrospect it would be great to have an SPA to deflect this last minute criticism from Martin Shkreli. But,
despite complete transparency and disclosure through the entire Lymphoseek trial design phase and the
Phase III trials, nobody (not ONE person) has ever challenged or even questioned the validity of the designs
recommended to Neoprobe during their meetings with FDA personnel.

Point taken, and one which is planned to be addressed. Neoprobe plans to conduct additional post-marketing

I'm a radiologist and physician that does lymphoscintigraphy on a regular basis. DDbuyer and others, the data is
woefully inadequate to support replacement of sulfur colloid and dye any time soon. The other proposed benefits of
Lymphoseek like a faster diffusion time and less pain/side effects (I'd love to hear from other radiolgoists/nuc meds
who think sulfur colloid has side effects) are almost irrelevant.


And to respond to some posts I made on another NEOP article, yes we get reimbursed for colloid.


I don't know anything about RIGS. But the bottom line is Lymphoseek is at best a second line agent in case we don't
localize a node. That happens rarely.

There needs to be the following: 
1) Studies showing Lymphoseek localizes more sentinel nodes 
2) Those studies have to show a significant number of more nodes, not just one more node or something.
Otherwise the Number Needed to Treat is prohibitively high. Medicine is tradeoffs and economics is a
consideration. 
3) If you show more nodes are localized, you have to be able to show that finding those nodes made a
difference. You may find that you're finding more nodes with micrometastases, but would that spread have led
to a difference in mortality? Look at the recent Memorial Sloan Kettering study in JAMA this year. T1 T2
tumors found no difference if they treated the positive sentinel nodes or not. Landmark study.


If we don't find the sentinel nodes, which as I stated happens very rarely, oftentimes the surgeon will just
remove the nodes in the axilla where sentinel nodes are most often found. sometimes the area is included in
the radiation field as well.


given all that, and the fact our success in finding nodes with colloid and dye is over 95% (higher in my
experience), what exactly is Lymphoseek going to improve on? It would take years of very large studies to
show a true benefit that hostpials and physicians would feel comfortable replacing colloid and dye over. You
just don't get things as reliable and accurate as colloid +dye in medicine that often. I mean, it's over 95%
probably.

For example, the Discussant at ASCO, Dr. Sabel, specifically stated during his presentation, “… it had
equivalent results when injected on the day of surgery or the day preceding surgery. This could be a
significant advantage, as we have to inject the patients the day of its quite often easier for patients and easier
for us if we can inject them the day before rather than that day”.

I am a nuclear medicine technologist and I perform the imaging for 2-3 lymphoscintigraphy studies a week. It
has been my experience that sulfur colloid leaves much to be desired. I'll run down a list of complaints that I
personally have with the tracer:


1.) Patients must be injected on the same day in which the surgery is scheduled, approximately 1-2 hours
beforehand. This can be quite troublesome as any delays in imaging can run into the surgery time. From what
I understand, Lymphseek may be injected the day before surgery, making the whole process much easier.


2.) Injection pain, particularly for breast cancer patients, can be quite severe. I have read that lymphoseek
injections involve less pain for patients.


3.) Hot injection sites. Often times the sentinal node can be located in close proximity to the lesion. This can
present a challenge to the technologist as a hot injection site will steal counts from the hot node(s). When this
occurs, we often have to wait an hour or so to get good images. If you read problem #1, you can see why this
might be an issue. Also if the majority of the injection isn't moving from the injection site, then the sentinal
node won't be as bright and obvious as it could be. Thus, it can be dificult to image effectively.


4.) If too much time passes between surgery and injection time, counts from the node(s) will be too low to
detect with a gamma probe. This can be very frustrating, a tracer that will bind to nodes for a longer period of
time would be quite useful.


I've never seen a patient have a reaction to sulfur colloid injections, but there is definitly room for
improvement. I personally believe Lymphoseek will make my life much easier.

Lymphoseek (especially at a 10x the current cost projected price!)

I haven't had the same problems you have.


-I don't know why you're complaining as a technologist over imaging time and surgery scheduling. I've now
been in 3 hospitals and things run pretty seamlessly when doing lymphoscintigraphy. What are you talking
about with injecting Lymphoseek the day before? That's absurd and would necessitate two trips to the
hospital. In fact, Neoprobe is promoting the opposite, with SHORTER injection to imaging.


- How are your radiologists injecting this? Why this pain issue keeps coming up is beyond me. It's ridiculous.
In a couple of hours this patient will be HAVING SURGERY. As in, under anesthesia and with post op pain
control. We use some topical anesthesia. I've never heard of a patient complaining of the "severe" pain you're
talking about.


-again, I've rarely if ever had a problem with stealing counts or with counts being too low. You also don't
mention the obvious solution, which is to block the injection site. How much are you injecting? For you to
have this much trouble with lymphoscintigraphy, your radiologists need to look over the protocols.


09 Jun 2011, 07:12 PM


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for your comments, which are very valuable as your in nuclear medicine. Let me
remind you however that most patients don't get the full lymphoscintigraphy. Not sure if that changes your
points?


1) I do think that if proven in a head-to-head study, Lymphoseek would be a bit easier than sulfur colloid.
However do you think it would be worth 10x the price? Also this doesn't consider the notion that Lymphoseek
is very highly unlikely to receive approval.


2) Again I think the injection site pain has to be proven in a trial.


3) I'm not sure how Lymphoseek would change things with respect to hot nodes bleeding over.


4) This is a similar and related benefit to #1 which I happily acknowledge.


Almost all of the physicians I've spoken to have never seen a sulfur colloid reaction and I do think there are
small benefits, if they're proven, to Lymphoseek. I think the lack of a good trial is overwhelmingly concerning
in light of these benefits, as well as the proposed cost of treatment ($450 versus $75 for sulfur colloid),
wouldn't make it worth it.


09 Jun 2011, 07:12 PM


rads2005
why are you taking all your information from one side of the story? Sabel presented Neoprobe's data. That's
not objective. Are you kidding me with this. The idea that we're somehow going to be injecting patients the
day before surgery and calling it an advantage for the patient to come in twice is absurd. That's grasping at
straws.

who's this "we" he's talking about. He's not a radiologist. He's not going to be the one injecting. Give me a
break.


please don't tell me you're the same person who wrote up that post on investor village saying something like
"yes folks... it misses 1 out of 4 nodes."

- Do you think it would be worth 10x the price?


No I don't believe it would. However, the cost of Lymphoseek has not been finalized. Nor has reimbursement
for that matter. A more expensive drug with a higher reimbursement rate can be more cost effective than a
cheaper drug with lower or no reimbursement. Also if Lymphoseek is used without using blue dye, money can
be saved there. I'd say we just don't know enough information at this point to say which is the most cost
effective method.


- Also this doesn't consider the notion that Lymphoseek is very highly unlikely to receive approval.


That is your opinion, not mine.


- I think the injection site pain has to be proven in a trial.


I believe decreased injection site pain has been well documented by the participants in the Phase II and
Phase III studies.


- I'm not sure how Lymphoseek would change things with respect to hot nodes bleeding over.


Faster injection site clearence = no gigantic, bright circle in our images.

Your opinion is very much in line with the experiences that I've read and heard, and highlights the real world
issues that Lymphoseek will help to address.


Those who believe change won't occur because something is being done a certain way should open their
eyes and do some objective research with professionals like yourself.

I'm convinced that Lymphoseek will become the standard in time, based on all of the clinically proven
advantages and excellent safety profile it has demonstrated to date. Thanks for sharing.

-I don't know why you're complaining as a technologist over imaging time and surgery scheduling.


Um because these things directly effect me, the doctors I work for, and my patients. Why would I NOT be
complaining about these things? Clearly there is room for improvement, and from what I've seen, Lymphseek
addresses these concerns.


- What are you talking about with injecting Lymphoseek the day before? That's absurd and would necessitate
two trips to the hospital. In fact, Neoprobe is promoting the opposite, with SHORTER injection to imaging.


Making two trips to the hospital may be preferred if it will ensure things run more smoothly. Neoprobe is not
promoting the opposite. They are promoting a higher degree of flexibility. Different facilities can elect to do
things as they prefer. They may inject the day before, or 6 hours before, or 2, or 1, or 15 minutes.


- Why this pain issue keeps coming up is beyond me. It's ridiculous. In a couple of hours this patient will be
HAVING SURGERY.


- Because they are being injected in a very sensitive part of their body. You take 4-6 injections around your
areola and see how it feels. Topical anesthesia certainly helps, but if the injection itself is less painful, I put
that down as a benefit.


- How much are you injecting?


100uCi in 0.1mL per injection. Four injections made around the areola for breast cancer and around the
lesion for melanoma.


- You also don't mention the obvious solution, which is to block the injection site.


Blocking the injection site is a helpful technique. As a radiologist, I don't image you do the imaging yourself so
I can't expect you to understand the challenges the technologist may face. Sometimes even shielding the
injection site isn't enough. Depending on where the sentinal node is located and how bright the injection site
is, sometimes only time will allow the nodes to be adequately visualized. And again this can cause imaging to
run into surgery times.

Like I said, as a technologist these things do not directly affect you. You get paid as an employee to do your
job. Don't worry about radiologists.


I suggest you follow the patients after lymphoscintigraphy in one of your days off, and then you'll realize how
far off you are in assuming scheduling surgeries will somehow be more streamlined with Lymphoseek.


I'll repeat what I said before. If pain is an issue for you to where you're trying to change imaging agents from
sulfur colloid, your procedures and/or injections are not being done correctly. Not to mention what I said,
which is that the minor pain they experience from lymphoscintigraphy is 1) easily controlled and 2) irrelevant
given the surgery they're about to undergo.


Around the areola or around the tumor?


again, the benefits you cite, directly out of Neoprobe's PR, are not as important as you're saying. You're citing
minor factors that even if true do not justify the extra expense and will not change standard of care when the
said standard is already so high and accurate.

- Like I said, as a technologist these things do not directly affect you. You get paid as an employee to do your

Excuse me sir, but they DO directly effect me, my patients, and the surgeons that I have to answer to for the
quality and timeliness of my work.


- I suggest you follow the patients after lymphoscintigraphy in one of your days off, and then you'll realize how
far off you are in assuming scheduling surgeries will somehow be more streamlined with Lymphoseek.


I don't need to follow a patient after the procedure. I'm with them in real-time the day of the procedure. I see
first hand how smooth things go.


- If pain is an issue for you to where you're trying to change imaging agents from sulfur colloid...irrelevant
given the surgery they're about to undergo.


How can pain be irrelevant? Have you no empathy? It doesn't matter that the patient will be on pain control
after the surgery, I'm discussing the pain experienced during the injections, well before surgery.


- Around the areola or around the tumor?


For breast cancer patients it is our protocol to inject sub-areolar due to the rich lymphatic network in that area.
It is during these sub-areolar injections that the most pain is experienced. Perhaps if this is not your protocol,
it is why you haven't noticed many patient complaints about pain. However, it is very common practice and
yields the best results.

They're not your patients. You're a tech. You have nothing to answer for and are responsible for nothing.
We're the ones that bear the legal responsibility. You're an employee.


You're employed by surgeons? And exactly how is it different for a technologist in "answering" to a surgeon or
radiologist on "the quality and timeliness" of your work with either Lymphoseek or Tc SC... when those would
obviously be the protocol instituted by said surgeon/radiologist? Are you somehow implying that if the
surgeon orders Tc SC, he'll blame you for scheduling issues, but not with Lymphoseek? Or vice versa? Give
me an example of where a surgeon or radiologist directly holds you responsible.


The degree of pain for lymphoscintigraphy is irrelevant. Right. You're going to reduce the pain during
injections. I'm sure the agent is what's causing the pain during injections and not, say, the NEEDLE in the SC
tissues.


Asking a patient to come in twice is not going to work.


I still fail to see why , your institution, wherever or whatever it is, cannot streamline scheduling for your breast
cancer patients. Ridiculous. And it's simply unimaginable that in a place as incompetent as that, it's going to
be any better with Lymphoseek.


The most important criteria, whether Lymphoseek is any better, and HOW MUCH better, than Tc SC + dye, is
unanswered. And therefore there will be very few, if any, sales for a long, long time.

"Why this pain issue keeps coming up is beyond me. It's ridiculous. In a couple of hours this patient will be
HAVING SURGERY. As in, under anesthesia and with post op pain control."


Typical god complex answer from a *cough* clearly mentally superior person to anyone/everyone else posting
here in this thread.


Don't worry about the couple of hours of pain prior to surgery because they'll be fine with post-op pain
control? Are you sh*tting me?!? Your obvious disregard for THE PATIENT and their pre-op discomfort is
almost unbelievable, but really not so surprising, coming from an "above it all" surgeon. Notice I said "THE
patient", not "YOUR patient", because clearly that's how you think of them - a lump of meat on your operating
table, not as a human being.


Good god, your kind make me sick.....I've had the misfortune of being operated on by someone as dismissive
as you are to their patient's pain levels, so I know WTF I'm talking about here.

Martin Shkreli doesn't have to be right on any of his points of contention with NEOP or AVNR.


All he needs to do is create an atmosphere of confusion and doubt so he can make a profit on his shorts.


I'd say he's certainly 'smart' when it comes to gaming the market and stocks and impeccable in his timing of articles
and concerned citizen filings with FDA.


I wonder if Martin would let us in on how many other short hedge funds he's currently in collaboration with to take
down AVNR and NEOP ? It seems implausible to me that he's doing this just for himself considering the degree of
short interest in our stocks especially AVNR. In any case I suspect his fellow shorts will thank him for his efforts as
they ride his coattails to profits.

The debate on the commercial success of Lymphoseek is a valid area for discussion. Unfortunately, Shkreli lost all
credibility when he extended the discussion to include FDA approval and filed the CP. To date, NO valid grounds have
been provided for rejection and even the most bearish NEOP investors I have discussed Lymphoseek with concede
that approval is all but a done deal. I suspect Shkreli fully understands this and thus the need for the CP that serves
no other purpose than to manipulate the stock price to his advantage. Even the ASCO discussant cited by Shkreli
said NOTHING to indicate that he thought the drug would not or should not be approved. Once again, he was
discussing adoption not approval of the drug. In fact, he validated Neoprobe's claim of superiority over VBD (which
Neoprobe is seeking from the FDA) and pointed out advantages offered by Lymphoseek. Clearly, he stated he would
like to see more...but these are the types of studies that might be necessary for commercial success not approval.

Skreli missed the point when he stated VBD would still be used in conjunction with Lymphoseek. Lymphoseek fully
upstaged VBD. If Lymphoseek is used, there is nothing that can be gained by using VBD as Lymphoseek had a 100%
concordance rate to VBD, but the converse cannot be said.

Mr. Shkreli, while I disagree with your thesis you have been very diligent in responding to reader comments. I ask
then, that you respond to this post. I suggest that your Citizens Petition is void on its face. For someone who claims to
be the manager of a heath care hedge fund I am more than a little surprised at your apparent lack of knowledge. I am
an attorney who has dealt with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. I am quite interested in your response. As I have
been very specific in citing specific code sections, I would appreciate the professional courtesy of a response that is
not mere allegations but is grounded in fact or statute to back up your position. I apologize in advance for the length of
this post - to follow...


10 Jun 2011, 10:18 AM


Roger Newman, Contributor
You submitted your Citizens Petition under section 505(q) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR § (not $)
10.30. 21 CFR § 10.30 is the section allowing for a Citizen Petition. Section 505(q) of the Act, however, is somewhat
more interesting and what I will focus on. Section 505(q) specifically allows for the submission of Citizen Petitions
related to a pending ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. What exactly are those alternatives? An ANDA is defined as an
Abbreviated New Drug Application. The FDA defines an ANDA as follows (taken from the FDA website):  
An Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) contains data which when submitted to FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, Office of Generic Drugs, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a generic drug
product. Once approved, an applicant may manufacture and market the generic drug product to provide a safe,
effective, low cost alternative to the American public. 
A generic drug product is one that is comparable to an innovator drug product in dosage form, strength, route of
administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use. All approved products, both innovator and
generic, are listed in FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). 
Generic drug applications are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical
(animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically
demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner as the innovator drug). One way

https://seekingalpha.com/article/274002-neoprobe-follow-up-on-asco-citizen-petition-and-readers-comments 52/74


scientists demonstrate bioequivalence is to measure the time it takes the generic drug to reach the bloodstream in 24
to 36 healthy, volunteers. This gives them the rate of absorption, or bioavailability, of the generic drug, which they can
then compare to that of the innovator drug. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients
into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug.  
I don’t think that there is any argument to be made that Lymphoseek is a generic so we can quickly dispense that
basis for a Citizens Petition. 
What then is a 505(b)(2) application, the second possible basis for submission of a Citizens Petition? This section
was added to the Act by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman
Amendments). This provision expressly permits the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the
applicant. In other words, the applicant is permitted to rely on studies published in the scientific literature to
demonstrate safety and effectiveness of duplicates of certain post-1962 pioneer drug products. Does this apply to
Lymphoseek? Lymphoseek is a proprietary and novel chemical formulation that had never been studied prior to
Neoprobe’s studies. Neoprobe undertook Phase I, II and III studies with Lymphoseek which, by definition, excludes it
from the category of a 505(b)(2) application. 
Therefore, there is no basis under which a Citizens Petition can be submitted with respect to Lymphoseek under
Section 505(q) of the Act. Understanding that the Citizens Petition submitted by you was not submitted within the
guidelines of the very code section defining under what conditions a Citizens Petition may be filed, what will happen
with this petition? As shown on your website the Petition was accepted by the FDA. This is meaningless. It is nothing
more than an acknowledgement that the document was received and the FDA must send the acceptance of filing for
each such document. 
Let’s turn then to the answer to the question I posed above, what will happen with this petition? In their guidance to
the industry, the FDA stated that section 505 (q) only applies to a petition if an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is
pending at the time the petition is submitted to the FDA. This is stated clearly in section 505 (q)(1)(A) and specifically
references pending applications. You must agree that Neoprobe has not submitted an NDA for Lymphoseek.
Furthermore, that application will not be an ANDA nor a 505(b)(2) as both those sections are not applicable to
Lymphoseek. Even if you had filed at the appropriate time, it was an inappropriate vehicle to air your concerns. 
The Citizens Petition was filed before it was applicable (a pending NDA is required), on a drug that is not seeking
approval under either code section which provides for the submission of a Citizens Petition (a requirement of section
505(q) which created the Citizens Petition), therefore it is invalid on its face. 
You are admittedly short the stock and your Petition did have some shock value dropping the stock yesterday
morning. Someone who manages a health care hedge fund should know better. Your credibility is now clearly
suspect. As we have all seen from the tv law shows, and I have seen in actual courtrooms, once your credibility is
suspect is calls into question everything you have said previously. 
The courtesy of your reply is respectfully requested...

Mr. Shkreli, care to address a well-founded legal argument or has the cat got your tongue?

Many thanks for your input, rknatty. I was doing some reading online yesterday about the apparent (in)validity
of Marty's CP here:


www.fdalawblog.net/fda...


and pretty much came to the same conclusions as you did, but you have put it all together much more
eloquently than I could ever dream of doing. Too bad much of the damage to the common shareholder has
already been done....


I do have a question for you though - are there civil or criminal penalties for signing and submitting such a
blatantly biased and invalid CP for one's personal financial gain, or that of his/her employer? Perjury before
the FDA comes to mind, at a minimum.....let alone what the SEC may have to say about it.....


TIA


P.S. One other thing - Marty claims a "former FDA Director" reviewed his CP prior to the filing - surely a real,
as opposed to fictional, former FDA Director would know that the CP was being filed incorrectly as you have
pointed out?

Roger Newman, Contributor
I have emailed Mr. Shkreli's attorney (won't call him Marty as I don't know him and everyone is entitled to a measure
of respect regardless of how you may feel about them) and await a response. The response will likely not come
leaving me in the position of having made an accusation that stands unchallenged. Funny that he listed his attorneys
and not a PR firm, or his own contact information, on his press release. Also interesting that he isn't willing to back up
the reasoning allowing his CP, despite being more than happy to provide statutory quotes in the document itself, to
argue many other points that can be obfuscated and to suggest that a former FDA official reviewed his filing. In this
case, the statute is clear and he has no argument to make, thus his silence.


This should show individual investors that a good looking document is nothing more than that. You must dig into
what's behind it, and whether (in this case) it is statutorily valid, before blindly attributing any weight to it. I have
emailed my analysis to each reporter that I could find who had published any reference to the CP. I don't expect a
retraction or correction but perhaps they will be more careful with their due diligence before blindly picking up press
releases in the future.

I emailed my analysis to NEOP investor relations but as they are not attorneys I don't expect much there. They
thanked me for my email. As for liability, I am not a securities attorney and will not venture a guess as to whether any
potential liability exists, whether for making an FDA filing without merit only to move the stock price, or for stating that
a former FDA official was somehow involved. I agree that this seems to me a blatant attempt to manipulate the price
of a stock but I can't say whether that even violates any laws. I would suggest anyone who feels as I do to contact
your local representative, senator, the FDA and SEC. Although no action will likely be taken, it will at least serve to
highlight the problem and you never know...

Martin,


One thing is clear: you don't understand how the Citizen's Petition process is supposed to work and you are wasting
the public's time/money.


Your Citizens Petition was filed before it was applicable (a pending NDA is required), on a drug that is not seeking
approval under either code section which provides for the submission of a Citizens Petition (a requirement of section
505(q) which created the Citizens Petition), therefore it is invalid.


I assume you already know all of this. However, it's pretty clear you are 'fomenting' in order to benefit your position.

Maybe I've been missing something Mr Shkreli, but if the FDA WILL NOT allow trials to be done comparing a new
drug with non-approved drugs, how would your CP have any validity since you say Lympho shouldn't be approved
because neop didnt compare it to VBD and the OFF-LABEL S.Coloid? 
How COULD neop have done a trial that you suggest when the FDA FORBIDS it?

Author’s reply »  If that's the case you might be right! Don't forget it's possible Neoprobe has attempted to
switch their indication to something that has nothing to do with sentinel nodes, in which case their label might
say something like "DO NOT USE THIS FOR SENTINEL LYMPH NODE DETECTION". At least that's what
the company is telling people now.

I contacted Mr. Shkreli's attorney, as he suggested and received, as expected, no response. Mr.Shkreli's
categorization of the CP process is false at best. It can be used to generate citizen comment but that comment must
comply with the regulations. Mr. Shkreli's clearly did not and he chooses to simply ignore that accusation. Mr. Shkreli,
as your attorney has chosen to ignore my inquiry, perhaps you'd like to address my accusation? I intend to fedex a
letter to the director of enforcement of the SEC (much more effective than on online complaint). It may receive no
notice but I'm certain I can think of some other officials who would be interested in your clearly manipulative behavior.
Still happy to receive your response to my well-reasoned legal argument but I suppose you will continue to hide
behind a silent attorney.

Martin, market for Lymphoseek reported by Neoprobe of 450 million is that worldwide? And that includes ALL
indications that currently have not finished trials yet Im guessing,. 
And what about EU Approval? more trials need to be done to market in Europe correct? I havent heard Neoprobe's
position on this regarding any agreement that Europe will accept the FDA trials as an affirmative to market in Europe
without any trials new trials necessary. ..This may take years to get approved In Europe!

I dont buy into Cardnial Healths partnership as meaning an 100% affirmative for L;ymphoseek.Cardnial has nothing to

They have not financed Neoprobe's Clinical Trials,they have not put up any upfront money for Lymphoseek,they just
wait to see if it gets approved or not,. 
No risk at all';.

Once again, Mr. Shkreli is more than happy to discuss my comments in a non-public forum. Whether you not you
agree with his thesis on NEOP, one this is irrefutable, he will not address my accusations regarding the invalidity of
his Citizens Petition. His attorney is also uninterested. One can only assume that he nothing to say to refute my
claims which are well-grounded in the law. Nice to try to argue when you have something that is subject to opinion,

A Hedge Fund who is Short Shares of NEOP Files a Citizen’s Petition – Things That Make You Go Hmmm? 
Yesterday, in what can only be viewed as an act of hubris, hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli of MSMB capital filed
on 
behalf of himself (and we assume a group of short sellers), a citizen’s petition imploring that the FDA not approve or 
consider approving Lymphoseek. While we are big proponents of the open market system, and believe that long and
short 
investors have a right to voice their opinions, we believe that anyone who thinks that they can influence the Food and

Drug 
Administration may have ulterior motives, to say the least. At the end of the day, we are confident the FDA will
approve OR 
reject the application based on the data and quality of the NDA, and not on the 9 page plea of a fund manager sitting
at a 
desk in NY. Potential motivation for this individual? At the end of his own citizen’s petition, he states “I am a hedge
fund 
manager who will benefit financially from a decline in the stock price of the corporation developing Lymphoseek.” Can
the 
SEC say “Conflict of interest?”

Roger Newman, Contributor
Once again Mr. Shkreli is hiding behind what he refers to as so called complexity. Mr. Shkreli, either your petition is
valid or it is not. It is quite easy to cite a code section in support of your position but you cannot and thus do not want
to go on record. I'll even make it easy for you, how is your petition allowed under section 505(q) in light of my
analysis. Strange how your attorney, whom you asked me to contact, had no interest in responding to my email to
him. Delay, delay, delay. You write quite eloquently on topics you choose, so why the silence. Legal analysis lends
itself to written communication in all cases but yours, it seems.

Martin, you're missing the point. Just b/c the FDA gave you a docket number, it doesn't mean the materiality
or substance of your CP is valid. It's just procedure. I suspect they will reject it in short course, because your
CP is addressing an NDA which has yet to be filed, which makes your CP invalid. Read up on the CP section
in the law, as rknatty is correct.

I've read all the comments and while everyone has their own opinion, I think I have come to one conclusion:

If your "data" is correct, wouldn't the NDA be rejected by the FDA? I'm sure thats the case, so this whole charade is
just a way to try to keep new investors scared and the price down, so you can cover and make a few million at the
expense of people who actually believe in a diagnostic that could help thousands of people.

"(b) A petition (including any attachments) must be submitted in accordance with 10.20 and in the following
form:"


and section 10.30 says:


"(i) All submissions to the Division of Dockets Management are representations that, to the best of the
knowledge, information, and belief of the person making the submission, the statements made in the
submission are true and accurate. All submissions are subject to the False Reports to the Government Act
(18 U.S.C. 1001) under which a willfully false statement is a criminal offense."


The multiple inaccurate/incorrect/pure fabrications of Marty's CP have been listed here and elsewhere so I
won't bother regurgitating the list - but it's clear to these eyes that he's either set himself up for criminal
prosecution or made an (inter)national display of immense stupidity - neither of which should be of much
comfort to his "clients".


Personally, I suspect he'll withdraw the petition (ASAP, if he has a shred of common sense) and not bother to
resubmit it at the appropriate time, as he's already accomplished what he needed it to do.

Let's talk some about your supposed analysis of Lymphoseek's market potential.


In your first blog (June 1, 2011), in which you declared your skepticism of Lymphoseek’s market potential, you stated
“The AWP of sulfur colloid is $53.20[3]”. Reference [3] for Code A9520 that you cited actually turned out to be 2005
prices: www.noridianmedicare.c...


After checking your reference I informed you that you were incorrect. In fact the 2005 price shown was $71.25 not
$53.20.  
When I made you aware of your error (or lie), you immediately began using a $75 price for Sulphur Colloid.


I also noticed that in your first blog you concluded Lymphoseek's market potential to be $15,000,000. Yet in your
comments above you’ve stated it’s now $25,000,000.


Care to comment on why your opinion has been revised 60% higher so quickly…?

Author’s reply »  You should work for politicians. I revised my estimate 60% higher. So dramatic. Check out
the survey I commissioned on colloid pricing on my website. $75 is about the average price from 11 hospitals
I surveyed. I'm doing a new survey of 100 hospitals soon.


13 Jun 2011, 09:15 PM


ddbuyerhere@yahoo.com
Okay great, then you agree that Lymphoseek's market potential is now at least $25,000,000 annually. We're
headed in the right direction!


Next point... Your "survey" is for the sales price of Sulfer Colloid to the hospitals, etc. I was most curious
about the discrepancy in your survey though. The manufacturer, CIS, states that Sulfer Colloid is sold in 5-kit
packages of 10ml multi-dose vials, and I've verified this with two different distributors.


www.ccsnm.org/pdfs/201...


However, your supposed "survey" states that Sulfer Colloid is sold on a "per milligram", "per gram", "per
millicurie" or a "per milliliter" basis. That's not even close to what the manufacturer and distributors are saying.


In fact, a millicurie is measurement of radiation, not a physical quantity. Sulfer Colloid is not sold by the
"millicurie".


Any explanation for all of the inconsistencies in your supposed "survey" that has no references, no contacts
for confirmation, and inconsistent per-unit quantities... some of which don't even exist?

"Get a grip and realize its the content of the CP that matters." - Martin Shkreli


Sure. We'll let the FDA decide if the CP was appropriately filed. In the meantime let's delve into that content you
mentioned.


One of your arguments in the CP was that "...The FDA has long held the standard of “best current care” as a control
group." - Citizens Petition


Yet in your comments above you stated: "There is no FDA requirement that a new agent must go through studies
comparing the agent to the best standards" - Martin Shkreli


You appear to be tripping over your own arguments.


But let's move on to another more argument you made. In your CP you stated: "License status of control group is not
relevant to FDA. There are many examples where the FDA has requested control groups with off-label or non-
approved agents." (CP - Page 4)


I'm most interested in this point. If there are many examples would you mind sharing a few examples with the
readers? TIA

NEOP responds to the CP and shoots down MS in flames (part of PR quoted below):


""On behalf of our client, Neoprobe Corporation ("Neoprobe"), we submit these comments in response to a
Citizen Petition recently filed by a hedge fund manager who acknowledged being a short-seller who could
potentially benefit financially from a decline in Neoprobe's stock price. In connection with the filing of the
Citizen Petition, the short-seller disseminated multiple press releases and articles repeating many of the
unfounded allegations and erroneous misrepresentations contained in the Citizen Petition. Regardless of
whether the Citizen Petition is ultimately found to be a "sham" by any regulatory agency, we are submitting
these comments in order to correct the record.


As explained below, the Citizen Petition is baseless and replete with factual and regulatory misstatements,
served under a cloak of legitimacy. The petitioner selectively cites Neoprobe press releases, SEC filings and
literature references, yet omits information from public filings, disclosures, and statements made by the
company, as well as other relevant references from the literature, which are unfavorable to the Petition. FDA
regulations, however, require the disclosure of information, known to the petitioner, even if unfavorable to the
Petition.


In addition, the Petition requests that FDA refrain from approving, and take the unprecedented step of
denying the opportunity for review of, an NDA not filed yet with the agency -- asking FDA to prejudge an
application regardless of its scientific merit or potential public health impact. However, as FDA stated as
recently as this month, the Citizen Petition process was not intended to vitiate an NDA applicant's procedural

rights by requiring FDA to respond to a Citizen Petition and "make decisions on complex scientific issues
specific to pending applications ..."


While the Petition's factual inaccuracies, mischaracterizations, and misstatements are numerous, three
allegations, in particular, serve as the crux of the petitioner's baseless request.


First, the Citizen Petition is premised upon the mischaracterization of Neoprobe's intended label indication for
Lymphoseek as "sentinel lymph node mapping." This fundamentally mischaracterizes Neoprobe's regulatory
focus for the soon to be filed NDA, developed after multiple discussions with FDA during the IND process, for
the approval of Lymphoseek. Indeed, as Neoprobe has repeatedly noted in SEC filings and other public
disclosures, Neoprobe's regulatory-appropriate clinical trials were designed to achieve an indication for
"anatomical delineation of lymphatic tissue," not "sentinel lymph node mapping." Anatomic delineation of
lymphatic tissue is used in regulatory settings to describe the general identification of lymphatic tissue without
regard to specific position or location. In contrast, sentinel lymph node mapping is used for precise
identification of the first predictive lymph node(s) in the regional basin of neoplasms. The distinction is critical
to understanding the study design, and exemplifies the types of flaws evident throughout the Petition.


Second, the Citizen Petition repeatedly asserts that Neoprobe's studies should be entirely discounted
because vital blue dye was used as the "truth standard" or comparator in the design of the studies, rather
than using vital blue dye plus sulfur colloid as the comparator. This assertion reveals the petitioner's
fundamental mischaracterization of the facts, and the legal and regulatory framework for the design of studies
required for drug approval. FDA has not reviewed prospective, adequate, well-controlled studies for sulfur
colloid for anatomic delineation of lymphatic tissue, and sulfur colloid is not approved by FDA for this
indication. Thus, the only appropriate comparator in the instant case is vital blue dye, which received FDA
approval for the indication sought by Lymphoseek.


Finally, the petitioner asserts that a "truth standard" should be required for the assessment of all
radiopharmaceutical diagnostics, and claims that the appropriate "truth standard" in the instant case should
be axillary nodal dissection. Not surprisingly, however, the petitioner fails to cite any FDA regulations that
support this conclusion. Instead, rather than evaluating current medical literature, the petitioner cites an
outdated 1994 article as support for his assertion. Petitioner conveniently ignores the substantial scientific
advancement during the past seventeen years, demonstrating that axillary nodal dissection in the instant case
would, in fact, have subjected patients to numerous, unnecessary risks, representing safety and ethical
considerations in the conduct of such a study. Paradoxically, the petitioner also asserts that "[s]entinel lymph
node mapping, dissection and diagnosis is the standard of care for patients with breast and melanoma
cancer" -- citing two references from 2011 in support of this statement. This statement completely contradicts
the assertion that axillary nodal dissection should be used as the comparator, or "truth standard," in the
instant case. This fundamental internal inconsistency further exemplifies the flaws inherent throughout the
Petition. "

This is a war.


As all wars, longs are losing this one because we are fragmented and do not have a common front.


Shrekli chose this stock to short because there is very limited institutional ownership, and he knew retail investors
would panic and sell as losses mount.


However, reading this board, the Oldtimers board, and Twitter, it is clear to me there is a core of insightful long term
investors, that really understand the science and regulatory path for Lymphoseek and Rigs. This core is buying on the
dip, but in a disorganised way.


Therefore, I make a call here to all serious investors to join in a common front against the market manipulators such
as Shrekli. I refuse to be the victim of this war, waiting for the SEC to come to the rescue.


We have 2 days to get organised before the short sale restrictions are lifted again and the attack resumes. Let's
create a "social network hedge fund". This is the plan:


1) All of you who are planning to buy, let's set our good till cancelled buy orders at $3.05 before Friday. Traders have
highlighted this as a support level, and the stock indeed bounced at that price today. By setting our buy orders there
we will benefit additionally of TA-driven traders. If we all do this, we should see an insurmountable wall of buy orders
build up at $3.05, "scaring our enemies and giving us courage"


2) Let us make the pledge to not sell a single share below $5.50. This is the point where Shkreli started shorting. If he
shorts at $3.05 (point 1) but knows he won't be able to buy back till $5.50 he might think it twice. We can thus also
take advantage of the Russell reconstitution, that will greatly increase the amount of institutional investors that have to
buy and hold the stock. Decreased offer of stock on sale will make it more expensive to buy, and could squeeze
Shrekli and other opportunistic shorts.


3) Make sure your brokerage is not lending your shares for shorting. If they are lent, demand them to be restituted to
you and blocked from future lending. That will choke Shrkeli's firepower. bit.ly/kD5wPV


4) Let's request in the coming shareholder meeting to use part of the $30M proceeds of the sale of gamma device
business to repurchase shares below $4. $15M should be enough to finance LS to market and restart Rigs, so the
company could use the other $15M in short term to repurchase shares. This would compound effect of point 2,
especially if we get it into the agenda soon. Write a mail to NEOP to request this.


If you are with me, promote this post in any way you can, and place your buy orders at $3.05. Fellow $NEOP
shareholders, we could make history here!

"I used one of the expert networking firms to conduct a sulfur colloid pricing survey" - Martin Shkreli


Why?


Tc99m Sulfer Colloid is FDA approved for imaging of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, etc. (www.rxlist.com/cis-sul...).
Sulfer Colloid is not approved for anatomic delineation, lymphatic mapping or even SLNB.

The Lymphoseek NDA will be seeking approval for anatomic delineation, including general lymphatic mapping. The
only FDA-approved agent for general lymphatic mapping is Isosulfan Blue.


So in fact Lymphoseek will be competing with Isosulfan Blue, not Sulfer Colloid. It should compete quite well too,
considering Lymphoseek clearly proved superior in a recent FDA-approved Phase III clinical trial
(neoprobe.com/pressrele...).


The price for Lymphazurin (Isosulfan Blue) is ~$6,500 for a six-pack of 5ml vials (30ml total)
www.medexsupply.com/la....


Each vial is labeled as "single dose". However there is some literature that indicates max patient dosing is ~3ml. So I
suppose it's possible to squeeze up to ten patient treatments out of each six-pack. That would translate to a COST to
the hospital of approximately $650 per patient dose.


We both know the hospitals will mark up that cost to a profitable level. That higher retail price is the figure that
Lymphoseek will ultimately compete with... $650++ per patient...

"I commissioned a survey of hospitals to determine their acquisition price for Tc-99 sulfur colloid" - Martin Shkreli


Acquisition price? oops... you blew it again. The acquisition price is irrelevant. You failed to account for one key point.


Neoprobe management has disclosed that their distribution agreement with Cardinal Health is a revenue sharing plan
based on the RETAIL price generated from each Lymphoseek procedure (www.neoprobe.com/ASCO2...)


Cardinal will distribute Lymphoseek to the end users ready for use and "hot" (Tc99 isotope included). Neoprobe will
receive 50% of that higher retail price. The wholesale price or acquisition price of any "cold" agent is irrelevant.

You and I had what I believe was a mature conversation the other day. As I think you will agree, I have not, and will
not, attack you personally. As I said, we are entitled to our opinion. I just questioned your motives as not trying to
protect the public health as you claim. You are out to make a profit and there is nothing wrong with that. I am most
interested, however in your answer to the question posed by DDbuyer as I feel it is clear, focused and addresses a
claim raised by you in your CP.


"License status of control group is not relevant to FDA. There are many examples where the FDA has requested
control groups with off-label or non-approved agents." (CP - Page 4)


Can you cite even one SPECIFIC example? I would be most impressed if you can.


At least your making a few dollars from all of the page views here! Thanks in advance for your hopeful response.


18 Jun 2011, 10:39 PM


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  There are over a dozen such examples.


Azathioprine (lupus) and other off-label drugs were the "standard of care" in the Benlysta study. Physicians
have been using off-label drugs as standards for decades. Realize that this is how the practice of medicine
works.


Belatacept was just approved last week for transplant rejection. The FDA and physicians understood that the
widely-used off-label prednisone had to be a part of the clinical trial.


If you want to replace a standard of care, you should study your drug against the standard of care, right?


With respect to your initial CP, my consultants have informed me that because we filed under 21 CFR 10.30,
your questions are moot. It is true that our inclusion of 505q is controversial and possibly invalid but the 21
CFR 10.30 reference supercedes any other reference. Hope that helps with your CP filing route questions.


19 Jun 2011, 12:48 PM


ddbuyerhere@yahoo.com
Absolutely false. Azathioprine was not part of Benlysta's pivotal trial design. Benlysta was compared to a
placebo, with trial endpoints based on improvements of the SRI response rates.


By the way, Azathioprine is not the standard of care for SLE (lupus). I know from personal experience that
Plaquenil is the standard of care, with Methotrexate if needed, and steroid use to control inflammation and/or
flares.

So there seems to be the rub. Per your examples above (and your knowledge of this company is impressive),
the company at no time says explicitly that the FDA told them that they should not compare lymphoseek to
the sulfur colloid.


The language they use is very guarded and very telling. If the FDA explicitly told them that they did not need
to compare to the sulfur colloid, why not EXPLICITLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY say so?

They have stated it repeatedly and extensively. Here's another quote:


"Pykett says the decision to move ahead with Lymphoseek's initial approval filing based on studies comparing
Lymphoseek to vital blue dye alone came after "at length" discussions with FDA in which the agency made a
clear distinction between a lymph node mapping indication similar to vital blue dye and sentinel lymph node
detection."


The FDA made a "clear distinction", and the FDA further "cautioned the company not to use an off-label drug
in its studies".

"Because the radioactive colloid in the procedure is used “off-label” — which means the FDA hasn’t approved

Your sockpuppet responses are getting quite boring....you keep asking and DDBuyer keeps supplying, yet still
you deny the evidence.


Guess you won't be satisfied until the FDA responds to the NDA? Might want to cover your short well before
then to avoid the inevitable run-up that always precedes expectations of news from the FDA.

No, all you provided were some quotes about what the company believed the FDA said, not what they
explicitly said. I imagine the company has minutes of their FDA meetings, why not just disclose the relevant
sections?


In any case, it seems you are such a fervent pumper that you refuse to even consider that you are wrong
(though your verbosity is impressive). Doesn't matter to me, as I'm making money shorting this, but it's pretty
clear discussing with you is about as enlightening as discussing with a reading lamp.


Good luck with your investments, it appears you will need it.

I meant to ask you something else...


Would you share with everyone your personal definition of the "Total potential market" for a new drug or, as an
alternative, how you approach defining such a total potential market?


Thanks!

Martin,


I looked into your survey responses. The data is pretty weak. Can you try to get survey information from maybe
nuclear techs? I think your respondents are confused with units in regards to appropriate price in a real life clinical
situation. (nuclear depts generally get sulfur colloid from radiopharmacy not in house hospital pharmacy)----there
mostly lies the confusion 
My guess would be an average $100 99mTc filtered sulfur colloid unit hot dose on average. (The radiopharmacy
usually will even break the dose into 4 individual syringes for the 4 separate injections if that is what the injector
prefers)


My advice would be to prepare a survey in which you get unit hot dose pricing.

re: “How does Lymphoseek plus blue dye compare to sulfur colloid versus blue dye?” Neoprobe hasn’t answered that
question and the FDA won’t approve Lymphoseek so until they do.


Funny that not a single physician, not one, has publicly agreed with Shkreli's statement. Even Dr. Sabel never said
that he believed the FDA would not approve Lympho. I suspect that is why he made Shkreli remove his audio clip
from his website....which by the way has been shut down due to copyright infringement.


On the other hand several physicians have publicly stated that NEOP absolutely used the correct comparator.

"being long on Neoprobe is the logical choice"


Funny. You should mortgage your house and out it all in NEOP, then.
