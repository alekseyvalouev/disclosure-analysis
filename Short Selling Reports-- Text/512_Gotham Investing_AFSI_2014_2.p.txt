AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I
Oct. 29, 2014 10:29 AM ET58 comments
by: Gotham Investing


Summary


AFSI exhibits all the traits of prior P&C insurance blow-ups.


Analysis of NYDFS conditions imposed on AFSI indicates regulators may share the
shorts' concerns.


Questions raised by critics about AFSI's accounting remain unanswered.


Price target: $0 (Insolvent).


Introduction


I believe the equity in AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) is worthless, and I
believe the market will soon come around to my view as a number of catalysts fall into
place to expose what I believe are substantial accounting violations at AFSI.


One of these catalysts is increased scrutiny of AFSI's accounting and financial condition
from regulators, particularly the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS"). I
believe additional oversight from the NYDFS will put direct and indirect pressure on AFSI
to improve internal controls, use more reasonable accounting assumptions, and correct
material misstatements.


Given how leveraged AFSI already is on an unadjusted basis (see below), I believe even
a small accounting correction would be catastrophic for the company and the stock.
However, the magnitude of the Company's misstatements is anything but small.
Therefore, I expect AFSI to join the list of once-high-flying property and casualty carriers
who inevitably crash and burn when they are no longer able to outrun their reserving and
other problems with additional growth.

III Analysis of NYDFS Conditions Validates AFSI Critics


IV Summary of Potential Accounting Violations at AFSI


V Conclusion


I. Business Overview


AFSI's chairman, Michael Karfunkel, along with his brother George Karfunkel (a director)
and his son-in-law Barry Zyskind, the CEO, founded AFSI to purchase a computer
warranty business in 1998. Since then, the company has grown from $10 million of gross
premiums written to over $5 billion of gross premiums, through a combination of
acquisitions, expanded geographies and/or products


Of AFSI's $3.1 billion of gross premiums written in the first half of 2014, approximately
44% were associated with workers' compensation policies the Company issued. Warranty
is the next largest line of business at 16% of year-to-date gross written premiums,
followed by other liability policies which represented 12%, and commercial auto at 7% of
AFSI's premiums.


AFSI reports results in three segments (a fourth segment is in runoff):


1. Small Commercial Business, the vast majority of which is workers' comp;
2. Specialty Risk & Extended Warranty, which houses all of AFSI's non-U.S. business,


along with its U.S. Warranty business; and
3. Specialty Program, which writes a combination of commercial auto, other liability, and


some workers' compensation.


Across the Small Commercial and Specialty Program segments, AFSI was the 8th-largest
workers' comp underwriter in the country in 2013.


Additionally, AFSI's significant quota share partner, Maiden Holdings (NASDAQ:MHLD), is
a related party due to its shared controlling shareholders, the Karfunkels.


II. Similarities to Other Property & Casualty Insurance Company Failures

The history of property and casualty insurers is littered with previously high-flying
companies that thought they had built a "better mouse trap" (or at least told investors they
had) that allowed them to generate superior returns. With their supposedly "better mouse
trap", these upstarts grew rapidly and investors crowed about their brilliance... for a while.


However, the story of a rapidly growing, casualty-focused insurer always seems to end the
same: badly. I expect AFSI to end just as badly, and I expect it to happen soon.


Of course, high-flying insurance companies are almost oxymoronic, because the primary
way an insurance company outperforms over long periods of time is by avoiding the
temptation to grow too quickly, since they are subject to such severe adverse selection.
That is why the high-flying new entrants inevitably fizzle out (or crash and burn).


As discussed in S&P's report "What May Cause Insurance Companies to Fail", AM Best's
Annual Impairment Studies, and the Federal Insurance Office's report "How to Modernize
and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States", these flame-outs
and failures typically share at least a few of the following attributes:

III. Regulators Appear to be Catching On to AFSI's Shenanigans (Thus Validating
The Shorts)


While AFSI has received a fair amount of press over the last year (most of it negative), it
was only recently that regulators began to take action, at least publicly. Specifically, the
New York Department of Financial Services' ("NYDFS") approval of ACP Re's acquisition
of Tower Group International, Ltd. was subject to five disclosed conditions (per AFSI's 8-
K), which are listed and discussed below.


Before analyzing the actual conditions, I think it's important to note that imposing
conditions such as these is unprecedented, as far as I can tell. Not only that, they were
imposed upon an affiliate of the acquirer (ACP Re), which may indicate just how
concerned the department is about AFSI's condition and accounting.


A natural question to ask is: If AFSI was not happy with the terms, why would it agree?


I would argue that AFSI had no choice but to accept the conditions, because if AFSI
balked at the prospect of providing the NYDFS with information or changing auditors, then
the NYDFS would have KNOWN they had to investigate ASAP. However, by accepting the
terms, AFSI at least bought itself some time.


Let's look at each of the conditions individually.


Condition #1: Strengthen actuarial resources

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 5/32


Form 8-K Excerpt:


"In accordance with an actuarial plan (the "Plan") submitted to and approved by the
Department, AmTrust will strengthen its actuarial resources to ensure by year-end
2015 that its actuarial scale and capabilities are commensurate with its size. This will
entail both hiring more actuaries, and ensuring that those currently on staff are
adequately credentialed. Further, in accordance with the Plan, AmTrust will better
institutionalize the role of its internal actuaries by creating a Global Chief Actuary
position, as well as Global Chief Reserving and Pricing Actuaries, all of whom will be
integrated into AmTrust's executive management team."


My comments:


While seemingly innocuous (Sell-side interpretation: "hire some extra actuaries and give
them fancy titles"), I think this condition is hard to understate. Insurance companies live
and die by their reserves, and the fact that the NYDFS seems to be uncomfortable with
the veracity of AFSI's reserves is incredibly concerning.


Two other relevant sets of data points color this condition further. First, Barron's raised
concerns that AFSI's reserves in their article "Balance Sheet Risk Makes AmTrust Shares
Vulnerable", by Bill Alpert (emphasis added):



http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB50001424053111904125704579588070459365540
5/20/2018 AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 6/32


"Earnings surely look good. In the 12 months through March, the company reported
that its net income totaled some $3.90 a share-making shares of the business
appear fairly priced at 11 times earnings. Those earnings, however, come mainly
from insuring property and casualty, which is known to have a "long tail." That is,
claims can be reported or litigated years after they arise, confounding what
seemed like a profitable underwriting record. When that happens, profits can
prove to be figments of aggressive premium writing and under-reserving for
loss.


Is that the case with AmTrust? Questions about whether the company is under-
reserved arise because of some puzzling accounting disparities: AmTrust and
Maiden Holdings show a $400 million difference in their accounting for the
same reinsurance activities; AmTrust's numbers for acquired reserves differ
by $50 million in different parts of its financial reports; while the latest 10-K's
tabulation of loss reserves leaves AmTrust with negative reserves for some
years-an impossible accounting that would mean that policyholders would
actually pay AmTrust millions for claims in those periods.


...


"Insurance investors usually study a company's annual tabulation of loss reserves
for each year. But, as noted, AmTrust's 10-K indicates that its reserves
remaining after claim payments for all the years up through 2007 are $95
million more than the amount for those years plus 2008 - which if correct,
would indicate that policyholders will pay AmTrust that $95 million on the 2008
incidents.


Malone says the fault is in our analysis, not the 10-K. But the same analysis was
used in an April industry study by AmTrust investment banker FBR Capital
Markets.


Loose accounting would only add to concerns about AmTrust's underwriting
rigor, given the evidence that the insurer picks unusually low estimates for its
eventual losses. Compared with peers in workers' compensation insurance, where
AmTrust gets half its revenue, the company ended up paying out a higher
percentage of its original estimate for losses on accidents in the years 2006
through 2012, according to an analysis of the industry's "paid-to-incurred" ratios in
FBR's April report."

Just in case AFSI's responses to questions not concerning enough, I would suggest
readers call the Maine Bureaus of Insurance and request a copy of the transcript of the
hearing to evaluate ACP Re's application for approval of the acquisition of Tower Group
International and its subsidiaries.


In response to a question about AFSI's actuarial resources at the hearing, AFSI's CFO
responded that the lead internal actuary is NOT a "full fellow" (page 49 of the transcript),
but noted the use of an outside consultant, Charlie Gruber of SG Risk, who is a "full
fellow".


Unfortunately, AFSI's choice of SG Risk raises more questions than it provides answers.
In 2010, SG Risk (among others) was sued by investors, after it came out that the trustees
of SG Risk's client, CRM Holdings, had been over 50% under-reserved in 2006. The
lawsuit also discussed the December 2009 "Notice of Imminent Enforcement Action" that
SG Risk's client received from the New York Attorney General, which stated:


"CRM and the Principals were assisted in implementing these improper practices by
CRM's actuary, Charles Gruber, of the actuarial firm of SG Risk, LLC, and its
accountant, Donald Neubecker, of the accounting firm of UHY LLP, who produced
misleading financial and actuarial reports for the trusts. These practices had the net
effect of artificially reducing liabilities as reported in the trusts' financial statements
that CRM and the Principals filed with the WCB."


If SG Risk is employing similar practices on behalf of AFSI, the Company could be
severely deficient in reserves. In light of AFSI's significant overlap with Tower Group's
exposures and Tower Group's massive reserve charges, this would not be particularly
surprising.


Given SG Risk's reputation, it would make sense for the NYDFS to commission an
independent reserve analysis like the one CRM's client did to ensure that AFSI is not in a
similar predicament.


Condition #2: Maximum NPW-to-Surplus of 3:1

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 8/32


"For the year ending December 31, 2015 and thereafter, AmTrust will cause its
insurance company subsidiaries to maintain, in the aggregate, a ratio of net written
premium to surplus of 3 to 1. Net written premium shall be net of reinsurance,
including business retroceded by AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ("AII") to
Maiden Insurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda insurer and an affiliate of the
Applicants [ACP and affiliates], AmTrust and National General Holdings Corp. In
support of the foregoing, AmTrust shall, subject to regulatory approval, modify its
current intercompany reinsurance structure by reducing the quota share cession to
AII to 60% effective January 1, 2015 and 50% effective January 1, 2016 and
thereafter."


My comments:


AFSI discloses the statutory surplus of individual subsidiaries, but it does not disclose its
consolidated statutory surplus, and frequently discusses its "total capitalization" under
GAAP, which analysts sometimes confuse with statutory capital.


Due to AFSI's highly complex and constantly changing organizational structure, the
Company's lack of disclosure with respect to consolidated statutory capital makes
evaluating AFSI's compliance with this condition difficult.


However, the differences between GAAP and statutory accounting are relatively
straightforward. The table below sets forth my estimate of consolidated statutory capital
(Unadjusted: $502.7 million, Adjusted: $856.8 million).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 9/32


As a result of this analysis, I believe AFSI needs to raise at least $292 million. However,
this estimate is before considering the effects of the accounting concerns expressed in the
next section of growth.


Incorporating 25% growth in the second half of 2014 (probably conservative), I estimate
AFSI needs to raise over $400 million, only a small portion of which can be debt-funded
due to leverage ratio covenants. Should my and others' accounting concerns be confirmed
through NYDFS oversight or otherwise, the hole could be much, much larger.


Condition #3: Reduction in line 4 of AII's 2013 statutory balance sheet

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 10/32


Form 8-K Excerpt:


AmTrust will cause the intercompany receivables included on line 4 of AII's 2013
statutory balance sheet to be paid down on or before December 31, 2015, with at
least 50% of the amount to be paid on or before December 31, 2014. The method(s)
by which these receivables are paid off shall be subject to the review and prior
approval of the Department.


My comments:


While AII's statutory balance sheet is not publicly available, the Bermuda Insurance
Accounts Regulations 1980 indicates that line 4 represents investments in and advances
to affiliates. In other words, this line represents AII's ownership in other AFSI subsidiaries.


Interestingly, this seems to touch upon an exchange between Mr. Alpert and AFSI (per
AmTrust's response to Barron's):


Question 7: AmTrust subsidiaries' 2013 Schedule Y, Part 1A show AII owning about
$300 million worth of affiliates like Rochdale, AIUL (Ireland) and AEL (NASDAQ:UK)
that all retain some risk, so how accessible is that piece of AII's capital(?)


Company's Response to Question 7: Schedule Y part 1 does not show any
capital/surplus amounts. Therefore, Schedule Y part 1 does not show that AII owns
about $300 million worth of affiliates.


AII owns Amtrust International Management, which owns 50% of Amtrust Equity
Solutions, which owns Rochdale, AIUL as well as IGI - AII's total indirect ownership
of those three companies is $237 million.


The capital of Rochdale, AIUL and AEL is very accessible. The total statutory capital
of the companies mentioned is $475 million and is 3.7 times those same entities
required capital of $128 million. The company could reallocate capital if necessary.
In addition, the combined liquid assets of Rochdale, AIUL and AEL is over $1.0
billion.


Editorial Note: While the Schedule Y, Part 1 does not show capital amounts, it does
provide the ownership structure, which can be used in conjunction with Footnote 22
of AFSI's 10-K to get the numbers used in this discussion.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 11/32


This is important because AII is already very thinly capitalized, as Barron's pointed out
(see below), and AFSI does not have capital at the holding company that it can contribute
to replace the assets that the NYDFS is requiring AFSI remove from AII.


The cantilevering of AmTrust premiums over its capital base is notable, because that
base contains an element that differs from most American property and casualty
insurers. AmTrust's local insurance units cede over half of their premiums and
losses to the company's wholly owned "captive" reinsurer in Bermuda (which, as
noted, then cedes risk to Maiden).


State insurance filings of AmTrust units show that the Bermuda captive has lost
about $400 million under its reinsurance agreements with its AmTrust counterparts
in the last five years. The Bermuda unit's regulatory capital fell last year from $499
million to $416 million, a level just over two-times the minimum required for
"solvency" under Bermuda's relatively lenient standards. By contrast, Maiden ended
the year with more than four times Bermuda's capital requirement.


AmTrust's Bermuda unit is more than adequately capitalized, says Malone, and its
numbers shouldn't be compared with those of any other reinsurer. That's because it
reinsures only stable, predictable risks, she says.


Condition #4: AFSI is required to change auditors


Form 8-K Excerpt:


In light of AmTrust's growth and increased geographic footprint, AmTrust will engage
an external auditing firm with corresponding global resources and skills beginning
with the audit for the annual period ending December 31, 2015. Before the
engagement is undertaken, the selection of the auditing firm shall be subject to the
review and prior approval of the Department.


My comments:


Even the most ardent AFSI bull must have been a little fazed by this condition, because
(1) AFSI wasn't even the actual acquirer, and (2) it indicates DFS may be less than
confident in AFSI's financial statements. In contrast, bears (myself included) seem excited
about the prospect of a new auditor reviewing AFSI's financial statements.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 12/32


I would add that BDO might decide to tighten their review so as to avoid the
embarrassment of having a new auditor force a restatement of financials that were
blessed by BDO.


Condition #5: Provide the NYDFS any and all financial information requested


Form 8-K Excerpt:


AmTrust shall, beginning with the month ending September 30, 2014, and for a
period of not less than three years, provide to the Department any and all financial
information as the Department may request.


My comments:


Yet again, the second Barron's article offers investors a clue as to what the NYDFS saw
that prompted them to request access to any and all financial information:


"Insurance investors usually study a company's annual tabulation of loss reserves
for each year. But, as noted, AmTrust's 10-K indicates that its reserves remaining
after claim payments for all the years up through 2007 are $95 million more than the
amount for those years plus 2008 - which if correct, would indicate that policyholders
will pay AmTrust that $95 million on the 2008 incidents.


Malone says the fault is in our analysis, not the 10-K. But the same analysis was
used in an April industry study by AmTrust investment banker FBR Capital Markets.


Loose accounting would only add to concerns about AmTrust's underwriting rigor,
given the evidence that the insurer picks unusually low estimates for its eventual
losses. Compared with peers in workers' compensation insurance, where AmTrust
gets half its revenue, the company ended up paying out a higher percentage of its
original estimate for losses on accidents in the years 2006 through 2012, according
to an analysis of the industry's "paid-to-incurred" ratios in FBR's April report."


Furthermore, this request implies that the NYDFS did not have access to all financial
information. Therefore, the suggestion that NYDFS approval was somehow a stamp of
approval (as some sell-side analysts have suggested) appears to be unfounded.


Finally, I would note that Ocwen (NYSE:OCN) agreed to conditions with the NYDFS in
conjunction with an acquisition. Anyone familiar with how Lawsky and the NYDFS have
dealt with Ocwen know it was anything but a stamp of approval.

IV. Potential Accounting Violations at AFSI


Barron's, Off Wall Street, and GeoInvesting have all publicly criticized or raised questions
about AFSI's accounting, and while AFSI's management claims to have silenced critics, I
believe their responses raise more questions than answers.


Specific areas of concern raised by AFSI's critics include:


1. Consolidation of Loss & loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") ceded to wholly-owned
Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives ("LRCs");


2. Discrepancies between the financial statements of AFSI & Related Party Maiden
Holdings ("MHLD");


3. Accounting for deferred acquisition costs;
4. Discrepancies among AFSI's disclosures with respect to Loss & LAE Reserves


assumed in conjunction with acquisitions; and
5. Valuation of life settlement contracts, among others.


In the interest of brevity, I will only discuss the Luxembourg issue in this article.


AFSI's Explanations of Luxembourg Accounting: Inadequate and Different
Depending on the Audience


AFSI shares fell precipitously last December after GeoInvesting wrote "AmTrust Financial
Services: House of Cards?" In a hastily arranged conference call on December 16, 2013,
management denied the allegation, but provided no answer beyond a flat denial and
generalizations about Luxembourg captives, without answering the question of why AFSI
seemed to ignore losses ceded to Luxembourg but did reflect the benefit to AFSI's
Bermuda subsidiary


When Barron's questioned AFSI about why it did not reflect the losses of wholly-owned
subsidiaries in its SEC filings, management gave a rather curious response (that the
losses are excluded because they are inflated "artificially"):



https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards
5/20/2018 AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 14/32


"While the profit benefit appears in AmTrust's consolidated financials, losses it ceded
to its Luxembourg units don't. AmTrust tells Barron's that those losses are inflated
"artificially" or "synthetically" and don't reflect the real world claims on its primary
insurance subsidiaries. "It's a way to draw down these reserves," says CEO Zyskind.
"They are self-created losses within our organization, so they get completely
eliminated in consolidation."


AmTrust says the arrangement is proper under U.S. and Luxembourg rules. That's
interesting, since the company is reporting loss numbers to auditors and insurance
commissioners that it acknowledges aren't authentic. The statutory filings AmTrust
subsidiaries submitted to their state regulators over that same 2010 to 2012 period
show nearly a quarter of a billion dollars-worth of these inflated losses going to
Luxembourg. The synthetic losses also appear on the financial statements of
AmTrust's Bermuda captive, AmTrust International Insurance, which it says are done
according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles under the eyes of the
audit firm BDO USA."


Apparently, that comment did not go over particularly well with someone, because just
days after the article was published, AFSI management stated that the loss are, in fact,
real:


Robert Farnam - KBW


Hi there. Thanks. A couple of questions. It sounds like lot of the people that had with
the short[ph] had issues with Schedule Y. So can you, I don't know Barry or Ron, can
you just go over again how Schedule Y does work or doesn't work as it relates to
your relationships with Luxembourg?


Michael Saxon


Schedule Y is a representation of transaction among companies within the holding
company system, not limited to insurers transactions. To the extent that there is
management fees or other organization vertically integrated organizations are
disclosed in Schedule Y. Schedule Y on a particular column that people like to
reference, that is a net number of premiums lost it. It's not like Schedule F in the
reinsurance activity, it's just a recast among affiliated companies with the holding
company. And again as Barry said in his comments, Schedule Y represents the net
ceded loss to our Luxembourg captives based on our reinsurance structure.

5/20/2018 AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 15/32


AFSI's CEO also made contradictory remarks on the Q4'13 earnings call. First, he
described the "stop-loss" agreement between AII and Socare:


"... We entered into a stop loss agreement between our Bermuda reinsurance
company, AmTrust International and Socare. The agreement provides that coverage
is triggered if AmTrust losses exceed certain attachment points, obligating the
captive to pay Bermuda a maximum of $100 million in losses. In 2013 these stop
loss agreements generated losses net of premium of $58 million to Socare.
This results in the drawdown of $58 million of redundant equalization reserves and
allows AmTrust to recognize a gain of approximately $5.2 million."


Socare was re-named AmTrust Re Theta on December 20, 2012.


One can retrieve the financial statements for AFSI's Luxembourg subsidiaries at
www.gbrdirect.eu and confirm that AFSI did cede losses in excess of premiums of
approximately $58 million to AmTrust Re Theta.


Here's where the story breaks down. On the same Q4'13 earnings call, the CEO also said
(emphasis added):


"... I want to address the references to Schedule Y in the annual statements filed by
our U.S. insurers. Schedule Y is intended to show the net income effect of
reinsurance agreements with affiliated insurers within a holding company group.
Schedule Y shows correctly the aggregate net income effect to our
Luxembourg companies resulting from their assumption of intra-company
financial losses for AmTrust International."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2610245-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-i 16/32


However, the Schedule Y of AFSI's US subsidiaries tells a different story:


Once again, AFSI's "explanation" falls apart under scrutiny. Perhaps one of the
cheerleaders universally buy-rated analysts will ask the CEO to explain these
contradictions on the earnings call next week.


VI. Conclusion


As discussed above, AFSI has all the features of a high-flying insurance company
destined for disaster. The second critical element, regulatory scrutiny, is also now in place.
Finally, a review of AFSI's attempts to explain away its accounting criticisms indicates that
the reason it cannot provide a clear answer is that the critics are on to something.


Considering AFSI's tangible book value is only $888 million, and losses ceded to
Luxembourg, which do not appear to be reflected in AFSI's SEC filings, exceed $250
million, and AFSI's discrepancies with MHLD are nearly $400 million (per Barron's), it is
easy to imagine a scenario in which the remaining tangible book value gets wiped out, just
as it did at Tower Group, when it finally admitted to being severely under-reserved.


As such, my price target is $0. In future articles, I will provide additional details for
why I believe AmTrust is insolvent and what catalysts I expect to precipitate AFSI's
final descent.

I make so much money selling puts and buying calls off these (plural pejorative of your choice) that I can't really
complain about their BLATANT SHORT ATTACKS. They have been far less successful over 2014 because people are
starting to realize that AFSI is a sound company and that groups like Geo and Gotham are just in the game for short-
term (get it SHORT term) profits. It really should be illegal what they do - distort and short - but again, let them keep at
it so I can keep making boat loads of money working the manipulated dips.

While not a fan of Am Trust or their reputation in the industry, I think the author is "off" on their analysis of "actuaries"
and his understanding related to insurance. I worked for public P/C company that would have been considered the
same situation (under resourced from an actuarially perspective) but the industry has many safeguards for this;
Pricing is based on filed rates by ISO; use of accountants to validate gross and account level reserves; history on
case reserves to set appropriate level of reservces. Many companies that are growing under resource on actuary
because it can essentially be contracted via accountants, etc. You are over analyzing this aspect for sure.

I agree - reserve problems tend to be the result of poor risk selection and underwriting, or management decisions to
lean towards the more aggressive end of the range when setting or releasing reserves. Actuarial quality has a certain
baseline of competency, and while it is both an art and a science to develop high quality reserves, it isn't rocket
science. A much bigger driver is the business strategy and governance approach of the firm both at senior
management and board level. If you are worried about reserving have a look at the business profile, high market
share growth in volatile segments and the quality and experience of of board directors before the actuarial team.

With respect to growth in volatile segments...how about CA WC and Italian Med Mal? They have gone from
nothing to huge in both since ~1/1/10. There aren't many segments more volatile than these two...


29 Oct 2014, 09:18 PM


ddddr224234
Let's talk about Italian Med Mal. They entered Italian Med Mal after pricing had risen significantly. Second,
they had an 80% quota share agreement with Berkshire Hathaway and Ajit Jain who decided that the market
was attractive enough to participate.


See below for the insurance insider article on Berkshire taking an 80% quota share. This points to responsible
underwriting when prices are good enough and not the other way around.

30 Oct 2014, 09:45 AM


ddddr224234
Also, to address CA workers compensation in more detail.


Here's a link to the CA wokers comp market share data. The article states, "The data show that Berkshire
Hathaway wrote nearly $1 billion of the state's total written premium last year to become the state's largest
private carrier group. The group's California workers' comp writings were up $319 million or 49% from 2012
and up $616 million from 2011. The group is lead by the Cypress Insurance Company, which wrote $500
million in workers' comp in California last year up from $324 million in 2012. Berkshire's overall total was also
helped by its earlier acquisition of the Guard companies, which cumulatively added $120 million to its total
written premium."


Thus, Berkshire is growing fast in CA workers compensation. Is that because prices are horrible currently? I
don't think so. Amtrust growing in CA is what one would like to see at current prices and not the other way
around.

http://bit.ly/1pbkiXk


31 Oct 2014, 06:11 PM


ddddr224234
Let's consider the Italian Med Mal Facts.


1. Amtrust wrote Italian Med Mal when pricing had improved significantly. 
2. Berkshire participating provides an additional data point that pricing was likely to be favorable. 
3. They were cautious and used Berkshire's balance sheet to do so with their 80% quote share arrangement. 
4. Berkshire wanted to continue the quota share arrangement with Amtrust.


How does that fact pattern change due to a broker dispute? The insurance broker in question wasn't remitting
part of the premiums Amtrust was owed and so they severed the relationship. Not sure why that negates the
premise that Amtrust was responsible in the way they approached the Italian Med Mal market.

Given the amount of premiums they have written in 2012, 2013, 2014 and will write in 2015 (more than 4-6x
levels written in years prior), the only real risk on the balance sheet is from these years.


As can be seen in the league tables below, it's clearly a good time to write workers compensation. The two
largest growers in the sector are Berkshire Hathaway and Amtrust. Both started at $250m a quarter in 2012
and both are more than twice that by 2014. Further, if you look at Berkshire's loss picks on that chart, they are
way lower than Amtrust's. This suggests that Amtrust is more likely to have a reserve cushion as opposed to
reserve hole as you posit.

Ullico has workers comp exposure, Ullico was taken into receivership...


Ergo??? What exactly is your implication?


Workers comp = receivership? That would be quite a logical leap. Or is this just more rhetorical fear
mongering?


Why do witches burn? [silence] What else burns? Wood! Why do witches float? Because... they're made of...
wood? She's a witch! Burn her!!!


From the article: Ullico's Casualty's problems arose in "non-core program business"... In addition to workers'
comp, Ullico Casualty also wrote fidelity/surety, fiduciary liability, professional liability, commercial auto and
commercial multi-peril. [Sounds like the problem wasn't in Workers' Comp...]


California Department of Insurance records show that Ullico Casualty controlled just over 1% of the California
workers' comp market...the states 29th largest writer of workers' comp policies.


Why don't you tell the tale of #'s 1-28? Or do they not fit your short thesis?

The point is that it is hard to build a business on workers compensation. Historically the loss ratio is over 100
percent.

Loss ratios in WC are not historically over 100%. The combined ratio (loss + expenses) is historically over
100% - but loss ratios are lower (say, mid-60s or less), though that may vary from state to state depending on

various circumstances. A insurer that runs a WC combined ratio as high as about 106-107 can generally
make money in WC (depending on average investment returns); an insurer that runs a WC loss ratio of 100
won't make money (unless *maybe* this is 1979-1982 and CD rates are 18% or higher).


Besides, it's easy to build a business on WC. Lots of companies have done it. It's hard to build a business on
WC if you're expanding rapidly and under-reserving, though - and given the lack of history AFSI has in writing
it, I doubt it has any idea what its true development history is. (No, using NCCI or even WCIRB data to
estimate it isn't necessarily suitable). If it's under-estimating what its tail factors are, that's a real problem -
and when it comes to the possibility that WC claimants won't get paid in full, state regulators don't take a
hands-off approach.


NOTE: This is not a statement on AFSI's financial position, simply a comment on WC pricing and reserving
and how it relates to an insurer's financial position in general.

those are not loss picks; they are incurred loss ratios, the ratios of paid plus case reserves to earned
premiums. they do not include ibnr. thus, i would be concerned that higher incurred loss ratios indicate poorer
or adverse experience. This would be the fact unless one adopts the assumption that one company is
establishing much stronger case reserves than another....this should be quite unlikely.

Why was Enron still rated a buy by most analysts in August, 2001 when the stock was in a freefall and it was
pretty clear the company was making up the financial statements? Pointing to "well, the analysts covering the
stock say _____" is a pretty poor way to validate a company's performance; even excluding Enron, there are
*numerous* examples where analysts who are supposed to know about a company issue opinions on the
stock's performance that badly lag what the stock has actually done (both up and down).

Here's a link to describe how Amtrust got into the "volatile" Italian Med Mal business. They had an 80% quote share
arrangement with Berkshire who clearly thought that prices in Italian Med Mal had risen and were attractive enough to
write this business.

They got into California workers compensation after prices had risen and players had already gone out of business.
As seen in the league table post above, they are writing business when it makes sense.

AFSI & MHLD are counterparts on an insurance deal (and related parties), but they have different amounts

Respectfully, stop lying about me and my work. It's not honorable and whatever your points are, they can be made
and should stand up without dragging us into it.


SO we are completely clear: neither Casey Nelson, nor Alistair Capital "funded" our work. That's flat out BS. I did my
own work, based on publicly released documents and longstanding public rules, and the Karfunkels have not
suggested a single item was wrong--no one has, actually.


In my story, I did note that one SIRF donor, GeoInvesting LLC, had written critically of AFSI--six months before I wrote
my report, which was about the brother's charities, and not AFSI. They didn't know the report was coming and I didn't
tell them. (FYI: A few weeks after the report was issued, they told me they hadn't been involved in AFSI securities in
months.)


And let me head you off at the pass before you start alleging some sinister conspiracy---neither SIRF or myself ever
wagers on or trades any security we write about or even mention, ever, and the same holds for the other board
members.


Again, SIRFs work, whether you like it or not, was based solely on publicly available documents, and the Karfunkels
were given every opportunity to participate.

Color me confused. I don't see any mentions of SIRF in the article or the comments prior to this. What is the
problematic reference to SIRF, and how does it relate to this Gotham post?


You also say SIRF doesn't wager or trade any securities, yet Gotham states he's short AFSI. Based on the
trading activity and timing, it sure seems like somebody's trying to profit from this.

User 448075 said that SIRF, in a previous comment, had admitted being funded by Alistair Capital or Casey
Nelson.

I replied that neither he nor his fund had--or have--anything to do with our funding, or even why we pursued
the story.


Conclude what you wish about price movements; we had nothing to do with it.


Hope that clears it up.

Incorrect. 
What I said, before it was censored by Seeking Alpha was that GeoInvesting is a funder/financial backer of
SIRF. This is not disputed, yes? GeoInvesting, Gotham, Casey Nelson/Alistair, Volsung et al have all been
part of the short ring syndicating short pieces on Amtrust for the past year+. Now, let the readers decide. Is it
a coincidence that SIRF writes a short piece on Amtrust, and is funded by GeoInvesting, but SIRF's
motivation/reason for writing the short piece had nothing to do with this funding relationship?

that's a big number and a big distraction of soft costs. Execution risk of many new deals in the pipeline. For
the longs on this blog that do not think there is any risk for trying to integrate this deals is short sighted but
that is their choice.

I have posted to the Stock Talk section of AFSI the KBW report out today on AmTrust for everyone's edification.

Everyone really should read the KBW article as it presents a nice counter point. It's up to each individual
which one they believe.

For my statutory capital calculation I included preferred stock and removed DAC (as well as goodwill, intangibles, and
non-LSC prepaid expenses).


For tangible book, I excluded preferred (since looking at common stock valuation), goodwill, and intangibles and
included the DAC & prepaid (to the extent that DAC and prepaid are not over-stated, I think one should include them
in the tangible book value).


Let me know if you disagree. Thanks.

The Statutory Capital Surplus was $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2014. For the NY DFS calculation of NWP:Surplus of
3:1, if one annualized the Amtrust Q2 2014 NWP of $923 mm, that would be approximately $3.7 b of NWP, and a ratio
of $3.7b/$2.2b or 1.68:1, which is far below 3:1. In fact they can write up to $6.6b NWP currently under the NY DFS
NWP:Surplus ratio, demonstrating that Amtrust has plenty of room to grow. 
Also, see my Instablog post under the StockTalk section for the complete transcript from the State of Maine hearing
on the ACP Re Tower transaction. If you read it, I think you will find it quite illuminating (I'll give you a hint, for those
not interested in reading all 138 pages, Amtrust demonstrates during their testimony what an exceptional company
they are, and what a deep management team they possess. Amtrust addresses to the complete satisfaction of the
Maine regulators questions regarding Life Settlement Contracts, Luxembourg, AII, Maiden, Surplus, and others.)

Author’s reply »  $2.2 billion is an unverifiable number.


AFSI has management said their year end 2013 statutory capital was $1.7 billion, but that is simply a sum of the
subsidiaries' statutory capital without adjusting for the stacking mentioned in my article. It also doesn't consider
whether US regulators would treat the life settlements as admitted assets.


I've read the full Maine transcript. AFSI asserts that the Luxembourg captives don't affect their consolidated amounts,
but they have never provided a reconciliation to counter the compelling evidence provided by GeoInvesting and
others.


Note that in the first excerpt below the CFO won't even say AII is well capitalized...he deflects and talks about
collateral rather than actual capitalization.


Stacking was not discussed in detail, but the second excerpt below demonstrates regulators are having a hard time
tracking AFSI's tangled web.


MR. UNGAR: 
AII is the ceding company.


MR. TURNEY: 
Is AII considered to be a well-capitalized company?

MR. PIPOLY: 
AII serves its role within our organization in that AII is really a private reinsurance within the AmTrust family.


Ninety-nine percent of the premium that AII writes is assumed from its affiliated domestic or European companies. So
it's not as if we market AII to write third-party risks.


Like I said, 99 percent of the business that AII writes comes from its 
2 affiliated companies.


I think when you look at AII's capital at the year-end of 445 million, the one thing that you can't lose sight of or that you
need to take into consideration is that AII in combination with Maiden, its special partner, provides over $2.7 billion of
collateral to its U.S. domestic affiliates.


So from the Schedule F purpose, obviously AmTrust International is not considered an organized reinsurer so it
needs to post collateral obviously in order to get Schedule F credit for the reinsurance. And it posts over $2.7 billion in
collateral to its domestic affiliates at year-end.


So when you consider AII as an entity that has $445 million, plus the backing of AFSI as a parent company, plus the
fact that you have $2.7 billion in collateral, we think AII is well-positioned to continue to be a quota share partner for its
domestic companies.


As I said, we have bolstered capital by an additional contribution of75 million.


And we certainly have made commitments and we've had discussions with the departments of insurance, the affiliated
receivables, albeit admitted assets under the standards, we will work to pay those down and certainly have credit
facilities and those things available at our disposal.


If we needed to pay them down quickly, we could do that if that's --


SUPERINTENDENT CIOPPA: 
Relative to your reinsurance program, most of it, if not exclusively, it seems to be internal. By internal, I know you
have three public companies, you have separate companies but it's -- there's a commonality there where most of your
reinsurance is.


At what point do you think the company will need to look for external capital?


Again, the classic example is -- you don't write this business but a hurricane has wiped out a lot of companies
because they didn't have enough external reinsurance or external capital that supported the business.


MR. PIPOLY: 
Our reinsurance structure -- now, Maiden is a 40 percent quota share. If you think about external excess of loss
reinsurance, that's really procured at the individual company level.


So let's use technology as an example. Our excessive loss workers' comp program, technology seeds to unaffiliated
third party reinsurers.


And then what is residually left after that excessive loss reinsured charge, that business would be subject to the
internal quota share and then ultimately subject to the Maiden quota share.

MR. TURNEY: 
Rockdale is owned by AmTrust Equity Solutions?


MR. PIPOLY: 
Yes.


MR. TURNEY: 
Which is owned by AII?


MR. PIPOLY: 
Ultimately.


There is an intermediary company in there called AmTrust International Management which owns AES.


MR. TURNEY: 
So Rockdale to AII ultimately?


MR. PIPOLY: 
Correct.


MR. TURNEY: 
It's owned indirectly by AII?


MR. PIPOLY: 
Correct.


MR. TURNEY: 
The other question I have relates to assets, and this can be directed at I guess all AmTrust companies.


It's very difficult for us to follow ownership of assets, particularly life settlement contracts.


I was trying to get at what was the aggregate purchase price of all of the AmTrust group companies life settlement
contracts? 
Do you know that offhand or


MR. PIPOLY: 
I know that the initial portfolio that we acquired in July of 2010, the purchase price of that portfolio was $13 million
which acquired face value life settlement contracts that aggregated to about $1.2 billion of face value. We have since
made additional purchases.


I would like the opportunity to get back to you in terms of breaking out the purchase prices of the additional


life settlement policies --

Where I was going with that question, if I look at the ACP Re financial statements, it looks to me like a contribution of
$1.5 million was made for 50 percent ownership in a company that invests in similar contracts?


MR. WEISSMANN: 
You're looking at last years financial statements.


MR. TURNEY: 
Oh. Oh, those contracts are no longer there

$2.2 billion in Statutory Capital verified on the conference call this morning at 7 AM EST by the company.
Please correct the Statutory Capital number you are using in your blog posts to reflect $2.2 billion. 
Thanks!

AFSI is up almost 4% - I'm surprised you haven't put on the next leg in this drama series intended to manipulate the
name to the downside. Or perhaps you'll wait until it reaches the next 52 week high first...

User 448075, 
Censorship? You clearly stated that Casey Nelson et al funded SIRF. That's what I replied to. Are you alleging that SA
changed your wording? Weird, if so.


GeoInvesting is a donor and has no discussions with us on capital markets issues of any stripe; we know nothing of
their work, and we do not discuss ours with them. While we are grateful for the support of anyone & everyone, they
are not among our most important donors, if that helps.


Most everyone else you named has had no contact with SIRF, i.e. VolSung, the author of these pieces et al.


SIRF wrote about the Karfunkels and their actions within a private foundation, clearly seeking to avoid a debate about
the value of $AFSI as an investment. If the stock starts rivaling $GOOG as a broader market bellweather, or it
becomes a penny stock, SIRF and I are indifferent.


But hey: Conspiracy! Halloween just passed and the world is always full of scary monsters that go bump in the night.
Trying to convince you we're not part of it is a fool's errand I can see. Life is so much easier, I'll acknowledge, when
enemies are arrayed against you. Too bad SIRF isn't one of yours.
