Kodak Doesn't Think Much Of UniBoss, So Why Should You?

When examining Uni-Pixel's (NASDAQ:UNXL) "manufacturing and supply" agreement
with Eastman Kodak (EKDKQ.PK), it's important to note there are two sides to every
transaction. On one side, it's clear that Uni-Pixel thinks the Kodak agreement is crucial to
its success and allows it to ramp UniBoss faster, cheaper and in greater quantities. On the
recent 1Q 2013 conference call, Uni-Pixel executives talked glowingly about the expertise
Kodak brings in "large scale manufacturing and commercialization." CEO Reed Killion
even went as far as to point out the explosive expansion opportunity with Kodak and laid
out a target for 10 million units of monthly capacity by the end of 2014.


It's also evident the agreement will provide significant economics to Kodak. On the
conference call, Reed Killion said, "The revenue share will be on equitable terms." If that
isn't explicit enough, the two underwriters of Uni-Pixel's recent primary offering, Cowen
and Craig Hallum, have both incorporated a 50-50 profit share with Kodak into their
financial models. In fact, Cowen has $59 million and $119 million of gross profit going to
Kodak in 2014 and 2015, respectively.


However, what does Eastman Kodak think? Let's examine Kodak's SEC and bankruptcy
filings. Unlike Uni-Pixel, which has never filed copies of its agreements with its PC OEM
customer, ecosystem partner, or manufacturing partner, Kodak actually appears to respect
its disclosure and filing requirements.


Kodak's filings set off alarm bells


It's clear Kodak doesn't think much of the Uni-Pixel agreement. In fact, Kodak didn't even
bother to file an 8-K announcing it. While Uni-Pixel wants investors to believe the Kodak
agreement will result in hundreds of millions of profit in the near future, it's extremely
telling that Kodak did not even think the agreement with Uni-Pixel was material enough to
file an 8-K.


What does Kodak consider to be material? A simple review of its 2013 filings makes clear
what Kodak considers material. On February 27, 2013, Kodak released an 8-K
announcing a license sale to the Kodak trademark for use in prescription lenses for $30.6
million (Signet license 8-K). Kodak considered a license sale for $30.6 million worthy
enough of an 8-K. If there was a realistic chance that over the next two years Kodak could
earn $178 million of gross profit, as forecast by the Cowen analyst covering Uni-Pixel,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1445991-kodak-doesnt-think-much-of-uniboss-so-why-should-you 2/12


Kodak would have filed an 8-K announcing the agreement. After all, Kodak seems to be
serious about its disclosure requirements, which mandate that an 8-K be filed for "material
definitive agreements entered into by a company that are not made in the ordinary course
of business" as per this SEC document description (Form 8-K Disclosure Requirements).


Let's also examine Kodak's Disclosure Statement that was filed with the bankruptcy court
on April 30, 2013, in which Kodak provides its most up to date financial projections.
Disclosure Statements are one of the most important documents in a bankruptcy
proceeding and no material information can be hidden from the courts. What struck us is
that there is not one single mention of Uni-Pixel or UniBoss within the Disclosure
Statement, even though it contains an extensive discussion of the Functional Printing
division. More importantly, there's been almost no change from its projections provided on
January 22, 2012. The Uni-Pixel agreement was signed on April 16, 2013; any material
addition would have been reflected in its Disclosure Statement filed April 30, 2013. See for
yourself.


The first projections are available on slide 12 from the January 2013 Presentation to
Creditors, which was filed as part of an 8-K on January 22, 2013. The second set of
projects is found on page 175 from the Kodak Disclosure Statement filed April 30, 2013.
As you can see, there is almost no change to the projections. The only difference is the
treatment of a divested segment in 2014 and 2015. In addition, it's important to note that
Kodak has regularly updated its financial projections with the most up to date information
(see filings from August 13, 2012 and October 12, 2012).


Where are the millions of future profits from Uni-Pixel? How come they're not in the new
Disclosure Statement? If UniBoss' profits are truly expected to be of the magnitude that
analysts project, Kodak must update its projected figures. Our only conclusion is that

Kodak believes the agreement with Uni-Pixel is unlikely to amount to anything.


There you have it. The silence from Kodak is deafening.


Disclosure: I am short UNXL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I really just don't get it.


Seth Shaw, you clearly are smart enough to analyze this transaction from Kodak's point of view, but why not just pick
up a phone, call Kodak, and ask them about Uni-Pixel?


If you do this, you will see that they are extremely enthusiastic about this partnership and believe that it is a major first
step as they rebrand themselves as a functional printing company.


Go to the facility in Rochester and speak with some of the engineers. Everybody is working 100% towards this
partnership.

All the same it raises an interesting question as to why Kodak has made almost no comment, and not a single
filing, about this agreement with UNXL. If we were dealing with a normal company this might not be such
grounds for a lot of suspicion but we're dealing with UNXL after all with a history of failure at launching new
products.


That means a lot of questions are in order.

I'm sure they are enthusiastic about taking money from Uni-Pixel. I would be with little to know downside
affect.


Now I haven't even looked at the contract, but isn't it something like a service related contract where Kodak
produces something that Uni -P wants, after Uni-P pays them?

Or...


Antonio M. Perez, Kodak’s chairman and chief executive officer, said: “This agreement with UniPixel is a major
advance for Kodak’s functional printing initiative…Functional printing is a key growth area for Commercial Imaging…
and Commercial Imaging is Kodak’s future. In UniPixel, we have linked-up with an innovative and effective partner,
and Kodak brings to the relationship proprietary technologies that enable printing systems to deposit materials on a
wide variety of substrates with a high degree of accuracy, precision, repeatability and speed. With this agreement, we
continue to execute on our strategy to develop a roadmap of offerings that answers the growing market need for
alternative touch sensor solutions.”

I read through the Kodak filings and while UNXL thought the agreement was material enough to file an 8-K on
Apr 16th Kodak apparently did not (they did file an 8-K on Apr 19th for a $210M deal with Brothers
Industries).


Considering how unforthcoming UNXL has been over the details of the deal with Kodak again it raises a lot of
suspicions as to why? You could almost suspect <gasp!> that there was some connection between the Kodak
announcement and the surprise announcement the very next day that UNXL was going to do a secondary
after all to raise more money (after promising they wouldn't need to).

I'm sure a lot of the $32 secondary buyers must be now wondering if they weren't had? The way these things
go these days it probably won't be long before we see the first class action certification filing.

Okay I'm gonna have to take a victory lap here for being the first SA poster to predict the secondary would

I agree with both Seth Shaw and Patent News articles. IMHO it has been further damaging to UNXL's credibility since
Reed Killian has chosen to NOT DISCLOSE the name of the "so called EOM-PC contract partner".  
I also agree that the class action lawsuits will be announced before the week is over and believe the stock will drop
10-20% more this week.

You can't sue a company unless it's not doing what it says it's doing. The factory is being setup. If it fails to
produce, now's when the trouble begins.


Why on earth would it already be announcing failure at this point is just too weird. If anything, ramp up should
take at least 3 to 4 months, no?

Green River Asset, Contributor
Because Kodak didn't file an 8-k and didn't change their financial projections means they don't think much of the
transaction? It takes a pretty vivid imagination to get from point A to point B in your argument. You also need to be
willing to ignore a lot of facts.


A) Kodak entered into the transaction. Would a company in bankruptcy proceedings waste time, money, and human
capital on something they thought was irrelevant?


B) Kodak's CEO called it a "major advance" for one of their most important businesses.


C) Kodak had to get the transaction approved by the bankruptcy judge. That bankruptcy judge isn't going to let Kodak
spend millions of creditor's dollars on an enterprise that isn't very important, or that doesn't have a good chance at
success.

D) Engineers and other Kodak employees with whom I and others have spoken think highly of the partnership's
prospects.


I can understand how you might come to the wrong conclusion if your nose is buried in bankruptcy filings and 8-ks,
and these constitute your main sources of information. However, if you talk with some people who are close to the
situation you'll hear that Kodak is extremely excited about the transaction - to the point that they believe it provides
the key avenue for future growth.

Author’s reply »  I did speak with people at Kodak. However, I didn't include this information because I didn't

continue to execute on our strategy to develop a roadmap of offerings that answers the growing market need for

UniPixel and Kodak have already begun to construct a state-of-the-art manufacturing and testing facility with nearly
100,000 square feet of manufacturing space for the UniBoss roll-to-roll printing and plating lines. In 2013, $24 million
will be allocated to improve and equip the facility, which includes the installation of two printing lines and 15 plating
lines. Located in Bldg. 326 of Kodak’s Eastman Business Park, a more than 1,000 acre technology center and
industrial complex, the site provides an established infrastructure for roll-to-roll manufacturing and offers significant
space for capacity expansion to meet the anticipated growth and demand for UniBoss touch sensors.


UniBoss offers the unique advantages of metal mesh touch sensors based on an additive, roll-to-roll, flexible
electronics process, as compared to the traditional subtractive ITO-based and subtractive ITO replacement-based
touch sensor solutions. These advantages include higher touch response and sensitivity, superior touch distinction,
better durability, lower power requirements and extensibility to many sizes and form factors.


As an additive manufacturing process, UniBoss is more efficient and sustainable, promising lower production costs
versus standard ITO-based touch technology, by way of lower material costs, fewer steps in the manufacturing
process and a more simplified supply chain.

Kodak is in BK and awaiting court approval to cancel it's common stock. IMO they have reason to hide value here,
and thus lack of 8-K is of ZERO surprise.

Any reader of this article should also keep in mind the scale of these companies. Kodak is HUGE, even after scaling
back in bankruptcy. For them, $178 million additional profit is a small part of any projections. For Uni-Pixel $178
million in additional profit is (get this - drumroll please) . . . . . . . . . . . .


$12/share in EPS !!!!  
Big change for a company that has not had a profit before last quarter.


So, yes, it is much more material to the tiny Uni-Pixel than it is to the huge Kodak. That does not mean it is not
meaningful to Kodak (above quotes from Kodak execs have already proven that point), but to Uni-Pixel the Kodak
agreement is a huge step forward to drive time-to-market and escalation of market share in the near term.

Would it be appropriate for a company in bankrupty to report future revenue when no major orders have yet been

Nice try Seth and thanks to GRA, CH, and Brian for tapping the nail on the head. Seth: You have evidently failed to
comprehend the Kodak CEO quote--posted prior to this message--and give it any weighted value. I am sure the
lawyers for Kodak advised them that no 8k was needed as no orders are in existance and no revs to report &, hence,
not material per SEC Regs. Further, Kodak is in BK proceedings and one would not want to be too aggressive about
touting large Future revs. Again, large Co. CEOs do not willy-nilly offer a huge quote to a tiny company and especially
one that is Publicly traded!

about Unipixel. Go to their Home page, and look at news releases going across the bottom of the screen. One is

Kodak stakeholders sure think the agreement is relevant:

They want a bigger piece of the Kodak pie because Uni-Pixel is on board.

great find. If the judge addresses this letter, it might go something like this: "If ifs were skiffs, we'd all be
boating."


interestingly, if you look at the chart from mid-April of Kodak bonds, they didn't really respond at all to the
prospect of having 1/2 of the gross margins from UniBoss. apparently Kodak bondholders didn't think
UniBoss was worth much.

I agree that this was an extreme longshot by the stakeholder to get anything out of the effort.


But you noting the lack of bond market response - this response was because these unsecured bondholders
will see none of that potential. And that is NOT (as you imply) because there is no potential - it is because the
restructured Kodak will see that potential --- not the current Kodak nor the current unsecured bondholders.
Which is the point of the letter - an attempt to change that.


And you and I, as well as the bond market, all agree that this longshot attempt has negligible chance of
success. But their chances being negligible reflects nothing on the magnitude of the potential as the
stakeholder attempted to document.

What sort of commercial printing does Kodak have in mind? I just started covering Kodak today and have yet to DD it
or research it's forward looking technology.
