Citron Presents the Most Comprehensive and Thoughtful Piece on 
Zillow Ever Published.  This is why this stock is going to $80 … then 
$50 … then right back to where it started the year … $30 per share.  








Everyone knows Zillow(NASDAQ:Z) is overpriced … but who cares?? 
 


The pivotal question every investor needs to ask is simple, but crucial:   
 





If its best days are still in front of them, patient shareholders could reap even more rewards.  But if the 
future is nothing more than a mirror of the past … watch out below!!!   
 


Instead of focusing on the past, this piece will look into the future of Zillow.  More importantly, Citron 
will expose the disturbing trends beneath this online real estate “Brand recognition”, and why the 


“Are Zillow’s Best Days Ahead of it, or Behind it?”
Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 2 of 12 
 


future does not look any brighter and how Wall Street has become completely blind to the obvious 
signs. 
 
We are not going to rehash the premise that we presented year, regarding their lack of appeal among 
their customer base, or their precarious position in the US residential real estate market.  Since our 
initial report, the stock has gone from $42 down to $25 to now $95 all while the financials have 
deteriorated but the rhetoric is at an all time high. 
 
Before we go into detail about the future, we must touch on the present. 
 


Most Recent Quarter: Complete Disaster -- No Other Way to Look

Beyond all the hyperbole and headlines that read “”Record this…” and “Record that… ” it’s still 
supposed to be a business.  The below chart shows all you have to know about last quarter.

How to Juice Revenues by 8 
Million in a Quarter?   Easy:  
Spend 13 million on Marketing!
Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 3 of 12 
 


Beyond missing estimates, Zillow spent more getting revenue than the revenue itself.  Is this a 
business?  Rascoff recently told the investors that housing has experienced a string of price increases 
spanning 17 consecutive months , yet this is what Zillow’s business model looks like in the best of 
times? This quarter’s results demonstrate neither scalability nor efficiency.  
 
No one on Wall Street has ever been able to rattle off the case for his company more eloquently and 
rapidly than CEO Rascoff.  He reminds us that there is a potential $6 billion “revenue pie” – the money 
realtors spend on advertising – and Zillow now garners only a smidgen of that.   Think of the potential!   
 
Even though the Zillow CEO talks about the huge percentage of total Real Estate marketing that Zillow 
doesn’t attract, there is so much wrong with this thinking.  To expose this, ask yourself “what 
happened to all of the spending on classified ads, music, and travel agents?”  Sometimes the internet 
just makes money flows disappear, and not transfer to a new collector. 





Zillow’s revenue does not come from advertising homes ... it comes from agents paying for leads to get 
buyers and sellers.  The advertising of homes is free on multiple sites, with no barrier to entry.  
 
The backside of these disturbing trends can be clearly seen in their last earnings report, in which they 
reported dramatically decreased margins.  We see that their revenue, net of sales and marketing, is 
almost at an all time low:

Zillow Operating 
Leverage : AWOL
Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 4 of 12 
 


The simple fact is that rapid-growth tech companies like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), OpenTable 
(OPEN), and LinkedIn (LNKD), all have something Zillow lacks: a high degree of operating leverage.  And 
they lack something Zillow depends on:  television commercials and a huge phone telesales room. 
 
Zillow fills no such compelling need; thus its revenue growth is obtained only with expenditures of 
more than 100% of that expanded revenue in ads and telesales.   It has been around for seven years, 
operating the same business model, and it has not made a meaningful profit over that timespan.  
Citron doesn’t see that changing any time soon.  
 
All the while, whenever given the opportunity Rascoff compares his company to LinkedIn.  He has 
actually said it so many times that he even got the Jim Cramer to put it in the same breath as LinkedIn.  
Well, people lie, numbers do not lie.  This is what the past 4 quarters have looked like for LinkedIn vs 
Zillow.

The Myth of Mindshare 
When asked about the quarter, management justifies its increased marketing spend by saying they are 
gaining Mindshare.  In a scene out of 1999, we are supposed to be wowed by clicks and visitors 
without discussing the obvious: 
 


None of this traffic is monetizable.   
 


 Zillow is #52 in Alexa’s “Most Visited Site” list (#53 and #56 
are actual porn sites….check for yourself on Alexa.)   As a 
Wall Street Journal article mused on Zillow, “It is a lot 
easier to buy clicks than to buy profits.”   





It’s “Real Estate Porn”

Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 5 of 12 
 





It’s really critical to understand that Zillow is referred to in many a media outlet as nothing more than 
“Real Estate Porn”.  When the Zestimate was unique, it was the only way for voyeurs to see a quick and 
dirty estimated price of their own house … and their neighbor’s.  That moat is now gone, as every real 
estate listing site now has an estimate tool. 
 


Note that, like most “adult sites”, Zillow doesn’t own its content.  Yet, adult sites don’t need expensive 
television commercials to maintain their spots on the popularity lists.  The moral of the story, which 
was well discovered during the 2000 Nasdaq crash, is that internet traffic does not make a 4.0 billion 
dollar company.  Traffic can translate into mindshare, but that does not translate into a viable business 
model.  
 


Are You a Zillow Investor?  Did you know this?? 
 


From all the ads, and the glowing pronouncements of Zillow’s CEO on Twitter and at every chance the 
media gives him, you’d think he was dominating his space.   Here is the single most shocking number in 
this entire report:    
 





That’s right, barely one out of eight Real Estate web page displays are Zillow’s….. the majority of Real 
Estate internet traffic it is dominated by individual realtor sites and local MLS listings … neither of 
which are going away.  
 
With all of this bad news, it is no surprise we see insider selling … but to this extent? 
  


Zillow accounts for only  13.5% of all real estate web traffic.

Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 6 of 12 
 


Insider Selling  
 





Zillow’s management takes every conceivable 
opportunity to insist that it is “firing on all 
cylinders” .  But at current run rates, it would 
take 35 years of EBITDA to catch up with the 
amount of insider selling!    This is not insider 
selling-- this has become insider pounding. 
 
Insiders have sold more in stock than the 
company has done in total revenue since 
IPO….Amazing 
 
 
 
 
 





So now that we have established that the current state of Zillow is 
not what management makes it out to be, does the future look any 
better?  NOT A CHANCE … IT’S MUCH WORSE. 
 
Before we prove our points about the future of Zillow, we will let the numbers prove our point.  The 
bulls will say that all of that bad news is in the first part of the report – it is just setting the company up 
for a better future…..NOT. 
 
In a set of statistics that no doubt will one day be studied in MBA programs throughout the country 
when discussing market bubbles, let’s look at what Zillow share price and earnings estimates have 
done this year.

compares:

2015 Consensus estimate 3.00 3.29 9.7% 


2016 Consensus estimate 4.00 4.90 22.5% 





The Customers Prove Citron’s Theory 
 


We start with the premise that 80% of the current revenue is from selling leads to real estate agents.   
 
In the National Realtors Association 2012 Technology Survey Report we find that 75% of Realtors 
participate on Facebook, and 70% in LinkedIn. 
 
86% say referrals and repeat business are by far the most important component of generating leads. 
 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/142768056/Realtor-Technology-Survey-Report-2013-05 
 
What is most interesting about this report, is that realtors and brokers consider Zillow, Realtor.com 
(MOVE.com) , and Trulia in the same basket, with no differentiation within the cohort.  The reason this 
is important is because real estate brokers are Zillow’s primary customers.  While Zillow might claim 
to have mindshare of Internet visitors, it does not have the mindshare of of its own primary revenue-
generator base. 
 


Zillow’s Most Important News of the Year:  and it Went Completely 
Unnoticed by Wall Street Analysts 
 


One of Zillow’s biggest Achilles Heels has been the inaccuracy of their listing data.  Somewhere 
between 17% and 19% of Zillow’s listings aren’t even listed for sale at any given time.  Listing data is 
their lifeline to users – on this content rides their credibility; it is their lifeline to their users. 
http://www.inman.com/2013/03/06/accuracy-zillow-trulia-listing-data-under-fire-again/  
 
Zillow’s had a solution.  They hired a MLS point man with over 30 years experience in the MLS business, 
to help Zillow forge key strategic relationships with the Realtors and their MLS organizations.  When he 
hired on, the PR quote was, in fact:

But in late July, with less than a year on the job, Mr. Bemis abruptly resigned.

What would happen if the head of Tesla battery technology said “we just can’t get a battery to power 
electric cars in the future”?  Or more on point, what if the head of Netflix content said, “We just can’t 
find a way to acquire content from networks or studios.”? 


 
This bad relationship with the MLS is most clearly shown in this one-minute video segment you must 
see for yourself!  
 


 
(Click to play) 








So Zillow is left with a company that will consistently disappoint on earnings as real estate information 
becomes open for everyone and real estate agents become more expert with social media and search 
engine optimization. 


 “we have no profits”  … “you are trying to get water out of a stone” 
-- Zillow CFO … pre IPO meeting with MLS leaders …  





 “I was frustrated with the lack of inroads we made in the MLS community.”  
 In discussing pushback from the industry, “Most MLSs didn’t see a great advantage in 
setting up direct data feeds”   


-- Bob Bemis, upon his departure from Zillow…  





 “Bob’s deep industry knowledge will help Zillow engage with brokerages and MLSs in a 
mutually beneficial way as we bring expanded communication and cooperation to our 
current and potential partners”   


-- Spencer Raskoff, comments on Bob Bemis joining Zillow…

Social Media Killing Zillow! 
 


Wall Street supporters and naysayers have spent hours and volumes analyzing and predicting the 
future of Zillow.  Yet, the major flaw in the business and why it is getting worse can be described in 9 
words?  These 8 words could have been the content of this full report.  They demonstrate why Zillow 
can never grow into this nosebleed multiple: 


“Can you recommend a good real estate agent?” 
 


Buying a home is the most momentous financial 
decision most Americans will ever make.  The 
process is overlaid with substantial emotional stress 
as well as the obvious financial considerations.  In 
the same decision, buyers and sellers are deciding 
where to raise their family, where their children will 
go to school, and where to put their assets.    
 
The internet economy has become increasingly 
review and referral based. Trusting your network is 
important, paid sponsorship on websites has 
become transparent.  The days of boiler rooms 
selling “top of page placement” in platinum and 
gold packages is a thing of the past….. it is sooooo 
2003.  But somehow, chatty CEO’s like Spencer 
Rascoff can still convince Wall Street that this model 


is not only relevant, but compelling enough to run up huge deficit spending to chase it.   
 
There is a reason why Facebook is $45 a share and Twitter just filed for an IPO.  People trust people 
they know.  Networking is important.  Realtors know it and investors should know it as well.
Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 10 of 12 
 


What’s with the Australians and Zillow? 
 


Just last week we noticed another 13G filer from Australia on Zillow. This one is James Packer of the 
Australian media mogul Packer family.  While we have great respect for the empire built by his father 
and the casino empire built by the younger Packer, we believe that Packer does not fully understand 
the Zillow dynamic for this one reason.   
 
Many Australians would like to compare Zillow to the REA Group, the leading listing portal in Australia.  
There is a MAJOR difference to say the least.  Australia does not have an MLS system and REA Group is 
the default search source for all homes in Australia.  Their site accounts for 61% of all real estate 
searches in Australia and generates revenue from sellers advertising their properties. That is why REA 


group spends 12% of revenue on sales and marketing, while Zillow spends over 70%. 
 
Buy side agents do not exist in Australia and typical real estate commission is 2%. 
 
It is the opinion of Citron that Australians are mistakenly regarding Zillow (and Trulia in the case of the 
other major filer) as the US version of highly profitable and dominant REA Group.  Unfortunately for 
them, this couldn’t be further from the truth.  Just because an apple is a fruit and an orange is a fruit 
they can still be as different as apples and oranges.  The only question is when they figure this out – 
while they still have a big profit in the stock, or after it starts evaporating … or have they figured it out 
already?
Citron Research on Zillow Sept 20, 2013 Page 11 of 12 
 


If not the REA Group than what exactly is Zillow? 
If you want to know what Zillow truly is, we refer to you a piece written a few months back on Glass 
Door from a former employee.  This is what you get for your $4 billion. 
 








“A Boiler Room by any other name, still smells as rotten...” 
Inside Sales Consultant (Former Employee) -- Irvine, CA 


 
I worked at Zillow full-time for less than a year 


Pros – Great benefits (Heath, Dental, 24 Hour Fitness membership- if I'd ever had time to go, stock 
options), plus "perks" to keep you perky like free espresso, coffee, Red Bull, Monster, sodas, and lunch 
catered once a week, plus once a month Happy Hours after work with apps and beer. Also, the company 
flew us to Seattle for the holiday party and put us up at the W hotel.  A few of the top Inside Sales 
Consultants DO actually earn a 6-figure income, and even with your base pay and hitting just quota, you 
can make a decent income. 


Cons – 11-12 hours days with lunch breaks severely frowned upon. Basically, if you take lunch, it's nearly 
impossible to hit your "call time" of 210 min per day- That's time spent TALKING on the phone- not 
counting dialing, ringing, etc. Can you say micromanagement?? I loved my job at Zillow for the first 2-3 
months I was there. I thought it was the best job ever. This seems to be the path of most Inside Sales 
Consultants. You are given praise and encouragement and low, manageable quotas during your 'ramping' 
period of your first 3 months. You literally "drink the Kool Aid" (or Red Bull, in this case) and think Zillow is 
the Best Place ever.  Then Reality sets in, as does the stress, micromanagement, constant stream of emails 
about your talk time being too low. If you enjoy receiving 300 emails per day asking what you are going to 
sell, telling you to join the next of a never ending stream of call "blitzes," this may be the job for you. Still, I 
think 6-9 months seems to be the threshold for about 85% of people, hence the turnover rate. This is a 
HIGH burnout job.   If you are looking at working for Zillow and not reading many reviews like this, 
consider this: I recently quit my position to take another job. Several people I that started in my training 
class have been let go. (Actually from my class of 18, only 3 now remain.) I recently learned that when 
they are let go for not meeting quota, they are offered a severance pay in return for signing an agreement 
to not post anything negative online about the company. It seems they are buying the silence of anyone 
who might say anything non-positive about working there. I signed no such agreement. Just thought you 
should know this if considering taking the position.

Conclusion 


What is most amazing is that with this multiple and euphoria in the market, you would think that Zillow 
has something unique.  But at the end of the day, they are a listing portal with nothing unique or 
proprietary they own.  Yes, they have built a strong brand, and their $50 mil acquisition of Street Easy 
was impressive to Wall Street analysts, because it is so New York centric.   


Yet, they operate a business without a moat.  The Zestimate in no longer unique to them and they are 
nowhere with regard to becoming a leader in rentals or mortgage.  Just read any real estate website 
and see the stream of news that comes out on the many competitors of Zillow.  We know the truth, 
management obviously knows the truth (obvious through amount of insider selling) now you know the 
truth.
