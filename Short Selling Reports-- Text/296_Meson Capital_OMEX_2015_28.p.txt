Summary


"Lawyers representing Her Majesty’s Government are awaiting service of
proceedings from an individual who is seeking a Judicial Review of the Secretary of
State’s decision.".


This Judicial Review is an additional and possibly fatal hurdle to the project on top of
the numerous other issues we highlighted when the project was announced 3
months ago.


This Thursday 4:30pm, the UK Parliament will hear Kevan Jones scrutinize why the
project was awarded to OMEX, the first time it has been raised to this level of
transparency.


MAKO Warrants appear to have expired worthless Dec 31, 2014 - OMEX today
estimated to have nearly ZERO liquidity vs ~$30mm debt + payables; SSCA in
court; SEMARNAT suspended Oceanica.


Jan 8th OMEX insiders granted themselves a huge 5.4mm stock incentive plan.


An article was published in the UK today highlighting an impending judicial review of
Odyssey Marine Exploration's (NASDAQ:OMEX) Announced HMS Victory Project:


VICTORY 1744 PROJECT FACES JUDICIAL REVIEW


The confirmation of the legal moves came when a spokesperson for the MoD told
thePipeLine that it would not be appropriate to comment on certain aspects of the
HMS Victory 1744 controversy because "Lawyers representing Her Majesty's
Government are awaiting service of proceedings from an individual who is seeking a
Judicial Review of the Secretary of State's decision.


A judicial review is effectively asking the courts to investigate the propriety of actions
taken by the government - in this case the Ministry of Defense's (MOD) award of the HMS
Victory to the MHF/OMEX. The first step is for someone to seek permission from the judge
after serving the other side notice. Then it would be filed with the courts and await a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2854086-odysseys-hms-victory-faces-judicial-review-insiders-get-big-stock-incentive-plan 2/13


hearing where a judge will decide if there is merit to the review or not. The process will at
a minimum shine serious bright light on the decisions made by the MOD in their award:
was their proper due diligence done? Is OMEX financially capable of completing the work?
Were there any improprieties in the bidding process? etc. Ultimately it seems like it will
certainly add a great deal of time and expense to the process if the judge approves it and
at worst case possibly reverse the grant altogether. At a minimum, it will have to clarify the
still vague language that the OMEX Bulls are hanging onto that OMEX will be able to sell
the 'trade goods' and other personal artifacts that some are arguing fall outside the deed
of gift, despite that appearing to be in contradiction to the UNESCO Annex and UK
Museum Code as we elaborated on previously.


After the Nov 7th letter officially warning OMEX for 4 infractions at the HMS Victory site
(which we formally uncovered using the UK Freedom of Information Act), OMEX seems to
be having a slow time getting the MMO license required to revisit the Victory site.


The UK Marine Management Organisation, which regulates the offshore industry
and seabed works including intrusive maritime archaeology, has also confirmed that
the Maritime Heritage Foundation submitted a licence application for the HMS
Victory wreck site on 19 December and that the MMO is currently verifying the
application prior to launching the statutory public consultation regarding the
application.


Additionally - look out for Thursday afternoon where the project and its questionable
award to OMEX will be scrutinized critically by former defence minister Kevan Jones. To
date the project has come as far as it has by avoiding greater transparency, but for the
first time the spotlight will be bright and the backroom dealings of Lord Lingfield (who had
falsely claimed to be a descendant of Admiral Balchen of the HMS Victory) that led to the
MOD awarding the project to OMEX will be heavily scrutinized. With a general UK election
in the coming months, political favors for insiders will not be viewed favorably.


We previously published a detailed review of the overall HMS Victory project shortly after it
was announced, including this graphical summary. Note that after over 3 months since
OMEX's initial announcement of this, on Oct 24, 2014, the project has STILL not even
moved past the FIRST hurdle of getting the MMO to approve the project plan. Indeed, this
potential judicial review now announced is an ADDITIONAL and possibly fatal hurdle that
we didn't even originally conceive!

"It is also pointed out that in 2013-2014 the MHF spent just £495 on its charitable
activities. However, in spite of this Lord Lingfield's charity has been given the go
ahead to undertake the work on the HMS Victory wreck site thus committing it to a
spend of many millions of pounds." - From the UK Article


It appears to our analysis that it is inconceivable that a completion bond (UNESCO Annex
18) could have been posted for this project given OMEX's perilous liquidity and rapid cash
burn.


"A controversy of this kind, particularly when it involves a close associate of the main
Party of Government allegedly seeking permissions which will allow for the
commercial exploitation of the grave and memorial to 1100 lost Royal Navy mariners
and even the sale for profit of their personal effects by a foreign based company, will
not be welcomed barely a hundred days from what will be a bitter and closely fought,
General Election." - From the UK Article


Stay tuned in the coming week for the update from UK Parliament which will be made
public and is privileged content as part of government proceedings.


"Black Swan" Disaster Redux?

This latest tangle with the HMS Victory certainly is reminiscent of the "Black Swan" /
Nuestra Señora de Las Mercedes case with Spain that ended just a couple years ago.


A recent article last week went into depth behind the scenes of the Black Swan case and
how OMEX hid the incriminating truth from the court in Gibraltar before a Spanish lawyer
personally had to go and seize the coins. Quote from article about the Black Swan:


Odyssey had kept the coins and other objects hidden in Gibraltar because they
could have lent proof to the fact that the treasure hoard came from the Mercedes.
"That is the real reason why they kept them under wraps; not because of their
value," said Elisa de Cabo, deputy director of the Protection of Historic Heritage
bureau at the Education and Culture Ministry.


From the UK article referring to the court battle on that case:


The US Courts found for the Government of Spain at every stage of the process up
to and including the US Supreme Court. The salvage company also suffered huge
reputational damage as Judge Stephen D Merryday castigated Odyssey finding that
" Odyssey's persistent denial and feigned uncertainty about the existence and
identity of the wrecked vessel was a demonstrably purposeful and bad faith litigation
posture effected from the beginning of this action to deflect, delay, and if possible,
defeat (or, at least, compromise) Spain's rightful claim." In a damning summary
Judge Merryday added


" Odyssey went where it went because it knew full well where to go; Odyssey found
what it found because it knew full well what it was looking for; Odyssey withheld and
deceived and deflected with respect to what it found because Odyssey knew full well
why Spain was asking and knew full well the adverse consequence to Odyssey's
financial aspirations if Spain discovered the answer. To come to court and deny the
truth of these facts is, as stated earlier, an unacceptable enormity propounded and
maintained in bad faith and for an improper purpose."


As a result Judge Merryday ordered Odyssey pay Spain costs of $1,072,979 million
and to return the bullion and all other finds taken from the ship "contrary to Law" to
Spain.

1) SS Central America monetization is still tied up in appeals court and there has been no
update on the court docket since December 8th.


2) Oceanica is still suspended pending more information with SEMARNAT - has been
since Nov 25th. If the questions are easy and don't require detailed further studies, why do
they take 2+ months to answer?


3) MAKO warrants appear to have expired worthless Dec 31, 2014 as there was no 8-K
announcing their exercise. We believe the company has failed to file appropriate
disclosure around this: What happened to Mako?


Nov 11, 2014: Company's most recent 10-Q [emphasis mine]


In 2014, we are seeking to monetize a portion of our stake in our mineral
exploration shareholdings [referring to Oceanica], recover and monetize cargo
from the SS Central America, and generate cash inflows from other projects and
opportunities. If cash inflow is not sufficient to meet our desired projected business
plan requirements, we will be required to follow our contingency business plan which
is based on curtailed expenses and requires less cash inflows. We may also have to
revert to capital raises that include equity and/or convertible debt to allow us to
continue as a going concern. Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at
September 30, 2014 was $3.7 million which is insufficient to support
operations through the end of the year.


...


An option to purchase an additional one million shares was exercised by Mako on
December 30, 2013 for a total amount of $2.5 million. The option exercise expiration
date for the remaining six million shares was extended until December 31, 2014


On the most recent Nov 10 conference call at minute 34-36 (there does not appear to be a
transcript of this one), CEO Mark Gordon said, responding to a question about the liquidity
scenario of the company (given their own SEC filings say they do not have cash sufficient
for the year): "Various ways capital can come into the business: … There are still 6 million
warrants from our Mako sale, $20mm cash…"


The company has failed to disclose what happened with the $20mm of Mako Warrants
that they updated shareholders with an 8K a year ago. Given the market cap of $80mm
this is clearly material whether they were exercised or not.

Management grants themselves huge stock incentive plan without shareholder
approval


With no updates to shareholders for nearly 3 months now, all of their major projects
appearing to hit huge roadblocks (some even unanticipated by critics), on January 8th,
OMEX management decided to grant themselves a huge dilutive stock incentive plan for
up to 5.4 million shares.


Originally for the June 2014 AGM, OMEX tried to seek approval for a 5.0mm share
incentive plan on their proxy but then mysteriously amended the proxy a month later
removing the proposal - were shareholders upset about the idea of voting to grant
management big dilutive share grants?


Do shareholders think they deserve this extra compensation in addition to their substantial
cash compensation? Maybe management knows the answer and that is why they didn't
even ask shareholders for approval?


All this adds up to a very perilous liquidity situation where we can't model the company
making it through the next month without a dilutive equity raise or filing bankruptcy, let
alone the 3-4 months until the HMS Victory can even commence recovery.


OMEX has avoided a liquidity crisis to date by 1) borrowing on its $10mm "marketing loan"
with what appears to be the California Gold Marketing Group, the original buyer of the SS
Central America coin collection and 2) By stretching its payables and accrued expenses
(i.e. paying its bills slower). The payables surprisingly have not reverted to their normal
seasonal low - chart over the last 3 years:

Today, unlike 6 months ago where there were still assets without debt tied to them, all of
OMEX's assets are encumbered by debt due to the $10mm 'marketing loan'. Where can
they go from here? We should know very shortly as even under optimistic assumptions
cash will run out imminently and bills need to be paid.

"please name a single incorrect thing in the article"


Well, for starters, you state that the Victory project faces judicial review, but you have no proof of that. All you have is
an article posted by a deranged omex-hater who says that someone is "seeking" a Judicial Review.


There's a difference right? To illustrate: "Ryan Morris is facing criminal charges in Mexico." This is not equivalent to,
"Criminal Charges are sought against Ryan Morris."


Also, you've repeatedly brought up the Unesco annex and you've repeatedly told us that the UK must adhere to the
annex because it is a signatory. Yet you have still to provide any sort of proof of this.

The 8k, filed on January 2nd, specifies grants of approximately 2.6 million shares, not the 5.4 million you
state. 5.4 million shares may be issued eventually under the plan.


They didn't grant themselves up to 5.4 million shares. They granted 2.6 million. More stock can be issued
under the plan but it will only be granted with Board approval.

How do you reconcile your assertion regarding Victory above that “There is NO “lottery ticket upside”
anymore” with the below quote from the article that you have used to highlight the prospects of a Judicial
Review:


“Indeed, neither the Ministry of Defence , nor the Maritime Heritage Foundation have contradicted claims
made in the United States and verified as credible by UK based experts in Maritime Law, that the terms of the
MOD permission, backed up by the wording of recent written parliamentary answers, makes it possible for
Odyssey to claim salvaged items which did not belong to the Crown, such as the personal possessions of the
1100 lost crewmen and dispose of them as it wishes, including by commercial sale or auction…”


Out of one side of your mouth you tell readers that OMEX is not allowed to sell trade goods recovered from
the Victory under the annex. Out of the other side of your mouth you cite a potential judicial review that
appears to be focused upon the prospect that OMEX will be allowed to sell trade goods under terms of its
agreement with MHF.


Since you have yet to provide proof that OMEX cannot sell trade goods, and since the potential sale of trade
goods worries “UK based experts in Maritime Law” enough to spark a Judicial Review request, then your
audience must assume that your original premise that OMEX has somehow given up its “lottery ticket upside”
is completely false.

Let me get this straight, RYAN. You state they gave themselves 5 million shares or so. So before the
shareholders vote to approve or disprove,you claim it is a done deal and that they all now hold those shares.
Which is dilutive to current shareholders. 
Let us ask this? What is a stock incentive program? And how or when are shares dispensed to officers? 
Can you answer that Ryan?

Just like in the USA anyone is free to file court papers. The seriousness of an individual calling for a judicial review of

of it changing anything are about the same as one of us filing some papers to turn Yellowstone National Park into a

Repeatedly Morris states that the selection of OMEX to recover HMS Victory is "questionable" decision, lacking
transparency, etc. This is an exaggeration.


OMEX actually found the HMS Victory and put the most time and expertise on the project.


Didn't the MHF hire OMEX as an exclusive contractor? Isn't the MHF/OMEX effort being led by Margaret Rule, the
famed British archeologist who recovered the Mary Rose? Google "Mary Rose Museum" to get a look at the sort
serious resources the UK puts into shipwreck recovery. Its reasonable to assume that similar treatment is being
considered for the HMS Victory.


Ryan Morris puts the bum's rush into any incipient and ongoing program at OMEX, advertising worst case scenarios
as if they are accomplished facts.


OMEX for its part carries the baggage of Black Swan, lending credence to Morris's words. Indeed, how can any short
resist repeating that unfavorable ruling as perspective on future events? Yet the Black Swan taught a lesson to
OMEX, one that they are unlikely to repeat (i.e. going ahead in any recovery without complete official enthusiasm for

statements and announcements, creating an even more thriving environment for Morris's brand of pessimistic
speculation.

U.S. Marshals tracked Tommy Thompson to a Hilton Hotel on Glades Road in West Boca Raton on Tuesday.


Thompson has been the subject of an international manhunt since he didn't appear for a court hearing in 2012.


U.S. Marshals used his image on billboards in Florida and Ohio in an effort to locate him.

Still no approval on even the MMO permit.


Hansard source 
(Citation: HC Deb, 10 July 2017, cW)


Kevan Jones Labour, North Durham 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whether the licence application currently
lodged with the Marine Management Organisation by the Maritime Heritage Foundation is fully compliant with the
UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.


Therese Coffey The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) licences the removal of substances or objects from the sea bed within
the UK marine licensing area, under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.


I can confirm that an application for a marine licence has been lodged with the MMO to recover items from HMS
Victory 1744. However, the MMO has not concluded its determination of that application and the issues raised by it.


It should be noted that although Her Majesty’s Government is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of
Underwater Cultural Heritage, it has adopted the Rules for activities directed at underwater cultural heritage, found in
the Annex of the Convention, as best practice. As such any recovery of items from HMS Victory will need to comply
with relevant UK polices that align with these requirements.


MMO will consider the application in that context and in accordance with the relevant Government policy on the issue.
