China Natural Gas Again Delays its LNG Production Prompting
Downgrade

China Natural Gas's (OTC:CHNG) long delayed new LNG facility appears to be further
delayed, according to a note out today by analysts who visited the plant on January 25th.
Roth Capital as a result downgraded CHNG to "Sell" and cut their price target to $4.50, or
6X their $0.76 FY11 EPS estimate. Roth estimated an additional 2-3 quarter delays in
LNG production as well as the fact CHNG has not secured any major customers as
reasons for their downgrade, noting that the project is at least 18 months behind schedule.


Incredibly, CHNG management has not issued any press release to announce the
significant additional delay to its LNG production. In fact as recently as December 1, 2010,
CHNG stated in a press release (here) announcing a supply agreement for its LNG plant
that it expected to complete Phase I of the plant before the end of the year. 


Since that press release, there have been more significant signs of trouble with CHNG's
governance: On December 23, 2010, CHNG disclosed in an 8-K its CFO, David She, had
been replaced by Shaocheng "Bode" Xu. Then on December 6, 2010, CHNG disclosed in
an 8-K it had replaced its auditor, Frazer Frost, LLP with Friedman LLP. 


In addition, on November 25th, 2010, CHNG disclosed in an 8-K that independent director
Carl Yeung had resigned.

I first wrote about CHNG on September 8, 2010, after the company announced it had
hired Ernst & Young to help improve internal controls. As I pointed out (here), CHNG failed
to explain that this was the second time they had hired E&Y to work on their internal
controls, the lack of which had previously resulted in up to $20 million undisclosed related
party payments to a company owned by its Chairman for its Lingbao acquisition, $14
million in loans to 3rd parties to "help" the company obtain government approval to
expand its LNG business (ever heard of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?), and most
recently $17 million undisclosed borrowing by Chairman Qi Jinan for who knows what.


After an initial jump from $5 to $7 on the misleading press release, CHNG shares skid
right back to the $5’s where they have remained, more or less, ever since.


I will simply repeat my conclusion from September: When management has repeatedly
shown they do not value shareholders no amount of remediation, even from an expensive
Big 4 firm, will make any difference. Roth Capital by cutting CHNG to a "Sell" seems to be
catching on.


Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours.

Utter rubbish....


Alfred Little is a shorter, for sure he is shorting, making stuff up, and also stretching the truth by a long shot.


Alfred Little and waldo are the prostitutes of the internet and shorting and bashing stocks, how anyone could try to
make a living by scaring people out of there stocks should be against the law.


They take a fact but make it sound alot worse than it is.


Stretch truths and at times make things up even, take a truth and turn it into something far worse, or something hardly
related and trying to relate it.

Ask yourself this question, would Alfred Little spend so much time and effort writing articles if he was not shorting?


Just read Alfred Little last 20 articles, it is all about running companies down, stretching truths, and trying to scare
people.


Alfred Little and waldo should be banned from seeking alpha...


I asked several people about CHNG, wanting there idea;s, seems everyone has a different idea.


Good luck with your shorts Alfred Little....

China TechFaith Rewarded!

Yesterday China TechFaith (CNTF) hit $4, up 25% in just over a month since I mentioned it. This market is very frothy
so I am likely to sell my position at these levels or higher. Meanwhile I am getting lots of new ideas for short sales.
Stay tuned!

I am not familiar enough with CHNG to comment about Mr. Little's conclusions but I am getting familiar
enough with the writings of Mr. Little to comment about his character.


Do not put Mr. Little's character in the same bag with Waldo Mushman's. So far I have not seen Mr. Little use
a single outlier number (inventory turnaround ) or misleading documents (Chinese patent searches) results to
support his arguments. Mr. Little's numbers tend to be correct, his facts tend to be real facts. Also, he seems
to work on both sides: long and short. Nothing wrong with that, and nothing wrong with pointing out facts -
even when they might hurt your or my wallet.

I'm long and staying long until I'm stopped out. Solid and profitable company. A steal @ $5.

Author’s reply »  I would not describe CHNG as "solid" (5, or is it 6 CFOs now?) or particularly "profitable", certainly
nowhere near the numbers they report. I doubt the LNG plant ever makes CHNG one cent.

Regardless of the LNG delayed (which I believe it is not going to be a long delay, technically, there are a lot of efford
for this developing contry to put up this high tech. construction), this company is still functioning and operating and
generating revenue. As long as it has profit, with the nature of the business (natural gas) in the Chinese market with
demands on automobiles and other industries growing exponentially, the growth of CHNG in China is still significant
and cannot be undervalued unless there are more competitors raising to compete with it, the current economy and
market condition in China are going to keep this company thriving unless there are more competition or the
management team is really substandard.

Here a link to the CHNG website showing beautiful photos of the newly constructed plant and Mr Ji taking guests on a
tour of it. It is a nice looking facility. I own some shares bought recently at $5.18 and $5.20. It looks to have a good
valuation. The PEG ratio has been below 1 quite a lot, and the debt used to be around zero, but is up some with
aquisiitions and improvements that have taken place in recent years.

There are links at the top of the China Natural Gas home page that have a lot of info about the different parts of their
operation, as well as a lot of photos. There are even photos of government documents showing approvals and
agreements for various projects.

they operate pipelines so there is a fixed cash flow; they have near to no debts 
somebody can be short on this for some time of course (in the last months the attacks to Chinese reverse mergers
abound) but not forever. I believe a small position in this won't be a bad idea - it does not look certainly expensive
right now...  
Of course better behavior/communication from management will improve things for stock holders..
