Will Unilife Price Its Potential Secondary Above $3.50?
Dec. 19, 2013 9:00 AM ET31 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Over the past month, there has been a heated debate on Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS)
between longs and shorts. Ten articles have been PUBLISHED on Seeking Alpha, and
additional commentary has been written on a variety of sites like
thefocusedstocktrader.com on the long side, and thestreetsweeper.org on the short side.


Shorts have pointed out a decade-long track record of futility and shareholder value
destruction, a long history of promotional contract announcements that yield negligible
revenue, massive ongoing dilution and a crowded competitive landscape dominated by
multibillion-dollar competitors. The long thesis, in contrast, has been relatively devoid of
compelling fundamental arguments. Instead, longs have highlighted how the stock has
"popped out of a wedge" and that the CEO boasts about "sitting with a hand of aces," as if
highly inconclusive contract announcements will attract investors despite Unilife's
numerous precedents of much-heralded customer signings ultimately leading to
inconsequential revenue. Stock promotion can only last so long, and history has shown
that when informed short sellers spar against day trading stock promoters, the short
sellers typically win out, relatively quickly. At some point, sending a thousand tweets to
one's 130 followers stops having an impact.


We doubt that many investors are long UNIS because they believe in Unilife's long-term
business viability. Rather, the long thesis is premised on the success of the stock
promotion. If the promoters can successfully flood the internet with sound bites about
Royal Flushes with a liberal helping of the caps lock key, enough momentum traders can
pile in to drive the stock price up and into the hands of greater fools. Longs think that the
active stock promotion will continue over the near future, because there is a clear and
obvious reason for why it's occurring: Unilife is running out of cash and needs to do a
secondary offering soon.


Unilife's "At-the-Money" Agreement Provides Minimal Liquidity


Even after accounting for the $10m of upfront proceeds from the Hikma and Sanofi
announcements, Unilife is nearly out of cash. Cash and short-term investments were $7.4
million on September 30th, 2013 compared to an annual cash burn that has exceeded $40
million in each of the past two years. Given this burn rate, Unilife likely consumed its

Hikma and Sanofi cash during the current fiscal quarter. This could again leave the
business with ~$5m of cash by year-end. Making matters worse, Unilife must pay one of
its equipment suppliers $4.8m, as announced on November 27th.


Unilife's proponents take solace in a $45m at-the-money ("ATM") share sale authorization
struck in October 2012. However, UNIS had just $19.2m of remaining capacity as of
September 30th, 2013 (UNIS 10Q3 2013). This provides Unilife with less than six months
of additional liquidity, much lower than that implied by the full authorization. Given the dire
cash balance one might expect at year-end, we expect that Unilife has already begun
drawing on its remaining $19m of ATM capacity.


In preparation for these potential secondary sales, Unilife has been busy trumpeting deals
to support its share price. On a recent conference call, Unilife confirmed that it employed
deal announcements as a means to pump its share price before secondary offerings: "The
only reason we would do it and not have done a secondary offering either on the back of
the Sanofi deal or the back of the MedImmune deal was simply because of our confidence
of the deals that are in process..." (Q1 F2014 Call).


Unilife Shares Fell 30% after the October 2012 ATM Announcement


While long investors currently view the ATM arrangement as beneficial, the immediate
reaction to the October 2012 announcement was wretched. Originally reported on October
4th, 2012, the $45m Cantor Fitzgerald-led secondary authorization resulted in a violent
32% pullback in the stock. Unilife investors, long yearning for legitimate profitability to
replace share sales, quickly capitulated after the announcement. Even though the ATM
resulted in no immediate share sales or dilution, the mere hint of further secondaries
shook investor confidence.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1906871-will-unilife-price-its-potential-secondary-above-3_50 3/15


Following this precipitous decline, Unilife was quick to reassure investors that it had no
intention of actually exercising its ATM rights, "we have not drawn down this facility nor do
we have any immediate plans to do so... The main reason that we put the ATM in place,
that was to strengthen our position at the negotiation table" (Q1 F2013 Call). And yet, just
one year later, Unilife has exercised 60% of the original ATM agreement.


While the long case hinges on further price spikes precipitated by Unilife's 'aces,' Unilife's
long history suggests that rapid declines, like that shown above, are much more likely.


How Will the Market React to Future Secondary Offerings?


Knowing that violent price corrections could occur if liquidity becomes a concern, Unilife
will probably seek a new fundraising vehicle well before its current ATM capacity expires.
Should it choose a second at-the-money facility, the market could have a similar reaction
as it did in early October 2012. If they wish to avoid this, Unilife will instead choose to
implement an underwritten, fixed-price offering.


Unilife's past three underwritten offerings were launched at substantial discounts to the
current market price. The 2011 and 2012 secondaries were offered at an average of an
11% discount. Not content with a straight-forward discount, Unilife's February 2013
offering called for a warrant grant alongside the common stock issuance. For every three
shares purchased in this offering, subscribers received a free warrant with a strike price of
$3.00.


As would be expected, underwriters are actively competing with one another to win a
potential secondary mandate. Cantor Fitzgerald released bullish commentary and price
target upgrades on December 3rd, just in time for a holiday season secondary offering
before the bankers' bonus season. Jefferies, the co-manager of Unilife's follow-on offering
in November 2011, followed suit on the same day, boosting its own price target. We wish
both underwriters the best of luck in their gripping race to win the UNIS placement
mandate -- may the most bullish analyst win!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1906871-will-unilife-price-its-potential-secondary-above-3_50 4/15


Given that UNIS is running out of cash, underwriters are gushing about highly inconclusive
contract announcements, and stock promoters are intensifying their use of exclamation
points and poker references, it's clear that a stock offering is on the horizon.


So that begs the question: how large a discount to the current share price will the offering
be priced at? While prior offerings have been struck at less than a 10% discount, we think
that the ultimate deal price for Unilife's next secondary will be at a much larger markdown
to today's ~$4.20-ish trading level. Unlike prior times, Unilife is facing a barrage of heavy
criticism from legions of savvy short sellers. In addition to our earlier short-biased report,
Unilife has been subject to scathing censure from StreetSweeper, Rick Pearson, Adam
Gefvert, and Forbes, to name a few. The company's lengthy history as a public company
in both the United States and Australia, as well as Shortall's well-documented background
as a seasoned executive at a variety of business failures, have provided plenty of fodder
for short theses.


Any institutional investor considering a future follow-on offering will likely be well aware of
the heaps of negative commentary being currently directed at the company. Such an
investor must be willing to pick a fight with a multitude of reputable activist short sellers.
We're not sure there are many that want to become involved in that sort of situation,
unless they can invest at a wide discount to the current trading price.


Furthermore, these investors will probably be aware that once a deal gets done, the stock
promotion is probably going to abate until the company is back in the market to raise more
capital. In contrast, the short sellers will be as incentivized as ever to continue sharing
diligence regarding the company's lack of business viability.


The result will be that institutional investors considering a fixed-price secondary offering
will likely request a steep discount to the latest trading price. Recognizing the high risk that
UNIS might break the deal price, we could see a discount of 20% or more. In turn,
underwriters want to maintain constructive relationships with their institutional clients. If
they price a deal at too high an offering price, and investors get burned by poor trading
after the secondary, the underwriters' reputations will be damaged in the marketplace.
Investors will be less likely to subscribe to their deals in the future. As such, placement
agents are incentivized to price a deal at a sufficient discount that their investors will turn a
profit, at the expense of current shareholders who are becoming materially diluted.


A discount of 20% could imply an offering price as low as $3.50. At $3.50, UNIS would be
valued at a $350m+ market capitalization, which we think is still wildly overvalued. We
wrote in our earlier article that the company is probably worth less than $100m.

Investors Beginning to Show Indifference to Increasingly Vague Agreements


After reporting its much-hyped Hikma agreement on November 20th, momentum-oriented
investors have clung to the belief that additional announcements will continue to drive
Unilife's share price higher. But Unilife's more recent announcements indicate that the
strength of these 'aces' is quickly decaying. The December 2nd, 2013 Novartis report
appears to be regurgitating a November 2011 agreement with a "Global Pharmaceutical
Company." Furthermore, the Novartis agreement failed to disclose milestone payments,
revenue targets, or production minimums. This lack of detail is surprising in view of
Unilife's promotional style and willingness to broadcast financial details if they existed.


The superficial announcements continued on December 16th with a press release
concerning an ocular drug delivery system. Once again, Unilife failed to disclose any
substantial details related to the deal's profitability. Even more concerning for Unilife
believers, the report completely failed to drive UNIS's share price higher. The meager
0.9% gain indicates that the marginal impact from Unilife's announcements is rapidly
falling. Without this 'catalyst' of deal announcements to drive the share price higher, the
basis for the momentum-driven long thesis begins to break down. And once these
momentum investors begin their exit, the market will shift its attention to the underlying
economics of Unilife's deals. The company's unwillingness to actually set earnings or cash
flow guidance for 2014, or even 2015, indicates that the fundamentals are a topic that
Unilife is loath to confront.


Conclusion


The current season of stock promotion at Unilife appears no different from previous
episodes. Rather than relying on fundamentals disclosed in 10-K and 10-Q filings to
support the share price, Unilife prefers a bombardment of vague press releases. This
gives management cover to further dilute its shareholders, either through at-the-money
offerings or fixed-price block trades. Such a strategy has attracted the day trading crowd.
But this group has the attention span of a five-year-old, and will only remain captivated
while UNIS's share price is rising.


Unfortunately, UNIS's share price has stopped rising. Rather, it's declining. New deal
announcements are falling on deaf ears. Short sellers' criticism is reaching a fever pitch.
The smart money day traders have moved on to greener pastures.


Soon, investors will once again start to ask the tough questions: where is the revenue,
what is the timeline, and when, if ever, will Unilife return sustained free cash flow to
investors?

At this point, any hint of further secondary offerings will severely impact investor psyche.
Any sign of weakness could cause UNIS to swiftly surrender its recent 70% gains.

Your article is well written but fails to communicate the fact that the CEO stated publicly at the AGM that the milestone
payments and revenues from these recent deals will essentially cover their burn in 2014. The CEO also addressed
the shorts directly on a recent webcast. He put them on notice and warned that they were sadly mistaken if they
expect to cover their huge position through a secondary because they don't need to do it.


They have stated multiple time that they are negotiating a debt facility, which the analysts expect to be in the range of
$20-40 million. This more than covers them in 2014 and beyond.


As far as the analysts go, if they are all competing to do this imaginary secondary, why do each of their reports say
that the milestone payments and revenue ramp mitigates the need for a capital raise.


Let's not forget that they have also guided to higher revenue each and every quarter going forward.


Sanofi, Hikma, Novartis, MedImmune.... Companies of this size and reputation do not invest tens of millions in micro-
cap companies without giving them a colonoscopy... that doesn't just mean their products are scrutinized, their
financials are as well.


Sorry you are short this stock. We can't win them all.

Author’s reply »  You could have said the same thing in 2012 when the CEO affirmed that the ATM facility
would not be drawn, "we have not drawn down this facility nor do we have any immediate plans to do so...
The main reason that we put the ATM in place, that was to strengthen our position at the negotiation table".
This proved incorrect, with the ATM diluting shareholders by another ~9m shares within a year.

Unilife has a long history of issuing equity after major deal announcements. It would be naive to believe that
UNIS won't follow a similar playbook today. And with the stock as volatile as it's recently been, we believe any
offering will be come with a substantial discount to the market.


If Unilife weren't raising equity, then the CEO would have no need to directly address the "shorts" and
concern himself with the day-to-day share price. The fact that he does worry about it is revealing.

How come they didn't hit the ATM at $4.50?

out there.

Author’s reply »  Unilife may have indeed exercised the $19.2m remaining on the ATM at $4.50. We won't
know for sure until the next quarterly filing.


Unlike a fixed-priced secondary, Controlled Equity Offerings allow a business to issue new shares at any time
without a filing a new prospectus.

If the facility isn't yet funded, then UNIS should still require equity dilution to fund itself through 2014. We
believe this will be the case.

has any attention of trying to cover short positions or otherwise through a secondary offering, the agreement is not
going to happen. We may tip the ATM a little bit here or there as we're getting the deals in place. I don't even have an
expectation of even doing that, but it is a nice backup to have, so -- we're not imprudent, but we are sitting, literally,

Could be coincidence but Unilife did meet with Jeffries on December 10th,accordiing to reputable website
Flyonthewall. 
As i have written numerous times,nobody really mentions the demand/supply issue-Even if deals were to be legit with
commercial supply attached to them,there is a limit on how many millions of product Unilife can manufacture in their
current facilities-I dont know why CEO Shorthall never discusses manufacturing expansion',and why they havent
commenced on this.Why? Because they dont have the money or the deals are not what Shorthall claims they will
really be. If they really need to produce hundreds of millions of syringes for their current and near future
customers,they better get a move on this.. 
Cash is a necessity that they surely need..

In the recent (12/4/13) talk that Shortall gave at the Piper Jaffray Healthcare Conference he mentioned that
there are plans to expand the present manufacturing facility in PA to an additional 120,000 sq. ft. to
accommodate the increase in business. So he has addressed it and discussed it.

Yes this is a total joke and I am short it.


Just for fun I went back and read a transcript from 3.5 years ago (May 2010). A few choice quotes:


A Jedi mind trick:


"Now in most business cases, a reduction of 50% in revenues might not look like a good thing, but actually it's a very
positive thing for us and I would like to explain to you why."


Unlimited upside anyone?


"And also as I said before, this company has unlimited potential."


"And one of the things that we actually can do with that product because it is so unique is that with pharmaceutical
companies using our device, they can actually build a unique selling proposition whereby they can – it will help them
expand the lifecycle for some of the blockbuster drugs."


That's right folks, the Unifill syringe will render generic drugs obsolete because of the syringe.


And 2011 is shaping up to be a huge year:


"At the end of this year, we'll our first high volume line, which will produce 60 million units per annum for our prefilled
syringes, we'll start to supply them early in 2011 to a pharmaceutical partner and then we'll ramp that up. The next
high volume line will be 150 million unit capacity. And then we will bring in 150 million unit line every year."


These guys will own the market:


"So going out to 2016, at the end of 2016, we'll be producing over 890 million prefilled syringes a year. At that time
that will represent approximately 20% of the global market."


But that's conservative:


"But we believe that's relatively conservative considering 
Sanofi-Aventis our partner use in excess 40% of the market."

Some very good feedback provided by Biodel on Unilife's EZ Mix product. Enjoy.


"Our work to optimize this novel delivery system continues steadily and today I'm pleased to announce that a study
was completed to evaluate end users' ability to comprehend and operate the prototype commercial easy mix device.
The study known as a human factor study reinforced our enthusiasm for the device and generated a wealth of useful
feedback to inform our customization process. We plan a follow up study to confirm the final device design before
commencing with large scale manufacturing of the product and the large summative human factor study plan for next
year. Additionally, lyophilized glucagon and WN formulations have been finalized for use in our customized easy mix
device."

more realistically than the title for this article is the question will UNIS ever fall below $4.00 again


19 Dec 2013, 04:32 PM


Restino
The facts you site are outdated based on the past. The company has turned around and signed 5 major bio
pharmaceutical contracts with global leaders in the industry.


Now that they have these deals in place, with many more to come, I would say that if they need to raise capital then
they surely should do it to support the massive growth they are seeing.


It would be plain dumb for the company not do everything they can to meet the huge orders that will start flowing in.


If they raise more capital then I think that is smart financial decision and positive news looking forward.

KCM, I laughed. I cried. I’m still long.


1) "Making matters worse, Unilife must pay one of its equipment suppliers $4.8m, as announced on November 27th."
- You left out the details: "... over the course of the next 12 months." Ooooo. Very scary.


2) “On a recent conference call, Unilife confirmed that it employed deal announcements as a means to pump its share
price before secondary offerings:” You left out the part in brackets that defines what “it” is: “[And the only reason that I
as CEO and our executive team could be comfortable with our current low cash position, if you look over the previous
3 years, the lowest cash position we ever have had was about $18.5 million, $19 million. So historically, we'd never
run below that.]. The only reason we would do it and not have done a secondary offering either on the back of the
Sanofi deal or the back of the MedImmune deal was simply because of our confidence of the deals that are in
process..." (Q1 F2014 Call)."


3) "We wish both underwriters the best of luck in their gripping race to win the UNIS placement mandate -- may the
most bullish analyst win!" OK, I’ll give you that one.


4) "Short sellers' criticism is reaching a fever pitch." No argument there! I suspect this is a year end phenomenon.

Take a look at Biodel's website promoting Unilife's auto mixing syringe. Tell me this device is not innovative and a
game changer.

Author’s reply »  The auto-mixed syringe appears cumbersome, tough to manufacture, and consists of many
discrete parts. Manufacturing millions of these syringes at 100% efficiency would be an extraordinary difficult
and costly task. Until Unilife starts providing guidance on cash flow-based profitability, the current market
capitalization doesn't seem justifiable. Fundamentals matter more than flashy websites.

KCM,


(1) “Cumbersome” - Compared to the non-mixing BD syringe, perhaps. However, the target market consists
of “institutions, emergency responders and many [Not All] diabetic patients.” (see transcript of 4Q 2013
results posted elsewhere on SA) 
(2) “Tough to Manufacture” – Challenging? Sure. But maybe that is why they have sunk a bundle into
automated manufacturing equipment.

5/23/2018 Will Unilife Price Its Potential Secondary Above $3.50? - Unilife Corporation (NASDAQ:UNIS) | Seeking Alpha

(3) “millions of these syringes” – Per BIOD 4Q, “This program is targeted for its first NDA submission in
2015…We plan a follow up study to confirm the final device design before commencing with large scale
manufacturing of the product and the large summative human factor study plan for next year.” They don’t
need to produce a million units tomorrow. 
(4) “100% efficiency” – This qualifier presumes that they can just barely meet the production rate
requirements. I think there is consensus that they don’t have the capacity to do this now, so you might as well
say 400% efficiency! Production capability is not static, but will evolve as firm demand materializes.

Cumbersome? Not as cumbersome as the process of re-constituting lyophilised drugs for use in the home.


I own bio stocks that have drugs whose competitive advantages against market participants is they are not
lyophilised drugs. The EZ Mix removes this competitive advantage. The EZ Mix makes lyophilised drugs just
as easy to use as simple liquid drugs.


Cumbersome my as.s.

Let's explore cumbersome for untrained or even trained users:


1. A single EZ Mix device, involving 3 steps; or


2. Using 2 vials, 2 needles, and a disposable syringe involving multiple steps, making sure there is no spillage
or other dosage variations when reconstituting the drug.


Put it another way, which drug has a better competitive advantage for ease of use - a liquid or lyophilised
drug?


Biodel signed a 15 year contract. There will be more for this product.

The question was not answered by the author.


Yes it is a first of its kind revolutionary product. I am not sure why the author says it is hard to operate when
he has not even tried it. Live demonstrations show that it is very simple to use, works effortlessly and does not
spill liquid and contaminate the drug like the competitors model - which is why it is revolutionary.


It is manufactured with high standards and manufacturing can produce millions without a problem as stated
by management.


Now that 5 major bio pharmaceutical contracts have been signed by global leaders paying millions of dollars
upfront Unilife announced they will be giving guidance starting next year. Most of your comments are based
on the old ideas of the past for Unilife when they were struggling to get a business together.

Every business has this to overcome. Now Unilife has overcome that hurdle, signed with major global big
brand names companies as you should know so they have arrived and now is their time.


I would not want to be caught short this stock as the author is when several more contracts are due out by
end of year and then even more as the very start of January forward.


The stock has rising from a low of $1.80 and now achieved $5.10 as a new multi year high. Hedge funds own
40% of this company for a reason. They are long because Unilife has achieved success and longs are in on
the ground floor so to speak.

Unilife products are highly sought after as shown by the millions if upfront money supplied to Unilife after a contract is
signed. 5 contracts have been signed recently and that provides close to all the operating expenses needed for the
year. 1 more contract should completely cover all expenses.


The company never had contracts like these signed prior. This is why traders shorted this company. However, Unilife
was working hard toward this current goal, setting up manufacturing, getting FDA approvals, quality inspections and
they had over 30 ongoing projects working for several years with global pharmaceuticals. These are the exact
projects that turned into the 5 recent contracts that have the potential of bringing $100's of Millions of dollars to the
company soon.

Unilife has achieved success and the share price is reflecting that as we speak. Don't let shorters that make up
information and downplay each contract tell you otherwise.


Unilife has turned thte corner towards profit and that is why the company is heading higher and higher. Each contract
signed will bring more companies to their door with many millions in up front payments and long term 15 year
contracts.


Where else can you find global bio pharmaceutical companies signed up for 15 year contracts?


Unilife has Game Changing products. They are the leaders.

I have read through all of Kerrysdale Capital articles for both Unilife and all other companies they write about. Some
time they get a short position right, but most times it does not appear to be the case so caution should be exercised
when considering this article.


They did get it right on the China Education stock but that was easy because China is highly corrupts. Everyone
knows that. Companies have to pay bribes to local and regional governments every week, etc.


However, I do not see that they are correct in their short position with Unilife. I think they may have been short since
well before Unilife signed 5 major contracts. Before that nothing ever came to be as the CEO stated so he has
negative images in investors minds. And that is what Kerrysdale Capital is playing on. Old images of the CEO. 5 new
actual contracts have been signed with major bio pharmaceutical companies. That certainly never happened before.
So their thesis is not valid.


Now Kerrysdale Capital is playing on fears of the past once again with dilution of shares or ATM tapping, etc. The
truth is that if it is needed them we are all for it now. Why? Because it will be used to handle manufacturing needs for
materials and other things to get the contract requirements delivered. Every company does this.


If they does this or not it will not affect the company because it will be done to support the contract needs.


Do not let this article put fear in you. I am staying long and adding on every dip. This company has turned the corner
and is now almost profitable. Guess what that means? The share price will almost double on that news alone not to
mentioned adding even more contracts as the CEO promised (7 more within months or even weeks/days) will further
drive the share price.


Analysts are targeting upwards of $13.50 within months.

Author’s reply »  Unilife diluted shareholders again last week with 1.5m shares priced at $4.25. While new
shareholers continue to pay $5+ for shares, UNIS management is a seller at $4.25. This also indicates that prior
reports of a debt facility are false.


Conspicuously, the filing was made on the Australian exchange and not on the SEC's EDGAR.
