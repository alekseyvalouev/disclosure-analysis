Glu Mobile: Kim K Trips, New Games Disappoint, Key Insider Sells
Amid Crazy P/E
Jul. 22, 2015 10:59 AM ET57 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Glu’s three top games drive the bulk of past and current revenues. But they are
beginning to decline.


New games launched so far this year are getting lackluster rankings in both
downloads and grossing revenues in the app store, games currently in soft launch
also get disappointing numbers.


A director who was an original investor also manages a fund that is now dumping
the majority of its shares in Glu.


Glu’s price-to-forward earnings is an outlandish 74, while the P/E is about 20 for two
competitors and the industry as a whole.


Overall, we expect Glu leaders will need to lower sales guidance for the third quarter
and potentially the entire year.


Her stilettos flashing and iPhone snapping selfies, Kim Kardashian is racing out in front,
with Deer Hunter close behind, and Racing Rivals bringing up the rear. But wait … No, no.
It can't be…Yes, yes, America's dashing diva is slowing now as, in one fell swoop, she
whips out a tiny mirror, smears pink lip plumper on that famous kisser and checks out the
scenery behind her. Slowing, slowing, slowing. Stumble…


In the wacky world of mobile game making, Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU) is in a constant
mad dash for gamers' hearts and fingertips.


But Glu's top three games "Kim Kardashian: Hollywood," "Deer Hunter 2014," and "Racing
Rivals" are now losing ground, according to App Annie data.


And that decline is just the first warning flag amid a mile-long parade of red flags viciously
snapping at Glu.


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment, but
investors may find other viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, here's a quick executive summary:

Executive Summary


•Hopped up on hype: Glu Mobile's stock is up on hoped-for hits and the company's
enthusiastic guidance.


•Declining stars: Glu's three top games drive the bulk of past and current revenues.
But they are in a slow decline.


•Recent games disappoint: Games launched so far this year are turning in
disappointing numbers. And games currently in soft launch are getting surprisingly
poor rankings, too.


•Key insider selling: A director who was an original investor also manages a fund
that is now dumping the majority of its shares in Glu.


•Crazy P/E: Glu's price-to-forward earnings is an outlandish 74, while the P/E is
about 20 for two competitors and the industry as a whole.


•Should guide lower: Overall, we expect Glu leaders will need to lower sales
guidance for the third quarter and potentially the entire year.


Indeed, we believe Glu shares are poised to decline faster than a broken stiletto can drop
any dashing diva. Here's why:


*Current Stars Decline


"Kim Kardashian: Hollywood" ran a good race for Glu last year, grabbing $74 million in
revenue.


(Source: Glu Mobile)


Second-place "Deer Hunter 2014" bagged $52 million, and "Racing Rivals" won $18
million in revenue.


Altogether, the trio infused Glu with about 60 percent of its total revenue.

But this chart from App Annie shows Glu's top seller, Kim Kardashian, is now beginning to
lose ground:


(Source: App Annie)


And this chart shows Deer Hunter 2014 continues to decline more severely:

The chart below shows the downward trend for Racing Rivals, as well.

Comments made during the earnings call in April by CEO Niccolo de Masi suggest
dependence on those titles: "Our Q1 outperformance was underpinned by the continued
success of our three largest titles. Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Deer Hunter 2014 and
Racing Rivals."


But what does the charted slow decline of these three titles suggest about the third
quarter? Armed with those charts plus other publicly available documents, investors can
see the chinks in the armor...


*New Games Flopping


Glu Mobile is racing to launch 15 new games this year. Analyzing data from App Annie
gives us an idea of the performance of recent releases.

(Source: App Annie)


So downloads - from Cooking Dash (first #224, then bouncing to #4, now #131) to Tap
Sports Baseball (first #190, then bouncing to #22, now #88) - face declining rankings
overall.


And the blah standing in the popularity contest points to yet another negative for these
new titles.


Significantly, none of the games are turning in good numbers in the "grossing rank." This
ranks each games' gross revenue generated in the app store.


The grossing rank ranges from Tap Sports Baseball 2015 in #34...

To #598 ranked Terminator Genisys: Revolution ...


(Source: Glu Mobile)


(Terminator's ranking is particularly poor considering the Terminator movie last weekend
machine-gunned its way to #6 at the box office).


Here's the deal: A game usually needs to rank 10 or higher in "grossing rank" in order to
generate meaningful revenue.


The chart by Glomo Investing supports that top 10 requirement idea.


(Source: Glomo Investing)


So, both download rank and grossing rank look rather sickly for Glu's new games.


With just a few, relatively low-performers out the gate, Glu Mobile will need to ditch its
stilettos and run like crazy to release about seven more titles in the second half of the year
- and those must win many more downloads.


However…

*Mission Impossible: New US Results Hint This Message Will Self-Destruct


A new movie and long-ago television smash hit like "Mission Impossible" should translate
to the perfect game to satisfy Glu's needs just about now. Geeks and geek-ettes may want
to check out the trailer, here, for Glu's new game, "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation."


But the trailer may be far more exciting than the actual game. The Mission Impossible
game launched in the United States on July 16 and investors can see the disappointing
results so far:


(Source: App Annie)


The gross ranking peaked at only #137 and then retreated to #162. Those just aren't
blockbuster numbers at this point.


The game falls way, way below that benchmark ranking of #10 or higher. So it isn't making
a lot of money.


Looking at downloads, as shown below, Mission Impossible unsurprisingly enjoyed an
initial spike … followed by tapering:

(Source: App Annie)


Mission Impossible needs to be virtually blowing the fingers off gamers. Instead, game
players seem to consider it just another first-person-shooter (FPS) game in a crowded
niche that's beginning to grow tired.


So early results are surprisingly disappointing.


*Soft Launches Sag


The Eternity Warriors franchise is aging, so it may be no surprise that the "Eternity
Warriors: Hero's Call" soft launch in Canada is low in grossing ranks.



https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/974110790/rank-history/#vtype=day&countries=US&start=2015-06-22&end=2015-07-21&device=iphone&view=rank&lm=8

(Source: App Annie)


How about the "Sniper X: Kill Confirmed" soft-launch in Austria?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3345875-glu-mobile-kim-k-trips-new-games-disappoint-key-insider-sells-amid-crazy-p-e 11/24


(Source: App Annie)


So the chart above clearly shows the downward trend of the "Sniper X" soft-launch.


Two other games that were recently soft-launched experienced just as disappointing
grossing rankings. Tap Sports Football, launched in Australia, rated only #1,250 and Deer
Hunter 2016, launched in Switzerland, ranked #246.


Analysts are predicting negatives - a $0.04 earnings loss next quarter and an 11.7 percent
decline in sales the following quarter, shown here. But the 2015 games appear poised to
disappoint gamers, investors and the very analysts predicting such poor earnings.


*Long-time Investment Fund And Director Yell "Sell!"


Glu Mobile director Hany Nada and GGV Capital have been dumping their shares.


This is particularly significant because Mr. Nada not only invested in Glu early on. He also
actually led Glu's Series D funding and participated in the initial public offering.


And GGV Capital, or Granite Global Ventures Capital, was a top 10 Glu investor. But no
more.


Here's a snapshot showing Mr. Nada recently sold over 1.5 million shares at around
$6.55-$7 per share and has a little over 29,000 shares left.

Here's a quick, graphic snapshot showing the sudden decline in Granite Global Ventures'
position in Glu Mobile.

The director and his fund likely know Glu better than anyone.


Bulls assume Glu is on the verge of excellent revenue and significant growth in 2016 amid
titles the CEO said will be released late in the fall featuring Katy Perry, Kendall and Kylie
Jenner and Britney Spears.


So why on earth would the most knowledgeable, long-time investor - Granite Global
Ventures - keep Glu through the tougher times, as indicated by the stock chart below …

And why would that investor boot Glu now?


*What's Wrong With The Tencent Bull Case

5/22/2018 Glu Mobile: Kim K Trips, New Games Disappoint, Key Insider Sells Amid Crazy P/E - Glu Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ:GLUU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3345875-glu-mobile-kim-k-trips-new-games-disappoint-key-insider-sells-amid-crazy-p-e 13/24


So, Granite Global Ventures Capital essentially made the bear case.


Probably the most prevalent theme in the bull thesis is China game distributor Tencent's
(OTCPK:TCEHY) recent $126 million investment in Glu Mobile.


Tencent paid $6 per share - just about where shares trade now. We contend the company
overpaid.


We see that after years of hanging in there, GGV Capital is now exiting … at prices similar
to what Tencent paid to get into Glu.


Others are exiting - or at least selling plenty of shares. Directors, officers, even CEO de
Masi have recently been selling - about 1.15 million since May - at $5 to $7 per share. Mr.
de Masi, incidentally, also bought ~411,000 shares, but paid only $1.77-$2.03 apiece.


Additionally, Tencent is a $250 billion market capitalization company that is huge in China.
So even if Glu's value doubled - or if it dropped in half - Tencent wouldn't really care too
much.


That's because Tencent needs more mobile games just to sustain its valuation. In fact, the
mobile game distributor regularly acquires stakes in other companies and recently crafted
an agreement with another company that was bigger than the Glu deal.


So the Tencent deal appears to be primarily to access Glu's content.


Conclusion: If Kim and Friends Are Losing Steam, What Will Tomorrow Hold?


So we believe the consensus expectation of $75 million in third quarter sales is too high.
We expect Glu will squeeze past the second quarter but be forced to reduce third quarter
guidance and potentially the entire year.


We see current hits like Kim Kardashian declining somewhat, disappointing performance
of 2015 game launches so far, more poor performance from games in soft launch … and
almost all Katy Perry revenue recognition postponed until 2016.


So, here's how it looks.


We assume sales stay flat from the first quarter - driven primarily by the big three: Kim
Kardashian, Deer Hunter and Racing Rivals - into the third quarter.


New games will need to generate about $13 million ($75m consensus sales - $62m Q1
sales).

(Source: Bloomberg)


Top games - not mega hits - generate about $1.65 million in sales per quarter, as shown in
Glu Mobile's chart, below:


(Source: Company presentation)


That figure means Glu Mobile will need to release seven games in the third quarter, each
performing as well as Robocop and Contract Killer Sniper - a tough target to hit.


Overall, we expect Glu's stock price to stumble and dive - much like the tumbles Kim
Kardashian has endured - from today's $6.30 to about $4 per share near-term.

The track record of these pathetic negative losers makes one wonder how they make a living. Ebix tripled and many
other names went on to double. If their track record is a sign then we are in good hands here. I hate cynical shorts.

look forward to the follow up next year when glu is trading at $12. maybe 3rd time will be a charm for the
streetsweeper! what a joke of a company trying to make a quick dollar.

HOOSIER57
I have an opinion that the short position, has a very "short" time frame, and will become a converted long, going into
August 4 earnings. IMHO, earnings will again be a significant beat, with a revised upwards guidance for the year....
then as a converted long you will enjoy the substantial run up post earnings... then you will establish your short
position again...just like your previous incorrect synopsis, that preceded an earnings beat....ho hum....so predictable.

KK currently at 13 and been out for over a year, HUGE drop off man. Guidance is already low for 2nd half of year


22 Jul 2015, 12:38 PM


ntcse
By the way top 3 games are doing fantastic these days for the 3rd quarter so far, how about putting the grossing
charts instead of the download. Glu only guided 80 million for KKH and RR this entire year and they will already be at
60 million for first half with the games having picked up significantly in July. That 80 million guidance seems extremely
safe and will probably be surpassed easily by end of Q3. Do you honestly think Deer Hunter 2016 will be a flop
because of Switzerland? Tres drole haha


22 Jul 2015, 12:48 PM


User 16615772
Deer Hunter 2016 indeed is likely a flop.


02 Oct 2015, 07:33 PM


ntcse
It's not ranked #246 like it was in Switzerland is it? That's because the pilot markets don't reflect the US
market. I've seen several games do poorly in the pilot market and do much better in the US. Deer Hunter is
not a flop, it's a disappointment for many, including Glu itself, but it will bring in more than it cost to make. I
think the analysis in this article is a flop (as can be seen when you fast forward after reading the analysis of
the Sweeper article before this where they said that Kim's game was headed to zero in a hurry)

Why shouldn't de Masi take some profit in the mid-$6 range if he has an option to buy more at a third of the price? As
for a couple of hedge funds taking profits from a volatile high beta stock when market indices are hitting record highs,
it could just be part of a general market rotation into less risky assets, and not necessarily any reflection on this
particular company's prospects.


22 Jul 2015, 01:09 PM


wretchedturkey
I find it interesting all the comments thus far are primarily focused on bashing the contributor than the contribution.


I, too, disagree with the author's opinion on the state of the games, as I think downloads is NOT an accurate indicator
for a game that has been out over a year. Its all about gross revenues at this point. So, sure, downloads are trending
downward, however its the trends in gross revenues that matter and as ntcse mentioned, GLUU is doing alright on
that front.


However, one significant aspect that the comments are missing is the fact that Mr Nada & GGV has indeed been
selling out (along with other insiders). When its a one off instance, its easy to dispell - i.e. maybe they needed to pay
taxes a new house etc. But when its a whole slew of insiders... that typically indicates short term pain. 
For longs, perhaps that's just what it is - short term. And to be waited out. 
However, bashing a contributor who highlights a very significant point is just irrational.


Debate the contribution not the contributor.


FYI - I appreciate the fact that the contributor is short. It presents that he/they really feel strongly about their thesis
and willing to put their money where their mouth is. Plus he indicated he believed $4 is where it will go. Some shorts
say they are short and do not disclose at what point a short these turns long. 
So I commend the author for that as well.


22 Jul 2015, 01:17 PM


platonicbomb
It's because we all know the contributor has nothing to contribute, hence we don't bother reading enough of
the content to comment on it.


I hope SS has a very big short position.


22 Jul 2015, 01:39 PM


NextGenAnalysis, Contributor
Nada & GGV are a shop that specialize in DISTRESSED Equity. They took down a big chunk of a 2ndary in
2008 when Glu was distressed. They take board seats and help turn the company around and then sell and
move on to the next DISTRESSED equity they feel they can earn a return on. So selling would be their MO.

Not selling would mean they had completely change their strategy. As for Nicolo's sales it was about a 1/8th
of his position. Pretty prudent to take a bit off the table and diversify his assets.

dude, GGV is a venture capital fund. total non issue, but whatever.


hard to believe the writer at streetsweeper can earn a living by producing this nonsense. do some real work
street sweeper. almost every thought in your piece conveys a total lack of understanding. anyone who really
understand the mobile games business and what's really happening at glu understands this writeup is the
work of an amateur analyst at best, at worst an unethical market manipulator.


Streetsweeper, perhaps you could join the conversation. you have no credibility in the market, so nothing to
lose, right?

Seeking Alpha has lost any credibility it had left.


What a joke, and 5 minutes I will never get back.


Not even worth rebutting as these guys are obviously scared about their short position.


2 weeks to earnings guys. Better get out while you can.

This is simply the most transparent hatchet job I've ever seen in an SA article (and I've seen some really terrible
ones).


You keep repeating the share sale by one single fund. Well, George Soros bet $ 1 billion against the market on
October 15th 2014. He was wrong, as is the no-name fund you keep mentioning.


As for the Tencent deal, it's a match made in Heaven. It will increase GLUU's revenues by $ 500 million in the world's
most populous and mobile-crazy nation.


And here come the Jenners, Katy Perry, Britney Spears ...... You ain't seen nothin' yet!

STOP using download numbers and USA ONLY numbers. China, Japan, S. Korea, Germany are other specific
countries that can generate significant revenue. KKH has actually had a very good start to Q3.


With that said, I'm not sure Glu meets 2Q guidance.

just another BS article designed to cause panic


22 Jul 2015, 03:44 PM

Deer Hunter 2016 coming out this quarter and it will be a monster hit. Katy Perry in Q4. Glu doing a great job
increasing the revenue tail on KKH and Racing Rivals. KKH has been a top 10 grossing title for the last few days.
Racing Rivals jumped to #12 a few days ago and is consistently #20-#30 and the game was released in 2013.


This article is BS. Yes, revenue in May for Glu dipped, but April was great, June was great, and July has been superb
--- with AAA titles in the near term horizon. DH16 will be a top 10 title maybe for the rest of 2015 once it is released.

I am long on Glu since last six months when it shares was 3.97$. I believe that the stock will hit 10 by the end of 2016
Q1. Having said that I am still indeed worried that it might miss Q2 guidance and not feel comfortable with insider
selling stock. I think a good CEO never sells his shares for a very long period of time instead he continues to add
shares. Like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and others. Hence I am very disappointed when Niccolo de Masi sold many
of his shares. That is never a good sign.  
The games are not doing bad overall. Cooking Dash and Mission Impossible both recently releases are above #150
rank in gross earnings. Furthermore, there are many good games to come in Q3 and Q4. I think new Deer Hunter and
Tap sport football games will be huge success, but I am not sure about 007 success. 
In conclusion, I am worried for the short time period but I hope that in the long time period Glu will do quite well.

It has been said a million times, but perhaps needs to be said again: an isolated case of insider selling is
meaningless, while a case of insider buying is not; all the more when the same single insider who sold,
retained most of his shares while almost simultaneously exercising an option to buy. Even the hedge fund that
the author claims sold "most" of its shares, apparently also retained a minority of its shares pre-earnings; why
would they do that if they thought earnings or guidance would disappoint? If this is the short-selling author's
best evidence for a bear case, it's a reason to buy.

long gluu! this is the last breath a short has to expel before the coming explosion of revenues. The p.e. value
argument doesn't work with gluu; perhaps in a couple of years.


22 Jul 2015, 08:01 PM


Healer121
LONG GLUU - going to 10 this year and it is a buy out candidate as well! Get on the train while you still can.


22 Jul 2015, 08:45 PM


Riding High
Long $GLUU - I love it when shorts bring the price down just before earnings conferences. They highlight concerns
that should be briefly considered and most likely discarded by those who have done their homework, and the stock
price often fluctuates enough as a result of the scared investors to sometimes allow for a good bargain. Its all part of
the process. I too think $GLUU will be at $10 by the end of the year, even if they stumble a bit this past quarter. Longs
should look at annual earnings and long term guidance.


23 Jul 2015, 11:01 AM


rafruano
Agreed. im a buyer under $6...


23 Jul 2015, 02:57 PM


jonny0017
i wonder if it will dip below 6 again


23 Jul 2015, 04:31 PM


IPO Candy, Contributor
Good article. It's what makes a market. Funny thing is that I saw many of the charts presented as positive rather than
negative.


I prefer a balanced approach in research and analysis rather than the purely bullish or purely bearish. Still reading
both sides separately works pretty well to help form your own view on the business and the stock.


Personally I think this company is executing well and the shares are responding based on that.

Sweeper tried this tactic last year and it had a short term impact and they were proved to be very wrong in their
thesis. Looks like they are grabbing at straws now. A game's top ranking does not necessarily matter. What matters is
how much it cost Glu to make the game and how much they get out of it. You can have the number one ranked game
in the world but if u are not making a solid margin on it it really doesn't matter at all. That is where Glu is smart. They
understand every game will not be the next sensation and they budget accordingly.


25 Jul 2015, 10:44 PM

today's $5.85 will look like a bargain in 3 months. $7.50-$8 by then. imo.


27 Jul 2015, 04:36 PM


jonny0017
I'm buying everything up that I can!

If GLUU were to drop to the 4 dollar range I would triple down not double,I would not mind at all if GLUU pulls back
after ER it would give me a chance to reload.Long term GLUU ON BABY.

I like that gluu hasn't run up before earnings this time. It's not about this quarter anyway. By the end of October this
stock will rocket up (assuming no major correction).

Long GLUU, but manipulation is rampant here !! I'm out @ $10

dancingmonkeys
Well that was a pretty fantastic and prescience call on GLUU earnings! I hope the longs got out before earnings, else
they can join the bag holder brigade. Folks should really focus on the content of the material versus bashing its
merits. Just saying....


04 Aug 2015, 07:56 PM


ntcse
Well, the point "Glu’s three top games drive the bulk of past and current revenues. But they are beginning to
decline" is obviously false given grossing revenue from Think Gaming. So at least part of the content is
wrong, as was the content from the last sweeper article. Might as well flip a coin if you think being right on
stock price equates fundamentals.


04 Aug 2015, 09:33 PM


Dividend Data
The content is completely wrong. GLUU crushed estimates. The low-ball guidance is what has AH price
action down.


05 Aug 2015, 01:09 AM


dancingmonkeys
Maybe I am reading it wrong, but in the conclusion it says: "We expect Glu will squeeze past the second
quarter but be forced to reduce third quarter guidance and potentially the entire year." Isn't that what
happened?


05 Aug 2015, 10:10 AM


platonicbomb
No, it increased the low end of guidance for the year. The transcript is available, all numbers are public.


Moreover it increased guidance while pushing out the launch of some games. So management feels pretty
confident about revenue.


05 Aug 2015, 12:07 PM


User 16615772
Delayed game which caused concerns about whether GLUU can execute well on the celebrity games, this is
the reason of the sell-off, IMO.


05 Aug 2015, 12:30 PM


tromur
I think market only looks 2 to 3 months out at most. Therefore sell off. Hold long term or re-enter prior to q3 or q4
Earnings. 2016 should go crazy with all the celeb games. Does anyone really doubt the amount of money Katy Perry
game will make GLUU?

I have been long for very long time but I worry what if Katy game isn't as big a hit as expected.


06 Aug 2015, 08:43 AM


HOOSIER57
Just remember that forecast for earnings did not include any outsized hits. if we get an outsized hit...just more
of a plus and pleasant surprise.


06 Aug 2015, 09:21 AM


tromur
Why you worried KP game won't be a hit? Does she have way more celeb power/following than KK. I'm not worried
about that. Just trying to decide what to do with this position for next 2 months? Sell and re-enter or hold.


07 Aug 2015, 09:44 PM


User 16615772
More celeb power doesn't translate into more game popularity.


07 Aug 2015, 11:32 PM


ntcse
Glu had a game called Stardom Hollywood before that is the exact same engine produced by the exact same
team, but without the celebrity attached. It was good for 4 million a year. They added Kim's character for that
game and the new game is good for 80 million a year. So I think the celebrity factor has shown to have a
huge impact if done right.


08 Aug 2015, 10:59 AM


User 16615772
ntcse, good point. However, there might not be space for multiple celebrity games thus Kate Perry game might not be
as popular as expected or it might be popular but it might take users away from current KKH game.


08 Aug 2015, 12:06 PM


ntcse
I agree, it's unrealistic to assume 2 celebs will make twice the rate. On the other hand, it does de-risk the
category for the company since inevitable drop off in popularity of one celebrity will be accompanied by the
rise of others. Then you factor in the growth of the mobile gaming market as well even if the model doesn't
take away market share from other types of games. I guess we shall have to wait to see how things go in
aggregate. It's interesting to have the Jenner sisters if they appeal to a younger demographic.

Personally I think sports will be what surprises on the upside. Good discussion here. At the current price it seems like
not much success is priced in. Risk/reward probably better than it's been in a long time.
