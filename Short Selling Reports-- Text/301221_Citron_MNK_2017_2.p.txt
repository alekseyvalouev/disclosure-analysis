Including Increase in Deaths


Not only will Mallinckrodt Go to 0, but This Report
Publishes the Reason their Management might go to

MALLINCKRODT IN
FULL DAMAGE
CONTROL MODE
For Immediate Release – June 26, 2017


IT’S TIME TO END
THIS DANGEROUS
GAME OF GREED
NOW!

As if last month’s comments from
Express Scripts were not bad enough for
Mallinckrodt … The FDA has just
disclosed information that could lead to
criminal prosecution of Mallinckrodt
executives. Three weeks ago, Express
Scripts, the PBM whose subsidiaries are
responsible for executing the entire
delivery chain for Mallinckrodt’s Acthar,
made a group of damning statements:
that Acthar was an old drug, grossly
overpriced, with very limited patient
need, and was being used for label
indications for which there was no
clinical evidence.


THIS JUST GOT MUCH
MORE SERIOUS THAN
PROFITS


THIS WEEK THE
FDA RELEASED
THE UPDATED
ADVERSE EVENT
DATABASE
(FAERS) WITH
COMPLETE 2016
DATA.
Citron has spent a week extracting the
files and created a database for
analysis. This is the first time this
information is public. This new data
reports sharply increasing numbers of
deaths and hospitalizations associated
with use of Acthar which are
unprecedented over its history. During
the periods covered, Acthar is showing
single digit increases in unit volumes,
while Adverse Events are being posted
in excess 277% CAGR for the period
2012 through 2016.

These statistics are startling, considering Pulitzer Prize winning journalist
Gretchen Morgenson first introduced Wall Street to the negative FAERS data
on Acthar in 2014 – long before the major jump in adverse events.

WHY THIS COULD NOW BECOME A
CRIMINAL MATTER
Citron believes the reason for the increase in adverse events is the company’s
aggressive expansion of Acthar into new indications, where it has not
conducted clinical trials in order to prove its safety for those conditions. This
explanation is not just idle speculation. A recent Qui Tam Lawsuit, filed by
Barry Franks, former sales manager of Auto-Immune and Rare Disease
Division of Mallinckrodt. The following statements are excerpts from the
lawsuit, and point directly to the cause behind the increase in deaths and
hospitalizations. Franks, a seasoned and experienced pharma sales
professional, was expected to deliver sales results that were not supported
by lawful drug sales practices. These excerpts from the full suit provide
investors a chilling picture of how the company’s policies directed sales reps
to push Acthar beyond its label conditions.


33. “However, the reason for the “explosive growth” of other
Rheumatology sales teams at that point in time was due, in part, to
MALLINCKRODT requesting that its representative promote the
Acthar drug in an illegal, off-label manner.”


35. “Franks was clear that he would not engage in illegal activities to
increase sales”… Despite this, and being advised that employees
were told by compliance to not to “put anything in writing” …


37. “A similar push and acknowledgement that to keep his job,
Franks essentially had to push in off-label areas…”


40. “Franks is informed and believes that there were illegal sales
practices being committed in other regions…”


42. Franks was also aware of other compliance related issues at
MALLINCKRODT, which Franks is informed and believes and thereon
alleges that these issues include but are not limited to: potentially
insurance/Medicare fraud related to the refills as noted above,
HIPAA violations where four or eight week prescriptions were
provided where there was no patient visit … This was done to “game
the system” and potentially commit insurance/Medicare fraud.)

A NOTE TO MALLINCKRODT:
Before you respond:


These are not the statistics of some short seller or journalist who you dispute
in Press Releases. This is not even the opinion of your PBM. This is the FDA.
This is not the time to issue some nonsense PR, this is the time to call your
lawyers. Remember, the FAERS database is voluntary — it might actually
understate the harm you are doing to your off-label patients. Note:
Remember Mallinckrodt claims it does not definitively know the active
ingredient of this expensive and potentially dangerous drug. As stated on
their own website:


Note: Remember Mallinckrodt claims it does not definitively know the
active ingredient of this expensive and potentially dangerous drug. As
stated on their own website:


“While the exact way that Acthar works in the body
is unknown, further studies are being conducted.”


https://www.actharexcessprotein.com/learn-about-acthar/find-out-how-acthar-
works.html


So while they have taken billions of dollars from
Medicare… they do not even have a scientific grasp on
the safety profile, let alone efficacy, while they
knowingly HARM patients who as their sales team
pushes the medication beyond the core indications.
How have they done this? Through unscrupulous doctors!


As Mallinckrodt has become more and more aggressive expanding marketing into
untested indications, these are the type of doctors that have become associated
with Acthar.



https://www.actharexcessprotein.com/learn-about-acthar/find-out-how-acthar-works.html
According to the FDA, the TOP #1 prescriber of Acthar was Dr. David Mandel.


Dr. Mandel was charged criminally with importing misbranded drugs by the DOJ


Worse, read here that top prescriber Dr. Sean Orr was misdiagnosing people with
Multiple Sclerosis just so he could prescribe Acthar.


A NOTE TO MALLINCKRODT:
Please Do not respond with your standard line that:


“HP Acthar Gel makes a significant difference in
the lives of thousands of very sick patients” and
is ‘responsibly priced”


Then why did the nation’s most pre-eminent formulary manager just state the
exact opposite?


Enter Imprimis, who, through its spinoff Eton Pharmaceuticals, just announced it
will be launching a competitor to Acthar, while enlisting the former CEO of Questcor
to join its Board of Directors and advise on its’ launch of an Acthar competitor.


Eton plans on charging 40% less for its product than Mallinckrodt’s price.


When Imprimis did this to Mylan and the EpiPen, Mylan immediately created a
generic version at half the price of the branded EpiPen. Imprimis executed a similar
strategy with Turing Pharma, through the launch of a generic costing 1/750th of
Turing’s price, immediately forcing Turing to reduce its drug’s price.


Lower priced alternatives to Acthar will enable patients to be treated with a product

that has a direct filed safety profile with the FDA, and will create a disincentive for
bad medicine to be practiced for the sake of greed.


More importantly, by being able to focus on people who can really benefit by Acthar
and not be forced by the burden of a multi billion debt load, Eton will be able to
penetrate and dominate the only market that Acthar Gel has a place in and not
further hurt its patient base.

CONCLUSION
The most expensive drug on the Medicare dashboard is:


Untested,


Over Prescribed


Inferior to Competition


… and now Dangerous


The FDA has told you, their former employees have told you, and we now wait for
the Department of Justice.


It is time for Congress or Express Scripts to act responsibly and stop this billion
dollar charade before more people are hurt.
