Uni-Pixel: Is The SEC Investigating?
Jun. 21, 2013 10:52 AM ET244 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


When we consulted with experts in the touch screen industry who had tested UniBoss, it
was clear to us that Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) was unlikely to be successful. You can
find a summary of our findings in our first article. But the best shorts don't just have bad
technology - they also have bad characters. So as we did our checks, we also researched
the past histories of the management team. The information we uncovered was
overwhelmingly negative.


Three current and former Uni-Pixel executives have been involved in past scandals at
their companies where there have been allegations of fraud. In the lawsuits described
below, the similarities are striking. The lawsuits claim that executives raised money from
investors despite knowing that their technologies and products did not work and were
going to fail. We believe that Uni-Pixel executives are at it again, but this time we suspect
the SEC is catching up to them.


SEC letters and FOIA response


We have witnessed what we and others believe to be multiple examples of securities
violations by the executives at Uni-Pixel. As a result, we wrote the SEC on three separate
occasions about our concerns regarding Uni-Pixel's behavior. On April 22, 2013, the SEC
received a letter highlighting three material violations of its disclosure obligations
concerning the material terms of Uni-Pixel's "manufacturing and supply" agreement with
Eastman Kodak Company (click here). On May 2, 2013, the SEC received a letter
detailing further evidence that Uni-Pixel had violated securities laws by withholding
information regarding the terms of the Kodak agreement prior to its sale of shares on April
18, 2013 (click here). Lastly, on May 21, 2013, the SEC received a letter highlighting
probable Regulation FD violations by Uni-Pixel with regard to selective disclosures (click
here).


Some investors dismiss investor complaints to the SEC based on an outdated and jaded
view that the SEC only acts after a fraud is revealed, so we decided to try to determine
whether the SEC was taking the allegations of securities violations seriously. To check
this, we filed a request with the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to see
the correspondences they have had with Uni-Pixel since the start of the year. This is what
they said in their response to our FOIA request (full SEC letter here):

"After consulting with SEC staff, we have determined to withhold non-public records that
may be responsive to your request, under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(NYSE:A), 17 CFR §
200.80(b) (7)(NYSE:I). This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law
enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere
with enforcement activities."


While we are not securities lawyers, our opinion after reading the letter from the SEC is
that Uni-Pixel is probably under investigation by the SEC. While the language in the
response letter does not say an SEC investigation is certain, it is highly suggestive. The
fact that Uni-Pixel did not disclose any language in their most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings
regarding any open SEC investigations or inquiries indicates to us that this is probably a
new investigation by the SEC. If this is true, it is most likely very bad news for both Uni-
Pixel and its investors. We have confidence that the SEC will not sit idly by and let this
apparent stock promotion spiral out of control and risk leaving egg on the SEC's face after
it received numerous warnings about these bad actors. We think Bernie Madoff was
enough bad press for the SEC. In our opinion, the gig is almost up.


History of fooling investors with dubious technologies


That Uni-Pixel may be under investigation by the SEC should not be a surprise to anyone
who has conducted even a cursory review into the backgrounds of the executives. We
know others have touched upon this, but we think that it is worth going into just how
untrustworthy we believe the management team is. Long investors point to the executives
and say they're credible people. However, a series of simple internet searches reveals that
it's a list of characters that have been involved in multiple scams and have connections to
other scam artists.


CTO Robert Petcavich is front and center on Uni-Pixel, and everything we know about him
suggests he has a history of parting otherwise trusting investors from their money. His
biography is filled with development stage companies in emerging industries that never
panned out despite raising millions from investors. Over the course of his career, he's
worked on biodegradable plastics, implantable RFID chips, animal neutraceuticals, fruit
shelf life extension technology, and even biotech.


The pitch at every one of his companies is the same. Bob Petcavich promotes a
breakthrough technology that he invented at a fraction of the cost of existing technologies.
It's so great that he's willing to let you in on it if you just invest a few million dollars.

The following Los Angeles Times article from September 29, 1992 is a great example
(click here). The article states, "Petcavich now acknowledges that the demonstration was
more of a circus sideshow than proof that his proprietary technology represented a viable
way to reduce waste. But the sideshow/press conference drew the desired attention from
potential investors and customers."


Despite the show, Bob Petcavich was able to raise $2.4 million from 50 private investors.
From 1992 to 2002, Bob Petcavich ran Planet Polymer Technologies, the company
referred to in the Los Angeles Times article. Under his leadership, the company
continually switched product ideas, ranging from recycling and packing products to fruit
coatings. Petcavich and Planet Polymer Technologies were even sued by a director and
fundraiser. In that lawsuit, the director accused Petcavich of having knowledge that a
technology would not work while at the same time pitching it to investors. The former
director also alleged that Bob Petcavich tried to buy his silence with shares in another
company Petcavich founded named A-Life Medical.


Want more? We think his latest venture is especially curious. Start at the 11:00 mark of the
video (click here).


It's important to note this was filmed in August 2011. The date was confirmed to us by the
producer. This overlaps with Bob's tenure at Uni-Pixel. While Bob was busy revolutionizing
the touch panel industry at Uni-Pixel, Bob tinkered in his kitchen and developed a
miraculous way of extracting oil sands for "one fourth to one eighth the cost of existing
extraction technologies" (12:50 mark) in only 15 seconds.


If you've been duped into thinking Uni-Pixel is a great investment, you should seriously
consider his oil sands venture. Those who are interested may be in luck, because in the
video he mentions he's looking for $2 million in funding.


If you think this is a one off, let us point you to a presentation from 2009 from a conference
titled "Energy and Clean Technology Elevator Pitches." (Click here for the link) Once
you're on the website, click on the presentation on AquaOil from Bob Petcavich to listen to
the 90 second audio file, or click here for the mp3. Again, this was while Bob was working
at Uni-Pixel. Again, Bob has developed a breakthrough technology in a fast growing field.
This time, he claims he can grow gasoline in aquatic plants. It seems like Bob Petcavich
has become quite an expert in oil while he led Uni-Pixel's UniBoss initiative.


Oh, and as indicated in the clip, Bob just needs $3 million to develop this renewable,
biofuel, aquatic gasoline technology.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514642-uni-pixel-is-the-sec-investigating 4/59


Bob Petcavich isn't the only Uni-Pixel executive with a checkered past. CFO Jeff Tomz
was previously CFO of Isolagen, an aesthetic procedure company that ultimately
collapsed in a tangled web of lies, failure, and stock fraud. Isolagen had a wrinkle-
reducing product that never really worked despite enormous promises. In a class action
lawsuit filed against Jeff Tomz and other Isolagen executives, shareholders alleged that
the company misrepresented the efficacy of its product and probability of success. The
lawsuit said that even though Isolagen knew its product would not gain regulatory
approval in the US and was failing commercially in the UK, Isolagen executives withheld
this information from the market and issued stock and bonds to shareholders.


Meanwhile, executives cashed out of millions of dollars' worth of stock through secondary
issuances and privately negotiated transactions. In June 2004, after a significant increase
in share price, Isolagen raised $61 million of gross proceeds. As part of the greenshoe,
insiders sold $7 million worth of stock. Then in November 2004, Isolagen issued a $90
million convertible note and used $26 million of the proceeds to purchase shares from
insiders and other unnamed parties at privately negotiated prices. All in all, Isolagen
raised $151 million from the public markets while insiders dumped $17 million of stock at
the same exact time.


Soon after the capital raises, Isolagen announced its aesthetic product failed, and it later
revealed that Isolagen had made little progress on its highly touted ACE System, even
though it had repeatedly and publicly promised that it was in the "final stages" of
development.


In September 2006, shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Jeff Tomz and other
executives. Isolagen ultimately settled the class action lawsuit in 2008 and soon thereafter
filed for bankruptcy. Here's a link to the lawsuit and settlement:


Isolagen Class Action Lawsuit


Isolagen Settlement Notice


Of the $151 million raised, investors recovered only $4.4 million. That's less than a 3%
recovery.


While the settlement was paltry, it wasn't because the shareholders' case had no merit.
We spoke to the lead lawyer in the case at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman LLP. He
said Isolagen essentially had no assets remaining and all that was left was D&O
insurance. They settled because the D&O policy was the company's last remaining asset
of any value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514642-uni-pixel-is-the-sec-investigating 5/59


You can read the lawsuit and claim Jeff Tomz was just a bit player in this. After all, he
wasn't a founding member of Isolagen and only sold $208,989 worth of stock. You can try
to argue that he wasn't one of the bad apples. However, before be joined Isolagen in
2001, Tomz was a Principal at Benchmark Equity Capital from 1999-2001. Isolagen's
largest shareholder was Frank DeLape. Frank was part of a group that gained control of
Isolagen in 2001 and during the period of the class action lawsuit, he personally sold $5
million of stock and was one of the insiders who sold shares to Isolagen using proceeds
from the $90 million convertible. Frank DeLape is founder, CEO, and Chairman of
Benchmark. He clearly had a prior relationship to Jeff and likely brought him to Isolagen.


It is also important to note that Frank DeLape is co-founder, ex-CEO, and ex-Chairman of
the Board of Uni-Pixel. In fact, he hired Jeff Tomz in 2004 and brought Tomz into Uni-Pixel
after Tomz left Isolagen. Frank DeLape also hired Reed Killion.


What do we know about Reed Killion? A review into Uni-Pixel's history shows that during
his tenure as CEO of Uni-Pixel, Reed has been responsible for numerous failures and
zero successful product launches. Others have pointed this out, but it's worth repeating.
As CEO, he is responsible for Uni-Pixel's failed TMOS, Opcuity, and Diamond Guard
products. Each product came with big promises of commercialization, yet resulted in no
significant revenues. None of these products were ever even introduced into the
marketplace. He is also responsible for missing numerous financial forecasts. The worst
example is when Reed guided to $6 million in Diamond Guard revenues in 2011, slashed
that target mid-way through the year, and ultimately delivered less than $200,000 in total
revenues. Lastly, Reed has signed and touted numerous agreements, partnerships, and
development deals with companies like Samsung, Avery Dennison, and Texas
Instruments. However, none of these agreements have produced any commercial
products.


Would you want to be an investor in a company associated with Frank DeLape, Jeff Tomz,
Bob Petcavich, and Reed Killion?


Amazingly, it doesn't stop there. The story behind Uni-Pixel's executives gets even better.
The current Chairman of Uni-Pixel is Bernard Marren. He has been a CEO or Director at
four companies (Opti Inc., Western Micro Technologies, Infocus, and Mondowave) that all
experienced significant declines in their stock prices and are now either bankrupt,
liquidating, or worthless penny stocks. If history is any indication, should investors trust his
leadership at Uni-Pixel?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514642-uni-pixel-is-the-sec-investigating 6/59


As if this isn't bad enough, there is also the bizarre. A Barron's article on Uni-Pixel from
May 11, 2013 highlighted the unusual beliefs of Martin Selbrede. The article can be found
here. Martin is the former chief scientist at Uni-Pixel and inventor of TMOS, which was the
first technology that Uni-Pixel tried to commercialize. The Barron's reporter wrote that
Martin Selbrede has been associated with geocentrism, which is the belief that the Sun
revolves around the Earth. We dug a little further into Martin's background and discovered
that he has no college level degree. Is it any wonder that TMOS failed?


This begs the question, "What type of person would hire these people?" The CEO hired
these people when even a simple internet search reveals their checkered pasts. We're
shocked by the lack of judgment in hiring the executives at Uni-Pixel. If you were a CEO of
a company, would you hire a CTO who has never successfully developed and
commercialized a product? Would you hire a CFO who was the subject of a class action
lawsuit by investors and resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement?


This makes us ask, "Were these people hired despite their past, or were they hired
because of their past and ability to dupe investors?" More importantly, would you as a
shareholder put your money in his hands?


Uni-Pixel is a short at any price


We believe that this article provides compelling proof that Uni-Pixel is run by an
untrustworthy management team and our prior article shows that the technology doesn't
work. In a few weeks, we intend to expose the company's dodgy accounting and after that
we don't think you will trust their financials any longer either.


Uni-Pixel supporters always point to the agreements with a major PC maker (supposedly
Dell Inc. (DELL)), Ecosystem Partner (supposedly Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)), and Eastman
Kodak as proof that Uni-Pixel is real this time. Uni-Pixel's supporters argue that these
rumored partners would not have signed agreements and given Uni-Pixel millions of
dollars unless the products worked. We find this logic to be faulty and extremely
dangerous. If these executives from Uni-Pixel can repeatedly fool sophisticated investors
out of millions of dollars with their lies and promises, why can't they pull the wool over the
eyes of executives at technology companies? What makes them so different? We've
caught on that it isn't different this time, and soon enough we expect that the SEC will
catch on as well and properly put an end to this nonsense.


In our previous write up, we put out a fair value target of $3. We now think that's too
generous and would be short Uni-Pixel at any price. This company has never generated
substantial sales from its products. The only meaningful revenues we have been able to

identify were the one-time non-recurring engineering fee it received last quarter. It is our
expectation that Uni-Pixel will never generate meaningful revenues and that it will burn
through all of its cash. Accordingly, our price target is now zero.


This is a company led by a management team with a history of failure and fraud.
Moreover, we believe Uni-Pixel may soon be exposed by an SEC investigation. Tick-tock.

You said the "Thousand Words" piece was excellent too. Wow. We all know the many fallacies of that article
also.


I can't believe this article starts with references to the other after all exposed it & the sad turbulence from it.
Then this AGAIN claims "When we consulted with experts in the touch screen industry who had tested
UniBoss". He means the particularly selected "experts", & those who were testing the broken old sample.
Then those photos? On & on. I don't have hours to elaborate on the wrongfulness of the old, nor this home-

For the other side of the coin on Petcavich and Marren, read this:

as far as the headline goes, how could the SEC not be investigating? the headline doesn't say "SEC
enforcement action imminent," rather just points out the obvious and backs it up with an interesting response
to a FOIA request.

Author’s reply »  I think that the article title was entirely justified by the content of the FOIA response letter I
received. We can agree to disagree on this.

Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Except you left out this part from the FOIA response letter:


""Accordingly, the assertion of this exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or
its staff that any violations of law have occurred or as a reflection upon any person, entity, or security".

Lee Church
I don't care one way or the other, but I just read the letter you cited and it's not clear to me who they would be
investigating. For example, it may be that they are investigating the folks writing articles about them; the letter
doesn't say one way or the other.


Given your negative bias, i'm sure you feel it's about the company.


I would caution you to challenge your own evidence. Listen to charlie munger's 1995 harvard lecture on
misjudgement. Do you find where the fallacy in your reasoning is mentioned?


It's one of the ways that folks like Charlie Munger (and Buffett) are good investors, they don't take data and
interpret it in a friendly way.


I have no interest in discussing this matter further than to say I thought your misjudgement (whether you are
right or wrong seems largely a matter of chance to me, not sound analysis) to put your thinking in the
speculative rather than an investment.


Good luck to all interested parties (especially the SEC - I would not want their job for ANYTHING).

I find it strange that your "a picture is worth a thousand words" article used pictures which had had the exif data
stripped from them. Meaning, there was no way to prove when or where they were taken. One would think, with
concrete proof that a stock was worth shorting, exif data would have remained embedded in the "damning" images.


Similarly, the links in this article provide no real corroboration the points made within. The UNXL pumpers and UNXL
shorters seem to be two sides of the same untrustworthy, biased coin.

"Metadata" captured when pictures are taken by a cell phone or the vast majority of digital cameras. Contains
information such as file size (in pixels), date and time the picture was taken, etc. If the device taking the
picture possesses GPS capabilities, and location features are enabled, the location the picture was taken
(usually in lat/long) is also embedded.


There was an article regarding Blackberry sales in which the author presented pictures of huge lines at UK
stores. I had the same doubts with his article, so I checked his pictures. Surprisingly, the exif data backed up
everything he said - the pictures had been taken that morning, in the UK. With your article? All the data has
been stripped.


Note that my position in UNXL is ridiculously small; this is one of my "might as well throw some money at it in
case it explodes" stock. In reading your article(s), I am given no compelling reasons to change my mind. As
much as SA authors and contributors talk up the legality of what they do on this site, this is a blog, and
journalistic integrity does not apply. Without hard evidence, everything - from both sides - must be taken as
hearsay.

I agree, the whole thing about the first two pics in that article having exif data which includes GPS coordinates
is very fishy, especially since the other photos have very limited exif data and no GPS coordinates, and one
photo - the "broken line" photo which is arguably the most damning - has ALL of the exif data completely
stripped! If all of those pics were taken at the same time with the same camera during a visit to Uni-Pixel, then
they would all have the same exif data.


And anybody knows that exif data can be easily edited in Photoshop or just about any other photo editing
software. Take a very close look at the exif data from the first pic in that article and you will see that it has a
"last modified" date of 3/21/2013, and the version of the program used to modify the file was "6.0.1".
Hmmm....guess which popular photo-editiing software has a version 6.0.1? Yup, photoshop. You don't use
photoshop to simply crop or rotate pictures, you use it to materially edit them, such as editing their exif data.


I also find it odd that all of the exif data is present in the first two pictures except for one obvious bit - the
camera make & model. Why is that odd? Well, the fact that the pic supposedly has embedded GPS
coordinates would indicate that it was either take with a cell phone (most of which have geo-tagging) or a
fairly new compact or SLR camera which has built-in GPS. And any camera that I have owned in the past 10
years since before geo-tagging started (which has to be 30+; I'm a photo hobbyist) will list the camera make &
model in the exif data. Yet that is somehow missing from those pics. Incriminating evidence? Hardly. Buy very
suspicious since it further points to the fact that the exif data was most likely added/modified.


The other interesting thing is the date that the picture was edited with Photoshop - 3/21/2013 at 2:17. In the
article on 5/31 when those pictures were posted, the author mentioned that a few weeks prior he had written
an article questioning why Kodak had never disclosed a K-8 article regarding their partnership with UniPixel,
and it was his deduction that it was probably because Kodak didn't think much of Uni-Pixel's technology. Yet
in that article on 5/19 he didn't make any mention of having visited their facilities or having sampled or tested
the product first hand to know it doesn't work, which I'm sure he would have mentioned if it had taken place 2

months prior and was such damning evidence. That article simply focused on the author's suspicion due to
the lack of a K-8 filing. So one would obviously make the assumption that the visit must have taken place at
some point between the article dated 5/19 and the follow-up one dated 5/31, right? Well then how do you
explain a picture with a date of 3/21 which he claimed to have obtained while at the Uni-Pixel facility? And
let's not forget that only the first two pics even have dates in them, the others do not. And oh how I WISH that
the pic showing the phone in the background with a time of 2:12 had a date stamp, because 1) if the date was
the same as the first pic, then he obviously couldn't be at Uni-Pixel taking pics at 2:12 and then editing them
with Photoshop 2:17; and 2) if the date was later than 3/21 then it would prove that the pics were not taken at
the same time as claimed in the article. Either way, having a date in that pic with the phone showing the time
would be extremely incriminating, so maybe that's why he removed it from the exif data.


Bottom line: I don't trust a single word that was said in that article with the pictures, and this one isn't much
more convincing. Maybe the SEC's statement of not wanting to disclose any information for legal reasons was
just their way of giving you the bird and telling you that they don't have to give you sh*t if they don't want to.

Author’s reply »  You can believe whatever you like, but I know for a fact that the pictures in my prior article
were not manipulated or otherwise faked in any way. As regards the timing of my articles, you are correct that
I have lots of information on the company and that not all of it gets released at once. For instance, I have
some pretty damning stuff about their financials but it's not covered in this article, just like my photos weren't
in my first article. If you think the SEC's statement is meaningless, that is your conclusion. My opinion is that
the SEC is investigating Uni-Pixel and there is a reasonable chance that it results in an enforcement action.

That's fine, I can understand how you might have this treasure-trove of information and may not want to
disclose it all at once. After all, disclosing everything all at once would probably just cause a small drop in
price which would most likely be unsustained. But if you slowly leak all of this "evidence" then that will cause a
slow and steady decline in price, and it will tarnish many people's opinions of the company due to the
repeated bad press. I can understand that strategy as a short, because it woks the same way for longs.


But you still fail to defend your most incriminating evidence - the pictures - in any way other than just giving us
your word that they weren't altered. I mean come on, at this point we all know they were altered in some way
because you can clearly see that they were cropped, enlarged, written on ("Broken line"), exif data
altered/removed, and some even show Photoshop as the program that was used to alter them! So how can
you say that they were not manipulated?? It's as clear as day! Now, I suppose you could still defend yourself
by saying that they were not manipulated in a malicious way, that they were simply resized and edited for

One more thing... I decided to actually read the FOIA letter that you posted, and it states the following:


"Accordingly, the assertion of this exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff
that any violations of law have occurred or as a reflection upon any person, entity, or security".


And yet, that is exactly the whole point of your article.


21 Jun 2013, 11:15 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I think it's pretty much a given that there is an investigation. If there wasn't, then the SEC
would not have been allowed to refuse my FOIA request under the exemption 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A), 17
CFR § 200.80(b) (7)(I). As they state "This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law
enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement
activities"

I am pretty sure that an SEC investigation would be a material event requiring disclosure by the company,
something I have not seen.


And, spite of the somewhat ambiguous language in this letter, I am also pretty sure that the SEC cannot
disclose to the general public that an ongoing investigation is even being conducted on a company.


Also, you provide no proof that this letter was actually written by the SEC and sent to you.

Alpha, very interesting work and digging on UNXL's executives - It clearly showed that "apples don't fall far
from the tree."


From my perspective, after reading what the SEC stated in terms of "for law enforcement purposes", it may
seem to suggest that the SEC choose to stand by, while the law enforcement is doing their job.


In any event, it is highly unusual to have a disclosure like that from the SEC. I want to say, "Wow. What a turn

A clue to those who wonder who the "we" may be that Seth/Allpha speaks about:

Neither Seth/Alpha nor Citron Research have provided any evidence that this letter was even sent to the SEC.

Ridiculous assertion based on standard response to requests about investigations. The SEC couldn't respond

easy to figure out that the SEC is probably investigating Uni-Pixel.

The assertion by the hit piece author (who by the way used photoshop for his first hit piece) that the SEC is
investigating the company based upon the SEC's reply to his request is beyond laughable. The SEC language is
standard protocol. He suggests that Intel, Kodak and Dell have all been fooled. LOL. What he IS capitalizing on is the
shady backgrounds of some of the characters involved. All that said, if they meet the numbers that Kodak & Uni-Pixel
projected, you're looking at well over a $100 stock next year. When it was pointed out yesterday that $14 puts expiring
today were being snagged left and right (gee, what a coincidence), obviously a hit piece was on the way. Too many
weak retailers involved in the stock right now. I've spoken with all the tutes involved here and they've done their

What a fallacy of logic being applied here by this author. Because an FOIA request isn't granted, then there must be
something wrong in the case of UNXL. So by that extension every FOIA that isn't granted means that there is illicit
activity under investigation every time? Just another hit piece on another company that has become a regular activity
for this rag and its network of authors.


21 Jun 2013, 12:21 PM


Paulo Santos, Marketplace Contributor
The FOIA request is far from being the only argument - did you read the entire piece and look at the letters
sent to the SEC?


It really takes a lot of faith and denial to believe in UNXL at this point.


21 Jun 2013, 12:25 PM


mfm401kvp
I did read the piece. It is impossible to read the other letters since they are completely redacted when it
comes to naming sources and other pertinent information that is the basis for the requests. If this author and
his group is so sure, then why hide their proof from the public? How about an FOIA request to them to issue
their letters without redaction? And why hide and not reveal their true name/identity? When one makes claims
like this have the intestinal fortitude to stand up instead of hiding. Honestly I don't care about this particular
issue because I have no vested interest in the outcome since I am not invested, but it just reeks of the
problem with the markets today.

General boilerplate language. Similar to your complaints about Regulation FD issues that you complained
about. Any regulatory agency should be always investigating/monitoring those organizations subject to its
oversight. Why do you think the SEC does unannounced walk in audits? Totally specious argument on your
part.


21 Jun 2013, 01:52 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We have a different interpretation of the same letter. This is what makes a market.


May I suggest that you file some FOIA requests that you both know will and will not be fulfilled and see what
comes back? For instance, you could ask for last year's annual report from GM in one request and for all the
files related to the SEC's ongoing investigation into EBIX in another request. I suspect if you file enough FOIA
requests, you will soon enough see replies such as that which I received are quite uncommon and more often
than not are due to an open investigation.

pour over the sec filing, send inquiry to custodian and broker dealer firms, match trades, detect pattern, and
make a list of possible violation then charge them on violation.

Stop using fear tactics. They're completely different from UniPixel. UniPixel actually has a quality product that
Intel recommends. You can watch the video of Uni-Boss working flawlessly on the UniPixel website. Doesn't
seem like fraud to me. Find me one NEW company that has quality products that big companies recommend
and would like to work with, that has gone bankrupt.

I'd be catuious about this company if Intel, and Kodak didn't recommend them. I think Intel engineers know
best about a sophisticated product like the Uni-Boss and it is faulty or has problems. We can see that it is
definitely not a scam with them updating the website every other day and posting videos of the Uni-Boss
product. I have faith in the company since the website has been debunking every false allegation that bashers
have made about their company and their products. Uni-Pixel has a significant amount of experience and
have worked with CIT back around 1997. Isn't CIT suing them? Sounds to me like they're threatened by Uni-
Pixels capabilities. They wouldn't be making these major strides by going to conferences all over the world
and presenting the Uni-Boss and giving speeches if they were a fraud. They wouldn't have been invited by
Intel at the Intel Developer Forum to give a speech if they were a fraud. You nitpick throughout this entire
article and find as many flaws to particular management as you can. but I can find a company and do the
same thing for some individuals in their management too with a little bit of research.

." If these executives from Uni-Pixel can repeatedly fool sophisticated investors out of millions of dollars with their lies
and promises, why can't they pull the wool over the eyes of executives at technology companies?"


You say that Intel and Dell executives that have hundread of engineers and laboratory was put wool over eyes from
unipixel?

Ever hear of Konarka and Ascent Solar? They both managed to fool investors, who presumably consult with
experts and engineers, to raise hundreds of millions of capital which they then lost in failed lab-to-market
ventures. It happens all the time.


22 Jun 2013, 05:07 PM


Andrew Colburn, Contributor
Konarka wasn't a scam. The investors invested in the developing technology because it had promise. The
downside to their product was a very short lifespan and a lack of polymers that would only convert a fraction
of sunlight over the current solar panels. Again, investors and engineers invested in Konarka for the great
potential and pliability (that is arguablly still there as new polymers are lab created). It had nothing to do with
fooling investors or engineers as your claiming.


23 Jun 2013, 04:13 PM

Fooling investors isn't the same thing as fooling Intel Engineers. I'm sorry but that was a terrible comparison.
Was Ascent Solar recommended by fortune 100 company experts?

As per my conversation with UNXL IR, they deny that they are being investigated by the SEC. IR stated that if the
SEC were investigating them actively, the SEC would be required to notify the company, which they have not done.


In addition, they state that there has been no change at all in regards to having products delivered in Q4.


Have a nice day.

Author’s reply »  Ask them if the company has received any correspondence from the SEC this year and, if it
has, why the correspondence has not yet been filed on EDGAR. This is a much better question than asking
about an investigation since I don't think the SEC needs to tell an issuer that an inquiry has progressed to an
investigation. Better yet, read the FOIA response. It's damning.

been invited to present at company specific technology events.

Would you say that if you were bullish/long & hoping to see your investment rise again after crashing for NO
reason but rumors? Don't think sooo.


22 Jun 2013, 09:22 AM


Steel Reserve, Contributor
What's your concern exactly? On June 21 at 12:49 p.m. in response to another post you wrote: "Only wish I
had more funds left for this great buy opportunity." And yes, if I were long in this stock (I have no investment
in it either way) and I saw this article, I would bail out for the following reasons: 
1) Dell? Intel? Who knows? Exact terms of the Kodak deal? Impossible to say;  
2) Significant profits/earnings? Company has none;3) Cash flow? Only seems to come from selling stock; 
4) I believe the "short case" made by Citron, this author, and others on this forum is more compelling given
the facts than the "long case".


You can disagree all you want and I look forward to your response. That's what makes this a good forum.  
People who complain about short sellers always puzzle me. We don't complain about rain, snow, and cold
where I live because its a fact of life that isn't going to change no matter what. There are plenty of warm,
sunny/partly cloudy days that offset the bad weather so on balance we make out ok. Hope your portfolio is
balanced with other investments to offset your losses in UNXL.


Short selling is a fact of life. In my opinion, people like Jim Chanos, John Paulson, Andrew Left, and the
author of this piece perform a valuable service to me by presenting a side to an investment that while not
pleasant, usually has a direct bearing on the actual worth of that investment. I never make an investment
without checking to see if the company at issue is the target of short sellers.

the other $5 mil says something.


You say you follow your bigtime short heroes - Andrew Left & his lawsuits from attacks of that China co.?
John Paulson wiki "In 2011, he made losing trades in Bank of America, Citigroup, and the fraud-suspected
China-based Canadian-listed company, Sino-Forest Corporation. His flagship fund, Paulson Advantage Fund,
was down over 40% as of September 2011. He made a fortune in gold = which he did not short that one.


Without any real bad news on UNXL, all is the the same as when at $36/share. In fact, there has been
substantial good news, like receiving the $5 mil, facilities expansions, product improvement as seen in at the
Computex Show in Taipei( as guests of Intel?) where all handled it (after Cowen & all did too), & more.


Yes, I bought more to average down at each sad(for me) "buy op." just to try to break even, then see how
long I'll hold it to gain based on REAL news, not pure crap/agendas. Based on the info at hand, if real, which
at this point there is NO reason to doubt all, I was really shocked to see ANY stock get bashed to a haircut of
65% or so on pure bad-mouthing & fear.


Yes, shorting is a fact of life, & is fine & good if the stock is pure bs, & an inflated rip-off like many bio-
pharmas, etc.. & deserves a bashing haircut, but this doesn't seem to be one of them at this point in time.
Only positive items & one product delay out of their control by ANOTHER co.


But IMHO only, it's sickening & un-American like, to trash-bash over nothing but greed, fellow American
companies that truly seek to build & market an innovative product or service, thus keeping money in the US,
& not China, etc. I would have never started my small company if I would have thought that greedy investors
were gonna short & bad-mouth it over agendas, till I had nothing after all that personal life & monetary
sacrifice, blood, & sweat. The shorting game has gotten even worse & all know it. Call me an old redneck if
want, but with that motivation, let's just give up the "American Spirit" that built this country, & go freakin' work
for China or India, ok.


For my UNXL, I'm just waitin' for the ruthless attacks to diminish, & the pump show & real good news to begin.
Good luck to you regardless brother.

Good morning mi amigo Paulo. Thank you for your reply & suggestion. I hope that is not the case & IMHO do
NOT believe that it is for any reason! I believe you are intelligent & a good writer, but you have more sided
with the shorts it appears in challenging each & every "good news" item. Or that's your journalistic angle on
this stock for nothing more than you believe is truth. Fine.


But I have seen absolutely NO evidence to think what you said is for real. I worry every once in awhile from
the fear-pushers panic, but I have over-invested & regardless to that, stand firm in my belief that what this
stock has suffered, is nothing more than an short-based crash job. Especially when articles (that even you
supported) come out like "the pic & Thousand Words" one, filled with very slanted fallacies & old news proven
wrong.


IMO only, to date, there has been much more truth provided from the people at UNXL, etc., THAN what all the
shorts have been claiming. You can say the same about any company. Shorting is like taking candy from a
baby-easy. We will all see more of the un-biased real truth as time goes on, either way.


I really do respect everyones' (unbiased) opinions, but like the famous quote:


"Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but NOT their own facts."


Thanks.


23 Jun 2013, 12:11 PM


Paulo Santos, Marketplace Contributor
goody, whatever you think on the subject, there are more than many reasons to think the company might be a
scam. From the actors, to those promoting it, to events, a lot of stuff points in that direction.


So, taking this into account, do not over-expose yourself to this particular equity. You need to consider the
downside. Would it affect your life if the stock went near $0? If it would, you should scale down to a level
where it wouldn't.

Thanks Paulo. But the same could be said about any new company. People can also say the Pope is really a
Baptist. Until I see evidence or wrong-doing, which I haven't, I will stick with the real news as it comes forth,
whatever the outcome. So far, I see nothing tangent that the crashers have provided other than opinions,
distortions, lies, & past lives with character assaults. On the other hand, the positive ones have provided great
support with tangible facts. Thanks for the advice though...I won't sell NUAN, HD, or APPL to buy more of this
without real news, good or bad. I have too much percentage at stake in this "crashed fiesta over pure rumors

Paulo Santos, Marketplace Contributor
It's all about the odds, goody. Even if you personally don't think there's wrongdoing, you cannot ascribe a
100% chance to there being no wrongdoing. So you need to think about how it would affect you if, indeed,
there was wrongdoing.


It's called a "stress test". How would you do in that scenario? How would you handle it? After doing such a
scenario, you should size your position in such a way that it becoming reality wouldn't have a significant
impact on your life.


In short: you don't need to believe it will happen, to have to take the chance into account.


The way you speak, you sound like you're "all in" on the stock. That's why I am saying this, as "all in" here is
clearly not called for.


23 Jun 2013, 01:03 PM

Of course. I'm not ALL in...just over my comfort level percentage wise. All is as I previously stated.


I won't sell till am sure the "Tokyo Roses'" are speaking the truth, finally. So far they are assuming & trashin'
for an agenda. Of course, all of the market is a gamble if you are a small fish like me, with all of the sharks in
the water. It's hard to tell who works for who, & for how long.

What people like the Author understand is that all that matters is the smear. It doesn't matter that its a lie or shady
half-truth. All people will remember is the constant pounding into their minds that these accusations exist. Absent of
any real proof. Absent of any real sources with names.


21 Jun 2013, 02:02 PM


Paulo Santos, Marketplace Contributor
The sources with names went into the SEC letters. If those doubts regarding the Kodak deal weren't real,
then UNXL would quickly put them to bed.


It's clear that they are real - that UNXL sold 1/2 of the Uniboss franchise for $12 million or so. What does that
tell you?


To me it tells me that Uniboss is not being produced and UNXL had the hope that Kodak might be able to
produce it, so had not problems in parting with 1/2 of nothing expecting to perhaps get a viable product in
return.

This is what I believe as well. Furthermore, when you listen to the last conference in which Unipixel
executives were asked about the details of the Kodak deal, you can almost feel they are setting the stage for
a bombshell revelation. Unipixel needs Kodak. Kodak doesn't need Unipixel. It's not rocket science who
usually gets the better end of the deal in situations like this.


Didn't Unipixel executives say something to the affect that what Kodak brings them would cost them over
100mil if they did on their own?


And why has Kodak not filed any SEC docs regarding the Unipixel deal. They are required to file docs for
anything that is materially significant. Maybe Unipixel considers this way more materially significant than
Kodak?

Pete in NY,


That "sold 1/2 of Uniboss" is a twisted view of the Kodak deal. There are few real facts of the deal available
but the shorts present it as fact, just like all the FUD they publish (http://bit.ly/J4A7Zt)


We know there is revenue sharing in the Kodak deal and that it is 'up to 50%' going to Kodak for that fraction
of the product that Kodak produces in Rochester. It is likely a tiered structure IMO that gives them up to 50%
on the first tranche of product (to provide Kodak with capital to promote UniBoss capacity expansion), and
steps down as production ramps up to higher tranches.

First I get criticized for waiting to publish my photos until I complete my expert checks and then I get criticized

Hmmmn...Ok, sorry, but you say you just received the SEC letter Wed. which was a huge basis of your

I love how everyone assumes that Seth's expose on the faulty UniBoss sample was proven to be a 'fraud'?? Proven
where? In whose mind? Proven by repeating it over and over again in the comments section until people begin to
assume the 'fraud-is-a-fraud' allegations are true? I haven't seen any independent review that would convince me that
the photos were doctored and apparently a lot of legal firms are willing to stake their own credibility on their
authenticity.


I wonder what your qualifications for determining an SEC fraud-fraud are?

" apparently a lot of legal firms are willing to stake their own credibility on their authenticity." 
LMAO, what a oxymoron 
You mean the same legal firms that file lawsuits against company directors if a company DECLINES a
buyout. And IN THE SAME BREATH, the same legal firms who file the same boilerplate lawsuit against
company directors if they ACCEPT a buyout!  
You apparently have a naïve view of law firms.


22 Jun 2013, 04:41 AM


Mukticat
If you think law firms are corrupt what do you say about the third-tier underwriters like Roth or Cowen or
Thalberg who raise capital for the UNXLs of the world and lo and behold always rate them a Buy with some
ludicrous price target? Apparently none of you were assailing the price targets being passed around for UNXL
as being corrupt and self-interested.

And Goldman downgrades with such ridiculous price targets to induce capitulation so they can buy into the
panic. So what's your point??? 
Do you actually think even FIRST-TIER SELLSIDE FIRMS are ethical and legal?? Haha, YOU really are a

buyside clients send business elsewhere?

22 Jun 2013, 04:38 PM

Did you run a bunch of ideas and feelings through a blender and just spill the contents out because what you
wrote makes no sense in context of what I wrote.


Does it follow that because I believe that bottom fishers like Cowen and company are in the business of
selling ratings for underwriting deals that I must believe that the so-called top tier sell-side firms are therefore
honest? Are you an complete fool?? Shorts take note of all forms of corruptions unlike the longs who often
seem to dwell in some sort of Pollyanna world where corruption - if it occurs - is mostly limited to, naturally,
shorts.


I don't have a full service broker and I can't imagine how you would think I would. Does any active trader? I've
outperformed the S&P by 20% in beta ytd. Absolute return is a work in progress given that the markets are up
14% ytd but on ave my returns run about 30% annually (beta) over the last 14 years.

bullchin, in my experience it's rare very indeed the stock that warrants - and maintains - the multi-bagger kind
of runup that UNXL underwent.


Shorting isn't 'easy' but I prefer looking for the odd company among the thousands that pops out because it
was pumped than to try to anticipate which among the thousands to go long because it's going to be a future
winner. I find the rearview mirror can be surprisingly accurate.

No, what I say to you is that the reason offerings are always accompanied by Buy recommendations is
obvious - the company is selling shares and investors are buying them. Do you think a company would offer
shares through an underwriter whose analyst would not rate the shares a Buy? Underwriters whose analysts
don't rate a given company's shares a Buy don't become underwriters of that particular issue.


The real question is, do the analysts' Buy ratings on stock offerings accurately reflect their opinions - their
honest opinions? It is more likely today that Buy ratings are honest than it was before Sarbanes Oxley

The problem with SA is that when the articles fill up with comments it's hard to tell who's responding to what
(where's the thread?). That said I'll assume it was me and I'll take a whack at this-


Buysider are you saying that the reason companies always get a Buy rating from their underwriters is
because the underwriters won't take their business unless they strongly believe in the stock? Really?? They'll
just walk away from their 7% commission and wait until a company they really believe in knocks? Does
Easter bunny or tooth fairy mean anything to you.


At least you qualify this pollyannish belief with the 'more likely' to be honest than before Sarb-Ox in 2002.
That's a pretty low standard the pre-2002 and nothing I've seen has changed my opinion think if you buy
stocks based on what Cowen or Roth or Oppenheimer opines you're just cruisin' for a bruisin'.

No, I won't say it won't happen, Mutikat, but I'm happy you see the flaw in what you said. The firm doesn’t rate

always accompanied by Buy ratings is obvious - companies are selling shares and investors are buying,

Underwriters whose analysts do not rate a given company's shares a Buy are not asked to nor would they
underwrite that particular issue.


Believe it or not, there are numerous companies that are unable to find ANY firms on Wall Street that will
underwrite their shares. THEREFORE, the only companies whose shares are offered to the public (except for
self-underwritten issues) are those in which an analyst working for an underwriting firm is willing to rate the
stock a Buy. Those are the ONLY ones you see. You don’t see the ones the analysts don’t like, because those
offerings don’t get made. Do you comprehend now?


The real question is, do the analysts' Buy ratings on offerings reflect their honest opinions? That is more likely
to be true today than it was before Sarbanes Oxley became law in 2002, because under Sarbanes Oxley,
firms are forbidden to compensate analysts for work on underwritings, so analysts must depend on
commissions from their firm’s institutional and retail customers (the buyers of those offerings) for their salaries
and bonuses. The interest of the analyst is aligned with the firm’s investment customers now, instead of with
the firm's investment banking department, so the analyst has a strong incentive to publish ratings that reflect
his honest opinion and opinions that turn out to make money for the buyers, instead of ratings that please the
investment bankers and the investment banker’s customer, which is the company issuing the shares.


Because they are human, the analysts may not always be right, but very few are corrupt or seeking to violate
Sarbanes Oxley by publishing opinions they don’t believe in to please the firm’s investment bankers instead of
the firm’s investment customers.

investment banking clients creates a huge conflict of interest. Issuing negative research on the stocks of their
own corporate clients may cost brokerages profitable business. In other words, a brokerage firm would rather
be wrong on any buy/sell recommendation than be right and lose a corporate client.'


Exactly what I was saying. You can't trust a Buy rating especially from the lesser lights of the underwriting
world.


25 Jun 2013, 11:19 PM


Buysider2
Mukticat, that is exactly what I am saying, and unlike yourself, my statement is based on personal experience
– my experience as a sell-side analyst for more than 4 decades for 3 different investment banking and
brokerage firms, a large first-tier, major-bracket firm, an old-line, middle-sized firm, and a so-called “third-tier”
boutique.


At both the first-tier firm and the boutique, I personally refused to put a Buy rating on several prospective
offerings, which caused the firm to turn down the opportunity to underwrite those offerings (remember, it’s not
the underwriting department’s or the firm’s opinion here that matters, it’s the analyst’s opinion). However, the
conservative bankers at the old-line firm I worked for wouldn’t have dreamed of accepting the business of a
company whose stock they didn’t think was attractive, so at that firm, ratings were rarely an issue.


In at least one of those instances, the offering never got made because the company could not find a Wall
Street firm that would do the business. The reason for that is also obvious: Reputation is important, even on
Wall Street. In my experience, most of those I’ve worked with on the Street are decent, honest, hard-working
folks who cared even more about their reputations than about money, hard as that might be for you to believe.


At the firms I’ve worked for, numerous other analysts did the same – refused to recommend purchase of
prospective offerings, causing the loss of the underwriting fees for those offerings (the firms could well afford
those losses, however).


All that was before Sarbanes Oxley, but even before Sarbanes Oxley, in many firms, investment bankers and
analysts were separated in ways that reduced the chance for conflicts of interest, and analysts were protected
by top management from the understandable wrath of investment bankers whenever the analysts refused to
recommend purchase of a banking client’s securities. In the decade leading up to the dotcom boom and bust
of 2000-01, that separation diminished, which led to the scandals that resulted in Sarbanes Oxley in 2002.

Mukticat, our conversation segments are not in the correct order on this thread, a fault of the SeekingAlpha
software, I believe. Hopefully, readers will get the gist of it.


On the topic of sell-side analyst ratings that we’ve been batting back and forth, I have the advantage, I’m
afraid, because I spent more than 40 years publishing such ratings, while you have not published even one.


I said most analysts are honest, as are their opinions, and for the reasons detailed in my previous posts on
this thread, their incentives today are to please their firm’s institutional and retail investment customers,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514642-uni-pixel-is-the-sec-investigating 38/59


instead of the firm’s bankers and the bankers’ customers (the companies whose securities are underwritten
by the firm in initial or secondary offerings). Because analysts are paid by the firm’s investment customers
instead of the firm’s investment bankers and banking customers, the analysts’ incentives are to please the
investment customers by making money for them.


You offered two references from a Google search on: “what do analyst ratings mean?” The first reference
supports my view on analysts’ independence from investment banking and the second one does not. The
second one is 11 years out of date and wrong.


Your first reference, in which a long-time and successful sell-side analyst is interviewed by Kiplinger in an
article titled: “What Analyst Ratings Really Mean,” dated April 8, 2008, is accurate in most respects and backs
up what I just said almost completely. I know the analyst who was interviewed; he and I worked in the same
research department for a number of years. He’s an excellent analyst and I agree with most of what he says,
including the following:


“KIPLINGER'S: What, if anything, is different today as a result of Wall Street's 2003 legal settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that was supposed to cleanse research of its many conflicts of
interest?


MCCLELLAN: It used to be the analyst would talk to investment bankers on a daily basis and help bankers
bring in deals. Their research was very much influenced by whether they could do a big banking deal and so
on. In other words, they worked together. It was a team effort.


That direct, heavy-handed investment banking leverage and influence over analysts has very much
dissipated. Now it's very, very arms length.”


I disagree completely with the second reference you offered on this subject, which is a quote from
Investopedia. Contrary to what Investopedia said, investment banking relationships are NOT the reason there
are more buy recommendations than there should be (I’ll offer some reasons later). That is a novel theory I’ve
not heard before and demonstrably wrong, as follows:


First, the paragraph is 11 years out of date. As the analyst interviewed by Kiplinger said, the previous ties
between banking and research no longer exist (because of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002).


Second, for any industry analyst, only a small percentage of the analyst’s coverage “universe” would be
banking clients of the analyst’s firm, so whatever residual tendency there might be to favor banking clients in
assigning ratings would only apply to a small fraction of the stocks any given firm is covering. Because of that
residual tendency the analyst interviewed by Kiplinger described, institutional investors nearly always ask an
analyst if the stock they are speaking about is a banking client of the analyst’s firm, even though, under
Sarbanes Oxley, the analyst’s opinion ought to be honest and free of such conflicts of interest (nothing in this
world is perfect).


In my case, no more than 15% of the stocks I was covering at the large, major-bracket firm were banking
clients of the firm. At the other two firms, which were smaller, the percentage was even lower.


I disagree with the view that retail brokers and their clients have a hard time “decoding” the analyst rating
system. I think nearly everyone in the industry and most of their clients understand the system, as do most
5/18/2018 Uni-Pixel: Is The SEC Investigating? - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514642-uni-pixel-is-the-sec-investigating 39/59


folks posting on SeekingAlpha. No one is trying to put anything over on anyone or confuse or scam anyone
with these ratings. In my experience, nearly everyone knows what they mean.


It is sometimes confusing to clients when ratings are relative to the market, so that an analyst with a buy
rating can still be “right” if the stock goes down less than the market. There is a lot about investments that
investment advisors need to explain to clients, and that is one of them. Don’t try to simplify things too much!


Analysts are human and subject to some of the same biases and errors that infect their customers. Analysts,
by nature, tend to be too optimistic, which is one reason there are so few sell recommendations and why
analysts are often slow to say sell when a stock is dropping.


As the analyst interviewed by Kiplinger says, it is also true that in Wall Street, a Hold or Neutral rating is often
equivalent to a Sell. Analysts like to be right, so like many of us, they sometimes hedge. If they think a stock
may go down, but aren’t sure, they might use a Hold rating. That way, if it goes down, they can say they didn’t
recommend it, and if it goes up, they can say they recommended it be held.


Moreover, sell ratings can upset some customers who already own a stock, because holders sometimes
blame the analyst (the messenger) if the stock drops (and take the credit if it goes up). Sell ratings may also
hurt an analyst’s relationship with the company being rated a sell, although I used to tell companies that
complained, “If I’m wrong, you have nothing to worry about.”


And finally, analysts sometimes decline to cover stocks that deserve a sell rating. That’s because, excluding
short sellers, the audience for a sell rating is a lot smaller than the audience for a buy rating and analysts
want to spend their limited time on things that have the greatest potential return. Barring a short sale, which
most folks don’t want to do, one can’t sell something one doesn’t own (although one can avoid buying it). On
the other hand, the audience and source of potential commissions for a buy rating is every investor in the
world for which that security might be suitable.


I think you are way too harsh in your opinions of analysts. Analysts usually know a lot about the industries
they cover. What is difficult and another reason there are too many buys and not enough sells and that ratings
are often wrong, is NOT that analysts are trying to please the investment bankers, but that, as we all know, it
is difficult with even the best public information, to know which direction a stock will move.


For example, I believe it’s likely the Cowen analyst covering UNXL, knowing what he knows and has written
publicly about, believes UNXL stock will someday be worth multiples of its current price and multiples of its
$32 price in the offering Cowen underwrote on May 18. That information did not keep the stock from plunging
as low as $11.39 under the weight of the “short” report published Friday, June 21, a report that was chock full
of errors, omissions, and misinformation, in my opinion.


You asked where you can get stats on how many companies can’t find an underwriter for a capital raise. No
stats like that exist, that I know of, but anecdotally I know there are many such companies. You don’t hear
about them because there is little or no publicity on them, except where a previously announced raise gets
postponed or cancelled.


That’s all the time I have for this right now.

regulatory captured by short selling hedge funds and willing to see them as "doing their work" instead of treating them
with the same vigorous investigations as "pump and dumpers"... I make no judgement on this story.. just saying

seems to have been the article that brought all of these lawyers in. (As a Seeking Alpha author I am quite jealous).
Regardless, keep up the good work.

Hi, I think I have some excellent ideas on what stock to move on next. I also have some great ideas on we
could start using respectable financial publications to "publish' our "work". In other words, we could make a
great team. I think you have potential as we can use your name "Alpha Exposure" to carry on the momentum
to other small and mid cap companies ripe for a fall. All it takes is a few doubts. 
I know you probably rather not add any new members to the "team", but you could do more options
"positioning" while I could help you with the "investigative work".  
No disrespect, as you seem to handle multiple job titles quite well between Author, Trader, and Private

I like the earlier comment on if you call something a fraud for long enough and repeat it often enough it becomes a
fraud. Isn't that exactly what has happened with the names of Dell and Intel. Repeat them often enough and everyone
assumes that they are they are the unnamed investors in Unipixel. Can we please see a notarized document or just a
press release from either company that they, in fact, have a money interest in Unipixel?


I have personally been involved with "investigating technology" that has been introduced to a large highly regarded
tech. company. Once in a while the technology was thoroughly vetted, but many times money was invested in it
because it did have a chance of being disruptive and making a large impact, even if the idea was still in the lab. So, I
am not convinced how much investigation took place regarding Unipixel. Anyway, the $5 million dollars spent is
probably just about what 1 internally grown idea would cost to get as far as Unipixel is with its idea.


I have also been asked to look at new ideas for VCs. They just count on making a big hit every once in 10 times, if the
hit is big enough. After spending a few months looking at what Konarka had in flexible PV cells, I told my client to run,
not walk away. They did, but others threw almost $500 million at this company before it went bankrupt.


The concept that Unipixel has is good, but can it be reduced to practice? Business in micro meshes for use in touch
panels is starting to catch on. The potential is big, but the field of competitors is also large and impressive. Several
companies have already introduced product, or working prototypes, to the market. As far as we know, Unipixel's
product is not even in their customers' product development cycle yet, which normally takes 6-12 months for complete
testing before the products are released to the public. The real question is whether or not UniBoss can be made in
production volumes, at an attractive cost, with significant performances advantages and acceptable life times to
compete. Time will tell, not hype from investors or stock manipulators.

On the previous article I had posted the metadata had been altered and so were the photos (only in a much more
abbreviated form). It's nice to see that others have this know-how and have observed the same. I wonder what the
author is thinking saying the photos were not altered at all when one has an arrow and text on it! 
Additionally, to all investors I would not sell the stock based on a SEC response letter. People like Andrew Left and
Martin Schkreli to name a few, game the system. They will bombard the SEC and FDA with erroneous claims, then
tout any response them as evidence against the company. Since Andrew Left has attacked the company, I don't put it
past this crowd. Just Google Andrew Left DOJ investigation.

Thanks Andrew! All need to be investigated as well as many authors & news media. There's a lot of shady

They could make a movie on the manipulations of this stock! Shorting ought to be illegal as it motivates all to
try to cause fear, doubt, slander, & lies...worse than politics even. They will try with CAT, APPL, whatever,
then bring in the attorney bus on top of it all.


The ones that made a fortune on the smear campaign to crash it, will re-invest very soon then pump it, after
they squeezed every penny out of the crash. Wish I knew how low they would stoop. Best to go long & wait

PuppyFister,


Here is a copy of a news release from a service in Asia that talks about the use of mesh based touch panels
that is occurring NOW. I could probably find an article every few days with similar information. The first one I
saw was in early Feb. that a Taiwanese company, Young Fast, made mesh based touch panels for Lenovo
starting last Jan. Unipixel is not the king of the mesh mountain and, as a matter of fact, is being left behind
rapidly. It has already missed the design cycle for Christmas 2013. My point, as it has always been, is the
Unipixel has a good concept, but needs to prove it can be produced and then incorporated into end products.
Even when this happens, the low hanging fruit will have already been picked. It will never be a $1 billion
company. There are too many large and well funded companies out there already feasting on the touch
demand beast.


Here is the article:

Metal mesh and OGS touch panel makers battle over orders 
Siu Han, Taipei; Alex Wolfgram, DIGITIMES [Wednesday 26 June 2013] 
Thin-film touch panel makers in China and Taiwan are continuing to chase orders from notebook vendors with
their metal mesh products, which is also posing challenges for OGS makers, according to market observers. 
Additionally, the observers believe that ITO thin film is likely to be in tight supply in the second half of 2013 as
it was in the second half of 2012 due to new products from Samsung Electronics and Apple, which will push
demand for alternative touch screen materials such as metal mesh. 
J Touch will supply metal mesh touch panel products sized 5-, 10-, 13-, 15- and 19-inch starting third-quarter
2013, with monthly production capacity for 13-inch units expected to reach around 600,000 units, noted
company chairman Ye Yuzhou. Additionally, Ye also believes that metal mesh has cost advantages over PET
materials and GFF technology. 
O-Film Tech and Mutto Optronics meanwhile will also reportedly supply metal mesh products for notebooks.
The observers said, however, that some makers such as Wintek believe that while metal mesh has price
advantages, the technology's optics are poor compared to other solutions. 
The observers noted that metal mesh may soon only have an about 10% price difference compared to OGS
products in the market, but will likely maintain its price advantage for use in products sized 17-inch and
above.

JohnFenn,


These posts are a perfect example of reader bias. I had read that article prior to your post and concluded
differently.


You read that article (with your negative bias) and conclude that competition exists and will crush Uni-Pixel
before they get started. "Unipixel is not the king of the mesh mountain and, as a matter of fact, is being left
behind rapidly."


I read that article (with my positive bias) and conclude that the market is huge, metal mesh will be a major
player in the field due to advantages including cost, and that demand is outstripping limited supply and
demand will be great for years to come - all positives for Uni-Pixel growth.


Note that the disadvantage attributed to metal mesh optics did applied to Uni-Pixel earlier in their
development - implying these other metal mesh suppliers have not achieved the 6 micron line widths of Uni-
Pixel and the darkening coating Uni-Pixel has patented - both of which were critical to getting customer
acceptance. So I also conclude that, if these mesh suppliers have those optical issues and complaints from
their supply chain, they are about a year behind Uni-Pixel in development.

In addition, until cost/processes are revealed for these metal mesh competitors which apparently still have
optical inferiority, the additive process of Uni-Pixel still has my bet for the low-cost solution in the area.

Excellent Johnfenn. What is still unknown is longevity of metal mesh with their chemical compound protective
coating on tablets and phones. This will probably be known 12 months down the road.


27 Jun 2013, 11:59 AM


johnfenn@att.net
Jgassel


Your dedication to Unipixel is admirable. My "negative" bias comes from the lack of proven production
capability. I have worked within the touch panel market for over 25 years and do know something about
bringing a new technology, material and process into it. There is a product development cycle that has to be
entered into during the initial design phase of a touch panel that starts 6-9 months before market introduction.
This is for a proven material that has a favorable history behind it. UniBoss is not there yet.


As I have said before, the total market that mesh type conductive films are being considered for, is not that
huge, with several competitors already qualified. I am sure that the Mirae Nanotechnology mesh based touch
panels that Samsung is already using in product as well as the Young Fast and JTouch panels that have been
selling since the beginning of the year are not optically unacceptable. I have sold to all three of those
companies and they have been top of the line suppliers for many years. If UniBoss becomes accepted in the
market as a reliable supplier, and I am have no reason to think it won't after the company goes through all of
the preproduction hiccups, which are the norm for start up companies, then the stock can easily catch up to
the companies performance. As it is now, if there is one or two set backs in the UniBoss introduction, there is
no underpinning support for the stock.


27 Jun 2013, 05:31 PM

Johnfenn. Absolutely correct line of thinking. They are not there yet with several more steps to go before
market accepts their products with alternative already out there selling.

It is quite simple: If UNXL can prove its technology and line-up couple of customer this is a billion dollar company...if
UNXL can't prove technology or acquire customers, it will burst.


SEC investigation, management team background etc. do not matter as long as they have ground-breaking
technology which reduce touch-screen cost and efficiency and application...

I am LONG and STRONG...I only invest extremely risky portion of my investment...if UNXL prove technology, it will be
another NFLX, AAPL, GOOG type of stock for investors...otherwise it could be a penny stock....investors need to

That is a big if, Captain. Tell tale sign is management. If you believe they have the experience to kick start

AAPL and GOOG, all had experience management taking it to the next level. UNXL management is the same
for 5 years trying to get started and thus far raising money is their expertise.


24 Jun 2013, 02:56 PM


johnfenn@att.net
After looking at the market segment that Unipixel is going after and the number of other competing companies in
mesh and the other competing technologies available, I just don't see how Unipixel will ever become a billion dollar
company. They are just a "one trick pony" right now, unless they have a large number of other new products in their
development pipe line.


24 Jun 2013, 02:36 PM


goodybob
Not if Unxl has the best, & cheapest to make & with backing of Intel, Dell, Tx. Instruments/Kodak & whoever
they might have aroused at the Computex show.....if true, which there's no reason to doubt it at this point, it
beats ATML/CIT ...whatever. Nobody can "cast the first stone yet". All can go buy ATML & leave this stock
alone then please(BTW a much better short target now). The shorts games are very tiring, with nothing to
bash. Enough assuming already.


24 Jun 2013, 11:44 PM


johnfenn@att.net
Atmel is not their only competition. The use of micro mesh has already started in Asia, with some Samsung
monitors on the shelves now with an integrated mesh based TP made by Mirae Nanotechnology of Korea.
Mirae reported has a monthly volume of 180,000 units which they plan on tripling by the end of the year. They
are a $300 + million/year company with a long history in optical grade films used in LCDs as well as reflective
traffic sighs. There is also 3M, Fujifilm, Gunze, etc as well as other technologies such as Cambrios competing
in Unipixel's market segment of choice. Even the old stand by, ITO, is still being used. Finally there are the
other touch panel solutions such as "in cell" and OGS that are also being used now in the market. Unipixel
does not have a monopoly on this market. Far from it, they have a very crowded playing field where lower
prices and consistent, reliable delivery will win the business, not hype and supposed endorsements by Dell,TI
and Intel.

An SEC investigation, even if there was one, is already factored into the stock price. And regardless, an investigation
is not a jail sentence....esp. with this incompetent SEC.


24 Jun 2013, 11:44 PM


rivershore
The SEC is likely investigating the complaint letters sent to it by people like the author. As part of this investigation, it
may have asked UNXL to reply to the allegations contained in those letters. However, the existence of this type of
investigation is non-public because lots of people file unwarranted complaints against lots of companies.


If the SEC finds probable cause that UNXL violated any securities laws, rules or regulations, it will notify UNXL via a
Wells notice. At that point, the matter will become public and UNXL will be required to disclose the Wells notice in a
filing. Until that point, any correspondence between UNXL and the SEC is confidential.


The proper inference to be drawn from the SEC response is that the SEC is looking into the complaints sent to it by
the author and others, but that it has not yet found probable cause that UNXL has violated any securities laws, rules
or regulations.


25 Jun 2013, 08:25 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
rivershore,


This is exactly what I have been saying and is most likely the case.


What is interesting is that the 3 letters are dated between April 22 and May 21, which means that the SEC
has had them in their possession for 1-2 months. The FOIA response was dated June 4th and received by
the SEC on June 10th. They responded on June 19th.


Therefore, we know that they started their investigation at the latest on June 10th (probably much earlier
based on the timing of the complaints), and through June 19th they still hadn't found anything conclusively
negative.


Yet, 'Alpha Exposure' and other shorts would have us believe that this is proof that the SEC has in fact started
an investigation into UNXL and that UNXL is hiding it.


I hope everybody can use some logic to decide which seems most likely.


Chris

Right on rivershore & Chris! That's what all of us longs have been defending, as well as it's funny how this additional
extremely biased "article" that AlphaExpo(whoever he works with) put out, hit the press in the early morning on a
monthly options expirations' day. Also, Citron Research(possibly) & others have previously barraged the SEC with
letters reporting other innocent companies to start a show.


And if I see one more unfounded, damaging "PR" solicitation from another attorney mosquito, based on the OTHER
AlphaExpose misguided story, it will be 412 too many. The only ones that will make a penny off that side-show(other
than the shorting types of course) will be the attorney news feed advertising agencies.

goodybob - just to be clear here. I hold no position in UNXL. My comment above should not be construed as
a defense of UNXL against any of the claims made by the author in his letters to the SEC. I am not one of the
"us longs."


IMO, the author has drawn the wrong inference from the SEC's denial of his FOIA request. If I were short the
stock, I would not draw any more comfort from the reason asserted by the SEC for its denial. If I were long
the stock, I would not draw any more comfort from the fact that the SEC has not yet issued a Wells notice to
UNXL.

No problem, I didn't say you were, I referred to me & other of "us longs" who are defending against the yellow
journalism agendas. But good you got your disclaimer out.


I agree, it says nothing...just more the reason not to trust any post by a short or a more important group
shorting & promoting these type of biased, twisting "articles".

"We are all entitled to our own opinions, but not our own facts".

Short interest through Jun 14th was published today and UNXL's dipped from 200,000 to 4.26M. The recent addition
of 2.4M institutional shares to the float obviously helps greatly too to mitigate the chance of a short squeeze.

Regarding a possible scam, I can't recall one (I called several and I was always right). Regarding market
positions, certainly I've been wrong plenty of times.


26 Jun 2013, 10:09 PM


JBird61
Paulo,


So, you are still trying to imply that Uni-Pixel is a scam? It appears that way to me because you have stated:
"the company might be a scam" and "I was always right (regarding a possible scam)".


- How do you explain the extremely respected professionals Rusenko, Shin, and Berg coming on board? 
- How do you explain three major tech companies, including two Fortune 100 companies, paying their monies
to build out production capacity for UniBoss while Uni-Pixel remains debt free? 
- How do you explain Intel recommending Uni-Pixel to the touch ecosystem and inviting them to exclusive
conferences?


Are all these tech powerhouses fooled out of tens of millions by 'smoke and mirrors' and one-off lab
samples? Do you really think Kodak (being overseen closely in bk) and two Fortune 100 companies just give
away millions to scam companies who will never produce a product?


Yet in late June 2013 you still choose to believe (and try to convince others) this is a scam and that all the
engineers at these tech powerhouses have been fooled by con artists. Your quote: "You're believing in
something that's quite unlikely to be true - that's called 'denial'."


I realize there are risks in scaling production, especially as fast as Uni-Pixel is currently doing so, and I expect
bumps in the road as the plan comes to fruition. This is not a slam-dunk at this point .. nor is it a 'gimmee' ..
that they will execute the production ramp and capture as much market as they are targeting.


.. but UniBoss a scam? Honestly? IMO saying so in late June 2013 - that is just silly and choosing to ignore
the information available to you.

I think that it's a scam trying to do something. Saying it has done it (able to mass produce), but not having
done it yet. This would explain: 
* The credible people coming on-board; 
* The partnerships with customers; 
* The delays; 
* The deal with Kodak.


I also believe that the deal with Kodak really is as rumored (50/50, can only produce with Kodak). This would
explain the delays in having product in the market. Also, if this weren't so UNXL could quickly quench the
doubts regarding the deal.


27 Jun 2013, 10:10 AM


JBird61
Paulo, 
You are basically saying that Uni-Pixel is lying and that by "saying it has done it (able to mass produce)", they
have ...  


.. fooled production experts Rusenko and Shin into changing careers, 
.. fooled Fortune 100 companies and their production experts out of tens of millions, 
.. etcetera, etcetera.


Boy, you must really think these people are gullible .. good thing you are not so gullible as to believe
something so obviously false.

Paulo Santos, Marketplace Contributor
jgassel, it's not the first time it has gone to these lengths, either. Credibility is built over time. You have to think
about what's more likely.


What is more likely? 
* That a company which has said it was going to launch 2/3 revolutionary products in the past and failed,
being run by people who did this over and over again in the past, being promoted by several well-known
pump&dump research houses, has delays with its latest revolutionary product yet is really on a track to
greatness or; 
* That the company is doing it again and is a pump&dump?

Can you provide any example of a pump and dump that spent huge portions of the money they conned out of

Why would these con artists waste the money they worked hard to con? It just makes no sense.


Your argument held some sway as this year started but with each new agreement, each new multi-million
dollar payment, each new milestone met, each new printing/plating machine running, each new conference
invitation, and each new announcement of business progress, the risk of you being right has decreased
steadily to the point that calling this a scam at this point is just plainly ignoring reality. They may fail to scale at
the rate projected, but denouncing UniBoss as a scam in late June 2013 is just silly IMO - and shows your
tendency of ignoring several months of positive developments.


"What is more likely?" 
What is most likely is that you have seen a pattern in the past and are betting on that pattern repeating in the
future, despite facts to the contrary.


We are just going to have to agree to disagree .. but don't think that means longs can let your unsubstantiated
allegations go unchallenged.

Kodak has nothing to lose if UNXL does not perform or goes bankrupt. As far as the other, its just milestone
payment therefore they too have nothing to lose. There is no contract order.

thanks for being honest paulo, but as for unxl i believe your very wrong about them, give them time and they will
prove. i also do agree with u on not betting your whole portfolio on them.

AlphaExposure has valid points so disregard them so quickly. It takes SEC time to send inquiry to various brokerage
firms while analyzing time line event before sending UNXL any notice.


Just look at the recent SEC charges here

Wow after three years the SEC really does jump on these, don't they? lol.


To jgassel's point that UNXL wouldn't spend all this money on something they know to be a scam I don't think
they think of it as a scam per se. Their jobs and futures are invested in this so I'm sure they're trying to make

a go of it just like they did with TMOS and DiamondGuard. But they're not spending their own money -
actually they were selling stock so they managed to cash in some - and many companies go for broke when
it's OPM. That's how ASTI came up with over $100M to build factories to produce their ultimately failed lab-to-
market experiment in roll-to-roll flexible PV thinfilm.


Build it and . . . . you will have a job for awhile.

Mukticat, 
I can't argue with your point, although that doesn't mean I agree with all of it. ;) 
"Their jobs and futures are invested in this" .. and if it was just Killion and Van Ostrand, I would be more
worried. But the fact that Rusenko and Berg have viewed the processes, technologies, agreements, etc and
talked to the customers, partners and supply chain companies BEFORE they chose to have "their jobs and
futures .. invested in this" - now that lets me sleep well at night.


Real risks remain, but Uni-Pixel has a strong team and strong partners and is building a strong supply chain.


But what you and I are saying is nothing at all like what Paulo claims (liars, scammers, thieves and con-men -
run away, don't walk). So I have to call him on his extreme overstatements that are just put out there to
spread fear, uncertainty and doubt.


27 Jun 2013, 01:39 PM


Mukticat
What I said doesn't preclude the possibility that Killeon thinks, or knows, that this probably isn't going to work
but buys time until they get their next latest greatest out there and begin the development cycle over again. A
bit like Research Frontiers - 40 years in business, nothing sold.


If this is more of the same then, yes, this could rightly be described as a scam.


As for the talent UNXL has attracted we can speculate on the many reasons people switch jobs and who
knows they might have an attractive severance package included in case things don't work out. In this age of
floating employment switching executive jobs is no longer such a big deal that these guys are making a major
sacrifice or risk to come to UNXL. There'll be another job waiting if they need it.

Right on jgassel! I'm so tired of shorts screamin' "The sky is falling". I don't trust anything they say after the

This was issued yesterday by Kodak.  
Kodak and Kingsbury Announce Agreement on Touch Screen Sensors.


http://yhoo.it/14edWYS


This is incredible agreement with another firm making Touch Screen sensors so Unxl with Kodak is not such big news
to make $$$$.


How would you view this?


28 Jun 2013, 07:19 AM


Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
It seems that Kodak is looking to built Silver nano-wires touch sensors. 
“In Kingsbury, we have aligned ourselves with a new manufacturing partner who will utilize our silver
deposition technologies to pattern and produce touch sensor grid films with a high degree of precision and
productivity,”  
It seems that Kodak is not as dedicated to UniPixel as it has been previously believed. 
Also Kodak could have learned a think or two about fine line printing from UniPixel. 
It looks like the stabber could have gotten stab in back in the back. 
There is no honor between thieves.

This is indeed bad news for UNXL longs. Note the emphasis on "*new* manufacturing partner." Could
something be read into this?

Silver halide process is a Kodak technology - nothing to do with nano-wires.

I disagree totally Pan that this is bad new for Uni-Pixel. 
These are different technologies targeting different market segments - silver halide will never be competitive
above smaller hand-held devices - while Uni-Pixel is cost-effective there, the greatest gains for their metal
mesh is at even larger form factors. 
In addition, the key technologies of Uni-Pixel are the extremely fine printing and emulsion/plating capabilities -
neither of which came from Kodak.


Kodak and the state of NY are pushing to utilize more of that sprawling Eastman Business Park that is half-
empty as Kodak comes out of bk .. expect to hear many Kodak deals of people moving in there.


Post from CH on another site yesterday: 
" I spoke with Kodak today to get their side of the story ... They are very excited about UNXL still and are very
focused on it. They made it very clear that they do NOT have a modest involvement, but a very heavy
involvement in getting the (UniBoss) manufacturing and distribution up and running.  
They expect there will be some overlap from UniBoss and Kingsbury's Silver Halide product, but they see
them as two separate technologies. The Kingsbury deal does NOT affect the UNXL deal."


28 Jun 2013, 02:12 PM


Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
I'm, looking into Silver Halide and the only information I can find is from the Fujifilm "Exclear" product.


April 23, 2013 
"FUJIFILM Corporation (President: Shigehiro Nakajima) is investing approx. one billion yen in the Ashigara
Site of the Kanagawa Factory to reinforce its production facilities in order to expand the production capacity
for the touch-panel sensor film "EXCLEAR", used in smartphones, tablets, notebook computers and all-in-one
computers*. The move is expected to more than double the production capacity for EXCLEAR by June this
year.


It seems that Silver Halide is intended to be used in larger form factors by the Fujifilm press release.


So it seems Kodak will be directly competing against UNXL.


I never liked the UNXL Kodak deal because it gave Kodak lots UNXL privy information.


Right now we can only watch to see what happens but having Kodak become a direct competitor of UNXL is
not good. Unless Kodak is just investing in both techonologies that is if UNXL is a partial owner of UNXL.


28 Jun 2013, 04:39 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Uniboss is in demos with Atmel controllers. Does that mean that Atmel is competing against its own XSense?


No, it doesn't. It means that Atmel is smart to diversify its exposure, just like how Kodak is diversifying its
exposure across ITO alternatives.


If Kodak came out with another metal-mesh product, then I would be quite worried.

Are you saying that Kodak owns UNXL? 
Maybe it is true that Kodak owns a part of UNXL and so they are part of the family. 
But is clear that Kodak is not putting all its eggs in one basket.

Sounds like you are the former today that is, or both, & need to sell low fast. The shorts are history. Time's

28 Jun 2013, 09:47 PM


johnfenn@att.net
Chris,


EK has come out with their own version of a metal mesh product using their Ag halide coatings and photo
exposure. Ideally, the exposure would be with a laser, but it takes to long to expose the whole pattern with a
raster source. Maybe they can use a gang of lasers, but I just speculate. Using photo-lithography is well
proven and can easily meet the < 10 micron requirements. This could be what they are doing with Kingsbury,
but I am not absolutely sure of this.


By the way, their PEDOT:PSS coating capability is 1st rate and can get down to 180 ohms/sq at > 85% T.
They can also pattern the film, so that no material is removed. This gives them an advantage of ITO in that an
index matching layer is not needed to hide the pattern.


EK is covering all their bets and not at great expense.


03 Sep 2013, 09:49 PM


bullchin
Agree with you John. EK is doing much JV while selling supplies as steady stream of income.  
We know metal mesh has some visibility clarity on large tablet, if their potential clients ask for heavier grade
metal to bring up visibilty, will that increase their cost currently at 20 dramatically?


04 Sep 2013, 01:10 PM
