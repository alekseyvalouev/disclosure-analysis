Pacira Insiders Sold $25 Million Last Week - But Why ?
Mar. 18, 2013 7:47 AM ET5 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Last week I published an article noting several sell signals which were emerging at Pacira
Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PCRX), which was closing in on a triple since 2012. In just the
past few weeks the shares have risen by more than 50%, to $30.00 from $20.00.


Following my article, it was disclosed that MPM Asset Management, which employs both
the CEO and CMO from Pacira, had begun selling 500,000 shares at $27.86. In addition,
Pacira General Manager John Pratt sold 100% of his remaining shares at $28.46.

The previous key sell indicators had been the onset of insider selling by anchor investors
Sanderling Ventures along with a $120 million equity-linked financing by Pacira itself. This
could lead investors to believe that insider selling might be set to continue.


Even Uber-Bull Jim Cramer noted that with Pacira trading at $28.00 it was time to "take
profits".


In February, BioWire noted that Pacira's $676 million market cap looked "quite ridiculous"
citing its sales slowdown and negative gross margin. Yet now the stock is valued at $1
billion.


Following the release of a wide earnings (loss) miss, the shares fell by as much as 5%
into the $24.00 range. But the stock has been recently buoyed by analyst upgrades to as
high as $32.00 by Wedbush and Jefferies, along with a conference presentation by Pacira
at Barclay's.

Following my article, MPM Asset Management disclosed a sale of 500,000 shares at a
price of $27.86. That trade had crossed in after-hours at a 5% discount to the closing price
and represents a discount of 8% to the current price.


In a subsequent sale, General Manager John Pratt sold 100% of his remaining shares in
Pacira at a price of $28.46, netting himself over $266,000 in proceeds.

Reported Symbol Insider Shares Average Total


SELL 3/14/13 PCRX Pratt John 9,375 $28.46 $266,812


SELL 3/13/13 PCRX MPM Funds 500,000 $27.86 $13,930,000


SELL 3/11/13 PCRX Sanderling Venture Funds 374,511 $27.73 $10,384,290


SELL 1/25/13 PCRX Sanderling Venture Funds 500,000 $18.93 $9,465,000


BUY 4/17/12 PCRX Pace Gary 10,000 $9.75 $97,500


The sales by MPM are the most telling.


MPM has long been an anchor investor in Pacira. But of much greater importance is the
fact that both Pacira CEO David Stack and Pacira CMO Gary Patou are in fact Managing
Directors at MPM. While working for MPM, the CMO works only part time for Pacira.


As a result of this involvement, it is safe to say that among insiders, MPM has far greater
insight into Pacira than any other fund.


We can now see from the SEC Form 4 filings, that insiders have now sold $25 million
worth of their shares in the month of March alone. The last time an insider purchased
shares was nearly one year ago, consisting of just 10,000 shares at a price of $9.75.


With the share price now sitting within just a few percent of even the highest analyst
targets, it is clear that the upside is now limited in the foreseeable future while the
downside is considerable. Following its recent 50% rise, there are no new results or
developments expected from Pacira in the near term.


The fact that this rise in the stock has occurred along with the market rising 10 days in a
row has likely not been lost on the insiders as they sell.

In the current market environment, it seems that analysts view virtually every traded equity
as a compelling buy regardless of its price or recent rise in valuation. Any time a share
price moves up to its target, analysts simply re-raise the target to a higher level.


But in the case of Pacira, we can see that this company represents an investment
banker's dream client in terms of future financing needs. Pacira's historical investment
bankers have included Barclay's, Jefferies and Wedbush.


The company now sports a $1 billion market cap, which means that it is large enough to
justify meaningful 9-figure financings in terms of investment banking fees. And it is also
clear that the financings will need to continue due to Pacira's minimal revenues of only
$10 million last quarter which were accompanied by a $16 million loss.


These losses are quite obviously set to continue given that Pacira continues to sell its
product at a negative gross margin. Even Pacira management noted on its conference call
that it hopes to achieve breakeven only in 2014. If there is a profit to be had we must then
wait until 2015.


The real question becomes: "Why are those who know the most about Pacira also the
ones doing the most selling ?"


The question they are likely asking themselves regarding selling is: "If not now, then
when?"


As the share price rose, the company was quick to make use of the share price rise to
issue equity securities raising $120 million. At that time Sanderling began selling. Now the
fund which employs both the CEO and the CMO has begun selling shares and even
employees such as the General Manager are selling 100% of their shares.


The share price has benefited from every tailwind possible including bullish upgrades
despite an earnings miss and a 10 day consecutive rise in the stock market.


With the share price now closing in to just a few percent of the newly upgraded share
price targets, and with no new corporate developments expected in the near term, the
shares have simply run out of further upside catalysts.


Aside from the selling insiders, outside investors will now need to pause and evaluate the
$1 billion valuation in the context of a stock that sells at negative gross margins with
quarterly revenues of just $10 million.

As BioWire noted at $20.00, before the 50% rise, the valuation continues to be ridiculous.
It is likely that we will see ongoing insider sales to cash in on this stock market gift to
share holders.


Outsiders now need to consider whether or not they should be listening to the company's
investment bankers who are telling us to buy the stock at ever higher prices, or whether
they should be listening to the close insiders who are now cashing out of their stock.


Disclosure: I am short PCRX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Bio Insights, Contributor
Pearson, thanks for the mention!


Also thanks for informing me about Cramer's hyper bullishness on Pacira. I don't really follow him, but I was
wondering why PCRX has been on steroids in the last few weeks


PCRX scrips had another leap, but the negative margins remain and I think investors are way too optimistic about the
nerve block indication. MPM's selling is a very telling sign.


I actually tried to short it last week but couldn't find any shares at the time. May be going with puts instead

Options are a great play here. These pumps can stay irrational for awhile - but options have a finite downside and you
wont risk a buy-in.


I think anyone who scales in their option position will do well since there really no rational that can take this much best
a Billion. But who knows funny things have happened (Unipixel hasn't slowed yet ;)
