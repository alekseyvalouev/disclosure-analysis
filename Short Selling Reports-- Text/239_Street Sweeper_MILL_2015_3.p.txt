Miller Energy: Alaska Debates Vital Tax Credit Handouts

Summary


Miller Energy Resources has been struggling recently from panic selling prompted
by a chairman’s margin call, enormous debt, huge earnings/revenue misses and low
oil prices. More trouble looms ahead.


Miller’s oil and gas exploration focuses on Alaska, where millions of dollars from tax
credits provide a major portion of the company’s operating budget. Those tax credits
appear at risk.


Alaska’s governor penned a fiery opinion piece questioning the wisdom of paying
millions in tax credits when production taxes to the state fall far short of tax credits
handed out.


Miller could find its tax credit money cut short by legislation. A legislative report
examines the issue. And, now a House Finance Committee co-chairman is taking a
closer look.

THESTREETSWEEPER QUICK HIT - Terrible, cash-eating news from Alaska threatens to
drive another stake into Miller Energy Resources (NYSE:MILL). The bleeding Knoxville,
Tenn. company is already struggling beneath a recent executive chairman's margin call
that led to panic selling, plus enormous debt, big earnings/revenue misses and low oil
prices.


The last thing the company needs is a hit to its tax credit receipts.


That's because tax credits tied to Miller's exploration in Alaska have meant millions to the
oil and gas company each year. Miller anticipates receiving about $72 million in Alaska tax
credit receipts in 2015.


Alaska issues tax credits to oil producers to encourage exploration in the state. The
company applies for these credits each quarter and frequently notes that operations
depend heavily on tax credit money.


Every spare dime is coveted, as new CEO Carl Giesler told analysts in December:

From both the financial and operational perspective the quarter was disappointing to
put it mildly.


But now it's obvious that Alaska Gov. Bill Walker is having second thoughts about the very
tax credits that keep Miller pumping.


Recently sworn into office, Gov. Walker wrote an opinion piece and made public
comments about some $100 million more going out in oil tax credits than the state will
receive in production taxes. The state's revenue commissioner specifically called out small
explorers and developers in the North Slope and Miller stronghold Cook Inlet.


Gov. Walker's opinion piece stated,


But giving away more in tax breaks than we collect is irresponsible, and it's
unsustainable.


He didn't specifically propose legislation cutting the tax credits. But he alluded to that,
writing:


I look forward to working with the Legislature and all Alaskans to stabilize our
financial health and secure our future.


Working from a recent legislative report examining indirect expenses, Alaska Rep. Steve
Thompson, co-chairman of the House Finance Committee, is taking a closer look at the
issue.


So, the tax credit issue is boiling and presents the possibility of legislative action limiting
those tax credits so critical to Miller's financial core. The ramifications for investors?
Daunting.


TheStreetSweeper has warned investors about Miller previously; shareholders may find
other viewpoints here.

and gas, producers out of business. I would suppose that any new system,  
perhaps phased in, wouldn't become effective immediately, but some time in  
the future. MILL pumps a lot of gas for Alaska.

Its on the table, as are several other things to help balance the budget. However, Alaska has a vested interest
in diversifying away from BP, hence the effort at encouraging small players. While the current out flow is
there, there is now a small private company looking at the shale on the North Slope (and drilling test wells),
as well as other prospects (Apache, for example). This was never enacted to solve the goals in a year, and in
that sense this article is extremely one sided, and the arguements are presented without the counter
arguments and the alternatives.


Miller used the money to increase reserves, which implies that infill wells can now be drilled and several will
be profitable without the tax incentives. Plus with the North Fork acquisition, Miller has big gas production and
the winter prices are often $7MCF, and has a rig drilling for more gas full time.

Top the article says: "Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours..."


Bottom of article says: "Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in MILL and
stand to profit on any future declines in the stock price. Editor's Note: As a matter of policy, TheStreetSweeper
prohibits members of its editorial team from taking financial positions in the companies that they cover."


The bottom statement contradicts itself and is the opposite of the top statement. This all looks a bit disingenuous - to
be charitable about it. I wrote a complaint to the SA editor a few minutes before posting this comment.


This is one of the more pathetic attempts I've seen lately to use Seeking Alpha to talk one's book by smearing a
company.

Actually I think that the bigger danger here is that they quite possibly represent several short sellers, and that
the profits made from these articles could be quite large when looking at the group as a whole, and the profits
distributed after the fact.

I think Alaska needs to keep the TeansAlaska Pipeline System running, they need a steady 400,000 barrels a day to
do that. A few years ago there was real worry they would fall below that. Add to that the fact that natural gas in Cook
Inlet was running out, the city of Anchorage was going to actually need to import LNG from Canada. The revamped
tax system is what brought Alaska back from the brink of having all of its energy assets stranded was the new tax
system.


This idea was floated by one democrat rep and the new governor, and quickly swept under the rug.

Amerigo - Thanks for the update. MILL is drilling several new gas wells.  
That's because gas in Alaska goes for about $7, and they have a  
contract that locks in that price. They also have hedges for almost 100%  
on their oil through 2016. The incentive payments are nice, but they can  
get along without them if new legislation should pass down the road and 
they don't drill any dry wells. They've also stated that they will drill only 
in their core areas going forward. That's why I'm in the preferred.

This is from another post: "They still have 72 mil in tax credits expected from Alaska in the next few months. Even if
the program changes for future years, those are already in the bag."

"enormous debt"?


Miller Energy Resources Inc's long-term debt for the quarter that ended in Oct. 2014 was $194.35 Mil. Miller Energy
Resources Inc's total assets for the quarter that ended in Oct. 2014 was $528.82 Mil. Miller Energy Resources Inc's
long-term debt to total assets ratio for the quarter that ended in Oct. 2014 was 0.37.


I don't think 0.37 ratio is that bad, is it? Am I missing something?

Mill pD has been in lockstep with the price of crude until this week. At first I though it was trading noise about the ex-
div date, but with today's continued slump the only thing left to point to are rumors of the possible loss of the Alaska
credits.

I've looked everywhere but I can't find anything stating the credits are in jeopardy.


I can offer this article: http://bit.ly/1vIufi4 where Gov Walker explains how at low prices, oil is taxed at a lower rate,
ramping up as prices rise. But that's as far as he went. Were oil to recover higher I'm sure this issue will be less
urgent because he states "I support the philosophy behind tax incentives; I want to encourage companies to invest in
Alaska. " I


In another article from Newsminer: "Walker's spokeswoman has said the governor was sharing facts with Alaskans as
he and the administration were learning them and that the piece was not a precursor to any legislation. Walker took
office in December. Hoffbeck said there is no systemic problem with the credits themselves. He said this is a cash-
flow issue, driven by low prices. 
http://bit.ly/1vIufi5


Scanning the Alaska Dispatch News and others there's absolutely nothing to indicate any interest in changing the
exploration credits that MILL relies on.


Anybody find anything credible on this rumor?

On a high dividend, volatile stock like this, one group of investors will buy the stock for the income, while another
group will go for the capital gains by selling just before the dividend. Then after the record date some of the income
holders will sell too, after "capturing" the dividend. The ex-date was 2/11. Also, this stock has been a favorite of the
short sellers for quite some time now, and other investors will get out at the first sign of trouble. The market isn't
necessarily a logical place. If there is going to be new legislation, they'll just have to work it out. The preferred
shares dividend shouldn't be impacted, in my opinion. So I'm going to stick around.

Also, someone who had been recommending the stock suggested that maybe  
his followers should take their profits and reinvest in another of his stocks.  
Doesn't take much to move a low volume stock, but I'm going to get my  
dividends.
