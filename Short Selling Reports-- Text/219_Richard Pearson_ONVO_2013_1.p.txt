Organovo: Red Hot But Set To Drop

Editor's Note: SA author Jason Napodano has written a rebuttal of this article. You can
access it here.


Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO) is about as hot as any concept stock could ever be right
now. It sits right at the crossroads of 3D printing and regenerative biotechnology. In
addition, Organovo just uplisted from the OTCBB to the NYSE, further fueling the strong
enthusiasm.


Following the uplist, Organovo soared from $3.90 to $8.50, a gain of over 100%. But since
then it has been dropping almost daily. By Monday it had fallen 26% to $6.29. However,
yesterday the latest issue of Popular Science hit the newsstands with a cover story
featuring futuristic "bio-printing". Organovo was mentioned and the stock soared as much
as 15% due to the article alone.


The article was clearly good for a predictable trade. It was also welcome relief for
investors who were getting tired of seeing their stock give up gains each day. But those
who are still left holding are likely walking in front of a moving train.


Popular Science has been a long time source of very interesting and thought provoking
topics including flying cars and life on Mars. But in stoking the imagination, it tends to
ignore many of the practicalities that these futuristic ideas entail.


With Organovo, we are now seeing a "rush for the exits" from different classes of sellers
who are trying to beat each other to hit the sell button. With over $300 million in stock
coming for sale, this will easily take the stock back to $4-$5 very quickly.


Overall, those who choose to hold shares of Organovo are likely fighting a losing battle
which really just comes down to a huge supply of available shares coming for sale which
can overwhelm current demand.

No one has a perfect crystal ball to predict where Organovo will be in 10 years' time. The
stock could be at $30 or it could be at zero.


While the concept is extremely cool, the company is extremely speculative.


Almost all revenues (only a few hundred thousand dollars per quarter) at present are the
result of government grants and research collaborations. Revenues from actual product
sales are still years away at best. The stock currently boasts a market cap of over $400
million (over $500 million fully diluted), despite having almost no revenues or near-term
revenue prospects. Against this $500 million valuation, the company has just $15 million in
cash. Aside from this, the company has only $1.5 million in total assets. This is truly a
"blue sky", concept stock.


Fortunately, we all have the tools to predict the share price performance in the near term.


A sharp rise upon the uplisting was certainly easy to predict. The company had
implemented all of the perfunctory corporate governance and structural measures
necessary for an uplisting. Management had also been hinting at it for some time. Anyone
who sold before the uplisting was either not paying attention or was just too impatient to
wait for this predictable move up. However, the 100% gain was certainly larger than
anyone could have predicted.


Now that the uplisting is behind us, a near-term drop of at least 20-30% is easy to predict
due to the following four very visible sell catalysts:


First, Organovo overshot on its uplisting, doubling from $3.90 to nearly $8.00 on that event
alone. Many stocks will see a bump up of around 10-30% upon uplisting due to the
improved liquidity that a senior exchange provides. But given that an uplisting involves no
fundamental change in the business, any increases of more than 30% are typically very
short lived. The 100% gain experienced by Organovo was highly unusual and has already
begun to reverse itself.


Second, there is a substantial overhang of 32 million shares (around $200 million) from
the sellers who were named in the April prospectus from the Reg D offerings. These
investors would certainly not have sold before the uplisting. For anyone who had already
been waiting for over a year to sell their stock, waiting an extra few months for the
uplisting would be just plain common sense. The stock began its run up after the
announcement on July 9th, but has only been on the NYSE for a few days. As a result,
there simply has not been enough time for these sellers to complete their selling.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 3/53


An article in May entitled "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" highlighted this overhang and caused a
brief dip in the share price. But the volume that resulted from that article was nowhere
near what would have been necessary to clear this number of shares and the price drop
was not nearly as steep. So again, it is only sensible to conclude that the majority of
holders were waiting for the uplist catalyst in order to sell their shares. The liquidity event
that they have been waiting for is happening right now.


It should also be noted that many of the 16 million warrants that are listed in the
prospectus would have already been exercised, either voluntarily or due to forced
conversion by the company. When the warrants are exercised, the holder is then left with
shares which must be sold. So the simple act of exercising the warrant does not remove
the overhang. Only selling the underlying shares removes the overhang.


Third, Organovo just filed an S3 registration statement for the sale of $100 million in new
shares. The S3 was just filed on July 17th, meaning that it was ready and waiting for the
uplisting. By filing immediately after the uplisting, Organovo has signaled its intent to
proceed with the offering as quickly as possible, taking full advantage of the strong share
price. But with an offering size of around 25% of market cap, this deal will require a
discount of around 20%. Relative to the current price, that would price the offering at
around $5.50 plus warrants. However, the offering is now competing with the existing Reg
D sellers. Any additional selling from the Reg D sellers will mean that Organovo must
price its $100 million offering at an even lower level.


Fourth, the uplisting has also made Organovo a much easier stock to short. Shorting a
stock which just spiked due to its uplisting is often an easy money trade. But when such a
stock has as much as $300 million in imminent selling due to two registration statements,
it becomes almost too easy for short sellers to pass up. There is ample ammunition to
make the stock fall, but there is virtually nothing that could make the stock rise
substantially for more than a day or so.


As with the Reg D sellers, short sellers will likely drive the share price lower. This will
potentially cause Organovo to price its equity offering below $5.00 if the price dips even
slightly.


We can already see that the shorts have been flocking to Organovo as soon as the uplist
was complete. The stock was quickly placed on the short sale restriction list due to heavy
shorting. Borrowable shares have been snapped up almost as quickly as they become
available due to very high demand.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 4/53


Anyone who follows uplistings should certainly have predicted that this one was coming.
An uplisting is actually not a difficult process to undertake. In fact it is entirely mechanical
and perfunctory.


Obtaining the original shell on the OTCBB is as easy as completing a reverse merger with
a once-defunct company. Organovo completed its reverse merger in a series of
transactions in 2011 and 2012.


From there, getting to the NYSE was easy. All that Organovo had to do was implement a
board which was comprised mainly of independent directors and then establish three
board committees (audit, nominations, compensation). The biggest impediment keeping
most issuers from the NYSE or NASDAQ is the market cap and share price restriction.
However, the sharp rise in Organovo's stock this year made the uplisting almost a sure
thing.


Organovo's uplisting was entirely predictable and had been hinted at by the CEO for
months. Despite this, the stock quickly doubled.


Investors need to keep in mind that there has been no fundamental change to the actual
company which would change its valuation. It is the same company which now simply
trades on a more liquid exchange.


In addition, many investors continue to be mistaken in assuming that the uplist implies
some type of positive opinion being expressed by the exchange with respect to the
company. This is absolutely not the case. Instead, the company simply fulfilled a simple
check list of criteria and was then automatically accepted. In the past we have seen
hundreds of companies undergo the identical process. A few years ago, it was the case
that hundreds of fraudulent Chinese companies became listed on the NYSE and the
NASDAQ. When they were ultimately delisted again due to fraud, the NASDAQ and the
NYSE were very quick to point out that uplisting does not involve any qualitative
assessment on a company's investment merits.


The key point is that holding Organovo prior to the uplisting was an obvious and easy
trade. The uplisting was almost certain to provide a quick boost of 10-30%. But once the
share price spiked by 100% with no fundamental developments, selling it is now an even
more obvious trade.


The impact of a 32 million share overhang
5/22/2018 Organovo: Red Hot But Set To Drop - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 5/53


Back in April, Organovo filed a prospectus which allowed for the sale of 32 million shares
of stock by selling stockholders. These shareholders got in at a price of just $1-2 per
share around 18 months ago and are now sitting on 3-4 baggers in that time.


Expecting these shareholders to continue to hold such a quick home run forever is just
plain unrealistic. In addition, the timing of the uplist coming just 9 weeks after the
prospectus suggests that this was very much a planned liquidity event for these
shareholders.


Some may be tempted to think that these shares were already sold following the "Get Rich
or Die Tryin'" article in May. This is clearly not the case. That article caused a brief dip in
the share price. But the volume only exceeded 1 million shares for two days. Within days
of the article, the volume was back down to 200,000-300,000 shares per day - not nearly
enough to clear such a huge overhang.


The ability for these holders to eventually sell was entirely made possible by the uplist to
the NYSE. Just prior to the uplisting, the stock was trading only around 100,000 shares
per day. A full liquidation of 32 million shares would easily have taken months and would
have put extreme pressure on the share price.


Now the stock has far greater liquidity and the share price is 100% higher than where it
was before the uplist.


Although this is highly beneficial for those who are selling, it will still mean heavy pressure
on the share price for those who continue to hold. At current prices, the 32 million shares
equates to around $200 million, or roughly 50% of Organovo's market cap!


Even at prices of around $4.00, this means that many of these holders will still be sitting
on 4 baggers. If selling at around $6.00, these holders are locking in quick 6 baggers. The
point is that these sellers will likely not be very sensitive to price when locking in their
tremendous gains. They have more to lose by waiting than they have to gain.


There has simply not been enough volume to allow for sales of 100% of these shares
since the uplisting, which means that we will likely see continued pressure on the share
price. We have already seen it dip from a high of $8.50 on Thursday to a low of $6.29 on
Tuesday - a very quick retreat of 26%.


Evaluating the $100 million S3 offering


Organovo filed its $100 million S3 shelf registration statement just 1 week after it became
listed on the NYSE. The timing of this filing was clearly not a coincidence.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 6/53


Documents such as this will take the company and its legal counsel weeks to complete.
But completing it before the uplisting would have been a waste of time and money
because there would be many stock specific sections that would need to be redrafted
following the move to a new exchange.


Instead the company clearly had a fully drafted S3 which applied to an uplisted stock even
before the uplisting had occurred. They simply waited for the uplisting to take place and
then filed the document almost immediately.


Given the price and liquidity before the uplist, launching such an offering at that time
would not have been possible.


Offerings such as this can be differentiated between operational offerings and
opportunistic offerings. Operational offerings are sized according to specific operational
needs which are defined in the "use of proceeds" section. Opportunistic offerings are
typically done simply to take advantage of an unusually high share price.


The offering by Organovo is really a combination of the two offering types. It is clear that
the company does have an operational need. Losses have ranged anywhere from $10
million to almost $40 million - per quarter! Last year the company burned $10 million in
cash, while in the most recent quarter the company burned $3 million in cash. Yet the
company currently has only $15.6 million in cash. The company clearly needs to raise at
least $30-40 million in the near term.


But the offering size of $100 million clearly reflects a view by the company that the current
share price makes NOW the time to raise as much as possible.


This is further confirmed by the defined use of proceeds, which is totally open ended and
non-committal:
5/22/2018 Organovo: Red Hot But Set To Drop - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 7/53


Except as described in any prospectus supplement and any free writing
prospectus in connection with a specific offering, we currently intend to use the
net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered under this prospectus for
general corporate purposes, including research and development, the
development and commercialization of our products, general administrative
expenses, license or technology acquisitions, and working capital and capital
expenditures.


We may also use the net proceeds to repay any debts and/or invest in or
acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies, although we
have no current commitments or agreements with respect to any such
investments or acquisitions as of the date of this prospectus.


We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically
for the foregoing purposes.


As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of
the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of the
securities.


Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the proceeds in short-
term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.


This is a very boiler plate use of proceeds definition for companies who wish to complete
an opportunistic offering. It basically says "We know that we will need the money sooner
or later, so just trust us." It is also a very clear way of management saying that "at the
current share price, we wish to sell every share possible."


The problem for current investors is that the offering size is extremely large. At nearly 25%
of market cap, the $100 million offering will likely require a 15-20% discount from the
current share price. The offering is made more difficult given that the stock is almost
entirely held by retail investors. A $100 million offering will clearly require the participation
of institutions into a stock which has never had institutional interest. This will likely mean
the further issuance of a large number of warrants as we have seen in the past.


All in all, if the offering were priced today, it would likely be priced at around $5.50 or
below and would include warrant coverage. This would almost certainly send the share
price back to around $4.50 in short order.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 8/53


The problem is that now the company is competing with the Reg D sellers for who gets to
sell first. If the stock falls below $6.00 due to Reg D selling, then the company may end up
selling at below $4.50 under the S3 and having to include even more warrants.


For those who wish to remain longer-term holders of Organovo, there is no reason to hold
at a time when the share price is likely to exhibit a predictable decline of 20-30%. It is just
as easy to sell now and buy back in at prices below $5.00 again.


Here come the shorts


One of the biggest positives of an uplisting is the fact that liquidity is greatly improved on a
senior exchange. This will typically provide a boost to the share price. But it is often
overlooked that the uplisting is typically the beginning of meaningful short interest. Once
the share price rises, the new wave of shorts can often push it back down significantly.


Shorting OTCBB stocks is often a losing game due to the poor liquidity. As a result, funds
who wish to short an OTCBB stock will simply keep it on their watch list and wait until it
uplists. This strategy has an added benefit in that it usually becomes possible to short the
stock at a noticeably higher level due to the predictable pop upon uplisting. This is exactly
what we have seen with Organovo.


This short selling should be expected to create additional downward pressure on the stock
at just the time the company is looking to issue stock.


Now there are 3 major competitors all selling stock at the same time: Reg D sellers, short
sellers and the company itself with its $100 million S3.


Prior to the uplist, only about 1% of shares were sold short. This is virtually nil. When short
interest is already high, any changes in the short will not have a noticeable effect on the
share price. But when short interest is going from nothing up to something high, the effect
on share price can be pronounced. As a high flying stock with minimal revenues,
Organovo could expect to see as much as 25% of shares sold short - around 15 million
shares. At a minimum, this will serve to cap further upside in the share price. At a
maximum, it could end up driving the share price much lower when combined with the
Reg D selling.


Valuation considerations for Organovo


At the present time, there is no defensible way to place a fundamental valuation on shares
of Organovo. The best we can do is try to predict how certain events will move the stock in
one direction or another. The uplisting saw a move up while the flood of shareholder and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 9/53


company selling will knock the stock back down substantially.


Organovo now sports a fully diluted market cap of around half a billion dollars. This market
cap will grow considerably larger once the $100 million S3 offering is completed.


Against this, the company has only generated lifetime revenues of a few million dollars.
These revenues have primarily been the result of government grants and research
collaborations. There have been virtually no meaningful revenues from actual sales of a
product. Any material revenues are still years away at best.


As a result, investing in Organovo is largely about investing in a story, not about investing
in financials. This is the primary benefit of using a reverse merger to list on the OTCBB.


If Organovo were a private company attempting to tap private equity investors, there is
simply no way that these investors would award a half billion dollar valuation to a company
which only generates a few hundred thousand dollars per quarter in total revenue.


But the reverse merger-OTCBB-uplist process is both cheap and easy. This allows the
company to tap into retail investors who are willing to invest based on a sexy story and
based on current market hype for both biotech and 3D printing.


Investors cannot say that they were not warned about the speculative nature of
Organovo's stock. The list of risk factors runs longer than most companies at 13 pages.
The company has made it clear that they are working with an unproven emerging
technology which may never amount to anything. They have also clearly stated that they
will continue raising money and incurring losses for the foreseeable future. This is all part
of the norm for this category of speculative "concept stock". There is simply no foundation
upon which to build a traditional valuation framework.


For those who choose to invest in Organovo, it is essential to keep abreast of any new
corporate developments. But of even greater importance is the continuous monitoring of
the market for signs of increased or decreased hype surrounding the space. With no real
revenues or assets, this stock is affected far more dramatically by sentiment towards the
space than it is by actual developments at the company.


Organovo - longer term investment thesis


Organovo is hoping to one day commercialize technology that generates human tissues.
The company hopes that its technology could one day generate tissues for use in drug
discovery and development, biological research, and therapeutic implants. The previous

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 10/53


technologies in the field have relied on monolayer (2D) cell cultures. Organovo hopes to
create constructs in 3D that could potentially replicate human biology.


According to the 10-K, Organovo's technology is derived from the research of Dr. Gabor
Forgacs, a professor at the University of Missouri. The company currently holds licenses
to patents from the University of Missouri-Columbia, Clemson University, and Becton
Dickinson. The Company has outright ownership of six other patents.


Organovo's path to its current point in the development process has been long but the
company still has far to go.


In 2004 Dr. Forgacs began working on organ printing at the University of Missouri-
Columbia when his team was awarded the $5 million National Science Foundation
Frontiers in Integrative Biological Research (FIBR) grant. This same team subsequently
filed the first patent application for the NovoGen™ bioprinting platform. Following the
technological developments under Dr. Forgacs direction, a founding team formed and
Organovo incorporated in 2007. In July 2008 the company raised $3 million in angel
funding, and Organovo opened laboratories in San Diego in January 2009. As Organovo
continues down the path towards commercialization, the company has entered into
collaborative research agreements with pharmaceutical corporations and federal grants as
well. The company first began to form corporate partnerships in the drug discovery area
with pharmaceutical and biotech companies in March 2011. In February 2012 the
company went public in a $15.2 million financing round. Clearly, the company has grown
enormously since its $3 million angel investment in 2008 and $15.2 million financing round
in 2012, one-and-a-half years ago. However, Organovo's technology remains
extraordinarily speculative and conceptual. It is likely 10 years away from being any sort of
reality.


The key to the company's technology is the NovoGen MMX Bioprinter™ which the
company proudly states it developed within two-and-a-half years of commencing
operations. Organovo's technologies enable various types of tissues to be created using
combinations of three types of building blocks that themselves include combinations of
"bio-ink" comprised of only cells and "hydrogel" comprised of biocompatible gel. The
company believes that at least part of the tissues its technology creates could be
constructed solely of cells, a key differentiator from older technologies. This feature
enables Organovo to generate architecturally and compositionally defined functional
human tissues for in vitro use in drug discovery and development. This can potentially
allow more efficient drug development by eliminating the need for actual human subjects
in some cases. To illustrate the enormous utility of this, imagine how much more efficient it

would be to test drugs on human tissue that can be constructed in a lab than it would be to
test drugs on actual people who must be recruited and for whom safety must be assured.
Moreover, tissues created using Organovo's technology may be more effective than
animal testing. Organovo's fully cellular constructs may also offer advantages in
regenerative medicine such as augmenting or replacing damaged tissues. In addition to
products for use in drug discovery/development and regenerative medicine, Organovo
plans to sell 3D bioprinters for use in medical research and a portfolio of consumables for
use with the bioprinters. The role of consumables is conceptually similar to the role of ink
in the business model of traditional printer manufacturers.


While the products Organovo is developing may, in the long term, represent significant
advances over today's technology, the company is innovating in a rapidly changing field,
and by the time the company's products reach the market, the landscape may be very
different. While Organovo works on their 3D printing technology, pharmaceutical, biotech
and diagnostic companies, as well as research institutions and government agencies are
pursuing related technologies that have the potential to make Organovo's technology
obsolete. In fact, the scariest thing is that it is very possible that this obsolescence could
occur before the company is even able to realize any material revenues from its
technology.

Well done. Valuation always counts, and even if Organovo's bio-printers see success they are selling to a very niche

Although I agree that ONVO is currently overvalued, I disagree that their success would confine them to a
niche market. 
If successful, they will revolutionize preclinical drug testing and create human tissues for implantation. These
two applications fit the needs of many industries.

A niche market? You mean like the liver market? Kidneys? Heart? Just for starters. Perhaps, the breast
cancer cell niche market? Gee, um, are there other cancers out there that need a remedy? Of course, there's
the niche market of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Then, you have bones, ears, skin tissue, burns, scars....I
mean the list just goes on and on and on. The market for this is wide open. You can say this is a specialized
market, but where this technology can be used is really limitless.


Have you guys read the paper written about bioprinting from UC Berkeley's Dept. of Engineering?


There's more than liver assays going on. There's been big work on breast cancer cells. An actual living ear
has been printed and is in animal testing now. Yo.

SA was saying the same about RGLS @ 4/pps I bought 750 shares


I appreciate this person has an opinion and swings in pps offer opportunities to buy more if you are or want to go long

You didn't really assess the full potential of the printing tech and how it can transform taking new products to market.
sounds like you got burned on the way up.... I'll double up if it drops.

Two problems with the article: 1)the repeated refrain of years away from revenues. The liver assay is expected in
2014 and the revenues could be substantial. 2) The article seems to assume the $100 million dilution will happen all
at once and touts that as 25%. There is nothing to substantiate that timing. I feel it is more likely that it will be spread
over time as funds are needed. Gee, maybe I should use the author's wording regarding revenues; the dilution is
likely years away.

The volatility in this continues to be nuts, even after it moved to NYSE MKT. If anything, it seems even more volatile
after it moved to MKT.


I think my curiosity is: now that it's moved up to NYSE MKT and is trading over $5, could you get small cap stock fund
managers looking at it (whether you agree with the fundamentals/valuation or not?)

"Almost all revenues (only a few hundred thousand dollars per quarter) at present are the result of government grants
and research collaborations. Revenues from actual product sales are still years away at best."


I believe this is the biggest red flag. A business completely reliant on the government is not much of a business at all.

Gold Fund - and that is the biggest problem with the article. The statement is false. The company is not years
away from revenue. 2014 is just around the corner. Check out the liver assay to be sold to Pharma. Could be
huge. Pearson purports to do "deep" research for his articles. Seems that he whiffed on something
fundamental like when the company is projecting their first commercial product. Big Pharma will decide the
value of that and when, not Pearson.


24 Jul 2013, 02:44 PM


Mukticat
The biggest red flags are that they have spent so much money and created so much dilution and are so far from
having a salable product that they will have to continue running the printing presses from here on out issuing many
hundreds of millions of shares to fund this experiment. Of course by then that it won't matter.

I have to agree with you jussayin52. I even if the company posted 200% growth the shorts will use their math
and PR to tank the stock.  
It just happened to AMD after posting better than projected earnings. 
Formulas bend to the wanted end result. We have become a traders market and not an investor market. It is
unfortunate for innovative companies like Organovo. I am long on this so the idea survives. It will help many
and is working.

beepaw: No. His article represents one opinion. No investor should take action on the basis of reading any
article anywhere. If you encounter information that is disconcerting to your established position, then you
need to do your own due diligence to determine if the information is credible. This is the only way to attain the
conviction to take action. No shortcuts are available.


I have seen numerous instances of subscribers reading an article and, in the case of selling, make the knee-
jerk move of selling immediately. This is stupid and ill-advised. Anyone that does it should not be attempting
to manage his/her own investments. This type of behavior reflects a total lack of understanding of the
investing environment.

It is true, what you're betting on with this company is that they can actually make this invention work...and watch out if
they do.


Did anyone see the video on 3D bioprinting on CBS Sunday Morning two Sundays ago? It originally aired in April
2013. This guy Pearson might want to check it out, then read what the School of Engineering at UC Berkeley has to
say about this technology and this company...it may not be as far as off as he thinks nor as speculative.

The 3D Printing stocks (3D, SSYS, XONE, DASTY, AMAVF, and ONVO are speculative, but in my opinion they are
good to hold for the long term as a small position in your portfolio, as it is likely that several of these could be long
term home runs (100+ baggers). So even if ONVO drops back to $4, there is no way to time when this stock could
simply explode to the upside based on breakthrough news over the next several years. So if you believe in the long
term game changing prospects of bio printing, then just hold on to the roller coaster, because if you try and time it, you
could miss out on even bigger short term explosive gains.

24 Jul 2013, 07:15 PM


SA Editor Douglas W. House, Contributor
The responses to Mr. Pearson’s article are shining examples of why shorts have to have more conviction than longs.
It can be a lonely endeavor. Ultimately, for some, the details of a bearish rationale matter little. What seems to matter
most is the audacity of a contributor who publishes an article that casts doubt on certain retail investors’ well-
researched thoroughly vetted long positions. Vitriol-filled personal attacks and insults are the emotional trademarks of
people who feel threatened. Psychologists call this a confirmation bias. People with this bias discount, ignore or react
negatively to information that contradicts their strong opinion. In the extreme, physical confrontation can even occur.


Although we all possess this bias on a wide range of issues, in the investing arena it is especially pernicious. What
one views as the investment of the century, another sees as a superlative short. Biases account for a large part of
these strong perceptions. Being aware of this truth-distorting phenomenon is a big part of the battle for investment
survival. When I establish a position, long or short, I constantly scour the investing landscape for contrarian
information. Maybe I missed something. Maybe my analysis or thesis is flawed. Maybe my biases caused me to
discount valuable information. If I find such information, I follow up on it. If my research confirms it, I will change my
opinion in a nanosecond. One person can’t know everything. One person can’t do all the research on all investment
candidates all the time. Other opinions and analyses can be extraordinarily valuable time savers for retail investors.
Getting married to a sexy story and getting caught up in the hype may provide the excitement of a casino, but it ain’t
the way to the Promised Land.


What Mr. Pearson is simply stating is that the timing is not right for a long position in ONVO. He supports his opinion
with data and his personal experience with comparable situations. If you disagree with his thesis (or any contributor’s)
and feel compelled to participate, then support your comment with your rational analysis. Make your argument with
data. Personal attacks add zero value to the discussion and make the commenter appear inexperienced. The
numerous emotional responses indicate to me that some subscribers’ reading comprehension ceased after the
finishing the first paragraph.


ONVO is a speculative stock based on a sexy story. That’s all it is. It doesn’t mean that the company is a fraud or
management is just a bunch of hypsters. It just means that it will be many years before the firm is able to generate the
substantial revenue and profit that would justify its valuation going forward. The market always overreaches on the
“next big thing”. There are very few experienced investors that would even consider a “buy and hold” approach to an
emerging company like ONVO. Too much uncertainty. Too much volatility. This is a trader’s stock.


My personal approach with speculative stocks is to wait until the company delivers on a major strategy or initiative.
This confirms its value proposition and reduces the risk that its business model will not gain traction. As far as ONVO
is concerned, I am waiting to see if it can close a substantial follow-on collaboration agreement with Pfizer or United
Therapeutics. This would be a highly credible validation of its strategy, especially if the contract value is $5M+. In the

absence of collaboration revenue, ONVO will be relying solely on occasional government grants for income until it
launches the liver assay in mid-or-late 2014. When the launch commences, I will be keenly interested in the product’s
uptake, especially considering its planned $8k - $10k price. If the uptake is robust, then all is well. There will be ample
opportunities to make money on a long position post launch.


Until these events happen, punters will be captive to the whims of investor sentiment and to the vicissitudes of noise
traders. It will be a stomach-churning rollercoaster. It will be exciting. It should be fun to watch.


24 Jul 2013, 07:44 PM


winnail
It is fine to have the courage of your convictions(per Mr.House).It's the framing of these statements I take
exception to. No vitriol here;maybe some sarcasm.Mr.Person is correct when he states Onvo is overpriced
where current earnings vs. pps is concerned.The company is not making money......yet.Mr.Pers... "Any
material revenues are still years away at best".Pretty sure that is a personal conjecture/opinion .Onvo plans to
have their liver assay test kits on the market sometime in 2014.Who to believe?Maybe what revenues Onvo
accrues will be worthless to their bottom line.Here's a statement I'm not sure about.."When the warrents are
exercised the holder is then left with the shares which must be sold" Not sure anybody HAS to sell their
shares and the fact that 32 million shares would put undo pressure on a stock trading 5 million shares a day
..maybe for 2 weeks. The author then takes the s-3 filing(Onvo: over the next THREE years we plan on
raising $100 million dollars through sale of common stock,warrents,and/ or preferred stock) to mean they are
going to drop 100 million worth of stock on the market all at once- these guys are a little smarter than that,I
could be wrong .Again,who to trust/believe? Will leave you all with a little framing of my own,from what could
be construed as a negative last paragraph from the author -"the products Organova is developing may, in the
long term,represent significant advantages over today's technology".


25 Jul 2013, 02:28 AM


dcmorris
The author has written a fine stock thesis of possible futures for Organovo. Every worst case scenario except the
takeover angle was put forth with accuracy. I'd say most worthy of an application to write for the big boys at the short
table. Thanks for the update sir, but I know these things already.


I am invested in this company and couldn't care less if it makes money...my wife does. There are millions of hurting
people out there suffering, including some in my family, that this break through platform could/would have helped and
I'm here to defend that possible future. I will keep my investment steady and hopefully this 'stock' will be controlled by
shareholders that don't want to kill it over $6.51. This is ours after all... JMO, peace

User 11755301
Dear Author, I'm not sorry if your short position is losing. I own .012% of the company. Your article really offends me.
My advice to you is that you just buy the stock to hedge your bad short, because you can't stop the tide from coming
in. People know that Organovo is a strong buy. As for your analysis: You don't judge a development stage company
on fundamentals, you have to include its potential, how long it will take that potential to be realized, and how profitable
that potential will be once it IS realized. You also have to include market timing. The closer to the floor you can buy in,
the better... and it's not going to get any cheaper than now. Organovo JUST HIT THE EXCHANGE. It's not going to
get any lower than it is. You shorted the wrong stock. It's not going to drop. Organovo never had an ipo... imagine if it
HAD had one. Where do you think it would be today? Think of this as an ipo. Compare it to xone. ONVO is a one of a
kind company... 3D Bio. Unique. That commands a price... exclusive domain of its field... Organovo can be expected
to rise to levels commensurate with that potential. Organovo has been printing liver, muscles... eventually it will be
hearts, livers, bones, vocal chords, faces... etc... even if it were years away, getting in at the bottom would be
smartest. Organovo (or the company which buys them) will make hundreds of billions... Even if they NEVER got past
the FDA they could still provide samples to labs, or sell implants to the rest of the world (thai doctors, if nothing else).
Furthermore, your analysis left out the potential for a buyout.


So, again, your article offends me deeply, considering that I presently own .012% of Organovo, and if it falls it will ruin
my life. But I will give you good advice for free: Cover your shorts, &/or buy the stock as a hedge for your short,
because I don't want you to get burned in an awful short squeeze. ONVO is not riding high enough to short, at this
level. Every tech / biotech fund in the world is run by someone who is thinking ONVO looks like a nice peach to add to
the portfolio. It's one of a kind. Open up a graph of ole XONE and study it very carefully. It is a great analogy except
for one thing: ONVO could make even more money with what it does... because quality of life is priceless. The media
will start in on ONVO soon, and once that happens it could become a new TSLA...or DDD. Moreover, Tech & Biotech
Institutional investors (fund managers) were not able to invest in ONVO as a pink sheet. Now it's listed, & they want it.
Therefore it will rise.


So just cover your shorts and buy options (or shares), instead. Sorry if you got burned on the second climb... I got
burned very badly on the drop... but I think you are wrong if you think ONVO is dropping more... it is at bottom. There
is alot of excitement around this company, and you can't just make that go away...


As for the rest of you, I have to advise you to do this: HOLD YOUR SHARES. Shorts can't cover until they pay you for
your shares. So make sure they pay you full value --> Shorts -have- to cover. If you insist, and hold, they will offer
more and more and more, until you are thrilled with what they desperately offer. So hold... Make sure they pay for
forcing your stock prices down... he, or others just like him, drove it down from 8.5; they are the ones who have been
abusively shorting hard at market close, each day, to manipulate the ONVO closing price so it looks lower, as if it's
ONVO were dropping when people have been buying at the ask price ALL DAY LONG. I have been watching ONVO
for 2 weeks, with lidless eyes. They've done it 4/5 of the past days. So HOLD YOUR SHARES. Make them pay full
price. ONVO is worth much more than it is trading at right now. Let them cover at $25.

and now they've all become trading wizards. To them no stock can be too expensive compared to current and near-
term (a few years out) conceivable possibilities. It's as if ONVO were about to begin selling 'Make-a-Kidney-@-Home'
kits next year. Slap a half billion dollar valuation on a company with a million or two in revenues? No problem. Watch
the company sell millions of shares at these prices? No problem. Traditional normal valuation metrics? Who needs
them.


Retail momos (momentum traders) are creating a feeding feast for insiders and shorts and they are about to learn
how to become bagholders for failing to recognize the difference between a trade and an investment.


We've seen it again and again with companies such as UNXL, KNDI, CLNT, RSOL; all brief darlings and high-flyers of
the momo set eventually crash back to earth (or near-earth).

So reminiscent of other recent pump and dumps like KNDI and UNXL.


Very soon the baggies are going to start getting margin calls on their losing ONVO positions forcing further
rounds of selloffs. Consider it a 'long squeeze'.


25 Jul 2013, 10:34 AM


Mukticat
Not to beat a dying horse here but by tomorrow many ONVO investors are going to be facing margin calls.
This is the inverse of the much beloved short-squeeze. In fact you could call it a long-squeeze.


There's going to forced selling which will further drive the stock down thereby forcing even more longs into
margin call situations. It has a snowball effect which rewards those who cut their losses first.


After a few days of descent we'll see our first deadcat bounce which should bring the stock back to the high
4's/low 5's.


30 Jul 2013, 03:16 PM


Mukticat
Just to add a little more color to the current action-


From trough to peak the stock gained 112% (4 to 8.50). Based on today's AH price of 5.50 the stock is now
only up 37%. Those who owned ONVO prior to uplisting still have a little gain left but it's vanishing fast. Those
who got swept up in the mania to own a piece of Print-An-Organ-At-Home post-uplisting are now deeply
underwater.


The way these pump and dumps which are designed as capital raises for the companies (see KNDI and
UNXL for recent examples) work is that very soon ONVO will announce a deal to sell some institutions a few
million shares in the high 4's with warrants as sweeteners. This is part of the deal that allows institutions
(herewith referred to by the colloquial 'tutes') to short it high and cover low from the company.


You might ask why the company didn't just sell shares while the stock was in the 7's and 8's? Because
institutions are not retail traders and they know that that valuation was patently absurd. Bottomline none of
them would have bought a share. The company doesn't mind either since there really wasn't any way to
capture that price anyway without an ATM (At-The-Market) shelf offering in place. An ATM would have
allowed them to sell shares directly into the market. But they'll be very happy to get high 4's anyway and the
money will fund their lab experiment through another year of high cash burn.


Where does that leave the 'baggies' (bagholders who paid more than 5.50 a share)? In investing the pain of a
loss is felt much more acutely than the joy of a gain. It's basic psychology. It also reorients objectives. Gone is
the hoping that ONVO becomes a 3, 4, 10-bagger to be replaced by 'OMG! How do I minimize my losses?!?'
Thus the millions of shares held that traded above 5.50 become a formidable wall of resistance should the
stock try to move up now. Everyone's trying to cut their losses. Then when you add in the forced margin sales
along with investors waking up and throwing in the towel it adds up to further downward pressure.

I don't expect anyone to believe me anymore than they did when I warned KNDI or UNXL investors of the
exact same thing . . . which unfolded exactly as I predicted.

janeborrowman
So you think that ONVO is a pump and dump stock, Muk? Really, do you? It's an honest question.


I understand your strategy and psychology on how the downward pressures work, but a pump and dump?


You don't think this company is legit at all? You don't think ONVO has any assays or animal testing going on?
Just a pump and dump?


I'm asking you honestly.


31 Jul 2013, 10:01 AM


Mukticat
There's pump and dumps and then there's pump and dumps. Obviously at one end of the spectrum you have
all kinds of OTC and pinksheet stocks that have absolutely nothing going on and yet they are routinely sold as
the next 'print-an-organ' or something akin to that to the retail crowd. The promoters are either the company
itself - which may be trying to raise cash or cash out the insiders - or it can be promoters wholly unrelated to
the co. At the other end there are legitimate companies that are also promoted for usually the same reasons.
You have to look at the individual company to see which kind of p'n'd it is.


To me ONVO is probably more of the latter since they appear to be engaged in legitimate research. Did the
company orchestrate it? Clearly the uplisting seems to have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams and
created its own p'n'd situation which the company is only too eager to cash in on it by rushing to sell more
shares before the price collapses again.


How the monetizing of the overpricing happens as previously explained involves shearing the retail buyers
who are only too glad to overpay for a stock. They do this by selling shares to institutional buyers at a deep
discount-to-market. That discount, and the fact that uplisting did nothing to alter the valuation of the company
so the stock will fade anyway, will drive ONVO back down to it's previous overvaluated level of 4.00.


But they will emerge from this with a replenished bank account to pay their salaries and benefits for a couple
more years. The same cannot be said of the hope and dreams of the retail investors foolish enough to buy a
stock that had already doubled in price, not value.


So yes, any stock that screams up from 4 to 8.50 and drops back to 5.00 within a month is about as pumpy-
dumpy as they get.

Looks like you might succeed in this round, but we all know this is far from over. Pretty simple to figure a price
correction with the S-3 effect filing, simple dilution with this already informed of 100mil equity offering by a
company at this stage should be obvious to all. This is normal progression of a developmental company and
the inevitable virus from equity financing should also be obvious. You say the long position is pumped and
flawed, yet you seem to be the only one actively pumping(dumping) a position. Really the only news you
haven't disclosed is the fine upstanding financiers that will get the privilege of your coattail riding.


You see a chance to lovingly squeeze the audacity out of Organovo while reaping the vic out of the future
operating cash, more so than the probable burn rate you demonize. Time honored tradition of Wall Street
right? I see a company with potential products and market that will be worth a bazillion dollars soon, and a
willingness to pay your price to get there. Organovo is proprietary, it's why they had a market value of 300mil
in June before this quintillion started, and you can not change that with economic derivatives or derogatory
colloquials. Here's one from the playground Mukky, deadcat bounce, you guys have all the cool names. Keep
it up, you've earned the respect that you deserve.


Where is the author of this article? I see he wrote on the stocks you purport to have warned investors on, or
are you really Pearson guised as this moniker? No, then you are just his delivery boy. No more waiting on
you.

Well, I can think of many many more truly "pumpy-dumpy" stocks - you know the ones of the penny stock
variety. You see it all the time - wild claims, rush, quick, buy now - we found gold in them thar hills. There's no
real company at all, just the hype. Strictly.


You've put ONVO in the pump and dump pure junk category very unfairly. It's truly an unfair characterization
of this company, and even the rise and fall of the stock price...albeit, at an accelerated rate...some of it
organic, some of it not so much.


Serious question: Do you know what this company is doing? Do you know anything about the people who sit
on the board of directors? Do you really know anything about this company?


Granted, the stuff they're working on sounds like science fiction, but it is a legitimate company, and it
seemingly is coming very close to realizing some viable and unbelievable discoveries. Now, those discoveries
may or may not be a go, but this is what people are betting on - that they are going to do it. Again, I don't think
any of us are being deluded by the exorbitant P/E ratio. We see it. We get it that it's OUT OF SIGHT. We get it
that it's a pure speculation play.


When you call a company a "pump and dump," even you can agree that what you're saying is that this
company is a farce. I think you have to be careful with your terms.


However, to use this sort of tactic does serve you shorts well, it helps you to fully manipulate the price of the
stock...and you've been smug about it, as well.

It is important to understand that ANY STOCK can be pumped and dumped. I have seen totally legit
companies whose stock was pumped by people outside the co. for their own gain. I have no opinion on this
stock, but the idea that a pump must be a shell company is not correct.

Any stock can be pumped and dumped but it helps to have a low float and a cohort of easily gulled retail
momentum traders. As to whether KNDI's an empty vessel or not I'll leave to others to decide. What it clearly

Apparently you are still not getting things. No one is disputing the revenues, its inside the SEC filing 10Q that
'is' being looked at. Their income has been discernible for many quarters, yet you continue to trot it out like
you have the best interest of the retail Organovo investors in mind while actually dumping your misdirection
on us. The company says product launch in 2014, so that is fuzzy and I will give that one to you. A wise
commentator here says fuzzy lines are what we need to work on. Good advice and you should have a light
bulb moment here.


BTW 75000 shares were unlocked and put into the market at $5.60.  
Did you use any of those new shares to cover?  
Avg Vol of 3.957mil with less than 1.5% short float, your warnings had nothing to do with market driven

For anyone tempted to sell... the only institutional target figure set for ONVO was set at $6, and that was back when it
was a pink sheet. That should be much higher, now that it's publicly traded on an exchange, where institutional
demand is higher. Furthermore, the SPO target figure is set at $10. That should give you an idea what the board
thinks the stock is really worth.

For Organovo, I just want to highlight one thing for investors. When you invest your money on this
concept/technology, you'd better be prepared as being an Venture Capitalist instead of a normal shareholder.
Everyone one knows the formula: High return = High risk. Don't follow anyone but your heart on it. It's about
contesting how great with your homework and how much confidence of what you doing. And I believe what I have
done with mine. Trust yourself.

crime to manipulate stock prices with deception. Spamming over actively trading 5000 investors with a
painfully wordy [and deceptive] article entitled "ONVO ... set to drop" is certainly something I would consider
potentially manipulative... You made money off of it..others lost... by many accounts, the article was
deceptive... So, IMO it is a strong candidate for categorizing as blatant stock manipulation... and that is why I
posted the link, and furthermore why I reported my findings to the SEC. I don't like being robbed. There's
nothing I can do for myself, here. So I tender my plight to the SEC who might decide it was manipulation, or
not. I just want to make sure they get reports from each and every investor who feels as if this article might
have deceptively manipulated their stock at a time when many people felt insecure about a making new
investment [a real investment - not a short], and thereby instantly & falsely depreciated the value of their
investment, and scared many people out entirely, in a panic, or caused them to sell at an exaggeratedly
reduced price, or forced them into a margin call, or into RISK of a margin call -- all that in conjunction with
some exceedingly aggressive short selling activity on the market ...All so that one short could fleece them of
their savings and retirement. So again. If the SEC thinks it's guilt then it probably is. I filed my report, and
made sure everyone here has a chance to report on their own experience, as they see fit. The more people
who respond, the more likely the SEC will address the problem, if they determine that it IS a problem. So file
away, guys. You might get your money back even still. File, and leave it to the SEC.

Hopefully you'll grow up and learn to take responsibility for your trading mistakes. But in the meantime why
don't you document what you think was 'deceptive and manipulative' for us? Words are cheap. Take us point
by point through what Pearson said and show how it was false. That will make it easier for the rest of us to
also report this to the SEC so that hopefully they will clamp down on free speech and only allow things that
you think pass muster.

Actually there are two reasons ONVO investors should file with the SEC. First is this article, which clearly
manipulated the price (the stock went into free fall 15 minutes after this article posted). The other is
aggressive short selling (already a violation) at market close, to lower the price below gainful (patternistic).
I've reported both to the SEC. I hope others will follow suit. I would not be surprised if the unscrupulous
person doing this were a short investor, trying to make his gains during the day by selling tons of securities
that he doesn't even own. Take the time to report it to the SEC, guys. It will be sooo worth it.


26 Jul 2013, 05:14 PM


Mukticat
You can fulminate all you want but you're obviously such a novice that you don't realize that news and articles
move stocks both up and down. Nothing wrong with that. Selling or buying at the close is a time-honored
tradition that happens with hundreds of stocks.


But it does appear you've invented a brand new rule; no 'aggressive' short-selling at the close. Could you find
me a link to the SEC regulations that prohibit such a thing and how is 'aggressive' defined? Is 'aggressive'
buying also prohibited?

Enforcement Tips and Complaints


Manipulation of a security's price or volume --> artificially cutting through all levels of bid support to force the
stock to a negative (red level) at market close, in order to cause the price to look low when trading is bull on
ONVO. 
Insider trading --> The author was short, and SA spammed 5000+ ONVO actively trading shareholders with a
bear message. 
False or misleading statements about a company (including false or misleading SEC reports or financial
statements) --> Misinterpreting the financials to the investors for the purpose of trading on the drop in price
(shorting) 
Other fraudulent conduct --> who knows.


Abusive Naked Short Selling [is what I was remembering] --> You're right. I didn't understand what this
meant... now I see it refers to something that never would have occurred to me... selling a stock and failing to
deliver.


So there are many abuses I see here which are clearly listed on the SEC site for reporting complaints. That's
what made it so easy for me to fill out the form. Maybe I can win back [from the SEC whistle-blower
compensation program] what I lost to market manipulation.

For you information the exchanges only look for a company to meet their minimum listing requirements. They're in it
for the money and the more companies they can get the better. They were only too happy to welcome the Chinese
reverse merger frauds.


But you're right about one thing; most retail longs have no clue how to even find and read the SEC filings. That's why
they're always shocked to find out all the negatives about a company they never knew or considered. Naturally when
confronted with the information they simply shut their ears and cry 'Manipulation!'

janeborrowman
You know, Mukiteemuk, your posts are pretty mean-spirited. It almost seems like you're in cahoots with
Pearson. Short yourself, are we? How much did you profit from the "short stink bomb"?


There was a very well written article by Napodano which did detail and rebut all the false and very misleading
information by Pearson. It was a very cohesive and COGENT article.


26 Jul 2013, 11:58 AM


Mukticat
Considering the kind of accusations of willful deception and manipulation and other ad hominens (that SA
deletes) being thrown at the author my posts hardly qualify as 'mean-spirited'.


What has become clear is that we have about 50 comments all complaining about vague charges and yet
there's no attempt to actually take Pearsons points apart and debate them. Most posters appear to have no
clue why the article is 'manipulative' other than it contradicts their hopes to profit from the company and
therefore must be wrong. At best they'll refer to another article - which they don't understand any better than
Pearson's but that takes their side in the argument - as a rebuttal.


I've followed Pearson for awhile and his picks have been pretty golden so yes I believe he's a pretty darn
good analyst. I've seen that he doesn't respond much to the furious comments his articles engender for, I'm
guessing, the very reason I cite above; they're not challenging his points as much as just complaining about
them.

I like your comments, makes me verify my convictions. But IMO, comments like "most posters appear to have

some know how to read sec filings. Looking forward to continuing the discussion.


26 Jul 2013, 03:44 PM


Mukticat
Sorry if I paint with too broad a brush sometimes but I find most retail traders to be pretty clueless about
trading and investing and it's reflected in their comments. They just complain about the article and hurl
charges without knowing anything about it. There are some SA boards - I'm thinking UNXL - that actually
have some pretty learned commentators on both sides, just not ONVO or KNDI boards that I have frequented
lately. Actually I have to take that back a little; KNDI has some pretty smart commentators on the long side so
maybe just ONVO for now.


As for your unanswered question about why Pearson presumes a short interest would climb to about 25% just
take a look at this list;


http://bit.ly/hIJMpb


Dozens of the most popular shorts - of which I have several - sport short interests higher than 25%. I don't
think ONVO will be any different since to most pros this looks like a first-rate short.


Consider another of Pearson's points; since when does an uplisting double the worth of a company? Shorts
notice that, see nothing is different, that the company is still years from having tangible results, and smell
opportunity.

You do paint with a very broad stroke, but you seem to only speak to a few. For fun, if you still feel like taking,
since the author has chosen not to answer the posed questions on this board but you say he is a ' pretty darn
good analyst' with picks that are 'pretty golden' would you give your rebuttal to the following vague charges? 
Jermanis 
justsayin52 
OREGON DON 
hhess13892 
Then maybe a look in the mirror with Douglas and your short sided bias would be interesting(he is the twice
quoted author).


As for my question, that's a very scary list you linked, one that my money will avoid. SIRI was my first
exposure to the short position and I still can't figure out why you guys find listening to programming worth
destroying. You never really answered the question of how there will be a 25% short position with the fact of
what this company has for products.


I agree that ONVO is not in a position at this time(up listing) to be valued at these current levels and is a $5
dollar stock. 8-12 months from now when the products have been launched, things will be different. How
many pharmaceuticals, research labs and for that matter, hospitals are there that will employ this technology?
In a relative short time, not years, this company will have a market cap of a bazillion and I feel that there will
be no shares for you to short. As far as smelling opportunity and the sophistication that is employed, that is a
subject I have further questions on. 
JMO, peace

When I have a little time I'd be happy to take a crack at your list dcmorris. Maybe tomorrow (party today). I
appreciate your lack of breathless hyperbole.


I will just clear up one point; shorts are not an organization. We don't have a leader or a charter or
membership. We don't strategize and target companies. We're all independent and we short different co's as
is our wont and right. I'm the majority short interest in some companies that most other shorts have never
heard of. I've never shorted SIRI or NFLX but if I did it wouldn't be to 'destroy' them, it would be to take money
from other investors who I felt were overpaying for a stock. It's a value judgement on the the fundamentals or
technicals of the stock price, nothing else.


Frankly I think that's far more moral than the longs who fund the war machine or destructive agribusiness by
buying Northrup or Monsanto or other companies.

This didn't take long, I think you've nail the crux between our positions. It is a value judgement. Longs invest
in something they believe will grow, and as you say, 'take money from investors' who make the fundamental
mistake of paying to much for that growth is the counter position. Seems like a good definition of destroy,
considering it is companies and lives that are ultimately effected. Question would be, can stupid be fixed
another way? Later it is then, I've got a date with Long Island ice teas myself. Salute.

What a load of malarky. You're in it for the 'good' of the company?? Gimmeabreak. You're not here to help the
company, you're here to profit from the company. How do I know? Because you wouldn't knowingly put
money into a company that you thought would lose it just to help them out or at best break even. So you're in
it to make the bucks same as I am. You may call yourself an 'investor' but what actual good has your
investment brought the company? Can you cite anything?


In the end we're all just traders. Given the right price you would sell your stock but it just happens to be
different from mine.


So spare us your moral outrage and go enjoy your adult beverage.


28 Jul 2013, 08:29 PM


dcmorris
Aww Muk...no one showed up for your party, I hear it happens though. I apologize for posting my evening
plans on the beach, I certainly do not condone adult beverage abuse.


As far as rage goes, I do not live my life in any type of fear. Might I suggest Chopra's 6th Law of Detachment,
it is very freeing. You remind me of the words of James Keenan:


Angels on the sidelines, baffled and confused 
Father blessed them all with reason, and this is what they choose 
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground 
Silly monkeys give them thumbs  
They make a club and beat their brother down


Let me end by citing my investment theory on this company: I hope you never have to lose a child because of
some drug interaction that caused a lethal toxin in her liver that could have been found by a new technology
that Organovo is perfecting. My 'moral' motivation is that this company makes money. Once again JMO,

Mr. Pearson: I note that you have neglected to respond to any of the comments thus far. This doesn't reflect well on
you. Not all of the comments warrant a response, of course, but some do. The absence of a Contributor's participation
in this aspect of the "job" points to less-than-honorable intentions. I must agree with sathkumara. You need to defend
your thesis, especially after Mr. Napodano's response. You better step up promptly or many subscribers will perceive
you as just another shyster manipulating retail investors for a quick buck.

Mr.Pearson has,so far,self indicted himself.to his and other readers. I suggest that SA when a posted article stating a
strong position to buy or sell is prepared for publication that it be reviewed by a professional board to verify the
data/facts to insure an honest representation.This is known as DUE DILIGENCE in the legal world.This is intended to
protect the innocent and maybe not too knowledgeable investor which if not done will become a CLASS ACTION
SCENARIO for losses incurred resulting from dishonest/manipulative... of facts or data.Hold on to yor hats

Always lots of words but no specifics. Pearson's published dozens of articles critical of different companies
and every single time the longs freak out and jump up and down claiming 'dishonest manipulation' etc. But no
one seems to be able to actually refute his thesis. Yes they may find a point or two of opinion that could be
argued either way but the body of work remains unchallenged.


You mention class-actions? I've seen two SA articles result in class-actions . . . against the companies being
exposed. UNXL and CALL. The longs screamed bloody murder but lawyers reviewed the charges and found
them plenty credible. They're in court now.


Btw- I've never seen longs complain that an article was biased towards the long pov. Wonder why that is?


27 Jul 2013, 03:00 PM


janeborrowman
Muk, you keep saying that "no one seems to be able to actually refute his (Pearson's) thesis." Some thesis.
Really, thesis? I think you mean "hypothesis" - a proposition to be proved or one advanced without proof (for
real).


I just don't know how you can say that, especially in light of Napodano's article. There's been many intelligent
rebuttals to Pearson's article...all respectfully written without calling anyone "stupid." Unlike yourself - your
posts are very insulting.


Talk about an infantile food fight. Have you read your posts? Yo. Do you really lack that much insight?

28 Jul 2013, 08:37 AM


Mukticat
Speaking of pump and dumps which is, after all, the point of the Pearson story how have things gone since he
published this at 9am last Wednesday, July 24th?


The stock started the session that day by spiking up to 7.50, then slumped, then closed at 6.70. Then it traded from
the low-to-mid 6 range for the next three days. As is usual with highly manipulated stocks the first hour of trading was
marked by extreme peaks and valleys.


Today, July 30, the stock dropped below 6.00 and doesn't seem to want to recover. This tells that the company is
making progress putting together an equity deal from the recent $100M registration. Once hedge funds and other
investors know what the terms are- how many shares at what discount-to-market they begin to short with abandon
knowing they have a locked-in guaranteed profit. Sell at today's high prices and cover with cheaper shares direct from
the company.


It's a win-win-win; the company wins since they get a bunch of money, the hedge funds win because they get a
sackload of money, and the retail shorts win for exactly the same reason. And all this was made possible by the
company bamboozling the retail crowd into handing over the dough.


The funny thing is that the retail will blame the shorts instead of the company! The company created the opportunity in
order to raise more cash from the longs and we were just the middlemen rounding up the moolah and delivering it to
them after keeping a portion for ourselves. Don't shoot the messenger/delivery boy!

Hi 12795341,


While it is most certain that most retail traders did not understand, or frankly want to understand, the Pearson
article hopefully my comments being fairly brief and usually confined to one or two topics may have left an
impression? If nothing else, like at the Yahoo swampboards, debating the longs forces me to do research I
might have sluffed off otherwise. And if I manage to switch on a lightbulb or two in the process so much the
better.

Yesterday I posted that the plunge to mid 5's would trigger forced margin selling and that therefore those who
sold the soonest would do the best. Today we plunged another 7%. Did anyone listen? Generally investors
are given the morning to trade out of a position themselves (or wire more money into the account) and at
1:00pm the brokers usually take matters into their own hands (oftentimes people can't bear to pull the trigger
themselves so they defer that to the broker). You can see clearly that at 1 pm the stock which had been
gradually recovering from 5 back to 5.35 began an uninterrupted slide back to 5.07.


This bull market has created some truly great shorts! Novice traders are making money riding the wave but it
also affects their judgment making them feel invincible as though they were really good traders. Then they
become unafraid to pay any price for the next big thing.


I've begun to cover ONVO just as I covered KNDI at 4.50 and didn't try to ride that one all the way back to
3.50 whence it came from. I also recently covered UNXL in the 13's following its crash from the 30's. Likewise
I'm willing to accord some gain to ONVO's uplisting meaning it will probably bottom in the 4.50 range too for
now. So I'm beginning to cover and after today I'm down to -85,000 shares which fortunately I was able to get
from a broker that doesn't charge interest on borrows (otherwise you're forking over the equivalent of 50% a
year, about 4% a month, just to hold the position though it hardly matters if the stock is dropping 45% in a
matter of days).

People it is recommended that you exercise caution when exiting tall buildings today. ONVO is currently trading down
15% in the premarket to 4.58. This has the hallmarks of a bloodbath as sellers panic to unload the now not-so-red-hot
ONVO shares.


Do yourselves a favor and don't chase the next hot thing to any price. Just because you see other kids running with

Any company serious about their business pays no attention to the commentary especially after they already
did an overpriced equity raise. I imagine if the price dropped too much they'd be worried about class action
lawsuits which is why they're scared enough to stick their nose in this debate.


15 Aug 2013, 07:23 PM


dcmorris
Not used to having a company throw a right hook at you face, huh? 'Rarely seen' will become the norm with
this company and...they certainly have removed all doubt...no matter the debate. You seem to be cornered in
your post, over priced equity raise and class action have nothing to do with the false information in these
articles, other than more false information. The fact that Organovo is serious and thinks so highly of their
present and future image that they will shove it right back makes me proud to be an investor.


I wonder how Seeking Alpha feels about being called out?


16 Aug 2013, 09:24 AM


dcmorris
The author has been called out on this public forum by sane people and his only response was a jab. Nice.
Misinformation contained in the article reached the point of where the company that was reported on had to file a
press release to counter the authors misinformation, and warn the investing public on this 'short and distort' tactic.
This did effect the stock, and needs to be corrected. It is time to answer serious questions on his misrepresentation of
the facts and a correction on anything to do with the following in the articles:

This says a lot about ONVO...taking the high road. (Something the author of this article really oughta

thing that SA will delete.


To be sure, I want people to know I don't care if this article is yay or nay on investing in ONVO, I just simply

like the the next post will contain "I'm rubber, and you're glue. Everything you say bounces off me and sticks
to you." I apologize if I offended but --- C'mon let's be adults.


It seems to me Pearson stated 5 main facts. 
1) Almost all revenues at present are grants and research collaborations. 
2) The stock boasts a market cap of over $500 million fully diluted. 
3) The stock rose sharply after uplisting. 
4) There is an overhang of 32 million shares from sellers who were named in the April prospectus. 
5) On July 17 Organovo filed an S3 registration for the sale of $100 million in new shares. 
Just about everything else in the article is Pearson's speculation about what these facts mean to the stock
price. 
So far not one comment has disputed the facts as stated in the article. Just the opinions! 
I think I get it! What we have here is failure to communicate. 
I think what is being said here is Pearson believes the 32 million overhang is a problem. But you all "know"
the overhang is no problemo. Ergo Pearson is "distorting the fact". Likewise Pearson believes the $100 million
in new shares is bad for the stock price. But since you all "know" that this isn't true, then Pearson has
misrepresented the truth (as you know it). In your hearts you truly believe that if someone's belief about what
the facts mean is different from yours then they are truly and sincerely distortions and misrepresentations. I
understand. Its illogical. But I understand.


18 Aug 2013, 07:32 AM


Mukticat
Bravo. Well put. I believe what we're getting is a lot of commentary from people who aren't big on researching
what they own. If you were to regularly study the SEC filings none of what Pearson has presented would
come as any surprise to you. What he's done is draw the logical conclusions of someone who's got a good
pulse for the market. You can see it by how well his short picks have been doing.


Longs also seem to either forget or not know that over the short term stocks are voting machines. We all get
to vote on what we think it's worth and that determines the current price. Whether it goes too high or too low
doesn't matter over the longterm when stocks become weighing machines. If ONVO continues to generate no
revenue and burn through cash like no tomorrow then the market will price this accordingly.

This paragraph is for you, SA: 
"When the Company (ONVO) has elected to request corrections through a site publishing false information, the

IMO ONVO does itself a disservice by responding to any debate about their business. This isn't a value stock. Its a
story stock. They should let the investment community openly debate the merits of their business. Personally I think
this stock "might" end up as a 20 bagger or more -- in the future. But it also looks like the fundamentals suggest it
might be a good candidate for shorts at this moment. If you invest in a story stock you should always be prepared for
a roller coaster ride.


17 Aug 2013, 03:13 AM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Considering their stock issue was poisoned by Pearson's comments (by deflating the market cap and share
price), one could easily argue that Pearson attacked the company's business directly. They could have spo'd
fewer shares, and for a higher price, if Pearson's article hadn't been the preeminent "press" at that time.
Furthermore, the company has an obligation to its shareholders. When they are being financially raped by a
basher, and there's no other recent press, because they are still growing out of obscurity, it shows me a
degree of merit that ONVO would issue a warning to investors.

It is interesting to hear everyone dispute Pearson's facts without actually being able to actually say what, if
anything, he misrepresented. It's kind of like the Big Lie strategy; call something a 'lie' long enough and
people will begin to assume that it's a lie.


Now the company has gotten onboard with this strategy. It's easy to throw claims of 'Short and Distort!'
without being able to specify what they're referring to. It tells me that there's still a lot of early investors who
need to sell their shares and they don't want them dropping too soon.


That's why more and more I'm convinced that it's more than a pump and dump, it's probably a scam.
Companies whose ethics allow them to shade the truth on one thing will undoubtedly do it on other things too.

either stupidity or participants in a nefarious scheme.There is no way this squares with YOUR representations.

conscience for those who place trust in the free market and are unable to counter negative and incomplete

Dude! Are you actually reading these posts? Seriously. You're on the wrong website. There are plenty of sites
that'll tell you the one and only "TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE WHOLE TRUTH". This ain't one of them.
This is an investment site. Investments are kinda like legalized gambling. You look at the "facts": market cap,
revenue, shares outstanding, etc. You surmise what may or may not happen in the future. You place your bet.
Mr Market spins the wheel. You sort out the winners and the losers. On this site we "usually" voice opinions
about what may or may not happen in the future, so we can place more informed "bets" on a stock price. We
don't usually deal in the "TRUTH AND WHOLE TRUTH" -- just humble opinions.


And for the record, I never called called ONVO a scam or a pump and dump. I came to this site because I
was curious about ONVO as an investment, and I hoped I could find some informed opinions about the
stock's future. As far as shorting ONVO. All my money (meager as it is) is in IRAs. So even if I knew how to
short a stock (I don't), I'm not permitted to. 
I am sorely disappointed at the way this thread has deteriorated. Usually the sniping is just mean spirited. But
now we got people revering the stock like a religious icon. Wanting to call a fatwa on anyone who says
anything negative about it. So I think I'll call it a day. Just wanted to set the record straight.

This has been a very interesting thread to follow...all the hyperbola and name calling...little reality.


In business, just like your jobs...those of you that still work...there is one all encompassing mantra...Make money or
go home.


As stock holders, YOU are the owners of the business. You should demand performance from YOUR managers. In
reality, I have no problem with idea firms that utilize angel investors and research grants to move a project forward.
However, I do have a problem with "Companies" that reverse engineer markets to gain entrance into the engine of
business, the stock/ equities market.


If the project is worthwhile, it should be funded as a research project until the point that it actually produces a product.
There is a requirement for "qualified" investors in most venture markets. There is an inherent and exaggerated level of
risk involved in ventures such as this and companies should not be allowed to line their own pockets at the expense
of "investors" that are not qualified to understand the risks involved.


Investors...you might consider that the people you so malign as evil charlatans are actually doing you a favor and
identifying significant problems in the story. If you want to donate to the research of this company, just send them a
check...You are wasting your capital at this particular level of development with very little probability of success...It is
called reward risk assessment...something you might should learn.


From my experience, "the sky is falling" is a more likely scenario than "pie in the sky" claims on radical game
changing technologies.

You don't get it Triple F. I don't think anyone is calling anyone an "evil charlatan" because of an adverse
article. The problem or the "thing" that is evil is that the article was full of false information and had scant few
correct facts....and the writer of the article managed to profit when the stock went down....maybe not quite as
much as some thought, as it turns out.


I'm thinking the longs here are really aware that this is RISKY investment. I get it. Man, do I. I feel an
investment in this stock is an investment in science fiction.


I totally get the risk:reward ratio here - ya' know, the one you want to school everyone on. Thank you very
much.


These are pie in the sky claims, but some of the science fiction is coming to fruition - there have been some
amazing advances. I'm willing to bet on the pie - the whole point of the risk:reward. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. So
bet it.


BUT AT LEAST I'M NOT MANIPULATING FACTS AND MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS. And THAT is the
point.

So lets use your mantra, 'make money or go home'


If you had bought shares on the day of your first post here(we'll use Aug 1st at a low of 4.56) using the sp as of
now(6.30) and 14 trading days, that is an uptick of 1.74 or +27% in less than 3 weeks. I don't know what you expect
from your investments, so maybe you should school us more on how you've done better. Always open to better ideas,
but risk/reward has been calculated here and I'm fine with how this company has operated.


There are factual errors and distortions in Pearson's 2 articles with misdirection comments made that influenced
decisions. I have a problem with that.

I refer only to the company itself...as an investor/speculator, either I do it right of I get broke, as it should be.
However, I do not need to drag the unsuspecting into an "investment" that would have been far better suited
to be a "donation" to the company's research fund.


I was not so disappointed in that they are trying to created a new technology that could be a game changer in
health concerns going forward...That is an admirable pursuit...let's all change the world for the better! My
problem is portraying the company to be an ongoing concern instead of a research group...


Do you not see the irony in calling the author untruthful?


Good luck to you all and I do hope they can find the cures to all of our future health issues...

After studying the company and its "con"formation I chose to not get involved either way. The company listed
itself in a bogus way instead of doing an IPO they chose to purchase a defunct shell and use it for access to
the capital market...


Many companies that get into the markets this way end up being, shall we say " a bit shady". The percentage
is high enough that no matter how much I might like the story of the company, I will chose not to play... I don't
like the odds stacked against me that heavily. It is an interesting story and will be interesting to see if it flies or
crashes.


Good luck DC. Hope it works out for you...As for me I will chose a game where the odds are a little more
even, just part of the selection process.

Most investors have brokers who provide the risk/reward analysis when a new stock and associated companies come
to the market.IPO's are a perfecet example of SEC filings in which each firm is required BY LAW to identify all risks
are presented to the potential buyers.QUESTION???Where were you when the IPO came out.Did you ,as virtuous
analysts,provide ANY aspects of concern???The company did in their required risk analysis.Did you challenge them
at the time.I don't think so!!!!You were silent!!!!.Let's face it is a business of money making and a tug of war between
bulls/bears as to the output.Nothing wrong with that.However,this war should be based on THE WHOLE TRUTH AND
NOTHING BUT THE WHOLE TRUTH.Misrepresentatio... many other aspects of info/data omissions or skewing

Doing your own homework is a very important aspect of speculation.


The article listed below from June of 2012 is quite enlightening including the comment thread.


http://seekingalpha.co...


21 Aug 2013, 01:36 PM


dcmorris


Lets see if I can communicate what I get. It will require homework.


If you are serious about knowing this company, first read everything here.  
http://www.organovo.com 
From Organovo's perspective, there is no other way to factual understanding of how things have progressed. Here is
where I find everything from the reverse merger, management details, share dilution, product time lines, risk factors
and company intentions. My perspective comes from here.


To the elusive 'Big Lie(s)': 
False Fact # 1.."there is a substantial overhang of 32 million shares (around $200 million) from the sellers who were
named in the April prospectus.."


False Fact #2.."A substantial overhang pressing on the share price from the 32 million shares from 2012 is evidenced
by the fact that Organovo still filed a subsequent prospectus on these shares.."


False Fact #3.."So again, it is only sensible to conclude that the majority of holders were waiting for the uplist catalyst
in order to sell their shares.."


These ideas were planted throughout the article, and based on his interpretation of facts, led the discussion multiple
times. All 3 are factually incorrect and with proper research, should have been known as such.


This is the rebuttal article that SA edited in, Jason gives his version of the facts about the 32mil shares and an overall
questioning of Pearson's work. Good place to start. There was no response from Pearson.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1566702-organovo-red-hot-but-set-to-drop 47/53


http://seekingalpha.co...


This next article was written over 3 months ago and talks about the 32mil shares that Pearson uses throughout. 
http://seekingalpha.co...


In this article that was referenced multiple times by Pearson, the information was questioned by commentators about
the validity and usage pertaining to the 32mil shares, and was later proven to be incorrect by posts submitted
containing Organovo's IR detailed response to inquiries into the matter. Here's an excerpt:


"...our registration statement filed in April 2013 does not reflect the registration of new shares, but is a refresh of the
registration statement we initially filed in July 2012 as required by our contract with the private placement investors.
These shares have been available for resale since July 2012 and it seems irresponsible to create a fear that this
would have sudden impact in mid-2013. We have previously stated that these shares likely did have the impact seen
on the stock in July 2012, because only 6M shares previous to that were avaiable for public trading. The law of supply
and demand was at work then, but to suggest that suddenly after nearly a year these 32M shares would start trading
betrays ignorance of what the April 4 filing was, ignorance that may have resulted from not reading and understanding
our March 26 filing. Organovo's stock traded over 40M shares in January alone - a substantial portion that month and
every day from July until then would have to have been from the 32M pool, because the only other shares available at
that time were the original 6M."


After reviewing the info, Douglas seceded and offered a correction.  
IMO, this is where Pearson erred, as it seems he took the info in this article and used it in his own, while ignoring the
comments that effected the validity of this matter. Even more disturbing is if he gathered his info from any SEC filing.
The author led the 'unsuspecting' down a road, and we should not have had to discuss this again. 
The full response from Organovo was reposted in Pearson's second article as a factual counter to the repeated
misrepresentation, with no response.


This is what I get. Hope it was clear enough. I apologize to the community if my ego colored some of my opinion, but
it has been awhile since I've been this excited over a 'stocks' products and potential. This is a highly speculative
company that needs clarity and correct information for us all to make are own decisions and that is all I ask. 
All comments are welcomed. If you have an interest in this stock it's time to share it. I only speak for myself and that
was my opinion. peace

Bravo dc! For the first time someone from the "pros" broke away from the emotional claptrap. You made some
good points. Was this a totally balanced article, no of course not. But I don't expect one from someone who is
admittedly short. (That's why they state that up front.) 
But again you were only disputing the conclusions drawn from the facts -- which is quite reasonable. But
conclusions are reasoned opinions -- not facts!! For instance Pearson stated that ONVO was years away
from meaningful revenue, and someone said that was a lie because ONVO said they were on track to launch
a product in 2014. How can this be a lie, since it is something that may or may not happen in the future. For
instance, I own a gold miner who is going to break ground for a new mine in late 2013. But right now they got

$2 million in the bank and no prospects with the present gold price. But I'll call you a GD liar if you say they
ain't breaking ground this year, because "they said so?!!!"


The problem is you've fallen in love with the stock and emotion has superseded reason. Many feel that short
sellers are despicable. And someone who is short and is promoting his idea to others is beyond despicable,
especially if its a company you own and love. I understand. I don't agree. But I understand. IMO if I had a
stock that I believed in, and shorts were pushing it down, I'd use that as a buying opportunity. And if the
company puts out positive news and the shorts get squeezed, the stock will skyrocket. Why not make
lemonade!


Lastly people are cheering because Organovo has seemingly entered the fray. "How do you like that SA?"
Well, I imagine they're all high fivin' right now. Look how important they are! If you wanna find out what got
Organovo's knickers in a wad go to SA. With all the 100's of newsletters, blogs, CNBC etc. why would they
bother with one negative little article? Why are they sweatin' the small stuff? Are they that insecure? Do they
lack business acumen? You gotta wonder! IMHO!!!

@tadaboy


Thanks for taking the time to comment. 
I do have however, 2 things that I feel need clarification.


1) I truly could not understand why you and others failed to see that the 'claptrap' were actually well reasoned
questions that were posed and went unanswered. I personally felt mine and others comments laid out the
concerns appropriate to this forum style and thought they were clear in meaning. I even listed out other
commentators posts for review, with no answer. The author not responding to these questions has caused an
elevated pitch that was unnecessary. Anyway, conclusions based on false facts are not reasoned opinions,
and when those opinions are published it becomes misleading false information that skews the truth. IMO,
this was done intentionally to manipulate a position, manipulate the stock and to exploit the reader.


2) I have 35% of my investment portfolio in this stock so I take what is said seriously. While that is high for a
speculative position, my risk/reward has been calculated and I will defend my position. For you to make
comments on my reasoning being superseded by emotions is inappropriate and untrue. I have put in many
hours of DD spanning nearly a year to come to my reasoned opinion. The only emotion is for the life altering
possibilities from the work being done by intelligent people at universities and research labs. Also, I'm not
sure how you arrived at the discussion being elevated to 'iconic religious status'.


I do find it interesting that no one has directly countered my clarifying the false information that has been put
forth. The author stepping forward would be nice. The discussion on revenues or sweating the small stuff of
how we should self govern our public forums is worthy of further debate. Good luck to you.

Hi DC,


Another point of view per "your" comments on another article about onvo. You stated that due to volatility in
the stocks over time that you are now trading free several times over. Now, if I read that statement correctly,
you too are a trader looking for a profit. The only real allegiance you have to onvo is a profit motivated one.


Ditto for the principals of the company, the survival of the company (their options value and salary) is of
paramount importance to their "viewpoint" as to accuracy of the statements coming from them. No one in
business or in life wants to see their "baby" die and will do whatever they can to protect their
creation...especially if they are believers in what they are doing.


The truth of the matter is they must be believers in their idea or in all likelihood they would not have gone to
the effort to put the idea in play to begin with. No way do I think that this company was created with the
intention to defraud anyone.


With that being said, my comment of a few posts/replies ago about the necessity to do your own homework
prior to making "investment" decisions is born out. There are a bunch of sharks in the water on this one...It is
yet to be seen whether the short sharks or the long sharks are the owners of this piece of water.


As a "minnow" in looking at this particular company. I am at a significant disadvantage to the bigger fish in this
pond. I do believe I will hunt for a more favorable pond to play in.


Good luck to you in your playtime here.

make money while waiting on product launch or anything else the company has in store. I plan on it. They do
have 43.3mil to work with. I do not take a short position other than selling and waiting for a base.


I agree, I don't see all the positive steps this company has taken to get where they are as an elaborate
scheme to defraud investors. As another poster said, all the collaborations with reputable institutions would
have had to been snowed over or culpable to nefarious actions. Seems a stretch to think that as the events
have been very public and transparent... everything except the on going legal proceeding, which needs
discussing. Some postulate they will never amount to anything profitable, that's a debatable opinion also and
one that remains to be seen.

Please allow me to clarify one issue that seems to have some commenters' attention. The sentence in the article is:
"Any material revenues are still years away at best." This is a true statement. The material revenues pertain to the
tissue engineered products. This is where the big money is. The big money could be a decade away because of the
regulatory process. It's going to be very slow even if ONVO is the first mover in the space. Just getting the FDA
comfortable with the safety of the products will take years because of the potential life-threatening nature of a failure.
In the near term, ONVO expects to launch its liver assay in mid-to-late 2014. This product won't generate blockbuster
revenue, in my opinion. If it had that potential, representatives of Big Pharma would be falling all over themselves to
gain access to it via collaboration agreements. Since this has not happened, it is reasonable to assume that the
potential revenues will be modest. I will be surprised is the product generates more than $3 - $4M in 2015. This is just
a gut feeling, nothing more. Aside from this product launch, ONVO will be relying on additional collaboration

agreements (proof of concept, mostly) and government grants for revenue. This ain't goin' to be a whole lot, at least
not enough to justify a premium valuation.


It would have been greatly preferable if Mr. Pearson addressed this misperception. I know he doesn't like to respond

Thanks for your input here Douglas, I was a little hesitant to use your material, but felt it was pertinent to the

I will have to disagree with you on the fairly definitive statement you just made. Seems the concept of truth is still in
question here. Lots of possible futures and revenues need further debate. Here's an example: http://bit.ly/14zkiUu 
Also surprising is your comment on Big Pharma not falling all over this technology. With your grasp on what is in store
as far as regulations that might be coming, you'd think taking time by them to do a proper workup would be SOP and
not just an indication of invalidity. I do appreciate someone finally bringing what could be truly disruptive to this
company(FDA regulations) to the discussion. The Govt. will certainly give its opinion here.

Good to see ya back in the yard kitty


You once accused the fine readers here that they were clueless and didn't know how to read a SEC filing...looks like
you were speaking of yourself.  
To the poohing then...


From the latest 10K: Page 43 
"On August 6, 2012, Mr. Michaels was granted 750,000 time-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). The time-based
RSUs will vest over four (4) years in equal annual installments with twenty-five percent (25%) vesting after each of the
12th, 24th, 36th, and 48th monthly anniversaries of the vesting start date."


Then from the 4 in question: 
Explanation of Responses: 
1. The shares were withheld at the election of the Reporting Person to satisfy tax withholding obligations in
connection with the partial vesting of restricted stock units granted in August 2012. 
2. The option was automatically issued pursuant to the terms of the Reporting Person's Equity Incentive Award
Agreement issued in August 2012.


Then back to the 10: 
"In connection with the issuance of the RSUs, the executive officers were issued an executive incentive award
agreement. The executive incentive award agreement provides that the executive officer will be allowed to pay
applicable federal and state withholding taxes by returning an equivalent number of shares to the Company for
cancellation on the applicable vesting date. If the executive officer returns shares to the Company for cancellation on
an annual vesting date to cover his federal and state withholding taxes, the executive officer will automatically be
issued on such vesting date a stock option. The number of shares of common stock subject to a stock option will be
equal to the number of shares the executive returns to the Company as payment for applicable federal and state
withholding taxes and will be fully vested. The exercise price of the stock option will be equal to the closing sale price
of the Company’s common stock on the applicable vesting date."


So lets see then, the CFO has an employment incentive of 750K shares and under the terms could have sold 187.5K,
instead turns in 102.1K shares back to the company to cover the applicable taxes due, and is given an option to buy
the same amount of shares turned in.


Those were retired shares, not insider selling. In reality, the outstanding share count was reduced and now a possible
inside buyer of 102.1K shares at near market price is possible. So...the only thing factual in your comment was the
CFO and 5.50. This is my understanding and my reasoned opinion. Feel free to counter my assessment with reason,
not fear based accusations. Hope this was clear enough.

I have no idea what the motivation of the author was, but I think you give this site WAY too much influence. This is no
micro cap stock that can easily be swayed by a couple dozen traders. And sabalos' comment that gullible people
were swayed by Pearson is specious. IMO almost all short traders are at least semi experienced, and IRA money

can't be used so that limits the audience. This article almost surely did not affect the stock price.  
And I agree that the author's decision to not respond to any of the comments reflects poorly on him. 
As I've said several times I have no dog in this fight. But I can't sit idly while some try to censure the author and call
him a liar because he sees the glass half empty while others are sure the glass is half full. And I say that not to defend
the author, but only in an effort to encourage open and honest debate, which is what I come to this site for. Even
though I"m a relative newbie, I've learned one thing -- investing isn't black and white, its shades of grey , and we need
all the info we can get to make informed "bets". 
And saying the article was the same as "CRYING FIRE IN A CROWDED MOVIE" (not yours) is claptrap.
