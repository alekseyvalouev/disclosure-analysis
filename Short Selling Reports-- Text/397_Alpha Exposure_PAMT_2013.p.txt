Parametric Sound: A Turkey's Desperate Attempt To Avoid The
Chopping Block
Nov. 13, 2013 9:44 AM ET23 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Shareholders of Parametric Sound Corporation (PAMT) have been eagerly awaiting the
recently filed definitive proxy statement for its pending merger with Turtle Beach, which
was announced on August 5th. Prior to the filing of the proxy, there was little information
available on Turtle Beach - just a few high level numbers given out on conference calls.
There was a reason for that: the truth behind Turtle Beach is that it's a deteriorating (and
quite possibly distressed) company conducting a merger with Parametric Sound out of
desperation. In this article, we will show that Parametric Sound is an excellent short sale
candidate due to the deteriorating business of Turtle Beach and the extreme overvaluation
of the combined company.


Turtle Beach's Business is Deteriorating


The most alarming disclosure from the proxy statement is the rapid deterioration of the
Turtle Beach business. According to page 74 of the proxy (here), Turtle Beach was
projecting 2013 EBITDA of $40.6 million when the merger was being negotiated between
the parties. This was a 15% decline from the $47.8 million of EBITDA it earned in 2012,
per page 139 of the proxy. Later, on August 5th after the merger was announced, the
companies held a joint conference call in which the CEO of Turtle Beach lowered
estimates to a "range of $32 million to $40 million," or a midpoint of $36 million. This new
level of EBITDA represents an almost 25% year over year drop in profitability. Of course,
the news only gets worse. In a conference call held November 4th , the CEO of Turtle
Beach revealed that "the adapter and related software required to make our headsets fully
functional with the new Xbox One console, will not be ready at launch" and that "as a
result, the 2013 outlook for revenue and EBITDA provided on August 8th will be revised."
While we don't know where 2013 EBITDA will end up, it's safe to say that he would not
have made this statement if revised estimates were not lower than the bottom of the
already lowered range indicated on August 5th. Here's a graphical representation of Turtle
Beach's EBITDA:

Turtle Beach Actually Looks Distressed


While it should be clear from the above that Turtle Beach is suffering poor performance,
what's not clear is that the company may actually be financially distressed. There are
numerous signs of distress in the proxy statement beyond just the collapsing profits, which
fell from +$4.1 million in the first half of 2012 to -$5.6 million in the first half of 2013, as can
be seen on page 135. This profitability collapse resulted in the tripping of debt covenants.
For instance, on page 141, we learned that "Turtle Beach was not in compliance with its
fixed charge coverage ratio as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012." Likewise, on
page 53, we learned that as a condition to approving the merger with Parametric
Technologies, Turtle Beach's lenders required that "Parametric raise at least $5,000,000 in
debt or equity capital" and that "Turtle Beach raise $10,000,000 in debt or equity capital,
which would be used to prepay an equivalent portion of its credit facility." Clearly, Turtle
Beach is in distress when it is tripping its debt covenants and those same lenders require
money to be raised in order to approve a merger. Moreover, on page 142, we learned that
when it came time to raise the new capital, Turtle Beach was unable to find a third-party
lender and it had to issue Subordinated Notes to "certain affiliated investors, including the
Stripes Group and the Chief Executive Officer," and that the interest on the notes was a
usurious "10% per annum for the first year and … 20% per annum for all periods
thereafter" (page D-42).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1835942-parametric-sound-a-turkeys-desperate-attempt-to-avoid-the-chopping-block 3/10


The conditions and lending rates that Turtle Beach had to abide by are not indicative of a
healthy company, and instead point to significant financial distress.


Acquisitions Hid Declining Performance In 2012


Turtle Beach wants investors to believe that the gaming console cycle, which includes new
consoles from both Sony and Microsoft this year, is to blame for the company's struggles.
For instance, on the August conference call, the CEO stated "consumers obviously in
anticipation of the new consoles, they buy less consoles, less games, less accessories
right until the new consoles hit." Likewise, on the last conference call, the CEO stated that
in 2013 there will be an "expected pre-console transition, downturn for the industry." At
first blush, the financials in the proxy statement appear to support this contention, with
profitability continuing to grow through the end of 2012, reaching a record $26.5 million of
net income in 2012. However, this is again misleading because it does not account for
Turtle Beach's acquisition of its European distributor, Lygo. The properly adjusted pro
forma earnings, on page D-25 of the proxy, which adjust Turtle Beach's earnings as
though the acquisition had taken place at the start of 2011, show that net income actually
started to decline in 2012 and that it fell from $23 million in 2011 to $18.3 million in 2012.
This suggests that the company's excuse regarding the console cycle lacks merit.


Parametric Management Is Cashing Out


So why would Parametric pursue an acquisition with a floundering company like Turtle
Beach? Personal enrichment, of course. As a result of the merger, special golden
parachute payments will be triggered for the executive management of Parametric. For
instance, we can see on page 77 that Kenneth Potashner, the Chairman, will be entitled to
over $2.8 million of payments that are triggered on a change of control. The proxy also
reveals that he will continue on with a board seat following the merger, which is likely to be
a cushy and lucrative endeavor for him.


Two Desperate Parties?


Lest we only criticize the business outlook for Turtle Beach, we think it is also important to
recognize that Parametric Sound was also in a very weak negotiating position. For
instance, on page 48 of the proxy, the company revealed that "representatives of Houlihan
Lokey contacted and held varying levels of discussion with a total of 13 parties other than
Turtle Beach regarding a transaction involving Parametric. During this time period, all such
parties advised representatives of Houlihan Lokey that they were not interested in
pursuing an acquisition of Parametric." Following the agreement with Turtle Beach,
Parametric conducted an additional sales process, the "go shop" period, during which

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1835942-parametric-sound-a-turkeys-desperate-attempt-to-avoid-the-chopping-block 4/10


"Houlihan Lokey contacted 49 prospective buyers…[and] None of these prospective
buyers, or any other parties, expressed interest in making an acquisition proposal for
Parametric." (p. 58) In fact, it appears that the only other proposals Parametric received
during this period were for two licensing agreements. In short, Parametric conducted an
exhaustive sales process and the only real interested party was Turtle Beach, which is
paying nothing in cash and which appears to be in financial distress.


The Valuation Looks Extreme


While all of the above considerations suggest that both Turtle Beach and Parametic are
struggling, Parametrics stock is truly a great short due to its extreme overvaluation, which
suggests significant downside. Based on the pro-forma number of shares outstanding, we
believe that the combined market cap of the company is $669 million and that the
enterprise value of the company is $730 million. This represents a multiple of
approximately 27x 2013E EBITDA, as can be seen below:


In contrast, the peer group to Parametric trades at only 8.4x EBITDA and to the best of
our knowledge, none of these companies is experiencing financial distress:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1835942-parametric-sound-a-turkeys-desperate-attempt-to-avoid-the-chopping-block 5/10


Comments (23)


Based on the average peer multiple, which may be generous due to the poor business
conditions and apparent financial distress at Turtle Beach as well as the tepid interest in
Parametric, we believe that the fair value for Parametric's stock is approximately $3.93 per
share or 75% below the current stock price:


Conclusion


Until the recent filing of the proxy statement, there has been a paucity of information
available about Turtle Beach and, by extension, about Parametric. Now that the proxy has
been filed, we can easily see that it's not a pretty picture. The profitability of Turtle Beach
is eroding, the business appears to be in financial distress, and there was only one suitor
with true interest for Parametric. To top off this bad fundamental news, the valuation of the
combined company looks extreme. We are short and recommend shorting Parametric
Sound with a target price of $3.93 per share or 75% below the most recent share price.

I cannot say I'm surprised by the timing and content of this post. Firstly, I'd like to compliment you on reading the
entire proxy; however, you got one very important fact wrong. Microsoft' s inability to get the new Xbox launched on
time is the cause of the expected revenue shortfall of Turtle Beach. Turtle Beach has its product ready. 
More interesting however is that there is an enormous 2 million share short interest in this so called turkey. Many
institutions who did not have an interest in PAMT because there were no meaningful revenues and earnings are now
starting to nibble at the combined entity. Once their nibbling turns to gobbling as sales jump after the Q1 release of
Xbox, you, my friend, will have your neck on the chopping block as a massive short squeeze doubles or triples the
current share price of PAMT. 
Happy Thanksgiving !

Going LONG.. on the Merger, The Parametric Merger and Instatutional investers like JP Morgan (JPM) and
Craig-Hallum will likely lead the charge, as they were both involved with the merger negotiations. The former
served as financial advisor to Turtle Beach. The latter was hired to provide the fairness opinion. In those
roles, they've both already completed extensive due diligence. Rest assured, there will be many other
analysts that follow suit. LOOK OUT SHORT SELLERS!! it is comming

Clearly a doubling or tripling of PAMT did not occur. The share price today is no higher than it was in early
Nov. But if you look at the marketcap it has risen by nearly 600% ! How? Because pre-merger there were
about 6.5M shares of PAMT and now there's approx 37M (per company pr announcing merger completion).


Is your stock really six times more valuable with the addition of Turtle Beach? Earnings next week will answer
that conclusively NOT.

Author’s reply »  I don't buy the microsoft excuse - see all the estimate cuts that came before the most recent one?


Also, even if they got to $50 million in EBITDA next year - a new record - the stock would still be overvalued at 15x
EBITDA vs peers at 8.4x


Lastly, the company appears to be distressed - see the problems with their lenders.

I don't know if you listened to the most recent conference call, but Turtle Beach, a company with an excellent
reputation( just talk to their customers as I did) and reviews of their products, states very logically that any

time there are new planned releases of gaming consoles, accessories tied to existing consoles suffer
prelaunch, and shoot up post launch. It has happened before.


Another very important part of PAMT is the healthcare aspect of its technology. If someone deaf as a haddock
can now hear the TV without the rest of the house or neighborhood being blown out from the sound, the
technology could become a standard for all future TV's and sound systems. What market cap would you give
that ?


13 Nov 2013, 11:33 AM


Mukticat
This technology has been around for years. PAMT tried hawking it and couldn't raise any interest which is
why they opted to sell themselves instead. Turtle Beach, which I believe has no use for PAMT other than as a
reverse merger vehicle into a Nasdaq listing, will probably shelve the technology too since it doesn't fit their
primary business of headsets . . . which isn't going that well anyway.


Anyway the fact that Houlikan was turned down by 63 other companies should give you an idea of how
valuable PAMT's hypersound product is.

No position in PAMT.

I never understood why a gaming headphone company and Parametric did a merger. No synergy ...totally different
markets. I would have expected a company like Bose or Sony to have acquired Parametric, but not a headphone
company :-( 
Parametrics stock price went down after the merger ... that says enough. Reading in above article that many
companies didn't want Parametric ... that says enough.

Excellent article, however, may I clarify why the word merger isn't applicable to this Turtle marriage with a duck! They
shopped this house of cards to 49 potential companies, however, there were no takers. Considering that the
requirement for this deal to go through PAMT had to pay Turtle $5,000,000. This isn't a merger, it's a Code 211 in
police jargon. A robbery in progress! All just MO!

Alpha Exposure: Is your track record better than the top performing small cap growth mutual fund manager over the
last 5 years - the $825 million Hodges Small Cap Fund (HDPSX)?


Because they just purchased all 364,286 shares in Parametric's $5.1 million equity raise (http://1.usa.gov/187aKUK)


With an average annual return of nearly 20% per year for the last 5 years, I'm sure they don't have a clue what they're
doing, though.

I'll own being wrong here. Original entry on first position was $5.60 and took profits at $12.28 and $10. Adj

ultimate potential.

Well done Lou even if I suspect we're all Warren Buffetts when it comes to documenting our trades after the
fact.


It seemed pretty obvious that a company losing money hand-over-fist (PAMT) was not going to become five
times more valuable by getting acquired by Turtle Beach. And so it was.

Author’s reply »  I do think my track record is better. YTD, Hodges has outperformed its index (the Russell 2000 or
"RTY") by 7%. My picks this year (from the day before the first article since I usually write some follow-ups):


1) Short UNXL on May 19. UNXL: -50%; RTY +11% 
2) Short CLSN on June 11: CLSN -52%; RTY +12% 
3) Short EXAS on July 24: EXAS: -20%; RTY +5% 
4) Short AFFY on August 28: AFFY: -55%; RTY +9% 
5) Short CVV on August 29: CVV: -11%; RTY: +9%

8) Short LEE on Nov 12: LEE +14%; RTY +0% 
9) Short PAMT on Nov 13: PAMT -18%; RTY: +0%


Average: Alpha Exposure: -24%; RTY: +6% = outperformance of +30% vs small cap index. Any more questions?
