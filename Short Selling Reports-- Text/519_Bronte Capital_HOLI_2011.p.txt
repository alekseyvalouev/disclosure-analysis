Hollysys - a blog post inspired by the railway crash
 
 
Disclosure for people who do not get my sense of humor: We are short Hollysys.  
If you get to the end of the post and do not understand why read the note on the blog as to
humor - or just read this. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
Hollysys is a Chinese rail technology company listed in the USA (NASDAQ:HOLI).
 
The stock is having a rough trading day today. As I write the stock is down about 20 percent. My first
reaction was the Chinese rail crash but Hollysys has denied its signalling is involved.
 
That is a relief because Hollysys is an amazing company. And because it did not cause the railway
accident it should be able to sweep the board of its inferior competition.
 
How to approach Hollysys
 
I approach Hollysys like I approach many amazing Chinese companies - businesses with amazing
technology, amazing growth and amazing margins.
 
Some of the amazing claims made have turned out to be false - but some are yet to be falsified and
some of those might actually be true. After all 1.3 billion people should be able to some amazing
things.
 
Hollysys however is possibly the most amazing company I have seen yet.
 
As this blog is a fan of Fox News I wish to be fair-and-balanced. I report. You can decide.
 
What Hollysys does?
 
Hollysys makes control systems. It started in the railways industry and specializes in very fast trains.
Here is a description from their website:
 


HollySys Automation Technologies is a leading provider of automation and control
technologies and applications in China that enables its diversified industry and utility
customers to improve operating safety, reliability, and efficiency. Founded in 1993,
HollySys has approximately 2,400 employees with 9 sales centers and 13 service

including Distributed Control System (DCS) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC),
high-speed railway Train Control Center (TCC) and Automatic Train Protection (ATP),

China's subway automation market, and is the only certified domestic automation
control systems provider to the nuclear industry in China. HollySys is also one of only

Railways in the 200km to 250km high-speed rail segment, and is one of only two
automation control systems and products providers approved in the 300km to 350km
high-speed rail segment.

HollySys offers a wide range of automation and control products from PLCs to DCS to
help you find the solution for any automation and process control application. Through
our sustainable business and continuous development in the area of automation, we

technology for better work, life, and environment. We are now the global supplier of
choice for innovative technology backed by the highest level of service and support.
When you need products and solutions you can rely on, choose HollySys.


 
 
Their website then goes through various businesses that they run and describes their achievements.
The achievements are on par with global players in the control-automation business such as
Siemens. For instance on nuclear power this is what they say:
 


Since 1995, HollySys starts providing solutions for the nuclear power plant automation
in China and since then, we have been continuously providing digital I&C system for the
nuclear power plant. Through hardship of innovation and development, HollySys has
now self-developed products and solution for the nuclear power plant control system.
With more than 10 years of experience and over 40 successful NPP projects, HollySys
has both the ability to become very competitive product suppliers and service providers.


In 1997, HollySys developed China’s first computer control system for the nuclear
power plant. The system was exported to Pakistan Chashma 300MW NPP and
has been successfully operating ever since.


In 1998, Qingshan Phase II NPP adopted HollySys DCS system. It is equip with
centralized supervision and safety control of the nuclear power plant with system
of conventional island design.


In 2004, HollySys was the first to enter the field of nuclear safety testing and
successfully implemented the project of digital safety testing devices.


In 2005, HollySys became the localized sub-contractor of Ling’Ao Nuclear Power
Plant phase II, and undertaking the project implementation for digital I&C system.


In 2007, HollySys has successfully developed its first generation totally digital I&C
system, the HOLLiAS NMS system.


By far, HollySys has 44 signed and completed contracts within our nuclear power
business unit covering almost all of the China’s Nuclear Power Plant either in
construction or in operation. These have put us in the top league in competition among
other competitors in China. This vast achievement wins recognition from our customers,
at the same time, have proven the reliability and safety of our solution, and the
professionalism in our engineering services that we provided.


 
 
They make similarly large claims about their business in other sectors such as control systems for
subway automation or factory automation.
 
One long investor I know visited the plants and was shown a very impressive company. There
headquarters photographed on the website - is very impressive.

But as regular readers of this blog know I am a balance sheet kind of guy. When I see such amazing

businesses.

We learn that the 65.3 million in net PP&E is $76.6 million gross PP&E - the difference being
accumulated depreciation. Of that 76.6 million most is buildings and land use rights. There 13.6
million in buildings, 7.3 in land use rights and another 39.3 million under construction.
 
Only $3.1 million of machinery is in use. That is kind of funny because this company is a manufacturer
of some pretty high end kit. Indeed it is pretty hard to imagine how you manufacture the control
systems (sensors etc and the computers to go with it) with only $3.1 million in kit - but the company
seems to do so. Those machines should also include all the computers on which staff make the
software to run all this fancy kit. The company has $3000 of kit - so there is less than a laptop per
staff member in machines - and surely all of this manufacturing requires some machines.
 
Whatever: this is a miracle of machine efficiency - as amazing as any other Chinese company I have
written on.
 
The rest of the balance sheet is perverse. The company had revenue in 2009 and 2010 of $157.5
million and $174.1 million respectively. Costs estimated in excess of billings are over $60 million. In
other words they have done a third of year's work and not been paid. Net income last year was $27
million. Over the past three years net income is about $20 million. The company has many years
income in work which it has done but has not yet got around to billion.
 
That is perverse. You work and work and work and it is not cash - it is just unbilled receivables. They
better be sure they can bill somebody and that they will collect it in cash.
 
If you look at the last quarterly the costs estimated in excess of billings have ballooned to $86 million.
They continue working. They do not collect in cash.
 
Another 10 million - or half the profits for the last three years - is advanced to suppliers. That number
is rising too.
 
There is 23 million of inventories too. I guess that makes sense - they are a manufacturer - but there
are next to no machines to work on these inventories with...
 
Admittedly their liabilities are also larger than would appear normal - there is for instance 33 million in
deferred revenue. That is also large relative to profit. I guess working capital management is just
different in China...
 
Revenue in the last nine months is skyrocketing. Its up over 60 percent. Property plant and equipment
however is almost unchanged. This company is one of the most advanced manufacturers in the world
- and as far as I can see it does this almost without machines.
 
Reasons to be long this company
 
About six months ago I was talking to a (former) long in this company and he told me that I should be
wary shorting it. It was very close to the Railway department and the Railway Minister. (My friend just
assumed I would be short - but truly I am looking for companies to go long...)
 
Hollysys he said had lots of Guanxi - and that Guanxi might help them make money. He thought it
even possible that they had obtained machinery and know how from the Railway Department without
having to pay for it.
 
He really did think that there was a relationship with the Railways Minister that would play well for the
company. And not being that familiar with the innards of the Chinese Politburo I was not one to
quibble.
 
The stock however got weaker when the Railway Minister was arrested for corruption.
 
R&D
 
This company has done about 25 million cumulative R&D in the past three years. This is a lot by
Chinese standards but it is tiny by the standards of Siemens. Given the enormous advances that this
company has (claimed to have) made in fast train and nuclear power control systems I am getting
worried about nuclear reactors controlled on the cheap. Still I report: you decide.

Audit
 
This company is a June balance date. The auditor is BDO Hong Kong. This is an auditor stung a little
by scandal lately but then so has every auditor in China.
 
This one is amazing. Utterly amazing. It might trip up on audit (which is not far away). But this might
actually be the real deal - the company with world-class technology on a modest cumulative R&D
budget. The company with world class manufacturing where the manufacturing requires next to no
machines. The company that does work greater than its accumulated profit and neither expenses nor
bills that work. The company that breaks all the rules and still succeeds.
 
The company that proves that this time it is different in China.
 
And imagine - because they did not cause the railway accident they are going to be getting a lot more
work.

John, 
 
Having followed your dissection of a number of Chinese companies, I have increasingly
wondered at the complicity or naiviety of the auditors (having been somewhat
sympathetic to your post on how auditors can be innocent). 
 
Assuming that not everyone can be complicit in a fraud and that a routine analysis of both
the client industry and plant would raise some red flags, what is your view on the quality
of auditors in China? It seems that increasingly, auditors are failing to do some basic
checks and analyses on their clients. Deliberate? Lazy? Incompetant? Complicit? 
 
John.

The quality range of auditors is enormous. 
 
Frazer Frost got sanctioned by the SEC. My view is that was deserved - but FF was by no
means the worst auditor. 
 
By contrast I think the big four are mostly honest but duped. 
 
The auditors cover the whole gamut.

my guess is that this is a fraud. please note that net income YTD is 34.5M while cash flow
from operations was NEGATIVE 9.2M. But this isn't the problem, it is the nature of the
CFO decoupling.  
 
** Notice in Q3;11 (just reported) revenues increased by 21M. During that same YoY
comparison, unbilled receivables increased by virtually the same amount. So I would
make a small correction to your post - it isn't that they aren't collecting... they AREN'T
EVEN BILLING customers anymore for the revenue purportedly being recognized on
percentage of completion. 
 
Further, why would a company with $95 million of cash at the end of the most recent
quarter, require a $4M desperate line of credit to draw down quarter-over-quarter?

According to the Guardian and Hong Kong media, there is a major cover-up underway
regarding the causes of the high-speed rail crash. See "Chinese anger over alleged
cover-up of high-speed rail crash" 
 
There is no way a crash like that could occur without a major signalling system failure. A
lightning strike should not take out a railroad signalling system. Railroad signal systems
have been resistant to lightning strikes since the late 19th century.

From 11-16-10 HLS International 20K: "We assemble our products from subcomponents
provided by others or we outsource the production to qualified vendors. We acquire
advanced printed circuit board components from high quality suppliers. We rely on our 
manufacturing management department to coordinate the procurement of raw materials
and outsourced processing, including 
the procurement of components and standard parts (such as cables and connectors), and
outsourced processing of Polyvinyl 
Chloride (PVC) coating, shells, and printed circuit boards. Our products are subjected to
rigorous testing in our facilities prior to shipment." So I guess they would say that they
don't need manufacturing equipment because they outsource it all. 
 
They seem to have "acquired" industry-leading technology very quickly thought. They are

high enough prices to be worth shorting. Only two stocks made it through my screen:
AUTC and HOLI. 
 
I was about 99% sure that AUTC is fraudulent, and about 70% sure that HOLI is
fraudulent. But I can only borrow AUTC at a call rate of 100%, and HOLI at 50%. Even if
I'm right about AUTC, I lose money if the stock takes longer than one year to delist, or if
another short squeeze happens. 
 
Is this one of those things that you get more comfortable with after doing it several times?
Or do you often find yourself sitting out juicy short targets because they were simply too
expensive to short?

A big chunk of your argument is on receivables. 
 
The receivables for projects that are multi-year, large projects like nuclear and high speed
rails tends to go through ballooning phases as payments are made at fixed milestones in
a year.  
 
Especially with the fact that they regularly get work from Chinese government who only
pays a few times a year. It is not unusual for income to be non-cash as they'll be paid
later. 
 
As for R&D, it doesn't cost that much to employ 3000 engineers in China. It's no surprise
their R&D costs isn't as high as established company like Siemans. 
 
Moreover, a lot of their technology are directly transferred and obtained from government
and partnerships with Japan, so they do not bear the R&D cost from scratch. 
 
To your point about construction costs. They're constructing a new facility. Who buys
equipment and computers for a facility that's "STILL BEING BUILT"?! Only when the
buildings are done do you start investing in those two categories. For manufacturers, esp
those that have to build the buildings from scratch, it is not unusual to see machinery,
software and equipment costs come in later. 
 
I think your analysis is biased.

Its amazing that a cursory look at the financial statements of these firms raises really big,
bright flashing red flags, yet "smart" people are long these firms, like your friend who
seemed to use a sort of plug (guaxni) to explain away the very strange PP&E/R&D
numbers. 
 
I priced some servers on Alibaba when I was looking at YOKU, and while hardly being an
expert in the field (to assess quality, reliability,
installation/integration/maintenance/operating costs), it does seem that just the hardware
can be bought for fairly cheap. 
 
But it seems then even if these firms can get equipment for so cheap (or even free/free-
ish), they're still carrying them on their balance sheets at WAY too low values relative to
what they claim to be using them for/achieving. 
 
Like you say, either these young Chinese firms have achieved productivity and efficiency
never before even imagined, or they are lying (about what, exactly, is harder to ascertain). 
 
I find the latter far easier to believe than the former.

I think your thesis is a bit weak on this one. But there is certainly a lot of hair. This could
also be a company that is moving from a local trader to a manufacturer. But even then the
B/S looks suspect. While the thesis that this may be a fraud may be right, the chances of
your trade being successful could be different due to external factors (costs of shorting)
and internal factors (the company may have "good" inventory and good cash).  
 
On a different note: As a buy side analyst, I have struggled to get heard and have had my
worries pushed aside by others probably under pressure to do deals. Your blog has in
some ways been a "motivation" as I struggled. Some one called my line of thinking as

Huh...I'd love to short this company, but their annual report says that all of their
manufacturing is outsourced. They contract with outside manufacturers to produce
equipment for them, and basically do the assembly themselves:

I find your analysis amateurish and laughable. But I acknowledge you will convince the
average layman who still thinks Bali and China is the same 'country'! 
 
Holi is more a tech company than you think. The value is in the people ie engineers.
These don't get counted in the bal sheet. And yes, once the design is done, almost all
manufacturing is outsourced. Final assembly is done back in their hq by ...people..not
machines. Testing is simply about hooking up to pc's and switches. 
 
YOu were puzzled by high inventory from no machines?? Please go back to school and
read up on some accounting basics if you are going to continue blogging about
companies. Next you will accuse all retail and tech companies as fraudulent based on
that! 
 
If you knew how business works in China (or Bali?) then you will also know that
receivables stretch out for close to a year when dealing with the state owned companies,
which make up the most of Holi's clients.

Anon July 30 12:39, last time I saw someone that angry was when this blog was

Maybe there is value in the engineers but normally that gets crystallized as patents in the
form of cumulative R&D and the like. Maybe you could just throw together a company that
has massive value and no patents - I could think of a few recent VC deals (Colors?) but
any company that has been around for a decent period of time would accumulate some
R&D. Those engineers don't get paid to play PS3 all day.  
 
Now, here's another possibility which belies that I do know something about doing
business in China. HOLI is controlled by proxies of someone *very* politically powerful.
HOLI has zero value add (couldn't those engineers be hired by CRC, China Highspeed,
etc? Why work for HOLI?) but can extract rents from these companies because they are
told to purchase services of no value from HOLI (consulting contracts, minor design

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Hollysys - a blog post inspired by the railway crash


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/07/hollysys-blog-post-inspired-by-railway.html 11/12


tweaks for serious markups,etc) in order to line the pockets of someone very important.  
 
Now that would be entirely plausible - but given the former head of China's rail buildout
appears to be on the sort of career track that gets your family billed for a bullet, I wonder
how durable that relationship could be now? 
 
Ultimately, its either a defrauding of investors and the Chinese state and people, or a
defrauding of investors.

Like I said - I find it laughable but I confess I am annoyed as to how amateurish the
analysis is. When told about this blog, I was keen to read and learn something new and
smart. 
 
The author clearly knows he has some sort of influence over readers and hence the
responsibility to actually understand basic finance concepts.  
 
The author may also join the long queue of being proven right and the stock/company
capitulates like some other RTOs (maybe). But at the very least, please come up with
something smart and challenging with real original research rather than analysis that can
be so easily faulted (a "balance sheet kind of guy"? really?) and circumstantial
arguments. 
 
Re nemo incognito's reply ...On R&D wages... wages in R&D may not be capitalised..ie
research generally gets expensed...development gets capitalised is the rule of thumb.
Now, I don't know about you, but I would think you prefer to see a company not tweaking
around accounting concepts by capitalising expenses and instead recognise them as
expenses when incurred (not to suggest that I know whether the company had a choice in
this matter). 
 
Relationships. Difficult to have a view on the background or be convinced of the possible
implications. That goes for all companies hence is not a differentiator for performance I'm
afraid. Which Chinese company doesn't have one or more political backers, direct or
indirect, or proclaim to have one? Welcome to Emerging Markets 101.

John, I am curious about your view here. It's more than a year since you made some
pretty explicit comments questioning the accounting and validity of Hollysys operations. It
seems your view then (explicit and applied with some subtlety) was it was too amazing to
be true, just on what you read and some people you spoke to. But there was no
proprietary research to confirm any of your allegations. You were up front and mentioned
you had a short on the stock. What is your view now?

John, despite some 2 years on, somehow I still recall your analysis and opinion
(particularly your readers’ opinions) of a small little stock in those days called Hollysys. To
recap Hollysys was one of those Chinese RTOs trading on the Daq, nearly all of which
were treated like the plaque in the wake of a number of bad apples (fraud) that started to
smell. To make matters worse, Hollysys, a rail equipment technology provider also got
caught up indirectly in the aftermath of a major scandal at top of the responsible transport
ministry, and followed then by a rail disaster that painted an even more negative picture of
Chinese made products and regard for safety systems. 
 
Whilst I as an investor/analyst have not profited or loss any capital based on your blog
about the company in July 2011, I am deeply curious as to how the ball got rolling for you
in this. Let me be straight; I was one of those that found your arguments on the light side
relative to such a bold and vocal call. Let me ask two questions:  
 
Firstly, what analysis did you really conduct on the company and industry upon hearing
the ‘idea’ that Hollysys may not be what it claimed to be? I can understand how you got to
your line of questioning (and scepticism) based on your elaborated scan of the company’s
website and balance sheet plus notes to the accounts. But it does seem like that’s where

you drew the line before sharing your views to a broader audience, for which you know
you have a certain level of influence. Was there more than what you were willing to share
that prompted you to suggest this was a company that was simply too amazing to be
true?  
 
Secondly, if there was more than you were willing to share, what has been the disconnect
between what you knew but didn’t write versus the real world, in the time since? I haven’t
picked up recent research on the company as yet, but the share price ($21 today versus
$7.8 when you first wrote in July 2011, massively outperforming a rising market by 3x in
that time frame) seems to suggest that you did not catch much wind in those sails over
quite an extended period.
