Uranium Resources: No Production, No Good Options Left

Summary


Optimism over Japan's plans to restart a nuclear power plant popped uranium
prices, which had been depressed since Japan shut down all nuke plants.


URRE can restart mining only if uranium reaches and sustains prices above the cost
of restarting and production, at least in the mid-$40 range.


URRE runs through about $1 million per month, though it produces nothing. So the
company has only enough cash to survive about 6 months.


Will URRE flood the market with millions of shares? It could. In order to restart
production idled since 2009, cash-poor URRE would need mega-bucks.


Running out of cash, URRE faces no positive options.


Shares of Uranium Resources (URRE) exploded this week as Japan hit the switch on its
first nuclear reactor since the earthquake-and-tsunami fueled nuclear disaster of 2011.


The Centennial, Colo. uranium mining company idled its operations years before Japan
shut down all nuke plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.


Yet, investors have begun grabbing URRE stock in the hope that Japan's nuclear plans
might make it worthwhile for URRE to restart mining. Though the price is settling down,
this speculation shot URRE shares up by a whopping 61 percent in five days to close
Wednesday at $2.49.


But URRE faces a very tough situation. Here are the highlights.


Production has ceased. URRE hasn't produced one speck of uranium in five years. Here's
what a URRE filing says:


"As a result of low uranium prices, we ceased production of uranium in 2009."


"None of URI's properties are currently in production."


URRE would restart mining only if uranium reaches and sustains prices above the cost of
restarting and production, at least in the mid-$40 range.

Here's what executives said in the Nov. 6 conference call:


"So the calculation would show that spot price of $43... $44, $45 dollar price
assuming $10 premium to long term, yes we have the 10% margin we need to get
started."


Optimism over Japan has propped up the price, but uranium still sells for an unprofitable
$41 per pound.


Uranium's only real commercial use is as a fuel for nuclear power plants that generate
electricity. The Fukushima meltdown tanked the price of uranium, and Japan's shutdown
of its remaining 47 nuclear plants kept it down.


Now, even if magic happens - Japan restarts one nuclear plant by about the second
quarter of 2015, and uranium prices hit $45 or more and remain there - URRE would still
require millions and at least the better part of a year to restart operations. In fact, URRE
leaders spoke of a 3- to 5-year time frame:


We can be ready to produce in south Texas on nine months' notice provided
we see two things; up price, spot price in little 40s and a trend to support that
price. So we tend to think of that in terms of three to five years more than
anything else is because we are operators on nature and we wish to be
conservative in our outlook for the company just so we are making promises
we can keep.


URRE runs through about $1 million per month, though it produces nothing. So its piggy
bank contains only enough cash to make it about 6 months.


A company Securities and Exchange Commission filing warns:


Our future uranium production, cash flow and income are dependent upon the
results of exploration as well as our ability to bring on new, as yet unidentified well
fields and to acquire and develop additional reserves... we may not be able to
remain in business and our stockholders may lose their entire investment.


Flooding the market with millions of shares? It could happen, because to hit "start" again,
URRE would need mega-bucks that it just doesn't have. So, where would the $6 to $7
million come from that execs say would be required to restart mining?

That's about how much money is available now, and the company is burning millions a
quarter - thanks partially to executives getting $2.2 million in compensation, including
$437,984 in stock-based bonuses last year, as they run a company that hasn't made a
dime in five years.


The company could consider several options to try to restart production: a stock offering,
get a loan or sell properties.


The first option would be to sell stock under the company's ATM agreement. The deal has
already allowed URRE to sell nearly 800,000 shares of stock. Earlier this month, the
company noted it still has $6.3 million worth that it could sell.


So, it could jump out with a multi-million share offering.


Under the second option, URRE has exhausted its senior convertible loan. And
considering the negative sentiment, the energy climate, unstable uranium prices and the
company's underperformance, URRE isn't a good prospect for getting a loan.


Part of the loan problem is the oversupply of uranium. A few years before the Japan
shutdowns, uranium fetched upwards of $80. Though uranium is about $41 due to the
Japan restart noise, the price has trended downward, falling to around $28 this summer.


The third option of selling property offers little promise. Anyone willing to pay millions for
cast-off, non-producing properties in the struggling, costly remediation, highly protested
solution uranium mining niche? Hmm. We didn't think so.


Conclusion:


Japan's restart of one plant, probably early next year, won't change the demand-supply
dynamics. Any additional nuclear plants will require a protested, long journey that could
take years or decades or forever - so the uranium price increase likely won't be sustained.
Besides, with oil around $80 per barrel, there may be less incentive for Japan to switch
from petroleum to nuclear.

URRE can't change the price of uranium, but must ultimately be able to sell the radioactive
mineral profitably.


So, in our view, it really comes down to just a couple likely options for URRE. It sells stock,
diluting shareholders, or it becomes a Nasdaq shell that must find another story/business.

What do you think the implications are then for an equity raise? $6mm at $2.25/ share -> a little over 2.5mm shares or
~10% dilution? 
Do you have a valuation target?

I don't think investors will pay the prevailing market price for URRE. Given the tough environment in the commodity
sector (and uranium), investors will demand a big discount.

I hear you... Though there were the same investors that gapped the stock up $2.50 lol

As stated in the Q3 earnings call, this company will fire up production when prices are stable over 40 and continue to
trend upward. That could very well happen over the next 6 months.

This article is very misleading, and takes a lot of information out of context.


Per the most recent 10-Q:


"At September 30, 2014, our working capital was $6,782,819, as compared with a working capital deficit of
$1,226,222 as of December 31, 2013, which represents an increase of $8,009,041. This increase in working capital is
primarily due to an increase in cash balances of $6,770,012 to $7,887,315 as of September 30, 2014. Given current
planned operations, the Company expects that its existing cash balances will provide it the necessary liquidity through
the third quarter of 2015. The Company will continue to look for ways to reduce its monthly cash burn rate while
exploring opportunities to raise additional funds, as needed."


Therefore, they have at least 12 months of operation given their current working capital (not 6 like the author stated).

Darn right this article is misleading... Totally out of context, misses key points about Japan's return to Nuclear Energy
and fails to mention HOW URRE plans to use it's working capital. Why didn't you mention the drilling program taking
place in Q1 of 2015? Or the fact that 10mm pounds of U is being sourced by a major utility, $200mm is on the table to
fill the coffers of U.TO and supply on the spot market is extremely limited. An intelligent investor might also consider
that URRE is one of very few well managed North American Uranium juniors with a near term project pipeline and a
huge material resource near the $40/lb mark. I also like how the author calls U mining a niche... Apparently 100 us
reactors, supplying 19% of us energy demand is a niche market... Hopefully the next time this author shorts URRE,
Mr Market teaches her a lesson.

I think posters here fail to understand the true cash needs of URRE. Yes, URRE can operate with current cash levels
for several months at a burn of $1M per month. This cash burn quote is if they don't do anything and operate at status
quo, which is burning investor money, which is YOUR money.


But posters should understand the cost to start-up production will be very expensive. They have ~30 employees (and
probably 1/3 of them are management who aren't in operations) right now per the recent filing. How many employees
would they need to start up a mining operation? Typical mining start up costs for a mine this size is around $10M
upfront capital before they even can start. Also ramp-up production would be at least several months. They would
need to do a equity financing to get this because no bank will lend project financing at current commodity price levels
and the fact the company does not have a track record of production since the plant has been shut down for over 5
years. Go ask the banks if you don't believe this. Ask yourself, would you give money to these guys?


Basically here are the scenarios: 1) URRE doesn't operate given instability in U3O8 pricing, keeps burning money
and paying themselves salary in hopes the market turns around, but they will require an equity raise to continue this,

2) URRE decides to start-up after 5 years of non-operation, which they will require an equity raise. Kind of stuck
between a rock and a hard place.


Good luck with this!

Wrong again… The current cash burn rate INCLUDES the Q1 2015 drilling program for the newly aquired
assets. So yeah, in 1 year I expect some results from this expenditure, but seeing as how the company's
current cash burn rate covers this timeframe, this is a non-issue in the short to medium term.


Did you sit in on the Q3 conference call? According the 150 years of combined experience of the
management team, it will take 6-7MM and 6-9 months to bring its processing facilities back online.


You also fail to mention that the management team of URRE is a new one as of 2013. How can you tell
people " the fact the company does not have a track record of production since the plant has been shut down
for over 5 years". This is irrelevant... completely irrelevant. And yes, I’ll ask the banks, how about the one that
CURRENTLY holds the convertible debt facility for URRE? But yeah, banks won’t lend money...

Mr. Fair
Can they not generate the funding by selling off some of their land?

Why not, instead, find a more well capitalized company? Here's a couple, v. similar to URRE (in situ), good
locations, just "better" IMO.


UEC (Uranium Energy Corp) 
URZ (Uranerz Energy Corp.) 
URG (UR Energy Inc._


I own these (my preferred "best" choices) at my usual allotment/risk. With respect to URRE, I have kept 100
shares to make me "watch" it. I agree with the general negative comments on this string.---There are other
uranium miners out there, all the Fundamental info I can find would suggest URRE is at the bottom of the
heap./jimo


14 Nov 2014, 12:30 PM


dancingmonkeys
They don't own the land, I believe. Like most mining companies, they own mining rights. They could sell those
mining rights. But I think there is enough excess U3O8 inventory out there, the price would be at a discount.

Looks like another zombie company living on the FED virus of free and easy money that's suspended...for now...a
slew of bankruptcies that will resume the flood of insolvency when either easy money is finally no more or deflationary
collapse ensues from Keynesian intervention.

Since this string started, Nov. 2014, URRE has continued to slide sideways to down. Meantime, UUUU and URZ are
merging and appear to be positioning themselves into a v. nice "larger" company. If you look at some company like
URRE, I'm thinking that management is in trouble as far as financings options.


Bankers are still NOT lending into the general mining industry. They appear to be watching/waiting but not doing
much. Perceived high risk here, according to them, is keeping them away. And hurting the mining industry in the
process.


General lending, right now, is about half what it was in 2007 before the Dodd-Frank fiasco. Lending is improving, but
v. slowly. ---Couple this with the onerous governmental environmental laws, and you have a soup that is hard to invest
in.


I've added to UUUU and URZ several times, do perceive those 2 as the best in situ uranium class, do consider in situ
as far superior to any land disturbance mining. I don't think this is going to take much longer. Supply right now is
tentative. Thinking Japan, any startup there, will propel this mining sector up quite a bit, and overnight. ----Uranium IS
going to go higher. The only question is when./jimo
