Exact Sciences: This Is Not The Next Pap Smear - Debunking The Bull
Case (4 of 5)
Jul. 29, 2013 8:59 AM ET32 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


As a reminder, in part one, we illustrated why the Cologuard test is actually less effective
than the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). In part two, we took this a step further, and
explained why it is not only worse than existing tests, but also significantly more
expensive, and therefore would not be either approved by the FDA or reimbursed by
CMS. In part three, we showed you why we feel that very few patients will actually use the
Cologuard test due to the disgusting nature of the test, even if it gets approved by the
FDA.


Now that we have given you the math at various sensitivities and specificities, as well as
the specifics regarding the test itself, we are going to debunk the bull thesis on Exact
Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS), which states that Cologuard will become as universally used
as the Pap smear and that it will be sold at a price of $400.


We believe that neither of these statements will prove to be anything other than words on
paper, and that Exact Sciences should be aggressively sold or shorted price target of
under $3 per share, which is the value of Exact's cash balance.


The Pap Smear Illusion


Exact Sciences wants investors to believe that Cologuard has the potential to become as
successful as the Pap smear. In the past three investor conference transcripts available
on Seeking Alpha (here, here, and here), CEO Kevin Conroy mentions the Pap Smear in
every presentation and submits it as the benchmark for Cologuard. The Pap smear has
been around for decades, has helped nearly eradicate cervical cancer, and is commonly
administered. According to a study in 2004 (found here), 93% of women in the US have
had at least one Pap smear screening in their lifetime, and 88% of women get a Pap
smear screening at least every three years. If Cologuard can replicate the Pap smear's
success, then Exact Sciences will be enormously successful.


However, there are clear differences between Cologuard and the Pap smear test, which
we believe will prevent Cologuard from ever reaching the status of the Pap smear test.


The Cologuard Test vs. The Pap Smear:


The Pap Smear Has No Competition

The main difference between the two tests is that the Pap smear has virtually no
competition. The Pap smear has been around for nearly six decades, and it still doesn't
have much competition. It has an effective monopoly on cervical cancer screening, which
is a large addressable market. Not only is it incredibly effective, but the Pap smear is also
incredibly cheap, costing on average $40 per test, according to a recent USA Today
article. That's 1/10th the price of Cologuard's $400 price point.


On the other hand, Cologuard faces incredible challenges competing with various non-
invasive FITs which are already widely utilized, more effective in screening for colorectal
cancer, more cost efficient, and easier to administer. In addition to the FOBT and FIT,
there are also other options such as the CT (Virtual) Colonoscopy, Double Contrast
Barium Enema, Flexible Sigmoidoscopy, and Capsule Endoscopy, as well as several tests
under development today.


Compliance and Ease of Use


Another major difference between the Pap smear and Cologuard is the Pap smear's
relatively easier administration. As discussed here, it is a "simple and quick test"
performed by a doctor every 1-3 years during a pelvic examination in women between the
ages of 21 and 65. In terms of compliance, the Pap smear is given in an office, by a
doctor, which ensures 100% compliance in patients who actually go to the doctor. As a
result, the American Cancer Center estimates that 87.6% of women age 21-64 are
screened for cervical cancer as recommended, as seen here.


In contrast to cervical cancer tests, colorectal cancer screens suffer from low compliance
rates. Just 61.9% of men between the ages of 50 and75 are screened for colorectal
cancer as recommended, and the American Cancer Center notes that similar trends are
found in women. When one considers how various colorectal screening tests are done,
such as the InSure FIT, which we highlight in part three, it's easy to see why compliance is
a challenge.


Taking this into consideration, we believe compliance with the Cologuard test will be an
even greater challenge. Cologuard is given as a take-home test that needs to be mailed to
a patient following its recommendation by a doctor and ultimately completed by a patient
at his house and then mailed back by the patient. The test is also unpleasant, and patients
are required to handle their own feces, as we described in part three of our series here.


Furthermore, Cologuard is expensive, costing 10 times more than the cheap and
incredibly effective Pap smear. As a take-home cancer screen, we do not believe
Cologuard will ever be as widely accepted as the Pap smear.

Scorecard: Cologuard Versus Pap Smear


So how does Cologuard stack up against the Pap smear? Can it ever rival the Pap smear
in the colorectal cancer space, as Exact Sciences claims? Let's go to the scorecard:


(Click to enlarge)


It is crystal clear that the notion that Cologuard has the potential to be as successful as
the Pap smear is an illusion. Due to the differences in competitive environment,
compliance, and price, it is clear to us that the bull case for Exact Sciences that claims
that Cologuard is the next Pap Smear is both illogical and reckless.


Mythical $400 Price Point: Ferrari Price For Yugo Performance


The Pap Smear Is Reimbursed, History Says That Cologuard Won't Be


The second part of the bull thesis for Exact Sciences is that Cologuard will warrant a high
price of $400 per test and receive attractive reimbursement rates from CMS. Nothing
could be further from the truth. We have proof from past CMS studies that show CMS
approval for Cologuard to be a pipedream. Multiple studies have examined the efficacy
and cost of Exact Sciences' products. These studies explicitly tell us that Cologuard will
not be found to be cost-effective and will not receive reimbursement approval anywhere
near the $400 price point that Exact Sciences envisions. We will focus primarily on the first
study, which can be found here.


First, we should point out that the Cologuard test from Exact Science is not exactly novel.
Investors may not know this, but Cologuard is the third iteration of Exact's stool DNA test.
The first two, PreGen-Plus and ColoSure, were released in 2003 and 2008. We will get
into the details and history of PreGen-Plus and ColoSure and their spectacular failures in
our finale, but for now, just know that neither test was approved by the FDA nor received

reimbursement by CMS. The two prior tests failed for the exact same reasons that we
believe Cologuard will fail; existing tests were better and far cheaper than Exact's
products.


The most important part of the first study evaluated the merits of Pre-Gen and ColoSure.
In the report, PreGen-Plus is noted as "version 1.1" and ColoSure is noted as "version
2.0." The studies ran two model simulations on PreGen-Plus and ColoSure and compared
the results (in terms of efficacy and resulting healthcare costs) to those of existing tests,
such as FIT, FOBT, and colonoscopies.


With regard to PreGen-Plus (version 1.1), the study found that PreGen-Plus was less
effective (measured in terms of discounted life years gained per 1,000 65 year olds) and
more costly (measured in terms of discounted total costs per 1,000 65 year olds) than
existing screening tests! The study even illustrated an efficient frontier examining cost vs.
benefit analysis for two different analyses on pages 35 and 36, which makes version 1.1's
inferiority clear. This is the exact same conclusion we showed you in parts one and two of
our series for Cologuard. Our analysis is in line with how CMS has evaluated Exact
Sciences' tests in the past.


The only way that the authors could justify PreGen-Plus was at $40-$60 per test, a far cry
from its actual $350 cost. This can be seen in page 37 of the report, which we summarize
here.


(Click to enlarge)


As for ColoSure (version 2.0), the test had not yet been officially released, so the study did
not have pricing information to perform the same exact analysis as PreGen-Plus.
However, the study performed the same cost justification analysis for ColoSure and
calculated what ColoSure would need to be priced at in order for it to be cost-effective,
based on its sensitivity and specificity.


Here it found that ColoSure needed to be priced at $17-$41 per test, which can also be
found on page 37. The lower warranted reimbursement for ColoSure was due to its much
lower specificity (85%) when compared to both PreGen-Plus (96%) and alternatives such
as FIT (95-98%). This lower specificity is also a weakness of Cologuard, which reported a
specificity of 87%.

What Does This Have To Do With Cologuard: Connect The Dots


The next part of the study is the most important for our analysis on Cologuard. The study
then created multiple hypothetical stool DNA tests with improved sensitivity and specificity,
one of which closely matches Cologuard's cancer sensitivity (albeit with much higher
specificity and pre-cancer sensitivity). These sensitivities can be found on page 28.


(Click to enlarge)


Similar to the analysis on ColoSure (version 2.0), the study determined where these
hypothetical tests needed to be priced in order to be cost-effective versus existing testing
methods.


Here is what they found. Not one justifies a price anywhere near Cologuard's mystical
$400 price point.

(Click to enlarge)


Notice that the 75% better hypothetical test is the most similar one to Cologuard in terms
of cancer sensitivity at 92%. In contrast, it also assumes a specificity of 99% and an
average pre-cancer sensitivity of 79%, both of which are significantly better than
Cologuard's 87% specificity and 42% pre-cancer sensitivity. The study found that the
justified price for the 75% better hypothetical test was $179-$247. The midpoint of that
range is barely over 50% of Cologuard's suggested $400 price point, and assumes a 14%
increase in specificity vs. Cologuard as well as an 88% increase in pre-cancer sensitivity.


Using this analysis, we can triangulate where Cologuard fits. On one end, we have
ColoSure (version 2.0) which is a slightly worse test than Cologuard. On the other end, we
have the 75% better hypothetical, which is significantly better than Cologuard.


(Click to enlarge)


If we take the midpoint of the cost-effective price range, we get $132, which is 67%
lower than Cologuard's $400 price point!


Even the Company's management knows that Cologuard doesn't stack up relative to
existing competition. This is why management tries to distract investors from the
appropriate comparator on the Q2 earnings call by saying that their economic study shows
"that Cologuard is significantly more cost-effective than, say for example, Pap screen and
also mammography." Isn't this comparing apples and oranges? The correct comparison is
relative to existing screening techniques for colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous polyps,
such as FIT. However, since management knows that Cologuard isn't competitive with
these existing tests, they divert attention from the appropriate comparator and try to
mislead investors. We doubt CMS will be so easy to mislead, especially since it has
already done the work to show Cologuard is not cost effective anywhere near $400 per
test.


More Official Proof That Cologuard Is Ineffective And Overpriced

Comments (32)


In a later study, the same authors updated the report, and the conclusions are the same
(here). We focused on the longer, original study because it provided sensitivities, but just
so you know, here are the conclusions from the shorter piece.


It found that stool DNA tests such as Cologuard are not competitive. Furthermore, stool
DNA tests would have to be priced at comparable levels to FIT's $23 price point and
nowhere close to Cologuard's $400 pipedream.


(Click to enlarge)


This is the proof that Cologuard won't be successful. CMS has already done the work and
showed that it will not approve Cologuard for reimbursement anywhere near $400 per test.
We have simply connected the dots for you.


More to Come


This article, article four in our five part series, deconstructed the EXAS bull case, by
explaining why Cologuard will never become as widely accepted at the Pap smear.


In our finale, we will conclude by diving further into the facts, and explaining how Exact
Sciences has misled investors (again). Stay tuned.

Not historically or factually correct. Tired of calling you out. Institutions know you are wrong or lying, so do I. Do your
own research folks, this is slanted stuff from somebody who made a bad short bet and is now desperate. Real shorts
who are good at what they do, don't resort to lying. Also possible this hedge fund is in cahoots with a distant
competitor or a company that wants to buy Exact on the cheap.

29 Jul 2013, 12:56 PM


Ulysses Benjamin Dover
I don't really care about 2015, I care about 2018-19. In that time frame, Cologuard (incl FIT) will take at least
2/3 of the FIT (incl FOBT) market, and potentially all of it. Analysts are using 1/3 as a way to couch
expectations, while their firms buy shares and brokers sell to favored clients, i.e. at Baird and Jeffries who
have been on board for several years.


The amount of money saved by Medicare on treatment of cancer by having cologuard find roughly double the
pre-cancers v FOBT/FIT is going to drive Medicare age people to test at age 65 or 66. That flood of people is
massive. http://1.usa.gov/15tbsXb


Insurance companies will also drive this test. I've talked to them as I am insurance licensed.


The cost of this test, say $400 one time and $1200 over seven years for 3 tests, is tiny compared to cancer
treatment which is generally in excess of $150k per case and more for those caught later. Eliminating roughly
half of the cancer treatment with pre-cancer treatments, which is $10-20k per case is a massive incentive for

It would be interesting to see a health economics comparison done for Cologuard similar to that recently published for
Septin9 (Ladabaum et al., Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, June 2013)--Also, while every test will
have its "price" ...its likely to be less than "MSRP" (Exact or Epi)


Also, regarding Cologuard and its bundled FIT component--I actually would also be interested in seeing the
performance data individually calculated; MDx (NDRG4 + BMP3 + KRAS) only and FIT only....for both Ca and Pre-Ca

A few points about the hedge funds source:


Just an 2007 advisory, not an official pricing report. From the preface: No statement in this report should be construed
as the official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the US Department of Health and Human
Services.


The cost-effective level of the version 1.1 test, quoted here as the range from $179 to 247, is the number in relation to
CMS payments for colonoscopy, and the societal-modified CMS cost of colonoscopy. Their comparison CMS cost for
a colonoscopy with polyptectomy is $673 (CMS) and 1,019 (societal modified) (page 18 Table 1 2010 Update).


They clearly state that future compensation can be positively impacted by improvements in the test and in adherence
strategies, which Exact Sciences has and will achieve in my opinion.

Author’s reply »  You are correct that this is not an official pricing report, but it does give excellent insight into
where CMS is likely to reimburse the test.


The cost effective range of $179-247 is not based on version 1.1. It is based on an enhanced version 1.1, the
sensitivity and specificity of which are substantially better than Cologuard.


Exact's performance vs 2.0 and the enhanced 1.1 can be seen in a table in the above article.

You continue to mislead readers and investors . . .


A.) EXAS CEO Kevin Conroy has never used the Pap Smear as a "benchmark" for Cologuard. Those are your words,
not his. He merely uses the Pap Smear as an example of "programmatic" testing, since the use of the Pap Smear has
literally eradicated cervical cancer, even though it's sensitivity is rather poor (57%).


Mr. Conroy should know something about the Pap Smear, given that his previous company, Third Wave Technologies
developed an HPV screening test and was bought out by Hologic (http://bit.ly/Nqc4Sr) in 2007. The majority of
cervical cancer comes from HPV.


B.) Your discussion of PreGen+ and ColoSure are not only misleading, but a complete waste of time.


Those tests were not ready for prime-time commercial application given that they required nearly 50 hours of
processing time in the Lab. These two CRC screening tests were developed by a previous management team at
EXAS and utilized a Vimentin methylation bio-marker that is not used in Cologuard. Neither of those two screening
tests ever underwent an FDA Clinical Trial, and the previous management team never applied for FDA approval via a
PMA.


Again, PreGen+ and ColoSure have literally nothing to do with Cologuard, which EXAS senior scientist Graham
Lidgard has developed over the last 4 years. By the way, Lidgard probably knows a thing or two about developing
blood tests. He was responsible for numerous patents at Gen-Probe (a basic blood screening company for STD's and
Hepatitis). Gen-Probe was bought out by Hologic in 2012 for $3.7 Billion by Hologic. See a common denominator
here yet?


C.) You continue to make highly erroneous claims regarding the compliance rates for FIT testing.


For example, a June 2011 article in the American Journal of Gastroenterology highlighted a retrospective cohort
analysis of 1.12 million patients aged 50-75 years that were seen at any of the 136 Department of Veteran Affairs
medical centers across the US in 2000 and followed through 2005.


"The primary outcome was receipt of adequate CRC screening as defined by receipt of FOBT's in at least 4 out of 5
years or receipt of any number of FOBT's in addition to at least one colonoscopy, flex sigmoidoscopy, or double-
contrast barium enema.

Bottomline: Only 41.1% of the men and 43.6% of women received adequate screening. Of the 384,527 men who
received exclusively FOBT, 42.1% received a single FOBT, 26.0% received 2 tests, 17.8% received 3 tests, and only
14.1% were documented to have received at least 4 tests during the study period. Among the 10,469 female veterans
receiving FOBT alone, rates were similar with only 13.7% completing at least 4 FOBT's in the 5-year study period.


Conclusion: Adherence to repeated FOBT is low, suggesting that cross-sectional measurements of quality may
overestimate the programmatic success of CRC screening."

Author’s reply »  So just to be clear, there were two main points to this article: (1) colocrap is not likely be
widely accepted like the pap smear (for a variety of reasons) and (2) colocrap will not get the $400+
reimbursement level touted by the company. You don't seem to disagree with either of these contentions.
Instead, you completely ignore important evidence such as the reimbursement studies which concluded that
even a much better test than colocrap would barely garner $200 of reimbursable value. You have set a new
low for yourself.


Are you sure that the CEO isn't using the pap as a benchmark? Look at the following quote from the
shareholder meeting: "We also saw that in this study, 66% of those large precancerous polyps were detected,
42% of all precancerous polyps. When you compare this to the Pap smear, the conventional Pap smear
detects about 58% of what are called CIN 2 or CIN 3 lesions, the most significant precursor lesions to cervical
cancer."


Gee, it looks to me like you need to go back and try analyzing this company again, because your
argumentation is full of holes.

Your "analysis" is so poor that it would be crushed by my local high school's debate team.


You've never been able to answer my question about . . . if FIT is such a great performing and easy to use
inexpensive screening test for CRC, then why are over 50,000 Americans dying from colon cancer every year
and 140,000 new cases every year?


Doesn't sound like FIT is the kind of "great" test that you make it out to be. If it was, CRC would not be the #2
killer of Americans over the age of 50.


Game, set, match. 
You're done.

You have done a lot of work on these articles, too bad the stock seems to have based at $13 no matter how much
mud you throw at it. I hope you made a few bucks. I know I have by betting against you on the way down to $12.52

Kevin Conroy and his team know how to win, its in their DNA, look at the board and their history of success. The
entire exec management and board have other things to do if EXAS wasn't going to be approved by the FDA, and the
pricing by CMS will make Cologuard a financial home run.


The shorts better look for other opportunities.

It appears that the word "cost" is being misconstrued. Very few tests or procedures are reimbursed by 3rd party
payors at cost. In checking my most recent laboratory tests, the charges were over $1,000 but the reimbursement
was around $200. All your assumptions of cost, at the $400 rate, are really not real health care world realities. In
addition, our health care system does not approve, or restrict, patient choice based on a less expensive alternative.


Any assumptions based on the $400 "cost" and that the test will not be approved because there are less expensive
tests with greater sensitively are not applicable. Our health care system does not work this way. Due to the politics,
there is much resistance in restricting patient choice based on the availability of better options.

Author’s reply »  Maybe I should be more explicit: sell-side analysts are assuming that EXAS nets $400 per
test - for instance Canaccord in their 7/24 note forecasts $32 million of 2014 product revenue from 80k tests
or $400/test


29 Jul 2013, 05:40 PM


drberger
where did they get the information about the revenue and number of tests?


29 Jul 2013, 10:37 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I'm just telling you what is in the Canaccord model in terms of revenue, number of tests, and
ASP for the test. We know that the company is talking about prices as high as $550/test (see last conference
call). I don't think it will get reimbursed at those levels.

At least the Company is referencing current CMS billing codes for KRAS mutuations, two Methylation
markers, and a hemoglobin component for their $550 price discussion. You have referenced absolutely
nothing for your claim of $150.

The majority of analysts who cover EXAS continue to use the same price per test that they've had for the last
two years ($300).

Doesn't look like ANYONE agrees with you. Better hope your Tuesday article is a home run! LOL.

I would feel more comfortable with your "analysis" if you: 
1. Were not anonymous. 
2. Revealed any position you have, long or short in EXAS. 
3. Advised us if you have any scientific or medical background.

As far as cost/reimbursement is concerned. What EXAS is doing with the concurrent CMS review is truly ground-
breaking from the perspective of how future medical testing is going to be valued. This is an important exercise for all
in the Lab Medicine community (and probably for the Street folks as well) and should be watched closely. One very
interesting aspect of this process--as it pertains to Cologuard, is whether there is a mechanism to review the relative
contribution of each of the markers in the context of the tests overall performance---In others words, was the marker
selection (as determined now but a very robust prospective clinical trial) appropriate for the intended use
populations?. For example; does KRAS G13D, or some of the less frequent KRAS codon 12 mutations contribute
anything to the analysis or how do the methylation markers perform based upon the age or ethnicity of the patient--
particularly in the context of specificity? There is much that we will learn from Deep-C once the data is published.

Author’s reply »  I don't think trying to mislead people into paying a lot for a test by making irrelevant such as
to mammograms and pap smears is anything new. Companies with bad news and economically unjustifiable
products have been making fake comparisons for years. If you compare cologuard to FIT or colonoscopy or
sigmoidoscopy etc then the appropriate price is about $150.

Notice that this "author" hasn't once addressed how Cologuard will be used for IBD, which has 1.4 million sufferers
and which optical Colonoscopy is rendered useless due to all of the inflammation of the colon. Random biopsy is the
standard of care. Not a screening via FIT.

The company s first product is the LuViva Advanced Cervical Scan, a non-invasive device used to detect cervical
disease instantly and at the point of care. Its LuViva device would identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly,
non-invasively, and at the point-of-care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the light reflected or
emanating from the cervix.


I would think this will be part of the mix
