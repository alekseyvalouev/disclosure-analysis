Overseas Shipholding Group Inc.: A Guaranteed Zero For Equity
Holders

by: Infitialis


In life, one of the rarest mental states is the state of certainty. As Benjamin Franklin once
said: "Nothing is certain but death and taxes," this fantastic quote humorously reminds us
of how little in life can be objectively predicted with certainty; ergo the sun rising in the
east or the various lunar phases. Aside from scientifically well understood events, the
state of certainty is just as rare in the world of finance where market participants with a
certain view of financial events can capitalize when valuations do not yet reflect a certain
outcome.


Knowing this, Infitialis focused on a niche segment of finance where we could project with
certainty the ultimate outcome providing significant profit opportunities for our readers
while preventing unnecessary losses for retail investors that do not have the expertise to
conduct in-depth research. Since August, we have published 9 reports exposing alleged
fraud or folly. Every single company we reported on experienced declines of 20% or more
with some companies declining by over 99% and one company even being halted by the
SEC following our expose.


Today we present a report on a company that provides what we believe is one of those
truly rare opportunities in finance: a certain outcome. We decided to write this report after
being challenged by one of our readers. Following a rudimentary review of the
fundamentals, we explained to the reader that the company was a guaranteed zero alas
they remained unconvinced. As a result, we decided to back up our claims with facts and
figures that will demonstrate to any reader why Overseas Shipholding (OSGIQ.PK) equity
holders receiving zero is as certain of an event as the sun rising tomorrow, death, or
taxes.


A Bankrupt Company Bid Up By Naive Penny Stock Traders


Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a New York Based shipping company that recently
filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection on November 14, 2012. Since then, shares of
the company have been delisted from the NYSE to the pink sheets where the ticker has
been changed from OSG to OSGIQ.PK. Initially, shares of the company declined by 60%

following the bankruptcy announcement, but over the past week retail penny stock traders
have bid up shares causing a rise of over 100% with the shares nearly touching their pre-
bankruptcy announcement level of $1.00 a share on Friday, November 23.


To most logical investors, this graph may seem a bit crazy: Why would a bankrupt
company trade higher immediately after filing a non pre-packaged Chapter 11 confirming
the company is unable to pay its debts? Luckily this was not our first rodeo into penny
stock land and our previous forays provided some much needed color. After all this was
the wild west of finance where in less than four months we witnessed multiple cases of
worthless companies with no cash at all and virtual offices be bid up to near billion dollar
valuations only to drop like rocks once the herd recovered their senses. But what bothered
us most about this recent case of penny stock madness was when we noticed retail
investors touting the "wealth surplus" in the equity shares of or the potential for the equity
holders to "win big" if/when the company emerged from Chapter 11.


Some of our more astute readers may have already picked up on the fact that the Infitialis
collective of analysts specializes in the distressed securities space. As a matter of fact,
when we are not exposing frauds and scams, we get paid very handsomely to analyze
distressed and esoteric securities. In other words, distressed securities such as this are
our bread and butter and so we enjoyed this opportunity to provide our readers with an all-
encompassing review of how bankruptcy proceedings work and why there is absolutely no
chance for equity holders to be left with anything at all.


A Quick Primer on Bankruptcy and Capital Structure


When analyzing bankruptcy situations, investors should be cognizant of and/or guided by
three key tenets:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1027971-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-a-guaranteed-zero-for-equity-holders 3/15


1) Bankruptcies are negative - No matter what management says, bankruptcies are
always bad for both the company and its investors. Simply put, a Chapter 11 filing is an
admission on the part of management that the debt load has become too large and
unsupportable by the disclosed value of the underlying assets. This is a very important
fact that distressed investors have to be cognizant of as a Chapter 11 situation should only
be viewed as a cure for what is either a flawed business model, over-indebted capital
structure, or a combination of the two.


2) Debts, obligations, and encumbrances are stacked in a hierarchy that leaves the
common equity holders at the bottom - In a bankruptcy, all the obligations of the
company are stacked. Once a liquidation or reorganization plan is approved by the courts,
the net proceeds from an asset liquidation or, if chosen by creditors, the value of the
reorganized entity is distributed to the debt holders first with only the remaining piece
(should there even be one) distributed to the common equity holders. In other words:
Common Equity holders will get paid LAST, only after all debts and obligations are paid.


3) Bonds being senior are the single most important leading indicator for any
potential equity recovery - Whenever a bankrupt company has tradeable bonds,
investors should look to those prices when trying to assess the potential for any equity
recovery. The logic is extremely simple: Bonds trading at or near their par value (the price
which reflects 100% principal recovery for bond investors) indicate that market participants
are anticipating that there is enough asset value to fully cover the debts and obligations.
However, when bonds trade at a significant discount to par value, investors should look to
that mathematical discount as the formula from which to project the true value of the
assets.


OSGIQ: A Vanilla Bankruptcy With an Obvious Surplus of Debt to Equity


Using the short primer we provided we will now walk readers through the capital structure
of OSGIQ. Contrary to what some penny stock promoters may try to sell, this is not a GGP
situation (where the assets being prestigious tangible shopping malls actually appreciated



http://www.otcmagic.com/overseas-shipholding-group-inc-pink-osgiq-q-madness

in value while in bankruptcy) nor is it even a Dynegy situation (where after much fanfare
and several outspoken equity investors claiming sufficient asset coverage equity holders
still got shafted).


OSGIQ is a simple bankruptcy situation to decipher because it is a business that has no
discernable moat or durable competitive advantage, no brand at all, no strategic
irreplaceable trophy assets, and no intellectual property. This company is in the seaborne
transportation market with its assets consisting of some cash and 63 rapidly depreciating
vessels encumbered by nearly $3 billion in debt. There is no reason for any business to
use the services of as opposed to the plethora of other seaborne shippers as the industry
has become highly commoditized with rates being valued weekly via a market based
system transparently driven by supply and demand. Moreover, the industry is plagued by
pronounced cycles of booms and busts with one of the worst busts being experienced
currently leading not only to significant declines in shipping rates but sharp declines in the
asset values of vessels.


These reasons are part of what led to the bankruptcy for with the business becoming
worthless over the past few quarters as the double whammy of rate and demand declines
led to significant losses with the company burning over $275 million in cash in the 6
quarters from March 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012, equating to a quarterly burn of $46
million. Adding insult to injury, the company has not filed financials since June 30th 2012,
with the Audit Committee officially declaring the financials as unreliable on October 19,
2012 , providing the first sign of the company's insolvency to the market and leading to
over 60% declines in both the debt and common stock.


For a company like OSGIQ, a Chapter 11 proceeding will be relatively straightforward and
expeditious with only two likely outcomes that would provide an exit from Chapter 11:


1) A liquidation and/or a distribution of ownership of the assets (cash and vessels)
to the creditors.


2) If solvency can be achieved (a tall order in this case) and the desire exists
(unlikely), a combination of (1) plus a pro-forma better capitalized entity could
emerge with the creditors converting a portion of their debt to equity.


As bonds trade at between $0.30-0.40 on the dollar (indicating that only 30-40% of the
debt will be repaid) the odds of scenario (2) are of very low probability. More relevant to
this report is that equity holders only stand a chance to receive anything under scenario

(2). Unfortunately for equity holders, as we will detail in the next sections, the true debt
load when weighed against the true asset base confirms the bond pricing as fair and the
common stock as wildly overvalued.


An Accurate Review of Both Assets and Liabilities Confirms Equity Is Worthless


In this section, we will objectively tally up both assets and liabilities of OSGIQ. As we
noted, the assets per OSGIQ's own audit committee should not be relied upon
nevertheless we have constructed a model that provides a range we are comfortable with
and which reconciles with the bond valuations that project a 30-40% recovery on the debt.


In the table below, we have tallied up the debts using both the Bankruptcy Filing as well as
the most recent 8-k filed with the SEC. We have also provided pricing on the bonds that
were exchange traded. It is important to stress that there may very well be additional
debts/obligations and/or encumbrances that emerge as part of the Chapter 11 process.


As readers can see, the total tally comes in at $2.73 billion, a whopping figure that must
be fully paid with interest owed prior to any equity holders being in any position of
recovery.


Against this table of liabilities (which could ultimately be larger due to undisclosed
obligations in the worst case) weigh the assets from which the bond and equity investors
hope to recover their capital.


There are several issues with the asset side of the balance sheet for :


1) The company has not filed financials since June 30th, making it more difficult (but not
impossible) to estimate its financial health, specifically its cash balance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1027971-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-a-guaranteed-zero-for-equity-holders 6/15


2) Even if one wanted to believe the asset side of the balance sheet, the Audit Committee
itself stated that the financials should not be relied upon, making it clear that there are to
be major impairments made on the asset side of the ledger.


3) Even if relying on the outdated June 30th, financials over 80% of the assets on the
balance sheet consist of vessels which are supposed to be carried at cost minus
impairment but for which OSGIQ had not made any meaningful impairments in nearly 4
years, a time which saw vessel prices decline by as much as 50%.


With this understanding, we will now review the asset side of the balance sheet from June
30th and make adjustments that we believe provide a more accurate picture of the
company's financial health.


Tangible Assets as of June 30 2012


Cash $ 226,554,000.00


Voyage Receivables $ 185,345,000.00


Other Receivables $ 48,994,000.00


Inventories $ 39,307,000.00


Vessels $ 3,186,542,000.00


Total Tangible Assets $ 3,686,742,000.00


Operating under the assumption that the financials should be relied upon (even though the
audit committee asked us not to do so), we must first adjust the cash balance to reflect the
business period from June 30, 2012 to November 14, 2012 (the date of the bankruptcy
filing). Over the past 6 quarters, the company has produced negative cash flow of $46
million per quarter ($15.3 million per month). Since June 30th, business conditions have
only deteriorated for seaborne shippers with shipping rates and demand declining making
it not only plausible but highly probable that the company continued to burn cash at the
same rate. Therefore, we predict that from June 30 to November 14, it has burnt an
5/20/2018 Overseas Shipholding Group Inc.: A Guaranteed Zero For Equity Holders - Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSEMKT:OSGB) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1027971-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-a-guaranteed-zero-for-equity-holders 7/15


additional $69,000,000 in cash ($15.3 million multiplied by 4.5 months). Following this
exercise which we believe to be very conservative, we project that the company currently
has a cash balance of $157 million.


For simplification purposes, we are going to assume that all receivables and inventories
will end up fetching their entry values. The reality is that those assets will most likely fetch
30-70% of their entry values but because the overwhelming majority of the assets consist
of vessels, we need only to quantify the true value of the vessels in order to prove that the
asset side of the ledger falls short of the $2.7 billion in debts and obligations.


Everything Hinges on the Value of the Vessels


The OSG business has not produced free cash flow since 2006. Not only is the business
wildly unprofitable, it is truly a liability to any purchaser in its current form. There is neither
a discernible brand nor moat nor any intangible asset that would garner any premium
above what may be reflected on the balance sheet. We stress this again because as we
reach this stage of the analysis, it becomes crystal clear that any prospects for recovery
at all for creditors will come from a liquidation of the vessels to the highest bidder.


The company values its fleet of vessels at $3.18 billion as of June 30. This valuation bears
no relation to reality. For one, the company has impaired its entire fleet of vessels by only
$300 million since 2004 instead choosing an approach which allowed the company to
leverage its fleet by utilizing its holding company's top line revenues via credit facilities and
bonds as opposed to individual collateralized deals on a per vessel basis. This is very
analogous to how banks financed themselves during the housing bubble by utilizing
holding companies and marking their loans according to internal models. Let us review in
detail how OSGIQ values its fleet from the most recent 10-K filed with the SEC:



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000114420412011875/v303067_10k.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1027971-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-a-guaranteed-zero-for-equity-holders 8/15


The notion that OSGIQ vessels are worth $3.2 billion today is one that is completely
unrealistic. As bond investors have indicated by rerating the bonds to the $0.30-$0.40 on
the dollar levels, a more realistic valuation for the vessels would be in the $1.5-$2.0 billion
range conservatively. This is partly why on Friday bond investors decided to sue Citigroup
(NYSE:C) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) for signing off on the OSG financials and
underwriting the bonds. It is imperative to remember that we are not talking about a
portfolio of appreciating tangible property such as power plants or real estate. Shipping
tankers are rapidly depreciating assets much like automobiles and airplanes. Coupled with
a terrible macro-environment, a fire sale of vessels may in our view fetch only $1.0-$1.3
billion in the present environment.


As part of our research, we decided to conduct an independent valuation of the vessels
using comparable sales information from reputable sources such as Lloyds List and
various Ship Brokers.


More Realistic Valuation of Vessels:


VLCCS (Includes ULCCS) 11 $ 499.00


Aframaxes 10 $ 200.00


Panamaxes 9 $ 235.00


International Fleet


Panamax 4 $ 155.00


Handysize 16 $ 375.00


Total Other International Flag 1 $ 4.68


Total US Flat Vessels 12 $ 600.00


Fleet Total 63 $ 2,068.68

We conducted three separate valuations of the fleet. Of all three, this was the most
optimistic amounting to roughly $2 .0 billion in value for the fleet which was why we
decided to use this valuation when constructing our valuation model for OSGIQ.


Using a more appropriate valuation for the fleet, we can now construct a more realistic
snapshot of the actual assets available for recovery:


Infitialis Pro-Forma Potential Recovery Table 


After subtracting the $69 million in cash that was most likely lost in the period between
June 30 and November 14 and incorporating a more realistic valuation for the vessels, we
are left with the following assets. It is important to keep in mind that in this table we
assume all receivables and inventories are worth their June 30 entries even though that is
also highly improbable.


Even when trying to give OSGIQ every chance by valuing the vessels at our most
optimistic valuation and including nearly $270 million in inventories and receivables, we
are still left with a deficiency of $237 million when weighed against the debts and
obligations of $2.73 billion. Moreover in our exercise, we have made the assumption that
OSGIQ will pay no taxes on any of the proceeds from a sale of the vessels when in reality
there is nearly $300 million in deferred tax due to tax related depreciation taken on the
vessels over the years. The assets do not provide enough of a cushion to even warrant a
punt for equity holders. Again, had the portfolio of assets consisted of real estate or even
securities, there may have been an investment case made as to potential future
appreciation, but given the assets are rapidly depreciating vessels, there is no investment
case at all.

Experience Teaches Only The Teachable... Aldous Huxley


Had the balance sheet truly been as rich as management of OSGIQ marked it, the
company could have easily supported the $2.7 billion debt load. In reality, the vessels
require significant impairment in the order of 40-60% while the business itself is worthless
producing losses of $50-200 million per annum. While we have done a lot of work here,
we have merely confirmed what the bond prices already told us: equity is a guaranteed
zero. No macro environment will change this fact as the committee of creditors will likely
decide to liquidate the vessels and distribute the proceeds expeditiously. Conversely, if the
creditors see value in a reorganized entity, they will be the ones to own that entity in its
entirety.

Another very good example of a pattern I've talked about - notice how it rallied almost 100% right after announcing BK

I just read your bk article from last year in the context of this equity. It does a great job of answering questions
regarding the process. Still, the particular facts regarding osg make this an interesting exercise to ascertain
valuation. As you can see there is quite a bit of feedback here and in the second part article comments
illustrating the difficulty of such a task. Still the takeaway for me is your remark that the figure is closer to 90
percent for equities that get hosed in ch 11.

Adjusted Return, Contributor
Hi - interesting article. But shouldn't you add to the cash the $343m that OSG drew on their $1.5b after the end of the
Q2? As you see the loan is almost all drawn down at CHh11 but not at Q2. So you don't make an "accurate review" of
both assets and liabilities same pont of time. This makes your equity calculation jump to an embarrasingly high
+$100m and I think you should adjust your article, focusing more on the thoughts after that table.


I'm not a proponent of the company but I would think that the debt is not the main issue. The charter-in obligations
were bleeding the company and the unidentified tax issue is what kills the bonds. Subject to the tax issue, personally I
think the equity does have some value, which, of course, is impossible to calculate.


26 Nov 2012, 11:58 AM 


Infitialis, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Adjusting for the cash drawdown is difficult to do at the moment as we have no insight into
the financials since June 30. While the draw down was significant so much is left unanswered that we chose
to work from the Jun 30 Balance Sheet and make adjustments as you can see in the piece. Where we were
loose with our assumptions on the draw down we were extremely optimistic on asset values. In the end it all
balances out. Again, look to the bonds as the ultimate arbiter of value here or comps for vessel values.
OSGIQ equity will result in zero recovery for investors. If there were ever a case for equity recovery it was the
Dynegy case yet in the end every asset valuation assumption came in as overblown while the liabilities and
creditor demands turned out to be much larger. Before you can intelligently make a comment about equity
recover you need to see the bonds trade at or near par.


26 Nov 2012, 12:17 PM 


Adjusted Return, Contributor
Look, I'm not going to argue for or against this and as I said you make a valid case for the equity being
worthless. But trying to say with a straight face that you ignore $343m of assets on the balance sheet (all
other things being equal), information on which is included in the 8-K you reviewed, while taking into account
the related liability, undermines the quality of the rest of your arguments.


26 Nov 2012, 12:27 PM 


HighOak
Just my two cents, but I would use the $2.836B (vs. your $2.737B) of debt from the 8-K at the filing and add
the $343mm draw to the cash balance since it is indisputable that they took the draw. That is a net swing of
$243mm to the plus side for computing the recovery value. Having said that, all of these charter ins will end
up being unsecured creditors in the proceedings. In the next three years, those obligations alone total
$750mm. I know that is a simplistic view of the charter ins, but the point is that a lot of those leases will be
rejected and there will be an additional unsecured creditor class with hundreds of millions of dollars in claims.


Net result, still a zero on the equity. What I'd like to know with certainty is whether or not the bank debt here is
truly pari with the bonds or if it is somehow technically senior via guarantees or structurally (at opco versus

Infitialis - Congratulation for the article. 
Why are bond investors so smart ?  
Have they better indications ? 
Another question: how much time do you expect to be needed to 
exit from bankruptcy or to define the question of share value ?


26 Nov 2012, 12:28 PM 


Infitialis, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Bond investors aren't necessarily smarter and there have certainly been cases in history
where bond investors were wrong. That being said bond investors having risked significantly more capital
than equity investors have a much better understanding of the ultimate value of the assets, especially in a
liquidation. Right now the entire pool of equity investors "betting" on recovery is only $30 million while the pool
of debt investors totals $2.7B. Finally, when bonds trade at such a large discount to par and the asset figures
reconcile to the bond investor estimation of ultimate recovery (as is the case with OSGIQ when properly
valuing their assets and marking the vessels to market) it becomes crystal clear that the bond investors have
it right and the equity investors have it wrong. Yet another terrible indicator is that the equity actually rose to
pre bankruptcy levels following the bankruptcy. Short of a pre-packaged chapter 11 there can be no logical
explanation for an immediate price appreciation. In this case there is sufficient evidence that the price
appreciation was due to pennystock investors and websites promoting OSGIQ as an equity recovery play.
Hope that answered your questions!

I certainly don't believe the US flag operation could salvage this mess but they are, contrary to the article, unique and
highly marketable today. US law requires US built tankers to carry oil from AK to any other state (for the most part AK
oil is reserved for US -- there have been some exceptions). The BP partnership provides lucrative long term charters
for these ships. The US bottom tanker market is not the world market where the bulk of the OSG fleet trades. But this
might just be a footnote to the larger debts listed above. 
Transferring those assets would have to be to another US citizen in any liquidation.

Have you looked carefully at the guarantees in the bank debt and bonds, are there any nonguarantor noncollateral
assets tha could help the stock out?

I would echo PaulKrupa's comments 
I have seen estimates that the US flag business generates over $100mm in EBITDA and at 5x valuation that adds
$500 to assets values less what you valued the ships for 
Next if the revolver is drawn down, as the company mentioned on their call, that would increase cash but also
increase debt, so it's a NAV wash 
Lastly what happens if the company remains in bankrupty, cuts their cash burn throughbcharter negotiations and the
tanker market improves? That could substantially increase the company's value 
My question forbthe board is when will the court set creditors committees? Will equity be represented?

Bond moved up from $28 to about $40.


Don't know how long it takes. So I sell bond to lock in 40% profit

This article and especially the comments that reflect some sensible remarks about projections for tanker rates I found
very informative. 
Generally, there is a glut of tonnage and rates are suffering and will continue to suffer until more tonnage is scrapped
and demand increases. 
http://seekingalpha.co...


Another article in Marine Log refers to the demise of the tanker industry if something isn't done about the rates.


Generally, a pessimistic outlook on rate recovery.


In hindsight I find the actions of OSG pretty reckless. They screwed themselves trading with Iran (no small irony with
majority Israel stockholder) and losing their US gov't loan guarantees in the process. And borrowing money to pay the
dividend in such a down market? There's a lot of family money tied up in the equity so I thought there would be some
white knight saving these guys. Up until yesterday I was long on OSG. 
Contrary to the author I see them as a brand with some diversification including liquid natural gas. Not any carrier can

haul this stuff and retaining qualified crews is a problem in today's labor market to say nothing of the specialized ships
required to carry. But the recent surge in US gas production has thwarted a lot of foreign imports on gas energy so
this is quite diminished at least in the short term. 
It's hard to argue with the author's math. Yet I watch the stock price going up over a dollar today. What's up with that? 
I'm too depressed over the loss on my long position to get in on the short selling but (not that I am familiar with the
rules and practices with pink sheet listings) but if this math is true all you have to do is buy at any price and look to
make 100 percent. Am I wrong?

Wow! This stock is obviously worthless... The spike has got to be because of little traders getting fooled in by
pumpers. I saw some posts from promoters saying to watch this stock. What is there to watch? This co. is bankrupt.

There is an error in the article. It accounts for the $343 MM loan (which company withdrew in July) on the liability side
but does not add that money to the cash balances.


If that adjustment is made then the potential recovery will become positive :)

This is fascinating. Infitialis has compiled a lot of good information yet the equity holders seem to be holding on.
These are primarily big institutions. Why do they no liquidate? I did see one insider liquidate a little post bankruptcy.


Two other comments that intrigue me: 
The company is structured as independent subsidiaries. How does this impact the potential outcomes. 
The second comment was from someone describing the fixed income holders as unwilling to accept equity. I don't
know what that means from a practical technical procedure perspective.


At the end of the day it's easy to see how easy it is to fall for sales pitches since it's so difficult to sift through the
mountains of intertwined financials. Right or wrong, thanks Infantialis for your strong efforts to map this out.

This has been a wild ride! I got out on the way down and got hosed. I wasn't willing to risk money on a company on
the verge of bankruptcy. But being in the shipping industry and familiar with the players I watched as the stock sunk to

42 cents only to rise in leaps and bounds to over nine dollars a share. Each giant leap aggravated me but there was
no way I was going to buy into a bankruptcy. But i am amazed at the way this company has recovered. Is it because
there folks think the tax loss will be paid by the lawyers insurance? I wouldn't be surprised if OSG's counsel was part
the advising firm.


Anyhow, where is this going? Is it primarily the US flag segment driving this or is there an upside on the foreign flag
sector?

It's an extraordinarily speculative investment (and more so with each price increase), driven by the extremely
robust supply/demand dynamics for Jones Act vessels--think (and thank) the Bakken. That threw them a
lifeline when they needed it, and the international oil/product hauling market has been improving, though with
newbuilds a danger again who knows how long that'll last...


There may yet be no residual value for shareholders, but the haughtiness of the "guaranteed zero"
declaration rubbed me the wrong way.

Yes, 
I followed for a few months on Twitter as Infitalis at first tried to hold his position but got washed out by the
tsunami. Day traders are an awful lot on twitter!

Anyone can be wrong. All of us have been wrong at times. But this guy was quite arrogant. I guess it's a
