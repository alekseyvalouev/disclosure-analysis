AXGN


AxoGen, based near Gainesville, Florida, sources nerve strips cut from cadavers
and packages them in several lengths as grafts for peripheral nerve repair.


The stock has soared from approximately $2 in 2014 to a recent high of $57,
closing recently near $28.


Our research leads us to conclude that AxoGen is a stock promote with a dubious
profile and prospects.

We summarize our research process and key findings below.


Of numerous red flags at AXGN, one simple question led us to investigate the company.
If the bull case is true - that in 2007, AXGN launched the only cadaver-sourced nerve
graft in the market and is therefore a monopoly; that the company has a $2.7 billion total
addressable market; that the product has an overwhelming value proposition for
surgeons and patients - then why are AXGN's LTM revenues a mere $78MM 11 years
after product launch, and by our estimate, only $39mm in its flagship nerve graft
product?

8/8/22, 10:19 PM AxoGen _ An Overhyped, Cash-Burning Reverse Merger At 12x Revenue, $5.07 Target Price/82% Downside (NASDAQ _ AXGN)…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4228960-axogen-overhyped-cash-burning-reverse-merger-12x-revenue-5_07-target-price-82-percent?source=all_art… 3/14


In order to answer this question, we conducted intensive due diligence on the company.
Our investigation included research calls with over 20 sources, encompassing a broad
mosaic of experts on the company and its origins, target markets, key products,
customers, competitors, culture, and accounting and business practices.


We spoke with 8 former sales reps, area managers, and former independent
distributors; 3 former employees in roles other than sales or distribution; 10 surgeons,
almost all high procedure volume KOLs ("key opinion leaders") in AXGN's market; two
lawyers that specialize in medtech/pharma/biotech intellectual property and FDA
regulations; other industry experts such as an insurer, reimbursement consultant, and a
tissue bank executive; and conducted an intensive review of public filings, transcripts,
and medical journals.


We note that all former employees were at least 6 months removed from the company,
per best practice research and compliance guidelines, and that all experts agreed not to
provide any information which is inconsistent with any non-disclosure, confidentiality, or
other agreements or understandings. We masked their names to respect their privacy.


1. We researched each of the key claims underpinning the bull case and conclude
that they lack credibility.


That AXGN’s total addressable market is $2.2B, which the company raised to a
$2.7B TAM as of the analyst day on Nov. 19, 2018.


That the company is in the early innings of penetrating its target market, with
growth projected at 35%-40%/year by sell-side analysts, growing from $78MM LTM
to $154MM by 2020 and $258MM by 2022.


That the company will expand usage of its products beyond its core market in
extremity trauma into large, new indications – namely breast neurotization and
oral/maxillofacial surgery – and scale new products such as Avive umbilical cord
tissue.


That the company has no meaningful competition, as Avance is the only cadaver-
sourced nerve strip sold in the US market.


That the company has a unique intellectual property position, with patent protection
through 2023 followed by 12 additional years of exclusivity through “Biosimilar
Protection.”

2. We began by investigating AXGN’s origins, as well as the high-risk cadaver
tissue space in which it operates.


We are troubled by the company’s history as an OTC Bulletin Board stock and its
origin as a reverse merger with a failing microcap company called LecTec.


Reverse mergers have a dubious track record in the US public markets, as
evidenced by the Chinese reverse-merger wave earlier this decade, and have been
highlighted by the SEC as a category where investors should exercise caution.


AxoGen was co-founded by Jamie Grooms, who was Chairman of the Board of
AXGN until May 2018, served as CEO from 2002 to 2010, and continues as a
board member.


Previously, Grooms was the founding CEO of Regeneration Technologies, now
known as RTI Surgical (RTIX), which similar to AXGN sells products made from
processed cadaver parts.


We are alarmed by Regeneration/RTI’s history, as documented in various
investigations and books about criminality and abuses in the cadaver tissue
space. These reports detail RTI’s relationship with a “human tissue trafficking ring”
as well as other disturbing practices. We spoke with a former employee of RTI, who
alleged that multiple employees resigned due to discomfort with “cherrypicking” of
clinical data, and that one was let go after “refusing to sign off on data that he felt
was fraudulent.”


We note that AXGN and RTI are located a short walk from each other in the same
Florida office park; that in 2014, AXGN hired a CFO with links to RTI; and that a
LinkedIn search indicates that 18 current employees of AXGN worked at RTI.


AXGN has only two plausible public comps in the cadaver tissue space: RTI and
MiMedx (MDXG). RTI is a $4 stock with a $250MM market cap trading at 1.3x
sales, while MDXG is a $1.60 stock with a $178mm market cap, down 90% from its
peak this year after being delisted in Nov. 2018, following allegations of fraud by a
number of research firms.


Given AXGN’s 12x revenue multiple, we believe these stocks are the canary
in the coal mine for AXGN investors and an indication of the troubled, high
risk space in which it operates.

8/8/22, 10:19 PM AxoGen _ An Overhyped, Cash-Burning Reverse Merger At 12x Revenue, $5.07 Target Price/82% Downside (NASDAQ _ AXGN)…

3. AXGN’s total addressable market size, the heart of the bull case, is wildly
overhyped and negligible – explaining the mystery of the company’s trivial
revenues 11 years after product introduction.


Until recently, AXGN promoted a $2.2B TAM, with its core extremity trauma market
comprising $1.5B. On its recent investor day, the CEO “beat-and-raised” this
estimate to $2.7B total, with extremity trauma driving most of the raise and now at
$1.9B.


To support an extremity trauma market size of $1.5-1.9B, the company states there
are 719,000 peripheral nerve injuries annually, and footnotes an “epidemiological”
study it says is from 2008. The entire bull case on AXGN appears to rest on the
massive market size imputed from the purported statistic in this paper.


We located this paper, and note that it was actually published in 1998, not 2008;
that it covered one regional trauma center; that this trauma center is actually in
Canada; that the paper makes no mention of 719K peripheral nerve injuries,
nor does it provide support for such a claim; and that the paper’s conclusion is the
exact opposite: that peripheral nerve injuries are rare even in trauma cases.


We conducted our own market sizing analysis, using the three credible studies in
the medical literature on the prevalence of peripheral nerve injuries. Our analysis of
the data indicates that a mere 1.6% of all trauma patients have peripheral nerve
injuries, implying 28K such injuries vs. the company’s claim of 719K – a 96%
difference.


We conclude that the actual market size for AXGN’s core Avance nerve graft in
extremity trauma – its primary market – is only $52MM – or 3% of the recently
“upsized” TAM.


We spoke with 11 former sales reps, area managers, and other employees, who
describe widespread skepticism within the company of its promoted market size,
calling the stated figures “comical,” “flawed,” and “misleading.”


We spoke with eleven surgeons, almost all long time customers of AXGN and key
opinion leaders (“KOLs) in the space, who corroborated feedback from former
employees and indicate that AXGN’s core market is miniscule.
8/8/22, 10:19 PM AxoGen _ An Overhyped, Cash-Burning Reverse Merger At 12x Revenue, $5.07 Target Price/82% Downside (NASDAQ _ AXGN)…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4228960-axogen-overhyped-cash-burning-reverse-merger-12x-revenue-5_07-target-price-82-percent?source=all_art… 6/14


4. Contrary to the CEO’s claims that the company is at early stages of adoption in
its core market, former sales reps as well as surgeons consistently indicate that
AXGN is close to saturated and is at a “tipping point,” with new accounts and
growth increasingly difficult to find.


Our sources indicate that 90% of addressable surgeons are familiar with the
product and that 70-80% of them use it, in contrast to the CEO's recent claims that
penetration is “at something in the 15 to 16% range.”


Former reps and distributors indicate that new customer acquisition is falling
and that AXGN is rapidly running out of growth options. One stated that his
territory reached saturation in the past year and is now mature.


Even AXGN’s most enthusiastic and highest volume surgeons provided
unequivocal feedback that is sharply at odds with the CEO’s claims on early
penetration, and echoed concerns around market saturation and growth.


Our interviews indicate that even among AXGN’s highest volume surgeons – ones
that comprise the bulk of procedure volumes in the market – AXGN is used
infrequently, and that their usage of its products, already low as a percentage
of their total procedures, is maxed out.


We conclude that surgeons open to AXGN already began using it 5-10 years ago,
and that those who don’t are unlikely to do so.


5. The company’s claims about driving growth via new, expanded use cases lack
credibility.


AXGN promotes a $250mm market opportunity to use cadaver nerves in breast
neurotization. Women who undergo breast reconstruction after mastectomy
typically lose sensation. AXGN is now trying to convince reconstructive surgeons to
use cadaver nerves to “neurotize” the breast to restore some measure of nerve
function.


We analyzed the most accurate data available, from the American Society of
Plastic Surgeons, which leads us to an addressable market size of only $16MM –
6% of the company’s figure.


Former sales reps and executives express deep skepticism that breast
neurotization is a material opportunity, citing a trivial market size, lack of interest

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4228960-axogen-overhyped-cash-burning-reverse-merger-12x-revenue-5_07-target-price-82-percent?source=all_art… 7/14


or outright resistance from surgeons, a dearth of clinical data, and rejection
from hospitals due to pricing and reimbursement problems.


The skepticism was shared by AXGN’s own surgeon customers, even its own early
adopters in breast neurotization. We note that these surgeons may be biased in
favor the company as they are some of AXGN’s highest volume KOL’s and in some
cases receive payments from the company.


Former employees were equally dismissive of the market opportunity for cadaver
nerves in oral and maxillofacial surgery. We note that far from being an exciting,
new indication, AXGN has been talking up the “opportunity” in oral/maxillofacial
since at least 2012, stating then that it was already expanding into this market, yet
we have seen no evidence of traction.


We believe that investors may be unaware of the regulatory risks of “off-label”
or “gray area” usage in breast reconstruction and other add-on markets the
company is promoting.


Aside from new indications, AxoGen promotes the opportunity in its Avive product,
which competes with MiMedx and is also made from human umbilical tissue.
Former employees dismiss the product as a commodity with little potential, while
some of AXGN’s largest surgeon accounts express alarm at the clinical data
and AXGN’s sales practices in pushing the product.


6. We believe that AXGN’s growth has driven by unsustainable, aggressive price
increases, which have led to widespread customer alienation and the potential for
mass defections as competition ramps. We also note the general lack of
reimbursement, another driver of its limited commercial potential. Experts
indicate that even BLA approval would not meaningfully alter AXGN’s
reimbursement profile, given how in-patient hospital benefits and bundled
payments work.


AXGN’s prices are unusually high, with 7cm nerve strips selling for over $6,000.
Former reps indicate that prices have doubled in just a few years, while volumes
have lagged, and that pricing for some SKUs has jumped 40% in a year. (Source:
interviews with former reps)


Former reps and distributors point to widespread “anger” and “disdain” toward
the company, leading to cancelled accounts and accelerating defections.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4228960-axogen-overhyped-cash-burning-reverse-merger-12x-revenue-5_07-target-price-82-percent?source=all_art… 8/14


One of AXGN’s largest surgeon accounts indicated to us that his hospital is
pressuring him to try a competitor.


Most ominously, ex-employees indicated their belief that the company’s aggressive
pricing has created so much alienation that customers will defect en masse with
a “race to the bottom” in pricing as competitors begin to sell on cost.


We explore price sensitivity in the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) channel in
depth, as former employees describe it as a critical threat to AXGN’’s business, as
well as why AXGN’s reimbursement challenges are unlikely to change.


7. Although AXGN is currently the only company in the US selling cadaver nerve
strips, former employees as well as surgeons indicate a number of looming
competitive threats.


While AXGN enthusiasts point to the lack of a competing cadaver nerve product to
date as validation, we believe it indicates that the market is simply too small to
bother, a view shared by AXGN’s own surgeons. If it was as large as AXGN
claims, we believe it would have been flooded with competitors a decade ago. We
believe the company has no way to win: either the market is negligible, and if it’s
not, it will be a race to the bottom in pricing – a sobering fact as AXGN’s
current 85% gross margins imply massive room for competitors to slash
prices.


Despite the lack of an Avance competitor to date, our calls with former employees
indicate elevated fear within the company, especially about Integra ((IART), $4B
market cap), while others pointed to Baxter ((BAX), $34B market cap). (Example:
Integra's nerve repair portfolio)


Several former reps and distributors believe that identical cadaver grafts are
coming in 2019, with a former sales rep indicating that a surgeon who used to
purchase from AXGN is working on a competitor, and another stating that he’s
spoken with two other entrants that are “actively, aggressively pursuing” cadaver
allograft.


Three other former employees expressed concern about the competitive threat
from 3D nerve printing and synthetic grafts.

8/8/22, 10:19 PM AxoGen _ An Overhyped, Cash-Burning Reverse Merger At 12x Revenue, $5.07 Target Price/82% Downside (NASDAQ _ AXGN)…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4228960-axogen-overhyped-cash-burning-reverse-merger-12x-revenue-5_07-target-price-82-percent?source=all_art… 9/14


Surgeons corroborated these competitive threats, especially Baxter, and
highlighted others, stating that AXGN’s product was easy to replicate and that
“anyone can do this.” They further indicated that for short gap nerve injuries,
which comprise the vast majority of peripheral nerve injuries, virtually any
alternative to nerve allograft works fine, such as conduits or inexpensive,
commodity connectors.


We believe investors are unaware of the most significant potential risk to
AXGN’s viability: competition from a low-cost Chinese entrant which states
that it has already replicated AXGN’s core product, and which already has the
equivalent of FDA approval in China, while AxoGen operates under a high-risk
regulatory status with no FDA approval much less a completed clinical trial or BLA
submission.


8. Despite launching its cadaver nerve product in 2007, AXGN has yet to even
finish enrolling a clinical trial or submit a BLA. The company operates under a
murky, high-risk FDA status in the interim, under which its products can be pulled
from the market at any time at the FDA’s discretion.


AXGN initially attempted to launch its Avance graft as a Section 361 HCT/P tissue
product, which bypass requirements for a trial. However, in 2010, the FDA
determined that it was a biologic which requires a Phase 3 clinical trial and a
Biologics Licensing Application.


The FDA is currently exercising “enforcement discretion” and allowing the company
to distribute its products as it transitions to a trial and BLA, assuming it follows
various conditions. AXGN’s filings imply that if “BLA submission is neither timely nor
adequate” the FDA may forbid sale of its products.


Given the requirement for “timely” BLA submission, we note that AXGN’s RECON
clinical trial keeps getting delayed. The study requires a mere 150 patients and
began enrolling over three years ago, yet has still failed to complete
enrollment. ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that the study’s page hasn’t even been
updated in almost 3 years.


The latest date provided by the company “anticipate[s]” completing trial enrollment
by end of 2018, with other comments indicating that a BLA would be submitted “in
late 2020, early 2021.”
8/8/22, 10:19 PM AxoGen _ An Overhyped, Cash-Burning Reverse Merger At 12x Revenue, $5.07 Target Price/82% Downside (NASDAQ _ AXGN)…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4228960-axogen-overhyped-cash-burning-reverse-merger-12x-revenue-5_07-target-price-82-percent?source=all_a… 10/14


In our experience analyzing trials, delays in patient enrollment are one of the
earliest and riskiest warning signs for investors. We discussed with a key KOL
surgeon our concern that AXGN may be seeing something in its current registry
data that it doesn’t want expressed in a completed clinical trial, and he specified
why this concern is valid.


We have never heard of a company launching a product in 2007, and then planning
to take 13 or 14 years to submit a BLA, assuming it even meets its current timeline.
We note that if the company submits a BLA by 2021, that would be 11 years after
the FDA determined that it was a biologic requiring a clinical trial and BLA – which
strikes us as neither “timely” nor compliant with the FDA’s transition plan.


Further straining credibility, AXGN’s filings state that its Avance graft has patent
protection through September 2023, indicating that its core product is close to the
end of its lifecycle. We have never heard of company waiting two years before
its patents expire to finally submit a BLA, with approval potentially coming
AFTER it has no patent protection.


Ominously for AXGN, the surgeons we queried for feedback on AXGN’s ongoing
trial delays provided reasons that cast further doubt on the company’s commercial
potential: surgeon apathy in participating in the trial, patient resistance, and a
negligible patient population. One expressed skepticism that AXGN's trial
would even enroll this year, implying yet further delays.


9. We note sharply elevated payments from AXGN to physicians, relative to its
revenue, as disclosed in the Sunshine Act’s Open Payments database, creating
elevated risks relating to pay-to-play and anti-kickback laws.


2017 data show $1.6MM in payments, or 2.6% of 2016 revenue. Since 2013, the
database implies that AXGN has spent approximately 2-4% of its annual revenues
on physician payments, a level far in excess of firms we benchmark.


We find this troubling, as we have observed other medtech and pharma/biotech
companies become the targets of legal/regulatory action based on allegations of
violating anti-kickback laws. We make no such allegation toward AXGN, and simply
note what we consider to be an elevated level of payments.


However, former sales reps indicated that surgeons receiving payments from
AXGN are critically important to the company’s revenues, and pointed to several

red flags which we feel are important for investors to note.


10. AXGN’s perceived intellectual property position is a key element of the bull
case. However, our analysis of the company’s patents and regulatory status leads
us to conclude that its IP is among the weakest we have seen.


We first note that an estimated 50% of AXGN’s revenues come from being a third-
party distributor for the Axoguard line, in which it holds no IP, and for which the
patents have already expired.


The level of R&D investment required to originally develop the nerve graft
“technology” it licenses appears trivial, which we believe to be a crucial indicator of
the strength and value of a company’s underlying IP.


An AXGN filing states that its license agreement with the University of Florida
requires a mere $2,000 milestone fee if AXGN receives FDA approval for its
Avance graft. This is the smallest milestone payment we have ever seen, and is yet
another gauge of the value of the underlying science. (Source: AXGN 2017 10K
p.87)


The company’s R&D expenses have historically been negligible, providing a further
measure of the simple nature of its offering and its minimal replacement value.


We examine each of the four key claims that underpin the IP case on AXGN: i)
protection afforded by its core Avance patents, which expire in 2023; ii) supposed
exclusivity for another 12 years after these patents expire, until 2035; iii) the “entry
barrier” provided by its FDA transition plan and the presumed need for an entrant to
spend “8 years” on trials; and iv) “trade secrets” for the cleaning and processing of
cadaver nerves. (AXGN patent filing)


In conjunction with a patent analysis, we spoke with two lawyers with extensive
experience in FDA matters and expertise in medtech/pharma IP. This research
leads us to conclude that each of the four claims is lacking in credibility, and
that the company has no meaningful IP protection and cannot prevent a
copycat from entering the market today and starting a race to the bottom in
pricing.


In addition, our patent review uncovered a key risk for AXGN’s clinical trial, relating
to the use of a now-discontinued brand of detergent for washing nerves. We

believe the FDA could force AXGN to restart its BLA efforts from scratch with the
replacement chemical, given the strict requirement for in-process controls and
leading to even further BLA delays.


11. Our research points to a long list of red flags concerning the company’s
culture, accounting, and controls.


The vast majority of former employees we spoke with described a culture of fear
within the salesforce, resulting in what they described as instability in the field,
rampant turnover, and low morale.


In our experience with medtech companies, salesforce instability is a key warning
sign before growth rates hit a wall.


Former employees describe a culture focused on promoting the stock, with one
saying that company has a short term mentality “to torch this market as fast as
possible and get out.”


The feedback provided is consistent with anonymous employee posts on
CafePharma, a site we’ve found valuable as a check on what is occurring inside a
company. This is the first time we have seen 19 pages of negative posts about one
employer.


A number of former employees allege channel stuffing, given that the company’s
consignment model creates potential for abuse, as well as alleging questionable
revenue recognition practices.


The allegations additionally include misleading operating metrics, with one
former rep implying that the company’s definition of “active accounts” may overstate
the actual number by a factor of ten.


We are also troubled by the company’s longtime use of a relatively small auditor
with what we consider to be a local/regional profile. AXGN switched to a large firm
earlier this year, perhaps to establish credibility for its equity raise. The previous
auditor had audited AXGN since 2011, and LecTec – AXGN’s troubled reverse
merger partner – since 2004, according to Capital IQ. A Capital IQ search shows
only two current publicly traded clients of this firm, both OTC Pink Market
companies, one with $100K market cap and one with $5MM. (Source: AXGN 2017

12. Our valuation analysis leads us to believe that AXGN is worth $5.07/share, an
82% decline from its recent close of $27.53.


We believe that AXGN has only two appropriate public comps, both in the
cadaver/umbilical tissue space: RTI Surgical and MiMedx


RTIX trades at an EV/revenue multiple of 1.3x, and has often traded below 1x, with
a $4 stock and $250MM market cap on LTM revenue of $281MM. MDXG trades at
an EV/revenue multiple of 0.5x, with a $1.60 stock and $178MM market cap on
LTM revenues of $304MM. We note how remarkably similar RTIX and MDXG are in
terms of revenues and market cap, and the low revenue multiples for each.


Yet remarkably, AXGN currently trades at a 12x EV/revenue multiple with a $1.1B
market cap. We note that although AXGN has shown growth, albeit on a small
base with growth rates at high risk, several other factors are critical inputs.


First, we estimate that half of AXGN’s revenues come from its Axoguard line
of connectors and wraps, a commodity, me-too product that it doesn’t even own
and for which it is merely a third-party distributor. We do not believe investors
appreciate this fact, as AXGN trades at a lofty multiple worthy of an innovative
biotech with powerful IP vs. a pedestrian distributor.

Second, AXGN is a money-losing company with poor economics: -21% LTM
EBIT margin, -25% LTM net income margin, and massively negative operating and
free cash flows.


Third, AXGN has binary risk of losing the ability to market its flagship
product, as the FDA can rescind its ability to market the product at any time, and
even if the company submits a BLA, its BLA may be rejected.


Applying the average multiple of RTIX and MDXG yields a $5.07 target price. Even
if we apply RTIX’s multiple of 1.3x revenue, given MDXG’s recent delisting, and if
we assume that the company is successful in forcing additional price increases and
meets it 2019 consensus estimate of $115MM sales, that yields only a $150MM
enterprise value. If we add back an estimated $100MM cash remaining at that time,
we arrive at a $250MM market cap – roughly similar to RTIX and MDXG’s
valuations today - or again close to $5/share.
