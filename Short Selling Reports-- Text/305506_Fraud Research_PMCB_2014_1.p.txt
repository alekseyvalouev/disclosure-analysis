Nuvilex:	Paid	Promotion	Marijuana	Bubble	Set	To	Burst
Feb.	28,	2014	11:07	AM	ET192	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


(Editorâ€™s	Note:	This	article	covers	stocks	trading	at	less	than	$1	per	share	and/or	with	less
than	a	$100	million	market	cap.	Please	be	aware	of	the	risks	associated	with	these
stocks.)


Nuvilex,	Inc.	(NVLX)	is	a	biotech	company	fueled	almost	entirely	by	a	marijuana	mania
that	pales	in	comparison	to	the	irrational	and	excessive	price	fluctuations	we	discussed	in
Feb.	2013.	We	began	our	previous	article	with	a	quote	from	Benjamin	Graham	that
applies	today,	more	than	ever,	not	just	to	Nuvilex	but	also	to	the	irrational	movements
made	by	other	weed	stocks,	including	mCig,	Inc.	(OTCPK:MCIG),	Growlife,	Inc.
(OTCQB:PHOT)	and	Fusion	Pharm,	Inc.	(OTC:FSPM):


Influential	economist	Benjamin	Graham	once	said,	"Most	of	the	time	common	stocks
are	subject	to	irrational	and	excessive	price	fluctuations	in	both	directions	as	the
consequence	of	the	ingrained	tendency	of	most	people	to	speculate	or	gamble	...	to
give	way	to	hope,	fear	and	greed."


The	difference	this	time	around	is	that	Nuvilex	has	been	a	recent	subject	to	a	vast	number
of	stock	promotional	campaigns.	The	promotional	activities	are	so	intertwined	in	Nuvilex
that	Tim	Matula,	currently	on	the	Board	of	Directors	at	Nuvilex,	was	previously	employed
by	VelaTel	Global	Communications,	Inc.	(OTC:VELA),	and	according	to	his	LinkedIn
profile,	he	had	a	number	of	responsibilities,	including	"hiring	third	party	investor	relations
and	public	relations	firms."

Mr.	Matula	is	also	currently	the	senior	vice	president	of	Global	Strategy	for	LiveDeal,	Inc.
(NASDAQ:LIVE),	which	was	highlighted	in	a	recent	Seeking	Alpha	article	for	being	a
promoted	stock.


Before	we	get	into	the	fundamentals	of	the	company,	we	felt	it	was	important	to	educate
investors	about	the	severe	risks	of	owning	shares	in	promoted	stocks	like	Nuvilex.	We
touched	on	this	subject	in	a	past	report,	and	to	no	surprise,	the	stock	fell	by	97%	since
then.


Whenever	an	unrelated	third	party	shareholder	foots	a	big	cash	budget	to	kick-off	an
investor	awareness	campaign,	it	should	be	an	ongoing	concern	in	the	minds	of
investors.


About	The	Company


Nuvilex,	Inc.	holds	rights	to	use	a	technology	referred	to	as	Cell-in-a-Box	for	the	treatment
of	cancers	and	diabetes.	The	Cell-in-a-Box	technology	was	developed	by	Austrianova,	a
private	company	with	a	14.5%	ownership	stake	by	Nuvilex.	Rather,	in	2013,	Nuvilex
acquired	exclusive	worldwide	and	patented	rights	to	use	the	technology.


The	Company	also	has	plans	to	use	the	Cell-in-a-Box	technology	to	deliver	cancer-fighting
agents	based	on	cannabinoids.	On	Feb.	12,	2013,	Nuvilex	incorporated	Medical	Marijuana
Sciences,	Inc.	to	act	as	a	wholly-owned	subsidiary	for	its	proposed	Cell-in-a-Box	use	as	a
treatment	to	life-threatening	diseases	using	cannabinoids.

Company	Financials


The	Company	generated	zero	revenues	for	the	six	months	ending	Oct.	31,	2013.	The
latest	quarterly	report	also	discloses	a	net	loss	exceeding	$10	million	and	a	$50	million
accumulated	deficit.	Assets	on	the	balance	sheet	consisted	of	an	investment	in	SG	Austria
valued	at	$2,549,427,	along	with	$396,594	cash.	While	this	cash	position	may	seem
insufficient	to	cover	ongoing	net	losses,	the	Company	recently	entered	into	a	$27	million
financing,	which	we	will	outline	in	a	later	section.


The	number	of	shares	outstanding	increased	by	22%	during	the	six-month	period	between
April	30,	2013	and	Oct.	31,	2013,	and	share	issuances	consisted	of	the	following:


Balance,	April	30,	2013 482,106,348


Shares	issued	for	compensation 12,270,000


Shares	issued	for	services 960,000


Shares	issued	for	settlement	of	debt 26,075,000


Shares	issued	for	cash 13,000,000


Conversion	of	preferred	to	common	stock 54,000,000


Balance,	Oct.	31,	2013 588,411,348


Share	Dilution


Nuvilex's	share	dilution	will	likely	continue	to	increase	based	on	a	Feb.	14,	2014	purchase
agreement,	whereby	the	Company	has	the	right	to	sell	Lincoln	Park	Capital	Fund,	LLC	up
to	$27,000,000	in	shares	of	its	common	stock.	To	date,	8	million	shares	have	been	issued
to	Lincoln	for	proceeds	of	$2	million.	This	represents	a	roughly	50%	discount	to	current
market	prices.	The	purchase	price	of	shares	in	the	future	will	generally	be	based	upon	the
prevailing	market	prices,	subject	to	a	discount	to	market	in	certain	circumstances.


Press	Releases	Filled	With	Fluff


The	Company	and	affiliates	of	the	Company	issued	a	total	of	ten	press	releases	during
Feb.	2014:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2058573-nuvilex-paid-promotion-marijuana-bubble-set-to-burst 4/10


Fluffy	press	releases	are	nothing	uncommon	for	promoted	penny	stocks.	To	no	surprise,
Nuvilex	repeatedly	mentions	marijuana	in	the	headline	to	garner	investor	interest,	even	if
the	press	release	contains	no	material	information	about	Nuvilex's	business.	The	icing	on
the	cake	for	Nuvilex	was	the	Feb.	2,	2014	press	release	alluding	to	the	National	Football
League,	not	coincidentally	just	several	days	after	the	Super	Bowl.


The	disturbing	part	about	these	press	releases	is	that	several	of	them	appear	to	be	written
by	Stock	Market	Media	Group	("SMMG")	and	lack	the	necessary	compensation	disclosure
according	to	Section	17(b)	of	the	Securities	Act	of	1933.	According	to	Section	17(b),
SMMG	would	be	required	to	disclose	payment	within	each	of	the	above	press	releases
written.

Tim	Matula's	Public	Company	Track	Record


Nuvilex	is	not	the	first	promoted	stock	that	Board	of	Directors	member	Tim	Matula	has
been	affiliated	with.	In	fact,	he	was	previously	on	the	Board	of	Directors	for	another
purported	medical	marijuana	company,	Plandai	Biotechnology,	Inc.	(OTCPK:PLPL).	On	a
side	note,	PLPL	also	employed	Stock	Market	Media	Group	to	perform	investor	relations
work.


We	mention	PLPL	first	because	it	is	also	part	of	the	marijuana	bubble.	The	stock	climbed
from	under	$0.20	to	more	than	$3,	before	retracing	by	50%.	We	believe	NVLX	will
experience	a	similar	50%	drop	once	the	marijuana	bubble	pops.

Tim	Matula	also	acts	as	the	senior	vice	president	of	Global	Strategy	for	LiveDeal,	Inc.,
another	actively	promoted	stock	that	SMMG	was	paid	to	promote.	So	far,	the	stock	has
fallen	40%	from	its	highs,	but	some	believe	it	will	continue	to	fall.

Tim	Matula's	career	in	the	public	company	arena	also	includes	VelaTel	Global
Communications,	Incorporated.	As	Director	of	Corporate	Communications,	Mr.	Matula	was
responsible	for	a	number	of	tasks	that	appear	to	be	either	directly	or	indirectly	related	to
public	and	investor	relations.	One	could	reasonably	argue	that	his	corporate
communications	efforts	failed	miserably,	since	the	stock	declined	by	97%	during	his
tenure.


With	the	exception	of	VELA,	all	of	the	public	companies	above	have	the	following
similarities:


Affiliation	with	Tim	Matula;
Retention	of	Stock	Market	Media	Group	("SMMG");
40%-50%	retracement	in	stock	price	after	a	price	spike.


It	is	our	opinion	that	Nuvilex,	Inc.	will	join	this	list	of	public	companies	once	it	drops	by
40%-50%	in	share	price.


Nuvilex:	A	Heavily	Promoted	Penny	Stock
7/18/2019 Nuvilex: Paid Promotion Marijuana Bubble Set To Burst - PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. (OTCMKTS:PMCB) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2058573-nuvilex-paid-promotion-marijuana-bubble-set-to-burst 8/10


Given	that	the	company	had	zero	revenues,	more	than	$50	million	accumulated	deficits
and	a	history	of	stock	dilution,	it	seems	there	is	not	much	of	a	bullish	case	for	Nuvilex.
Despite	its	history	of	losses,	NVLX	has	been	one	of	the	most	actively	promoted	stocks
during	the	past	several	months.


In	our	opinion,	all	marijuana	stocks	will	fall	back	to	their	intrinsic	values	once	the
legislation	hype	dies	down.	However,	it	will	be	the	promoted	marijuana	stocks	like	NVLX
that	likely	will	fall	the	farthest.	When	a	stock	is	promoted,	a	third	party	is	paying	cash	to
advertisers	in	hopes	of	unloading	shares	that	were	received	at	fractions	of	a	penny.	While
there	may	be	some	inflated	marijuana	companies	whose	executives	have	good	intentions,
our	experience	suggests	the	shysters	in	the	murky	OTC	markets	surround	themselves
with	promoted	stocks.


Between	Jan.	15-Feb.	27,	2014	we	received	well	over	100	promotional	emails	touting
NVLX.	Many	of	them	have	legal	disclaimers,	such	as	this	one:


The	legal	disclaimer	above	discloses	$15,000	payment	by	Cream	Consulting,	allegedly	a
non-controlling	third	party	for	NVLX.


In	a	previous	section,	we	highlighted	the	similarities	between	Nuvilex	and	two	promoted
stocks	that	have	fallen	40	percent	and	50	percent	from	their	respective	highs.
Interestingly,	Cream	Consulting	is	the	same	non-controlling	third	party	that	is	paying	stock
promoters	to	tout	these	two	related	companies,	LIVE	and	PLPL.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2058573-nuvilex-paid-promotion-marijuana-bubble-set-to-burst 9/10


On	Feb.	26,	2014,	a	Nuvilex	press	release	issued	by	BrokerBank	Securities,	Inc.	alluded
to	a	comprehensive	research	report	on	NVLX	written	by	chartered	financial	analyst
Osman	Ghani.	This	report	contained	a	bullish	case	for	the	company	and	presented	a	lofty
price	target,	but	the	report	is	completely	biased	because	Ghani	was	paid	to	write	it.


Business	Losing	Money,	Stock	Up	on	Hype


The	legalization	of	recreational	and	medicinal	marijuana	is	one	of	the	most	widely
discussed	topics	of	2014,	and	investors	are	looking	to	cash	in	on	the	green	rush.
Unfortunately,	to	date,	an	overwhelming	majority	of	marijuana	stocks	are	small	businesses
that	are	losing	money	and	are	fueled	solely	by	hype.	FINRA	recently	warned	the	investing
public	about	marijuana	stock	scams,	and	as	a	follow-up	to	our	Feb.	2013	report,	we
wanted	to	expose	what	we	believe	will	be	the	next	inflated	marijuana	stock	to	burst.


We	can	find	no	material	events	that	have	altered	the	intrinsic	value	of	Nuvilex,	Inc.	shares
during	the	past	several	months,	with	the	exception	of	a	dilutive	financing	and	possibly	the
14.5-percent	acquisition	in	Austrianova	--	although	it	is	unknown	whether	this	acquisition
will	benefit	shareholders.


Our	investigation	has	led	to	the	conclusion	that	shares	of	NVLX	common	stock	are	grossly
overvalued	and	have	been	fueled	by	little	more	than	hype	and	paid	stock	promotion.	We
have	identified	major	red	flags	with	Cream	Consulting,	Tim	Matula	and	their	connections
to	promoted	stocks	LIVE	and	PLPL.


After	the	publication	of	our	last	report	on	a	promoted	stock,	that	stock	declined	by	more
than	50	percent	in	less	than	two	trading	days.	We	urge	you	to	consider	selling	NVLX
before	this	stock	promotion	bubble	inevitably	bursts.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	NVLX.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own
opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have
no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.

Long	PennyStocks
I	deeply	disagree	with	several	of	your	comments.	I	am	in	the	car	right	now	and	I	had	to	stop	to	at	least	respond	to	a
few	of	your	weakest	points.	A)	the	fact	that	the	stock	has	no	revenues,	accumulated	deficit	and	several	millions	share
outstanding	does	nothing	but	reflect	the	nature	of	the	company.	95%	of	biotech	stocks	in	early	stages	have	the	exact
same	P&L.	B)	the	millions	of	shares	Management	own	and	continue	to	issue	and	distribute	themselves	relates	back	to
point	A).	The	model	is	based	on	heavy	R&D	spending	and	not	in	paying	big	salaries	to	executives	in	cash	when	that's
the	typically	most	scarce	resource.	C)	The	hype	on	the	stock	comes	from	an	innovative	way	of	"packing	and
delivering"	therapy	to	damaged	tissues	and	cells	(ie,	insuline-producing	cells	delivered	to	a	damaged	pancreas,	etc).
They	are	investigating	CBD-based	therapies	to	treat	pain	in	cancer	patients.	If	proven	effective,	this	technology	can	be
licensed	to	any	company	looking	to	compete	in	the	targeted	therapies	space.	D)	I	doubt	Lincoln	Park	Capital,	a	group
of	savvy	biotech	investors	with	heavy	financial	backing,	will	commit	their	money	and	name	to	back	up	a	company	with
no	potential	whatsoever,	as	you	are	trying	to	imply	here.	E)	I	said	it	before	and	here	it	goes	again,	intrinsic	value	is	not
the	right	way	of	valuing	stocks	in	this	still	fully	unexplored	and	understood	sector.	Just	to	finish,	I	don't	see	the
deregulation	hype	ending	anytime	soon,	as	you	so	implied.	There	are	still	more	states	to	accept	MJ	for	medical	and
recreational	use,	than	those	who	have	already	done	so.	There	will	be	plenty	of	"deregulation	hype"	for	the	next	5-10
years.


Good	luck.
