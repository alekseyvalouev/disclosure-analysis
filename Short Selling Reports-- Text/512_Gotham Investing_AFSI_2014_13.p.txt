AFSI's Life
Settlements:
Drastically Over-
Stated & Two
Write-Down
Catalysts Coming
Nov. 12, 2014 3:07 PM ET | Includes: AmTrust Financial Ser…


A sell-side analyst criticized my analysis of AFSI's life settlement contract
investments and the comparison to Imperial Holdings (NYSE:IFT) calling it
"disingenuous" since some of IFT's policies were acquired via premium finance.
I heartily disagree because one can simply use the discount rate IFT applies to
non-premium-financed policies.


Let me make it simple for him though...in what investment does the number of
policies purchased (or converted) determine the magnitude of gains?


“ Net Gain on Investment in Life Settlement Contracts. Gain on investmentin life settlement contracts was $13.8 million compared to $46.9 million
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The gain in the year
ended December 31, 2011 was generated by the purchase of a large pool
of distressed life settlement contracts in 2011 and the conversion of
premium finance loans acquired in 2010 into life settlement contracts in
2011. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we purchased or
converted fewer contracts. (ed: resulting in fewer gains)

Answer: One in which a company does not use market assumptions.

However, sell-siders have taken the AFSI bait, hook line and sinker and fallen
for what I believe are highly misleading commentary from AFSI despite the
10-Q quietly revealing the truth:


“ Effective Discount Rate ("EDR") is the Company's estimated internal rateof return on its life settlement contract portfolio and is determined from
the gross expected cash flows and valuation of the portfolio. The
valuation of the portfolio is calculated net of all reserves using a 7.5%
discount rate.

National General Holdings (NASDAQ:NGHC)'s 10-Q was filed today though,
and data provided in it confirm my view.


Consider the results of each of AFSI/NGHC's LSC entities:


It is no coincidence that AMTCH II is the most profitable entity...it's also the
newest and therefore making purchases. Only if a market participant does not
use market assumptions can they consistently generate gains upon purchase
as AFSI has with each of its new LSC entities.


Second, the below analysis reveals AFSI's discount rate is approximately 7.9%
(ie: much closer to 7.5%):


Therefore, AFSI needs to take a write-down that I estimate is at least $117.4
million -- a crippling amount given the lack of capital discussed in my prior
articles.

Importantly, a catalyst is on the horizon for AFSI's write-down of LSC -- a new
auditor (per NYDFS conditions).


Furthermore, a new VBT table will be introduced in 2015, likely further hurting
AFSI's LSC investments.


With respect to the comparison to IFT, I believe KBW's analyst is the one being
disingenuous because he completely ignored the comparison of AFSI's
"reserves" and IFT's adjustments, both of which are applied BEFORE discount
rates.


After those reserves/adjustments are effected, AFSI applies 7.5% (not the
12.5-17.5% KBW claimed, or the 13.9% in AFSI's 10-Q) and IFT applies
14.8%-20.8% (for non-premium financed policies).


I intend to expand on this analysis using the filings of AFSI's AMTCH (publicly
available via gbrdirect.eu) in the coming days which show just how egregious
AFSI's valuations are.
