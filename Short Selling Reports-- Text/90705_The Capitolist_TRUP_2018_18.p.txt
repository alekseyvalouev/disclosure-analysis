TRUP


Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) slams Trupanion
territory partners with licensing requirements, forbids ever paying Veterinarians.


The release of the NAPHIA data showed that Trupanion is losing market share.
This slowdown in growth is underway before the company becomes compliant with
state regulations.


I compared Trupanion's insurance offering to four different competitors in six
different cites - Trupanion was the most expensive offering in every instance.


With prices this high it's easy to understand why Trupanion is having to spend so
much on Patient Acquisition Costs (PAC), it's likely why the acquirers have passed
on TRUP.

properly licensed and affiliated, paying commissions or

solicitation, giving pet care providers gifts valued in excess
of $100 in a 12 month period for referrals, and knowingly
accepting insurance business from unlicensed producers."
WA State OIC


The Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner issued a signed Consent
Order (below) demanding that Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) come into compliance with
State Insurance laws. Predictably the State decided that the Territory Partners needed
to be licensed, that the company could no longer use Review, LLC to generate leads
and that payments to Veterinarians would not be tolerated. The State also levied a small
fine of $100,000 - but the fine was never the point.

Why is the The Business Already Slowing?


Source: Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner


It's obvious to me that the territory partners will be required to be licensed in all 50 states
once the state insurance commissioners read the detailed order from the State of
Washington. I don't see how the company can ever pay veterinarians again and that
might explain our next section.


The North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA) has released its "State
of the Industry 2019" report in which Trupanion (TRUP) is shown to be losing market
share to competitors. In the graphic below I highlight the year-over-year market share
growth for TRUP in terms of premiums and subscriptions. A reading of 0.0 suggests that
TRUP is maintaining its market share, the negative numbers you see below show a
business that is growing slower then half of its competitors.


Source: NAPHIA "State of the Industry 2019" report


As you can see above - TRUP has traditionally been one of the fastest growing
business in the pet insurance space, consistently taking share from its competitors. But
no longer, TRUP teetered on losing share in 2017 and confirmed the slow down in 2018.
It is no longer a leading grower in the Pet Insurance business.

Test Animal:


Why might this be? I have suggested that the rate increases TRUP has been asking for
are unsustainable and potentially a harbinger of other issues (Trupanion: Is a Rate
Spiral Already Underway?). I thought that it might be helpful to check pricing of TRUP
against common competitors in six cities across the country. I decided to focus on the
most profitable type of dog - a mixed breed, 2 year old, under 50 pounds.


I created a fictitious animal to generate online quotes from Trupanion, Pets Best,
Healthy Paws, Nationwide, and Embrace.


Pet Name: "Kareem Abdul Ja-Bark"


Born: May 2017 (2 years old)


Weight: 40 pounds


Sex: Male, neutered


Source: Company Websites


As you can see the results are staggering and likely explain the loss in market share
(and potentially the increase in PAC expectations). In every instance TRUP is the most
expensive option for the consumer. I tried population weighting to attempt to make
TRUP look better in high population MSA's and it made them look worse.


Pets Best Discount: Avg = -28%; Pop Weighted = -28%

A Tale of Two Companies


Healthy Paws Discount: Avg = -28%; Pop Weighted = -28%


Nationwide Discount: Avg = -18%; Pop Weighted = -24%


Embrace Discount: Avg = -29%; Pop Weighted = -34%


"Pets Best" and "Embrace" are both severely undercutting TRUP's pricing and both
have been sold for significant discounts to TRUP's valuation (See Below and Link).

Pets Best makes up a majority of the "other" business that TRUP reports (Other is a
white labeled underwriting service that management has described as a fixed 10%
margin business, basically they underwrite someone else's pet insurance business for a
significant reduction in margin profile). With a pricing disparity this significant one would
expect that "other" would be outpacing the subscription business, and it is.

If we look at the total subscription pets on a quarterly basis it's clear that the
incremental sequential additions are at its lowest rate in two years last quarter
(only adding 3.3%)

The "Other" category continues to grow at low/mid teens sequentially (13.6%
sequential growth)

Something Is Broken Here


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


If we consider the incremental adds on an absolute basis we see that "Other"
(which could be described as being someone else's business) now represents
nearly 50% of the incremental gross adds per quarter.


Source: Company SEC filings


As you can see TRUP was already ceding market share before they were forced to
become compliant with the various state regulations that the Washington State OIC
found them in violation of. They have the highest pricing in every jurisdiction I checked
and as one would expect the business line that represents the lower priced (lower
margin) underwriting business is out pacing their internal subscription business in terms
of growth.


The company trades at an impossible 10x book value, I continue to believe that the rest
of the country will follow Washington's lead in terms of licensing requirements which
could further degrade the subscription growth profile, fines and legal fees will continue to
plague the company until they become compliant nationwide.

The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

TRUP now looks like a slower growing member of the pet insurance business,
with the most expensive offering to the consumer, that trades at over a 300%
