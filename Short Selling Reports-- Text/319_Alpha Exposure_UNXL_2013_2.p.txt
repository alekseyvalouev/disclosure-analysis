Uni-Pixel: A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words
May 31, 2013 9:07 AM ET303 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


About two weeks ago, we wrote an article questioning why Kodak never filed an 8-K
covering their manufacturing agreement with Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL). At the time, we
deduced that Kodak probably didn't think much of Uni-Pixel's technology. In this article, we
will explore why we believe that is and we will focus on what we believe to be the single
over-riding problem with UniBoss: product quality.


One of the most interesting things about UniBoss is that very few people have seen the
product outside of the limited presentation environment the company controls. Most
investors have just seen the demos on the company's website and a few have visited the
company. Almost nobody has actually gotten to play with the demo system and the
company has, for about a year, refused to give investors samples. We're among the few,
fortunate investors to have handled the product and viewed it under a microscope. We
also took close-up photographs of the product when the management team wasn't
looking. We can say unequivocally that the product does not work. The lines are too
visible. No consumer electronics company would approve this in a display for their
product. If it works, it'd be relegated to a niche, low-end product where optical quality
doesn't matter.


Here's a close up of it so you can see for yourself. The UniBoss sample is placed over a
white sheet of paper. We suggest you click on each photo to enlarge it in order to best see
the quality.

You thought it'd be clear and invisible, right? The metal grid pattern is clearly visible.

Here's a photo we took with a finger touching the UniBoss so you could get a sense of the
scale. The grid pattern is clearly visible.


Here's a photo of it covering an iPhone so you can see it with a backlight. The UniBoss
sheet covers the entire display, and we pulled up a white background on the phone.

Again, visible metal grid lines. Want to see a "working" demo? Here's a photo of Uni-
Pixel's newest demo unit using UniBoss. This photo was taken only a few weeks ago and
uses the same unit as the company uses in its presentations and YouTube videos on its
website.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1473211-uni-pixel-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words 5/72


There is a major problem with the demo. The sample has wide broken channels, which
you can see create large gaps in the trace. These are caused by dead spots from defects
in the UniBoss grid. If Uni-Pixel can't get a demo to work correctly, how can investors
possibly think they will be able to produce millions of units every month?


We believe that these photos alone cast enough doubt on the potential for UniBoss - both
due to its low quality and the production problems with the demo unit - that Uni-Pixel is a
compelling short. Other than with our eyes, what makes us think it doesn't work? We have
done extensive research on every part of Uni-Pixel and UniBoss. All the evidence
indicates to us that Uni-Pixel is a fraud and that UniBoss will fail.


Extensive due diligence proves UniBoss does not work


In addition to testing UniBoss ourselves, we have spoken with engineers at touch screen
companies who have tested UniBoss. They cite fundamental problems related to its
electrical properties and optical quality. They don't think that Uni-Pixel can produce
UniBoss. Even if Uni-Pixel can make UniBoss, our sources told us that it won't be
successful in the marketplace due to the visibility of the metal lines.


Our confidence is increased by conversations with former employees and industry
consultants. Key employees at Uni-Pixel have told us the company has never been able to
produce UniBoss and they are not confident that Uni-Pixel can ever successfully produce
it.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1473211-uni-pixel-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words 6/72


All the while, management keeps spinning a story that investors are eating up. However,
research into the background of the management team reveals Uni-Pixel is led by
charlatans with a history of misleading and defrauding investors out of money.


We think the end game is approaching and Uni-Pixel will again fail to deliver meaningful
revenues from UniBoss. The message is clear: short Uni-Pixel. Uni-Pixel is the most
attractive short in the market today. With a current price of $19, we have a fair value target
of below $3/share.


Engineers who have tested UniBoss say it is unacceptable


All the extensive research we've done on the UniBoss indicates it doesn't work. We spoke
with four touch engineers who have tested and evaluated UniBoss. Their findings are
consistent. They found either that the samples were unacceptable and didn't hold up
under testing, or that UniBoss did not pass visual quality tests.


We consulted with an engineer at Touch International, a leading manufacturer of specialty
touch screens, who tested the latest 6-micron version of UniBoss. He obtained and tested
a sample in 1Q 2013. The engineer found numerous problems with UniBoss and believed
the product needed substantial improvements.


First, he said the lines were visible and that consumers are unlikely to accept it. In his
judgment, the lines needed to be significantly thinner. Then he said the lines created a
Moiré effect that caused visual problems. Lastly, he said that the electrical properties of
the grid changed under high temperature and high humidity testing. This is due to the
underlying chemical properties of copper, which are difficult to overcome.


Basically, he said it failed his tests on multiple accounts, didn't work, and couldn't work.
This isn't an older version of the product. This is the latest version of the product that Uni-
Pixel is marketing today.


The engineer at Touch International is not alone in his findings. Another industry
consultant, who has a Ph.D. in Chemistry and has been in the touch industry for over 20
years, cited numerous technical problems. The most problematic feature he found was a
significant variation in resistance across one of the planes due to printing geometry or
variations in metal deposition. Essentially, the shape and thickness of the lines were
inconsistent. This resulted in huge variation in trace resistance and problems with non-
linearity.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1473211-uni-pixel-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words 7/72


We asked him to explain it to us in English. He said that means when you type "A" on your
screen, it comes out as "S." Not only that, but one part of your screen will come out as an
"S" while another part will come out as a "Z."


In essence, the touch wasn't accurate, and the inaccuracy had wide variability.


To Uni-Pixel's credit, his tests did find something positive. The consultant said the Moiré
effect was minimized in his sample, and that the product handled the Moiré effect well.
However, the consultant said the lines were too visible over certain background colors. We
asked which colors. He responded, "Black, grey, blue, green, red, and white." That's
almost every color in the rainbow.


Furthermore, he said while there were techniques Uni-Pixel and touch screen
manufacturers could utilize to minimize the visibility of the lines, the lines would always be
visible at the end.


We cut to the chase and asked him if what he found in the tests posed a problem. The
consultant said it would not be a problem as long as people didn't care that the lines were
clearly visible on the screen under most colors and didn't mind that the touch functionality
was inconsistent across the touch plane.


Good luck with that, Uni-Pixel.


Another engineer at Synaptics recently tested a 6 micron sample of UniBoss and also
noted that the lines were clearly visible. He has no axe to grind since his company is
agnostic as to who they work with. Synaptics makes controllers so they want to enable all
technologies that enable touch. In his judgment, while the visibility of the lines wasn't a
deal breaker, he thought UniBoss would be relegated to the lower end of the market due
to its optical quality. The Synaptics engineer also mentioned that UniBoss fell into a group
of competing technologies and that Uni-Pixel hadn't differentiated themselves in his mind.


Lastly, we had a conversation with an engineer at Texas Instruments who works in their
touch controller department. We spoke with him this past January. Unlike the others, he
had not tested the 6 micron sample but had tested older versions such as a 20 micron and
an 8 micron sample of UniBoss. The engineer told us Uni-Pixel had promised a newer 6
micron sample but had been unable to provide one. This surprised us since Uni-Pixel
announced a partnership with Texas Instruments back in February 2012 and touts this
partnership to investors. Nevertheless, he shared with us his evaluation of the samples.
He said the lines are much too thick and too visible for use in a consumer device, that the
samples had issues with reflection, and that the grid patterns were more visible under
5/18/2018 Uni-Pixel: A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1473211-uni-pixel-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words 8/72


certain colors. Furthermore, the engineer wasn't even sure how Uni-Pixel made the
samples since they did not have the full process in place, and he was very skeptical they
could produce it in scale.


We asked him when he thought he was going to get a 6 micron sample of UniBoss. He
told us he did not know and said it would take at least a few months. That shocked us
given the strides Uni-Pixel claims they've made and the development partnership that Uni-
Pixel has with Texas Instruments. Like the Synaptics engineer, he added that Uni-Pixel's
technology is just one of the many ITO-alternatives Texas Instruments is testing and that
Uni-Pixel isn't in the lead.


Perhaps the most shocking thing we learned happened when we called the engineer at
Texas Instruments back earlier this month. He told us that Texas Instruments has decided
to discontinue making touch controllers and that the partnership with Uni-Pixel was
therefore effectively over. That made us wonder why Uni-Pixel never told investors about
this.


That's four industry engineers who have directly tested the latest UniBoss product in the
last four months. The message from all of them is consistent; UniBoss does not work and
will not be accepted by the market for a variety of reasons.


Even former employees say Uni-Pixel cannot produce UniBoss


Along with engineers who have tested UniBoss, we spoke with two former Uni-Pixel
employees. Both had been part of Uni-Pixel's sales efforts to push UniBoss adoption in
the touch screen industry. They told us that Uni-Pixel had yet to prove the UniBoss
technology by the time they had left the company and expressed significant skepticism
about Uni-Pixel's ability to successfully produce UniBoss.


One former employee even said the demo sample Uni-Pixel trotted around to investors
and customers was actually manufactured using the subtractive, photolithographic. He
said Uni-Pixel was unable to produce UniBoss using the additive, direct printing process.
Nevertheless, Uni-Pixel used the photolithographic sample to show that the metal mesh
concept could work, but did not inform people that Uni-Pixel had not yet found a way to
manufacture it. It was all smoke and mirrors.


Another former employee also told us Uni-Pixel was unable to properly produce UniBoss.
Uni-Pixel enticed potential customers by producing small batches of samples in a lab and
by promising significant improvements in short order. However, Uni-Pixel was unable to
progress from lab to greater scale production, and he lost contracts with customers as a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1473211-uni-pixel-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words 9/72


result. He cited two examples of failures with the 10 micron version of UniBoss. In each
instance, Uni-Pixel was able to win initial contracts due to cherry-picked samples and big
promises of advancements, but Uni-Pixel would ultimately fail when it came time to
produce UniBoss in material volumes and in a real-life setting outside of the lab. He said
such instances were very embarrassing and led to his decision to leave the company.


We asked him if there was a chance the company had fixed its consistency problems and
made progress with UniBoss since he left in mid-2012. He said he didn't think the
company had made much progress since he left. We asked him if he thought Uni-Pixel
could ever manufacture UniBoss. He cautioned that Uni-Pixel lacked manufacturing DNA,
pointing out that, if you look up and down the employees, it's all sales people and early
stage scientists with no manufacturing experience and record of successful product
commercialization.


But Uni-Pixel has all these presentations with data and pictures, right? These
presentations have figures on UniBoss performance, show the progression they've made
over time, and have close ups of the product. This shows UniBoss works, right?


One industry expert said that he had significant misgivings on trusting anything on Uni-
Pixel's presentations. He has a Ph.D. in Chemistry and specializes in thin film and
coatings and started his career at Kodak. He examined their investor presentation and
noted the pictures they show on the slides are not consistent. The shape of the lines and
the angles of the grid are different in each slide. That signifies that the company cannot
consistently manufacture the products they present to investors. In order to show their
product, he said it is clear to him that they had to pick the best samples, and even then,
the company is having difficulty consistently manufacturing the samples. He said as a
scientist, he would be uncomfortable presenting Uni-Pixel's data and specifications. To
him, it was scientifically misleading, akin to a biotech company data-mining to show the
best treatment results of a small sub-group of patients that cannot be replicated in a larger
trial.


All of our research leads us to believe that Uni-Pixel cannot produce UniBoss. We find
Uni-Pixel's disclosure of delivery and production delays to support our view. Just in case
this isn't convincing enough, we'll be back in a few weeks with an expose on the shady
characters all around the company - in the management team, the board, and among the
owners.

Disclosure: I am short UNXL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

This article is hardly worth responding to as all of your claims are "i heard this, I heard that". So I will respond in the
same way.


I heard from people at the Craig-Hallum conference that the tablet demos on hand worked perfectly and had fantastic
optics.


I have also spoken with engineers at Synaptics and they did not mention any optical issues and felt that Uni-Pixel had
differentiated themselves with regard to price.


Which then leads me to my following point. If you think that UniBoss has so many obvious issues that just a few
pictures can prove it doesn't work, then why on earth would multiple companies be supporting it? You don't think they
would have noticed these potential issues?


And when UniPixel sent 50 units to the PC Manufacturer for testing, you don't think that the PC Manufacturer had
proof that they were produced as discussed and weren't just 'smoke and mirrors'?


And then you have this: 
"We asked him if there was a chance the company had fixed its consistency problems and made progress with
UniBoss since he left in mid-2012. He said he didn't think the company had made much progress since he left. We
asked him if he thought Uni-Pixel could ever manufacture UniBoss. He cautioned that Uni-Pixel lacked manufacturing
DNA, pointing out that, if you look up and down the employees, it's all sales people and early stage scientists with no
manufacturing experience and record of successful product commercialization."


Please, call up Robert Rusenko and ask him how he feels about this statement. Ask him about the R2R
manufacturing lines and his six sigma qualifications.

work for UNXL if he does not believe that the product can be manufactured.

Just to add, 6 microns is about the size of a human red blood cell. To further put it in perspective, Apple's so
called 'retina' display checks in with a pixel size of 77.9 microns per pixel.

You, as a self described individual investor, carry little weight with your observations. The real professionals at INTC,
DELL and KODAK have performed extensive due diligence on UNIBOSS and have committed significant corporate
resources to help UNXL to bring it to market as quickly as possible.

"Dell" and "Intel" can only judge from the samples they were given. 
Neither "Dell" or "Intel" know if UNXL can go into mass production. Only UNXL knows that. 
They could have been lied to just as easily they lied about DiamondGuard 9H hardness. 
This management has a proven history of giving false information.


Kodak is the supplier raw materials and handling. 
UniPixel is in charge of the printing process. 
This is were the problem is.

Eddiesno2
If you go back and read the press releases the companies you mention have not agreed to anything! INTC
and DELL being involved with UNXL were never actually stated in any official press release, it was pure
conjecture by the press and pump and dumpers on SA. The only company that has committed any capital
was Kodak, which paid $12M (or whatever the number was) for roughly half of the future profits related to
UniBoss.

Seth,


I'm new to UNXL and do respect individual investor's research such as your own. I'm a contributing author
myself, and fought some extremely misleading headlines from the big firms the last 9 months. I'm now
researching UNXL because some of my inner circle are curious.


So, I do have a few questions and statements I hope you can help shed some light on.


You stated the stock is worth $3 and is still a short here at $19. Is this based on fundamental analysis of the
projected market for inclusion in cheap low end products? or is it just a statement you used to put an
exclamation point on your thesis?


There is a growing need and desire for cheaper smart phones and tablets for a growing lower middle class
around the world. In fact, even AAPL has been hit with running out of high end consumers to some extent.
BTW, their retina screen is beautiful but even I wouldn't pay extra for it. Now even AAPL is planning cheaper
products (half price) for China and other places.


Could this technology be a fit for some manufacturers (not AAPL, they have their own) low end devices that
will grow in market share?


What are your projections for 2014, 2015, 2016 for these cheaper markets, and which technologies will fit the
bill for price and quality? If not UNXL, then which ones...


Lastly, regarding your pictures, the metal mesh lines that are visible still seem 1000% better than the 3rd
generation iPhone pixelation and even better than a lot of the android phone screens from 2 years ago.


So you see where I'm going with this. If I accept your thesis that this isn't a 'retina' quality screen replacement,
why does that mean it isn't a viable product considering the cost and the projected (by big research firms)
growing demand for cheaper products over the next few years and how did you arrive at $3.


Thank you,


Mike

UNXL themselves have said that there are optical issues & that is forcing them to selectively pitch UniBoss at the
bottom of the market.


Take a look at the last UNXL Earnings Call for confirmation & tell us again that this is a professional company - selling
an acknowledged inferior product does not justify even a quarter of the current valuation for me.

This came from the last Earnings Conference Call ..........


The references to the other partner (Dell) were far from complimentary & I would be surprised if the UniPixel
CEO didn't get a flea in his ear for saying .................


"One of the things that held us back over the past year, which I think we highlighted, was we weren't able to
achieve a kind of optical clarity that's consistent with that of ITO. And one of the key things that we've learned
over the past year with our partner is you'll deliver products where that's no longer a barrier to our success."

Even if your dubious claims were only marginally true (which I contest) are you actually saying that your "extensive
due diligence" (unnamed sources and disgruntled former employees? Really?) is greater than the ongoing due
diligence of many huge industry players, including "Dell" and "Intel"?


Despite your clear self-interest, one fact remains. UniPixel is a late stage development and early stage manufacturing
company. If (when?) potential problems exist in UniBoss I believe they will be discovered in the extensive testing
process and corrected.


31 May 2013, 10:25 AM


Paulo Santos, Marketplace Contributor
"Dell" and "Intel" are those DELL and INTC or some un-named "Dell" and "Intel"?


And your lying eyes, did you read the article with them closed so as not to see the pictures?

"Perhaps the most shocking thing we learned happened when we called the engineer at Texas Instruments back
earlier this month. He told us that Texas Instruments has decided to discontinue making touch controllers and that the
partnership with Uni-Pixel was therefore effectively over"


Touch controllers are a huge and growing global business, which is one of the reasons why INTC is entering the
market. A simple search of the TI official website shows that they are very much continuing on in this multi-faceted
and profitable market.


Your unnamed sources are suspect Seth.

TI was also was the manufacturer of the Omap smart phone processor that failed. Smart phone
microprocessors are also a very lucrative market if you are Qualcomm or Nvidia. 
This is a very competitive market were many companies have failed. 
Touch controllers are also a very competitive market were many manufacturers have called it quits. 
It is not far fetched that bankrupt TI also threw the white towel for touch controllers as they did for Omap.

Ever take a picture of a regular monitor? There's lines and grid patterns all over it! But most people can't see
it because they have bad vision (20/20 or worse) or don't view it close enough - as long as UNXL stays away
from screens held close up (and goes for larger screens viewed at a distance), this grid problem shouldn't be
a huge concern!


I am both long and short UNXL via options. I win either way. (but less)

Stock Market Mike, Contributor
When you have a stock that bobs up and down 100-200%, yet has options premiums in the 20% range (when
things cool down), yes, go both long and short. You have less gain, but you have gain, because the stock is
not going to sit still until expiry. Few stocks do, except maybe AGNC. (hovered within about a 20% range for
3-4 years?)


You could grab 2014/2015 $30 puts (not sure which; don't remember) for about $4 when UNXL hit $40+; after
this drop they're worth something like $20. Roll it over and buy a bunch of calls, then ditch those after they go
up in value to buy some more puts. Rinse and repeat. If UNXL gets stuck in the midrange ($23-33), do a
straddle and wait for it to break out in one direction or another.

Oh how smart UNXL's CFO, COO and Sr. VP look now having sold 120,000 shares in the 22's and 23's last March.
Perhaps they never imagined the bubble that would form (didn't hurt that COMP shot up 400 pts since Mar) and for
awhile kicked themselves for not waiting for the 30's. But I bet they're feeling a lot better now.

Make sure your upcoming expose includes Seong S. Shin, UniPixel's Chief Operating Officer - he held numerous
senior management positions at Samsung Electronics Co., lastly serving as a senior vice president of research and
development, where he led breakthroughs in new display technology, nano imprinting technology, roll-to-roll process
architecture. Mr. Shin was responsible for introducing new products, and he maintained the highest profit in the history
of Samsung’s LCD business among all product groups


Oh, I forgot, Samsung is not that important a company to consider, only the dominant gorilla in this space and he was
a major factor in their success, now running tiny Unipixel's operations.


Also, we are supposed to believe engineers from Dell & Intel aren't as smart as these unnamed, fictitious people.
These companies don't write $ 5MM checks without rigorous due diligence.

From the Synaptics website, we learn that on May 22, Synaptics announced the new product ClearPad® S7500,
which stated that " The S7500 accommodates a wide range of advanced touch sensor technology stackups, such as
On-Glass-Solution (OGS) and Ultra-Thin Discrete, and is compatible with emerging sensor materials like metal mesh.
This flexibility allows OEMs to add touch to their latest designs with little to no added thickness or weight, and
minimizing added component and manufacturing costs." We know that Synaptics is one of partners. This product
should be for Unipixel's Uniboss.

synaptics has to produce controllers which can accommodate metal mesh. With the number of PC'S and
tablets moving to touch, the cost benefits will be significant. Atml is a touch controller competitor but others
are working on this technology. Synaptics association (if any) is an attempt to cover their bases. They can't
work with Atml because atml has their own controller

"He said Uni-Pixel was unable to produce UniBoss using the additive, direct printing process. Nevertheless, Uni-Pixel
used the photolithographic sample to show that the metal mesh concept could work, but did not inform people that
Uni-Pixel had not yet found a way to manufacture it. It was all smoke and mirrors."


With this statement, the author is publicly alleging that Unipixel engaged in fraudulent activity. This is not something to
take lightly. Authors who make serious legal accusations should be held to a higher standard than citing an
anonymous former employee.

You didn't mention yield ONCE in your article. You are just going to take that tack now that others spoon fed
that to you (Ivan et.al.) in other responses. Virtually every industrial process has yields less than 100%, so
that is a grey area that is easy to attack. Yet you didn't mention it once in the article above, yet now you want
to make that the thrust .. was that your attorney's advice? Because UNXL has admitted that yields are not
perfect (as no process is), therefore you can legitimately attack there.


DESPITE HAVING NO EVIDENCE you claim the have yield issues. 
Amazing, when one set of false attacks fail, try another grey area attack!!

"Seth", Your statement that you "have made no allegation that the company engaged in any fraud" is beyond
the pale. You absolutely DID allege that Unipixel and its management is currently a fraud, and you claimed
that they previously defrauded investors. That's twice. It's right there for everyone to see, including Unipixel's
lawyers.


The following quotes are very clearly YOUR accusations, not just reporting the opinions of others. It doesn't
matter whether you based your allegations on information you received from your "sources". You took their
assertions, combined them with your own "research", and converted that to unique accusations of fraud,
which would be criminal. I can understand why you would want to back away from your allegations, but it's too
late. It's all there for the world to see.


Quote #1: "We have done extensive research on every part of Uni-Pixel and UniBoss. All the evidence
indicates to us that Uni-Pixel is a fraud and that UniBoss will fail."


Quote #2: "All the while, management keeps spinning a story that investors are eating up. However, research
into the background of the management team reveals Uni-Pixel is led by charlatans with a history of
misleading and defrauding investors out of money."

Free speech does have its limits. Certain statements or writings that are malicious, false, reckless, or even
just negligent may also be defamatory and, depending on the context and identity of the parties, might
warrant legal action. If this is the case, then you definitely have the right to protect your reputation from these
hurtful and potentially damaging attacks. 
Yes, it’s easy to see how First Amendment cases are complex, emotionally challenging and difficult to win.
And you don’t have to be a politician or reporter to trigger a First Amendment case. Free speech lawsuits can
and do affect everyone in society; this includes not only print newspapers, town council candidates, and
political activists, but also Internet publications, personal blogs, and average businesses or private individuals
engaged in their ordinary day-to-day business. The bottom line is that you are entitled to experienced and
zealous representation to defend your constitutional rights.

Just FYI, I have also used the product recently and can confirm the line breakage pictured here is not representative
of the current product they have been using as a demo. I specifically drew "up and down" lines across the entire

deem "tough" on the screen as far as recognition and it had no problem correctly recognizing my scribbles correctly. I
will leave the rest of the debate to the actual execution.

series of SA articles by the likes of Chris and GRA and Al Podell (his 1,332 price target is looking a bit rich
these days).


They were unsubstantial but they sure worked to pump up those shares. It all worked perfectly long enough
for UNXL to launch a $32 secondary which should be enough money to carry them until they come out with
the successor to TMOS and Diamond film and UniBoss.


Their jobs are secure for at least three more years.

Green River Asset, Contributor
Whether they are pixels or part of the cover is irrelevant. The fact is that they are there, yet we are still buying
the displays and don't seem to have a problem with the pattern.


UniBoss consists of a mesh that is much more difficult to detect, and it is arranged to blend with the pixels,
that's why the display looks so good when shown in demos. That's also why the Mirae product at 10 micron
looks so good on the shelves of BestBuy in Samsung's 23". It works and it looks good and that's why you

The nonsense in this article just distracts from the real issue which is whether or not UNXL can produce it in
commercial quantities. Time will give us our answer on this subject.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1473211-uni-pixel-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words 27/72


Exactly! However, I must comment regarding the two photos in the article that attempt to "expose" the optical
issue.


1. The picture with the film over the iPhone is bogus because the iPhone has its own ITO grid that plays
against the Uni-Boss grid, inducing the Moiré effect.


2. The film over paper picture is suspect because any touch module over pure white paper at that resolution
will reveal its grid to some degree. White paper is very different from edge-lit LCDs/AMOLEDs, etc., as there
are optical layers to enhance transmittance.

Simple math, do your own screen.


My HD laptop screen is 1080 lines high, while it is physically about 175mm high (just over 6.75") .. therefore,
each line of resolution is approximately 0.162mm in height or 162 microns !!!!!


If you can barely see a pixel without magnification, tell me you are going to see a 6 micron line. The eye
cannot see such fine resolution.


31 May 2013, 02:00 PM


Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
On the retina display on the iPhone you can't see the pixels from 8 to10 inches away.  
You can in a close up...


31 May 2013, 02:01 PM


JBird61
Ivan .. what is the resolution and size of that screen .. do the simple math like above (size in millimeters /
resolution of screen) x 1000 microns/millimeter = size of a pixel in microns .. 
What is yours pixel size that is barely visible when close?


31 May 2013, 02:06 PM


ouijaman1
Good catch Panaplos!


Anyone who knows what a moire effect is and what causes it knows this -- It can only happen from the
overlay of two differing screen patterns. The author is using this optical trick to make a false and misleading
claim.


What's the bottom line here?


1. As pre revenue company, UNXL is a news driven stock. 
2. We are currently in a news vacuum.

Sorry


A retina display by definition is a display that you can't see the pixels from 8 to 10 inches away.


My eyesight is not that good I can't see any pixels in my Z10 doesn't matter how close I get.


31 May 2013, 02:19 PM


Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
You got a point. 
Because a display produces light the light will hide away the mesh that would be otherwise be exposed
against a piece of paper on the background. 


31 May 2013, 02:24 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
From what I have heard, the mesh is very slightly noticeable (if you really try to see it) on the naked film, but
in a product (such as a tablet or notebook) you can't see it at all and it looks as clear if not clearer than an
iPad.


31 May 2013, 02:25 PM


Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
I agree with you on that Chris the lines are barely visible on paper. 
On a display it would become even less visible . 
Like Panoplos said the iPhone already has a grid and this would create a moire effect but if you look at the
finger above the iPhone the sensor is barely visible.


31 May 2013, 02:35 PM


H_H
The "debate", or the point of the article, may not be how visible the meshes are. As it is clearly stated, the
"printing" claimed by UNXL was not close to producing quality product - the printing was uneven.


It's a manufacturing process that is extremely difficult and advanced. UniBoss is a completely new material,
unproven in the industry. Therefore, it is totally reasonable to think the company may have disclosed
selectively, in terms of the truth about the state of manufacturing inside the company. No outsider knows for
sure, including yourself and everyone else who defended this company blindly.


There is only one truth - whether the company would get a big order or not. Until then, the company is not
telling. This is not about longs or shorts, even tho both sides have tried to "kill" each other with all sorts of

I dont understand how you could so strongly recommend this stock and still question whether or not unxl can
produce it in commercial quantities. Its seems ludicrous


31 May 2013, 05:59 PM


JBird61
Stil370, 
No one outside the few companies intimately involved with UniBoss know for sure if Uni-Pixel can produce it
at high levels. But if they can, UNXL a year from now could easily be worth 10-20 TIMES what they closed at
today. So it is a matter of risk tolerance. With Kodak, Dell, Intel as partners who are intimately involved with
the process at Uni-Pixel as well as the downstream integration processes, I feel the risk of failure is
reasonably acceptable. And with the odds of 10 or 20 (a year from now) to 1 (now).  
Therefore it is quite reasonable for a risk tolerant investor to "strongly recommend this stock and still question
whether or not unxl can produce it in commercial quantities".

Author’s reply »  Your photo is a super close-up of icons from Outlook. Each of the icons in your photo is
many times larger than it would be in real life. In contrast, our photos include a finger in the photo. Hence, the
presence of visible lines in our much less magnified photo should be of great concern to anyone long the
stock. In my opinion, this makes the product unsaleable.

Typically one would not view their screen with a piece of paper over it. Ever notice how shadow puppets
change in size and focus as they move away from the sheet and closer to the light? Do you figure that they
remain in focus (un-magnified) when the sheet is not there? how about providing us with a picture of the
screen with no paper over it ?

02 Jun 2013, 07:27 PM


JBird61
Since you won't answer my question on pixel size for your retina display, I will.


1 pixel = 78 microns in size 
UniBoss lines = 6 microns wide


You readily admit that 78 micron pixels cannot be seen from a reasonable distance, and yet you think that 6
micron lines are visible to the naked eye, much less visible in a poor quality low-resolution photograph.


It is amazing to me that you guys keep defending this article full of obvious distortions.

Why does the finger look like that? Is that because the camera is inferior, or was the picture re-focused or brightness
adjusted to make the lines appear more distinct? Take a picture of a plain white paper or scan it and you can adjust
the brightness to make the pulp fibers more distinct. 
As for my credentials, I'm a biotech investor so I'm able to diagnose if there is something wrong with a finger :)


31 May 2013, 01:58 PM


JBird61
I agree Slum,


But the scale is way off too on that FINGER PHOTO. I zoomed in and counted the lines that were
appoximately the same distance as the fingernail width .. and counted 22. (feel free to duplicate my efforts)


My fingernail is about 12mm wide or 12,000 microns .. if 12,000 mirons => 22 lines, then they are spaced at
over 500 microns apart. UniBoss line spacing is MUCH MUCH finer than that!!


Therefore, the photo is either doctored, it is not UniBoss, or is a background interference pattern that is
showing through.


It just doesn't 'add' up, physically and mathematically.

The resolution of the human eye is 50 microns, not 20, not 5 or 6. The human eye cannot resolve ( translate that as
SEE !!!) an object smaller than 50 microns. A human hair varies in width from 50 to 100 microns as a comparison.
The photo's are BS and are either Photo shopped or not Uni-Boss to begin with or an artifact of the video source
behind it. What you are definitely not seeing is the UniBoss screen.

This line is an out and out lie. A single screen cannot, by definition, create a Moiré effect. Only two screen patterns
can produce this effect.

Isn't the line visibility just shadowing because the film you are looking at is not bonded to the paper, or whatever else
you put behind it? It's got to do with the texture of the back side of the film.

One observer with whom I spoke today, who has followed the company and its stock for some time, but who declined
to be identified by name, tells me that Shaw is in error because the sample itself is broken.


“The company had told people that there would be lines because it’s [the sample] a year and a half old now, and it’s
broken.” Adds the source I spoke with, Uni-Pixel is expected to have a new demo unit at an industry conference next
week, “and they will work just fine,” the source contends.

Seth, you'll soon be 0 for 3. 
Previous articles pumped ONTY (failed START trial, down 75%) and took KRO/VHI to task (VHI up 25% in the last
year, KRO about even, both excluding dividends). Quite a winning streak there.


For "an investor in individual stocks" you sure use "we" and "our" a lot.


I do have to thank you for allowing one last load at prices below anything I thought I might get again.


Cheers.

statement to have them labelled "charlatans".Any real evidence would be appreciated.

That's well documented. 
Like DiamondGuard was reported to have a hardness of 9H when it was really 6H.

There are twenty levels of hardness in the scale you are referring to. The scale usually ends at 9H but there
are examples of 10H. Every one should know that this scale is a scale which expresses the hardness of
graphite pencils. If a pencil of a given hardness, whose point is at a 45 degree angle to the surface being
tested, leaves a black mark then the substance is at least as hard as that grade of graphite. If instead the
pencil leaves a scratch in the surface the surface is less hard than the pencil graphite grade. OK: the
generally referred to scale has twenty levels. 9H, 8H, 7H, 6H, 5H, 4H, 3H, 2H, H, F, HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B,
6B, 7B, 8B, 9B. See: http://bit.ly/18LZ0p0. Now: 9H is the hardest and 9B is the softest. So 6H is the 4th
hardest grade. Management may have erred in saying the Diamond Guard was 9H but at 6H it's quite hard.

Seth Shaw:


How do you address Barron's article implying that you distorted the truth about the demo unit?


----------------------... 
One observer with whom I spoke today, who has followed the company and its stock for some time, but who declined
to be identified by name, tells me that Shaw is in error because the sample itself is broken.


“The company had told people that there would be lines because it’s [the sample] a year and a half old now, and it’s
broken.” Adds the source I spoke with, Uni-Pixel is expected to have a new demo unit at an industry conference next
week, “and they will work just fine,” the source contends.

That's not a touch controller it is a piezo haptic controller.

Yes it can be used with touch screens to enhance the touch experience with tactile feedback.

llo Seth, you mentioned "very few people have seenthe product outside of the limited presentation environment." I
have personallyattended the shareholder meeting last month. Several of us investors were allowed to touch the same
demo, touch and lookthrough a cut sample of material, and review a roll of production material.Nobody was
concerned with the performance of the 10+ touch point demo (http://bit.ly/Zzlfvj) nor the visibility of the lines. 
The nearby production line, they showed live footage of atthe meeting, only requires two personnel to actively run, by
the way. 
Not only does Mr. Rusenko have awesome manufacturingexperience, but if you reviewed the job postings on the Uni-
Pixel website inthe past few months, you would have seen they have been actively recruitingmanufacturing engineers
( http://bit.ly/12UBvnB). There are already several positionsthat used to be posted they have filled.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth videoFPS * 1000 words * secondsOfVideo...


You debunked the article with this video alone, and your reply added to it. Good work.


01 Jun 2013, 02:20 PM


voteforpedro
I watched the company demo video beaumh posted above. The video actually confirms author's finding that
the sample has a defect that may cause gaps/breakages.


Watch the video at 0:11, 0:22, 2:21, and 3:18. You will see the distortion of touch sensing happening at the
vertical band area in the middle of the panel. There are breakages of touch sensing too: in the video you can
see many instances of finger swipe across the middle area leaving a circle and line color change, which
means the swipe is broken. BTW, this is a serious defect because you can't perform a drag and drop reliably.


Also, the location of the defective area of in the video looks to be the same location of the breakages shown
in author's photo. Now, I think Seth has a video evidence in his favor courtesy of uni-pixel.


03 Jun 2013, 07:56 AM


ouijaman1
Yet, at 2:50 solid lines are being drawn across the screen multiple times with no breakage. How do you
explain that? A broken grid would have produced broken lines in the draw.

Seth, if this is not a doctored picture, then please upload the full sized image. The resolution of the image you
uploaded is much lower than the other photos. If you cannot produce this image, we can only conclude you
cannot do so because, either 1) you did not take the image, and it was given to you, in which case you cannot
claim they are not doctored, or 2) you manipulated the photo yourself.


Also, you need to name your so called engineer sources, because there is mounting evidence you are
fabricating lies.

Actually nothing to be surprised for the quick down moves.


If a stock ran too high in too short period of time with no fundamental support, it will go back to earth with or without
bearish articles:


BVSN - run from $8 to $55 and back to $8 now 
ROSG - run from $3 to $20 and back to $3 now.


I can list many more.


Even companies with high growth (both revenues and earnings), if it run too high in too short time, stock will always
pull back with different degrees.


Right now UNXL still does not have fundamental support: no real revenue, no proven record of successful product
launch.

I seriously doubt you'll be asked back at corporate HQ any time soon. I have no stake in UNXL, so perhaps I can be
more objective. I've read the piece and the comments. The stock price was affected in a major way, so I do believe
the SEC will be looking into this.


Yes, the author puts himself and the publisher at legal risk. 
The fact no engineers were identified by name in this article is very suspect. OTOH, SA would not have allowed this
to be put into print unless the author could back up his claims and was willing to do so.

Any investor with experience in stocks where there is a high percentage of shorts understands these short sellers
have no ethics and no conscience. But...they are highly skilled.


This article is just the latest example of a cleverly written piece with not one fact and not one person or reference
named--all hearsay, innuendo, and false premise.


As another poster stated, these articles are planned well in advance, they are written by an author well versed in the
company, they are part of a coordinated attack, they stop just short of outright falsehood, and they are timed to hit in a
down cycle of company news.


I doubled up under $16, advise everyone to do the same--then simply have patience.


If UNLX proves the ability to manufacture Uniboss, which I believe they will, these attacks will soon fade and the
shorts will move on to another momentarily vulnerable company, as is their vulture-like habit.

Here is what I found interesting on the broken line photo.


If you look at the bottom line the break starts clear and then notice the bend at the start of where the next line picks
up. If you swipe across a page and the screen has an issue you would think there would be a clean break and a
straigth start where it picked up.


My conclusion is the photo is a fake or that the person swiling the page just picked up 2 fingers for a second while
they were swiping and then put them down again continuing across the page. That would explain the slight bend of
where the line starts again.


Either way I know they have built several new demos and are showing them off as we speak. They have a couple big
demos they will be doing this month. One will be next week. Lets hope someone gets some video at the conference
and posts it on youtube. If a picture is worth a thousand word a video might be worth 10,000 words.

If anyone really wants to see what a uniboss touch screen looks like you should check the company website. A
picture is worth a thousand words but a vieo is worth a lot more. There are no visible lines on the screens or a tablet
or an android and everything is working perfectly.


http://bit.ly/19wHunF


If you notice in Seth's pictures you have no visible lines in the computer using Uniboss. Looking as a mesh in front of
white paper or on top of another touch screens will be visible. Once put in an actual device the touch screen
disappears. The human eye won't detect it unless you get a few inches from the screen.

I doubt anybody is stupid enough to doctor photos and present them in a public investment domain to influence stock

and the author knew that when posting in an attempt to manipulate, that could also be criminal. I guess time will tell.

I don't know what the fuss is about. Uni-Pixel is planning and pricing at a low entry point. Their stuff is not fantastic but
works. They will be bit players in the market and aren't really worth talking about.


I agree the shares seem a bit overpriced but aside from that, let them go after the low end market and call me when
their product improves. In tech its all about momentum and it looks like their sales will improve in the short term. Even
Uni doesn't know if they'll survive in the long term.

UNXL is not well capitalize to enter a low entry market at this point. Much more hurdles to get thru

Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
The fuss is about that they mislead investor. 
Last week they admitted that they can't produce to 70% yield. 
Once trust is out of the door there is nothing left. 
They lied about this just like they lied about Diamond Guard 9H hardness. 
Now the firms that lost money with the public offering will sue because they were mislead. 
UniPixel will soon lose every last penny and even some jail time is entitled.  
Families lost their life saving... this is very serious. 
The best thing that could happen to UNXL is that to someone buys it but I don't think anyone will be interested
in their technology. 
I knew from the very beginning that resin transfer under 10 microns is pretty much impossible.  
This was my argument against UNXL but they claimed it was viable when they didn't know that as a fact. 
Right now the UNXL stock is worthless. 
Sorry for all the longs but you were lied to.

Hey, Ivan, can I ask you based on your expertise in the field what would lead you to believe "resin transfer

Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
Thank you for exposing this scam. 
It is clear that the company mislead investors on their yield. Last week they admitted that they have not
achieved a 70% yield. Now there is a second law firm investigating the fraud.


I'm sorry for all the longs. 
UniPixel can still achieve success if they fix their yield issue but I see that as very unlikely. But the fact still
remains that they mislead investors.


The pictures and the testimonies are just the cherry on the top.


Even if they produce better demos and samples there is no proof that they can mass produce it.


If they have problems even producing samples this late in the game there is no basis to support that they can
mass produce.


It is sad that many families lost their money.


I tried to warn them to the best of my abilities but to no avail.


Neither Intel, Dell or SYNA knows if UNXL can mass produce a quality product. They were mislead too just
like the rest of us.

stockmarketdouble,


Anybody who has done half as much DD on Uni-Pixel as GRA or myself has knows that not only is this article
incorrect, but it is also full of lies, deceptions, and half-truths.


Xuhua Zhou's articles have already been proven to be false, and in the future this article will be proven to be false as
well.


Personally, I sleep easy at night knowing that I can rely on my DD. Xuhua, 'Seth', and others, on the other hand, lack
a moral compass or any sort as they knowingly spread lies.


I would suggest that anybody truly interested in this company do some real research. Contact the company. Contact
Synaptics. Contact Touch International. Look at the demos on the website. Visit the company and view the film /
demos for yourself. You will very quickly realize that this article is merely pushing an agenda, not facts.

You keep on saying my article has been proven false. How so? If anything, the Company's announcement in
delaying products on shelf proves my point that they do not, have never had, a viable technology. The
Company is a serial partnership signer..unfortunately signing partnership is not a business.


02 Jun 2013, 12:44 AM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Xuhua,


Here is your very own conclusion from your article on Jan 10th:


Conclusion


My research shows that:


1. The potential addressable market is a negligible $100-200m in 2019, compared with $19b the management
would like the investors to listen; 
2. Uni-Pixel's technology has weaknesses that the management did not want to convey, and this technology
has been disregarded by the competitors with better technology and financial resources; 
3. Uni-Pixel has only one non-US patent approved to show for its UniBoss technology and this very patent is
challenged by its Europe competitor immediately after approval. 
4. The management has a track record of delivery failures.


While GRA and I both agree with point 4, point 1 has clearly been disproven, point 2 has been disproven
through the multiple partnerships, and point 3 is also false as they have significantly more than 1 patent and
given that the Carclo lawsuit has seemingly disappeared, I will assume that UNXL is winning.


Your second article is entirely focused on the Carclo lawsuit and how it is a slam-dunk for Carclo. However, as
I mentioned, it has seemingly disappeared


02 Jun 2013, 12:54 AM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
I think this article clearly shows the validity of my point 2. It will be further proven in the next few months when
Unipixel fails to produce anything.  
On point three, it is factually true they only have one approved patent relevant to UniBoss. The rest of the
patents are all pending. Carlco lawsuit has not gone away. It has been moved to a state court but no
judgement's been rendered on the validity of the infringement claims. 
Point 1 is subject to debates. I cited data from other parties as well as prior projection by Unipixel's own
management. The market is changing and evolving.


The second article bears significance beyond the lawsuit itself. It shows the lack of reliability of the
management team. The complaint itself was very telling. Either way, I think the scam probably got a few
weeks, maybe months to go. You bet there will be an ensuing SEC investigation on the management after
this thing unravels and it will be clear by then who's the one that's been telling the truth.

Nowadays it's actually extremely difficult to take photos with your mega-pixel phone camera that look as grainy and
low-res as those put out by Seth Shaw. The allegation of photo tampering aside, it's painfully obvious that the author
has gone to considerable length to keep the original images from his readers, which begs the question: what does he
have to hide?

They do not. Stop making BS claims because somebody told you the truth about an obvious pump and dump.
SA published plenty of bullish pieces from the bulls, and is also publishing negative pieces as they flow in.


SA itself only cares about article quality, not the opinion in it.


02 Jun 2013, 01:49 PM

How can you use terms like "obvious pump and dump" that is ludicrous. Eastman Kodak and Intel do not
partner with pump and dump companies. Sorry Charlie. The short gig is up.


02 Jun 2013, 07:17 PM


Michael Fuller, Contributor
Ashraf,


In this case (as in many others), SA does not care about quality. Is that 'contributor' I see next to your name?
If so, you know the very basics of what they request for each article, and you also know how few articles
actually contain those sections.


Furthermore, historically speaking the editors allow articles that have massive misinformation in them. The
reason is simple, they can only act as copyeditors because they lack the necessary background to know
basics about the companies and in this articles case, the science. This is actually something SA is looking
into, and we may see specialty editors in the future. Biotech is one place that they themselves have
mentioned they have a need.


In this articles case, let's do some basic science that anyone who took a science class can look up in their old
textbooks.


40 microns is the largest viewable by the naked eye. Whether you use the old Uniboss size or the new one,
you still end up with something that is 8 times smaller than viewable.


Now we need to account for optics of the glass. Even flat glass has a small defraction and magnification
factor. In fact, the quality of the glass used for prototyping can have a huge effect, although still not visible to
the naked eye.


So let's throw in the lens of a camera, which by it's very nature is a magnifying reticle. Ever notice those are
convex? Well they are, and for a reason. Even a 1x lens is actually a magnification lens and is convex.
Couple that with another piece of glass and viola, you'll see all sorts of things you wouldn't normally. It's like
creating a really crappy microscope.


Let's dive deeper though. In the photos above, one was enlarged. Either that or Seth has some pretty big
fingers with pretty big skin cells, lines, etc.


On another photo, a third piece of glass was then introduced... oh my!


Barring all that, my actual reply to Seth involved the fundamental aspects of the business, and I'm still
awaiting answers. Good analysis would include the following information, right (you are an author here)?

- Who are the competitors and what is their technology? 
- What is the cost to manufacture their technology vs this technology? 
- What segment of the market is Uni-boss targeting? 
- Is that appropriate? 
- What are the projected margins for this product and the competitors? 
- How large is the target market segment? 
- How much of that segment will this company potentially capture?


According to this article, the product doesn't work, no one will use it but it's still worth $3/share. No other
information is provided.


Simple questions requiring basic analyst research. I ask those questions accepting his thesis that Uniboss
might not be all it's cracked up to be. I'm not even long or short. I want to be able to make a decision like
everyone else. I need the fundamental research for that.


I know I certainly would not have wanted to publish an article with all my sources being unnamed, basic optics
errors, basic science errors, and no actual research. So, I'm sure Seth has answers to all this and just hasn't
published it yet.

for Uniboss.


If we accept his thesis that it is inferior, then with the growing demand for cheaper smart phones, tablets, etc.
well the cost to produce Uniboss blows away all competition.


Here is a simple test too. Hold your finger up to the photos. Better yet, right click, save to your local system
and pull them up. Now hold your finger up to Seth's and adjust the zoom until they are the same size. See
anything? Me neither. Not even distortion from the wires diffracting the light around them.

Heat comes in the morning when he reads a PR that (my opinion .. no inside knowledge here) Uni-Pixel is

02 Jun 2013, 02:09 PM


Michael Fuller, Contributor
Seth,


I've now also read your previous article and I must say I am rather confused. None of your research includes target
market, projections based on market share, current competitors in the same screen price target, comparisons to other
screens technologies (screenshots of them with your finger), etc.


I gotta admit, I just looked at my finger and I can barely make out the ridges on my finger nail. The mesh on the
screen is even smaller (per your photo).


Also, Kodak did do a PR on April 16th (a few days before your last article). I'm curious as to why you think bankruptcy
filings, which take months to prepare, should have included potential revenue that they only signed an agreement on
3 days before.


Please explain how you derive your price target based on the factors I mention. It will lend great credibility to your
thesis as you haven't claimed it is worth zero, even though you use words that lead one to believe the company is a
fraud, their products do not work, etc. So why $3 instead of $0?


Just trying to make sense of all this. Thanks in advance for any additional info you can provide.


02 Jun 2013, 05:32 PM


Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
Is impossible to determine potential revenue if UNXL hasn't revealed their yield.  
First they said they had a 70% yield and they were going to improve in that. Now they said "our goal is to
achieve yields of 70% in three to six months." 
The question here is "Does UniPixel has a sustainable manufacturing process that can produce a quality
product?" 
Anything else is irrelevant.

Michael Fuller, Contributor
Ivan,


Those questions were directed to the Author. As for the yield, if you mean margin, that has been explicitly
explained as 50%. Of which, with the Kodak agreement, it was then confirmed and the additional information
of splitting that 50% 50/50 was stated.


As for not being able to value it, my question to Seth was how he was valuing it. In one paragraph he states it
DOES NOT WORK. In other he gives a $3 value. If it doesn't work, isn't marketable, and this is the only
possible product the company has to generate revenue and profits (other products are low end margin), then
it's not worth $3.


So I'll again restate. What is the target product market? How does it compare to the competition in terms of
price points and quality (side by side comparisons in same photograph)? What part of that target product
does Seth expected to be captured (0% because it doesn't work or all of it as he says it is intended for all
those low end products companies are working to design for market in 2014)? etc.


If this is a short for shorting sake, then Ivan you just gave away the farm with your uninformed and un-
researched answer.

Steel,


This disinformation campaign has been a concerted effort over months by shorts to recover from the run-up to
$40. They have been attacking UNXL at every level, from the personnel to the technology to the partners to
the production capabilities to the truth of press releases and conference calls. They elicited a young reporter
on Barron's to print their BS. There have been at least a dozen SA articles and instablogs dissing UNXL.
Citron Research posted totally biased and flat out lied about A&M claiming that Kodak bought half of UNXL
for $12 million (http://bit.ly/12GIstO). They have attacked quite reputable management personnel to make
them seem incompetent and deceitful. They have claimed that UNXL failure to commercialize TMOS and
another early product were proof of lies by management. They claimed a frivolous lawsuit against UNXL
would bring Pixie down. They claimed there was no PC OEM partner - it was just another management lie.
They have falsely claimed the second NRE payment of $5 million was a restatement of the first $5 NRE
payment. They have spread disinformation using message boards, tweets, instablogs, SA articles, websites,
the mainstream media and And IMO all of it comes down to shorts trying to drive the price down in the name
of greed.

Anything (and i DO mean anything) to confuse, obfuscate, raise concern, throw doubt, scare and even
defame - so that people will sell or be afraid to invest.


Just because you are new to the story, doesn't mean the story is new.This article is the same old scare tactics
and disinformation methods that have been employed since before I bought my first shares in January.

I don't think I want to read through all these messages. But I have one major question. You are showing Uniboss and
claiming it doesn't work. That it will be visible and no one will want to buy it. Uniboss is 6 microns wide. the company
has said that they are actually printing 5 microns I believe. So XSense and Uniboss are the same size lines. So are
you saying the XSense is goign to fail too? Or is this just a Uniboss issue.


If Uniboss and XSense are a problem why are so many people in the industry interested in metal mesh? I really don't
think your argument and picutes are accurate. truth is that Uniboss is no more visible that any other metal mesh
product. The only issue you could have is that Uniboss can't be produced and we all know the first line is already up
and running. So i am sorry but I can't believe that your arguments hold water.

If anyone wants the truth note the first picture has nothing to show you the actual size. The author has taken the
photo and enlarged it so you can see the mesh. You can do this with any mesh. Seth do you want to say this is not
true. The second photo has a finger. Note the size of the finger. If the photo was actual size the grid would not be
noticable. Even with the enlargement you can barely tell there is a grid. Actual size the grid could not be seen at all.
Same with the photo in front of the phone. Enlarged and You can't put 2 grids in front of each other without creating
the moire effect shown in the picture. If you want to be accurate please show the 1st 2 in their normal size and get rid
of the one in front of the phone. If you do that the only thing you have is a machine that you say didn't work. I don't
know that to be true but lets say it is true. Machines break all the time. Did someone drop it? Hell we don't know what
happened. I will note one thing. Uniboss has been bent in testing thousands of times and still works. ITO would break
in only a few short bends. I don't believe durability will be an issue with Uniboss. Copper will win in durability every
time.

I would like to comment on this article by Mr. Shaw. His article is based on two lines of information. The first is that
photographic evidence proves that the Uniboss touch film will not be viable is based on the photographs presented in
the article. The second is line of information is discussion with a number of individuals at Unipixel partner companies
and ex-employees of Unipixel. I'll adsress each area in turn. I believe that the purported photographic evidence does
not make, nor does it support, the thesis that 'lines' on the Uniboss film are too evident and lead to poor optical
quality. Photographs 1 and 2 are pictures of the film which are purported to show the lines in the Uniboss film.
However careful inspection of picture 2 in the enlarged view shows that the lines that intersect the left of the finger
count at approximately 30 lines in 12 mm, which gives a line width of 0.2 mm (200 microns) per line (there appear to
be equally sized lighter regions between each 'line' in the enlarged view). I carefully examined the pixel count of a
Samsung monitor and found them to be 270 microns in the horizontal direction with each subpixel at 90 microns in
width. A red vertical line drawn against a black background (Powerpoint) and set at 0.25 points results in the use of a
single vertical row of red subpixels. This line can be seen but is 15-fold the expected width of Uniboss metal mesh
lines, which should not then, be visible by simple inspection and whose dimension is clearly far smaller than the lines
that are stated by the author to constitute the mesh of Uniboss. A more telling photograph is photo 3 where the

Uniboss film is stated to show the visible gridline due to the mesh. Careful inspection of the region where the authors
finger is viewed through the film shows that in the left half of that area there appears to be a diamond shaped cross
hatch pattern of lines but in the right half of that area the pattern cannot be seen. This suggests that the appearance
of 'lines' when viewing the film is highly sensitive to the angle of view. Furthermore inspection of the portion of photo 3
where the iPhone screen is overlayed by the film shows different patterns in different areas again suggesting that the
observed 'lines' are artifacts of exactly how the film is positioned relative to the iPhone screen and that these effects
are not likely due to visible lines in the Uniboss film. Further to this is that using a iPhone 4S I photographed a white
background on the aforementioned Samsung monitor. Upon zooming the photo on the iPhone 4S different moire
patterns could be seen and their intensity, coloration and size were dependent on the amount of zoom employed. I
could employ such photos to persuade anyone to avoid the monitor in question but in fact the monitor is excellent.
Photographing a monitor or a patterned object with a digital camera can result in unanticipated artifacts and
distortions due to interactions of the pixelated sensor with the patterns. A related example is where videography of
video monitors shows apparent very poor video on the subject monitors due to interactions of the refresh rates of the
monitor and the videography frame rate. Hence I believe that the photographic evidence is weak especially in nview
of the lack of any controls or comparison photos with other metal mesh films, for example. I believe that the author
has been misled by poorly acquired and badly misinterpreted photographs. Now as to the second line of argument.
The various employees of partner companies and ex-employees of Uniboss appear to unanimous in stating that
Uniboss is not ready for prime time. Furthermore the author makes very serious allegations about the conduct and
ethics of Unipixel management, even members of the Board of Directors, and promises a future article as such: "Just
in case this isn't convincing enough, we'll be back in a few weeks with an expose on the shady characters all around
the company - in the management team, the board, and among the owners."


The second line of argument is much harder to refute than the first as no one has access to the sources quoted by the
author. If the author is to be believed one has to believe that there is massive overstatement by company
management of their capabilities, deception by the company of major players in the field, a lack of ability or diligence
of the partner companies to discern the efficacy and capability of Unipixel scientists and technology, mis-
representation of the nature of the partnerships and relationships they have with the companies they have worked
with, foolish and premature commitment of substantial funds (Kodak 12MM, others 15MM) and more. On the other
hand if the authors' accounts are fabricated or significant misrepresentations one has to believe that the author is
comfortable both with making specious allegations and also with exposing him/herself (Seth Shaw is a pseudonym) to
potential legal action that could be devastating. At this juncture it is hard to believe that management could be in the
serious pickle portrayed by the author, but it is not impossible. Execution risk has always been an issue for Unipixel,
but indeed this is the case for any new technology. [As an aside, regarding the unfortunately not well executed
marketing of FPR, I comment that I personally bought and used the Unipixel screen protector on two iPod touch units
and it was a fantastic product, performing exactly as advertised. Though it was not successfully brought to market in
the manner of other films I have seen (eg Zaag Invisible Shield) my experience was that it was the best I have seen
both in ease of application , optical performance, resistance to fingerprints and durability.]


To sum up I have to lean, with caution, toward supporting the company as opposed to the author of the article which
makes scandalous accusations based on what appears to be at least one line of defective evidence (photos) and
another unverifiable line evidence ('sources'). This said there are several questions that the community here should
try to answer: 1.) Is Texas Instruments really out of the 'touch screen controller' business as the author alleges?; 2.)
Why is Kodak convinced to commit 12MM dollars to a technology that supposedly is inefficacious? As they are only

emerging from bankruptcy why would they commit this much precious cash to a supposed non-starter? 4.) What in
fact is the opinion of Kodak engineers on the Uniboss process? 5.) Why is Unipixel expending funds to buy more
printing and plating machines for the Lufkin facility if the technology does not work? 5.) What exactly is the nature of
the relationship between Intel and Unipixel?

Seth,


Your fairy tale story that is entirely self referencing, with no independent or verifiable corroboration will be dismantled
piece by piece in coming days and weeks.


Today's update to Unipixel's website showing a functional and high quality touchscreen in a working model in which
there is no moire effect and the pixels can be seen before the metal mesh can be seen, and even then only under
magnification, and which verifies what many other people have reported who have seen for themselves many working
models provided by the company.

Look on the right hand side titled Uniboss Touch Sensors and the three categories highlighted in red.


And please don't respond by saying that you stand by everything you have written. For a statement like that to have
credibility, you have to be credible, and you have none.

Those new demos and pictures WERE not on their website even yesterday morning. I spent the day
researching UNXL and I was on their site scouring, as well as the SEC, and competitors sites.


They will NOT officially respond to short attack articles, per their statements in the last CC. They did respond
though, for all to see... instead of lowering themselves to get into personal wars with SA authors.

Panopolis,


Okay, I'll get into some detail. Yes, they added the Moire but the also added much more.


No they didn't 'respond' with detailed statements. However, a little analysis goes a long way. First, between
their screenshots there, and their new conference presentation, you can see that they have 3 different levels
of product displayed.


With that in mind, we already now that the video shorts like to use as an example is an old one, that used a
protype for 20 microns. Almost viewable to the naked eye, especially when you put a piece of glass in front of
it. Uses... manufacturing, retail, etc.


Then they show smaller gauges. The smallest is 6, and that is 8 times smaller than is viewable to the naked
eye, when you put your eye right up to it. Basic optics and science there. Put a few levels of magnification on
it and sure you can see it if you are close up. Uses... smart phones, tablets, etc. Considering the cost to
manufacture, cheaper end is an easy sell and that market is growing worldwide.


See where I'm going? The photos above are zoomed in to begin with (or Seth has really fat fingers and big
skin cells), he never shared which level of product he photographed, he also never shared how he comes up
with a $3 price target. I'm skeptical.


Further research on competitors, their quality, their price to manufacture... LOL... easy to understand why
there is interestin in UNXL.


Let's address the authors claim to 'different patterns'. Yep, the new presentation even shows a couple
different wire patterns along with the different gauges.


The list goes on...


Let's put it in everyday terms though. When you go to best buy to buy a new LCD Hi-Def TV, did you stand
back to the normal viewing range for your living room or did you just buy the 1080p because it's the best?
Most people don't need more than 720p, because once you back away more than 3 to 4 ft, you can't tell the
difference. No one views a 55 in TV at 3 to 4 ft, right?


Now let's look at TV sales data. Is there a market for 1080p regardless of whether you can see the
difference? Sure, some folks will buy the best regardless. Is there a market for 720p? Yep, and it's rather
large. Poorer people around the world now have LCDs. In fact it's just in the last few years, as consumers got
smarter, that 720p sales have grown. Why pay for 1080p when you can't tell the difference?


Is this a replacement for the highest end tech out there? I doubt it, but the short story/thesis acts like it is
supposed to be and it is worthless because it isn't as good. LOL. Considering the extremely cheap cost to
manufacture, why would anyone want to spend 50x more for a display you can't tell the difference with (the
best).

What about the biggest complaint people have with devices... battery life... well, UNXL has the competition
beat by a long shot on that too.


Don't know about you, but even I avoided the Apple Retina displays based on cost vs the difference in quality.

recognized that there is a problem as stated in the stock manipulation article they posted last week, but on
the other hand they seem lax in their due diligence of articles such as this UNXL piece. I personally wrote one
of the SA editors with my concerns, and I got a response saying they would look into the issue.


03 Jun 2013, 12:29 PM


Panoplos, Contributor
To be honest, they should simply refuse to publish anything that takes such brave steps in calling companies
outright frauds without financials to back the claims up, etc. The reward is not worth the risk, IMHO.


On the other hand, if they are front-running articles, they might be making fortunes. They are not a US
company and are focused on internet "news" with lots and lots of clauses regarding no responsibility for
accuracy, etc., so they are technically out of the reach of the SEC. It is my guess laws will be drafted as a
result -- but until then, it is the wild west, and filthy lucre is all that matters, here.

Atmel now qualified on Uniboss? Appears so.


"At the Cowen TMT Conference, UNXL had two working versions of UniBoss: a 10.1-inch Chi Mei Innolux display with
an N-trig controller, and a 13.3-inch LG display with an Atmel controller."


Has ATML pulled the plug on CIT already? They never qualified their CO facility and said they are going to stop
providing updates on it. They have canceled Xsense orders. INTC's endorsement of UNXL (and not CIT) means
ATML has to work with Uniboss or forgo Wintel opportunities. And of course that's why ATML said they see Fuji as
more of a competitor than UNXL; UNXL is their partner. It all makes perfect sense.

03 Jun 2013, 04:49 PM

Ivan-


Stating facts is not pumping.


FACT: UNXL has qualified 6 controller companies on Uniboss. N-trig, TI, SYNA we know about. Three others
we don't know the names of.


FACT: UNXL showed two demos at the Cowen Conference using an N-trig controller in one device and an
ATML controller in the other device. In a website demo UNXL showed an Android device using a TI controller.


FACT: Intel has endorsed three touch sensor solutions -- CIT, Atmel's purported partner WAS NOT one of
them.


Given these facts: do you think its likely that Atmel will continue to develop Xsense with CIT and therefore not
be an Intel endorsed solution in the Wintel ecosystem or do you think Atmel may have re-evaluated their
sensor partner? It makes sense that Atmel would re-valuate, no? And now we have a Uniboss/Atmel demo on
display at a conference? Why would Uni-pixel use an ATML controller in its demo and not SYNA for example?
Do you really think Uni-Pixel can qualify a controller on a new touch sensor without the assistance/input from
the controller company? Of course not, so ATML would have helped create this demo.

to play into the deception for ethical reasons, so I abstained from the short, but I will surely put a few hundred
grand down on the post-crash reaction to BS pieces like this.

After reading the two class action and it is directed at UNXL company and management, I don't think any success will
come of it however it will cost at least a million for this year for legal fee. What your opinion?

If we see a correction on some real solid news, they will have to spend exactly 0 on this.

Uni-Pixel spent far less than a milion on the CIT lawsuit, and that had at least a shadow of merit unlike this
class action. In Q1, legal fees were $700k and $250k of that was for patent filings .. how much else was for
other normal legal consultation: for PR, negotiating multiple partner agreements, etc. .. my estimate is that
FAR less than half of that 700k was for CIT shtuff.


IF this class action goes ahead which is unlikely because I expect performance will make these claims moot,
I'd be surprised if legal fees got anywhere close to that million you are projecting.

I just posted some comments in this author's article that he posted today, but in checking back to this article from 5/31
I don't see any comments at all pointing out what I feel is glaringly obvious - and that is the discrepancies in the exif
data in these pictures.


As many of you probably noticed, the first two pictures have full metadata which include GPS coordinates to
(conveniently) "prove" that they were taken at the Uni-Pixel facility, and also a date stamp of 3/21. But then the other
photos have very limited exif data and no GPS coordinates or date, and one photo - the "broken line" photo which is
arguably the most damning - has no exif data whatsoever! If all of those pics were taken at the same time with the
same camera during a visit to Uni-Pixel, then they would all have the same exif data. Even if they were taken with
different cameras, not all of which were equipped with GPS, they should all still contain the date, time, camera make
& model, etc.

And anybody knows that exif data can be easily edited in Photoshop or just about any other photo editing software. If
you take a close look at the exif data from the first pic you will see that it has a "last modified" date of 3/21/2013, and
the version of the program used to modify the file was "6.0.1". Well guess which popular photo-editing program has a
version 6.0.1? Yup, Photoshop. And you don't use Photoshop to simply crop or rotate pictures, you use it to materially
edit them, such as editing their exif data.


I also find it odd that all of the exif data is present in the first two pictures except for two obvious bits - the camera
make & model. Why is that odd? Well, the fact that the pic supposedly has embedded GPS coordinates would
indicate that it was either take with a cell phone (most of which have geo-tagging) or a fairly new compact or SLR
camera which has built-in GPS. And any camera that I have owned in the past 10 years since before geo-tagging
started (which has to be 30+; I'm a photo hobbyist) will list the camera make & model in the exif data. Yet that is
somehow missing from those pics. Incriminating evidence? Hardly. Buy very suspicious since it further points to the
fact that the exif data was most likely added/modified.


The other interesting thing is the date that the picture was edited with Photoshop - 3/21/2013 at 2:17. At the start of
this piece you mention that a few weeks ago you wrote an article questioning why Kodak had never disclosed a K-8
article regarding their partnership with UniPixel, and it was your deduction that it was probably because Kodak doesn't
think much of Uni-Pixel's technology. Yet in that article you didn't make any mention of ever having visited their
facilities yourself, or having sampled or tested the product first hand to know it doesn't work, which I'm sure you would
have mentioned if it had taken place 2 months prior and was such damning evidence. That article simply focused on
your suspicion due to the lack of a K-8 filing. So one would obviously make the assumption that your visit must have
taken place at some point between the article dated 5/19 and the follow-up one dated 5/31, right? Well then how do
you explain a picture with a date of 3/21 which you supposedly took while on a tour of the Uni-Pixel facility? And let's
not forget that only the first two pics even have dates in them, the others do not. I sure wish that the pic showing the
phone in the background with a time of 2:12 had a date stamp, because 1) if the date was the same as the first pic,
then you obviously couldn't have been at Uni-Pixel taking pics at 2:12 and then editing them with Photoshop 2:17; and
2) if the date was later than 3/21 then it would prove that the pics were not taken at the same time as claimed in this
article. Either way, having a date in that pic with the phone showing the time would be extremely incriminating, so
maybe that's why it was removed it from the exif data?


Bottom line: This entire article is based on nothing more than these photos that are shown, which are all very, very
suspicious. And if the photos are suspect, then obviously everything claimed in relation to them must be taken with
very small grain of salt. If you had a video of your findings, or if you had legitimate time/date/GPS stamped unaltered
photos, that would be different. But hacked up, zoomed-in, exif-edited, photoshopped photos prove absolutely
NOTHING. Many claims have been made against these photos in the comments, yet you have never once offered to
post the unaltered originals. Obviously you have something to hide.


And regarding your article about the SEC's reply to your inquiries - maybe that was just their way of giving you the
bird and telling you that they don't have to give you sh*t if they don't want to.


BTW - I have no position, but just can't help but laugh at an the obvious smear campaign that you have started
against UNXL. I'm guessing you started a short position on or around 5/19, right before you posted your first anti-
UNXL article (after not posting an article on SA in nearly 2 years and being completely inactive for 8 months)?

How about analyzing UNXL picture on their site and let me know your findings.

The broken-line photo, if not fake one, is meaningless for me. This kind of problem should be fixable.


I will become a buyer when it drops to $10.00. Friday's low was $11.39, not far from $10.00. Stock is still in downtrend
in lower lows and lower highs.

Now, the trend is changing as most shorts have been covering & leaving this last week. The other trend is less short
bash trash & totally erroneous slanted articles as this piece, as more very positive news keeps coming in. The short
fat-party days are numbered. Be ready for upward trend & spikes.
