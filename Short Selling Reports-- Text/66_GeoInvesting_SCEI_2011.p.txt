Sino Clean Energy
(SCEI)
Investigatory
Report -
Overstated
Revenues?
Apr. 26, 2011 2:16 PM ET13 comments


We recently completed on-the-ground due diligence on Sino Clean Energy
(NASDAQ: SCEI) regarding its Tongchuan facility and uncovered what we
consider to be substantial misrepresentations by the company about its
operations. As originally indicated in an earlier alert, we currently have a short
position in SCEI.


GeoTeam's Findings


What follows are some highlights of our findings:


1. Facility and Production Lines: Why Aren't They Operating?


Our investigators visited SCEI's Tongchuan facility at Wangjiabian Village,
Dongjiahe Town, Yaozhou District, Tongchuan Shaanxi Province. SCEI claims to
have three production lines in this facility that provide a total capacity of
550,000 tons.See page 19 of the 2010 10-K


However, our investigators relayed that there is likely only one production line
in operation.

Geoinvesting,


Are you are a real company? I can't find
public records of your business

I can't find you or the Market's Edge


Here is a national search engine for the
Better Business Bureau:


www.bbb.org/us/Find-Bu......


I can't find youor the Market's Edge here.


I also have access to Hoover's Online and
cannot find you there.


I cannot find you on Manta either:

Author’s reply »  Have you tried to call
us? The number is on our website. Are
you afraid that you may be wrong?


We also invite you to visit our office in
Skippack, PA. It's funny that you can
question the legitimacy of our existence
without actually going about it in a
more methodical way.


The sites you mention..Obviously not
trusted/complete sources since we have
a PHYSICAL address in a relatively new
corporate park and we are a registered
LLC. I really don't need to go that much
further in explaining this since I am

obviously dealing with a biased
commenter. You can do a little better
than browsing a few websites.

Oh, the irony!! Someone calls you
(Geoinvesting) out for fraud, simply by
doing an hour of due diligence on your
website.


You reply stating that you're real and
that person should've called your
offices, or visited your offices to get
better information instead of calling
fraud the first minute they have.


Wow Maj, sound familiar?? Wonder if
you should've called the company
before calling them fraud?

Author’s reply »  There's no irony, and
you actually made the point FOR us!.
We visit the companies. It doesn't get
much more personal than that. You
apparently haven't been following the
events.

Geoinvesting is a real company. They are
good at using the promise to sell inside
information to their subscribers so they
can trade on it prior to disclosing it.


Trust me, these individuals that buy the
information wtih subscriptions to their site
have made money.

Ridcorruption -


To verify there existence you should talk to
the starbucks around the corner and see
what the store clerk has to say about their
operation.


I am sure he can provide insight if they
pay their taxes, etc.

I suppose when you are
investigating/busting one of your many
frauds, you speak solely to management of
said targets?


02 May 2011, 08:03 AM


Arthur_Big
Nostores - to answer your question. No.
I don't speak solely to management,
but they surely are a resource.


In the latest complaint i sent to the SEC
I made it very clear too look at the hit
pieces and for them to determine if
these authors are trying to spin the
data to the negative and throwing 50 to
60 claims in there when easily 48 to 58
would be defendable with a simple
conversation with the company, its
counsel, the people on the ground. This
is not being done because they are
looking to manipulate.


15 Jun 2011, 09:16 AM


nostores
Dude, you suck at counting. Out of 50
claims the hit rates have been well over
50%. The accuracy of crap IB's like
Rodman, GH, Roth has been way lower.


SCEI responded with fake videos. What
is the point in talking to their CEO?
CBEH reopened on the pink sheets

today. Seems like there might have
been some validity to Al's claims huh?
PUDA is still halted.. Hmm maybe
something up there too. WATG is
halted. Who else has he covered DEER
and CHNG? They are both going pink
eventually. So two are halted, one is
delisted and two are doing such a great
job of defending themselves that their
share price has been cut in half since
his initial allegations and you are going
to claim a 90% failure rate on his
allegations.


You either have skin in the game in
trying to give moron longs hope or
you're just ridiculously delusional. Either
way you add no value to society with
this crusade of yours.

We will see what the SEC and
authorities think.


I received some new information from
your friends at Geoinvesting, will be
going live shortly with some new
information about on the ground
research.


I do have skin in the game. That skin
involves time, energy and money i
spent to host my website.

I've seen several articles about the SEC
looking into these frauds. I haven't seen
anything where they express concern
about the short sellers in the RTO
space. Any links?

Really? The SEC set up a portal to
discuss this very issue.

When SEC acts, what will they do with the
gains they take back from short sellers hit
piece authors and the fines they charge
them?

There are many programs in the US that
could use such donation, especially after
the tornadoes and flood damage.
