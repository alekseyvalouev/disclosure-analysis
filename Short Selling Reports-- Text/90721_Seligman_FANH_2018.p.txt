Summary

FANH


Fanhua is a Chinese company that trades in the US. It resells life insurance
through a commission/agency model via its network of sales agents, serving as an
outsourced distribution channel.


The company was previously known as CNinsure (prior ticker: CISG). CNinsure’s
stock crashed in 2010 after allegations of fraud, followed by an abrupt collapse in
its growth and margins.


After hovering between $5 and $8 for years, FANH’s stock exploded in late 2017
from $8 to a recent high of $37, for reasons that we believe are misguided and
unsustainable.


We are troubled by the company’s business practices, which we believe are
reminiscent of those alleged in 2010. The last time investors bought stock at these
levels, it declined 85%.

We note further accounting discrepancies in the Q2 results last week, red flags that
we believe typically appear near a tipping point.

Fanhua is a Chinese company that trades in the US via an ADR. It resells life insurance
through an agency/commission model via a network of sales agents, serving as an
outsourced sales channel for sub-scale insurers. The company claims to have 631,000
sales agents and has been characterized as “China’s leading independent insurance
distribution channel” in a sell-side report.1


Unknown to some investors, Fanhua was previously known as CNinsure (prior ticker:
CISG), and now trades under a new name and ticker. The corporate name change may
make it difficult for investors to discern the company’s checkered and turbulent past.
CNinsure’s stock crashed in the wake of allegations of fraud, followed by an abrupt
collapse in its growth rate and margins. The company went public in the US in 2007 and
peaked in 2010 at $28/ADR, before falling to $5 after a research firm published a series
of meticulously detailed reports, similar to reports that exposed companies such as
Sino-Forest, Orient Paper, and others during the offshore reverse-merger wave earlier
this decade. Shareholders alleged that the CEO and CFO engaged in “a fraudulent
scheme and course of conduct that operated as fraud.”2


CISG became an abandoned stock and hovered between $5 and $8 for years, an
impressive feat relative to the de-listings and bankruptcies among its cohort. The
company then changed its name to Fanhua in December 2016. The name change
initially had little effect, but the stock picked up steam when the company re-gained sell-
side coverage by a prominent US bank in late 2017. As the company re-acquired a
measure of institutional sponsorship and validation, the share price exploded. In the
past year, the stock has risen from about $8/share to a recent high of $37 in June 2018
– a remarkable, parabolic move for a stock that until recently was orphaned and traded
below the value of its cash for long stretches of the past seven years.3

Based on due diligence of SAIC filings and other public information, we are deeply
concerned about the company’s business practices. We believe that these practices
bear a worrisome resemblance to those alleged in 2010, and that they have intensified
as the stock has recently plateaued. Our concerns center on the following:


Transferring cash to insiders via related-party transactions;


Overstating the size of its operations;


Acquiring companies from undisclosed related parties in suspicious
transactions;


Reporting questionable revenues and earnings, with sharply elevated
receivables to a firm not disclosed as a related party;


Discrepancies between earnings and cash flows;


Involvement with individuals who have been sanctioned by regulators in
Hong Kong or who are linked to companies with histories of embezzlement,
de-listing, bankruptcy, or SEC prosecution;


High dependence on questionable partners/customers, in this case ones that
are a focus of regulatory action in China.


Given FANH’s history and current dynamics, our target price is $5.49 per ADS, a 79%
decline from its last close. We believe shares may be worth $0. The last time
investors purchased stock at these levels, it declined 85%. We believe a similar
outcome is brewing. In particular, we note further accounting discrepancies in the
most recent quarter, reported last week on August 20, that lead us to question the
reported results. Accounts receivable spiked and are up 52% year-over-year while
total revenues are down 4%. The company reported rising margins and the highest
EBIT and earnings in a year, yet operating cash flows are negative – red flags that
typically appear near a tipping point.
