Zoompass	Holdings:	Buyer	Beware
May	25,	2017	2:20	PM	ET11	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


Summary


Shares	are	inflated	due	in	part	to	an	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign	that	may
end	soon.


The	company's	original	corporate	name	appears	in	an	SEC	subpoena	related	to
questionable	registration	statements.


OTCMarkets.com	has	already	designated	the	stock	as	"Caveat	Emptor"	aka	Buyer
Beware.


The	company's	CEO	has	failed	to	disclose	his	relationship	with	another	promoted
penny	stock.


(Editor's	Note:	This	article	was	updated	on	6/30/2017	to	include	a	statement	from	Creative
Direct	Marketing	Group.)


Zoompass	Holdings,	Inc.	(OTCPK:ZPAS)	has	been	one	of	the	top	performing	and	most
actively	traded	micro-cap	stocks	of	2017.	During	the	past	several	months,	shares	of
Zoompass	have	gone	from	almost	complete	dormancy	to	trading	millions	of	shares	while
increasing	in	share	price	by	as	much	as	150%.


However,	we	believe	that	the	recent	move	in	share	price	is	completely	unwarranted	and	is
related	to	an	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign	whereby	an	advertising	budget	of	nearly
$2	million	is	being	spent	on	a	promotional	newsletter	"touting	the	Company	and
encouraging	investors	to	purchase	the	Company's	common	stock",	as	described	in	a
recent	press	release.


The	company	was	recently	designed	as	"Caveat	Emptor"	on	OTCMarkets.com	and	its
former	name,	UVIC,	Inc.,	appears	in	a	subpoena	issued	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange
Commission	related	to	a	number	of	questionable	S-1	registration	statements	issued	by
prohibited	attorney	Adam	S.	Tracy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4076519-zoompass-holdings-buyer-beware 2/10


For	all	of	the	reasons	outlined	in	this	report,	we	believe	that	shares	of	Zoompass	could	fall
by	at	least	56%	in	the	short	term.


Company	Profile


Zoompass	is	a	financial	services	company	that	provides	businesses	with	solutions	to	help
digitize	financial	transactions.	The	company	offers	prepaid	debit	cards,	member	reward
systems	and	an	electronic	payment	platform	that	enables	businesses	to	provide	their
customers	with	a	white	label	mobile	wallet.


According	to	the	company's	most	recent	annual	report,	from	the	date	of	incorporation
through	December	31,	2016,	it	has	generated	gross	revenues	totaling	$284,345	and	has
incurred	net	losses	totaling	almost	$14	million.


Despite	the	company	boasting	an	increase	in	net	revenues	to	just	$254,683	in	the	most
recent	quarter	ending	March	31,	2017,	and	announcing	an	expectation	to	receive
commissions	in	an	undisclosed	amount	related	to	a	purchase	order	with	an	undisclosed
third	party,	it	currently	trades	with	a	market	cap	of	over	$117,000,000,	based	on
39,680,731	shares	outstanding	as	of	April	21,	2017,	and	a	share	price	of	$2.95.


Shares	of	Zoompass	have	increased	from	about	$1.50	per	share	to	as	high	as	$3.75	per
share	during	the	past	three	months	with	trading	volume	increasing	significantly.	Although
difficult	to	prove,	we	believe	that	the	main	contributor	to	the	stock's	recent	performance	is
not	the	company's	recent	results	but	rather	an	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign.


Recent	Company	Announcements


Below	we	have	listed	all	of	the	company's	announcements	made	during	the	past	several
months.	In	our	opinion,	although	these	press	releases	occasionally	sound	upbeat,	they	fail
to	reference	any	specific	material	numbers	that	could	justify	the	recent	increase	in	market
cap	to	nearly	$117	million:

In	our	opinion,	the	company's	press	releases	above	lack	substance.	For	example,	in	the
company's	operational	and	corporate	update,	it	referenced	agreements	with	SYNNEX
Canada	Limited,	SKY	Devices	LLC	and	U-Vend	Group,	but	failed	to	mention	specific
terms	and	conditions.


Volatility	Attributed	To	Stock	Promotion


To	date,	we	have	discovered	advertisements	on	Google	and	Yahoo	Finance	that	direct
visitors	to	a	website	promoting	Zoompass	here.


In	true	promotional	form,	the	website	features	a	glaring	report	by	Editor	Rick	Currin	that	is
quick	to	point	out	industry	statistics	and	million	dollar	figures	relating	to	"financial
technology"	while	lacking	substance	relating	to	the	company's	internal	business
operations.


However,	the	most	important	dollar	amount	is	buried	within	the	legal	disclaimer:

7/18/2019 Zoompass Holdings: Buyer Beware - Zoompass Holdings, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ZPAS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4076519-zoompass-holdings-buyer-beware 4/10


The	website	is	actually	a	tout	sheet	whereby	a	third	party	(Sargon	Finance	SA)	paid
almost	$2	million	"to	build	investor	awareness,"	or	in	other	words	to	promote	shares	of	the
ZPAS	stock	to	unsuspecting	buyers.


It	is	our	opinion	that	the	recent	run-up	in	Zoompass	is	primarily	attributed	to	this	nearly	$2
million	stock	promotion	campaign.	As	we	have	described	in	past	reports,	shares	of	heavily
promoted	stocks	like	Zoompass	are	temporarily	inflated	during	the	promotional	campaign
and	almost	always	crash	in	the	short	term.


We	have	found	the	smoking	gun	evidence	linking	Zoompass	to	another	heavily	promoted
stock,	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.	(OTCPK:PNAT),	and	believe	that	the	two	stocks	will	behave
similarly.	Specifically,	we	believe	that	shares	of	ZPAS	will	decline	by	50-70%	from
prevailing	market	prices	similar	to	the	way	Pura	Naturals	traded	when	its	stock	promotion
campaign	topped	out.


Zoompass	&	Pura	Naturals:	Nearly	Identical	Promotional	Campaigns


Zoompass	and	Pura	Naturals	have	been	the	subject	to	promotional	campaigns	that	are	so
similar	in	nature	that	we	believe	it	is	not	unreasonable	to	anticipate	the	two	stocks
behaving	similarly,	at	least	in	the	short	term.	For	Zoompass,	this	could	mean	a	sharp
decline	of	more	than	50%	in	the	short	term.


Below	we	have	outlined	three	of	the	most	brazen	similarities	between	the	two	stock
promotion	campaigns:


1.	Creative	Direct	Marketing	Group


Creative	Direct	Marketing	Group	is	an	advertising	and	digital	marketing	agency	located	in
Southern	California	that	appears	to	be	at	least	partially	responsible	for	the	investor
awareness	ad	campaigns	targeting	both	Zoompass	Holdings,	Inc.	and	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.


In	addition	to	the	similar	website	layouts	and	domain	names	used	for	both	the	Zoompass
stock	promotion	(Zoompassinvestor.com)	and	Pura	Naturals	stock	promotion
(Purainvestor.com),	you	can	find	direct	evidence	connecting	Creative	Direct	Marketing
Group	to	both	stock	promotion	advertisements.


(UPDATE	6/30/2017	4:35	p.m.:	Representatives	of	Creative	Direct	Marketing	Group	have
provided	Seeking	Alpha	with	the	following	statement:

Creative	Direct	Marketing	Group	actually	won	an	award	for	"Best	Investor	Relations
Online	Campaign"	for	its	work	with	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.	and	the	ad	agency	is	referenced	in
the	legal	disclaimer	of	the	PNAT	promotional	website:


Coincidentally,	both	Zoompass	Holdings	and	Pura	Naturals	were	subject	to	stock
promotion	campaigns	with	budgets	just	shy	of	$2	million	managed	at	least	in	part	by
Creative	Direct	Marketing	Group.


2.	The	Denial	of	Involvement


On	May	9,	2017,	Zoompass	issued	a	press	release	regarding	a	promotional	newsletter
touting	the	company's	stock.	Compare	Zoompass's	press	release	with	the	one	issued	by
Pura	Naturals	on	January	19,	2017:


Zoompass	Issues	Statement	About	Promotional	Activity	Concerning	Its	Common
Stock
Pura	Naturals,	Inc.	Issues	Statement	About	Promotional	Activity	Concerning	Its
Common	Stock


The	two	company-issued	press	releases	above	have	many	sections	that	are	almost
identical	in	context	with	some	areas	copied	verbatim.	The	two	most	likely	explanations	for
these	similar	press	releases	is	either	plagiarism	or	a	related	party	being	responsible	for
the	authoring	of	both	companies'	press	releases.	Based	on	all	of	our	other	findings,	we
believe	the	likelihood	of	the	latter	is	very	high.


3.	The	Chart	Patterns


Below	is	a	historical	stock	chart	for	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.	for	the	relevant	time	period	when
its	stock	was	subjected	to	a	promotion	campaign.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4076519-zoompass-holdings-buyer-beware 7/10


Compare	the	chart	above	with	the	current	stock	chart	for	Zoompass	and	you	will	notice
that	to	date	the	charts	are	nearly	identical.


Both	stocks	were	dormant	for	months	and	traded	at	approximately	$1.50	per	share.	Then,
all	of	a	sudden,	each	stock's	volume	spiked	right	around	the	time	when	promotional
newsletter	campaigns	began	surfacing	on	the	Internet.	After	each	stock	climbed	for	about
25	trading	days,	share	prices	hit	$3.75	and	$3.64,	respectively.	Next,	both	stocks
plummeted	by	more	than	50%	before	bouncing.


Pura	Naturals	shares	bounced	all	the	way	back	to	$3.45	but	failed	to	break	out	to	new	all-
time	highs.	In	the	20	trading	days	that	followed,	the	stock	fell	by	as	much	as	56%.


Although	in	the	long	term	each	company's	stock	will	be	more	reflective	of	the	successes	or
failures	of	each	operating	business,	in	the	short	term,	it	is	our	opinion	that	the	stock	chart
for	Zoompass	Holdings	is	driven	more	by	the	current	promotional	campaign	than	by
internal	business	operations	and	company	news	releases.	Since	the	promotional
campaign	itself	along	with	the	stock	chart	closely	resembles	the	promotional	campaign
and	stock	chart	for	Pura	Naturals,	we	believe	that	the	two	will	continue	to	act	similar	in	the
short	term.	For	Zoompass,	this	could	mean	an	imminent	collapse	of	56%	in	the	short	term.


Zoompass	&	Pura	Naturals:	More	Connections	Between	The	Two

In	addition	to	the	resemblances	between	the	stock	promotion	campaigns	subjected	to
Zoompass	and	Pura	Naturals,	there	are	also	internal	examples	that	demonstrate	how	the
companies	themselves	may	be	connected.


Robert	"Rob"	Lee


Robert	"Rob"	Lee	has	maintained	the	position	of	chief	executive	officer	and	director	of
Zoompass	Holdings,	Inc.	since	August	2016.	In	addition	to	previously	serving	as	the
president	and	CEO	of	a	company	that	eventually	went	into	receivership,	Lee	has	"focused
on	the	financing	and	restructuring	of	various	private	entities":


One	career	endeavor	apparently	missing	from	Robert	Lee's	bio	involves	an	obscure
reference	to	Lee	within	a	share	exchange	agreement	related	to	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.	found
in	a	Form	8-K	filed	on	July	26,	2016:


Although	we	have	been	unable	to	reach	a	representative	of	Zoompass	to	clarify	Robert
Lee's	full	involvement	with	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.,	a	Reuters	company	profile	page	lists
Robert	Lee	as	being	appointed	as	a	director	to	Pura	Naturals	in	April	2016:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4076519-zoompass-holdings-buyer-beware 9/10


In	fact,	we	believe	there	is	a	possibility	that	Robert	Lee	may	in	fact	also	be	the	chief
executive	officer	of	Pura	Natural,	Inc.	under	the	name	Robert	Doherty.


Obscure	Executive	Officer	Listed	In	Zoompass's	Annual	Report


Smoking	gun	evidence	connecting	Zoompass	to	Pura	Naturals	can	be	seen	on	page	24	of
ZPAS's	most	recent	Annual	Report	filed	on	April	24,	2017.	In	the	list	of	executive	officers
section,	"Robert	Doherty"	is	listed	as	director	and	chief	executive	officer	of	Zoompass
Holdings:


Robert	Doherty	also	happens	to	be	listed	as	the	chief	executive	officer	for	Pura	Naturals,
Inc.	in	the	company's	most	recent	Annual	Report:


Either	there	was	a	highly	unusual	typo	in	the	Zoompass	annual	report	that	mistakenly
listed	Pura	Naturals	CEO	as	its	own	or	Robert	Lee	and	Robert	Doherty	may	be	the	same
individual.	According	to	a	Bloomberg	biography,	the	chief	executive	officer	for	Zoompass
Holdings,	Inc.	is	Robert	Doherty	Lee.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4076519-zoompass-holdings-buyer-beware 10/10


If	Robert	Doherty	Lee	is	serving	dual	roles	as	both	the	chief	executive	officer	of	Zoompass
Holdings,	Inc.	and	Pura	Naturals,	Inc.,	we	believe	that	investors	should	remain	highly
suspicious	of	the	failure	to	disclose	this	relevant	information	in	the	SEC	filings.


Conclusion


Our	trading	thesis	is	based	on	the	belief	that	the	recent	surge	in	share	price	for	Zoompass
Holdings,	Inc.	is	more	heavily	attributed	to	an	ongoing	stock	promotion	campaign	rather
than	the	company's	recent	operating	results.	As	we	have	explained,	although	the
company	has	recently	announced	press	releases	that	could	be	perceived	positively,	they
lack	substance	and	are	very	unlikely	to	be	responsible	for	the	recent	meteoric	rise	in	the
Zoompass	stock.


If	the	stock's	short-term	price	fluctuation	is	driven	primarily	by	the	stock	promotion	and	if
Zoompass	and	Pura	Naturals	are	related	to	the	extent	that	we	have	outlined	in	this	report,
we	believe	that	Zoompass	shares	will	trade	comparatively	to	how	Pura	Naturals	traded
when	its	own	stock	was	subject	to	a	very	similar	promotion.	Specifically,	this	would	mean
that	Zoompass	shares	could	decline	by	56%	in	as	little	as	20	trading	days.
