Growlife: Why It Got Halted And What You Need To Know Before
Trading Resumes On Friday, April 25th
Apr. 25, 2014 9:03 AM ET258 comments
by: The Emperor Has No Clothes


Summary


PHOT shares are highly likely to be down 60-90% when trading resumes; with the
potential for a permanent drop..


There has been a variety of questionable insider share sales in the past few weeks..


Two members of management received compensation which represented ~24% of
2013 revenues, despite the company’s profitability deteriorating year-over-year..


One director has resigned from the board..


FINRA had previously warned investors about scams in the marijuana space; PHOT
is the fifth marijuana stock to be halted this year..


Summary


The purpose of this post is to set out relevant facts that should be considered in advance
of the Growlife Inc's (OTC:OTCQB:PHOT) resumption of trading on Apr 24, 2014. On Apr
10, 2014, PHOT was halted by the SEC for two weeks as a result of "questions that
have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of information in the
marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions in PHOT's common stock".
This is only 15 days after Advanced Cannabis Solutions (OTC:OTCQB:CANN) was halted
on Mar 27, 2014 "due to a lack of current and accurate information concerning the
securities of Advanced Cannabis". It is my view that PHOT may fall 60-90% when trading
resumes and thereafter. This post further highlights that given questions with its financials,
poor capital allocation decisions and lost partnerships - that PHOT has concerns above
and beyond the SEC halt. The halt simply foreshadows greater underlying business
issues.


This article is important in the context of PHOT but also in the context of the broader comp
space. Recall that FINRA warned investors about potential stock scams in the marijuana
space in January 2014. PHOT's underlying business issues will hurt the momentum that
has been rich for cannabis players over the past few months. Given the shareholder base
of PHOT, on resumption of trading, there may be a significant amount of retail investors

that will be turned off from the marijuana industry. Consider the impact on PHOT's comps
whom may also be negatively impacted: Terra Tech (OTC:OTCQX:TRTC), Greengro
Technologies Inc (OTC:OTCPK:GRNH), Full Circle Capital Corp (NASDAQ:FULL),
Medbox Inc (OTC:MDBX), Nuvilex Inc (OTC:NVLX) and Advanced Cannabis Solutions .


PHOT shares are expected to drop between 60% and 90% once trading resumes


There have been at least four halts since the beginning of March 2014 in the marijuana
industry which include Advanced Cannabis Solutions , Citadel EFT Inc (OTC:
OTC:CDFT), Petrotech Oil & Gas Inc (OTC:OTC:PTOG) and Aventura Equities Inc
(OTC:OTC:AVNE).


It appears that a drop of between 60% and 90% is likely on Friday. Although, it is my
view that shares will trade at a 90% discount to its last trading price. This is because
PHOT's halt was the result of potentially manipulative transactions which is above and
beyond the accuracy and adequacy issues that its peers (CDFT, PTOG and AVNE) were
halted for. CANN's trading resumption (that resulted in a 38% drop in share price) is not
as relevant given the softer language used by the SEC compared to CDFT, PTOG and
AVNE ("due to a lack of current and accurate information"). PHOT specifically
acknowledges a drop is likely with its response to the halt "If history is any guide, there is
likely to be a negative impact to GrowLife shares when trading is allowed to
resume".


These halts also hurt the potential of the industry and its players as aforementioned.


There are a variety of "potentially manipulative transactions" that the SEC may have
scrutinized


In the last few weeks, there have been many questionable moves made by PHOT and its
management. The company paid select directors in shares at a significant discount to
trading prices. Two members of management received compensation which represented
~24% of 2013 revenues. To top it all off, insiders sold material amounts of shares and
major partners have walked away from PHOT. These underlying business concerns not
only highlight the potential reason for the halt but also put into question the long-term
potential of PHOT.

5/19/2018 Growlife: Why It Got Halted And What You Need To Know Before Trading Resumes On Friday, April 25th - Growlife Inc. (OTCMKTS:PHO…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2165283-growlife-why-it-got-halted-and-what-you-need-to-know-before-trading-resumes-on-friday-april-25th 3/45


On March 31, 2014, in conjunction with the release of its 2013 10-k filing, directors (Tony
Ciabatonni, Eric Shevin, Alan Hammer and Jeff Giarraputo) were paid two million shares
at a price of $0.02 per share which constitutes a ~97% discount to the then trading price
(of $0.58). How was a valuation that is over 90% below trading value established? How
can the company continue to grant shares to insiders at the same price for over a year
with material changes in the market and trading value of the underlying equity?


Tony Ciabatonni (Director), Eric Shevin (Former Director), Alan Hammer (Director), and
Jeff Giarraputo (Director) were the recipients of 500,000 shares each. Prior to receiving
these shares, Tony and Jeff had only 72k shares each. I note that the majority have these
shares were granted at $0.02 per share.


There is also questionability with regards to compensation and the health of the
company's financials. How appropriate is it that the CEO (Sterling Scott) and CFO (John
Genesi, who was only appointed mid-year in July 2013) were paid compensation of $1.1
million when the company only had $4.9 million of sales? This implies that two members
of the company were compensated ~24% of total revenue alone. Moving on to the
financials, the company lost $21 million in 2013 which is ten times its loss from 2012. I
note that warrant expense (of $7.0 million) and interest expense (of $5.3 million) were
both individually greater than 2013 revenues. With the company's financials deteriorating,
this hardly seems like a company with good capital allocation decisions or sound
financials. It is my view that these concerns will lead to a long-term negative drag for
PHOT and its business.


With a valuation of over $430 million (based on 865.1 million fully diluted shares
outstanding - from its 2013 10k), PHOT trades at just under ~90x 2013 sales. This is just
one of the many reasons that I think that the drop in PHOT's price on April 24th will be
justified, SEC halt or not.


Within the PHOT 2013 10-k, the company highlighted that four insiders had not filed form
3's on a timely basis. In addition, 11 of 15 insiders had not filed form 4's on a timely basis.

Only a few days later on Apr 1, 2014, Eric Shevin (Director) resigned from the Board.
Perhaps he was waiting to receive these shares before he departed? His resignation also
afforded him the ability to liquidate his holdings without any requirement to file insider
transactions. A director exiting the business is often a sign of bigger problems at play
within the business.


On Apr 4, 2014, the president of the company Robert Hunt sold 1.8 million shares:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2165283-growlife-why-it-got-halted-and-what-you-need-to-know-before-trading-resumes-on-friday-april-25th 5/45


You can see that the move from 15.7 million shares he held to 13.8 million in the matter of
a day (highlighted in red).


Not surprising that the CEO, Sterling Scott, filed the sale of 5.7 million shares for his wife
(Wedam Elisabeth) on Apr 9, 2014. Along with the recent director resignation, the sales by
Robert Hunt (President) and Sterling Scott (NYSE:CEO) may be signs of little long-term
value in the business.


One of the key aspects of PHOT's future potential related to its agreement with CEN
Biotech and RXNB. CEN had been approved to build a medical marijuana growing facility
in Canada which could produce 1.3 million pounds of dried marijuana annually. It is noted
that CEN is a subsidiary of Creative Edge Nutrition (OTC:OTC:FITX). On Apr 11, 2014,
both CEN Biotech and RXNB rescinded all agreements and terminated their relationship
with PHOT further hampering Growlife's potential at becoming a seasoned marijuana
player. PHOT's potential partners (CEN Biotech and RXNB) obviously realized, that the
shares they were to receive in consideration for the transaction (over 500 million shares
were to be issued in total), would be close to worthless when PHOT's shares resume
trading. The loss of this deal is a hard blow for PHOT in the medium-term.


On Apr 21, 2014, if PHOT did not have enough issues on its plate, Tripp Levy PLLC
announced a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of PHOT securities between
Nov 14, 2013 and Apr 9, 2014.


Conclusion


Despite responding to "thousands of investor inquiries by phone and email arising from
the trading halt", PHOT did not respond to a draft version of this post.


Based on current information, PHOT is likely to trade at a fraction of its valuation in the
medium to long-term. In terms of its comps, they will also be hurt with a less euphoric
retail investor base.


With all this potential adverse activity in close proximity, an SEC halt is starting to make
sense and PHOT's long-term potential is seriously in question. What was PHOT's
response to the SEC halt? "The answer is that we simply do not know". My response is
that once trading resumes, it is highly likely that the stock is going down…big.

Kinda sounds like "cleared" to me... http://on.wsj.com/1lNjN3m 
"Below, you will find candid responses to key questions regarding the SEC's decision to temporarily halt, and
now support the resumption, of trading of GrowLife's stock." I don't think the SEC would "support the
resumption of trading" if the company hadn't been "cleared". Trading would still be halted if there was an
investigation or some infraction pending. They're clear.


27 Apr 2014, 11:41 PM


The_Ripper
The SEC can only suspend for 2 weeks. Then they start trading on the grey market. Unless you can post an
official statement form the SEC saying they were cleared then they aren't.

I didn't learn much from this. I have spent the past two weeks trying to find out what is going on to no avail. I have
spoken with the SEC, the company, some Seeking Alpha contributors who have been negative on the name, the
former director, customers of the company, national media journalists, competitors, etc., and no one has been able to
shed insight. Yes, the stock will be down today. It doesn't take a genius to arrive at that conclusion. Longer-term,
PHOT is likely to recover in my view.

Alan, as the MJ expert, we need to hear some facts about what really happened with PHOT.

As Alan and Growlife have mentioned SEC has not released any facts on why they halted trading. My
assumption is they wanted to slow down the entire MJ sector. Now the resurrection has begun....PHOT
LONG!!!


25 Apr 2014, 10:23 AM


fidelissemper
I share your view...keep up the good work Alan. One of the few trustworthy people in this space. You may not
always be right but IMO you are honest and who can always be right anyway? I'm just glad we are basically
cleared and back on the OTCBB...also with ER coming next month and the hint at news next week from the
CEO...IMO it's all good.


25 Apr 2014, 10:43 AM


neuroticg
i concur. this article is just speculation based on common sense. where is the real information regarding the
reasons behind the halt? there is no evidence to support whether there was or wasn't fraud. to me, the lack of
concrete information suggests that there is none. this may be a good sign for a phot recovery.


25 Apr 2014, 11:05 AM

Really Alan? They Get suspended and kicked to the grey market and you are still pumping this company? All
I can say is WOW.


25 Apr 2014, 09:44 PM

Pumping? I comment on an article and say what I believe, and you call that pumping? What, in your view, did
PHOT do to justify suspension?


25 Apr 2014, 09:45 PM


The_Ripper
My view of what they did to get suspended is irrelevant. The fact is they got suspended and now on the grey
market.


25 Apr 2014, 09:51 PM


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
Well, I guess the concept of due process means nothing to you. The company asserts that the suspension
was tied to activities of a third-party. I hope I am never accused of something that goes to a jury upon which
you sit!

If you can find any other information that was published, feel free to share it here, otherwise that is kind of all
we have to go on. If they were being investigated for doing something wrong, and said, "The SEC said we did
nothing wrong, it was their inquiry into a 3rd party's actions that caused this halt", don't you think the SEC
would correct them on that publicly?

Geesus, they don't halt stocks to "slow down a sector". That's the funniest thing I've read in weeks.

"slow down a sector". is exactly what did happened


28 Apr 2014, 11:23 AM


OPie415
if by "slow down" you mean people actually took a pause from believing all of the "glowing" swamp land
reviews of fake companies, then sure. When a bio pharm company tanks, and the sector sells off on it's own
without SEC help.............. well....

Good video. Although I am not partial to the way Mr Scott delivers his message, as I look past that, I am
confident that he is relaying all information to the shareholders and public that he is receiving from the SEC.
No one that I've read has discovered any fraudulent reason for the halt?! It's almost as if the SEC simply
decided to "run a test", threw a dart and it landed on PHOT!


I'd be lying to say 'I'm not skittish about buying more' but I'm certainly not selling any of my shares. This will
iron out, people will regain confidence and buy on this impending dip and be happy that they did.


Thanks for posting the link!

Agree 100%...and I wish they would let Rob Hunt represent instead of Scott but it is what it is...been long a

That's funny, I thought the presentation was brilliant. First one I've seen by Sterling Scott so I don't know if he
always comes across this calm and laid back but it was the right thing for the time. Brown somewhat old
fashioned suit and tie, slow calm delivery, little touch of the announcers arm at the end. Almost like your dad
or grandfather talking to you, very calming overall and absolutely brilliant given the situation both for investors
and potential clients.

That would be a good move...anything seems better then Scott...I am sure he is a nice guy and is bright but

Yup pretty much just like that...it has it's charm granted and one could argue he comes across as a everyday
kinda guy and not a slick operator but his communication skills are lacking IMO and kinda starts and stops in
mid sentence. We can do better...Rob Hunt, if you here him speak , is like night and day.

Looking forward to hearing/seeing Marco and Rob speak publicly. Darren, I appreciate everything that Mr
Scott says, his broken delivery could simply use some polishing. No need to debate the issue...the message
was very good ;-)


Alan, do you hear anything from the PHOT camp about where they may go from here? Will they pursue an
explanation from the SEC or implement damage control and just continue on?


Thanks


~Pete

Mr. Scott is an intelligent and articulate front man for Growlife. It's his company and he serves it well. 
I've seen earlier videos with Sterling Scott and his delivery is consistent and always metered and confident.

Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
PHOT will focus on executing. They will announce a new hire - nobody quit following the halt, and this new
guy is from GE Capital. I don't know what their SEC strategy is, but I don't expect that it is a good use of their
time to focus there.


25 Apr 2014, 07:54 PM

LOL, that video reminds me of Colbert show. I'll make one for you if you'd like. I wonder what homeless
shelter he stole the suit from

Be sure to let us know when there is evidence of real wrongdoing.


I do not think there is an investor here that does not understand the speculative nature of PHOT.


And it was not a coincidence that this stock was suspended over 4/20. I am sure that those at the SEC thought it was
cute.


But if there was a real issue, then the SEC has abdicated it's responsibilities by letting trading resume, have they not?


Marijuana is here to stay. There will be false starts and stops. We do not need government to sort things out. We can
do so ourselves.


25 Apr 2014, 09:20 AM


fidelissemper
Had a similar thought on the 4-20 date..go after PHOT , the big boy, and you affect them all.


25 Apr 2014, 10:47 AM


petenebraska
If that is the case, the SEC needs an enema to cleanse the grime from their halls. What ever happened to
'buyer beware'? Perform your own due diligence and invest according to your level of risk. The SEC already
posted the warnings for investors to fully discover a company before buying. There was no need for an
artificially concocted price correction?? Who provides oversight to the SEC that an investor could contact to
ask for a report about the reasoning behind this and any other SEC actions?


Interestingly, have you ever noticed that most of the postings to articles such as "the Emperor's" seem to
exclude the author and his subject altogether?? I sure hope he's not getting compensated by our
conversation on "his page"?! If so, I'm going to start submitting meaningless articles, then chat with all my
buddies about the weather!! ;-D

Have you called your broker? I have 3x now and all 3 different ones tell me it's OTCBB...a 3rd party handles
that part of the site and while I have both bitched and asked nicely for them to change it all they told me was
they would put in the request. Call Scottrade and ask for yourself. Do you really think 64 million shares by
11:30 would trade on the Greys? come on... I know you are not naive.

fidel, I am not naive, but 64,000,000 shares on the grey would not surprise me, I did call my broker (scottrade)
and was told grey stocks have to be traded through broker (telephone) there is a $32 fee + 1/2 % of the $
amount, so apparently any of you that want to trade in it you can do it at a price, and my understanding is
unless you put a ask/bid reasonable price it probably wont sell/buy, I don't know as I have no interest in the
grey market, but at least there is a way for some action good luck


25 Apr 2014, 02:09 PM

And what does that have to do with the price of Tea in China? You keep saying PHOT is a Grey Sheet stock
and it isn't...wow..you must think very little of people if you expect to get away with that..did you even ask
them what exchange it is traded on? It is traded on and remains on the OTCBB and is NOT a Grey sheet
stock and no matter how many times you dodge the truth here that is the fact. Who cares what a Grey sheet
needs cause PHOT is on the OTCBB. Unbelievable...

The purpose and the timing of this article on SA is very clear. Scare the shareholders to run for the hills, drop their
share prices so that the author can pick them up at 90% discount that he wishes to buy them at. Otherwise everything
in this article is unsubstantiated, wrong, old news and outright malicious. Good luck buddy, but I doubt you will have
any luck achieving your purpose.

Can someone explain how a stock can go down in price when it is not allowed to be traded? It was stopped at .50 and
opened at .15?????


25 Apr 2014, 09:40 AM


halfraw
In the event of a halt, all orders placed in the mean time are put on ice and are unfrozen the moment the
trading halt is lifted and the market opens. In most cases including this one, the vast majority of orders were
sell orders. These are processed immediately at market open. Since there's an overwhelming amount of sell
orders, buyers get to pick. Naturally they pick the lowest possible ask corresponding to their volume. This
results in an instant drop (or rise) to that trade price at open.

alance86
I am a bit confused by your statements regarding the director's compensation being the reason for the halt. Call me
naive, but the letter they released last night seemed pretty clear that the halt was in now way due to wrongdoing on
the part of Growlife, but rather 3rd party investors. Am I missing something?


"GrowLife understands that trading in GrowLife securities will resume during market hours on Friday, April 25, 2014.
The SEC has informed GrowLife through counsel that it is not the subject of an informal or formal investigation. The
SEC has not requested any documents from the company or its Board. Nor have they issued GrowLife any
subpoenas or broad requests for information.


It appears, from counsel's discussions with the SEC's staff, that the SEC suspension was prompted by concerns that
some 3rd party holder(s) of GrowLife stock may have been planning to engage in some form of manipulative
promotional activity. GrowLife does not have any more specific information regarding this matter. On behalf of
GrowLife, I can confirm that GrowLife was not involved in the planning of any potentially manipulative promotional
activity nor does it have any knowledge of any planned 3rd party promotional activity of any kind or type, proper or
improper. "

I called Scottrade a 4th time now and went to Corporate mostly for my own peace of mind. Tomorrow they will
have their site updated and it should say OTCBB. In a related note they were even taken by surprise cause
the MM's pulled a switch on them..at 8 AM it was all a GO and then by opening 9:30 the MM's said they would
not post the Bid/Ask and we had to call the broker to trade. It does not change the fact that it is on OTCBB
though. I even put an order in at 8 AM for 100k shares on line so I know it's true.Anyway Scottrade is well
aware of this and a simple phone call will tell you what is going on in that regard.

You've been made (short). Well, some noted you left out was that the SEC is not investigation the company or any of
the ownership; that the focus was on manipulative trades by outside parties out the PHOT's control. The SEC has not
requested the company to produce any additional documentation.


Oh, and PHOT has made a GE Capital hire.

formal investigation.

The bulls of PHOT brush off everything and say it will be higher down the road. The bears say it is going to zero. But
nobody knows. The first lesson I take from this, and the other 4 SEC halts in the pot sector, is IF you are going to play
this roulette wheel, spread out your bets. The second lesson is try to make money, not be right.

Shares will be down 60-90%. Try 58% @.21 cents currently. You can note the dumb shits who sold at $0.10, but I
don't even see a real-time bid/ask yet.


I'm getting more VAPE and PHOT, sorry SA, but you guys have been totally downplaying these two stocks. All these
stocks have had tremendous gains, and various SA articles just hammer that fact and point out they have huge
market evaluations.


Look at Amazon P/E. Look at Linkedin P/E.


I'd say even after Vapes doubling, it might be worth the double long.

Passion is good but can we please keep the name calling out of this. Ihub is a great place to vent your anger
and cast aspersions on other folks. Scottrade still shows PHOT as gray and still has no bids or asks. I do not
really know if it is gray or otcbb, but do know it was down 58.17% Friday, and do know the scottrade guys who
told fidelis this would be changed to show otcbb over the weekend got it wrong.


28 Apr 2014, 08:36 AM

with all due respect to any PHOT holders, my understanding is that any company that gets into the grey
market has to reapply to get back out of it to wherever they were (pink-otccbb-etc) and before I get beat up, I
do not follow all these different initials they give, as sometimes I call them penny stocks and sometimes I call
them pink, beyond that I have no knowledge or interest what they are called, except that what says grey
market is a stock that does not have a bid/ask price, and I can not buy or sell any of those without calling my
broker, so that is a stay away from stock for me

Well, over 35mm shares traded in 40 minutes. If it's all gray market, where you have to know people to transact
trading, how is this happening? Can someone decipher and explain the process? Thanks

You probably wont see a bid and ask on it. The other 4 pot stocks that were halted and re-opened earlier (all
have been trading at least 2 weeks) still do not have bids or asks. I do not know how stocks get off the grey
market and back to the pink sheets, but I would guess it takes alot of time.

MM's control the bid and ask and do not have to post it...sad but true. I have called 3x to my broker...spoke to
3 different brokers and a Manager at Scottrade. They related this info to me. they have no control over MM's
they say which boggles the mind but regardless and as far as them still having "Grey Market" on the site
under the symbol I was told that is controlled by a 3rd party and they would send in a request to have it
changed. The volume alone is telling but I urge all longs to call their brokers or anyone wanting to know for
sure and ask and if you want it changed tell them..make your voice heard. It's only a phone call..no need to
believe me ..just call

peted, a lot of grey market is traded by calling your broker (more expensive) my understanding, but I do not
trade in the grey markets, so hopefully someone able to trade it today will tell you and it may depend on who
your broker is, mine is scottrade

There is no bid/ask. You have to do a limit order. You will only see last trade price on PHOT. Keep in mind
there are millions of shares changing hands and just because it ticks to your limit price for a moment doesn't
mean you will be filled. There is a long line so to speak. The only thing you can do to increase your chance is
lower your limit. If you are determined to sell, you can keep reducing your price by 0.001 and eventually you
will fill if you aren't having any luck.

The SEC suspends trading in PHOT. The SEC does not ask for any documents from the company. The SEC does not
interview any PHOT management, directors, or employees. PHOT was not and is not under any formal or informal
SEC investigation. The SEC informs PHOT their concern about a "third party" which still remains unnamed. Well, why
doesn't the SEC just investigate this "unnamed third party"? Somebody at the SEC may have abused their position of
authority. Where is the SEC PHOT file? Who at the SEC initiated this trade suspension with, it appears, unjustifiable


cause? Requests through The Freedom Of Information Act may follow.

scare the investors, take away the financing, and thereby kill the company. All the feds are doing is supporting

the illegal marijuana cartels. And, they are preventing millions of sales tax dollars from state revenue. Are
there lobbyists hired by the drug cartels to convince congress to keep marijuana illegal and therefore the

All of you guys laughing...well lets just say, don't quit your day job...


And by the way, it's on the grey markets, and has been since Apr 25th =)


06 Jun 2014, 11:59 PM


Doyee51986
Peter Park, don't change the goal-posts. On April 25th you said it would go to .02 cents, and you were wrong
- it hasn't gone below .06.


It was .15 cents last week, so your .10 cents comment is kinda cherry-picked.


Way to point out it's on the grey markets -> do you want a medal for stating the obvious? Do you think your
comments are making people doubt their long position? People like you make me want to double down on
this company and companies like it because you act like a champion when all you did was possibly not lose
money.


Did you short PHOT on the way down? If not, quit acting like a G. I made 2 grand riding PHOT up, so if its .10
or .02, I frankly at this point don't care. However I do feel it will be going back to .50 cents by this time next
year. Which is why I'm holding the shares I bought after cashing the gains in my IRA. I'm not buying more
because it is on the grey sheets, and I got plenty of other gambles in this sector.

My feeling is that Eric Holder is leaning on the SEC. What a shame that Obama (whom I voted for) will at once joke
about smoking weed and then turn around to criticize.  
As I've commented on S.A. before, just as gay marriage is here to stay and prohibition will never again be - the cork is
out of the bottle. We can have our penny stock detractors; but, once the dust settles, the marijuana industry is here to
stay and the strong will survive. I'm of the opinion that Growlife will be one of those survivors and thrivers. The
company and Mr.Scott have been around for some time now and I see no end to this venerable company.

I own phot and lost big. If you do not know why the stock deserved to be halted, then you did not read the SA article.
Insiders got greedy and kept raiding the cookie jar. AB, if you are going to give so much weight to the Leadership
when evaluating a company, then you need to be a better judge of character. I suggest you give more weight to the
viability of the business plan.


25 Apr 2014, 07:59 PM


Trey Kelley
Yeah because the author really seemed to know what he was talking about...NOT. AB has done a great job
covering stocks associated with the MJ sector. The SEC halting trading of a company for apparently no
reason other than they can is not AB's fault. Do your own DD instead of blindly following people if you want to
throw blame around when you lose money, the only one you have to blame is yourself.


26 Apr 2014, 08:01 AM


fieldberen
Yes, but as a MJ tout, where is AB's article on this mess? It's kind of like the pink elephant in the room.

Most readers of SA (where you post comments) are not subscribers of your site. As an MJ expert - who had
been praising PHOT - it seems odd that you have not written an article on PHOT post-suspension. I write this
in a business sense, nothing personal.


28 Apr 2014, 12:28 PM


trabob
Dav, sorry about the loss, IMO the blame goes to the conservatives that do not want cannabis to go forward
from both in government and outside government but with influence in government  
(someone called them lobbyists) 
My understanding is there has been 5 pot stocks shut down on trading, and although I do not follow them I
have not read any of them being put out of business, indicted, or charged with crimes, so that seems to say,
there is something else in play, and it would not surprise me if there are more pot stock companies taken off
the trading floor if the MJX markets recover from this onslaught by the sec to control them, lick your wounds
and take an aspirin or better yet smoke a joint and watch what happens to the markets, if they recover fast I
expect another stop trading to happen, so caution is my plan


28 Apr 2014, 02:09 PM

If we were to reduce the outstanding shares of growlife to 10,000,000 which is the equivalent of how many
MusclePharm currently has, Growlife would be trading at $17 a share right now at .20 a share. PHOT did $5m in revs
and $MSLP did $110m but $mslp share price is only $6.68. Both claimed about ~$21m ~$17m in losses. yes different
industry. But can we deduce anything from this info? is PHOT overvalued? $mslp undervalued?


Imagine PHOT eventually makes $110m in revenues, say 5-10 years from now, how much is the company worth
then?


only in the pot-stock pump world do we see these ridiculous p/sales ratios.


25 Apr 2014, 08:06 PM


halfraw
Want me to clue you in? GrowLife is a company entering a market that has sofar only existed in the shade but
is now about to go mainstream. MSLP is a company operating in a scouted and relatively saturated market.
Therein lies your main difference and the reason for current pps'.

Just wondering why the author would even bother to mention Terra Tech (OTCQB:TRTC) in this article >> " there may
be a significant amount of retail investors that will be turned off from the marijuana industry. Consider the impact on
PHOT's comps whom may also be negatively impacted: Terra Tech (OTC:OTCQB:TRTC) << among others. His
whole inference I`m sure, is meant to make every other legitimate,well run,squeaky clean company in the MJ sector,
sound tainted in some way. Well,FYI,Terra Tech operates according to a totally different,transparent business model,
under the direction of a very capable and stellar management team, headed by a former Morgan Stanley Executive
VP,Derek Peterson. Check out his credentials and background >> http://linkd.in/1tMqLH8 Of all others out there,this
man will lead Terra Tech down the road to success moving forward,and certainly operates on a totally different wave
length,light years apart from some of the other shell companies,within the MJ sector.and therefore shouldn`t have
been thrown into this article just to suit the author`s convenience. I wouldn`t for a minute even doubt that the author of
this article has shorted all the stocks mentioned above,including TRTC. Well,today told it all because TRTC opened at
.64 and closed at .63. What a great impact your article DID NOT have on TRTC ! I sure hope you cover your
shorts,shorty !

I do not need the credit but I was saying that the Halt to me looked like just a scare tactic by the SEC. I said that they
probably had nothing and that this was merely to throw cold water on a hot sector. It appeared to me that only the
most active names were being targeted for "investigations"  
Nailed it. I will be staying Looong $PHOT

Add me to the list while you are at it...Maybe we can hire the same law firms who are planning on/or have
already filed class action lawsuit against Growlife Inc. to changer the defendant's name from Sterling Scott to

The federal government is in a quandary about drugs in general, certainly MJ 
The President gave a stunning statement yesterday about an initiative to allow hard drug offenders get out of prison
early if they meet certain strict guidelines.


I guess the SEC bureaucracy, there for the long haul, will be against that also. As we all know there is a disconnect in
government between those in power in the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch, but the
bureaucrats who are in power even longer have their own agenda. Everyone talks parties, lets talk bureaucrats and
have them be transparent in their operations, but that looks to be a non-starter as in most of government.


26 Apr 2014, 03:08 PM


ajaxs2@rochester.rr.com
PHOT and others would be subject to the SEC investigation, if there was alleged  
manipulation of share by owners and officers. I believe , you will see other halts and unhalts like. these companies.
Until the state and federal regulations infrastructure catches up to the same speed as these companies. THE dust
hasn't  
settled yet! Until it does your going to see a great volatility in market shares. I would remain long as best you can. if
you can't then short or bail with a reduced loss. I was going to invest in these companies, However, with all the
bashing and analytical ., these companies will be on my watch list.. It might be well to examine the historical line of
marijuana from the 1960s to now, to give you insight into the affectation of this new market.

can you, lol on "solid MJ companies"


according to the PHOT shareholders this is the solid company,

28 Apr 2014, 12:17 PM


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
GWPH is a biotech, which by definition isn't "solid" like blue-chips, but it is as solid as they come in the space. The
rest are OTC, and "solid" is a relative term! I have a few that I think stand out and many that shouldn't be in existence
as public companies.


26 Apr 2014, 09:29 PM


Catsrevenge
@ Alan Brochstein > What are your real thoughts on Terra Tech (OTCQB:TRTC),Alan?  
You were at the 420 NYC Investor Dinner on Pier 61, do you believe as many do,that Terra Tech is one of
more "solid" MJ companies in the space as well?


Personally,I would think that after all that has been said and done thus far,Terra Tech under the stellar
leadership of Derek Peterson, has been putting all its cards out on the table and is on a very positive,upward
trajectory,IMO. Check the following link, as your name appears here a number of times. I believe that smart
money should seriously think of TRTC as one of the so called "solid" MJ plays,moving forward!

As a frustrated and disappointed share holder? I want too see one thing and one thing ONLY from GroLife
management.........(pause for affect) 
Aggressive insider buying. Show us the "bent over" investor how confidant you are in your company. Stop diluting and
handing out shares and start buying them with two fists! Prove to your Faithful that you believe in the success of thus
company and swoop up several million shares. Do that? And $PHOT flies over a $1. IMO


I really believe in this idea and recommend echoing it too $PHOT as I will be doing first thing Monday. Thank you in

CEO (Sterling Scott) & CFO (John Genesi) receiving just less than 25% ($1.1 mill) of the companies 2013 revenue of
$4.9 million? So PHOT balance sheets must be good; their joint venture with Vape Holdings R&D costs are totally
funded so 2 guys taking 1/4 of the companies yearly revenue shouldn't be perceived as a dump and run or financial
mismanagement? If I'm misinterpreting something here someone please let me know. I would like to increase my
stake in PHOT to reduce my 60% loss but? 
And as stated previously if there are NO indiscretions then we can thank the SEC for this?

Sterling Scott invested upward of $2 million in SG Technologies and a good deal of time, more than two years ago
now, before it was merged into what became GrowLife, Inc.I'd have to say that Streling Scott is entitled to some

I have an account at a BB broker and tried to buy more of this stock the day it started trading again around $0.25. I
received a message that send this stock is for liquidation only and my trade was cancelled. I turned around and sold
the remaining shares I had before the halt.


Case closed on PHOT.


28 Apr 2014, 03:53 PM


padoc1
A number of folks here said they bought on Friday. I bought 10,000 PHOT on Friday around 10 or 11 in the
morning (EDST) for .25. I'd guess your broker was giving you advice, not fact. If it was for liquidation only, you
would have liquidated your stock, not sold, yes?


28 Apr 2014, 08:47 PM


kingjayk
Let me clairfy, I work for a BB and tried to buy (unsolicited) Friday and received a system generated message
that said "liquidation only". I'm not sure what's the difference between "liquidated" and "sold."


I'm just happy I got out...The stock is now at $0.16 down ~36%


Comparing it to OSLH, I think it has further downside as more people exit their positions.

I'm not as long as you are, buddy! 15,000. That's it. That is, though, the way I bought the extra 10,000 - with a

So you had two interesting announcements today. First the reorganization and rescinding of grants were positive for
$PHOT. That was what I was looking for. (Wonder if they read my earlier post? Kinda freaky.....:)  
Second we had a Republican Congressman named Morgan from Virginia submit a Bill that would reclassify Marijuana
to a schedule 2 from Schedule 1 where it currently lies.


The reclassification of Marijuana is the most important step that the Federal Government must make. It will not
happen over night but I do believe that in the next several years this shall pass. This is a very positive first step by the
Government and I feel shows the changing national perception to Medical benifits of Cannabis.

I'm a trading rookie and have been watching PHOT for a couple of months now. I kicked myself for not buying at .17

Any suggestions?

If you can't take the heat of an SEC halted penny stock, GWPH is Nasdaq listed, otherwise, knock it out with
a limit order. PHOT is still worth today twice what it was 6 months ago.

"PHOT is still worth today twice what it was 6 months ago. "


let me ask you what you use to value a stock or are you saying the price of the stock is up twice what it was 6

all, IMO it is because they (board) finally got scared enough to realize if they did not do something for the
shareholders benefit the stock they gave back would be worthless anyway, and the shareholders noticed it.
They have done nothing publicly since and neither has the stock except down, When that report came out I
thought maybe management might get smart in what they do but not reading anything

posted on PHOT on scottrade on 26 April. You bascially said anyone who disagreed was an idiot with an ulterior
motive. I just checked--still not posted and still showing grey market. What happened?

Pro, unless the "great management" does something positive besides giving back some of their stock, IMO what ever
hair you have left on your head will probably fall out before they get out of the grey market

Ha trabob--might get off sooner than we think then because my hair going fast. Remember my comment to try and
make money not be right? The folks still arguing that Phot really has a bid and ask still posted, that it is really not on
the grey market, and that it is really a great company are exactly what I was referring to. In the meantime, the value of
their holdings gets smaller and smaller and smaller. I have no idea if PHOT is a good company, and I do not really
care. I just know I can not make money on the long side when a stock's share price is getting smaller.

what ever it is worth I understand women like bald heads, and yes I remember all the talk about it not being grey and
in fact I was one of the main targets for them, the slide is just a reality of life in the grey, one commenter mentioned it
would probably go to .0001c / share, but with the government raising the minimum price per share to .01c soon they
need a 100:1 reverse split and my broker charges over $20 commission on grey, so near as I can figure it will take
about 200,000 shares to just pay the commission for those holding that long, and management has been very quite
since giving back some of the stock,

My hands..........My poor blown off hands.......


The best thing I learned in a losing trade? Know when to bail. It hurts but we live to trade another day.


PHOT's damage is bad and long lasting. Possibly game ending. Freaking sad story.

Some good news on the federal level, they just ordered 1,000 pounds of pot


http://huff.to/1sawin3

09 May 2014, 01:15 PM

UP 26% in my portfolio on Friday alone. What is my secret? I do not touch "Pot" stocks anymore. LMAO 
The way to make money off of that is go buy some clones. Do not give anymore money to these thieves. IMO I think I

was temporarily insane investing in these giant float, no profit, house of cards companies.  
I have no regrets though. I survived and learned valuable lessons that make me a better investor today. Good luck
everyone and stay safe.

My IRA loved GWPH last month (up 63.4%), CBIS last month (up 35%), and MJNA (UP 14%).


GWPH is a nasdaq listed "thief", and Morgan Stanley says they're undervalued at 75.


I got hammered a little on VAPE and HEMP on their tank, and I like you have no regret. But I'd rather lose
everything than give up when the stocks are doing shittiest, because I strongly believe that the pot sector got
a nut shot the last few months and is undervalued overall.

sinnedtrebor01
Kaiserdog76 About to join the same boat you are in. I have had enough of these overinflated pump and dumps. Out
of curiosity what sector were you able to achieve a 26% gain?


08 Jun 2014, 01:21 PM


Doyee51986
He takes semi-conservative longs in stocks like $UA,$FB,$APPL,$XRX,$GY apparently.


Not a bad strategy, I guess. I disagree with the Pot stock comment though. Just because people over-inflated
these stocks doesn't mean they are worthless companies. Most pot stocks are worth more than they were in
2013 - even after eating shit last 2 months.

$UA,$FB,$APPL,$XRX,$GY


I caught IWM at the bottom. That has been a today's big winner.


WIsh I had some Dollar store stock. Sheeesh!


I did buy some IBB calls today. They are looking promising.


09 Jun 2014, 04:00 PM


Doyee51986
IBB calls? Why not BIB calls bro. I'm long IBB, and I got June BIS puts (which are effectively BIB calls).


IWM big winner? It's a freaking ETF down .2% bro, it'll never be the big winner by virtue of being an ETF...


I'm long FB, APPL, & ZQK.

ZQK ate shit on earnings, you're better off there short term than UA.


10 Jun 2014, 07:56 PM


Kaiserdog76
Quicksilver, ouch. That sucks. I like the brand but retail is hit or miss by a mile. Right? lol


IWM I caught at the bottom and because I used Call options I leveraged my profit. So for me it was a big winner this
last week.


BIB or IBB work well. I use leverage with options not so much with ETF/ETN products. I all ways say stick to what you
are good at. My strength is in buying short term directional biased option trades.


Good luck everyone. Got another %22 the day after. Today was pretty UNCH but I like the set up for the rest of the
week. China and Japan data could lift our Market higher. IMO


10 Jun 2014, 08:14 PM


Doyee51986
I got shares in After-Hours after ZQK ate shit on earnings, it took a couple days but I'm up 16 bucks now. I got
lucky I had had some call options fail on ZQK, so I wasn't long when it tanked. I'd be really feeling good if I
started the morning at 3.10 rather than 4.10, but also like shit if my shares had tanked from 6 (8-9 really).

The problem with "pot" stocks is that the executives are raping the companies blind with all of the option writing. The
only way for them to stay in business is to issue more stocks to sucker investors. You would think with low interest
rates they would issue debt. But that would imply a long term commitment. Why not just write options that
automatically vest and cash out in a month ..I'm glad I bailed at $0.25 after being up 100% in one day only to see the
stock collapse. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN!!! My firm still list PHOT as liquidate only...

It's an impressive feat. We still don't know why it was suspended. Many have suggested guilty until proven innocent.
