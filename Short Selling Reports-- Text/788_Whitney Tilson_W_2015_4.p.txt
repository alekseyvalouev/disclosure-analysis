Two More Items Of Wayfair Furniture Fail Formaldehyde Tests

Summary


Two more items of Wayfair furniture have failed the formaldehyde tests I
commissioned.


In total, 9 of the 10 Wayfair products I’ve had tested – five types of laminate flooring
and five pieces of furniture, all made of composite wood and all but one from China
– have failed formaldehyde tests.


This high failure rate leads me to believe that the problem is systemic.


Wayfair is, I think, learning what Lumber Liquidators learned the hard way: if you go
to China and hit the low bid, odds are high that you will get tainted product of some
sort: at best, very low quality; at worst, made of illegal or toxic materials.


The next products I plan to test are items of baby furniture.


To address this and protect American consumers, Wayfair (and other retailers of
Chinese-made composite wood products, including Amazon) need to need to stop
ignoring this issue and take action.


In my initial article on Wayfair, Why Wayfair Is My Largest Short Position, I wrote:


…this business is so poorly managed and/or spread so thin that they were selling
Chinese-made laminate long after everyone in the flooring industry knew (thanks to
the March 1  60 Minutes story on Lumber Liquidators) that there were big issues -
and potential liabilities - associated with this product, so extreme caution was called
for.


Just as I did with Lumber Liquidators, I hired a testing company to purchase and test
five samples of Ark laminate flooring from Wayfair's web site. All five failed the
California Air Resources Board (CARB2) limit in spectacular fashion (by a factor of
2-5x) [I've posted the test results here]. In fact, the test results were very similar to
those for the three samples of Lumber Liquidators Chinese-made laminate that I had
tested more than a year ago.

In my follow-up article, Wayfair Doubles Down On Poisoning Its (And Its Partners')
Customers, I shared the first three results of five samples of Chinese-made composite
wood furniture that I had tested (this chart was part of a 74-slide presentation I gave at the
Robin Hood Investors Conference on November 16 ). As one can see, two of the three
Wayfair furniture items failed by a wide margin:


Then, last week I received the test results for the other two Wayfair furniture products I
had tested (I have posted all five of my furniture test results here) and, sure enough, they
failed as well: a nightstand emitted formaldehyde at a level of 0.14 parts per million and an
end table was at 0.48 ppm, both above the CARB2 limit of 0.11, as this page shows:

Note that the nightstand is made in Malaysia, evidence that the problem, while
concentrated in China I believe, is not limited to that country. Note also that these two
products are brands exclusive to Wayfair and were shipped to California before being
tested, meaning that they are required to comply with CARB2 (California Air Resources
Board) formaldehyde limits.


A Systemic Problem


I have no doubt that Wayfair and its defenders will claim that I've cherry-picked certain
products to test and that they represent only a tiny fraction of the 7+ million products the
company sells. And it is indeed true that, especially when I'm paying ~$1,000/test, I am
not testing randomly. Rather, I have focused on products that I think are likely to be toxic -
namely, those made in China of composite wood, which typically means medium-density
fibreboard (MDF), a commodity product that's at the core of products like laminate flooring
and low-end furniture.


MDF can be manufactured at a meaningfully lower cost if resin with high amounts of
formaldehyde is used. Hence, there's strong incentive for manufacturers to cheat - and it's
well known that China is the Wild West and companies there, in pretty much any industry,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3729756-two-items-wayfair-furniture-fail-formaldehyde-tests 4/10


will cheat like crazy if they're not: a) paid a fair price; and b) monitored closely. Specifically,
one industry insider with deep experience in China told me that the MDF manufacturers
there are notorious for cutting corners.


For these reasons, I've focused my attention on composite wood products from China -
and my suspicions have been confirmed, based on 9 of the 10 items that Wayfair is selling
that I've had tested failing the CARB2 formaldehyde test.


There's no shortage of potentially toxic Wayfair products to test, as a search under "MDF"
on the company's website last night yielded 18,457 items, as this screenshot shows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3729756-two-items-wayfair-furniture-fail-formaldehyde-tests 5/10


Of course only a small fraction of these items are potentially toxic, but even if we look at
only 4% of the total in the "Cabinets & Chests" category, that's still 749 products.


How many is too many? How many more tests do I have to do before Wayfair (and, to be
fair, other sellers of such products) come to their senses and realize that they have a big
problem, not a little one???


Wayfair is, I believe, learning what Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) learned the hard way: if
you go to China and hit the low bid (as I think many of Wayfair's suppliers are doing), odds
are high that you will get tainted product of some sort: at best, very low quality; at worst,
made of illegal or toxic materials.


What Wayfair Should Do


What would any sensible, honest, ethical and reputable company do when confronted with
evidence that it is selling products that don't comply with environmental regulations in the
largest state, California, and therefore is likely jeopardizing the health and safety of its
customers? Wayfair should:


1. Immediately suspend sales not only of the products in question, but also any other
products that might be toxic (in this case, at the very least, all furniture and other wood
products manufactured in China that are constructed of wood composite materials
such as MDF and particleboard);


2. Ask the person who revealed the test results (me) for an official copy of them so that
my results can be verified (I've posted all ten of them here and here);


3. Once the results of the tests I commissioned are confirmed, contact all customers who
bought these products, inform them of the potential danger, and offer a free return and
either a full refund or replacement;


4. Launch its own large-scale testing program to determine how widespread this problem
is; and


5. Make a substantial investment in compliance, which would include hiring a senior-level
Chief of Compliance, engage firms that specialize in on-the-ground monitoring of
suppliers (especially those in Asia), and regularly test products being sold on its site.


What Wayfair Is Actually Doing


Wayfair of course doesn't want to do any of this because it would hurt both the company's
profits (well, to be accurate, increase its losses; it's never earned a profit) as well as its
stock price (the latter would be especially bad when the CEO, Niraj Shah, and the other
co-founder, Steven Conine, each own Wayfair stock worth more than $600 million and the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3729756-two-items-wayfair-furniture-fail-formaldehyde-tests 6/10


top eight executives at Wayfair have been selling an average of nearly $7 million of stock
per month for the past seven months, led by Shah and Conine, at $2.7 million per month
each).


So instead, Wayfair's top executives have tried to sweep this issue under the rug by either
ignoring it or giving what I believe to be phony assurances. For example, CEO Shah said
last month that Wayfair has "a lot of safeguards to make sure all products meet all federal,
all state and all local laws..."


What are these safeguards? Who is the Chief of Compliance? How many people are
tasked with ensuring that Wayfair is selling safe products? I suspect that Wayfair doesn't
have satisfactory answers to these questions.


In addition, CFO Michael Fleisher said on the Q3 conference call last month:


We carry a big selection, as you know, 7 million items…So our approach is actually
to be very thorough in worrying about the safety the products we sell. In order to do
that, we do a few things. One is all our suppliers, we have supplier agreements with
them, we have indemnification agreements with them, we have certificates of
insurance from them, we have detailed product information which specifies down to
the various regulatory bodies whether they be local, state or federal, what pieces
they comply with, or if items don't comply, so that we can take the appropriate steps
in terms of whether we offer them or not. And that's how we are able to make sure
that the products are of high quality, and meet all the guidelines.


The other thing we do though, that not many people do, is that we do not source
items directly from the factories that they are made overseas. So we are sourcing
from folks who are the distributors and the actual product designers, who are
generally American and European companies who are then sourcing in Asia. So we
have an additional layer of QA, QC that a lot of the other retailers who are directly
sourcing may not have, except through their own QC personnel, who would be on
site. And so that's our approach, it's been pretty thorough, it's worked quite well.


Fleisher claims that, by not sourcing directly, Wayfair has "an additional layer" of quality
control, but I believe that exactly the opposite is true: the company appears to have no
compliance or quality control whatsoever. Rather, it appears to be relying on little more
than assurances from more than 7,000 suppliers, supplying more than seven million
items.

This is a recipe for disaster.


My Next Tests: Baby Furniture


I don't wish to play a game of "gotcha" with Wayfair, so I'm going to give the company a
chance to get out in front of this issue by publicly revealing what I plan to test next.


The good news regarding furniture is that, even if it has high levels of formaldehyde, it's
less dangerous than flooring because there's less toxic material and less direct contact
(there's much less MDF in, say, a cabinet than an entire floor, and babies don't crawl on a
cabinet all day long).


Speaking of babies, however, if anyone is harmed by formaldehyde-tainted furniture, I
suspect that it would be infants and young children (they’re more susceptible to common
symptoms like coughing, eye and nose irritation, etc.). And if any items of furniture are
particularly dangerous, I'd guess it would be ones that children are in close contact with.


Hence, the next products I plan to test are ones from Wayfair's Nursery Shop, such as
cribs, toddler beds, cradles, bassinets, dressers and changing tables. My focus will of
course be on items made in China of composite wood.


I will report what I find in a month or so. If I discover that these types of products, to which
infants and young children are exposed, contain dangerous levels of formaldehyde, then
this issue - and Wayfair's problems - are much bigger than I thought. The company (and
those who own its stock) should think long and hard about the implications of possible
headlines like “Test Results Show That Cribs Sold By Wayfair Poison Babies With
Formaldehyde.” I have no idea what the test results will show, but so far I’m batting .900.
Don’t say I didn’t give the company and its shareholders fair warning…


Conclusion


To address this issue and protect American consumers, Wayfair (and many other retailers)
need to stop ignoring this issue and take action. In light of the known potential dangers of
composite wood products, especially those made in China, it is irresponsible for any
retailer to sell these products without a rigorous compliance program in place. The entire
industry, not just Wayfair, needs to wake up and deal with what I suspect is a widespread
problem.


Disclosure: I am/we are short WAYFAIR.

Isn't CARB-2 compliance only applicable to California? If you are really concerned about wood products sold in this
country emitting formaldehyde shouldn't you be lobbying for stricter laws nationwide on this issue vs. selectively
targeting retailers that you just so happen to have stock positions in?

Wayfair may try soon to raise more money in a stock issue. The promoters will try to push the stock up beforehand.
The stock may be a decent short when this is done.

2) Uses unorthodox "Will It Blend" method to create flooring and furniture samples and then tests those samples
because every consumer always completely obliterates their flooring and furniture prior to use.

The last piece of furniture I ordered from Wayfair, a couple of months ago, smelled so badly of chemicals that I had to
send it back. I had ordered from Wayfair before, but after that order combined with what I'm seeing here, I'll never
order from Wayfair again. I would love to see an online retailer of furniture come into being as an open adversary to
Wayfair and its lack of standards.
