TRUP


Trupanion is launching a more cost competitive product in Florida with the dramatic
change of including up to a 50% co-insurance (meaning TRUP would only pay 50%
of the claim).


Although I have repeatedly commented on the non-competitive nature of the
Trupanion offering, and the lack of growth that is causing, the company has
maintained that it's "business as usual".


A Florida filing (inside) shows that Trupanion is highlighting adverse selection as a
key driver for requesting approval of this new offering.


Trupanion claims that its "trupanion express" software - that allows veterinarian
assistants to send insurance offerings to customers at check out - is a key
differentiator.


It appears, as bears have long suggested, that selling insurance in the emergency
room posses serious risk for adverse selection and that Trupanion is trying to pivot

its offerings because of that risk.


I have written extensively about Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP). Most recently I published
a large piece questioning the health of the company by detailing the deterioration of the
internal financial metrics (HERE). Totally unrelated to my post a previously enthusiastic
holder (Ensemble Capital) posted a blog as to the reasons they chose to sell their
position in TRUP (HERE).


Although our analysis differs on many levels, the single most important commonality that
we each highlight is the fact that TRUP offers the most expensive pet insurance on the
market. I proposed that this was because the company had under-priced their insurance
offering and was forced to raise price to cover the losses of legacy policies, Ensemble
Capital proposed that TRUP had the most extensive coverage available and therefore
was fighting against inferior products. Either way we agree that the company is growing
slower than the market and that the non-competitive pricing dynamic is a significant
driver of that market share loss.


There are two basic ways that an insurance company gets itself into a rate spiral that
forces them to raise the price of the new policies - well above the market rate - to make
up for the losses they previously underwrote.


A company might under-price their insurance offering to gain market share, risking
the long term viability of the insurance book for the benefit of short term market
share.


1.


A company could run into an adverse selection issue when building their business. In
this case the insurer is unaware that they are under-pricing their business as they
have made incorrect assumptions about the health of the population they are
insuring.


2.


In TRUP's case both may be playing a role in the current issue of unsustainable pricing
disparity between players in the pet insurance market.


According to the Ensemble letter: "A major part of our thesis was Trupanion’s
advantage having “active” referral relationships with nearly 10,000 North
American veterinary hospitals and its success at installing its automated claims
software, Trupanion Express, at 4,000 hospitals."

According to TRUP - This Dynamic Has Become An Issue


Figure 1: "Response to Objection 1" Page 1


Selling insurance inside a hospital - veterinarian or otherwise - generates significant risk
for adverse selection. Especially when the company offers rich payouts. According to
Ensemble: "The reason Trupanion is pricey, however, is it has more generous
payouts – Trupanion’s loss ratio is 70% versus the industry average of 50%."


Veterinarians are paid based on visits and procedures, if they are your sales lead team
you can run into problems quickly.


In a document filed with the state of Florida TRUP has requested an important change
to their insurance offering, they want to be able to offer a product that has a co-
insurance toggle. Currently TRUP pricing is based off of a series of inputs like age and
breed but most significantly the size of the deductible you choose. Now TRUP would like
to offer a separate toggle that allows you to degrade the payouts that TRUP will be
responsible for over time.


This new product, described as "Trupanion Agreement" in the Florida filings received
some push-back from the Florida insurance regulators. In a file named "Response to
Objection 1" TRUP states:


We believe that, in our existing Trupanion product, we experience adverse selection
and not enough insight in areas with low penetration.

Conclusion


Source: Florida Office of Insurance Regulation


Adverse selection is a serious issue for an insurance company, the basic premise is that
your policy holders are sicker (and therefore will draw more capital from you over time)
than you anticipated when the policy was originally priced and written. The result is that
the book of polices one has underwritten generates more capital draw than cash profits.
Remember an insurance company is just a stack of contracts, if those contracts don't
make money... the business is worthless.


In my previous reports I have detailed my rationale for shorting TRUP and how I derive
an $8 price target. This document is supportive of some of the major concerns for the
business.


Additional observations about this disclosure are warranted:

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
Join the next boom » 


Changing the co-insurance rate is antithetical to the company's claim that they
provide the best coverage in the business. This moat, it seems, is dead.


1.


A key aspect of the bull thesis is that Trupanion (via Trupanion Express) has a
significant advantage over the competition due to the proprietary data generated at
the point of sale. However the document above lays this argument bare as the
company admits that in the geographies that offer expansion opportunity they have
no silver bullet. This moat, it seems, is dead.


2.


Co-insurance does not solve adverse selection, it doesn't even address the
underlying problem with whatever sales channel is causing the adverse selection
issue. All that has been highlighted here is that selling insurance via a network of
Veterinarians causes adverse selection in your insurance pool. This moat, it seems,
is dead.

What I find surprising here is that TRUP has said nothing about altering its program to
investors. For a company that sells itself as the highest payout to veterinarians to alter
its co-insurance is a significant and meaningful change in strategy. Investors should
demand more transparency from a company that is priced this far form the competition, I
shouldn't have to dig up obscure filings to discover the fact that TRUP's sole product
offering is having adverse selection issues. Invest at your own risk, I remain short.
