El Pollo Loco: PE 'Bust-Out', 20+ Years Of Failed Domestic Expansion,
Pre-IPO Window Dressing Make An Ideal Short
Top Idea | Aug. 20, 2014 5:00 AM ET119 comments
by: Suhail Capital


Summary


More like a ‘Pollos Hermanos’ than the Chipotle media comparison it is currently
getting.


20+ years of failed domestic expansion track record.


Two-year comp momentum is largely average check growth driven, and thus should
be heavily discounted.


Existing equity holders will be very motivated sellers at lockup expiry.


There should be ZERO bid for this stock anywhere north of $20.

Summary


I. Background & Introduction


source: El Pollo Loco website


Juan Francisco Ochoa started the restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1975. After
expanding in Mexico the first US location opened in 1980 in Los Angeles, California. This
is when the journey of the publicly-listed El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) we see trading
as "LOCO" today began. After achieving notable success in the LA market, in 1983 the
US restaurants in the chain were acquired by Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN). Juan Francisco
Ochoa and family would continue to operate the restaurants in Mexico (he went on to set
up a taco chain in Texas called 'Taco Palenque' and the 'Palenque Grill', both serving
Mexican cuisine with recipes similar to El Pollo Loco). American Securities Capital
Partners (ASCP) acquired El Pollo Loco in 1999 and sold it to current majority owner
Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005.


This brings us to the fanfare surrounding July 25th, 2014, the first trading day for El Pollo
Loco. On the first trading day the stock opened at $19 (from an IPO price of $15) and
closed near the day's high at $24. This prompted articles touting El Pollo Loco as "the

latest quick service/fast casual chain to emulate Chipotle's rapid growth." As you will see
later, this couldn't be further from the truth. The next 5 days of trading in El Pollo Loco
were truly epic in what appeared to be a high frequency trading game of hot potato,
combined with mini short-squeezes, combined with day traders gone mad. We think the
below charts and tables sufficiently convey the 'Loco-ness' of it all:

II. The Next Chipotle? Not even Close!


When El Pollo Loco filed to go public, we took a look at the chain knowing full well that any
Mexican-themed restaurant chain going public would draw surface comparisons to
Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). We figured that with Chipotle's recent operating and share price
momentum that this IPO might actually attract the momentum fast-money crowd that
eventually creates a good short regardless of the underlying business involved (much like
Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) during the SAAS euphoria in Q4 2013). What we
concluded after just one day's worth of research and analysis was that a deeper dive on
the name was not justified as there was NO WAY the market would buy this story, and this
is coming from individuals who are rarely surprised by just how stupid the market can be
at times. This is because even the most cursory look at El Pollo Loco leads one to
conclude this company has no business being compared to any restaurant chain growth
story, let alone Chipotle. Yet here it is a few weeks after going public trading at a higher
multiple than Chipotle, and garnering the type of market media attention bestowed on
growth story darlings. So, let's take a closer look.


El Pollo Loco vs. Chipotle:


Chipotle Store Count End of 1999: 37 Stores All in Colorado


El Pollo Loco Store Count End of 1999: 278 Stores in 4 States (CA, NV, TX, AZ) with
85%+ Los Angeles.


Chipotle Store Count End of 2013: 1,572 Across 43 States and D.C. as well as 16
International Stores in Canada, England, France, and Germany.


El Pollo Loco Store Count End of 2013: 401 Stores in 5 States with 88% of Stores in
California


Here is a detailed snapshot of key metrics at these two companies over the last decade:

As you can see from a historical analysis standpoint, these two companies couldn't be
more different. The only thing they have in common is that they both offer Mexican-
themed cuisine.


Ahh, but this is the story of the past, this stock is trading on what the future will bring.
Surely this IPO opens the door to significant domestic and subsequently international
expansion.


We seriously doubt that.


III. A Long History of Failed Domestic Expansion


El Pollo Loco is not some new hot restaurant franchise on the verge of massive domestic
expansion. They have a long history of trying and failing to meaningfully grow their brand
outside of the Southwest United States or for that matter, the core Los Angeles market.


Here are some of the most recent failed attempts to expand geographically across the
United States:


Chicago: 4 stores starting in 2005, all closed by 2012


Colorado: 1 stores starting in 2006, closed by 2011


Connecticut: 1 store opened in 2006, closed in 2012


Georgia: 9 stores starting in 2007, all closed by 2011


Massachusetts: 2 stores starting in 2007, all closed by 2010


New Jersey: 1 store 2009, closed in 2010


Oregon: 2 stores starting in 2008, all closed by 2011


St. Louis: 1 store opened in 2009, closed by 2011


Virginia: 3 stores starting in 2008, all closed by 2011


Vancouver, WA: 1 store opened in 2008, closed in 2009


That's ten states entered and exited between 2005 and 2012!


Here is what management has had to say about this:

5/23/2018 El Pollo Loco: PE 'Bust-Out', 20+ Years Of Failed Domestic Expansion, Pre-IPO Window Dressing Make An Ideal Short - El Pollo Loco H…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


As of March 30, 2011, we had 14 system-wide restaurants open in markets east of
the Rockies. Additionally, three stores (two franchise locations and one company
location) were closed in 2010 and four stores located east of the Rockies (all
franchise locations) were closed in 2011 in these areas due to low sales. Our
restaurants open east of the Rockies are experiencing a wide range of sales
volumes, and a majority of them have sales volumes that are significantly less than
the chain average due to the lack of brand awareness in the new markets.


Now here is an excerpt from one of their East Coast franchisees on his experience:


"That style of Mexican grilled chicken is very, very regional," said Ed Doherty,
president and chief executive of Doherty Enterprises. It originally secured the rights
to open as many as 30 El Pollo Locos in New Jersey and New York, but the
company decided not to go further with the concept after sales in North Bergen were
less than what they had hoped. To expand the concept, Doherty said, his company
wanted to see sales of $40,000 to $45,000 a week at the North Bergen El Pollo
Loco. Instead, it was doing about $25,000 a week. After a fire at the store two years
ago, the company sold the location to a Wendy's, which is doing more than double
the sales volume.


"It wasn't the location," Doherty said. "Wendy's is doing great."


And keep in mind this is not the first time El Pollo Loco has had a tough go of it
geographically expanding. In the late 80s and early 90s there were failed forays into
Florida, North Carolina, Hawaii, and even Japan.


Suffice to say, El Pollo Loco's repeated struggles to expand geographically are very
difficult to ignore. While discounting some of the failure to multiple instances of poor
economic timing, it is still hard to fathom the uniform nature of the failure. This is not a
case of one or two markets failing to absorb 20 to 30 units, but rather about every single
market failing to accept the brand at all. We have no doubt that if In-N-Out Burger (a chain
which literally has the same exact Southwest regional presence as El Pollo Loco) opened
in these same markets that there would be lines out the door, and that those first couple of
stores in each new geography would literally mint money.


Clearly, El Pollo Loco, despite its near ubiquitous presence in the second-largest
American city, has not developed the commiserate brand identity. Banking on that
drastically changing after two decades' worth of irrefutable empirical evidence requires
nothing short of a tremendous blind leap of faith.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


Well, then what about those solid pre-IPO comps?


IV. Dissecting El Pollo Loco's Pre-IPO Comparable Same-Store Sales


Anyone who has ever invested in restaurant franchise stocks knows how hypersensitive
the names can be to short-term comp sales numbers. One need only look at the recent
collapses of Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN) and Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) for fresh
examples of what happens when you slightly disappoint in this area. Mature brands
trading at close to 2x EV/Sales can quickly turn into 1x or less EV/Sales stocks, and for
hyped younger growth stories the 20x+ EV/EBITDA is quickly replaced by something a lot
closer to a 10x multiple. Thus, with El Pollo Loco trading at north of 30x EV/EBITDA and
5x EV/Sales, one has to be quite cognizant of their recent comps and what's driving them.


This goes without saying for any restaurant stock trading at such levels, but is even more
relevant for one that just went public. This is because there is a tendency to window-dress
a company before an IPO by pulling short-term levers that are typically not sustainable
and/or not in the long-term interests of the business model. This window dressing is most
common in businesses that have been around for a while, and especially common in ones
that have been passed around by PE firms. That being said, once you get to our review of
the ownership/financial history of this brand, you will understand why we pulled out the
microscope to look at their pre-IPO numbers.


We imagine that when the JOBS Act was passed that the sponsors did not envision it
being used to limit disclosures by companies that have been in business for over 30
years. That's what you get with El Pollo Loco. A company that has nearly two decades'
worth of accessible financial information, only ends up needing to disclose the results from
the last three years. Luckily for us, a company that has incurred this level of indebtedness
often has registered securities that require regular filings with the SEC, and that is
precisely the case with the El Pollo Loco. Combine these filings with a failed 2006 IPO
prospectus and a recent note exchange offer that you can go through, and you end up
with all the data you need to paint a complete picture. With that in mind, any discerning
investor looking at the last two years of pre-IPO comps within the context of the chains
broader comp trends over the last 15 years is going to raise a red flag and ask some
questions.


El Pollo Loco's company owned same-store sales have averaged 7% growth over the last
two years. This is a huge deviation from the 1.4% average over the preceding 11 years,
and jumps off the page when you see that traffic attribution in the comps has been
trending closer to 2%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


Why does it jump off the page?


1. El Pollo Loco reported some of the worst comps in their peer group in the recession. In
2009, they ranked 47th out of 50 QSR chains for year-over-year same-store sales.
Their combined 2009/2010 performance puts them at virtually the bottom of the entire
QSR 50 list. When you are looking for comp sustainability, you are trained to be wary
of what might be unusually easy comparable periods or sudden swings that look like
one-off/macro rebound driven numbers.


2. El Pollo Loco's store base shrunk throughout the reported pre-IPO comp period (412
stores end of 2010 to 401 at the end of 2013); store closures remove underperforming
restaurants from the store comp base. This is good news for short-term comps, but
again not a sustainable positive trend one expects to be leveraged going forward.
Furthermore, it is an explicitly bad sign for a chain whose stock is being valued at the
highest end of the future growth expectation range.


3. Large average check count increases for a non-growing regionally concentrated chain
tend to imply price increases. This is notable as price hikes are by definition not a
sustainable comp driver and also come with their own potential down the road trade-off
as customers may gradually look elsewhere for value. Furthermore, in El Pollo Loco's
case, this phenomenon is accentuated by the fact that 80% of their revenue is derived
from one state, and even within California is largely weighted towards the city of Los
Angles (we estimate in the 65-70% range). If your core demographic is Hispanic-
Americans in Los Angeles, investors are even more likely to discount comp growth that
implies significant price driven average check growth.


Now, #1 and #2 above speak for themselves, it is #3 where investors in El Pollo Loco
have not surprisingly been left in the dark.


The below excerpt is from Chipotle's recent Q2 Conference Call:


Overall sales for the quarter increased 28.6% to $1.05 billion, driven by the comp
and from new restaurant openings. Year to date sales were $1.95 billion, an increase
of 26.6%, including a comp for the year so far of 15.5%. The quarter comp was
primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic, along with an increase in our
average check, which includes a 2.5% benefit from our menu price increase rolled
out during the quarter. Average check in the quarter was up about 5% from last year
with half of this increase coming from the menu price increase and the rest of the
check increase coming from catering, an increase in the group size per transaction
along with additional sides such as Chips & Guac.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2436995-el-pollo-loco-pe-bust-out-20-plus-years-of-failed-domestic-expansion-pre-ipo-window-dressing-make-an-ideal-short


As you can see, Chipotle clearly deconstructs their comp numbers. The 17.2% comp for
the quarter only includes a 2.5% benefit from price (note to Cramer: Chipotle's 17.2% and
El Pollo Loco's disclosed prelim 4.9%-5% Q2 comp are not "similar comps" as one chain
is experiencing 14% yr/yr traffic growth while the other is doing 1.4%!). This is not
something Chipotle just started doing because the market has been focusing on their
recent nationwide menu price hike; this is something they have always disclosed to
investors even when price increases have been more targeted.


El Pollo Loco does not offer this level of transparency in their prospectus even though EPL
Intermediate has offered it in past 10-Ks.


Here is how they define Comparable Restaurant Sales:


Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in the number
of meals sold and/or by increases in the average check amount resulting from a shift
in menu mix and/or higher prices resulting from new products or price increases.


The problem here is that when it comes to disclosing average check, they do not break
out the impact of menu price increases. For example, in their banner 2012 comp year, 6%
of their 8.6% increase in company owned same-store sales came from average check
growth. A number like that for a non-organically growing chain screams significant menu
price increases. Now, if this was a chain with a large national presence, deconstructing
these menu price increases would be a challenge, but you don't have that problem here.


Here are two photos we took a few days ago of an El Pollo Loco drive-thru menu in LA:

What you see above is El Pollo Loco's new menu, which is largely a reflection of where
management has decided to take the brand over the past couple of years. What should
jump out at you (if you are familiar with the brand) is the fact that the 'value' QSR element
has gradually been replaced by what looks more like a fast casual menu. Over the past
few years the "Dollar Menu" morphed into the "Value Menu", which is now being replaced
by the more value indifferent "Snack Menu".

Now we could show you plenty of photos illustrating this genesis, but deciphering the price
changes from multiple images from countless locations spread across several years is not
ideal. So we will try and keep it simple for you by sharing what our extensive research dug
up.


This link is from an El Pollo Loco menu circa summer of 2009. As you can see, when
compared to the prices from the drive-thru screen shots above, things have changed quite
a bit. Popular value items like the "BRC Burrito" and "Chicken Taco al Carbon" have seen
price increases of 65% and 69% respectively. The introductory 8-piece family meal has
increased in price by 14%, and the 10 piece by 17%. A 3-piece chicken leg and thigh
combo has increased by 27%, and the price of a small side has gone up by 44%. Now to
be clear the above photographed menu is new and is not reflective of the entire store
base, and 2009 is a little too far back for what we were looking for in terms of pre-IPO
comp insight.


A more relevant visual comparison would be this blogger's Jan 2012 visit and review (with
menu price photos) of an El Pollo Loco. At this specific restaurant, we verified that popular
value items, the BRC Burrito and the Chicken Taco al Carbon, increased in price by 29%
and 39% over the past two years. Meanwhile, the intro 8-piece leg and thigh family meal
increased by 13%.


Now setting aside these select comparisons, our more comprehensive research indicates
that the key takeaways here are that the low end (i.e. the value items) of the menu has
come up rather significantly over the past 2.5 years, and that the family meals, starting in
mid-2011, have seen 9-15% increases. Basically the intro 8-piece range has gone from
$15.99-$16.49 to $17.49-$18.99 with comparable hikes as you go up in family meal size.
The ability to track the changes on the family meals is actually quite helpful as
management does disclose that these meals accounted for a little less than a third of
company operated store sales. Thus, you can estimate that there is a 2.5-5.0% price hike
impact embedded in the last two years average check growth just from the pricing taken
on this part of the menu. As for other items, we can say that bowls and burritos have been
relatively stable over the past 2 years with a trend of new higher intro price point menu
items entering the total mix.


Overall, we came away from this exercise with the simple conclusion that pricing has been
a very relevant and likely dominant part of an already average check-dominated comp
stack. We also have concluded that management's decision to move towards a more
upmarket brand identity, as they seek to try and grow the brand again, risks alienating the
brand's core demographic and putting them head-to-head with much established healthy

fast casual chains. Basically, becoming more like Chipotle 15 years ago would have been
a good idea, but at this juncture it actually opens the door to that powerhouse making
inroads against you in your bread and butter market. When your bread and butter market
is literally one city, that is a pretty risky maneuver. Chipotle has never really fared too well
in LA because of all the Mexican options and the existence of the likes of El Pollo Loco
dominating the value/family element amongst the Hispanic community; if that were to
drastically change sometime in the near future, El Pollo Loco would quickly become a
candidate for liquidation or restructuring.

Well, if there is ever a private equity version of the hit series "Breaking Bad", El Pollo
Loco's story should be at the top of the list.


Sell tasty chicken out the front door while financial engineers behind the scenes cash in by
piling on debt to pay outrageous dividends, management fees and transaction fees.


The Bamboo Lounge 'bust-out' in Goodfellas is also a good analogy. Find a solid cash
flowing business, run up its credit to take supplies in the front door that are sold at 100%
profit out the back door, and then light a match to the place. When PE goes awry in the
restaurant business it's very hard not to think of the Goodfellas 'bust-out', as piles of cash
in the form of debt literally come in the front door and go out the back, with barely a cent
seemingly ever making its way into the operating business.


The History of the LBO Family Chicken Meal:


The 12-restaurant, Los Angeles-based El Pollo Loco that was acquired by Denny's in
1983 had the makings of what might have one day be today's Chipotle. The chain
expanded rapidly over the following seven years (almost exclusively in southern
California) to 200 units, and developed very strong brand equity. But thanks to the late
1980s junk bond-driven LBO boom (Coniston Partners' purchase of their parent TW
Services for $1.7 billion with $1.5 billion in high yield debt was the last great junk bond
deal of the 1980s), it spent most of the early 1990s as a neglected asset within the
portfolio of a large and financially burdened holding company. Consequently, over the first
half of the decade, El Pollo Loco's parent only managed to add 16 new restaurants. There
were also multiple non-focused failed expansions during this time that saw the chain open
and close in Florida, Hawaii, and even as far away as Japan. Not exactly how you grow a
restaurant franchise, but when you are that leveraged you take what you can get. Yet, a
remodeling program and a new strategy to target the lunch crowd in the mid-1990s
seemed to position El Pollo Loco for an era of renewed expansion. In 1996, their parent
company announced ambitious plans to expand the chain to 600 units by the end of the
decade. Of course the parent's bankruptcy filing the following year threw a wrench into
those plans. The huge expansion never materialized, and by the end of the decade a
decision was made to put El Pollo Loco up for sale.


Enter alleged savior/value creator, PE firm American Securities Capital Partners.


The El Pollo Loco that was acquired by ASCP for $128 million in cash at the end of 1999
($44 million in equity from ASCP and the rest in debt financing in the form of a senior loan)

Here is what they saw themselves bringing to the table in a joint presentation by Steve
Carley- El Pollo Loco CEO and Glenn Kaufman- Managing Director of ASCP:


Admittedly over the next three years they did seem to be making some progress putting
the chain back on the right track. They remodeled stores, upgraded IT systems and
improved overall operating efficiency while selectively expanding in the core market. And
yes, they reduced some of the leverage used to finance their acquisition.


Then at the end of 2003 it would appear they got bored or determined that El Pollo Loco's
future was limited to being a solid LA Mexican chicken chain whose cash flows were
better served being milked than reinvested in domestic expansion; $70 million in additional
debt was incurred, $50 million of that was paid out in the form of a dividend and $20
million was used to buy back preferred stock. El Pollo Loco ended the year with $133
million in debt. In 2004, we got more of the same. ASCP borrowed to pay themselves a
$37 million dividend. Then in 2005 ASCP decided to sell El Pollo Loco, but not before
another $11 million distribution was tacked on in the form of transaction fees. All in all, in
just over 5 years, ASCP took a company with $15 million in capital lease debt and $21
million in EBITDA and turned it into one with nearly $185 million in long-term debt and $33
million in EBITDA. If you run the numbers on the deal financing for the acquisition, fees,
and leveraged dividends cashed out, nearly every last cent of the indebtedness incurred
by El Pollo Loco effectively never made it into the business.

Now here is an excerpt from the PR ASCP put out after they agreed to sell El Pollo Loco
in 2005:


Through continued and long-term focus on operational investment and strategic
growth during its time with American Securities, El Pollo Loco has substantially
improved restaurant level operating performance while more than doubling the
company's profitability. "The heritage of our firm is in building great enterprises. We
are completely committed to working as partners with managers to build businesses
that are far better operationally, financially and competitively when we exit than when
we initially invested," added Mr. Kaufman. "Our El Pollo Loco experience is a perfect
example of our business philosophy."


Seriously? Now doesn't that post-sale case study slide about reducing this acquired
"Orphan's" leverage seem a bit ridiculous to you. If El Pollo Loco was an "Orphan" when
ASCP bought it from TW Services, it was an orphan with a new pair of shoes and no legs
by the time they sold them to Trimaran Capital Partners. A better analogy here would be
that ASCP acquired an orphaned chain, dabbled with nursing them back to health, only to
turn around and thoroughly 'bust them out' before they sold them off to somebody else.


During these five years of financial ingenuity, while El Pollo Loco was being used as a PE
ATM machine, Chipotle opened nearly 500 restaurants across the nation. One can't help
but wonder what El Pollo Loco would like today if all that debt had been used to fund a
gradual and laser focused expansion of the brand.


So, El Pollo Loco, whose biggest problem had been that it was stuck in the portfolio of a
restaurant holding company mired in junk bond mania debt, was now also buried in debt.


The solution: Why of course, another LBO to tack on even more debt, and hopefully a
quick flip IPO to save the day.


Enter Trimaran Capital, the current majority shareholder, which clearly had no intention of
holding onto El Pollo Loco for very long. Going back through SEC filings we found the
2006 S-1 for El Pollo Loco in which they were looking to raise up to $135mln for a
company with $260mln in debt and $36mln in EBITDA (according to 2005 numbers in the
S-1.) Note, this S-1 was initially filed just a few months after the closing of the acquisition
by Trimaran. So for them having this 'quick-flip' turn into a 9-year 'investment' was
definitely not part of their original game plan. Their timing was to put it mildly not very
good. Over their ownership period El Pollo Loco reported an aggregate net loss of $191
million. Their last profitable year was 2006, and for the last year the company earned

more than $1 million you have to go all the way back to 2003. And as if being the last PE
buyer in the door before the music stopped and a major recession appeared wasn't bad
enough, they got hit losing a trademark lawsuit to the original Mexican founder of El Pollo
Loco (they ended up settling for just under $11 million in 2008). Not exactly a pleasant
journey. In fact, it is a sheer miracle that they averted bankruptcy here. Just a look back at
their filings and you can see that as recently as August 2011 they were marking El Pollo
Loco at 30c on the dollar ($30 million equity value for the whole company). Yet now they
are sitting on a majority stake in a company that the market is valuing at $1.4 billion, and
an income tax receivable agreement that is worth some $40 million in distributions (to both
PE firms) going forward. This is a pretty remarkable turn of events to say the least.


So, what was the point of this trip down memory lane?


Well, to be clear, we wanted to set the record straight as far as current popular perception
of this name being some sort of hot 'story' stock. El Pollo Loco's last twenty years of
operating history are an absolute tragedy. This was a business with a lot of potential that
always seemed to find the wrong owners, and now after decades of missed opportunity it
is being dumped on the unsuspecting retail investor. Now, there is no doubt that
management has done an excellent job stabilizing the ship, especially considering they
have been operating with the financial equivalent of a noose around their neck. But that
does not obscure the fact that this is just about the furthest thing from an exciting growth
story, and that owning the shares at these levels is the equivalent of simply burning the
cash in your wallet.


VI. Valuation: What's it worth?


El Pollo Loco shares currently trade in excess of 30x EV/ 2013 ADJ EBITDA (Chipotle is
at 29x trailing and 24x consensus estimate for 2014).


Consider that multiple within the context of how long the brand has been around, the
missed opportunities to expand while PE played LBO hot potato with it, the subsequent
and very recent failed domestic expansion, the concurrent domestic metamorphosis of
Chipotle into a Mexican chain national powerhouse, and overall intense competition in
their very crowded niche. How many Pollo [fill in the blank] are there in the USA? We
counted at least 10 other regional chains including El Pollo Rico, Gordo, de Oro, Regio,
Inka, Primo, Campero, Feliz, Norteno and just plain El Pollo. The multiple is just plain
LOCO! When you further factor in El Pollo Loco's concentrated exposure to one city, a

menu that is pushing the outer limits of value for a brand with a core demographic that is
highly value conscious, and still somewhat limited balance sheet flexibility, a multiple north
of 10x EV/ ADJ EBITDA becomes completely indefensible.


At 10x EV/ADJ EBITDA the stock would be trading at $9.80 which implies over 70%
downside from current levels. This would put it on par with where recent food and
beverage IPO Potbelly is now trading. We think fair value for this business is still lower,
with a price close to $6/share in the coming 12-18 months not being out of the question.


$6 that must be some crazy sensationalist short-biased target, right?


To be clear that target is not even predicated on some sort of gloom and doom scenario.


Mature niche restaurant chains are very sensitive to short-term comps, and there is no
shortage of them trading at trailing EV/Sales multiples of 1x or less (Potbelly, Bloomin
Brands, and Red Robin Gourmet all trade at EV/Sales multiples of less than one).
Considering El Pollo Loco generated $315 million in revenue last year, a 1x EV/Sales
multiple works out to $3.50/share. Now Potbelly is interesting comp because it's a more
recent expansion story, IPO'd less than a year ago, operates 280+ company owned shops
across 18 states, had 20% shop level margins vs El Pollo Loco's 21% in 2013, and is
sitting on a much healthier balance sheet with net cash at 2x EBITDA vs net debt of 3.4x
ADJ EBITDA at El Pollo Loco. Yet Potbelly doubled from its offering price, traded
sideways for a few months, then slowly trickled back down to the offering price, and later
fell off a cliff after its third quarterly report as a public company on weaker-than-expected
comps. It currently trades at an EV/ADJ 2013 EBITDA of 8x and EV/2013 Sales multiple
of 0.96x. These multiples should give any El Pollo Loco investors pause, especially when
you factor in that Potbelly has been steadily growing their brand since 1995, and has not
experienced the type of significant geographic retrenchments El Pollo Loco has faced over
the years. However Potbelly has been weak of late, so let's look at a more mature
restaurant chain with better recent operating momentum.


Jack In The Box (NASDAQ:JACK), which owns the 600+ unit Mexican themed Qdoba
chain, (as well as 2,200+ Jack In The Boxes) has been on a tear of late with shares up
60% over the last 12 months. The driver has been significant comp momentum at the
Qdoba chain recently, where comps as of the most recent quarter were up 7.5% year over
year, and year to date are up 500bps over 2013. Despite this recent run-up, the stock is
trading at EV/TTM EBITDA of roughly 10x. In fact, most of the successful established
national restaurant chains trade in this neighborhood. Panera (NASDAQ:PNRA), Bloomin

Brands, Wendy's (NYSE:WEN), McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), Red Robin Gourmet
(NASDAQ:RRGB), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) all trade at
roughly 11x EV/EBITDA or less.


The next step up comp wise is Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI) which has 20%+ mkt
share in the domestic chicken QSR segment, and thus makes for a solid comparable.
Popeyes trades at 14.5x EV/ TTM EBITDA. The chain sports EBITDA margins that are
nearly double El Pollo Loco at 31.7%, and grew revenue by 35% (only 2% of the chains
2,225 are company-owned) over the past two years. Their Net Debt to EBITDA clocks in
at 0.9x, and over the past three years they have on average returned 36% of EBITDA to
shareholders via buybacks. Furthermore, the Popeyes brand continues to grow both
domestically and internationally despite its large unit base. The global brand equity is hard
to ignore considering the brand was founded only two years before El Pollo Loco.


After Popeyes, the next chain worth looking at in the comp ladder is the very relevant
Fiesta Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:FRGI). FRGI, which operates two Mexican/Caribbean
themed chains in "Taco Cabana" and "Pollo Tropical", is about as close as you are going
to get to El Pollo Loco. The chains have a similar regional focus with Pollo Tropical's base
concentrated in Florida and Taco Cabana's in Texas. FRGI trades at an EV/EBITDA
multiple of 18x or 40% lower than El Pollo Loco. We believe the name is also an attractive
Chipotle-inflated Mexican chain stock short, but will concede that for now it provides a
more marketable surface level growth story. Pollo Tropical's 7% average same-store sales
growth over the past two years is 66% weighted to traffic vs El Pollo Loco's 37% traffic
weighting for a virtually identical company owned same-store sales two-year average.
Pollo Tropical's stores are also averaging 53% more in avg sales per unit, and exhibit 350
bps higher restaurant level margins. We'd also note that FRGI's largely company-owned
model has resulted in a much more controlled domestic brand expansion with no
significant failed retrenchments in recent years damaging brand equity, and thus remains
more open to future domestic franchising margin-expanding opportunities.


The last non-Chipotle chain in El Pollo Loco's valuation neighborhood is the 50x+ EV/ADJ
EBITDA multiple sporting and seemingly 'unique Mediterranean concept story' of Zoe's
Kitchen, ticker "ZOES". Zoe's, which has gone from 20 units to 100+ in the past five years,
is still growing its top line at close to 50%. But a 'fresh' concept chain and a small store
base with exceptional and consistent unit growth trends over five years is again the very
antithesis of El Pollo Loco.

We even fished around for private chicken chain comps during our research and came
across QSR behemoth Church's Chicken which was sold four years ago for an estimated
6x EBITDA.


There is another way to think about how to value this business other than looking at public
company comps. If you've had any experience valuing small regionally-focused private
service industry businesses or large franchisees of a healthy restaurant brand, El Pollo
Loco should be right up your alley. When you come across a regionally strong business
that has the characteristics of a finite/limited geographic expansion story, you don't want
pay more than 5x EBITDA. Ideally, you come across such a business and conclude you
can clean it up and significantly improve profitability and find a seller who is willing to part
from it for less than 3.5x. However, you'd be willing to pay up to 5x knowing there is plenty
of room to grow your value and effectively reduce your cost base. The exact opposite is
true if the business is being well-run or has in fact made some recent changes which
significantly improved operating profitability.


In such a scenario, you are more likely to discount the recently improved operating metrics
as what you are trying to buy is a cash cow and not a growth story. Essentially, if the
current owner has recently significantly improved operating profitability, you are going to
be much more stubborn with respect to your valuation ceiling. We like to think of El Pollo
Loco in the same way, but on a somewhat grander scale. This is not a hot growth "story"
brand or national/global scale play. At best, there might be room for some selective further
Southwest regional expansion, but for the most part the view here is that this is a more
mature regionally specific strong service brand. This puts the 10x+ EBITDA range out of
the question for it. Our acceptable range is going to be more like 5x-10x. The more
confident we are that they can significantly improve operating profitability, the more
comfortable we are with the higher end of the range. This is where the pre-IPO metrics
come into play. The 340 bps in restaurant contribution margin improvement, sizeable
average check growth, huge comp deviation from historical averages, new menu changes,
near 50% completed store base remodelings, 2013 debt refinancing, Second Lien Term
Loan paydown in conjunction with the IPO, and recent wave of underperforming store
closures are ironically all the things WE DON'T WANT TO SEE as buyers of a strong cash
flowing Southern California restaurant chain. Because what is there left for us to do but try
and turn it into a growth story, which as buyers looking at this regionally mature brand we
already have assumed it is not. If both parties are sharp, what you end up with here is a
stalemate. The buyer doesn't want to pay top dollar for a cash cow business that has just

gone through a thorough once a decade refurbishing, and the last thing the seller wants is
a prospective buyer who does nothing but remind him that he has put all this work in and
is selling here because he has accepted that meaningful expansion is not feasible.


This is the key issue with El Pollo Loco, and probably goes a long way to explaining how
the underwriters were able to price the IPO at $15. If you pro forma the hell out the name,
the stock priced at a seemingly reasonable P/E of 22x 2013 net income. That is a pretty
big leap from $16.8 million reported loss, and the close to $200 million in reported losses
incurred by the company since Trimaran bought it. Bankers love these types of IPOs
because they are essentially deleveraging turnaround stories that are partially contingent
on the IPO happening, and the huge deleveraging impact on reported results quickly
becomes the only thing investors want to talk about. The El Pollo Loco business couldn't
have been more ideally suited for this type of pitch. Between 2011 and 2013 revenues are
up 15%, operating income is up 56%, restaurant contribution margin improved by 230 bps,
ADJ EBITDA margins improved by 300 bps, and company-operated store average unit
volumes went from $1.6 million to $1.75 million.


These are impressive metrics to say the least, and that is the problem here. They are
literally so good that you are immediately forced to red-flag them. How are you growing
operating income 56% with 2.5% yr/yr growth in traffic? 230bps in restaurant margin
expansion is no joke for a mature chain with 67% of their stores in one city; are you not
testing the upper limits of pricing on your core Hispanic base in Los Angeles? What
happens to Average Store Sales Volume when stores doing 30-50% less than the core LA
base close down? What kind of restaurant chain goes from 6% D&A avg expense of total
revenue to 3%? When you answer all these questions, you should have no problem
figuring out that El Pollo Loco's impressive growth in metrics are not due to organic
growth. Instead, they reflect a cash-cow business pulling short-term levers in anticipation
of a sale. The fixed cost leverage that has been extracted here doesn't comport with a
growing franchise. El Pollo Loco has the labor, occupancy, depreciation, food cost, and
marketing spend cost structure of a very mature, one region-focused chain that is simply
milking its base. Start to expand - which by the way, they have failed to do when there was
much less powerful competition for their brand - and these savings being squeezed out all
go in the other direction. Start growing and lower average store volumes as you enter
markets further away from your core base or cannibalize your existing mature base with
new stores, more complex and costly distribution, expanding overhead, and much higher
marketing spend to build brand awareness are what you have to look forward to.

There are also regulatory issues to worry about like the July 1, 2014 12.5% California
minimum wage increase, and a further 11% increase coming at the end of 2015.
Considering that 88% of the store base is located in California, a 25% increase in payroll
over the next 18 months is going to be a very meaningful EBITDA headwind (again, nice
IPO timing). Put all this together and you start to appreciate why a discounted multiple is
warranted here. In our case we settled on 7.5x ADJ 2013 EBITDA or a 'fair value' of $6.10
a share for now.


Note there is nothing wrong with running this business the way it has been run.
Management has done what they needed to do over the past three years, and the
economic rebound obviously helped them out as well. Our concern with El Pollo Loco is
that between its LBO ownership history nightmare and its recent refurbishing a whole lot
of time has passed, and the competitive landscape is not what it used to be. Their core
demographic in Los Angeles has absorbed the pricing shifts thus far, but the risks have
gone up with respect to economic sensitivity of the chain and vulnerability to competition
from more upmarket brands as well as from the better positioned 'value' players. We have
not accounted for these risks in our 'fair value', but we are fairly confident that if a whiff of
evidence were to materialize indicating tiring of the brand in Los Angeles, 5x and not 10x
ADJ EBITDA will quickly become the ceiling.


Summary


1. El Pollo Loco was a hot franchise chain with amazing growth prospects 30 years ago.
Today it's still just an LA staple that is probably going to have to work very hard just to
maintain its grip on what it already has. Comparing it to Chipotle is like comparing a
highly touted draft pick from 20 years ago whose early career was marred by injuries
and poor coaching, and thus ended up being relegated to role player status, to Lebron
James today.


2. Chipotle's success which has buoyed the share price out the gate actually works
against them as far as future growth prospects go.


3. El Pollo Loco's pre-IPO comp numbers and margin expansion are somewhat
misleading. Significant price increases/menu mix shift into a rebounding economy
have been the driver, and thus should be heavily discounted by investors.


4. Setting aside what repeated failed domestic expansions implies about the brand's
future long-term growth prospects; the very recent nature of franchise expansion
failures across multiple states does not bode well for any future franchising in an
already competitive franchise marketplace.

5. The largest shareholder is a legacy PE fund in runoff mode that filed to take them
public no more than six months after initially acquiring them. At lock-up expiration their
holding period will have been just shy of ten years! The sheer fact that they avoided
bankruptcy and a complete wipeout of their investment is a miracle in and of itself. As
of a couple years ago, they were marking this investment at $0.30 on the dollar. We
imagine anything greater than $5/share feels like a victory to them at this point. With all
this in mind, we have no doubt they will be highly motivated sellers anywhere over
$10.


6. The income tax receivable agreement with the current shareholders is like pouring salt
on an open wound. It's just another way of structuring a $40 million IPO contingent
distribution kicker for the pre-existing shareholders at the expense of new investors.
The $10 million in cash interest expense savings from retiring the 2nd lien facility ends
up getting funneled back to the current PE owners in the form of cash tax savings over
the for the next four years. This is further evidence that this is a financially engineered
and abused orphan of a restaurant business, and not the next potential shining growth
star it's being portrayed as in the financial media.


7. Finally, the restaurant stock euphoria of the last 18 months is no longer a tail wind.
Red Robin, Bloomin Brands, Potbelly, and Noodles and Co have all recently
demonstrated just how quickly the market will punish the slightest dip in operating
momentum. Those looking for long exposure in this sector are better served nibbling
away at a solid growing brand like Panera that has spent the last year or two dealing
with its own operational hiccups and is trading at an attractive 8x EBITIDA multiple.
We think betting on them ahead of a potential rebound beats giving your money way in
this dressed up Chipotle piggy-back PE exit.

The fundamental analysis here is top-notch, but being short this stock will be about more than fundamental analysis
given the borrow situation. Anyone taking a short position here has to do the analysis considering the borrow costs
and the probability of being bought in. You could be 100% correct on the fundamental analysis and still lose money
here.

Totally agree with your call but there is no borrow to short LOCO. Implied vol for put options are very expensive too.
The borrow probably won't get better until the IPO lock-ups expire.

Suhail,what could be the reason that stock tanked on Tuesday,the day before article was even published which only
appeared Wednesday morning in PRO section. 
Just wanted to ensure,readers here will not being taken for a ride and seller of Tuesday cover their position on
Thursday as first thing when mkt opens and the stock further falls when article is read by all.

DPK, the stock tanked on Tuesday because the quiet period ended for the sell side analysts...for those firms
that underwrote the IPO. Most of the sell side analyst gave either Hold or Underperform ratings. Morgan
Stanley even gave a price target of $22.

All investors should be weary of BIASED advice. Especially from some chumps in the Caymans, trying to
short everything they can, meanwhile shielding their profits from US compliance, scrutiny and tax. Suhail
Capital Limited should be ashamed of themselves for not publishing this article on Marketwatch, Forbes or
perhaps any other credible source. Don't be fooled by the wolf in a suit, he'll probably shave your sheep. The
borrow is high for short, and Long Term, the demographic both in the US and Mexico speaks to a market that
facilitates this companies growth, just don't expect it to be overnight. Fortunes are made over a lifetime,
chump change is made over a one night stand...or position.

these principles must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mechanisms and climate." - Benjamin

I used to live in Socal and the food is actually very good and with the changing demographic I would watch
this stock closely. It alot better than KFC or Churches chicken.


21 Aug 2014, 06:15 PM


David at Imperial Beach, Contributor
It's grilled chicken served Mexican style (with tortillas and salsa and guacamole). Also, you can get pork
instead of chicken. It's about the same class of restaurant as KFC, but Mexican. About the same prices, about
the same seating arrangements (chairs or booths/benches around small anchored tables.) Light, airy
atmosphere. Decor is more commercial than authentic Mexican. Just picture your KFC with only the grilled
chicken (no original or extra crispy, but beef or pork available) and tortillas instead of biscuits, beans instead
of mashed potatoes and gravy.


I do sometimes go there when I have a coupon, same as KFC. I like that they have pork. I also like that they
serve Coke instead of Pepsi.

If you think this author is pulling the wool over your eyes, it's easy enough to check his facts. If what he says
is true, then don't short. Personally I never short, so there's no way I can be hurt by anything he says. I can,
however, be saved from a bad investment by heeding his warnings. If the company is deeply in debt, then it's
in no position to be attempting yet another expansion into new markets.

Good analysis!


But as ValGal and Dr. Akston point out, with a dearth of shares to borrow, and borrowing fees of 108%/yr, the stock
would have to drop fairly rapidly to make shorting it lucrative.

"El Pollo Loco's pre-IPO comp numbers and margin expansion are somewhat misleading. Significant price
increases/menu mix shift into a rebounding economy have been the driver, and thus should be heavily discounted by
investors."


I don't understand the rationale for discounting this. So in the face of flat traffic they've been able to increase sales
and margins through strategic initiatives. To discount this growth and margin expansion is just plain silly. What if the
results were the opposite, increased traffic but lower sales and lower margins. Would you discount that from your
short thesis?


The long thesis is they've gone from an old, unattractive QSR model to a new (compare their remodeled stores to
legacy stores, big difference in traffic trends) fast casual format serving freshly made high quality food. This is not the
same company it was even just a few years ago. The company was teetering on bankruptcy a few years ago and now
one of the hottest IPOs, so clearly, a lot has changed.


21 Aug 2014, 09:10 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The rationale behind discounting this is its window dressing. There is nothing wrong with the
QSR model...look at popeyes still growing and sporting great margins. We discount this margin expansion
and 'growth' because it is highly warranted. Their traffic comps speak for themselves. As for the pricing driving
margin expansion well if you want to bet on that kind of avg check driven comp remaining sustainable
amongst hispanics in la go ahead. This coming quarter your payroll expense where 88% of your stores are
located jumps 12%. End of next year another 11%. Run the math on the ebitda drag that generates going
forward and you'll apprecciate that the recent price hikes impact on store economics should be discounted
and thats before any sort of slowdown in traffic is considered.


21 Aug 2014, 09:31 AM


LeverageIsLiving
I don't think you can plainly dismiss average check growth as unsustainable. You can drive that by either
increasing pricing or selling more products per transaction, ie. family meals, desserts, beverages, etc. There's
more than one way to cook this chicken and I think management deserves some credit for the past 2 years of
solid execution. You're also not factoring in growth of franchise stores.


I guess the point is you can pick data points and make the argument why it's not sustainable, and I think you
make some fine arguments. But what I see is a different business than it was a few years ago, so I would
"discount" the past failures, and I think the management team is top notch. They have the right concept, the
right management team, and they're heading in the right direction. That being said, I wouldn't buy the stock

here since it's not cheap, I think upside/downside is fairly balanced. But if it goes to the low 20s or teens I'd be
all over it.


21 Aug 2014, 10:02 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The point here is you in fact can dismiss it. Its being driven by pricing not traffic, and its
about to see some cost offsets. All chains break this out especially when its this meaningful, and go look at
EPL Intermediate's 10-ks and you can see they would break out when they took price increases in the past as
a private company. The fact that it doesn't make it into the prospectus is quite convenient. We did a pretty
thorough job of looking into pricing in LA over past 4 years and its impossible to ignore especially on the
popular family chicken meals, sides, and value items.


And if you want there are some spots on the web that have good capture of menus at chains over the last
decade. This link compares epl 2002 and 2013 http://bit.ly/XCR8DX


Suffice to say if you look at rev growth over that period as well as unit growth its clear traffic/mkt share for
them has been a problem and samestore sales growth is just keeping up with inflation.


But yes management has done a excellent job though rates coming down and rebounding economic activity
are 95% of the story here. That can btw be said for many names which is what happens in such an
environment. The fragile models start to look robust and as soon as the tide pulls back you see just how
fragile they were. EPL is about as obvious as it gets with respect to being able to identify that.


And to be clear at the IPO price this was 14-15x ebitda..run through every single dining/fast food/fast casual
listed name out there and you will quickly get how at that level it still looks like a disasterously priced stock.


21 Aug 2014, 10:39 AM


LeverageIsLiving
I'm not interested in what happened 10 years ago. Look at their performance the last 2 years, their comp
performance has been better than most of their peers. Pricing is part of story, but menu innovation also plays
a part. You're not giving them credit for being able to increase prices without hurting traffic. You can't increase
prices forever, but you can introduce new items, run promotions, add a new daypart ie breakfasts or late
night, amongst other things to increase traffic.


Clearly this is what makes a market. Valuation is probably rich at 20x but I think you can absolutely argue for
14-15x given comps trade between 10 to 20x, and LOCO is growing faster than most of the comps. QSR has
been flat to up 2-3% the last few years, and fast casual at 4-6%. If you take out CMG, I'm sure fast casual is
much lower than that. LOCO comped 10% in 2012, 7% in 2013, and 7.2% in Q1 14, which was against a
8.5% comp in Q1 2013. It's clear that LOCO's impressive run is not simply due to a better economic
environment.

Suhail, great report. Is there a hard catalyst (outside of IPO unlock)? Are difficult comps coming up in 2H14, or is it
going to be 1H15 before we lap the price increases that have driven strong comps?


Also, although I agree with the short thesis, I like EPL tacos. Chicken is nothing special, kind of a dry/tasteless vehicle
for other ingredients/condiments. BUT, EPL throws the entire taco in the deepfrier so...will harden your arteries but
tastes pretty darn good.

Author’s reply »  We could have published a week ago, and to be clear we didn't think sharing our internal
analysis on this. We figured with the speed of things these days and the existence of seekingalpha someone
else would get something good out on this because it is so obvious. We also doubted this stock would
continue to trade with the volume and interest it has gotten. Thats where we were wrong. So, we figured we'd
let the bankers say their part and share our work.


On a side note we probably should have put a section in here on execution, but considering peoples varying
risk profiles we prefer not to get so granular on positions or for that matter exposure size. We will say that we
are not blackrock, and that being able to find half a million to a few million dollars worth of exposure on this is
something that works fine for us and was out there in pieces spread out over about 7 sessions. Options
however were without a doubt worth the price despite how expensive they were. It was one of those rare
instances where you say damn thats expensive, but more than worth it. 
Loco has traded 180million or so shares in 19 sessions which tells you a lot about the ownership base.
Considering the sliver that is out there the worst thing that is going to happen to this stock will have little to do
with comps, fundamentals, chipotle comparison, cnbc etc. It will simply be velocity dying down and illiquidity
setting in.

One question we have. As the drought continues to devastate California (which we know is essentially Loco's whole
business) and they are largely Hispanic-ly driven by demographic, we ponder what happens when the agriculture
industry in California continues to suffer serious reversals.


An industry which employs the bulk of those Hispanics.


Black swannish for sure, but the data is there to check it.

Portland OR and was thrilled when EPL opened here, however they only lasted 18 months. Both of these concepts
"work" in So Cal and the food is quite good, unfortunately for whatever reason it just doesn't translate beyond state

That's a fine report. However, Chipotle isn't authentic tasting! I tried it a couple of times. Chipotle is GRINO Mexican
food! Southern Cali likes the Baja Mexico flavors, I love EL POLLO LOCO taste, its closer match to Baja cuisine. That
being said, the Hispanic population has surpassed the all other ethnic groups in CA and making up 35% of the US
population. Going with my gut on this one. I'm holding on to my EL POLLO LOCO stock. I'm LONG.

Chipotle is certainly not authentic. It was created in Colorado after all. Pollo Loco is more authentic, in a way,
but that doesn't make it a better stock. People away from the border can't tell fake Mexican from real Mexican
and, frankly, why should they care?

El Pollo Loco is unmistakably Americanized franchise food, even if they start out with an authentic Mexican
concept and even hire authentic Mexican cooks. If I want REAL, homemade Mexican food I go to any of the
thousand mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Imperial Beach, Chula Vista, and San Diego. If I'm
lucky I may even find a place that serves chicken molé. And what kind of Baja restaurant doesn't serve fish
tacos? My only problem is trying to digest it afterwards without the assistance of an antacid or two.

Very well thought out and presented report. Had been loosely following the stock based on the hype. Probably ignore
it for now but sure do enjoy eating pollo asado from the local spots here in Texas.

The failed expansion in ten lucrative states is a major red flag. Being long on LOCO at the current price definitely isn't
on my list of things to do. Shorting is tempting, but there is a good possibility irrational lovers of the chain will keep the
stock price inflated for a while. I'll pass completely for now, but will be watching LOCO in the future. Thanks for the
well written article.

This stock is doomed. The valuation is crazy. I used to live by a Pollo Loco, the food is not bad but I can't see it
expanding.

@suhail Great analysis, can you please explain why you discount the increase in revenue in fast few years ? I
understand that its driven by increase in price and not increase in traffic. I am worried that this might show a trend
reversal of the company revamping its stores/ menu and consumers are willing to pay the high price.


any comments would be appreciated :)


21 Aug 2014, 01:55 PM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Sure. The increase in revenue is not exactly notable. What is notable is the increase in
operating income. When you see a chain that is not growing and with this history put up such numbers you
take a closer look. That's why the traffic/check mix is important. Everyone in f&b has up until this quarter been
on a solid 2 yr run, so you want to put it in context and see what are the drivers. Here the pricing element is
very important because of the store location concentration and target demographic. Its significant because it
has serious limitations and is generally non recurring, at least to this extent. Add in the minimum wage
increase it is preceeding, and well you take a company whose ebitda grew close to 40% over two years which
is likely to see low single digit growth over the next two even if they expand a bit and traffic is stable. Also, it is
always more helpful to look at how brands perform in weak macro scenarios. EPL was literally at the bottom
of the list in 2009/2010. Macro strength masks brand weakness especially if the comparables being examined
come off that weakness. Basically, you have a rebound element which you also have to discount. Store
closures, pricing hikes, underinvestment, stable labor, regionally concentration overhead etc all support
margin expnsion but can be huge traps if they have nothing to do with growth....that's the story here.

The history does not speak to the new management. I am curious to see how the new store in Houston makes out.
The Latino population is the fastest growing demographic in the USA and food choices stay constant within a culture.
See what the first couple of earnings reports tell you before choosing to buy or sell.

Author’s reply »  We actually view the houston selection as the 'next target mkt' as the ultimate example of
window dressing. This is a market that should have had 50 epl's 15 years ago. It's also a market that has
church's everywhere, and tons of other similar choices. If it was so attractive you'd think there would have
been franchisors clawing over each other to sign 40+ store development agreements by now. So, really what
this is about is the fact that on paper to the clueless its an easy sell...same demogrphic...natural
extension....blah blah. We'd have been more interested if they picked a market like georgia or south carolina

I was re-reading their amended S-1. It does appear that they breakout their sales comp by average check and traffic
and it is driven mostly by increases in average check. They do not break it out further into "mix shift" or "trade up" vs.
price increase. But you don't need to guess what it is, it is stated in the SEC filings. So the increase has been about
13% due to price/mix shift vs. 6.7% due to traffic or 2-1.


Page 84 out of 288


1. Comparable sales for 13 weeks ending March, 2014 was an increase of 5.4%. The increase was due to an
increase in avg check size of 4.0% and increase in traffic of 1.4%


2. For 2013, comparable sales increased 5.3%. 2.7% from average check size and 2.7% from traffic.


3. For 2012, comparable sales increased 8.6%. 6.0% was average check and 2.6% from traffic.


What is interesting is that even with these increases in average check, the "per person spend" is only $5.83. BKW is
$6.11 "per transaction".


Anytime a restaurant stock more than doubles from its IPO price in a few days, the bigger the chance that it is
extremely over priced. A $1B market cap for this company does seems more than excessive, but the fact that it is
apparently impossible to borrow and has such a high rebate shows that, it is obvious to a lot of folks (but not the
current holders who need to sell to drive the price down). Eventually they will stumble and the valuation will contract,
just like all the others have done at some point in their corporate life (including CMG, which will eventually see their
multiple contract again as well which is not a stunning original insight on my part). That is the nature of growth
restaurant investing.


I am amazed anyone compares this company to CMG. The only similarity is they sell some version of Mexican food.
LOCO is typical QSR with large drive through business and $6 check. CMG focuses on organic food (COGS % one of
the highest in the industry) and limited menu, has much smaller drive through business, but focuses on line speed
(one of the lowest labor % of sales in industry) and a $9 average check.


No position, no other opinion, but did want to add some additional info on two of your main points.


BTW User 20920471, this report was also published in SumZero the same day.

Author’s reply »  You hit on something we were very curious about in our analysis. Some of the older epl 10-
ks as well as their 2006 s-1 disclosed average check size and it was at $8.90 in 2006. For some reason they
have chosen to drop that metric and replace it with and average spend per person which we can only imagine
has a lot to do with the family meals making up a 1/3 of sales. So we bet with all the price hikes since 2006
avg check per transaction is somewhere north of $10. They clearly have chosen to adjust the family meals
based on estimated people served to get at their per person spend. Changing metric disclosures is by our

The world is changing when it comes to desiring a higher quality of food. You see 
this in restaurants and fast food joints without exception. The Chipotle narrative is hard evidence as their customer
easily accepted a price increase without a fall-off in support. 
AUTHENTICITY is not at play here. Run a 10 minute infomercial 3x a day and see if 
Chipotle loses customers when told that their food is INauthentic. LOCO just has to  
be far better than TBell and the like and charge prices customers make peace with. 
And Of Course, it has to be able to expand successfully (doesn't mean nationally) and manage the dough better than
they have. They do that and they easily make it to 50 in 18 to 20 months.

I agree with this article and am confident LOCO will crash and burn at some point. I've been expressing my own
disbelief to my friends/family at what this stock has done since the recent IPO. How anybody can think a franchise like
Pollo Loco that came oh so close to going the way of Koo Koo Roo will all of a sudden do a 180 and turn into the next
Chipotle is way beyond me. Amazingly (in)efficient markets at work, LOL.

LOCO has ZERO chance of being the next Chipotle. I can see how young, trust fund supported Californians
who have a familiarity with LOCO and can't be bothered to research the legitimate prospects of the company
would be willing to drop $100,000 of their seven digit inheritance while hoping to make $500,000 in less than
5 years. Guess what? That isn't happening at the current LOCO price of 30. The author did legitimate
professional research and nailed it.

Great article. I think the most damning evidence about LOCO is how the float has turned over many, many times,
even intraday, suggesting it has been trading solely based on momentum and intraday technical analysis and not
fundamentals.


21 Aug 2014, 04:12 PM


Brennanhay
I agree with the author, and am happy to see such a detailed analysis such as this, but am going to add to it.


Previously, El Pollo Loco had a real niche - superior fresh chicken for tacos & tortillas that was made to order, grilled
on the spot. Incredibly fresh and tasty, they were a delicious establishment. Despite the excellent food, I don't know
that the business of made-to-order fresh chicken tacos could scale up to the level of becoming a national chain or
competing with Chipotle.


In order to scale up, their menu has changed substantially. It now looks like Taco Bell II. That is not the awesome food
that made them the place to go in Southern California. In attempting to ramp up for size, they have seriously
COMPROMISED PRODUCT QUALITY. This for me is almost an unforgivable sin.


If you compare Chipotle to top notch burrito stands, Chipotle can definitely compete with them. Chipotle has
maintained quality while scaling up in size. I can go to Chipotle, get an epic sized burrito that tastes good and has
quality ingredients* for a decent price.


El Pollo Loco cannot do this, and since they have compromised what was previously a great product to scale up, I
would not touch them with a 10 foot pole. That speaks greatly about management; this company is no Chipotle.

Very good research and article. LOCO will no longer be on my watch-list. The only flaw I found is related to spelling. I

Excellent article.


I haven't been planning on investing in LOCO, but the stock caught my eye and I've been following it, because like a
lot of other folks here, I used to like their chicken when I lived in the South Bay.


However, for some reason, all I can think of is the rise and fall of Boston Chicken (now reincarnated as Boston
Market) - IPO in November 1993, filed Chapter 11 in October 1999.


I am pretty sure the details between the two companies are different. I seem to remember that Boston Chicken was
mostly franchises, and there was a plan for a huge number of new stores, but it wasn't a viable plan.


But, ever since then, whenever I hear that I can get rich investing in a chicken restaurant, I hold onto my wallet.

Go into any El Pollo Loco restaurant in Southern California at 12:00 PM or 7:00 PM and you will be waiting for your
food. 
Try any of those other Chicken chains at that time and you will not have the traffic. Go outside California and try and
find a healthy protein source and you are out of luck. Chipotle give you a tablespoon of meat. Not an option for
feeding a 275 lb muscular beast. 
There is a lot of useless opinion and useless side story in this article, otherwise interesting analysis.  
I would not be game to short this stock.


22 Aug 2014, 06:40 AM

So your point is El Pollo Loco will shine long term because it is so appealing to all the 275 lb muscular beasts
out there? I think the average 275 lb American is far from muscular and has little need or desire for healthy
protein. Average American is an obese sloth and is primarily motivated to buy what tastes good and not what
is good for you.

I was looking at the volatility curve yesterday and I was mistaken. The vol actually declines as you move away from at
the money. But anyone out there looking to short, afraid of borrow costs, consider if you buy high vol, you also sell
high vol when spreading.


22 Aug 2014, 08:52 AM


Deja Vu, Contributor
This is a 1 billion market cap company. Options only go out to mid 2015 (a few months or a couple of quarters from
now with earnings easily "managed" until lockups expire). Stock is doubtless heavily shorted. Borrowing costs are
also doubtless high.


Regarding shorting the stock directly I have a Cynking feeling about this. All it would take is for one Loeb or Icahn or
Ackman (even!) to buy stock on the quiet and declare they believe in this company and shorts will get squeezed. For
all you know, they could buy a block from the founders and announce it. The same founder who knowing someone is
going to be short squeezing, will happily lend their shares that they don't sell, out to short.


I am sure someone will say "well he can't buy more than 5% before filing" or bank on some other false protection. The
rapacious whales on Wall Street will easily and legally get around such flimsy protections. The 1 billion market cap is
pocket change for the whales, but the $5 or 10 billion they can reap from a squeeze isn't.


Remember on WS the whispers spread. When a whale piles in, there usually a shoal of hedge fund sharks in the
wake, who will also buy long to initiate a squeeze.


The thesis is undoubtedly right and undoubtedly unactionable. Lot of people who had exposure in the thousands to
CYNK, found themselves in the hole for millions. Having a few millions in exposure to a LOCO short can easily result
in a billion dollar loss in a squeeze.


Remember, unlike CYNK ( a little too obvious), if done right in moderaton, with the right plausible business model, the
right "no brainer" comments, the shorts will be bankrupted without anyone lifting a finger to save them. With SA
having a mostly retail investor readership, someone may actually short LOCO without even calls as a hedge.

To the author: what seemingly extremely bright people and hedge funds always fail to realize is that when sentiment
shifts to one extreme because it just seems "obvious", that's when the trade feels the most pain. The problem with
your thesis right now, although obviously correct, is that too many people agree with you!! The street never reward
those people. Over the next few trading days, you will continue to see this stock rise as it did today and your short will
frankly look stupid eventhough justified. I initiated a long position the minute I read this article because it was the 5th
article in a row stating the obvious. I suggest you cover your short in the short term if you are as smart as you write!!!
In the meantime, I'm laughing all the way to the bank while you and your clients sweat!!

Its true that most of the articles placed on the SA feed are for the purposes of writers (Capital Groups) to talk their
book, take advantage of market reactions with front running and pre-positioning and to be able to early release to
inside members of their group and friends.


Its also true that SA articles are not taken seriously anymore nor even read regularly because of these integrity
problems.


In the above article, all that needs to be done to fully negate this entire report is for LOCO to buy Fiesta Restaurant
Group which is very much rumored and possible. This would knee squeeze shorts very badly and make LOCO a
much more legitimate growth play with Full US coverage a fast reality. Until then it will get shorted often. Many new
LOCO investors still think to this day that the Pollo Loco and Pollo Tropical chains are the same corp which magnifies
US locations and sales potential greatly. Currently these two chains "each are only have of a full story" and their
respective stock prices should reflect this until a merger takes place.

Rudy, your post is somewhat offensive versus SA and the contributors. We can have different ideas, may be
some articles are written with the intention to move the market, but Suhail and its members have an history of
positive long term records: VEEV, LULU, MLNX,CVLT,WFM, as short to name a few. I wrote only 5 articles
(MCD, MYGN, GSH), but each of them gave a profitable short or medium term trade. Of course shorting is
risky, expensive, and timing is very important. There is the risk of an intervention by someone like Ichan as
someone mentioned, but even in this case if the thesis is correct I am not afraid to short. I shorted HLF

EPL eventual stock collapse is not a matter that is up for debate. It is a sure thing. Forget the fundamental case for a
second and simply focus on the trading dynamics. The stock is turning over its entire float on a regular basis two
months after listing. We figure the holding period on this name is being measured in seconds. Day Traders clearly
have gravitated to it and that has brought it in HFT crowd. This is why its not like your typical low float paper
overvalued ipo despite the fact that the pe owners here have not yet had the opportunity to exit. The stock cracks the
$100 million value level multiple times on a weekly basis. Velocity driven trading like this sows the seeds of its own
destruction. Fiesta Restaurant group trades 1% of its float daily and thats with 90%+ of its outstanding shares floated.
Loco's daily volumes should be at least sub 500k with the current float if not closer to 100k by now that is of course
assuming anyone actually was willing to 'own' the stock at these levels. Make no mistake that element and not the
'growth' story etc is what has the stock up here. The fundamental debate is what applies to whether you think this is a
$5 or $15 stock. This means the ride down to $20 will be rather uneventful as far as news flow and simply a function
of inevitable collapse in daily scalpers as the computers providing this liqudity for day trading on this level move
elsewhere . So, if your investment thesis is predicated on day trading loco every day with a flat exposure overnight

thats great. However, if you actually go to bed long this stock for swing trades and scalps, well, don't be shocked if
you wake up one day to a 25% decline that effectively decapitates your entire strategy. We are on the other hand
quite comfortable with our margin for error here.

With LOCO at $ 22.28 today (11 Dec 2014), would you say your analysis back in August was correct?

The rebound looks impressive, but it is trending down. The recent high at 40.89 is a lower high compared to August
high of 41.70. I am looking at a new low below 28.56.

Suhail hits it on the nose. RED FLAG on the volume relative to float. This is a time bomb. Not saying crash scenario,
but when the spivs leave, there might not be much left..

Restaurants are starting to take off again as evidenced by this mornings Visa report showing that restaurants were
the number 1 group percentage wise to see increases this holiday season. I believe the low energy costs, rising
wages, and improving employment will create positives for the whole industry.

Hardly. If you were able to short the stock, which wasn't easy to borrow, you paid 108% a year stock
borrowing fee, which ate up over twice of what you've gained on the price drop.

Same results if you did this using options, as the Put-Call parity point was shifted to a zero-arbitrage price,
making such trades effectively identical to borrowing the shares.


This is one of those trades that looks great on paper, unless you try to actually carry it out in the real world.

Author’s reply »  6 months in the money options at publishing worked quite well (150% return). They were
expensive, but still well worth it. Borrow costs eventually came off as well, but yes you had to tactically trade
this a couple of times if you were not using options. But like most of these this played really well around the
anticipation of an early secondary which ultimately was all it took the break down the stock.
