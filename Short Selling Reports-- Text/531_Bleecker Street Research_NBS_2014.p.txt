NeoStem: Changing The Goalposts Midgame And A Potentially Biased
Analyst

by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


NBS recently ran-up in front of expected Phase 2 data.


NBS failed its primary endpoint, but changed the endpoint mid-trial.


Maxim analyst Jason Kolbert who has a buy on the stock was previously employed
by NBS and may own shares.


On November 14, Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert put out a bullish note on NeoStem,
Inc. (NBS) in front of Phase 2 data. The note combined with apparent market enthusiasm
for this data helped propel shares up 40% in two weeks before the event. On November
17, when the data was due, it appeared that Mr. Kolbert could take a victory lap. The
press release from NeoStem read:


NeoStem Announces Initial Positive Data from Phase 2 PreSERVE AMI Clinical
Trial"


It's all good right? Well not really. As Adam Feuerstein from TheStreet pointed out:

NBS10, formerly known as AMR-001, is an autologous stem-cell therapy derived
from a patient's own bone marrow. When injected back into patients following a heart
attack, the stem cells are supposed to restore blood flow, rebuild damaged cardiac
muscle and improve function.


Except in NeoStem's study, NBS10 fell short on two primary endpoints designed to
assess the therapy's efficacy. The study used non-invasive imaging to assess blood
flow through the heart, six months after a single infusion of NBS10 or a placebo.
There was no difference between NBS and placebo, NeoStem said.


The study's other co-primary efficacy endpoint was a measurement of adverse
cardiac "MACE" events -- defined as cardiovascular death, a repeat heart attack,
heart failure hospitalization and coronary revascularization. To date, 17% of patients
treated with NBS10 have suffered a MACE event compared to 19% of patients in the
placebo arm -- a difference which was not statistically significant.


But it gets worse. As ZZLangerhans points out, NeoStem actually changed the primary
endpoint of its trial. You can see all of the changes here. But what is important is that
NeoStem talked down the mention of myocardial perfusion, because NeoStem saw no
difference in the data. NeoStem talked up Major Adverse Cardiac Events, because they
saw encouraging but not statistically significant numbers. Below is a screenshot of the
changes.


You can view all of the changes here. If you are wondering whether or not this is legal you
are not alone. Derek Lowe called it "over the line." At the very least, it could be a sign that
this is not the highest quality of biotech companies.


Jason Kolbert and NeoStem


Jason Kolbert may not be entirely unbiased. In 2011, NeoStem announced he was joining
NeoStem as Vice President of Strategic Business Development. Here is Jason Kolbert
being interviewed by CorporateProfile in March 2011.

Here is a sample of some of CorporateProfile's work. It appears to be a quasi-Investor
Relations site that uses semi-attractive models to interview CEOs and other Officers of
microcap companies.


Jason Kolbert also owns some NeoStem stock, his last SEC Form 4 shows he owned
8,000 shares. Perhaps this is a conflict of interest. And maybe that is why Mr. Kolbert
remains bullish on the stock, saying that NeoStem results were positive when they clearly
were not.


End Game


NeoStem had $17M in cash burn last quarter. With only $4M in quarterly revenues and a
market cap of $155M NeoStem appears wildly overvalued, especially in light of these
recent events. If cash burn continues at this rate then it will be out of cash within two
quarters unless it does a substantial capital raise, which will likely be dilutive. If the market
is still enthusiastic about NeoStem then they may be able to pull it off, to extend their life

as a biotech for a few more years. If enthusiasm subsides and more investors become
aware of these issues, then it will likely end with NeoStem unable to raise enough capital
to continue. Eventually going to zero.


Note: I have contacted NeoStem with these concerns and have not received a response.

As another poster noted elsewhere, it's kind of funny that when someone is short and writes an article, they
are to be dismissed because they are short. But when they are not short and write an article they are to be
dismissed because they "don't put their money where their mouth is".


Yet if someone is long and puts out a pump piece it should be taken as gospel.

ones that portend an extension of life while maintaining a high safety profile. Can you imagine a cancer

endpoint, and missing on tumor shrinkage but showing the treatment increased patient's overall survival by
40%-100%? Would this be touted as a failure? Of course not. But perhaps this author already knows that.


NBS10 is showing striking response, and it's only a matter of time before it's confirmed in follow up data.

Then why didn't NeoStem make MACE or mortality the primary endpoint of the trial to begin with? Because
they're stupid?


21 Nov 2014, 10:25 AM


Steven Giardino, Contributor
They clearly assumed they would see a diff in perfusion, and it is an endpoint that can be found quickly. The
other endpoints are more difficult to meet, and they were probably less confident in meeting them in the tight
window of time that they had to work with before the AHA scientific sessions.

I sincerely hope that others , looking for answers to what has just happened to NBS's 'SP' follow your
comments & your write-up , 
" NeoStem's NBS10 And Data That Matters To Regulators " 
Nov. 20, 2014 7:30 AM ET !! also here in 'seeking alpha' . 
Your article was well written with all the technical data explained, as such a 'BIO' stock should be written!! Not
just a BASHING as this article has clearly demonstrated !! & for good ridden. I have the distinct impression
that the word " STREET " in his title is there for a reason..


These actions sort of remind me of another stock i was into get the big 'STREET' hammer a couple of years
ago .. ARNA Pharmaceuticals ..


Thank you Steven !! Keep the awesome research !!!

I don't disagree that this clinical trial data release was handled poorly by Neostem management. For god's
sake if you make a mistake at least own it and present the results in a straight forward way. But how is what
you are doing any different? You and your buddy AF are twisting the results of a very important trial, that
could in the end save many lives, to further your own ends. Leaving out any positive results and using your
"platform" for your own gain makes your credibility a joke.

Do you have any idea what you are talking about? The final endpoints are the ones the FDA cares about (reduction in
death and decrease in MACE). It's also possible that SPECT was just not the right way to test for perfusion (the
original endpoint they disregarded).


The only bias that has been seen was Adam F saying the results were negative when they were clearly positive. Lies,
lies, and more lies.

2. You talk about no differences but NO DEATHS don't count??? 
3. The final endpoint HAS NOT EVEN BEEN DISCUSSED since we will not reach that with all the DATA for another
year! 
4. They said POSITVE DATA for which it was at the 6 month point! 
Pick and choose shorty it all come around!

Ok, i normally do not react to articles, but this is too much. First of all, I am currently not short neither long (few
months ago I was long, but I sold all my shares couple months ago). So now. The article does not bring anything new.
First part is just copy of Adam Feuerstein opinion, next part is copy of ZZLangerhans opinion and finally maybe the
last par is not copy of someone else work. The results were "big fail" because AF wrote it? Or does autor have some
background in biotech (like education or years of experience etc.) and can bring at least in comments his own
opinion? Next, as someone else already pointed, SEC form 4 is from 2011, so really old one. And if Jason Kolbert still
holds his shares, it is not 8000 but 800, because of reverse split (I know you used word "owned" not "owns", but it is
still misleading). This is big difference (but if I am missing something, please correct me).....next, according this email
http://bit.ly/11D0aSt which was post by ZZLangerhans, boys and girls :) from NBS did not do anything illegal, but I
agree with that it is not "right"......So what I am traing to say is, that in my opinion, only reason why someone post this
articles full of misleading words and opinions of someone else is to make some money...I do not have problem if you
are short, but I realy have problem with this article (and sorry for my english :) )

time.

I'm an investor in NBS and while I'm still holding long, I there are some worrying points about the trial data. It's
undeniable that the original trial primary endpoint were not reached, even though the test data indicated statistically

significant improvement in SAES and 0 mortality rate in the control group. Phase 1 trial data suggested that there
would be new vessel growth as part of the hypothesis and proof of concept that AMR works. If the hypothesis is
disproved, then where is the science? Correlation does not equal causation.


That said, reading the data does suggest that higher dosages of the treatment provides ever-higher improvement for
the patient and suggests a positive effect. There are three reasons I can think of for why this is happening: one, the
vessels are being created but aren't being captured by single-photon emission imaging, two, there is another reason
that injecting stem cells into the heart is improving patient health, or three, this is all just a coincidence.


The FDA however doesn't care about spectral imaging - all they care about is the result, reduced cardiac events. I'm
pretty sure the FDA would approve anything, even magic, if it can be proven that the treatment works and has
negligible negative health effects. The data does suggest that the treatment works in some way unknown, but not in
the way the hypothesis suggests. Statistical significance sounds pretty convincing, but you have to remember the
sample size as well. That said, the candidate will probably go into phase 3 testing without SPECT imaging as an
endpoint.


I think the market is right to be skeptical, but if you think the treatment works, increase your position. I was
disappointed with the lack of SPECT imaging, but the data is very suggestive that the treatment works - in some way.


0 mortality is really impressive no matter how you cut it at the end of the day.


21 Nov 2014, 01:15 PM


jason43343
@Carlton_Watson, in fact, in statistics we can only say that something is statistically significant if it's p value
is less than 0.05. This means that we can only report statistical significance if there's less than a five percent
chance that the patterns they found were a result of chance, or if fluke. NBS has the numbers overwhelmingly
in their favor for what the FDA is looking for.


22 Nov 2014, 02:19 AM


Carlton_Watson
Jason, I'm aware that the p value is in support of the treatment improving patient quality of care looking at the
dose-dependent decrease in SAES and MACE and that's not the problem. The problem is that the underlying
hypothesis for the treatment has all but been disproved because there was only a 2% increase in cardiac
perfusion improvement for the control group vs. placebo, which was one of the primary endpoints. Basically,
they said going into phase 2 that the science of AMR-001 is that it creates new blood vessels with the stem
cell treatments and that this is quantifiable through 3D topography with SPECT imaging. That premise has
been proven incorrect. That's what's worrying; a treatment that seems to work on the surface but has no
scientific explanation for working.


I also said that sample size is another factor to consider and that statistical significance in title only is
misleading. When they say that there is statistically significant evidence to suggest that the treatment works,
what they mean is that the null-hypothesis has not been rejected within their established parameters beyond
their established degree of certainty. You can obtain statistical significance by flipping a coin five times with a
null-hypothesis that says this coin is fair (h0=0.5)and an alternate hypothesis that says this coin is biased

(h1>0.5), and getting five heads. It is possible to get 5 heads in a row (c value = 5 for 5 consecutive events
provides a p value somewhere around 3%), but based on this experiment, the alternate hypothesis is 'proven'
to be statistically significant. With small sample sizes like it is with this PRESERVE trial, the data isn't reliable
even if it's 'statistically significant' because five heads in a row does not prove that all coin flips will result in
heads with this coin. This data is not reliable unless the sample size is larger.


As I said correlation does not equal causation in my opening paragraph, and why it is so disappointing that
cardiac perfusion was not shown to be significant. Their hypothesis was proven wrong. It's science,
disappointing science.

This is the first time since seeking alpha was kicked off of Yahoo's finance pages that I have bothered reading
anything on seeking alpha, and find that it still contains nothing but garbage written by anonymous amateurs who are
constantly working to bolster their respective positions and profit by either pumping or bashing.

that I'll check back in the future but i won't. You're not worth the time.

He had the 5 puts that expired Friday and profited about 300% if he sold at the right time. Thanks!

Everyone talks about DD. Well I've done mine and am very happy with what I see. 
The company is funded through September of next year. They will need additional capital to conduct the Phase III
melanoma trial and expand PCT, but we're talking only $25 million in additional capital needs for a very promising
Phase III trial, (~15% dilution - not bad at all), and in any case there is no reason they can't partner with someone to
get that trial funded with no dilution. I would rather see them spend $25 million more to grow PCT. We know what's in
the pipeline of the company. We have no idea what revenue streams, gross profit margin increases, and strategic
relationships could develop through PCT. I expect to be surprised by very impressive yr/yr growth in PCT revenue and
gross margin. I also love the fact they are compensating employees with equity. It really aligns the interests of those
spending the money with the shareholders in the best way possible. Also, directors are making meaningful additional
purchases. Additionally, there are upcoming presentations on technology developments at PCT, as well as maybe
some additional info on the prospects of the T-Cell therapies acquired through Athelos for none other than drum-
roll...Type 1 diabetes (340 million patients worldwide on very cost-intensive life-saving treatment). Not to mention the
ongoing dermatological investigation of VSEL. There are many ways the company can surprise the market in just the
next few months. Cash requirements are not very scary, and the interests of management and shareholders are well-
aligned. By the time this baby is cash flow positive, I see about 50 million shares at $20+, billion dollar+ market cap
and leading a growth industry. Remember, GSK is over 100 billion. Can you say "acquisition target"? $10 is a near-
term price target (sometime in 2015), acquisition target in late 2016.

Also, FDA is doing accelerated and orphan status on more than one of their drugs. 
From the FDA guidelines: 
"The accelerated approval provisions of FDASIA in section 506(c) of the FD&C Act provide that FDA may
grant accelerated approval to: 
. . . a product for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition . . . upon a determination that the product
has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical
endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to
predict an effect on 
irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence
of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
Examples of cases in which FDA has used an intermediate clinical endpoint to support accelerated approval
include the following: 
A treatment for multiple sclerosis was approved based on a large therapeutic effect on relapse rate through
approximately 13 months of treatment, but where there was uncertainty about the durability of the observed
effect. Under accelerated approval, the sponsor was required to continue the existing trials into the
postmarketing period to confirm durability of the observed effect at 2 years. "

In other words: 13 months of data is not unheard of to approve a drug for wider use. Also, at the end of the
document attached, they say an important consideration is whether manufacturing and product quality for
expanded use is reliable. As PCT is the leader in this respect, I think they have a strong possibility of the FDA
moving things forward faster than even the bulls are expecting.
