Exact Sciences - Flushing $$$ Down The Drain (2 Of 5)
Jul. 25, 2013 12:45 PM ET73 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


As a reminder, in part one we illustrated why the Cologuard test by Exact Sciences
(NASDAQ:EXAS) is actually less effective than the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT).


In part two of our five part series, we examine the economics of the Cologuard test and
find that Cologuard is significantly more expensive than the FIT. We believe Cologuard's
high costs don't make sense and don't support reimbursement. Remember, for the
Company to be successful it will need to show that Cologuard is an effective test, gain
reimbursement, convince doctors to prescribe the test, and make a simple enough test
that patients will use it. If Exact Sciences fails in any of these endeavors, it is worth at best
the value of the cash on its balance sheet, or less than $3 per share. We believe Exact
should be aggressively sold or shorted.


In order to show that Cologuard is not economically sensible and doesn't support
reimbursement, we are going to show an economic comparison between using Cologuard
and using FIT. We will use the same results as we did in our first article and the data from
the June 2013 EXAS Presentation. This time, we are also going to show the actual costs
of these tests. We will then sensitize the total costs based on various price points for
colonoscopies. Finally, we will get to the bottom of what actually matters: an economic
comparison of Cologuard vs. InSure FIT, the current leader in non-invasive colon cancer
screening.


Inside The Numbers


First, we need to review known expenses so that the tests can be compared:


1. The expected cost of the Cologuard test is $400, and is designed to be given once
every three years (see Canaccord Genuity estimates here)


2. The cost of the FIT is $23, and is designed to be given every year ($69 over three
years) also per the Canaccord Genuity estimates


3. The average cost of a colonoscopy is $2,777,  ranging from the low end of $900 to the
high end of $3,764


Below are the Cologuard and FIT trial statistics as they were presented by the Company:

1. Taken from slide 16
2. Taken from slide 20, the true precancerous sensitivity for the Cologuard test
3. Taken from slide 18


Next, we can examine the expected cost of testing 10,000 people with the Cologuard test:


Cologuard Is 53% More Expensive, Even Though It Is Less Effective


Over the course of the three-year period, if each of the 10,000 patients represented here
took a Cologuard test in year 1 for $400, it would cost a total of $4 million for the tests
alone. Then, each expected correct positive result (both cancerous and pre-cancerous)
and each expected false positive result would be subject to a colonoscopy at the average
cost of $2,777, or approximately another $4.4 million. Therefore, the total expected cost
for these 10,000 patients, as shown in the table would be nearly $8.4 million.


If these same 10,000 patients each took a FIT in year one, it would cost $230,000 for the
test in year one. In year two, because colonoscopies (which are good for 10 years) were
already given to 652 people, only 9,348 tests would be needed. Continuing this
methodology through year 3, these 10,000 patients would have taken a total of 28,125
tests for $646,884, or approximately 16% of the cost of the 10,000 Cologuard tests. Over
the three years, a total of 1,738 colonoscopies would be needed for a total cost of about

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1571592-exact-sciences-flushing-down-the-drain-2-of-5 3/23


$4.8 million, adding up to a total cost over three years of approximately $5.5 million. After
all is said and done, Cologuard would cost 53% more than a generic FIT despite
generating worse results.


One last thing to note is that all of this cost of additional colonoscopies for FIT patients
isn't necessarily negative. Over the three years, the FIT is expected to catch 53 more
patients in need of colonoscopies (2 cancerous and 51 precancerous). At an average
price of $2,777, this amounts to $147,181 in colonoscopy charges that the Cologuard test
did not register because it simply missed finding people who really should have gotten a
colonoscopy.


So, in summary, below is a side by side comparison of the expected results and costs of
the two tests:


It is blatantly obvious that the FIT is the better and more cost effective test. The FIT
is expected to find more people with cancerous polyps (61 vs. 59) and more people with
precancerous polyps (367 vs. 316), while letting fewer people in need of colonoscopies go
undetected (388 vs. 441). And despite the worse outcomes, Cologuard is expected to cost
38%-145% more than FIT. This table also clearly shows that regardless of the price
of a colonoscopy, the FIT will ALWAYS outperform the Cologuard test, and will do
so for less money!


In order for Cologuard to have a chance, Exact would need to price Cologuard at about
$112 per test, or 72% less than Exact envisions. Only then would it be cost neutral to FIT
based on the relative performance of Cologuard and FIT when Colonoscopies are priced
at $2,777. Such a reduction would still not fully account for the overall worse efficacy of
the Cologuard test, though the lower price would probably make the test uneconomic and
accelerate the downward spiral in the Company's finances.


The Minimum Comparison that the CMS and Insurers Will Likely Use

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1571592-exact-sciences-flushing-down-the-drain-2-of-5 4/23


In this section, we will run the same calculations with the data that we strongly believe that
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and insurers in general will use to
determine reimbursement. It should be noted here that it is becoming increasingly difficult
to obtain reimbursement from CMS, as evidenced by the fact that they will be cutting
reimbursement for independent laboratories by 26%. This can be seen on page 588 here.
Further to that, we will no longer be using the outdated and insignificant results the
Company propagates. Instead, we believe that CMS and insurers will take a more holistic
view of the sensitivity and specificity of FIT and use metrics closer to the seven study
average we compiled in part one. As a reminder, the comparison between Cologuard and
an average FIT would be:


Using FIT Historical Averages, Cologuard Is 40% More Expensive, And Even Less
Effective


Based on the above information, we believe that CMS and insurers will be extraordinarily
unlikely to approve Cologuard for reimbursement. Not only is Cologuard expected to be
more expensive than FIT, but it is also expected to have worse outcomes:


FIT correctly finds 63 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds only 59

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1571592-exact-sciences-flushing-down-the-drain-2-of-5 5/23


FIT correctly finds 579 of pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
FIT only misses 174 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses 441
FIT results in 1,277 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194


The Comparison that CMS and Insurers Should Use: InSure FIT


While CMS and insurers are likely to look at broad averages when they consider
Cologuard for reimbursement, there's a decent chance that they actually focus on the
InSure FIT, which is the single best FIT we have been able to identify. The reason for
focusing on the InSure FIT is because InSure is designed as a take-home test, much like
Cologuard, while many other FITs are designed to be done in the doctor's office. To
review, the results of the InSure FIT can be found here. To be 100% fair to the Cologuard
test, we sent an inquiry to InSure to find out how much it costs. They responded by saying
that, "The test is priced regionally - between $75-$100." While InSure FIT is more than
three times the average FIT price of $23, it is still less than a quarter of Cologuard's $400
price. We will be making these comparisons over a relevant three-year period using $100
as the price for the InSure FIT in order to prove that nobody, regardless of the region that
they live in, would be better off using Cologuard instead of the InSure FIT.


In a table format, the data are the following:


Compared To The InSure FIT, Cologuard Is 16% More Expensive, And Significantly
Less Effective


The Cologuard results will not change at approximately $8.4 million in total. In contrast,
the InSure FIT results, using $100 as the price point would be as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1571592-exact-sciences-flushing-down-the-drain-2-of-5 6/23


Using these accurate and relevant data, we can now see that in all cases, we would
expect the InSure FIT to have substantially better results than the Cologuard test, while
the Cologuard test would be expected to cost 16% more:


InSure FIT correctly finds all 64 cancerous tumors while Cologuard finds only 59
InSure FIT correctly finds 610 of pre-cancerous lesions while Cologuard finds 316
InSure FIT only misses 142 patients in need of a colonoscopy while Cologuard misses
441
InSure FIT results in 905 unnecessary colonoscopies while Cologuard results in 1,194
InSure FIT's 97% specificity allows it to cut down so much on false positive results
that, similar to our prior example, it is better than the Cologuard test at any
colonoscopy price point


In conclusion, the InSure FIT dominates the Cologuard test in every applicable category
over three years at a lower cost. Under these conditions, we do not see any possible
scenario in which CMS or insurers will provide reimbursement at $400. For Cologuard to
be cost neutral, it would need to cost only $284 per test and it would still underperform the
InSure FIT by missing 299 additional patients who need colonoscopies. Adjusting for
those 299 patients who really should get colonoscopies would further lower the breakeven
cost that Exact could charge for Cologuard to $201, about half the expected price. Indeed,
we could even argue that the downstream cost of future cancers in these missed patients
who should have gotten colonoscopies should also count against Cologuard, which would
further depress Cologuard's breakeven reimbursement price.

Further, even if patients taking the InSure FIT were only compliant in two out of the three
years, the InSure FIT would still have better patient outcomes as we explained in part one.
At this level of use for InSure, Exact could only charge $86 for its test for the test to be
cost-neutral to CMS and insurers.


More to Come


This article, number two in our five part series, proved that the top existing tests in the
market, the FIT and InSure FIT, provide a better economic value and a better set of
outcomes than Cologuard.


In part three, we will discuss why we feel that very few patients will actually use the
Cologuard test even if it gets approved. In part four, we will deconstruct the bull case, and
explain why the Cologuard test will never be the Pap smear. Finally, we will conclude by
diving further into the facts, and explaining how Exact Sciences has misled investors
(again). Stay tuned.

Oh good, a chance to buy more EXAS if this piece works to drive the price down more. I note that EXAS bounced
today precisely where I said it would...on the 50 day moving average line. If the $12.64 low holds today (after this
attack), then it should be all over for the shorts. Too bad if so, I was hoping to load up on some more at $12.50.

something concrete that may actually help us get some shares on the cheap.

Well, let's hope it just continues to be the same sort of drivel, and not TOO concrete: just enough to drive
away the weak hands and get the price down a bit more. I expect the sell side analysts to wade into the
argument soon, like they did for LINE, and continue to justify the average "buy" currently on the stock. So in
the meantime, let's make some hay!

Yes, and the battle is still on, but the stock is currently at about $27, after falling to $20. The time to buy is
when you guys launch your attacks, and the stock blows up. I didn't buy at 20, but did get it at less than 23.
The sell side came in strong after the attack (including Goldman) to debunk the ponzi scheme argument, and
the stock has stabilized and headed higher since. Of course, the 10% dividend is a real problem for shorts in
LINE, too...

Well, of course, and that "blow up" was the opportunity to make some money. The stock went down to about
$20 after the attack, and then when Goldman and others came to its support by debunking the short's "ponzi
scheme" argument, the stock floated up to the current price of $27. The argument continues, but I see holding
the stock at these levels as a "no brainer" with a 10% dividend. I doubt that you will get EXAS down below the
50 day average, but hey, go for it:-)!

ranjo
Alpha you have put a lot of work into this - a tip of the hat :) I would suggest you research high grade
dysplasia, serrated lessions and relative sensitivity based on polyp size( c.m.). Remember Cologuard is
powered to identify those precancers most likely to turn bad which are those 2 c.m. and larger. Also, Early
stage CRC can have either lymphatic OR vascular involvement. In part, how much of the submucosa wall has
been penetrated. It is possible to have CRC without shedding globin into your stool at the time of the test or
tests.  
Private payors and CMS will pay for more colonoscopies if they can avoid treatment costs of the disease that
easily start around $100k.


I guess i have one question that tells me what you really believe to be true - Your spouse, middle age
son/daughter or parent has one colonoscopy to use in their lifetime (remember the vast majority in the
screening population diagnosed with CRC never had one prior to symptoms) which test do you give them
every 3 years? FIT or Cologuard?


25 Jul 2013, 09:31 PM


ranjo
Alpha ... i'm not getting your logic. Cologuard has a FIT component to it? are you suggesting the Kras and
methylation markers are of no value in finding precancers and CRC? or that it is not worth the extra money
Cologuard costs? molecular diagnostics are going to be game changers. The screening pardigm is built into
our new healthcare system .. the affordable care act will embrace Cologuard like a beautiful new born baby
and then so by law will the private payors


25 Jul 2013, 10:33 PM

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yes - Cologuard has an FIT as part of it - I am suggesting that the DNA testing provides a
small amount of additional sensitivity with the tradeoff being losing a large amount of specificity and at a cost
of 17x FIT. The sum of the worse specificity and higher cost means that Cologuard can only be given every 3
years whereas FIT can be given annually. Annual FIT gets better results than Cologuard every 3 years,
regardless of which FIT stats you use.


26 Jul 2013, 10:17 AM


Energy-Trader
Too bad you are far too dumb to understand that there is no such thing as 100% annual compliance when it
comes to FIT testing. Hell, not even over 50%.


26 Jul 2013, 10:43 AM


Energy-Trader
Annual FIT testing with 100% COMPLIANCE is a pipe-dream of yours. 
The annual compliance rate for FIT testing is around 50%


Meanwhile, Cologuard demonstrated 66% sensitivity for 2cm pre-cancerous polyps. Your beloved FIT comes
nowhere near that kind of performance. 
Duh.


26 Jul 2013, 10:44 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  So just to be clear, you think that Colocrap compliance will be better than FIT compliance
even though colocrap is a far more complex test to administer, requires patients to handle substantially more
feces, and then requires patients to drive a box of excrement to the local UPS? You are dreaming.


26 Jul 2013, 11:38 AM


Energy-Trader
EXAS has already stated on numerous occasions that they will have a Compliance Engine that takes all of
the follow-up, paper-work, and other time consuming tasks away from the Doctor and his office. The Doctor
won't even have to furnish or stock in inventory the Cologuard kit, like he does with the FIT test. Thus,
compliance will be much higher than the FIT test.


You are terribly misinformed.... and your latest article shows that you are totally ignorant about the InSure FIT
test REQUIRING 2 SAMPLES!


The stock is UP on a day when the Dow Jones is -100 points! 
Your "attacks" aren't having any effect anymore.

You continue to miss the point.


The only FIT data that matters to the FDA and CMS is that in the Deep-C trial, a trial run on a completely
asymptomatic screening population.


None of your FIT data cherry picking matters. As i said before:


please dont forget to write in to the premiere journal editors after the trial data publication...using your real name and
your credentials...and prove your points once you have seen the largest colon cancer screening trial comparing FIT,
colonoscopy and the best molecular diagnostics has to offer after 20 years of research. Your seminal emissions are a

or 10 years?

Author’s reply »  If you use "biotech vet's" compliance numbers 95.1%, 79.9%, and 66.2% with screening and
close your eyes and pretend that morikawa is the right study then you can finally claim that Colocrap is
"better" at 56 cancers found vs 54 for Morikawa FIT and 300 pre-cancers found vs 283 for morikawa.
Unfortunately, Colocrap would result in 1,135 unnecessary colonoscopies vs 977 for morikawa and would
under these conditions cost 118% more. FIT is still the overall better test, but congratulations you can
construct a case where Morikawa catches 6% more cancers and pre-cancers for 118% more cost and 16%
more unneeded colonoscopies.

so I did that. Even then, FIT is much better than colocrap.

And it's subscription, which I'm not sure you can afford right now, but look at the very recent Barron's article
which says EXAS will be $20 in early 2014..


You are losing horribly and this is a desperate attempt to obscure facts, make lame comparisons that don't
hold water and flat out lie in order to try to induce a week few days so that you can cover. You are in BIG
trouble.

Factual rebuttal?


You still haven't answered my question about what HEDGE FUND you are associated with. Why are you
unable to disclose that?


David Jackson is obviously well aware of your position. 
Should investors of EXAS contact the SEC for an "investigative" action? 
I would imagine that many have already done so.

Just listened to the shareholder meeting recording. The CEO stressed that the DeepC trial shows a VERY significant
superiority of Cologuard over FIT, and that the results should be published later this year. Maybe he is lying?

Superiority can be judged in multiple ways, for example the data here indicates that it does a better job of
detecting cancers in the first year. I haven't listened to the call so I don't know what he said exactly.

Why are the institutional and mutual fund shareholders not selling EXAS on this analysis?


25 Jul 2013, 03:20 PM


Biotech Vet, Contributor
All the numbers presented here for FIT being superior are predicated upon a three year repeated screening. As a
commenter pointed out yesterday, it is not even clear that one can assume that the multiplicative probability
calculation for FIT is actually true since it assumes there is a random probability for any given polyp to bleed. But
most damning in this analysis is the assumption of 100% adherence to repeated yearly testing. This is a total fantasy.
The study that I cited yesterday showed in year three the compliance was down to 66%. Those data were smallish
and came from Hong Kong and involved three follow-up letters in a year. A much larger, more realistic study in the US
looked at 11,110 subjects who had already taken their fecal blood test. They found that compliance with even the
second test (never mind a third) dropped to 44% (Fenton et al. Ann Fam Med. 2010 Sep-Oct;8(5):397-401). This is
the unfortunate reality of screening in the real world.


I also point out that in yesterday's article the author continuously misleads readers by comparing apples to oranges
clinical trials. The ONLY FIT study with a gold-standard design similar to Cologuard's was the Morikawa trial from
2005, but the author persists in making comparisons to smaller, non-screening trials - a deliberate attempt to mislead
from a guy who claims that Exact Sciences is trying to mislead people.


The cost of FIT certainly makes it attractive, if you aren't worried about finding cancers in the proximal colon.

I have no loyalties to this company and honestly try to stay away from the biotech space, but just looking at the
bloomberg mean estimates over the next couple years, I think you have to be smoking something to think this
company is fairly valued right now. This company's revenue has bounced around $5 MM since 2009 and been
EBITDA negative the entire time. However, since this is a growth company I'll ignore that and instead assume the
hockey stick estimates that supposedly support this valuation actually happen. In 2014-2017, mean revenue
estimates are $39 MM, $104 MM, $194 MM, $298 MM. Despite that projected growth, they are still EBITDA negative
until 2016 (when it's $28 MM), but CFFO negative the entire time. At the same time, current valuation means they are
trading at 4x 2016 revenues (yes 3 years out). If those are the optimistic projection for the next several years of
operations used by research analysts to support this price, you cannot use any type of valuation methodology to
support a valuation close to the $760 MM EV it is currently trading at, especially given the quality and pricing
concerns (not saying he is right, but uncertainty means more risk, which means higher discount rates merited and
thus much lower stock price when cash flows don't materialize for years out under crazy looking growth assumptions)
this author is pointing out.


Given the biotech sector hype right now, in addition to the concerns pointed our by this author, I wouldn't touch this
thing... Deciding to short it is one thing and requires all the analysis that this author appears to be trying to do, but my
gosh at least don't be fool enough to think you should buy it! If you have gotten lucky off this rally, take your profits
and reinvest somewhere else where the risk/return profile is infinitely more attractive. Way too many other
opportunities out there where companies are actually undervalued...


By the way, for those of you who actually rely on research analysts to do real analysis as I have seen people say on
this website, you are being misled. Banks don't make money off equity research, but off the investment banking fees
generated by pumping up prices so they can sell equity, debt, etc. Yes, this is technically illegal but it's still how things
works regardless. Given the amount of fees paid from the recent equity offerings from this company and the M&A
fees the banks here would like to earn if this thing ever get sold, they definitely want to be in the good graces of the
company, so no research analyst wants to be the whistle blowing realist to cost their firm a nice $5-$10 MM fee.

1) priced for perfection 
2) vested interest 
2 very valid points which you make calmly as a neutral observer, and which I have been trying to make as
well. But people won't listen. They won't listen because they are cynical about it. Deep down they all believe
that Kevin Conroy will save the day and deliver the juicy trade sale he promised from day one ("I did it once,
I'll do it again, just believe me"). But Cologuard is no HPV, and my intelligence from within the industry is
positive: NO WAY ANY ESTABLISHED PLAYER WOULD EVEN CONSIDER IT. NO WAY ! But how do you
debunk that argument ? you can't. You can't google it away, and if not an established player, an ambitious
third tier player may save the day. Or so the hope ...

actually, having spoken to a few of the analysts, including Baird, it is clear that the estimates are very, very
conservative given the market space. Either Cologuard captures most of the space within 3 years or is SOL.
It's not going to be SOL. I would be shocked if estimates are not crushed relatively quickly. Barron's did an
extrapolation and is projecting $20/share next year and higher if not bought out quick, which given the poison
pill and fat balance sheet, it won't be. Expect to see EXAS over $40 within 3 years, possibly $60.

More BS from someone that is trying to look "sympathetic" towards the plight of an EXAS investor. EXAS has
nearly $160 million in cash and won't be doing a secondary for quite some time. The mean estimates that you
have cited are actually quite conservative, especially when you look at the FIT market which is 10.5 million
tests annually, which would equate to 3.5 million Cologuard. And that doesn't even take into consideration all
of those that shy away from undergoing Colonoscopy, or the FACT that annual FIT compliance is barely
50%.... something that this "author" conveniently ignores during all of his mathematical extrapolations for FIT.

I have been restricted from trading my personal account due to potential conflicts of interests and confidential
information at my prior firm. I am still very restricted and limited on what I can buy and sell for my personal
account so I leave most of my investments in my firm's funds. You are absolutely right, I just joined SA. The
site forced me to make an account recently to read an interesting looking article, and but I normally don't
spend my time contributing back, just gleaning things that looking interesting!


To build on / clarify what I said before after thinking about it more though. Who cares if the trial works or not
based on the current pricing, which is what everyone here is too caught up arguing about? Even if they knock
it out of the park with the product and hit the hockey stick estimates, do you think that means the price should
just keep increasing forever? The current market price implies that even the extremely aggressive sell side
analyst estimates are not aggressive enough, and I for one would never risk my hard earned money gambling
on the fact the the optimist case isn't aggressive enough. When even cheerleader analysts don't project the
company to be CFFO positive several years, after a yet to be proven product knocks it out of the park, there
should be major red flags. Just out of curiosity, what type of price target do all the bulls on this board think is
fair? Or is the answer just, "higher!"


Like the other user said, it is definitely priced to perfection currently, so what's the upside from here?


However, I will give props to management for selling stock at these levels to build cash though. While likely
screwing current investors, they are giving themselves a huge cushion in case things don't work out and
absolutely realize it's overpriced (the time when bankers advise management to tap the equity markets to
minimize dilution).


From the last offering prospectus, "We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
and working capital purposes, including for product development and in furtherance of our efforts to obtain
FDA approval of our Cologuard colorectal cancer screening product and product commercialization activities."
This is code for, "we don't really have a use of proceeds and are just opportunistically selling overpriced
stock" when their capex spending is negligible and they had ~2 years worth of cash reserves at their current
CFFO burn rate.


Even if estimates are 100% correct, this stock should be trading at a fraction of what it is currently (mid to low
single digits). DCF, multiples, every fundamental analysis you do on this company will tell you that (except is
of course a cash heavy strategic drinking the same kool aid). I would love someone to show me fundamental
analysis proving otherwise though...

wsvet,


Parallel review program between FDA and CMS accelerates any model's calendar. If each lab EXAS builds is
ball park $5 mil and capacity at each lab is 1 mil tests consider that 10.2 mil FIT/FOBT tests were ordered last
year. EXAS will need to partner or eventually build more labs. It appears owning your own lab is a nice ROI
and a good use of excess capital or as you said we don't really have a use of proceeds ... may not be the
case. Building out a sales/marketing team in US and of course globally via partnership or otherwise is capital
intensive .... you know that :)

Hey, it's me, the massive moron. Sorry, i really don't understand CRC screening, so I'm very confused by multiplying
non-independent #s to calculate probabilities (do all adenomas and cancers methylate? do they all bleed? what are
the implications.....help me). In addition, what is the value of catching a stage 1 cancer vs. a stage 4 cancer. What
does incidence and staging look like in the general population 20 years from now for both tests? How many stage 1s
progress to terminal cancers under both tests? How many lives are saved with both tests--survival rates are very
different by stage--probably not, right? How will FIT detect adenomas given the substantially higher incidence in
Deep-C(15%????). This staging thing is so complicated. Someone please provide a closed-form solution for all of
this, preferably in excel, I still think that topolgy is a form of topography not math so im not that smart and have trouble
with hard equations. Give me the multiplication damn it!  How do the actual treatment costs vary by test. Why can't
EXAS multiply and put their damn cost paper out. Why is it taking so long. Does Ligard not know how to use excel?

1) If the FIT test is such a quality test (and by your measure so much better than what Cologuard will offer), why does
there continue to be over 100k of new CRC cases every year along with 50k deaths? FIT tests have been around for
a long time, correct? If the test was truly preventative, wouldn't docs give this test out for every person over the age of
say 35? Wouldn't CRC be eradicated by now?


2) By characterizing management and the company as liars, you are also calling the Mayo clinic a bunch of no good
liars as well. Why would they be pushing "fake" numbers? Isn't their credibility as a leading health institute on the line
as well if all these numbers are just made up?


3) Why hasn't management sold any shares? I mean we all know a couple of biotechs out there where management
has cashed in at the expense of shareholders and P2 hype.....if this is a massive fraud, why is everyone from the
company still holding all their shares?


Disclosure: I'm long EXAS


25 Jul 2013, 05:57 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1) People don't take care of themselves and get the tests performed that they should.
Making a test that is substantially more difficult to administer and gross (aka cologuard) will not help this


2) Incorrect. Management speaks for the company and not the Mayo Clinic. If you bought every biotech with
crappy drugs / tests but credible non-profit partners, you would lose money at an astonishing rate. Mayo's
credibility is no way tied to EXAS.


3) The ideal time for management to sell would be post approval and before commercialization. Management
not selling is no reason to be bullish - look at CLSN - mgmt bought right before their P3 failed

Don't forget the part in the Australian study that you reference, in which 160 SYMPTOMATIC patients were

come you keep ignoring this most significant fact?


26 Jul 2013, 10:40 AM


drberger
As a health care administrator, previously as the administrator of a large academic practice at a major NYC institution,
I find the cost discussion somewhat off base.  
Our health care system has traditionally not made the cost of diagnostic or therapeutic methodology a criteria in
deciding when a methodology would be available to the patient. There are alternatives which are decided by the
patient and the physician. For example, many patients have an angioplasty or open heart surgery when there are
instances where a lower cost medication regimen is equal or better .  
I also find the word "cost", as used by Exact many writers, appearing to be a absolute when in reality it is subjective or
variable.  
Before I go into the economics, it is first best to layout the current state of the Colon Cancer screening test and note
the American Gastrointestinal Association medical policy as an example. 
Tests that detect adenomatous polyps and cancer: 
• Flexible Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years (doesn't examine the entire colon), 
• Colonoscopy every 10 years, 
• Air-contrast barium enema every 5 years, or CTC every 5 years (lower sensitivity for significant adenomas when
compared with colonoscopy) 
While much of the discussion is between the economic comparison between Cologuard and the FIT or InSure FIT
tests, there hasn't been a discussion of the cost comparison between Cologuard/FIT/InSureFIT and a screening
colonscopy, the most precise diagnostic methodology, which I intend to layout below.  
The typical physician charge (cost?) of a screening colonoscopy in the Greater NY area is typically $1,500, While the
proposed cost of Cologuard is said to be $400, these costs are very deceiving as the physician's Medicare
reimbursement for a screening colonoscopy in Manhattan, where Medicare reimbursement is the highest in the
country is $466 ( when the procedure is performed in the physician's office) and about $246 when the procedure is
performed in a facility (the facility's Medicare reimbursement is typically upwards of 160% higher). While the physician
charge is significantly higher that Cologuard, the actual expense, when performing a colonoscopy every 10 years, is
much lower than the "cost" of Cologuard.  
This does not address the economic costs of patients not having a colonoscopy because of the uncomfortable prep
work required prior to the colonoscopy, resulting in colon cancer. As colon cancer is one of the most preventable
diseases, if detected and treated, a diagnostic methodology, which would increase the patients being accurately
screened would overall reduce overall health care costs as the costs to treat colon cancer are very significant. The
screening tests are in 
Even if patients still should have a colonoscopy every 10 years, the increase in the number of patients screened, with
annual accurate laboratory tests, will decrease overall health care costs as fewer people would be treated for colon
cancer.

Author’s reply »  There will be a discussion of some of these points in part 4. In the meantime, please
consider that Cologuard has a very high cumulative number of false positives within a 10-year period (the
duration in which a colonoscopy is good) and that these false positives add a substantial cost to the $400/test
($1,200 total for 3 tests in 9-years) making Cologuard quite a bit more expensive than a colonoscopy.

worth by selling so many Poop-Scoop Tests from a Central Lab that the UPS Slogan "what can Brown do for you?"
Will get a whole new meaning.... Won't happen and to pray for a decent Trade Sale is naive at this Valuation.


EXAS Management are Full of their test's Sample Material...

5/18/2018 Exact Sciences - Flushing $$$ Down The Drain (2 Of 5) - EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) | Seeking Alpha

It is about the Precancer
It is all about detecting advanced precancerous lesions. Exact's test detects double the advanced precancerous
lesions in one test than FIT does in 3 years of sequential annual testing (assuming 100% FIT compliance, which as
pointed out is unreasonable).


The numbers: 
stool DNA finds 170 of 757 in one test (53% with three tests )


FIT, first year finds 29, second 28, and third year 27, totaling 84  
For a nine year period, FIT will only find 224 or 29% of these


This is again assuming 100% compliance of FIT, and not reasonable, but the numbers show some perspective.
Among users of Exact's test, it is very reasonable to get a 5 year survival rate upon detection of cancer/precancer
above 90%. Does wiping out colon cancer deaths to this extreme worth the not even doubling of price? Of course.
Letting cancer develop becomes very costly and hurts survival rates.


An easy decision for me.

CMS spends $14 Billion annually on treating colon cancer patients. 
Clearly, our current screening tests have failed us. 
Enough said.

Alpha Exposure sure knows an awful lot about "flushing money down the drain". 
EXAS up to $21.45 today.
