Pingify (PGFY) – Press
Release Flow Overkill?
May 8, 2014 By GeoTeam


PGFY’s goal is to provide a simple notification tool that puts
you in control of what you receive.  In our 5/6/2013 email
we mentioned an aggressive pump campaign had begun
for PGFY and that we established a short position.
 Yesterday, PGFY’s CFO and Director Vlad Milutin, submitted
his resignation to company President Jason Gray today, in
objection to a promotion campaign to artificially raise the
price and trading volume of Pingify.


Yesterday afternoon the company issued three press
releases in response to the morning release of the
resignation of its CFO. We were unimpressed with the
CEO’s commentary in the three rebuttal press releases.
 The release regarding its Letter of Intent to acquire 80
Elements Entertainment is just recycling a letter of intent
verbiage that has been on and off the table since August
2013.


Additionally, with only $2,209 on balance sheet, the CEO
does not disclose how the company would finance this
acquisition and does not disclose the revenue of 80
Elements Entertainment.  Quote from Boris Chow,
President of 80 Elements.


“We are definitely on track to hit our revenue
target by the end of 2014.”
