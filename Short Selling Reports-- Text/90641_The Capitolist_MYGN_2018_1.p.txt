Summary
Myriad Genetics (MYGN) acquired Assurex Health for their proprietary test
“GeneSight” that is intended to aid caregivers in their decision making in
prescribing anti-depressants.


The GeneSight trial was a FAILURE – missing its primary endpoint and only
reaching stat sig in two of the 25 secondary endpoints.


Most importantly – the pharmacoecconomic study the company used to justify the
$3,000 price tag specifically highlights that these results do not justify the
reimbursement levels being pitched to the.


The company is under investigation for over billing the federal government for
BRCA testing, it’s likely that the behavior extended to commercial plans as well.


Genesight Fails Primary Endpoint


I think we should start by addressing the magnitude of the failure of this trial, the
abject lack of data that the company produced to investors and the impact on
pricing such a failure has (pharmaco-ecconomics).

“This was the largest ever pharmacogenomics depression trial and primarily assessed
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 (HAMD-17) scores from baseline to eight weeks
in patients receiving GeneSight-guided therapy compared to those receiving treatment-
as-usual. The study was designed to evaluate three key endpoints relative to HAMD-17
scores: remission (HAMD-17 score ≤7), response (HAMD-17 reduction >50%), and
symptom reduction.” – MYGN Press Release Nov. 2, 2017


This was the largest ever trial in pharmacogenomics to aid the treatment of
depression and it was an outright failure on the primary endpoint.


“patients who received the GeneSight test had a greater reduction in HAMD-17 scores
after eight weeks, compared to the treatment-as-usual group, with the difference
approaching statistical significance (p=0.1)”


To make things worse the company only provided investors with 3 endpoints of
data:


The primary outcome failure1.


The two statsig secondary endpoints (at 8 weeks only)2.


“Patients receiving the GeneSight test achieved a clinically meaningful and statistically
significant improvement in both remission rates (p<0.01) and response rates (p=0.01) at
eight weeks compared to the treatment-as-usual group.”


The problem with the data set provided is that it is incredibly cherry picked.
Besides the fact that MYGN only released 3 of 26 endpoints they have yet to
release the additional assessments described below.  


“The study is a 24 week, double-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled trial that
evaluated 1,200 patients with moderate or severe MDD to assess the impact of the
GeneSight test on psychiatric treatment response. Patients were randomized in a 1:1
ratio to the study group (those receiving the GeneSight test) or the treatment-as-usual
group. Assessments were completed at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks, with
patients and raters completely blinded at the 4 and 8 week time points. Unblinding
occurred during week 12 of the study, when treatment-as-usual patients were allowed to
switch to GeneSight-guided therapy for the remaining 12 weeks of the study.”

So MYGN has a total of 104 measurements and released 3 to investors... perhaps
its not fair to hold them accountable for assessments that were not considered
"endpoints" so lets just take a min an look at what MYGN did hold back from
investors in terms of actual endpoints.

Several of these are particularly concerning but none more so than the 12 week
assessments of of HAM-D17 remitters and responders. Obviously managed care
organizations are going to be interested in the durability of effect if MYGN is
going to try to to charge $3,000 per test. One has to believe that the company is
notably humble not to release positive data within this data set when they had the
chance. That would be a real change in behavior considering this is a company
that produced a press release declaring that "Supreme Court Upholds Myriad's
cDNA Patent Claims" after their patents were clearly invalidated. Also - it makes
no sense to hold back positive data.

Based on the data in hand it is difficult to see a path to commercial
adoption.


As a reminder this trial (LINK) concluded on July 31st and MYGN waited until Nov
2nd to report the data. Clearly that was plenty of time to calculate the remainder
of the endpoints and the fact that they failed to explain that the trial was expanded
from 1,200 patients to 1,300 patients adds further concern. 


Lets start with the endpoints that MYGN touted as a "success": Response and
Remission rates.


NICE weighed in on this some time ago in a slightly separate setting:


Although the NICE meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors found significant differences in levels of symptoms, these were so
small that the effects were deemed unlikely to be clinically important.  The conclusion
that the drugs had clinically important benefits was based on analysis of response and
remission rates. However, in our comments on the draft guidelines, we pointed out that
these categorical outcomes were derived from the same continuous data for symptoms
scores that were found to show no clinically relevant effects. As NICE notes,
“dichotomising scores into remission and non-remission creates an artificial boundary,
with patients just over the cut-off score often being clinically indistinguishable from those
just under the cut-off.”

That does not read well... But what about Pharmacoecconomic data?


Dr. John Hornburger and Dr. Bruce Quinn produced a Pharmacoecconomic study
of the data from combinatorial pharmacogenomic (CPGx) testing with data
provided by Assurex (the inventor of the Genesight test) and found that it was
cost effective in the sense that it could save the system $3,711 in direct medical
costs. HOWEVER their was an important assumption made:


Results: CPGx improved the treatment response rate by 70% (1.7 times as high as
that with TAU), increasing QALYs by 0.316 years. With these health benefits, CPGx is
expected to save $3711 in direct medical costs per patient and $2553 in work
productivity costs per patient over the lifetime. The cost-effectiveness of CPGx testing
was robust over a wide range of variation in the input parameters, including the scenario
when testing efficacy was set to its lower limit.

Is this even a good idea?


Pump and...


The Company Proposes That Hereditary (BRCA) Testing is Stable - But
Under Federal Investigation 


In this case the "Treatment Response Rate" was defined by the reduction in
HAMD-17 scores... which is the same endpoint that they FAILED in the largest
study ever conducted. So its entirely unlikely that MYGN showed a 70% increase
in response and failed to hit StatSig.


Well Dr. Eric Lander has his doubts. In a paper titled "Cutting the Gordian Helix -
Regulating Genomic Testing in the Era of Precision Medicine" he states:


"Troublingly, some firms are already peddling genotype-based pronouncements about
whether a child is at significantly increased risk for suicide or autism, or about which
treatments will most benefit a particular person with mental illness. Such claims are not
harmless and may be quite dangerous. The firms often don't even disclose which
genetic variants inform their predictions, let alone reveal the underlying evidence base."


Curiously just weeks before MYGN released the devastating data above the
company issued a press release on Oct 19 , 2017 titled, "GeneSight® Shown to
Statistically Significantly Improve Generalized Anxiety Disorder Treatment
Response and Decrease Benzodiazepine Use". That may have made some
investors feel more sanguine about the impending results of the trial that had
been closed in July. However an important disclosure not offered in the press
release above was that the group of physicians who performed the trial have an
equity share in the Canadian subsidiary of Assurex and may receive royalties on
the product.


th


AssureRx Canada (ARxC) has been established as a subsidiary of the U.S. company,
with its Canadian office and laboratory on CAMH premises. Assurex Health will provide
backing for ARxC operations. CAMH holds a minority equity share in AssureRx Canada
and will receive royalties on the sale of genetic tests that incorporate CAMH-discovered
genetic markers.

The Company recently received a Subpoena from the Department of Health and Human
Services, Office of Inspector General, in connection with an investigation into possible
false or otherwise improper claims submitted for payment under Medicare and Medicaid.
The Subpoena requested that the Company produce documents relating primarily to the
Company’s billing to government-funded healthcare programs for the Company’s
hereditary cancer testing. The time period covered by the Subpoena is January 1, 2014
through the date of issuance of the Subpoena. The Company is cooperating with the
government’s request and is in the process of responding to the Subpoena. The
Company is unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or any other
governmental authority as a result of the matters related to this Subpoena. No claims
have been made against the Company at this time.


Dr. Bruce Quinn (former Molecular Diagnostics Coding expert at CMS) has
blogged about this extensively over the past 18 months.  


As you can see in the chart below there are multiple ways to code (and code
stack) for a BRCA based panel/test. MYGN has historically stacked the 81213
code with 81211 yielding a $2,780.00 price per test from Medicare. However,
MolDx created a new code (81432) that is supposed to capture all NGS based
cancer panels that include BRCA and 10 or more other genes (which of course
captures MyRisk, the new BRCA panel). If properly coded this would result in a
66% drop in reimbursement for at least the 7%-10% of rev that comes from the
federal government.

While it is possible that the over billing is limited to CMS - it is equally likely that

Admittedly our line of sight is not as clear here - but it warrants a vigilant eye on
the hereditary platform and any sales decline should be questioned.
