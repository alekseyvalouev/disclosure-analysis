Lee Enterprises: When A Company Burns The Furniture, Investors
Should Short The Stock
Nov. 12, 2013 8:58 AM ET39 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


The phrase "burning the furniture to heat the house," is meant to express the desperate
measures that some people will take in order to stay warm and therefore alive. It also
symbolizes actions that are ultimately futile - after all, once the furniture is burnt you have
nothing left to burn to keep yourself warm. It's a stopgap measure that is ultimately both
destructive and fails to obviate the final outcome - being left in the cold. We believe that
Lee Enterprises (NYSE:LEE) has been burning its furniture to stay alive by aggressively
cutting costs in order to service its crushing debt load. While these actions have so far
allowed the company to keep its EBITDA relatively stable, the current level of profitability
looks unsustainable and additional cost savings are probably impossible. As we will
explain in this article, the operations of LEE have been gutted and the result is an
enterprise on the precipice of decline. Below we review the two major actions LEE has
taken to maintain its profitability.


Action #1: Aggressively Fire People


Result #1: Product quality declines


Prognosis: Not repeatable and dangerous to the business


Since the beginning of 2010, Lee Enterprises has reduced its headcount from 6,304
people to 4,678, a decline of 26%. If you're wondering how this is possible, it's not from
getting people to work smarter or harder. Firing 26% of the workforce was made possible
by the company's decision to shrink its newspapers. Over the same time period, the
volume of newsprint consumed by the company has declined by 30%. In case you think
that the decline is simply due to fewer subscribers, the newsprint produced per subscriber
has also declined by 14% over this period, which means not only that Lee has fewer
subscribers, but also that each of Lee's subscribers is reading a smaller newspaper. They
are selling into a shrinking consumer base that also consumes fewer newspapers. The
end result of firing so much of its staff is that LEE now produces a substantially less robust
product than it previously did. Here's how the headcount of LEE and the volume of
newsprint consumed looks over the past two years:

Action #2: Increase Prices


Result #2: Subscribers Leave


Prognosis: Not repeatable and dangerous to the business


To combat the decline in the number of subscribers (which has declined 19% since the
start of 2010) and the continued loss of advertising market share by newspapers, Lee
Enterprises has raised its prices for subscribers. Over this period, the average
subscription revenue per subscriber has increased from $29.11 to $34.87, an increase of

20% (or an increase of nearly 40% is you normalize for the size of the newspaper). In
essence, LEE has decided to charge more for a product that is continually declining in
value, as can be seen in the aforementioned decline in both the number of employees at
LEE as well as the company's newsprint per subscriber. Below is a graphical
representation of the average subscription revenue per subscriber, the number of
subscribers at LEE, and the average newsprint volume per subscriber over the past two
years:

An Overvalued Stock


As if the deteriorating fundamentals weren't enough, Lee Enterprises is also significantly
overvalued based on recent transactions in the newspaper industry. We rely on
transactions because there aren't many good comparable companies that trade because
they often have significant other assets such as Internet properties [McClatchy -
(NYSEMKT:MNI)], real estate [NY Times - (NYSE:NYT)] or broadcasting assets [Gannett -
(NYSE:GCI)]. On the other hand, we can look at several recent transaction comps to see
what newspapers may be worth. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)
(NYSE:BRK.B) bought the newspaper division from Media General (NYSE:MEG) for $142
million in May, 2012. In the prior year, the newspaper group had generated about $28
million in EBITDA so they were sold at a multiple of 5.1x. Likewise, Newcastle recently
purchased the Dow Jones Local Media Group for 3.4x EBITDA and also restructured
GateHouse at an implied valuation of 6.0x 2013E EBITDA. In contrast, Lee Enterprises is
trading at 6.2x EBITDA. At the average transaction multiple of 4.8x, LEE's equity would
actually be worthless due to the extreme financial leverage at the company. Even at the
high-end multiple of 6.0x, LEE's equity would only be worth $2.85 or 18% below its last
price of $3.49.


Furthermore, Lee's extreme leverage and dwindling business makes it a good candidate
for a future bankruptcy or restructuring. There have been numerous bankruptcies in the
space over the last 5 years, as can be seen here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1831452-lee-enterprises-when-a-company-burns-the-furniture-investors-should-short-the-stock 5/14


Due to declining industry fundamentals and the rash of bankruptcies in the space,
transaction multiples have collapsed. Newcastle Investment Corp (NCT) says in their
latest presentation that local newspaper businesses can be purchased at 2x-5x EBITDA,
down from historical averages of 10x EBITDA (here). This supports our view of Lee's
equity as being worthless.


Conclusion


Lee Enterprises has embarked on an unsustainable business model of destroying its
product while raising prices in an effort to sustain its financial performance. In many ways,
the company was forced down this road by its enormous leverage, which already caused
the company to file for bankruptcy once before, in early 2012. While this strategy has been
successful at stabilizing the business over the past few years, it is unlikely to be
successful going forward. LEE's short-minded strategy of gutting its workforce (and
therefore its product) while simultaneously increasing prices is doomed to fail. We believe
the stock is worth at most $2.85 per share and is likely ultimately worthless based on

In extreme form, this motto is "tear down the house for firewood." Yes, you end up burning the house itself (or part of
it) to stay warm.

Whew!!! I had been impressed by the stock's current P/E of 17; the positive signals from the short, medium, and long-
term indicators especially the 20, 50, and 100 day moving averages vs. price, and the fact that Berkshire Hathaway is
holding 88,000 shares, and that it looked as though it would be on the same path that MEG had been.


I shall reconsider my plans to purchase more.

Talk about hitting the nail on the head! Finally someone who seems to grasp the huge flaws in Lee's strategy. 
As a former Lee employee who was laid off from a senior position so a local unit could make its numbers, I have seen
first hand the damage done by this burn-the-furniture (or house) approach. It has yielded vastly diminished products
and a thoroughly demoralized workforce.


I only wish you had pointed out that the company executives, led by Mary Junck and with the complicity of the board,
have through all of this continued to enrich themselves, taking large raises while making the rank and file take it in the
shorts. Truly shameful.


Your conclusion couldn't be more accurate, and thankfully fully at odds with the rosy scenario painted earlier by
another columnist on this site, who seemed to have no real understanding of the newspaper business. 
Well done!


12 Nov 2013, 01:24 PM


Lee Watcher
Some of these comments appear to come from understandably disgruntled former Lee employees. It's hard to
analyze a business situation objectively when so emotionally involved. I have 40 years in the newspaper
business and believe Lee is headed to the surface, not the depths. Innocent employees (see above) paid with
their jobs and their disrupted lives for the board's hubris in buying Pulitzer. No argument on that, but as much
as those justifiably bitter people want Mary Junck and Lee to go down, they keep chipping away at the debt
and remain cash positive. Look at the trend, not the emotion.


12 Nov 2013, 09:13 PM


SB Coyote
Disgruntled, emotionally involved, bitter. Such great words to use when someone wants to dismiss an
argument at odds with one's own view. I also have nearly 40 years in the newspaper business, including
working for NYT Co., McClatchy, Pulitzer and others in addition to Lee.


Let me be clear. I do not want Lee to go down. That would be bad for the company's employees and the
communities it attempts to serve.


A key point of this article is that Lee, in slashing its workforce among other tactics, is seriously diminishing the
quality of its products. As a newspaper veteran, are you seriously arguing that point?

It has been doing that for most of the last five years. I fail to see how that is a long-term strategy for success
in any business.


I would appreciate you outlining how this strategy is going to get Lee to the surface, or more significantly to
long-term success.


While I'm an investor, I'm not here to give anyone investment advice. I'm sure you're all smarter than I am in
that regard, and can decide whether to be short Lee, long Lee or no Lee at all without my help.


But I do know a lot about how newspapers are run and managed, and saw first hand the mistakes that Lee
management was making well before I become a "disgruntled" ex-employee.


You did note one of the key problems with Lee management: "hubris."


Bottom line is you apparently put faith in the same Lee board and management that got the company into this
pickle, and rewarded itself handsomely for surviving it. I'm just not sure why anyone would want to double
down on that bet.

You conveniently omitted that the writer said "understandably" disgruntled and "justifiably" bitter. You kind of
underscored the point about emotional detachment. Yes, the board and Junck are paying for one extremely
bad decision. There's no justification for the stock grants and bonuses. But what would you have done -- kept
all the employees and sunk the ship? Sounds like the Newspaper Guild talking.


13 Nov 2013, 09:18 PM


Lee Watcher
I don't disagree that Lee, like many newspaper groups, has found itself facing options that all, more or less,
stink. Neither do I doubt that the newspapers are not as good as they were before the axes came out.  
We in the profession can whine about that, or we can adjust to the new reality. The facts are that Lee is still
operating profitably, that it has managed a crushing debt load in a terrible economy without going under, and
yes, that it took a terrible human toll as well as a quality toll. 
As you know, classified is gone, inserts are threatened, national is in the dumper and it ain't 1997 anymore.
Lee and others are trying to operate in that realm. Local news is still the ace franchise they control. If they do
it right, they'll survive, not with 30 percent margins anymore, but they'll be there. I still like newspapers,
millions of Americans still do and Lee appears to be headed the right way to capitalize on that. It's quite
understandable if the after-image of the bloody journey is too unsettling for you to consider the investment
opportunity.

years. At the rate they are going, it will be 16-18 years, if ever. ( still owe $900 million ). Further , they had to
go into bankruptcy to force some of the creditors to refinance the junk loans ( I have credit cards with lower
rates).


Warren Buffett backed into an investment in Lee stock. By purchasing some of the junk notes at a discount (
Investors wanted to get rid of the crap ) he received warrants for Lee stock  
Lee had to offer the warrants to get the creditors to refinance.


Mary Junk succeeded in making Joseph Pulitizer III's widow,  
Emily Pulitizer , an art patron and supporter of sculptor Richard Serra. with little interest in the newspaper
business, look like a great business woman by grossly over paying , buying at the  
peak. Afterwards Lee stock went from $44 a share to a one point 44 cents a share. ( If ever in St Louis , be
sure to see Serra's sculpture " Joe " at the Pulitizer Museum )

They were going to repay in 6 years. Never heard that one. Even if that's so, they bought in 2005. Hmmm,
what happened over the next six years after that? 
For nearly all American companies, that was hardly a time to stick to plans made in 2005.


18 Dec 2013, 06:15 PM


Lee Watcher
This company got itself into an almost bottomless pit when it bought Pulitzer in 2005. Despite that, it has pulled itself
about halfway up the debt ladder. It hasn't been pretty, but with Buffett holding a significant amount of the debt, I think
this analysis is way pessimistic. The company is still cash positive and paying down debt. The threat of bankruptcy is
greatly reduced. Unless Buffet bails, I'd say it's virtually non-existent. Except for St. Louis, Lee still holds mostly
community newspapers, not metros. These still make money. It has been ugly, with the layoffs, but they've done what
they had to do to survive. As they said at the Meatpackers' Parade, the wurst has passed.

"In contrast, Lee Enterprises is trading at 6.2x EBITDA."


This is incorrect. Here's why:


1. In the 12 months ended 9/30/13, Lee had EBITDA (as defined in its credit agreement) of $173.7 million.


2. At $3.30 a share, the market cap is $171.3 million.


So Lee is trading at about 1.0x EBITDA.


Again, with all due respect, I think someone would have to be nuts to be short Lee.

When you make your own EBITDA multiple, then call it something else.


13 Nov 2013, 12:06 PM


leeinvestor
Lee's enterprise value is about a billion dollars at today's stock price and debt. Assuming that's an accurate
valuation of the company (i.e., $1 billion buys you $170 million in pretax cash flows excluding capex), then the
market cap will be directly tied, more or less, with net debt pay down.


In the past year, Lee has reduced net debt by about $82 million or $1.59 a share. It's no coincidence then that
the stock price has risen by roughly that amount.


A year from now, Lee will have paid down another $80-$100 million. By the end of 2015, it will have reduced
net debt by about $150 million to $200 million or about $2.90 to $3.85 a share.


Assuming EV remains at a billion dollars, that means a stock price of $6 to $8.


At that point (end of 2015), Lee will need to refi its 1st lien debt assuming it hasn't done so before then.


Now, maybe your assumption is that equity holders get 100% wiped out in bankruptcy court? Keep in mind
that the odds are not good for that happening. Courts these days in chapter 11 cases where the only issue is
refinancing rather than solvency tend to just issue equity to the debtholders, which is what happened at the
beginning of 2012 when Lee's net debt to EBITDA was about 6.


At the end of 2015, Lee's net debt to EBITDA will be about 4. So I think you're very, very brave to be short a
company like Lee. I'm on the long side (and in full disclosure have Lee as my largest holding), so we will see
who is right two years from now.

You gave a pre-tax cash flow figure of $170 million. 
LEE reported LTM Adjusted EBITDA of $171.2 million for the twelve months ended 12/29/2014 (Source: LEE
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Reconciliation in Quarterly Earnings release).  
Nearly identical, with one small modification. What you call pre-tax cash flow is, in actuality, pre-tax unlevered
cash flow.  
That said, you were right on target. Well done, sir.

Kevin from MN
How did you compute Lee trading at 6.2 x ebita? I come up with 1.0 based on the results released yesterday.


12 Nov 2013, 02:13 PM


Gordon Fox
You have to use Enterprise Value (Total Debt +Total Equity) in relation to EBITDA as EV/EBITDA does not
take into consideration the capital structure of the firm.


You are likely using Equity Market Cap in your calculation, which is skewing your figure much lower given
LEE's high debt level.


If you use Equity Market Cap, your denominator should be Net Income. Or the more commonly and simply-
known P/E ratio. Unlike EV/EBITDA, P/E ratios inherently reflect the capital structure of the firm.

This was written as an 'algo trigger' to create liquidity so this person or (group of people) could exit their short trade
profitably because seeking alpha gets picked up by bigger news aggrigators. Algos are coded to trade the news
based on adjectives and action verbs (and that is all). Humans don't trade like they used to... its all computer trading
from twitter posts and google news. So human short traders just got their head handed to them today and will
continue to get punished tomorrow. On any given day Lee never trades in the 1.2 million share range. So it was a
shake out (nothing more).

Again...this article plus a handful of these suspicious first time posters made me chuckle.


Here are some facts on Lee:


Lee survived a technical bankruptcy perpetuated by Vulture Debt holders of the worst kind AND WON! Common stock
shareholders SURVIVED. This is non-existent in U.S. capitalism but Lee is not a normal company.


Piotroski TTM 7 
DCF $8.47 per share. 
1 X EBITDA  
FCF @ $90 million+ 
Graham value using .49 cents EPS puts Lee at $4.51 plus per share. 
Enterprise value is $21.00 plus (melt value) per share 
Fair value is at $17.00 a share


On the technical side we just broke through an almost perfect 4 month right angle ascending triangle. And any slog
with a chart can see what that means.


Target is for investors: $10-12 per share.


By the way, I worked for their competitor in South Dakota so I know the newspaper industry in the fly-over-states
better than most...and from an investment stand point there are not many people that pay close attention to Lee like I
do so don't let stupid articles like this get you worried.

and the positive signals from the 20, 50, and 100 day moving averages vs. price, plus the 20-day Bollinger bands, are
saying "JUMP IN." Something is up, I think.

Momentum counts for a lot, as ajblo1 points out, and it appears it will continue here for awhile. I thought the bulls
might start taking a breather but the 20-day Bollinger bands are still indicating short term interest; in fact , all short-to-
long-term indicators are positive on Yahoo -- and we still have the Alibaba IPO ahead of us. Of course, by the time we
get to it, traders and investors may have already well-discounted it.

Gents, pardon my faux pas: comment above were meant to be a reply to a Yahoo article. I'll get back on the planet
sooner or later.

5/18/2018 Lee Enterprises: When A Company Burns The Furniture, Investors Should Short The Stock - Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (NYSE:LEE) …

Shorting leveraged companies that are priced as such is a crazy thing to do. Even if the chances of failure are high,
success is always an option. Especially in an area that history's greatest investor has deemed worthy of his
investment. You stand to make 100% at the very most, and you could potentially lose many times that if LEE proves
able to handle the debt.


I think the market clearly sees the insolvency risk here

@Author, so you think we should short a stock that warren buffet is long on, a company that is 2 years ahead on debt
repayment, and will probably refinance at a better rate, possibly pay a 1 time dividend?

Buffett never bought LEE stock, it was granted to him in connection with his purchase of $85 million of LEE
debt which he purchased from Goldman Sachs at 65 cents on the dollar.


Berkshire's disclosure of its equity stake occurred in a an amended 13F where it reported 1.7 million shares,
then a subsequent 13F (which the SEC allowed) which reported Berkshire's entire 3.3 million shares.


However, since that time, Berkshire has SOLD nearly all of its position except for 88,000 shares, as reported
in its latest 13F.


You are certainly correct about the refinancing (which has occurred) and the asymmetrical danger of shorting
such a low-priced stock that is still generating meaningful cash flows.


Buffett's bullishness on the stock, though, is not really valid any longer as Berkshire holds almost none of its
previously-granted equity position.

So Berkshire's purchase (and continued holding) of Lee debt is not an endorsement that it believes the company will
remain solvent? Uh, that assessment is "not valid."
