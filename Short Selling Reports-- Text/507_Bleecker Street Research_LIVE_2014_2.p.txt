LiveDeal: Are Restaurants Actually Using It? And Other New
Information
Jan. 30, 2014 9:25 AM ET98 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


(Editors' Note: This article covers a stock trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less
than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these
stocks.)


I wrote my first article on LiveDeal, Inc (NASDAQ:LIVE) on January 28th in the afternoon.
My thesis remains the same but have since discovered a few other interesting things that
should add credence to my original short thesis. These include a discussion about the
stock split, as well as some conversations I had with restaurant managers that are listed
on LiveDeal.


Are Shorts Getting Nervous Before The Stock Split?


I found this press release interesting. Titled "LiveDeal, Inc.'s Announced Forward Stock
Split Leaves Short Positions Nervous." I was shocked when I read it.


LiveDeal (NASDAQ: LIVE) recently announced it will be initiating a 3-for-1
forward stock split in early February, but ahead of the split, investors with
short positions will be looking to cover before their position also splits into
one 3 times larger than currently held. Late in Tuesday's session, we may have
seen the first shot at trying to create doubt in the minds of long investors at LiveDeal.
Shares of the company's stock began to pull back after an article written by
someone disclosing he does, in fact, have a short position in the stock, appeared on
the financial website Seeking Alpha.


3-1 Stock Split


The language in this press release is incredibly unprofessional. Suggesting that investors
will do something is wrong. They have no idea whether or nor investors will take an action
regarding their short positions into the stock split. Secondly, they suggested that the short
position would be three times larger post split. WRONG. It was also clearly phrased
ambiguously. It seems that the writer was trying to scare shorts into thinking that their
positions would get three times larger. This is not true. Here is how a 3-1 stock split works
in general.

Source: personal analysis


Here is what it would look like if the LIVE 3-1 stock split happened tomorrow.


Source: Personal analysis and company filings.


Let's say you shorted 100 shares yesterday at $18/ share. Your short position would be
$1,800. If the 3-1 split went into effect the next day you would be short 300 shares with a
new cost basis of $6/ share. Your short position would still be $1,800. Same sized
position. Of course the writer of the press release should know this, and likely does. The
writer is trying to either get shorts to capitulate, or more likely, to give longs hope that the
stock will pop in the short term. The press release goes onto say;


LiveDeal was due a pull back, and there are likely many investors on the sidelines
who are cheering for a much lower split price than the $20-25 range it was trading at
prior to Tuesday. Any pull back before the split means the stock will have a
more attractive entry price after the split, thus ensuring more investors can
afford the lower price.


"Price is what you pay, value is what you get."- Warren Buffett


Investors should remember this quote from Warren Buffett when they hear statements like
that. The price is changing but you are getting the exact same amount of value for it.


I am short this stock and I for one am looking forward to the stock split. It should increase
liquidity and perhaps increase the amount of shares available to short. Right now, while
there are some shares available to short, they come and go and the borrow cost is fairly

expensive.


Will A Short Squeeze Be Coming?


In another article "Wealthmakers.com" published a report on LiveDeal suggesting that a
short squeeze would drive the price to $48/ share.


The report highlights the short term bullish pattern that has emerged, the
SqueezeTrigger Price and the projected short squeeze price target of $47.14 per
share.


The short interest in LiveDeal is relatively high at 10% of the float shorted. You could make
the argument that there are naked shorts in this name and that could trigger a short
squeeze, but I'm sticking to the data that NASDAQ makes publicly available.


What's the deal, LiveDeal?


In an effort to learn whether or not the service was being used I decided to call several of
the restaurants that had deals on the LiveDeal website. The first few I called seemed
puzzled about LiveDeal. So I decided to call the restaurants that were on the first five
under each county. Here were my results along with the exact quote from the people I was
speaking to. The results are grouped by county. The question I asked was "Do you use
LiveDeal.com?"


San Diego County


1. Cuscatan Salvadoran Cusine-


"I don't think so"


2. Godfather's Pizza-


"Oh yeah we use that one."


3. Que Pasa Mexican Grill-


"Let me check with my manager, yes we use it."


4. Round Table Pizza-


"We have coupons and deals on our website, but only there."


5. Giovanni's Restaurant-

"Never heard of it, we use 411 and Grubhub"


Los Angeles County


1. Coconut Bay Bar & Grill-


"No, I don't think we use it."


2. Fuji West-


"No."


3. Toro Sushi Bar Lounge-


Toro Sushi Bar & Lounge is closed on Tuesday, therefore I don't think the deal on LiveDeal
was getting much use.


4. Whatever Tea Lounge-


"We only use LivingSocial and the Amazon Deal program."


5. El Puerto Escondido-


"LiveDeal? I don't know that name."


San Francisco County


1. Paragon Restaurant and Bar-


"I don't know, (checks) yes we recently partnered with them."


2. Bissap and Little Baobab-


I could not reach them because the voice mail was full, nobody answered the phone.


3. Casava Bakery and Cafe-


"I don't think so, let me check. No we do not."


4. Chaat Cafe-


"We use 24 and delivery.com"


5. Ghiradelli Chocolate Company-


"That is our special but we don't use livedeal.com"

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1979881-livedeal-are-restaurants-actually-using-it-and-other-new-information 5/26


Of the thirteen restaurants I contacted only three confirmed that they used LiveDeal.
These are surprising results given the description of liveeal.com.


LiveDeal.com is a unique, real-time "deal engine" connecting merchants with
consumers. We believe that the Company has developed the first-of-its-kind
web/mobile platform providing restaurants with full control and flexibility to instantly
publish customized offers whenever they wish to attract customers. Highlights of the
new LiveDeal.com include:


- a user-friendly interface enabling restaurants to create limited-time offers and publish them


immediately, or on a preset schedule that is fully customizable;


- state-of-the-art scheduling technology giving restaurants the freedom to choose the days,


times and duration of the offers, enabling them to create offers that entice consumers to visit


their establishment during their slower periods;


- advanced publishing options allowing restaurants to manage traffic by limiting the number of


available vouchers to consumers;


- superior geo-location technology allowing multi-location restaurants to segment offers by


location, attracting customers to slower locations while eliminating potential over-crowding at


busier sites; and


- a user-friendly mobile and desktop web interface allowing consumers to easily browse,


download, and instantly redeem "live" offers found on LiveDeal.com based on their location.


Restaurants can sign up to use the LiveDeal platform at our website (livedeal.com).


Of the people that I spoke to it seemed that most hadn't heard of LiveDeal. Several
managers asked me what promotion LiveDeal was running for them, and acknowledged
that they were running the same promotions. So the restaurants are running the
promotions, they just don't know they are being run on LiveDeal. I have no idea how these
restaurants promotions are getting up on LiveDeal, but I doubt LiveDeal is generating
much revenue from them if the restaurants don't even know they are on LiveDeal.


Who Else Has Kabani & Co. Audited


In my last article I highlighted some issues I found regarding LiveDeal's auditor Kabani &
Co.



http://livedeal.com/
5/18/2018 LiveDeal: Are Restaurants Actually Using It? And Other New Information - Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1979881-livedeal-are-restaurants-actually-using-it-and-other-new-information 6/26


According to the most recent 10-K LiveDeal is audited by "Kabani and Company."
Unfortunately Kabani & Co. has been cited by the PCAOB for 10 deficiencies in audits
performed in 2011. Some of the deficiencies that stood out to me were


(3) the failure to perform sufficient procedures to evaluate transactions with related
parties
(7) the failure to perform sufficient procedures to test revenue
(10) the failure, in four audits, to perform sufficient procedures to test amounts
reported in statements of cash flows.


While these deficiencies were cited several years ago, it is still a red flag to potential
investors. I'm not suggesting that Kabani & Co. is incompetent as they did say that
LiveDeal was a "going concern," which should be yet another red flag.


Thanks to a tip from a reader "Unemon1" who told me that Kabani & Co. had audited L&L
Energy (NASDAQ:LLEN). In case you are unfamiliar with LLEN, GeoInvesting called this a
fraud in an in depth expose and the stock has been halted since mid-November. Kabani &
Co. was the auditor on this name as well. Even RedChip, a glorified PR firm had this to
say about Kabani & Co.


"There are two auditing firms that have been singled out as being less than diligent
in their auditing of Chinese companies: Kabani & Company, Inc. and Frazer Frost,
LLP."


Summary


The fact that so few of the restaurants listed on LiveDeal knew about it concerns me. I
also find the press releases regarding shorts covering to be unprofessional and indicative
of an effort to manipulate the stock price higher. My long term price target is $2.25/ share
as discussed in my previous article.


I have contacted the company asking about why only 3 of 13 restaurants had heard of it or
said they used it. I have also filed a whistle blower form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission regarding potential stock manipulation.


Disclosure: I am short LIVE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Chris: I appreciate your comment about the PR piece...you are exactly right...the article was flawed to say the
least and absolutely wrong and misleading at worst.


Having said that I have a couple of questions for you. For the record I have been trading LIVE daily and have
made some money on the swings.


My questions. Where are you getting shares to short? I have accounts with two MAJOR firms and neither
have had or do they now have shares available for shorting. 
Are you a naked short? Are you short against the box...I assume you know that term.


Help me understand your "short position"

I am not a naked short, I wouldn't even know how to do that. I am also not short against the box, although it
wouldn't be a bad idea to go long some shares in a separate account in case we do get a short squeeze.

to do. Again, good luck!

Excellent research. The promotion is running out of suckers to buy into it. It will eventually bust and collapse from
liquidity issues. 
I suggest notifying Seeking Alpha management and to see if you can get a retraction from yesterday's PR or a seize
and desist. The PR is damaging to the Seeking Alpha platform, author contributions and brand.

As an SA contributor (and being short LIVE), I liked the response from the company. It was so unprofessional
it was validating and should be a warning to longs.

Chris, I think that you are doing exactly the same thing that your writing against. You've lost credibility. Plain and
simple, I see that you are trying to make your case based on personal assumptions and interests. Everybody is
entitled to write or say whatever they want, however, it is sad to see that seeking alpha is not about the best interest
of investors but about the personal interest of its writers. Despite of the livedeal's fate(any company can fail or
succeed) you should allow investors to make their own decisions instead of keep pushing them to do what your
"personal interest" wants them to do.

It is very different for an analyst to do what Cris is doing and saying than a company to put wholly misleading
and biased comments in their press releases concerning stock prices.

wife's (large international) company sent out a list of dining places that would gladly offer us discounts of the same
type one gets from Groupon, etc. We are not really active for that kind of thing but have used three.


The typical response has been to have puzzled managers trying to figure out if the deal is true or a scam. How does
one know? The customer shows up, will get a $15 discount - which will blow the table's profit to zero in most
instances. My point is that Sharon Jones, the day manager for XXX restaurant, may have no clue who the corporate
office is cutting deals with. An owner-operator might but it would depend on who you have on the other end of the
phone.


Also worth noting is the quality of the company you are contacting. Round Table has been on the near edge of BK for
years. I'm sure, much to the annoyance of franchisees, they try whatever they can to build traffic.

Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  That's a good point and I did think about that. But the fact that the people who are facing the
customers didn't recognize the name tells me that it isn't being used. I spoke to one manager who said
something to the effect of "our marketing guy just signed us up for that." I heard the users mention many
competitors such as round table, and it's obviously a very competitive space. However, you do make a good
point.

In the other article I mentioned that we would see some kind of garbage response to try to bounce the stock. I advised
to short any bounce generated as it would be quickly sold.


The blatant stock promotion is rather odd as most try to conceal it as best as possible. It will be interesting if the SEC
and FINRA step in to shut down this behavior and put an end to this mess.


The promoters along with certain individuals on twitter who were also involved should be looked at.

Chris, you may or may not be right but you have obviously made it personal. Appears very unprofessional on your
part. I'm sure the pressure to succeed at a business is immense and LIVE may be pushing the limits of what is
acceptable but that doesn't mean the product isn't real or that the idea isn't brilliant (I think it is). Cautioning investors
is admirable and the stock probably is overpriced but I doubt it is a "scam" as some of your supporters have
suggested. Why not let it alone and let the market and the product sort itself out? Simple answer is because you have
a vested interest in it and need the company to fail so that you can profit from their failure. At best this is the next big
deal at worst right now it is just a central location for merchants to advertise and interact in real time with consumers
based on location.

Author’s reply »  I am not trying to make it personal but when a PR firm explicitly says that shorts will be
covering before a 3-1 split I feel like I need to respond. If they keep saying misleading things I will keep
responding. Hopefully any future reponses (if there are any) will not be viewed as personal in your view.

That's funny. No, but I did put a part of my retirement funds into the stock. I'm not going to lie, I would very
much like to see this product succeed. I am sufficiently skeptical at this point and I may not wait that long. 
Please explain to me how LIVE is going to profit from this if it is just a scam. Can they take all the investor
money (the stock) and flee? As I mentioned before, anything is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
This is no different. It seems to have wonderful potential and I think that is what people see, beyond that it is
supply and demand driving the price (and a lot of well placed hype). Again, I am a newbie, so please explain
how (and who) stands to profit from this "scam". 
Seriously, that was funny. Thank you.

Back to back bashing articles- looks like no selling this time.I would cover and move on this could easily be 12
bucks after the split.That would equal 36 a share - per your explanation. 
A so what a PR firm talks about shorts why not you wrote a bad article..and then shorts use the word Scam
over and over again it gets annoying.I remember the bashing of DDD before they did a 3 for 2 split and after
that it went 28 to 98.That guy needless to said said 3-d printing was a scam lol.

Regarding who profits from this "scam", look up a "pump and dump". On a side note, I actually started

are fooling?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1979881-livedeal-are-restaurants-actually-using-it-and-other-new-information 11/26


In a pump & dump, a CEO and others are -awarded- stock by the company as part of their "compensation".
They pay nothing for it, sell it into the hype (for which they pay to promoters with company funds), pocket the
money personally while the company burns through cash and eventually goes bankrupt.


I'm not saying that -is- what LIVE is doing but that's what I personally believe is happening. This isn't an IPO. I
can envision absolutely no reason for them to be devoting time and funds to promoting their stock with such
"promising technology". If they are being earnest in their purported intent to make this better than GRPN and
are able to deliver, the performance would take this stock into the billion+ market cap without spending a dime
on stock pumping.


Today a lady at TheStreet.com came out with a piece touting their 150%+ growth in traffic over this time last
year. That's ridiculous because they probably had a few hundred visitors this time last year! Where are the
NUMBERS? Forget percentages LOL! Seriously, Chris' blog about them probably generated enough curiosity
for them to double the traffic over last year!


I'm frankly surprised that thestreet.com employs someone who would write such a piece.


07 Feb 2014, 03:30 PM


Mukticat
TheStreet is always on the verge of going out of business so it's no surprise they probably rent out their site
for promotional articles. Obviously any pseudonym who puts LIVE and GRPN in a headline together with the
words "LIVE will eat their GRPN's lunch" is a tool for the promoters.


As for the website traffic increase that was undoubtedly generated by investors looking into this hype trying to
find somewhere, anywhere, some source of revenues.

btw- I call 'Christine Andrews' a pseudonym because a google search turns up nothing for this name. No one

Say if I short the stock jan 30, when would I have to cover by to a void the 3 to 1 split? 
Feb 3rd or by the Feb 12th. If I have 1500 at $16.50 shares and the split happens do I have to buy 4500 shares at a
lower or higher price to cove? I am new to day trading and still learning thanks.


30 Jan 2014, 01:18 PM


don'tbugmeplease
Let's say you are short 1500 shares today at $16.50.


When the split happens, you are short 4500 shares at $5.50. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE TOTAL
VALUE OF YOUR SHARES BECAUSE OF THE SPLIT.


Trader767 - I appreciate you asking a newbie question. However, shares are very difficult to borrow, unless
you have a specialty broker or are paying a borrowing fee, you're not getting them from any of the regular
brokers.


If the price is falling, you will cover at a lower price. If the price is rising, you will cover at a higher price. If the
price is not moving, you will cover at the same price. The price movement has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
SPLIT.

A split means nothing. It's like you having a $100 bill and me giving you two $50 bills for it. So before you had
one bill worth $100, now you have 2 bills worth $50. Either way you still have $100

Chris -is- engaging in a "form" of what he's writing against only in the sense that he has a vested financial
interest in his thesis being correct. What I think makes his activities different is that Chris likely happens to be
CORRECT and Chris - is not being disengenuous.


Chris' endeavor could prove to be an example of how the free markets ultimately help expose chicanery
without the intervention of elected idiots, their appointees & cronies. After all, what were the folks at the SEC
doing while private sector professionals were warning them about Madoff? They were downloading copious
quantities of porn on the job. They didn't discover squat.


I even wonder if they have deals with the 3 restaurants who did say they deal with Live Deal because when
you call a restaurant, especially if they are busy, people will say anything to get you off the phone unless you
are a customer. Those people may even have -perceived- that you were calling their restaurant as a sales rep

for Live Deal, in which case, they could have felt it would get rid of you if they said they were already dealing
with what they believed to be the employer you represent. Restaurants get as sales calls ad nauseum and
have ways of getting rid of solicitors efficiently.


As I commented on Chris' last column regarding the company (and I suspect was an impetus toward Chris
calling the restaurants http://bit.ly/1jgtrJD )  
"I interviewed this LiveDeal CEO Jon Isaac for about 45 minutes a few months ago when LIVE was about
$2.00 I was pretty skeptical before the interview but after the interview I was completely skeptical. I couldn’t
get a clear answer as to how many people they employ to sell ads. 
By the vague answers, I was left with the impression that: 
1. The website is full of “ads” or offers that the restaurants offer as a normal part of their daily specials, happy
hour etc. It left me wondering if they had agreements for compensation from ANY of the companies on there -
or – if they were trying to make a website that would cause investors to ASSUME that they had agreements
with most of these companies – without claiming such. 
2. It could be free advertising (probably worth the price of admission so to speak) for the business listed on
there. What local retailer is going to tell people, “no, you may not tell your readers about our regular
specials”? 
My impression is that the stock is the product and downside potential would be more like 98%-100%."  
----------------------... 
The reason I find this appalling is that if a company of this market cap, this early in the game had any desire
to make the actual service into a viable and successful endeavor, they would be using every cent of available
liquidity to pay more sales staff and advertise their website to retailers - NOT ADVERTISE THE STOCK.
Pump and Dump.  
If Chris makes money by selling short while bringing these questions to light, good for him. Longs would lose
money but if the thesis is correct - and to me it seems a no brainer - than one can say Chris is helping to
prevent longs from doubling-down and keeping more future "investors" from engaging.

Author’s reply »  Yep, your comment was exactly what lead me to do the calls. Thanks for your very kind
comment. Ultimately it is up to the market to decide which point of view is correct. It seems obvious to me
which side is correct but others may not. And yes, think of how much the company could have advertised its
product if it wasn't spending all that money promoting the stock.

Yes indeed. I don't see Groupon running ads pumping their stock. Like I wrote earlier, Live Deal & GRPN
being in the same conversation is absurd. It's one thing to have a road show for an IPO as companies often
do for a new issue - but to pump a stock in the secondary money lines the executives pockets. Come on
people! 
I am not long or short this company and have never had a financial interest in it, just a long phone interview
with the CEO. He seemed like a nice young fellow but that's about the only positive thing I can say.

Let's take a tour of the company and see their sales force in action, closing deals and see if there's a
correlation between the amount of contracts signed and the current market cap.


I don't envision much of a sales force. That's where the answers to my questions became especially
convoluted.

Whistle blower. Really? Getting a little extreme, don't you think? A lot of companies have run free promotions to help
boost sales. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book. I jumped in early based on the concept, got lucky with all the
recent hype. Jumped out around $22.00 and bought back in at $23.50 because I have to admit to being greedy, only
to see the stock tank and again bailed at 19.00. So now I read your article and understand your position. I wonder at
what price did you short??? Because one reason I would give not to short is that the idea is very good and like FB
and others, can be built on and has the potential to expand rapidly. Especially if a big player buys in.

I really liked your article that you did on live, great researching. if I shorted the stock jan 29, when would I have to
cover by to a void the 3 to 1 split? 
Feb 2rd or by the Feb 11th. If I have 1500 at $17 shares and the split happens do I have to buy 4500 shares to cove?
I am newbie.

Chris I never shorted anything but I remember some people got wiped out with Interactive Broker's "auto liquidation" ..
. not clear how it works exactly but sounds like something you might want to look out for - especially if these guys are
out to manipulate the market...

@ Michael Spacey, it means getting not having enough to cover the margin if the stock goes up, meaning if
you have 10K in your IB account, short a stock with your entire balance of 10K and the stock more than
doubles, meaning your account is down more than 10K, IB along with any broker automatically closes your
position.


Shorting stocks is for the seasoned investor, and Margin always needs to be kept in mind. It would be unwise
to short a stock with a significant portion of your capital. If you have a 10K account and short a stock with only
1k it takes far more to lose 10K if you are on the wrong side, you also not make as much assuming the stock
does fall.


Long story short, if your going to short, have some bank roll to back your investment, and if you know what
your doing pump stocks do always fall, don't expect the stock to fall all the way back down, due to shorts
covering and thin liqudity

The new CEO was brought in to make changes and the business model has drastically changed. Never said
it was a scam, but just because it has been around for awhile doesn't mean that it isn't drastically overvalued.

Very true, the company has been overhauled (the CEO has been there since 2011 so I suppose he is
relatively new), whether or not it is for the good remains to be seen. The company does however, seem to
have a decent board of directors:

Product to me looks very promising if they had the app already out for the IOS and Android I would feel more
comfortable holding it longer term.The word Scam Fraud are scare tactic words and sound desperate .Right now with
the way it trades ...shorts(drose)no offense.. and pumpers are just moving it around.Companies btw should not do a 3
for 1 split if things are bad at the company so things have to be going well if not thats just awful business. Basically a
5.17 stock after the split at these prices and 50-60 mill mkt cap .If 1 million people download the app when it comes
out how do we put a value on that I dont know how& IMHO that would not be that hard to get 1million with social
media these days.

limited penetration in a few markets and limited user base.

I forgot to mention. Did anyone else notice that their PR website is now using "AccessWire" instead of "MarketWire",
so now it's really legit PR. I have a friend who works for a "boutique" PR firm for microcap stocks. They try to do their
DD and deal with legitimate companies trying to get access to capital but obviously still in the R&D phase etc... He
said this is the biggest joke of a PR job he's ever seen. The mere fact that if they didn't have the disclaimer on their
radio spots a novice would think they are listening to a CNBC analyst picking the stock and pumping his 5000% gains,
pretty much proves this is a pump and dump. I agree with him.

I think there's good enough circumstantial evidence to draw a conclusion about the company's financial status, as well
as their lack of penetration in the market and lack of user adoption. You know, I'm a software developer and I can
create a website that looks and acts like Facebook in 3 to 4 weeks. Does that mean I can start advertising that I'm
going to get a billion users and have the same valuation as FB? No way. Then on top of that, what if the PR funding I
was using came from a shady place?


I think that the people going long this stock are just really inexperienced investors with more "hope" than common
sense.

And then CAMT ran from 3.4 to 5.8. Poor people sold to shorts as they were covering and thats what
happening here they are begging so bad for people to sell because they want to cover its starting to get
comical .Again I'm sorry you guys are so under water please do not let what happened to the guy on the the
yahoo board he was forced to cover automatically by his broker at 25 and lost 125,000 and wiped his acct out
and now owes the brokerage firm 5000 ouch.


07 Feb 2014, 11:43 AM

I always love the false analogies employed to rationalize a pump and dump outift. In comparing LIVE to
CAMT you might as well compare them to GE because whatever you think of CAMT - which btw has gone
nowhere in two months - they actually does have a legitimate business function in the sense that they make
things and sell them. LIVE in nothing but a crude marketing campaign to sell YOU stock. There's nothing else
there. And there's no past successes or even hint of success behind them.


What we're now seeing is the natural falloff in investor reflex response to PR's. Just telling us how great they
are no longer moves the stock so today they find some meaningless second derivative - web traffic - to pump
the stock and because it's a new metric it has some short term effect . . . the first time. Next time they'll have
to find another way to hype the stock without actually producing earnings.

suicide.I feel bad for that guy that lost everything he probably listened to one of these bashers then shorted LIVE and
now he's out 130,000.I can only lose what I put in and its has to go to zero for that to happen.If the app does come
out we should see an even bigger pop so I can see why shorts are so desperate.The washout on my charts was
yesterday. I dont think many real sellers left for you guys to cover in the 13's again.The smart shorts have either
covered already or will cover soon dont get left holding the bag when it gets squeezed again after the split. A run to 8

Hate to tell you but almost all stocks get promoted some how even if they dont want to be.Social Media has
changed everything.Soon as livedeal comes to my city I will be using it. I have coupons in my kitchen that get
mailed to me from a year ago I plan to use and never do I forget they are there just wasted advertising.This
seems to me to connect the hungry person immediately to the restaurant that has a livedeal waiting.What
ever you think ...it might not work thats for sure but the promoting is getting alot of eyes on what they do and if
it catches on -Then I dont know where it can go or what the valuation would be .To be short here is scary.I can
deal with a stock going down when i'm long but being short and a broker can cover instantly no thanks .Good
luck to the shorts and hope you are nimble enough to cover before app gets released.I have never used
YELP-what do they do I have no idea.Reviews or something I think.Whats their market cap. Groupon 4 yrs of
emails sent to me never used one.Maybe I'm crazy but I think livedeal is onto something.We shall see.GLTA

Nothing wrong with stocks being promoted when the promotion is grass-roots, organic promotion by investors
who are excited about a great product or service they have used.

The inferences from your articles, if correct, will have grave consequences. The stock price could collapse below a

2. The number of merchants (clients) and users are suspicious at best. Look at their newest press release claiming
153% increase in web traffic. 40.6% of their traffic is from India. Most likely, they paid for a bot net, as i don't think
people in India are looking for places to eat in California. Also the average page views are only 1.38 per user. People
aren't interacting with the site. 
3. Their financials tell a bleak story of increasing losses and bleak revenues.


I think what he's saying is that the company isn't worth more than a couple bucks a share at best, and probably even
as an aquisition.

There's also residual value in LIVE as a shell company. A nasdaq listing is probably worth at least $1M these
days. That alone should make LIVE worth 15 - 20c/share post-split.

How many shares are you short 500 I would love to know.Yes it helps YELP not LIVE but it helps the industry
that LIVE is in and validates its staying power as a real business. 
Reasons to cover-Is emotion & greed thats why you cover a stock that splits people see the next GMCR
CTSH MSFT PZZA SHOO YHOO or just name any company that has split multiple times-This is LIVE's 1st
split what if they split 3 more times at 2 for 1 in next 4-5 yrs it still would have under 100 mill shares
outstanding it can happen and people will buy and hold to see if they did find a great growth story.Read the
book stock split secrets.These low float split stocks do not come along that often.And as I said before I have
no clue what valuation to put on LIVE today or in 6 months but a 120 mill market cap(or $12 after split) might
still look cheap to investors after the app launch and entrance to other big cities .You have huge balls and a
strong stomach holding through the split-I wish you well .GLTA.BTW my buddy in LA uses livedeal - 3 of his
favorite restaurants where on there.So I guess some people do use it.Can you imagine that .

Author’s reply »  I can't find it right now but there was a joke during the tech bubble about how you could buy
100 shares of whatever hot tech stock there was and in a couple of months you would have 400 shares
because they would have done so my splits. Stock splits do not affect the fundamental value of the stock. And
just to clarify, I'm going to keep my short on until the fundamental story changes, if it does.

more.

Tech bubble lmao I lived through the .com that was not the joke.Looks to me you were maybe 6 or 7 yrs old
when that went down.Internet was new and real business no one could put a value on it.If this was tech
bubble time LIVE would be a 300 dollar stock already.Your funny.Fishingrods.com Bowlingshoes.com
Haircuts.com..Anything with a .com at the end of it you became rich that was the joke.No revs didnt matter
you were a .com selling your products online.

GRPN is at 3x revenues.

You should have covered before split Drose guess my old age and experience prevailed with this one. Sorry
buy already 8 bucks=24 and with the app release we probably get 12. Hope you did not lose to much I hate to
see people lose money.GLTA

No its basically a start up in the hottest industry with a great idea that people will use. Fundamentals get
thrown out the window for the 1st 2 yrs(its a huge growth opportunity not a value company)Like I said I have
no idea what market cap to put on this. OPEN 1.7 bill mkt cap on 190 mill in rev If they become 10% of what
OPEN is its a $15-17 stock. Some people think it can become as big as OPEN or even bigger- hope you
covered before split like could get nasty once brokers force the covering of short positions.GLTA

Author’s reply »  Nope haven't covered. It's sized appropriately, I'll let you know when I do cover.


12 Feb 2014, 11:36 AM


zonaridge1123
Please do -Starting to think your short 100 shares. I sold half at 7.55 today letting other half ride.Good Luck to
you.5-6 mill traded already some big boys want in.


12 Feb 2014, 12:40 PM


zonaridge1123
And a stop loss at 6 my cost avg on the rest -so I have ZERO risk right now.Nice feeling gotta say -If I was
short I would be a little nervous with the volume today usually a pretty good indicator of another upward move
along with real accumulation is taking place.


12 Feb 2014, 12:51 PM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yeah I'm not really nervous. As I said position is sized appropriately and we can talk in 3-6
months. Just curious, how do you think this company generates revenue?


12 Feb 2014, 02:19 PM


zonaridge1123
Once they get enough merchants and returning users it should be pretty easy. Advertisements of
course.Maybe eventually a small monthly fee like netflix for merchants.And merchants will want to pay to
have their deal come up 1st on the platform once enough people use it.We all know every knows how google
makes money right.With live deal Food and Beverage 1st then eventually other vendors. 
But they need to crawl before they can walk then jog then eventually run.This company is still an infant and
only in 3 cities .So like I said before I have no clue how large livedeal can get but we shall see. I believe in the
idea and I would check livedeal every night whether if I was either planning on ordering in or going out with
family and friends.As of today I'm in the money and have no risk so i'm very happy.GLTA on another note very
pissed I sold my CSTE.


12 Feb 2014, 03:41 PM


zonaridge1123
Well your position just tripled today and Live up 36 % and almost made a new high so go ahead short
more.And By a whole lot more do you mean another 100 shares.

Author’s reply »  The position didn't triple today. It increased by 35%, big difference. My short position is not
3x larger than it was yesterday. Not sure why you think my short is 100 shares but whatever. If you give me a
good reason for this being valued at 30X (or whatever it is now) GRPN then I'll tell you how big my short is.
Deal?


12 Feb 2014, 04:59 PM


zonaridge1123
Potential ,Growth, Small float, small mkt cap, People will use and its tiny compared to its peers..... is TWTR
really worth that mkt cap......In reality no but in this market people pay up for growth.Again I have no clue
what mkt cap LIVE deserves. Maybe you will be right and its worth 3 bucks sorry 1 buck post split one day..
but right now the momentum is to the upside and the volume yesterday proved it.

and selling ads.

Your the same person that told me there is no reason to cover LIVE before the split -Clueless.You could have
covered at 17 and re shorted at 27(9 today) and saved yourself 10 pts but what do I know .Advertisements do
not generate revenue really? Ok not sure what world you are from but believe what you want. 
I know you do not want to tell me your short position because its only 500 shares and you are under water.I
also do not need to know your short position I have already seen your cards.These bashers are to funny oh
well . BTW I moved my stop to 7.32. See you at 12 shortly.shortly. Im done with this board Good Luck to longs
and shorts-Shorts you guys will need it sorry for your pain but I suggested you should cover before the split.I
guess the app announcement is next I wonder how much will LIVE pps go up when that comes out.


13 Feb 2014, 01:29 PM


Mr. Pink
Chris, I think the market cap might be more like $300M now, there are 127,000 prefered shares which are convertable
to 12.7M shares + 1M warrants and options, + 4.4M common = 18M shares x $17.25 = $310M

I posted below on different "thread" then I looked at LIVE today in ThinkorSwim, "off $10". I thought, "Boy was I
wrong." (sort of).... Whoops, "TOS" was wrong, LIVE back at highs...


fwiw: this thread is getting all the "action", so I thought I'd re-post here:

I typed LIVE into my brokerage platform looking for live cattle and found this company a couple of weeks ago. I looked
at it quickly and the concept looks interesting - better than groupon for sure; however, a company this early in
development is a crap shoot... EITHER WAY.


Trying to short this stock, especially since it is hard to borrow, I'll leave to fools and hard core gamblers because any
investor who lived through the late 1990s - or even heard about it - knows sentiment knows no bounds.

No question $LIVE is worthless. Half their traffic comes from India. A sure sign of an intentional pump. Question is,
how high can it go before crashing? $LOTE went to over $1B valuation before going to next to nothing.

Gee, what a shocker, LIVE is down to $7 already. Only -$6.40 more to go.
