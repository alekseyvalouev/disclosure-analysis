Kandi Set To Surrender Gains Again
Oct. 1, 2013 9:30 AM ET110 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Volatile times have returned once again to Kandi Technologies (NASDAQ:KNDI). Just 8
days ago, Kandi was a $5.00 stock. But then 3 bullish articles and 1 brief press release
sent the stock soaring by more than 80%.


Back in June we saw the same thing. The stock more than doubled to $8.50 on the back
of several extremely bullish articles and 2 press releases that appeared transformational
for Kandi. Predictions swirled that "this time was the real deal" and that Kandi would
continue to soar to ever higher highs. But just as it has each time in the past, Kandi
quickly fell by 50% from those highs, giving up nearly all of its gains. The stock quickly
settled back to below $4.50 and the transformational news was forgotten.


We are now seeing the same phenomenon again. The recent gains are evaporating on
huge volume. By Monday, the shares had fallen by as much as 20% to $7.50 in extended
hours trading. Just as we saw in June and July, the stock is once again likely to find itself
back around $5.00 as investors come to better understand the latest developments.


I have lived in and out of China for over 20 years. I speak Chinese. I have owned and
driven multiple electric vehicles in China. I have followed Kandi for years. If Kandi truly
had multi bagger potential, I would be the first one to take a large long position and tell the
world why. I would be thrilled to make a few hundred percent, as predicted by the Kandi
bulls.


No one can predict what will happen in 5-10 years. It may still be the case that Kandi can
turn itself into the company that its promoters are claiming it is now.


But in the near term, there are two reasons why the stock is basically certain to return to
$5.00 or below.


First, some of the most important information being written by the Kandi bulls is 100%
inaccurate. Despite the claims of the Kandi bulls, even with the cooperation with Geely,
Kandi is still a very small player in the EV market in China. The bulls continually suggest
that Kandi is the only or the largest EV player in China. They liken Kandi to Tesla Motors
(NASDAQ:TSLA), BYD or ZipCar (ZIP) which is just simply not the case.

Kandi's latest surge is due to the hype surrounding China's announcement of subsidies for
electric vehicles. But what the bulls have missed is that there are in fact hundreds of
identical EV makers in China that make cars which are nearly identical to Kandi. These
manufacturers are already selling a far greater volume than Kandi. In fact, during the last
quarter, Kandi only sold a few hundred EVs in total. The vast majority of its sales were for
gasoline powered Go Karts. Other EV makers in China have a wide head start on Kandi,
even though American stock market investors have never heard of them.


The latest developments with Geely and HangZhou will no doubt increase Kandi's sales of
EVs into the thousands within a year or so.


But any statement that Kandi is the "only" company who will benefit from Chinese
subsidies is 100% false. In fact, any statement that Kandi is a meaningful player in
the Chinese EV market is 100% false. Investors who wish to confirm this can do so
quite easily for themselves.


A link to prices and descriptions of literally hundreds of identical vehicles from different
manufacturers can be found here on Alibaba. These descriptions are in English. In
addition, beyond these there are even hundreds of additional makes and models which
are listed in Chinese only. Additional searches on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) or even Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) will reveal the same thing. Those who are interested can simply paste
in the search term "电动汽车". The performance specs for these vehicles are nearly
identical to the very generic vehicle made by Kandi. The production capacities for these
hundreds of manufacturers in China is often larger than Kandi's. And the prices of these
vehicles is consistently in the same range as (or even lower than) Kandi's.


This directly contradicts the repeated statements of the Kandi promoters that Kandi is
unique in China the way that Tesla is in the US. It is simply a convenient hyperbole which
helps to boost the stock.


The second reason why Kandi refuses to hold its gains is that Kandi is starting to
become an obvious stock promotion scheme for Kandi to sell stock at higher
prices.


Whenever the stock spikes, it is only because of promotional articles and well timed press
releases from Kandi. Each time it seems that Kandi then issues millions worth of stock
and the price immediately begins to plunge.


We have now seen the same exact game three times in 2013 alone. And we just saw
it again last week.

We saw this in January when Kandi announced Geely news just in time to extend the
maturity of millions of dollars in warrants.


We then saw it again in June when Kandi's share price soared by 100% to $8.50 following
two press releases and several hyper promotional articles. The promotion and ramp up in
the stock coincided perfectly with Kandi's need to issue equity immediately thereafter.
Kandi had $25 million in debt coming due the following week and only $3 million in cash.
After Kandi issued $26 million in stock plus millions of warrants, the stock quickly fell back
to around $4.50. The seemingly "transformational news" quickly became irrelevant after
Kandi had the money in hand.


Now we have seen it again in September. Once again, Kandi soared past $8.50 on a
series of promotional articles and a press release. This was no different than in June. The
stock had previously been trading at just $5.08. On September 20th, Kandi once again
took advantage of the fortuitous share price spike to file an S3 registration statement
covering over a million warrants which will result in over $5 million of new money to Kandi.
The strike price on the warrants was $5.40, such that without a convenient stock
promotion, the warrants would not be exercised and Kandi would not take in the $5
million. As in the past, now that Kandi has their money, the stock has quickly begun to
plunge. The stock has already fallen by as much as 20% from its recent high and on very
heavy volume.


The point is that every time the stock surges on major news, it seems to coincide
with Kandi extracting money from an elevated stock sale. And every time Kandi
gets it money, the stock price fades almost immediately.


Evaluating the recommendations from Kandi bulls


Authors Art Porcari, Harris Goldman and Tom Konrad have now written over 30 articles on
Kandi between them.


Art Porcari himself has now written 19 articles on Kandi and has never written an article
focused on a single other company. He is solely focused on this single stock. Mr. Porcari
previously ran his own brokerage firm and his financial involvement with Kandi and its
management dates back roughly to its reverse merger more than 5 years ago. In a
previous article, I documented Mr. Porcari's regulatory violations where he misled
investors by providing inaccurate information to imply a "short squeeze" in order to inflate
the value of a stock. I will leave it to readers to determine for themselves if this is relevant
to the present.

5/22/2018 Kandi Set To Surrender Gains Again - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 4/40


On June 24th he wrote an article that made the most bullish claims for Kandi yet, stating:
"Kandi Technologies' Recent Multi-Billion Dollar Coup Creates An Avis ZipCar Times Ten"


As always, it was the prediction of a short squeeze that would make this investment payoff
for those who quickly bought shares of Kandi. The stock surged (as always) and the very
next day Kandi issued $26 million in stock. Management at Kandi should certainly be
grateful for this timely publication of the "Billion Dollar Coup" analysis. But as soon as
Kandi had their money, the stock price began to plunge. It settled below $4.50 within
weeks.


Again on September 17th, the former brokerage owner predicted that an epic short
squeeze would send Kandi soaring. Kandi did in fact soar based on the information
provided by Mr. Porcari. Within 3 days, Kandi was filing an S3 for warrants which
otherwise would not have been exercisable. Over the past 3 days, we can already see the
20% plunge from the top.


Mr. Porcari's relationship with Kandi management and his initial ownership of stock dates
back to the time of their reverse merger. But Mr. Porcari has publicly stated that he has not
taken compensation at any time for promoting the stock over the past few years or for
introducing various investors to Kandi.


In actuality, investors who have bought on the back of Porcari articles have done
extremely well for themselves - just as long as they get in early and then dump their
shares within a few days of the rise. If the institutional buyers cited by Mr. Porcari have
been selling on the back of each pump, then this series of successful articles has become
a formula for them to make millions of dollars every few months. But those who simply
hold their shares find that their gains all consistently evaporate within a few weeks of the
pump.


Back in June, Mr. Porcari had given assurances in comments on Seeking Alpha and
Yahoo! Finance that somehow he knew who was holding the majority of shares in the float
and that these were very firm hands that would not sell below $15-30. He also assured us
that Kandi would never consider issuing stock at prices below $15.00. Some were
therefore surprised when Kandi issued $26 million of stock at $6.02 and the "firm hand"
investors clearly dumped their stock. After hitting a new high for the year, Kandi quickly
plunged by 50%.


But again, the pattern to notice is that Mr. Porcari tends to write his articles when the
share price is low. The share price then leaps up accordingly, which is very fortunate when
Kandi needs to raise money. As a result, buying on the back of a Porcari article has been

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 5/40


profitable, but only if one sells very quickly thereafter.


This contrasts sharply with Harris Goldman.


Mr. Goldman has written a total of 4 articles on Seeking Alpha. As with Mr. Porcari, he has
never written about any stock other than Kandi, despite his 40 years of investment
experience. Likewise, of the 70 comments he has written on Seeking Alpha, he has only
once referred to any company other than Kandi. Mr. Goldman does not appear to be a
financial advisor, but repeatedly "advises" investors to buy and hold Kandi.


Unlike Mr. Porcari, Mr. Goldman tends to write on Kandi when enthusiasm is already high.
We then see a brief surge in the share price followed by a sustained fall.


It is clear from his articles that Mr. Goldman adamantly refuses to even acknowledge any
new findings on Kandi which might be negative. This has been the case even when such
findings are brought forth by others who have been long the stock. We can see from his
comments that when authors such as Tom Konrad are bullish, then their analysis is
described as fantastic. When their analysis reveals problems, then it is denigrated as
garbage.


This is a very dangerous and costly way to invest.


Mr. Goldman's last article came on September 24th and the statements he made appear
to have caused a tremendous surge of around 40% in the share price. The stock quickly
hit a lifetime high following his article. Unfortunately a number of the facts given by Mr.
Goldman which drove the share price were entirely false.


It is likely that some investors may still be relying on this inaccurate information. Once it is
better understood, we are likely to see continued selling.


Mr. Goldman clearly states that:


Yes, Kandi is now in the unique position of taking full advantage of this news
by being the only "mass marketer" of affordable electric cars (EV's) in China.
No other EV manufacturer can match Kandi's pricing and availability in
China.


If it were really the case that Kandi were to be to sole recipient of billions of dollars in
Chinese government subsidies, then Kandi would be a $100 stock immediately. But
instead, there are clearly hundreds of other manufacturers who make low speed vehicles
which are nearly identical to Kandi's.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 6/40


In describing the winners and losers from the newly announced subsidies, Tom Konrad
names a few of the more obvious candidates such as Chery Automotive, Shandong
Shifeng Group and Hebei Yu Jie Ma. Hundreds more can be found on Alibaba or by
looking at the official list from China's MIIT. Alternatively one can use Alibaba, Google or
Baidu to runs one's own search.


Mr. Goldman also states that:


Currently Kandi has the largest EV manufacturing capabilities in the world.


Again, this is a statement that is demonstrably inaccurate, but it boosted the price of the
stock considerably. Aside from the other manufacturers in China, we already know that
companies such as GM (NYSE:GM) (with the Volt) and Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) (with the
Leaf) have much larger capacities. Even BMW is already on par with Kandi. And this does
not count the numerous other manufacturers in China.


After briefly exceeding $9.00 for just minutes due to this inaccurate information, Kandi
began a steady descent on heavy volume. By Monday, the stock closed at $7.78, near the
low of the day.


Prior to his article, the stock had been in the $6's, so it seems safe to assume that this is
where the stock will return once the true facts are more widely disseminated.


Likewise, past articles from Mr. Goldman have delivered projections which can only be
described as fantastic. He had previously given us some simple math to state that Kandi
will quickly be doing $2 billion in sales.


Everyone is clearly entitled to make their own assumptions, but this one is clearly very
extreme. For reference, in its most recent quarter Kandi sold just $12 million of total
product. Of this, $7.1 million (59%) of sales were gasoline powered Go Karts (not EVs). In
fact EVs accounted for just $2 million in sales. This would equate to just over 300 vehicles
for the quarter. The ramp-up to $2 billion will have to be very step indeed - Kandi would
have to increase EV sales by 1,000x!


It also means that Kandi is expected to be among the sole suppliers of EVs in China,
despite the existence of hundreds of competitors.


Such hyperbole in an article can be good for a quick share price pop. But we can see from
his past articles that the typical response to putting out information that is either outlandish
or inaccurate has been that the share price quickly begins to sell off after the initial surge.

The author with the best track record on Kandi has been Tom Konrad who writes for
Forbes and www.altenergystocks.com, as well as Seeking Alpha. Tom is a money
manager who has written a number of positive articles on Kandi.


On September 18th, Tom provided an update at Forbes regarding the new subsidies.
Unlike Mr. Goldman, Tom made it a point to highlight the fact that the benefit of the
subsidies would in fact apply to numerous manufacturers aside from Kandi.


Tom was clearly bullish on the prospects for Kandi when the stock was at $5.00. But by
the time his article was republished on Seeking Alpha a week later, Tom noted the
following:


The day after this article was first published, Kandi issued a press release
detailing the benefits of the new subsidy policy on its operations and received
significant coverage in the US press. The stock soared as high as $7 over the
next two days, and I sold my position.


Over the past few years, Tom has been focused on making Kandi into a profitable trade
rather than on encouraging US investors to keep chasing the stock to ever higher levels.
While Mr. Porcari and Mr. Goldman have only ever written about a single stock, Mr.
Konrad writes on a wide variety of alternate energy stocks and lately has developed a bias
towards graphene stocks.


We can see that Tom has evaluated the opportunity and views Kandi as a good long
opportunity, but one in which it is wise to take profits when possible. This is especially true
given the unique risk factors due to Kandi's history.


Tom had previously written an article entitled "Rent this EV Stock and Enjoy the Ride, But
Don't Keep it Too Long". Investors who paid attention to this article profited handsomely
within weeks. In the article, he evaluates the lengthy investigation into these
misrepresentations made by a website called the Sharesleuth. Investors should keep in
mind that these comments come from a Kandi bull who was long the stock at the time.
This demonstrates that it is important to avoid the temptation to ignore new developments,
just because you don't like them. Mr. Konrad notes the following:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 8/40


With this in mind, I set out last month to parse through the novel-length and
rather dense Kandi-bashing articles to demonstrate that there was nothing
there for investors to worry about. I failed, and instead found myself doubting
the judgement and/or honesty of Kandi's management. I'd like to emphasize
that there is no proof of wrongdoing, but investors who wish to hold on to their
money don't have the luxury of waiting until their suspicions are confirmed
beyond a reasonable doubt.


Mr. Konrad also goes on to point out the following:


My distillation of the Sharesleuth revelations is:


A number of people made millions off Kandi's reverse merger, and
these people were never properly identified in the company's SEC filings.
From 2009 to 2011, Kandi significantly overstated the number of EVs it
sold. After Sharesleuth showed that Kandi's claimed sales of EVs were not
supported by the number imported or sold by Kandi's dealers, the
company quietly revised its financial statements, revealing that many of
its claimed EV sales were actually sales of gas powered vehicles.


He also notes that it was "unlikely" that the false EV sales were a mistake.


He concludes with:


After weighing the evidence, I no longer consider Kandi a long-term hold.
That said, my concerns about management are long-term in nature, If you
still own Kandi, enjoy the ride, but this hot EV stock should be a rental,
not a purchase or even a long term lease.


Not surprisingly, the Kandi promoters were furious at this expression of skepticism. Even
though he disclosed that he continued to maintain a reduced long position., the message
boards (and the Kandi private yahoo forum) as well as a Seeking Alpha reprint lit up with
criticism that Mr. Konrad had either become a shill for the shorts or else was trying to talk
down the share price so he could load up cheaply.


Mr. Konrad wrote his prior article in June, just before the stock hit all time highs. Both his
enthusiasm and caution were well advised because within weeks, the stock had fallen by
50%. It remained at those levels until September.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 9/40


His September article came out when the stock was still in the $5's. But within days Mr.
Konrad was selling at $7.00. It was an enviable trade.


The goal here is to make profits, not to hold on and repeatedly watch them evaporate. On
this latest trade Mr. Konrad likely netted about 40% by getting out at $7.00 and he does
not seem concerned about the fact that he did not call the exact top. If the past is any
guide, investors with a long term interest in Kandi will certainly get another opportunity to
buy the shares at below $5.00 again.


Does recent "news" really justify the share price rise ?


Over the past few months, Kandi has put out several press releases which occasionally
moved the stock. These press releases were often interpreted and amplified by the
authors above which helped make for dramatic (albeit temporary) gains in the share price.


As we can see, these articles often contain a mix of opinion, bias and even factual
mistakes.


The most important thing is to determine is whether or not the information
contained in the press releases actually merited a doubling of the stock price.


It is also instructive to see how the release of these news items coincides with
Kandi's desire to immediately raise money by selling stock.


Press release #1


On June 5th, Kandi issued a press release stating "Kandi-Geely Co-developed Pure
Electric Sedan Receives Approval from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of
China"


Prior to this news, Kandi had closed at just $3.92. It should have been apparent to most
that Kandi needed to issue equity in the near future. Kandi had $25 million in debt
maturing in 2 weeks and only $3 million in cash. . In many of the preceding days, the stock
had only traded 20,000-60,000 shares. In short, it was at too low of a price and too illiquid
to for Kandi to issue stock. Fortunately the press release and (several positive articles)
caused the price to rise as high as $8.50 within days. It also quickly traded as many as 18
million shares in a day - a jump of as much as 1,000x from prior levels.


The problem with this announcement is that the MIIT list referenced by Kandi included
literally thousands of other vehicles made by hundreds of other manufacturers. None of
these competitors saw any reason to put out a press release and none of their share



http://en.kandivehicle.com/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=66

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 10/40


prices showed any reaction whatsoever . For example, shares of Geely Automotive
were basically flat to slightly down on below average volume that day, even though the
sedan being referenced was co-developed by Kandi and Geely.


The press release simply mentioned that Kandi had been included on the same list that
nearly every other manufacturer in China had been included on. In fact, the real surprise
would have been if Kandi had NOT been included on this list.


This "news" was therefore a non event simply because the exact same "news"
applied equally to hundreds of other companies in China.


After the initial spike, the market seemed to figure out the nature of this non event. The
stock quickly gave up more than 30% of these gains, trading down to $6.06 within days. It
was falling each day and looked set to fall further.


Press release #2


On June 20th (just 1 week before selling stock), Kandi issued a second press release.
"Kandi Technologies Plans to Deploy 5000-10000 Pure EVs in Hangzhou for the Initial
Launch of Public EV Sharing System by the End of 2013"


With just days to go before issuing stock, this press release caused the stock to jump by
as much as 27% to as high as $7.68 on substantial volume. It was curious to see this
reaction given that it was actually a repetition of news that was announced in 2012 and
with an original size of up to 20,000 vehicles.


If anything, this news should have been a letdown. But it was portrayed as a massive
positive and the stock soared.


In any case, this "news" was in reality a non event. But the timing of it was very
coincidental.


Many readers are apparently not aware that just 2 days before releasing this latest news,
Kandi had just signed an engagement letter with FT Global to raise money via a stock
sale. A copy of the engagement letter between Kandi and FT Global is dated June 18th.


This is very important. The financing had already been planned just before
releasing this "news". It was NOT the case that Kandi was simply opportunistic on
the back of a fortuitous rise in the share price.


Press release #3

5/22/2018 Kandi Set To Surrender Gains Again - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 11/40


As I wrote in my first article, Kandi had over $25 million in notes and short term payables
coming due just days later, beginning on June 24th. Meanwhile Kandi had just $3 million
in cash. I felt that predicting an equity offering was quite easy. And in fact, on June 26th
Kandi issued $26 million in stock.


The date of the equity issuance was almost exact to the day as to what was
predicted. In addition, the amount of money raised was also almost exactly what
was predicted. This was not a coincidence by any means.


But as an immediate response to my article (and before issuing the stock), Kandi assured
investors of the following in a press release:


- Kandi's debts had already been repaid (despite having only $3 million in cash)


- The previous S3 from the company wasn't used until more than 1 year after it was filed


The conclusion was clear: Kandi didn't need money and wasn't about to issue
stock.


As should have been expected, the share price rebounded on these assurances.


But within 24 hours of that press release, Kandi was issuing $26 million in stock.


Kandi had hit a new high of $8.50. But as soon as the company had its money, the
promotion ended and the stock fell by almost 50%.


Press release #4


This takes us to the latest press release in September, which immediately preceded the
filing of the S3 to register the warrant shares.


On September 19th, (just one day before filing the S3) Kandi issued a press release
stating Kandi Technologies Announces Chinese Government Issued 2013-2015 Subsidy
Policy for New Energy Vehicles


This press release mentions nothing specific to Kandi and the news should have been
entirely expected by anyone who follows the electric vehicle market in China. It was simply
codifying what had already been expected by the entire market. As before, the same news
applies to hundreds of other EV makers in China.


Once again, this was a non event. As a result, any boost to the share price is certain
to be short lived.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1722392-kandi-set-to-surrender-gains-again 12/40


But the press release (and the positive articles shown above) caused the share price to
quickly double, hitting a new all time high.


Once again, all of this excitement came just in time for Kandi to file an S3 registration
statement covering the sale of over 1 million shares. The 992,731 shares under the $5.40
strike warrants could not be issued unless the stock was above this price. Kandi would not
have been able to receive its money and the warrant investors would not have made a
penny.


But with the stock at over $8.00 exercising the warrants was no problem. Likewise, with
the volume at these levels, selling those shares will be easy for the warrant holders. As a
result, Kandi takes in millions in new money while the warrant investors make millions in
profits.


As an aside, the $5.40 strike warrants were originally struck at $6.30, but this strike price
was reduced to $5.40 as described in the S3. In addition, the S3 registers more shares
under warrants that were given to Placement Agent FT Global. These can be sold starting
in January 2014.


Conclusion


Those who feel that "this time is different" for Kandi in September should realize that the
volume in June was massively higher than it is now. And in fact, the news in June
appeared to be far more substantial. Yet the June surge didn't hold for more than a week
or two and Kandi returned to below $4.50.


Kandi shares have now become less of an investment selection than they have become a
simple vehicle for promotion and speculation. Investors no longer need to concern
themselves with the longer term prospects for Kandi. All they need to know is that
occasional bursts of promotion and press releases will consistently provide a sharp (but
brief) rise in the stock. We have seen this same pattern repeatedly during 2012 and 2013.
Those who get in early do well - as long as they get out quickly.


Someday Kandi may actually turn itself into a substantial producer of EVs. But over the
past few years there have been repeated false starts in the US, in Italy and in China. Each
of those appeared to be the tremendous inflection point for Kandi. When the details were
announced, they were heavily promoted and the stock price rose - but only briefly.


The biggest beneficiary of these brief promotions is clearly Kandi when it continues to
issue new shares which would otherwise not be issuable.

The recent 80% run-up in the share price is in all respects identical to what we saw in
June. Kandi and its promoters issue "news" and analysis which causes a spike in the
share price. This all happens just in time for Kandi to raise more money through share
sales. But because the reality behind the press release consists of nothing more than non
events, the share price will quickly fade once the promotion falters.


Some may wonder: how does this all work ?


Ironically, Art Porcari explains in this article how firms with financial "muscle" can move a
stock higher and then short it on the way down. This is what happened in previous days,
but it seems that the intention was to move the stock price UP as opposed to DOWN.
According to Mr. Porcari:


Depending on how he feels the volume will come out, he might buy a as many
as a few hundred thousand shares and take the stock up 4 or 5% quickly
buying ahead of the momentum traders who tend to chase it up. Then he
quickly reverses his position by taking the shares he just bought and start
pounding the bids. This serves him a dual purpose.


Mr. Porcari had previously stated that he had institutional "muscle", such as World Equity,
which could place orders for as much as 500,000 shares without even asking the
permission of their clients. That is muscle indeed and could certainly achieve the 4-5%
move that he describes above. Momentum traders then do the rest. When these early
buyers begin to sell (at a nice profit), the share price invariably plunges.


For those who have a brokerage background and the "muscle" to do so, this type of
induced volatility can be the formula for creating millions on profits.


As I stated at the beginning of this article: I have been in and out of China for more than
20 years. I have owned and driven numerous electric vehicles in China. If Kandi could
truly become a player in the EV market in China, I would be the first one to buy the stock
and I would be eager to tell the world why.


Kandi is still selling just a few hundred EV's per quarter. There are literally hundreds of
other low speed electric vehicle makers who already sell far more EVs in China than
Kandi. What we have seen is just another pump and promotion which has allowed Kandi
to raise millions more from selling its stock. It has also allowed a small group of investors
to pocket millions in trading profits.

Those who to play the press releases and promotions can certainly find a way to profit
from the swings in enthusiasm. But as we have seen, the hyper promotions only tend to
last for a few days or weeks. So knowing when to sell is the most important key to making
money (and avoiding losses).

You again attack KNDI with no credible evidence or true facts, but continue to employ your approach of innuendo and
attacking those who have spent significant hours researching and sharing their information. Who cares if you've lived
in China and driven EV's....I've lived in Tennessee and have tasted moonshine, but that doesn't mean I know if its the
next newcomer drink of the masses. You continue to have no credibility in your writings, are a nervous short given the
lack of availability of additional shares to short and you are trying to bail by drawing in other naive shorts to close your
unrealized loss positions. I do hope what is coming from Kandi very soon puts a huge dent in your borderline
unethical approach to manipulate investors.

Howdy,


I looked at the link you provided for alternative EV makers in China, and as for your claim the Kandi's EV is a Go-Cart,
I say, well ...they are all Go-Carts, minus a couple of Van like vehicles. Maybe you missed your entry point and want a
better price.


Government support means a lot more in China than here in the US, and if their deals to build out the EV
infrastructure in China with a rental service like ZipCar, then that has a lot of weight.


We will see :)

Cassina Tarsia, Contributor
I am sick and tired of personality-bashing! This article is more about bashing several people than it is about
the facts of the situation with Kandi. It is a wonder that SA allowed it into an article at all! What I want is real
information, and not simply an article trying to pull down Kandi. Actually, I think that Kandi may take off much
like Tesla did, not so long ago, and in much the same way ... except that Kandi has better financials, and so
when it moves it should go further ...


01 Oct 2013, 01:52 PM


Mark T. Phillips, Contributor
One of your worst articles in terms of content. I don't recall any other SA authors claiming that Kandi will be the "only"
EV manufacturer to benefit from the PRC's new EV subsidy policy. However, it is true that Kandi is one of the few
ways to invest in these major tailwinds to the Chinese automotive EV market.


Kandi may offer a product very similar to competitors in China, but can you name one that is offering anything like
their car share program which will allow customers to pay very low fees to rent a car whenever they want including
maintenance and insurance? Kandi offers a fantastic solution for those who do not want to own, or cannot afford their
own car.


Furthermore, your attack on SA authors Arthur Porcari and Harris Goldman continue to undermine your credibility.
Why is it negative if authors only follow one company? The fewer companies one follows, the more intimately they
tend to know them. Warren Buffet, Seth Klarman, and Phil Fisher all prefer(red) owning the stocks they are most
confident in/knowledgeable about, which has worked out quite well for all of them.

Regarding Press Release #1, you are right that this event did not warrant such a rapid appreciation in share price.
Unfortunately, the rest of your points are misleading at best.


Press release #2 - The 5,000-10,000 car share program is COMPLETELY separate from the 20,000 long lease
program announced last year. This has been repeated to you multiple times, yet you refuse to look at the facts as
outlined by the Chinese media, Sinopoly/Westlake, and Kandi.


Press release #3 - Kandi raised capital on an unwarranted raise in share price. Would you not do the same if you
were in their shoes? Elon Musk at Tesla did the same exact thing, stating on the Q1 earnings call that he had no
intention on raising capital through share issuance anytime soon and a week later Tesla sold more shares due to the
rapid appreciation in Tesla's share price.


Press release #4 - Funny how you insinuate that Kandi parroting the PRC's announcement of their EV subsidy policy
is a bad thing. This news is very beneficial to Kandi both in the short run and long run, I'm not sure why you seem to
think that this MAJOR announcement by the PRC does not warrant a press release.


01 Oct 2013, 10:24 AM


ejwipp
Agreed. And with regard to Press release #4, how does Pearson see this as a "non event"? The release of
subsidies is huge news for all EV manufacturers.


01 Oct 2013, 10:35 AM


Futurist
Mr. Pearson, 
You have again rehashed your proposition that KNDI is a tiny fraudulent Chinese stock company. I want to clear up a
couple of your misconceptions.


First KNDI is a profitable maker of ATVs and go carts. It does not shy away from its legacy business. However, it has
transformed itself to be the largest supplier of pure EV automobiles in China. It makes a small EV that has a patented
quick change battery system. A mechanical robot can change the batteries as fast as a normal fuel fill up. This is very
important since most Chinese auto purchasers live in apartments. Places where you can not charge a Leaf or a Tesla
or any of the other EV manufacturers that you name.  
In order to implement the KNDI strategy swapping stations need to be built. Batteries need to be stored. KNDI has
teamed up with State-Grid ( Chinas largest electrical provider) and large battery manufacturers. Kandis partners
furnish the battery and build the stations and charge the battery. The battery is not a part of the car price. KNDi is
simply paid a fee each time a battery is swapped to pay for the right to use the swapping system.


KNDI has worked hard to get all the ducks in a row to be able to sell a $9,000 EV. They have accomplished their
objective and now have the only viable solution for a middle class Chinese EV owner. Geely saw the potential and
partnered with KNDI. The subsidy will cover most of the price of the vehicles KNDI will produce. The average citizen
can now buy a car. HE can keep his car running. He can help save on pollution.


No other car company is in a position to do this. You might not understand the business model. You might not agree
with the business model. But you really should stick to the facts about KNDI and its business instead of skirting the

01 Oct 2013, 10:37 AM


Tom Harrison, Contributor
Sorry guys...here is why we have to read his crap these days. His last piece was an obviously short sellers push,
knocking the stock down back in June/July. Check out the short interest in early June and again today...from 700k to
3.3 million. Now look at the stock price today...at the high of the run in June. Now add to this the fact that there are
clearly no more shares to short for them to force the stock down again (as evidenced by the Reg Sho listing that
occurred for most of September AND....and let this part walk thru your brains for a moment....the current interest rate
for shorts to borrow KNDI from willing longs is significant....I mean well north of pawn shop usury rates. So what an
investor has to ask one's self is....is the short THAT certain that the stock is going from $8 to $3 or is the short
desperate? Read this guys two articles and then spend some time reading the numerous articles he himself refers to
above, not just from Art, Harris and Tom but the urban planner who wrote a brilliant SA article last month and who just
came back from China who, along with others, met the chairman, toured the facilities, toured the CarShare currently
built and noted the plans for the 112 soon to be constructed, visited QBEX stations and will soon write about their
efforts. Oh my!

As you likely know, I just returned Friday from a week long expensive trip to China visiting KNDI. Unlike you, I don't
spend a lot of time in China, though this is my second visit to KNDI. As in the prior trip, I took not one cent from KNDI

But this time, after being totally fed up with lazy short selling bloggers such as yourself, I brought along with me a

Kandi Technologies: Exceptional Strategy For China From An Urban Planning View

Aaron Rockett a Washington DC based Documentary producer,

and two Independent Buy Side Equity Research Analysts, one who is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) who have
represented major funds and brokerage firms. All of us paid our own way to include all expenses.


I did this to once and for all crush worthless self serving short sellers like yourself with your biggest nightmare.
Visually Documented Facts!


I am preparing two Seeking Alpha articles which will be loaded with pictures, Video and just plain facts to prove
beyond any doubt that KNDI is the leader in EV's in China along with every other claim I have made on the Company.


Aside from My work. Rockett will be producing a documentary on KNDI and its role as China EV leader which will be
aired nationwide.


As far as the analysts are concerned, it is not my business to ask them their immediate intentions, but witnessing
them with Management, and knowing they also saw everything that I did, I would be very surprised if we don't see
something come out very soon on the Company.


Now you claim you spend a lot of time in China. Why is it you have never taken a minute to either visit or Contact the
Company?


Now this is a rhetorical question, since I know you do not have the guts to respond to this. So investors reading this
worthless self serving piece, take this article for what its authors goal is. To help him and the other 3.4 million shares
of reported short sellers out of the Trap.


But this time, as you can see by the market response after this piece came out carrying the share price up 5%, the

Do you have a cite for the claim that KNDI is one of the smaller 'EV' manufacturers in China? I see the link for
Alibaba, but that doesn't really say anything about volumes of sales. We know the gov't recognizes 11k EV sales last
year, and that BYD accounted for 3k of them. Do you know who made up the rest? If not, what are you basing your
claim on?


I'm staying far away from KNDI myself, but that point you made would be huge if true.


01 Oct 2013, 11:54 AM


fan of the underdog
I found this press release from KNDI: 
http://bit.ly/19ULOLL


It points to them completing some sort of incestious purchase of a subsidiary (Zhejiang New Energy Vehicle
System Co., Ltd - aka "New Energy") by Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co. Ltd - aka "Kandi Vehicles". And that this
was a requirement for the joint venture with Geely. After which, the ownership gets transferred to Kandi
Electric Vehicles (Changxing) Co., Ltd - aka "Kandi Changxing". The Geely joint venture would then purchase
"Kandi Changxing" and another kandi company.


AFTER that last purchase, is the joint venture then considered the largest EV manufacturer in China: 
"Upon the completion of that process, the JV Company will become the largest pure EV manufacturer in
China"


I actually owned quite a bit of KNDI shares up til this morning (sold most of them now), but after reading the
words of warning from the author, I became leary of the stock. When there's such an obvious shell game
going on with a company, there's reason to be cautious.


I won't subscribe to the author's innuendo about other contributor's ill-intent, but I will say that I don't trust
Kandi management nor business practices in China. If I'm wrong, it's my loss, so be it.

If anyone is curious why I am refraining from defending his false claims against me in this article, it is because I did so
at length in his last 3 articles and I am not going to waste my time or serve his ego by wasting time on doing it again.

But to any common sense investor who might be prone to act on this article I would like to leave you with this quote.


"If you can't attack the Message, then attack the Messenger"


He has personally attacked me three time and ShareSleuth has six times on KNDI hit articles. He talks about positive
writers on KNDI? What about the 20 plus hit articles paid for by short sellers.


Yes, I have only written SA articles on KNDI. Why? Because it is the only Stock that I feel, and have felt over the
seven years I have followed it, that I feel 100% positive to speak intelligently about. And do look at my bio by clicking
on the picture atop this comment. I have been a Wall Street Pro for forty years now, So I do know how to do a solid
Due Diligence on the Company.


He wrote this article out of tangible fear that over the balance of this year, now that the China Subsidies have been
brought forth, KNDI is looking at as much as $100 million in sales for the last half of this year. Almost a quadruple of
the first half. They will also likely earn between $.55 and .65 per share. Next year, at least $350 million in sales with
over $2 a share in earnings.


A last statement of FACT.


NEVER ONCE HAS ANY ATTACK WRITER EVER ACCUSED KNDI OF ANY TYPE OF FRAUD, OR DOING
ANYTHING ILLEGAL. .

As they say, it's an ill wind that blows no one good. Articles like this one tend to bring out the short-sellers. But there
are precious few KNDI shares to borrow. So Plan B is to buy puts, which have become significantly overpriced relative

to calls at the same strike. The result is that one can now get a "synthetic" share of KNDI at a price in the mid 6's AND
get paid to hold it.


As I write, the bid on a synthetic share of KNDI, using the Jan. 15 $7.50 strike options is -1.00, which means that you
risk $6.50, have all of the upside, and GET $1.00 per share instead of paying for your shares. You need a margin
amount to cover the short put, but it does not need to be in cash. The immediate economics are even better if you use
the 15 strike (you get the use of $8.60 per share for 15 months), but I'm nervous about the put premium eroding to the
point where the put gets exercised and I have to exit the position. I am not sure that my concern in that regard is
justified, so I point out the opportunity for those who may understand the dynamics of options trading better than I do.


Anyway, it looks like a cheap way to monetize Mr. Pearson's FUD if you believe that KNDI is not going back down.

Someone once told me that it is quite difficult fighting with an unarmed person. Mr. Pearson qualifies as one who is
currently in a panic mode and doesn’t quite know how to handle his “at hand” dilemma. He attacks everyone in his
sight line, repeating his glowing style of gibberish endlessly, to provide a new episode of the “Seinfeld Show.” Yes, a
show about “nothing.” Mr. Pearson is an admitted short-seller who is currently taking a proverbial shellacking
regarding his position in Kandi. Without question he is in a very precarious position as his negative bet on Kandi is
“breaking bad, really bad.”


To quote myself, “So, goodbye short-sellers, negative authors and the like. Your honeymoon is about to end. May
what happened to the short-sellers and naysayers of Tesla (TSLA) experience a similar fate with Kandi.” Mr. Pearson,
this is my parting gift to you.


Currently I am looking at the trading of Kandi on my screen. He and his fellow shorts are putting all their efforts into
bringing the stock price of Kandi down. Actually there is one major short doing the heavy lifting. Mr. Pearson is
inconsequential. He is only the alter boy doing the bidding for his benefactors. It might work for part of one day but let
me be the first to say, “you’re done.” Fact: The subsidies for EV’s are approved and published by the Central
Government...you know what that means...enough said for the moment.


To you the reader: I will be submitting an article to SA, in the next day or so, to expose Mr. Pearson for who and what
he is. This comment section doesn’t provide me with ample space to address all the “factual” misrepresentations,
fallacious statements, etc., that Mr. Pearson has made in attempting to discredit Kandi. As far as trying to discredit
me, let me just say that I have broad shoulders. And, Mr. Pearson, if what you said in your article is all you’ve got, I
suggest you read mine…Hopefully it will be an enlightening experience for you, the Kandi investor, and those of you
in search of the “truth.” I will, in fact, respond to you Mr. Pearson, when my article is published; if you care to make
any comments. This, of course, will be a foreign exercise for you because it isn’t part of your documented repertoire.

You claim they are not a major player, yet they sold almost 4000 EV's last year while China as a whole only sold
about 12000. By my math that would mean they constitute 33% of the market. I would call that a major player!

OMG, "Art Porcari himself has now written 19 articles on Kandi and has never written an article focused on a single
other company. He is solely focused on this single stock. Mr. Porcari previously ran his own brokerage firm and his
financial involvement with Kandi and its management dates back roughly to its reverse merger more than 5 years
ago. In a previous article, I documented Mr. Porcari's regulatory violations where he misled investors by providing
inaccurate information to imply a "short squeeze" in order to inflate the value of a stock. I will leave it to readers to
determine for themselves if this is relevant to the present."  
This is a quote from your article! WHAT DID YOU JUST DO??? Did you not say you where short then wrote a article
to bring the stock down in your favor??? 
I sold my shares as soon as I seen your article! Why? Because I can not afford to lose money because of a BS article
on SA! I will buy them back today or tommorow! 
Iam looking forward to the pictures and the new article coming from Harris Goldman on Kandi! 
You wrote that Art Porcari only writes articles on Kandi, I would rather read and take advise from him who knows then
a auther that is a short, writing a story on a stock he is shorting!!

I like it when everyone's already all in because it means the supply of KNDI buyers is pretty well used up. Who's going
to be dumb enough to buy at the top of the cycle? Not as many as those who are smart enough to see that KNDI is a
serial pump and dump plaything and are cashing out their winnings even as we speak.

Good points, but I'm not convinced we don't have five people here with 6 accounts each. They even use the
same language. Funny how the pro-KNDI see this as a message board battle. When I'm long a stock and it
gets beat down for what I believe to be incorrect reasons, I see it as a gift - a chance to buy more on the
cheap. These people seem to be oblivious to the fact that if they are right it doesn't matter what the other side
says as the fundamentals will prevail.

Lawrence J. Kramer, Contributor
" When I'm long a stock and it gets beat down for what I believe to be incorrect reasons, I see it as a gift - a
chance to buy more on the cheap."


That is usually the right way to view an underpriced stock - I grabbed some ZLCS last night before the knee-
jerk crowd figures out that the 1:6 reverse split was totally benign - but I think there is a fear among KNDI
bulls that the stock may become so underpriced that someone - another company or the KNDI honchos - will
buy the whole company. At some point, the Chinese stakeholders may decide that the cost of US capital is
too high because of shorts' mischief. When that happens, they'll buy the company for a small premium, and
the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow will belong to them.


KNDI's pps appears to be manipulated regularly. That is a bad thing. It gives the stock a bush-league odor,
makes institutions wary, and creates unknown risks for investors. Thus, the value falls just because the value
fluctuates. When you come to buy my stock, I want you to offer what it's worth, not what some short has
caused it to be worth on the day you show up. If you can wait for a bargain, I have to jump whenever the price
is up rather than sell when I wish to be more liquid.


At the end of the day, longs benefit from the wide dissemination of accurate information. Traders benefit from
anomalies, but investors benefit from truth.

There are hundreds of KNDI longs who post comments on articles related to EV's. We do buy on dips! We do
not panic sell based on articles because we do understand that the incredible fundamentals of Kandi will
prevail -- and quite soon. Deliveries commence in Q4 and there are existing contracts for over 80K units
through 2014 in 6 cities. We don't want others to be scared out of a great investment by inaccurate or
misleading, incomplete information. Most of those who post here are experienced investors who recognize
that Kandi will probably be the best investment they every made.

After reading Mr. Pearson's article I impetuously sold 10% of KNDI. Then I read the comments and composed myself.
I went back and noticed Mr. Pearson is short the stock. I'm not going to sell any more of the stock. Who can you
believe anyway? Guess I'll have to make a trip to China with the proceeds from the stock I just sold.

Mr. Pearson, not sure why you are bashing a company that is far undervalued.


What you really missed it why the subsidies announcement did not 4x+ the stock price. The price should be in double
digits now, and the only reason it isn't is because of the huge volume of short sellers in the past 3 days. You just don't
know what you're talking about. Bashing other people is a clear indicator that you are out of your league.

What you'll eventually learn is that stocks don't trade on hype for very long. It might look undervalued to you
based on an announcement that China is giving their vast array of EV makes a subsidy but to people who
read financial statements KNDI is a friggin' disaster.

Gerald Klein, Contributor
Could please direct me to the financial statements that you are reading. I read the company's Form 10-K

you refer to. And by the way, what is a "friggin" disaster?

01 Oct 2013, 03:29 PM


frellgem
The recent debt build you are probably referring to is part of the transaction to fund the contribution to the
Geely JV. I expect the asset transfer to be complete before year end and the associated debt to be
extinguished by liquidating the Kandi subsidiary which was created to affect the asset transfer. Like most
high-growth, capital intensive companies, there is significant up-front investment (and associated debt).


In Kandi's case, the explosive revenues are only one-quarter away. They are adequately funded, have access
to both corporate and additional bank financing, and will reap enormous cash flow benefits from the
ADVANCE subsidy payments from the PRC directly to the company in Q4. Thousands of completed EV's are
lined up outside two of their manufacturing facilities in anticipation of 4th quarter delivery and payment.


And, like ALL high growth companies, they will raise money by equity financing at some point in the future.
Most likely well into the double-digit stock prices, in my opinion, although the shorts will be shrieking about it
much sooner. Like a broken clock, they will eventually be right.

Until then there is enormous upside in this stock in spite of its current balance sheet. The value in KNDI is in
the EXISTING contracts to deliver tens of thousands of cars in 6 cities, delivery of which was only waiting for
the release of subsidies. THAT's why the stock price jumped when the subsidy announcement came.

mikeasa- The S-3 that was filed a week ago last Friday, was not a "quick" S-3. It was an obligation that was
incurred in December 2010 with the attachment of warrants to the prior offering that was done at that time.
Ironically, while this small 1.2 million share warrant registration for 5.36 warrants became public knowledge on
the 20th with the stock at 6.70 prior to pearson's article, the stock traded 39 million shares at an average price
of 8.22 from that date until prior to Pearsons article. I would think that would be enough profit and volume to
absorb 1.2 million shares.


Also, Where Pearson was dead wrong in all three articles is in his statement that the company desperately
needed to do the June 29th $26 million financing. If you know how to read a 10Q filing, you will notice that the
proceeds from that financing was not realized by the Company until July 1, after the books closed for Q2, yet
during Q2, KNDI not only made the $23 million payment, it also made the $80 million Geely partnership
contribution, it increased inventory from $7 million to $17 million, and it increased "advances to supplier" by
an additional $25 million. All in reported Q2 BEFORE it received the cash from the financing.

I don't believe any of the bull articles ever said kandi would be the sole recipient of subsidies, however, that they
would benefit greatly from subsidies being released. With that said, Kandi is depicted as a long term winner because
of its position in relation to other Chinese EV companies. It has the strategic partnerships, patents and infrastructure
that other companies don't. Probably a reason why Geely decided to partner with them and not another company. In
addition, I think you misrepresent Kandi's capacity to manufacture these vehicles. They have two plants in china with
capacity to produce well over 100,000 vehicles. I'm not privy to Chevy or Nissans production facilities that create their
EV's but why does it matter? Kandi has room to scale up, and is a Chinese EV player in China receiving Chinese
subsidies...seems like a no brainer.

Sigh.... Of course there are many EV companies in China besides Kandi, but none of them have contracts in 6 cities,
or joint ventures with State Grid and Geely, or patented quick battery exchange, or a disruptive new form of urban
mass transit. Isn't the objective to distinguish from the competition with some technical or marketing or production
advantage? Well Kandi has ALL those advantages, plus time (everybody else has a lot of catching up to do)... which
you didn't mention. The competition you refer to had better design a side slide for their battery packs or find a lot of
consumers who have garages (or a lot of free time during the day to charge up). Most of Kandi's sales will be fleet
sales to rental garages and leasing companies for the next few years... although that consumer leasing program in
Hangzhou has over 6,000 people on the waiting list -- for KANDI's. Forgot to mention that again too! Maybe because
you're still not explaining the difference between our lease marketing and our rental program. Sigh....

Gdubw. Lets see. When Pearson wrote his prior attack article suggesting all sell and short the stock, it was
trading around 6.40. Had you listened to him and only sold your stock, it is likely you would not have received
more than that price. And if you really believed his message, you would not have bought it back. Worse yet, if
you shorted the stock and remained short. And of course if you believed him that the stock was a farce, why
would you have covered your short. After all, when he recommend the short, the outstanding short position
was under a million shares. And now it is 3.3 million so likely many did believe him.

But now, he has the audacity to claim he was "right" on the first article and all should have listened to him. In
spite of the fact just three months later the stock traded as high as 9.20 and was in the 7.70 area when this
article came out.


On top of the fact he would have cost you some serious profits (maybe serious losses if you shorted the stock
like many did), he calls you arrogant and insulting because you would not agree with him?


But then look at his track record:


Mostly hit pieces on small cap China companies. 
27 different companies. 
What else do these stocks have on common? 
Most are having a fantastic year. 
23 of those 27 stocks are up in the last 12 months some by 250%. 
Maybe it is time to start following Pearson's posts. He has a real knack for finding nuggets

Now that the stock is at $192/sh. I can only imagine that this person was fired from any job in finance and/or all of her

with MIIT approval and 1 Kandi JV EV with MIIT approval. Sales volume has always been low, as it has for all EV

manufacturers, but with the introduction of the new nationwide subsidies the floodgates are now open. Kandi is poised
to become the world leader in EV manufacturing and has the manufacturing facilities already producing.


Kandi has a moat which gives it an advantage over its competitors. The moat consists of its patents, and
infrastructure designed by Kandi but financed by others. Infrastructure is essential because plug-in charging is not
practical for most Chinese who live in apartments.


Kandi is in collaboration with the State Grid which has licensed Kandi's side-slide quick battery exchange system
(QBEX) which enables a 1 to 2 minute fill-up. The State Grid supplies electricity to 88% of China and has started the
build out of QBEX stations. The city of Hangzhou has a 20,000 EV EV lease program using only Kandi EVs which will
kick start the private adoption of EVs in the city. Agreements are in place to repeat this program in some other cities.


Further infrastructure support comes from a commercial expansion of the public transport system, currently in
Hangzhou but soon spreading to Shanghai and other cities. A company called ZZY (in which the Kandi JV has a 19%

only Kandi EVs fitted with QBEX and require between 5,000 and 10,000 in the next 12 months.


There is a lot more to tell but easier for me if you do your own due diligence - or just read the many detailed and
substantiated articles written by the very same SA authors maligned by Richard Pearson :)

HERE WE GO AGAIN! I post this all the time! Why do you not answer the questions people ask?? Why do you not
defend your article?? Last time with somebody else I compared it to a 4th graders book report that skimmed threw the
book and wrote a report on what he thought it meant, then could not answer the teachers questions! This time I
compare it to a whacko with a knife stabbing somebody! When ask why they don't know! OH that's right we know you
are a short!

viper- Once again. You are very observant. He doesn't respond because he has no defense of his comments.
His article is for one reason only. And that is to cause a quick downswell in a stocks price so he can cover.


I assure you, it was not his intention to see the stock only decline .14 yesterday. I doubt he covered and now
has shot his only bullet.

while there are indeed many companies that sell electric vehicles, only Kandi has a reference business model with
their name on it. No doubt Kandi is ahead of the gang in developing the right business model and securing the right
partnership with big industry player such as Geely and State Grid.


There are risks in any investment, do please do all your own due diligence by reading both the short and long articles.
Hopefully you can learn more from the useful ones with substantial information with references. Remember that no
one company has yet to bring the EV industry to mass market, but you can see that Kandi everything lined up to be
the one to move the EV industry into mass market.


from the quoted article (see the link below) - note that Kandi is Condi in most translations:


According to the State Council Development Research Center Enterprise Institute latest research shows that the
domestic electric vehicle market through exploration, has formed three business models for reference: Shenzhen
Putian finance lease model, Hefei Jianghuai directional buying patterns, Hangzhou Condi lease and exchange electric
mode.

If you don't want to read Mr Pearson's perspective, why, may I ask do you do it? You know his perspective is different
from yours so why don't you just seek out those authors that feed your opinion?


Oh, I forgot, bulls don't subscribe to the premise that doing the same thing over and over...I guess, who knows?
Maybe some day he will change because you have made it very clear that YOUR IDEA is the righteous and sacred
one...Obviously, you are all investment wizards in your own minds!

12795341 - Your use of the word "perspective", if all facts being presented are of equal value, is proper and
appreciated. When facts, however, are manipulated to lead a reader to a conclusion that is not truthful, it is
not proper and appreciated. IMO, there is only one way to differentiate the truth tellers from the manipulators
on a forum such as SA...Answer your critics! I, as an author here on SA, do my utmost to respond to my
critics. I feel that if SA permits me to publish here there also must be an accountability factor to the readers of
my articles. Mr. Pearson has chosen a different path. He won't respond to anyone!...Has he responded to
anyone here? You know the answer...NO! Perspective is not a word I would associate in describing a Mr.
Pearson article.


Regarding saying the same things over and over, Mr. Pearson has made that into an "art form." It doesn't add
anything to the discussion which, I think you must agree, never or hardly ever takes place after any of his
articles are published on SA. He just runs away. Why you might ask? And, how are his readers going to

determine if he is telling the truth? Just because one repeats himself over and over doesn't validate what is

in fact, you choose to respond.

Maybe the fact that longs outnumber shorts 30 to 1, that they're irrationally defensive about any perceived
criticism and unconvincable of anything, persuaded Pearson that it's a total waste of time to respond to your
comments.

I know you're not talking on behalf of Mr. Pearson. Your rationale may or may not be where the truth lies.
What we do know is that he hasn't even attempted to discuss his article with anyone here. If he feels that
everyone here is irrational shouldn't he at least give it a chance?

Mr. Goldman,


I have read your articles and find them to be very responsible from your particular perspective. I read the
short articles to give my thesis perspective and the long articles as well. I consider it due diligence for my
portfolio.


As most of the readers on SA tend to be investors the different insights tend to be enlightening or
confusing...If enlightening then possibly actionable...that brings on more research...if confusing, basically look
somewhere else for a profit center.


Often times different stocks offer opportunities from both directions as a trade item. There are definitely many
different directions one can take within the market...that is what makes a market!


Differing opinions keep the fires burning! Now I think I answered your question as to would I respond...My
question is still unanswered...If you are firm in your position why do you want to keep yourself upset and all

You, Mr. Mukticat (I assume that's your name), have stated how valuable your time is so I know it's unlikely
you have time to determine the difference between criticism and misstatements, misrepresentations, and
outright lies. Personally, I find misstatements, misrepresentations, and outright lies offensive. Obviously you
don't. As irrational as that may be, that's your choice.

Triple F -


Yes, you did respond, but I'm scratching my head trying to figure out why. You didn't address the central
premise of my comment to you; the discovery and presentation of the truth...Not innuendo, not misleading
statements, and or misrepresentations of the truth (lies). Your definition of perspective means nothing to me,
as an investor, if not substantiated by evidentiary facts. This apparently is of little value because your thesis, if
I understand it, is based on opportunity and not much more . But that's not the real truth is it? C'mon, fess up.
You're a short-seller. Your original post gave you away. So, after reading your reply, quite fuzzy in its content,
it is quite clear that your motivation in commenting was not to further substantive discussion as to this authors
honesty and accountability, but to, as you elegantly stated, "keep the fires burning!" I hope that sufficiently
answered your question.


I think you misread me too. And, so there is no misunderstanding, many have attempted to bait me who
possess substantially better skills than you do.... Nothing personal, just an observation. Remember, one can't
"get all worked up and upset" without one's permission. I haven't given it. My time is usually better served with
others whose purpose is more than just "fanning the flames."


Best wishes in your trading endeavors too....just not with Kandi.

any more than I did yours. I measured the posted data presented by each contributor and weighed that data
plus what I dug up by my own investing metrics.


My decision...what I normally come up with on ultra small cap companies...too much BS and not nearly
enough documented and measurable data (profits) or marketing plan to justify any action.


I also do not understand why I troubled myself to reply last time (or this time for that matter). I would suppose
at this point further blathering about by either of us would be a waste of perfectly good time and thought.

Mukticat
Oh don't you dare contradict the longs; they are proud as well as ignorant but vociferous.


If the Chinese have proven they can do one thing exceptionally well it's overproduce. From cellphones to solar panels
or cars, in fact you name it, they crush their own margins. Of course that's assuming there is any margin at all in EV's.
That's a highly doubtful proposition. Just look at the sheer amount of shareholder capital incinerated worldwide by
multiple failed attempts to launch EV's in the face of clear superiority of hybrids. Doubt this? They keep trying to
convince them otherwise but the consumer is the decider and the decider has spoken.


TSLA, btw, appears to have peaked and the descent begun. Many a premature obit has been written for TSLA so it's
still premature but bears watching. It will be very hard to keep the KNDI bubble inflated if the TSLA bubble is deflating.


We're running out of chairs.

Mukticat
TSLA begins to roll back down the mountain and it takes KNDI with it too or is this confusing coincidence with
causality? I lean toward the latter; KNDI wasn't going to sustain its gains but TSLA selling off can't help
matters either.


 
I'll add another prediction which I'm willing to guarantee 100% will come true (and I'll reference back to this
post when it does but if by some incredible inexplicable miracle I'm wrong I'll really eat some crow)-


Here it is - After KNDI is done unwinding itself back to the low 5's there will be a chorus of longs howling that
KNDI was never overvalued it was just undone by a secret cabal of nefarious shorts. 'The shorts did it' is
fundamental to the process by which longs avoid ever owning their amateur trading mistakes. Who needs the
buzz-kill of inconvenient facts when the kool-aide tastes so good?


03 Oct 2013, 10:46 PM


Stock_Viewer
@Mukticat, are you saying $TSLA can sustain its gains? It appears it is the case. The sentiment is high and
the stock can still retain its "cult" status withing a few weeks (6-8 weeks I'd say) and reach new highs, and
then roll back down to approx 150-160 levels. Thoughts?

Bull Shit! You were absolutely wrong a week ago and didn't own up to that. You never respond with evidence

I find you cutting and pasting your response to other people and using it as a response to me as offensive. Let
me try to summarize the pumpers response to Mr. Pearson's arguments:


1. Liar, liar, pants on fire. 
2. Pearson is trying to manipulate the stock. 
3. Pearson doesn't respond to comments. 
4. All critics of the stock ever have are lies, innuendo, misrepresentations and character attacks. 
5. The indisputable facts are the KNDI is on the cusp of a massive ramp in revenue and profitablilty.


Am I missing anything?
