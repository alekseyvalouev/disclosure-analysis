Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Services


In 2011, it was alleged that the Khulusi family took investor money from a related
company to inflate PCMI's financials.


Acquisitions boosted 2016 results and hid declining core growth. In the coming
quarters, we expect growth to decline as the eroding core reemerges.


The two largest recent acquisitions that are driving growth have been affiliated with
criminal activity.


In the first two months of this year, Chairman, Founder and CEO Frank Khulusi has
cashed in nearly all his options. Other major insiders are also selling.


PCMI is more expensive than it looks on the surface because management relies
on "adjusted" earnings that exclude operational expenses that should be included.
Shares appear to be ~40% overvalued.


Cliffside Research is pleased to announce a compelling short thesis on PCM, Inc.
(NASDAQ:NASDAQ:PCMI). We believe PCMI is currently overvalued by approximately
40%. For the entire 56-page "strong sell" thesis, please visit our website.

Summary


PCM, Inc. is a hardware, software and IT solutions company founded by current
Chairman and CEO Frank Khulusi in 1987. PCMI first caught our eye in September post
a 150% run in the stock on the back of growth from three acquisitions. Prior to recent
acquisitions, the company's core business was in decline. In fact, without acquisitions,
2015 revenue would have declined 4.8%. We expect negative growth to reemerge in
coming quarters now that the company has fully lapped large 2015 acquisitions.


Since PCMI remains primarily a simple reseller of hardware. This business has very low
barriers to entry and low margins. Reselling hardware is a notoriously cutthroat industry,
and we believe competitive pressure is only increasing in this space. Without growth,
the ability to improve margins appears limited. The company has shown an inability to
grow without acquisitions for several years.


The lapping of acquisition growth initially peaked our interest, but it was what we found
when we peeled back the onion that was truly disturbing.


We discovered a case from 2011 that alleged the Khulusi family took investor
money from a related company to boost PCMI's financials.


The company's recent acquisitions have been associated with several seedy
individuals involved in tax evasion and securities fraud including insider trading and
artificially inflating financial statements. These acquisitions have largely, if not
entirely, driven improved earnings results over the past year.


The CEO has significantly increased the sales of PCMI's stock. The last time he
sold in this quantity was in 2004/2005. At that time, the stock peaked and a
precipitous decline followed.

We believe investors are largely unaware of these concerns. The above factors,
combined with a pause in corporate buybacks, give us confidence that the run in
PCMI is nearing the end. In the following pages, we will detail the allegations made
against members of the Khulusi family, the unscrupulous history of the individuals
associated with PCMI's recent acquisitions and the increase in insider selling. We'll
conclude with a review of competitive struggles and valuation that anticipates
approximately 40% downside from current levels.

The Khulusi Clan Is Just The Beginning



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/24/47406777-14879885291886342_origin.png
Chairman and CEO Frank Khulusi has two brothers connected to PCMI. Sam Khulusi
founded the company with Frank, was a member of the board and the company's former
CFO. Sam and his brother Bassam Khulusi founded a software security company called
Eruces, Inc. in 1999. As recently as 2011, PCMI was licensing software from Eruces,
Inc. It's unclear what became of the software license between PCMI and Eruces after
2011 because we found no mention of it in SEC filings beyond that year. The primary
shareholders of Eruces were Frank, Sam and Bassam Khulusi. Current PCMI board
member Ronald Reck was a minority shareholder as well. That same year, case 2:11-
cv-02432 Muhl et al v. Eruces was filed in Kansas District Court.


The case alleged that Bassam Khulusi and Eruces CFO Robert Eckholt raised money
from investors by making false claims about Eruces' financial health and business
prospects. Among those claims were that Eruces had imminent deals in place with IBM
(IBM), Cisco (CSCO) and the US Department of Defense for their security software.
They allegedly claimed that due to the sensitive nature of the government contract that
they could not share specific operational and financial data details with investors. They
allegedly claimed that the sale of Eruces was imminent at a substantial profit and that
the money being raised would be used to support the company's growth. The plaintiffs
claimed they were assured the investment was safe because the wealthy Khulusi family
was backing it. For PCMI investors, what followed next is the most disturbing of all the
allegations. In 2011 PCMI was known as PC Mall.


The case alleged that the Khulusis took in money from investors for Eruces, and instead
of investing it, they used it to inflate the financial results for PCMI. The case was later
settled. As for Eruces, it appears to have been dissolved, but it's not quite dead. The
security software behind the company is in the process of being re-packaged by the
Khulusi clan into a new company called Cygure. They are currently looking for investors.

Acquired Growth


As we stated earlier, in 2015, PCMI made acquisitions that have been responsible for
driving improved results in recent quarters including En Pointe Technologies, Acrodex
and a division of Systemax (NYSE:SYX) called TigerDirect. En Pointe and TigerDirect
have been the two largest contributors to recent growth. Combined these acquisitions
added $371.2mil in revenue in 2015, and without the acquisitions, sales would have
declined for PCMI by 4.8%. In fact, without the acquisitions, revenue would have been
$1.29bil, which is close to the $1.2bil that PCMI first achieved in 2004. It's clear that
prior to acquisitions, this company was going backwards.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYX?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
As of the first quarter of 2017, the company has fully lapped these acquisitions, and we
believe this will lead to a substantial decline in revenue and profitability growth in the
coming quarters. It is even possible that without further acquisitions revenue and income
may decline since PCMI's core business was in decline at the time of the acquisitions
and the core business still represents at least 50% of the business post the acquisitions
and probably more.


The largest and likely the most important acquisition to the future of PCMI was En
Pointe Technologies in April of 2015. We believe that En Pointe was the most important
acquisition of the three because it was the largest acquisition in terms of revenue in the
company's history, and it increased its exposure to software and services. The software
component of En Pointe's business was particularly large and increased PCMI's percent
of revenue derived from software from 19% to 34% in the quarter following the
acquisition. In our opinion, the En Pointe acquisition was made out of desperation.
Below are the top five highlights from PCMI's own quarterly report in the quarter prior to
acquiring En Pointe. This is representative of what the core business was experiencing
prior to recent acquisitions.


Net sales: Decreased 9% to $296.0 million


Gross profit: Decreased 20% to $39.1 million


Gross profit margin: Decreased to 13.2% from 15.0%


Operating loss of $5.2 million in Q1 2015 vs. operating profit of $6.1 million in Q1
2014


Adjusted EBITDA: loss of $1.4 million vs. earnings of $8.9 million in Q1 2014


PCMI hadn't put up a quarter this bad with sales below $300mil since the first quarter of
2010. It was the lowest quarter for gross margin since the second quarter of 2011
(12.8%) and the first quarterly operating loss since the second quarter of 2005. It was in
2012 that the company began its long march to transitioning away from being regarded
as a reseller of hardware to an "IT solutions" and managed services provider, but three
years later, the strategy still hadn't taken shape. Things were not going well for the
company just prior to its acquisition spree.


Here are those same five highlights in the quarter post the En Pointe acquisition.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937941/000110465910026363/a10-9597_1ex99d1.htm
Net sales: Increased 43% to a record $478.9 million


Gross profit: Increased 29% to a record $62.0 million


Gross profit margin: Decreased to 12.9% from 14.3%


Operating profit: Decreased 78% to $0.9 million, including $5.4 million of one-time
charges


Adjusted EBITDA: Increased 42% to $9.5 million


It's clear that the acquisition of En Pointe has at least temporarily been a big shot in the
arm for PCMI's financial results. It's important for PCMI shareholders to know what it is
they purchased. We decided to take a closer look at the history of En Pointe and its
founder Mr. Attiazaz "Bob" Din and came away with serious concerns.


Mr. Din was the owner of En Pointe when he sold the company to PCMI in April of 2015,
so his direct and continued involvement with the company since its founding by him in
1993 to its sale in 2015 speaks to the quality of the assets PCMI acquired. The
importance of this cannot be overstated. The 2015 acquisitions have been the key
driver to revenue and profitability improvement for PCMI, and En Pointe is the
most important of the three.


What many investors in PCMI may not realize is that En Pointe was a public company
from 1996 to 2009. En Pointe went public at $8 per share, and at one point in 1999, the
stock was over $50 per share. In its heyday in '99, the company achieved peak revenue
of nearly $700mil (although it still managed to lose over $19mil), but ultimately post the
tech wreck, the company and the stock suffered, reaching a low of 80c per share before
Mr. Din took the company private for $14mil in '09. In its last full year as a public
company, En Pointe had $300mil in revenue, down from $347mil in 2007. Prior to
PCMI's acquisition of En Pointe, the company had $393mil in revenue for 2014, up from
$322mil in 2013. Essentially the same company that Mr. Din bought for $14mil, he sold
to PCMI for roughly $60mil, and the company hadn't grown very meaningfully from 2009
to 2015. Also, the fact that this is an old company that has had several up-and-down
years in terms of growth means investors in PCMI can't look at En Pointe as a young,
consistently growing company that is taking market share. It's closer to a cyclical that's
competing to survive just like most every other company in this space.

Do We Really Know What PCMI Acquired?


The company and its founder Mr. Din have a long history of affiliation with, and direct
involvement in, fraudulent activity and insider trading scandals. In July of 2016,
Attiazaz "Bob" Din and En Pointe Technologies paid $5.8mil to settle allegations
of fraud and violation of the False Claims Act by the US Department of Justice.
The case stemmed from a suit filed in July 2014 by Minburn Technology Group, a
service-disabled veteran-owned small business that sells IT products to the government.
In that case, Minburn Technology Group owner Anthony Colangelo alleged that an En
Pointe subsidiary called En Pointe Gov had been used as a front to win over 150 small
business set-aside deals worth over $48mil.


Between 2011 and 2014, Mr. Din and En Pointe made false representations that the
wholly-owned division, En Pointe Gov, met SBA requirements for eligibility of these
small set-aside government contracts even though En Pointe Technologies and its
affiliates, all owned by Mr. Din and his family, had about $300mil in annual revenues. A
firm of this size should have been excluded from winning set-aside deals meant for
smaller firms. In addition, from 2008 to 2015, En Pointe Gov filed false quarterly
reports and failed to report over 80% of sales to the government in an attempt to
skirt its contractual requirements to pay over $1mil in fees to the US General Services
Administration (GSA). US Attorney Eileen M. Decker said, "these companies
defrauded the government in two ways, each of which cost taxpayers."


This is just one of several lawsuits that have been filed against En Pointe and Mr. Din in
the past. In another case that took place around the time of the tech bubble, En Pointe,
Mr. Din and several affiliates were alleged to have committed securities fraud and
insider trading in a price manipulation scheme that involved now defunct boiler room
investment bank Hampton Porter.

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
In a highly detailed account of the alleged scam, Gregory Walker, John William
Laurienti, Mark Bergman and others at Hampton Porter orchestrated a pump and dump
scheme with Mr. Din, netting insiders millions in ill-gotten gains. At the time of the
alleged incident, the stock only had a float of 5.9mil shares and insiders controlled
3.1mil shares or about 52% of the stock. Prior to the "pump," Laurienti bought up shares
of the low float stock and Mr. Din allegedly agreed to limit insider sales. Then Hampton
Porter issued highly promotional research on En Pointe touting the ability of a wholly-
owned subsidiary within the company called Supply Access, Inc. to compete in the B2B
marketplace with Ariba, Commerce One and other large companies that they had no
business comparing themselves to. Mr. Din was allegedly quite involved with the
promotion of the stock. In broker meetings held in December of 1999, Mr. Din allegedly
told Hampton Porter brokers to compare En Pointe to Ariba and Commerce One
not only in terms of corporate structure, but also in terms of stock price potential.
At the time these stocks were Internet darlings.


In exchange for putting clients into En Pointe stock, the firm paid its brokers
commissions between 5% and 20% over standard commission rates. En Pointe
allegedly paid for the "kickback" commissions and clients were unaware of this
arrangement. If clients sold the stock within a predetermined period, the commissions
would be deducted from the brokers' paycheck. With the hype built around En Pointe's
newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary Supply Access, the stock took off.


In February of 2000, En Pointe completed an initial private placement for Supply Access
of 12 million shares and En Pointe's ownership in the subsidiary dropped, but was still a
majority interest at 54%. Then, April 4th, 2000, En Pointe completed a follow-on offering
which put its ownership interest in Supply Access below 50%. No longer in control of a
majority position, En Pointe began accounting for Supply Access under the equity
method of accounting. When this news was revealed, the stock cratered on heavy
volume.

Prior to the sell-manufacturersoff, Mr. Din was able to liquidate over 400k shares of
stock near all-time peak prices between $40.59 and $51.15 per share for gross
proceeds of approximately $18mil. According to court documents, the shares were sold
over roughly two weeks between February 28th and March 15th, 2000, and represented
61.5% of Mr. Din's ownership position at the time. Combined, En Pointe insiders sold
nearly 700k shares netting nearly $36mil in gross proceeds from late February to mid
March 2000. The case against En Pointe and Mr. Din was later settled for $1.8mil and
the defendants denied all alleged wrongdoing.


Executives of Hampton Porter weren't as lucky. After the tech wreck of 2000, the wheels
came off and the shop's fraudulent activity was exposed. Several of the executives
went to federal prison for exactly the same kind of stock manipulation that was alleged
to have taken place with En Pointe.


The cases we described above are just a few of several legal scrapes En Pointe had
been party to prior to its acquisition. Looking through its financials over the years, the
number of lawsuits seems high for such a small company. While in isolation one case
may not be significant, we believe that as a group, the involvement in several cases
involving fraud and deception from top to bottom of the organization speaks volumes
about the quality of the acquired assets.


Another Acquisition Props Up Revenue



http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1016/ENPT01/200675_r01n_010205.pdf

https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2003/June/03_crm_370.htm

http://www.metnews.com/articles/2013/laur100113.htm
Another major acquisition that took place very late in 2015 on December 1st of that year
was the sales force of Systemax's North American Technology Group, better known as
TigerDirect. PCMI paid $14mil for the TigerDirect B2B sales force and TigerDirect brand.
There were essentially no hard, tangible assets made in the purchase. This was a bolt-
on acquisition of a sales force with expertise in selling IT hardware. The late 2015
acquisition was a large contributor to 2016's revenue increase of 35%.


We believe the acquisition was primarily made to temporarily shore up the decline in IT
hardware sales that PCMI has been experiencing. Prior to the acquisition, the North
American Technology Group had produced $276mil in revenue for SYX in Q3 2015.
Assuming a decline of the business due to transition, cannibalization, attrition and the
exit of some product categories, it's still very easy to see that this acquisition could add
$100mil per quarter of low margin hardware sales and likely more. This is supposedly
the kind of business PCMI is trying to diversify away from. In 2016 PCMI's revenue
increased $589mil. According to our estimates, $389mil or 66% of the increase
was from hardware sales. It is likely that TigerDirect drove the vast majority of this
increase. Not only is PCMI still primarily a low margin, cyclical hardware business, but
also the core business ex-acquisitions appears to remain in decline.

(Software & Services includes software, delivered services and manufacturer service &
warranties as reported by PCMI. Hardware includes all other categories as reported by
PCMI).


We also found a Digital Trends article that discusses PCMI's acquisition of TigerDirect.
The author describes the acquisition as "an apparently affordable means of staying
relevant." The author goes on to state that "in a world where companies like Amazon
(AMZN) offer the same products with faster and cheaper shipping options, it's no
wonder PCM needs to find new ways to keep its business fresh." The article also
discusses the history of TigerDirect and much like En Pointe, it's not good. In fact, in
terms of legal concerns, TigerDirect makes the team at En Pointe look like
choirboys.


Carl and Gilbert Fiorentino are two brothers that founded TigerDirect in 1987 and sold it
to SYX in 1995. They were executives of the North American Technology Group of SYX.
Carl was president of TigerDirect, Gilbert was a director and CEO of SYX's Technology
Product Group. This is the division that PCMI just acquired in 2015.


In December of 2014, the Fiorentino brothers plead guilty to securities fraud, tax
evasion and commercial bribery in a scheme that netted them as much as $27mil.
Former US Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch who infamously met with former President
Bill Clinton on a Phoenix tarmac during Hillary Clinton's FBI investigation represented
the Eastern District of NY in the case.


The brothers took kickbacks and other benefits from TigerDirect's suppliers, typically in
the form of bags full of cash. In one exchange, $200,000 in gold coins was paid in a
Miami parking lot. They also were accused of stealing large amounts of computer and
electronic equipment from TigerDirect and recruited employees within the organization
to assist in the schemes and the cover up. Both men failed to report the income to the
IRS and caused SYX to file false statements with the SEC. The SEC accused SYX of
maintaining a weak internal accounting controls system. Gilbert was sentenced to five
years and Carl received six years in federal prison.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2012/comp-pr2012-190.pdf
It is impossible to know to what extent the fraud committed by the founders of
TigerDirect penetrated the organization. While it is clear they had help, it is possible that
members of the sales force were unaware of the crimes. The crimes were perpetrated
over several years and the amount of criminal activity that took place was very
extensive. Since employees of the company appear to have been involved, it's hard to
imagine that everyone involved with them has been discovered. This again speaks to
the assets that PCMI has acquired and we believe presents additional risk for the
company going forward.


It's Tried This Before


One of the reasons we doubt that PCMI will be able to sustain meaningful growth is
because it's had a history of acquiring companies that provide a burst of revenue and
earnings followed by stagnation. This also isn't the first time PCMI has attempted to
increase its exposure away from hardware towards more software and services via
acquisition. In September 2007, it purchased SARCOM for $55mil. Like En Pointe, this
was one of the largest acquisitions in the company's history, and it was highlighted as a
way for it to transition to a higher-margin IT solutions business.


Regarding SARCOM, Chairman and CEO Frank Khulusi said, "the acquisition is
representative of PC Mall's commitment to growth, and in addition to providing
SARCOM with the opportunity to leverage the efficiencies and scale of PC Mall, it also
provides PC Mall with an enhanced offering of IT solutions and services." Also like
En Pointe, SARCOM had strong growth at the time of the acquisition. 2006 sales for
SARCOM were $248mil and sales were up 23% in the first seven months of 2007 prior
to the acquisition. Khulusi stated that "the 23% growth experienced by SARCOM so far
this year is very strong."


SARCOM focused on "IT solutions" for mid-market enterprises (MMEs) and because
PCMI broke out MME revenue at the time we can get a pretty good feel for how
SARCOM performed. SARCOM was acquired in September 2007. That year PCMI's
MME sales increased 38% to $239mil "primarily due to the $67.2mil of net sales by
SARCOM" according to the company. In 2008, the first full year of SARCOM ownership,
MME revenue grew to $426mil, up 78% "primarily due to the inclusion of SARCOM."
Full-year sales for 2008 were $1.3bil so the MME division driven by SARCOM had
grown to represent a full 32% of PCMI revenue.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937941/000110465909017991/a09-7164_110k.htm
MME operating profitability also improved from $7.4mil in 2007 to $18.4mil in 2008
driven by the addition of SARCOM. The MME segment was by far the best performing
segment in 2008. Just as the stock has reacted to improved profitability via acquisitions
in 2016, the stock was quick to follow the improvements in 2007 and 2008 before the
market crashed post the housing bubble. During late 2008 and 2009, PCMI's revenue
took a hit along with everyone else, but after the smoke had cleared in 2010, SARCOM
was still suffering.


~PCMI 2010 10-K, pg. 43


The service revenue decline as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the
aforementioned growth in products sales, and a 17% decline in MME's SARCOM
branded professional and managed services in 2010 compared to 2009 resulting
from certain large service projects in 2009 that did not reoccur in 2010.


We're not saying that the SARCOM acquisition was a bad one. The point is simply that
once the company had lapped the revenue and profitability from SARCOM, growth
slowed and the stock plummeted. Just after the SARCOM acquisition in October 2007,
PCMI's stock reached nearly $20. The stock never fully recovered until recently on the
back of more acquisitions. As of now, PCMI once again finds itself in the position of
having lapped acquisitions, but this time the revenue and profitability contributions are
much larger. The lapping of acquisitions presents potential for even greater downside.

Insider Selling Increases, Buybacks Pause


When an insider buys, it is often assumed to be a bullish sign, but when they sell, it is
often said that investors shouldn't read too much into it. Selling can be due to other
reasons like tax gains or for personal needs that aren't related to a view on the
corporate outlook. What we try to look for instead is a pattern of increased selling from
several insiders or a change in selling behavior by key executives that can be more
telling. In the case of PCMI, we appear to have both. Over the course of the past year or
so, several insiders have been selling PCMI stock including CEO Frank Khulusi. Mr.
Khulusi has not only been selling shares in early 2017, but this also appears to be a
change in behavior in comparison to past years. In addition to increased insider sales,
the company stopped buying back stock starting in the third quarter.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/24/47406777-14879904505145032_origin.png
To be fair, Mr. Khulusi has always held a very large percentage of the total shares
outstanding. He and his family currently own approximately 25% of the company or over
2.4mil shares. What's changed in 2017 is that he's started to exercise his options
and is then immediately selling the shares. Also the amount of options he is
exercising and then selling is a large percentage of his total option holdings. It appears
he may be blowing out all exercisable options.


This is something he hasn't done in at least several years and certainly not in this kind of
volume. For example in 2014, the last year with any meaningful option activity, he
exercised options and then held the shares. As can be seen in this SEC Form 4 filing in
March of 2014, he exercised 397,500 options and there were no associated sales. At
that time he held a total of 619,900 options according to PCMI's 2014 DEF 14A filing. All
of the exercised option shares were later converted to the family trust.


According to PCMI's 2016 DEF 14A, the most recent on file, Mr. Khulusi held 473,500
options and 366,900 of them were exercisable. So far in January and February alone,
340,100 options have been exercised, but this time instead of holding the shares and
putting them in the family trust, they were immediately turned around and sold on the
open market at an average price of $23.01. This is the equivalent of 14% of his
current holdings. We see this as a change in behavior, and since it is the Chairman &
CEO who founded the company selling shares, it is a reason for concern in our opinion.

Post year-end results on 2/8/17 he began selling more shares, but this time, they were
sold out of the family trust. In another break from pattern, this is the first time since a
period in 2004-2005 that he's sold off shares in the family trust. That period was the
last time the stock reached current levels. During that period, the stock peaked near $25
per share in late 2004. By mid-2005, the stock reached a low of $4.25. So far in
February he has sold 104,855 at an average price of $27.20 from the family trust.
Combined with option share sales, he has already sold 444,955 shares worth nearly
$10.7mil. This is the equivalent of approximately 18% of his entire holdings sold in the
first two months of 2017. According to a recent 144 filing, Mr. Khulusi still has about 95k
shares he's looking to sell. More could follow.

Mr. Khulusi isn't the only insider selling in 2017. Simon Abuyounes, president of PCM
Logistics and brother-in-law to Mr. Khulusi, has also been a frequent seller of shares in
2017. All three independent directors including Thomas Maloof, Paul Heeschen and
Ronald Reck have sold shares in 2017.


In addition to the CEO, management and director sales, there have been several 5%
insiders of PCMI that have recently been selling shares. In the chart below, we included
shares held by Jonathan L. Kimerling, Firoz Lalji and Royce & Associates. Royce was
included primarily because it is the largest shareholder of PCMI stock outside of the
Khulusi family. Jon Kimerling was included because he has been a very long-term, vocal
holder of the shares and not only has he been selling, but he is now below the 5%
threshold for the first time since 2002. Firoz Lalji was included because he is the founder
and CEO of a competing company called Zones.


When Mr. Lalji first took his stake in PCMI he was very critical of the company and Mr.
Khulusi's compensation. In 2014 there was some speculation that Mr. Lalji might attempt
a takeover of PCMI when he reported a 5% position in the stock. Now that appears
unlikely since more recently he has been a seller. He has fallen below the 5% threshold
to a 3.9% stake in his most recent filing. It is possible that Mr. Kimerling and Mr. Lalji
have both continued selling post the last filing, but there is no way of telling since they
are both now below the 5% threshold.

When we consider the recent change in behavior and increased selling from CEO
Khulusi and combine that with increased selling from key 5% insiders, it appears that
those with the most to risk are better sellers at these levels than buyers. While it may be
possible for one individual to sell due to tax or personal issues unrelated to the
prospects of the company, it's much harder to make that assumption when there are
several large, likely unrelated insiders selling.


Competition Decides PCMI's Fate


We see the recent repositioning of the company away from an emphasis on hardware to
software & services as a desperate attempt to remain relevant as competition increases
from nearly every direction. The disposal of the consumer businesses in 2014
represents a good example of the competitive pressure PCMI is enduring. We believe
that similar to Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Circuit City and many others, Amazon was likely a
large factor in disrupting PCMI's consumer business. PCMI's consumer business was, in
a word, "Amazoned" in our opinion. Statistics clearly show that Internet traffic is
consistently consolidating to only the very top platforms. We believe this trend is unlikely
to reverse. Over 50% of all Internet traffic now goes through only 35 websites. While
AMZN has primarily been a wrecking ball for the retail industry, it appears that the next
area of focus is the B2B & B2G categories.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBY?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/the-expanding-consolidation-of-the-consumer-internet-3/
PCMI has refocused on B2B & B2G just when Amazon is beginning to attack this area.
In April of 2015, Amazon launched Amazon Business. Amazon's business is growing
rapidly, hitting $1bil in sales in its first year and growing 20% per month. Since PCMI
mainly targets small-to-medium sized businesses, it's likely that Amazon's consumer
business was already a huge competitive pressure to PCMI's hardware business. The
new Amazon Business portal will only add to the competitive pressure as price
transparency will ensure hardware margins stay thin. No wonder PCMI is trying to
transition to software and services as fast as it can. Unfortunately, try as it might, it can't
escape the fact that over half of its $2.34bil in revenue this year will be derived from
items that are sold on Amazon.


It is clear that the low margin hardware business remains the bulk of its operations at
approximately 62% of revenue, but the actual number is likely even higher. As you can
see in the above graphic, PCMI consistently displays in SEC filings the revenue it wants
to be known for, namely software, service and warranties revenue on a gross basis.
This artificially inflates its actual contribution to revenue because these sales are
reported on a net basis in its financial statements. It is unclear how much this distorts
the data.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/2/24/47406777-1487990943611879_origin.png
Keep in mind that this is based on Q4 2016 revenue. This revenue includes full
contribution from all three acquisitions made in 2015 that were intended to diversify the
business away from hardware and into software and IT services. The combined percent
contribution from software, services and warranties declined on a year-over-year basis
in Q4 to 38% from 40% last year. This implies that the largest contributor to growth
remains hardware and not the software, services and solutions that management
consistently highlights.


Direct Competitors Want to Eat The Same Pie


The intensely competitive environment in hardware and the shift to cloud computing has
increasingly forced PCMI's larger direct competitors to shift focus from reselling
hardware and into software & services. Just like PCMI, these competitors are
"reinventing" themselves as software, services and "IT solutions" providers even though
the majority of their business is reselling hardware. In our view, PCMI had no choice but
to follow their lead. With PCMI's competitors "diversifying" into the same categories as
PCMI at the same time, the likely outcome is not less competitive pressure, but more. It
appears PCMI is ill equipped to compete on price in this environment based on its
already low margins vs. other public competitors.

The chart above shows the economies of scale in this industry. CDW is by far the largest
player in the space, with nearly $14bil in revenue in 2016, or over 6x PCMI's revenue. It
also has by far the best margins. The bull case on PCMI would likely argue that as it
transitions to becoming more of a services and IT solutions provider, its margins should
improve. The assumption to this thesis is that it will have to catch up to others in the
industry by transitioning a percentage of revenue from hardware to software & services.
Based on our research, that's simply a false premise. Despite being the poorest
operator in the group with the lowest margins, PCMI's percentage of revenue from
software & services is comparable to both NSIT and CNXN, and it is much higher than
CDW. If anything, as CDW transitions its business to more software & services, it's the
rest of the group that should suffer and see increased margin pressure as competition
builds.

Another source of competition for PCMI and companies like them is the cloud. Although
management likes to tout its cloud offerings, it doesn't break out cloud as a percentage
of revenue on earnings calls or in SEC filings. We suspect that's because cloud is still a
very small part of its business. As more and more businesses, and in particular the
small to medium sized businesses (SMBs) that PCMI relies on, move software and
storage to the cloud the less on-premise hardware they need. Again, since it is primarily
a hardware driven company, this poses a significant threat.
The cloud also offers up an endless number of new competitive threats from new
companies that don't have hardware as a cost component of their business. These
companies won't have the same overhanging infrastructure, sales force and inventory
cost burdens that PCMI does. This might allow them to offer similar service at a reduced
price, further pressuring margins in the software & services category PCMI looks to
expand.


For example, PCMI is a Microsoft (MSFT) Licensing Solutions Partners (LSP). En
Pointe and Acrodex, two of the acquisitions PCMI made in 2015, are also Microsoft
LSPs. LSPs are the traditional way Microsoft has partnered with resellers to sell old-
fashioned perpetual software licenses. With the transition to the cloud in full swing,
Microsoft is pushing hard to catch up to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other cloud
players. As a result, it has deemphasized focus on volume perpetual software licenses
by cutting the fees. This is in part why PCMI bought En Pointe and Acrodex. The old
volume perpetual licensing model is dying. These companies are being forced to
consolidate to remain relevant while they attempt to transition to a more intensely
competitive cloud environment. These types of transitions are occurring industry wide.


Being an LSP used to be lucrative due to the lack of competition for big enterprise
licensing deals. But Microsoft is leveling the playing field with its Cloud Solution
Provider program, which opens the door for more partners to sell and provision
subscriptions to customers.


~Kevin McLaughlin, CRN


Rune Syversen, CEO of Crayon Group, one of the top 10 Microsoft LSPs worldwide
believes the number of traditional LSPs will eventually "go to zero." Microsoft
already slashed LSP fees for perpetual license sales by two-thirds and continues to chip
away at them. As the industry increasingly moves to the cloud, PCMI and companies
like it will see increased competition for cloud business and less demand for on-premise
hardware. This could prove to be a deadly combination for PCMI over time.


Evaluation of "Fluffed" Earnings



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

http://emerset.com/insights-and-resources/microsoft-enterprise-agreements/microsoft-licensing-solutions-partners/

http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300076134/sign-of-the-times-softwareone-acquires-compucoms-software-licensing-business.htm/pgno/0/1

https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/21/crayon_lsp_microsoft_enterprise_licensing_extinction/
While we always appreciate more information over less, we believe that increasingly
companies are using "adjusted" numbers to skew reality. We like to call these "fluffed"
earnings. This is a common ruse that many management teams cling to as explanation
for why earnings look poorer than they "really" are. There are two ways this is achieved.
In the past, management teams would back out what were truly "one-time" expenses
from earnings. Increasingly common operational expenses that are not truly "one-time"
in nature are making their way out of "adjusted" earnings. The other way they can skew
reality is by putting whatever expenses they choose in these categories. Since these are
"non-GAAP" adjustments, investors don't really know what expenses are being excluded
beyond management's broad description.


In our opinion one of the factors that has roped PCMI investors into the stock is
valuation. For 2016 PCMI reported "adjusted" earnings of $1.89 per share. PCMI
doesn't look like a terribly expensive stock, but it's not as cheap as it looks. We believe
investors are primarily valuing the company based on "adjusted" EPS and "adjusted"
EBITDA. We believe that is a mistake. The company backs out quite a bit of non-cash
and "one-time" expenses that in our opinion it should not. We will review these
adjustments and why they should not be part of "adjusted" earnings. The adjustments to
earnings that should not be included are the following:


Stock-based compensation


M&A related fees


Severance & restructuring related costs


Amortization of purchased intangibles


First, we'll look at stock-based comp. Even though GAAP requires it to be included in
expenses, many companies unjustifiably back it out. In our opinion, this is inappropriate
for two reasons. For one, issuing stock dilutes the shareholder base and that in turn
decreases EPS. In addition, backing stock-based comp out of expenses ignores an
obvious fact. Stock-based compensation is made in lieu of cash payments. We believe
that if stock-based comp was not provided to executives and directors, then they would
require additional cash payments. So stock-based comp is a real expense because it
substitutes payments with stock that otherwise would have been made with cash.
To put it another way, suppose all PCMI employees accepted only payment in stock and
no cash. Would that mean they have no employee expenses? Of course not, so how is
backing it out justified? Until recently, PCMI had actually been providing adjusted EPS
and adjusted EBITDA without backing out stock-based comp and for that we applaud it,
but in Q3, it began backing it out. One of the justifications for doing so was that
everyone else is doing it.


Given the recent significant increase in our stock price, we have determined that it is
best to measure our financial performance and report our adjusted results without
the impact of stock-based compensation, which has a greater impact for
additional grants at higher stock price levels. This exclusion is also consistent with
how certain of our peer group measure and report their performance.


~CEO Frank Khulusi, Q3 2016


In 2016 stock-based comp contributed 16c to "adjusted" earnings.


Next, we look at M&A related fees. If PCMI was a company that very rarely made
acquisitions, then perhaps backing out M&A related fees would make sense. PCMI
regularly makes acquisitions. Therefore, we believe they justifiably should be part of its
operational expenses. This expense should not be backed out of earnings, but it is on a
regular basis. This is especially egregious when you consider that without recent
acquisitions, revenue and earnings would have been in decline. Essentially it is
saying PCMI should get all the added benefits to earnings from acquisitions, but the
costs incurred as a result of these same acquisitions should be ignored. Don't be duped.
It considers acquisitions to be an element of its business strategy. How can these fees
be justifiably backed out of operations?


One element of our business strategy involves the potential expansion through
opportunistic acquisitions of businesses, assets, personnel or technologies that
allow us to complement our existing operations and expand our market coverage or
add new business capabilities.


~PCMI 2015 10-K


In 2016 M&A related fees contributed 10c to "adjusted" earnings.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4015474-pcms-pcmi-ceo-frank-khulusi-q3-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937941/000149315216008067/form10-k.htm
Next, we look at severance & restructuring related costs. The footnote in PCMI's Q4
2016 press release reveals that these costs "include employee severance related costs
related to our cost reduction initiatives, lease vacancy costs and other restructuring
related costs." Again, these appear to be basic operational costs that most companies
undergo over time. No reason to exclude them from earnings.


In 2016 severance & restructuring related costs contributed 20c to "adjusted" earnings.


Lastly, we exclude amortization of purchased intangibles from "adjusted" earnings.
Surely a non-cash expense for intangible assets should be added back to earnings!
Absolutely, if you are looking at valuation based on EBITDA. But they do something else
too. They add amortization of purchased intangibles back to "adjusted" EPS. That is not
the same thing. GAAP EPS commonly includes amortization of intangibles. It is one of
the reasons that P/Es are generally higher than EV/EBITDA multiples. Therefore, the
market has already taken this difference into account. PCMI doesn't need to do it for us
to make its "real" EPS look higher than GAAP EPS. As we have already established,
acquisitions are part of its business strategy. These expenses are not likely one-time in
nature, so they should not be excluded. Also, to exclude them ignores an important fact.
This non-cash expense represents actual cash paid at the time of acquisition. We
believe it absolutely should be a part of an EPS valuation.


In 2016 amortization of purchased intangibles contributed 47c to "adjusted" earnings.


The other contributors to "adjusted" earnings we agree should be included as true
adjustments to earnings. Those adjustments include:


Foreign exchange gain or loss


Write-off of ERP and CRM


Legal settlement gain


Why should these be included? First we'll look at foreign exchange. While currency
fluctuations are an ongoing regular income or expense, they are not under the control of
or based upon management decisions. In most cases the impact is small and it can be
either a gain or a loss. Generally speaking, there is no opportunity for management to
game the numbers with changes in FX. Therefore, we believe earnings should be
adjusted for changes to FX.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937941/000149315217001230/ex99-1.htm
Next we consider write-off of ERP and CRM. In some cases, there are legitimate
reasons to exclude "one-time" expenses from earnings. In our opinion, the write-off of
PCMI's ERP and CRM systems is legitimate. The reason for this is simple. In our
opinion, this truly is a one-time expense and not something we would expect to see the
company undergo again in the foreseeable future. That meets our standard for what is
actually a one-time expense.


Lastly, we consider legal settlement gains. Gains on legal settlement are generally not
something that companies regularly rely on to boost earnings. We looked through
PCMI's filings and didn't find any other examples of this. Therefore, we conclude this is
truly a one-time gain and should be excluded from earnings.


Combined these adjustments reduced earnings by 12c.


The net impact from these adjustments leaves us with $1.33 in EPS for 2016 compared
to PCMI's "adjusted" EPS of $1.89. Based on our adjustments PCMI is trading
approximately 21x earnings. This is significantly above its 10-year average trailing P/E
of 17x. To reach a 17x multiple on EPS of $1.33, the stock would need to trade down to
$22.61, representing over 20% of downside.

Regarding 2017, the company has guided Q1 revenue of $515-530mil and "adjusted"
EPS of 20-24c. For the full year, it guides to $2.34-2.38bil in revenue and "adjusted"
EPS of $2.00-2.15. What jumped out to us was the lack of anticipated growth expected
in 2017 vs. 2016 growth. As we've noted before, revenue and earnings in 2016 were
driven by the three acquisitions made in 2015. The company has now lapped those
acquisitions and those businesses have to contend with PCMI's eroding core hardware
business. Consequently, it is anticipating only 4-6% revenue growth for 2017. Again,
without acquisitions, 2015 revenue would have been down 4.8%. That represents
the third largest annual revenue drop going back to 1996. The other two were during
recessions. Prior to the 2015 acquisitions, PCMI's revenue was in a steady decline. We
believe larger competitors were eating its lunch. With the acquisitions behind it, we
expect the beatings to resume.

PCMI Fully Reflects "Fluffed" Guidance



http://investor.pcm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1011096
Regarding 2017 EPS guidance, we note that the company only provided "adjusted"
estimates. With the stock's recent 20% move, we feel the stock is now fully reflecting
"fluffed" guidance. We don't know what PCMI is expecting for GAAP earnings, but we
estimate actual GAAP earnings of $1.72-1.82 based on management guidance. This is
substantially below "fluffed" guidance. Based on this estimate, the stock is already
trading 15.4 to 16.3x EPS. But should we trust PCMI's guidance? The company has a
pretty awful track record when it comes to meeting guidance. We believe it misses
guidance as often as it beats it. Essentially, management doesn't have very good
visibility into the business. Investors appear to be giving it the benefit of the doubt on
2017 guidance because PCMI had large acquisition-driven beats in 2016. With the
acquisitions behind it, is PCMI more likely to beat or miss guidance? We looked back to
pre-acquisition guidance in 2013 and 2014 to see how the company performed vs.
expectations when it didn't have new acquisitions available to goose results. Our
findings are below.


PCMI Guidance vs. Reality


2013 Guidance Reality


Q4 Regarding revenue for Q1 2014: "So far
we're very much within the trend that we
talked about which is to exceed the industry
growth forecast that analysts have talked
about which is low to middle single digits and
our trend so far for Q1 have exceeded that in
December and they've also exceeded that so
far in Q1." ~CEO Khulusi


Q1 2014 revenue increased 0.6%, well below
industry growth. The company touted "record"
revenue.


2014 Guidance Reality


Q1 Regarding back half growth. "We will be
making strategic and significant additions in
headcount in our technical resources and
sales force, with a goal of accelerating our
sales growth as we go forward. These
investments should start contributing to such
growth in the latter part of this year." ~CEO
Khulusi


See below


Q2 "We also continue to expect that our sales Q3 revenue increased 0.1%. Blamed Q3 results

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2399295-pcms-pcmi-ceo-frank-khulusi-on-q2-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
growth in each of the third and fourth
quarters will be strong and our July demand
was consistent with that expectation." ~CEO
Khulusi


on two projects for $19.2mil that did not recur. Q4
revenue increased 0.6%. Blamed Q4 results on
$36mil reduction of business from three large
enterprise customers.


Q3 "We are currently targeting growth
accelerating in Q4, accelerating some more
to about mid-single digit in Q1, and
continuing the acceleration to double-digit
revenue growth beginning in the second
quarter of 2015. We are also targeting our
non-GAAP EBITDA margin to exceed 2.5%
by the fourth quarter of 2015." ~CEO Khulusi


As mentioned above, Q4 was only up .6%. Q1
2015 revenue declined 9%. This was the first time
they gave non-GAAP EBITDA margin guidance
for Q4 2015. In reality Q4 2015 non-GAAP
EBITDA margin was 1%.


Q4 "I've made significant investments in our field
sales resources and software sales teams.
While I expect such changes to be somewhat
disruptive to the first quarter results, I also
expect the benefit to quickly accrue into the
subsequent quarters of 2015 and beyond. To
that end, we continue to target double-digit
growth beginning in the second quarter and
our non-GAAP EBITDA margin to exceed
2.5% by the fourth quarter." ~President Jay
Miley


At this point the company had made no mention
of acquisitions in 2015. It appears guidance of
"double-digit growth" did not anticipate
acquisitions and was expected to be organic.
Revenue was down 9% in Q1. In Q2 they began
the 2015 acquisition spree. Ex-acquisitions full
year 2015 would have been down 4.8%. The Q4
2.5% EBITDA margin guidance was never
achieved. We believe acquisitions were made to
cover up significant declines in the core business.


2015 Guidance Reality


Q1 Guidance for non-GAAP EBITDA margin to
exceed 2.5% is dropped.


By the time they reported Q1, they had made the
acquisition of En Pointe. The first of three
acquisitions in 2015. Declining core growth should
be re-exposed in 2017.

So should 2017 guidance be trusted based on 2016 results? We don't think so. Not only
is the stock already reflecting a valuation that assumes guidance will be achieved, but
also in our view it reflects zero discount for what we've exposed.


Conclusion

We feel Q1 is the most dangerous time to be an investor in PCMI in nearly two years for
several reasons and seasonally Q1 is the weakest quarter of the year. On the
company's Q4 call, it stated that post the election business had returned to "normal."


It was a little bit of a low but then followed by a return to normal. I wouldn't say that
things improved from normal.


~CEO Frank Khulusi, Q4 Conference Call


That strikes us as downbeat for a company coming off its best year in history. We feel it
is likely that in Q1 companies will hold back on IT spend until they have more clarity on
President Trump's policies. This presents substantial risk to the quarter.


Beginning in Q1, the company has now lapped acquisitions from 2015 that boosted
results throughout 2016. Prior to these acquisitions, the core business was in decline as
the company appears to have struggled against larger, more established competitors.
With the acquisitions behind us, the deteriorating core business is more likely to
reemerge.


In our view, if the stock were to retrench by 20%, this would likely be just the beginning
in light of what's been revealed. PCMI is not well covered and it's unlikely analysts have
exposed the history of the company and its recent acquisitions to investors. Historically,
PCMI's stock has not accounted for this information in our opinion.


In addition, we believe that to invest in the company at current levels, you have to "drink
the Kool-Aid." The company is attempting to reposition investor perception of the
company to a company driven by services and "IT solutions." In our opinion, it is
downplaying how much of the business still relies on reselling hardware. This is a highly
competitive, low margin, cutthroat industry with very few barriers to entry. As we
mentioned earlier, over 60% of the company's revenue is still derived from hardware and
that percentage is increasing, not decreasing. The company continues to focus investor
attention on software and services, the smaller part of its business.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4044085-pcms-pcmi-ceo-frank-khulusi-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
PCMI is not in the business of building hardware or software. Primarily it simply resells
what others make. This makes it price taker, not price maker. As a result, it is very
difficult for it to improve gross margins because the company has little to zero pricing
power. We built a model that goes back to PCMI's beginning in 1994. In 2016 the gross
margin was 14.2%. The last time it achieved that percentage was before it was public in
1994 at 14.3%. Gross margins have been as low as 10.7% (2000). We do not believe
there is significant room for improvement on gross margins. In fact two of its
closest public competitors are Connection, Inc. and Insight Enterprises, Inc.. Gross
margins for CNXN and NSIT were 13.8% and 13.6%, respectively, in 2016. Both of
these companies are significantly larger than PCMI. In the case of NSIT, its revenue in
2016 was $5.5 billion, or more than double PCMI's revenue. We believe the risk for
gross margins is to the downside.


Regarding operating expenses, the company stated in its Q4 call that it expects 2017 to
be a year of "investment." We recall similar language in 2014 when the company
discussed significant increased hiring of sales and IT professionals. It didn't stop the
decline in the core business as we highlighted in the "Guidance vs. Reality" table above.
In our view, "investment" is code for increased operating costs and reduced earnings. It
may as well have said "don't get your hopes up."


In 2017, we are making some big bets in areas which we believe will contribute
healthily to our profitability in the long-term after an initial period of investment.


~President Jay Miley, Q4 Conference Call


So, I would say that exiting the year and into this year, we're in investment mode…


~CEO Frank Khulusi, Q4 Conference Call


On a question regarding additional cost savings that aren't baked into guidance, it
downplayed the benefit by stating that savings are likely to be redeployed in other areas.
This might be good news for the long term, but it doesn't provide upside in the short
term.


There are areas of opportunity where we will most likely redeploy resources from
areas that aren't providing us returns that we are happy with to areas that we believe
will provide better returns.

~President Jay Miley, Q4 Conference Call


Based on the discoveries we've laid out in this report, we believe a low-margin, low-
barrier-to-entry, highly-competitive price-taker industry such as this deserves a below-
market multiple. In addition a company that needs to acquire companies to grow
because it cannot grow organically deserves a depressed multiple. Two of the primary
acquisitions that are currently driving growth have been affiliated with illegal activities.
Therefore, we can only justify a 10x P/E multiple for PCMI on an estimate of $1.72-1.82
for 2017. We take the midpoint of this range for a price target of $17.70 per share
representing downside of approximately 40% from current levels. Our target
assumes PCMI will meet management guidance. We do not put much weight in
management's ability to predict financial results. If it is unable to at least meet guidance,
we would expect further downside to shares. Therefore, we believe our target is fully
justified.
