Silvercorp President Myles Gao's Recent Statement Contradicts The
Historical Size Of The Ying Mine
Jul. 5, 2012 8:05 AM ET59 comments
by: Alfred Little


On 4/18/12 Silvercorp Metals (NYSE: SVM) President & COO Myles Gao made a
presentation at the 2012 European Gold Forum in Zurich, Switzerland. I uploaded a
recording of the webcast of Mr. Gao's presentation to my Vimeo site (here). The webcast
was also archived by the European Gold Forum (here).


About four and a half minutes into the presentation, Mr. Gao reads from slide #6 that
"Silvercorp's strategy is to focus on generating cash flows early on by developing high
grade projects that may be too small for large companies and too large for junior
companies."


Mr. Gao then paused from reading the slides and gave an example of SVM's strategy he
recalled from his experience as SVM's Qualified Person on the Ying acquisition project in
2004:


For example, like you know, at the very beginning the Ying mine very small, only
have about, uh, less than 20 millions, uh, 2 million ounces of silver, and so
probably is too, you know, too [inaudible], too, too, too small for like, uh, the big
companies, but, uh, for large [inaudible] for the uh small companies maybe you
know, uh, it's probably too, too, you know, too hard to develop, so Silvercorp had that
property and they fast developed it to a mine. [emphasis added]


Mr. Gao's recollection of the small size of the Ying silver resource is troubling. What did he
mean when he said "less than 20 millions, uh, 2 million ounces of silver?" Personally, after
listening to the recording many times I think he meant 2 million ounces of silver.
Regardless, as I will show below either figure should be problematic for SVM investors.


On 4/26/04 SVM (then called "SKN Resources") issued a press release (archived here)
announcing it had signed a final cooperative joint venture contract acquiring a 70%
interest in the Ying project. In the press release, SVM disclosed for the first time the
following table of Ying (or "SGX") silver resource estimates:

5/18/2018 Silvercorp President Myles Gao's Recent Statement Contradicts The Historical Size Of The Ying Mine - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (NYSE:SV…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/703021-silvercorp-president-myles-gaos-recent-statement-contradicts-the-historical-size-of-the-ying-mine 2/18


Combining the indicated and inferred silver resources of 8,359,713 and 52,663,286 from
the table results in 61,022,999 total ounces of silver.


So regardless of whether you believe Myles Gao meant 20 million or 2 million
ounces of silver, both are a far cry from the 61 million ounces of silver first
disclosed by SVM at the very beginning on 4/26/04.


There are, of course, a number of possible explanations for Myles Gao's questionable
statement:


1. Myles simply misspoke. He meant to say 61 million ounces of silver.
2. Myles really meant 20 million ounces and the 61 million ounces originally reported was


a 3x exaggeration.
3. Myles really meant 2 million ounces and the 61 million ounces originally reported was


a 30x exaggeration.
4. Myles might explain that resource estimates are all really "apples and oranges" such


that 61 million, 20 million, and 2 million are all somehow correct.


More than likely, SVM will simply advise investors to continue to ignore the "short and
distort" conspiracy. Maybe SVM will announce the belated repurchase of a few more
shares using the mountain of cash reported on its balance sheet. Or better yet, overpay
for a few more acquisitions in China before the Ying mine is depleted.


Whatever SVM responds, it will not stop us from fulfilling our new mission
(announced 12/19/11 here) to expose fraud, corruption and other crimes committed by a
small group of U.S. listed Chinese companies whose management utilize threats, false
arrests, violent force, kidnappings, corruption of foreign officials and abuse of the legal
system to silence their critics and deprive them of their right of free speech and expression
of their investment opinions.


Since 12/19/11, we have experienced great success in fulfilling our new mission and have
received well deserved recognition for our past work exposing Chinese stock fraud:


1. On 12/20/11, a Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") request for records on Deer
Consumer Products (NASDAQ: DEER) and its management and directors was denied by
the SEC because specific or contemplated law enforcement proceedings against DEER

Comments (59)


were either pending or prospective.


2. On 1/26/12 FBI agents raided the headquarters of DEER's former advisor Benjamin
Wey (New York Times article can be found here). I first exposed the massive fraud
conducted by DEER in report (here) published in March 2011.


3. On 2/22/12 the SEC charged Puda Coal (formerly NYSE Amex: PUDA) Chairman Ming
Zhao with fraud (link here), confirming each of the allegations in my report (here)
published on A*L on 4/8/11.


4. On 4/23/12 the SEC charged SinoTech Energy (formerly NASDAQ: CTE) and its
Chairman with fraud (link here). I was the first to blow the whistle exposing the massive
fraud at CTE in an A*L report titled "SinoTech Energy: Enhanced Oil Recovery or Capital
Extraction" (here) published on A*L on 8/16/11.


5. On 5/14/12 the SEC charged China Natural Gas (formerly NASDAQ: CHNG) and its
Chairman Qinan Ji with fraud (link here). I was the first to blow the whistle on CHNG's
fraud in a report (archived here).


6. Then on 5/21/12 the NASDAQ halted trading of SinoClean Energy (SCEI). I first blew
the whistle on SCEI's fraud in a report (here) published on A*L on 4/28/11. I explained the
reason NASDAQ halted SCEI in a report (here) published on A*L on 5/22/12.


I am confident that my chain of success will only grow stronger as I continue to speak the
truth and seek justice on behalf of investors (both long and short) harmed by U.S. listed
Chinese companies that try to silence their critics.


Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours.

Ha, I guess it takes a fraudster to expose fraud.


Nothing but more allegations and trying to benefit his short hedge fund friends.


Oooh, he really got them this time. Someone misspoke off the top of his head the size of one of the mines. What a
crime. Must be fraud somewhere, right?

It's not like a mine might be thought to be very small at first, and could later be further developed to include more
resources / reserves.


What a fool.

Attacking some broken english about 2004 numbers is pretty weak. Why didn't you just ask SVM for clarification?
What about some responsive comments on the recent 43-101s and audited results?


SVM has produced audited financials, updated independent resource estimates and continues to produce the cash. I
will always side with those that produce the cash rather than those that produce hot air.

Does anyone even take any notice of Alfred Little any more? They've been well exposed for being a sheister short
and distort outfit.  
The above looks like a final desperate attempt to mislead shareholders into selling. So, Alfred Little, how many shares
are you or your douche bag hedge fund friends short this time?  
I hope justice catches up with you all wherever you are....

And what does the recollection of the size of the mine in 2004 have to do with the current resource estimate
and the cashflow to be generated therefrom? Why haven't you commented on the independent refutations of
your allegations, being the audited financials and resource estimate? Or are you saving that for court?


05 Jul 2012, 11:26 AM


davidshelton
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight! So this whole charade is about someone stumbling in a language that is not his own about
something that happened in 2004. You people are truly lame.  
Care to offer a reason why you skulk behind anonymity? or is that to protect the "innocent" on your brave
"new mission" announced 12/19/11? I guess you have to try and take wild potshots at Chinese companies so
you and your (hedge fund) cronies can reap the rewards at the expense of shareholders like me.  
Your prior campaign against SVM lacked any real credibility and was full of wild unsubstantiated claims and
absurdities and now you're grasping at straws. Bring some real dirt on SVM to the table and prove to me that
you're not just another group of fraudulent, low-life profiteers. 
Above all else, my profile name is my real name and I stand by what I say unlike you losers.....

A.L.,


Not to mention all the cash (audited) on Silvercorp's balance sheet, how could they have purchased and
retired approximately $20MM in common shares and distributed over $25MM in dividends to shareholders if
Ying only had 2 million ounces of silver?? And in case you haven't noticed, Ying has produced over 20 million
ounces of silver since 2004...so the basis for your "conspiracy theory" is a bit weak.


Frankly, the real question I'd like to hear an answer to is....."How much does "Arthur Little" or their
affiliates/partners realize from talking down Silvercorp's stock price?? How about disclosing "Arthur Little's"
direct/indirect short position in Silvercorp? You clearly shouldn't have an issue doing this since you proclaim to
exist to help shareholders. So, when is the disclosure coming A.L.??

"...U.S. listed Chinese companies..." For starters, even though the bulk of their business IS in China, they are in fact
based in Canada. If you can't even get something that basic right, what else are you missing? 
Never expect a lot from a "Little".

Author’s reply »  So none of you think it matters whether the Ying mine was really 61M or 2M ounces at the
beginning? I think its critical and definitely not something Myles should forget, unless his recollection of 2M was the
truth.

How do you know he was even talking about 2004 when he said "at the very beginning" of the Ying Mine, or whether
he was actually talking about both inferred and indicated resources?


Resource estimation is not an exact science and can change very quickly depending on the type of modeling used.
Case in point is that the most recently released information on another one of their mines (Silvertip in Canada) said
"Contained metals in the Inferred category increased by 146% for silver, 126% for lead and 88% for zinc in
comparison to the 2011 resource estimates", but I suppose that's just another fraudulent project as well.


Your "analysis" is so full of holes you should start your own mining company instead.


05 Jul 2012, 01:44 PM

I wont rip you without analyzing your thesis first. 
and I did look at your documents and compared them.


You STILL MAKE THE ROOKIE NEWBIE MISTAKE THOUGH. 
AFTER near 1 year YOU STILL make the same mistake or is this intentional.


I will explain.


http://bit.ly/N1xyad


total 95 million of all the mines assessed.


alfred is really ignorant of how mining industry works. 
kinda oblivious. and obvious.


he needs to google what is


proven  
probable 
measured  
indicated 
inferred


means in the mining industry  
before even talking.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/703021-silvercorp-president-myles-gaos-recent-statement-contradicts-the-historical-size-of-the-ying-mine 9/18


in the slides he showed 
http://bit.ly/PkFcR7,


and pdf 
http://bit.ly/N1xyXQ


at the 8 min mark


gao did in fact mis-spoke to a small degree but he was trying to ADD


indicated and measured together. 
comparing 2005-2012.


he NEVER ONCE MENTIONED inferred during the mis-spoken part that.


so he is comparing inferred with? like wtf alfred little you little scam artist dont even know the difference and hope
your readers don't know as well?


as the report says inferred at certain mines are like 95 million now.


in the report of course total inferred is about 145 million for all mines. 
of course they will be moved around to indicated measured then probable and proven.


shall i describe what inferred does?


they usually get moved around into the indicated section and then measured and proven probable sections.


because I already said this time and time again it is inferred there are 5 buckets. once it is proven probable they mine
it and it becomes proven and taken off as well because they mined it.


alfred has no clue what he is talking about.


alfred stop grasping at straws maybe alfred should take a pot shot at their canadian company nux.to run by the same
people and owned by svm as well.


but is operating in canada is that too hard for alfred though? or would alfred be accused of financial terrorism against
canada if alfred did that.


wait alfred only have agents in china because of their dirt cheap labor. my bad.


but nice calls on some of them but they are moving up now better keep shorting them.


but is alfred doing this like Johnathan Lebed a known pump and dumper in reverse? Peter schiff commented on their
acts in the NIA, since they were defrauding good people, supporters of Ron Paul and those awake to the corruption of
government.


alfred gave some good tips on reverse mergers and then pull the rug from under supporters to make it less obvious,
well sure seems that way.


and ps go investigate nux.to then alfred might have some more luck there. it is closer to home anyway alfred can go
himself instead of china. they are in canada so they have authorities to protect alfred dont worry.

well since Canada is safer go investigate closer to home. well go ahead do it already it has been almost 1 year and
this is all you have? geez.


and alfred still dont know what the difference between  
the 5 categories?


proven 
probable 
measured 
indicated 
inferred


well this ends my analysis of your post of bad journalism.


05 Jul 2012, 02:46 PM


geo8211
now i shall also add if I remember correctly svm did not own the whole mine during that time as time went on and
profits came in they had the choice of buying up the rest of the mine.


if you could find out how much share of the mines they owned during that time we could calculate more accurately.


05 Jul 2012, 02:57 PM


geo8211
oh yes noticed something on the slides go back to 8 min and look at the slides carefully


sept 2007 they ADDED the HPG resource at that point and the resource estimate jumped about 40 million oz for their
projections.


if you read between the lines. 
the 43-101 for hpg in 2003-2004 was not added yet. apparently.


so the 60 million? estimated


some were likely mined and sold. then they had less for those 2-3 years.


but as always you always leave out important details.


remember this you have to do the estimate around the time they add the resource and not before then.

"It's taking them far to long to explain this".


Really? And I suppose you personally brought it to their attention and tried to get an explanation from them
before posting it here on this site? You would never just throw it out there first for effect, would you?  
Let's see some proof and some real counter arguments before you and the likes of Chris Wu disappear again

Oh come on jon carnes.  
SVM doesn't need to address since it was you whom heard wrong and had the dates wrong.


I already pointed out he said twen twenty million  
not two. Your ears may be playing tricks on you. Other people can listen as well and testify.


But you have been ignoring me and causing me to over post. 
go to your own video and 8 min as well and listen.


Also refer back to HPG mines being added at year 2007 not before. 
your analysis is wrong can you just admit you got it wrong like a man.


your deer/scei analysis could be or not correct I do not know as deer/scei transparency is lacking imo scei is
likely a fraud.


talk about wendy fu about how she was in 2 Chinese fraud companies as financial operator instead. I gave
you some fuel to investigate right there.

the management and their past and ways of doing things is important. Ben Wey I agree is corrupt as he
promotes companies to bribe government outright in an interview with no shame. Following his companies
would likely yield some results.


But anyway SVM has no need to explain this we already did and quite easily.


Issue an apology and move on you are spending way too much time bashing SVM when you could be
exposing real frauds.


If you really want to go after SVM then you'd best hire a geologist at the bare min they can asses the
information better and tell you if the properties actually have any silver.


I seriously doubt you even understand the geology data presented.


Stop being CHEAP you need a geologist to investigate if you want the real data and meaning. Then you can
argue with real data rather than questionable data you think you know.


Anyway tell your wall street friends to back off already. You know you got it wrong.


Just man up.

You are full of crap AL. What is there for SVM to explain? A "quote" from mining presentation. Have YOU ever looked
at SVM's SEDAR documents?


Years of Cash flow and PAID dividends? Published bank accounts and audited and again audited financials? And
now, SVM is fixing it's weakest links by providing INDEPENDENT 43-101'S. SVM is also diversifying it's mining base
to 3 Chinese provinces and Canada. Oh by the way, SVM is NOT a chinese RTO it is Canadian and it's CEO is
Canadian as well. Mining is a very tough business but SVM is doing pretty darn good and is way undervalued.

Have SA lost all standards? How is this 'writer' allowed post this rubbish. I thought the attack last year was baseless
and clueless and this one is even worse. Should they not have been checking rocks from the side of the road as
opposed to inferring fraud from presentations? The sooner they are named and shamed the better.

alfred little I already cleared the remark 8 min is the time on the slide show


and it was really you making the mistake.


06 Jul 2012, 11:23 AM


geo8211
ah yes shall i mention svm already wasted 9-11 million dollars wasting their time on you if you read their financial
statements correctly.


I wonder if alfred aim is not to waste more of their time and money on these stupid arguments.


alfred is acting like a child right now. and also it is very bankster like which I dislike.


Also an article on carson block on oriental paper proves he is also a fraud.


read this seeking alpha article on oriental paper and many of their witnesses being frauds themselves.


http://seekingalpha.co...


well anything to say. your group has been exposed. just because some were correct while some were also bad
journalism does the excuse the fact you shoot first to profit. your group are frauds just as well.


also we know there is corruption in china that goes without saying.


but there is also major corruption here in the states and the city of london for that matter.


heard of LIBOR the major frauds or MF global why are you not going after the major crimes? I wonder really.


in the mean time you deal with small fish because it is easy. I wonder if you are not part of the group defrauding the
world right now.

here is another article about oriental paper.  
and muddy waters I dug up.


apparently muddy waters himself was operating frauds himself at the time.


so please. everyone must do their own research rather than listen to these scam artists.

chinese or not. just do your own research and do not trust anyone on the market.


even if zerohedge recommends them lots of them have become sheeple as well to these people. judge for yourself by
the content


not by the sensation it generates. use logic.


look at the documents themselves and for gods sakes google the terms and practices within the industry.


with the internet now you'd think alfred at least do that.


06 Jul 2012, 01:30 PM


geo8211
but also if you read carefully in the blogs about oriental paper later on muddy waters later changed their filings of the
reasons why oriental paper was a fraud. then they eventually got it right.


some commented that they had their website change their reasons as well and documents. which means they got the
fraud excuse later on.


but they initiated the fraud allegations first despite the fact they had it wrong at first.


IMO they got lucky then.


but that just means oriental paper was partially a fraud.


HRBN probably also had partially dirty secrets that they did not want out. but was not a total fraud as well.


imo most companies likely have a dirty past. including usa companies like jpm xom and you name it all of them have
some fraud going on. government backed of course.


but hrbn case they bought out their whole company instead of dealing with them in court.


imo that should happen more often than not.


but alfred try harder. maybe you can find some real dirt next time.

yes i went to your website again to see what you are up to.


also look at this  
stock symbol carson block was targeting it dropped a bit  
FSIN  
and someone is now buying them out completely with cash


what does this tell you? they dont want to deal with your bs statements anymore. it's costing them more time and
money than dealing with the fraud market that is 90% dominated by


naked shorts and HFT or over leveraged banks

and if you dont agree they are frauds you yourself are a fraud.


lets just say your group and types are trying to milk the system, I


don't trust your group nor anyone with investments


I encourage others to do their own research rather than be a sheeple and follow blindly those that stand to make
profits off of their backs.


your supporters are kinda sheepish imo. they probably do not read what you publish and take your word for it. hence
they dont even know what's going on. the essence of sheep.


PS i did google translate for the articles that were in chinese as well. and found well you saying rui bragged but kinda
not the case.


and you arguing that everything was not addressed when it was already. I REMEMBER CLEARLY.


don't deny that it was addressed so that others waste their time dealing with you again.


a pro scammer always gives people some correct info and some bad info.


so that the good info can be said to support his claims.


For deer I actually agree with you alfred that their accounts receivables are questionable.


Why? because late a/r are dangerous. in accounting standards after a certain amount of time it will become worthless
and uncollectable like bad loans aka the bankster problem of foreclosures.


as for puda and others i can see some as well but not everything of course.


you have many holes in your arguments still. IMO deer should have just went private maybe they are waiting for
better prices from your shorting.


all companies that you are targeting should all go private if they can.


it is a total waste of money arguing you anyway.


ps. you are quite lucky for the fact silver is manipulated downward as well.


so you are not saved by your short position by your article but for the fact the banks already wanted to short the
industry anyway.


but good day and please come out with better journalism next time. your arguments are very weak and you still have
not responded to so many of my comments.


which have refuted your arguments already.


last time many of us have also refuted your arguments with good evidence as well. but you clearly said nothing.

this will be my last posting since you clearly do not want to address my comments.

which proves you are a coward.


and i believe you are actually part of the type of banking banksters that are defrauding the american and the world
with the libor scandal.


which btw is 100x more important than your chinese research.


but I assume those big fish are too big for you as you would be killed trying to uncover those secrets and you have
proved yourself unable to do research outside of china.


nux.to for your obsession about svm right now.


GO INVESTIGATE IT ALREADY.


it is based in canada.  
should be 100x more easy.


geez I dont hear anything from you regarding that and it's been 1 year already.


you are so lucky the banksters are intentionally attacking miners else you would be underwater you know.


good bye.

July 13 NY Times article has some info on fight between SVM and Alfred Little, who is known as Jon Carnes. The link
is http://nyti.ms/M66NlU

Hopefully Chinese authorities improve this problem of transparency so it can't be further exploited by those who seek
to profit via dishonesty. That goes for the companies and as well as the likes of Jon Carnes aka Alfred Little....

Unfortunately there are too many state-owned enterprises which tend to be very bureaucratic and corrupt
hence non-transparent like anywhere else

Exactly! 
Some excerpts from the article you mention : 
http://bloom.bg/MpByCI


[Silvercorp Wins Dismissal of Counterclaim Over Website


........ 


........ 
Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM), a Canadian miner of silver in China, won dismissal of a counterclaim by a
hedge fund that wrote a report posted on a website the company accused of spreading false information.


New York State Supreme Court Judge Carol R. Edmead today rejected Anthion Management LLC’s claim
that it was entitled to damages under state laws designed to protect citizens who publicly challenge
applications by businesses for permits, leases and licenses.


Anthion, based in New York, argued that Vancouver-based Silvercorp sued the website,
Chinastockwatch.com, as part of a campaign to “retaliate against, intimidate and deter” criticism of the
company.


......... 


.......


Silvercorp sued Chinastockwatch.com and Alfredlittle.com and their operators in September, accusing the
sites of publishing false information to lower the company’s share price and profit on short sales. In a short
sale, an investor sells borrowed shares, hoping to return them to the lender after buying the stock back at a
lower price.


Anthion in March filed a countersuit identifying itself as the author of an anonymous report on Silvercorp that
was sent to securities regulators, auditors and journalists and later published on Chinastockwatch.com. ]


Yeyyyyyyyyyyyy!

Good news! I hope they're taken for all their worth.... 
Care to comment Alfred Little, Jon Carnes, Chris W. or whoever you are? You're lack of responsiveness to
date to the comments above and your weak arguments thus far have already spoken volumes about your
integrity and motives. Time to look for another occupation in life.....

Hey, give him a break, he's busy defending himself in court, I'm surprised he even found the time to write this
desperate article.


Judge: "How do you plead?" 
Mr. Carnes: "Like you know, at the very beginning..only have about, uh, guilty, uh, I mean not guilty." 
Judge: "Too late, you already incriminated yourself." 
Mr. Carnes: "Nooooo, the tables have turned!"
