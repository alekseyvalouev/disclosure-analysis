HIIQ: Boiler Rooms, ‘Worthless’
Policies, and Defrauded

NOVEMBER 27, 2018 | HIIQ


“The reason we outperform the ACA guys [traditional health insurers]
so dramatically is because we have such high levels of compliance
and consumer satisfaction”

We are short Health Insurance Innovations (NASDAQ: HIIQ) because
we believe the company’s business model relies on a classic boiler
room scam. Previously sealed documents gathered by the FTC
directly undermine management’s claims and prove that a large
boiler room operation recently shuttered by the government for a
massive alleged fraud was responsible for roughly half of HIIQ’s
sales. Evidence also suggests that HIIQ policies have been
contaminated by insurance fraud and reveal that other HIIQ brokers
prey on consumers with falsehoods. Now that multiple state and
federal agencies have begun moving against HIIQ’s broker network,
we believe it is now a question of when, not if, HIIQ’s business will
implode.


Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) shut down
boiler rooms selling HIIQ policies run by Steve Dorfman, alleging they
were “permeated by fraud” and selling “worthless plans that left tens
of thousands of people uninsured”. Soon afterwards, HIIQ put out a
misleading press release, suggesting that Dorfman was responsible
for less than 10% of HIIQ’s business.  But previously unpublished
bank records reveal that HIIQ has paid at least $145 million in cash to
Dorfman’s companies, representing about half of the third party

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-boiler-rooms-worthless-policies-and-defrauded-families/ 3/16


commissions paid out by HIIQ over this approximate period.  We
therefore conclude that Dorfman’s alleged fraud has been
responsible for as much as half of HIIQ’s revenues. (Note: a lawyer
for Mr. Dorfman told the New York Times that his client “vigorously
denies the allegations of misconduct”.)


Even after allegations regarding deceptive sales practices of HIIQ
brokers mounted last year, HIIQ continued doing business with
Dorfman, who allegedly is a�liated with a violent gang of criminals
that he used to indimidate employees.  The nexus between HIIQ and
Dorfman is so close that Dorfman’s company was previously
considered a related party in HIIQ’s SEC �lings and documents show
that licensed HIIQ insurance agents, including Dorfman’s brother,
were even embedded inside Dorfman’s boiler rooms.  HIIQ has made
over $40 million in loans to its brokers, including a loan to Dorfman’s
company that is likely now impaired because Dorfman allegedly
absconded with millions to spend on luxuries and the government
has frozen his company’s assets and placed them in receivership.  A
material portion of HIIQ’s 377,000 policies in force may also be
contaminated by insurance fraud based on allegations that
Dorfman’s unlicensed marketers fraudulently recorded policies as
being originated by licensed agents in HIIQ’s systems.


The deceptive sales tactics described by the FTC appear endemic
across HIIQ’s broker network. Unlike traditional insurance, more than
60% of the money paid by consumers goes to HIIQ’s brokers, making
HIIQ products ideal for boiler room operators to sell.  HIIQ brokers
prey on people in between jobs or without group insurance who are
targeted through mass robodialing and a network of websites that
claim to be designed to “help” consumers navigate the complexities
of health insurance.  Once on the phone, brokers use false claims
and high pressure tactics to convince consumers they are
purchasing comprehensive health insurance that covers pre-existing
conditions.  But the policies often don’t have the bene�ts being
promised by the brokers and instead are medical discount programs
or policies that provide very limited coverage.  Families across the
country have learned that they’ve been scammed only after they
begin to incur medical bills and �nd out that their HIIQ policy doesn’t
cover what the boiler room agent promised them it does. This has

been disastrous for many Americans, but quite pro�table for HIIQ
and the boiler rooms it sponsors.


On November 2 , the Federal Trade Commission announced it had
shut down Simple Health and other Dorfman entities (collectively the
“Dorfman Group”). Documents collected by the FTC state that most
of the policies sold by Simple Health were HIIQ policies that,
according to the FTC, are “sham health insurance plans”.  The FTC
presented several thousands of pages of evidence including call
transcripts showing how undercover FTC investigators were
deceptively sold HIIQ policies earlier this year by Dorfman’s boiler
rooms. Declarations from former Simple Health employees and
defrauded consumers describe the tactics used by the Dorfman
Group to allegedly dupe thousands of people into purchasing HIIQ
policies.  Please see the Appendix where we have organized source
documents for investors to review.

FTC Documents reveal that HIIQ’s subsidiary, Health Plan
Intermediaries Holding (“HPIH”), paid the Dorfman Group $145
million in cash from January 2016 to April 2018. This amounts to
49% of the $294.2 million in third-party commissions that HIIQ’s SEC
�lings state it paid out during this approximate timeframe. We
therefore believe that Dorfman’s alleged fraud was responsible for
as much as half of HIIQ’s total revenues.

Documents compiled by the FTC indicate that HIIQ policies sold by
Simple Health may also be contaminated by insurance fraud. A
former Simple Health employee told the FTC that “hundreds, if not

fraudulently identify her as the agent of record even though she had
no interaction with the customers.  This con�rmed rumors she heard
that Simple Health “sold policies under the licenses of employees
who had no involvement in the underlying sales”, presumably enabling
unlicensed boiler room operators to sell policies.

HIIQ has already disclosed that it is the subject of an ongoing
investigation by 42 States into its sales practices. Last year, short
selling research outlet The Friendly Bear warned about the deceptive
tactics of HIIQ brokers in a detailed report that speci�cally
highlighted serious problems involving the Dorfman Group. HIIQ’s
management subsequently claimed the company has “high levels of
compliance and consumer satisfaction” and suggested they had
cleared the bad apples from their broker network.


Yet HIIQ continued doing business with Dorfman, who we have
learned is allegedly “associated with known violent gang members
and provided them cash when they needed it; in turn, Dorfman used
his a�liation with those gang members to threaten [employees]”
(below).

7/10/2019 HIIQ: Boiler Rooms, ‘Worthless’ Policies, and Defrauded Families - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-boiler-rooms-worthless-policies-and-defrauded-families/ 7/16


The nexus between HIIQ and Dorfman is so close that up until March
2015, HIIQ considered Dorfman Group entities related parties in its
SEC �lings. Before later selling its stake, HIIQ entered into a Joint
Venture with Dorfman to form Simple Insurance Leads (“SIL”), a lead
generation company run by Dorfman that was also shut down by the
FTC for allegedly defrauding consumers.


HIIQ also makes loans to its distributors to help them build out boiler
rooms and hire marketers in the form of advanced commissions,
which totaled approximately $40 million as of September 2018. A
2015 disclosure states that Health Bene�ts One, a company owned
by Dorfman named in the FTC’s complaint, represented 63% of this
balance. HIIQ’s 10-K states that the company’s loans are
concentrated amongst three distributors, with the largest single
outstanding loan having a balance $14.2 million as of December
2017. Considering that the FTC stated that Dorfman personally
absconded with millions in cash proceeds to spend on luxuries and
that the assets of his companies have been frozen and placed in
receivership, HIIQ’s loan to Dorfman likely is now impaired.


We believe many HIIQ investors have not yet recognized the
signi�cance of the FTC’s action because HIIQ issued a highly
misleading press release on November 2  that attempted to
downplay HIIQ’s relationship with Dorfman by claiming:


“For 2018 to date, Simple Health was the agency of record for less
than 10% of HIIQ’s submitted policies”. 


This statement leads investors to believe that the Dorfman Group is
immaterial to HIIQ’s business and caused Sell Side analysts to
quickly declare that “there will be no �nancial impact on the
company” from the government’s action.


But as explained below, our research indicates that Dorfman
established a large “downline” of sub-brokers that sold HIIQ policies
under his organizational umbrella and lead generation network. We
obtained contracts between HIIQ and the Dorfman Group that reveal
an undisclosed arrangement whereby HIIQ entered into an
“Independent Broker’s Contract” with Dorfman’s various sub-brokers
individually. HIIQ paid commissions earned by sub-brokers to the

Dorfman Group directly, with those pro�ts then presumably being
split between Dorfman and the sub-brokers. Importantly, A UCC �ling
shows that the sub-brokers themselves (and not the Dorfman Group)
are the “Broker of Record” for the HIIQ policies they originate. HIIQ’s
press release appears highly misleading—of course Simple Health
is not the agent of record because its sub-brokers are.  


Source: Florida UCC Filing.


Based on the scale of the operation described by the FTC, which
states that Simple Health’s “boiler rooms handled over 62 million calls
with consumers”, we assume the FTC’s complaint encompasses the
activities of Dorfman’s sub-agents. After all, the Dorfman Group
“trained, launched, and managed sub-agency sales teams”,
according to the Linkedin pro�le of Steve Dorfman’s brother, Richard,
who was a manager at Simple Health.  We also note that the court’s
Temporary Restraining Order in the FTC Action speci�cally
references “agents” and “all other persons in active concert” with
Dorfman, which we interpret to mean that Dorfman’s downline of
sub-brokers are included in the order’s prohibitions.  We therefore
believe that, at minimum, HIIQ’s ability to generate revenue from
Dorfman’s downline is now impaired. We also believe that the FTC
moving against Dorfman signals that regulators have an increasing
appetite to shut down other boiler rooms who are misleading
consumers, which we �nd likely to create a chilling effect across
HIIQ’s broker network including operators that have no ties to
Dorfman.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-boiler-rooms-worthless-policies-and-defrauded-families/ 9/16


HIIQ insurance policies are an ideal product for boiler rooms to sell
because, unlike traditional insurance, more than 60% of the money
from consumers is paid out as commissions to the brokers. This
product is therefore extremely lucrative for fast-talking “producers”
skilled in deceptive telemarketing. Simple Health, for instance, ran
cartoonish help-wanted ads like the below, claiming “YOU WILL
HAVE MONEY THROWN AT YOU” (below)


The fundamental problem for HIIQ is that many customers who
purchased HIIQ products have been scammed. The FTC states that
Dorfman’s fraud “has left tens of thousands of consumers who
thought they had purchased comprehensive health insurance without
such coverage”.  For example, the FTC evidence includes a
declaration from a consumer who was told by Simple Health that the
HIIQ policy would provide extensive medical coverage.  But after her
husband was hospitalized, she “learned that my policy does not
7/10/2019 HIIQ: Boiler Rooms, ‘Worthless’ Policies, and Defrauded Families - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-boiler-rooms-worthless-policies-and-defrauded-families/ 10/16


require HII [Health Insurance Innovations] to pay medical expenses on
my behalf”, leaving her and her husband stuck with tens of
thousands in medical bills.


So many customers have allegedly been swindled that a Dorfman
Group manager who provided testimony to the FTC estimated in a
court document that:


“approximately 95% of the two to three thousand customer service
calls received by defendants [Dorman Group] each day consisted of


‘complaints from consumers who had been misled about the bene�ts
they would receive’. 


But we believe this understates the total size of the scam since other
boiler rooms and marketers a�liated with HIIQ have also likely
deceived customers.  HIIQ’s own Better Business Bureau (“BBB”)
pro�le comes with an “F” rating, hundreds of complaints from angry
customers, and a bright red warning label.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-boiler-rooms-worthless-policies-and-defrauded-families/ 11/16


The BBB site explains that “BBB has received a pattern of complaints
from customers of Health Insurance Innovations involving alleged
misrepresentation during the sale of insurance products they
purchased”. It says HIIQ “is adamant it is not the business
responsible” because it is “not the insurance agency that made the
sales presentation to the customers”.  Instead, HIIQ claims it is “a
technology platform” and suggests that “the complaints should be
�led against either 1) the agency that sold the policy or 2) the
insurance carrier involved with the claims”.


HIIQ’s effort to duck responsibility strikes us as absurd. First, HIIQ
Documents show that individuals embedded inside the boiler rooms
and call centers are licensed as agents of HIIQ through HPIH. For
example, Richard Dorfman, is licensed as an agent of HPIH.  We also
found 48 other HPIH agents registered to Simple Health’s
headquarters address.

The deceptive sales tactics described by the FTC appear endemic
across HIIQ’s broker network. In fact, HPIH and its agents have
previously been penalized by State Insurance regulators for
misconduct. For example, the California Department of Insurance
penalized HPIH in August 2018, alleging it “is participating in
deceptive sales practices by misrepresenting health policies to
consumers”.  Similarly, in 2016 Arkansas issued a cease and desist
order against HPIH alleging “the company has used fraudulent and
dishonest practices in attempting to sell short-term health care
plans”.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-boiler-rooms-worthless-policies-and-defrauded-families/ 13/16


Agents of HPIH are also registered to addresses of other call centers
accused of misleading customers. In particular, a concentration of
agents are registered to a Pompano Beach address matching that of
a call center associated with Nationwide Health Advisors.  Our
research indicates that Nationwide is another large HIIQ distributor
that also has a “downline” of sub-brokers.


 A class action lawsuit �led against both HIIQ and Nationwide in
2017 levies similar allegations as those made by the FTC against the
Dorfman Group.  The plaintiffs allege that HIIQ (referred to as “HII” in
the lawsuit text) “is the principal orchestrator of the illegal calls and
boiler room junk insurance sales scheme”.   We found over a dozen
other lawsuits that naming HIIQ that levy similar allegations of either
robodialing or deceptive sale practices.  (Note: you should assume
that HIIQ and co-defendants deny all allegations).

Conclusion


HIIQ has been promoted to investors as a bene�ciary of demand for
non-Obamacare policies.  But misleading statements from company
management have disguised the reality that the business appears to
depend on boiler rooms that scam Americans using deceptive sales
tactics. We believe the government’s action against the Dorfman
Group, which the FTC depicted as a giant fraud selling “worthless”
HIIQ policies, speaks volumes about the sustainability of HIIQ’s
business model. Now that multiple state and federal agencies have
begun moving against HIIQ’s broker network, we believe it is now a
question of when, not if, HIIQ’s business will implode.


We therefore see enormous downside potential in HIIQ shares.


All investors are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence
