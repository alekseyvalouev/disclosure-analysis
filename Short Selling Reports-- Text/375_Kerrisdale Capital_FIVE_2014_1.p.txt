Five Below, Inc.: 50x P/E Too Rich For Xmas-Driven Discount Retailer
Jun. 12, 2014 10:30 AM ET14 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


FIVE's valuation multiples of 3x+ LTM revenue and 25x LTM EBITDA are far too high
for a company with mediocre same-store sales growth operating in the brutally
competitive discount retailer.


Same-store sales growth has declined dramatically over the past three years, with
SSSG for Q42013 falling to an anemic 0.4% and overall forward year guidance
projected to be only ~4%.


The company's long-term margins likely to be pressured by the wave of competition
flooding the discount retail sector.


FIVE's catalogue is biased towards trendy/fad items targeted for a fickle teenage
demographic and its sales are disproportionately weighted towards the holiday
season, factors which both translate to earnings volatility.


We believe that Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is highly overvalued. FIVE is a specialty
value retailer that offers merchandise targeted to teens, pre-teens and their parents in a
concept that we view as a glorified dollar / toy store. Its valuation multiples of 3x+ LTM
revenue and 25x LTM EBITDA are far too high for a company with mediocre same-store
sales growth operating in the brutally competitive discount segment of the retail industry.
Same-store sales growth (SSSG) has declined dramatically over the past three years, with
SSSG for Q4 2013 falling to an anemic 0.4% and overall forward year guidance projected
to be a modest 4%. Additionally, we expect the company's long-term margins to be
pressured by the wave of competition flooding the discount retail sector, whether it be due
to the 5% to 7% annual unit expansion of Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Dollar Tree
(NASDAQ:DLTR) or Family Dollar (NYSE:FDO), or the 2,000+ Walmart Express small-
format stores expected to open over the next five years; additionally, discount retailers
rarely boast impressive profit margins due to their lack of brand name products. Finally,
FIVE's catalogue is biased towards trendy/fad items that are targeted for a fickle teenage
demographic and its sales are disproportionately weighted towards the holiday season,
factors which both translate to increased volatility in year-to-year results.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 2/20


For all the aforementioned reasons, we think that the current $2.0 billion market cap being
assigned to Five Below, a company that generated only $80m of EBITDA and $40m of net
income in fiscal 2013, faces substantial downside over the coming year. Indeed, it was no
surprise that when the company released its Q1 earnings last week, and both beat analyst
estimates and raised guidance, the stock ended the day down 4%. The market has seen a
violent re-pricing for high-flying momentum stocks over the past few months, with former
momo darlings like SPLK, CSLT and FEYE down more than 50% from their peaks.
Egregious valuations of recent IPOs that were inflated by thin floats and easy-to-beat
sellside estimates have seen a downward revision since mid-March. Many of these
momentum names have beat estimates and raised guidance in the most recent quarter,
but have still seen their stocks fall on earnings. Companies that have underperformed
expectations have routinely witnessed their stocks plummet more than 20%.


We think FIVE has yet to fully participate in the much-deserved momo correction.


At current premium multiples, investors are assuming FIVE experiences no missteps in
executing its high-growth strategy. A valuation of 25x LTM EBITDA implies substantial
margin expansion, 10%+ SSS growth, and a maintenance of 20%+ unit growth for many
years to come. However, we believe that FIVE's 13% EBITDA margin is already at
elevated levels; we note that its SSS growth has already fallen below 5%, let alone the
10%+ level that its nosebleed valuation implies; and we believe that 20%+ unit growth will
be difficult to execute effectively as FIVE's store base becomes larger and larger.
Throughout this and future articles, we will elaborate on other fast-growing retailers that
have expanded too quickly in order to justify lofty valuations, such as Francesca's
Holdings (NASDAQ:FRAN), only to experience declining sales per square foot and
negative same-store sales growth, which in turn have triggered valuation cuts of 50% or
more.


To value FIVE, we discuss a comparable companies analysis that compares FIVE to other
fast-growing emerging retailers, as well as dollar stores. FIVE's stretched multiples stand
out even when compared with other overhyped momo retailers. When matched with other
dollar stores, FIVE's valuation is clearly an outlier, and although investors may claim that
FIVE is at a different stage in its lifecycle than perhaps a Dollar General, we question just
how different FIVE's business model really is from other discount retailers.


Additionally, we present a highly optimistic 10-year discounted cash flow analysis to
supplement our comparable companies analysis. Our DCF yields a valuation for FIVE of
approximately $23 / share, well below the current price of $35. Even in a scenario where

FIVE triples its store count and quadruples revenue and EBITDA, shares would be 35%
overvalued based on our analysis.


Capitalization and Financial Snapshot


Gross Overvaluation Relative to Peers and other Retail Stocks


FIVE's share price of $35/share implies a lofty valuation of 3.4x LTM revenue, 25x LTM
EBITDA and 50x LTM P/E. On a forward basis, FIVE trades at 2.8x FY14E revenue, 20x
FY14E EBITDA and 39x FY14E P/E. On almost any metric, FIVE looks expensive,
especially when compared to other, arguably more successful, retailers. Lululemon
(NASDAQ:LULU), which has a premium brand name, better margins, and higher SSSG,
trades at a 34% and 43% discount to FIVE's 2014E EV / EBITDA and P/E multiples,
respectively. Conn's Inc (NASDAQ:CONN), a specialty retailer focused on electronics and
appliances, had SSSG of 27% in Q1'14, is expected to increase revenue by 27% in 2014,
and has higher EBITDA margins than FIVE, yet it also trades at a significant discount to
FIVE.


Below is a comparable companies analysis that compares FIVE to two comparables sets:
(NYSE:I) other dollar stores and (ii) other fast-growing retailers.

Public Comparables - Operating Statistics


When compared with other fast-growing retailers, FIVE's steep valuation multiples stand
out. For instance, Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH) is expected to grow 2014 revenue by
22%, and its 2013 same-store sales growth was a resounding 31%. The company is also
benefiting from a showroom-oriented business model like WSM, whereby the company is
rapidly increasing its online sales through online advertising and social media rather than
expanding its units. Yet RH's EV / EBITDA multiple is 30% lower than FIVE's.


When compared to other dollar store operators, FIVE's revenue multiple is three times
higher than the average of the comparable set, and its forward 2014E EV / EBITDA and P
/ E multiples are more than twice as high. We expect FIVE's growth and margin metrics to
moderate faster than sellside analysts think. Maintaining 13% EBITDA margins and
elevated same store sales growth as a discount retailer will become much harder when
the company operates 500+ stores as compared with its current 323-store base,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 5/20


especially when the company is increasing unit growth at a ~25% annual clip. We think it's
probable that execution issues, such as poor site selection, disadvantageous leases, and
off-trend merchandising, will hamper FIVE's growth and margins in the near-to-
intermediate term.


Over time, we believe the valuation gap between FIVE and its peers will narrow, as
investors will realize that FIVE's premium valuation is unwarranted.


Declining Same Store Sales Growth Suggests 20+% Revenue Growth Unsustainable


At first glance, FIVE's FY 2009-2013 revenue CAGR of 44% certainly seems impressive.
However, most of this growth was driven by new store openings. From FY 2009-2013,
FIVE opened 222 net new stores (CAGR of 31%) and expects to open 62 more in FY
2014. Over the same period, same store sales growth (SSSG) declined from a high of
15.6% in FY 2010 to 4.0% in FY 2013. For FY 2014, management projects that same
store sales growth will be flat at 4.0%, implying no improvement from FY 2013.


Same Store Sales Growth (Annual)


Notably, FIVE's SSSG in the fourth quarter has been on a declining trend since FY 2011.
The fourth quarter is the most important quarter of the year for many retailers due to the
holiday season. This is especially true for FIVE as the fourth quarter represented 42%,

41% and 40% of total sales for the fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.


Same Store Sales Growth (Quarterly)


The deceleration of SSSG is a common trend in the dollar store industry. SSSG for Dollar
General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar has declined significantly since FY 2009.
Extrapolating from this trend would suggest that long-term growth rates for this industry
would be in the low single-digits. While FIVE continues to grow revenues by 20-30% (31%
y-o-y growth in Q1'14), the growth has been fuelled via adding new stores, which requires
upfront capital, rather than same store sales growth.

Margins at Elevated Levels and May Contract Long-Term


Investors in FIVE are bullish on the company's growth prospects, highlighting FIVE's
profitability and operating metrics. Retail however is a commoditized and cutthroat
industry, and while FIVE may have carved out a unique niche as a teen and pre-teen
focused dollar store operator, we question its ability to command sector-leading margins
as it expands its store base.


FIVE has minimal sustainable competitive advantages. Despite operating in a
commoditized industry, it is not a low-cost competitor, like a Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or
Costco (NASDAQ:COST). It does not have strategic real estate locations, unlike many of
the dollar stores, which had first-mover advantages in picking up prime dense-population
locations. It does not have unique product sourcing capability. Nor does the firm have a
brand name or long-standing customer relationships and customer data (one of the few
things keeping customers coming to retailers such as JC Penny and Sears). Its unique
strategy of focusing on teenagers and their parents differentiates the retailer, but we don't
think this will be enough to allow FIVE to maintain sector-leading margins over the long
term.


Below is a comparison of FIVE's margins to competitors':


As we can see, FIVE currently boasts a higher margin than both Dollar General and
Family Dollar, by over 250 basis points as compared to Dollar General and at nearly
double the EBITDA margin of Family Dollar. We don't think this is sustainable.


What FIVE offers is simply a product assortment and a price point. These are things that
any retailer can easily replicate. Competitor commentary indicates that traditional discount
retailers are already adding products at the $1.00 to $5.00 price point. For example, Dollar
Tree has been rapidly expanding its Deal$ store format, which sells products higher than
its traditional $1.00 price format. It should be noted that Dollar Tree's Deal$ format is
already quite sizable at ~220 locations, compared to ~300 for FIVE.

Another key component of our growth strategy is the expansion of Deal$, Dollar Tree
Canada, and Dollar Tree Direct. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more
customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$
stores deliver low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home
product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve
more customers with more products at value prices every day. We ended the quarter
with a total of 217 Deal$ stores and growing. - Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree CEO, Q1
2014 Transcript


Perhaps even more troubling is the recent decision by Dollar General to add more
products at a higher price point in order to capture additional consumer wallet share.
Dollar General is currently the largest discount convenience retailer in the United States,
with over 11,000 locations. While Dollar Tree decided to create an entirely separate brand
("Deal$") for its stores that carry a wider assortment of goods, Dollar General's decision to
allow > $1.00 price products into its existing stores could represent a significant threat to
FIVE's locations, many of which are adjacent to Dollar General's existing stores.

If the increased competitiveness of dollar stores is not dangerous enough, the US
convenience store industry has also seen a very significant expansion in terms of both
units and square footage and is now creating considerable competition in terms of
consumables.

Increasing Competition from Convenience Stores


However, these competitive threats are likely dwarfed by the potential threat from Wal-
Mart Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express.


Investors are Going to be Blindsided by a Looming Threat: Wal-Mart Neighborhood
Market


FIVE's success has largely been a function of identifying a unique inventory assortment
and making it available in a small, convenient and local store format. Investors have
largely assumed that FIVE has a unique market position since many of its inventory
products are not widely available at the other local discount retailers (such as formats
owned by FDO, DG, DLTR) because FIVE's discount competitors were largely focused on
selling consumables rather than variety, house ware and seasonal goods catered towards
teens and their parents.


That is about to change with the broad introduction of Wal-Mart's new small-format
concepts: Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express (collectively referred to
as "Wal-Mart Small Format" or "WSF" in this report).


WSFs are particularly worrisome competitive threats for the discount retail industry for four
key reasons:


1. Wal-Mart sells products for a far lower profit than competitors; this will decimate
margins in the industry


2. Wal-Mart will likely take share; it has greater brand recognition, foot traffic, and
turnover


3. WSFs will offer a wider assortment of products and services given their larger footprint

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 10/20


4. WSFs are not only a retail format, but a shipment node for the lower cost Wal-Mart
supercenter stores


For the past several years, Wal-Mart has been experimenting with smaller-format
concepts as well as online delivery business models. WMT management has been trying
to understand which store size, product assortment and price points will allow the
company to profitably enter the local discount retailing space, and how these local stores
can be used to augment and enhance their online strategy.


Finally, after several years of testing and adaptation, the company has finally settled on a
business model it is happy with, and Wal-Mart has indicated that 2014 is the start of an
incredibly aggressive expansion of its WSF stores, with the planned opening of at least
250 of these stores in the coming year, with hundreds more to follow in coming years.


Source: Wal-Mart investor day presentation, March 2014


We'll add 270 to 300 new small units this year. That includes 160 to 180
Neighborhood Markets, 110 to 120 Express formats. This will allow us to gain more
of a convenient shopping trip for our customers in what they want… There are
something like, I think, 11,000 new small stores that have been put out in the U.S. in
the last 3 years that we think have impacted that... We think it'll be a very powerful
vehicle for the customer experience with this convenience and be able to combine
that digital and that physical for that customer. --Charles Holley, CFO, March 2014

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 11/20


While the typical Wal-Mart supercenter is nearly 200,000 square feet, the Wal-Mart
Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express stores are approximately 40,000 and 12,000
square feet in size, respectively, a significantly larger format than the typical discount store
size of between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet. These stores will have a large enough
footprint such that, in addition to offering grocery, pharmacy, and other key recurring-
revenue consumable products (which is the bread & butter of most discount retailers), the
WSFs will also have sufficient space to offer house wares, party, sporting goods and other
seasonal selective merchandise which will be in direct competition with FIVE.


The mere footprint expansion does not capture the full scale of the competitive threat.


Investors may look at Wal-Mart's modest unit count and presume that it is only modestly
nudging the total industry's unit growth over the coming couple of years. However, when
one considers the projected increase in competition from a revenue standpoint, one can
see that the WSF stores' total revenue expansion is a far more serious threat. Simply put,
FIVE is competing in a commoditized industry where nearly every competitor plans to
aggressively grow unit count and even more aggressively grow revenue, yet analysts
expect margins and profitability to remain constant despite the world's most sophisticated
and aggressive retailer entering the market?


Wal-Mart is Going to Quickly Become a Major Competitor in the Discount Retail Industry


This doesn't seem to make sense, particularly when one looks at Wal-Mart's far lower
margins, and store-level turnover metrics.


Wal-Mart Sells Products at a Far Lower


Price…


… by Utilizing its Real Estate More


Efficiently…

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 12/20


Wal-Mart pricing is disruptive for the entire


discount retail industry


Wal-Mart will use its brand recognition, superior


slate of services, and larger format to grab share


The primary concern is that Wal-Mart, simply put, is an incredibly aggressive competitor
that is willing to earn less on each sale than its competitors. WMT makes up for this lower
profit by turning its inventory faster, and utilizing its real estate more efficiently through
better sales per square foot.


The entry of Wal-Mart is not just a threat for FIVE, but for the entire discount retail market
in general. The copious profits, impressive 10%+ EBITDA margins, and fantastic returns
on equity that the industry has enjoyed for the past decade are likely to deteriorate when
Wal-Mart begins to disrupt the industry.


FIVE's Retailing Model is Inherently More Risky than Other Discount Retailers Due
to Dependency on Holiday Season


Many research analysts compare FIVE to other discount retailers such as DG, FDO and
DLTR. However, there are fundamental differences in FIVE's business model which make
these comparisons quite risky and misleading.


While other discount store retailers focus heavily on providing consumable merchandise,
such as grocery and household consumables, FIVE is more heavily weighted towards
leisure items and house ware. Discount retailers often focus on minimizing costs,
improving efficiencies and sourcing the lowest-cost everyday household items; in contrast,
FIVE's merchandising team must continue to accurately predict customer tastes and
trends, much like a fashion or furniture retailer. Thus, FIVE's merchandising mix is
significantly riskier than that of a consumables retailer such as Dollar General.


DG Sales are Largely Recurring Consumables… … Whereas FIVE Sales are "Trend"
5/23/2018 Five Below, Inc.: 50x P/E Too Rich For Xmas-Driven Discount Retailer - Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 13/20


FY 2014 Revenue: $17.5B
FY 2014 Revenue: $0.5B


Another important data point is FIVE's heavy dependence on the holiday season for sales.
This important distinction is not as evident when one looks at annual figures; however,
when looking at quarterly financial results, it is quite evident that FIVE is disproportionately
reliant on the holiday season. In fact, the company is barely profitable for the other three
quarters of the year.


FIVE EBIT Margins Appear Normal on an Annualized Level…


While DG, FDO and DLTR generate a relatively steady, recurring engagement with their
customers through selling convenient consumable merchandise, FIVE is far more
dependent on selling "trend" inventory for holiday gifting season. Though this strategy can
yield outsized margins when successful, the risks to investors from even one poor
Christmas season can be significant. Particularly cold weather, as in 2013, or poor holiday
merchandising in a given year can adversely impact FIVE far more than its peers.


… but Quarterly Results Show that FIVE is Really a Holiday Retailer



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/6/11/559143-1402541172055384-Kerrisdale-Capital-Management_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 14/20


Thus, due to FIVE's heavier reliance on non-recurring items and holiday sales, its revenue
and profits are less predictable than its discount retailing peers. Seasonal weather or poor
execution during the holiday season can have a particularly pronounced impact on FIVE's
profitability. FIVE's dependence on predicting customer demand for seasonal items makes
them more akin to a lower-multiple fashion retailer such as a GPS (which trades at 14x
forward P/E) rather than a recurring-revenue, low-cost consumable merchandise company
such as a Costco (23x forward P/E) or DG (18x forward P/E).


Low Inventory Turnover a Cause for Concern


When comparing FIVE's inventory turnover metrics, cost basis (SG&A as % of revenue)
and overall retail efficiency (sales per square foot, SG&A per square foot), FIVE's metrics
are quite poor compared to other dollar stores, and particularly poor when compared to
large competitors such as Wal-Mart, Costco, etc.


Given that FIVE is a holiday-dependent retailer, its declining inventory turnover is
particularly troubling. For example, for a retailer that sells household items and
consumables (such as a CVS), the vast majority of its store-front sales are non-perishable
inventory items. If a stick of makeup doesn't sell in one quarter, it can often be sold in the
next.


However, for a retailer that sells perishable items, or in FIVE's case, holiday-dependent
"seasonal" purchases, a lost sale may not be recovered, at least for an entire year. This
heightens the risk of taking a significant loss on inventory. FIVE's recent inventory trends
look particularly troubling.


FIVE's Inventory Turnover is Falling, Which is Particularly Risky for a Holiday-Dependent


Retailer

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 15/20


Declining inventory turns raises the danger of inventory obsolescence at FIVE, which
would compress margins and further call into question the company's 50x LTM P/E and
39x 2014E P/E multiples.


Highly Optimistic Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Implies 40% Downside


While we highlighted FIVE's significant overvaluation relative to other retail companies,
our highly optimistic DCF analysis further exposes FIVE's current stock price vulnerability.
Under our generous assumptions, we arrive at a share price of $23, 35% below where the
stock closed on Friday. This valuation implies a more reasonable 11x 2014E EBITDA
multiple, far below the current 20x multiple and in-line with high-growth retail stocks.
Under this illustrative 10-year scenario, we assume that FIVE more than triples store
count, quadruples revenue and EBITDA, and that SSSG stabilizes at 3.0% per annum.
Our other assumptions include the following:


Net new stores of 60 per year, 70 per year starting in 2018, 80 per year starting in
2022
Gross margins of 35% and EBIT margins of 13% throughout projection period
Maintenance capex growing at new store rate
Store growth capex of $0.3 million per store
Discount rate of 10%; terminal FCF growth rate of 3.0%

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265303-five-below-inc-50x-p-e-too-rich-for-xmas-driven-discount-retailer 16/20


Even in our highly optimistic scenario where we project FIVE to grow revenue and
EBITDA at a CAGR of 15%, the analysis reveals significant downside. Further, this
scenario illustrates a best case scenario where FIVE has no missteps in growing store
count, is able to manage volatility in sales of products that are inherently trendy, and
executes its strategy to perfection. We believe that a tempered version of this scenario
would further highlight FIVE's current overvaluation and suggest even more downside.


Conclusion


In closing, we applaud FIVE's management team for growing their concept to the current
scale. However, we believe that the company's market valuation is unjustified given the
sharply declining SSSG trend, increasingly competitive discount retailer landscape,
faddish nature of FIVE's products, and its dependence on the holiday season. In light of
these risks, and based on peer retail firms' significantly lower valuations and our DCF
analysis which suggests a much lower valuation, we believe that fair value is significantly
below the current share price.

In future articles, we will discuss how many emerging retailers don't live up to
expectations, and how the retail landscape is littered with fast-growing concepts trading at
20x+ EBITDA in early years, only to see stock prices skid as execution issues,
competition, cannibalization and limited total addressable markets lead to weakening
sales per square foot trends, same store sales growth and margins in later years. We'll
also discuss how even some of the most successful concepts in the retail and restaurant
sectors never traded at the lofty valuation multiples currently ascribed to Five Below.

Outstanding article. Terrific job. However, I think you missed a couple of points. First, FIVE is already down a lot from
its highs on prior earnings misses. Second, this business is at its early stages. I would agree with your thesis if the
business unable to grow, but management has made it clear that they intend to grow the business. I would further
argue that there is nothing wrong with "the concept". It comes down to business execution. I don't think you entirely
address that issue that is why they will not be able to execute. In any case, great job on the financial analysis, very
impressive. Regards HL

Is relative gross margin an indication of "WSF" gross margin?


12 Jun 2014, 12:12 PM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  It's unclear what WSF's gross margin will be, but that chart demonstrates Walmart's
willingness to operate at lower gross margins, which will drive down prices for the entire dollar store sector.

So while there are many claims that poverty is on the rise, the "dollar" stores are inflating their more stable
consumable product prices? And this goes without risk? Or this is a guarantee that their revenue growth will
accelerate?

In regards to seasonality, it would appear that DG and DLTR have significant seasonality too, much more than FDO.
However, FDO's Q4 trends appear to be in decline.


It is agreed that FIVE has more variation and sensitivity to Q4, but the company is not alone to seasonality in their
revenue periods when compared to this peer group.


I also question the stretch to other retail-based companies that are not direct competitors.


It would also appear that in Q1 14, FIVE achieved very robust SSSG YOY improvement, not sure what you would
attribute this too or how this impacts your views for this fiscal year.

Author’s reply »  DLTR and DG also exhibit some seasonality trends; however, the seasonality is not nearly
as extreme as FIVE. In Q4, FIVE generated 69% of its FY 2013 EBIT in Q4. For DLTR and DG, Q4
represented 36% and 31%, respectively.


We use other retail-based companies in our comparables analysis, because some analysts have referenced
other fast-growing emerging retailers as more appropriate comparables than mature dollar stores.


Q1 2014 numbers were better than Q4 2013, but in our opinion they still weren't strong enough to justify a
$2bn market cap for a dollar store retailer that generates only $80m of EBITDA at 13% ebitda margins.

At current levels the PE will be at 40 March 2015. I'll hang on to my shares and look to buy more if indeed you can
push this down to 31, and then 27. I feel totally comfortable with being long here at 35$. FIVE will execute and will
grow 30% per year without a hiccup. Your target is 26 which seems totally reasonable if they miss, but frankly all the
expenses are accounted for in the current forecasts. The expansion of the NE DC from 200sq feet to 400 sq. feet is
not and may result in a equity offer sometime later 2015. I believe the H/S (the mini h/s pattern - formed since FEB.)
will fail propelling this back to mid forties. Risk reward here is good for 10 point gain from 35$. PT 45$ by 4th Q
reporting early 2015.

I'm laughing at this report as their whole thesis is based on what other discounters are doing, and WalMarts mini
stores. Give me a break. Compare apples to apples please. Oh, you can't, because no one else is doing what FIVE is
doing, and catering to the "fickle - niche" teenage market.

Obviously over the long-term all we can do is adjust our assumptions as each quarter progresses. It will continue to
be debatable of how much revenue growth FIVE will achieve, and similarly, what the future potential will hold. I think
the most important factor based on WMT and the peer group will be how profit margins play out moving froward in
2014 and on, as you have highlighted.


Overall, it is always great to get this type of analysis.


Thanks for the work.

in the $40s, yes FIVE is overpriced.


your article is late


your financial valuations would have been far more effective (short justification) when FIVE was trading in the 50s

Very thorough article.


They've put up a new store near my house, and my teenagers like to shop there. Every so often I get dragged there
as well. I wonder if it is perhaps different from any store that you may have attended. We shopped there during the
Christmas season and I don't recall seeing a whole lot of season specific items, it was mostly the same crap you
would buy year round, (cheap makeup, cheap clothes, candy, cheap sporting goods, etc) It might be marketed a little

different in Q4, as gifts rather than cheap stuff to buy for yourself, but there was not a whole lot that you'd have to
keep in inventory for a year to unload.


You quoted in an earlier comment that 69% of FY13 EBIT came from Q4. Is it possible that data wasn't normalized to
account for new stores that came online during the year? It's still going to be abnormally high in comparison to other
dollar stores, but it might be skewed considering Q4 had approximately 25% more stores doing business and adding
to EBIT than Q1. Maybe accounting for extra stores, that number might be in the 50s.


As far as slightly higher margins not being sustainable, teenagers in my opinion aren't very discerning with how they
spend their money and whether or not they are getting a good deal. It feels kind of slimy to even argue that taking
advantage of dumb teens could sustain their higher margins, but there you go.

It's going to be a long 3 months till next report, indeed. 
What could be the next date for news from FIVE? Joel taking his seat at his desk 6/20, or a fantastic 4th of July sales,
or the opening of new stores, or mid Q3 guidance (although they have not done that in the past), or preliminary Q2
estimates. 
One thing is for sure FIVE has hit their numbers 100% of the time without fail, and mngt. guides conservatively. Point
of fact from the last call by Ken Bull, CFO. Another is Q3 is the slowest Q.  
Will be very interesting to see just how hard the shorts work at keeping this down, because Feb. 2015 it's at a 30 PE,
at 35$. That is guidance that will be proved, just extrapolating no upside other than the revenue from new stores
opened. Shorts have already conceded they see 13% margins. So 4% guidance shows just how much money they
spent (spend) on new hires and store openings. Ya hoo! I see no problem in the quick ratio on the short term debt
question, that "The Street" puts out there. Especially since the President position and most openings are paid for now.
