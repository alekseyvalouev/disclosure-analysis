China Mobile Games (CMGE) shares are weak in early trading this morning,
down over 14% to around $16.25. We could not find a reason for the declining

“ "CMGE issued an internal notice that CMGE removed Mr. Ying Shulingfrom the president position. Along with Mr. Ying Shuling, vice president
Sun Jingzhi, Vice president Du Xinxing, Chenxing Game general manager
Min Shuzhong, Zhuoxin Game general manager Wang Kun, distribution
and supportive center director Du Juan, Oversea distribution Group vice
general manager Yang Bin, platform supportive group R&D center
assistant general manager Luo Xiao, procurement director are also
removed from their positions. All these persons shall surrender their
assignment and office suppliers within three days. These persons only can
come back to work upon company's further notice."


At this time no specific reasons were provided in the related articles as to why
these individuals were fired, but we have identified rumors:


1. Ying Shuling (President) was not "getting along " with CEO Xiao Jian and
other senior executives;


2. Ying Shuling, (President) was "taking advantage of his authority to purchase
products from a related company to make additional money."


We encourage the company to issue a press release to discuss this issue more
thoroughly.


..."


Obviously, we will be monitoring this story as it plays out and have taken full
advantage of the trade.
