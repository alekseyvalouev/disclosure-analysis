China Green Agriculture: Still Waiting for Answers
Sep. 14, 2010 4:07 PM ET30 comments
by: Alfred Little


China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA) investors who call its IR firm, HC International, this
week will discover that HC and CGA are parting ways after weeks of turmoil over
questions raised by the International Financial Research & Accounting Group, a summary
of which I originally wrote here.


CGA is expected to hire a new IR firm to replace the well-respected HC in the near term.
HC representative Ted Haberfield is telling inquiring investors that they weren’t happy with
CGA’s slow and tepid response to the questions raised. Nor are investors likely to be
happy with CGA’s two press releases issued Monday in an attempt to explain itself.


Before I review those press releases, I’d like to first point out to investors that a friend
made a recent site visit to CGA’s 88 acre “R&D greenhouses” project and took this very
revealing photo of a CGA’s banner at the site promoting the project. 


The picture clearly shows 30-40% of the land will be developed as a large scale real
estate project, complete with what appear to be lakes, condos, villas and large facilities
one of which is designated “science center”, while the others appear to be entertainment
related. The Chinese characters at the center of the billboard clearly translate
“Tourism/Relaxation Zone.”

Now, the last time I saw a project like this, and it was hardly this large scale, was
American Oriental Bioengineering’s (AOB) Beijing real estate splurge that reportedly cost
$70 million to develop and managed to alienate just about every institutional investor.
CGA management should have considered that investors don’t like companies that mix
their focus up, be it on real estate or Chairman Li Tao’s failed Kingtone Wireless IPO.


Regarding Monday’s dual press releases, they served only to point out why Chinese
companies need an experienced CFO and solid IR. The two press releases are full of
errors and omissions. Consider first the disclosure of CGA’s corporate income tax (CIT)
paid for calendar years 2008 and 2009:


More specifically, Jinong paid RMB 14,466,731.61 (approximately $2.1 million)
in March 2009 for the CIT incurred for calendar 2008. It paid
RMB21,040,562.21 (approximately $3.1 million) in March 2010 for the CIT
incurred for calendar 2009.


Anyone with a basic understanding of the Chinese tax system knows that Corporate
Income Tax has to be filed and pre-paid to the SAT within 15 days after the end of each
month or quarter. By the end of the 5th month after a calendar year ends, the enterprise
must file a final tax return along with all adjustments to prior pre-payments and its audited
financial statements. So it is simply impossible for CGA, as it claims in its press
release, to have paid each calendar year’s income taxes in a lump sum in March of
the following year. In fact, CGA’s own SEC filings prove its claims in the press release to
be inaccurate. In the Cash Flow Statement within the 10-Q filed on Feb 10 2010 (link
here), CGA disclosed income tax cash payment of $621,367 during the 6-month period
ending December 31, 2009.


CGA then proceeds to try to explain its value-added tax (VAT) accounting. The
explanation is hopelessly wrong and as a former licensed CPA myself, I will explain the
proper accounting to readers myself, in simple form.


First of all, VAT is not expensed in the Income Statement. In fact, there's no such thing as
a VAT expense. The way VAT is accounted for under GAAP is as follows:


The following VAT related accounting entries are made only to the accounts on the
Balance Sheet:


1. Sale of goods: An increase in Cash (or Accounts Receivable) and VAT Payable for the
amount of the VAT sales output tax



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/857949/000114420410005833/v173446_10-q.htm
5/18/2018 China Green Agriculture: Still Waiting for Answers | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/225186-china-green-agriculture-still-waiting-for-answers 3/14


2. Purchase of goods: A decrease in Cash and the VAT Payable for the VAT purchase
input tax deductible


3. VAT payment to the SAT: A decrease in Cash and VAT payable


In other words, the balance of VAT Payable on the balance sheet is the net difference
between the sales output tax payable and the purchase input tax deductible. The VAT
amount does not enter or touch the Income Statement as any cost or expense. The
explanation given by CGA in its press release is totally incorrect. 


CGA’s explanation of the amount of VAT Payable also completely fails to mention the fact
that VAT is required to be accrued and paid on a monthly basis. Any amount of VAT
Payable that CGA reports on its balance sheet must be paid within 30 days (to avoid
severe penalties). It is therefore entirely reasonable to add up all the quarter ending VAT
payable balances for the 8 quarters in question, equal to $14.99 million, and conclude that
CGA must have paid have at least that amount to the SAT. But the official tax records
obtained by IFRA here show only RMB 469,000 VAT paid during this period. CGA
described those records as “incomplete” on its fourth quarter conference call but as we
have seen it has since failed to provide any evidence to support its position.


Regarding the inflated 88-acre land purchase, CGA has still not explained the payment of
RMB 54.83 million to an unnamed SOE. In fact, according to an additional government
record obtained by IFRA that you can download here (within footnote 22) is titled “Notice
of Approval for the Land Use Right Sale from Hu County Government”. It explains very
clearly that the government took back the usage rights to the land from the previous owner
on April 3, 2009 before reselling it to CGA subsidiary Yuxing. It is also clearly stated in the
land use right transfer agreement that Yuxing acquired the land use right directly from Hu
County government's Land and Resource Bureau. The agreement is titled "State-owned
Land Use Right Transfer Agreement" and the seller is the Land and Resource Bureau of
Hu County, Xi'an, Shaanxi. Therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of the RMB 54.83
million payment CGA claims it made to the unnamed SOE to purchase the land use rights.


In addition, the Deed Tax Receipt showed a tax payment of RMB 520,534.78, an amount
CGA also confirms in their press release. According to the Deed Tax Regulation from
website of Shaanxi provincial government here, the applicable deed tax rate for such
transactions is 3% according to Section 5 of the regulation. Section 6 (1) clearly explains
that 3% shall be calculated on the contracted price of land usage rights and properties,
including all forms of payments made in monetary considerations, tangible, intangible
assets and economic interests. The land usage right sale price based on the RMB

520,534.78 and 3% deed tax rate is RMB 17.35 million. CGA therefore paid no Deed Tax
on the balance of RMB 54.83 million it claims it paid to the unidentified “selling SOE”, in
clear violation of the Deed Tax law. Once again it strongly appears this money went
somewhere else unrelated to the land purchase. There can be no other conclusion.


Note: I would like to thank the solid work done by the team at IFRA and I also salute HC
International, one of the best IR firms for Chinese companies, for its bold decision to part
ways with a client that refuses to adequately and timely address investor concerns. More
IR firms need to follow this example to pressure Chinese U.S. listed companies to be
more accountable to their shareholders.

We did see many developers in China reported VAT in income statement as an expense entry. GAAP is different from
IFRAS?

Hi, I think you may have confused this with the LAT in real estate transaction in China. The VAT you're
referring to is actually called Land Appreciation Tax, in Chinese, it's directly translated as Land Value Added
Tax. LAT applies only to sales of real estate, and it's technically a different tax from Value Added Taxes, which
is collected at each stage of a good/service's manufacturing and distribution. The only similarity is their names
in Chinese. An English explanation of LAT from Chinese State Administration of Taxation website is here:
www.chinatax.gov.cn/n6...


Here's the explanation from The Form 20-F of Xinyuan Real Estate (XIN), a Chinese Real Estate developer
listed on NYSE:


www.sec.gov/Archives/e...


Land Appreciation Tax 
In accordance with the relevant taxation laws for real estate companies of the provinces in which the
subsidiaries operate in the PRC, the local tax authorities levy LAT based on progressive rates ranging from
30% to 60% on the appreciation of land value, being the proceeds of sales of properties less deductible
expenditures, including borrowing costs and all property development expenditures. LAT is prepaid on
customer deposits and is expensed when the related revenue is recognized, as explained at Note 2 (h).

There is a reason professional accountants with years of training and experience are hired to do taxes and file
financial documents rather than amateurs. They get it right. Your characterization of IFRA report as "solid work"
provided some humor, at least.

DrRufus: 
You must be joking! You obviously have not read the PCAOB audits of the "professional" accounting firms.
They are making mistakes all over the place. You are being highly misled if you think the "professional"
accounting firms "get it right" all the time. Very ignorant and naive post.

The anti-China nervous nellies are claiming intentional fraud, not just small errors due to technicalities or
differences of opinion. There is a big difference to investors betweeen the two. I'm saying there is no
intentional fraud here and also that any errors found would not affect the bottom line much at all. Eventually
the share prices of CGA and these Chinese microcaps are going to spring back smack in the face of the
shorters. gl

Breaking News - CGA , A takeover target. 5 minutes ago Recently we have seen sophisticated & coordinated attack
on CGA. Authors from nowhere started publishing negative reports on this once vibrant stock.  
As soon as their sensational news starts fading down another one will be ready to hit this stock further down.


On one side they want you to fear and sell your positions and another side they are secretly loading tons of this stock.
Don't you smell something fishy here. Just hold tight with your positions , make sure your broker has not given your
positions to the shorters, every single stock counts now . 
There is a big gameplan going to unfold in coming months


this is an neutral expert's opinion on this stock  
China Green Agriculture (CGA), this is a growth story in the agriculture sector. The company has sequential revenue
growth of over 20% QoQ. It sells fertilizer in the Chinese market. It has been noted that the agriculture sector is the
only sector in China that is excluded from monetory tightening. The high call activity was seen recently. It has also
become clear that large fertilizer companies such as Mosaic (MOS) and Potash (POT) are planning to enter the
Chinese market.

Would you clarify where are you getting your information? I ask this in a genuine search for information. I
have not seen anything linked for today on MSNMoney, Yahoo!Finance, or GoogleFinance so far stating this
"Breaking News".  
Also, what is the name of this "neutral expert"?  
There's nothing wrong with bringing up facts to support your opinion/ point of view, but please provide
verifiable information (pasting links usually works best). Otherwise, this is just hearsay, and is easily
dismissed.

I found it is quite interesting that CGA's press release mentioned the following excuse for the non-matching of its
SAIC and SEC filings:


"Oftentimes, Chinese companies access SAIC filings to learn more about their competitors to gain a commercial
advantage. As a result, many companies have understated their financial results in such filings."


This is so funny, so there are thousands of companies trading on Shanghai Stock Exchange with their financials
reported to the general public, by the same logic above, shouldn't all these Chinese companies intentionally
understate their financial results (like what CGA claimed it did) so their competitors won't be able to gain a
commercial advantage?


Also, assuming CGA's explanation about reporting fake numbers to the SAIC to protect competitive information is
reasonable (which I find not), how are they not revealing such important information to its competitors by reporting
"true" numbers on the publicly accessible SEC website?

CGA has already appointed a new and reputable IR firm, Christensen. See link below.

15 Sep 2010, 01:52 PM


DrRufus
1) You think an IR firm is going to let go of business? They still get paid no matter what happens to the company.
They couldn't handle the smear campaign, so they got dumped. Plenty of others can replace them. 
2) The 88 acre land has been visited by two- three analysts in person who saw the same blueprint and found it to be
appropriate for an agricultural company that will need the water and have employess living on grounds.  
3) No one can appropriately analyze the financial records and accounting from a distance. The above analyses of the
VAT ignores that in December 2009 the Company received a VAT tax exemption on fertilizer from September 2009 .
This was after it had accrued for the September quarter. So there were no payments for this and no VAT payment for
any fertilizer sales after they became exempt. Taxes due for 2009 are not paid until 2010.


There is some sort of crazy anti-China hysteria going on. CGA is a solid reputable company. I own a few shares of it.

Alfred -


No matter which company is being dissected the supporters have the same predictable knee jerk reaction. "You are a
lying thief destroying the lives of widows and orphans, you need to go to jail, you are wrong because the company
you are attacking says so, we are actually to busy with our anger management classes to have time to make factual
rebuttals, and since we always right we can ignore every point you make."


I am particularly impressed with your VAT analysis. The addition of the information about LAT was a contibution of
actual worthwhile data and I expect you will counter the point being made.


The argument that you can disregard the SAIC filings is more and more being shown to be a very poor choice. The
last several weeks has been peppered with an ever increasing number of Chinese blow ups. FUQI has ok SAIC's,
UTA, DPY, CGA, etc don't. The logic gets more compelling when 100% of the China RTO's that are getting destroyed
have suspect accounting in China. And the corrollary is that as of now all the RTO's with matching SAIC numbers
seem to be much less ravaged.


Must be a coincidence.

I'd like a third party to validate the legitimacy of the IFRA. Information is only as good as its source. IFRAgroup.com is
fairly spartan. I've emailed the contact listed there for references. While they claim to have been founded in 2009, a
whois.com search reveals IFRAgroup.com was only registered 4/22/2010. Not especially damaging, but still
suspicious. Also, google searches of IFRA and "International Financial Research and Analysis Group" come up with
not much more than references to the one report concerning CGA.

@ longshortvalue:  
And you think that a trip to China is so easy? 
It's not a simple route like Athina - Pagkrati dude!


Furthermore, just a thought: What is the "background" of 
Mr. Little?  
He says he worked at SAB Consultants in the period 1994 - 2004.  
I did some google in SAB Consultants, I found nothing.  
So mr Little probably lies because if SAB Consultants existed, where are its internet traces? Why I can not
find anything on Google? 
Furthermore, why mr Little who is so well informed, has so little comments in Seeking Alpha? 
He maintains various and serious topics and accusations for CGA, which noone can control by distance, for
their truth. Let's say me: Can I control if mr Little's claims are real? No. 
But whatever he mention is bad for CGA's reputation. CGA as I knew, besides mr Littl'e accusations, was a
very strong company in its sector and has an outstanding outlook.  
So all these makes me believe that mr Little's attempt, is an attempt 
of degrading speculation. Yes, the Company has not respond enough "strong" yet. But what can do? I
imagine that if all these are just lies, it will prove soon. 
I will not sell my CGA stocks, because I think are valuable!

Louca:


You raise a valid concern in researching the "background" of someone posting an article to determine their
credibility; more important, though, would be whether or not they presented facts to back up their arguments.
The author presented a well-thought out argument regarding the VAT's paid and CGA's responses. 
So if you have other facts that would refute what has been stated by Mr. Little, please share them. Otherwise,
attacking the author really does not help anyone determine what is the truth with this company. 
Also, I believe you are confusing the quality of comments with just plain quantity of comments (which there is
plenty of throughout SeekingAlpha). 
One final note, do you have any insight into something that seems to be an emerging trait in the questionable
(meaning questions of fraud) Chinese Micro-Small Cap companies - that being the mysterious money trail
and/or questionable use of company funds. In this case the payment of RMB 54.83 Million to an unnamed
SOE? Further examples:


ZSTN - almost $2.8 million to companies for "business development services" whose existence has not been
verified.


CHBT - $3.113 million "Cash Advance to Director" for "business related activities."


CCME - Paid out a "dividend" of $17.57 million which at the time of the payout was 67% of the available cash
for the company.


As an investor of a company's stock (since you hold a long position, I'm assuming you're actually an investor,
instead of just a trader), you should be able to know exactly where all of the company's funds went, to what
purpose, and more importantly, the end result of that money. Since you own the stock and are now a partial
owner of the company (in a manner of speaking, we'll not get into the complexities of what you really own with
an RTO/SPAC), you should want to know, and be able to know, where any of YOUR company's money went.

If you understand visiting a company in another country is not easy, that should be part of your consideration
when investing your lifetime saving into a RTO stock in a foreign country, especially in a category with a large
number of recent blow-ups. It's like I don't invest in Indian or Brazilian companies.


"CGA as I knew, besides mr Littl'e accusations, was a very strong company in its sector and has an
outstanding outlook. "


I beg to differ, CGA is an outright fraud based on the research I've done, the things I saw during my visit and
the analysts I spoke within the fertilizer industry. It's amazing CGA couldn't even explain their own accounting

hater: What? Are you involved in the illegal criminal financial terrorism also? I submitted a formal electronic
complaint to the SEC about this illegal attack (it is easy to do). Today, the financial terrorists launched another
attack against RINO and it is substantially the same false lying allegations that were made against CGA. By
the way: how did not like CGA's numbers today? CGA answered in detail the false lying allegations. I urge
everyone to submit a complaint against this illegal manipulation on the SEC's website. Next time I submit a
complaint against this finanacial terrorism--I think I am going to mention this thread. We need to get this type
of activity stopped. They hit several companies at one time and then they go on to other companies. Weak
hands and people who do not understand accounting are getting hurt and losing money. The criminals are
probably naked shorting on top of it all.

Wow. Your well-intentioned misguidance is quite amusing. I'm not sure how pointing out discrepancies in a
companies OWN SEC filings could be considered "financial terrorism". I would welcome the SEC to
investigate the discrepancies and more importantly the questionable use of a shareholders funds. Perhaps
you are unaware that the "Cash Advancement to Director" I pointed out is now prohibited due to the Sarbanes
Oxley legislation. Surely a well-informed investor such as yourself would know such a thing. Since I have not
made any false allegations I would welcome the SEC to investigate the allegations brought forward by others.


I'm quite amused that a person such as yourself, whom I'm assuming is an "investor" of at least one of these
companies would NOT WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOUR OWN MONEY IS GOING.  
Seriously? If you are not able to know where, for what, and the result of all the money a company is using,
then you really have no business investing in this company. How can you verify such basic fundamentals
such as ROE, ROA, COGS, the profit margin, FCF, if you don't know where millions of dollars are going?
Really? Are you that ignorant of an investor? Do you actually read through a company's SEC filings? Please
explain how millions of company funds disappearing into a black hole can in any way improve the margin of a
company (If you are unable to identify where the money went, then yes, to me that is a black hole). Must be a
new revolutionary business model no one is aware of.


More to the point, if a company's executives/directors are using COMPANY CASH for questionable
"investments" that are not properly disclosed in the SEC filings, then can you really say they have the
shareholders best interest in mind when it comes to running the company? 
- Just a little note/clue for you. Warren Buffett gives considerable weight to the management of a company he
is thinking of investing in. I'm not so sure he would invest in a company where the executives/directors might
be using company funds for their own personal benefit.

Regarding CGA, did you actually read the report questioning the taxes paid and the questioned land
purchase amount?  
- IF you did read it, and still did not wonder about the discrepancy, then you really must have "horse-blinders"
on, and only see what you want to see.


So CGA answered the allegations today? Are you saying their responses a couple months ago were incorrect
and their responses today were corrections to their previous responses? Or are you saying CGA didn't really
respond to the questions of accounting and taxes paid a couple of months ago. I'm sorry, but that just makes
me laugh. Please clarify what you are trying to say.


So, as far as the "financial terrorism", does that mean the SEC will be investigating all the law firms that are
currently filing lawsuits against the questionable Chinese companies? 
- Note for you: as I'm sure you must know, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 basically
states a lawsuit CANNOT proceed without having facts-in-hand which STRONGLY SUGGEST DELIBERATE
FRAUD.


Your comments would imply YOU are actually quite knowledgeable in matters of accounting: 
"Weak hands and people who do not understand accounting are getting hurt and losing money." 
- So if you are knowledgeable and understand accounting, please provide FACTS which disprove what has
been stated by the author of this article.  
Otherwise, your comment(s) do not provide any significant insight into the questions surrounding CGA.

I read about CGA's accounting frauds from mr Little.  
OK. Can I check all these accusations? 
No.  
So, everyone can say anything. 
Can say CGA did this... did that.... blah.... blah.... blah...


I know that: Mootley Fool had sent a team to China and after their visit there, they recomend strongly CGA. I learn
abou CGA from MF. I can read their basic Balance Sheet and Profits Statement from wherever are available (for
examble from yahoo!finance). And CGA shows outstanding growth! That is a FACT. 
Can anyone deny that MF's team went in China and recomend CGA? Can anyone deny that CGA's profits statements
shows all that sales and profit growth? No!


I live in Greece and I can not travel to China, to see if all these accusations of mr Little and some other dudes, are
real because such a trip is very expensive. ... and as you know, here in Greece, we are bankrupt.

But just because I live in Greece, that is a country full of corrupt crooks, I have the experience to recognize them. 
Let's go to mr Little: he recites some accounting type accusations for CGA. Can I check if all these are true? I can not
check them. And I do not consider myself to be silly. I guess I have above average IQ. 
So, mr Little's accusations are not facts... are just rumors, maybe true, maybe false. 
But I wonder what is the "background" of mr Little, that seems to be so well informed. This is something I can check
out. I just google it.... And gues what? I found nothing.  
So I can rightly wonder: Is mr Little really exist? If yes, where are his internet traces??? 
I google him in every way: 
"Alfred Little, accountant", "Alfred Little, SAB Consultants", etc, etc, etc.... 
NOTHING. 
So, I think it's logical to assume that if mr Little really existed, I should have found something. But no... zero.... 0! 
So what does it remain? The logical conclusion is that mr Alfred Little is just a nickname. He is not real. If he is real,
lets show us his internet traces for himself and SAB Consultants.


Furthermore, if all these accusations were true, why US market authorities (and chinese market authorities) are not
have intervened so far? Why??? 
Why mr Little does not answer to my reasonable questions? When in everything else, he is like a singing bird??? 
Don't you wonder about it?

The credentials of the company are at issue not the credentials of Mr Little, Motley Fool, or the Greek
government. Lets presume for the sake of argument that Alfred is a Nazi war criminal who cooked
Lithuanians on his barbie. He hasn't paid taxes in forty years and uses the N word. He can't add, subtract or
divide.


With that set of facts does it change one iota of the charges he makes? Don't you feel better now that you
know undisputed facts are being shared with you by Boris Badanov? Your problem is that you waste you time
with extraneous items while the fact you are being robbed escapes your diverted attention. Why don't you
start doing some research on the company? Can you use your own judgment to evaluate a company or are
you addled by wearing your fool's cap too tight? Not to be unkind, but MF is in the business of selling lame
newsletters to lame investors.

What are you saying Waldo? That the credentials of mr Little are not important? 
As I said before, I am not an auditor nor an accountant, so I can not check mr Little's accusations for CGA. Noone
with no accountant knowledge, can follow mr Little's thought.  
But I can check mr Little's "background", to see if he is trustworthy. And from this research, I found absolutely nothing
for him and SAB Consultants.  
This makes me believe, not only that mr Little is not trustworthy, but also that he is nonexistent. Someone or - better -

a team "attacks" CGA to make some kind of profit (short selling etc). 
So the only lame here, seems to be the one who make the accusations.


I won't bite it and I'll keep my CGAs shares.

Presume I was driving Bernie Madoff to prison and he told me that he knew the bridge ahead was out. Do I
speed up because he is a convicted felon or do I slow down and take a look?


You are focusing on the meaningless. Keep the CGA. The bridge is out. Look at the pictures
seekingalpha.com/insta... You don't need to be an accountant to see that the story doesn't add up.

As I wrote there, OK, you give some pictures of CGA's plants and factories. How do I know that these pictures you put
for CGA, are real and not fakes?


By the way, did you see CGA's latest results?


Q1 FY2011 ... Q1 FY2010 ... CHANGE* 
Net Sales $39.5 million over $11.3 million +250.1% 
Gross Profit $13.1 million over $7.0 million +88.8% 
Net Income $7.8 million over $5.2 million +48.4% 
EPS (Basic and Fully Diluted) $0.30 over $0.24 + 23.9%

And you suspect that full color photos that clearly are the same interior space as shown by CGA have been
doctored? But you are just giddy anxious to accept the reported numbers? With absolutely nothing to support
them.


Apparently logic as well as accounting is not your forte.

I'm not sure if the photos are of the same interior space. 
I can not be sure, even if photos are real, if there is an other logical explanation, like moving a product line
from a place to another.

So those photos (myth vs reality) can not convince me. 
Especially nowadays with Photoshop, that makes "miracles".


Waldo, if Madoff told me that a company is a fraud, I wouldn't trust him. It's not the same with the examble
you gave, that if he told me that he knew the bridge ahead was out.  
Because in the examble you gave Madoff and every other "Madoff", would have nothing to gain. If he was in
the same car, he would be in danger too. 
But in our case (CGA accusations) "Madoff" mr Little HAS to gain, he can have profit from panic and
speculation to CGA. So his own interest, plus his trustworthless (Little seems to be a fake person, with no
internet traces about him and his company SAB Consultants), makes me believe that all this story is a fake. 
Who is mr Little who is concerned about my wealth???


When ancient Greeks conquered Troy, they hide beside Troy's bay and left a big wooden horse, supposed to
be a gift to Poseidon. Inside the wooden horse, they were hidden some Greeks, the Troyans took the Horse
inside Troy and when everybody slept, the Greeks got out of the Horse, opened the Gates and the whole
Greek Army got inside the city of Troy.  
But someone of the Troyans tried to warn his fellow citizens before the disaster. He said "Afraid of the Greeks,
even they are bearing gifts".


In the same way "Afraid of mr Little, even he is bearing gifts". 
He is trustworthless! .-
