INDUSTRY:  Retail
NYSE: TEA


Starbucks recently agreed to pay $620 million in cash to acquire TEAVANA (“Teavana” or the 


“Company”), a specialty retailer of loose-leaf teas, tea wares, and tea related merchandise in North 


America.  Teavana tells its customers that its teas are pesticide free.  As consumers of Teavana’s 


high-priced teas, we decided to investigate such claims.  What we found is shocking.  


Independent laboratory tests show that Teavana’s teas contain pesticides in amounts that
exceed US and EU regulatory limits.  In our opinion, not only are lawsuits from the Federal 


Trade Commission and class-action attorneys inevitable, but once Starbucks learns that they have 


been deceived into paying a premium price for a tarnished consumer brand, they will walk away 


from the acquisition.  


1. Selling the Healthy Lifestyle.  Teavana’s brand is built on the perception that Teavana’s teas 


are healthier than other teas because they are pesticide free.  The Company states in its SEC


filings that it rigorously tests every batch of tea under EU pesticide standards. 98% of the 


salespeople at the 80 retail stores we called stated unequivocally that the Company’s teas are 


pesticide free.  Watch our video (available here) for recordings of some of the phone calls.  


2. Independent Lab Tests Indicate Consumer Fraud.  As consumers of Teavana’s premium 


priced teas, we wanted to make sure we were drinking teas that are as healthy as the Company 


claims.  So we sent thirteen of Teavana’s most popular teas to an accredited lab in 


Germany for testing.  The lab is the world leader in food, pharmacological and environmental 


laboratory testing.  Lab tests showed the following:


a. Pesticides Abound.  100% of the tea samples contained pesticides, many of which are 


classified by the EPA as Possible Human Carcinogens. One of Teavana’s most popular 


and expensive teas, Monkey Picked Oolong, was the most contaminated with 23 
pesticides.  


b. Teas Violate US Law.  100% of the tea samples violate U.S. food pesticide standards 


(CFR Title 40 sect 180), meaning they are ‘adulterated’ under the FDCA and subject to 


federal seizure.  We believe Teavana will recall its adulterated teas rather than risk the


civil and criminal liability it may incur by knowingly selling adulterated products over 


Black Friday weekend. 


c. Broad Failure of EU Pesticide Tests.  Contrary to Teavana's representations in its 


SEC filings, 77% of the tea samples failed the European Union pesticide import 


standards (EC 396/2005) for dry teas, meaning that such teas would be banned from 


sale to consumers in the European Union.  


d. Banned Pesticides.  62% of teas tested showed traces of the pesticide Endosulfan, 


which has been banned by the US, China, the EU and 144 other countries because its 


use may impair fertility, cause harm to unborn children and other damage to 


agricultural workers.

3. Falsely Claiming Teas are “Organic” or “European Organic.” The majority of Teavana


sales representatives we called told us that all of Teavana’s teas were either “Organic” or 


“European Organic.”  This is another lie.  Teavana’s teas (with one exception) are not 


certified EU organic or certified USDA organic, nor would they qualify.


4. Starbucks Will Likely Walk Away.  We believe that like Teavana’s customers, Starbucks 


has been deceived by Teavana’s misrepresentations regarding the quality of its teas.  We 


believe that Starbucks’ board has a fiduciary duty to walk away from the transaction for the 
following reasons:


a. Inferior Tea Quality.  We tested Starbucks’ Tazo teas as a basis for comparison, and 


the lab results show Tazo teas are of far higher quality.  On average, the Teavana


samples were priced at a 368% premium to Tazo samples despite containing 3 times 


the number of pesticides. Like Teavana customers, Starbucks is paying a premium 


price for an inferior product.


b. Starbucks is Buying a Massive Liability.  We believe that Teavana’s marketing 


practices violate the Federal Trade Act and state consumer protection laws that 


prohibit deceptive marketing.  Such deceptive sales practices will likely lead to a 


consumer-fraud class action lawsuit against the Company as well as FTC and state-


level enforcement actions. Teavana also made false statements in its SEC filings by 


stating that every batch of tea met EU pesticide standards. Starbucks’ shareholders


would have no interest in defending the myriad of lawsuits Teavana is likely to 
face as a result of such misrepresentations.


c. Hurt Starbucks’ Brand.  Starbucks’ global brand is built on a reputation for the 


“finest coffee in the world, legendary customer service and the highest integrity…” By 


acquiring a retailer that is lying to its customers and selling teas that violate both EU 


and US standards, customers and regulators may start to question Starbucks’ standards, 


practices and the quality of its coffees.  


d. Deal Rationale is Dead.  Starbucks sought to buy Teavana for its premium brand, 


global sourcing know-how, health and wellness image, growth, and impressive unit 


economics. All of these attributes are built on the fiction that Teavana sells high-


quality teas that are free of pesticides.  Test results suggest that Teavana has been 


sourcing pesticide-laden teas of a lower quality than Starbucks’ own Tazo brand and 


that Teavana’s retail success is based in large part on getting customers to pay a 


massive premium for its teas because customers believe the teas are pesticide free 


and/or organic.


e. Teavana Breached the Merger Agreement.  In our opinion, Teavana breached 


numerous representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, giving Starbucks 
the grounds to walk away from the deal.  We encourage Starbucks, and any investor 


still holding a significant position in Teavana, to test the pesticide content of 


Teavana’s teas as we did.  Such tests can be completed in as little as 48 hours.  


f. Massive Overpayment.  We believe that the revelation that Teavana has been lying to 


its customers about the quality of its teas will destroy its brand, which is built on the 


perception that its teas are healthy and pesticide free. Without a premium brand, sales 


would plummet along with unit economics. Together with the costs of litigation arising 


out of the deception and a possible recall of teas violating US pesticide standards, we 


believe that Starbucks will walk rather than vastly overpay for an albatross.

SELLING THE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE


TEAVANA (“Teavana” or the “Company”) is a specialty retailer of loose-leaf teas, tea wares, and tea 
related merchandise in North America, which it sells through 300 Company-owned retail stores and 
through its website (www.Teavana.com). Approximately sixty percent of Teavana’s sales (and the vast 
majority of the Company’s profits) come from the sale of loose-leaf teas. 


On November 14, 2012, Starbucks signed a deal to acquire Teavana for $620 million in cash.  Starbucks 
Chairman Howard Schultz said that its proposed acquisition was driven by “Teavana’s world-class tea 
authority, coupled with the romance and theater of the retail experience that is the heart and soul of the 
Starbucks heritage.”   


We have been Teavana customers for over 2 years.  Even though Teavana’s teas are very expensive, we 
drank them because, like Starbucks, we believed that Teavana’s teas are of the highest quality, are healthy 
and do not contain pesticides. 


Teavana tells this same story to investors. The Company states in its SEC filings “our teas undergo 
rigorous testing based on food safety specifications established by European Union regulations for the 
presence of pesticides. We use a third-party testing program that samples each batch at our distribution 
center.”


We placed 80 phone calls to Teavana retail stores in 19 states and to its toll free customer support line.  
We called as a customer inquiring about the quality of Teavana’s tea.   


In 98% of the phone calls we placed, Teavana’s salespersons declared without qualification that the 
Company’s teas were pesticide free. Only one sales associate told us that the Company’s teas may 
contain pesticides, and one other salesperson told us that she did not know the pesticide content of the 
teas.

The transcript from one call to Teavana’s customer service hotline is representative of the Company’s 
sales strategy:


Investigator: “[My aunt] is a super health nut, are your teas organic or not organic?”


Teavana Salesperson: “Classified organic, no. But with all of the teas that we do carry, we do test 
them rigorously to make sure that they are as natural as they can possibly be.  I can attest that 
none of the gardens use preservatives or pesticides, nothing is genetically modified.”  
Anything of that area.  As far as the testing that they go through, of course, they go through FDA, 
but we also have the European Union inspect the teas as well.  So overall, they each go through 
about 155 points of inspection, and once they pass that we can sell them.”


Investigator: “and they are all guaranteed to be 100% pesticide free.”


Teavana Salesperson: “Yes, absolutely.”


We called 80 stores in 19 states because we wanted to make sure it was not a rogue employee 
misrepresenting the qualities of the product to make a sale.  Rather, there was a clear pattern suggesting 
that salespersons were instructed by the Company to tell customers that its teas were pesticide free and 
met EU pesticide standards.  


But do not just take our word for it. On our website we posted a video in which you can listen to a 
selection of our phone calls with Teavana salespeople around the country.  Salespersons from Alaska to 
Texas and New York to Georgia had a consistent response to our question, indicating that Teavana
employees have been trained by the Company to tell customers that its products are pesticide free.  
This is an outright lie.


METHODOLOGY 


We were initially curious about Teavana’s claim that its teas did not contain pesticides simply because 
Teavana, like most tea companies, sources the vast majority of its tea leaves from China, Japan and India.  
The use of pesticides (even banned pesticides) to increase yield by growers in Asia is rampant due to a 
multitude a factors, including the absence of regulations, under-enforcement of existing rules and run-of-
the-mill corruption.1


To verify whether Teavana was telling the truth, we purchased thirteen different popular brands of its
tea, which cost roughly $1,000, from three retail stores (NY, IL and CA), including the very same store 
on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan that impressed Starbucks CEO and Chairman Howard Schultz. At no 
time did we take possession of any of the samples. Instead, we had the stores pack and ship the samples
in sealed store-bought metal cans directly to an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited and independent laboratory for 
testing.


It is important to note that at no time did our investigators touch or handle the tea samples.  Rather, our 
buyers went to the stores and watched as Teavana employees scooped the loose-leaf tea into storage 
containers provided by the Company.  Teavana employees then placed all the samples in a box, which

was picked up by UPS directly from the store.  At no point did any of our buyers leave the store with the 
tea or handle the tea in any way.  


We had the samples sent to an independent lab in Germany for testing because Teavana claims its teas are 
tested to European standards.  From its latest 10-K, available here, the Company states: 


In order to verify whether the Company was telling the truth, we measured pesticides by EU standards. 
Although we chose to keep the identity of the lab confidential, we have included copies of the lab reports 
in Annex I.  The test results are shocking.  


INDEPENDENT LAB TESTS INDICATE CONSUMER FRAUD


Independent lab tests indicate that many of Teavana’s teas are not pesticide free as the Company (and its 
sales reps) claims.  Not only were most of the samples laden with pesticides, but 77% of the pure tea 
samples failed the European Union tests (meaning they would not be permitted to be sold to EU 
consumers).  Further, many teas contained trace amounts of banned pesticides and pesticides that are 
classified by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as Possible Human Carcinogens.  


Here is a table of the results that show that the Company has been lying about the quality of its teas to 
consumers, investors and Starbucks.

www.glaucusresearch.comTEAVANA HOLDINGS, INC.   NYSE: TEA


1) Pesticides Abound


Independent laboratory tests show that every single pure tea we tested contained residues of 


pesticides.2  On average, the teas that we tested contained 11 pesticides.  In one of Teavana’s best-selling 
teas, the Monkey Picked Oolong tea, testing detected traces of 23 pesticides.    


Pesticides Detected in Each of Teavana’s Teas


In fact, most of Teavana’s teas contained even more pesticides than low-quality over-the-counter teas 
sold in Chinese supermarkets.  Recently, Greenpeace released a report (available here) in which it tested 
18 Chinese teas for pesticides.  On average, each over-the-counter Chinese tea contained eight pesticides;
whereas the Teavana teas we tested each contained an average of eleven pesticides. In other words, 
Teavana’s tea samples cost significantly more than dirty, generic tea that Greenpeace tested from Chinese 
supermarkets, despite having 40% more pesticides (on average).  


Teavana’s brand is built on its claim to have the “world’s finest tea.”  Company salespeople entice 
consumers to pay premium prices by telling them that Teavana’s teas do not contain pesticides.  Our 
testing shows this an outright lie.  


2) Tested Teas Violate FDA Standards and may be subject to recall.


According to an accredited and independent lab, the teas we tested contained so many pesticides that they 
would be deemed ‘adulterated’ food products under the FDCA. This means that the teas violate US 
pesticide standards.  The adulterated teas would thus be subject to seizure by the Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”).  We believe that the Company will not risk the consumer backlash or liability 
(civil and criminal) associated with knowingly selling adulterated products and thus will recall the 
offending teas (which are some of its most popular products).  Because many of the teas we tested are

also ingredients in at least nine other blended teas or gift sets, such a recall would likely include a 
significant portion of the Company’s products.


By law, the EPA is responsible for establishing ‘tolerances’ (i.e. maximum safe limits) for each pesticide 
based on the potential risk to human health posed by the chemical. The FDA enforces such tolerances for 
non-poultry/beef products such as tea to ensure that the nation's food supply is maintained safely at all 
times.


Under Section 402, Title 342(a)(2)(B) and Section 406, Title 346(a)(1) of the FDCA, a processed food or 
feed is considered to be adulterated and subject to FDA enforcement action if it contains pesticide 
residue for which there is no tolerance, tolerance exemption, or food additive regulation.


The following letter is a conclusion from the lab stating that all of Teavana’s pure tea samples violated 
US regulatory standards for pesticide residues in food.

All thirteen (100%) of Teavana samples, including many of its most popular teas, would be considered 
‘adulterated’ under FDA standards, which poses several serious risks for not only Teavana but also its 
prospective acquirer, Starbucks.  


The FDA has the discretion to seize or recall ‘adulterated’ food products, which would be a death knell 
for Teavana’s brand.  The FDA will typically recall in the event that a food product presents a danger to 
consumers.  We have no idea how dangerous the pesticides found in Teavana’s teas are to consumers so it 
is difficult to gauge the likelihood of a mandatory FDA recall.  


We think it is more likely that Teavana immediately recalls the pesticide-laden teas.  It is generally 


regulatory punishment if it continues to knowingly sell tea products that violate US pesticide 
standards.  In March 2011, Teavana voluntarily recalled over 2,600 lbs. of its Peppermint Organic 
Herbal Tea, because of potential salmonella contamination. 


We presume that Teavana executives would not sell adulterated food products over Black Friday 
weekend, which would risk alienating consumers and invite crushing lawsuits.  So we believe that 
Teavana will initiate a voluntary recall of many of its most popular teas.


3) Vast Majority of Teavana Tea Samples Failed EU Pesticide Tests


Teavana claims that all of its teas pass EU pesticide standards.  This is not true. 77% of the pure tea 
samples tested contained pesticide residues in excess of prescribed EU limits.  This means that such teas 
would be banned from sale in the European Union.3  


The EU prescribes limits for pesticide residues under European Commission regulation 396/2005.  
Readers can check the EU limits for dried tea leaves through the EU pesticide limit database, available 
online here. If pesticides are present in levels above such standards, such tea is banned from the EU.  


Not only did testing detect pesticides in excess of such limits in 77% of the samples, but Teavana’s 
Sencha Jade Reserve tea contained pesticides in concentrations 5600% above EU limits.  In the 
following charts, we show each pesticide that was present in excess of the EU’s prescribed limits and the 
percentage by which it was over the limit. 


                                                  
3 Although the test results from the two blended teas we tested were inconclusive, it is likely that such teas would 
have been admitted into the EU.

Teavana states in its SEC filings that its teas meet European pesticide standards.  In almost every call with 
Teavana’s retail stores, salespeople repeated this claim.  Judging by the teas we tested, this claim is not 
true: 10 of the 13 teas we tested contained pesticides in excess of prescribed EU limits, meaning such
teas would not be permitted to be imported for sale in the EU.  Not only is Teavana lying to customers, 
but it also appears that Teavana’s SEC filings contain material misrepresentations.

4) Teavana Teas Contained EPA Possible Carcinogens in Excess of EU Limits


Each pure tea sample contained traces of pesticides that are classified by the EPA as Possible 
Carcinogens;4 54% of these contained EPA potential carcinogens in excess of prescribed EU limits.


The following chart shows, for each tea tested, whether such tea contained traces of a possible carcinogen 
and if so, if such possible carcinogen was present in amounts exceeding the limits prescribed by the 
EU.  


Fipronil


Fipronil, a Group C Possible Human Carcinogen according to the EPA, exceeded EU limits in five of the
pure teas tested.  Monkey Picked Oolong stood out with a concentration of Fipronil at 45 times the 
limit, or 4400%.  The other four teas, which included Silver Yin Zhen Pearls, Black Dragon Pearl, 
Golden Jade, and Phoenix Mountain, exceeded their respective Fipronil limits by a range of 120% to 
380%, with an average of 265%, or around four times the EU’s legal limit.

www.glaucusresearch.comTEAVANA HOLDINGS, INC.   NYSE: TEA


According to the EPA, "the carcinogenic potential of Fipronil has been classified as a Group C, Possible 
Human Carcinogen, based on increases in thyroid follicular cell tumors in both sexes of the rat, which 
were statistically significant by both pair-wise and trend analyses.”5  


The Pesticide Action Network (“PAN”) reports that Fipronil is a toxic insecticide and a suspected 
endocrine disruptor.  According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, endocrine 
disruptors are chemicals that may interfere with the body’s endocrine system and produce adverse 
developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects.


We are not making any claims about the health effects to consumers of Fipronil or any of the pesticides 
discovered in Teavana’s tea: merely that for a company leveraging its sales off of a brand it characterizes 
as healthy and pesticide free, the presence of a possible carcinogen 45 times the claimed EU limits could
be hugely damaging to sales.  


Tebuconazole 


The EPA Class C Possible Human Carcinogen, Tebuconazole, exceeded EU limits in both of the Japanese 
teas tested - in the case of Gyokuro Imperial, by 200%, and Sencha Jade Reserve, by 1180%, which is 
around 12 times the limit.


According to PAN, Tebuconazole is a toxic fungicide with evidence of cancer in animal studies.  It is also 
like Fipronil, a suspected endocrine disruptor.  


Buprofezin


Buprofezin, which according to the EPA has suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, exceeded EU limits 
in 4 of 13 (31%) of pure teas tested.  According to PAN, Buprofezin is an insect growth regulator with 
evidence of cancer in animal studies.  


5) Teavana Teas Contained Trace Amounts of Internationally Banned Pesticide Endosulfan


Not only did the lab detect traces of pesticides that are possible human carcinogens, but eight of the 
thirteen teas tested contained traces of the banned pesticide Endosulfan. 


Endosulfan is particularly nasty, and has been linked to birth defects, mental retardation and cancer in 
agricultural workers who come into contact with the pesticide.6  In 2010, the EPA moved to ban the use 
of Endosulfan before 127 governments (including China) agreed to ban the pesticide at the 2011 
Stockholm Conference.

www.glaucusresearch.comTEAVANA HOLDINGS, INC.   NYSE: TEA


Child Victim Attributed to Endosulfan


Despite its horrific toxicity, Endosulfan is still used illegally China, a main supplier of Teavana’s tea 
leaves, which is why it is not surprising that it showed up on tests of Teavana’s teas.  


Even though Teavana’s samples only contained trace amounts of the highly toxic and banned pesticide 
(meaning we do not believe there is a health risk to consuming the tea due to Endosulfan traces alone), we 
believe that even a trace amount of a dangerous pesticide is significant for a Company whose brand is 
leveraged off of the perception that its teas are healthy, high-quality and pesticide free.  We also believe 
that, given the presumed effects of Endosulfan on famers and their families who are growing tea, 
consumer and activists groups could boycott Teavana if the Company continues to support this dreadful 
practice. 


NOT ORGANIC


The majority (55%) of the Teavana’s salespersons we called also stated that all of the Company’s teas 
were organic.  Twenty percent stated that the teas were organic without qualification, whereas 35% of 
salespersons stated that the teas were organic by European Union standards but not USDA certified 
organic.   This is also a lie.

www.glaucusresearch.comTEAVANA HOLDINGS, INC.   NYSE: TEA


Teavana only sells one USDA certified organic tea.  The rest of its teas are not certified EU or USDA 
organic.  In order to be classified as USDA or EU Organic, a tea must pass rigorous testing standards and 
be free of conventional pesticides and other additives.  It is illegal to market a product as organic unless it 
has passed such tests and unless either the USDA Organic or the EU Organic logo appears on the food 
packaging.7  To our knowledge, Teavana does not put such a logo on any of its products (except for one 
tea). Nor, based on the test results, do we believe that its teas could pass as either USDA or EU certified 
organic. 


Yet the majority of Teavana’s sales force lied to us by stating that its teas are either USDA organic or 
European organic. The perceived healthiness of its tea is a key driver of the Company’s sales and the 
reason why the Company can charge such a high price for its product. Teavana’s customers are health-
conscious, so it is no coincidence that salespersons pitch the Company’s teas as organic.  The trouble is 
that, like claims about the teas being pesticide free, claims that the teas are organic are lies.  


STARBUCKS WILL LIKELY WALK FROM THE ACQUISITION


We believe that like Teavana’s customers, Starbucks has been deceived by Teavana’s misrepresentations 
regarding the quality of its teas and will therefore likely walk away from the proposed acquisition. 


Teavana’s brand is built on the misperception that its teas are healthy because they are pesticide free.  
This allows the Company to charge customers above-average prices for tea (368% above our 
Starbucks Tazo tea samples).  We believe that as soon as customers discover that they are paying 
premium prices for pesticide-laden teas, Teavana’s brand will be tarnished and its sales will plummet.


We were naively happy customers of Teavana for two years.  During that time we paid substantially
more money because we were told the teas were pesticide free and/or organic.  We will never go 
back.  And we suspect that we are not alone.  


With the revelation that Teavana has been lying to its customers about the quality of its teas, there are a 
host of reasons that Starbucks should walk away from the deal: 


1. Teavana Teas are Inferior to Starbucks Teas


Starbucks wants to buy Teavana because of the Company’s “leading premium retail brand.” Yet this is a 
mere fiction.  We tested Starbucks’ Tazo teas for pesticides as a basis of comparison, and found that Tazo
samples contained far fewer pesticides and appeared to be much higher quality than Teavana’s samples.

www.glaucusresearch.comTEAVANA HOLDINGS, INC.   NYSE: TEA


Despite being nearly 5 times more expensive than Tazo teas, the Teavana teas we tested appear to be far 
worse in quality. Teavana teas contained an average of 11 pesticides whereas Tazo teas contained less 
than 4.  Even though Starbucks does not tell its customers that its teas are compliant with EU pesticide 
standards, Tazo teas samples were substantially closer to meeting EU standards than those of 
Teavana.  


Furthermore, according to Starbucks, a key rational for the acquisition was Teavana’s perceived ability to 
source large amounts of high quality teas from growers around the world.  Test results suggest that this 
perception is a fiction.  It appears that Starbucks’ Tazo tea purchasers are already much better at sourcing 
high quality teas than Teavana’s purchasers.  


In short, independent lab tests suggest that Starbucks is paying a premium price for a business that sells 
products inferior to their own Tazo tea. 


2. Starbucks Will Not Purchase a Massive Liability


Teavana is misleading customers about the health properties of its teas, which will likely result in 
expensive and prolonged litigation. The Federal Trade Commission Act forbids material false and

mislead consumers, acting reasonably under the circumstances, in a material respect”).

misleading statements in promoting consumer products.8  Recently, the Federal Trade Commission has 
been aggressive in protecting consumers, in some cases asking courts to disgorge the profits gained by 
companies guilty of deceptive practices.9


The USDA has also been active in suing companies that misrepresent their products as certified organic.  
Recently, the USDA fined a milk producer $7.5 million for fraudulent marketing claims in connection 
with the sale of organic milk.  A majority of Teavana’s salespeople misrepresent that all of its teas are 
organic (either US or EU), making the Company a prime target for a USDA lawsuit.   


There is also evidence that Teavana’s SEC filings contain material false statements.  The Company
states in its SEC filings “our teas undergo rigorous testing based on food safety specifications established 
by European Union regulations for the presence of pesticides. We use a third-party testing program 
that samples each batch at our distribution center.”  Yet 77% of teas we tested failed EU standards, 
suggesting that Teavana was materially misrepresenting its quality control standards in its SEC 


filings.  


In addition, nearly every state in which Teavana sells tea has robust consumer protection laws that 
prohibit deceptive marketing claims.  For example, Georgia, which is Teavana’s home state, passed the 
Fair Business Practices Act (O.C.G.A. Sections 10-1-390 et seq.), which makes it unlawful to falsely 
claim that goods or services are of a particular grade.  


By marketing its products as pesticide free or organic when they are not, Teavana violates the Federal 
Trade Commission Act, Georgia’s consumer protection laws and, we expect, the consumer protection 
laws of every state in which it sells tea.  We believe that such blatant violations make a class action 
lawsuit against the Company inevitable, and also present the material risk of civil prosecution by the state 
regulators and/or the Federal Trade Commission.


In purchasing Teavana, Starbucks will likely face a myriad of lawsuits by regulators, state attorney 
generals and plaintiffs attorneys on behalf of customers who were lied to about the pesticide content of 
Teavana teas.  Starbucks has a choice of how this will play out: The People vs. Teavana or The People
vs. Starbucks.  We think Starbucks will choose the former and walk away from the deal.  


3. Teavana’s Stink Will Rub Off On Starbucks’ Brand


Starbucks global brand is built on a reputation for “finest coffee in the world, legendary customer service 
and the highest integrity….” 


A letter from Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz features prominently on the Company’s website in 
which he states that: “a commitment to integrity, acting honestly and ethically, and complying with the 
letter and intent of the law are critical to our continued success.”


Schultz letter goes on to list the principles of Starbucks coffee, which include “sourcing the finest coffee 
beans and the people who grow them.”  Contrast this with Teavana, a business that sources pesticide-
laden teas containing traces of the globally banned pesticide Endosulfan, which is notoriously dangerous 
to agricultural workers.

Schultz also states that another core principle is the “human connection” between the business and its 
customers.  The Starbucks manual goes on to state unequivocally that “our communications with our 
customers or potential customers must be truthful and accurate.”  Such principles of honesty, integrity and 
customer service appear vapid if the Company decides to reward Teavana’s insiders who grew a brand 
based on a core misrepresentation to customers.  


We realize Starbucks is running a business, but Schultz and Starbucks management know that their 
business was built on the foundation of core principles that he espouses.  Buying a retailer that is lying to 
its customers and selling teas that violate of both EU and US standards risks tarnishing a brand that 
Starbucks has taken decades to build. 


Can Starbucks handle allegations (and litigation) about inferior quality teas and blatant lies to customers 
without customers questioning the quality of its coffees?  What happens to Starbucks’ brand if customers 
assume that Starbucks follows the same practices as Teavana? 


4. Deal Rationale is Dead


Starbucks laid out its rationale for acquiring Teavana.  In the following table, we look at each reason and 
give our opinion as to whether it still stands.


The reasons for acquiring Teavana are no longer valid.  Will Starbucks’ shareholders and board of 
directors allow the Company to sink more time and money into a distracting and potentially destructive 
acquisition given that Teavana’s brand is in jeopardy and Starbucks can apparently source better quality 
tea through their own Tazo business unit? 


Strategic Rationale Reality


Teavana is a leading premium tea brand Teavana's teas are inferior to Tazo teas.  Tests indicate that they are 
laden with pesticides and routinely fail EU pesticide standards. 


World class tea authority with global sourcing 
capabilities


Teavana actually struggles to source quality teas.  It appears, based 
on independent lab tests, that Starbucks' Tazo unit is better at 
sourcing quality teas than Teavana's purchasers. 


Meaningful addition to building out Starbucks' 
health and wellness platform


Teavana is likely to face a myriad of lawsuits for lying to customers 
about the health quality of its teas.  


Domestic and global growth vehicle with 
adjacent business


We believe Teavana's brand will stagnate, not grow, when 
customers learn that the Company has been lying to them about the 
pesticide content of the teas.  


 Healthy unit economics Teavana's phenomenal unit economics are built on its ability to sell 
teas for 365% more than Starbucks because customers believe they 
are paying a premium for pesticide free and/or organic tea.  When 
customers learn that this is a lie, we believe Teavana's price will 
normalize, dramatically undermining the unit economics of its 
operation. 


Catalyst to accelerating Starbucks' tea strategy Starbucks will be mired in litigation and is buying a brand that will 
wither on the vine.

5. Teavana Breached the Merger Agreement


On November 14, 2012, Starbucks and Teavana Holdings, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of 
Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) (available here) to acquire Teavana for $620 million in cash.  Based on 
our review of the contract and independent lab results, we believe that Teavana has breached numerous 
representations in the contract:10


Although a Material Adverse Effect standard qualifies Starbucks’ right to walk away from the transaction 
for a breach of the above warranties, we believe Teavana’s conduct easily meets this difficult standard.

Contract Rep Rep Language Rep Breach


3.01(e)


None of the SEC Documents at the time it 
was filed or furnished contained any untrue 
statement of a material fact 


Teavana stated in SEC filings that each batch of tea is 
tested by European Union regulations for the 
presence of pesticides.  Yet 77% of Teavana’s tea 
samples that we tested contained pesticide residues in 
amounts over EU limits, meaning that Teavana’s SEC 
filings contained materially false statements as to the 
quality of its tea.  


3.01(r)(i)(A)


Each of the food and beverage products 
produced, distributed or sold by the 
Company … are at all times formulated, 
manufactured, processed, labeled, stored, 
tested, packed, transported, distributed, 
marketed, advertised and promoted by the 


Company with all applicable requirements 
under the FDCA and all other applicable 
laws (including, the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, state unfair competition 
and deceptive trade practices statutes and 
all comparable laws.  


Teavana tells customers that its teas are pesticide free 
when they are not.  This is deceptive marketing and 
violates the FTCA and state consumer protection 
laws. 


3.01(r)(i)(B)


Food products have not been adulterated or 
misbranded within the meaning of the FDCA 
or of any comparable state, local or foreign 
statute or regulation, nor are they now, or at 
any time have they been, products that may 
not, under Section 404, 505 or 512 of the 
FDCA (to the extent applicable) be 
introduced into United States commerce.


Teavana's teas are adulterated under the FDCA 
because they contain pesticides for which no 
tolerance has been established.  Teavana sells such 
teas in interstate commerce, so we believe that the 
Company violates both prongs of the rep. 


3.01(r)(vi)


there exists, and has existed at all relevant 
times, substantiation meeting the standards 
of all relevant regulatory bodies for any and 


all claims about the beneficial effects of any 
of the products produced, distributed or 
sold by the Company and any of its 
Subsidiaries.


Teavana tells customers that its teas are healthy and 
high quality because they are pesticide free.  This is 
not true.

There is conclusive evidence that Teavana misrepresents the health qualities of its teas in order to induce 
such customers to pay a premium price for its products. We believe that as soon as customers learn that 
they are paying premium prices for pesticide-laden teas, Teavana’s brand will be tarnished and its sales 
will plummet.


6. Massive Overpayment for a Shoddy Brand


Teavana sells a commoditized product at a premium price because its customers perceive (misperceive) 
that its teas are healthy and pesticide free.  We are not claiming Teavana’s teas are dangerous to 
consumers.  But Teavana’s brand is built on the critical misrepresentation that its teas are pesticide free 
and that its teas meet the EU’s pesticide testing standards.  Based on our testing, we believe this is not 
true.   


Ultimately, we think that the potential damage to Teavana’s brand could be fatal.  Consumers do not like 
to be deceived, especially consumers who go out of their way to find a specialty retail store to buy a 
product that they believe is healthier than the supermarket alternative. For supermarket quality, 
customers will pay supermarket prices. 


Without a premium brand, sales would plummet and unit economics would nosedive. There is a very 
real possibility that Teavana's Q4 sales drop by 25% or more as customers wise up.  Starbucks must 
also consider that customers who bought Teavana’s teas thinking that they were pesticide free may soon 
return them.  Together with the costs of litigation arising out of the deception and a possible recall of teas 
violating US pesticide standards, Starbucks is vastly overpaying for an albatross.  


We encourage Starbucks, and any investor still holding a significant position in Teavana, to test the 
pesticide content of Teavana’s teas as we did.  Such tests can be completed in as little as 48 hours.  We 
are confident they will find the same thing.  Starbucks should not rely on samples provided by Teavana
but should go to the store themselves.  


We believe that Starbucks was deceived, and that when this deception is verified, Starbucks will walk 
away from the acquisition.

CONCLUSION: 
 
The analysed sample contains a residue of Anthrachinon with a concentration of  0.02 mg/kg, while the 
Maximum Residue Level (MRL)  according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 396/2005 for this crop is 
0.01 mg/kg.  
This MRL is not clearly exceeded considering an analytical variation of 50 %. 
 
The analysed sample contains a residue of Fipronil (sum) with a concentration of  0.011mg/kg, while the 
Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for this crop is 0.005 mg/kg.  
Even considering an analytical variation of 50 % the MRL is clearly exceeded. Therefore the analysed 
sample is not in accordance with regulation (EC) 396/2005 (regulation on maximum residue levels in food 
and feed).

CONCLUSION: 
 
The analysed sample contains a residue of Fenobucarb with a concentration of 0.03 mg/kg, while the 
Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for this crop is 0.01 mg/kg.  
Even considering an analytical variation of 50 % the MRL is clearly exceeded. Therefore the analysed 
sample is not in accordance with regulation (EC) 396/2005 (regulation on maximum residue levels in food 
and feed).

Note: Currently we observe residues of Anthraquinone as result of carry-over processes from packaging material to 
the food. Therefore it is highly recommended to find the source of the contamination of Anthraquinone to the 
analysed sample before a final conclusion should be made.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
The analysed sample contains residues of several pesticides as mentioned above with concentrations 
which exceed the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for this crop. 
Even considering an analytical variation of 50 % the MRLs are clearly exceeded. Therefore the analysed 
sample is not in accordance with regulation (EC) 396/2005 (regulation on maximum residue levels in food 
and feed).

CONCLUSION: 
 
The analysed sample contains residues of several pesticides as mentioned above with concentrations 
which exceed the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for this crop. 
Even considering an analytical variation of 50 % the MRLs are clearly exceeded. Therefore the analysed 
sample is not in accordance with regulation (EC) 396/2005 (regulation on maximum residue levels in food 
and feed).
