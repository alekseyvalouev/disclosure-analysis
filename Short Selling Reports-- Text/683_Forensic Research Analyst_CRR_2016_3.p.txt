CARBO Ceramics: Is The Final Nail In The Coffin?
Oct. 18, 2016 11:03 AM ET36 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


FracFocus data appears to confirm that COP and CLR, CRR’s previous largest E&P
customers, have indeed abandoned ceramics in the Bakken at the beginning of
2016.


HAL, the largest Bakken oil field services supplier that historically completed many
COP and CLR wells, also recently terminated its long-term supply arrangement with
CRR.


Partly as a result of the customer loss, CRR missed Consensus revenue estimates
by 16% as the business ground to a halt in 2Q16.


Despite the benefit from a seasonal “bump” in the upcoming 3Q, we forecast
continued and sustained free cash flow burn at CRR despite Management’s claims
that the business is turning.


CRR’s emergency plan to shore up liquidity, now including a $75MM ATM equity
issuance facility, is highly likely to only delay rather than avert a bankruptcy filing in
our view.


In our 7/29/15 note, Ceramic Proppant Is Going to Zero, we argued that the decline in
CARBO Ceramics Inc.'s (NYSE:CRR) sales volume was secular rather than cyclical. As of
2Q15, CRR's ceramic proppant volumes had already fallen 58% YoY as the price of oil
had fallen ~50%.


With CRR's 2Q16 report on 7/28/16, we now know that while the price of oil only fell
another 21% from the average of 2Q15 ($58 per barrel) to 2Q16 ($46 per barrel), CRR's
ceramic sales volume fell another 58% YoY to only 71MM pounds (down 87% from the
peak in 3Q13). The quarter-over-quarter comparison is also compelling: The price of WTI
oil rose 36% from 1Q16 to 2Q16 (from $34 to $46 per barrel), yet CRR's sales volume fell
41% quarter over quarter in what is typically a seasonally stronger second quarter.

In our 3/18/16 note, Carbo Ceramics: Will You Take the Bait?, we presented a detailed
operator level analysis of how CRR's largest E&P customers were structurally shifting
away from ceramics to sand-based completions. We further warned investors not to be
fooled by the prospect for an equity offering when CRR's long-term earnings power would
be a decidedly negative number.


With the 2Q16 earnings release, investors were greeted to another large negative FCF
quarter and a $75MM at-the-money (ATM) equity offering courtesy of the Cowen Group
(NASDAQ:COWN). COWN will earn 3% of gross sales proceeds, or a sum of up to
$2.25MM, for placing CRR shares with investors.


On the 1Q16 earnings call, Gary Kolstad provided the following 2Q16 cash flow guidance:


Although we plan to reduce costs further, the operating outlook may likely deteriorate
in the coming quarters and, as such, our near-term quarterly cash burn could remain
in the low- to mid-teens.


However, actual cash burn in 2Q16 was $20.1MM. If we assume the mid-point of "low-to
mid-teens" means $14MM, the actual cash burn figure represents a miss of 44% versus
the midpoint of CRR guidance provided just a few months prior. CRR missed its cash burn
target while spending only $351k of capex in the quarter, calling into question
management's visibility on its own business fundamentals.


Investors may not have realized the cash burn was so high since the 2Q16 cash balance
was obfuscated by two one-time items: (1) a $37.5MM tax refund and (2) a $25MM
infusion from a related party loan. Absent those two one-time items, we believe CRR

would already be in violation of its minimum liquidity covenant and potentially already
commencing bankruptcy proceedings.


On the 2Q16 earnings call, Mr. Kolstad made the following statement:


In the second quarter, we appeared to have hit the low point at the beginning of the
quarter and saw monthly improvements as the quarter progressed, following a
stabilizing rig count, modest commodity price increases and modest client activity
increases in completions. In addition, with the increasing commodity price, we have
received increasing customer inquiries about procuring ceramic proppant for
completions in the second half of 2016.


Despite claims for improving cadence of monthly sales volumes, ceramic proppant volume
fell 41% quarter-over-quarter in 2Q16 despite the fact that the price of WTI crude
increased 34% in 2Q16 on average, and the second quarter is historically a seasonally
stronger quarter than the first quarter. Furthermore, with respect to the third quarter, we
believe "customer inquiries" is a non-meaningful metric and does not correlate to actual
sales or even backlog.


CRR sold such a small amount of ceramics in the second quarter that volumes almost
have to increase sequentially in the third quarter, which is typically the seasonally
strongest quarter anyways. The tone of the CRR 2Q16 earnings call and press release
would have one believing the ceramic proppant market is experiencing green shoots and
the market recovery is just around the corner. This is decidedly not the case in our view.

In "Carbo Ceramics: Will You Take the Bait?", we argued that it appeared that CRR's two
largest customers, COP and CLR, were in the process of removing ceramics all together
from their completion budgets in 2016. At the time of the report, COP had reported its
latest two wells were all sand while CLR was still using ceramics to complete its Bakken
wells.


Our updated analysis using FracFocus reporting suggests that all COP and CLR wells
reported since our last report are indeed all sand, which supports our claim that these
E&Ps, up until now CRR's two largest E&P customers based on FracFocus data, have
switched to all sand-based completions.


Source: Fracfocus.org


E&Ps like COP and CLR do not necessarily buy proppant directly, but rather procure it
through their oil field service suppliers. From the above table, we can see that Halliburton
(NYSE:HAL) has the largest market share of COP's recent Bakken well completions, and
thus HAL itself would likely be the company buying ceramic proppant from CRR on behalf
of COP. According to CRR's 2Q16 10-Q, HAL and CRR have now terminated their long-
term contractual arrangement, which supports our FracFocus analysis that COP and CLR
have now stopped utilizing ceramics.


According to CRR's 2015 10-K:



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAL

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012826-carbo-ceramics-final-nail-coffin 5/20


Our largest customers are participants in the hydraulic fracturing industry.
Specifically, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. and Schlumberger Limited each
accounted for more than 10% of our 2015 and 2014 revenues.


Also attached to the CRR 2015 10-K, we see that HAL and CRR entered into Amendment
No. 5 to their 8/28/08 long-term Proppant Supply Agreement. HAL and CRR amended the
term of the agreement but blocked out the termination date with an "XXX" so that
investors could not see when expiration would occur:


According to the amended agreement, after the "XXX" date, HAL no longer has any
obligation to CRR. With the 2Q16 10-Q, we find Amendment No. 6 to the HAL/CRR
Proppant Supply Agreement, which was amended on June 30th, 2016. Amendment No. 6
states the following:


Thus, we believe the disclosure indicates that HAL has terminated its long-term proppant
supply agreement. We believe that the decision to terminate the agreement was likely
made at the beginning of the year, when COP and CLR appear to have made the
budgeting decision to remove ceramic proppant from their Bakken well completions.


The collapse in CRR's proppant sales volume in 1H16 (sales volume down 48% YoY
in 1H16 vs. 1H15), COP and CLR's switch to 100% sand well completions per
FracFocus disclosure as of the beginning of the year, and the termination of the
HAL Proppant Supply Agreement all support our belief that CRR lost its two largest
remaining E&P customers at the beginning of the year.


So if CRR may have lost its biggest remaining customers, how does the company
see an improvement in 3Q16? We believe it's likely just a dead cat bounce based on
seasonal tailing volumes.


Mr. Kolstad made the following claim on the 2Q16 earnings call:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012826-carbo-ceramics-final-nail-coffin 6/20


We're becoming more optimistic on the industry operating environment given that
the oil and natural gas commodity prices appear to have firmed. Communications
with our clients lead us to believe third quarter 2016 ceramic proppant sales will
increase from the second quarter.


Let's take a look at the Baker Hughes (BHI) oil rig count, which is reported weekly. While it
is true that the rig count has risen off the trough in May, the US average rig count was up
17% in the third quarter (390 rigs) versus the average for 2Q16 (334) and is still down
12% versus the 1Q16 average (442). More meaningfully for CRR, in the Bakken, the third
quarter rig count is up only 2.6 rigs to 27.6 versus the 25 rig average in 2Q16 and is still
down 29% from the 1Q16 average of 39 rigs. As we can see from the below chart, most of
the US rig count growth has come from the Permian basin where ceramics are only used
minimally for the occasional tailing.


Source: BHI Investor Relations


Furthermore, given the large scale customer loss that we have documented extensively in
our research on CRR, we believe that a structural shift away from ceramics has occurred
in the industry. Why else would HAL terminate its long-term supply agreement? Thus, in
our view, the rig count is no longer a meaningful indicator of ceramics demand anyways
since the vast majority of oil and gas completions are utilizing all sand (or occasionally,
resin coated sand).


We wonder how CRR can make the claim that "communications with our clients lead us to
believe 2016 ceramic proppant sales will increase from the second quarter" with a straight
face. 2Q16 proppant sales were so slow that there indeed should be a positive sequential
improvement from seasonal demand in 3Q16, especially since we believe COP and CLR,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012826-carbo-ceramics-final-nail-coffin 7/20


CRR's two largest customers, were already out of the ceramic proppant business by the
beginning of 2016 and thus sales to these customers would not be in the 2Q16 volume
figures.


Since, according to FracFocus, there are no longer any major E&Ps completing oil wells
with ceramics in the Bakken, the small amounts of ceramic volume we continue to see
from CRR relate to tailings and should thus be seasonal along with typical industry
completion patterns.


John Daniel of Simmons & Company attempted to shed some light on this issue in the
Q&A of the 2Q16 call:


Gary, we had a lot of chatter over the last couple years of people switching away
from ceramic, trying to take the lower-cost options. Some would say that they were
getting good results with the lower, with sand, et cetera. Have you had any
customers in the last several months or so come back to you and say, look, we're
going to start returning to ceramic, because we've now found that the value
proposition is better? Can you provide some color along that topic?


Gary Kolstad from CRR responded:


I think what's interesting for me is some of those clients that up until the last day held
out and they were still tailing in with ceramics until, let's say, the fourth quarter of last
year, the first quarter of this year, we see some of those folks starting up activity and
still tailing in with ceramic. And I think that's your best testament.


Mr. Kolstad's is saying that some customers are "still tailing in with ceramics," but cannot
point to any customers truly returning to ceramics for full well completions like they
historically did in the Bakken.


However, even if volumes increased sequentially by 200%, the total volume figure would
be below 3Q15 volume of 236MM pounds, and total CRR gross profit was still negative
$4.6MM in 3Q15, and yes, that figure includes the highly touted "technology" sales. Of
course, since 2015, CRR appears to have lost both COP and CLR as customers, so we
find it highly unlikely CRR will register anything near 236MM pounds of sales in the future.


CRR is once again guiding to unrealistic cash burn guidance


In the 3Q16 earnings call Q&A, Ernesto Bautista provided the following guidance:
5/19/2018 CARBO Ceramics: Is The Final Nail In The Coffin? - CARBO Ceramics Inc. (NYSE:CRR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012826-carbo-ceramics-final-nail-coffin 8/20


So for the quarter, it's probably, it's in the $20 million range. That was directly
impacted by some severance payments that we made that totaled about say, $4
million. So you're really back to that mid-teens range that we had talked about prior
quarter. Going forward and maybe focusing on second quarter, I am sorry, third
quarter, first of all, I think as we look forward, our cash burn picture would be
something in the low-double digits. We've done a lot to reduce costs. So we're
benefiting from that.


While CRR appears to have mastered the art of adding back seemingly recurring one-time
expenses, the company is admitting that 3Q16 was in the $20MM range nonetheless but
expects an improvement to "mid-teens" range in 3Q16. To calculate "mid teens," CRR
starts with $20MM of burn and adds back $4MM for one-time severance cash costs in the
quarter plus some benefit from cost reduction and seasonal volume uptick.


However, while above we outlined that CRR expects volumes to improve in 3Q16, we do
not believe that it is possible for cash burn to be reduced if volumes are going to increase,
since then CRR's working capital requirements will once again increase. Receivable days
have blown out to 97 days, up 40% sequentially and 13% YoY to an all-time high, and net
receivables have fallen to only $21.9MM.


Indeed, it appears the opposite of what CRR predicts is about to happen: we believe that
free cash flow burn may be about to accelerate. Since 4Q14, CRR has experienced a
$111MM cumulative free cash flow benefit from liquidating its receivable balance. If activity
actually increases, receivables will again become a usage-rather than a source- of cash,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012826-carbo-ceramics-final-nail-coffin 9/20


unless CRR is able to extract better payment terms from its customers even though today
CRR's customers are taking record long amounts of time to make payment. CRR
described this conundrum in its 2Q16 10-Q:


We generally supply our domestic pumping service customers with products on a
just- in- time basis, with transactions governed by individual purchase orders and/or
a master supply agreement. Because of their purchasing power, our key customers
may have greater bargaining leverage than us with respect to the negotiation of
prices and other terms of sale in their supply contracts with us, which could
adversely affect our profit margins associated with those contracts.


CRR makes the claim that ceramic pricing "has likely bottomed for base ceramic." This
claim may indeed be true. The problem is that pricing has settled at a level where CRR is
decidedly unprofitable. CRR generated gross profit of negative $20MM in 2Q16. We think
that CRR's addback of "slowing and idling production" costs to its negative gross profit
figure is misleading, as the underutilization of its asset base due to collapsing demand is
not a "one-time" expense.


On top of negative gross profit, CRR of course has SG&A expense. CRR has cut SG&A to
the bone but it remains a $10MM expense.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4012826-carbo-ceramics-final-nail-coffin 10/20


Next comes interest expense. As of 7/28/16 per the 10-Q, $58.9MM remains outstanding
on CRR's amended revolving credit facility at Libor + 7.00%. As of May 2016, CRR also
has $25MM of subordinated related party debt at a 7% cost. The combined debt balance
represents a ~$1.5MM cash expense each quarter.


Also, because CRR is losing so much money, the company is currently getting a ~35%
cash tax benefit on its losses. For conservatism, let's assume that CRR is able to continue
to get future tax refunds from the government as the company achieved in 2Q16.


Finally, while CRR cut capex to only $356k in 2Q16, in the 2Q16 10-Q, CRR tells us that it
expects to need to spend an additional $3MM in 2H16, which equates to $1.5MM per
quarter.


Therefore, we project CRR will burn ~$15-23MM per quarter absent any working capital
impact. If CRR does see an increase in activity, the company will have to build receivables
in advance of collecting its bills, which will cause cash burn to accelerate in the short term
as the working capital unwind reverses. The average accounts receivable cash flow
benefit CRR received from 4Q14 to 2Q16 was $16MM per quarter. Thus, we find CRR's
claim that cash burn will be "mid teens" while activity will increase at the same time
to be difficult to believe since if activity actually increased, near-term cash burn
could easily be double what CRR projects due to an increase in working capital
requirements. Remember, on the 1Q16 earnings call, CRR said cash burn going forward
would be "low to mid teens" and instead in 2Q16 cash burn was $20.4MM.

We have time for one more Kolstad quote from 2Q16:


The good news is that the industry has been working through the large inventories of
low-quality Chinese ceramic proppant that made its way into the States prior to the
severe downturn. The industry will recover, and today, we believe the U.S. ceramic
proppant suppliers can adequately produce and supply the domestic ceramic
proppant market with no need for the low-quality Chinese imports.


We believe the inverse of his statement is also true: The domestic ceramic proppant
industry has no need for domestic producers like CRR. The entire remaining industry,
which appears to be just a few million pounds of tailing demand, can be serviced by
Chinese imports. CRR has been talking about low quality Chinese imports for years, yet
the recurring inventory problem has never gone away, and we do not believe that it will go
away now that demand appears to have secularly tanked, meaning that the Chinese
ceramic proppant industry itself is even more oversupplied.


With the apparent loss of COP and CLR at the beginning of 2016, we believe that all
major Bakken E&Ps have officially ended ceramics completions.


As we argued on 3/18/16, absent an equity deal, we believed CRR would be in violation of
its covenants and potentially bankrupt before the end of 2016. We previously modeled a
$75MM primary equity raise and argued that even after completing this, CRR might still be
insolvent in 2017 or 2018.


Since our March note, CRR has amended its asset coverage covenant and replaced it
with a $40MM minimum liquidity covenant (so that the lenders are made whole prior to
CRR burning their remaining cash) and announced a $75MM ATM courtesy of Cowen
Group and a $25MM related party loan.


We believe that Cowen's efforts can only serve to only temporarily delay the inevitable. As
such, depending on the amount of equity raised via Cowen, we are now predicting a
bankruptcy filing in 4-8 quarters, with the range of outcomes dependent upon (1) the
amount of quarterly FCF burn (we forecast $14.8-22.6MM per quarter and (2) the success
(or lack thereof) of the Cowen ATM.

Weak secular argument. Activity will rebound cyclically with higher commodity prices.

Very nice article but wrong on many levels as the industry is dynamic. As Hal drops off others will buy the volume. You
also do not consider their industrial business or technology products or the fact that wilke brothers own so much and
also own their own Frac company.

Correct vicious361. The article is based on two customers. The article fails to look at the other basins, customers, and
Frac companies, let along the new technology and business segments Carbo works in. Article is based on a one
legged stool. I was concerned about Carbo but strong management, board backing company and big investment from
wilk brothers makes me think Carbo will be just fine and anyone invested while low will make nice gains by the end of
2017

Whenever I see a failing company there is someone in the comments who talks about strong management. If
the management was so strong, why didn't it foresee its product not being useful ahead of time and diversify
into a more useful product?


I'm not trying to start an argument or attack you. Its something I've seen and I don't get it. What makes "strong
management" in people's minds? Imo, its management that is one step ahead or management that can
handle abrupt changes. So far, CRR is sitting at all time lows and not showing any signs of improvement yet.


19 Oct 2016, 03:42 PM 


proppantman
When I refer to strong management, I am looking at managers that plan for the future and this management
team has done that with new technology in their current market space with kryptosphere, scaleguard. Carbo
air , and the holy grail of proppant you can see under ground. None of this was invented until this
management team came into place


I also see carbo looking at new markets in mining and foundry


A portion of their sales has to be new technology in order to get a favorable look from me. Carbo is leading
the charge in this area


So no argument from me, but I suggest you do your homework before your make a comment as you
obviously did not do your research


19 Oct 2016, 07:49 PM 


proppantman
After even further research Another case of good management would be the following: who would have ever
thought that ceramics would have been used in the Marcellus or Utica. It looks as if carbo management had
the vision to implement a plan in that basin before any other ceramic company. If you look at all the data from
2012 to present day. You see all the early wells and the top wells with carbo ceramics. I don't think this
happened by chance. They must have implemented a plan to show a value story and implemented and
supported with data to keep the market place using. Now if I look there are several ceramic companies being
used in the Marcellus and Utica. I think this is a prime example of carbo leading and that is attributed to
strong management

Interesting proppantman. Please give several examples of the Marcellus wells which have used ceramics?


I will go through the effort to then pull up the production of those specific wells, and some around them. I
would think that if you give me 3 Marcellus wells completed with ceramics, that would be enough.


Thanks.

Adsorb+Desorb
Thanks for the warning about Carbo Ceramics, and the Ceramic proppant industry in general.


proppantman, what are the other basins which are using Carbo products, and perhaps more telling, ceramics from
any supplier in significant numbers of completions?


"the article fails to look at the other basins, customers, and Frac companies,)


I had hope for Kryptosphere use in the deep Utica, but there is so much highly productive Marcellus, and somewhat
productive Upper Devonian, that the deep Utica is on the back burner for some drillers. Test wells, but not full
development programs. I think higher Natural Gas prices might help Deep Utica, but the reality will remain that when
drillers hold Utica by drilling Marcellus, they have to allocate their Capital to the highest return wells.


CNX which used some Ceramics in their Deep Utica well tests was indicating as recently as 09 2016 that their plan
was to save $1.1 Million per well by using resin coated proppant. I believe that EQT first used Ceramic, tried sand,
and then tried Ceramic again. I do not know what they have settled on. I believe that Range is testing large
concentrations of sand.


JKLM Energy, a privately held company, drilled a very successful deep Utica well in Potter County, PA. Anybody know
what proppant they used?


19 Oct 2016, 10:11 AM 


proppantman
So jklm did their first well with sand and then Recently did their next set of wells with ceramics. Time will tell
but a betting man would say ceramics will do better In the long term


19 Oct 2016, 07:50 PM 


proppantman
In regards to eqt they did switch back to ceramics for he Utica but I am not sure if they like the Utica at this
point due to economics of gas

Consol may give resin another try as I think the resin well on the Switz was. It far behind the ceramic well in
terms of performance but the wells have not hit full pressure on proppant yet and physics do not lie. The resin
will crush and the ceramics will continue to produce

Interesting. Are you sure about the ceramic?


I did my research, but also on fracfocus. I thought that their data was directly from the driller? Two of the 3
wells completed by JKLM in late August into September listed sand. I do not recall the third. I will double
check that tomorrow.

Carbo never did credibly support their product performance with sound engineering. Also, their engineers did frac
designs that resulted in very short effective frac lengths. That shot themselves in the proverbial foot. Short frac
lengths do not show the quality of improved production response longer, better stimulations provide so when using
better proppant with short fracs it does not show up very well in the statistics that ceramics are superior, especially
and most importantly long term. Now they pay the price. Operators have gone to so many stages with sand that the
benefit from using ceramic does not show up early time and only shows up in later time production data that most
operators engineers consider normal well response decline but it is not, it is proppant crushing and fines migration
plugging the proppant pack. Carbo just never coupled their consulting engineering with their core business model....


It may be too late now.....

Billy I think carbo does need to do more studies looking at performance one to 5 years out. The operators
should allow this to happen but a lot is kept secret in the oilfield. The case studies I have seen are very
compelling. Maybe you could look at their website. They have a few on there.


Product has been around for 30 years so I would take a guess there is a strong reason that to be the case


19 Oct 2016, 07:55 PM 


Billy8
I have seen it all. If operators/the customer "think" they have better economics that is all that matters.
Bottomline, that is what has happened because Carbo has done a poor job interpreting and presenting the
data.

Thanks Billy8,


I guess the long term Ceramic question will be at what flowing pressure, closure stress, rock hardness, brittleness and
all other factors involved stack in ceramics favor economically for EUR.


As far as the JKLM well which I mentioned. They used Sand (Crystalline silica: Quartz (SiO2) ). Plus it is not as good
as it appeared it would be. Peaked in month 5 and is declining pretty quickly through month 8 so far.

I was a Nasdaq Marketmaker in the late 90s trading the Oil Services sector. I traded Carbo back when it was CRBO. I
always get a kick out of seeing these names pop up.

Spotlight - informative and economically sound article here, thanks. Michail Filloon also posted an article earlier this
year warning of Carbo's Ceramics significantly declining use, and also saw it as a secular issues and not cyclical. He
understands this industry much better then anyone posting on SA. Best Regards


19 Oct 2016, 03:59 PM 


proppantman
Disagree. He is using Frac focus. A lot of the data on there is not accurate as they try to put as little as
possible so design can not be copied. Your comment shows you do not know the industry so how can you say
someone knows they industry the best. Maybe better then you!

Is it possible that CRR has a product quality issue? This would not explain the overall industry decrease of ceramic in
the Bakken, but one of my hopes was that they had a product which they could differentiate for other regions.


The touted Kryptosphere Ceramic completed deep Utica well for CNX in Greene County was the Consol GH9AHSU.
It peaked in the 2'nd month at a little less than 15 MMcf/d. For month 8 it produced at less than 10 MMcf/d. Total
production through August was 2,635,202. The Shipman 593894 well by EQT, also in Greene County, which used a
ceramic which I do not know the source, has produced 2,635,202 in 3 months and 8 days.


We know that CNX can drill deep wells, as their earlier Westmoreland County, PA deep Utica well has produced
5,659,548 in 10 months.

I would think they could show and have shown how their quality compares to the foreign market. But i would
like to see them compare quality to the domestic market producers

They did not have top quality engineering during the boom and definitely don't have it now. Give up seeing
quality comparisons and evaluations.

Another issue is the new "Mega Fracs" technology that is now taking over the shale drilling trend and does not call for
CCR propellant products at all.


19 Oct 2016, 06:12 PM 


proppantman
You have to look at all the Frac designs across all basins to make that case and I bet from your earlier
comments you have not. I have and I see a large number of tail in designs with ceramics

With all due respect, I will take Mr. Filloon's on sight research over proppantman all day.

Excellent information proppantman, Thanks


JKLM used a combination of Carbo Ceramics Econoprop 5.21178 % mixed with Sand 2.0827 % for their Sweden
Valley 101 4HU Utica well in Potter County, PA completed on 09/06/2016. listed as True Vertical Depth of 11,586 feet.
The other 2 wells on the pad completed during the same time frame used sand. This pad is about 3/4's of a mile from
the first Utica test well pad which used sand.


Further research into the Bakken leads me to believe that the change from Ceramic might be specific to embedment
in the Bakken formations. Maybe not ultimately a secular change industry wide. Time will tell. The same study might
also give clues as to why Resin Coated Sand was not added to the sand.


"Overall, the results of this study indicated that fluid exposure may affect both rock and proppant strength and should
be considered in the field. In addition, conductivity decreases within the Lower and Middle Bakken appear to be a

Formation embedment and spalling appear to be less significant within the Three Forks Formation."


"Given that the fluid exposure tests suggest that the strength of the RCS may be affected by reservoir conditions and
fluid exposure, and that slickwater and cross-linked gels have the potential to affect rock strength, advanced
conductivity testing using the various fluids would be more representative of actual reservoir conditions. "

I am not beating a dead horse, but since I started drilling down into the proppant use in the Utica, perhaps a bad sign
for Carbo Ceramics is Range Resources three Washington County, Pa wells.


First was Claysville Sportsman's Unit #11H which used 6.9 % Carbo Ceramics Carbolite, and 3.9 % sand. 2'nd
Claysville Sportsman's Unit #9H (6.8 % Carbolite, 6.4% Sand) 
3'rd well DMC Properties #10H which used only sand 14.9%.


They have been indicating that the all sand DMC well is their best Utica well. They will likely give more information
during their earnings release process. Too early to give an opinion based on current production reports.


I will give the opinion that generally there is some indication that the Deep Utica wells are not holding the initial flat
production for as many months as the drillers initially estimated. Also that once the flat period ends, they are declining
faster than expected. Maybe lower EUR than was estimated based on the decline curves assumed in the beginning.
Consols first well, and EQT's first well appear to be the positive exception to what I am worried about. They appear to
be holding up, but it is perhaps still early.

Proppant conductivity degradation in these rocks is not caused by embedment, spalling, etc. The rock is too hard.
Proppant conductivity degradation is caused by proppant crushing and proppant fines migration within the pack that
plug it. There are numerous technical papers on the subject and case histories. Depending on the proppant's specs,
the productivity of a well always shifts negatively downward when certain stress thresholds are met where the
proppant will start crushing. Many engineers interpret the declines as a normal reservoir response but they are not.
That is why ceramic tail-ins show benefit, granted beyond the ceramic the sand crushes and when this happens, the
sands effectiveness is reduced by about 50% conductivity wise. However, everyone should note that the rate per
fracture in a horizontal well is typically pretty low. As the rate per fracture decreases, conductivity can be very low and
still be effective, hence crushed sand! One final note: With the horizontal evolution and multiple stages, competent
reservoir analyses is rare because it can be complex to parse variables. Combine that with the fact that very few true
reservoir engineers exist in the business anymore, the bottom line is that most operators, even some of the biggest
companies, do not know how to analyze their wells to tie all these variables together and have confidence in the
results too.

Thanks Billy8, I appreciate the education. Would you post the title of or a link to 1 of the studies which looked at
embedment of various proppants for the Bakken intervals?


Have you looked at any of the Utica/Point Pleasant information?


I am especially interested in the deep Utica/Point Pleasant which arbitrarily could be maybe 11,500 on up to as high
as around 13,500 feet as I think that is the depth being reported for PA wells so far. There is not a lot of time on these
wells so far. Ohio does not appear to directly relate as my understanding is that although the rock is similar at least
into Greene County, PA, it is closer to 9,500 feet or so which could decrease the closure stress.


(I am including the Point Pleasant, as some drillers ,RRC as one, are reporting that interval as the target and
describing their target as having a carbonate component to the rock.)

Outstanding new post today on CCR. Hope Proppantman was able to read it. In my opinion this breaking SEC news
is just a symptom of CCR trying to fraudulently hide the significant decrease in demand for all of their products. The
factual combination of much lower oil prices, corresponding revised economic models, and new applications of
technology, is killing demand for CCR's products and I don't see how anyone can spin it any other way. IMHO

Since I brought up several wells, I will mention a success in Ohio. By process of elimination of other wells, I figure that
CNX used Carbo Ceramics, Hydropop Ceramic, and Econoprop Ceramic for their Monroe County, Switz6DHSU Utica
well. It has produced 3.164 Bcf in 190 days.


It is doing about as well as another well on the site. The Switz6FHSU has produced 3.25 Bcf in 199 days.


In their last investor report, CNX broke out the cost per foot of the 2 wells 6D $540 6F only $320.

HaHa yourself Mr. Proppantman, once again you are wearing blinders to the economic facts. Fortunately there are
many times when the simple fundamentals will tell the obvious economic future of an company, and the price of it's
stock. This company has a declining outlook across a broad range of financial matrices, thus the significantly
declining stock price..period. 
Disclosure: Closed half of my puts at a 360% non-annualized profit, will let the other half ride just a little longer. 
Great call spotlight, and also Michael Filloon, who also shorted CCR about 8 months ago.
