https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPRO
On Tuesday January 13, GoPro's (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:GPRO) world was shaken when
news leaked that Kodak's patent (Number 8,934,045) was reassigned to Apple
(NASDAQ: AAPL), driving GoPro's stock down 12% by end of day Tuesday. Was Apple
acquiring patents to take on GoPro? As the story broke, tech industry analysts reacted
immediately, with most suggesting the market was over-reacting to Apple's patent
acquisition. On Wednesday, January 14th, however, Devonshire Capital Funds issued a
presentation that explained why a trivial matter such as a patent reassignment might
rock GoPro's share price so strongly. This article discusses the importance of intellectual
property licensing, especially for technology companies, and provides insight into why
lack of licensing might be disastrous to the company's profits and market cap.


The presentation, entitled "An Analysis of GoPro," provides in-depth engineering
analysis of the intellectual property that powers GoPro devices and rests on months of
extensive research. Research began shortly after GoPro's IPO and subsequent sky-
rocketing of its stock. To industry experts with decades of experience in intellectual
property investments and litigation, GoPro's ballooning market cap was a surprise.
Having a heavily technology-focused portfolio, with extensive experience in hardware
and software startups, and years of professional work in intellectual property
investments and litigation, Mr. Stack and the Devonshire team developed a conviction
that GoPro was grossly overvalued. Most puzzling was the fact that as the share price
kept climbing, nobody was asking questions about the rights to the IP that powers
GoPro's technology.


Subsequent analysis of the GoPro patent portfolio showed that while the company holds
a relatively small number of patents directly pertaining to its technology, most of its IP
consists of design and mechanical patents. In fact, few of GoPro's patents pertain to the
critical electronic and camera technology that underlies the company's devices, while
many of GoPro's key features appear to be covered by earlier patents assigned to
competitors. Shortly after dissecting the first GoPro, the fund identified 15 patents on
technology that is deployed in GoPro devices and held by multi-billion dollar consumer
electronics manufacturers such as Canon, Nikon, Siemens, Dell, Samsung, and Hewlett
Packard. In the absence of technology licensing agreements with this group of patent
holders, GoPro's potential exposure to intellectual property litigation might be well in
excess of the 15% of its market cap erased by the Apple announcement.

Although we can only speculate on potential outcomes, industry experts and seasoned
investors will agree that outlook is bleak. On Wednesday and Thursday, a series of
lawsuits were announced, led by Contour, LLC. Contour joins eDigital, Z-Dimensional
LLC, Dinkum Systems, and VStream Technologies with outstanding infringement
lawsuits against GoPro. While previous lawsuits had little effect on GoPro's stock, these
new lawsuits may have more teeth, and are direct evidence of the risks identified in
Devonshire Capital Fund's presentation.


Despite the lack of information regarding GoPro's licensing agreements for these
patents, and an increasing number of IP law suits against GoPro, analysts at large
financial institutions such as JP Morgan and Wedbush Securities continue to hype up
the stock and pitch it as a buy. Devonshire Capital Funds' research has identified
numerous further patents held by both large and small entities which are directly
applicable to GoPro's flagship products. Research on these patents is underway.

Nobody does because its really too early to be able to make that call. After earnings
we will have a better idea, but I think we need 2 or 3 more Qs to make somewhat

I hope you decide to see outside the blinders at some point and not remain in a
narrow minded state. Do some research on users of the cameras and they will tell
you it's not just a camera mounted to a stick.

Joe: 
Maybe you are right. I am going to go take a look at their corporate website.


BRB.


I'm back. (and seriously I did go there and spent some time looking around and
reading stuff).


I continued to see mostly camera on a stick stuff. They do state this as their
corporate motto:


"GoPro, Inc. is transforming the way consumers capture, manage, share and enjoy
meaningful life experiences. We do this by enabling people to self-capture engaging,
immersive photo and video content of themselves participating in their favorite
activities. Our customers include some of the world's most active and passionate
people"


See all that sounds good in today's dumbed down world where us few are creating
and holding most of the wealth while the general masses are slowly but surely
wasting more and more time in things that do not improve their lot in life. Things like
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, GoPro, et al. All fall into that category. More time
wasting crap that insure that the 50% of all Americans who earn money from
working keep earning the $30K/ year or less that they earn now and keep crying
about how their lives just aren't working out the way they want them to.


The stocks of the companies i just mentioned including GoPro will easily fall by 75%
or more once this Fed fueled bull market in equities is over. Considering the
company only did 250 million in revenue during the previous quarter yet that

somehow justifies a 6 billion dollar market cap.


Should GoPro be traded by those who have experience trading stocks? Yes. Those
will the background and experience to do so will make money up and down on a
stock like this. 
Should a long term investor be buying shares here? No. There is no long term
investment here. Just a stock that is going to go up 1000% in a bull market then
crater 95% during the next bear market.


Been at this game 20 years, learned a lot and still learning something new every
day. One thing that never changes: Most people have so little real wealth they
always gamble on stocks in the hope of finding the next Apple. This is not it.

I guess you're just going to see what you want to see.


You must not have a grasp on appreciating equity because Facebook is very
profitable. Instagram which was bought for an "astounding" $1B is now worth $35B...
http://bit.ly/1yLFAx8


If those are your examples then I can see why you don't understand GoPro. A "time
wasting" product for you may be a fun and thrilling experience for someone else, and
still there are the ones who enjoy the thrill and invest and win at both. Oh hi!


I wish we were talking about companies that are only startups and you would have a
huge point and I would have to concede. But, since we are talking about decade old
companies I would have to contend you are wrong about this "dumbed down world."

When Google announced their IPO, I saw a "one hit wonder" that could be obsoleted by any
new search engine. I felt the same way when Facebook did their IPO. I was wrong on both
of them because I underestimated their managements resolve to evolve.


Will Gopro evolve like other tech companies? We'll have to wait and see but they are selling
a ton of cameras. I recently bought their Hero 4 camera and it's pretty amazing.

What exactly are the barriers to entry that Go-pro enjoys? I haven't followed the stock very
closely but from what I know, they make ruggedized video cameras that can be mounted to
a variety of platforms. They aren't even aerodynamic, which I find ironic since the most
common Go-pro applications are race oriented. What exactly are they patenting that hasn't
already been invented? I don't intend to be condescending towards its investors. I'm just
trying to understand the allure.

If you look at what the CEO and enthusiasts say about the product it will turn your
perspective to the allure. It's not just a camera, it's the idea and lifestyle of sharing
your most fun moments. Aerodynamics is not an issue when you mount it to
something that is indeed already flat. Air sees flat surfaces the same, it doesn't
matter if it is further out or not and you have to realize the camera and case is
extremely small. Look at NASCAR roofs. Those things are rather large there on the
front near the windshield. Do they affect their aerodynamics? Yes they do, which is
why they put them on all of the cars regardless if there is a camera inside or not. So
the lifestyle and sports adjust because it gains much more information than it hurts
the physics of the sport when all can be adjusted.


Not only that but this type of thing needs to work. You only catch a moment once and
if the camera doesn't work or if it falls off you may never ever get that moment back.
But GoPro cameras are high quality both in technology and in use cases and
mounting abilities. They make any kind of capturing convenient. It's a "go to" anytime
you are looking to do something that may be dangerous or may need little effort to
record something from a place you wouldn't normally be able to do it.


As for barriers to entry, what's the difference between Dell building computers and
me sourcing parts and selling them? The exact same thing. Dell has a network, I
don't. We both can easily build computers and I could probably sell a few. In fact I
could probably make a better computer quality wise (using quality parts) than Dell
but I'm not suddenly a competitor or in the running to take them over.


You can maybe build a camera (more work than a PC) but you don't have a series of
mounts that work on EVERY single model they ever made or the brand and loyalty
that you could conjure up.

Right now all that matters for short run is : How many cameras did they sell, how many
cameras do they plan on selling after their peak season has passed, what were the margins
on those sales ( i.e. how many high end vs low end cameras did they sell), where and how
much is cap ex exists for the near future, and how many shares hit the market by the end of
Feb. After that, Gopro will be a different story. Till then, everyone is just guessing. Most of
GoPro's multi year potential is nowhere near included in the price. Facebook took over a
year before it created a stable and rational trading pattern. I was lucky to buy in the low 20s
because I waited to establish a long term position after I had seen enough to be able to
forecast where the future was heading. Good luck to all with your investments.

Given the visibility that GoPro has achieved, it is almost a certainty that they are going to
see patent infringement cases. Some may be legit, others will be patent trolls just hoping for
a settlement of their nuisance suits. Consider the Apple - Samsung litigation. Lots of smoke
but in the end not material for either company. It's impossible to predict how it will all turn out
except that it will take many years and the lawyers will collect big fees. GoPro can afford it.

Unlike the continued "BAITING" comment, "GoPro=GoBroke" (which may get
reported if it continues) from Andreas Hopf above, your comments in the 2 posts
seem reasonably balanced. And I don't get the need for the "GOPRO nuts" blast
from you. Thought you were better than that? As one of the very few that do come in
often to defend on the Brand, Equipment and Quality of Best of their Programming
media attempts ..... I'm fair and balanced on that side of it. Leaving the numbers
evaluations to people much more versed such as yourself.


And rschifreen, below, addressing this IP litigation issue seems reasonably balanced
and I thank him for that as it sure got my attention this morning not in a good way.

You respond very emotionally to some people's views. Tone it down a bit IMHO. I
can say you have an inside view on the camera market, so I do pay attention to what
you say in terms of products and quality. If you want to know more about a car, ask a
mechanic, not a sales guy. If others bash the stock with Gopro=GoBroke comments,
then let it go. State your reason you are long and over time people will either agree
or disagree. Ultimately who cares.You certainly make your case known in every
article. If in a year from now GoPro crushes the bears, your bank account will reflect
your optimism. I have one piece of investment advice I hope you take the right way,
remain aware the disparity between stock price and great companies. GoPro has a
long way to go to establish enough information to be able to accurately forecast
many different important metrics. I don't see how one sided people can be with this
company, we barely have enough information to make educated guesses, let alone
wise decisions. Its still a new issue equity.

I often criticize GoPro and find that on SA there is a handful of GOPRO nuts that comment
on every article and defend the company with emotion. The facts are the facts, the hopes
are hopes, and the future is unknown. At these levels GoPro no longer is at nosebleed
levels for the most bullish case. What we do know: they sold a great deal ( more than
expected) product in Q4, they likely have ramped up capex as they begin to look into the
future, and the product currently dominates the market. I would not touch Gopro till it went
under 40 post lockup and earnings. I doubt the lockup will destroy the price, but it will offset
temporary gains that a strong quarter and guidance will bring. Valuation and uncertainty are
the biggest catalysts at this point. Both sides have valid arguments, and thats why markets
function semi efficiently.


I think the company will have a temporary upside after earnings because the hopes are still
reasonably out into the future. Thus speculation can support the over hyped price for a
camera company. GoPro= GoBroke all depends on at what price you own the stock, how
advanced your knowledge of technicals are, and how strong a stomach and conviction you
have. Not my forte for a long term holding. Prefer to trade opportunity.

Sales growth is nice but there's not much transparency for the future. The product is

sure if it should have a valuation of nearly 6x sales. Management had the right idea
unloading at the levels seen a two months ago. I wouldn't be long the stock.
