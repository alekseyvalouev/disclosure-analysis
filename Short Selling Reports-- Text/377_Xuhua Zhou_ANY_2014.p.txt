Sphere 3D: Investors Falling For The Same Old Tricks, Fair Value Is
Zero

by: Xuhua Zhou


Summary


Sphere 3D is a carbon copy of Biosign Technologies, with the same management
team and tricks.


Chief Executive Officer Peter Tassiopoulos is a man with a checkered past.


Sphere 3D has never released a commercial product.


The company has paid out salaries that are 20 times its investment in R&D (which is
only $200k since inception).


Microsoft is amongst a number of well-capitalized competitors.


Following questionable characters involved in past fraudulent schemes is one of the most
successful approaches to identifying compelling short-selling candidates. A background
check of the insiders at Sphere 3D (TSX:ANY, SPIHF) reveals what may be a hard pill to
swallow for current investors: That Sphere 3D's management is most likely misleading
you. Sphere 3D is a mirage! Not only that, the management has pulled this trick at least
once before. Below, we will outline its shady history and how it is repeating what it did with
Biosign Technologies (TSX:BIO, OTC:BITKF) during 2010 to 2011, but with a different
shell company. The companies have the same CEO, the same management team, almost
the same press releases, the same partners and are telling nearly identical stories. Long
investors, you have been warned: get out now.


What Is Sphere 3D, and What Does It Do?


Sphere 3D is a development stage software company. Its flagship product, Glassware 2.0
(yet-to-be-released), is an ultra-thin application virtualization system that will allow any
device to access any software virtualized on a private cloud. Sounds amazing, right? But
there is another company that does the same thing. You may have heard of it: Microsoft
(NASDAQ:MSFT). And while Microsoft has decades of successful products and billions in
revenues and profits, Sphere 3D could not be more different. It has been around for five
years and has lost at least $5.2 million since inception, with no meaningful intellectual

property or revenues to date. It begs the question: How can a company that has spent
less than $200k cash on R&D, which should be the core of any emerging cloud software
company, possibly have a market cap of $209 million?


Let's examine Sphere 3D's history of de minimis revenues and persistent losses. As the
table below presents, the company has generated only $671,000 in revenues during its
entire existence, while losing a total of $5.2 million. But the true picture is even worse, as
revenues have deteriorated to the point that revenue in the past twelve months is zero. In
spite of this, the company is paying out salaries that account for more than half of its
losses and are 20 times greater than its investment in R&D.


Is There a Single Product?


The fact that Sphere 3D has no revenues should not be surprising to anyone, since its
products have never amounted to more than a pile of words! Over and over again, the
company announces that it is developing software, but since its inception in 2009, it hasn't
commercially released a single product.


Here's a brief teaser on select software releases over the past few years.


1. In December 2010, Sphere released Ralii Server Software 1.0, and promised chipset
emulation software in early 2011. The company said: "We shall be placing it in a
production environment in early 2011". Needless to say, nothing has been heard on
the software since. The product never existed.


2. More recently in March 2013, Sphere 3D released Surf To Go, an app that allows the
use of Firefox on the iPad and was released in the Apple App Store on December 19,
2012. If you read closely, however, you will see it was not actually released by Sphere
3D. Instead, the product was released by a company named Imhotep Technologies,
which is located in Mississauga (a city in Southern Ontario that also happens to be the
headquarters of Sphere 3D). The product is no longer available. The company states
"In the first 60 days, without any advertising or promotion, there were over 5,000
registration requests that came from a multitude of countries around the World. The

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2140303-sphere-3d-investors-falling-for-the-same-old-tricks-fair-value-is-zero 3/46


registration rate has increased from less than 2 per day to over 300 per day in that
period." These numbers are laughable - real apps, like BBM by Blackberry, which was
released in October 2013 on Android and iPhone devices, had 10 million downloads in
the first 24 hours. The app was subsequently pulled from the market - presumably to
allow the company to develop a beta version. Once again, however, nothing about Surf
To Go has been heard since. Sphere 3D has hinted that Surf To Go is a proof-of-
concept product of its flagship Glassware 2.0 technology, but if the technology was
ready in December 2012, why pull a beta version? Why has no one seen a Glassware
2.0 beta outside of company-controlled demonstrations? At the end of the day, it was
as if the product never existed.


3. Sphere 3D announced a "partnership" last July with Overland Storage
(NASDAQ:OVRL) that looks very suspicious. I will spare you the details, but Overland
shareholders should be asking their CEO where his loyalties lie. He was personally
granted 850,000 options (with an exercise price of only $0.65), while Overland itself
was issued a maximum of 769,231 shares. It is mind-boggling that the CEO would
personally receive such significant compensation: he is currently sitting on a profit of at
least $6 million, and his stake in Sphere 3D is at least seven times the value of his
stake in his own company. Talk about a significant conflict of interest.


4. Later in 2013, Sphere 3D established a partnership with Corel, the maker of Corel
Office, a distant competitor to Microsoft in the office software space. Notwithstanding
that Corel has no product in the app store, this press release makes it seem like the
company is a reseller of Corel's product. "The Company believes in the power of
portability and Corel® Office so strongly, that they will be offering a Sphere 3D Corel®
Office Bonus Promotion - a complimentary bonus downloadable PC version of Corel®
Office (valued at $49.99) to 5,000 randomly selected users that register before
October 31st, 2013 at Sphere3D.com/RegisterforCorel". The press release also states
"Sphere 3D will be launching the public beta version of their new Glassware 2.0™ app
for Corel® Office in October". We are six months past October, and this beta product
doesn't exist. Again, it's just another broken promise.


5. Early in 2014, Sphere 3D announced the acquisition of V3 Systems, which sells
Desktop Cloud Orchestrator (DCO) software and associated custom-built servers. Can
anyone imagine Microsoft acquiring another company that designs word processors?
Acquiring another DCO software and server company makes no business sense to
Sphere, especially given it apparently already has both.


6. The deal Sphere 3D announced last week with Dell appears to be nearly identical to a
"deal" Biosign inked with Dell, as I will discuss further below.

7. Finally, regarding Sphere 3D's flagship product, a few questions: Has anyone seen this
thing in action outside of a company-controlled environment? What are the technical
specifications of the software? Which partners is Sphere 3D working with? Who are
the developers? How is this Glassware 2.0, when Glassware 1.0 is nowhere to be
found? Has anyone seen Glassware 1.0? Investors holding Sphere 3D shares should
definitely ask Peter Tassiopoulos these questions before sinking another dollar into its
stock.


The Checkered Past of its CEO Makes the Stock a Screaming Sell


Peter Tassiopoulos has been a senior executive of multiple companies, and appears to be
a perennial entrepreneur, but the reality could not be more different. Based on his track
record, Peter's mere involvement in any publicly listed company should raise a huge red
flag for investors, as his ventures have failed one after another. In fact, I can find no
evidence that Tassiopoulos has ever been associated with even one successful business
venture in the last 15 years.


Let's go through his business history:


1. In the early 2000s, Tassiopoulos was an engaged consultant for Bach-Hauser Inc.,
which later became Financial Access Technologies, and then ABV Gold, and now
Pharmacom Biovet (OTCPK:PHMB), which currently trades at hundredths of a penny
(but Tassiopoulos did manage to walk away with some money). Bach-Hauser's key
players, the people to whom Tassiopoulos had consulted, faced litigation from the SEC
for illegal promotion, and later settled.


2. Per a Biosign investor presentation, Tassiopoulos was formerly CEO of
Healthanywhere Inc.:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2140303-sphere-3d-investors-falling-for-the-same-old-tricks-fair-value-is-zero 5/46


Note that Tassiopoulos does not have Biosign or Healthanywhere in his biography on the
Sphere 3D website, nor does he mention that he was ever CEO of Biosign on his Linkedin
profile. But Healthanywhere is very relevant, since it is basically a prior version of Sphere
3D. "Healthanywhere is a world leading innovative eHealth solutions provider…Clinical
efficiencies are realized by providing healthcare professionals real-time health
information… anytime, anywhere." Does this sound familiar? It should, "Glassware 2.0™
enables you to surf anywhere, anytime!". Tassiopoulos and his friends cannot even come
up with new material for their latest scheme.


Déjà Vu


It is astonishing that Tassiopoulos and his team are running the same scam they
perpetuated at Biosign - and investors are falling for it again! Biosign traded as high as
$2.56 on February 11, 2011 - and has since fallen more than 98% to today's level of
$0.04. So what happened? Tassiopoulos and his friends happened, that's what.


The playbook is nearly identical, starting with the same executives:


The stories are nearly identical as well:


Like Sphere 3D, Biosign announced multiple deals, all of which amounted to nothing:
DynamiCARE in Mar 2010, DLF in April 2010, McMaster University in July 2010, ALQAEM
International in August 2010, ALQAEM again in February 2011, Peconic Bay Medical in
March 2011 and Dell in March 2011. Biosign even made a few acquisitions: Cloud
Diagnostics LLC in June 2010 and Healthanywhere Inc. in October 2010. All of the
promises between 2010 and 2011 ultimately pushed the stock to highs, but when the
promises failed to turn into actual revenue and profits, the stock price collapsed.


Like Sphere 3D, Biosign suffered never-ending losses on negligible revenues, as shown in
the table below.

Finally, when someone at Biosign smartened up, Tassiopoulos was fired in April. His
friend, Director Jason Meretsky, followed him days later.


The most comical similarity is that Sphere 3D and Biosign apparently share press
releases. Consider this Sphere 3D press release, which was apparently copied and
pasted from a Biosign one, as the typo shows:


For another example of a nearly identical press release, consider the deal Sphere 3D just
announced with Dell, Here's an excerpt: "'The addition of Sphere 3D's solutions to Dell
DRIVE Plus ensures that we are offering the most robust virtualization experience
possible for our EHR customers,' said August Calhoun, Ph.D., vice president/general
manager, Dell Healthcare and Life Sciences. 'Through this collaboration with industry
leaders we are able to deliver a truly innovative reference architecture for healthcare
systems.'"

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2140303-sphere-3d-investors-falling-for-the-same-old-tricks-fair-value-is-zero 7/46


The language is very similar to what was in the press release when Biosign announced a
deal with Dell "'We are pleased to provide hosting and technical support to enhance the
usability and availability of Biosign's health monitoring technologies', stated Berk Smith,
Vice President & General Manager Dell Services Healthcare & Life Sciences. 'Dell and
Biosign both recognize and seek to leverage the power of the cloud to provide meaningful
global healthcare solutions to users around the globe.'"


Here is another copy-and-paste example: Sphere 3D has filed three patents that appear to
be identical: Systems and Methods of Managing Access to Remote Resources, Systems
and Methods of Optimizing Resources for Emulation and Systems and Methods for
Managing Emulation Sessions.


Lastly, the software developers at Sphere 3D appears to have learned from Tassiopoulos'
playbook. Kumar GK and Ganesh KK's LinkedIn profiles feature virtually identical
backgrounds. (The identical parts are highlighted in red):

The Use of Stock Promoters


On March 6, 2013, Sphere 3D hired the investor relations firm USA Investor Link for a fee
of $10k/month and options worth $2 million. Please note that $2 million is more than the
cumulative revenue to date in the history of the company! Does USA Investor Link even
have any other current clients? Sphere 3D is also promoted by How to Find Big Stocks,
and here's the pump report.


Background on Sphere 3D's Founders and Largest Shareholder


Sphere 3D's founders, Mario Biasini and John Morelli, started Sphere 3D by having the
company pay for $695,000 to purchase their asset, which allegedly has the proprietary
software that's at the heart of Sphere 3D today. Neither Biasini nor Morelli has significant
public company experience, and Biasini can't even spell "cheif" (as in Cheif Technology
Officer) on his LinkedIn profile. Meanwhile, Morelli has previously been charged with
potential embezzlement of funds.


Sphere 3D's largest shareholder, Pinetree Capital (PNP.TO, PNPFF), is managed by
Sheldon Inwentash, who happens to personally be the company's second-largest
shareholder:

This is very unusual. Is Inwentash breaching his fiduciary responsibility to his
shareholders? This wouldn't be surprising given that he has been probed by the OSC.


Conclusion: Don't Be the Last Sucker Holding the Bag!


Before sinking a dollar into Sphere 3D, ask the following questions:


1. Are any of Sphere 3D's announced partnerships real?
2. What intellectual property does Sphere 3D actually own?
3. If it does own any IP, how did it develop it without any material R&D spending?
4. Why are salaries 20x spending on R&D?
5. Will Sphere 3D ever release a product?
6. With a story so similar to Biosign's, why would the outcome be any different?


In summary, Sphere 3D is nothing more than a promotion - and it's not even a very clever
one. It's blindingly obvious. It has no technology, not even a beta version of it, and of
course, no revenues - nothing but unending losses funded by gullible investors. The
company and its stock are worthless.


Disclosure: I am short SPIHF. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.


Additional disclosure: I am also short ANY, which is the Canadian listed ticker for
Sphere 3D

Mississauga, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - April 14, 2014) - Sphere 3D Corporation (TSXV: ANY) (OTCQX:
SPIHF) (the "Company" or "Sphere 3D"), a virtualization technology solution provider, today announced that it

Inc. and strengthened our cash position with the recent financing from Cyrus Capital," said Peter
Tassiopoulos, CEO of Sphere 3D, "We believe that applying for listing on NASDAQ represents another

Are you advising other readers to join you shorting the stock? Good luck to the ones that follow this advice!
As I wrote in my instablog (http://goo.gl/jVRQCd) and my Seeking Alpha article (http://goo.gl/qMfpIz) , your
short position is precarious!Let's have a look: 
The short position for SPIHF can be found here -  
http://goo.gl/0QmkkU 
March 31 - 135,827  
March 14 - 34,027  
The short position for ANY can be found here -  
http://goo.gl/5PC9Hy 
March 31 - 1,069,000  
March 15 - 1,098,100  
Feb.. 28 - 1,003,018


Till February 28 there wasn't any relevant short position on SPIHF and it quadrupled between March 15 and
March 31! During that same period the "official" short position on ANY didn't change that much as it was
extremely difficult for the hedge fund to borrow more shares. 
Note that: 
On March 3 Pinetree Capital had a PR announcing they became a "Company Insider" holding over >10% of
the shares and since then has continued to buy 478,200 shares, with an average price of $7.72 CADsee:
http://bit.ly/1h5zydo 
On March 7, only a few days later a new poster with alias "Niliearan" showed up on the Ihub message board
for Sphere 3D and remarkable went into overdrive posting messages full of misinterpretations, half-truths and
deceit to scare people out of their Sphere 3D holdings. See: http://goo.gl/ma8m3C 
I think that wasn't just a coincidence and I assume this poster was commissioned by the short or hedge fund
because they also took notice of the Pinetree Capital PR and now realized they were in deep trouble. 
Moderators of the Ihub MB for Sphere 3D were also shocked as they noticed how Ihub Admin suddenly
started to delete answers to "Niliearan". Posts from "Longs" versus "New poster -short" were deleted in a ratio
20/1 which makes you wonder about Ihub's neutrality.

And I imagine 1000's of concurrent connections is pretty handy for a cloud virtualization solution

"Early in 2014, Sphere 3D announced the acquisition of V3 Systems, which sells Desktop Cloud Orchestrator
(DCO) software and associated custom-built servers. Can anyone imagine Microsoft acquiring another
company that designs word processors? Acquiring another DCO software and server company makes no
business sense to Sphere, especially given it apparently already has both"


My understanding is that Sphere 3D and V3 systems both operate in the cloud space but do very
DIFFERENT things. V3 virtualizes the Desktop while Sphere virtualizes the apps. And Sphere virtualizes the
apps in a unique way, using emulation sessions.


The combination of the two provides a great solution for enterprises....makes sense to me

Xuhau and Wilson Wang. I assume you both know each other and validate each others work. I am a shareholder of
ANY so you know. My question for Xuhau is a simple. Did you write this article or was it written by someone else
higher up the food chain who have closer ties with the shorts in Canada. How much were you paid to write or print this
article on behalf of the shorts? The brokerage community in Canada is well aware of who the shorts are and how
desperate they are to try and create fear so they can cover. I hope they are reading because clearly they have done
little work on the fundamentals of ANY. Using Charts only get you in trouble as we can clearly see in this case. I will
be interested to see how big your following is. There is a great saying that I really like. You get what you pay for, and
you article is full of holes and deceptive and misleading comments. Fundamentals will drive the day as always.

Author’s reply »  I'm happily short this stock at this level and can't wait for you to list it on nasdaq so i get

One more thing, just because the stock had gone up a lot and there are shorts in the stock doesn't make this
any less of an appealing short to me. Instead of challenging the shortsellers, why don't you try to address any
of the red flags raised in the article? If you are a happy shareholder knowing all of the above, you got a
problem because you are either in on it or you should not be investing. That's all I'm saying...

How do you explain Peter not disclosing his prior involvement with Biosign? It's the biggest red flag to anyone
that shorts scams for a living. It's a pattern of behavior that should be alarming for anyone looking to buy into

Good luck to you. You never answered my question regarding your writing of the article. Did you write it or were you

article if I was you, I would want to be paid very well to write innuendo like this that has no substance. The word has

Shorts Despairingly Target To Fleece Sphere 3D Investors Through Posting False Claims And Misleading Stories. 0
comments 
Apr 14, 2014 12:16 PM | about stocks: SPIHF 
This instablog is in response to the misleading article posted today in Seeking Alpha by Xuhua Zhou, hedgefund
analyst:


Sphere 3D is trading in Toronto TSXV stock market with ticker ANY and in the US OTCQX market with ticker SPIHF.


Doing a little homework on some of the claims it is easy to figure out the story not only is devoid of any facts, it is one
of the funnier pieces of fiction I have ever read.


Some investors, primarily "Hedge Funds", engage in a practice known as "shorting" In case you're not familiar with
this practice let me give you a "short" description. Shorting a stock is the practice of selling shares of a company that
you do not own, at a certain price, in the hopes that it will further drop in price and you will be able to purchase it for
less than you sold it. This by itself is not a bad thing as it creates liquidity and allows people opportunity to purchase
shares that are being shorted (sold).


Where things start to become problematic is when those who are short decide they want to trigger a price drop to
force the shares of a company to go down. How you ask? They will often utilize smaller known media outlets or stock
chat boards to create false news, make accusations of wrongdoing and malicious smear campaigns against
companies or their management. This practice is of course illegal, yet common. In the business they call it a "Hit" on a
company written with the sole intent to influence your psyche breaking your confidence in your investment and
tempting you to sell your shares creating the opportunity for the hedge fund to buy your shares at the lowest possible
price.


Compare it to someone who falsely screams fire in a full movie theater and wants visitors to trample each other trying
to get first to the exits.


With the corporate update published by the company today April 14, 2014 the stock just made a high of $8.50 CAD on
the Canadian stock market, while it is known that some entities started to short this stock in August 2013 when it was
trading at about $2 CAD.


The "official" short position on date of March 31st 2014 was way over a million shares. The "real" short position is
much higher and I estimate that the total short volume is 12 to 15 times the average daily trading volume on the
TSXV.


Given the latest commercial breakthroughs made by Sphere 3D the shorts are cornered in a precarious position and
they mistakenly hope to trigger an avalanche of cheap shares so they can buy back shares for as little as possible.
Consequently, this "HIT-piece" fits their strategy. 
However, such "HIT-piece" is counterproductive as it doesn't take the market by surprise. There has been remarkable
short activity lately on IHUB. With the corporate update from today "investors in the know" will step in and thankfully
sponge up any cheaper shares eventually offered through the short's fire sale. 
In the case of Sphere 3D there have been a bunch of insider buys in the last weeks, so cheap shares have been
scarce and we can predict that any fire sale will be short lived...


So with this in mind, back to the story that I received; the author does not even hide his/her hopeful outcome. The
author concisely states in the article:
5/23/2018 Sphere 3D: Investors Falling For The Same Old Tricks, Fair Value Is Zero - Sphere 3D Corp. (NASDAQ:ANY) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2140303-sphere-3d-investors-falling-for-the-same-old-tricks-fair-value-is-zero 21/46


Sphere 3D is a "compelling short-selling candidate" and "Long investors you have been warned get out now." and
"Don't be the last sucker holding the bag! …hmmm, sounds relatively unbiased to me so far, not!


Now let us have a look at how they attempt to deceive the average investor and scare them into selling shares.
Hereunder I will refer to some sections of their story circulating in the internet and give you my comments in bold and
italic format.


They claim to have done a background check of the insiders at Sphere 3D reveals what may be a hard pill to swallow
for current investors". 
"Following questionable characters involved in past fraudulent schemes is one of the most successful approaches to
identifying compelling short-selling candidates.


What background check? The story does not actually offer any, it just makes a statement and moves on. A
responsible journalist would have known that all directors and officers of public companies listed on the TSX are
required to pass a 10 year background check and an RCMP (the Canadian equivalent of FBI) clearance. Don't take
my word for it, just go to http://bit.ly/1t0TAiI and make sure you look at page13.


They then attack the Management with statements like: "Chief Executive Officer, Peter Tassiopoulos, is a man with a
chequered past" including a link that states that Mr. Tassiopoulos was paid an insignificant fee in shares by a
company 14 years ago.


Interesting statement, I haven't found any evidence that Mr. Tassiopoulos has never been convicted, charged or even
accused of any wrongdoing in a 20 plus year career (remember the background checks above). So what are they him
accusing of?  
10 years later, that same company referred to by the hit-piece author, having been restructured and having changed
names four times along the way, was the subject of fines from regulators. I guess that makes all 100,000 former
employees or consultants of Enron, from over a decade ago, "Chequered", now that's a stretch!


They call into question Sphere 3D Chairman Eric Kelly who was appointed Chairman of Sphere 3D while the
company that he is currently serving as CEO, Overland Storage is in a commercial relationship with Sphere 3D. The
story states "I will spare you the details but let me state that the Overland shareholders should be asking their CEO
Eric L Kelly where his loyalties lie?"


This man is currently advising the US government and they question his integrity? The same Eric Kelly is featured in
this news release: http://mwne.ws/1t0TDe9 An excerpt from the release: "U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce
Rebecca Blank appointed President and CEO of Overland Storage, Eric Kelly to the 2013 US Department of
Commerce Manufacturing Council. The Council advises the Secretary of Commerce on government policies and
programs that affect U.S. manufacturing and provides a forum for proposing solutions to industry-related challenges.
The Council also works to ensure that the United States remains the preeminent destination for investment in
manufacturing throughout the world. The Secretaries of Labor, Energy, and Treasury serve as ex officio members of
the Council to better collaborate on issues the Council will address." I think that's enough on Mr. Kelly.


But wait, this gets sleazier and sleazier, they claim that founder and Technologist John Morelli, "has previously been
charged with potential embezzlement of funds."


Alarming at first glance I am sure, but the writer is relying that nobody will click the link because if you do you will see
that it links you to a civil a dispute between Mr. Morelli and his stepmother over the affairs of the estate of his

learned from Peter's playbook. Kumar GK and Ganesh KK's Linkedin profiles feature virtually identical backgrounds.
See below (highlighted in red are the identical parts)"


Not only is there no deceit, the man has his picture on both of his profiles. Please have a close look at the pictures;
this is one and the same person! Compare also the initials. I suppose the person forgot to cancel one profile…

The writer has more claims about management but it's more of the same defamatory statements that are without any
facts. So now that the 'HIT" story on management is done the author takes on the company. First he targets the
products.


Statements like "The Company has paid out salaries that are 20 times their investment in R&D (which is only $200k
since inception).


In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, until the Company achieved certain specific
milestones it had to expense the development costs, including salaries. Those requirements were met in 2013 and
the Company started deferring development costs as of July 1, 2013. The author could easily check his facts but of
course decided not to. Check the public record - it's in the Company's quarterly financials at http://www.SEDAR.com.


The author again tries to claim "Sphere 3D has no revenues" "their product roll-out history is quite literally a pile of
words" "there are never any actual releases."


Unlike this so called journalist that wrote the story I just looked up the financials. If there are no products ever
released where did the revenue on their books come from? Again check the public records. 
Overmore the company's update from today states"Estimated revenue for Q1 2014 is expected to exceed $1 million"


Once again the author grasps at the proverbial straw with "Sphere 3D has cumulative losses to date of $5.2 million
with zero revenue in the last twelve months".


"Zero revenue" is another serious aberration from reality: The company announced they "commenced shipping of V3
Appliances to customers in January 2014" that they were paid $500,000 upfront by Overland and other transactions
that are on the public record. Yet, even if they were pre-revenue, let us not forget that it took Twitter $3B of spending
before they had product for sale and Facebook acquired Whatsup for $19 Billion pre-revenue. So, what's the hit-
piece's point???


Early in 2014, Sphere 3D acquired a company, V3 Systems Inc. Due to the fact that V3 appears to be in the same
cloud segment the author foolishly states "Can anyone imagine Microsoft acquiring another company that designs
word processors?"


YES WE CAN IMAGINE! Go and check Wikipedia "The first version of Microsoft word was developed by Charles
Simonyi and Richard Brodie, former Xerox programmers" "Both programmers worked on Xerox Bravo, the first

WYSIWYG word processor."


The "HIT" also claims that the company makes false press releases, specifically referring to the recent PR where
Sphere 3D announced an agreement to join a coalition of companies that offer IT infrastructure and services, primarily
to the Healthcare sector.


It is very obvious that this news has the Shorts very concerned for the coalition includes Dell, Intel, RedHat, VMware
and now Sphere. It is referred to as the Dell Drive coalition. The author just flat out calls it a fake press release and
says "The most recent deal with Dell where Sphere 3D itself directs you to the Dell website highlights no mention of
Sphere 3D." Try going to Dell's tweet about this deal!!!

hedge fund has paid an author to fabricate. I find no relevance or merit in any of the claims. However, in the event that
it somehow does get published, I will bring on my point by point rebuttal to that story so that readers can have access
to the truth!


The shorts are aware of the limited timeframe in which to cover and have taken to defamatory postings, with no
regard for honesty, in the hope that they can CON investors into selling the stock to save themselves from the losses
they so richly deserve. DON'T BE CONNED. Do your own research and don't let the shorts scare you into selling
them your shares.

By claiming that there is no technology in Sphere's portfolio, you are claiming (imo) that Eric Kelly stood and lied to
the shareholders of OVRL last summer when he asserted the following: Eric L. Kelly "The same applications found on
your laptop, Mac or PC whether Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Corel, WordPerfect, salesforce.com, Adobe
Acrobat or even specialized software for computer-aided design or MRIs, all accessible from your iPhone, iPad, Droid
or any other mobile device. For example, on my iPad today, I am running a full native version of Microsoft Excel,
Word, AutoCAD, Corel Office and Adobe PDF, just to name a few, with all the same functionality I experienced when
using it on my desktop. The application is being hosted from the cloud infrastructure utilizing Overland SnapServer
appliances."------ So you assert that he's lying or somehow duped? He's in on the cabal? He would risk his entire
company and jail and fines? Or is he incredibly naive?

Any defense of Sphere 3D is laughable. The company and the stock were simply waiting to be uncloaked.


- The only reason Sphere 3D will have revenue in Q1 is because they acquired V3 Sytems. The only reason Sphere
3D acquired V3 Systems is to show revenue. They have no shipping product beyond what they acquired!


- The Eric Kelly option award seems shameful, truly shameful. It cannot be defended and was buried deep in Sphere
3D's SEDAR filings. It was never disclosed in any PR. Can you imagine Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates on John Chambers
being awarded personal options in a company that Amazon, Microsoft or Cisco struck a partnership with? Kelly has
made over $5 million personally on this deal. How can that be aligned to Overland's shareholders? Who cares what
government committee he was appointed to?


- Sphere 3D's cumulative total company salaries and capitalized expenses amounted to $1.5mm over the first nine
months of 2013. How can the company possibly have a product to fit all the PR they blasted?

Here is some more of what transpired back in the summer of 2013. Is it your contention to the Seeking Alpha
audience that Eric Kelly is misleading the investors of OVRL with his statements here as well??? "James G. Kennedy
- Marathon Capital Management, LLC  
Okay. Eric, on Sphere 3D, I have not seen any company able to do what Sphere 3D says they can do, number one.
Number two, would you be competing with folks like 8x8 and ShoreTel out there that are in kind of the unified
communications space or would they be likely customers of yours also?


Eric L. Kelly - Chief Executive Officer, President, Independent Director and Member of Special Committee  
Yes, Jim, so you're right. I mean, the technology is pretty unique and so you won't see that out in the marketplace
today. The folks like ShoreTel, they would be partners of ours or customers. I mean, they deliver -- they can turn your
iPad into a telephone. But actually delivering your native applications, it's something that everyone's been trying to
solve for several years now. And it's one of the key bottlenecks in terms of actually having companies like ours
participate in the explosion of mobile devices and cloud infrastructure from an application standpoint. So many, many
partners out there, especially on the commercial side of the world where they have global workforces, they want to
have access to basic native applications whether it's Microsoft or salesforce.com. But just as important is the custom
applications that companies have around the world, which are not cloud-ready at this point but they still need to be
able to put them in a cloud infrastructure and be able to serve them into their workforce. So, I mean, to your point,
they're not competitors, but they definitely will and hopefully be partners of ours."

My calculation of the actual share count for Sphere 3D (if anyone is counting) is as follows:


shares as of 9/30/13 was 18.3mm + capital raise on 10/5/13 at $3.35 per share 1.3mm + 2/11/14 the V3 Systems
acquisition (not including earn out) 1.1 = Basic Share Count of 20.7mm


+ 9/30/13 in-the-money exercisable options, strike price of $0.83 1.1 mm + 9/20/2013 warrants outstanding, strike
price of $0.99 3.0mm + 10/9/13 $4.25 warrants issued with stock units 0.6mm


= Estimate of Fully Diluted Shares 25.4mm


But heck, who really counts all those silly extra shares any way?

Not patents. Jut patent applications, big difference.


Company claimed to have 16 patent applications in an OSC report for year end Dec 31, 2013. Of those 16, 5
or 6 were for patents applications filed by V3 Systems. The same company Sphere did not acquire until mid
March 2014.

Why is Sphere 3D's Glassware 2.0 extremely disruptive?


This from Jacob Securities, who now has a $12.00 one year price target on Sphere 3D (Cormark Securities has a
$10.50 one year price target) -


http://bit.ly/1t0ZUqt


Glassware 2.0


Glassware 2.0 is designed to bring “any” application developed for a specific OS to any device. The company’s focus
is predominantly to bring software or applications made for Windows, Linux, Android, and even Mainframe to Apple
(Mac and mobile iOS devices), Windows (desktop and mobile devices) and Android devices (primarily mobile
devices).


The major differences between the existing vendors (Microsoft terminal services, Citrix as a delivery mechanism,
Hyper-V and VMWare as a backend desktop virtualization are: 


Current virtualization technology is available for X64/X86 processor based systems; specifically, the current
technology leaders virtualize Windows and Linux based software only 


Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment is pre-designed specifically on a per-user basis as a fixed virtual
machine (VM). Sphere 3D dynamically builds its VM live per request per client. The design and delivery of Sphere

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2140303-sphere-3d-investors-falling-for-the-same-old-tricks-fair-value-is-zero 28/46


3D’s VM requires less than one minute to build the environment and deliver the application. 


The bellwether virtualization vendors (VMWare, Citrix, Oracle, etc.) essentially create a template for an environment
and utilize that as a starting point to activate VMs. These templates include all layers (hardware, OS and application)
in one file. Changes in environment require creation of a new template. Sphere 3D has divided the hardware, OS and
application into separate templates that unite to deliver the applications to end users almost instantaneously. 


As a result, when a session is complete (i.e., user no longer needs access to application and data), the resources
(hardware, OS, application) are released back to the hosting device. In comparison, the larger vendors run live VM
sessions in anticipation of another session. This increases the cost of ownership and thereby cost per session to the
end users. 


Within the enterprise market, Glassware 2.0 allows for an additional security implementation protocol, as the
technology can be implemented as a virtual application appliance behind the enterprise firewall, creating a private
cloud. 


We understand that Sphere 3D technology could achieve up to 10:1 hardware resources efficiency compared to
current technology in use.

There has been no management buying this year. The website is:

It's hard to navigate but the only "insider" buys in 2014 are from Sheldon Iwentash and Pinetree Capital
(controlled by Sheldon). Eyeballing it it looks like over $1M or so which is likely what WallStPriate is referring
to.


A cynic might speculate that as a 2.4M share owner being marked at about $20M they are buying to support
the share price in advance of a NASDAQ listing.

"It's not a scam" does not make for a good investment thesis.


I think this company is a zero for more mundane reasons, like going up against Citrix, VMWare, Microsoft and
other major players with a few man-years of software investment. I don't think they will get revenue in excess
of what they spend on sales and marketing, let alone cover the G&A.


The VDI market will be big but that doesn't mean "Sphere 3D" will get a taste.


I find often in these companies management truly believes, as do some investors. Sheldon Iwentash is a
resource investor for the most part. I guarantee he's never seen a line of code.


Could be wrong. Can't get a borrow anyway so I'd love for a huge pump and NASDAQ listing.

who says Sphere is going up against Citrix, VMWare & Microsoft. Quite the contrary they can provide a nice
value added solution for them. In fact, that's exactly what V3 Systems does now. Go to V3's website, look at
their partners. When VMwares VDI desktops are managed by V3's DCO software, that's not competitive,
that's cooperation.


And now Sphere's Glassware 2.0 technology can be added to a V3 server, delivering the apps that are
difficult to virtualize onto VMware VDI desktops. I imagine VMware would be happy with that.


Sphere/V3 do not go into an enterprise and ask them to remove Citrix, VMWare or Microsoft. They are an
add-on solution for them. Type in V3 Systems into Youtube, there are plenty of happy testimonials that explain
this.

Where can I buy this product? Is there a customer somewhere running it? Is the company years behind
where it said it would be when it raised money pre-IPO?


>>Sphere/V3 do not go into an enterprise and ask them to remove Citrix, VMWare or Microsoft. They are an

Fair point. They are more like a VAR (value-added-reseller), and should be valued as such (1-2x revenue if
they are lucky).


$160 million market cap is a total joke IMHO. But I hope it goes to $500M by the time I can find a borrow.

Know what you own, and more importantly in the case of shorts, know what you sell. Sphere is a start up, that over
the past 5 yrs has developed a unique and disruptive piece of software technology. In less than 12 months it has been
diced and sliced and demo'd, and is now starting to be adopted by some very big names in the business, and is
getting a lot of quiet but serious attention behind the scenes. This is only Act 1 Scene 2. The shorts know they have
messed up royally which is why they commissioned the hit piece. Pathetically transparent to the longs and other
serious investors in this, who have been prudent enough to get in on the ground floor. Unlike the folks who shorted
back at around $3, this elevator does indeed go to the top!

and since V3 was acquired for $9.8M, $4M in cash and 1M+ shares, they basically have to be in on the con.
Given the customer testimonials, how likely is that?


They (the V3 people) would also know whether the (Sphere 3D) tech is real and it's difficult to imagine they
would want to be taken over, much less be paid in shares. There are other parties that have vetted the
technology, like Frost and Sullivan.


So much for the Microsoft buying another word processor. From the V3 CEO's description, the products are
complementary rather than substitutes.

I love how the author states "I am short Sphere"… and then "Fair value is Zero".


LOL


Not 20% below current trading price, not 50% below… but ZERO.


For a stock that just inked a deal with Dell and just today (coincidence?) announced plans to go to the big leagues
(Nasdaq). RIGHT.


Xhuah Zhou, whats wrong? Shorting a stock with a low float and a high amount of insider holdings seemed like a
bright move? What were you smoking?!


With the current float and over a million shares short - most likely a bit more due to this hit piece, it sure is going to be
fun to watch them get squeezed.

Xuhua,


(1) You suggested that two of Sphere 3D's software developers had nearly identical LinkedIn profiles, intimating that
we should conclude that something suspicious or dishonest is therefore afoot.


As Marc Chang has pointed out, these are two profiles of the *same person.* Were you aware of this, but decided not
to inform your readers of it? If so, that looks like blatant, purposeful dishonesty. If you were not aware of it, how
seriously should we take your competence and credibility? It would, at best, suggest that your conclusion guided your
"research," rather than the other way around.


(2) You stated that Sphere 3D has "filed three patents that appear to be identical." If one follows your links, it is
immediately obvious that they are not identical, and address themselves to distinct (though obviously related) aspects
of their technology. Were you aware of this, but decided knowingly to present your readers with a false narrative? If
so, then your article is blatantly dishonest. If you weren't able to see the differences in the patents, then one has to
question how well you understand their technology - or frankly, cloud technology more generally. If you aren't
competent to evaluate the content of their patents (and here I leave aside your failing to mention the other patents
Sphere 3D owns), then how seriously should we take your competence and credibility? Or can you otherwise justify
your claim that they are, in *relevant* respects, "nearly identical," for those of us less competent than you?


...And so on and so forth for many of the other claims in this piece...


14 Apr 2014, 08:44 PM

Sphere has no patents. End of story. Patent applications are not the same as patents.


Note: Overland/Tandberg did have some patents so these have now been added to Sphere's IP library. Prior
to the merger, Sphere and V3 had no patents. Of the 16 they claim to have files, at least four are duplicates
(i.e. overlapping in Canada and US jurisdictions) or have a ben abandoned or rejected. The net result is the
company has the three patents at the author mentions.

is highly unlikely.

Hope you clowns covered some of your pathetic shorts today so we can all get back to the business of watching a
start up with disruptive technology make it to the big leagues. If so, frankly I'm glad you were able to do it now, rather
than in a few quarters when your losses would be in the 8 digits rather than just the 7 digits. Wouldn't wish that kind of
damage on anyone - even if you operate at the margins of what is legal and moral. Enough with all the drivel and let's
move on....


14 Apr 2014, 10:18 PM

Sphere does not pass the smell test.


The Biosign history is a huge flag.


The fact that the shorts are willing to commit big dollars is a flag.


The other is the software itself. It appears the total investment in this software as shown in the last quarterly statement
is $1,072,000. If you know anything about software development you know that this is a very small number. Hard to
imagine that game changing software has been built for such small dollars. And this number does not necessarily
represent the actual cost to develop but simply the valuation based on the price paid in shares.


From March 31 2013 quarterly statements...


Investment in technology  
On December 31, 2010, the Company acquired all rights and assets related to the  
emulation and virtualization technology from Promotion Depot Inc., in a non-arms length  
transaction, in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Since  
the fair value of the assets received are not readily determinable, the investment was  
valued based on the $695,000 fair value of the shares received by Promotion Depot Inc.  
The technology acquired is still in the development stage and not in commercial use. As  
such, amortization of this asset has not commenced.


So the software was acquired for a deemed value of $695,000 based on the value of the shares exchanged for it;
says nothing about what effort was actually expended to write the software. Note that it was acquired in 2010. So this
software has been sitting on the shelf at Promotion Depot for over 3 years! That's very odd. How is that such
revolutionary software has been sitting on the shelf for 3 years?


If you know anything about leading edge software you know it needs to be constantly enhanced and improved to keep
it up to date. But what we see here is that since Dec 31, 2010 the value of the software has increased by $377,000;
which means this is the amount of deferred costs that Sphere has incurred since acquiring it. Note that about $86,000
of this is for patents and not actual development.

So what we have a piece of software that is at least 3 years old with a book value of $1,000,000 that requires very
little ongoing development effort underpinning a company with a market cap of about 150 million.


If you had $150 million to invest would you buy this company?

And therein lies the problem with your comments. You are "north of the 49th", yet you have not met the
founders of the company, nor taken any time to do the real DD that a new start up like this definitely requires.
Jump over to Mississauga there buddy and go meet them. You will then understand that this technology did
not "sit on a shelf for 3 yrs", and was not "acquired" from Promotion Depot. In fact, your assumptions (as are
those of the author of the very false article above), are completely wrong. Take the time to visit the company
as I did, and you will see very quickly that they have a significant technology that is capturing the attention
and imagination of some of the biggest tech players and customers in North America and around the world.
Until you do, your speculation is ridiculously inaccurate to those of us who have taken the time to do the
tough ground work required to uncover a very promising investment.

Silverline, the company's filings state unequivocally that the core technology called Glassware was acquired
from Promotion Depot.

Reading through the links you provided to Sphere's patented technology


Systems and Methods of Managing Access to Remote Resources,  
Systems and Methods of Optimizing Resources for Emulation and Systems,  
Methods for Managing Emulation Sessions.


They are very interesting!!


It appears that Sphere has technology that can do much needed things.


Emulation of different architectures allows applications that have been written for different architectures to run on the
one server. Very cool don't you think!


That solves quite a few problems. There are many different applications developed for different platforms and
architectures. Its a big problem. This seams like a good solution.

I have read it twice to be sure I don’t have missed some points. I have read the comments carefully, taken a neutral
stance I give 3 points in favor of the longs and only 1 for shorts.


It is obvious that this article is written by purpose in favor of shorts, is somebody on the losing end?


15 Apr 2014, 07:05 AM


GetSmart17
For the benefit of the shorts. Take the time to compare the article posted by Xahua on behalf of the large short in
Toronto with the article written this morning by Marc Chang that is based on fact. One important thing to remember is
Xahua already knows there is little or no shares avaiable to short. His purpose for writing the article is to scare longs
into to selling so the share price goes down. Xahua is bought and paid for. It doesn't make sense at all that Xahua
comes out of nowhere to enlighten the world as to the perils of being an investor in Sphere3D.


Sphere 3D: A Disruptive Cloud Technology Player 
Apr. 15, 2014 8:52 AM ET | 4 comments | About: SPIHF, Includes: AMZN, EMR, IBM 
Disclosure: I am long SPIHF. (More...) 
Summary


This article highlights a company that has developed a unique technology platform that can enable the migration to
the cloud for software users and publishers. 
Investors have the opportunity to enter at a valuation that is low in comparison to its peers. 
Sphere 3D is a unique virtualization technology solution provider that has described itself as a company that “solves
the problems that previously were considered unsolvable”. 
Glassware 2.0 technology makes it possible for today’s devices to access yesterday’s software, without sacrificing
performance. 
The most recent partnership and cooperation with Dell Healthcare strongly validates Sphere 3D’s technological
uniqueness and credibility. 
My followers at Seeking Alpha and a number of readers will be aware that yesterday I published an Instablog
response to an article that was intended to, bluntly, throw allegations at a company that in my regard offers great
investment potential and revolutionary IT technology.


Rather than wasting time in a meaningless street fight with an analyst that will do great efforts to drag the company,
its management and insiders through the mud, I would like to introduce readers to the unique business potential of
Sphere 3D (OTCQX:SPIHF).


My Followers in SA that mostly know me from my series of articles in 2011 about Kandi Technologies (KNDI) know
that I don't take DD lightly and strive to be objective in my articles to let the readers decide.


Rising Cloud


Undoubtedly, the cloud attracts such enormous attention, even from the largest players, due to its market potential as
enterprises are increasingly and almost inevitably shifting their IT focus to the cloud. Indeed Gartner predicts that the
bulk of new IT spending by 2016 will be for cloud computing platforms and applications with nearly half of large
enterprises having cloud deployments by the end of 2017. Source: Gartner Says Cloud Computing Will Become the
Bulk of New IT Spend by 2016.

Such is the importance and undeniable potential of the cloud that Microsoft (MSFT) appointed its former Head of the
Cloud and Enterprise group, Satya Nadella, as its new CEO. Other firms that have been actively developing solutions
for the cloud include: Intel (INTC), Oracle (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP), International Business Machines (IBM), Hewlett-
Packard(HPQ), Red Hat (RHT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), VMware (VMW), Cisco (CSCO), Dell etc. to just
name a few.


Meanwhile, research firm IHS expects enterprises to spend $235 billion on cloud architecture and related services by
2017, up 35 percent from the $174 billion it expects to be spent this year and triple the $78 billion spent in 2011. This
year alone, cloud spending is pegged to rise 20 percent from $145 billion last year. Source: Enterprise Cloud
Spending to Soar to New Heights in Quest to Drive Greater Business Success.


In a recent Wall Street Journal article published on March 4th with the title: New Cloud-Software Firms Take Off,
Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has financed many cloud software companies such as Dropbox
Inc. and RingCentral (RNG) was quoted: "The market is large enough that you can sell into one vertical…these
companies have a long way to grow."


Indeed, the WSJ reported that: "the rise of niche providers could crimp the growth of big software makers such as
Oracle (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP), Salesforce.com (CRM) and International Business Machines (IBM), while presenting
a larger threat to company-built software or programs from lower-tier players that have been slow to shift to the
Internet."


Wells Fargo Securities analyst Jason Maynard was quoted in the same: "We believe there is a great white-space
opportunity in delivering apps and infrastructure to specific industries and verticals." and in a recent report named
"industry clouds" as one of the top 10 software trends of the year.


The WSJ concluded: "Historically, investors shied away from financing niche players because they thought the
markets were too small. But in recent years these companies have taken off as the technology has become easier to
use and cheaper, broadband Internet service has become pervasive, and customers are more open to using cloud
software. Their business models are also attractive to investors, requiring customers to pay a low but recurring
monthly fee."


The Opportunity


This article highlights a company that has developed a unique and revolutionary technology platform that can enable
the migration to the cloud for software users and publishers; despite having quickly established itself and its
technology among key industry players, it still offers investors the opportunity to enter at a valuation that is ridiculously
low in comparison to its peers. Why does the opportunity exist? Contrary to many other companies, the firm's
management has, as we will show in this article, been focused on efficiently and successfully executing its strategic
plans instead of aggressively courting investors. Moreover, the company has largely escaped the eyes of Wall Street,
to date, due to its primary listing being in Toronto (Sphere 3D was honored as a TSX Venture 50 Company in
February) and only a secondary listing in the US as an OTCQX stock with very limited float. In the meantime, and
rarely so, retail investors have the chance to grasp this investment opportunity in the early stages of the company's
development and market recognition.


Sphere 3D Corporation (TSX: ANY.V) (OTCQX: OTCQX:SPIHF) is a unique virtualization technology solution provider
that has described itself as a company that "solves the problems that previously were considered unsolvable". What
problems are there in virtualization? Plenty! Sphere 3D allows most devices, independent of their size, resources or

operating system, to access the full functionality of software programs and applications off from servers either in the
cloud or on premise, absolutely independent of their operating system! A short video on Youtube presents Sphere
3d's solutions in a graphical way.


In fact, its Glassware 2.0(TM) technology makes it possible for today's devices to access yesterday's software; for
today's software to run on tomorrow's devices all over the cloud, without sacrificing performance or security. The
company has built their proprietary Glassware 2.0 platform from the ground up and specifically designed it to achieve
application virtualization in the most demanding of circumstances. It can be deployed alone for application
virtualization or utilized in conjunction with third party hypervisor-based virtualization deployments, for true end-to-end
virtualization of physical infrastructure. For additional information visit sphere3d.com and have a look to the
presentation made by Peter Tassiopoulos during the CANTECH Investment Conference held in Toronto last January.


Even virtualization industry heavyweight VMware (VMW), a company with a US$45 billion market capitalization, is still
in the middle of piecing together a complete solution to deal with mobility and desktop applications. Their strategy has
included acquisitions to address this; most recently buying Airwatch for $1.5 billion and Desktone for an undisclosed
amount. On April 9th VMWare in an announcement stated "Customers want to transform their applications and
enterprise desktops for the Mobile Cloud Era - extending access to employees on any device, from anywhere via a
comprehensive solution that is simple, secure and cost effective", it is very important to point out that Sphere 3D could
easily augment this approach.


In fact, the uniqueness of this technological solution and capability allows the management of Sphere 3D to execute
the company's strategic growth plans at a truly remarkable pace, providing evidence not only of the credibility of its
technology, but just as importantly, the management team's focus, dedication and ability to execute successfully. Due
to such pace and significance of the developments we have chosen in this article to focus on its multiple significant
achievements in just the last three months, as each of these achievements alone would arguably have taken less
promising companies much longer than that!


11th February 2014 - Acquisition of V3 Systems 
V3 is a technology leader in desktop cloud management solutions and the creator of the Desktop Cloud
Orchestrator™ ("DCO") software, which allows administrators to manage local, cloud hosted, or hybrid virtual desktop

said V3 Systems' CEO Ric Lindstrom. "We expect this combination will offer a very compelling solution to customers
in sectors such as financial services, government, education, and healthcare."


I highly encourage potential investors to browse the website of V3 (v3sys.com) which is loaded with information on
the company and its technology, including very informative videos about the company and its products , however, for
the readers that would like a quick first grasp, we would like to refer you to a public video testimonial by the CIO of a
US Law firm with several offices of how unique V3 d eployments are. In less than three minutes it should leave even
the most skeptical technology investors without a doubt about the potential of Sphere 3D's acquisition of V3 and the
future of Sphere 3D: http://bit.ly/1jHLwhI. More videos can be found as well: http://bit.ly/1jHLwhK


12th of February 2014 - Expansion of Partnership with Overland


Sphere 3D and its global licensee, Overland Storage (OVRL), a global provider of unified data management and data
protection solutions across the data lifecycle, announced their intention to expand their relationship to include the V3
offering. Overland will embed some of Overland's award winning Network Assisted Storage (NAS) and Clustered
Storage technology within its product suite to create new Software Defined Storage capability. For those who are not
familiar with Overland, combined with its recent purchase of Tandberg Data Holdings, has shipped more than
1,000,000 units to customers around the world. This includes Fortune 1000 companies and organizations across
sectors comprised of government, education and healthcare and life sciences companies.


The licensing agreement with Sphere 3D opens up truly global sales channels and established relationships of
Overland and Tandberg Data, while the new products to be developed by Overland that will integrate Sphere 3D's
technology into their data management solutions, will add a larger technological footprint as well.


Peter Tassiopoulos, CEO of Sphere 3D, noted: "I couldn't be more excited with the blended solution we have created
with Overland and V3. Overland's massive global reach will enable us to create the market penetration velocity
needed to deliver our solution through a proven and trusted partner."


24th February 2014 - Sphere 3D and UniPrint enter into an OEM agreement


Sphere 3D entered into an agreement with UniPrint (uniprint.net), a Division of ACCEO Solutions, Inc, and the leader
in printing virtualization. UniPrint's award winning printing virtualization software allows simple and reliable follow-the-
user printing, also known as secure pull printing. UniPrint printing virtualization allows for printing from any application
(desktop, web or mobile) on any device (PC, tablet or other web-based device) to any printer (regardless of make or
model, cloud-ready or not) and easy and reliable remote printing across platforms.


The VP of Software Development at Uni Print, Aaron Fu, noted: "When Sphere 3D presented us with the opportunity
to be part of their innovative virtualization solutions, along with V3 Systems and Overland Storage -- we were excited
to incorporate our technology into their suite of virtualization building blocks...UniPrint adds efficient printing for both
remote and local operations to Sphere 3D's unique VDI solutions which are designed to future proof legacy apps,
extend the life of the PC and even mainframe apps for enterprise. We look forward to growing with Sphere 3D in the
future."


For those that require a hint on how relevant printing is in virtualization, just Google it and sees the complexity that
just got solved.

Sphere 3D managed to convince Stoney Hall, a former Partner Alliance Manager- Healthcare and Life Sciences of
Dell Inc. to join Sphere 3D as the new Vice President of Global Sales. Sphere 3D noted that: "With almost twenty
years' experience in sales, Mr. Hall is well known as an influential, dynamic and experienced sales executive who has
effectively leveraged teams and partnerships to consistently exceed revenue expectations. He has proven himself as
a leader who can provide direction in business growth, strategic planning, sales and marketing.


Peter Tassiopoulos, CEO of Sphere 3D commented: "Stoney is a technically sophisticated, results-driven, and
seasoned senior executive…In just his first few weeks since joining the team at Sphere 3D he has been instrumental
in creating effective strategies to ramp revenue, capitalize on growth opportunities, and support our channel partners."
Indeed, the first immensely positive effects of Mr Hall's hiring started to come to shareholder's attention less than
three weeks later in the following landmark development.


3rd April 2014 - Sphere 3D Teaming up with Dell to integrate the Sphere 3D Glassware 2.0 platform and its Desktop
Cloud Orchestrator with Dell DRIVE Plus


Sphere 3D announced that it teamed with Dell to integrate the Sphere 3D Glassware 2.0 platform and Desktop Cloud
Orchestrator ("DCO"), from recently acquired V3 Systems, with Dell DRIVE Plus. Notably, the Dell DRIVE
Collaboration includes not only Dell, but also Red Hat (RHT), Intel (INTC) and VMware , all technology giants in their
own right. This announcement was not only a huge sign of the technological solutions that Sphere 3D offers, but also
put its name alongside multiple players with multi-billion dollar market caps.


"Desktop Cloud Orchestrator and Glassware 2.0 software drop-in appliance solutions can be deployed in conjunction
with other DRIVE partner technologies," said Stoney Hall, VP Global Sales, Sphere 3D. "Together these technologies
enhance end-to-end compute capabilities of virtualized end user environments while simplifying their management."


To give readers an adequate picture of the opportunity that this collaboration represents, it has to be stressed that
Dell's Healthcare IT revenue in 2013 was US$2.9 billion. In the US, Dell Leads Gartner's Healthcare Information
Technology Services Provider Rankings: 2013 marked the third consecutive year Dell has ranked No. 1 in the
healthcare rankings, which are based on annual revenue. Dell has a 20-year legacy as a leader in healthcare IT,
providing broad capabilities, including electronic medical records (EMR) cloud and disaster recovery services, cloud
clinical archiving and mobility solutions. Already more than 2,000 hospitals and 30,000 physicians worldwide rely on
Dell for IT support, benefiting from Dell's full-service, end-to-end IT solutions. The Dell Cloud Clinical Archive is
managing more than 85 million clinical studies and more than 6 billion diagnostic imaging objects, and supporting
more than 800 clinical sites in the industry's largest vendor-neutral hybrid cloud for medical imaging.


What is most important to highlight in this context is that Dell, the technology leader in delivering healthcare IT
infrastructure, decided to incorporate the technology of Sphere 3D along with major league partners; a fact that
makes it indisputably clear to IT managers across industries and investors alike that Sphere 3D's unique
technological solution, puts the company in the direct technological presence of multi-billion dollar companies!


14th April 2014 - Application for NASDAQ listing


In line with Sphere 3D's speed of progress the company announced that it has filed an application with NASDAQ
OMX Group to list its common shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Peter Tassiopoulos, CEO of Sphere 3D noted:
"We believe that applying for listing on NASDAQ represents another important milestone for the Company and will
help increase liquidity while providing greater access for U.S. investors and institutions." This strategy is not only in
line with Sphere 3D's progress, but also recent board appointments and having secured additional capital in March. In

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2140303-sphere-3d-investors-falling-for-the-same-old-tricks-fair-value-is-zero 42/46


fact, in the same announcement Sphere 3D also provided an extensive update with a list of operational highlights of
the recent past: Corporate Update, April 14th, which also mentions the expansion of the relationship with Corel, a
software publisher with over 100 million active users worldwide. The Company further reported that in addition to the
demonstration centre at the Company's head office near Toronto, Canada, it established two additional locations for
existing and potential customers and partners to come and test drive Glassware 2.0™ and V3 appliances. Additional
demonstrations sites in Europe and the U.S. are being set up. Most importantly, to the disdain of shorts or doubters,
Sphere 3D has no intention of keeping its technology quiet and out of sight. I have personally attended some of its live
demonstrations first hand with IT experts by my side.


In conjunction with its announcement to seek a listing on NASDAQ which will open it up to a whole new "sphere" (no
pun intended) of institutional investors, the company also provided key financial highlights, providing a nice
background for its NASDAQ application and its financial stability:


Estimated revenue for Q1 2014 is expected to exceed $1 million; 
Cash and short term investments at the end of Q1 2014 are in excess of $7 million; 
Total assets at the end of Q1 2014 are in excess of $20 million; 
Completed a Convertible Debenture financing of U.S. $5 million on March 21, 2014. 
Such is my confidence in Sphere 3D that I have taken the initiative to respond to a recent short article that contained
allegations on management, that were very straightforward to explain. As the shorts cannot anymore raise doubt on
the technology of Sphere 3D, due to its numerous partnerships, they have resorted to personal allegations on
management which I was happy to address in my instablog: Marc Chang's Instablog.


The current value also provides an opportunity to take advantage of the short's attempts to "shake the tree" and to get
out of its short position, before Sphere 3D achieves further milestones, which, if the past is any indication, will occur
rather quickly.


Note that the shorts' position is precarious: I estimate that the number of shares shorted might be close to 20 times
the average trading volume on the Toronto stock market exchange and they started to short this stock when ANY.V
was trading at about $2 CAD. Consequently a short squeeze is not a far-fetched outlook here.


The sweet and short bottom line


With a unique technology solution that allows users to run any application or operating system remotely with minimum
end user requirements, high profile partnerships, financial backup and a management team that keeps executing at
an incredible pace, Sphere 3D is destined to become a major player in the billion dollar virtualization sector. With a
current market capitalisation of less than US$ 150 million, opportunities do not come much more evident and
promising than Sphere 3D.

Left two questions for the author who seems to all but ran away:


1) When did you first go short?


2) What happens to short shares when Sphere moves to Nasdaq, are they carried to Nasdaq or does the short seller
have to cover etc..?

>>1) When did you first go short?<<


Who cares? It doesn't change the content of his article.


>>2) What happens to short shares when Sphere moves to Nasdaq,<<


Nothing


>>are they carried to Nasdaq or does the short seller have to cover etc..?<<


They owe a share of Sphere - where it trades is irrelevant.

When Sphere goes to Nasdaq the short fund company out of Canada will be out of business. Sphere fundamentals
will put them out of business anyone. You better play by the regulators short rules or else. No wash trading to look like
they are covering their shorts. I hear the regulators are on to them now and that many trading desks are becoming
aware of their precarious position. You have to be able to borrow shares in order to short and declare it.


Your question to Xahua about when he went short is a good one. He probably only heard about Sphere recently when
he was approached and paid to print someone elses article that was organized by the short group out of Canada. He
probably doersn't even have a position. These short guys out of Canada think they are really bright, but I can tell you
one thing, their wallets are going to empty when they are finally forced to cover.

Thanks, what caught me off gaurd was how fast an article appeared on the day os th eNASDAQ up-listing, so
I figured they had this article in the can and when they saw the price running away they need to do damage
and fast. The easiest thing was to release the article then have all the cronies add comment saying they are
shorting too and how this is a scam.... So what happens it turns out that they and a few weak hands were the
only ones that dumped and now everyone knows the article was a total joke.


Talk about adding fuel to the fire I think they will be covering at $10 at this rate.

You were right on with your assessment. It is unfortunate that a group like this presents a garbage article that is totally
inaccurate and in the same swipe of the pen try to scare shaeholders into to selling their shares. NO benefit to
existing shareholders at all. It has everything to do with protecting their own rear ends which by the way are going to
get a lot more abuse as each day goes by. I also believe the regulators and the street where they place their orders
are on to them big time.

["We have tested many of today's leading virtualization technologies and have looked at a number of potential
solutions; none were able to deliver the simple migration to virtualization and incredible performance that we get from
the Sphere 3D approach to virtual computing." said Paul Shumway, Senior Vice President of Novarad, "The first time
we saw our products run on Glassware 2.0, we were sold."] 
http://yhoo.it/1rqjQkH


We can be fairly sure it's not a scam from today's deal. Not that we were ever worried about that, but opinions seem
to differ here..

I'm not sure the company is a "scam" per se. I just see it as virtually worthless with diminimis revenue and a
$200 million valuation.


To be honest from the press release I think this is a V3 Systems deal (the company they bought). No
coincidence Novarad is down the road from V3 in Salt Lake City:


http://bit.ly/1fbDzm1


My take on what they've done is they've rebranded V3's product (appliance running VMware) as the
"Glassware 2.0 platform".


Right before they bought V3 they described Glassware 2.0 as:


"patent pending Glassware 2.0™ technology makes it possible for incompatible devices and applications to
run over the cloud, without  
sacrificing performance or security."


In today's announcement they've add "platform" and the description looks an awful like V3:


"The Glassware 2.0 platform for mission critical applications features include access to real GPU processing,
true 3D rendering, real-time failover, continuous availability, high performance and secure multi-tenancy."


I think for the most part Sphere 3D at a $200 million value is for all intents and purposes V3 Systems - the
nice little company they bought for $9.7M.

"It's not a scam" isn't an investment thesis.


24 Apr 2014, 05:30 PM


Shareholders Unite, Contributor
Well, "not a scam" certainly isn't my investment thesis, I haven't actually made one at all. What I do note is
that some seem to have "it's a scam" as an investment thesis, and that seems rather improbable to me. As
I've argued above, V3 would have vetted Glassware and Sphere 3D and since they have real business, they
would have no reason to be taken over by a scam, let alone one paying partly in shares.


Having said that, one could argue that the quote above from the Novarad guy does contain something of an
investment thesis though :) Too difficult to value for a simple guy like me, but I would say with customers
comparing it to leading products from the competition, there seems to be a good deal of potential here.

How many more pr's will it take....


Keibiko still answers for the author who is in hiding and has not answered any of my posts.


So it seems they still maintain "scam" according to the wording in the article and also saying it will go to zero,
yet it manages to make a new 52 week high.


I am thinking there are a lot of people severely underwater on their short positions.
