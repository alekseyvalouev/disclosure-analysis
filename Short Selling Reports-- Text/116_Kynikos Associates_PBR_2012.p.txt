U.S. Shale Explosion: Cheap Gas at Coal’s Expense


• Shale is a game-changer: U.S. is now 75% energy independent 
• The rapid expansion of shale gas production capacity has led to record low prices


– Henry Hub natural gas price around $2/mmBtu
• Down over 50% YoY
• Over 75% lower than five years ago


– Gas inventories are at record levels
• Shale production economics imply even lower natural gas prices 


– Cash operating costs of production are extremely low (less than $1.50/mmBtu in some cases) 
– At current natural gas prices, there is still little incentive to cut production 


• Cheap natural gas leading to substitution from coal-fired power generation:
– January 2012 coal-fired electricity was down 25% YoY
– January 2012 gas-fired electricity was up 23% YoY


• Coal industry is feeling the heat
– Domestic coal prices down 20-32% YoY
– Coal train car loads down 18% YoY

CONSOL Energy (NYSE: CNX)


• The “value” story
– Stock is down over 30% YoY
– Earnings stream is “diversified”
– Assets are “low cost” relative to peers


• CONSOL’s businesses face headwinds
– Thermal coal, 45% of 2011 gross profit – pressure from coal-to-gas substitution
– Metallurgical coal, 38% of 2011 gross profit – uncertain Chinese steel demand
– Shale gas, 17% of 2011 gross profit – ongoing domestic overinvestment


• High cost assets relative to international peers
– Thermal coal exports are competing with low-cost exporters from Australia, 


Indonesia, South Africa, Colombia


– Metallurgical coal exports pressured as Australia returns to normalized levels
• Shale gas capital allocation raises concerns: over half of 2012 growth expenditures

National Oil Company: For the Benefit of the State?


• From China to Brazil, quasi-public is the new model for national oil companies
– Step 1: Retain a majority stake
– Step 2: Push ambitious and costly investment strategy
– Step 3: Keep pump prices low to appease citizens


• China shows how it’s done
– Big three oil companies are theoretically public
– Overpaying for overseas reserves 
– Downstream margins often negative


• Petrobras seen as a LatAm model
– In Mexican election, politicians calling to IPO Pemex along similar lines


• Brazil remains a troubling prospect for outside investors
– Chevron and Transocean face an $11B federal lawsuit and criminal charges for a 


tiny 3,000 barrel spill in Nov 2011
– Infrastructure is ~2% of GDP – barely covering depreciation
– Prosperity has bred complacency and reform has slowed

– Shipments of mobile products increased by 79% YoY in 2011
– Shipments of PCs increased by 2.9%


• Proliferation of mobile devices pressures PC margins
– iPad bill of materials is ~40% lower than average PC
– Tablets/smart-phones have no hard-drives, no keyboards, and no 


Wintel


• Cloud services allow consumers to be device-agnostic
– Eliminates need for PC as a mass storage device
– Functionality migrating to the Cloud
