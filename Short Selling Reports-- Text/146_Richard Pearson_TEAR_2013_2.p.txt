Earnings Miss Will Send TearLab Sharply Lower

Investment thesis


TearLab Corp. (NASDAQ:TEAR) has so far managed to drive moderate increases in
revenue over the past year, but only by spending a disproportionate amount on marketing.
The result has been ballooning losses in every quarter. The company has never earned a
profit. Following dozens of recent calls to the offices of eye doctors, it has become
apparent that the adoption of the TearLab product tends to be fleeting and driven primarily
by the marketing spend. As a result, the temporary boost in revenues resulting from this
marketing tends to be short lived and must be constantly replaced with new doctors who
will give the product a trial. Investors should be concerned that TearLab now gives away
its desktop reader for free in order to encourage doctors to make a trial of the product.


TearLab recently laid out a large seven figure pay package (roughly in line with a full
quarter's revenue) to hire Seph Jensen from Alcon Labs. His start date was scheduled to
begin just prior to the upcoming earnings release. This expensive hire should also signal
the company's desire to telegraph a much needed turnaround to stem ballooning losses.
The timing was likely urgent in order to have a visible solution in place prior to announcing
disappointing earnings. TearLab is likely to report a much larger loss on revenues which
are flat to down. The result is expected to be a share price decline of at least 25% to
around $8.50 or below. The hiring of Mr. Jensen will be positioned as a means of
addressing these problems going forward. On the earnings call, he will certainly announce
the company's plans for reducing the ballooning losses.


Background information


Lately, I have done quite well on several trades by aggregating information from non-
market sources ahead of earnings releases and placing my bets accordingly. There is
nothing illegal about this. Information which can be obtained by customers, suppliers and
competitors is all fair game as long as it is not supplied by company insiders. As described
below, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) follower Craig Froehle recently conducted similar analysis
right ahead of the $25 plunge at that company.


In August, I wrote an article just before the release of earnings at Francesca's Holdings
(NASDAQ:FRAN) which predicted that an earnings miss would lead to a 30% drop in the
share price. A few days later, Francesca's disappointed as predicted and the share price

quickly fell from $25.00 to less than $18.00. Analysts had continued to maintain price
targets as high as $38.00, so they were wrong by about 90%.


More recently, I predicted a similar 30% drop upon the release of earnings by Ignite
Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:IRG). Analysts had predicted that earnings might decline a
bit, but continued to maintain price targets of around $17-18. Following the release of
earnings this week, Ignite quickly traded down to below $11.99, also a nearly 30% decline
from the time of my article a few days earlier.


To me, both of these trades were painfully obvious. Rather than rely upon the bullish views
of sell side analysts, I turned off my computer and left my desk to conduct my own
research in person. With Francesca's, I visited numerous stores in various cities over the
span of several months. I then called dozens more and scoured the internet for evidence
of discounting. In its prior earnings call, Francesca's had noted that its practice of deep
discounting was coming to an end and margins would rebound accordingly. Analysts
believed and repeated this view almost verbatim. But my months of research showed that
the discounts were actually accelerating rather than declining. A steep earnings miss was
all but guaranteed. When it was reported, the stock quickly plunged as it should.


Prior to writing about IRG, I visited and called numerous restaurants across multiple states
and interviewed employees on each occasion. I also aggregated information on the
availability of discounts. It was clear that the company's turnaround strategy was failing
and that traffic was falling despite heavy discounting. The combination of much lower
traffic along with deep discounts meant that IRG was all but guaranteed to report a loss
rather than the analyst-predicted profit for the quarter. As expected, the share price
dropped to below $11.99, closing in on a new 52-week low.


This type of analysis is now becoming more widely used by a wider array of investors.
Investors have come to realize that the reports and targets of sell side analysts are
typically useless or downright dangerous. They are often little more than gratuitous quotes
from management along with lofty share price targets which get re-raised every time the
share prices rise.


Just prior to the release of Q3 earnings by Tesla, Seeking Alpha author Paulo Santos
wrote an article highlighting Craig Froehle's use of VIN number tracking to get an estimate
of vehicle production and sales at Tesla Motors. Mr. Santos states that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1821382-earnings-miss-will-send-tearlab-sharply-lower 3/16


The VIN data continues to be consistent with U.S. demand for the Model S having
peaked, and indeed, it's now consistent with that demand having already weakened
substantially.


One day later, seemingly bullet proof Tesla began a plunge of more than $30. The point is
that this type of grass roots analysis is becoming far more useful in predicting share prices
and earnings than the reports of ever bullish sell side analysts.


An earnings miss at TearLab should now be obvious


Just one year ago, TearLab was trading at below $4. The stock has since risen as high as
$15 - almost a quadruple. At its peak, TearLab hit just over half a billion in market cap.


The driver for the rise in the share price over the past year has been analyst enthusiasm
over revenue growth. On a percentage basis, the revenue growth has in fact been quite
large, in the range of triple digit percentages. But this is simply due to the fact that it is
growing off of a very small base of just over $1 million. The rise from a $4 share price to a
$15 share price has occurred even though revenues have risen from around $1 million to
just around $3.5 million. Yet the quarterly loss has increased from $2 million to over $12
million.


Recently, the stock has been trending down towards $10 in advance of the upcoming
earnings release. The reason should become apparent.


TearLab most recently reported revenues of just $3.5 million, up by $1 million from the
previous quarter. But its net loss ballooned from $8 million to $12 million in a single
quarter. The problem is clear. In order to increase revenues by just $1 million, TearLab
must incur a massively disproportionate increase in its net loss.


Over the past few quarters, this revenue trend has looked as follows:
5/22/2018 Earnings Miss Will Send TearLab Sharply Lower - TearLab Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1821382-earnings-miss-will-send-tearlab-sharply-lower 4/16


Analysts have been operating under the theory that at some point TearLab will end up
generating enough revenue to break through the losses. But it should be kept in mind that
the TearLab product has been on the market for over 5 years and significant sales have
yet to materialize. The recent growth of $1-2 million in sales has been largely the result of
a sharp increase in marketing spend. The result of the heavy spending has been the steep
surge in losses.


This might be an acceptable strategy if it was one that led to a sustained increase in
revenues in the long run. But with TearLab, it appears that the marketing spend is often
successful only in getting doctors to agree to an initial test of the system for a limited
period of time. When they fail to continue using it, it means that the marketing spend is
largely wasted and the revenues evaporate. TearLab then continues with its marketing
spend in an attempt to get more new doctors to conduct an initial test of the system.


TearLab's most recent earnings call was very brief. The company reported record
revenues of over $3 million in a quarter, but the company lost over $12 million for the
quarter. As a result, the company has already lost more in 1H 2013 than it did for full year
2012, its previous worst year ever.


The revenue vs. net loss for TearLab over the past 4 years is as follows. (The last column
on the right is YTD 2013).

Instead of discussing the earnings miss directly, the majority of the earnings call was spent
hearing a panel of hand selected experts offer their praise for the TearLab system. Of the
4 individuals, 3 were eye doctors while 1 was the CEO of the OCLI eye practice.


At the risk of stating the obvious, it should come as no surprise that the panel of 4 which
were hand selected by TearLab had very positive things to say about the product. Among
the doctors, some of them had been long term TearLab supporters going back for multiple
years. For example, Dr. Marguerite MacDonald is featured in TearLab's investor
presentation and has served as a TearLab promoter for several years (as seen here on
YouTube in 2011). Her support for TearLab has been unwavering, but it sheds little light
upon the adoption of the product by newer doctors who are not dry eye aficionados.


A much more instructive approach is to contact a wider assortment of doctors' offices who
are familiar with the product and get their review. In order to achieve this, one can simply
call the numbers listed on TearLab's website under "Find a Doctor." When prompted for
location, simply click "view all locations." A convenient list of all TearLab customers (along
with their phone numbers) then appears.


Over the past few weeks, I have contacted dozens of these doctors to ask about their
recommendations for conducting a dry eye exam. I did not discuss any interest in TearLab
as an investment.

As would be expected, there are a large number of doctors from TearLab's list who do
recommend a tear test. What does come as a surprise though, is that there are also a
large number of doctors who have received the test over the course of the past year but
no longer offer it, citing lack of need, inaccuracy or difficulty in getting reimbursed.


The doctors who do not recommend TearLab's test end up recommending the more
standard Schirmer test which has been used for many years along with a simple verbal
assessment.


In fact, this should not come as a surprise. After more than 5 years, use of TearLab's test
is still the vast exception to the rule. Healthcare sites such as the Mayo Clinic do not
mention TearLab's tear osmolarity test at all. Instead they recommend the Schirmer test or
simple verbal assessment.


The list of doctors on TearLab's website can be somewhat difficult to track. During the
course of my research, there were a number of additions to the list, representing new
doctors who appear to have been added in recent weeks. But there were also some
deletions representing doctors who must have either returned or abandoned the test.


TearLab had previously noted that less than 5% of doctors have ever returned a test to
TearLab. However, this does not account for the units which have simply been
discontinued in the practices of eye doctors nor does it account for doctors who have a
test unit but see no reason to use it over verbal assessment which is easier and free and
is not time consuming for the busy doctors.


The point from this is that the effect of TearLab's marketing spend often appears to be only
in getting some doctors to try the test for an initial and limited period. This clearly leads to
a short-term rise in revenue, but also a disproportionately large increase in marketing
expense. When the revenue is only short-lived, this becomes highly problematic. This is
likely what we have been seeing over the past 5 quarters and it explains the slight rises in
revenues along with much larger increases in the net loss at TearLab. TearLab appears to
be constantly in search of new doctors to replace the ones who will not adopt the test after
using it.


Looking at TearLab's product


A heavy marketing budget can drive sales of virtually any product for short periods of time.
But ultimately a product will need to justify itself if it is going to sell on its own.

The biggest problem with TearLab's product is that is just isn't necessary for the majority
of eye doctors. It is certainly true that the product is well liked by specific dry eye
specialists (such as those on TearLab's last earnings call).


The TearLab test allows doctors to quantify tear levels with a numerical score. This is why
the true dry eye only specialist practitioners like it. But for the regular eye practitioner, this
level of information is simply superfluous and is certainly not worth paying for or taking the
extra time from other waiting patients.


In most cases, doctors will simply ask their patients to describe their symptoms and then
prescribe corrective measures accordingly. This is not only faster, but it is also free. It also
addresses the problem to the satisfaction of the patient.


In some cases, doctors will use the industry standard Schirmer test.


The TearLab test does not offer the majority of practitioners any useable new information.
Either a patient has a condition worthy of treatment, or they do not. This is primarily based
on level of discomfort. The numeric score does not really add much additional value in a
practical setting.


In addition, because the test costs less than $30, there is very little revenue potential for
the eye doctor. As a result, there is neither an overwhelming financial or medical incentive
to use this test. It simply consumes time from office visits along with space on the desk for
the TearLab unit.


This is why the test which has been around for more than 5 years, still only shows a few
million dollars in sales and why these sales only tend to increase when accompanied by a
disproportionate marketing spend.


TearLab's method of dry eye testing has been described as the "new gold standard" for
dry eye testing since the early 1990's - nearly 20 years. It is by no means a new
technology waiting for widespread adoption.


In addition, TearLab continues to cite a whopping $1.5 billion market potential for the
product based on hope for sales to an estimated 50,000 eye doctors in the US. This
massive market potential claim has been consistent for years. Yet after all of this time,
new product sales continue to measure in just the hundreds of units for the entire year.
The device simply doesn't sell even after 5 years of marketing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1821382-earnings-miss-will-send-tearlab-sharply-lower 8/16


By this measure, use of TearLab's test accounts for roughly 2% of applicable dry eye tests
per year. And it should be remembered that even this low level is only the result of a very
heavy marketing spend.


In effect, the heavy marketing spend has resulted in a small number of doctors trying the
test for limited periods of time. But over the past 5 years, there has been no consistent
adoption of the test at a meaningful level. While marketing spend may get doctors to try
the test, it does not get them to continue using it. As a result, TearLab is on a never ending
search for more new trial doctors.


The hiring of Seph Jensen


On October 1st, TearLab announced the hiring of Seph Jensen from Alcon Labs where he
had previously served as Head of Surgical Marketing. The announcement quickly sent the
stock soaring to as high as $12.33. Since that time, the stock has now retreated by around
15%, giving up most of its gains.


The reason for the quick jump in the share price was obvious. At Alcon, Mr. Jensen
oversaw $1.4 billion in sales. If tiny TearLab with just a few million in sales could attract
this type of talent, then the company must be really headed in the right direction.


Unfortunately, there also appears to be a very different explanation for the timing of this
hire.


Mr. Jensen was set to start with TearLab on October 31st, just two weeks before earnings
are to be announced. It is very likely that the company will report a large earnings miss.
Hiring Mr. Jensen will not help to explain the miss which just happened. However, it will
allow the company to show shareholders that it is attempting to do something to slow the
ever increasing losses.


This view is supported by the fact that Mr. Jensen's compensation package was
astronomical for such a small company with minimal revenues and ongoing losses. Mr.
Jensen will receive a base salary of $370,000 which is moderate. But he will also receive
up to an additional 50% of this amount as an annual bonus. He also gets a signing bonus
of $250,000. So the initial payments amount to just under $1 million. However, he was
also granted 300,000 shares worth of options with a staggering 10 year maturity. The
value of these options alone is worth well over $2-3 million alone. For reference, even
short dated, 1 year at-the-money options on TearLab are worth around $2.50 per share at
present.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1821382-earnings-miss-will-send-tearlab-sharply-lower 9/16


All in all, the pay package awarded to Mr. Jensen is worth somewhere between $2-4
million at minimum, which is in line with a full quarter's entire revenue for the entire
company. For reference, the entire SG&A expense for Q1 was only $3.9 million. Yet a
similar amount is now being awarded to a single executive. The point is that Mr. Jensen
should be viewed as an extremely expensive hire for TearLab.


The timing of this very expensive hire coming just before earnings suggests that TearLab
is looking to provide investors with some level of comfort in the face of another quarter of
ballooning losses. In any event, there is nothing out there to suggest that there has been
any change leading into this quarter which will stem the pace of the accelerating
consecutive losses from past quarters.


Conclusion


In recent cases, aggregating non-market information helped me accurately predict a
significant earnings miss which presaged a quick share price decline of around 30% in
several stocks.


Prior to the release of earnings for Francesca's and Ignite Restaurant Group, I came to the
conclusion that an earnings miss was highly likely in each case. I came to this conclusion
based on dozens of phone calls and in-person visits which revealed that business was not
going to live up to the highly bullish expectations of analysts who cover the stock. The on
the ground information I obtained was far more useful than the reports from analysts
which simply repeated the views of management.


Making dozens of visits and phone calls is far from a scientific approach, but it has proven
to be consistently useful to me.


With TearLab, I have called dozens of eye doctors to ask about their use of the TearLab
product. I specifically called the doctors who are currently (or were previously) listed on
the TearLab web site as carrying the TearLab test.


While there are naturally a large number of doctors who do carry this test, there are also a
surprisingly large number of doctors who had previously used the test but who no longer
recommend it to prospective patients. Even among the doctors who do carry it, they do
not necessarily state that it is part of their standard dry eye exam. The Schirmer test and
verbal assessment tend to remain the standard even among many TearLab customers.


The conclusion from this is that the revenue gains from TearLab's expensive marketing
efforts in some cases end up being very short-lived. In many cases, the doctors noted that
there were several options for evaluating dry eye conditions. But in only a few cases did

Comments (32)


the doctors immediately tell me that the TearLab solution was a must.


The conclusion I have reached is that TearLab is likely to once again show a very large
increase in marketing spend which will be accompanied by revenues which are either flat
to down. This is simply due to a relatively underwhelming adoption of the tear test despite
the heavy marketing spend. The result will be a loss which is larger than last quarter and
which is moderately to significantly larger than expected by the street.


Mr. Jensen will then be given the stage to explain how things are about to change in
coming quarters.


I am expecting TearLab to fall to around $8.00-$8.50 following earnings, with potential for
further downside in the weeks that follow.


In the meantime, TearLab is a company which sports a $350 million market cap despite
cumulative revenues of just $15 million over the past 5 years running. During this time,
cumulative losses are now approaching $50 million without a single profit, with losses
continuing to grow each quarter.

Jason, 
it doesnt even matter at this point. market has priced in the lack of forward guidance. obviously the market
was expecting better than the sell side analysts.


This article did its work. stock has dropped a ton. now this risk/reward favor of being short is not nearly as
great as it was when the article was written. in fact, getting long for a bounce from $8.50 upward would be
something to consider.

Excellent work on calling around and gauging interest. It's pretty much a given that despite Craig-Hallum's relentless
pumping, and even a pump from Cramer, the stock will eventually come back to earth.


However, I'm less certain about this quarter in particular. Since there has been poor adoption by doctors for some
time now, it seems the only new piece of evidence for an earnings miss is the Jensen hire. It does make sense that
he'll be useful to mitigate the damage and disappointment from TearLab's unprofitability. I agree with you here, but
you have additional rationale for why this quarter (in particular) will be so ugly?


08 Nov 2013, 01:13 PM


frankstonet
You should try and do some basic dd before making silly comments like there has been poor adoption. This
test has ramped up a lot faster than many, including the analysts, predicted. Will the growth stop at some
point? Probably. But at this early stage of the rollout I wouldn't want to try and guess when or where the stock
might be then.

He was correct in that there was in fact an equity offering. However, the stock was pumped so vigorously
(Cramer boosted the stock 10-15% at one point) that TearLab didn't need to issue equity at the low price he
predicted.


What justifies the stock doubling in price? Bullish reports from Craig-Hallum, who stood to profit from an
equity offering? Jim Cramer's infinite wisdom and sagacity, indeed, Cramer's "experience" with TearLab in its
former guise as OccuLogix before it went off a precipitous cliff?

The most recent loss was only .15 cents cash. While we are not by nature "easy" on company managements, given
the massive recent secondary there will not be a large amount of pressure on the company in a survival sense even if
the loss is significant.


Do you believe that the presentation of "just" another big loss will be enough to really hurt the stock in this idiotic
market environment?


We wonder if it will be.


You article is very impressive.

nothing like feathering your own nest, didn't during the last conference call which was a weak (misplaced attempt to

based on the difficulty stemming from being reimbursed.......I even called the Dr's you listed. Calling into question at
least for your accuracy would be to note FDA approval on 12/5/2011. So! wouldn't that date start the clock which
means a whole 23 months certainly not your stretch of five years. Now for #'s you neglected six months ending

Not sure about FDA approval but doctors couldn't use it in practice or get paid for it until CLIA was granted in

months ago vs his claimed stretch of 5 years. Other serious but basic flaws in reasoning....doctor's nurse
does the test so it doesn't actually take any of the doctors' time, doctor does have to do the "industry standard
[but woefully inaccurate] Schirmer test", but the doctor doesn't get insurance reimbursed anything for doing
that, doctor does get insurance payment for tearlab test, the symptoms of dry eye mimic those for a large
number of other eye conditions while osmolarity does not, some papers I read concluded that up to half of an
average eye doctor's patients have dry eye but neither the doctor or the patient knows that without tearlab.

I like your reasoning, and you were pretty much dead-on with your IRG call.

myquestion
Speaking about the TearLab's net loss, does the portion of non-cash expense on warrant revaluation matter?

Richard,


Can you please comment on the outcome after earnings were declared?


Can you please also comment on the legitimate point regarding CLIA waiver rather than taking a 5 year perspective --
that is a game impacting item.


Thank you.

5/22/2018 Earnings Miss Will Send TearLab Sharply Lower - TearLab Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAR) | Seeking Alpha

Author’s reply »  the cost of the test is so low (less than $30) that reimbursement should not have mattered
massively if the test actually mattered.


the point is that people will only take this incredibly cheap test if it is free...and even then it is not widely used.


the test has been marketed for 5 years and yet simply does not get uptake from doctors.


it had been described as "the NEW gold standard" for dry eye testing in 1994. If the med community hasn't
adopted it by now, then it probably doesn't have a bright future.


we have seen once again that they can drive small incremental increases in sales...but only through very
large marketing spend.

Richard, TEAR actually came in higher on sales and lower on loss than analyst estimates. They beat on all
counts. So, looks like the only "miss" was yours.


12 Nov 2013, 09:08 PM


Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  congrats. you obviously know how to read and repeat the brief headline that came out on
TEAR. But if you take a closer look at the numbers, you will understand why the stock is now down 10%
despite this "beat"

Richard, when you're wrong you should man up and admit it. You were wrong. Nothing in the numbers.
Nothing negative at least. They beat on every line. Growth was phenomenal, especially in the seasonally
weakest quarter. Stock is up around 30% from your original article in the Spring.


13 Nov 2013, 06:10 PM


Renmycat!
frank, 
because you made so much money being long on the earnings report.


13 Nov 2013, 07:33 PM


frankstonet
TEAR results out. Looks like they BEAT on both top and bottom lines. Revs 4.2 vs analyst 4.0 and loss of 0.12 vs
analyst 0.14 .


12 Nov 2013, 09:11 PM


Renmycat!
and let me guess? horrible forward guidance, sends the stock down sharply after hours. 
1st post? and 6th post? pretty much sums it up. good luck boys!


13 Nov 2013, 02:53 AM


jasonfrom222
No forward guidance at all actually. Never is. But Q4 and Q1 are usually their strongest, so have fun covering
anytime soon.


Bottom line is even after the inexplicable sell off stock is STILL 30% higher than at Richard's original short call
in the spring. Ouch!

Author’s reply »  thanks all. i do not really care much about the semantics of whether or not they want to call this a
"beat" or a "miss" in the headlines.


i guess my only point was that the numbers would be bad and the stock would trade sharply lower.


i spent months doing this research, including dozens of phone calls to doctors around the country. this was the same
type of work i did on IRG and FRAN and the results ended up being reliable and predicitve.

Richard, looking back you were right. I don't have much hope in the stock, but did ride the waves up from Cramer and
other positive reports. Covered at $12 and was safe, and am hesitating to buy in again at even today's $7.


If their marketing boost continues, the revenue may stay around the same numbers we saw last Q, but I think by then
most people will have caught onto your mentality and there will be another drop. Hence I am scared to buy in again
your thoughts?


Thanks for the great article.
