AOB Chairman’s Questionable Second Passport
and Potential Undisclosed Conflicts of Interest.


Posted on September 22, 2009 by Asensio.com


The chairman and CEO of American Oriental Bioengineering, Inc.


(NYSE: AOB), Shujun “Tony” Liu, used a second passport from the


Commonwealth of Dominica in addition to his Chinese passport in


corporate filings with the Hong Kong Companies Registry (“HKCR”).


Liu has appeared in publicly-available HKCR filings as a director for


at least nine different Hong Kong companies.


Five of these companies appear to be indirect subsidiaries of AOB,


but only one of them has been listed as a subsidiary in AOB’s SEC


filings. All of AOB’s subsidiaries should be disclosed in SEC filings.


The absence of adequate disclosures raises questions about why the


company has subsidiaries not disclosed to investors. Liu has


disclosed ownership interests in two of the companies. His role and


duties in these companies, and any possible conflicts, are also not


disclosed in AOB’s filings.

with which Tony Liu is associated. These can be obtained online


from the Hong Kong Companies Registry website.


In some of these companies’ filings, Liu has been listed with a


Chinese passport number as identification. In others, Liu is listed


with a Dominica passport number. Liu has used two different


Dominica passport numbers.


Attached are HKCR filings of two different companies showing two


different Commonwealth of Dominica passport numbers for Tony


Liu: American Oriental Bioengineering (Hong Kong) Limited and


Silver Linkage Holdings Limited.


Silver Linkage is not a subsidiary of AOB, but involves not just Liu


but also AOB’s CFO, an AOB co-founder and director, and one of

AOB’s independent directors, in an apparent plan to build Silver


“into one of the finest pharmaceutical companies in the world.”

The Commonwealth of Dominica is a small Caribbean nation with a


population of approximately 75,000. To raise money, beginning in


the early 1990’s Dominica created an “Economic Citizenship


Program,” whereby individuals from other countries can purchase


passports for approximately US$75,000, or $100,000 for a family of


four, according to the U.S. Department of State and a


Commonwealth of Dominica website.


According to a 2008 BBC report, Canada has imposed travel


restrictions on holders of Dominica passports, citing “their


economic citizenship programmes as posing criminal, security and


border integrity concerns.”


A U.S. State Department report on money laundering from 2008


states, “Dominica’s Economic Citizenship Program does not appear


to be adequately regulated. In the past, subjects of United States


criminal investigations have been identified as exploiting the


program.”


The State Department report also describes Dominica’s growth as a


tax haven appealing to international criminals: “The


Commonwealth of Dominica initially sought to attract offshore


dollars by offering a wide range of confidential financial services,


low fees, and minimal government oversight. A rapid expansion of


Dominica’s offshore sector without proper supervision made it


attractive to international criminals and vulnerable to official


corruption.”


Many within Dominica have acknowledged problems with the


economic citizenship program. The program became a divisive


political issue within Dominica around the time of the 2000


elections. At that time, a spokesman for the opposition party stated,


“What the government is doing with the rampant selling of


passports to criminals and criminal gangs all over the world is to


eventually establish Dominica as a center for international crime,”


according to an Associated Press report.


Dominica’s then Prime Minister, Pierre Charles, stated in 2001, “A


number of people who held Dominican passports were discovered


to have had criminal records,” according to a BBC story.


The Los Angeles Times echoed these comments in an article from


February 20, 2000: “U.S. and British law enforcement officials say


this nation of 75,000 people has opened itself to threats from


Russian and Chinese organized crime figures and international


money launderers. The threat comes, U.S. officials say, through the


island’s controversial Economic Citizenship Program…”

According to HKCR records, Mr. Liu has had a Dominica passport


since at least April 2004, when AOB was listed on the OTC bulletin


board. The question arises of why the chairman and CEO of an


NYSE-listed company would use multiple passports in regulatory


filings for Hong Kong companies that include several subsidiaries of


AOB, and indeed, why he would have a passport from Dominica at


all. At the least, it raises an appearance of inappropriateness and


suggests Mr. Liu is not sufficiently counseled on corporate


governance standards acceptable to U.S. investors.


In what is yet another disclosure issue for AOB, for all nine of the


Hong Kong companies where Liu is a director, the corporate


secretary is Hotex Company Secretary Limited. Hotex is a part of


accounting firm K.P. Cheng & Co., which partners with Weinberg &


Company, AOB’s auditor until mid-August 2009, in providing audit


services, according to K.P. Cheng’s website. The connection between


the corporate secretary of AOB’s subsidiaries, other corporations


where Liu has a personal interest, and AOB’s former U.S. auditor


appears to be a potential source of conflicts-of-interest.


A report issued by asensio.com on August 5 analyzed disclosures


made by AOB concerning a reported $105 million spent in property


transactions. Click here to access the report. The report compared


disclosures made by AOB in SEC filings with those made in filings


with Chinese regulatory agencies. Following the asensio.com report,


AOB issued a statement offering an explanation. The explanation is


provided and commented upon in an August 7th asensio.com


report. AOB has not yet, however, provided complete


documentation to fully support its explanation, which in our


opinion should include a copy of an independent appraisal of the


acquired property.
