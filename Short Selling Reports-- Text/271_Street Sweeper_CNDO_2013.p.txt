Coronado Biosciences: A Master Puppeteer's Folly?
Jul. 15, 2013 3:08 PM ET11 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Coronado Biosciences (NASDAQ: CNDO) is tangled amid a bizarre whipworm therapeutic
candidate, jail birds, cozy relationships, crazy financing, decimated companies controlled
by a master puppeteer - and just now a brand new $200 million shelf registration.


And it's all precisely timed. The company is rolling out public stock offerings - and filed the
new S-3 that will further dilute the stock with millions upon millions of additional shares -
just before clinical trial results are released.


Is this because CNDO suspects its key candidate - live pig whipworm eggs - won't work?
Does the company suspect that it will never even reach phase III?


Despite several negative study results, CNDO is testing its pig whipworm eggs to treat
auto-immune diseases, a medical area populated by fierce pharma companies with deep
pockets.


Independent investigators recently conducted trials based on batches of 2,500 parasitic
eggs, culled from pig manure, that hatched out in patients' guts. The parasitic egg
cocktails caused three to 19 times more incidences of pain and other severe side effects -
typically lasting for weeks - than in patients on a placebo.


In fact, the results were so bad that over a dozen patients stopped gulping down their
worm egg drinks before the study ended.


Similar risks turned up in three separate studies - all apparently ignored by Burlington,
Mass-based CNDO. And even though independent study authors urged fewer eggs per
dose in future testing, some patients will slurp down three times more - 7,500 worm eggs -
in each dose every two weeks, under a new study that CNDO is resolutely conducting.


Set up for dilution


Despite the negatives, the stock more than tripled over the last year to reach an all-time
high of $12.70 on April 23.


Days later, CNDO filed an ongoing at-the-market offering on April 29 to sell $45 million
worth of stock at the company's whim.

Was that enough? No. According to the newest S-3, the company amended the ATM
offering so it could sell up to $70 million worth of stock.


And was that enough? No, still not enough. This bleeding company with a highly
debatable product in fact quietly filed this new shelf registration after market close July 12.
Once effective, CNDO will be able to distribute $200 million worth of stock or warrants
from time to time over three years, as determined by market conditions. This represents
tremendous dilution and overhang for a company with a market cap of about $234 million.


Keep in mind the timing is key: shortly before phase II clinical trial results for Crohn's
disease are expected to be announced in the second half of this year.


What if CNDO had expected good study results that justified going into phase III trials?
The answer is obvious. It would have waited to raise so much money because it is burning
through only about $23 million last year.


Since CNDO execs seem to have serious doubts about their therapeutic candidate's
usefulness, they want to grab that money now. We believe the company has to do this
now so it will be able to find and buy other therapeutic candidates before investors lose
their confidence in the company.


This is the very same pattern that we'll later show was set by Genta and Ventrus
Biosciences, decimated companies essentially controlled by master puppeteer Lindsay
Rosenwald - the man behind CNDO. Called a "promoter" in SEC filings, he is a director of
the CNDO board and majority shareholder who has controlled the company since the
beginning.


Rosenwald repeatedly recruits and installs the managers, directors and point men of his
biotech ventures. Characters like Morty Davis, Bobby Sandage, Glenn Cooper, J. Jay
Lobell, Russell Ellison and David Barrett.


Rosenwald also consistently uses financial institutions under his control to raise money for
these ventures that other institutions avoid. He has either solely or largely owned or
managed numerous companies under his venture capital firm Paramount Biosciences
LLC and holds significant ownership of National Securities Corp. and parent company
National Holdings Corp., big players in CNDO and many other Rosenwald companies.


These companies owned or controlled by Rosenwald have managed various convertible
debt and stock offerings for CNDO, handing him a total of about $5.3 million in fees
through his entities along with about 809,907 shares of common and Series C stock.

Associated service fees also made Rosenwald richer. His solely-owned Paramount
Biosciences charged the company $25,000 a month plus up to $5,000 monthly out-of-
pocket expenses for two years.


So, Rosenwald successfully manipulates the strings of a tangle of managers, directors
and financial institutions behind his many promotions.


Unfortunate link: The fen-phen disaster


CNDO character Bobby Sandage, company president until recently, made an
unforgettable and highly unfortunate impression as a key manager at Interneuron
Pharmaceuticals, a company co-founded and financed by Rosenwald.


Interneuron itself may not be that memorable until one makes the connection between the
company and its disastrous anti-obesity drug. Redux (dexfenfluramine) was a chemical
compound related to the "fen" in the "fen-phen" drug cocktail that became a weight-loss
rage until safety concerns led to it being removed from the U.S. market in 1997.


Sandage was Interneuron's R&D officer when he told an FDA officer "off the record" in
March 1994 that his concerns about the safety of Interneuron's Redux "might be strong
enough to consider withdrawing the NDA," or new drug application.


"I asked Dr. Sandage what Interneuron intended to do about the safety issues that they
themselves recognized. Dr. Sandage said that withdrawal, from a financial standpoint, was
really out of the question because the company would be ruined," the officer continued,
according to Alice Mundy's book "Dispensing with the Truth."


A September 1994 FDA memo stated, "Bobby Sandage recently told me that Interneuron
had nothing to lose and would stop at nothing to get dexfenfluramine approved."


But in April 1996, the FDA approved the diet drug. Investors eagerly bought up the stock
of the blockbuster drug that everyone thought should eventually be worth $600 million in
yearly sales. The stock shot to more than $39 per share.


Yet there were indications that all was not quite perfect: "The company that makes Redux,
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, and its distributor, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, contend
neurological problems are not a major worry," CNN said in announcing approval of the diet
drug.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1549342-coronado-biosciences-a-master-puppeteers-folly 4/14


Everything collapsed about a year later. Under pressure from the Mayo Clinic about safety
risks, the diet drugs were voluntarily withdrawn from the market in September 1997 by
Interneuron and partner American Home Products (Wyeth-Ayerst), which later indemnified
Interneuron. Interneuron stock plunged to the $13 range.


More than 3,000 lawsuits, many of them class action, were filed concerning product
liability issues surrounding Interneuron and its partner.


Rosenwald and Interneuron president Dr. Glenn Cooper were individually named in one
class action lawsuit that focused on allegations of misrepresented facts about the drug.


Rosenwald ultimately took Interneuron personnel resources Cooper and Sandage with
him to CNDO. In terms of financial resources, Interneuron attracted a lot of investment
from Rosenwald's relatives. His father-in-law, J. Morton "Morty" Davis, whose firm D.H.
Blair and Co. handled private and public stock offerings for Interneuron, owned most of
the company. Other significant shareholders included Rosenwald's brothers-in-law, both
Blair officers. We'll go into their intriguing biographies later in this article.


Mauled by the diet drug disaster, Interneuron eventually became Indevus
Pharmaceuticals. In 2009, Endo Pharmaceuticals acquired Indevus. If any Interneuron
shareholders were still holding on, they watched the value of their stock once worth as
much as $39 dive to $4.50 under the acquisition.


Rosenwald's boom companies go bust


Those dismal days were a stark contrast to the company's boom time, when Interneuron's
chairman Rosenwald was named in May 1996 as one of the nation's top biotech
millionaires. The value of his Interneuron stock at that time was estimated at $71.2 million.


In fact, Rosenwald was named a top biotech millionaire numerous times. As such, he was
recognized for amassing more than $336 million in Interneuron stock plus stock in these
companies:


*Avax Technologies: deregistered in March 2009, now worth about a penny.


*Biocryst: losing money, stock price then: $24-$30; stock price now: ~ $1.63.


*Neose: filed a certificate of dissolution in March 2009.


*Genta: a disastrous company that we'll delve into later.


CNDO timing unlike Interneuron for good reason

There is one striking difference between CNDO and Interneuron. Unlike CNDO,
Interneuron waited until after big trial results and FDA approval in April 1996 to offer
Interneuron shares to the public two months later and a Rosenwald-controlled private
placement six months later.


Interneuron execs waited because they knew they had it in the bag. While CNDO is
grabbing capital when there's still some hope left in its key product, Interneuron execs saw
no need to rush out with financing because they apparently expected positive trial results.


Footsteps of Genta


If CNDO is moving forward with clinical trials, we can assume there's a good chance of
positive results - right?


Not necessarily.


Not when we consider the pattern set by another Rosenwald-supported company, Genta
Inc.(OTC: GNTAQ.PK), that rolled out stock offerings just before clinical trials were
released.


Now a pink sheet stock that can't be given away, Genta became the poster child for toxic
financial deals, U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejections and horrible clinical trials.


The Genta cancer drugs disaster took a couple of decades and numerous financial
infusions to unfold. One-time majority owner Rosenwald handled a 1997 private stock sale
through his solely owned Paramount Capital that generated more than $14 million for
Genta. His healthy commission of over $1 million was just a fraction of what he ultimately
indirectly pulled in from this dying company.


A few years later those investors must have watched in horror as Genta's clinical studies
ended in devastation again and again. Three phase III clinical trials failed in 2003 and
2004. Yet the company insisted on sending the drugs out for FDA approval anyway.


The company offered stock and convertible notes worth about $10 million in July 2009,
while investors still hung on to fruitless hopes for success in some of its clinical trials. But
the following October, sure enough, poor results were released for a second round of its
drug trials, having already failed in a previous trial in melanoma. Rosenwald had already
sold 10 million shares of stock under his control for about $49.6 million in May 3, 2004, the
final stock sale day noted in a Genta class action lawsuit.

CNDO investors might wonder: Why would Genta keep trying again and again, even after
disastrous trial results? Money.


Genta couldn't seem to produce a successful product. Yet, somehow, optimistic investors
apparently kept thinking phase III trials would surely lead to success. All Genta needed
was more money ... and more to get yet another shot at success.


Ultimately, surprise, the FDA ruled against Genta's drugs and the company lost a crucial
$480 million deal with Aventis.


The whole mess led to a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing last year.


Just like CNDO, the beleaguered company got a ton of financial support from Rosenwald's
businesses and a couple of Genta's characters moved on to occupy powerful positions at
CNDO, too. The Aries fund managed by Rosenwald designated to Genta's board both
Bobby Sandage, until recently CNDO's president and director, and Glenn Cooper, until
recently CNDO's chairman of the board.


Here's how the Genta chart looks:


CNDO look-alike Ventrus Biosciences: Rosenwald-founded, study failure and
current lawsuit target


Class action litigation target in the past few weeks, Ventrus Biosciences (NYSE: VTUS)
also was founded by Rosenwald, a former significant stockholder.


VTUS wasn't a proper cocktail party topic but it certainly got some major respect in May
2011. That's when high hopes for its hemorrhoid treatment candidate, VEN 309, shot the
stock price to the $20- $21 range, more than three times its IPO price.

But the company's lead product suddenly blew up. In 24 hours, the stock collapsed from
$12 to $5 when the pivotal phase III VEN 309 clinical trial failed in June 2012. The
hemorrhoid drug that VTUS had spent $55.8 million acquiring, researching and developing
was suddenly gone for good.


VTUS today trades at just over $2.


Among the slew of recent pending lawsuits, allegations seem to center on whether VTUS
suggested the FDA would approve VEN 309 and whether VTUS made false and
misleading statements that artificially inflated the stock.


Rosenwald and company used a head-spinning shuffle of money and people to build up
VTUS. These include CNDO director David Barrett, former CFO of the delisted Neuro-
HiTech, who is currently chief financial officer for VTUS. Barrett serves there with VTUS
president/CEO/CMO/chairman Russell Ellison, who's also held key positions in a couple of
other Rosenwald companies.


Companies wholly owned, largely owned or managed by Rosenwald - including a slew of
companies under his venture capital firm Paramount Biosciences LLC (where CNDO
director J. Jay Lobell was also Paramount president and has held various positions in
numerous Paramount companies) - made arrangements to float VTUS millions of dollars
through notes, securing bank loans (one personally guaranteed by Rosenwald in
exchange for his right to attend board meetings and appoint board members) and then
paying off a line of credit with proceeds from a note issued by another bank.


Throw in promissory notes issued to Rosenwald-managed Paramount Credit Partners
resulting in 287,570 warrants.


Under the heading "potential conflicts of interest," add a cushy $25,000 per month
consulting fee for Rosenwald's Paramount Corporate Development.


Throw in several follow-on offerings, including the July 2011 offering co-underwritten by
Rosenwald-beneficially owned National Securities Corp. (adding a six-figure cash boost to
its coffers and warrants for tens of thousands of shares). The public offering generated
$51.75 million for VTUS mostly to waste on that failed hemorrhoid treatment.


Though other investors may have lost out, it appears that, through his companies,
Rosenwald established a pattern of walking away from biotech deals with pockets full of
cash and equities.

Prison sentences for associates


Several jail birds have touched the extended family business.


It was just in May that David Blech was sentenced to four years in prison for stock fraud.
The judge said there'd be no mercy for the "serial stock manipulator" who pleaded guilty
last year for a second time.


In 1980, Blech was a 24-year-old stockbroker who created a healthcare company called
Genetic Systems Corp. with his 30-year-old brother, Isaac. The brothers read about a
technology to churn out monoclonal antibodies, found an expert scientist and began
putting together financing for their company. Finally, they approached D.H. Blair and Co.
about underwriting a public offering. Several years before Rosenwald joined Blair, the
Blair-underwritten offering hit the market at $2 apiece in June 1981, pulling in $6.6 million.


D.H. Blair and Co. is the once-struggling brokerage firm Rosenwald's famous father-in-
law, J. Morton "Morty" Davis joined. Davis invested in it and turned it into a raging success
as the underwriter of small cap companies steeped in the kind of risk that other firms just
couldn't stomach. Before he began building his biotech empire, the serious, curly-locked
Rosenwald worked as the Blair finance director from 1987 to 1992, alongside two
brothers-in-law.


Years of dodging securities investigators ended with Blair and its top brass hit by a 173-
count indictment. Prosecutors called it "a massive scheme of securities fraud" and "price
manipulation" allegedly conducted from 1989 until Blair shut down in 1998. The mess later
undoubtedly generated rapt attention during testimony before Congress on organized
crime infiltrating Wall Street.

Unlike his two brothers-in-law, one who was sentenced to prison in 2002 and the other
who got probation, Rosenwald was not indicted.


Neither was Davis - a former Brooklyn ragamuffin who once somberly told conference
visitors,"I can't think of anything nice to say about myself." Davis had been the key figure
at Blair for two decades until he broke up the company to give the retail brokerage part to
relatives in 1992 and retain the investment banking part for himself.


Rosenwald moved past those difficult years and continued to work his business deals,
ultimately moving on to CNDO and its bizarre key product.


Take 7,500 parasitic eggs and call me in the morning


Strange though it may sound, CNDO's key candidate is thousands upon thousands of
whipworm eggs.


That would be a dose of thousands of viable whipworm eggs down the hatch every two
weeks.


These parasitic worm eggs collected from pig feces are cleaned up and placed in a clear
liquid so the patient can slurp down thousands of them in each tablespoonful.


The idea - actually hypothesis - is that thousands of parasitic larvae hatch in the patient's
gut and affect the immune system to help keep the body from mistakenly attacking itself to
produce diseases such as Crohn's and psoriasis.


The company says the whipworm treatment is likely safe and effective. Yet, a couple of
independent studies indicate that the treatment could pose risk to patients, including
persistent diarrhea and severe pain, the same issues associated with inflammatory bowel
disease.


Published in August 2011, one study sought to detail adverse reactions found in an earlier
trial.


"In conclusion, during the first two months, ingestions of 2500 T. suis eggs caused
frequent episodes with moderate to severe gastrointestinal reactions lasting up to two
weeks," investigators wrote.


Investigators wrote, "... we detected a significantly higher rate and duration of more severe
(i.e. moderate to severe) gastrointestinal symptoms, which we therefore interpreted as
side effects ..."

CNDO recently completed recruitment of 250 patients with moderate to severe Crohn's
disease for its phase II safety and efficacy trial, "Trust-1." Results are considered a "key
stock catalyst."


CNDO chief executive Harlan Weisman said in the recent earning call, "... we remain on
target to announce topline results from this trial in the second half of the year.


Fierce competition


Biotechnology is highly competitive and packed with numerous large companies with
much more money and people working on the very diseases CNDO targets with its two
products - the "TSO" whipworm technology and the product derived from cancer cells
designed to activate natural killer cells or NK in the human immune system that seek and
destroy cancer.


We're focusing on the whipworm eggs that the company considers its key product. CNDO
paid $20.7 million in 2011 to Asphelia Pharmaceuticals for exclusive rights to the parasitic
pig eggs or "CNDO-201." Asphelia was founded in 2007 by Rosenwald through his
Paramount BioSciences (why create a second company if the first company already had a
product believed worth commercializing?) Also, current CNDO director J. Jay Lobell was
Asphelia's chief executive and director. Both are also affiliated with Paramount Credit
Partners, whose loan to Asphelia was assumed by CNDO.


Those eggs are facing biggies fighting Crohn's, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)
subsidiaries that sell Remicade and another increasingly popular drug called Symponi,
while UCB S.A. and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABA), respectively offer Cimzia and
Humira, both of which are already approved to treat Crohn's and several other diseases.


Some competitors' drugs are so good that even CNDO-hosted experts can't resist talking
about their effectiveness. A CNDO expert commented during a recent analyst day that
drugs by Merck, Novartis, Lily and Amgen are "extremely effective."


Additionally, an estimated 80 new therapies exist in the pipeline for Crohn's treatment and
numerous research avenues exist for scientists to pursue toward treating Crohn's and
similar diseases.


For multiple sclerosis, another CNDO targeted issue, competitors include Biogen Idec Inc.
(NASDAQ: BIIB), Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceutical, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries
(NYSE: TEVA) and Novartis (NYSE: NVS).

Comments (11)


During the recent earnings call, an analyst asked the CEO how the company plans to
move forward.


Weisman said they will look at several factors, including, "what is the likelihood that TSO
(the whipworm therapeutic) is going to work?"


No one can be more anxious to learn the answer to that question than the folks who've
bought into this puppet show. No investor will want to miss the final act.

she really decimated the stock today. this is one of the worst hatchet jobs I've ever read, citing things from 20
years ago?!? this new guy running the company must be getting taken for a ride, he probably has minimal
experience in the pharmaceutical/biotech arena. I'm going to look him up, just for the goof. amazing how it's
getting all this good coverage from the street, don't they see all the horrible trial results?


anyway, what an objective piece this was, nice to see a writer without an agenda.

Well, at least the writers of this one admit they are short CNDO. This certainly is an obvious attempt to manipulate the
stock price. 
Looks like the "several negative study results" reference is to the gastro discomfort suffered by very few subjects for
all of TWO WEEKS, in the context of diseases (Crohn & Ulcerative Colitis) that cause victims years, and sometimes
decades of misery, which leaves many poor souls no option but to have sections of their intestines resected and
removed until there is nothing left. NO OTHER SIDE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN observed. The prior trial results have
been OVERWHELMINGLY successful, showing 70% remission rates in Crohn's patients and excellent results in a
Double blind placebo controlled study for ulcerative colitis. The characterization of the existing drugs on the market as
extremely effective is laughable. Those drugs are the best out there, but they often do not work and have toxic side
effects and cause many diseases, including cancer. Assuming Coronado's TSO works, which is likely, its safety profile
appears VASTLY SUPERIOR to existing drugs, and it potentially would capture an enormous part of the auto-immune
disease market.To be concerned with the management team at Coronado is also nothing short of laughable. Harlan
Weisman, George Avgerinos, and Thomas Schaible!!! It reads like an all-star team of managers instrumental in the
success of the largest selling auto-immune drugs of all-time. Please, find me a company in stage two trials with better
managers, I will buy it tomorrow. Rosenwald does not run this company. Yes he has a big ownership stake and
certainly has a long history in investing in early stage biotechs, and since a large majority of such companies fail, it is
no wonder that you are able to identify some failed companies with which he has been involved. Of course no
mention of Cougar biotechnology, which sold for a billion dollars. What about Rosenwald's ownership and
involvement there? I could go on and on but I really find this type of attempt to dishonestly manipulate a stock
offensive. I would love to see you fellas still short this baby in October when the Crohn's trial results come out. Then
you will have gotten what you deserve.

Bigwig99,


You make excellent points about this article and the previous CNDO article before. I'm long and heavily
overweighted on this stock as well. I see these price drops as an opportunity for cheaper stock to buy. I'm
sure most investors don't bother to research CNDO and just take an advisor's word for it. They also don't
bother to research the correlation between the increase in Hygiene in modern first world countries to the
increase in autoimmune diseases. All the information is out there on this company, ultra hygienic cultures and
the physiological effects of many types of parasites on the human body, it is just up to the investor to look it up
and stick to their decision. I'm going to wait patiently and reap the rewards on this one.

Interesting article with some strong considerations, but also some weaknesses (I'll let readers do their own due
diligence). I've read these kinds of articles before, articles that focus only on the team and exclude company and
product. This reads more like slanted biographies than neutral reporting. I'll take your short disclosure alongside this
article with a grain of salt.

Taking your route of looking at biographies rather than product, let's not forget that Rosenwald has also founded his
fair share of successes, such as Cougar Biotech, which sold to J&J for nearly $1bn before even getting its product to
market. Meanwhile, CNDO recently hired Thomas Schaible, who was involved in developing J&J's blockbuster drug
Remicade.


Yes, CNDO could use the proceeds of its offering to acquire new products, but it could also put the funds to work on
clinical trials for current indications. CNDO allowed its Crohn's trial to overflow; not the type of action a company
would take if it were concerned its drug would fail, which would make it more cost conscious ahead of time.


I appreciate a counterweight to all the good news the company's been getting, but disagree with many of the points
made here.


I'm long CNDO.

Once a prospective investor looks at the efficacy of the treatment and how many of the test subjects enthusiastically
wish to continue, you will thank this author for providing such a nice price on the common. this is a beautiful spot to
start building a position. 
Thank you, Street Sweeper, for this opportunity.

We have someone in our family that caused me to get deep into the bowels of the clinical trials. (Hey, the jokester that
wrote this piece was talking sh*t, why can't I?)


The reality is that the clinical trials are going amazingly well. Consider this point, you have two top execs from the
Remicade and Humira teams, and Dr. Avgerinos/SVP, Biologics comes to CNDO with deep experience in developing
manufacturing/supply chain operations. Think he was added to the team just to sit around in the off chance that
something might, just maybe.... happen? Of course not! The Phase II results are going to drive discussion of moving
into production mode.


But naysayers will say nay, until they get caught with their pants down. Got in extremely heavy at the first of this year.
I bought in another decent chunk back in March, and took a another, albeit smaller chunk a couple of weeks ago at
$7.90.


It's all about what is being experienced in Phase II. Worst side effect is 100 times better than the best day of
Remicade. And every month another huge amount of gastro docs are being made aware of CNDO. Docs that hadn't
heard of it last December are definitely in the know now. There is a reason for it.

Are they not confident? Do they want to take this to $2. I highly doubt that. 
I keep adding at every dip and have great close to 90% positive comments on all SA article. 
Truely how can you say that trial are going amazingly well. Any feedback will be of great help and relief. 
Thanks

chirag7, 
Sorry.....the clinical trials participants tend to whisper within the community. No way will I make a public statement.
We're listening very close as a family within the Crohns community that our son was in before they changed his
diagnosis to UC. Everyone has to get their own info through public means or their own devices.


My mistake for stating that first sentence.

Good article, but I wanted to point out that Rosenwald is called a "promoter" based on SEC Rule 405 as he
purchased more than 10% of the offering. That piece of information alone is certainly a positive, even if there are a lot
of other accurate negatives in here.
