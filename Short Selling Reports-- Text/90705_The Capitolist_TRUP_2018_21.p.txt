Summary

TRUP


Trupanion is requesting a 20% rate hike in California for the end of 2019.


California represents roughly 23% of Trupanion's covered lives.


This brings the cumulative rate increase since 2015 to 150.3% for the state of
California policy holders.


Trupanion is already wildly overpriced compared to peers, I do not see how this
rate increase can help them arrest that trend.


I have offered extensive coverage of Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) regulatory and
financial woes (a synopsis can be found HERE), the fact that they offer the highest
priced insurance in the category (HERE), and the fact that the company is claiming that
they have an adverse selection problem so they have to offer up sub-par plan designs
with 50% co-insurance (HERE).

TRUP Requests a 20% Rate Increase for CA in 2020


There Are a Few Things Outrageous About This Request


All the while I have maintained that the company has some residual value; around $8 or
so based on the sale prices of comparable companies (HERE).


However - new rate requests in California call into question the viability of the business.
It appears that a rate spiral has taken hold of the company


Amazingly this comes just one year after TRUP requested a 17% rate increase in the
state.

The cumulative effect of these price increases has already priced TRUP's offering out of
the market (in terms of being competitive as a monthly premium), but the raw numbers
are a sight to be seen.

150% increase in cost is not going to keep healthy pets on your books, they are going to
rotate off and leave you with only the very sick pets.

Conclusion


A full 85.5% of covered lives are subject to a price increase between 10% and 30%
according to TRUP's own regulatory document.


Figure 4: Loss Ratios Are Rising Despite Rapid Increases in Rates


Source: Trupanion's Request to the California State Insurance Commissioner


This chart shows a simple calculation. Trupanion is required to file its "Paid Loss
Development" and "Premiums Earned" with the State of California on a quarterly basis.
By simply dividing the "Paid Loss Development" (claims pay outs) by the "Premiums
Earned" we generate the "Loss Ratio" (or the amount of premiums that go out the back
door to claims.)


What we see here is particularly concerning for TRUP, on a quarterly basis these rapid
price hikes have not translated into increased profits - but instead look like a hamster
wheel requiring 20% hikes just to keep the losses relatively stable in the very short term.
The 12 month line shows the cumulative effect on the business in CA, and the loss
ratios are climbing to all time highs.


TRUP isn't raising rates to make money for investors - it's doing it because the losses
are climbing faster then premiums.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.

There isn't much to say. It is true that competitive comparable companies have been
sold at valuations, which on a per/policy basis, suggest a price near $8/share. But there
is no evidence that those companies' books of policies were under this level of duress.
My conclusion after reading these documents is that $8/share is now the upper bound of
what the company is worth, and that the insurance book itself is likely worthless.
Perhaps the CRM is worth a small amount of money so I have put a $1 target on the
company - no matter where you fall on the continuum between $1 and $8 the downside
is significant.


The deterioration of the financials and total lack of operating leverage point to a problem
under the hood. The claim of adverse selection in Florida has to make one concerned
about the health of the insurance book, the rate increases in California are downright
uneconomical.


At this point I see no way to justify owning the company - the upside is completely
ethereal - the downside is essentially total loss.
