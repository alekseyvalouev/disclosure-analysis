Summary


CEO	Dror	Svorai	previously	committed	3	criminal	offenses,	has	12	federal	tax	liens,
was	accused	of	breach	of	fiduciary	duty	and	securities	fraud.


Dror	Svorai	has	been	involved	in	a	number	of	failed	penny	stocks;	one	of	which	was
suspended	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission.


Clear	violation	of	Exchange	Act	Section	10A(a)	in	tandem	with	the	resignation	of	the
company's	accountant.


(Editors'	Note:	This	article	is	an	updated	version	of	the	author's	previous	article	published
on	the	morning	of	March	27,	2014.	This	version	addresses	information	from	a	company
press	release	issued	after	publication	of	the	initial	version.)


On	Jan.	22,	2014,	AvWorks	Aviation	Corp.	(SPLI)	entered	into	a	merger	agreement	with
Vapor	Group,	Incorporated.	After	the	consummation	of	the	merger,	the	public	entity
retained	ownership	of	all	intellectual	property,	licensing	and	marketing	and	other	assets	of
Vapor	Group,	including	equipment,	product	designs,	logos,	trademarks,	copyrights	and
websites.	Simultaneously	with	the	closing,	the	Company	agreed	to	change	its	name	to
Vapor	Group,	Inc.	from	AvWorks	Aviation	Corp.


To	date,	only	a	limited	amount	of	post-merger	financial	information	has	been	made
available	to	the	public	since	it	was	finalized	less	than	90	days	ago	so	it	is	not	possible	to
accurately	analyze	important	factors	such	as:


1.	Specific	month-over-month	revenue	growth;
2.	Gross	margins	on	all	products	sold;
3.	Marketing	and	advertising	expenditures;
4.	Total	assets,	total	liabilities	and	the	company's	ability	to	pay	short-term	obligations;


According	to	a	press	release	dated	Mar.	27,	2014,	final	audited	financial	statements	for
2013	will	be	released	in	the	coming	weeks.	For	now,	we	know	that	audited	gross	revenues
exceeded	$1,975,000	and	that	Vapor	Group	was	profitable	in	its	first	year	of	operations.

According	to	the	company's	website,	electronic	cigarettes	are	not	just	a	healthier
alternative	to	smoking	tobacco	cigarettes	and	cigars	but	also	are	a	better	financial
alternative	as	well.	Propylene	glycol,	one	of	four	ingredients	found	in	e-cigarettes,	is
"generally	recognized	as	safe"	by	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA),	according	to	a
public	health	statement	summarizing	the	toxicological	profile	for	propylene	glycol.


The	market	for	e-cigarettes	continues	to	grow	rapidly.	Sales	more	than	doubled	to	$1.7
billion	in	2013	compared	to	the	year	prior	according	to	Bonnie	Herzog,	an	industry	analyst
for	Wells	Fargo	Securities.	We	remain	skeptical	about	the	company's	ongoing	ability	to
thrive	in	this	increasingly	competitive	marketplace	with	billion	dollar	multi-national
corporations,	but	Vapor	Group	appears	to	have	forward-looking	intentions.	On	March	12,
2014,	the	company	announced	development	of	"The	Vapor	Box	TBH,"	which	vaporizes
dry	herbs	by	gently	heating	them	at	a	controlled	temperature	inside	a	heating	chamber.
One	would	assume	the	demand	will	increase	for	products	like	the	Vapor	Box	TBH	as	a
result	of	recent	legislative	changes	to	marijuana	use.	But	regardless	of	the	external
market,	the	company	will	fail	if	its	management	team	does	not	execute	the	business	plan.

Dror	Svorai,	SPLI's	president	and	chief	executive	officer,	founded	the	Vapor	Group,	Inc.	in
2012,	along	with	its	subsidiaries	Total	Vapor	Inc.,	Vapor	123	Inc.	and	Vapor	Products	Inc.
While	his	bio	suggests	Svorai's	past	experience	includes	serving	in	executive	positions,	it
fails	to	mention	anything	about	Case	No.	13-20190-CIV-GRAHAM/GOODMAN,	filed	in
U.S.	District	Court's	Southern	District	of	Florida.	In	that	case,	Svorai	was	accused	of
breach	of	fiduciary	duty	and	securities	fraud:


Defendant	Dror	Svorai	and	Defendant	Jorge	Schcolnik	(collectively,	"Board
Defendants")	had	a	fiduciary	duty	to	shareholders	which	the	defendants	breached
through	their	intentional	misconduct.
Defendant	Dror	Svorai	also	tried	to	create	an	untrue	employment	agreement	for	the
former	CEO,	Defendant	Haim	Mayan.


Dror	Svorai's	bio	published	in	an	8-K	dated	Jan.	22,	2014	also	fails	to	disclose	the	specific
executive	positions	he	previously	held.	Compare	Svorai's	bio	dated	Nov.	25,	2010	(top)	to
his	more	recent	one	dated	Jan.	22,	2014	(bottom):


Specifically,	Svorai	failed	to	mention	that	he	was	a	former	president	and	chief	executive
officer	of	Green	LED	Technologies,	Inc.,	which	later	was	acquired	by	Hi	Score	Corp.
(OTC:HSCO).	We	are	convinced	that	Svorai	deliberately	omitted	his	involvement	with	Hi
Score	Corp.	because	HSCO	was	suspended	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission
on	Jan.	27,	2014	due	to	questions	"regarding	the	accuracy	of	publicly	available
information	about	the	company's	assets,	acquisitions,	business	activities,	control	persons,
securities	offerings,	and	financing	arrangements."


Svorai	also	has	acted	as	the	sole	officer	and	director	of	Inelco	Corp.	(OTC:INLC)	since
2010,	alongside	barred	attorney	Diane	D.	Dalmy,	who	had	charges	brought	against	her	in
2013	relating	to	a	pump-and-dump	scheme.	During	Svorai's	tenure	with	the	company,
Inelco's	shares	plunged	by	more	than	99	percent.

Vapor	Group's	President	has	also	committed	three	criminal	offenses	and	has	twelve
federal	tax	liens.


False	Representation	and	Violation	of	Section	10A(a)	of	the	Exchange	Act


On	Nov.	27,	2013,	Harris	F.	Rattray,	CPA	resigned	as	the	independent	registered	public
accounting	firm	for	SPLI.	According	to	a	Public	Company	Accounting	Oversight	Board
(PCOAB)	order	instituting	disciplinary	proceedingsin	the	matter	of	Harris	F.	Rattray,	dated
Nov.	21,	2013,	Rattray	was	barred	from	being	an	associated	person	of	a	registered	public
accounting	firm,	and	his	license	was	revoked.	Specifically,	Rattray	violated	Section	10(b),
Rule	10b-5	and	Section	10A(a)	of	the	Exchange	Act.	These	proceedings	were	in
connection	with	the	auditing	of	financial	statements	of	four	public	companies:	Patient
Portal	Technologies	Inc.	(OTCPK:PPRG),	AvWorks	Aviation	Corp,	Caribbean	Pacific
Marketing	Inc.	and	Urban	Ag	Corp.	(OTC:AQUM).


AvWorks	and	the	three	other	respondents	misrepresented	several	audited	financial
statements	as	having	been	conducted	in	accordance	with	PCOAB	standards.	In	doing	so,
all	four	public	companies	violated	Exchange	Act	Section	10A(a),	failing	to	include
procedures	designed	to	provide	reasonable	assurance	that	any	illegal	acts	having	a	direct
and	material	effect	on	the	determination	of	financial-statement	amounts	would	be
detected.


NVLX	Lost	50	Percent	after	Our	Expose,	and	We	Believe	SPLI	May	Be	Next


Unfortunately	for	current	shareholders,	we	believe	the	recent	catalyst	for	the	surging	SPLI
share	price	is	marijuana	mania.	We	featured	Nuvilex,	Inc.	(NVLX)	in	a	previous	expose
and	warned	investors	of	the	dangers	of	holding	a	stock	in	the	midst	of	a	bubble.	Sure
enough,	within	48	hours	of	our	expose,	NVLX	shares	lost	nearly	50	percent.	It	is	our
opinion	that	SPLI	soon	will	have	a	similar	pullback.	Additional	marijuana	stocks	that
inflated	into	some	of	the	most	overvalued	stocks	on	Wall	Street	include	mCig,	Inc.
(OTCPK:MCIG),	Signature	Exploration	And	Production	Corp.	(SXLP)	and	Growlife,	Inc.
(OTCQB:PHOT).


There	are	two	reasons	why	we	are	so	confident	that	SPLI	and	other	marijuana-related
penny	stocks	will	soon	implode.	Aside	from	the	hyper	inflated	valuations	that	remind	us	of
Internet	stocks	in	2000,	these	marijuana-related	stocks	are	not	thriving	businesses	and
probably	never	will	be.	Almost	all	penny	stocks	that	are	perceived	to	be	within	the
marijuana	sector	are	bleeding	cash	and	have	very	few	assets.	In	fact,	many	have	zero
sales	and	enormous	accumulated	deficits.	Vapor	Group	is	one	of	the	few	profitable
companies	in	the	sector	but	there	are	few	differences	between	their	products	and	the

and	very	few	barriers	to	entry,	it	will	be	incredibly	difficult	for	an	e-Cigarette	company	such

The	biggest	"danger(s)	of	holding	a	stock	in	the	midst	of	a	bubble,"	i.e.,	when	the	stock	has	rallied,	is	that
opportunistic	short	sellers	such	as	yourself	bash	in	order	to	tank	the	price.	A	lot	of	your	argument	is	opinion,	anyway.
You	don't	care	about	saving	people	from	what	you	consider	bad	investments,	you	care	about	making	money	when
they	sell	due	to	your	claims	of	"fraud."

Google's	a	bubble.	Great	company,	but	are	you	really	going	to	tell	me	its	worth	more	than	Wal-Mart.	OTC	MJ
stocks	have	some	that	are	overvalued	for	sure,	but	MJ	is	the	#1	cash	crop	in	the	world.	Price	ironically	has
gone	up	because	of	shortages	in	Colorado.	And	some	OTC	MJ	stocks	are	undervalued.	AVTC	has	a	better
price	to	book	value	than	Wal-Mart	as	well	as	most	DOW	stocks.	Research	it.
