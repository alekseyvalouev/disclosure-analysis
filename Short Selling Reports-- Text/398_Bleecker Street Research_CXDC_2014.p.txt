China XD Plastics: When The Numbers Don't Add Up, There's Over
80% Downside

Summary


CXDC reports substantially margins higher than its main competitor, yet spends
much less on R&D.


China XD Plastics Company (NASDAQ:CXDC)


China XD Plastics is a Chinese specialty chemical company which is engaged in all
phases of the production of plastics, which are mainly used for automotive uses, and sells
to mainly the Chinese end-market.


CXDC entered the US public markets through a reverse merger, a method that many
fraudulent companies have previously used. Below is a summary of what we have found
researching CXDC.


Reported profit margins 200% higher than its larger and better funded competitor
Kingfa.


CXDC's Gross Margins Are Substantially Higher Than Its Much Larger Competitor


CXDC has incredible gross margins, if you believe them. CXDC's main publicly traded
competitor is Kingfa, which trades on the Shanghai Exchange. Kingfa is mentioned in
CXDC's 10-K as well, the 10-K reads:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 2/61


Currently, Xinda Group's primary Chinese competitor in the automobile industry is
Guangzhou Kingfa Science & Technology Co., Ltd. ("Guangzhou Kingfa").
Guangzhou Kingfa entered the automotive modified plastics market in 2006 and its
facilities had an annual manufacturing capacity of 375,000 MT for its modified
plastics products used in the automobile industry at the end of 2012, according to
the research report by Frost and Sullivan. Guangzhou Kingfa has the largest
capacity expansion plans and was expected to expand to 1.06 million MT by
2015 according to Frost and Sullivan's report, but its utilization rate of
production capacity is expected to be lower than that of China XD based on
Frost & Sullivan's report. Guangzhou Kingfa has much larger financial
resources than Xinda Group. However, we believe that it currently holds fewer
number of product certifications for automotive modified plastic to the automobile
industry compared to Xinda Group. Another top domestic manufacturer of modified
plastic is Shanghai Pret Composites Co., Ltd. ("Shanghai Pret"), which focuses on
the production of automotive plastics. It had an annual capacity and sales volume of
120,000 MT and 73,100 MT in 2013, respectively, according to a report by Frost and
Sullivan.


According to that statement, it would make sense that CXDC, a much smaller company
with less resources, would have lower gross margins, after all there is an economy of
scale aspect to manufacturing plastics. CXDC, however, does not only have better gross
margins, but substantially better gross margins.


How much higher? Well from 2009 to 2013, CXDC reported gross margins that were
substantially higher than its main, better funded competitor.


And Kingfa is a much larger company, that generates billions of dollars in revenue.
Consider this, in 2013 CXDC generated 45% less revenues than Kingfa but reported net
income that was 184% higher than Kingfa. Since 2011 Kingfa has seen its net income
decline by 21% while revenues have grown 24%. On the other hand, CXDC has seen net
income grow by 133% and revenues grow by 175%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 3/61


One could argue, hypothetically, that CXDC has some sort of proprietary method of
manufacturing their product that allows it to report such high margins. CXDC's R&D
spending, however, has been relatively miniscule compared to Kingfa. According to this,
Kingfa invests 2-5% of their annual sales in R&D.


Source: Kingfa IR Presentation


Bear in mind that Kingfa has a much larger sales number as well, so its R&D expenses
will be substantially higher than CXDC's.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 4/61


So it is clear that CXDC is not outspending Kingfa on R&D to generate its higher margins.
Being conservative and using the low-end of Kingfa's R&D guidance range of 2% would
suggest that Kingfa is substantially outspending CXDC on R&D, yet somehow CXDC
manages to report higher margins?


All charts are my analysis from publicly available information.


A Curious Move By CXDC


CXDC announced the closing of its senior notes offering in February of this year.


China XD Plastics Company Ltd: Says that its wholly owned subsidiary, Favor Sea
Limited (the Issuer), closed its international offering of guaranteed senior notes. The
offering consists of $150 mln aggregate principal amount of 11.75 pct guaranteed
senior notes due 2019.Issuer intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for
repayment of indebtedness incurred by its PRC subsidiaries, for capital expenditure
on a production base in Sichuan and for general corporate purposes. The Notes are
guaranteed on a senior basis by the company and Xinda Holding (NYSE:HK)
company Limited, a subsidiary wholly owned by the Issuer and secured by a pledge
of the shares of the Issuer held by the company and a pledge of the shares of the
Subsidiary Guarantor held by the Issuer.


The notes carried a surprisingly high interest rate of 11.75%. More surprising was that they
were issued internationally. If the company, as it claims, is truly one of the leading
specialty chemical companies then why can it not issue debt in the country in which it
operates and why is it paying such a high interest rate when interest rates all around the
world are at historic lows.


Increasing DSO Is A Red Flag

DSO tells you how many days it takes a company to collect revenue after a sale.
Look out for increasing DSO as it means the company is unable to collect payments
and/or providing lenient terms to buyers. To put it simply, the company is disguising
weak sales.


Here is a chart of CXDC's DSO.

Passing The Smell Test? Don't Think So


In an article by Bill Bishop he gives us six things that are warning signs that a Chinese
stock may be a fraud. Let's apply this test to CXDC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 6/61


Our friends over at iChinastock (disclosure: I am an advisor to their parent company
Snowball Finance) have created a list of 5 Warning Signs That A Chinese Stock May
Be a Fraud:


1. Company went public through an OTCBB Transfer or other ways of back-door
listing;


2. Company name starts with "China" [unless they are state-owned they cannot
register a company in China starting the word "China"];


3. The products are sold in China, but there is minimal Chinese-language
information about those products;


4. The business defies common sense;


5. The underwriter, audit firm and accounting firm are second tier and/or have a track
record of missing frauds (like Deloitte China).


To this list I would add a sixth warning sign:


6. The CFO does not live in the same city as corporate HQ and is not a regular
presence there.


So how does CXDC stack up? Turns out not so well.


1. CXDC Fails. CXDC went public through a reverse merger.


2. CXDC Fails. "China XD Plastics" as you can see the name starts with China.


3. CXDC Fails. Searching Google reveals no Chinese links on the first page.

And perhaps more interestingly, CXDC does not have a Chinese-language website,
although it does have what appears to be a link to Chinese-language website the link does
not work and you stay on the English-language website. Compare this to Kingfa's
homepage.


Source: Kingfa website


Kingfa's website has an English version, but the main website is in Chinese and the
Chinese-language website is more advanced. How does CXDC have margins that are so
much higher than Kingfa's if it doesn't even have a website in the language of the

company that it does its main business in? Something doesn't add up.


4. CXDC Fails. CXDC not only defies common sense, it defies any rational explanation of
how business is done.


5. CXDC passes. Sort of. KPMG is CXDC's auditor. I believe they pass on this one but it
is interesting to note the relatively high turnover of auditors.


Source: TradingChina


Also worthy of note is that CXDC's audit fees were remarkably low until KPMG began
doing the audit.


Source: My analysis


6. CXDC Fails. CXDC's CFO is based in New York City, at least according to his phone
number.

So CXDC has failed 5 out of the 6 questions of the Chinese Fraud smell test. Not great.


Conclusion


CXDC does not pass the smell test. It doesn't make sense. If you are concerned about
shorting the stock, CXDC has a fairly liquid options market. I think the 7.5 strikes are
attractively priced and the risk/reward seems good, which month you chose is up to how
aggressive one wants to be. I think shorting the common stock has an excellent
risk/reward as well.


There are numerous and substantial red flags at CXDC, and my price target of $1.83
and 81% might eventually prove conservative.


Note: These are my opinions based on due diligence. It is possible I have missed
something or made an error. If there is any error I will correct it immediately. My analysis is
based on the facts that are publicly available.


Update: On July 31st I received a message from Shearman & Sterling LLP asking that I
correct certain aspects of this article which they deemed "false and unfair." They believed
that my article falsely accused Mr. Zhang, the CFO of being accused of fraud at previous
positions. While I believe that my writing made it clear that Mr. Zhang was only employed
by companies that were then later accused of fraud, I have deleted that part of the article.
Their letter goes on to say that what I wrote regarding contacting the CFO was untrue, and
that I did not contact him. What I know happened was that I called the number provided on
the CXDC website for the CFO, I asked if I was speaking to the CFO and the person on
the other end of the line said he was the CFO. Whether that was a misunderstanding on
the other end of the line I am not sure. I have redacted this part of the article as well.


Disclosure: The author is short CXDC. The author wrote this article themselves, and it
expresses their own opinions. The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than
from Seeking Alpha). The author has no business relationship with any company whose
stock is mentioned in this article.

How can you justify an article that contains errors? 
How can you call yourself an adviser producing reports that you yourself admit contain errors?  
If this is a scam, it is worth zero. 
If it is not a scam, you are worth less than Maddoff.


How can SA allow someone to publish an article with so many shortcomings? 
I am sure you are enjoying your short positions and since this is just a platform for people like you and the
SEC is ever absent, I assume you will go free, as normal.

Disproving negatives and rumors is a classic short and distort challenge to longs and it is quite effective. Are
you taking lessons from Carson Block? He is the master of short and distort and has made millions without
any SEC sanctions to this point although his poppa got in trouble. I'm sure he has very good attorneys.

Bleecker: The article from 2011 did not include the SAIC filing of at least one of China XD's subsidiaries (the
"research institute," if I am not mistaken), where supposedly substantial revenues and profits were
concentrated. I have attempted to obtain those filings, from the company and elsewhere, but have not been
successful. Since the company's Chairman is a well-connected and powerful individual, I would not be
surprised that by now the SAIC filings have been "corrected" to match the SEC filings.

JoeDiaz1970
I'd have to do a reconciliation between the two... but I can tell you from reconciling between statutory, gaap
and other types of reporting, you can legitimately have differences... if so... i'm sure CXDC's external auditor,
KPMG, would have reviewed it. To me, this concern is a non-issue.


10 Jul 2014, 01:56 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
JoeDiaz1970: China GAAP is very similar to IFRS which is very similar to US GAAP, especially on revenue
level for a commodity producing company like China XD. KPMG, as already pointed out, has been suspended
by the administrative judge from practicing before the SEC for six months (currently on appeal), for willfully
violating Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.


10 Jul 2014, 02:50 PM


JoeDiaz1970
Mr. Roe, KPMG, the firm, is definitely not suspended from anything... in fact... they're one of the Big Four
auditors... again... if your case is this week on audit firms... i can't imagine what this says about the rest of
your case.

"KPMG, China XD's auditor, has definitely been suspended, basically for facilitating fraud, but is now

Not true. All of the Big 4 and BDO have been suspended and are appealing because they have refused to
turn over certain audits fear of violating Chinese secrecy laws (despite having been ordered to by US
regulatory bodies). Jumping to fraud seems like quite the stretch.


10 Jul 2014, 08:19 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
new slang: True. You just confirmed that KPMG has been suspended. In other words, what I said is true.


KPMG knew the Chinese and US laws very well, so when it signed up China XD as a client, it knew perfectly
well that it will have to violate either Chinese or US laws eventually. In other words, KPMG is facilitating fraud
by failing to provide the documentation requested by the US regulators, while hiding behind an "ignorance"
excuse.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 16/61


I appreciate your reviewing the main concerns that have been raised about CXDC in the past -- it's always good to
keep in mind the various risks assoc'd with these Chinese micros and take them into account in our own risk
assessment. However, I think the piece would have been more compelling if you found something new, or actually
spoke with the CFO. If there's a 'smoking gun' you didn't reveal it in this article.

Author’s reply »  Thank you. I agree it would have been more compelling, yet the CFO did not call me back
and I was unable to reach him after that.

Perhaps looking at any one point isn't a smoking gun, but I think when you add up everything, it's a pretty
compelling case the author has made. I'm seeing a lot of similarities in other stocks that have turned out to be
fraudulent and that's enough for me not to touch this stock and even short it.

why should he call you back. What are you ? A nothing. I would say it is a sell signal if he is talking to you.

I understand what you're saying, however the same facts were in place six months ago when the stock was at
a similar level... it proceeded to nearly triple... timing's everything and some people have it and some don't.
I'm not in the stock at the moment, but continue to follow it with interest -- the time to short it would have been
when it was on a momentum tear a few weeks ago--if I had shorted it at that point, I'd probably be covering
today and thinking about going long...

To you and RxR.. found this interesting. From a Jefferson Research report dated 7/1/14, inclusive of the most
recent quarter (Mar14).


stat // CXDC // SRI // CAAS //  
gross 
margin // 23% // 26% // 21.9% // 
EBIT% // 15% // 3.2% // 7.8% // 
Net 
margin // 9.8% // 0.6% // 5.9% //


(taken from peer operating comparison)


Their bottom line doesn't make much sense. The rest of the sample isn't close either, assuming higher
operating costs in US play a role. But the degree of difference on the net just seems contrived.

Not much need for Research and Development in the Automotive Plastic Industry. One well trained Polymer
Engineer/Chemist with a couple of good text books and a bit of experience in the Automotive Industry from the United
States provides everything needed. R&D is already paid for by US ingenuity over the last 60 years.


10 Jul 2014, 10:07 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
Sesame: If that's the case, why are China XD's gross margins not close to zero? I mean, if all you need for
successful operation is an Engineer and off-the-shelf German equipment, why isn't everybody in China doing
it and therefore depressing local industry gross margins to near zero?


For standard automotive modified plastics, it is true. But to create a plastic compound that is lighter, cheaper,
and better performing than metal, one needs quite a bit of R&D. If you look at China XD's "offerings," you will
find that their products are commodity, and gross margins should be near zero, if they were a real company,
that is.


10 Jul 2014, 10:28 AM

Interesting reply to my statement that the basics science of R&D Polymer (and Composites) in the Automotive

people to monitor the production and to apply the knowledge. That is why you don't have a gross margin
anywhere near zero. The above article was commenting about why R&D was so comparatively low so I
provide a reasonable explanation for that situation. Not sure where you got the bit about off-the-shelf German
equipment as I was talking about American Technology. I have heard about China representatives buying
whole factories in the US then documented how they work followed by packing up the entire factory's
hardware and shipping it back to China.


10 Jul 2014, 11:36 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
Sesame: China XD does not use American technology - it uses German-designed but Chinese-made
extruders (and processes). I would agree with you that the basic science of R&D Polymer (and Composites)
in the Automotive Industry is "established" only when I see all the metal parts in a car replaced by cheaper,
lighter, and stronger non-metal compounds, until then, I would only agree that all China XD's modified plastics
offerings are currently commodities and available from tens, if not hundreds, of local suppliers (which would
explain why the only patent that China XD has was actually purchased, not internally developed).


There are no barriers to entry in the Chinese modified plastics industry - princelings are all over the place for
hire, and money from gullible and greedy investors are plentiful.


10 Jul 2014, 11:56 AM


Sesame Stock Picker, Contributor
Roe, you are certainly entitled to your opinion. Automotive material usage is a trade off of cost, properties and
esthetics. I do not believe that plastics/polymers will every replace 100% of metals so by your definition they
can never be 'established' as to having BASIC Research and Development being real and existing. 
I am interested in your information about China XD use of German designed type extruders? I would like to
know more about it and would appreciate it if you would provide more details. You do seem to have
researched all of this quite a bit while I only know some things about US composite and polymers from
working in the DOD industry for a lot of years.

There is some risk of fraud; this article is based on older data and author did not follow up on the call to the CFO. I
find it odd the author only asked him one question about the interest on the loan and then asked no further questions
when the CFO was contacted on the phone. I will consider this a buying opportunity. I admit there is risk of fraudulent
accounts, the signing of large contracts on Christmas day every year could explain a lot of the financial irregularities.

What do you think about Morgan Stanley Private Equity investing $100mm into this company? The original deal had a
2014 redemption option, but they waived it last year.


What do you think about the KPMG audit?


What do you think about the S&P bond rating?


What do you think about the Frost & Sullivan industry analysis?


If you are right, then all of those investors, auditors, and analysts are wrong. Maybe they didn't to check the
company's website...


10 Jul 2014, 10:18 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
John: These are all valid points, and they will have to be addressed in detail, eventually. Let's just say this:


- China XD's investor presentations are prepared by Morgan Stanley, as evidenced by the author metadata
and disclaimers in the files 
- KPMG was hired at the same time Morgan Stanley became involved. Morgan Stanley used the same
auditor for Yongye, a supposedly highly-profitable and growing company that was taken private with Chinese
government money for less than the cash (and cash equivalents) on its books. In other words, there are
indications that Morgan Stanley Private Equity could be involved in a money-laundering operation. 
- To my knowledge, the bond rating agencies did not perform any actual on-the-ground due diligence and
instead relied on management representations. 
- Frost & Sullivan industry analysis, at least the one supposedly dated April 24, 2013 ("Project Snow"), is
flawed - again, the analysis contains no on-the-ground due diligence, and does not explain why the
company's customers appear related parties (share the same phone numbers, etc.), etc.

10 Jul 2014, 10:41 AM


John Sheehy, Contributor
It does not appear that you really addressed most of my questions.


The implausible suggestion that Morgan Stanley Private Equity is a money laundering operation does not
seem to explain why they would invest $100mm in this company and waive their redemption right. Is money
laundering so incredibly lucrative that it could justify the loss of a $100mm investment plus all the subsequent
legal and reputational risks? The fact that Morgan Stanley assisted in preparation of CXDC's IR Presentation
is not evidence of fraud.


What about the KPMG audit? CXDC is paying over $1mm/year in fees. Do you believe KPMG is also involved
in the money-laundering operation?


It's silly to fault the limits of the research conducted by S&P/KMPG/MSPEA/F&a... when the article is founded
on the author's own ignorance.


What is really the short thesis here? The regulatory filings from 2010? The business doesn't exist (no
evidence presented)? The margins are higher than the expected (based on his own erroneous calculation)?
Limited Google English language search results for the parent company name? Taylor Zhang didn't return his
phone call?


10 Jul 2014, 11:14 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
John: I see no loss for Morgan Stanley Private Equity - my understanding was that the waiver was done in
conjunction with the US$150 million offering that closed in February. As you can see in the case of Yongye,
Morgan Stanley Private Equity was effectively "bailed out" by China Development Bank. Whether such a
bailout will now come for China XD remains to be seen.


Why would Morgan Stanley "assist" in preparation of CXDC's IR materials to begin with? How much was
Morgan Stanley paid for that service, or, if it wasn't paid, what did Morgan Stanley obtain in return?


Yes, Since KPMG was hired at the same time that Morgan Stanley got involved in the company, and since
KPMG was the auditor of the other Morgan Stanley "investment," Yongye, I do believe that KPMG is also
involved in the money-laundering operation. Apparently, KPMG is currently in settlement negotiations with the
SEC, after the administrative judge found that they "willfully violated Sarbanes-Oxley Section 106 by refusing
to provide their audit work papers" and were "flouting of the Commission’s regulatory authority:”  
http://bit.ly/TV65i1


The author is not S&P/KMPG/MSPEA/F&a... Unlike those other parties, he did not have a duty (ethical, and
definitely not a legal one) to perform on-the-ground due diligence...


Yes, the short thesis is somewhat weak, if you ignore the facts that all the company's sales agreements are
signed on Christmas day, that there is evidence that the customers are undisclosed related parties, that the
disclosures in the bond offering documents do not match disclosures made elsewhere in the 10Qs and 10Ks,
things like that.

wonder CXDC has better gross margins. Also, notice how CXDC actually has lower gross margins than Shanghai
Pret for certain products (Mod PP, Alloy, & ABS). When can we expect your 'smoking gun' report on Pret due to its
above average gross margins?


The fact that you omit this information and instead rely primarily on 4-6 year-old data, rumor, and conjecture should
lead any competent reader to question both your objectivity and analytical ability.


But, congrats, it looks like you'll make lots of money on your CXDC short today.

DSO = Accounts Rec'ble/total credit sales * # of days


Clearly, a DSO of 75 million (as shown in the article) makes no sense.


You can get a historic picture of cash cycles ratios (Acct Rec'ble Days, Acct Payable Days, & Inventory
Turnover Days) of CXDC and key competitors (Kingfa & Shanghai Pret) on page 39 of CXDC's Feb 2014

I have a lot of problems with articles like this, potentially 10's of millions of dollars of shareholder value will evaporate
today and the author is short on the stock. Predicting how low a stock may go is irresponsible at best, esp when you
are short on the same stock.The author stinks worse than the article he wrote; articles like this one are not
independently fact checked before publication.


This type of legal insider trading needs to stop and the author held legally responsible for any errors. No doubt that
will not happen, in this case he does not have to pay for any mistakes. Shoddy misrepresented work and very
questionable conclusions. This is the number one worst article have read this year on Seeking Alpha. Those that seek
to destroy shareholder value need to be held accountable to a much higher standard.

The risk to reward liability ratio has to be treated differently in the case of a long prediction. Shorting any stock
has possible losses beyond the entire amount invested. There is also the consideration for the existing
shareholders as well as the company effected and all the employees that could potentially lose their jobs.


In a long prediction all shareholders, which includes employees holding shares, will potentially benefit. I do
agree with you that self-serving predictions are not OK if they are intended for the benefit of the promoter.
There is also the possibility of promoting a stock long to send it into overbought territory. Making predictions in
general is very tricky stuff.

Once again we see someone short a stock and use every means to bolster their financial position by using old data,
unreliable sources, and incorrect assumptions. This is becoming commonplace for SA now and the SEC just turns a

China XD claims to be the "#1 producer of auto modified plastics in China by capacity, and #2 by sales

10 Jul 2014, 12:08 PM


moogwai
why would CXDC pay such a high rate and not borrow from the banks?


well just a speculation, but to lock in money to build their new plant (yes they need cash to expand, but that
isnt a fraud) Perhaps the bank loans, like most, are secured by assets and the company would rather issue
unsecured debt, which by the way is now yielding 8.7%. Since it was a small first time issue, they probably
had to make a big coupon payment to attract investors.


The MS directors are young and dont seem to be on many other boards but I still dont think they willingly
invested in a fraud...

moogwai: It is not about the new plant. According to China XD's filing, the local government in the city where
the plant is supposed to be built was offering China XD a loan at 0%. China XD now says it does not need it.


If the debt is now yielding 8.7%, why isn't China XD buying it back with a loan taken at 0% from the local
government?

Bleaker Research - Numbers Don't Add Up - Credibility Risk 80%


MRONZ addresses your issue with margins. CXDC focuses on different products with higher margins. Also (from last
10Q) company claims to be shifting from lower margin unmodified plastics (PP) to higher margin modified plastics
(PA66).


I don't understand your issue with R&D. From your table listing KingFa and CXDC, the R&D appears to be the same
percentage in 2013 (2%). Again, from the last 10Q, most of this R&D is heavy on the D with most of the spending
resulting from material costs - presumably from making test parts for new customers.


The DSO chart makes no sense (80,000??). From the 10Q, the DSO has increased from 80 days to 91 days -
perhaps troubling. The company states that this is in-line with industry standards. As a note, their Q1 (2014) vs Q4

(2013) accounts receivable is actually lower.


The new Yankee bonds being sold internationally is a problem? If they are selling their securities in the US, shouldn't
these be sold internationally as well? Fitch rated them a BB- and states that these are in-line with other senior notes
previously issued. These are short term notes - hopefully they will be able to raise money at a lower rate in the future.


Finally, the fact that they are paying more in audit fees is a red flag how? First they are growing so have more to audit.
Second, KPMG probably costs more and hopefully provides greater assurance to investors.


If anything, I would be more worried about the Chinese auto market -- will it hold up and what are the risk factors to
consider. Europe not looking so hot but China is now the largest manufacturer of cars and the market is shifting to the
higher end autos that uses the new modified polymers.


10 Jul 2014, 11:58 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
thub: I was not aware the company produced any unmodified plastics. There is nothing in the last 10Q about
such a stunning change of production. PP does not mean "unmodified plastic," and PA66 does not mean
"modified plastics."


10 Jul 2014, 12:15 PM


thub
PP is polypropylene (unmodified) 
PA66 is a nylon modified polyamide if my memory serves.


As for the change - just going from the Q1 report.


10 Jul 2014, 12:25 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
thub: Your memory does not serve. According to its SEC filings, China XD has not produced any unmodified
polypropylene (at least in the past 4 years).


10 Jul 2014, 12:31 PM


thub
You are correct - they do list PP as a "modified polypropylene" - my mistake and an outdated memory. Part of
my assumption/memory was based on the higher sales price of the PA66 & PA6 (approx. 0.005/MT) vs PP
(approx. 0.002/MT).


The company does note that the proportion of revenues coming from the PP dropped significantly (-14%)
while that from the higher priced amides increased by 70-80% (with material increases in the volumes of PA
material shipped - about 40%). Do you think that this could account for the increased margins they saw in the
last quarter?


Thanks for the correction -- still think this is a real company though.

Mr. Roe, c'mon... you're cleverly trying to raise doubt & suspicion where none exist... as investors, we can't
prove CXDC's numbers. That's KPMG's job. It's a ridiculous challenge you're throwing down. KPMG would on
the line to reimburse investors if the audited financials ended up being erroneous. Short of KPMG
withdrawing their opinion on the previously issued financials; which they have done before with other
companies, I have to believe in the audited financials and not a bunch of innuendo.


10 Jul 2014, 03:29 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
thub: Of course it can be easily proven that Dow Chemical has sold TPO, as you can order it yourself from
your local distributor. Where can you buy China XD's products? In fact, where can you find what products
exactly are made and sold by China XD?


Yes, on the modified plastics portal by Alibaba ( http://www.1688.com ) you can find actual price quotes about
actual products from actual companies - the products of all the major multinationals, as well as the local
competitors, are represented. But China XD's products are nowhere to be found - at least I can't find them.
So, if you get a chance, can you provide a link on Alibaba or elsewhere about an actual product made by
China XD (and sold by its customers, that is, distributors, I suppose) and its price?

KPMG's job is not to prove CXDC's numbers. KPMG's job, theoretically, is to attest to the financials being

Again, if you believe the financials at all, I simply calculated their average price for PP, PA66, etc from the
tables on p17 of the last 10Q. This will give you the average selling price -- and from previous experience,
these numbers seemed ok. Finally, I don't see how finding a selling price for 100kg of resin is going to prove
that CXDC sells resin by the carload - if my hoax is so elaborate, I could easily sell (resell) material in small
quantities on Alibaba (the website you pointed to above). Am I missing something here?


The company states that 91% of their material is sold through six different major distributors so I am
impressed that Goeff was able to find some of their material -- that must be the other 9% sold elsewhere.
Again, this doesn't seem terribly surprising. Companies dealing in plastics in the US don't buy 25kg bags of
material; they buy carloads (at these unit prices, accounting would make the resin cost too high otherwise).
Smaller lot sizes are done through the distributors. I am not sure how this business is done in China, but I can
only surmise that most B2B is done by phone, fax, and reps. Consequently, no pricing directly from the
company (getting resin pricing from Dow or Exxon websites is similarly difficult). Doesn't mean they don't sell
it.


It would be nice if they listed who their actual distributors were but confidentiality agreements aren't
surprising. Further, it seems that this would be an elaborate hoax to list over 900 employees, production sites,
and most importantly to me, a consistent story of steady growth in distributors, manufacturing, product
certifications and location. The 100M investment by Morgan Stanley a few years ago also provides some
indication that they are a real company (to me). Finally, the Chinese resin production industry is very fractured
and shifts to local sourcing of materials should provide a very good opportunity for companies like CXDC.


Perhaps I have missed the smoking gun you seem to have found but for now we will have to agree to
disagree. I'd wish you good luck but that would be bad for me ;-)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 38/61


on Alibaba's automotive modified plastic portal, where there are real quotes for real products in real
quantities. You can see the products of Kingfa, for example, and they are not sold in small quantities.


Goeff has not been been able to find any of China XD material - he found an outdated page, that is not
working - the China XD representative cannot be contacted, the product descriptions are stale, products (like
POM) are missing, etc. By the way, all of China XD's sales are done to distributors, who are actually the only
China XD customers, according to China XD's filings.


The company has listed the (Chinese) names of ALL of its distributors in an Exhibit attached in the last 10K.
The sales contracts with all of these distributors were signed on Christmas day. Most of these "distributors"
appear to be no-name shell companies that have no sales.


My main point was that the website listed on China XD's product packaging (the standard 25 kg bag, of which
40 go into the standard 1 ton pallette) is apparently a casino portal, indicating that nobody is actually looking
at China XD's product, or someone would have noticed by now.

Couldn't resist asking for clarification.


I couldn't find a list of distributors in the 2013 10k. Appendix 21.1 does list its subsidiaries and I can well
imagine that they might have a common date associated with their name. Can you point me to where the 10k
lists these distributors and these dates? Thanks

You have to be quite naive not to realize CXDC was stinky from the beginning. The moment they did their rise... and
the moment they fell into this current stinkhole.


Numbers don't add up for this company. There is (in my opinion) obvious foul play at work but who cares? Any value
investor having enough knowledge about this market (the one from CXDC) won't touch it and the one who likes a
risky touch already plaid with it. Only the fools who kept it when it rallied upwards are now getting screwed.


Another lesson learned....

Before anyone panic sells, remember one thing. CXDC's auditor is KPMG. KPMG; a top tier Accounting firm, has
provided CXDC with a clean audit opinion, e.g., "In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of China XD Plastics Company Limited and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles." If the choice is believing bloggers on
the internet or KPMG, I have to go with KPMG.

"ShengdaTech, a KPMG-audited chemicals maker in which Goldman Sachs took a 7.6 percent stake, saw
auditor KPMG resign in April, citing "serious discrepancies" in its bank statements and representations of
customers."


"One of the companies, China Integrated Energy, has lost 90 per cent of its market value this year after it was
accused of fraud by short sellers and its auditor KPMG resigned. "


10 Jul 2014, 02:08 PM


Harm Elderman, Contributor
Since when is KPMG a top tier accounting firm? KPMG it's track record is poor to say the least. Especially the
last few years they have made mistakes after mistake, fraud after fraud.


Example? Look at their Dutch debacle where partners withheld money etc.


That their auditor is KPMG.. that's only more confirmation that this entire ordeal smells like horse dung.


10 Jul 2014, 02:20 PM


JoeDiaz1970
Jason, you're making my point. KPMG withdrew from the ShengdaTech engagement due to accusations of
fraud allegedly made by the Company's Management. But in the case of CXDC, there are no no serious
allegations of fraud and KPMG has not withdrawn from the engagement. Which should prove to everyone that
CXDC's numbers and representations are legite.

I'm not be so sure about that. The implication of fraud in your article is intentionally plain enough that the

Richard / mronz, do you guys find agreement relative to kingfa's 30% trading activities, generating 3% gross margins?


Seems like an important openpoint, not?


10 Jul 2014, 06:13 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
googlefan: I have been unable to find any public filing (or statement) by Kingfa about the alleged 30% trading
activities generating 3% gross margins. mronz has also been unable to provide a link to such a filing. It is
more likely than not that China XD's management lied about Kingfa in its presentation - it is not the first time.
For example, China XD management claimed in a 10K ( http://1.usa.gov/1jhWo9n , page 10) that Kingfa
entered the automotive modified plastics market in 2006, which is patently untrue, as public documents show
that Kingfa has been selling automotive modified plastics at least since early 2004, when it had over 60 actual
certified products with Ford, GM, Nissan, and Toyota. At the time, China XD was a dilapidated "factory"
making nylon.


10 Jul 2014, 07:16 PM


mronz
I apologize for the delay. I reviewed Kingfa's 2013 annual report which can be found on their website (again,
only in Chinese): http://bit.ly/1rYc1W4


On page 14, Kingfa provides a product-by-product breakdown of revenue and relevant gross margins for
each product.


The figures correspond with the figures CXDC published in its presentation. I've translated a breakdown
below (for full year 2013):


Product / % of 2013 sales / gross margin 
-Plastic alloy / 5% / 26.2% 
-Other products / 13% / 20.2% 
-Reinforced resin / 15% / 17.9% 
-Flame retardant resin / 22% / 16.6% 
-Toughened resin / 22% / 17.1% 
-Materials trading / 24% / 3.7%


Here is a guide to the Chinese annual report to check my figures. At the bottom of page 14, Kingfa provides a
table with the following produc-by-product data: sales (column 2), COGS (column 3), gross margin (column
3).


I'm hoping Richard just neglected to read the document & isn't intentionally misleading readers...

Richard X Roe, Contributor
mronz: I can now confirm your numbers. The annual report you cited was prepared on April 25, that is, more
than a month after China XD's presentation, which was dated March 7, 2014, so you are cheating a bit, but
that's ok.


Excluding the "materials trading," Kingfa's gross margin for 2013 was 18%. China XD's gross margin was
21%. So, the author's argument is a bit weakened, but China XD's reported gross margin is still higher by 3%,
which doesn't really make sense as Kingfa is an established player with internationally recognized brand,
while China XD (that is, Xinda) is apparently known only to the local party bosses and its customers, all of
whom get their contracts signed on Christmas day. The claim that China XD's margins are somehow higher
because China XD has more certifications makes no sense, as it is Kingfa that has had more "certifications"
and more auto parts customers, and Kingfa can always allocate ALL of its capacity towards automotive, if
automotive were indeed more profitable.

This was pointed out before but it won't hurt to say it again. Why it is such a big deal if the CFO did not answer your
question and did not call you back?


How can this be one of your major points to support that CXDC is fooling its investors?


Don't take offense but maybe he had better things to do. Maybe he forgot to call you back. Whatever it is.


We saw a similar example a short time ago with CBI. Short seller publishes report about the supposedly fake
accounting data provided by the firm, stock drops significantly, some people make a ton of money.


Are some of your points viable? Absolutely. But overall this just smells like a game that worked out pretty well for you.

Now I think I will be able to ask him 2-3 questions which will hopefully enlighten me as to what is going on
here. I ask him one question. He responds by saying he can't answer any questions because his manager is
out. How is that an acceptable response for a CFO? But fine, he says he will call back in 20 minutes, he does
not.


I consider this interaction to be a huge red flag. It's not that he wouldn't answer my questions, If he had
answered the phone and said "I can't talk to you" I would be fine. Or if he had just said "I'm busy right now,"
I'd be fine. But committing to answering questions and then backing out is a big red flag.

ones they think are important.

My point being it seems unlikely you reached the CFO, because (1) that just seems unlikely, and (2) the CFO
doesn't really have a manager. You probably reached someone junior in the CFO's office.

So, a difference in gross margins of 3%? That's a clear sign of fraud ! Shouldn't all gross margins be equal in a
communist country? :-)


Add to that that the company has china in itS name and the cfo didn't aanswer a phone call from an anonymous
investor and the picture becomes really clear ...


Seekingalpha, how can tou allow these practices?

As it seems that most arguments in the SA article are rather weak, the question remains why the stock sold off like
this. Usually when a stock sells off like this on presumably irrelevant things, bad news comes out later .... So, what's
ahead? Weak results? By q4 the company is most likely going to post negative yoy growth rates as no new capacity
comes online and in q4 last year they were above 100% utilisation rates .... Any one any thoughts on this?

The Bleecker short case is fragile.


1. CXDC's R&D as a % of revenue has been consistently higher than Kingfa.


2. CXDC has nearly 250 people on its R&D team vs. 150 engineers at Kingfa.


3. The DSO calculation is wrong (should be in days, not $m). This is elementary analysis.


4. Audit fees rose due to switching to a well-known auditor, and increased revenues.


5. It's common knowledge that SAIC filings are usually incomplete and can be different from other filings.


6. Not returning a phone call does not constitute fraud, although it is a good business practice to do so.


7. A credible company researcher assumes the burden of making sure they get a key source, like the CFO, on the
phone to ask questions to verify and confirm their information. In this case, the rush to print (and judgement) brought

granitepeak: If what you are saying about the R&D and the engineers were true, why doesn't China XD have
any patents? The only actual patent that China XD lists has been purchased for a token amount (carried on
the books at zero dollars) - it was not developed internally. Kingfa, on the other hand, has been granted plenty
of patents.


And why would the SAIC filings be incomplete? They are official documents used by various Chinese
authorities, including tax authorities, and carry the seals (chops) of the companies that file them.


KPMG is a well-known willful violator of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, according to the judge.

Taylor talked with me for approximately 15 minutes. He explained the loan as placed by underwriters Morgan
Stanley and UBS. The debt was reccommended by an earlier SA author. You should read it. He explained the
discrepancies and allegations in your article. Confirmed Homer Sin still sat on the board of Directors of CXDC
for Morgan Stanley. ( Homer is the CIO of Morgan Stanlet Private Equity Asia, MSPEA) Homer is the smartest
man in China for Morgan Stanley or they would not let him make the investment decisions for the $750 million
in FUND II, and $1.5Billion in Fund III. The 16 million share of CXDC is convertible at $6.25 for MSPEA. Your
smell test is off this time. Just look at the other boards of Chinese companies Homer has been placed on by
MSPEA and you will detect an interesting trend, given your accute analytical skillls! The most interesting part
of our converstion was his confusion about your " need to speak with a manager" comment as he has no
manager. He splits his time between China and a small office in US. Only a secretary. All of the business
takes place in China, so no real need for fully staffed US office. He said that the Chinese were looking at you
and ascertained that you were a young man, very unknowledgable about China ( did I think you really
believed that in China, people are running around with barrels of money lending for free, no strings attached,
accepting 0% interest, no possible growth, and assuming the default risk, for what purpose? Does this
happen in America? I responded as only I could based on your article; Yes, I believe you think money is free
and easy in China.) who looked to profit form shorting a very small amount of CXDC. Since there is very little
float as the Chairman owns 66% of the stock, institutions own another 18%, you selected CXDC because you
thought your article could send the stock down on fear and it is very underfollowed by Wall Street and could
have the desired impact for you to profit and then cover your short, which I am assuming you already have.
Too bad. I strongly encourage you to put the short back on and wait for the Aug 10th earning release. A
couple of other suspicious players in the Chinese auto markets posted earnings last week, Ford and General
Motors and reported record growth in China, driving ( no pun intened) the stocks higher. For those who read
this I am sorry I am so late responding as i have been traveling and this was my first opportunity to respond.
Much more was discussed however, this covers a couple of salient points, and i do not have time to cover all
of the allegations you article made against CXDC. Good luck to all. I am going to stay long in the #1
automobile Making Market in the World..22 MILLION cars last year alone. I hope to make even more then I
did on the last company Homer took Private... YONG. Yes, YONGYE was the #2 crown Jewel in MSPEA. The
Number #1? Well, you shorted it.

wolf777dog: Mr. Homer (his name is actually Hong) Sun (not Sin, but he is a Sinner indeed!) facilitates fraud
and money laundering, as proven in the Yongye case (that company was "taken private" by defrauding the
China Development Bank at a valuation inconsistent with the cash and equivalents balance and its reported
growth rate). If he is the smartest man in China at Morgan Stanley, then Morgan Stanley's investors are in big
trouble.


Money is indeed free in China. China XD has disclosed that it was offered a loan with 0% interest, that is a
no-interest loan, by the local government, but somehow the company forgot to take it (the CEO claims he no

A mind changed against its will, is of the Same opinion still. You need to be right. I am more interested in

luck. As for YONG, I made good money on the long side. You are right about one thing: They Stole YONG!
And everybody LONG the stock profited nicely. Do you know why people try to perpetrate Fraud? Its
profitable. Were not your motives to profit from your article and its outcome on the stock? Does this mean you
are a fraud? This is the PRC. They steal and lie and cheat, just like in the US. And they will steal CXDC.

wolf777dog: You are confused. Profiting from an analysis of information that is either immaterial or public (and
from the publication of such an analysis) does not constitute a fraud. On the other hand, publicly supporting a
fraudulent company (including a glowing review of a book by the COO that contradicts YONG's SEC filings)
and signing fraudulent 10Ks (in a Director capacity), while benefiting from it, probably is.


23 Jul 2014, 10:41 AM


wolf777dog
Richard. I am often confused. I would suggest you at least peruse the Curriculum Vitae of Homer (Hong). A
BSE in Chemical engineering from University of Michigan, Magnum Cum Laude 2000, A JD from U of
Michigan cum laude 2003. Managing director of MSPEA in 2000 ( he was 29 at the time ) and CIO of Asian
Operations. I am sure your CV has much more pedigree than his, but his is a matter of public information (
see Bloomberg Business profiles as well as MSPEA web page), and I know nothing of you. We shouild all
move our businesses to China where money is free! There are probably brinks trucks driving around with
loads of cash just looking for a place to dump it so they can earn 0% interest, but you know China better than
most. BTW do you read and speak all Seven Chinese dialects or specialize in just one? Sorry I am so
confused and thank you for your insights. Wolf

Summary


1. CXDC reports substantially margins higher than its main competitor, yet spends much less on R&D.


>>>margins are 21% vs 18%, R&D expenses are in line with industry 
conclusion: no clear evidence of fraud, weak point


2. From 2008-2010 CXDC reported higher revenues and net income in SEC filings compared to SAIC filings.


>>>Per CXDC release improper identification and addition of subsidiary figures explains this purported gap 
conclusion: Bleecker didn't add correctly


3. CXDC CFO refused to answer basic questions about his company, and did not respond to questions.


>>>Relations between Mr. Zhang and Mr. Bleecker continue to be strained, with no signs of reconciliation in the
forecast 
conclusion: Who cares?


4. If the trend of overstating net income from 2008-2010 continues, shares should be worth $1.38/ share.


>>>Again, financial analysis by Bleecker was a2o and doesn't represent a valid claim. Need to get the correct
subsidiary reports to do a a2a review 
conclusion: Bleecker is off again, no clear evidence of fraud

ON US GAAP a company, like Agria (NYSE:GRO) can report viaUS GAAP the full 100% revenue but owns only 51%
of a subsidary (PGW). I think there are a lot of difference between all these accounting standards. And chinese
companies don't have to report in China with IFRS.

Hi Ralf,


Thanks for your attention. Here is the answer to your question:


We assigned these agreements on Christmas Day for the convenience of contract execution with our
distributors.


Every December, automakers release their production plan for the next year, and based on those, auto parts
will determine their corresponding outputs as well as inputs. Then, the distributors in turn collect annual order
demands from auto parts companies and sign contracts with us for the orders they have secured. You can

see that this is really a back-to-back contract signing from auto makers with auto parts, auto parts with
distributors and distributors with us.  
Also, those are only our annual contract. Throughout the year, we have new contracts and supplementary
orders. 
Lastly, we don’t get Christmas break in China as in the Western countries.


 
As expressed in our earlier press release, China XD’s shareholder value is a top concern. Please be assured
that we are taking every suggestion seriously, and are having intensive discussions around all possible
solutions. Any more questions, please feel free to email me.

"We enter into distribution agreements with local distributors (that is, China XD's customers) in areas where
large automobile manufacturers are located. The distribution agreements usually have a term of THREE
YEARS."


So, the agreements signed on Christmas Day 2012 were 3-year contracts, not 1-year contracts, and the
distributors could not have known the auto parts manufacturer's plans for the next three years.

Why R & D expense ? Why patents ? The company is a sxxt mixer relying on well developed technology from the US,
Germany, Japan and Korea. The China auto companies that it supplies want plastic compounds that are more or less
identical and well established elsewhere at major world auto makers. Seems to me that the key drivers for success
are good quality control, state of art imported processing equipment, shrewd purchasing of materials and excellent
contacts within the world wide plastics industry to keep up with, but not get ahead of, the technology. Who needs
patents or R & D in China ?

This is not rocket science ! CXDC is just copying well established US plastic compounders with a 40 year

did a conference call, shares have since rebounded back to $40s. These short pieces can create excellent entries.

5/18/2018 China XD Plastics: When The Numbers Don't Add Up, There's Over 80% Downside - China XD Plastics Company Limited (NASDAQ:CX…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2307195-china-xd-plastics-when-the-numbers-dont-add-up-theres-over-80-percent-downside 57/61


If you've had a chance now to digest the Company's response, could you kindly comment on whether you think China
XD Plastics' numbers are still fraudulent. Thanks.

Joe--Bleecker St. accomplished his objective of getting the share price to drop rather dramatically even with a
very poor, fuzzy math, old and twisted information based article full of innuendo. That's how the short game
works for the most unethical, but it continues to work, especially against small Chinese companies. He wont
respond to you or the company unless he thinks he has something to gain. It's unfortunate that this crud isn't
more fully investigated by the SEC. Until that happens, it will continue here on SA and elsewhere. I have no
current position in CXDC but think the company is under valued and promising.

Author’s reply »  I was impressed that they offered a fact based rebuttal. I disagree with some parts, however.
I think that the DSO increasing "due to macroeconomic conditions" is actually a bad sign, as it seems that
they admitted their business was deteriorating. I thought that saying the CFO wasn't at either of the places
when they were accused of fraud was a weak response, it was relatively soon after he left and I suspect that
fraud doesn't just start overnight, it is just part of the culture. I am skeptical about the claim of R&D and
Kingfa, as someone else on this board made that claim but did not provide any evidence and I haven't seen
that in their public filings.


I think that CXDC overstated revenues and net income from 2008-2010 at the minimum.

Bleecker, I was following one of the companies that the CXDC CFO was at previously. The company was
subsequently found to be involved in questionable behavior. Without going into detail, the one thing I'm fairly
certain of, is that the CFO was not the cause of the company's problems. As with many Chinese companies
the primary shareholder (usually also holding title of chairman) is where you need to focus your due diligence.
As with his prior positions, the CXDC CFO is primarily acting as an investor liaison, which is different than a
typical American CFO who is integrally involved in directing and managing corporate finances. If that is a
basis of your concern, I think you can dismiss it as unmerited.

What didn't you like about the gross margin response? Trading businesses like that are low margin.

Author’s reply »  Unmerited? In the company's response they make the point that the CFO is in China a good
bit and is familiar with their operations. You can't have it both ways.

I'm not sure I understand your comment. Mr. Zhang is titled as "CFO" although, as with many Chinese
companies, my impression is that he acts as an investor liaison, oversees SEC reporting, and coordinates
capital raising activity. My guess is that the comptroller (or equivalent) actually does most of the groundwork
in China as far as financial accounting is concerned in close cooperation with the CEO. So, yes, it makes
perfect sense that the CFO is based in New York and is in China a good bit. If you examine other legitimate
mid and smallcap Chinese companies, this arrangement is not unusual.

The Bleecker report created quite an opportunity for longs. When shortsellers are involved in manipulating the
stock, you can often sit with a bid 5-10% below market and wait for them to try to slap the stock down when
volume dries up. The stock still looks extremely cheap.

Nice report, tells positives and negatives. I knew Bleeker Street was full of it and just another short seller slanting the

I just got an email from Alpha telling me there was some new discussion about this stock. Came here to find piggy
being, well, a pig. Article came out when cxdc was at 12, now it's at 5.92. Sounds like the article contained some
thruths. 
I understand why your banks is dead, piggy!

Tomorrow=$8. Is today tomorrow?


Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, 
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, 
To the last syllable of recorded time; 
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! 
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, 
And then is heard no more. It is a tale 
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
Signifying nothing.

CEO anounced that a dividend is possible.


>>Conference call answer to dividends. 
Taylor Zhang - Chief Financial Officer


So for dividends he (Chairman) said today definitely the company we will do that. And so for share repurchase I think
Chairman Han said, we think we are happy with our capital structure and any further share purchase we actually
reduced the capital flows and which maybe negatively impact the liquidity of the stock.<<

It looks like the author had a big miss. He/she should have predicted and 18% downside instead of an 80% downside.

Spreeding storys and shorting seems to be a lucrative business. Other criminals have to fear prision, these gangster
have to fear nothing. The story teller alwyas short first and cover when their outstanding short position when share
holders lose their nerves. It is sad that we have not seen a share repurchase.
