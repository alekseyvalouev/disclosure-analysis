Titan Machinery: Titanic Downside Risk
Nov. 17, 2015 11:06 AM ET13 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Titan's last two quarterly revenue numbers are the lowest in three years, and the
recent 25.9% YOY plunge is the industry's worst. Thomson Reuters shows an
overall analyst rating of "Hold."


Titan's related-party transactions stand to benefit insiders' entities by $100 million
plus.


The company has already had layoffs and store closings amid difficulties with its
floor plan debt. More of the same can be expected.


A recent case of misstated losses admitted in a footnote with no amended 10-Q
demonstrates TITN's lack of transparency.


Titan has a history of providing positive guidance, revising guidance, and then
missing the numbers altogether.


As it struggles to steer around revenue and cash flow icebergs, Titan Machinery
(NASDAQ:TITN) is beginning to look less like a league of strong mythical Greek gods ...
and more like the "unsinkable" Titanic.


North Dakota-based Titan operates a dealership network focusing on agriculture and
construction equipment. The stock has bounced around like a seasick landlubber, with
shares rallying from ~$10 per share in early September to the recent $13-14. That stock
rally is despite Titan turning in two quarters of the lowest sales numbers it has seen in
three years.


Indeed, the second-quarter revenue of $334 million represented a 25.9% year-over-year
plunge - the worst revenue drop within the entire industry, according to Thomson Reuters.
The mighty sales decline - which hit all four revenue segments - resulted in earnings of
zero. That $0.00 in earnings caps off eight straight periods of negative earnings.


The recently trumpeted deal with money-losing, 98-cents-per-share Intellinetics
(OTCQB:INLX) is just more evidence of Titan's desperation.


Here are highlights of the choppy waters Titan is trying to navigate:

Extreme misstated losses, but no amended 10-Q
Related-party connections potentially draining $100 million plus from Titan
Industry's worst inventory buildup
Struggles to pay off floor plan debt; layoffs and store closings likely to continue
History of providing guidance, revising guidance, and then missing numbers
significantly
Low analyst ratings
Among the industry's worst performers


The company has not responded to a request for comment, but investors may find other
viewpoints HERE. Meanwhile, let's examine more closely just why this is a good time for
Titan's investors to start looking for lifeboats.


Losses Misstated: Titan Calls 50% Understatement "Immaterial"


Among Titan's reported losses, two instances stand out above all the rest. First, in April
2014, Titan's managers quietly disclosed that the company had released a quarterly report
containing drastically inflated assets and understated losses. Astute investors had to dig
up that news - not in a standard amended quarterly report - but in a note near the bottom
of a financial report issued five months later in September.


The net loss turned out to be far worse than the stated $4.2 million. The loss was actually
$6.5 million. On a per-share basis, the newer filing revealed the loss was actually 31 cents
per share, not 20 cents.


The incorrect classification of the VAT asset as a non-monetary asset coupled with
the significant devaluation of the UAH resulted in an overstatement of the
Company's assets (Prepaid expenses and other) as of April 30, 2014 and an
understatement of the Company's loss (Interest income and other income
(expense)) for the three months ended April 30, 2014. This correction increased the
Company's Net Loss Attributable to Titan Machinery Inc. by $2.3 million (from the
previously reported $4.2 million to $6.5 million) and increased the diluted loss per
share by $0.11 (from the previously reported $0.20 loss per share to a $0.31 loss per
share). This correction is reflected in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the six-month period ended July 31, 2014.


Never mind that investors were treated in June 2014 to a press release containing the
wrong loss numbers, propping up the stock price for weeks afterward before falling
several bucks to the ~$12-13 trading range about the time of the financial note disclosure

in September.


Titan's filing actually stated that the misreported losses, ultimately 50 percent higher than
stated, were immaterial, thus unworthy of an amended filing.


Another Loss; More Rewards For Executives


A second, more recent spectacular loss is noteworthy because of the timing. On June 9,
2015, Titan reported a quarterly net loss attributable to common stockholders of -$6.2
million.


And the company reported a yearly loss before income taxes of -$38.3 million.


(Source: SEC filings)


What happened to executives who oversaw these losses? Why, just a few days earlier,
filings show officers and directors were awarded a total of more than 87,000 shares of
stock.


Here is one example, showing then-president Peter Christianson received an award of
16,160 shares:

June 9 was not only the day Titan reported that $38 million loss, but it was also the day of
the annual meeting, a meeting punctuated by Mr. Christianson's formal departure.
Surprisingly, he was still referred to as president in proxy statements prior to the meeting.


Investors have to dig into Mr. Christianson's service agreement to find that the co-founder
"elected to resign as President." Regardless, Mr. Christianson now works as the Chairman
of International Operations and will become a Titan consultant in February at his current
salary of $500,000 per year.


His resignation precedes that of another director, Theodore Wright, whose September 21
departure was more clearly announced in an 8-K about three months after Mr. Wright
received 4,525 shares of Titan stock, apparently for helping the other leaders deliver a
loss.


And leadership activity just gets more interesting ...


Related-Party Connections Worth Hundreds of Millions


The company officers and their relatives have benefited for years - and will continue to
benefit for years to come if Titan continues to operate - from the company's construction
deals and stock offerings. These deals include:


C.I. Construction: Consider brothers Peter Christianson - the president-and-director-
turned-consultant - and Tony Christianson, a director. Their brother-in-law owns C.I.
Construction, which manages construction for Titan's buildings and leasehold
improvement projects. C.I. Construction received $16.4 million in total cost
reimbursements from 2011 to 2015.


Cherry Tree & Associates: For the year ended Jan. 31, 2013, Titan paid $0.2 million to
Tony Christianson-founded Cherry Tree & Associates primarily for the senior convertible
notes offering of 2012 that produced $145 million for Titan's operations.


Dealer Sites: TITN leases many stores - 48 in 2013 - from Dealer Sites, a company linked
to CEO David Meyer, and Christianson brothers Peter and Tony. In just one year, this
lucrative deal handed Dealer Sites more than $6 million and the potential through 2028 for
$109 million.


The payments to C.I. Farm Power, in which Peter Christianson is a controlling stockholder,
may pale in comparison, but is still interesting. See the snapshot from the SEC filing
below.

Titan's deal with Dealer Sites is also fascinating because of a piece of land the property
ownership company bought from Sioux City, South Dakota, upon which to locate a
250,000-square-foot dealership.


Dealer Sites paid $1 for the property for Titan's use ... and apparently folded the resulting
dealership into that comfy multi-million-dollar lease payment deal benefiting Dealer Sites'
guys.


Layoffs, Store Closings


Just how long the Sioux City dealership - or any other one - will stay open is anybody's
guess. Leaders have already closed four dealerships this year and laid off 14 percent of
the staff at a cost of $2 million. Last year, Titan fired 12 percent of its employees and
closed eight stores at a cost of $3.4 million. Considering Titan's condition, we expect
continued layoffs and store closings.


More Bad News Expected


In fact, TITN's captains recently told analysts that business probably won't get any better
anytime soon. They said same-store sales will hurt the business through fiscal 2016. They
expect agriculture same-store sales to decline 20% to 25% and a flat to 5% drop in
international and construction. Furthermore, they expect more customers will stop trading
in their equipment fleets every year.


"You'll probably go back to customers owning their equipment for two, three years and
getting that trade cycle more backlog to a normal situation," said CEO David Meyer.


Titan has made efforts to stabilize the ship but ...


Inventory Buildup Dragging Down Titan, Contributes To Over Half-A-Billion In Debt

Titan is struggling with a big inventory issue, too. The company is finding itself parking
more and more big, new tractors, caterpillars and other equipment in its warehouses. This
inventory is gathering dust right alongside used equipment.


Consequently, Titan is saddled with 228.7 days sales in inventory. With its equipment
sitting around for about two-thirds of a year, Thomson Reuters reports that figure as the
industry's worst. That massive stash of inventory alone is enough to sink a ship. That's
because Titan has to pay on the debt for this equipment.


The company depends on a "floor plan" financing to buy big equipment that its dealers
can sell. As such, equipment manufacturers and their subsidiaries buy the equipment and
Titan pays on the loan when the equipment is sold. Now, the company's debt bill is well
over half-a-billion bucks, a staggering $619.6 million. And in six months, TITN has been
able to pay off only 1.2 percent of that debt.


So, at the current rate, it would take Titan nearly eight full years to get the debt down to
$500 million. TITN has to manage this debt even as its recently amended shrinking credit
facility has become more expensive and company revenue deteriorates.

Trading Halted: Downside Guidance, Non-Compliance With Terms Of Debt Facility

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3691976-titan-machinery-titanic-downside-risk 7/14


As with other issues, Titan can't seem to get away from the ragged edge when it comes to
debt. The company unveiled its anticipated fourth-quarter FY 2015 pre-tax loss of about
$37 million and downside guidance in a preliminary results announcement issued March
9, 2015.


That disastrous announcement includes a statement indicating debt covenant
noncompliance issues:


"The Company is working with the lenders in its bank syndicate with respect to its
expected noncompliance with the current minimum income before income tax
covenant as of the end of its January 31, 2015 fiscal year. The Company anticipates
amending this covenant associated with this credit facility effective as of the end of
its January 31, 2015 fiscal year and for future periods, and therefore does not
anticipate being in violation of any covenants as of January 31, 2015."


Trading of Titan stock was halted with this announcement. The company did manage to
squeeze out another amendment. In fact, if it weren't for multiple amendments - with the
reductions in available borrowings - we wonder if the company would still be in operation.


Read about the recent credit amendments with Wells Fargo and Agricredit here, plus the
brand-new Oct. 28, 2015, Wells Fargo amendment. Interestingly, the credit and trading
halt excitement occurred a few weeks after Equities Research's extensive work on Titan
included this warning about apparently suspicious trading.


Guidance Updates; Then Misery


The chart below indicates some of Titan's guidance changes - and the ultimate miss:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3691976-titan-machinery-titanic-downside-risk 8/14


(Source: SEC filings here, here, here)


Though Titan repeatedly trumpeted buoyant guidance, the company ultimately failed to
deliver millions in net income. Instead, it reported a massive net loss. Meanwhile, the
company's leaders now say they expect TITN will return to non-GAAP profitability this
fiscal year.


Executives Enjoy Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous


Credit amendments, busted guidance, losses, layoffs, store closings and revenue
deterioration aside, executives are enjoying a lifestyle of champagne wishes and caviar
dreams. Indeed, the top trio knocked down compensation of $2.5 million.

And whenever Mr. Christianson jets off to Europe to check out operations, the company
covers at least part of his spouse's travel expenses, too. A commercial ticket isn't even
needed because Mr. Christianson can always jump on the company's private aircraft.


While compensation jumped 55 percent, revenue and investors' return of equity turned
upside down. See the information below:

One Of The Industry's Worst Performers


Though insiders undoubtedly enjoy Titan's benefits, in the eyes of the construction and
agricultural machinery industry, the company is one of the worst performers.

The company falls short in key performance metrics ranging from gross margins to
management effectiveness.

Earnings Misses In 8 Of The Last 9 Quarters


Earnings misses play into Titan's bad-performance equation. With the exception of last
quarter - when zero earnings beat negative consensus - Titan has missed analysts'
expectations each time since September 2013, according to Reuters. The arrows below
denote earnings misses:


(Source: Reuters)


Indeed, of the dozen announcements since December 2012, the three beats offered no
comfort to investors: Dec. 6, 2012, $0.66 beat $0.65 consensus; June 6, 2013, -$0.02
beat consensus by a fraction of a point; and Sept. 9, 2015, $0.00 beat -$0.03 consensus.
Yet, Titan trades at a confounding forward price-to-earnings ratio of 39.94.

The company's pitiful performance has gone on so long, so consistently, that normally
optimistic analysts are beginning to show a loss of faith ... as TheStreetSweeper
demonstrates below.


Poor Peer Comparison; Analysts say "Hold"


Analysts have been able to muster only about a "Hold" rating on Titan, indicates Thomson
Reuters. All industry peers except one received a "Buy" or "Strong Buy" rating.


Compared with its peers, Titan shares the lowest score of "2" and that "Hold" ranking with
Lindsay Corp. (NYSE:LNN). The fundamental rating of "2" is much more bearish than the
industry average of "6.4."


(Source: Thomson Reuters)


So Titan receives just about the worst ranking of all companies in the entire heavy
machinery and vehicles industry.

Comments (13)


Titan has commanded a ~$265 million market valuation despite the fact that its business
recently created a cash flow of just $171,000. Indeed, the cash in its fraying pocket
declined about 25 percent to $95 million in just six months. And those cash concerns
merely top off the inventory disaster, executive enrichment, misstated losses and other
issues we've described for investors.


Titan is vainly trying to bail and still navigate overwhelmingly frigid, treacherous waters.
Indeed, we think a very generous near-term valuation for Titan would be $4 per share.

Strategic Investor, Contributor
Well, this is well researched and the executive comp is a real concern, but this is also a hit piece. The inventory gets
reduced in 4Q because of seasonal factors. Taking a six month view is totally misleading, as anyone who has done as
much research as you must know.

Well, let's see, it COULD be the fact that they have more or less cleaned up the balance sheet, with much
lower inventory and debt, OR it could be the fact that they have been able to repurchase debt at a discount,
reducing their refinancing risk, OR it could be their intent to rationalize the store footprint and reduce costs,
but apart from that, geez, I just don't know...
