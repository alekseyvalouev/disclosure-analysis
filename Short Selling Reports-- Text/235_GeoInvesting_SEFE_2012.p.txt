Sefe Inc.'s Hot Air Balloon About To Burst
May 3, 2012 4:44 AM ET75 comments
by: The GeoTeam


After exposing numerous Chinese reverse merger frauds we recently added to our focus
the identification of U.S. companies that may be misrepresenting their stories to
investors. Our piece on Raystream (OTC:RAYS) was our inaugural U.S. Pump & Dump
(P&D) fraud report. We highlighted our RAYS expose on 12/08/2011 at $1.75 and followed
up with a 40 page report on 12/29/2011. The stock now trades under $0.40. There are
now new issues regarding the RAYS story including our findings that the company has
collapsed its German operating subsidiary, yet to be disclosed in U.S. filings. Has
Raystream written its final epitaph?


Our curiosity is now piqued by Sefe (OTC:SEFE).


We view SEFE no differently than any other Pump & Dump that use exaggerations of the
truth and sexy story lines for which promoters at times spend millions of dollars to
orchestrate massive pump moves. The stock has risen from $0.64 on 2/24/ 2012,
reaching a high of $2.96 on 3/25/2012.


Buyers Beware


The pump and dump universe is just a game of who will be the greater fool holding the
bag? And we bet the promoters who get paid in stock will not be those fools. Neither will
large holders of SEFE stock as is evident by a schedule D filed on April 13, 2012 revealing
that investors, including insiders, registered to sell $8 million worth of shares.


"Third parties" have spent at least five million dollars to peddle this story to unsuspecting
investors by utilizing some of the most notorious promotional organizations out there such
as Stocks Digest Magazine (received $2.5 million in cash and $2.5 million in shares),
Stock Hunter, The Stock Detective and Awesomestocks.


SEFE is being promoted by the same outfits that successfully pumped the Sunpeaks
Ventures (SNPK.OB) story. However, in just one day SNPK gave back nearly all of its
massive gains and now trades at around $0.50. SNPK pumped from $0.42 on 3/8/2012 to
$2.40 on 4/18/2012 before experiencing its first massive dump on the same day, reaching
a low of $0.55.

On April 18, 2012 SEFE was also eager to announce that it had signed a term sheet for
$2 million in financing with its financial partner, Riverbend, LLC. The company stated:


"it has signed a term sheet for $2 million in financing through a nonconvertible
preferred debenture. A debt structure was chosen rather than equity financing in
order to preserve shareholder value and avoid dilution."


What SEFE failed to mention in the press release was that they issued Riverbend
warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of stock at $1.00. Management only later discloses
this fact in an 8k filed on April, 25 2012.


Notice that we have not even mentioned what SEFE does yet. That is because we do not
believe it matters. We could stop writing the article at this point since all investors really
need to know is that legitimate companies will likely not find themselves associated with
what many consider pump and dump outfits. Furthermore, from our point of view, with 50
million shares outstanding and no revenues, the capital structure makes this story a no go
from the get go when you consider the funds this development stage company will have to
raise to generate revenues, if you want to even believe they have a legitimate
operation. But let's move on.


History Reveals More Red Flags


SEFE was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 2004 under the name,
Midnight Candle Co., a failed business venture. On July 16, 2010 Midnight Candle
purchased intellectual property rights, via the issuance of 30 million shares, to a firm
called SEFE, Inc. Thus, SEFE the public company was born. Since this transaction, the
company has raised $637,000 from stock offerings and amassed around $600,000 in debt
in from July 16, 2010 through March 11, 2011. The July 16 asset acquisition included a
related party transaction:


"Pursuant to the July 16, 2010 Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, the
Company assumed liabilities totaling $250,000 in the form of convertible notes
payable, due equitably to two holders, one of which is a related party entity."


All told, two of the debt obligations from July 16, 2010 through March 11, 2011 originated
from related party transactions and were eventually sold to "other individuals" and were
converted into 9 million shares (to settle "defaults").

https://seekingalpha.com/article/554371-sefe-inc-s-hot-air-balloon-about-to-burst 3/25


Predictably, as of December 31, 2011 the company had already converted $370,000 of
defaulted debt into 11.8 million shares of SEFE stock to settle its debts. At December's 31,
2011 closing price these shares were worth $5.9 million. At SEFE's peak price of $2.96 on
March 25, 2011, the shares were worth $35 million. As gleaned from the 2011 10k, all told
the company:


"will have arranged with our note holders to convert $590,000 of our bridge notes,
into 17,999,998 shares of our common stock"


What does SEFE have to show for these fund raising activities?


Zero revenue
Defaults on all five debt instruments issued from July 16, 2010 through March 11,
2011.
Some investors that have likely made a handsome sum of money from a company that
has yet to generate one penny of revenues.


Are We Starting to See a Reason for a Pump and Dump Campaign?


So what is this business plan that has yielded no revenues and numerous defaults on
debt?


All we had to do was read SEFE's description to postulate that something is not right:


"SEFE focuses on pushing the boundaries of what's possible, embracing innovation
and employing the cutting-edge to solve problems, and offering sustainable solutions
to a world hungry for invention, direction and leadership. SEFE is technology- and
solutions-driven, focusing on developing inventions that provide a real-world impact
and true profitability. So, success is measured by both a sustainable return on
investment, as well as a project's sustainability from an environmental perspective."


We had no idea what this meant, so we continued to probe into SEFE's business plan.


SEFE has produced a video that can be viewed directly on its website which gives a
general overview of the concepts regarding how the technology would work. The premise
of the technology is to float some sort of tethered balloon in the lower atmosphere,
capable of collecting electrostatic energy that would be sold to utility and mining
companies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/554371-sefe-inc-s-hot-air-balloon-about-to-burst 4/25


The company is not explicit on how much energy could be produced. Furthermore,
SEFE's Director of engineering, Michael Hurowitz, poses a serious question in the video
that, on the surface, seems to raise some doubt in the viability of the company's
technology:


"The big question for us? Can we design a system to harness this high voltage
electrostatic energy in a significant way?"


Are you telling us that this stock is worth tens of millions of dollars ($153 million market
cap at a peak price of $2.96) on a system with a rather large QUESTION MARK?


The 2011 10k issued on March 29, 2012 confirms that the company has no product to
market:


"We currently have no marketable units and therefore have not begun to
distribute any products."


And even if we wanted to believe that SEFE was on the cusp of some ground breaking
technology we presume it could take years before it would be able to bring a product to
market. Although we are by no means experts in the arena of harnessing power from
unproven methods, we can still assume that regulatory approval would likely first be
needed from the likes of the Department of Energy (DOE) or the Federal Aviation
Administration since an object would be permanently floating in the sky.

Grass Roots


Given our findings we were surprised to see a Market Wire press release issued by Grass
Roots Research that helped inspire a massive multi-day run in SEFE shares from $1.65
on April 23, 2012 to $2.96 in mid-day trading on April 25, 2012. Grass Roots research
dubs themselves as the #1 small cap research firm. On April 23, 2012 they issued the
paid-for bullish report (for which they received $15,000) on SEFE with a price target of
$5.95.


We urge investors to visit Grass Roots website and decide for themselves if this
"research" outfit follows impressive small cap companies.


Grass Roots offers up an impressive looking financial model that predicts SEFE will see its
revenues explode from $1.6 million in 2013 to $279.8 million in 2019 with pretax margins
ranging from 41% to 56%. Grass Roots estimates that this enviable growth will be
accomplished by issuing no debt and just $5 million worth of stock. What they may have
failed to do is read SEFE's 2011 10K which states the following:


"We are actively raising additional capital by conducting additional issuances of our
equity and debt securities for cash."


There are other reasons to believe that Grass Roots did not pay close enough attention to
SEFE's filings. The firm estimates that total operating expenses will amount to $600,000 in
2013 and just $1.2 million in 2014. Yet, the 2011 10K shows that SEFE incurred operating
expenses of $900,00 on zero sales, before even "ramping" up alleged operations. Is it
logical that operating expenses will go down as SEFE spends dollars to test,
develop and market their product? We view the Grass Roots report as a fluff piece to

push shares that the firm may own higher (the company is sometimes paid for
commercial advertisements and distribution in cash, stock, Rule 144 stock warrants,
options or other securities)


GeoInvesting would like to pay homage to the memory of Nikola Tesla, the man who
invented the alternating current (NYSE:AC) that ushered in the modern day era. Several
parts of SEFE's video showed one of his great inventions called the "Plasma Lamp". Tesla
died broke in a hotel room in New York. I'm sure if he were alive today he would be
thinking, "These bozos haven't even designed anything yet and they are already multi-
millionaires". He must have be rolling over in his grave as this charade plays out.


We conclude that SEFE is an ideal pump and dump candidate that will surely end badly
for those who don't sell before the inevitable dump. Remember this is all a game. The
promoters and others involved in pump and dump schemes who receive stock need to
eventually sell their stock. It is that simple. It is always just a matter of timing. At that point,
it does not even matter if the story has legs. Have fun on the way up, but sleep with one
eye open as the stock is already breaking down.


For the record, we will not stop at SEFE. Our pipeline of brazen pump and dump stocks is
growing, and we will pounce at any opportunity to spread the truth about some of the
largest schemes that ultimately bilk investors out of millions of dollars.


Disclosure: I am short OTC:SEFE, OTC:RAYS.

Unbelievable stuff. I nearly bought in at $1.20 having read one of those pump articles..May I ask why are these sort of
dodgy dealings 
and PAID flase advertising permitted by law, why is it legal. I am in Australia..is there no regulatory body or rules in
the USA? 
Great work Geo Team

I'd suggest selling at a profit. I lucked upon one such P&D, bought for $25 & sold at $87 before the stock went
to zero. Never again. Show me a product or at least a credible model, test and results. This is the problem
with the social network bubble. I mean, how many ways can you tell folks what you're having for a snack?

Author’s reply »  Tom,  
I think that the SEC just can't keep up with these crooks. Understaffed. Also, even when these criminals are
convicted they still have made so much money that the monetary fines offer no incentive to stop. Really is just
a total joke and embarrassing. In the end we don't have a problem with investors speculating on either side of
the pump and dump. But also in the end we aim to tell the truth.

I would have believed that the SEC would have been understaffed 5 years ago. They are just completely
lacking leadership right now. They allowed Raystream to exist because they did not know how to enforce the
rules on scams. Raystream reported early in the fall of last year that they had no patents yet because of
fearing someone would copy their "proprietary" software. Turns out this was a big lie because it is "open
source" software that they use and lured stupid investors that did not know what due diligence they should
have had before investing. I did buy a few shares and can absorb the loss, but a lot of retirees bought this
stupid stock based on lies. I hope Raystream and all their management gets what's coming to them. Never
could understand how the float shares still remain at 47,000,000 with market cap around 14,000,000 and it is
trading in the "pink paper" market now.

I have a company called "Knock Out" that sends me investment ideas and they told me to invest in SNPK. I
am just learning about stocks and invest very little, but it is now worth something like 40.00 instead of 290.00
that I paid for it. Now i saw an article in USA Today about SEFE and it has done about like SNPK. I have
learned my lesson about these cheaters. Thanks, GEO Team now I know these are phonies.

Looks like SNPK is genuine stock and rising up again , it just a matter of time when it will rise up again . I think, all
these publicity studs are trying to catch the lost game by de-faming it.

The GeoTeam, Marketplace Contributor
Author’s reply »  Bigmatt. It is not always easy to find shares to short of pump and dump stocks. For
example, we could not find any shares to short of SNPK. Your ability to short shares will depend on the
brokerage firm you use and their success at finding shares for you to borrow. Basically when you go short you
are borrowing shares from someone who owns the stock and then selling it.

her hero John Galt had developed such an engine/motor in her book

I didn't believe it for one second though I did think about buying a little and selling in a couple of days like the

So much has been made about the paid advertising, and I wonder what world do you think we live in??? Of
course PR and advertising costs $$$$, what is the freakin' crime in all that? This is not Congress getting stuff
for free. My dentist sends me postcards and offers, so do lots of other places. Ever buy a stamp lately?


As unwelcome as we may think some of these things are, it does not mean they are scams, each one has to
be reviewed on its own merits and decide for itself. At least there is more disclosure nowadays about lots of
things, before there was none. In the long run what does it matter, you either like it or not. If I bought into
every tip I got in the mail or e-mail, man forget it!


05 May 2012, 10:36 AM


dallasman
True, but when they pay for advertising with false claims to drive people to buy a stock, there is a problem. Go
look at SEFE's financials. Go look at the players invlolved. Look at absurd idea they are trying to push on
unsuspecting investors who wanna believe that fairy tale. Comparing these ads to your dentist sending you
offers is comparing apples and tire irons.


Call it what it is. A pump and dump sheme. I play the p & d's and make a profit (usually), but I am not under
the illusion that most of them are legit companies. Get in, get out. Go to the bank. Period


BTW...SEFE along with 99% of these pink sheet penny stocks cannot be shorted, so I do not know why
people claim to short this stock.

What players are you talking about? Midnight candle and it's former origins? I would like someone to point out
to me ONE SINGLE LIE that the current SEFE staff or management has stated...just one. Just because all
intentions or discoveries have not been proven yet does not make them a lie. That is why they are called
"theories" or "experiments." And what looks good on a lab table, or test tube, may not work out on a larger
scale. That is called "trying". Ever hear of Thomas Edison and the number of tries at the lightbulb...thousands!


If you take the time to read the patents, there is a long list of "claims" that each patent is trying to take credit
for. They are simply that, claims...does not make them lies even if they can't all be proven.


In spite of "claims" that SEFE has lied or exaggerated, it is possible that creative speculation on some of the
applications of the technology have crept into the promoters literature. But to say that someone has
deliberately lied or misled others is pretty raw. Just because this GEO guy writes in dark letters and big ???
about what he doesn't really know yet is really misleading also.


We can argue about the past all we like, but as far as I am concerned, if the new CEO has come out with a
way forward based on the press release a week ago, let's put things in the here and now and see what they
can make happen. His plans are for partnership, non-dilutive financing, more IP work/patents and the
atmospheric testing. He has the work cut out for him and the team. So there are plenty of goals to judge them
on.


Especially they have opened the door to foreign partnership attempts and patent protection. They are way
smarter than anyone on this board about getting this to market, so I am going to watch and I'll be the first to
scream if I see a lie, etc.


As far as the shorting, last check on shortsqueeze.com there were only about 400k shares short, looking for
update soon, so I don't see that as a major factor.


Bear in mind that many companies have been slaughtered by shorting, naked or otherwise, on foreign
exchanges, such as the infamous Berlin exchange. So, as far as any "rules" about those places, anything is
possible.

We can argue about the past all we like, but as far as I am concerned, if the new CEO has come out with a
way forward based on the press release a week ago, let's put things in the here and now and see what they
can make happen. His plans are for partnership, non-dilutive financing, more IP work/patents and the
atmospheric testing. He has the work cut out for him and the team. So there are plenty of goals to judge them
on.

I put this question to you, since you are so adamant about finding a demon under every rock, what about the
patent lawyers and other legal entities that SEFE is using? You have not mentioned any of those folks, maybe
you are not aware of these  players in the game, so I would like your opinion...are they all part of the scam,
too? Why would they risk scam prosecution from the same people that they are working with???


>>Here's their SEC counsel. This law firm is a well respected top securities law firm.

>>No surprise the patents are well done, their IP firm is Mintz Levin, one of the top patent firms.

skeptic 666
I literally laughed out loud when I watched the CEOs recorded video.


http://bit.ly/V2McCp


He was, of course, careful not to say anything that would support a securities fraud case.


What got me laughing was the hilarious scientific presentation by their boy wonder chief technologist. Sure,
there is atmospheric electricity to harvest, but it will never be economically superior to solar PV or other
proven technologies useful for off grid applications.


Can you imagine the difficult in maintaining tethered balloons in big storms? The "sci props" used for the talk
just had me splitting my gut laughing (I am an electrical engineer). A digital volt meter showing MILLIVOLTS
and a disco HV discharge ornament like the one I bought from Radio Shack years ago. It was like a low
budget sci fi movie. These guys need better props, 19 inch rack panels full of outdated test gear can be
bought at auctions for a hundred bucks each. They are a lot more impressive than a cheap DVM and an
arcing sparking toy.


Their IP isnt impressive, focuses mostly on balloon tethering hardware and offers no serious barrier to
competition. What does bar competition is the impractcality of harvesting atmospheric static electricty. Nobody
who performs any serious due diligence will compete.


I got one of their pump it up brochures in the mail a few months ago and had a good chuckle. I also felt really
sorry for those who would be influenced to invest in this venture by the enthusiastic claims made.

Thanks for taking the time to start a whole new ID to make that post. From a skeptic point of view, you cannot
possible say anything that has not been posted before. You sound like the type of naysayer that already
exists on other message boards.


That being said, SEFE has never said they will replace or eliminate other technology. It is merely another
choice that will be available in certain applications were by reason of infrastructure or grid availability or
portable power access, etc the balloon source will be available. If 90%+ of the time the weather is cooperative
to allow balloon deployment, it should be seen as a good possibility.


SEFE already plans for sensors to detect lightning in the area which they want to avoid for sure. In that case
the balloon will be automatically winched in on it's tether. The tether will also have a patented shock arresting
device, call it a bungie cord, which will help. SEFE system allows for power storage in case of downtime.


Note that compared to solar and wind, etc, SEFE system does not require a large investment in land
ownership. There have been some cents/kwhr numbers out there but until they get some hardware firmed up
it is silly to project those, but instinctively I feel it has to be way cheaper for the volume they will generate.
Note that large power facilities need hundreds of megawatts generated to make the initial investment
worthwhile, whereas SEFE needs maybe 50,000 kw or less to meet individual location needs.


Things are proceeding along with new developments. It will take longer than you like but will happen sooner
than you think. I also await the first device that demonstrates that it will work. Ideally it would have been better
to already have a working system before they launched into the stock market, but it did not happen that way.

Author’s reply »  Kyle. I am with you on this point. As long as you can get in early enough you can make
money on both sides of the coin. But it does not make what these companies do right. It is not fair to that
investor who bought shares from you at $2.78 based on some false premise peddled by the company.

You are just as much a part of the so-called pump and dump activity as you claim the others are. You also have no
responsibility to be honest or accurate, and are cowardly and anonymously hiding behind yet another internet creative
writing site.


For those that read to the bottom of your stinkbomb, it becomes clear that you are short the stocks you
bash....wow...new concept!!!


Of course you are not a broker-dealer with fiscal responsibilities that the SEC would be caring about, assuming they
could. But playing the pump and dump game at all the levels possible is what you are a part of, and you are no better
than the other folks you accuse of wrongdoing. You are just another bushwhacker.


I have made money in SEFE, (NOT shorting) like many other posters....in the long run any stock can be played for the
ups and downs. There are many so-called non P&D stocks that suffer 50% whacks, based on earnings and any
number of legitimate reasons. You would have fun covering emerging biotechs, there is real food for scams and
unmet expectations.

Author’s reply »  Heb. What is the alternative? Please enlighten me on how the process should work? You
would like no body writing articles on stocks they are long or short? It seems that you have no problem
making money on the long side of SEFE, whose story was pasted across the world wide web by outfits that
were paid in cash and stock. So as long as it suits your needs, you can justify it. And let's be clear.. you would
not have made money had it not been for the pump campaign.

P&D happens...I could say that about almost any stock. However those that try to manipulate the market with
authoritative influence are the real pirates, IMO. I thought that in former days, a broker/analyst from let's say
GS or BAC could downgrade a stock right after he lined up clients to go short. Supposedly they cracked down
on it but it sure looks that has not stopped. I really don't know the influence you had on the pps, maybe it was
coincidence it dropped, but some take the S/A stuff seriously. However, in the extreme, if you read the pump
and dump scenario...the theory is that after the pump the effort is made to deliberately drive the pps down,
gaining by "shorting", and then guess what- reverse position and go long.


I don't know what sort of characters you have to encounter to short SEFE, I know they are out there, even the
naked shorters, but with Ameritrade often I can't even go long on some of these OTCBB and Pinkies. I came
across SEFE because of the volume alerts and other messages that came across the newswires on
Ameritrade, I took some chances and ran with some of the momentum...often just jumping in blindly. The fact
that I made some money was pretty lucky, I went in and out a few times. But now my curiosity is sparked and
I am intrigued as I dig in more. I am not caught up with crazy behaviors of shady characters from the past. I
think the CEO has put us in the here and now and I am interested to see what he comes up with. He has
some youngsters working with him, but we have Facebook guy and Google guys etc along the same lines,

05 May 2012, 04:09 PM

The above article links to: 
http://bit.ly/JaXxIv 
"SEFE is also the newest client of Geoffrey Eiten‘s notorious stock pumping investor relations shop OTC Financial
Network aka National Financial Communications, and Paul Cohen‘s ridiculous Grassroots Research aka Cohen
Research. More on those two fine fellows in a bit, but first lets look at the origins of SEFE, Inc."


In other words, the claims of SEFE may be real, but they may have been persuaded to obtain capital from a "stock
pumping investor relations shop" whether or not they realize it. If you think about it, these stock pumpers are not only
destroying investors, they could also be destroying the efforts of entrepreneurs by discouraging further investing.


"SEFE began life as a humble Nevada incorporated shell called Midnight Candle Company (MCDL). The sole officer,
director, and 95.6% majority shareholder was Ms. Helen C. Carey."


Let's go on and see what this article says about the cast of characters.


"The company was being run out of a 1700 square foot condominium at 79013 Bayside Court in Indio. See it here." 
"A woman with the same name, and of the same age, shows up linked to several properties in the Phoenix/Scottsdale
area of Arizona. Remember that."


There's nothing all that special about having a 1700 square foot condominium.


"In January 2006, shares of Midnight Candle were listed for trading on the Pink Sheets. By May 2008, enough time
had passed to “season” the shell, and activity began. First Helen decided to do a 30 for 1 forward split of the stock,
and to increase the amount of authorized shares to 200,000,000."


Maybe Helen wasn't aware about how that action would look to those who investigate penny stocks.


"Then, sometime between May and July of 2008, a gentleman named Patrick Deparini linked up with Helen and
became the CFO. According to his resume, Deparini went to school at the University of Nevada – Las Vegas in 1993,
finally emerging with a B.S. in Finance in 1999. This genius took six years to get a degree from UNLV. One wonders
who else was fighting for the rights to hire this wunderkind. Midnight Candle must have been lucky." 
"Or was it something else, different from luck? For Mr. Deparini’s resume shows lots of fascinating, overlapping work
experience. From 2001 up until this very day Patrick has worked for the Nascent Group:" 
"In reality the Nascent Group is one of many reverse-merger schlock house located in Las Vegas. Check out their
website here. At the same time that Patrick was working in the dirtiest part of the stock market at Nascent Group, he
was also working as a lowly paralegal."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/554371-sefe-inc-s-hot-air-balloon-about-to-burst 17/25


So Helen allowed someone with weak credentials (Patrick) to get on board.


"Paralegal" 
"Law Offices of Harold P. Gewerter, Esq., Ltd." 
"Wow! If Patrick formed the securities law and litigation division, he must have been some amazing paralegal. Or is
Patrick just buffing his resume a lot?" 
"Gewerter has been practicing law since 1979, and his business appears to be almost entirely securities law and
litigation. The Las Vegas law firm of Harold P. Gewerter is connected to many penny stocks, including two that seem
to do nothing more than create and promote more reverse merger trash! Check out the website for Gerwerter’s Crown
Equity Holdings (CRWE) a one and a half cent special, and under a penny pinksheeter Public Company Management
Corp (PCMC). However, Harold is most well known for his role as John Edwards‘ attorney in the CMKM Diamonds
(CMKX) scam. Edwards was instrumental in putting the CKMX deal together in the first place. According to an article
in the Las Vegas Review-Journal." 
"The Las Vegas Review Journal has done a great job reporting on the CMKX fraud. Read more about it here, and
more here, and in the New York Times, here and here." 
"CMKX was quite a phenomenon, although an obvious fraud its low share price and massive media attention created
a large following of shareholders who were virtually cult-like. While likely accidental, the frequency and repetition of
the CMKM Diamonds message, name, and ticker, would have made Goebbels proud. Many CMKX shareholders, like
China Agritech (CAGC) shareholders, still have not accepted that they were scammed, check out this moron who still
appears to believe that the SEC, the DTCC, and other actors secretly conspired to keep untold riches out of CMKX
shareholders’ hands."


So Gewerter, created a lot of "merger trash" like CMKX. They employed Patrick. After that, Helen of MCDL hired
Patrick. Did Helen hire Patrick knowing that people who invest penny stocks will attempt to associate Gewerter and
CMKX with MCDL?


http://bit.ly/JOpuJf 
"When we ended The Mass Psychology of Suckers Part 1, we were examining the unique resume of SEFE (aka
Midnight Candle) CFO, Patrick Deparini. At first glance he appears to be an odd choice as CFO. He had no real
experience working in finance, nor in the candle business. His real job was as a paralegal at the law firm of Harold P.
Gewerter, Esq. Ltd."


So he worked outside of an area of his qualification (finance) as a paralegel. He gets associated with CMKX fraud of
Gewerter.


"Harold Gewerter’s most famous client, John Edwards*, was mighty busy by the mid-00s. Not only was John the
mastermind behind the CMKX fraud, but he was also behind Pinnacle Business Management (PBCM), US Canadian
Minerals (UCAD), St. George Minerals (SGGM), BioTech Medics (BMCS), Global Diamond Exchange (GBDX),
Equitable Mining (EQBM), OMDA Oil and Gas (OOAG), and Grand Entertainment & Music (GMSC). Read more in
this excellent piece by Janice Shell, here, or go to Pacer, and read the entire USA v. Turino, Edwards, et. al.
indictment of March 24, 2010." 
"So, perhaps some of John’s industriousness rubbed off on Patrick, for soon Patrick started his very own little shell
company. In late 2004, young Patrick, then only 29, was listed as the CEO and majority shareholder of Las Vegas
based Nascent Wine Company (NCTW) today a pink sheet stock that sells for less than 1/4 of a cent per share."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/554371-sefe-inc-s-hot-air-balloon-about-to-burst 18/25


"How did SEFE (fka MDCL) CEO, Helen C. Cary, sitting in Indio, CA and Patrick Deparini, in the offices of a sleazy
law firm in Las Vegas, find one another?"


What about job posting in a classified ad? Personal connections via a few degrees of separation?


"The lawyer that is listed on the original SB-2 filing (see here) for NCTW was Wendy E. Miller. Wendy was not only an
attorney at the firm of Harold P. Gewerter, Esq. Ltd., (see here) but she also represented Harold in the most recent
SEC v CMKX case, filed in November of 2011." 
"The lawyer that is listed on the original SB-2 filing for MCDL (nka SEFE)? Wendy E. Miller yet again (check it out
here). What a surprise!"


So what kind of relationship is between Wendy and Helen, or for that matter, between Wendy and Patrick? Whose
idea was it to come up with SEFE? I wonder if the article actually tries to answer that question! Let's see:


"First Gewerter‘s firm creates a shell, then they install one of their own as CFO, but now what? By the end of 2008,
SEFE (fka MDCL) has still not generate a dime in revenues, and has only $272.00 in the bank. By the end of 2009,
according to their 10K, the company still has no revenues and only $11 remains on the balance sheet." 
"What non-affiliated third-party would ever loan money to a candle company, that has not had a penny in revenues
since its formation almost 6 years prior, on an as-needed basis at no interest? Clearly something is up."


If these suspicions are correct, then it is possible that Gewerter or perhaps just some of its associates (e.g. Wendy),
are responsible for creating SEFE. But was the business behind SEFE their idea? Or is it Helen's idea? Maybe Helen
knows someone that these penny stock articles do not mention. Just exactly what are the connections?


Let's look at the author of the patents:

"SEFE was founded in 2008 with the notion that intellectual property can drive product solutions."

So the SEFE was *acquired* by the Midnight Candle Company. Then it became "SEFE, Inc." Maybe 2008 refers to

Somewhere along the way I have encountered other company names with "SEFE", those PRs get posted to
the St Elmo's page.


Anyway, good job in letting folks know that some of the inflammatory statements can be deflated a bit. Two
sides to every story.


I think the GEO author needs to go back and check out any high school science fair activities of the Chief

"This was posted today...http://bit.ly/IYtoen" 
"Very revealing."


How is that very revealing? 
The word "headquarters" literally means:


"a center of operations, as of the police or a business, from which orders are issued"


That a "center of" operations is where orders are *issued* does *not* imply that it is same place where they
are *executed*. Given the depicted headquarters in that link you gave clearly is not one where one is building
or testing the patented technology, it could instead be where a lot of files are kept regarding the status and
past activities of the company. Of course it is possible for the majority of the action to occur outside HQ itself.


Many small businesses in the industrial sector (particularly those with relatively simple operations) can be
controlled remotely, often in the study room in the company president's house (often these happen be
McMansions in the suburbs where floor plans have laid out a "study room" separate from other areas in the
house). Even though the effective headquarters of a business might be in someone's house, that does not
prevent such businesses from accomplishing some heavy-duty work in a place *outside* that house. Such a
"study room" headquarters is indeed analogous to a relatively empty office like that depicted in the linked
page. The difference is merely that of a small residential room vs. a medium-sized commercial space.

i agree with kyle, just get in low and make some dough. maybe all the bad press is designed to get people to dump it
so they can slam a large order at a discount. who knows, it is just a big game

Big deal, if the place was full of stuff you would scream they are wasting money and not doing the air testing...


Why don't you get pics of the holdings at the Arizona location....did you know they are a thousand miles
apart? Have you ever moved long distance?  
I suspect the employees are trying to get their own selves situated in Boulder before the wires and meters
come over.

Ever heard of "UNIVERSAL PRECAUTION?"... while it mostly pertains to the medical field it simply means to always
assume that anything can hurt you at any time so always be prepared and protect yourself. In other words assume
everythings a "PUMP & DUMP"... buy low and and know where you want to get off bus in advance.

Well-written article and I am glad I read it. I am 49 years old, have earned significant money in the services industry
and have been an "ok" stock investor. I admittedly have fallen victim to pump and dumps, quite a few, actually. I
usually buy after an upbeat article, such as the grass roots one. I, at the end of the grassroots article did find myself in
a mixed reaction: Extremely optimistic reporting in a field(alt energy) that may hold promise; versus this profound,
dogmatic use of words and phrases like "pushing the boundaries" and so on. Now to find out that they were paid 15
g's to write that article. I don't remember, did the author provide disclosures on his holdings of that stock? It's sad,
really. There exists the potential to really strike it big with some small issues but you really have to do your homework.
I think for starters, a company must have a product or a renderable service. Without it, they're just that: pump and
dump.

09 May 2012, 02:59 PM


tbing77
Anyone hear anything about RARS. I received an email today from the same people that brought me SNPK. Im sure it
is a P&D scheme, but just thought I would ask.

Author’s reply »  tbing77, we have started tracking RARS, but have no opinion yet. Although it appears to be
an ideal pump candidate. (but stock just got hammered).

Recently there were some pictures posted on Yahoo Message board that showed essentially an empty office space at
the new HQ in Colorado. A stink was raised and cries of scam and fraud and call the SEC, etc arose. I wrote to Justin
at SEFE about the move to Boulder (progress) and also about who would attend the Baltimore conference (no small
trip for them). Here is the reply, and I would also recommend that if any of you have SEFE questions, I find Justin to
be very helpful. Better than just spewing speculative mindless venom all over.

XXXX,


Thank you for your well wishing. Representing SEFE at the conference will be our CEO Don Johnston and our lead
research developer Mike Hurowitz. We have completed the move to Boulder. What those pictures don't show is our
lab and office located at the rear of that building. The space depicted is an area we have available for expansion and
have not utilized just yet. Field testing and additional lab work are going to be under way in the near future.

Author’s reply »  A post by the company's investor relations...they have been very careful to write quite an
innocuous article, almost like we were reading a chapter out of a textbook. While we feel that every company
with vocal investor relations is making an effort to be as transparent as possible, this article is basically just
saying to take a closer look at $SEFE since SEFE "believes" it has a viable green energy alternative, and at
most conveys the company's thoughts but not really getting into any details. Is there anything wrong with
saying that? Not really.

Nice to see an intention of teaming up of SEFE with University of Colorado. For lots of reasons very positive move. If
funding by the Univ is in the works, it will take awhile, but certainly the talent pool and networking is very huge. From
Boulder to Colorado Springs, anything to do with studying the atmosphere is the best place on earth, IMO (NOAA HQ,
Air Force Academy, NORAD, Univ of Colo and Colorado Univ).


If there is any way this project can show fruit, it can happen there, and SEFE is in the right place at the right time.

I have to call the author out on something, since in the title of this article, the author refers to a Hot Air balloon.
Nowhere in any SEFE literature did I read about them using hot air for lift. This was an image created by the
scammers and bashers to make things look more rediculous and impractical. This misconception has been multiplied
all around the internet, until it starts to look real.


If you went to uspto.gov and read SEFE's patents, you would see no such concept. Moreover, the concept that SEFE
would need very heavy cables to operate the balloon is also bunk. They use a lightweight poly-wire material similar to
electric fence wire. Here is an excerpt from one of the patents:


>>>The mechanism of this invention utilizes an aircraft such as a lighter than air balloon. While the preferred
embodiment uses a foil balloon, a variety of other aircraft are obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, including, but
not limited to: gliders, rubber balloons (such as weather balloons), biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate
polyester film balloons, and latex balloons.


Within this discussion, the balloon is referenced, but, the invention is not intended to be limited solely to balloons.


The balloon is sent aloft and is tethered by a conductive line. In this context, the conductive line may be any obvious
to those of ordinary skill in the art. For the preferred embodiment, the conductive line is a generically referred to as a
"poly-rope" and is commercially available through a variety of sources. A suitable conductive line is described in U.S.
Pat. No. 5,203,542, entitled "Apparatus for Improved Electric Fence Wire Construction for use with Intensive Grazing"
issued Apr. 20, 1993, to Coley, et al. and incorporated hereinto by reference.


The conductive line is played out of a winch to control the altitude of the balloon. The motor controlling the winch is
able to reverse direction to both extend and withdraw the conductive line which is wrapped around a spool on the
winch. The winch/spool combination are part of a base unit.

Get a grip. we did not create this image. It is right from SEFE video!!!!

To be a hot air type balloon, it would have to carry the heat source up with it. SEFE would NEVER propose
using something as heavy as that, and without human operators on hand to control it it would be rediculous.


You have concocted a whole thought process around some cartoon taken by yourself to be a detailed design
drawing.


Again, if you read the patents, no hot air balloon was discussed and would be impossible to yield the long
duration lift they need.

Great investigation, GeoTeam. I got the 'Stock Digest' pamphlet in the mail (I wonder how they got my address?). So I
followed SEFE for a while (with skepticism), and now I know they're a fraud, thanks to your Team.

I know nothing of stocks and such as far as the legal gabble goes. The question I have is, what does this articles info
have to do with the current SEFE. It changed its board of directors in April, 2012. That's why SEFE got popular. It was
a whole new company then, with the scientists developing the technology, finally gaining control of their creation. This
article only focuses on really old financial reports. I know nothing of SEFE, either, but this technology is real and up-
and-coming. People should research the stock company first, and then the financial records. Technically, this stock
now, is still only 2months old. I think people jumped the gun on all accounts.
