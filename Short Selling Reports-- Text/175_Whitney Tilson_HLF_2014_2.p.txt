Why I'm More Confident Of My Herbalife Short Position Today
Jul. 22, 2014 7:57 PM ET220 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


The Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) bears won the day yesterday and the bulls won the day (and
then some) today. Yawn. This is why I run a diversified short book.


Over the past year and a half since his initial presentation, Bill Ackman and his team at
Pershing Square uncovered a lot of great new information about the company and how it
operates that neither I nor anyone else (nor even Ackman himself) knew, but much of this
didn’t come through clearly in his presentation today (which you can watch here) for
various reasons – just read any of the harsh media coverage. But I don’t care about the
messaging – that can be fixed. I care about the substance.


To be short this stock (as I am), you have to believe two things:


1) That the majority (not all) of this company’s operations are based on a pyramid scheme,
false and deceptive marketing, etc.; and


2) That regulators will act to shut the company down or at least seriously rein it in.


On these two measures, I have more confidence in this investment now than I did before
his presentation. To put rough numbers on it, before today I thought there was a 90%
chance #1 was true and a 70% #2 would happen, so that’s a 63% chance of this
investment working out. Now I think the odds are 95% and 80%, meaning I think my odds
have improved to 76% -- so I’m perfectly happy to have a 25% larger short position (which
the market took care of today – I didn’t have to do a thing!).


The main reason for my increased confidence is that I think Ackman showed convincingly
that nutrition clubs (which he estimates account for as much as 50% of Herbalife’s U.S.
business and nearly all of its incremental profits) are fundamentally not about genuine
consumption of Herbalife products by people pursuing healthy lifestyles and weight loss
(as the company would have you believe) but almost entirely by:


a) Those pursuing the business opportunity (i.e., building a downline rather than real sales
as, for example, Amway, Tupperware and Pampered Chef); and


b) Their friends and family who are trying to support them.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2331565-why-im-more-confident-of-my-herbalife-short-position-today 2/45


And, critically, the business opportunity is being sold in a false and deceptive way in which
mostly vulnerable, unsophisticated people are promised that if they just work hard and
invest their time and money they are likely to become President’s Club members and earn
$500,000 annually forever. There is, of course, no disclosure whatsoever about how much
time and money the average person invests, the real financial characteristics of the
average nutrition club (almost all lose money), and the likelihood of anyone ever earning
$1 in revenue, much less breaking even, much less earning enough money to make it
worth one’s time, and much less becoming a President’s Club member (approaching 1 in
100,000).


In short, Ackman present voluminous evidence that Herbalife is aggressively selling
millions of people a promise of the American Dream but is instead giving them the
American Nightmare – bleeding them dry and discarding them. This is the very definition
of fraud.


The best analogy I can think of is a slimeball going around targeting people dying of a
terrible illness and promising them that he has the cure – all they have to do is pay him
$3,000, do what he says (or take the “medicine” or “treatment” he gives them), and they’ll
be cured. In fact, scams like this are all too common – see this 60 Minutes expose, for
example, of stem cell fraud. However, these frauds are mostly located overseas because,
of course, they’re illegal here!


To be clear, this is not like Amway, in which a relative of mine, years ago, peddled Amway
products to her friends and family (which we reluctantly bought to support her). She wasn’t
pursuing the business opportunity, but rather, like the vast majority of Amway reps, was
just selling products and making a commission. That’s the difference between legitimate
multi-level marketers and pyramid schemes: are most of the people in it to sell products or
for the business opportunity?


The key thing Ackman showed today is that these nutrition clubs, which the company,
analysts and bulls point to as evidence of legitimate end demand, are really just fronts for
people pursuing the business opportunity and few of the people coming to them are what
any sensible person would view as real customers.


Nor is it like buying a lottery ticket (where people knowingly waste their money in pursuit of
a big payday) because everyone who buys a lottery ticket knows what their odds are
(close to zero). Could you imagine the outcry if the lottery ran ads of lottery winners
saying, “Just pick numbers like I did and you’re certain to strike it rich! (And if you don’t,
you’re a loser.)”

Comments (220)


A final point: I think Ackman today rebutted the primary bull argument (which was the only
lingering doubt I had): that if Herbalife were a pyramid scheme, there would be a ton of
excess inventory in the system and one would see large volumes being sold at distressed
prices on eBay and elsewhere. But now we know why: the majority of the product is
actually being consumed – but not by real consumers, but rather millions of people (and
their unfortunate friends and family) caught up in a vast scam that’s like a cult, with vast
promises, huge rallies, etc.

Man, Whitney...you don't enjoy walking the easy road, do you?


The market has been pounding Ackman regarding (NYSE:HLF) and shorting this stock has been an utter nightmare
for anyone with the stones to try it.


There HAS to be an easier way to make money in the market...


...maybe shorting (NYSE:http://bit.ly/o60xij), (NASDAQ:http://bit.ly/9SVvLk) or (NASDAQ:http://bit.ly/cANO8m)

I have a feeling that Ackman will lose his job if he is wrong over HLF short bet. I think he is right this is the
most important time of his career. Let see what happen.

monkey see
@Whitney. ".. If they just work hard and invest their time and money they are likely to become Presidential
Club Members and earn $500,000 annually forever."


From the monkey see dictionary: likely- probable


Do you have any evidence that Herbalife said this or do you just like to make unsubstantiated assertions?


As to treating HLF like a lottery:"Just pick numbers like I did and you're certain to strike it rich."


Certain- definite, undoubtedly


Again, where is your evidence to support this assertion or do you just like making things up?

The problem with extreme speculative short positions is they can turn on you very quickly. Trader Bruno Iksil,

How much up were investments that Gotham Partners ran b4 they folded?  
And by the way, Ackman lost another $70 million on Tuesday just on his puts, not counting is short position
and not counting the $50 million he spent on this charade and other costs. And of course not counting the
$500 million he lost on JCP and the $700 million he was down on earlier on HLF.


You really want to talk profits and losses regarding Ackman?

Hey Shsssss .. You dont lose or gain until you close or cover. Unrealized figures on paper is nothingness. Be
careful about watching ticks lol


26 Jul 2014, 04:55 PM


6269751
According to Wikipedia, as of 2013, they had $13B under management. If one billion was speculated on HLF
that is 1/13 or 7.7% doing very poorly. We agree PS has had some good years. There are going to be bad
years too. This error with HLF was self-induced, an unforced error. Maybe the other positions cover it by
years end, maybe they don't.


26 Jul 2014, 09:56 PM


6269751
Furthermore let's recall the kind of year 2013 was. Any investor with a pulse, and even the estates of those
without one, made a killing. So a big return in 2013 is no miraculous event. The seeds of Ackman's problems
were sown in 2012 with the start of his Herbalife adventure. Anybody who plays options knows that wild
swings of 10-30% are commonplace. But mere mortals do not wager 7.7% of their portfolio like this. So
regardless of any string of luck, this is not a methodical strategy such as Warren Buffet would espouse. That
is why they say past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The company bought back $700MM in stock in Q2 and more in Q3. That's their playbook - delay being shut
down or sanctioned by the FTC as long as possible, buy as much stock back in the interim as possible with
their illicitly acquired cash flow (which is HUGE) and thus force shorts to cover. Longs cynically believe that
the day of reckoning is far enough off in the future that HLF can manipulate the stock to triple digits before
anything happens and longs can get out beforehand.


22 Jul 2014, 08:51 PM


Blue Ridge Buffettologist, Contributor
...which is why HLF is so dangerous to short - you can be completely correct that it will get closed down
eventually, but it won't matter b/c you will have to cover first.


22 Jul 2014, 08:52 PM


Blue Ridge Buffettologist, Contributor
Sorry, $700MM in Q1 and more in Q2 (and probably Q3).


22 Jul 2014, 08:53 PM


dkostek
"delay being shut down or sanctioned"


Reminds me of Pre-Paid Legal. They used "network marketing" and were branded as a multi level marketing
scheme in Wyoming. They were investigated by the SEC for bad accounting as well as buying back stocks
from executives. They delayed being shut down long enough to be acquired by a private equity firm, and have
since rebranded as LegalShield

dabomb...I like that statement. Makes sense, Icahn doesn't need to counter Ackman's plea, he's smarter and

Actually it was his partner's pick (David Berkowitz), not Ackman's - Gotham was a 2-man operation.


22 Jul 2014, 09:22 PM


6269751
Why is it cynical to believe a day of reckoning is far enough away? The FTC took four years (1975-1979)
suing Amway and Amway is still in business. I think it's logical to believe that significant action is unlikely or
distant, since there is no evidence there will be a sanction forthcoming. But your word sanction is imprecise.
The FTC can issue a ruling criticizing practices of a company. But to do any major damage they would have
to fight a lawsuit. I don't think cynicism is a logical aspect of this situation.

//////////////////////... 
Blue Ridge B. - This is an (extremely ironic) letter written by Bill Ackman to his investors regarding his long
investment in the MLM Pre-Paid Legal. I got this info from the blog by Skeptic21. You'll notice Ackman was
trying to scare the shorts! - "I have to ask how the Shorts sleep at night? As a percentage of shares
outstanding, I believe that the company is one of the most heavily shorted of all companies listed on a U.S.
exchange. The shorts are playing a dangerous game of musical chairs. When the music stops, I believe that
there will be a furious rush to match players with chairs and the price at which the market clears will be
materially higher than it is today. If that were not enough, the game of musical chairs gets more dangerous
with each passing week. I estimate that the company currently generates millions of free cash flow a week
and uses that cash to retire shares. At the current share price, the company is able to remove millions of
shares annually."

Prepaid Legal was structured similar to Herbalife with only 25% Distributors Recruiting . The Accusation on
Prepaid was of Misrepresenting the Business Opportunity ie Similar to what Ackman is Accusing Herbalife of
.But he was Long Prepaid and Now he is Short Herbalife .


Anyways, after watching Ackmans Presentation yesterday , it is Easy to See he is not a Person of Gravitas.


23 Jul 2014, 09:43 AM

Prepaid actually faced civil suits on those complaints in multiple state courts and won virtually all of the time,
as I recall.


It was great trading PPD from the long side every time the shorts got their panties in a bunch about it.


The other thing that was really similar was that there were large equity owners who were running the
company. For HLF, that role is being played by Icahn.

Just HLF .The Rest of the Anti MLM Brigade , is using this opportunity to rail against MLM in general .They

27 Jul 2014, 04:17 PM


Nate Acreman
Yeah, if you say so. I think that most if not all of your short bet is based on false or misleading information. I also
highly doubt that you are at all that confident in your Herbalife short if you were, you wouldn't feel the need to go on
the internet in broadcast it. After all short positions don't require anyone else to join with you, you are either right or
you aren't in your thesis the stock falls to your goal point and then you sell. No, you are writing this because you aren't
sure about your short and you need to continuously add your two cents to the discussion because you feel that if you
don't or you don't do it enough, nothing will happen to Herbalife. The same goes to Rogier, QTR, and Matt Stewart.
You can tell us you believe in your short thesis, but to tell us you are confident is inaccurate.

I have to hand it to you and others that feel that way. You've made a religious experience out of trying to end a multi
billion dollar corporation based on a feeling. Personally I think you ought to move on although I hope Ackman burns to
the ground because his Karma is so bad that he deserves it. Matt's job with Ackman, doing what he can to destroy
HLF will be over . It's probably a good job if you can get it but if this stock keeps going up, and I think it will, the gig is
up. There are far many more companies out there doing far more shady things than a health food company that does
business in a way that you and a handful of others don't approve. Time to move on. I don't even own HLF anymore
because of all the insanity that Ackman has created.

HLF is not going to sue Ackman. They could likely prove he is full of BS, but what are the damages? Every
time Ackman presents his BS, HLF stock goes up. More likely HLF will wait for the FTC to give them a stamp
of approval, then lobby the SEC to investigate Ackman's tactics. I would say it is far more likely that we'll get
some new regs concerning short-selling and lame-o, unsubstantiated public attacks than it is we'll get new
regs having anything to do with MLMs.


23 Jul 2014, 03:17 PM


Manxbuilder
Because in the real world, something that you bashers are unaware of, there is no real tangible evidence that
HLF is doing anything that will get them in trouble. This is nothing more than a witch hunt by Ackman and he's
a known nut case. Do you even listen to his last presentation? He comes across as an idiot. At this point he

The discrepancy with inventory loading and traffic at nutrition clubs has been resolved by today's presentation. We
can now reconcile the whole business model and connect all the dots. I only wish Ackman could organize his content
a little better. I feel he should have started at the middle of the presentation right off the bat, without repeating content
he already presented, because he set himself up with high expectations the day before.


No matter, once the information settles and emotions fade off a bit, the pyramid emerges even more clearly. If all this
info isn't enough for the FTC, in addition to the profiles of numerous distributors already online, I don't know what else
can be done outside of a high level exec coming out and turning against the company.

Well said.

Really? So you must have answers to these questions:


1) What % of product is sold in nutrition clubs? 
2) Of that %, what % is sold in nutrition clubs that are part of the Club 100 program that Ackman discussed? 
3) Of that %, what % is in the US, not in Columbiia and Venezuela and other geographies that may or may
not have laws governing this stuff? 
4) Other than Ackman's "estimate" that he gave without any document or any data or any substantiation at all,
what basis is there for any of this amounting to a significant % of HLF's sales? I estimate that the % of HLF
sales that are done through Club 100 nutrition clubs to be less than 5%. See how easy it is to pull a number
out of one's arse? Refute it.


23 Jul 2014, 09:30 AM


eekonomist
1) Ackman estimates close to 50%. I'm sure you don't buy that, so let's use HLFs 2012 number. Around 34% I
believe. Pretty significant.


2) Good question. But keep this in mind. In HLFs own internal documents, they state that 9 out 10 clubs not
using the Club 100 program fail. Hmm...


3) I believe there are about 4000 in the US and 17000 (!!) in Mexico. It definitely skews international.
Remember, this program is designed to fish the bottom of the barrel income levels that can only afford to pay
for one shake at a time. That may be a problem from a legal perspective for the FTC, but a fraud here will
eventually become a fraud everywhere.


4) I think the estimate is based on 2 years of investigative research. Their arses are a bit more informed than
yours.

1-4. Sow me data. After 2 years of investigative research, why is there no substantiation? 3-hour
presentation, and no data on these important questions? $50 million in research, and no data, no
substantiation, and all he has (and you have) is an estimate he pulled out of his arse, and some assumption
that his arse is somehow better to pull stuff out of than EVERYONE else's?


Hey, it's your money -- I guess you gotta hae faith in something....

Time to Buy more, I got to give Bill Ackman credit he has "balls of steel" Wow a squeeze today. Good lucking shorting
this stock, I believe the short will lose big, once the investigation is done and HLF is clear of fraud. Trading this stock
is like trading Fuel Cell company you must have a strong stomach.

I tried to add to my short yesterday morning but the brokerage had no shares to short. At 2:30pm they had
short inventory, so I think a lot of shorts already covered.

Like most pops this one will start fading on Weds. 27 million shares traded is 7 times normal volume and can
only be described as traders trying to make a very short term profit; somewhat like IPOs that fade in following
days.


NUS is getting hammered in China and it, USNA, and HLF seem to be converging toward a similar stock
price in the late $60s. The MLMs may think, falsely, that the regulating agencies will not act, and investors
may, rightly, assume that there is money to make for now.


22 Jul 2014, 11:26 PM


jernigc
It is going to take a lot more then one day even at yesterday's volume to cover the short sales outstanding.
Had you watches the rebuttal to the long, but vacuous, presentation you would understand that the shorts will
and are being handed their asses. HLF will hit its 85.50 price target within a month.

There's nothing wrong with making a short term profit. I had bought $HLF early back in 2012 and made a
short term profit. I forgot all about the company until March 2014. I said hmm - what is the reason for this
sudden drop in share price? That's when I got back in - it was thanks to Bill Ackman. It's been a bit of a
rollercoaster but it was worth it for yesterday's big thrill.

As Ackman said today, it is a confidence game. The PR machine is their shield. What do the execs really do on a day
to day basis at the firm? When you strip down the business model, it is clear that the victims are doing the work for
them, bringing in enormous cash-flow. It is eye opening when you think about it. The real work at HQ is based purely
on taking this cash flow, and dropping it into the pockets of the California AG & other powerful people to keep the
status quo. It is just a matter of time, with Ackman prodding and pushing buttons, until the vast amount of people
under payroll realize that the money is not worth the potential trouble brewing.

I think authorities will eventually catch up to them, though. They're not stupid, just a little slow. Look what's

Blue Ridge Buffettologist, Contributor
Funny how people in the media always assume that a 1-day stock price move is somehow a "verdict" on an event,
that Herbalife somehow has "defeated Ackman", and that this is now set in stone, never to be revisited. That's why
reporters would make terrible investors, b/c they don't know the basics of investing (short term, voting machine, long
term, weighing machine). 99% of the attention gets focused on something completely ephemeral and basically
irrelevant (what is the stock price doing RIGHT NOW???) and only 1% of the attention gets paid to what actually
matters in the long run (the facts and the reasoning of the person making the presentation).  
Typical, but 100% laughable - that's why only complete morons listen to CNBC or read Business Insider for
investment advice...


22 Jul 2014, 08:15 PM


6269751
Buffet makes his calculations and keeps his mouth shut while waiting for the result. The "facts and the
reasoning of the person making the presentation" is what investors did focus on. They saw Chicken Little
running around since 2012 saying the Herbalife is falling. I wouldn't buy Herbalife thinking it's going to be
another IBM. But I would buy Herbalife in March and thanks to today's verdict, average 1.67 percent increase
per month. I think Warren Buffet would agree that's a decent gain.


22 Jul 2014, 08:53 PM


6269751
Furthermore in many cases I would have cashed out today if I felt a stock just had a lucky break and there
were causes for concern in the normal financial sense. I haven't heard one single solitary metric argument
from the Ackmanites that gives me pause. I'm not an expert I admit but the normal financial metrics I use for
my portfolio show no undue risk.


22 Jul 2014, 09:05 PM


Blue Ridge Buffettologist, Contributor
It's not about "financial metrics" - HLF's metrics are absurdly good. Unfortunately, the company does not
operate a legal business, plain and simple. Just like Madoff.


22 Jul 2014, 09:14 PM


blah01
To that point, Enron's, AIG's, and even GS's metrics and superficial fundamentals were great as well. After
delving into that actual filings did a person see the SIVs and the CDSs without appropriate provisions.

good luck. conviction is generally a function of either/or data gathering or stock performance. most believe data
gathering and ability to trade the stock is perfectly correlated, yet it is not, it is moreso asymptotic, as information
creates emotional walls, preventing one from making rational decisions. making money on a short is tough, trying to
take a company down and make money that way is not impossible, but highly unlikely, as you have thousands of
people working extremely hard against you... and HLF has deep pockets.


22 Jul 2014, 08:17 PM


provotrout
Purdy much agree. Nearly every respected trader I follow was bashing Ackman in some way today on twitter. I just
can't yet agree it's a self fulfilling trade. Cramer's insistent that anyone with money can ruin a company, yet he doesn't
cite much in the way of otherwise legitimate companies that have been brought down simply by shorts. And today's
price action is reasonable given the dynamic of yesterday's big selloff and setup for a technical squeeze momentum
play.


Very little commentary on Ackman's points on ethics and sustainability among the anti-Ackman crowd.


22 Jul 2014, 08:18 PM


Blue Ridge Buffettologist, Contributor
"anyone with money can ruin a company"


That idea is completely absurd - Cramer should be ashamed of himself. How many millions have HLF spent
attacking the messenger (Ackman)? They have WAY more $ at their disposal than Ackman does - as of the
end of the last Q, I believe they had ~$1,200,000,000 in cash on hand. And if it weren't for guys like Ackman,
this pathetic scam of a company would continue on for years. Thank God somebody finally stood up for all the
people that HLF constantly rips off who can't do anything about it themselves.

It is interesting to me that you use the phrase "vast scam that's like a cult, with vast promises and huge rallies" in the
same paragraph with Ackman's name in it. Certainly a promise to his shareholders that "Herbalife will go to zero"
qualifies as a vast promise in anyone's book. Certainly the media circus Ackman is able to conjure up every quarter, a
week before earnings reports, constitutes a "huge rally".

None of what Ackman's dummy presentation is accurate. if its not accurate then can't proceeds Im 100% sure?
Because I have been operating my own NC and applying High standards with a lot of success in my community I
have made a huge impact in so many people changing bad "habits" and becoming healthier. The socializing is so
great that I have met whole Families and making new friends. If you would experience that you would feel so great full
to have the opportunity in doing this. Herbalife's mission is for those who really work Hard and have the desire to do
the best for a better and healthier community. 
Ackman's got irritated on his presentation. because some people stand up and left after an Hour and he said "They
must be Herbalife distributors" , He also stated that the FTC is doing his work slowly. ( because he knows time is
running out for him so he would need to start covering his position soon if stocks will continue rising which they will.
and he also called Michael O Johnson a Predator and a Criminal. at the end of his presentation a sign that H e is
losing control

ProTruth
I disagree with Mr. Tilson on Amway. MLM is not normal world business, they all use slight variations on the same
troubling tactics. They not only do financial damage to participants, but they have a social cost, and can literally
destroy families and relationships.


Tupperware, Pampered Chef, the "Party Plan" companies may be okay, but are distinct from MLM, note Tupperware
has distanced itself from the DSA/MLM for good reason. See the article here on SA re Avon and MLM for more insight
on that company.


The whole industry is an aggressive cancer on our country (and now the world). Look what fighting just one of them it
is doing to someone with as much money and clout as Ackman. It is insidious, toxic, and fundamentally incompatible
with democratic ideals of full disclosure and freedom of mind. Ackman was absolutely right to compare it to totalist
groups. It fully falls on that spectrum. The True Believer by Eric Hoffer is a classic book that explains the phenomena.
Orwell understood it. It is too difficult for people to grasp easily, unfortunately, sometimes it becomes too late, and only
after great social damage has been done is there widespread understanding of what has been going on.


22 Jul 2014, 08:38 PM


trader57
Back about 30 years ago, I was involved in a MLM business. There was no investment; it was not a pyramid
scheme; I didn't lose any money. I just bought some products from my upline that I would have bought in the
grocery store at similar prices. But the problem was simply that it was a very difficult business, because most
people have no interest in part-time business opportunities and those that do have such an interest have
often already joined an MLM group. So I quit after about a year. I did read some excellent books
(recommended by my MLM group) that have helped me in business since then.


I don't know anyone working in a Herbalife business and I can't comment on Herbalife. But that was my
experience with MLM back in the 1980s. I didn't lose any money; I didn't buy anything I didn't need. I just
wasted some time with it, but it did point me toward some excellent books that have helped me in business.

Ultimately, what makes an illegal pyramid scheme different from a multilevel marketing system is the mode
through which people are compensated: through recruitment or sales. In a pyramid scheme, money is made
through recruitment, at which point new salespeople are typically required to buy products that might be
difficult to sell outside the network. Now which of these criterias fit HLF?


23 Jul 2014, 10:07 AM

when a recruit sells HLF merchandise.

Ackman was crying at the end of the big show. Carl was right. Crybaby in the schoolyard. His options will expire out of
the money and his investors will flee. He was on a short leash after losing big on the short position. Now the option
trade will be a total loss whether HLF is a pyramid or not.

I must be a total pussy because i shed a tear when Ackman did :_; Keep in mind that this is a very small
portion of the portfolio, and the money lost, even if he loses everything is hardly significant. He is not
motivated by money at this point. If he was really in it for the money he would buy the stock like all the other
scumbags that perpetuate this fraud.

Bullseye! I would tend to disagree re Amway. There's a reason they settled a $150 million dollar lawsuit in lieu of
fighting off a claim that they are in fact a pyramid scheme, but at least your relative was trying to sell product.


Poignant little detail that NONE of the supposed "analysts" who rate the HLF stock, ever called Pershing Square in all
this time.


22 Jul 2014, 08:48 PM


alexalekhine
here is a really ridiculous comment.


So let's get this straight.


The government had evidence that Amway was an illegal pyramid scheme but they accepted a $150 million
fine and let them just continue on their merry way.


Meanwhile, Arthur Anderson, the accounting firm thta aided and abetted Enron, fold up like a cheap tent
within hours of having a criminal charge brought against it. Not a conviction, mind you. Just a charge filed.


People who think HLF is going zero are deluded.

You poor deluded fools. Did you not recognize the extremely distinct sound of the bottom of a barrel being scraped?
Ackman's pathetic resort to purported protection of "poor people" buttressed with obviously contrived , and therefore,
crocodile tears, shows not only how desperate he is but how low he will sink.  
Perhaps this self-appointed guardian of the indigent will turn his attention next to State lotteries which promote
prospects of untold wealth unashamedly to the their most fertille prospects, i.e the very same poor people who,
statistics show, spend ridiculously disproportionate amounts on such futile schemes. 
At least with HLF and similar LEGAL enterprises a goodly number of people actually make money and improve their
standard of living. But you never get to hear about them...... 
Whether or not the products are are of the quality, or provide the benefits, touted is an entirely separate legal issue
and you are being hoodwinked if you are buying into the propaganda that this will mean that HLF will be forced to
wind up solely because of this. There is a wealth of medical opinion that taking daily mutivitamin supplements (a multi

actually harmful to your health ( as is the case with HLF products) people are allowed to make up their own minds on
an individual basis whether to buy into the hype or not. Which is as it should be. 
I base my actions on highly qualified legal experts who, in common with the Canadian authorities, opine that
Ackman's theories are groundless.As I see it he is nothing more than a chancer who is demonstrably becoming more
unhinged as each day progresses. If you are an Ackman accolyte who is throwing good money to this cause, good

"Perhaps this self-appointed guardian of the indigent will turn his attention next to State lotteries which

I agree with you. State and multistate lotteries are far more detrimental and insidious to those least able to
afford it.


It's ironic when people try to claim the moral high road by trying to crush a company, bankrupt the
stockholders, and put every successful retailer of the product out of business...

Herbalife has been a very successful pyramid scheme for a couple decades, pinpointing its future demise is tricky.
Perhaps Mr. Ackerman should attack the scheme at the state level, say Illinois, which has the strictest business
opportunity and franchise enforcement law in the country.

Here's a comment someone left in 2012 on the first WSJ article that disclosed when you shorted HLF
(http://bit.ly/1lsDAQ8):


"Enter Whitney Tilson, the self involved, self promotional and congratulatory talentless hack that follows every single
major investor into their investments and then appears on television to make the idea sound like his own. Tilson’s
awful track record, endless hours of conference hosting and blog writing versus actual research, and lack of creativity
or original thought are actually great counter indicators that HLF may actually survive and prove Ackman wrong. At
least Ackman does some work and comes up with an idea. Whitney is always the empty suit."


It's been close to 2 years since that comment and HLF is up about 150% since then. What do you think?


22 Jul 2014, 08:56 PM


Forensic Intelligence Group
I don't like Herbalife or their product. However, it seems that a collapse will have to be induced by a government
agency since their profit growth seems to be on the uptrend. In other words, you better be sure its a fraud/Ponzi. If
HLF continues to be profitable the market will stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.


22 Jul 2014, 08:56 PM


Akmanscam
I wouldn't be short at this point. HLF has earnings coming on 7/28 and is still way oversold. The pop today was just a
slight recovery. Also Chapman has placed a target price of $150 for HLF within the year and $300 within 2 years. Last
time Chapman was this bullish HLF soared from $23 to over $80.


Also, Ackman clearly has no clue on what he is talking about. Chapman called him a "Reincarnation of PT Barnum"
Ackman is a showboater and always over promises and underlivers. Regarding HLF, clearly he has NOT done his
homework and is ooooh so wrong.


If you stay short, keep your stops tight and I hope you have enough cash set aside to pay for your margin calls. Not a
good time to be short, but it is your money and not mine.

One of the real questions is why Mr. Ackman is so hard over on ending Herbalife. Did he have some relatives lose big
money in the company? It seems like he's lost his reason as an investor on this matter. Now if it turns out that he just
got a ton of long options right before his presentation I could continue to respect his intelligence. This long trade today
was as close to a no brainer as it gets. It will be one of my biggest days of the year. And for him it was an absolute no
brainer since he knew the content of the presentation. (Hey, it's probably legal if not moral.) 
The other thing I don't get is his lack of understanding of federal regulators. Everyone seems to have missed this
point. Unless something closer to a smoking gun is found he's actually made it harder for them to shut down
Herbalife, and he's put himself in their viewfinder. Does he really think they like being told they're not doing their jobs,
or how to do their jobs. He's reached the point where he has to start putting pressure on them through Congress.
Maybe a lot more than he's already tried. I give it 50/50 that the next investigation started in the Herbalife saga will be
on him.

If you take either side on this one you're on the wrong side. Ackman knows what he's doing and the Herbalife

Some Russians are nice people. It is not the ethnicity, it is the person and perhaps his upbringing. I have no

Dear Whit:


The problem is not the messenger in and of itself: It is his message, and the market has said he's wrong and stop
crying wolf you cry baby! Have fun taking a ride against this one because you like Ackman are dead wrong; Plain and
simple. If I was 90% convinced Ackman was full of self-aggrandizing hot air, I'm now 99% convinced.


Herbalife products and sales methods are not like selling cancer stricken victims phony cures as you egregiously
suggest. Selling fake cures to cancer victims would be like selling fake cures to cancer victims, and Herbalife sells
nutritional products through a direct sales MLM model that has the ability to impact people's nutritional well-being
positively while putting a little extra money in their pockets if they believe in the product and want to sell it. These
people can't even fathom a world like you and Mr. Ackman as thousands of dollar a year may be impactful to them.
They didn't go to Harvard, and they are looking to make an honest living selling something that is healthy!!!!


Ackman's style is to run into a movie theater and yell "fire" so he can get the front row seats. He hasn't waged a war
on Herbalife because he's a consumer advocate, but rather he though he could win this on technical points in the law
he clearly didn't perform solid due diligence on. He's smart and a pompous d-bag to boot, but he's playing his hands

face up and bluffing: That's why I bought more shares and options yesterday. I bought them because he reveals his
desperation with every "event" he sets up around earnings where he sets up this huge act and thinks that the mortals
who listen to his sweet voice will be so wooed by it's sound that he won't have to bother putting down any substance
to the words. He's wrong in principal and in fact - as are you, sir. I'll be happy to sell you my shares over $120, Whit.
As you note, good thing you run a short diversified book as Ackman only invests in 10 stocks at a time.


22 Jul 2014, 09:10 PM


Bystander from Canada
Ackman's research/presentation helped shed some light on how herbalife has built a legal, self-perpetuating machine
that prints money, even if they stumbled onto it by accident.


The marketplace had an "aha" moment, then ran out to buy the stock, bumping it up 25%.


If herbalife has anything to be cranky about, it's that their unique model is now common knowledge, which will draw in
competitors.


Selling single-serve shakes to family, friends and neighbours is simply brilliant and keeps the company on the right
side of the law.


Who cares if there is no signage on the windows of these nutrition clubs, etc., it just means they are ugly and non-
descript, it doesn't mean the company is a pyramid scheme.


Ackman admits to not truly understanding how Herbalife operates and must now try to make people think that nutrition
clubs selling single-serve portions means the same thing as operating a pyramid.


Ackman is toast.


22 Jul 2014, 09:11 PM


Blue Ridge Buffettologist, Contributor
"Ackman admits to not truly understanding how Herbalife operates"


No he doesn't.


22 Jul 2014, 09:44 PM


Bystander from Canada
In his presentation, Ackman admitted to not understanding the "nutrition club" element of the business when
he originally shorted the stock and it's impact on company sales.


He went on to add that if you remove the nutrition clubs, then herbalife will collapse, which may be the reason
he is now attacking the nutrition clubs.


If you wish, I will find the time-code in the presentation where he says this.

He said he didn't understand why people would go to a nutrition club to buy an overpriced weight loss shake.
Now, having done the research, it's obvious - nobody goes there for a shake, they go their to participate in the
"business opportunity". Nutrition clubs are just recruitment venues. He never said he didn't understand "how
Herbalife operates" - you were 100% wrong (intentionally or not) when you said that.


22 Jul 2014, 10:08 PM


Bystander from Canada
He said that as well, but he also said that NOW he understands the company better after having amassed
research on the nutrition clubs.


That "research" took place AFTER he shorted the stock, so he did NOT understand Herbalife's business
when he made his billion dollar bet.


Ackman accuses ichan et al of failing to conduct thorough research. I suppose it takes one to know one.


I tried to find the time code to share with you but the website isn't loading. (Or maybe Ackman removed it so
he would stop showing the world how herbalife has over 50% retails sales)


If I can get the time code, I will post it here.


22 Jul 2014, 11:03 PM


alexalekhine
The ironic part of this is that the nutrition clubs are essentially retail establishments yet Ackman started
shorting this company because he objected to it being a multi-level marketing enterprise.


Ackman is likely still short a significant number of shares.  
His put premium value is shrinking rapidly. Since his put options are not publicly traded (to my knowledge they
all were done in private transactions), he has no real way out of them.


He is trapped like a frog in a pot of water that is quickly heating up.


The heat will take a big step high on Monday when the company is likely to (again) crush estimates and raise
guidance.

Not only does the gov't have limited scope and a million ways to look at this and come up with nothing for $50

Can you explain why the PPS rose 25% today? Did the other whales come in to counterattack?  
I have read a lot of articles but no one has explained why clearly!


I have no idea whether this is a pyramid or what not scheme, but what I do know is that this is one of the most volatile
stocks out there, which is why today at the opening I bought both $55C and $50P expiring this week - I liquidated 15
minutes before Mk't close and made ~$700 per operation.


Why bet on one or the other side when you can bet on both? 
Not a recommendation for anyone by any means, just what volatility is capable of achieving!

It was up 25% today b/c (1) it was down big yesterday in anticipation of Ackman's presentation, (2) Ackman's

The author says:  
"But now we know why: the majority of the product is actually being consumed – but not by real consumers, but rather
millions of people (and their unfortunate friends and family) caught up in a vast scam that’s like a cult, with vast
promises, huge rallies, etc."


---- 
So now that there is established knowledge that a majority of the product IS being consumed by arms-length third-
parties, (albeit at single-serve low cost portions) your new argument is that those transactions don't count because
you don't like the product being sold that way? Why do you care?


Ackman did herbalife a huge service today: he explained to the marketplace and the regulators how the product is
being legally sold to retail end users. 1 GLASS AT A TIME!


The market place was able to validate 2 important things. First, that herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme
because it sells a majority of its product at the retail level, and second, that now it makes sense how the company

continues to produce chart-busting revenue performance. So the marketplace responded in kind by purchasing
Herbalife at a frenetic pace, driving its stock up to a record 1-day gain.


Basically, Ackman has spent $50 million to help educate investors and regulators on how the company sells a
majority of its product at the retail level.

Product purchased by the warm market of hopeful distributors is retail sales, no one cares why they purchase as long
as they do. Requiring 10 customers per distributor in the nutrition club plan is a way to insulate Herbalife from charges
of inventory loading and excessive internal consumption. It's deeply clever and profitable. Ethical? Hell no in my
opinion, but since when has Wall Street cared at all about that? Unless the FTC does something about the bis opp,
this ingenious method of squeezing blood out of the stone will continue indefinitely. Screwing the poor is the American
way.

"And, critically, the business opportunity is being sold in a false and deceptive way in which mostly vulnerable,
unsophisticated people are promised that if they just work hard and invest their time and money they are likely to
become President’s Club members and earn $500,000 annually forever."


This is really a VERY condescending statement and attitude.  
I realize we cannot all be geniuses such as "star" hedge fund managers like you and Bill, but 
Just how STUPID do you think average people really are? Do you SERIOUSLY think that every "recruit" thinks they
are going to make $500,000 a year selling a diet shake? 
How well do you think those same people would do selling computers for IBM? 
The main difference is IBM would never give them the time of day, but Herbalife gives them the opportunity to prove
to themselves what they are capable of and how far they can go. 
I heard more or less the same "spiel" from an Amway distributor in the 1970s when I was straight out of college. The
"recruiting" included a church style recruiting meeting as well as a visit on the guys "yacht" at a yacht club in the
Potomac in DC. (I guess it just seemed like a yacht to a young kid back then, but it was under 30 feet and just a
"boat.")


Do you think I believed what I was told? Do you think people today are THAT stupid?

Ackman became a lame duck the moment he said the reason he didn't purchase herbalife stock in order to have is 40
pages of questions answered was that it was "too risky"


Uh huh....so spend $50 million trying to take down the company but don't spend 6 thousand dollars on a hundred
shares to get your questions answered, which he presumably wanted in order to buttress his case.


That tells me 2 things: 1, that he is trying to send a message not to buy the stock by saying it is too risky so his short
doesn't go further under water, and 2, that if he directly owned stock then he could be guilty of market manipulation.

Come on folks whether they have actual customers here or there they are targeting poor people. It is on their own
internal strategy document. Why Ackman spent 50 million for that that I don't know. Hopefully someone will be able to
force HLF to give up the clubs if they wish to continue operating or force them to include clear warnings. I wouldn't
shut them down outright but I would not let them continue as is. There probably is a legal pathway to obtain such an
outcome, though the international component will complicate the matter. Why Carl got involved in this is beyond me.
An irrational decision in my view.

Yes, I have read these kind of silly arguments. The problem is here you are selling fraudulent claims, not a
product. McDonalds sells a product some people want.Even tobacco companies sell a product people want.
You actually make my point for me. If HLF wants to sell the product to the poor or anyone else there is no
problem with that. Get rid of the clubs and open a store.


This is all rather elementary. Please explain to me the benefit of the clubs to the company in any legit way. If
they want to prove that they are a normal company why wouldn't they get rid of them?


The reason is because their business model is not about selling the product, the growth part anyway. But hey
if they find a way to grow without them then that's fine. Let them try.

David Pinsen, Marketplace Contributor
Protein shakes are fraudulent products? They are a way to lose the weight one gains eating McDonald's
burgers. Of course, you can get protein shakes from stores too; the Herbalife difference, as John Hempton
has pointed out, is the community support of the clubs. It's easier to stick with a diet with community support.

I have not seen a compelling short as this one. The senseless squeeze yesterday assuredly is not about conviction
longs but typical short covering blip. As a trader one thing i know is that HLF with regulatory risk and tremendous
controversies would not attract conviction longs over the mid to long term. I doubled my short yday at $67 bringing my
cost basis to $63. I have no doubt this stock gets to below $40 soon. It is not about Ackman ..it is about business
model and myriads of risks. We are in the business of managing risks not debating about moral rights or wrongs

They actually let you run a fund with those analytical skills?


Most business owners in MLMs fail or don't make money but so are most business opportunities in general. Just
because you are pitched a dream doesn't mean you actually can achieve it. Plenty of people dream of opening their
own bake shop or flower shop or coffee shop but find that overhead, commoditised products, lack of marketing, etc.
doom their investment. That's capitalism. And just people minority business owners fail doesn't mean it's unfairly
targeting them. Guess what? White people fail in business too.


Most guys start hedge funds with dreams of being like Ackman...but most hedge funds don't beat a S&^P500 kind of
return and end up not raising a next funds or fail. Does that make the entire industry a scam?

dont assume they dont know the odds of the the lottery ticket they are buying. They do!! It is very uninformed of
Ackman to not not understand that there are complex dynamics that cause someone to swallow the nutrition club bait.
The actions by several agencies are uncertain , unlikely and at best years away will surely outlive his puts. The only
thing that will trade near term is positions and thats a short squeeze !!

Investment Pancake, Contributor
The HLF saga seems to be a great case in point why shorting stocks is more of a gamble than an investment. You
have a risk/ reward proposition of 100% upside and infinite downside, which doesn't look so great from a math
standpoint, coupled with the opportunity cost - why not just invest in some good companies that sell good products
and services, pay a good dividend, trade at a reasonable price and have decent earnings growth? Granted, you might
only make 6% a year, but when you're already rich (I have to assume the author is), you don't NEED more than 6% a
year. It's not rational to take the risk of an infinite loss when you're already in a position to retire in style. My
unsolicited advice to the author - forget all the rocket science and splashy news stories about splashy trades, just
invest in boring old companies, collect your 6% return and be happy, and keep your hard-earned money.

Being correct is not always the same thing as making money, and nowhere is this more true than short positions.
Conviction is fine, however not feeling pain when a short blows up 25% is in my mind is not a wonderful quality.


With regards to Amway, I suggest you ask your relative how much they ended up spending on self help tapes,
seminars, conferences, etc. The economics of the Amway scheme now revolve around what they call "tools".
Basically the big wigs use their Amway pyramid to sell expensive self-help products to the struggling distributors,
which is where the real profit to the scheme now resides.


The entire industry that relies on commission only sales is by and large extremely misleading to new recruits, never
mind highly misleading lottery commercials (such as the "just imagine" themed ones). In that regard HLF and MLM in
general are not unique. Much of the industry is based on capturing the "Natural market" and churning through
"opportunity seekers." The friends and family who buy product just to "help out".


With regards to MLM it is true that these businesses mostly are silly and don't work out for the vast majority, but in the
end no one cares. This fact is counterbalanced against the folks who do successfully use the underlying products to
lose substantial weight. There is an obesity crisis among low income people in this country, if they all had an HLF
shake instead of a bag of potato chips and a big mack for lunch, perhaps that would be progress.


The group-based, or cult-like atmosphere of an MLM might indeed be an effective social element to the product that
makes it more effective. It has been found social networks and peer pressure are effective tools for change such as
weight loss.

If HLF is truly a fraud, at some point people (distributors or end consumers) will stop buying. At that point, HLF falls on
its own. The huge show Ackman is putting on makes him appear desperate. If he believes he is right so strongly, he
should double down and just sit back and wait for the sales to collapse, which will lead to a stock collapse.


23 Jul 2014, 12:47 PM


Investment Pancake, Contributor
I doubt he has time to wait - one year put options comprise the bulk of his position I understand. Those puts
are getting less and less valuable every day - regardless of where HLF stock trades.


Ackman could be completely correct about HLF, and still take a $1b loss. The problem with his investment
technique is that requires him to not only be correct, but to be correct within a relatively short time period.


Odd observation - wonder why people who play the short side of the market are always going on about how
"confident" they are in their positions? Maybe it's because they are appropriately nervous and trying to talk
themselves out of running for the hills? How can you be "confident" that a particular outcome will happen at a
particular moment in time if you don't own a time machine? You can't, and thinking that you can is, well, it's
delusional. Irrational behavior (including but not limited to behavior based on delusions and fantasies of
personal grandeur and ability) more often than not causes investors to take large and permanent losses of
capital.


If you asked me, any time an asset manager ever says the words "_________ is a sure thing" or "we're
confident that _________", you should walk slowly out the door and keep your hand firmly on your wallet.

23 Jul 2014, 09:09 PM


Microcap Growth Investor, Contributor
Ackman made a few decent points, BUT, its exceedingly difficult to "prove" that its truly a pyramid scheme. Other very
smart investors like John Hempton of Bronte Capital AND Bill Stiritz who runs Post Cereals have also done their field
research (including Hempton at the HLF Nutrition clubs) and have arrived at opposite conclusions. I would put Bill
Stiritz investing track record in this space of nutritionals and food items against Titney and Ackman any day of the
week and twice on Sunday. Bill has invested a ton of his own capital in HLF, (not other peoples money like Ackman
and Tilson do).


So now Whitney has concluded that there is a 76% chance HLF is going to zero? Is anyone qualified to put an exact
probability on an outcome that is truly unknowable? That certitude has led to their overconfidence all along... Three
days ago Ackman was about to deliver "the most important presentation of his life" and as Tilson PREDICTED, it
would be the final nail in the coffin for HLF, yet it rebounded 25% that day. hmmm, Ivory tower analysis just doesn't
work.


I do agree, they are selling a questionable weight loss shake, but its just a shake, for pete's sake - hard to see the
government closing down a nutrition company that sells shakes - there are literally DOZENS of MLM companies that
sell weight loss / nutritional items using similar tactics where new recruits have to INVEST a large sum into product to
get going - , but the government isn't sanctioning them. Yes, people will continue to buy the shakes, whether they
work or not.


Have you read the latest research on vitamins, that they don't work. Google vitamins don't work and many scientific
articles will come up that have drawn that conclusion. But, people still spend $Billions of $ every year on vitamins and
Vitacost, (NASDAQ:VITC) just got acquired for a hefty sum. Like vitamins, HLF is selling hope, and people will always
spend a little money on "hope".


Ackman would have far more credibility of he didn't have dog in the fight (i.e. no short position) and made the
presentation as a true public service message warning potential distributors and consumers of HLF's unsavory
tactics. What can he do for an encore now, nobody's going to care if he has anything further to add on this topic, he's
pretty much lost all credibility - imho. Notice, the true professionals that short companies, like Chanos, go after Frauds
based on accounting manipulations and irregularities. Thats one area that HLF appears to be rock solid. if Ackman
turns up something on HLF's accounting, then he has a legitimate avenue to get the company sanctioned.


The truth is that there are plenty of tiny micro cap companies that have very questionable business models and
accounting procedures, that would warrant the time of the SEC, but they don't have the resources. HLF will live on to
fight another day, and as long as they can produce the quarterly results and buyback shares, the stock is going
higher, with a 76% probability! ;)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2331565-why-im-more-confident-of-my-herbalife-short-position-today 43/45


However, with all due respect and without wanting to quibble, I am not sure that you have accurately translated your
odds of either 1 or 2 happening with the actual odds of a breakdown of value for Herbalife stock value. Please let me
make my argument:


If I understand your logic you are saying that if either 1 or 2 happens, that there will be a substantial failure and
significant loss of value. Therefore, in order for the value of Herbalife to remain close to where it is, both 1 AND 2
must be false. That is, if 1 AND 2 are true, then the company will experience significant failure, but also if 1 OR 2 are
true, that will also happen.


Therefore, to use your logic and percentages, the chance of the company escaping unscathed are the probabilities
that both 1 and 2 remain false, which would represent the product of the probabilities of being false, to wit"


Probability of #1 being false = 100% minus probability of being true = 100 - 90% = 10% or 0.1


Probability of #2 being false = 100% - 70% = 30% or 0.3


Probability of Herbalilfe remaining close to its current value = 0.1 x 0.3 = 0.03 or 3%


What is ignored with your simple model is that your logic is an AND logic, requiring both 1 and 2 to be false, with any
other combination of true and false answers resulting in a significant failure.


The odds of failure will now be adjusted with your later estimates to 0.005 x 0.2 or 0.001 or 0.1%. This can be
qualitatively described by professional gamblers as the proverbial "snowballs chance in hell", using your logic and
your model.


I don't mean to pick and I enjoyed the article very much, as I value your other contributions. I just thought that this
might make your simple model a bit clearer to your readers.....Owl


P.S.: If another reader pointed this out in the comments above, I apologize for the redundant comment.

Why is this any different than Costco? You are forced to pay a fee to get the opportunity to buy an unusable amount of
product at not so great price. Who knows were the product goes. Is it resold? Is it consumed? Does it get discarded
after the expiration date is met? So why not go after them too. That leads us to many other companies that do the
same thing. If you don't like their type of business model then don't buy the stock. Starting a war with them like
Ackman has makes you look insane.

Dear Mr. Tilson,


It is certainly possible you are right and that Soros, Ichan, Stiritz, Perry, Fidelity, Vanguard and Blackrock are wrong
but I don't think it's likely.


Do you really think thatyou are right or are you just sticking up for your friend Mr. Ackman?

It seems like the prudent thing to do, as a responsible steward of other people's money, would be to cover your short
and admit you were wrong. You've done that before with your Netflix short.


Do you ever wonder why people like Buffett and Munger seldom, if ever, short stocks?


I am guessing it's because they know it's much  closer to the playing the lottery than investing.


yours, Craig Joyce

Notice the author hasn't commented on any of the comments. Sometimes, when I write for Seekingalpha, I don't
comment either - that's mostly when I see that the first five or six comments are just troll comments, or people trying
to use my article to open their own tangentially related dialog. About the time I see the words "wall street shill' or " you
clearly have no idea what you are talking about," I have long sinec stopped reading and moved onto new ideas.The
comments in this article, however, are airy constructive by and large. So, why is the athor hiding up his ivory tower
and not rebutting any the the very solid points I am seeing in the commentary.

How confident are you in your short EXAS position?

MR Ackman has Alpha speaking for him..Connect the Dots and everything leads back to ackman. Herbalife won this
one and Ackman Loses..Now he is in court with  
allergen for Insider Trading..I think the Government, FBI and SEC does an investigation on Pershing and Mr Ackman.

I think when Mr. Ackman said he had a price target of zero for the stock he took the word target quite literally.
Fortunately for us he missed the mark.

Are you still part of this embarrassing charade involving pumping out lies and dumping short HLF stock?


It seems that the SEC has started to look at activist investors who work together without properly declaring their intent
to do so. You and Ackman go way back, you admitted you were short this stock, and you even went as far as to take
shots at the company.


Are you still short this stock? Have you worked with Ackman on your short? Have you been subpoenaed by the FBI,
DOJ, or SEC yet?
