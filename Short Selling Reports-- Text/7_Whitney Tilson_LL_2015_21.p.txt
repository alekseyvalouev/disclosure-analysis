Why I Covered My Short Position In Lumber Liquidators
Dec. 14, 2015 5:34 PM ET88 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


In the past week, I’ve received information that leads me to believe that senior
management of Lumber Liquidators wasn’t aware that the company was selling
Chinese-made laminate that had high levels of formaldehyde.


If this information is correct, then the company was sloppy and naïve, but not evil.


If there are no “smoking gun” documents/emails, then the doomsday scenario for the
company (and the stock) is less likely, so I covered my short position today.


In the past week, I've received information (I can't reveal the details at this point) which
leads me to believe that it's likely that senior management of Lumber Liquidators
(NYSE:LL): 1) Wasn't aware that the company was selling Chinese-made laminate that
had high (non-CARB2-compliant) levels of formaldehyde; and 2) Made the decision to
continue selling the product even after the 60 Minutes story aired in large part because
they genuinely believed that the product was safe and compliant.


If true, this new information doesn't change certain key things - there's no doubt in my
mind that the company was, in fact, selling dangerous, formaldehyde-drenched laminate
and that it completely bungled damage-control efforts after the 60 Minutes story aired
(most damningly by continuing to sell the product for 67 more days) - but it does change
the narrative from a company that was knowingly endangering its customers to save on its
sourcing costs to one that was duped by Chinese suppliers and/or middlemen into
believing that it was receiving CARB2-compliant laminate. If so, Lumber Liquidators was
sloppy and naïve, but not evil. Many companies, alas, have unwittingly bought low-quality,
toxic and/or illegal products from Chinese suppliers.


Prior to today, even with the precipitous decline in the stock, which has plunged ~80% this
year, I maintained (and even added to) my short position in Lumber Liquidators because
of three factors:


1) The adverse publicity has tainted the brand and caused large numbers of customers to
avoid the company, which has led to a substantial drop in sales, margins and profits;

Comments (88)


2) Numerous regulators are investigating the company and, if they found evidence that the
company knew it was selling non-compliant laminate, would likely impose crippling
penalties; and


3) There are numerous lawsuits against the company that could (similar to the regulatory
risk) result in enormous damages if evidence emerged that the company knowingly
endangered its customers.


The combination of these three factors led me to believe there was a material chance that
the company could, ultimately, be forced into bankruptcy and the stock could be a zero. If,
however, there are no "smoking gun" documents/emails, then this doomsday scenario is
much less likely (though the company, to be sure, still faces extremely serious issues).


In the court of public opinion and among regulators, judges and juries, intent matters. If
the senior management of Lumber Liquidators didn't have evil intent, then the downside
scenarios for the company (and the stock) are less likely and the upside (recovery)
scenarios are more likely. This shift in the risk/reward equation has led me to cover my
short position (for tax reasons, I have done so by buying in-the-money ($10 strike) call
options expiring next month; I expect to close out these offsetting positions in the new
year).


To be clear: I no longer believe that Lumber Liquidators' stock, at today's price, is an
attractive short.


Disclosure: Funds managed by Mr. Tilson are short shares and long calls of Lumber
Liquidators.

Whit,


I agree that Lumber Liquidators will be around for a long time, and I got long this name over the last couple weeks. If
only you could abandon your senseless Herbalife short in favor of reason. The desperate efforts your buddy Billy is
taking to annihilate this company are not likely to be without consequences to him.


There is a big difference between the due diligence you conducted on LL and the "research" presented against HLF.
One is based on reason, the other rhetoric.

So, Mr. Tilson, you are basically saying you made a colossal mistake and you will be issuing an apology to the
company? (I realize it wasn't a financial mistake.. Since you made your killing... And, you made sure to trade on your
"inside" information before you issued this big announcement.).


Don't get me wrong.. I think the company has huge issues, and I'm no big defender, nor am I long the shares. It just
strikes me as amazing how proud you are of making such an embarrassing public admission. The fact that you are
famous enough to have the ability to move the market in your favor AFTER you have traded on your info, doesn't
change the fact that you should be (but aren't of course) extremely embarrassed.


14 Dec 2015, 06:00 PM


Behavioral_Investor
I don't know about that. He doesn't strike me as 'proud' of his public admission. One could also wonder why
he is releasing a statement of this nature at all.

He will answer you that he was playing in the rules....as Mr.Gecko, he also played IN the rules....of course he
sold BEFORE THIS ARTICLE and now is large, just for the sheeply to feed him again....as the numbers show.


This "evil" definition in law is quite open, what is evil?, VW is evil?, deserves to shut down because is "EVIL"?.


The point is that a honest company was under a severe attack of a TV program without legal enforceable
evidence, thousands of jobs in risk because of it, human suffering, broken relations, families, careers
etc.....just because a program was looking for "content". 
Ethics??, fine, and you?

Just because Tilson covered his position doesnt mean that the company's stock is out of the woods. just because
there was no evil intent doesn't mean that thousands of customers have high level formaldehyde flooring in their
homes they could still cause long-term health risks that does not change I see further downside long term before any
kind of turn around here


14 Dec 2015, 06:24 PM


Skrambled80s
True, but there is a massive short squeeze coming in this name and the stock is severely undervalued.
Private equity could buy this tomorrow, rename it, and float it again for 100% premium.


14 Dec 2015, 06:28 PM

The EPA is kicking the formaldehyde national standard can down the road to next May. The CPSC has NOT
issued ONE recall since they began their investigation. Do you REALLY think there are long term health
risks? C'mon. This is officially OLD.

User 316261
I can't believe anyone still thinks this stuff is dangerous.


This just demonstrates the power of fear mongering over fact.


This chemical is so common and boring and so far down the list to bother regulating the EPA is only recently
turning any attention to it.


Tilson who started this now believes the company was not a bad actor, leading credence to their testing
results which show no notable problem. They have reserved nothing for the end results which would run into
securities fraud if they knew anything different.


At least one lab publicly backed away from the way the shorts used testing results. This is a company with a
reputation to uphold in independence and impartiality.


The fact that anyone can still find anything to worry about here is truly amazing.


You do know water is dangerous?


You can drown in it.

Sorry but not true, thousands of customers bought a product that is safe for all U.S but California, as a matter
of fact just 1% of the product is subject to possible demand, less than GM or Ford, less than Dell or Samsung.

14 Dec 2015, 07:12 PM


Jolly_Rancher
Doesn't the purchase of the options in the eyes of the IRS equate to covering the position now, and not next year
when the options expire? I thought the IRS considered options an equivalent instrument: "The positions are sold or
marketed as offsetting positions, whether or not the positions are called a straddle, spread, butterfly, or any similar
name;" So it seems that by advertising here on SA that you have covered your position with options, you have
essentially offset the short position this year.


14 Dec 2015, 07:25 PM


Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
Jolly, I think you are correct because the options were in-the-money rather than out-of-money by x%. In that
instance the IRS would not consider the position to be equivalent.

14 Dec 2015, 08:34 PM


Milkweed, Contributor
There was a mysterious run up following their recent horrible earnings report. However a little digging showed they
reserved zero for phase 3 testing of customers flooring; where if the home test showed elevated levels of
formaldehyde, samples of the floor would be sent to a lab to test the actual flooring. If the flooring is found to be
emitting too much formaldehyde LL will replace it at their cost.


The cost of replacing the flooring would show up in reserves for Phase 3 testing. The rationale for reserving zero for
Phase three changed from "Don't have enough evidence to know if or how much to reserve" in Q2 to "No evidence
we need to reserve anything" in Q3. IE: the flooring is not emitting too much formaldehyde. I'd bet money the run up
following a horrible Q2 earnings report was Tilson covering because he saw no reserves for Phase 3 testing and the
writing on the wall for all of the investigations and lawsuits.


14 Dec 2015, 08:43 PM


Ivan Gault
Congrats on a great trade.


To all the people writing negative comments, Tilson went to great lengths to discuss his concerns and rationale and
then took the time to inform everyone that he has closed out his position. You have to respect him for being open and
upfront.

TheBaron Investing, Contributor
The "poor people" who shorted the stock are also investors, likely sophisticated investors, who made an
investment decision.


Whitney has no requirement to coddle them. Shorting a stock is inherently risky, and generally ill-advised.


Doing so on the back of the misinformation out there, with a whale like Whitney involved, means they deserve
a 20% wake up call to the risk of shorting a company like this.

husky_hardcore
There's no such thing as poor people who shorted the stock. No innocents here, only vultures. When you
mess with a bull, sometimes you get the horn. Ouch.....


I'd be remiss if I didn't tip my hat to the longs who kept the faith. The saying, "That which doesn't kill you shall
make you stronger," applies here.


Tilson will get his due, sooner or later. What comes around, goes around.....

Always funny to see the anger of investors on SA towards short traders. Even when the information is viable, and a
cohesive case presented.


You don't see the vitriol and hate from someone who is short towards an analyst who presents a long case like you do
when someone is long reads a short sale presentation.


14 Dec 2015, 11:00 PM


User 316261
Michael,


I think the issue many longs had was the way the short case used an invented test and invented standards to
measure the invented test against.


I suspect this will be a case examined in history on how to invent a short case for a company incapable of
defending against it, and then profiting enormously regardless the actual facts.


It's very clever. It's also pretty sick.

is, 8 months later, and CARB still hasn't said anything. Here's one to think about. Was it odd to anyone that the
"interview with the employee " was on the grounds of the factory. Think about it; your company is selling inferior
products to a US company and making $$. Why on earth would you go on the record and kill your own business.
Tilson timed it perfectly. LL was already in free fall. It was obviously way over-valued. But with the new compliance
officer settling with the FEDs for nil, a new ceo, $1bb in sales and still opening new stores, analysts still very negative,
hugh short position ( Tilson will still have to cover in Jan ) , a strong housing market, low interest rates. ETC ETC.
AND, in a few months you will have comps from when the story originally ran. They might be up....20%. Tilson should
be arrested and charged with stock manipulation. Martha Stewart went to jail for a hell of a lot less than this. He had a
great trade though. LL can be $35 before 2016 is out.

Presumably, because he doesn't work for LL nor have any close relatives who do, or who are on the board,
then he's in the clear, despite claiming to have information from such a source.

They should add to the rules that Ban shorting shorts altogether. It is not health for the market, the company, the
investors. It is just a sneaky way for a few to make money off of screwing a stock.


15 Dec 2015, 06:23 AM


maxime1
No it shouldn't be banned. It should be left to the decision of the exchanges whether or not people can short
shares of the companies traded on their exchange. How can you say it's not healthy for markets? Do you
think people would care to uncover frauds in companies if they couldn't profit from it? Besides sometimes
companies sometimes get overpriced and the price needs to come back down. It's true that unscrupulous
people will try to bring down good companies but how is it different from pumping and dumping on the long
side? And if there can be abuses on the long side, why not ban going long?

Options also trade OTC.


He may have interest in Jan 10 calls that are not traded publicly via the exchange. You wouldn't see that

Most options interest is OTC. You'd never know the position and sizing of the people involved. That's the point
of trading OTC, as long as you have a counterparty willing to take the other side of the trade.

To Mr. Boyd, that's true, but if you look at the open interest of the Jan 10 strike, it dwarfs every strike around it. The

dramatic headline grabbing story that enriched them both.

The lies will slowly come out. EPA, although always late, will come out with their regulation that will essentially say

jkurtz@cableone.net
As shown on p 109 of the reference below the level of formaldehyde in human blood is between 2 and 3 ppm, many
times higher than the supposedly unsafe levels of formaldehyde generated from LL's non-compliant laminated
flooring. Therefor we can safely state that Mr. Tilson has higher amounts of formaldehyde in his blood than the
amounts which are the subject of his shrill complaints.

LOL. Just because a chemical is present in the body doesn't mean it isn't bad for you if taken in from the
environment.


Your own source labels formaldehyde inhalation as an irritant and links its inhalation to cancer.


The WHO standards for safe formaldehyde inhalation levels are actually more stringent than CARB, which
Tilson tested against.

Does it mean that we should welcome or consume such chemicals  when they are being "offered"/sold to us
through external/out-of-body products/sources? No!!!

But Tilson didn't test against any established standards. This simply isn't true.


Look, if you inhale water you drown.


That doesn't make inhaling water a valid test.


If you jump off a roof you can break your legs.


That doesn't make jumping off a roof a valid roofing test.

If you mash up a piece of laminate flooring with a power tool and lock it in a sealed enclosure you get
formaldehyde.


That doesn't make this a valid test either.

After seeing the 60 Minutes story it still took LL 67 days to realize they had a problem?


It took me a fraction of that time to buy a formaldehyde detector and check the levels in my own home (in which LL's
Chinese flooring had been installed).


I would argue that their reckless disregard for public safety actually does rise (or sink) to the level of evil. And I can't
imagine even OJ's defense team convincing any objective, informed person to the contrary.


Also note that the case I made for shorting LL a few months back was far more reliant upon the damages suffered by
consumers than by whatever penalties might be forthcoming from regulators.


http://seekingalpha.co...


As an aside, I'm very suspicious of any major stock price change whose rationale relies on information whose details
can't be disclosed. If WT can trade on it (as he apparently has), I'm doubly suspicious of any circumstances that
would prevent him from disclosing this nugget, whatever in heck it is.

A different commenter mentioned that it might be the fact that they have been setting aside zero reserves for
replacing flooring in customers homes, available in their last several 10Q's.


At first it was because they were not sure how much to set aside (as they believed there was no issue).


Recently they changed the language to indicate they honestly believe that there is no issue and they will not
need to replace any, allowing them to continue to set aside zero.


If he was able to find confirmation from someone, it would indicate that they not only had no idea that the
products had excess chemicals (because they either believed they didn't or they actually don't)... But also that
they are confident months after the accusations aired that there is no harmful amount coming off their
products, allowing them not to need to replace any (since installed, finished flooring does not produce any of
the ill-effects everyone's been accusing them of, to my understanding).


I am curious though, since I don't own them I have not verified any of this... If you tested your floor, what did
you find? According to the company and many of the longs, only through destructive testing would you find
anything close to harmful levels... The flooring should produce little to no readings otherwise.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3754706-covered-short-position-lumber-liquidators 14/19


We had put new flooring (Morningstar Bamboo) in a home we had intended to sell (while we were renting
elsewhere). The flooring was installed late last year.


We subsequently had a buyer whose financing fell through, and by the time of the 60 Minutes interview we
had decided to take the house off the market & move back in. Before doing so, however, I wanted to check
the formaldehyde. The reading I got was about 20% short of the recommended limit, so we went ahead and
moved in a few weeks later.


I'm not sure what, if anything, all this proves. On the one hand, the reading may well have been much higher
immediately after the flooring was installed. On the other, the reading was taken on the air in the house - not
the flooring itself - so other factors may have been involved.


I requested a test from LL before I bought a formaldehyde meter and did the test myself, but they told me that
my bamboo flooring wasn't eligible for testing. I didn't pursue the matter, but I have seen elsewhere
indications that some types of bamboo flooring may well have a formaldehyde issue - so I'm still suspicious as
to the amount of formaldehyde my flooring might have been giving off when first purchased.

Formaldehyde is used in many, many, many, products. I used to work for a very large private furniture
company and they experienced a significant amount of negative feedback from customers complaining of a
strong odor after their furniture was assembled in their homes. This was around 2008 ish. It was discovered
that this odor was from the glue used in the product. This glue also contained formaldehyde. The company is
still in business today. The fact is formaldehyde is used in many products and unless you read every label,
and even then, you may not realize this. That scent of "new" anything is usually chemicals offgasing. If you're
test showed "levels that were short of the recommended limits" this means that ALL of the products in your
home that use formaldehyde COMBINED did not reach the exposure limits. Think about that. Not only did
your flooring (which you cannot single out in your home air test) not reach the exposure limits, but all of the
other products that you believe are "safe" (because a hedge fund manager didn't tell you they weren't)
COMBINED were not enough to reach exposure limits. I believe the test results you received will be shared
among the many other customers who conducted the same or similar air quality tests.

Michael Boyd, Marketplace Contributor
Formaldehyde is produced from off-gassing. As an example, a one year old desk is no longer off-gassing as it
has aged sufficiently. There is a finite amount of the chemical present during construction that is released
rather quickly once completed.


Unless he replaced his furniture at the same time, there wouldn't be a significant source of the chemical other
than flooring in his home when he tested, besides home appliances that operate off natural gas.

Unless he was cooking with gas.

EnerSavr, Contributor
William, 
Please read my contribution on SA on formaldehyde levels emissions from different materials. One's gas stove
(based on CARB itself) generates 8 times the levels that is ever emitted from the laminated flooring. Formaldehyde
evaporates very fast, it does not hang around. So cooking is very hazardous to one's health, but then so is living. This
had nothing to do with raising public awareness IMO.


15 Dec 2015, 11:22 AM


William Matson, CFA, Contributor
That's one of the reasons I don't leave my gas stove on 24/7!

I suspect you also don't mash up your laminate flooring with a power tool and then lock both it and yourself in
a sealed enclosure.


16 Dec 2015, 02:42 PM


Michael Boyd, Marketplace Contributor
Well, a sealed enclosure pretty much is your house. I doubt you leave the windows open all day.


And Whitney's testing method was done the same way CARB tests for compliance. It wasn't a new invention.
The deconstructive method is how they test.


16 Dec 2015, 02:49 PM


User 316261
Michael, this just isn't true. CARB do not use deconstruction for testing compliance. They use it to assess the
performance of their pre-construction testing regime.


If your house is genuinely a sealed enclosure, please open your windows immediately to avoid suffocating.


How often does your AC run in the hot season? Or your heating when cold?


Your house is not a sealed enclosure. That is absolutely guaranteed.

"First the labs tested for CARB compliance... the underlying medium density fiberboard, or "core" of the
product must pass CARB's emissions standards in order for the product to be legally sold in California.... 60
minutes also confirmed with CARB officials that the deconstructive test method is the way they test finished
goods... thirty of the thirty one samples tested contaminated levels of formaldehyde emissions that exceed
the limits set by CARB".


A house is not air-tight, but its fairly equivalent. Fact is that Tilson's tests were in-line with CARB testing
standards.


16 Dec 2015, 03:11 PM


User 316261
Michael that doesn't say what you think it says. You have to read it carefully.


It is absolutely true that the way CARB test finished goods is by deconstruction.


That does not make this test a compliance test. It isn't. The variability is too great, and it doesn't represent
real world usage.


The actual compliance test is done pre construction on the core by a CARB approved agent.


16 Dec 2015, 03:20 PM


User 316261
I suppose I could have said clearly there are multiple reasons why CARB does not use the test that Tilson
used for compliance testing.


There are multiple reasons why but the bottom line is that the test that Tilson used is not suitable for
compliance testing.


16 Dec 2015, 04:00 PM


jkurtz@cableone.net
Mr. Boyd, the WHO standard is 0.1 mg/cubic meter which is 0.08 ppm (see p 104 of the reference for conversion
factors.


The CARB standard is 0.05 ppm (see reference below).

I can understand your confusion since the units are, perhaps purposely, confusing.

Michael thinks his house is a sealed enclosure but never suffocated in it and can't smell the bacon he cooked
in it last week either.


Someone who doesn't understand that a house leaks like a sieve can't be expected to interpret these
standards.


The issue for the stock is that the price is driven by fear mongering amongst people who can't understand
what they are reading. They rely on others to get it right on their behalf and have had their confidence
shaken.


Understandable and I expect that's one reason Tilson chose it.


Fortunately people have a limited attention span for things they can't understand.

That is the answer I expect from people with little to no knowledge about formaldehyde. One does not need to have
the gas stove on 24/7 or anywhere near it. That is just one example of a major source that is in our homes.

What's ridiculous is this article and the statement made by Tilson that "senior management of Lumber Liquidators
wasn’t aware that the company was selling Chinese-made laminate that had high levels of formaldehyde" We're they
also not aware in 2013 when Xuhua Zhou first outed them for high levels of formaldehyde? That class action case
was settled out of court and swept under the rug but yet, here we are again with the same problem! TS boasts that
they have inspectors checking the plants regularly but they also weren't aware of this problem? Give me a break!
