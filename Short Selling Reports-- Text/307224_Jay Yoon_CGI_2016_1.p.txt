Celadon	Group:	Strong	Sell	Due	To	Major	Accounting	Concerns,
Misleading	Behavior	And	Likely	Insolvency
Top	Idea | Jul.	5,	2016	5:00	AM	ET10	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


By	inflating	its	PP&E,	I	estimate	that	Celadon	Group	may	have	overstated	its	Q3
2016	net	income	by	around	$18	million.	Accounting	irregularities	suggest	Q2	2016
profits	may	also	be	overstated.


If	Celadon	is	misrepresenting	its	financial	performance,	this	could	lead	to	an	SEC
investigation,	and	could	also	result	in	a	default	under	the	company's	credit
agreement.


Celadon	appears	to	have	also	misled	investors	by	understating	its	liabilities.	I
estimate	the	company	has	up	to	$67	million	of	reserve	account	liabilities	which	are
not	included	its	balance	sheet.


A	large	debt	load,	a	weak	competitive	position	and	challenging	covenant	situation
will	make	it	very	difficult	for	Celadon	to	survive	the	ongoing	industry	downturn.


Celadon	Group	is	a	tremendous	short	at	the	current	share	price.


Summary	Thesis


Celadon	Group	("CGI"	or	the	"Company")	(NYSE:CGI)	provides	trucking	services	primarily
in	the	US,	as	well	as	in	Canada	and	Mexico.	Since	late	2015,	the	trucking	industry	has
been	mired	in	an	ongoing	slowdown.	Sluggish	demand	and	an	ill-timed	fleet	expansion	by
operators	have	resulted	in	significantly	reduced	pricing	and	utilization	for	trucking	services.
As	a	result	of	the	ongoing	trucking	downturn,	CGI's	recent	financial	performance	has
come	under	a	great	deal	of	pressure.	In	the	most	recently	completed	quarter,	the
Company	reported	that	its	diluted	EPS	had	declined	47%	from	$0.36	in	Q3	2015	to	$0.19
in	Q3	2016.	In	addition	to	declining	profitability,	the	Company	has	an	uncomfortably	high
amount	of	debt,	capital	leases	and	operating	leases	on	its	books.	CGI	accumulated	these
obligations	through	an	aggressive,	ill-timed	fleet	expansion	which	occurred	just	prior	to	the
recent	industry	slowdown.	As	a	result	of	its	declining	profitability	and	large	amount	of
financial	obligations,	some	investors	are	worried	about	the	Company's	ability	to	survive
this	downturn.

Unfortunately	for	CGI	investors,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	financial	performance	may
be	even	worse	than	what	has	been	portrayed	in	its	earnings	reports.	Through	creative
accounting	methods,	I	believe	it	may	have	overstated	its	Q3	2016	net	income	by
approximately	$18	million.	The	Company	appears	to	have	accomplished	this	through	a
combination	of	asset	boosting	and	working	capital	manipulation.	If	$18	million	of
potentially	overstated	profits	are	deducted	from	Q3	2016	net	income	of	$5.2	million,	then
CGI	would	have	reported	a	net	loss	of	$12.8	million.	In	addition	to	this,	based	on
accounting	irregularities	in	CGI's	Q2	2016	results,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	Q2
net	income	may	have	been	overstated	as	well.	Finally,	its	profits	were	further	inflated	by
an	aggressive	PP&E	useful	life	increase,	which	boosted	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016	EPS	by	a
combined	total	of	$0.12.


In	addition	to	potentially	inflating	its	profits,	it	appears	that	CGI	may	have	also
misrepresented	its	liabilities	to	investors.	Based	on	the	Company's	reserve	account
agreements	with	Element	and	19 	Capital,	it	appears	that	CGI	has	around	$67
million	of	reserve	account	liabilities	which	are	not	reflected	on	its	balance	sheet.	In
addition	to	misrepresenting	its	reserve	account	liabilities,	CGI	management	also	stated
that	the	Company	did	not	have	any	residual	value	guarantees.	However,	according	to	the
Company's	most	recent	10-Q,	it	appears	that	CGI	currently	has	$49	million	of	residual
value	guarantees	related	to	its	operating	leases.


The	fact	that	CGI	may	be	overstating	its	profits	and	understating	its	liabilities	is	a	highly
concerning	development	for	shareholders,	for	a	number	of	reasons.	If	it	is	artificially
inflating	its	financial	performance,	this	could	lead	to	an	SEC	investigation	and	other
legal	troubles	for	the	business.	This	would	also	constitute	an	event	of	default	under
its	credit	agreement,	which	could	result	in	a	bankruptcy	filing	by	the	Company.


Even	if	CGI	were	not	manipulating	its	reported	financials,	the	Company's	ability	to
stay	solvent	would	still	be	in	question.	Based	on	recent	reports,	it	appears	likely	that
the	trucking	industry	will	not	make	a	meaningful	recovery	until	after	2017.	Given	CGI's
large	debt	load	and	weak	competitive	position,	it	will	be	difficult	for	the	Company	to	survive
such	a	prolonged	downturn.	In	addition	to	this,	the	Company	has	little	cushion	remaining
under	its	maximum	leverage	ratio	covenant.	CGI's	low	amount	of	covenant	cushion	will
limit	its	ability	to	borrow	additional	debt	and	fund	its	ongoing	liquidity	needs.


Overall,	I	believe	CGI	is	highly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price	of	$8.25	(as	of
7/1/16).	I	estimate	that	fair	value	for	the	shares	is	$3.10,	which	represents	a	62%	discount
to	the	current	share	price.	Thus,	I	recommend	shorting	CGI	or	selling	the	shares	if	you	are
an	existing	shareholder.

Recent	Trucking	Downturn	Has	Greatly	Pressured	CGI's	Business


Since	the	trucking	downturn	began	in	late	2015,	CGI's	profitability	over	the	past	six
months	(two	quarters)	has	come	under	a	great	deal	of	pressure.	Provided	below	is	a
comparison	of	the	Company's	Q2	and	Q3	2016	financial	results	relative	to	last	year.


As	shown	above,	its	profitability	over	the	past	six	months	has	declined	by	a	substantial
amount	in	comparison	to	a	year	ago.	In	Q2	2016	(quarter	ended	12/31/15),	the	Company's
quarterly	EPS	declined	by	33%	on	a	year-over-year	basis,	from	$0.36	to	$0.24.	In	Q3
2016	(quarter	ended	3/31/16),	CGI's	quarterly	EPS	declined	by	almost	50%	on	a	year-
over-year	basis,	from	$0.36	to	$0.19.	This	large	decline	in	profitability	over	the	past	two
quarters	was	driven	by	negative	industry	trends,	such	as	lower	average	miles	per	tractor
(utilization),	lower	pricing,	and	lower	gains	on	equipment	(tractors,	trailers)	resales.	Also
contributing	to	the	reduced	profitability	was	a	$3.3	million	increase	in	the	Company's	total
interest	expense	over	the	past	two	quarters.


Analysts	expect	its	financial	performance	to	continue	deteriorating	in	Q4	2016.	Based	on
consensus	estimates	on	Yahoo	Finance,	analysts	estimate	CGI	will	report	just	$0.23	of
EPS	in	Q4	2016.	This	represents	a	51%	decline	in	quarterly	EPS	relative	to	Q4	2015	EPS
of	$0.47.


In	addition	to	declining	financial	performance,	CGI	also	has	an	uncomfortable	amount	of
leverage	on	its	balance	sheet.	Just	prior	to	the	recent	downturn,	CGI	aggressively
expanded	and	updated	its	fleet	via	acquisitions	and	capital	expenditures.	As	a	result	of
this,	the	Company	amassed	a	large	amount	of	debt	and	lease	obligations	in	a	short	period
of	time.	As	shown	in	the	table	below,	as	of	Q3	2016,	CGI's	reported	debt	and	lease
obligations	totaled	$579.8	million.

Overall,	CGI	appears	to	be	in	a	very	difficult	position.	It	faces	a	mountain	of	financial
obligations,	deteriorating	profits	and	an	unfavorable	industry	environment.	Unfortunately
for	CGI	shareholders,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	financial	situation	may	be	even	worse
than	what	is	reflected	in	their	reported	results.	As	I	will	discuss	over	the	next	few	sections,
it	appears	that	CGI	may	have	inflated	its	Q2	and	Q3	profits,	as	well	as	misrepresented
other	aspects	of	its	business	to	shareholders.


Irregularities	In	CGI's	Q3	2016	Working	Capital	Raises	Red	Flags


I	first	became	suspicious	of	CGI's	financial	reporting	after	discovering	a	number	of
irregularities	in	its	reported	Q3	2016	working	capital	figures.	More	specifically,	I	noticed
that	the	changes	in	working	capital	on	the	balance	sheet	did	not	match	the	cash
flow	statement.


As	most	readers	are	probably	already	aware,	changes	in	working	capital	assets	result	in
an	opposite	change	in	operating	cash	flow.	For	example,	if	a	working	capital	asset
increases	by	$5	million	over	a	certain	time	period,	then	$5	million	is	subtracted	in	the
operating	cash	flow	statement	for	that	same	time	period.	For	working	capital	liabilities,	the
opposite	is	true.	If	a	working	capital	liability	increases	by	$5	million,	then	$5	million	is
added	to	the	operating	cash	flow	statement.


Based	on	the	changes	in	working	capital	on	CGI's	balance	sheet,	the	Company
reported	an	increase	in	net	working	capital	of	$24.1	million	from	Q2	2016	to	Q3
2016.	This	increase	in	net	working	capital	should	have	reduced	operating	cash	flow	by
around	the	same	amount	($24.1	million).	However,	in	CGI's	cash	flow	statement,	the
reduction	in	Q3	2016	operating	cash	flow	due	to	working	capital	changes	was	$18.0
million	higher	at	$42.0	million.	Thus,	CGI's	Q3	2016	operating	cash	flow	statement
implies	that	the	Company's	net	working	capital	increased	$42.0	million.


So	what	exactly	is	causing	this	large	mismatch	in	net	working	capital	change	between	the
balance	sheet	and	cash	flow	statement?	Provided	below	is	a	detailed	side-by-side
comparison	of	the	working	capital	changes	reflected	in	the	Company's	balance	sheet

versus	its	cash	flow	statement.


In	the	red	boxes	above,	I	have	highlighted	two	line	items:	equipment	held	for	sale	and
accounts	payable	&	accrued	expenses.	These	two	line	items	are	primarily	responsible	for
the	large	difference	in	the	change	in	working	capital	between	the	two	financial	statements.
With	regard	to	equipment	held	for	sale,	in	Q3	2016,	the	increase	in	equipment	held	for
sale	was	$31.9	million	higher	in	the	cash	flow	statement	than	in	the	balance	sheet.
Offsetting	some	of	this	difference	was	the	accounts	payable	&	accrued	expenses	line	item.
In	Q3	2016,	the	change	in	accounts	payable	&	accrued	expenses	was	$13.9	million	less	in
the	cash	flow	statement	than	in	the	balance	sheet.	Overall,	on	a	combined	basis,	the	net
working	capital	increase	resulting	from	these	two	line	items	was	$18	million	higher	in	the
cash	flow	statement	versus	the	balance	sheet	($31.9-13.9	million).	This	is	equivalent	to
the	$18	million	difference	in	total	net	working	capital	increase	reported	on	the	balance
sheet	($24.1	million)	versus	the	cash	flow	statement	($42.0	million).	(See	the	Appendix	for
more	detail	on	my	working	capital	calculations.)


CGI	Appears	To	Have	Inflated	Its	Q3	PP&E	Balance


The	large	difference	in	working	capital	changes	reflected	in	CGI's	Q3	2016	balance	sheet
versus	its	cash	flow	statement	is	highly	unusual.	In	general,	working	capital	changes	in	a
given	time	period	should	match	between	these	two	statements.	Sometimes,	acquisitions
and	fluctuations	in	exchange	rates	can	cause	large	differences	in	working	capital	changes.
However,	the	Company	only	spent	$0.5	million	on	acquisitions	in	Q3	2016.	Furthermore,
just	12%	of	its	revenue	in	Q3	2016	came	from	international	markets	(Canada	and	Mexico).
Thus,	the	large	differences	in	CGI's	working	capital	changes,	particularly	its
equipment	held	for	sale	and	accounts	payable	&	accrued	expense	line	items,	cannot	be
attributed	to	acquisitions	or	exchange	rates.

If	working	capital	changes	on	the	balance	sheet	do	not	match	the	cash	flow	statement,	it
should	create	an	imbalance	on	the	balance	sheet.	To	illustrate	this	point,	I	have	provided
the	following	analysis:


In	the	example	above,	I	have	assumed	that	a	fictional	company	starts	its	business	at	the
end	of	Year	0	with	$0	of	assets.	In	the	Year	1	income	statement,	I	have	assumed	that	this
company	earns	$10	million	of	revenue	and	pays	$0	of	expenses.	Thus,	Year	1	net	income
is	equal	to	revenue	at	$10	million.	In	the	Year	1	balance	sheet,	I	have	assumed	that	the
company	books	an	increase	of	$5	million	in	accounts	receivable.	However,	in	the	Year	1
cash	flow	statement,	I	have	assumed	that	the	increase	in	accounts	receivable	/	net
working	capital	is	$8	million.


As	highlighted	in	the	red	boxes	above,	this	larger	relative	increase	in	accounts	receivable	/
net	working	capital	in	the	cash	flow	statement	has	created	an	imbalance	of	$3	million	in
the	Year	1	balance	sheet.	Basically,	the	additional	$3	million	increase	in	accounts
receivable	in	the	cash	flow	statement	has	lowered	the	ending	cash	balance	to	$2	million.
At	the	same	time,	accounts	receivable	on	the	balance	sheet	is	just	$5	million.	Thus,	the
company's	total	assets	at	the	end	of	Year	1	amount	to	just	$7	million,	which	is	$3	million
lower	than	the	implied	equity	value	of	$10	million.


Based	on	this	example,	it	is	apparent	that	CGI's	net	working	capital	discrepancies	in
Q3	2016	should	have	created	an	imbalance	on	its	balance	sheet.	However,	at	the	end
of	Q3	2016,	it	reported	a	balance	sheet	which	was	perfectly	balanced.	How	was	the
Company	able	to	accomplish	this?	Based	on	my	analysis	of	CGI's	PP&E	account,	it

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 7/26


appears	that	the	Company	artificially	inflated	PP&E	in	order	to	plug	the	hole	in	its
balance	sheet.	To	support	this	claim,	I	have	provided	below	the	following	analysis	of
CGI's	Q3	2016	PP&E:


Based	on	CGI's	depreciation,	capex,	and	sale	proceeds	from	PP&E,	I	estimate	that	the
Company	should	have	reported	around	$722.5	million	of	PP&E	at	the	end	of	Q3	2016.	By
comparison,	its	actual	reported	PP&E	balance	was	$22.3	million	higher	at	$744.8	million.
As	discussed	in	the	previous	section,	the	implied	increase	in	CGI's	Q3	2016	net	working
capital	was	$18	million	higher	in	the	cash	flow	statement	than	on	the	balance	sheet.	This,
in	turn,	should	have	created	an	imbalance	of	$18	million	in	CGI's	Q3	2016	balance	sheet.
Based	on	the	large	difference	between	actual	versus	implied	PP&E	calculated	above,	it
appears	that	CGI	eliminated	this	imbalance	by	simply	overstating	its	PP&E	balance.


My	assertion	that	PP&E	has	been	overstated	is	also	supported	by	a	simple	analysis	of
CGI's	non-working	capital	assets.	The	only	non-working	capital	assets	on	the	Company's
balance	sheet	are	goodwill,	investment	in	unconsolidated	companies,	and	PP&E.	From
Q2	2016	to	Q3	2016,	goodwill	increased	just	$2.4	million,	from	$58.9	million	to	$61.3
million.	During	this	same	time	period,	investment	in	unconsolidated	companies	remained
the	same	at	$2.0	million.	Thus,	by	the	process	of	elimination,	it	appears	that	inflating
PP&E	is	the	only	way	CGI	could	have	plugged	the	hole	in	its	balance	sheet.


By	Overstating	PP&E,	CGI	Appears	To	Have	Overstated	Its	Q3	2016	Profits


Artificially	boosting	asset	values	is	a	well-known	technique	that	companies	in	the	past
have	used	to	overstate	their	profits.	If	a	company	inflates	its	profits,	it	will	never	receive
cash	for	these	overstated	profits,	since	they	do	not	exist.	To	cover	up	the	resulting	cash

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 8/26


shortfall,	a	company	will	then	artificially	boost	the	value	of	one	of	its	other	assets.	By	doing
so,	the	company	can	keep	its	balance	sheet	in	balance.


In	Q3	2016,	I	believe	CGI	may	have	used	a	combination	of	asset	boosting	(inflating
PP&E)	and	working	capital	manipulation	in	order	to	overstate	its	profits.	Based	on	the
difference	in	working	capital	changes	between	the	cash	flow	statement	and	balance	sheet,
I	estimate	that	CGI's	Q3	2016	net	income	may	have	been	overstated	by	$18	million.
As	discussed	previously,	CGI's	cash	deductions	from	working	capital	changes	were	$18
million	higher	in	the	cash	flow	statement	versus	the	balance	sheet.	It	appears	that	the
Company	deducted	this	additional	amount	in	the	cash	flow	statement	in	order	to	cover	up
the	cash	shortfall	created	by	its	seemingly	overstated	net	income.	Then,	as	a	final	step,	I
believe	CGI	may	have	artificially	boosted	its	PP&E	in	order	to	keep	its	balance	sheet	in
balance.


My	claim	that	CGI	has	likely	overstated	its	Q3	2016	net	income	is	a	serious	assertion.
That	being	said,	it	is	the	only	logical	explanation	I	can	come	up	with	for	the	Company's
highly	irregular	accounting	methods.	Consider	the	fact	that	$18	million	of	CGI's	Q3	2016
profits	will	not	translate	into	cash	in	the	future.	Instead	of	increasing	the	Company's	cash
or	receivables	balances,	these	profits	have	simply	been	added	to	its	PP&E	balance
(without	a	corresponding	capital	expenditure).	This	does	not	make	sense.	When	a
company	earns	profits,	it	should	eventually	receive	cash	in	the	future	for	the	amount	of
profit	that	was	booked.	However,	in	the	case	of	CGI,	$18	million	of	its	Q3	2016	net	income
is	directly	translating	into	increased	PP&E	rather	than	cash	or	future	cash.	Quite	simply,
profits	that	never	translate	into	cash	are	not	real	profits.


Further	supporting	my	claim	that	profits	may	have	been	inflated	is	CGI's	low	cash	flow
generation.	When	operating	cash	flow	generation	significantly	lags	earnings,	this	can	be	a
warning	sign	of	potential	accounting	irregularities.	In	Q3	2016,	CGI	reported	$5.2	million	of
net	income	for	the	quarter	and	$23.2	million	of	net	income	for	the	YTD	period.	In
comparison,	the	Company	reported	negative	$18.4	million	of	operating	cash	flow	in	the
quarter	and	just	$4.5	million	of	operating	cash	flow	for	the	YTD	period.	This	significantly
lower	amount	of	operating	cash	flow	compared	to	net	income	raises	red	flags	regarding
the	legitimacy	of	the	Company's	earnings.	Typically,	for	a	capex-intensive	business,
operating	cash	flow	should	be	meaningfully	higher	than	net	income	due	to	the	addback	of
depreciation	(a	non-cash	expense)	in	the	operating	cash	flow	statement.


In	Q3	2016,	CGI	reported	net	income	of	$5.2	million	and	$0.19	of	diluted	EPS.	If	$18
million	is	deducted	from	Q3	2016	results,	then	the	Company	would	have	reported	a
net	loss	of	$12.8	million	and	a	net	loss	per	share	of	$0.45.	Thus,	without	these

potentially	overstated	profits,	it	appears	that	CGI	is	currently	a	significant	loss-
making	business.


Irregular	Accounting	Indicates	Q2	2016	Profits	May	Have	Also	Been	Inflated


Unfortunately,	CGI's	irregular	accounting	was	not	isolated	to	Q3	2016.	While	examining	its
Q2	2016	results,	I	also	discovered	some	troubling	accounting	discrepancies.	For	example,
similar	to	Q3	2016,	the	working	capital	changes	reflected	in	the	Company's	Q2	2016
balance	sheet	do	not	match	the	cash	flow	statement.	Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of
the	working	capital	changes	reflected	in	the	balance	sheet	versus	its	cash	flow	statement:


As	shown	above,	total	net	working	capital	on	CGI's	balance	sheet	decreased	by
$30.3	million	from	Q1	2016	to	Q2	2016.	However,	in	CGI's	Q2	2016	cash	flow
statement,	the	implied	decrease	in	total	net	working	capital	was	around	$6	million
lower	at	$24.4	million.	Similar	to	Q3	2016,	equipment	held	for	sale	and	accounts	payable
&	accrued	expenses	accounted	for	most	of	this	difference	in	working	capital	changes.


In	addition	to	working	capital	discrepancies,	I	also	noticed	irregularities	in	the	Company's
reported	cash	flow	from	the	purchase	and	sale	of	PP&E.	Provided	below	is	comparison	of
CGI's	cash	flow	from	investing	activities	in	Q1	2016	versus	YTD	Q2	2016:

As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	in	Q1	2016,	CGI	reported	proceeds	from	the	sale	of
PP&E	of	$115.5	million.	The	following	quarter,	at	the	end	of	Q2	2016,	it	reported	YTD
proceeds	from	the	sale	of	PP&E	of	$107.9	million.	From	these	figures,	it	can	be	calculated
that	CGI	actually	reported	negative	PP&E	sale	proceeds	of	$7.6	million	in	Q2	2016
($107.9	million	of	YTD	proceeds	minus	$115.5	million	of	Q1	proceeds).


The	fact	that	the	Company	reported	negative	PP&E	sale	proceeds	in	Q2	2016	is	highly
irregular.	By	reporting	negative	sale	proceeds,	CGI's	PP&E	sale	proceeds	line	item
actually	increased	rather	than	decreased	its	PP&E	balance	in	Q2	2016.	Thus,	in	Q2	2016,
PP&E	sale	proceeds	was	essentially	an	additional	form	of	capex	for	the	business.	Also
peculiar	was	the	fact	that	the	Company	reported	a	small	amount	($0.3	million)	of	positive
cash	flow	from	the	purchase	of	PP&E	in	Q2	2016.	Overall,	its	PP&E	cash	flow	accounting
in	Q2	2016	was	completely	reversed	where	PP&E	proceeds	were	a	cash	drain,	while
PP&E	purchases	were	a	cash	inflow.


The	working	capital	and	PP&E	irregularities	in	Q2	2016	raises	concerns	that	the
Company	may	have	overstated	its	profits	in	this	quarter	as	well.	For	example,	by
reporting	negative	PP&E	sale	proceeds,	CGI	could	be	artificially	boosting	its	PP&E	as	a
means	to	overstate	its	profits.	Also,	as	I	demonstrated	in	my	discussion	of	Q3	2016
results,	working	capital	can	be	manipulated	to	help	cover	up	a	cash	shortfall	resulting	from
overstated	profits.


Unfortunately,	compared	to	Q3	2016,	CGI's	Q2	2016	results	are	a	lot	harder	to	decipher.
Thus,	I	cannot	say	with	the	same	amount	of	conviction	that	its	Q2	2016	profits	were	likely
inflated.	The	reason	is	because	there	is	a	lot	more	"noise"	in	the	Q2	numbers.	During	the
quarter,	the	Company	converted	$61.2	million	of	capital	leases	to	operating	leases	and
made	$5	million	worth	of	acquisitions.	These	items	could	potentially	explain	the	distorted
PP&E	cash	flow	figures	in	the	quarter.	That	being	said,	they	would	not	explain	the	large
discrepancies	in	some	of	the	Company's	working	capital	items	(i.e.,	equipment	held	for
sale,	accounts	payable	&	accrued	expenses).


At	the	very	least,	the	issues	I	have	highlighted	regarding	CGI's	Q2	2016	results	further	call
into	question	the	integrity	of	the	Company's	financial	statements.	I	believe	that
management	needs	to	provide	an	explanation	for	its	irregular	accounting	methods	over
the	past	two	quarters.	Until	management	provides	a	credible	explanation	for	these
irregularities,	investors	should	continue	to	view	CGI's	reported	results	with	a	great	deal	of
skepticism.


Concerns	Over	Recent	Changes	To	PP&E	Useful	Life	Estimates
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Strong Sell Due To Major Accounting Concerns, Misleading Behavior And Likely Insolvency - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 11/26


Another	point	of	concern	regarding	CGI's	accounting	is	the	Company's	aggressive	useful
life	estimates.	In	Q2	2016,	CGI	significantly	increased	the	useful	life	of	its	PP&E.	The
following	disclosure	describing	this	change	in	useful	life	was	provided	on	pg.	13	of	the
Company's	Q2	2016	10-Q:


"...	effective	October	1,	2015,	the	Company	changed	its	estimates	of	the	useful	lives
and	salvage	value	of	certain	tractors	and	trailers	to	better	reflect	the	estimated
periods	during	which	these	assets	will	remain	in	service.	The	estimated	useful
lives	of	the	tractors	and	trailers	that	previously	were	3	years	for	tractors	and	7
years	for	trailers	were	increased	to	4	years	for	tractors	and	10	years	for
trailers."


As	stated	above,	at	the	beginning	of	Q2	2016,	CGI	significantly	increased	the	useful
life	of	both	its	tractors	(3	years	to	4	years)	and	its	trailers	(7	years	to	10	years).	By
doing	so,	the	Company	reduced	its	depreciation	expense	by	$5.2	million	and	increased
EPS	by	$0.12	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016	combined.	During	this	same	time	period,	it
reported	a	total	of	$0.43	in	EPS	($0.24	in	Q2	2016,	$0.19	in	Q3	2016).	Thus,	by
changing	the	useful	life	of	its	PP&E,	CGI	has	inflated	its	reported	earnings	by	a
significant	amount	(almost	39%).	Without	this	change	in	useful	life,	the	Company	would
have	reported	just	$0.31	of	EPS	over	the	past	two	quarters.


The	change	in	CGI's	useful	life	estimate	is	suspicious	for	a	few	reasons.	First,	prior	to	the
change	in	Q2	2016,	the	Company	has	kept	its	PP&E	useful	life	estimates	roughly	the
same	for	over	ten	years.	For	example,	the	following	disclosure	is	from	pg.	27	of	its	FY
2006	10-K:


"...	We	generally	use	estimated	useful	lives	of	2	to	7	years	for	tractors	and	trailers..."


As	stated	above,	in	FY	2006,	the	Company	estimated	that	the	useful	life	of	its	tractors	and
trailers	was	between	2	years	and	7	years.	This	is	roughly	equivalent	to	the	estimates	of	3
years	(tractors)	to	7	years	(trailers)	that	CGI	was	using	in	Q1	2016.	For	some	odd	reason,
despite	using	roughly	the	same	estimates	for	many	years,	the	Company	felt	compelled	to
make	a	change	in	Q2	2016.


Also,	the	sheer	magnitude	of	the	change	made	by	CGI	to	its	useful	life	estimates	is	quite
puzzling.	The	Company	increased	the	useful	life	of	its	tractors	by	33%	and	its	trailers	by
43%.	I	find	it	hard	to	believe	that	the	Company	has	underestimated	the	useful	life	of	its
PP&E	by	such	a	large	amount	for	so	many	years.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 12/26


Finally,	the	timing	of	CGI's	revision	to	its	useful	life	estimates	is	quite	suspicious	when
taking	into	consideration	the	Company's	recent	alleged	PP&E	boosting.	As	I	previously
discussed,	it	appears	that	the	Company	may	have	begun	to	overstate	its	PP&E	in	Q2
2016.	Thus,	the	timing	of	CGI's	alleged	PP&E	boosting	coincides	with	the	Company's
decision	to	change	its	useful	life	estimates	(both	occurred	/	began	in	Q2	2016).	I	do	not
believe	this	is	merely	a	coincidence.	Instead,	I	believe	management	may	have
increased	its	useful	life	estimates	in	an	effort	to	help	mask	its	seemingly	overstated
PP&E	balance.


A	Quick	Overview	Of	The	Quality	Business


Many	of	the	discussions	over	the	next	few	sections	will	be	centered	around	the
Company's	Quality	division.	Thus,	before	continuing,	I	thought	it	would	be	helpful	to
provide	a	quick	overview	of	this	business.


Through	its	Quality	division,	CGI	provides	leasing	management	services	to	independent
contractors,	motor	carrier	fleets	and	financing	sources.	In	addition	to	leasing	management,
the	business	also	buys	trucks	in	bulk,	leases	them	and	then	sells	the	leased	trucks	for	a
profit.	For	the	past	two	years,	most	of	Quality's	profits	have	come	from	its	bulk	purchase
and	sale	activities.	Since	March	2014,	the	vast	majority	of	its	leased	trucks	have	been	sold
through	a	Program	and	Service	Agreement	with	Element.	Since	signing	this	agreement,
Quality	has	generated	total	net	sale	proceeds	of	$623	million	from	its	relationship	with
Element.


At	the	end	of	Q1	2016,	Element	halted	its	purchases	of	trucks	from	Quality.	In	response	to
this,	CGI	partnered	with	Larsen	MacColl	Partners	(a	private	equity	firm)	to	form	a	financing
entity	called	19th	Capital.	This	new	entity	was	funded	with	a	$2	million	equity	contribution
from	CGI	and	a	$4	million	contribution	from	Larsen	MacColl	Partners.	The	primary
purpose	of	19th	Capital's	establishment	was	to	provide	another	dedicated	buyer	for
Quality's	purchased	trucks.	Since	its	formation	in	late	September	2015,	Quality	has
generated	total	net	sale	proceeds	of	$49.4	million	from	19th	Capital.


CGI	May	Be	Misrepresenting	Its	Liabilities


In	addition	to	potentially	inflating	its	profits,	it	appears	that	CGI	may	also	be
misrepresenting	its	liabilities	by	a	meaningful	amount.	During	the	Company's	Q1
2016	earnings	call,	an	analyst	posed	the	following	question	to	management:



https://seekingalpha.com/article/3622196-celadon-groups-cgi-ceo-paul-will-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Strong Sell Due To Major Accounting Concerns, Misleading Behavior And Likely Insolvency - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 13/26


"And	then	one	of	your	quasi	competitors	was	out	and	they	were	talking	about	some
charges	that	they	were	taking	related	to	lease	guarantees.	And	maybe	if	you	can	get
people	comfortable	with	how	you	don't	have	exposure	related	to	residual	guarantees
on	some	of	the	equipment	that's	going	to	on	the	Quality	side?"


In	response	to	this	question,	management	stated	the	following:


"We	don't	have	any	residual	guarantees,	so	that's	not	an	issue...	we	don't	really	have
an	exposure	necessarily	to	a	declining	equipment	market."


Due	to	the	recent	downturn	in	the	trucking	industry,	truck	resale	values	have	declined	by	a
significant	amount.	This	decline	in	resale	values	has	led	some	of	CGI's	competitors	to	take
charges	for	residual	value	guarantees	on	their	leases.	In	contrast	to	its	competitors,	CGI
management	claims	that	the	Company	does	not	have	any	liability	exposure	to	declining
truck	values.	However,	based	on	information	available	in	the	Company's	public	filings,	this
claim	does	not	appear	to	be	true.


For	starters,	based	on	Quality's	reserve	account	agreements,	it	appears	that	CGI	/
Quality	may	have	to	reimburse	Element	and	19 	Capital	for	up	to	$67.3	million	of
losses	incurred	from	their	truck	purchases.	The	following	is	from	pg.	2	of	Quality's	Third
Amended	Reserve	Account	Agreement	with	Element:


"Seller	has	established	a	loss	pool	or	reserve	account	on	Seller's	balance	sheet	in
the	initial	amount	of	ten	percent	(10%)	of	the	Purchase	Price...	the	Reserve	Account
is	created	pursuant	to	this	Third	Amended	Agreement	to	establish	and	determine
Seller's	recourse	liability	to	Element	for	Element's	credit	and	asset	losses	under	the
Purchase	Agreement"


Under	the	terms	of	the	Reserve	Account	Agreement,	whenever	Element	purchases	a
truck	from	Quality,	Quality	must	establish	a	reserve	account	on	its	balance	sheet	in	the
amount	of	10%	of	the	purchase	price.	For	example,	if	Element	purchases	$100	million
worth	of	trucks	from	Quality,	then	Quality	must	add	$10	million	to	its	reserve	account.	If
Element	incurs	a	loss	of	$10	million	on	its	purchase,	Quality	will	reimburse	Element	for
this	entire	amount	via	the	reserve	account.	Quality's	potential	loss	liability	is	capped	at
10%	of	the	purchase	price.	Thus,	if	Element	incurs	a	loss	of	$20	million	on	its	purchase,
Quality	will	still	only	be	liable	for	$10	million	of	these	losses.

Quality's	reserve	account	agreement	with	19th	Capital	appears	to	be	similar	to	its
agreement	with	Element.	The	following	is	from	pg.	15	of	Quality's	Portfolio	Purchase	and
Sale	Agreement	with	19th	Capital:


"...	a	Reserve	Account	(the	"Reserve	Account")	in	the	amount	of	ten	percent	(10%)
of	the	Purchase	Price	shall	be	established	by	Seller	on	Seller's	balance	sheet..."


On	a	combined	basis,	Quality	has	received	total	net	sale	proceeds	of	$672.7	million	from
Element	($623.3	million)	and	19th	Capital	($49.4	million).	By	multiplying	total	sale
proceeds	(purchase	price)	of	$672.7	million	by	the	reserve	requirement	of	10%,	I	estimate
that	the	size	of	Quality's	reserve	account	is	$67.3	million.	Thus,	it	appears	that	Quality
may	have	up	to	$67.3	million	of	reserve	account	liabilities	which	are	not	being	accounted
for	on	CGI's	balance	sheet.


Given	the	recent	sharp	decline	in	resale	values	of	trucks,	I	believe	it	is	likely	that	most,	if
not	all,	of	CGI's	estimated	$67.3	million	reserve	account	will	be	paid	out	to	Element	and
19th	Capital.	Further	supporting	this	assertion	is	the	fact	that	Quality	recently	made	an
additional	$2.5	million	contribution	to	its	reserve	account	with	Element.	The	following
disclosure	is	from	CGI's	December	29th	Letter	Agreement	with	Element:


"Celadon/Quality	shall	contribute	additional	funds	to	the	existing	Reserve	Account...
in	order	to	bolster	the	reserves	available	with	respect	to	the	2014-2015	Vintage…
Celadon/Quality	will	contribute	an	additional	Two	Million	Five	Hundred	Thousand
Dollars	($2,500,000)	to	the	Reserve	Account	with	respect	to	the	2014-2015
Vintage..."


As	described	above,	CGI	/	Quality	agreed	to	increase	the	size	of	its	reserve	account	by
$2.5	million	in	relation	to	trucks	already	purchased	by	Element	in	2014	and	2015.	This
$2.5	million	contribution	was	in	addition	to	Quality's	initial	10%	contribution	to	the	2014
and	2015	reserve	account.	Based	on	this	additional	contribution,	it	appears	that	Element's
losses	for	its	2014	and	2015	purchases	have	already	exceeded	10%.	This	strongly
supports	my	assertion	that	most,	if	not	all,	of	CGI's	reserve	account	will	have	to	be	paid
out	to	Element	and	19th	Capital.


For	some	reason,	CGI	has	not	included	any	of	its	reserve	account	liabilities	on	its
balance	sheet.	This	seems	to	be	very	aggressive	given	that	most	if	not	all	of	the	reserve
account	will	likely	be	paid	out	to	Element	and	19th	Capital.	Therefore,	I	believe	the
Company's	balance	sheet	does	not	accurately	reflect	the	total	liabilities	of	the	business.

In	addition	to	CGI's	reserve	account	liabilities,	the	Company	also	has	a	growing	amount
of	potential	liabilities	related	to	their	operating	leases.	The	following	disclosure	is	from
pg.	23	of	CGI's	Q3	2016	10-Q:


"...	we	are	subject	to	the	risk	that	equipment	values	may	decline,	in	which	case	we
would	suffer	a	loss	upon	disposition	and	be	required	to	make	cash	payments
because	of	the	residual	value	guarantees.	At	March	31,	2016,	we	were	obligated	for
residual	value	guarantees	related	to	operating	leases	of	$49.0	million..."


The	residual	value	guarantees	on	CGI's	operating	leases	have	increased	from	just
$6.0	million	in	Q1	2016	to	$34.0	million	in	Q2	2016	to	$49.0	million	in	Q3	2016.	Thus,
in	the	span	of	six	months,	the	Company's	residual	value	guarantees	have	increased	by
$43	million.	It	is	hard	to	say	what	amount	of	this	residual	guarantee	will	eventually	become
a	liability	for	CGI.	However,	the	fact	that	its	residual	guarantees	keep	growing	at	such	a
fast	rate	is	concerning	and	suggests	that	the	eventual	liabilities	could	be	significant	in	the
future.


In	summary,	I	am	not	sure	why	management	claimed	that	the	Company	does	not	have
any	liability	exposure	to	declining	truck	values.	CGI's	reserve	account	liabilities	and
residual	value	guarantees	are	both	directly	affected	by	truck	resale	values.	At	the	moment,
the	Company	has	over	$67	million	of	potential	reserve	account	liabilities	which	are	not
being	accounted	for	in	its	balance	sheet.	Due	to	the	recent	decline	in	truck	values,	it	is
likely	that	most,	if	not	all,	of	CGI's	reserve	account	will	be	paid	out	to	Element	and	19th
Capital.	In	addition	to	this,	CGI	has	$49	million	of	residual	value	guarantees	related	to	its
operating	leases.	These	will	likely	also	become	a	liability	for	the	business	if	truck	values
continue	to	decline.	Overall,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	liabilities	are	meaningfully
higher	than	what	has	been	portrayed	to	investors.	The	Company's	misrepresentation	of	its
liabilities	is	further	evidence	that	CGI	has	grossly	misrepresented	its	current	financial
situation	to	investors.


CGI's	Precarious	Covenant	Situation


So	what	would	motivate	management	to	potentially	inflate	CGI's	profits	and
understate	its	liabilities?	To	begin	with	the	obvious,	management	may	be	trying	to	hide
the	significant	deterioration	in	the	Company's	financial	situation	from	investors.	Another
reason	may	be	that,	without	doing	so,	the	Company	would	have	likely	violated	its
maximum	leverage	ratio	covenant.	On	pg.	70	of	CGI's	credit	agreement,	the	maximum
leverage	ratio	covenant	is	defined	as	follows:

does	not	appear	to	have	much	cushion	remaining	under	this	covenant.	If	LTM	EBITDAR
declines	by	$15.6	million	or	total	debt	increases	by	$62.5	million,	the	Company	will	be	in
violation	of	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.


The	Company's	tight	covenant	situation	(as	shown	in	the	"Reported"	column)	shows	why
management	may	have	been	motivated	to	misrepresent	its	financial	performance	over	the
past	two	quarters.	In	the	"Adjusted"	column	in	the	above	table,	I	have	provided	my
estimate	of	CGI's	leverage	ratio	after	adjusting	for	$67.3	million	of	reserve	account
liabilities	and	$18	million	of	potentially	overstated	Q3	2016	profits	(representing	a	pre-tax
deduction	of	$27.7	million	to	EBITDAR).	Based	on	these	adjusted	numbers,	I	calculate
that	CGI's	Q3	2016	leverage	ratio	would	have	been	4.9x.	Thus,	on	an	adjusted	basis,
the	Company	would	have	been	in	violation	of	its	4x	max	leverage	ratio	covenant.


Auditor	Change	In	Late	2013	Is	Another	Red	Flag


In	October	2013,	CGI	changed	its	auditor	from	KPMG	to	BKD.	BKD	is	a	boutique
accounting	firm	which,	as	of	2014,	served	as	auditor	for	just	48	public	company	clients.	By
contrast,	as	of	2014,	KPMG	was	the	auditor	for	692	public	company	clients.	Prior	to
KPMG,	CGI	had	used	Ernst	&	Young	as	its	auditor.


In	isolation,	CGI's	use	of	a	boutique	audit	firm	would	not	be	very	alarming.	However,	given
the	accounting	irregularities	I	have	highlighted,	the	Company's	decision	to	hire
BKD	after	using	Big	Four	auditors	for	many	years	becomes	more	concerning.
Typically,	Big	Four	firms	attract	the	best	talent	and	generally	provide	high-quality	audit
services.	I	do	not	know	if	the	same	applies	to	BKD,	because	their	reputation	as	an	auditor
is	not	as	well	known.	Overall,	CGI's	use	of	BKD	does	little	to	reassure	investors	about	the
integrity	of	its	financial	statements.


CGI's	Financial	Performance	Will	Continue	To	Be	Pressured


Unfortunately	for	CGI,	it	does	not	appear	that	the	Company's	financial	situation	will
improve	anytime	soon.	According	to	recent	reports,	the	challenging	conditions	in	the
trucking	industry	are	likely	to	persist	for	a	while.	For	example,	in	a	February	2016	report,
an	analyst	at	JPMorgan	stated	the	following	about	the	trucking	sector:


"...	the	truckload	sector	faces	a	broadly	negative	2016	fundamental	outlook	and
expects	to	drive	the	first	contraction	in	realized	revenue	per	loaded	mile	(ex-fuel)
since	2007...	We	recommend	caution	on	the	stocks	and	forecast	a	deeper-than-
expected	2016	EPS	trough	and	slower	2017	recovery	relative	to	consensus
estimates..."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 18/26


Based	on	the	quote	above,	it	appears	that	a	meaningful	recovery	in	the	trucking	industry
may	not	happen	until	after	2017.	Also,	just	a	few	days	ago,	on	June	21st,	Werner
Enterprises	(NASDAQ:WERN)	lowered	its	Q2	earnings	estimate	to	an	expected	range	of
$0.21-0.25	per	share.	This	was	37.5-47.5%	lower	than	the	consensus	analyst	estimate	of
$0.40	for	the	quarter.	A	recent	Wall	Street	Journal	article	discussed	some	of	the	negative
ramifications	of	WERN's	downward	earnings	revision:


"...	forecasts	like	Werner's	raise	concerns	that	it	will	likely	take	months	or	even	years
for	supply	and	demand	to	come	back	into	balance...	The	second	quarter	is	typically
the	strongest	for	trucking	companies,	so	Werner's	negative	outlook	is	particularly
worrying...	It	also	points	to	weakness	in	the	spot	market	is	spreading	to	long-term
freight	contract	rates,	where	large	trucking	companies	generate	the	bulk	of	their
profits.	That	could	signal	a	prolonged	slump	for	the	industry."


In	addition	to	WERN,	Covenant	Transportation	Group	(NASDAQ:CVTI)	also	announced
that	it	was	lowering	its	Q2	earnings	guidance	from	$0.28-0.33	per	share	to	$0.17-0.23	per
share.	Overall,	the	recent	earnings	revisions	by	WERN	and	CVTI	are	another	strong
indication	that	a	recovery	in	the	trucking	market	is	still	far	away.


In	addition	to	dealing	with	a	prolonged	industry	slowdown,	CGI	must	also	contend	with	the
fact	that	it	is	in	a	very	challenged	competitive	position.	To	help	illustrate	the	Company's
weak	competitive	position,	I	have	provided	the	following	comparable	analysis:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 19/26


Typically,	in	an	industry	downturn,	the	companies	that	survive	and	eventually	gain	market
share	in	a	recovery	are	those	with	the	highest	margins	and	the	healthiest	balance	sheets.
As	shown	in	the	comparable	analysis	above,	CGI	has	the	most	leverage	(3.6x	versus	0.7x
industry	average)	and	lowest	operating	margin	(4.4%	versus	9.5%	industry	average)	in
comparison	to	its	peer	group.	Given	CGI's	much	lower	margins	and	significantly	higher
leverage	than	its	competitors,	it	will	be	tough	for	the	Company	to	compete	and	survive	in	a
market	of	declining	volumes	and	pricing.	This	further	supports	my	belief	that	its	financial
position	will	continue	to	deteriorate	over	the	next	couple	years.


Eventual	Bankruptcy	Appears	To	Be	Likely


For	a	number	of	reasons,	it	appears	that	CGI	is	at	high	risk	of	eventually	becoming
insolvent.	For	starters,	if	it	has	reported	overstated	profits	over	the	past	two	quarters,	this
could	push	the	Company	into	a	premature	bankruptcy	filing.	Under	the	"Event	of	Default
and	Remedies"	section	of	CGI's	credit	agreement,	the	following	is	stated:


"Any	of	the	following	shall	constitute	an	Event	of	Default...	Any	representation,
warranty,	certification	or	statement	of	fact	made	or	deemed	made	by	or	on	behalf	of
Borrower	or	any	other	Loan	Party	herein,	in	any	other	Loan	Document,	or	in	any
document	delivered	in	connection	herewith	or	therewith	shall	be	incorrect	or
misleading	when	made	or	deemed	made"


Based	on	the	terms	of	the	credit	agreement,	providing	incorrect	or	misleading	financial
information	to	lenders	constitutes	an	event	of	default.	Thus,	if	CGI	has	overstated	its
profits,	then	the	Company	will	be	in	default	on	its	loan.	Such	a	default	would	likely	lead	to
a	bankruptcy	filing	by	CGI,	given	that	the	lenders	are	unlikely	to	negotiate	around	such	an
egregious	violation.	An	SEC	investigation	of	CGI	could	also	follow.


In	addition	to	its	accounting	and	financial	reporting	issues,	the	unfavorable	industry
environment	will	make	it	very	difficult	for	the	Company	to	meet	its	debt	and	lease
obligations	over	the	next	two	years.	As	of	Q3	2016,	CGI	has	$579.8	million	of	debt,	capital
lease	and	operating	lease	obligations.	If	its	potential	reserve	account	liabilities	are
included,	then	the	Company	currently	has	$647.1	million	of	obligations	on	its	books.	At	the
same	time,	the	recent	trucking	downturn	has	greatly	reduced	CGI's	profitability	and	cash
flows.	In	Q3	2016,	the	Company	reported	deeply	negative	operating	cash	flow	of	-$18.4
million.	Through	the	first	nine	months	of	2016,	it	generated	just	$4	million	of	operating
cash	flow.	If	CGI's	performance	stays	at	the	current	level	or	deteriorates	further,	it	will	be
very	difficult	for	the	Company	to	stay	solvent.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 20/26


Further	exacerbating	the	Company's	liquidity	issues	is	its	challenging	covenant	situation.
As	I	calculated	previously,	the	Company	has	just	$62.5	million	of	debt	cushion	remaining
under	its	4x	maximum	leverage	ratio	covenant.	Thus,	unless	CGI	can	somehow
renegotiate	its	covenants,	the	Company's	ability	to	borrow	money	will	be	limited.	Also,	if	its
financial	performance	continues	to	decline,	then	the	Company	will	most	likely	violate	its
leverage	ratio	covenant.	The	curative	actions	required	to	fix	this	technical	default	could
place	further	pressure	on	its	liquidity.


Some	investors	are	hoping	that	CGI	can	quickly	sell	off	the	$135	million	of	Quality	trucks
held	for	sale	on	its	balance	sheet.	By	doing	so,	the	Company	would	gain	some	much-
needed	liquidity	and	covenant	relief.	Unfortunately,	based	on	recent	developments	and
disclosures,	it	appears	that	finding	a	buyer	for	these	trucks	may	prove	to	be	very	difficult.
As	I	mentioned	previously,	Element	has	not	purchased	any	trucks	from	Quality	since	the
end	of	Q1	2016.	Unfortunately	for	CGI,	it	appears	that	the	recently	formed	19th	Capital
has	also	halted	its	purchases	as	well.	The	following	disclosure	is	from	pg.	13	of	the
Company's	Q3	2016	10-Q:


"Under	the	Portfolio	Purchase	and	Sale	Agreement,	19th	Capital	purchased
portfolios	of	Quality's	independent	contractor	leases	and	associated	assets.	The	net
sales	proceeds	of	units	total	$49.4	million	for	the	nine	months	ended	March	31,
2016...	There	were	no	sales	in	the	three	months	ended	March	31,	2016."


In	Q3	2016,	19th	Capital	did	not	make	any	purchases	from	Quality.	I	suspect	both	Element
and	19th	Capital	(Larsen	MacColl	Partners)	have	halted	their	purchases	in	order	to	avoid
further	exposure	to	the	declining	truck	market.	Thus,	at	the	moment,	it	appears	that
Quality	does	not	have	a	dedicated	buyer	for	its	trucks.	Without	a	dedicated	buyer,	it	will	be
difficult	for	Quality	to	efficiently	dispose	of	its	trucks	in	what	is	an	oversupplied	market.


A	few	months	ago,	management	expressed	confidence	in	its	ability	to	quickly	dispose	of
the	Quality	trucks.	The	following	quote	from	management	is	from	CGI's	Q2	2016	earnings
call:


"Leased	assets	and	assets	held	for	resale	represented	approximately	$130	million	in
this	December	quarter,	compared	to	the	September	quarter	of	approximately	$175
million.	We	expect	to	dispose	of	this	equipment	over	the	next	six	months."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 21/26


As	stated	above,	at	the	end	of	Q2	2016,	management	expected	to	dispose	of	its	Quality
assets	held	for	sale	within	six	months.	However,	from	Q2	2016	to	Q3	2016,	CGI's	Quality
assets	held	for	sale	actually	increased	from	$130.3	million	to	$135.2	million.	In	addition	to
this,	the	following	disclosure	regarding	Quality	was	added	to	the	Company's	Q2	2016	10-
Q:


"Quality's	business	has	grown	rapidly,	but	the	rate	of	growth	has	recently	slowed	and
is	expected	to	remain	constrained	in	the	near	future	due	to	lower	amounts	of
purchases	by	our	funding	sources."


This	cautionary	disclosure,	along	with	the	halting	of	purchases	by	Quality's	funding
sources	and	recent	increase	in	assets	held	for	sale,	strongly	indicates	that	CGI	will	have
difficulty	in	selling	off	its	Quality	assets.	Thus,	investors	who	are	hoping	that	CGI	will	be
able	to	significantly	boost	its	liquidity	via	Quality	asset	sales	may	be	disappointed.


Valuation


I	believe	CGI	is	significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price	of	$10.39.	If	the
Company	has,	in	fact,	reported	overstated	profits	and	understated	its	liabilities,	then	this
could	lead	to	an	SEC	investigation	and	a	likely	bankruptcy	filing.	In	addition	to	this,	the
Company	will	likely	struggle	to	survive	this	industry	downturn	due	to	its	overleveraged
balance	sheet,	weak	competitive	position,	and	difficult	covenant	situation.	Based	on	all	of
these	red	flags,	I	believe	CGI	should	trade	at	a	multiple	reflective	of	a	business	with	major
financial	reporting	concerns	/	high	insolvency	risk.


In	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	CGI	reported	a	combined	total	of	$0.43	in	diluted	EPS.
However,	the	Company's	EPS	results	over	the	past	two	quarters	were	artificially	boosted
by	a	combined	total	of	$0.12	due	to	a	large	increase	in	PP&E	useful	life	estimates.	As	I
have	discussed	previously,	I	believe	this	useful	life	estimate	change	was	highly
questionable	and	likely	overly	aggressive.	In	order	to	calculate	a	normalized	EPS	figure,	I
believe	the	increase	in	EPS	associated	with	this	useful	life	change	should	be	backed	out.
With	this	in	mind,	I	have	provided	below	my	estimate	of	the	Company's	normalized	EPS
on	a	run-rate	basis:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3986225-celadon-group-strong-sell-due-major-accounting-concerns-misleading-behavior-likely-insolvency 22/26


As	I	stated	at	the	beginning	of	this	section,	I	believe	CGI	should	trade	at	a	multiple
reflective	of	a	business	with	financial	reporting	issues	/	insolvency	concerns.	Typically,
companies	with	such	issues	trade	at	a	P/E	multiple	in	the	low-to-mid	single	digits.	For
example,	Net1	UEPS	Technologies	(NASDAQ:UEPS)	is	a	company	that	has	been	dogged
by	numerous	allegations	of	misleading	financial	reporting	and	unethical	behavior	(as	I
have	written	about	in	the	past).	Currently,	UEPS	trades	at	a	P/E	multiple	of	around	5x.	I
believe	CGI	should	trade	at	similarly	low	P/E	multiple.	Thus,	I	have	assumed	that	CGI
shares	should	trade	at	5x	my	normalized	run-rate	EPS	figure	of	$0.62.	Note	that	I	have
not	deducted	the	$18	million	of	potentially	overstated	Q3	2016	profits	from	my	run-rate
EPS	figure.	Instead,	I	have	priced	in	this	risk	into	my	low	valuation	multiple.


Applying	a	5x	multiple	to	normalized	run-rate	EPS	estimate	of	$0.62,	I	estimate	that	fair
value	for	CGI	shares	is	$3.10.	This	represents	a	62%	discount	from	the	Company's
current	share	price	of	$8.25	(as	of	7/1/16).	If	it	is	eventually	proven	that	CGI	has
overstated	its	profits,	or	if	the	Company	eventually	files	for	bankruptcy,	then	the	equity	will
likely	become	worthless.


My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	quickly	note	that	I	sent	an	email	to	CGI's	Investor	Relations	team,	asking
them	to	address	the	key	issues	brought	up	in	this	article.	I	will	provide	an	update	in	the
comments	section	if	I	receive	any	meaningful	new	information	from	the	Company.


Conclusion


The	fact	that	CGI	appears	to	have	grossly	misrepresented	its	financial	performance	to
investors	should	be	reason	enough	to	warrant	a	significant	correction	in	the	shares.	When
the	Company's	overleveraged	balance	sheet,	deteriorating	financial	performance,	and
challenging	covenant	situation	are	added	to	the	mix,	then	I	simply	see	no	reason	to	own
the	shares	at	any	price.	Overall,	I	believe	that	CGI	is	one	of	the	best	short	opportunities	I
have	come	across	this	year.	Thus,	I	recommend	shorting	CGI	or	selling	the	shares	if	you
are	an	existing	shareholder.

Highlighted	in	red	boxes	above	are	all	of	the	working	capital	items	that	the	Company
includes	in	its	calculation	of	operating	cash	flow.	Using	the	highlighted	items	in	Figure	1,	I
have	provided	below	a	summary	of	the	changes	in	working	capital	on	the	balance	sheet
from	Q2	2016	to	Q3	2016.	I	have	labeled	this	figure	as	"Figure	2"	for	discussion	purposes.

For	simplification	purposes,	I	have	grouped	the	individual	working	capital	items	on	the
balance	sheet	in	Figure	1	into	different	buckets	via	the	"Label"	column.	This	"Label"	is
used	to	group	different	line	items	in	Figure	1	into	a	consolidated	line	item	in	Figure	2.	For
example,	any	line	item	labeled	as	"E."	in	Figure	1	are	included	in	the	"Tires	In	Service"	line
item	in	Figure	2.	As	another	example,	any	item	labeled	as	"I."	in	Figure	1	are	included	in
the	"Accounts	Payable	and	Accrued	Expenses"	line	item	in	Figure	2.	As	shown	in	Figure
2	above,	based	on	the	changes	in	working	capital	on	CGI's	balance	sheet,	the
Company	reported	an	increase	in	net	working	capital	of	$24.1	million	from	Q2	2016
to	Q3	2016.


With	regard	to	CGI's	cash	flow	statement,	I	have	provided	below	a	figure	which	calculates
the	working	capital	changes	in	the	Company's	Q3	2016	operating	cash	flow	statement:


Although	CGI	only	provides	a	YTD	cash	flow	statement,	I	was	able	to	derive	the	Q3	2016
cash	flow	figures	by	subtracting	YTD	Q2	2016	from	YTD	Q3	2016.	As	shown	in	the	far-
right	column	in	Figure	3,	the	Company	reported	a	cash	reduction	of	$42.0	million	in	Q3

2016	due	to	changes	in	working	capital.	Thus,	CGI's	operating	cash	flow	statement
reflects	a	$42.0	million	increase	in	total	net	working	capital	from	Q2	2016	to	Q3
2016.

KnockOut
This	is	by	far	the	best	piece	of	analysis	I've	seen	on	Seeking	Alpha.	Stunningly	detailed	and	very	well	constructed.	I
work	in	Finance	for	a	trucking	company,	so	am	very	familiar	with	the	concepts	discussed.	While	the	analysis	is
excellent,	I	believe	the	conclusions	are	overstated.	While	the	timing	of	the	adjustment	to	the	useful	lives	of	tractors
and	trailers	is	suspicious,	4	years	for	tractors	and	10	years	for	trailers	is	not	unreasonable.	Further,	while	certainly
challenged	from	a	covenant	standpoint,	a	violation	does	not	spell	doom.	CGI	has	a	long	way	to	go	before	they
become	insolvent.	I	believe	they	will	get	things	figured	out	long	before	that	happens,	but	the	stock	price	could	slide	in
the	meantime.
