Odyssey Marine Exploration Prepares To Exit Core Shipwreck
Business, Cash Burn Continues
Dec. 7, 2015 8:30 AM ET112 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


Most recent 10Q filed November 6 had an attachment for a new $2mm "advance"
loan with "In-Kind Satisfaction".


This "In-Kind Satisfaction" transfers the majority of the shipwreck business in
exchange for paying off a fraction of existing company debts.


This appears to be a desperate move to fund the company for perhaps another
couple months of cash burn while giving up almost all upside.


10Q also includes: "Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at September 30,
2015, was $1.8 million, which is insufficient to support operations through the end of
2015.".


Protests in Mexico continue against Don Diego phosphate mining project that would
environmentally impact 15,000 fishermen while creating only 80 jobs.


After the announcement of the MINOSA loan to Odyssey Marine (NASDAQ:OMEX) to
avoid bankruptcy in March 2015, we speculated that the new investors would seek to exit
the shipwreck business. However, CEO Mark Gordon assured investors that the
shipwreck business would continue and provide a solid foundation to enable even grander
speculations by being the first in undersea mining projects. OMEX has repeatedly
reiterated their steady pipeline of commodity shipwrecks as well as rarer but potentially
more valuable historic shipwrecks such as the HMS Victory, which we have not heard an
update on for some time.


What does CEO Mark Gordon say about the shipwreck business?


While collecting his $1.4m+ in annual compensation, OMEX's CEO Marc Gordon has
repeatedly reassured investors they are committed to the shipwreck recovery business
and were in it for the long haul:

"As I stated before, we don't plan to abandon our shipwreck roots and in keeping
with our pledged to bring more financial discipline to our business, we're developing
a potential multi-year shipwreck program utilizing external project level funding that
improves our risks and reward profile, while still allowing our investors to benefit
from our large portfolio of attractive shipwreck projects."


"we have amazing operational capabilities and an extensive portfolio of attractive
mineral and shipwreck projects that we can go prosecute. "


Q1 2015


We're going to continue to do shipwrecks


"I want to be clear that we're not abandoning our shipwreck roots. "


"We plan to focus on projects that will be fruitful for the company and our
shareholders."


Q4 2014


"We found more shipwrecks than any other entity in history and recovered more
valuable goods from shipwrecks than all previous records shipwreck recovery
operations."


"We are not abandoning our shipwreck roots"


"We look forward to fulfilling the commitments made to the Maritime Heritage
Foundation and the U.K. government in regards to the Victory project."


"Unidentified Analyst: Is OMEX exiting the treasure hunting business?"


Mark Gordon - President and CEO


Well, I have to start to answer that question by saying OMEX has never been in the
treasure hunting business. We are in the archaeological sensitive shipwreck
recovery business for historic shipwrecks. And we do plan as I've mentioned
several times to stay in that business, most notably with the HMS Victory project
as our most exciting near-term historic shipwreck to work on.


Q2 2014


"our future shipwreck projects can generate significant cash and profits, not only on
a standalone project basis, but on a recurring annual consolidated company basis."

Now OMEX is backtracking? Desperate exit from ship wreck business is
imminent….


On November 6, OMEX filed its most recent 10Q without hosting a conference call - a first
since our initial report catalyzed quarterly conference calls starting two years ago.


Other than the balance sheet disclosures below - the most interesting highlight of the 10Q
was the loan agreement attached to it. OMEX has fully tapped out its first MINOSA
$14.75mm loan and unless it receives environmental approval by SEMARNAT it cannot
access any more cash from them. So OMEX borrowed another $1mm (with another
$1mm potentially for December 1 which has passed) pursuant to the agreement.


This loan seems to be setting up for an exit from the shipwreck business based on a
reading of the section 6 and the language used: "advance" payment. This appears to
allow OMEX to repay the loan as well as their Fifth Third Bank debt ($3mm for SS
Republic coins and $7mm for the SS Central America - assumed by [***] below) in
exchange for a list of assets that include the assets secured by the Bank loan plus
Neptune Minerals shares and receivables.


Basically OMEX appears to be giving away any upside potential from the SS Central
America (which is still tied up in court) in exchange for whatever proceeds Monaco offers
them. For those out there who speculated the SSCA project could potentially bring in
$40mm (vs the $7mm loan from Fifth Third so far) - this is the moment of truth.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3737486-odyssey-marine-exploration-prepares-exit-core-shipwreck-business-cash-burn-continues 4/35


Section 6.1. Right to In-Kind Satisfaction. If, and only if, (A) Monaco delivers a
Second Advance Notice to Odyssey during the Election Period and (B) such Second
Advance Notice states that


that Monaco desires for Odyssey to satisfy the Loan in-kind in accordance with this
Section 6, and (C) all amounts outstanding due from Odyssey to the Bank have
been paid in full (which condition is for the third party benefit of the Bank and may
not be waived by Odyssey or Monaco), then on the In-Kind Payment Date:


subject to Monaco's fulfillment of its obligations under Section 6.1, Odyssey shall
assign, convey, or otherwise transfer to Monaco:


((i)):all of Odyssey's rights under the [***], and other transferable rights, to the extent
assignable, or a beneficial interest therein;


(ii): all the Seated Liberty Half Dollar coins (approximately 19,000 coins) owned by
Odyssey and recovered by Odyssey from the SS Republic shipwreck (the "Republic
Coins");


((iii)): one-half of Odyssey's equity interest in Neptune Minerals(Odyssey's entire
equity interest consists of 6,184,976 of Class B Common non-voting shares and
5,225 Series A Preferred non-voting shares); and


(iv): one-half of the receivables owed to Odyssey by Neptune Minerals, which one-
half equals $2,500,000 plus any accrued interest, along with any rights which attach
to those receivables; and


subject to Odyssey's fulfillment of its obligations under Section 6.1, Monaco shall:
repay or provide for Odyssey's repayment of all indebtedness that is owed to the
Bank.


Fifth Third bank has two loans to OMEX both due December 17, 2015, less than two
weeks away. The maturity date on this new Monaco loan or "advance" payment is
December 18, 2015, so we should see some action soon.

Why is Monaco doing this advance?


The timing of this advance is interesting as without the $1mm on November 1, OMEX
would have likely run out of their $1.8mm cash stores and been forced to potentially
declare bankruptcy by the end of November. Monaco has an unsecured junior promissory
note, which tend to be subordinated to any secured notes (such as Minosa's) in a
bankruptcy process - so Monaco would want to avoid holding that bag in court given they
are owed over $10mm. Legal and administrative fees of a bankruptcy would take priority
and potentially leave the $10mm with a claim on nothing of value at the end.


It seems likely that at a minimum the 20k SS Republic coins and claims on the SS Central
America are worth the $10mm secured bank debt on them. Some have argued that
OMEX's share of the SS Central America claim could be worth $30mm+ (We estimate
closer to max $12mm).

If you believe that these assets have value then Monaco may be trying to grab the
valuable assets it can from OMEX before the ship of a company sinks into potential
bankruptcy and its ability to seize assets become subject to court process and approval. If
the SSCA claim turns out to be worth a substantial amount, Monaco may even make a
profit out of this whole endeavor.


The problem with this approach is that if indeed OMEX does file bankruptcy then a
transfer of valuable assets shortly before to a junior creditor (and Monaco's loans are
more junior than the Minosa loan) may be considered fraudulent conveyance to the
bankruptcy court and a violation of the waterfall priority to the bankruptcy process and
may be able to be reversed by the court. To be clear, there is nothing illegal per se about
this tactical approach, indeed it is common in the world of savvy distressed lenders.


Is Monaco now playing Pirate to OMEX's sinking ship, grabbing the coins before the ship
goes to the distant depths of the bankruptcy process? Was this their plan all along?


OMEX balance sheet update:


OMEX recently shared their own views on the viability of their company in the latest 10q
and it does not look good - as OMEX's 10Q says:


"Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at September 30, 2015 was $1.8
million which is insufficient to support operations through the end of 2015"


I have shared my updated "OMEX (in)solvency" model below to show why OMEX includes
this disclosure. As you can see, OMEX continues their dangerous dance with near term
bankruptcy. I estimate OMEX monthly cash burn is approximately $1.5m. How will OMEX
get yet another cash infusion if it has no more assets to borrow against?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3737486-odyssey-marine-exploration-prepares-exit-core-shipwreck-business-cash-burn-continues 7/35


How will they have enough cash to pay off the other $10mm Monaco debt due in
approximately 6 months or the Minosa $14.75mm debt due March 30, 2016? Even if
Minosa chose to exercise their $40mm option to buy all OMEX's Oceanica/Don Diego
stake that would leave OMEX with virtually zero assets and little cash. Given OMEX's
precarious financial condition I do not see how OMEX will be able to avoid being forced
out of the shipwreck business as Monaco holds all the negotiating power at this table.


Despite all of this horrific information, somehow OMEX still today trades at $0.30 per
share which implies an enterprise value of nearly $80mm!


Is there really nothing else better investors could buy for $80mm?


Protests continue for Don Diego, while everything hinges on unprecedented
environmental approval

According to local news sources, including Excelsior and BCS Noticias, Don Diego does
not have the Governor of Baja, Mendoza Davis's support. The reason OMEX gave for
withdrawing the EIA the last time earlier this year was that they were waiting for a new
government to be in place that would be more supportive. Mendoza Davis was elected
and assumed office September 2015 so this strategy does not appear to be working for
OMEX. We still expect the unprecedented "Don Diego" project to be either outright denied
(as appeared to occur with SEMARNAT June 22 this year when OMEX withdrew the EIA
immediately before the ruling deadline) or postponed endlessly until OMEX runs out of
cash and either gives up or goes bankrupt.


Is OMEX trying to shift its business model into a pure-play undersea mining
speculation like their investment in Chatham Rock Phosphate (CRP.NZ)?


Stay tuned - there is sure to be news and positive spin from OMEX on how this desperate
and forced exit from the shipwreck business is actually a great positive step! OMEX
management continues to collect their plump compensation packages while cash burn
continues and OMEX has not articulated any clear pathway to profitability.


Given that OMEX shareholders own the stock for the shipwreck story and excitement I do
not expect they will receive the news well of OMEX's forced exit from this line of business
of gold coins at $4000 an oz to the decidedly less glamorous world of mining phosphate at
~$100 per ton.


Fool me once, shame on you


Fool me twice, shame on me

Given the track record in Meson's long positions (HH is newest huge mistake) I doubt they have the cash to cover.


I would ask this, how can Meson say out o one side of the mouth that Gordon comp is 1.4+ MM (1+MM of which is in

I would argue that Mark Gordon has been hinting at a shift away from the shipwreck business for almost a year. Ryan
"forgot" to include the lead in to this quote from Gordon on the 1Q call in his article, "We believe seafloor mineral
exploration is where the best opportunities lie for our company in the future. I want to be clear that we’re not
abandoning our shipwreck roots. However, a successful mineral project can be worth many multiples of even the most
valuable shipwreck project."


Do any of us know that the deal with Monaco implies that omex is abandoning the shipwreck business? Could it be
that the company will retain an interest in this business going forward?

According to Odyssey, they were hired for contract services, must be at a day rate or there would have been

Perhaps they are trying to work off the Fraser $1.2M due by Dec 31.

You state:" Protests in Mexico continue against Don Diego phosphate mining project that would environmentally
impact 15,000 fishermen while creating only 80 jobs."


But you didn't really follow up. How and to what degree is the Don Diego project going to "environmentally impact
15000 fishermen?" It is very convenient for you and others to use blanket statements like that without providing
scientific backup. Hey, air traffic in NYC environmentally impacts 8 million New Yorkers every day. 
Furthermore, if the DD project were to get the green light, there would be more than 80 jobs created. You need to
include the mid and downstream business (jobs) portion of the processing that all the Don Diego phosphate would
generate as a knock on effect. Yes, they wouldn't be employed by Oceanica, but several hundred, if not thousands of
jobs would be created and maintained for a generation(s), not to mention the massive royalties that the project would
bring to the local and federal government , which would eclipse anything the 15000 fishermen could ever generate.


In addition, can you name a massive construction or mining project anywhere in free world, where there weren't
protests?  
I live in NYC and no one, besides the real estate developers and construction workers, wants one 80 story condo built
after another, but those #$#$#$ are going up like weeds.


Odyssey isn't exiting the shipwreck business, but they are obviously rethinking how they want to approach it and the
capital they want to commit to it in the future. 
If Don Diego gets approved, no one will ever care that much for that business anyway. It might be an interesting
distraction and with financial resources post DD approval, OMEX will be able to pick and choose their projects and be
able to easily finance the most lucrative ones.

Bulldog... Have you seen any updates for DD? Or any timelines? What about the reverse split? I would think

company has a good opportunity if any of their projects would pass.

Note that the state of BCS has an annual catch of approximately $20mn per year. I'm not sure how much of
that comes from the Bay of Ulloa, but let's be generous and say half of it or $10mn per year.


At the proposed small scale operation, Don Diego would generate over $300mn in revenue. If we assume
$150mn in EBITDA and a 7.5% royalty, then DD creates a royalty stream of $11.25mn per year. This could
double or triple over time. So, the royalty from DD would be larger than the total revenue produced by the
fishing industry in the area.


Somewhere between 50-90% of that royalty is going to local governments. The local governments know that
DD won't cause any job loss to fishermen, just as other dredging projects have not wiped out the fishing
industries where they are practiced. It's simply not an either or decision. It's a decision about economics, and
the amount of revenue this project will bring local communities in BCS is a very big deal.

IF Don Diego is approved, so what, it means little for Odyssey. At best, they get paid $40M for the 54%. Any
upside or profit is to Minosa, not Odyssey, they are the former owners. 
Meson is correct, $40M potential, but out of that, they must pay off Monaco $10M+, pay off MINOSA
$14.75M+, and payoff the $8.4M+ on the lien, or about $34M. That leaves a net gain of Odyssey for
operations of about $6M. Exactly how will a $6M gain, given that it has taken at least 2 years of managerial
expenses and other costs, be translated to a gain in the shareprice and keep them going as a concern? Just
like the Gairsoppa, with the year end claim of $25M in the bank, yet at 1Q, it was all gone when expenses
were paid? (obfuscating the $27M investment add from MAKO)


Don't forget that all of the deadlines in the deals have past, so a 'commitment' to finance means little, as
noted by the Oceanica 'deals', while set at $2.50, very few shares were ever sold at that price.


There is this to remember from the Q:


"The debt agreement did not contain any embedded terms or features that have characteristics of derivatives.
The Oceanica Call Option is considered a freestanding financial instrument because it is both (i) legally
detachable and (ii) separately exercisable."


So please don't even try to say that the call option is part of the SPA.


Odyssey themselves, in the MIA, stated it would create 80 jobs, anything else is pure speculation.


Why didn't Odyssey provide the full production stream? The production stream ends at the barge, providing a
low grade material which is useless for agriculture without processing. Why no transport costs, offloading, or
processing costs? Was it because the costs of those items make the product not financially viable? Where is
the end user input, other than the $80/ton, that the product can be sold for? 
As an 'investor', shouldn't you know this from the Company?


Odyssey may have been in the shipwreck search business to churn money, but never successfully monetized
a recovery. Everything 'found' was paid for, save for perhaps the Victory, but then again, how well has that
gone?

As noted in this article, investors had the idea that Odyssey was a Treasure Hunting venture, and invested in
that 'dream'. Odyssey did everything they could to promote that to lure in $$$.


For your entertainment, I will leave you with this from the CC:


"Is OMEX exiting the treasure hunting business?"


Mark Gordon - President and CEO 
"Well, I have to start to answer that question by saying OMEX has never been in the treasure hunting
business...."


But...


"Odyssey's SHIPWRECK! Pirates & Treasure appeals to the universal fascination with shipwrecks, pirate lore
and sunken treasure."

"Somewhere between 50-90% of that royalty is going to local governments."


Is there any substantiation to any of your numbers?


So the royalty is more than the environmental impact? This is beside the simple facts that virtually every
single governmental agency, local and regional governments, and a host of environmental interests have
recommended denial of the permit?


This is the Pacific Ocean, and no one cares about Odyssey, the gringos, and their promises of jobs and
money. They have heard it all before.


You need to beat a different drum.

What doesn't make sense is that Morris has long claimed the ship wreck business was horrible and OMEX should not
be in it. Why would this not then be a bullish post. If they are able to lose that business while maintaining contract
work as salvors, paid work, and dramatically cutting the burn it would be a huge win

The day rate does not pay the bills, nor the massive debt. Did you buy shares in a treasure hunting company,
with the upside, or a boat that works for expenses? 
As noted in the article, the one you have responded to, Meson states they are selling the business off to
Monaco, which means they have no search and recovery capabilities to lure you with.


08 Dec 2015, 12:15 AM


Rory Duncan
Ooops 269, you're wrong once again! They actually retained search and recovery capabilities. Man you are
on a roll.


16 Dec 2015, 07:42 PM


26922203
Does the comment say that I said, or Meson said.


I see that you have spent quite a bit of time today stalking my posts, and repeating the same sentence, that I
was wrong.


IF I use the information that Odyssey provides in a Q or press release, such as the deadlines regarding the
Monaco agreement, and that material is not correct, it is not me that is wrong.


The Monaco deal mentioned was specific, there was Dec 1st deadline, and a Dec 4th deadline, which were
not met, but the deal still went through. I was correct, the deadlines had passed.


Just as with the GALT agreement, the Minosa agreement, and many others, what is written, has little basis for
reality.

Call me wrong, but that is what is written in the public domain.


We shall all see what form the SPA and other options look like in reality. I am certain the purchase shareprice
will be the same?


17 Dec 2015, 03:54 PM

269, he has a very valid point. You read the documents and came to the conclusion that "The Monaco deal is
moot. The deadline has passed."


Quite obviously you were wrong. You tend to misinterpret documents in a consistent fashion in a way that
serves your purpose but that casts OMEX in a negative light. You have predicted imminent bankruptcy for
many years.


17 Dec 2015, 07:40 PM


26922203
Your comments are out of context with the dialog, having nothing to do with the deadline.


Even you have to agree that there is a history of changing and "amending" these types of agreements? Was
the GALT agreement bifurcated, so the people who claimed it was for one shipwreck only were wrong? What
about all of the other contract deadlines such as 5th 3rd and Minosa, they didn't meet those deadlines so the
people who said they missed the deadlines are wrong? 
Interesting that according to the 8K, the def agreement was made on Dec 10, and they waited until the day of
the loans due to announce it? Explain away that.


OMEX is insolvent. That they haven't filed is moot. Little revenue and massive debts, what has changed?
They have given away all of their assets for a day rate.


Transferring all of your assets to pay off some of your debt may not look so good to the BK Court, or the
parties that didn't get paid.


5th 3rd is very, very happy. Aside form the deal Stemm gave himself, it ends there.


Shareholders are left with nothing after all these years of hope, that a $Billion dollar wreck would be a payoff.
Now, any upside goes to Monaco. That's okay, shareholders will still endure years of losses, as the costs of
maintaining the aged equipment far exceeds the day rate.


Bagholders will always have "tomorrow is the day" to look forward to.


Now that the shipwreck business has been sold off, MINOSA can now see that the 30 cent shareprice is
solely based on the potential for them to exercise the call option or the SPA at 75 cents. 30 cents on a 75 cent
buy offer shows what the market thinks OMEX is worth.  
Minosa also let them give away 50% of Neptune, that says they have no interest in undersea mining
short/long term.

32881815
Hi 269, can you point us to the bankruptcy filing? Or is this just one more example of your hyperbole?


"they have given away all their assets for a day rate" LOL. Too funny. You hype the fact that their debts are
going to put them under and when they arrange a deal that takes 20mn in debts off, and that allows them
20%+ back-end economics on the shipwreck business, and that gives them a backlog of work per the CEO,
you try to sell it as "giving their assets away."


The fact that Minosa let them sell 50% of Neptune says nothing of Minosa's interest in undersea mining.


18 Dec 2015, 08:47 AM


26922203
"The fact that Minosa let them sell 50% of Neptune says nothing of Minosa's interest in undersea mining"


Really? IF Minosa WAS planning the SPA, would that not be an asset? 
Minosa is happy to allow someone else own 50% of the Neptune asset? If not for undersea mining nor
shipwreck recovery, what are they buying Odyssey for?


With the $18M+ receivable, it is evident that Odyssey owns 54% of that, given Gordons statement on the
"ability to sell a small portion". This also means that the 46% are basically non-contributing. Minosa will take
the 54%, and have to fund the entire operation?


You are obfuscating the debt issue. There is still plenty of debt left, including the $6.5M acct
payables/accrued.


Revenue. "The Odyssey Explorer has been working on a paid contract in the eastern Mediterranean for the
past two months. We’re being paid for the work being conducted and we retain a significant back-end interest
in this project."  
Back end interest is an asset, no? Another material event with no details?


SEMARNAT holds the key, and so far, it doesn't look too good.


19 Dec 2015, 04:29 PM


32881815
269, my sense is that there are plenty of targets inside and outside of Neptune that omex has available. Just
because they've sold a good portion of Neptune doesn't mean that they can't come back later and do those
projects. My guess is that Monaco and the other equity investors would hope for it.


"You are obfuscating the debt issue" How exactly is anyone obfuscating anything? There are payables
remaining, there are receivables remaining, there is a backend interest that may create more receivables. We
won't get a good view on working cap until they release the K mid-March. Of course they may have already
gotten semarnat approval at that point, in which case we will have better things to discuss than the balance
sheet. For now we know that they got rid of $20mn in debt, the remaining debt is in friendly hands.


You may not think that things look too good at Semarnat. I feel much differently. I'm pleased with what I am
hearing, and I think my sources are very knowledgeable and objective with respect to understanding the MIA

They only have ONE extension and this is it. SEMARNAT cannot keep extending the deadlines. They can
freeze the clock (suspend) if they request more information, and restart it when they receive the
information/answers from the applicant (as they did her a week ago), but they cannot restart a further 60 day
window after this one. They won't have to. They will accept or reject the project BY March.


09 Dec 2015, 06:34 PM


26922203
That is what I stated, they have 50 days to suspend. This would create an extension of the time before a
decision would be provided, correct?


The irony of the situation is that the current date of March 7, 2016, is the same deadline NASDAQ gave
Odyssey for delisting.


I like the SEMARNAT sense of humour.


09 Dec 2015, 08:10 PM


bulldog2014
Not to get too granular on semarnat procedure , but that's not what you said. They cannot add another
extension , as you stated. Suspending, aka freezing the clock, is different from another full sixty business day
suspension. SEMARNAT freezes the clock (suspendido) within their 60 business day window, when they
request further information from the applicant. The clock restarts and picks up where it left off after the
applicant submits the answers, working towards the 60 day deadline. 
SO...they cannot ADD another extension, no matter how you manipulate the sentence. 
Furthermore, regarding the NASDAQ listing: for some reason you think this is some massive cosmic event
that will undue OMEX. Odyssey can reverse split anytime within their stated window, but would rather wait for
a positive material event to make the reverse split more meaningful. 
Look at Lucas Energy (LEI), a dear holding of your friends at Meson Capital. Lucas Energy (LEI) was trading
at a $0.09 and did a reverse 1:25 split to comply with the listing requirements for NASDAQ. What is the
market cap of Lucas Energy, you ask? Market cap of LEI is $2.5 million, so, no- the listing requirement or
deadline is no big thing. The March 7 Nsadq deadline has no meaning with regards to SEMARNAT deadline. I
haven't seen all the public holidays and counted the days, but I don't think March 7 is officially published as
the 60 day deadline for SEMARNAT.


09 Dec 2015, 11:49 PM


26922203
Think about it, what is at the 50 day deadline? The 50 day limit is the point where SEMARNAT can suspend
the process with a request for information. What the the post reference, the 50 day limit. It is you that is
reading into the post, and attempting to obfuscate the real issue at hand.


SEMARNAT does not officially publish the deadlines, Nostadamus, but it appears that everyone has been
able to determine that March 7 is about the deadline. Given that SEMARNAT still had a few days before

process had to be extended, I think SEMARNAT showed a sense of humour in picking the very same date as
delisting.


Speaking of delisting. First off, Gordon stated they would not do that unless it the net was $6 per share.
Second, should the reverse split occur, NASDAQ still requires a minimum of $35M market cap for listing.


Go ahead, split it now at 6:1 and net $1.80 per share, doesn't matter, market cap is still $28M, and does not
qualify to stay listed. Perhaps the shareholders should have voted on a 20:1 split to get it to $6? (the market
cap is still $28M..just so you know)


13.5M shares held short have not covered at 30 cents...


10 Dec 2015, 01:48 AM


bulldog2014
The only person "determining" March 7 is you. Nevertheless, I don't care if it's 3/7 or 3 days earlier or later, as
I've said before. 
"They have 50 days before they can add another extension if they want." 269 
No, they cannot add another "ampliacion de plazo," after this one. Period.


In my example, LEI has a market cap of $2.5 million and is still listed on the NASDAQ market after a reverse
split of 1:25. How does that work with your listing requirement thesis? There are several NASDAQ listing
standards.


10 Dec 2015, 08:05 AM


26922203
Try reading the quarterly statements that Odyssey puts out. Odysseys own statement: 
"NASDAQ also requires that we have a minimum market capitalization of $35 million." page 38


In addition, you should read the posts before answering, again. I did not say they could get another
'ampliacion de plazo' as you keep repeating.


I stated they have 50 days before another possible extension, that extension would be a suspension for
additional information, an extension of time before a decision would be determined.


Better? I am not certain I can make it more clearer for you.


10 Dec 2015, 08:57 PM

Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) that the Company did not satisfy the

However, in accordance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules, the Company has been granted a 180-day period
within which to regain compliance with the market capitalization requirement, through June 27, 2016. In order

It's no secret this company has been a train wreck ( at 30 cents, it's tough to argue otherwise) and is now
merely an option on an environmental approval and subsequent AHMSA (Mexican partner) buy-in with an
expiration date sometime in early March. It's a junior mineral exploration company with a junior biotech
company risk and asymmetric payoff. Not for orphans, widows, or people with serious heart conditions.

Odyssey Marine Exploration Executes $21 Million Deal, Retires all Bank Debt, and Retains a Financial
Interest in Future Shipwreck Projects 
Odyssey to Provide Paid Shipwreck Search and Recovery Services


16 Dec 2015, 09:12 AM


25119743
This is a very good deal for OMEX. However, it still leaves the company in a terrible position, which can be resolved
favorably ONLY through A) Semarnat approval; and B) Minosa choosing to go ahead with the SPA.


First, the deal: On the plus side, Bank debt is decreased from $11.7 million to $0. The interest-bearing debt to Monaco
is decreased from $11.0 million to $2.8 million. Monaco retains an additional non-interest bearing "loan" of $5.0
million, which really sounds like an equity participation into some of OMEX's projects. And OMEX receives an
additional $1.0 million in cash.


This latter point is important, as OMEX really needs the money. OMEX ended Q3 with about $1.6 million of cash, and
subsequently has received $2.0 million of new credits from Monaco ($1.0 million of which was paid down today).


The flip side is that OMEX has given away most of the treasure hunting business. Just a little remains. And this ties
into Minosa, and the question of SPA vs. the Oceanica Call. Back in March, when OMEX had two businesses--deep
sea mining AND shipwrecks, Minosa valued OMEX at $1.00/share. Today, the shipwreck company is largely gone (as
are almost all assets--no more headquarters, no more database, no more artifacts/exhibits/int... property, no more
inventory, only part of the Central America receivables, only a 50% interest in four future shipwreck projects).


And so what is left is deep sea mining. (And for what it's worth, half of Neptune also is gone). So, assuming A)
approval by Semarnat; and B) that the Don Diego is viable economically, then OMEX today basically is the 54% share
of Oceanica (along with the $16 million receivable, should that be bonafide).


So we come full circle, and Minosa again most likely will ask itself, Do they wish to proceed with the SPA and pay
$101 million for a majority share of OMEX, including about 28% of Oceanica? Or do they wish to exercise the Call,
and pay $40 million for no ownership in OMEX, and a 54% ownership of Oceanica.


Remember: OMEX now is largely just 54% of Oceanica.


Remember further: OMEX doesn't have a lot of cash on hand. Their expenses, too, probably will decrease (especially
as their interest payments will fall substantially). But with so little cash, what can they do? (Other than to pay
management their extravagant salaries).

Author’s reply »  Interest payments only decline by about $100k/month, not that significant vs their 1.5-
2mm/month cash burn.


This deal seems to leave them today with only maybe 2mm cash in the bank? so how do they even make it to
March when semarnat is resolved? They tried to have a contract ship salvage business in the past with their
DD ship but couldn't get any projects. It's a competitive market and there's basically no upside on those
projects.

"A trick play, also known as a gadget play or a gimmick play, is a play in American football that uses deception
and unorthodox tactics to fool the opposing team. A trick play is often risky, offering the potential for a large
gain or a touchdown if it is successful, but with the chance of a significant loss of yards or a turnover if not.
Trick plays are rarely used not only because of the riskiness, but to also maintain the element of surprise for
when they are used."

Having the Explorer at work translates into a large swing in cashflow. When it's not working, it burns a few
hundred K per month. When it is working it may generate a few hundred K, not counting any back-end
economics the firm might enjoy from the success of the work and what is found.

They were very careful to keep saying bank debt. What about all of the other debt?


Fraser is owed $1.4M by the end of the year. 
Accounts payable/expenses $6.2M 
Minosa $15M+


In regards to the AHMSA SPA, the current shareprice sits at 30 cents, and assets were reduced significantly. 
Always vague, it is difficult to see at this point, how significant the reduction is.


Asset reduction: 
Acct rec: $6.3M 
Inventory: $4.5M 
Building: $3.6M 
Value of database: unknown 
50% of Victory: unknown (minus $15M to GALT) 
50% of other shipwrecks under contract: unknown 
Value of Tortugas: unknown 
Estimated $20M reduction in assets.

"So we come full circle, and Minosa again most likely will ask itself, Do they wish to proceed with the SPA and
pay $101 million for a majority share of OMEX, "


Minosa's lawyers have already answered this question in a public forum. In case you haven't been paying
attention, this is what Mark Gordon said on the last call:


"In the past few weeks we have received repeated assurances that MINOSA intends to proceed with finalizing
the equity transaction under the agreed terms upon satisfaction of the conditions of the agreement."


And yes, I have confirmed that Minosa's lawyers approve every word of prepared remarks.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3737486-odyssey-marine-exploration-prepares-exit-core-shipwreck-business-cash-burn-continues 26/35


BTW, Mark Gordon said again today that Minosa intends to exercise the SPA.


So it really comes down to whether the MIA is approved or not and whether Pemex and Minosa can get it
done. The market understands this as the stock jumped to 65 cents (up 100%) on rumors that the MIA had
been approved before investors figured out it was not true. If the market really thought that OMEX would only
net $25mn from the approved deal (after paying ahmsa's 15mn and before even considering Monaco which
was at 10mn at the time) then the stock really shouldn't have moved at all.


Sleep well my short friends.

Rory, the last conference call to which you refer was in early August. I'm sure that Mark Gordon spoke
accurately, at the time. What Minosa is thinking now, I don't know. Also, I'm in the unfortunate position,
apparently unlike yourself, that I have not had communications with the in-house counsel of a privately-
owned, Mexican company. Accordingly, again unlike you, I have not been able to confirm what these lawyers
do or do not approve.


16 Dec 2015, 04:22 PM


bulldog2014
251, 
Asking the company (OMEX) through their IR department (as I am assuming Rory did) if Minosa's lawyers
approve very word of the prepared remarks, is not the same as having communications with the in house
counsel of a privately held Mexican company, but I think we all picked up on your sarcasm. You should try
lobbing in a few questions to the company from tim to time. They (IR) are pretty good at responding in a
timely fashion.


16 Dec 2015, 05:25 PM


Rory Duncan
251, if you refer to the transcript of today's call you will find the same messaging. So, Gordon spoke
accurately in August and in December, my good friend.


And as Bulldog has correctly intuited (not sure why you cannot do the same, but we'll tackle that on another
occasion perhaps) I simply spoke with the company IR to confirm this fact. I'm not the only one, I've seen
comments to the same effect from others - clearly we have all had the audacity to pick up the phone and dial
the company's main number. Thanks!

outstanding track record of getting almost everything about OMEX wrong? I'm going to think about this for
awhile.

17 Dec 2015, 08:31 AM


26922203
Did you READ my post? The CEO stated the 'book' value, if you haven't learned to understand how they
wordcraft their statements, here is my original detail:


Asset reduction: 
Acct rec: $6.3M 
Inventory: $4.5M 
Building: $3.6M This is around $13M from the "books", correct?


Does that include any estimate of the value of the shipwreck database and the other assets mentioned in the
deal?


Value of database: unknown 
50% of Victory: unknown (minus $15M to GALT) 
50% of other shipwrecks under contract: unknown 
Value of Tortugas: unknown


Estimated $20M reduction in assets.


What about the undersea holdings from Neptune. Previously, that was touted as one of the reasons MINOSA
had an interest in Odyssey? That is gone as well.


I think history also shows what the value of what is written in the agreements are. On the GALT contract, it
was for one wreck, and one wreck only, until they decided to make it 2 wrecks. The Monaco deal had the
deadlines in the contract, and those had passed, and of course, the 'amendments' to the MINOSA deal which
have changed the terms and conditions of repayment of the loan.


Soon we shall all see what MINOSA's actual deal looks like.

This is a very good deal for OMEX for a number of reasons. They retain much of the upside from the shipwreck
business but have a lot less risk. The only debt they retain is either directly associated with Oceanica (and thus will be
extended as long as the MIA is still progressing) or is now associated with shipwreck projects. Almost all of the
remaining debt carries no interest (ahmsa debt has an 8% liq pref). They save 133k/month in interest costs (not to

mention the principal payments) on the bank debt that was wiped out. The deal also assures them a full backlog of
work with nice upside on the back-end depending on how productive the work is. It sounds like they have plenty of
work with existing clients, but eventually they will begin working with Monaco (and will be paid for that work as well,
rain or shine). The important thing to note is that this work can have a big impact on operating cashflow because the
Explorer goes from a big cash drain to a good-sized cash producer when it is working vs. when it is at port. This won't
make the company cashflow positive on its own, but it could help reduce burn to 5-600k/month depending. That burn
will be lowered more if they collect back-end economics.


The takeaway is that the deal ensures the company will make it through to the Semarnat decision in March on
existing cash as the CEO mentioned in today's call. If they have to sell some of the $18.5mn receivable, they can, but
it doesn't look like that will be necessary (btw, that 18.5mn receivable is around $20mn by March).


Will be interesting to see whether Semarnat takes the full 90 day allotment of extra time, or whether they take care of
it sooner than that.


16 Dec 2015, 08:03 PM


26922203
How does this deal assure them of a backlog of work? IF there was so much work in those files, why havent
they been working these wrecks?


What I find interesting is that the OMEX shareholders, who have endured years of promises of $Billion dollar
recoveries, AND a rapidly declining shareprice...would be happy that the management just let Monaco walk
away with all of the shipwreck recovery assets.


Where is the hope and the gamble that shareholders endured for 15 years?


Should be a very interesting 8K, the massive consulting deal that Stemm got...and yes Rory, the deal did
need an 8K.

The transaction only lowers their interest payment costs. However, the transaction gives them work through
Monaco's sub and that brings in revenue that more than covers the costs of those operations. So costs may
go up, but cash burn goes down.


Meson said that this arrangement doesn't reduce the risk profile. That's a fairly baffling statement.

Monaco didn't take the OE. Odyssey has the right to exclusive recovery operations, but the costs to maintain
the OE are borne by Odyssey, who stated in other conference call that the OE would need to be replaced.


Also interesting is the reference to currently working the Enigma II project, which I believe is a Fraser project?
Stemm now gets 5% of that recovery? What about the OMEX shareholders? Guess Odyssey forgot to
mention that to the shareholders.

It appears that Stemm gets 5% off the top of this project. Correct me if I am wrong (as I know many will
attempt) but wasn't that his job, and given an ongoing project for some time now, a bit retroactive, especially
while the Company is floundering in debt and shareprice plummeting?


Could the 5% been used to pay off some of the debt?


Stemm gets a dividend on projects, what about the shareholders? Seems a bit of a slap in the face to the
longs...

About and Pignatelli, the two AHMSA appointed board members are on the compensation committee.
Steam's compensation -the upside at least- is success based. The bigger the project/contracts he gets, the
more he makes.  
Perhaps the other mineral deposits they are working to secure (and perhaps other shipwreck projects, for
which Stemm must be responsible, are large enough and interesting enough to AHMSA, for them to agree on
Stemm's compensation contract.  
All this just affirms that AHMSA is intent on following through with the SPA post SEMARNAT approval, and
not looking to steal anything for $40 million, or renegotiate the SPA with a 50% haircut as some new posters
have suggested.

"Why not just buy some beaten-down junior energy companies?"


Because many people have lost their shirts ( "hard-earned savings") there too as big energy has turned into junior
energy (ECA for example), and bankruptcy is a very real and imminent possibility there as well, and as stockholders,
we would get a big fat donut as oil breaks $30. 
If you piled into OMEX at $4 for the allure of shipwrecks and never traded it with the wild swings to either monetize it
or get your average cost way down, then you're in trouble. 
If you were just looking at OMEX for the first time today and viewed it as the option that it is, I would rather be there
than some junior shale play. There is a very defined catalyst in the near term. They have a real asset as well.


18 Dec 2015, 08:15 PM


26922203
Didn't many invest $4 in OMEX exactly because of the lure of shipwreck recovery? Wasn't it because of the
lure of the $Billion dollar shipwrecks Odyssey was pumping?

Currently, they are investing 30 cents in the fertilizer company. (still being pumped as a $Billion value!)

Mosaic is a $28 fertilizer company. If Oceanica is a multi-billion dollar concession, as the discounted cash flow
models indicate (once an approval is granted), then $4 is too low.

26922203
Now Oceanica is worth multi-billions?


Why let MINOSA take it away for $40M? (other than they were they only ones interested)


oh thats right, even though the offer price for Oceanica is 75 cents, and they walk away with it, the bottom line
to OMEX is more than $4.

When this 'article' was written, OMEX was at 60 cents. It is currently at 26 cents.


http://bit.ly/1U3OFct


"It doesn't make much sense for AHMSA to buy Oceanica twice, and the alternate way of thinking (buying OMEX ex-
Oceanica) requires some heroic valuations regarding Odyssey's other assets (mainly mining assets because that is
where AHMSA's interests lie) to justify the price tag."


The article touts the undersea assets of Neptune, which are now 50% sold off, as is the shipwreck database, SS
Republic assets, and the returns from the SSCA..


The Victory hasn't been mentioned in months, and the commodity wrecks were never worked....


The author of that article had placed valuations to justify the purchase price, as well as the MIA approval of Don
Diego..all of which, since the 'article' was written, have ceased to exist, albeit the submittal for the MIA has been, well,
reborn as a somewhat different conduit...


"On the face of it, the Call doesn't make much sense. AHMSA is offering $145mn in exchange for 65% of OMEX.
AHMSA's interest lies almost exclusively in OMEX's mining business - which is primarily Oceanica. If we ascribe 75-
100 percent of the transaction price to Oceanica, this would imply an overall valuation of approximately $310 to $410
million for the asset. Why would OMEX write AHMSA a call on Oceanica at a valuation of approximately $74 million,
when AHMSA has made a substantially superior offer for that asset?"


Here is the answer...From The OMEX Q filing with the SEC.

CYPRIOT authorities have confiscated the cargo of a Bahamas-flagged ship suspected of illegal treasure hunting,
and are questioning its crew.


Acting on a tip, police on Wednesday secured a search and seizure warrant for the vessel, which has been moored at
Limassol harbour since December 17.


The ship was active out at sea prior to that date.


Police, assisted by antiquities department and customs officials, boarded the ship and discovered in its hold, which
was locked, 57 crates in which several ancient artefacts were being held.


The artefacts were kept suspended in desalinated water, which according to the antiquities department is standard
procedure for safe storage.


It’s understood the artefacts were recovered from a shipwreck in waters east of the island.


Authorities are questioning the 13 crew members, but no arrests have been made, as it is not yet clear whether the
ship was operating inside the Republic’s area of responsibility. It may have been operating inside Lebanese waters
when it recovered the artefacts.


Police are trying to determine whether the ship had a permit to search for antiquities. If not, the crew could be liable
for illegal treasure hunting and illegal possession of antiquities.


The vessel is the ‘Odyssey Explorer,’ an offshore supply ship.


Alecos Michaelides, the transport ministry’s permanent secretary, told the Cyprus News Agency that the antiquities
found on board the ship date to the 18th century.


He said that the antiquities department had received information on the ship’s activities “some time ago,” and that
more recently the foreign ministry was made aware of the vessel’s operations.
