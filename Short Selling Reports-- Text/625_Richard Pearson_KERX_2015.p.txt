Keryx Biopharmaceuticals: Watch For An FDA Warning Letter
May 11, 2015 9:40 AM ET102 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Keryx has been marketing Auryxia off label conveying a “two for one benefit”.


An “iron benefit” is absolutely critical to the successful marketing of the drug, but
Auryxia has not been approved for this.


Keryx has even marketed the detailed financial savings involved from this
unapproved indication.


Similar illegal marketing practices by Aegerion quickly led to an FDA warning letter
and DOJ investigation and a sharp decline in the stock.


I expect a sharp decline in Keryx.


Authors note: Prior to publication, the author reported Keryx's marketing practices
described below to the United States Food And Drug Administration under their "Bad
Ad" outreach program. As a result of the findings below, the author is short KERX.


Company fundamentals


Name: Keryx Biopharm (NASDAQ:KERX)


Market Cap: $1.1 billion


Share price: $9.31


Cash/share: $1.64 per share


LTM Rev: $2 million


Product Rev: $422,000 (net)


Avg Volume: 2-3 million shares/day


Options: Very liquid calls and puts


Keryx recently announced Q1 earnings following the Q4 2014 launch of its only product,
which controls phosphorous levels in dialysis patients. Disappointing revenues quickly
sent the stock to a new 52-week low as analysts began downgrading the stock.

On Friday, further disappointing weekly prescription data caused the stock to break
another 52-week low, hitting $9.28.


Despite the new lows, former CEO Ron Bentsur just filed to sell over 1.5 million shares
last week.


Section I: Summary


One of the biggest risks with smaller cap pharma companies who are just bringing their
first drug to market is that they are inexperienced and will commit major blunders even
after their first drug gets approved.


Some of these blunders, such as illegal marketing practices, are so blatant and obvious
that it is difficult to imagine how the executives of a major company could commit them.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 3/34


Federal and state laws, including the False Claims Act, state that pharma companies may
only market drugs based on their "label" as specifically determined by the FDA.


According to falseclaimsact.com:


Although physicians may prescribe a drug for an off-label use, pharmaceutical
companies violate federal law, including the False Claims Act, when they market,
promote or encourage physicians to use their drugs in an off-label or non-FDA
approved manner. Pharmaceutical companies that have engaged in illegal off-label
marketing or promotion of their drugs have paid the Government hundreds of
millions of dollars as a result of Federal False Claims Act cases


We have seen this before and we can now see this in looking at the marketing practices
being used by Keryx Biopharm (KERYX). Keryx just released its Q1 earnings and
disappointing revenues sent the stock to a new 52-week low.


Keryx has a single product approved and on the market. The product is Auryxia (prior to
launch it was known as "Zerenex") which is approved for "the control of serum phosphorus
levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis." That is the only indication for
which it is approved.


However, initially Keryx had been hoping to get it approved for a second indication - on
the basis that it can increase iron stores.


In 2014, Management had described the iron benefit as being "critical" to the drug's sales
because it differentiates the drug from its competitors and would allow for considerable
cost savings by dialysis centers.


So again, marketing Auryxia on the basis of an iron benefit is crucial for actually achieving
sales of the drug.


Not only did Keryx not get that approval, but the elevated iron levels were cited as a safety
issue.


Despite the lack of approval for this indication, we can now see that Keryx is marketing the
drug as having an iron benefit anyway. In fact, Keryx has continued to state that the iron
benefit is what differentiates Auryxia from competitors and that the drug will allow dialysis
centers to save $2,000-$4,000 per patient by cutting out the extra injectable iron that is
required by IV during dialysis.

This is nothing less than illegal off label marketing. I believe that the FDA and
potentially the DOJ will be obligated to act on these findings.


Section II: An important example - what happened to Aegerion?


A similar instance of illegal off label marketing gives us a good idea of what to expect from
the current practices at Keryx. Last year Aegerion (AEGR) received a DOJ subpoena for
similar practices shortly after receiving an FDA warning letter. The company was not only
forced to discontinue the illegal marketing, but was also forced to "remediate" - actively
communicating to the public what had happened and why it was wrong.


Additional problems sent Aegerion even lower following the DOJ investigation.


Aegerion's CEO had appeared on Jim Cramer's Fast Money TV show in June of 2013 and
made certain claims about their drug Juxtapid which went well above and beyond its FDA
approval.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/11/4238561-14313326514774141-Richard-Pearson_origin.png
5/22/2018 Keryx Biopharmaceuticals: Watch For An FDA Warning Letter - Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KERX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 5/34


(Juxtapid is approved only for use as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid lowering
treatments, to reduce specific lipids in patients with HoFH. People with this disease have a
decreased ability to remove excess LDL cholesterol (so-called "bad" cholesterol) from the
bloodstream.)


KEY POINT: What is most interesting here is that even though these highly visible
comments were vastly out of line with Juxtapid's FDA approval, no one (not the
brightest analysts or investors) saw any problem with the comments. In fact,
investors simply bid up the stock at the time!


Aegerion's CEO made a second appearance on CNBC in October 2013, making similar
comments. But this time someone reported the segment to the FDA and the FDA quickly
reacted with a very serious warning letter. The FDA even went so far as to demand
remediation, stating:


Because the violations described above are serious, we request, further, that your
submission include a comprehensive plan of action to disseminate truthful, non-
misleading, and complete corrective messages about the issues discussed in this
letter to correct any misimpressions about the approved use of Juxtapid.


The DOJ quickly followed suit with a full investigation and subpoenas.


At the time, Aegerion was still trading near $60. The stock has since plunged to $20 on
these and a variety of other concerns.


Aegerion did cease its illegal marketing practices and did ultimately make public
communications to correct the misinformation. Over a year after the initial appearance on
Cramer, Aegerion disclosed that it had resolved the FDA issues. But by this time, the
damage to the stock was already done.


Question: What should we learn from Aegerion?


Lesson #1: Even though the Aegerion violations occurred blatantly in the public
eye, no investors or analysts managed to spot them until an FDA warning letter and
DOJ subpoena were issued. Everyone missed what was sitting in plain sight.


This is identical to what we see with Keryx.


Lesson #2: Like Keryx, Aegerion was marketing its first ever drug which helps to explain
how management could be guilty of such an amateurish blunder.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 6/34


Lesson #3: The FDA is equally concerned about illegal promotion regardless of where it
happens, in the clinic or in the mainstream media.


The FDA subsequently provided a statement to CNBC noting that:


Regardless of the media or venue used to disseminate promotional messages
about prescription drugs, pharmaceutical companies undermine the drug approval
process and may put the public at risk when they promote drugs for uses that have
not been proven safe and effective.


As shown below, we can already see Keryx using multiple different venues to conduct the
off label promotion for the unapproved indication.


Lesson #4: Being forced to discontinue the off label promotion can have a disastrous
impact on sales all by itself. This is simply because without the promotion the drug's sales
will fall sharply.


In addition, this heavy impact is further magnified by the impact of the "remediation,"
where the company must go out and actively communicate the facts about the
inaccuracies to the public.


Without the ability to convey a quantifiable iron benefit, Keryx will not be able to
achieve meaningful sales of Auryxia. The financial impact will be very significant.
Keryx itself has made it clear in the past that the "iron benefit" was critical to selling
the drug.


Section III: Looking at Keryx and off label marketing


Overvaluation alone is never a sufficient reason to short a stock. Overvalued stocks have
a way of becoming increasingly overvalued before they finally break.


It is oddly the case that when a company has zero revenues, it is in fact often the worst
time to short the stock because its true prospects cannot be quantified. In the meantime,
boundless hope prevails.


Instead, the right time to get short a stock is once it starts to deliver results and those
results can then be verified as a great disappointment. The right time to short these stocks
is therefore typically on the way down.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 7/34


Even after a 50% drop from its highs of last year, shares of Keryx Biopharm are
undeniably grossly overvalued. The company trades with a market cap of over $1 billion,
despite generating its first quarterly net sales of just $422,000 from its only product
Auryxia. Auryxia launched in December and has had a full quarter to ramp up sales.


The lackluster launch and disappointing sales are the first catalyst for a further decline in
Keryx. The second catalyst will likely be the FDA (and potentially DOJ) fallout from their
marketing practices.


Note that Keryx also received royalties of $753,000 in Q1 from Japan Tobacco for JT's
sales of Riona in Japan. These royalties have been running at less than $1 million over
the past year and are not expected to make up a substantial part of revenues.


Expectations had been running high for Auryxia last year, with the stock hitting as high as
$18, valuing the company at nearly $2 billion. But in Q1, the stock has shown a steady
decline of around 30%, coinciding with the launch of Auryxia. Again, Auryxia is Keryx's
only product. The stock now trades for around $9.


What is Keryx doing wrong?


Given the incredibly low level of sales, it is not surprising that Keryx is putting on the full
court press to boost sales in any way that it can. On its Q1 conference call, management
noted that it was pursuing "geographic and label expansion."


We can now see that Keryx has been going too far on the sales effort and has been
already engaging in blatant off label marketing of Auryxia.


KEY POINT: Not only is Keryx making these statements in public venues (such as
earnings calls and to trade journals) but we can see from the comments below that
they are also making these statements to doctors.


Keryx has been conveying that Auryxia has a "two for one benefit" in that it not only has
an ability to control phosphate, but that it also has the benefit of increasing iron stores.
The unapproved "iron benefit" is being marketed as a distinct competitive advantage vs.
alternatives and as a way for dialysis centers to save thousands of dollars per patient.


Yet Auryxia is only approved for a single indication, as follows:


AURYXIA is a phosphate binder indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels
in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 8/34


CEO Greg Madison has already been telling publications such as Fierce Pharma
Marketing the following:


As Auryxia works, patients absorb iron, something many dialysis patients need
anyway. By using Auryxia over a competing product, dialysis centers can cut out
52% of the extra injectable iron they provide to deficient patients, Madison says--and
simultaneously cut down on costs.


The reason that this matters is that Medicare pays a flat rate to the dialysis centers. Any
cost savings that they can enjoy from not using IV iron stay with the dialysis center.


In terms of communications with doctors and dialysis centers, Madison also noted
that:


Reps will be pushing iron absorption as a selling point with that audience, too,
focusing on the fact that reducing the need for IV iron can reduce the risk of
overall side effects like anaphylaxis.


Madison even went so far as to quantify the benefit to dialysis centers, saying:


All told, according to Madison, the savings per patient per year from using Auryxia
over a competitor range on average between $2,000 and $4,000. He's confident
those figures will boost his company's new med at a time when patients, providers
and payers are taking a closer look at pharmacoeconomics.


References to the use of off label marketing can also be found within comments on
Keryx's recent Q1 conference call.


On the call, management noted that:


We have been able to recognize the differentiation and impact of the Auryxia
message through recent market research with target prescribers that have
interacted with our sales representatives. The data on this slide gives us
confidence that the Auryxia message is being delivered and extremely well
received…. On the top of this slide, you'll see that the majority of nephrologists
unaided recall that Auryxia is a unique phosphate binders because of its ability to
control phosphate AND increase iron stores. Almost verbatim we have been
hearing from physicians the two for one benefit with Auryxia.

Here is the slide to which they are referring. The entire presentation can be found here
(although I am expecting that it may be changed following publication of this article). I
have saved a copy of it for future reference.


Note that this slide states how the "sales message is resonating with physicians." It
is clear that Keryx is marketing Auryxia as having a benefit for which it is not
approved.


Fully 64% of the respondents "recall" that Auryxia impacts Serum Iron. In other words,
they are being pitched this benefit in the sales calls.


From page 11 in the presentation, we can also see the following slide which explicitly
states this benefit.

Item #3 above states that Auryxia "increases serum iron parameters through systemic
absorption." Again, this is how the "iron benefit" of Auryxia is being marketed, but this is
not something for which it is approved.


How does Keryx expect to benefit from this off label marketing?


In the initial launch press release, Keryx had noted that:


End-stage renal disease (ESRD) represents the most severe stage of CKD, as many
metabolic factors, such as iron and phosphorus, are out of balance. The majority of
ESRD patients require chronic treatment with phosphate-binding agents to lower
and maintain serum phosphorus at acceptable levels. In addition, iron can be
severely depleted in dialysis patients and they therefore are often treated with
intravenous iron and other medications. Approximately 450,000 ESRD patients
require dialysis in the U.S., with the number projected to rise in the future.


Note that in its official press release, Keryx stopped short of conveying any iron benefit.
But from the subsequent notes seen above, we can see that the "benefit" is that Auryxia
can be seen as a substitute for intravenous iron. Again, this indication has not been

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 11/34


approved by the FDA.


In the past, Keryx tried but failed to gain approval for iron indications. Instead, the iron
"benefit" was included as a safety warning.


Last year on the Q2 conference call, Keryx stated that


So as we await potential label there, I think iron parameters that we have talked
about there are obviously a critical component of that and a potential big
differentiator for us in the market place.


Shortly after approval (when the drug was still known as Zerenex), Adam Feuerstein of
TheStreet.com had noted that:


As an iron-based phosphate binder, "Zerenex's" most important advantage --
differentiating it from the competition -- was supposed to be its ability to reduce the
use of anemia drugs like Amgen's (AMGN) Epogen in kidney dialysis patients.
Keryx has long promoted the idea that kidney disease specialists and dialysis
providers would flock to "Zerenex" because of the cost savings resulting from
fewer injections of Epogen.


But the "Zerenex" label approved by the FDA makes no mention of the drug's
beneficial effect on anemia, nor does the label say anything about reductions in the
use of anemia drugs. Sometimes, when FDA doesn't agree with a company about
the desire to highlight a potential drug benefit, regulators will still allow the company
to include relevant clinical data in the label. Not this time.


FDA barred Keryx from including any anemia-related "Zerenex" data in the
clinical studies section of the label.


KEY POINT: So the key point is that having an iron benefit was critical for the
marketing of Auryxia/Zerenex to dialysis centers. Use of it would supposedly result
in large cost savings by not needing to use injections of drugs such as Epogen.
Keryx did not win approval for an iron benefit, but Keryx is marketing that benefit
anyways - claiming cost savings of $2,000-$4,000 per patient.

Keryx is clearly marketing Auryxia as having a benefit for which it was not approved. More
importantly, this "benefit" is the key differentiation point for the product. Without being able
to make these marketing claims, Keryx will see its already flagging sales crippled.


The FDA has made it clear that illegal off label marketing of drugs will be acted upon,
regardless of the venue in which it is done. In the past, the FDA has not only forced
offenders to discontinue the practices, but they have also demanded public remediation to
clarify the issues to the public.


Keryx has already made clear that its sales reps are sending out the "iron benefit"
message to their intended target audience, the dialysis centers and physicians.


Even WITH the off label marketing, sales of Auryxia have been a steep disappointment,
pulling in net sales of just $422,000 in its first full quarter following its December 2014
launch.


The former CEO just filed to sell over 1.5 million shares despite the fact that the stock is
hitting new 52-week lows.


In the meantime, Keryx is still valued at over $1 billion. But probably not for very long.


Key catalysts for further decline in Keryx:


regulatory intervention due to off label marketing practices
continued revenue disappointment
further analyst downgrades

In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, Ferric Citrate has been shown to increase serum iron parameters,
including ferritin, iron and TSAT. In dialysis patients treated with Ferric Citrate in a 52-week study in which IV iron
could also be administered, mean (SD) ferritin levels rose from 593 (293) ng/mL to 895 (482) ng/mL, mean (SD)
TSAT levels rose from 31% (11) to 39% (17) and mean (SD) iron levels rose from 73 (29) mcg/dL to 88 (42) mcg/dL.
In contrast, in patients treated with active control, these parameters remained relatively constant [see
Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].


12.3 Pharmacokinetics


Absorption and Distribution  
Formal pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with Ferric Citrate. Examination of serum iron parameters
has shown that there is systemic absorption of iron from Ferric Citrate....."


I agree initial sales have been extremely disappointing, but the label does mention iron absorption so the FDA did
allow this benefit to be mentioned in marketing even though it is not listed as an indication. It is listed in the sections
noted above in the label.

pennywatchdog
It would be important from the side-effects point of view, since dialysis patients usually need iron supplementation, but
if they are on Auryxia caregivers would need to be watchful of too much iron, so its inclusion in the literature and in
info given to doctors is important. That could be why the FDA allowed it to be mentioned in the literature, but, this
author is clearly trying to set-up his short, so who do you believe? Until the letter shows up in the mailbox, it doesn't
exist.

The whole article is disingenuous. Nothing wrong with shorting a stock if it is based on fundamentals. Cherry picking
comments from conference calls and investment-related articles and then (in a public forum) inferring that these
comments are in violation of FDA rules is either very ignorant or nefarious. The FDA rules you keep mentioning refer
to marketing to the general public, patients, and doctors, not investors. Not to mention MarkAlpha33's reference to
what is on the label. How this made a "Must Read" is beyond me.

Here is the #1 rule for SeekingAlpha:


If you poke it and it squeals like a pig, it's a pig.


Notice all the retail investors squealing about a truthful article that doesn't agree with their incorrect views of the stock.
SOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEEEE!!!

that actually sounds like the squeal of a short being squeezed 
today.........up $1.38(over 10%). 
seems like the stock took off just after Richard's "view" was written.

Interesting article from this author, as usual. People always seem to get upset about authors that are short a stock
writing up why it's overvalued, but IMO this is healthy for the market (and of course, it makes sense that the author is
putting his money where his mouth is by being short).


Based on the whole label (http://bit.ly/1GYUXSF), I think the author makes a reasonable point that management is
being aggressive by describing the increased iron as a benefit. IMO the label conveys the increased iron instead as
much more of a negative/risk factor.

Abstract


Ferric citrate (FC) is a phosphate binder with shown efficacy and additional effects on iron stores and use of
intravenous (iv) iron and erythropoiesis-stimula... agents (ESAs). We provide detailed analyses of changes in
iron/hematologic parameters and iv iron/ESA use at time points throughout the active control period of a phase 3
international randomized clinical trial. In all, 441 subjects were randomized (292 to FC and 149 to sevelamer
carbonate and/or calcium acetate [active control (AC)]) and followed for 52 weeks. Subjects on FC had increased
ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels compared with subjects on AC by week 12 (change in ferritin,
114.1±29.35 ng/ml; P<0.001; change in TSAT, 8.62%±1.57%; P<0.001). Change in TSAT plateaued at this point,
whereas change in ferritin increased through week 24, remaining relatively stable thereafter. Subjects on FC needed
less iv iron compared with subjects on AC over 52 weeks (median [interquartile range] dose=12.9 [1.0–28.9] versus
26.8 [13.4–47.6] mg/wk; P<0.001), and the percentage of subjects not requiring iv iron was higher with FC (P<0.001).
Cumulative ESA over 52 weeks was lower with FC than AC (median [interquartile range] dose=5303 [2023–9695]
versus 6954 [2664–12,375] units/wk; P=0.04). Overall, 90.3% of subjects on FC and 89.3% of subjects on AC

experienced adverse events. In conclusion, treatment with FC as a phosphate binder results in increased iron
parameters apparent after 12 weeks and reduces iv iron and ESA use while maintaining hemoglobin over 52 weeks,
with a safety profile similar to that of available binders.


A JP Morgan 4Mar2015 research note described this JASN article and an editorial in the following excerpt:


“Ferric Citrate Reduces Intravenous Iron and Erythropoiesis-Stimula... Agent Use in ESRD” – JASN


- This publication contains data from the long-term Phase 3 trial of ferric citrate (previously presented), with a detailed
analysis on the iron effects of ferric citrate. The study finds that patients in the FC arm had statistically significant
increases in TSAT and ferritin relative to active control patients by week 12 (p<0.001 for both), with changes in both
ultimately plateauing over time. The study concludes that treatment with FC results in increased iron parameters after
12 weeks and reduces IV iron and ESA requirements while maintaining Hb over 52 weeks with a safety profile similar
to that of other binders.


- More interesting, in our view, is the accompanying editorial, which highlights the history/challenges in treating
anemia over the years as well as the drawbacks associated with approved phosphate binders. The author is
enthusiastic about the potential of FC to treat both hyperphosphatemia and anemia, though understandably notes that
additional studies will be needed to fully assess the longer-term safety.

Background: Ferric citrate (FC) is a new phosphorus binder shown to increase serum iron stores while reducing
intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimula... agent usage. Such reductions could lower hospitalization rates and
associated costs. Methods: Hospitalizations during a Phase III trial were compared between FC and active control
(AC). Hospitalization costs were estimated using the 2013 US Renal Data System Annual Data Report. Results:
34.6% of FC patients were hospitalized at least once versus 45.6% of the AC group (risk reduction 24.2%; p = 0.02).
There were 181 unique hospitalizations in the FC group versus 239 in the AC group, for a difference of 58
hospitalizations. Total potential savings was US$ 867,622 in hospitalization costs in the FC group. If the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 18/34


hospitalization reduction in our study was applied to the general end-stage renal disease population, this could
translate into a savings of US$ 3002/patient/year. Conclusions: Patients receiving FC experienced fewer
hospitalizations with the potential for significant savings.


Peer-reviewed publications matter to prescribing physicians. Celgene's blockbuster Revlimid was approved for
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) in June 2006, only received FDA approval in newly diagnosed MM
patients in February 2015, yet 55% of patients received Revlimid front line without the marketing label based on peer-
reviewed publications and presentations at major medical meetings.


Launching a new therapeutic that is not targeted to life-threatening indications like cancer require methodical efforts to
educate physicians, caretakers, providers, patients and gain reimbursement and formulary access, which takes time.
Keryx started with the nephrologists, then gained access in February 2015 to the two dominant dialysis players,
DaVita and Fresenius, where the hands-on nurses and dieticians could learns about Auryxia and identify prospective
patients. Reimbursement is critical and payers have their own schedules for meetings to decided on new therapeutics
and positioning in the formularies. On the 1Q2015 conference call, CEO Greg Madison indicated with two recent wins,
another pending in a few weeks, Keryx will have 9 of 15 Medicare Part D on board with about 50% of lives covered by
June versus current 25%, which should be helpful for physicians, who do not want to take up staff time fighting for
insurance coverage until broader reimbursement is in place. This is not unique to nephrology, as the squeeze on
payments to doctors has necessitated higher throughput.


It is not surprising that nephrologists are attracted to a message that Aurxyia performs well as a PB, while reduces the
need for IV iron, ESAs and reduces hospitalizations and hospitalization costs in this end stage renal disease (ESRD)
population. It should also resonate well with patients and providers, who get paid in the bundle that excludes oral PBs
like Auryxia until 2024, as they receive fixed price reimbursement with the potential to reduce multiple costs identified
above, which should lead to improved margins.


Auryxia is clearly a highly differentiated PB, which will play a significant role in the treatment paradigm over time and
provide benefits to patients, physicians, caregivers, dialysis providers, payers and the overall healthcare system. Greg
Madison ran the renal franchise for Sanofi, which included the market leader, Renvela, Renagel.

From the label referenced above by 8173451.... thanks for posting that link.


"---------------------... 
•Iron overload syndromes (e.g., hemochromatosis) (4) 
-----------------WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS-----------... 
•Iron overload: Monitor ferritin and TSAT. Patients may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of IV iron. (5.1) 
•Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of

immediately"


It is a side-effect that causes increased iron absorption, it requires that additional iron supplements be discontinued.
This side-effect is also a benefit to the patient, and a detriment to iron supplement makers. Last I checked, generic

iron tablets are pretty cheap, can't imagine they would lose that much from this class of patients (chronic kidney
disease requiring dialysis).


IMHO as a RN, having read the literature, it is vitally important to tell potential doctors and patients about this
potentially deadly overdose possibility that is rectified by eliminating iron supplementation. It is both a contraindication
that requires warning, and a benefit that requires active management and ongoing testing for iron overdose.


IMHO, this is no reason to short the stock.

There is no moat. It's an inferior drug. Go ahead and shovel your money into the fire if you want to.


12 May 2015, 05:24 PM


pennywatchdog
ikarus, to say the drug is inferior shows the depths of your own ignorance. This drug is used during dialysis
and is not prescribed to the patient for the purposes of iron supplementation. The process of dialysis creates
an excess of phosphates which this drug treats, the process of dialysis also breaks some red blood cells, they
carry iron and so the result is the patient also suffers from iron deficiency. It just happens that a side-effect of
the drug is that it preserves iron.


People, especially newbies, always read a contributor's bio before deciding whether to believe someone. And
always lean to the person who has the most education or work experience in the field in question, and always
stop to consider what their motivation really is. Any person who brags about their ability to manipulate prices
for a short is someone to stay away from.

KERYX have already received a warning letter from FDA in 2011:  
http://1.usa.gov/1GZ0Vmz and did not really change much.


Furthermore there have been numerous articles published proving drugs efficiency as an Iron supplement. Like the
one at NFK Spring Clinical Meeting in 2014.


The company is planning to submit an FDA approval application for use of Auryxia in on non dialysis dependant stage
3-5 CKD patients. From Q1 conf call: "we plan to file a supplemental new drug application with the FDA in the first half
of 2016"


Unlike many other superficial biotech companies their drug actually works. It is simple chemistry.


Finally if you were suffering from CKD what would you prefer, take some pills at home/work or go to the hospital for a
1 hour session of IV iron? 1 course of of IV iron is c$30k depending on location etc. similar treatment with Auryxia
cost about $2500.


I think the main flaw in your analysis is that you are confusing a drug that does not work with a drug that does not yet
have an FDA approval for something it can actually treat.

Regardless of what KERX does or does not say when it markets Auryxia, the dialysis centers will soon be able to
figure out that Auryxia saves megabucks on reduced IV-Iron & ESA costs, and on reduced hospitalizations. So why
would they take any chances?


Here's a link to the 4/23/14 8-K: http://bit.ly/1FfRZP0


It has 4 posters attached. All 4 posters show that KERX saves many THOUSANDS of dollars per patient per year for
the reasons mentioned above. And if you look at the second poster, you'll see "DaVita Clinical Research" in the upper
left hand corner. I find that very reassuring.

I have no problem if someone has a legitimate short thesis for a stock - it is those shorts who provide a needed
service/counterbalance to a long view. However, this author is not one of those shorts. He has a known track record
on SA for stringing together a combination of cherry picked and/or out of context information and/or outdated
information, etc. to posit a short case, sometimes using the 'altruistic' guise of trying to protect investors, to
manipulate the stock price. It seems to me that there is a very thin line between his articles and outright lies.


BTW, I do not have a position in KERX nor intend to establish one.

NOW you can short this $1.38 higher than when you wrote this.

Hope the FDA is prudent enough to tell the difference between public concern and financial interest when they
evaluate which "bad ad" reports have priority...

Only time will tell how this plays out. Other than what was posted above, does anybody have a good explanation for
the triple volume double digit upswing yesterday? I couldn't find any news or rumor to explain the move or the volume.

It seems as though a lot of novice investors got suckered into this one by tailing Klarman trying to chase the next IDIX
without doing any research. It's becoming increasingly clear that the product has little to no competitive advantage
over generics. No dog here (yet), but thanks for the write up.


12 May 2015, 10:35 AM


ikarus
Indeed, sir. Made only worse by the fact that it's easy to track weekly scripts for KERX and competitors and
see just how big a failure it is. I don't think it's worthless, but it's worth far, far less than $10 and change.

Sir Falstaff, is there a generic drug which has iron that can be absorbed by the body?


13 May 2015, 07:55 AM


Sir Falstaff
Iron is inexpensive and generic. Sorry, this is still a niche drug that isn't selling well.


13 May 2015, 09:05 AM


Siarud
Iron may not be expensive. But the method to inject iron is expensive, i.e. IV iron is expensive.


13 May 2015, 12:26 PM


Pavel Goltsblat, Contributor
So there is no generic drug that can substitute iron for anemic stage 3-5 CKD patients, correct?


13 May 2015, 12:46 PM


Sir Falstaff
Correct. But remember, drugs already exist to treat iron deficiency. If this drug was a "game-changer" then
why was the company unable to secure a commercial launch partner? Given the odds, why introduce the
execution risk?


14 May 2015, 12:31 AM


Pavel Goltsblat, Contributor
SF, here is what a lot of people do not understand: 
*There are 26m CKD patients in the US, 12% develop anemia.  
*IV iron course costs $30K to Dialysis centers and they get reimbursed by insurance companies.  
*Auryxia can potentially half the number of visits for IV iron procedure. *Auryxia treatment course is c$2500.
Potential market size is $7.8bn and savings of $39bn in the US alone. 
*It is also estimated that there are 29m CKD patients in Japan, and do not forget about emerging and
European markets


Auryxia is the only drug close to FDA approval for both iron replacement and phosphorus removal.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3168126-keryx-biopharmaceuticals-watch-for-an-fda-warning-letter 27/34


Sir Falstaff
Again, the company struggled for a long time trying to find a commercial launch partner only to give up and
go-it-alone, introducing huge execution risks (and regulatory risks, as outlined in the article). If history is any
guide, the odds of success are unfavorable. Which brings me back to my question: why was not a single
pharmaceutical company (or dialysis provider) all over this given the market opportunities in front of them?


My best guess is that we'll have the answer to that question in 2016-17, when oral iron is added to the dialysis
reimbursement bundle and there is an even bigger flood of competition that drowns this company. I suspect a
lack of truly defensible IP may also be at play, but we'll have to wait for that to play out. At any rate, best of
luck.

bradlewski, perhaps you can address my questions above and explain why Keryx was unable to find a
commercial partner since they had a game-changing, block-busting drug with nothing but greenfield in front of

And remember, you said you would donate 10% of your holdings if the stock hit $10.

Sir flagstaff. 
"why Keryx was unable to find a commercial partner since they had a game-changing, block-busting drug with

I have not ignored your question. 
ERI (Emotional Rules of investing) aside.


Investors (not just big pharma) use DD. The value of that DD explores the decision to invest or not invest.


The not invest thesis could be the reasons you sated 
The invest thesis could be the ones I, Keryx and various other investors have stated


The conundrum or misplaced bet is the intrinsic value of one's DD and the risk management.

Pavel Goltsblat, Contributor
SF, I never said there is a 100% chance of success, if there was the stock would be trading at $80 by now at
least. Hence the answer to your question re no launch partners.


But how would you answer your own question? Why did they turn it down exactly? Have they actually ever
said your drug does not work? Or is not economically viable? Answer those questions and you will get what I
mean.


Keryx is more of a long dated option. I think once the revenue starts rolling in and they will have a track
record there is a very high chance they will get taken over by the likes of Veleant or Endo at very attractive
multiples.


There is also no doubt a probability that KERX will go bust, but risk and return are definitely skewed favorably
to the upside.


15 May 2015, 04:34 AM


ikarus
It's really not though. This is a long dated put option. You can't burn massive amounts of cash and have a
drug that doesn't work and have "definitely skewed favorably" upside. That's backwards.


15 May 2015, 10:10 AM


Pavel Goltsblat, Contributor
Ikarus, do you have an outstanding public track record of your investment performance so that we can take
your word at face value? It is really hard to take you seriously when you have not put any numbers or factual

15 May 2015, 11:31 AM


pennywatchdog
Sir, you and ikarus have based this whole thesis on iron supplementation, a side-effect of the drug whose
primary purpose is to bind excess phosphorus in dialysis patients. You both are going on and on about iron
supplementation, with no discussion about the phosphate binding ability of the drug. You are completely
missing the whole purpose of the drug in question. People with CKD are on dialysis. People on dialysis have
a metabolic problem with excessive phosphorus, Auryxia is the only drug on the market to fix that problem.
The side-effect of iron preservation needed to be addressed for the medical community administering this
drug and for the patients who receive it.


You guys are nothing more than shysters, you use rx stats to claim the drug is worthless, and try to make
some point about no commercial partner, but none of those reasons provides any proof that the drug is
worthless. Scripts may have been slow to start, possibly due to the confusion surrounding the iron situation,
but that alone is not going to stop doctors from prescribing the only phosphate binder on the market for CKD
patients. Just the opposite, I believe and predict that every CKD patient on dialysis will eventually be
transitioned to this drug, and iron supplementation in all forms will fall to the wayside for CKD patients.


Oh, and your short will fail. You have actually done a public service for KERX holders, this article has aired
the issue regarding the iron supplementation issue, and smart investors will come to realize that it is a
complete non-issue.

very good points always good to read what you write.


The problem with gov't intervention as you lay it out is that you are essentially assuming that it happens. Rightly or
wrongly how, when, why and in what manner if at all is a very big and important aspect as well. Granted your case
seems valid, provided they act in the way you ascribe.


Theoretically they could write a negative affirmative message which would say it doesn't not ascribe to improve
absorption even though it was proved to do so in clinical testing. Which may make the whole point moot and be
enough for the actors in question.

Rustbelt Bill
Big companies don't buy on the come, they buy established revenue streams, -which ain't much here, yet. Also, they
are very wary of potential liabilities. Case in point: 
CCK bought a small company that earlier had used asbestos, and sold it six months later. Several years later
mesothelioma burst on the scene. In 2001, even though CCK, the biggest container/closure company in the world,
had set aside $400,000,000 and had a revenue stream to cover all the possible contingencies, they went from $60+
down to $0.83 in under a year. Recovery time? 15 years. Big companies don't buy brownfield real estate for the same
reason, which is why old big city industrial property is worth almost nothing.


15 May 2015, 10:08 AM


bradlewski
Rustbelt Bill 
"Big companies don't buy on the come, they buy established revenue streams'


That's part of it, perhaps even a large part. We need to dive deeper into some other factors like how would the terms
affect all the principals and agents of all the parties involved. Also, in the case of Keryx, these are future revenue
streams. Obviously, Any specific details of why any terms were unacceptable would need to be public before we can
discuss them.


I can give you our thoughts on two examples of public deals.


We decided not to invest in MNKD in part because of their arrangements with SNY.

We decided to invest in IDIX in part because of their rejection of arrangements with GILD. Later, MRK offered better
terms which forced us out with a huge profit.


Hope this helps.


15 May 2015, 03:44 PM


Sir Falstaff
Homeslice, if they couldn't lock down a commercial partner, there is no acquisition here. There is no reason not to
partner with a big pharma player who has the resources and capacity to successfully undertake a commercial launch.
Instead, the company now has five dozen salespeople going door-to-door trying to educate an entire market on their
product. The big boys likely knew this product would get crushed by an onslaught of competition and serves a very
narrow niche (1.5mm patients, not 26mm). Best of luck.


15 May 2015, 05:14 PM


MarkAlpha33
Here is what the Bears like to forget about Keryx:


1. They have almost $2.00 per share in NOL carry forwards that have monetary value to an acquirer as it would allow
them to avoid taxes. 
2. Japan PV of royalty streams is likely worth $0.50 per share 
3. This leaves only $7.50 (750m) value to the drug potential in EU and the U.S. If we just focus on US market
considering the price of the drug is around $11,000 annually to reach $100 million in annual sales you would only
need 2.2% of the US market (9,090 patients out of 400,000 market size) to justify this valuation (5-7x sales)


When I put that together I see the market currently has extremely low expectations , especially considering the likely
label expansion for anemia in CKD pre-dialysis patients


16 May 2015, 09:01 AM


crimsonbey
1)NOL isn't carried over to an acquirer fully there are limitations... it plays almost no role for the buying
company.


2)possible but you have to have it be adopted by the market there first 
3)maybe


your also ignoring the costs they are incurring in rolling out the product and the r&d in relation to the phase
3/4 they have ongoing to prove iron absorption.


they have one product the volatility based on its' successes and failures are magnified upon the company

The letter you spoke of is nothing more than a figment of your imagination, and nothing else. I am also curious to
know why you have not responded to any of the commentators?


Good job longs, facts will always trump fictions in this short and distort business. 
FYI: I don't hold any KERX, and have no intention of doing so, I short term traded this company (successfully) last
year, and moved on, but since I follow biotechs, and hate shorts, I ended up here to defend what I perceive as a
successful company with a much needed drug. Good luck to longs.

Still short and completely unimpressed with KERX. Auryxia is not selling well according to IMS script data. Just
another biotech that mediocre retail investors got bagged on and will play out the same as ARNA, another retail
wealth transfer. Yawn.

ARNA has a drug that is completely optional for overweight people, completely optional, with many other
options out there to choose from to help one lose weight.


KERX has a drug that is absolutely necessary for all CKD patients on dialysis, with no other options, period.


We have heard so much from you ikarus, and nothing from the supposed author of this imaginary problem,

Interesting - but before you smear Madison and Keryx you should review the warning a bit closer - Keryx must
disclose impact on iron levels:


AURYXIA PI Iron Overload: Iron absorption from AURYXIA may lead to excessive elevations in iron stores. Increases
in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT levels) were observed in clinical trials. Assess iron parameters, eg
serum ferritin and TSAT, prior to initiating AURYXIA and while on therapy. Patients receiving IV iron may require a
reduction in dose or discontinuation of IV iron therapy.


While it's a thin line between telling physicians to monitor iron levels vs impact on anemia , it does make perfect
sense to talk about the dual impact.
