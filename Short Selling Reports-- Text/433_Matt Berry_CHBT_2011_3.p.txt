China-Biotics' 2009 Revenue Is $70M Off
May 15, 2011 2:51 AM ET39 comments
by: Matt Berry


When comparing US and Chinese filings, China-Biotics' (OTC:CHBT) 2009 revenue
appears to be 70 million dollars off.


China-Biotics' subsidiary filed its audited numbers with Chinese government agencies last
year, including the Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce (SHAIC, 上海市工
商行政管理局制). The 2009 official documents are now available.


In brief, total revenue for 2009 as claimed in China was 3,440,950 RMB … which is
approximately $530,000 USD. For the same time period, China-Biotics claimed revenue of
$71,376,507 USD in its SEC filings (March 31, 2010 10k).  This is a difference of more
than $70,000,000 dollars.


China-Biotics' revenue generating subsidiary in China during that time was 上海双金生物
科技有限公司, filed in SEC documents as "Shanghai Shining Biotechnology Co.，Ltd."
("Shanghai Shining"). The other relevant subsidiary in China during this time period was
Growing Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., located in Qingpu. Operations did not begin
for its facility until February 2010.


But even if there were other revenue generating subsidiaries, Shanghai Shining's
"flagship" product "Shining Essence" -- all by itself -- sends its revenue into the
stratosphere, according to documents filed in the SEC (March 2010 10-k).


We launched Shining Essence in Shanghai in April 2001, and it [sic] currently our best-selling product.


Sales of Shining Essence represent approximately 29% of our total sales for the year ended March 31,


2010...


If so, 2009 revenue for Shining Essence alone would be over $20,000,000 USD, squashing the $530,000 USD


claimed in China.


Do we have a serious conflict between Chinese and US revenue claims? At this point in
China-Biotics' story, we have a forensic question and not a financial one. Imagine that
someone is murdered -- hit over the head with an accounting book. Columbo arrives but
the chief stops him at the door, "Sorry. You can't solve this one, You're not an accountant."
We're in a similar situation. At this point we are not yet concerned with China-Biotics'

finances, as claimed; we are concerned with a physical verification of a conflict underlying
and taking priority over this claim. Is the conflict real? If the conflict is real, then it is
meaningless to work with the reported numbers.


I'd like to keep the following presentation as simple and free of interpretation as possible.
A fingerprint can be worth a thousand words, and while I don't quite have the equivalent of
a fingerprint here, I will get as close as I can to the forensic discipline. I will present the
key number -- revenue -- in a way that will allow one to directly observe the evidence and
judge for oneself with as few intermediaries as possible.


Two different copies of the 2009 Income Statement arrived through Inter-credit (click to
enlarge images):


One with Shanghai Shining's seal (pg. 72) ....


.. and another copy without the seal (pg. 76)...


They are otherwise identical.


Is it Shanghai Shining? Here's a screen shot of the official web site, with the URL --
shiningbt.com -- and Chinese characters for Shanghai Shining at the top of the page.


Note how the company name on the official website matches the name on the official
documents received from the Chinese government.

Is this a document from the Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce (digital
pg. 68)?


(Or, compare the Chinese characters in the official document with the official web site in
Chinese. (English web page is here.)


Here is Shanghai Shining revenue for 2009.


Using the Google translator we can verify the Chinese.


"一，营业总收入" means "Total Revenue"
"利润表" means "Income Statement"
"上期金额" means "Previous Period"


You can see a "live" translation here.


"本期金额 " was a little tricky. When side-by-side, Google translates them simply as
"amount."  A more precise translation of this key term can be deduced however. In the
2009 statement, the amount for 上期金额 (Previous Period column) matches the amount
for the 本期金额 column in the 2008 statement. It's a bit of a logical pretzel but here goes:
What is referred to in this year's statement as last year's number would in last year's
statement be this year's number.


But there is another reason why I chose to show these two reports together. Note the
amount in the 2009 statement for the column, "Previous Year." It matches the current year
in the 2008 statement which Chinese Company Analyst independently received,
translated, and published last year. See it here.

So total revenue for 2009 was 3,440,950.61 RMB - which is approximately $530,000 USD.
Of course this is using today's exchange rate.


Using the exchange rate of December 31, 2009, we come up with different numbers.


May 7, 2011 3440950.61 CNY x 0.154 = 529,906 USD


Dec. 31, 2009 3440950.61 CNY x 0.146 = 502,379 USD


But we're not comparing an elephant to an elephant here; rather, an elephant to a mouse.
For the same time period, CHBT reported revenue of $71,376,507. We could look at the
numbers filed in China from 2008 to 2009 and note the decline in revenue of 253,971
RMB. But to note that Shangai Shining was losing market share would be like noting that
Bruce Willis had a receding hairline. Revenue from 2009 as claimed in China comes up
short 70 million dollars when compared to the SEC filings.


Now if I cut the relevant pieces from the evidence and paste them into a single graphic we
wouldn't exactly have Leonardo da Vinci but we would have something like a fingerprint.
There is definitely a conflict between the SEC filings and the filings made to the Chinese
government. At least one of these documents is incorrect and will need to be restated.


Can this all be explained by a difference in accounting systems? A gap in GAAP? Seventy
million versus five hundred thousand dollars? (That's a ratio of 140 to 1.) I don't think so.

5/21/2018 China-Biotics' 2009 Revenue Is $70M Off - China-Biotics, Inc. (OTCMKTS:CHBT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/269961-china-biotics-2009-revenue-is-70m-off 5/17


During this same time period CHBT was supposedly operating over 100 retail outlets and
these were supposed to be making a significant contribution to revenue. Then on August
30th, 2010 a crisis unfolded. Short sellers dared the company to prove that the retail
outlets existed. The company quickly posted a list of 79 addresses (even though it had
claimed 103 outlets at this time). Investigators immediately visited 43 of those locations
and took photos. Only two of the visited locations were Shanghai Shining "dedicated retail
outlets." The great majority of the addresses were supermarkets, business and residential
buildings, a parking lot, a cigarette store, a hotel, a department store ... (see here).


In the SEC 10-Q, September 31 (that's just one month later) CHBT claimed to have
closed 95 outlets. To this day we do not have a credible address list for the claimed retail
outlets.


Which makes more sense?


A) CHBT closed 95 outlets in a single month because the heretofore profitable "roll
out" took a sudden and unexpected turn for the worse.


or


B) The stores were fiction to begin with and telling investors that they were "closed
down" eliminated the need to prove their existence. (here and here).


Now with the 2009 SHAIC documents in our hands, we have a choice to trust the SEC
documents or the Chinese filings (or perhaps neither).


Which makes more sense?


A) In 2010, the company closed 95 outlets in one month -- with an increase in
revenue for the quarter! -- and after using many of those same retail outlets in 2009
to pull in 71 million dollars in revenue.


or


B) Most of the outlets never existed, and an annual revenue of $500,000 confirms
that.

Download a copy of the 2009 SAIC/SHAIC document here. The copy was ordered
through Inter-credit. There is also an independent and professional translation of the 2009
Income Statement for Shanghai Shining. The document must be downloaded into an
Adobe Reader first: here.


 Note that CHBT's fiscal year ended Mar. 31, 2010. For a more accurate comparison with
the Chinese filings, I refer to January 1 through December 31 2009.)


In the documents themselves, there are different sets of numbers at the top right and
bottom of the page. Since these page numbers are sometimes different, missing, skipped,
restarted, or repeated, I opted to use the page numbers in the Scribd navigator at the
bottom of the web page.


 Digital


本期金额 -- If you use a carriage return to split them up ...


"本期
金额"


... you find the translation as "Current Issue Amount," which is a bit closer to what one
would expect given that it is positioned next to the column "Previous period." Try it here.
Fortunately, the translation of this accounting term is nothing new, and there are web
based references that clear this up, many of which you can find here.


See my video analysis here.

How do you explain 132M dollars in cash though ? You are right, they can't both be correct but immediately assuming
one fi ling is correct over the other would be biased considering your short position.


Also the income statements you posted are in Chinese, they might be of 1 subsidiary of the entire company or even of
a company with a similar name. With emphasis on Might, because I don't speak Chinese and there for can't really
review your main source. Main point being I can't really know what your main source says.

After finding one critical failure, I need to present my case for that particular failure. I will necessarily not be
mentioning other aspects of the enterprise. If I presented a case for the missing cash, then you could ask me
why I neglected a case against the "incredible revenue. "


It really shouldn't matter though. Suppose I see a train from a distance. I see a locomotive and a set of
railroad cars behind it, all "obviously" on the track and ready to go. I've bet heavily on the successful
transportation of the cargo. Out of skepticism or curiosity I decide to test my investment at the distance of
actual contact. I put down the train schedule I've been reading and placing a lot of confidence in ... And I
actually walk up to the tracks. As I approach the tracks my perspective changes and it becomes apparent that
there are actually two sets of tracks, which couldn't be seen from my former point of view. In disbelief, I walk
closer and then actually pass between the two sets of tracks … the locomotive on one and the cargo on the
other. I walk back and tell the other investors that there is no way that this investment is going to pay off; the
locomotive is not even connected to the first car. To which I receive the rebuttal, "Yeah, but what about the
SECOND car? How do you explain THAT?"


One CRITICAL failure is enough, for those who work with reason. Nonetheless, several critical failures in
CHBT's claims have been demonstrated and have been available for months now, including cash. (see
seekingalpha.com/artic...). You might also read SEC filings for recently halted China RTO stocks and their
mention of bank confirmation difficulties.

It might be difficult to believe that a company only needs to lie and then choose the "right" auditor.


"The Parmalat fraud is the largest cash and investment confirmation fraud ever discovered, but it is not the
only case of confirmation fraud used to steal cash or falsify financial reports. Here is just a sampling of some
of the more significant public and private company confirmation frauds from recent years: Satyam (2008 -
2009), Take Two (2007), Ahold (2005 - 2006), Kmart (2005 - 2006), Refco (2004 - 2006), Parmalat (2003), All

2. We can restrict the debate to a single brand of this subsidiary as reported in the SEC and compare its
numbers to the total revenue of the same subsidiary as reported in China. Even if another revenue earning
subsidiary suddenly pops up, the story still fails on this one point alone. Please re-read the part of the article
that deals with Shanghai Shining's "flagship" brand: Shining Essence. Revenue for this alone, according to
CHBT's SEC filings, was over 20 million dollars. Sales exceed TOTAL revenue claimed in the Chinese filings
of the SAME subsidiary by a factor of 40 to 1.

If SAIC numbers are restated upwards what does that do with your theory ? For that matter, do SAIC have to be
legally restated if they are incorrect ? If so, show me precedence. What is the fine for not restating SAIC financials is
there is any ? Again, show me precedence. Furthermore, who audited the GAAP financials and who audited the SAIC
financials. FYI..... your a day late and a dollar short to this story. The SAIC'/GAAP reconciliation issues don't have the
"impact" with investors that it had six months ago.  
If the balance sheet and income statements are audited by a credible firm, verified and signed off as accurate than I
consider most of your points moot and your simply spinining your wheels with yesterday's headlines.

The other is BDO Limited, who changed their name after a merger.

You are using a guilt by association argument tactic. It is very immature and utilized by authors who cannot
effectively argue their point. Go back to school and try again.


15 May 2011, 03:37 PM 


Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  No. The post was, "If the balance sheet and income statements are audited by a credible
firm, verified and signed off as accurate ..."


The key phrase is "if they are credible" ... and I present the fact that BDO McCabe signed off on CTXI's cash.
The same organization once known as BDO McCabe then works under the name, BDO Ltd, Hong Kong. This
is not an association but a direct relationship.

It's kind of funny that different short-sellers are putting into print the very same article again and again. Personally and
at this point in the game, I think you guys are going to have to come up with something new and far more effective in
order to cash out your positions.

Short sellers must know when to stop. 
During the last months they make good money with a few Chinese reverse merger stocks, but now it seems
that the end of this game is near. 
Tomorrow GFRE will give a strong alarm to them.

redundancy. This is a presentation of the 2009 SAIC. They were retrieved independently of the 2007 and

CHBT's story does not match up.


When a (1) scientist submits his work to peer review, (2) others seek to independently confirm or disprove it.
Step 2 is not meaningless because step 1 had been taken; it is a crucial part of the process of determining
what is real and what is not. The original scientist and the peers who attempt to repeat his work are not doing
the same thing.

2.2mil shares. 
I am sure that they will be all attwitter with your info. This was news on Fidelity. 
I bought a bunch at $7.60 last month, waiting with bated breath for the earnings announcement and info on the

How many other stocks were up over 50% in the last month?

The earnings in PR will be whatever the company needs them to be. No surprise here.


Aug. 2010 PR says that Yangling will take two years to complete. I recommend that you take a few deep breaths.

That is true about Yangling but Ph 1 of the Quingpu plant is still ramping up and phase 2 comes online around July. I
have been in and out of this stock since 2009 but their time is fast coming and I am up over 50% since last month.
They are the largest probiotics mfr in China with only a tiny market share. I expect when Yangling (animal feed) is
underway they will announce more expansion of the human probiotics in 2012.

Nice presentation Matt. The only caution is that no one in the PRC government gives a rat's ass how precise the
numbers are into the SAIC. If they do question it, it is a small fine. On the other hand, tax documents are of highest
importance. Think about it. The Chinese tax officials want money and they have access to SEC filings just like
anybody else. If they saw larger revenue in the SEC filings than in their SAT documents dont you think the Chinese
tax officials would want to check it out? Yet you never hear of such a case. That’s because the company’s SEC
figures have matched the Chinese SAT tax figures just like they should. The companies spend money on SAT and
SEC figures because they are very important to survival. SAIC figures mean squat. Many companies just pay a local
agent a small fee to file SAIC based on whatever financial documents they give to the agent. To put in appropriate
audited figures into the SAIC can cost an extra 50-100k in auditing expense. Some companies see no good reason to
spend that extra money. Good luck with this.

The maximum penalty applied is the closure of your business … which is not a small fine.


The saic also says that the penalty for gross fraud is also the closure of the business by the same procedure
outlined above.

These need to be prepared and submitted to seven different government departments, namely the bureau of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, the financial bureau, customs, the *** STATE ADMINISTRATION OF
TAXATION ***, the local tax bureau, the ***ADMINISTRATION OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE,*** and the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange."  
www.bjreview.com.cn/bu...


Note that the same audited documents are filed with the SAT and the SAIC. I cannot imagine them tolerating
or expecting two sets of books.


Nor would it be cheaper to have two audits or keep two sets of books. It would be extra work, if not insane, to
create a new and false set of books for a single government agency "just because they didn't care." On the
contrary, if the agency didn't care, using the same set of books and documents that you are already preparing
would be the cheapest and most efficient way to submit the documents.


Also, if a government agency asks for an audited document I think that they have placed some importance
upon that document.


I cannot imagine that an accountant could file a false audit to a government agency and that NOT be a crime
for both the company and the auditor.

I am curious to see what happens here. The audit reports that I have seen for the SAIC are usually called a
"qualified opinion report" with exceptions since the SAIC auditors will specifically state in a letter that they do
not have all the documents they need for a unqualified report. I would be interested to see if you have found a
SAIC report for CHBT with an accompanying letter that states it is based on an unqualified audit opinion. I
hope it all works out. I don't hold a position in CHBT but I'm definitely checking them out.

CHBT has been in a downtrend for awhile now as seen here. screencast.com/t/tEu02DOy but recent price action has
this giving 2 green lights on the daily and weekly timeframe.


The best course of action is to wait for this to roll over and get short.

Anyone long this stock for the long term because they "believe" in the company is extremely nieve. You really believe
that the company closed down 95 stores (isn't that about 75% of their outlets?) in one quarter even though they were
all profitable and still reported increased sales? David Einhorn has written a book call "Fooling Some of the People All
of the Time". I have not read it but the title always comes to mind when I hear a desperate bull trying to chastize a well

I will reply with 1 statement on that:


China Biotics has 132.29M in cash.  
But of course you just don't believe that either right ? It's just the banks that are in on the fraud. While we are at it, I
bet the Chinese government is in on these frauds wouldn't you agree.


The revenue you say the company has can in no way explain their current amount of Cash. Well, unless you're in total
