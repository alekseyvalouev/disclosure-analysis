KEYW: Infecting Investors With A False Sense Of Security?

* Editor's Note: The following story is the second installment in a detailed investigative
report on KEYW. Simply click here for immediate access to the earlier article.


The more cash that KEYW (Nasdaq: KEYW) blows on acquisitions to pursue its capital-
intensive growth strategy - without unlocking the fabulous potential that management sure
liked to trumpet whenever it tried to justify those expensive deals - the more the bleeding
rollup company seems to conveniently RELAX ITS STANDARDS for success.


Go back and look at the compelling story that KEYW presented to the press a couple of
years ago, when it first arrived on the scene as a young public company bursting with
fresh promise, and compare the glorious visions that management shared back then with
the stark results that the swaggering upstart actually went on to deliver instead. In a bold
(if misplaced) show of confidence ahead of an embarrassing setback, KEYW predicted
that it would capitalize on its relentless shopping spree by not only enhancing its role as a
prime contractor on big-budget government projects but also by maximizing the future
performance of all the obscure firms that it kept on swallowing - casually boasting that "30
percent organic growth is achievable" right off the bat - once it fully digested those
acquisitions into its own system and transformed them into a fresh layer of muscle.


Eager to showcase its early progress a few months after debuting on the Nasdaq
exchange, KEYW bragged that it already generated two-thirds of its revenue from coveted
prime contracts and practically assumed that its share of that high-margin business would
further expand along with its escalating size. Unable to land a prominent $700 million
government contract or even maintain some of the lucrative projects that it already
supervised, however, KEYW wound up playing a secondary role on so many of the
accounts that it inherited - with prime contracts accounting for barely one-quarter of its
revenue by 2012 - that the company emerged from its costly shopping binge looking more
like a lowly subcontractor than ever.


Since KEYW has largely manufactured its top-line growth by simply purchasing other firms
and then booking their revenue as its own, the ravenous defense contractor still looks like
a typical rollup company, too. To be sure, KEYW has yet to approach the impressive
levels of organic growth that management supposedly regarded as "achievable" back
when its young stock staged its first remarkable (if temporary) rally. Even based on the

generous formula that KEYW prefers to calculate its organic growth - selectively including
any new business that it has added while conveniently excluding any prior business that it
has lost - the company has fallen well short of the incredible productivity gains that it
originally promised and, two years later, now seem hopelessly beyond its reach.


Take the financial results that KEYW ultimately reported for 2011, the year that began with
management prematurely suggesting that the company would grow its existing business
by 30% before the firm had even flipped past the first page of its new 12-month calendar.
By the time that KEYW actually closed its books on that disappointing year, losing its bid
for one gigantic contract and its grip on a major Air Force account rapidly shrinking to a
fraction of its original size, the company needed to lean on its most liberal measure of
organic growth just to reach the midpoint of its faraway target.


Once KEYW properly adjusted that figure to reflect the withered contribution that it actually
realized from that dwindling Air Force contract, however, the company netted such a
modest bump in sales from its core business - up a mere 8% overall - that its legitimate
organic growth rate technically fell into the single digits instead.


Although KEYW dutifully pledged to reaccelerate its organic growth rate after it posted that
glaring shortfall, the company actually went on to net even smaller gains the following
year. When 2012 ended with yet another slide in its own contributions to the top-line
growth that it had otherwise acquired, in fact, KEYW seemed a little panicked by those
lackluster results itself. After all, KEYW resorted to some rather curious moves -
repeatedly contradicting itself in the process - by providing investors with all sorts of
figures for its organic growth rate while restricting their access to the underlying financial
data required to simply calculate (or at least verify) that vital measure on their own.


KEYW offered up its first set of vague numbers back in early February, when the company
hosted a conference call to review its year-end results ahead of the official 10-K filing that
would finally surface - with a fresh supply of figures -- more than a full month down the
road. Pressed for a routine metric that it nevertheless seemed reluctant to disclose, KEYW
evasively pegged its organic rate somewhere "in the low double digits (but) over 10%" and
then minimized the probing that followed by simply ending the conference call. Even when
KEYW issued its formal 10-K five weeks later (just two days ahead of the final deadline),
the company still hesitated to settle on a concrete figure for that crucial measure of its
performance and elected to provide a wide assortment of possibilities instead.

5/22/2018 KEYW: Infecting Investors With A False Sense Of Security? - KEYW Holding (NASDAQ:KEYW) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1506442-keyw-infecting-investors-with-a-false-sense-of-security 3/12


KEYW started by claiming an organic growth rate of 10%-even, at least slightly lower than
the double-digit increase that its CFO had twice suggested in response to direct questions
about the matter when the company verbally previewed its official financial results. By
once again ignoring the gutted Air Force contract that had continued to hamper its
performance for another year, however, KEYW managed to push that figure up to 12%
and arrive at the range that its top financial officer (the former CFO of a puny defense
contractor tarnished by a notorious stock promotion) had previously led investors to
expect. Indeed, just a few pages after completing that elaborate math assignment, KEYW
decided to try out yet another formula that - by retaining credit for several cancelled orders
this time - shoved its organic growth rate all the way up to 16% and therefore served its
purposes even better still.


At that point, however, KEYW had already taken the obligatory step of subtracting all of
the revenue that it never collected to expose the humble nature of its legitimate progress.
Without any help from those illusory sales, KEYW revealed a meager 5% boost to its core
business that literally ranked as the weakest gain ever documented by the glorified rollup
company.


Secret Formula


Still undeterred in spite of its latest shortfall, KEYW proceeded to recite the same familiar
vow that it had by then broken for years. This time, management decided to shoot for an
organic growth rate of "at least 20%" that - even when measured according to its most
liberal standards - KEYW has yet achieve since it originally impressed investors as a
brand-new public company.


By the time that KEYW closed the books on its dismal first quarter to reveal its widest miss
in a year, however, the company had already run into at least one thorny problem that
threatened to poke a gaping hole in its rosy forecast. Notably, back when KEYW issued
that lofty guidance and tried to justify its bullish view, the company pointed directly at
"Project G" - an elusive cyber-security platform for the commercial market -- as one of
three primary drivers behind its projected gains. Although KEYW somehow managed to
develop that groundbreaking system from scratch within the span of four short months,
however, the company has by now spent almost a full year simply conducting beta tests
on its new platform - originally slated for widespread release in "early 2013" - so that it can
supposedly perfect its mysterious breakthrough before it officially hits the marketplace.

Since KEYW initially began testing its new security platform last summer, when a handful
of "early adopters" began trying out the service at little or no cost, the company has
already missed two deadlines FOR THE LAUNCH OF THAT OVERDUE PRODUCT and
recently hinted at potential delays to a third. Now that KEYW has postponed the release of
its new system from early 2013 to the third (or even the fourth) quarter of the year, the
company itself readily admits that it no longer expects to generate any meaningful
revenue from the celebrated platform that had ranked as such a promising source of
organic growth a few months earlier.


KEYW cannot exactly count on outsized gains from the two acquisition targets that
rounded out its short list of growth drivers, either. Stung by rejection when it tried to score
a big-budget government project as a young public company, KEYW spent a fortune last
fall to acquire Poole & Associates - paying even more than it had commanded when it first
began trading on the public stock exchange -- so that it could gain control of a juicy
government contract that it would have otherwise serviced as a mere subcontractor
instead. KEYW proceeded to miss Wall Street estimates for both of the quarters that
followed that expensive deal (ironically financed by growth-hungry investors who footed
much of the bill), however, with the company blaming Poole for the major downturn in its
margins and the recent slowdown in its growth that have since pressured its financial
results.


In essence, by deliberately pursuing a big-ticket acquisition that both diminished its status
as a prime contractor and limited its prospects for organic growth, KEYW arguably
sacrificed the very benefits that the company has long used to rationalize its costly (and
inherently risky) rollup strategy.


No wonder KEYW seems reluctant to provide investors with the details necessary to
measure its true performance on their own. By rushing to combine its financial results with
those of the firms that it keeps on acquiring, KEYW alone maintains full control over the
telling information required to determine whether the company achieves (or even
approaches) the solid organic growth that it inevitably promises year after year.


When KEYW came under pressure to quantify that crucial metric a few months ago,
prompting management to grudgingly substitute a ballpark figure instead, the company
itself literally claimed some measure of ignorance about the exact contributions that it had
made.

5/22/2018 KEYW: Infecting Investors With A False Sense Of Security? - KEYW Holding (NASDAQ:KEYW) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1506442-keyw-infecting-investors-with-a-false-sense-of-security 5/12


"For example, with Poole, we immediately integrate the operations," KEYW Chief
Executive Officer Leonard Moodispaw rushed to explain at the time. "So it's very difficult
then to figure out precisely how much came from the acquisition and how much was work
that we already had, now that one plus one equaled three …


"The good news is we merge them together very quickly," he further insisted. "So we're
not being coy about it."


Lax Security


Still, KEYW apparently sees little reason to operate under the same restrictions that
typically apply to most companies that trade on any sort of respectable stock exchange.


Granted the freedom to withhold material details about its business due to the secretive
nature of its government contracts, KEYW looks even stingier than a typical rollup
company that buys most of the growth reflected in its complicated financial statements.
Despite the potential for abuse created by that situation, however, KEYW has adopted a
downright cavalier attitude toward corporate oversight.


Just look at the potential conflict that KEYW casually risked when the company
established its compliance department, for example. By appointing none other than the
daughter of its CEO to serve as its chief compliance officer, KEYW has effectively placed
her in charge of policing her own father (who, in turn, happens to double as chairman of
the ethics committee) and preventing the sort of reckless actions that have already
backfired at other rollup companies. While Moodispaw never bothered to mention that
relationship when discussing his compliance department with The Washington Post a
couple of years ago, he clearly revealed his open disdain for pesky restrictions that might
inhibit the rapid expansion that KEYW has pursued under its aggressive growth strategy.


"To help us manage," Moodispaw volunteered at the time, "we have a director of corporate
compliance (who's) responsible for looking at any new policy/procedure that comes along
and saying, 'Do we have to have that? If we've got to have it, does it have to be 20 pages?
Can it be two pages" instead?


KEYW must have breezed right through the paperwork for its $125 million buyout of Poole
last fall, despite the paltry $235,000 listed on its balance sheet when it struck that record-
breaking deal, since it managed to extend a $35 million offer for Sensage - the partner
behind its overdue commercial platform - just a few days later.

5/22/2018 KEYW: Infecting Investors With A False Sense Of Security? - KEYW Holding (NASDAQ:KEYW) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1506442-keyw-infecting-investors-with-a-false-sense-of-security 6/12


As its own leaders emphasized from the start, KEYW primarily acquired Sensage so that it
could secure full control of Project G and largely regarded the existing services offered by
that firm as a minor bonus at best. Nevertheless, KEYW has effectively doubled down on
Sensage, anyway. When KEYW placed its hopeful (if premature) bet on Project G as a
major driver of organic growth this year, the company also assumed that Sensage would
enjoy surging demand for its older services, too, providing the company with the extra
boost that it would need to finally hit its impressive targets for a change.


By the time that KEYW presented that healthy forecast, however, the company had
arguably owned Sensage long enough to at least shake its remarkable confidence in that
bleeding firm. Within a few short months of taking full control of Sensage, in fact, KEYW
had not only given up on its original schedule for the widespread release of Project G but
also recognized that its new partner had overestimated potential orders for its existing
services by a significant margin.


Since then, KEYW has gone on to further postpone the launch of its new commercial
platform - abandoning a deadline regarded as crucial until management cancelled it - and
report an even wider loss than the market had previously expected due to the swelling
cost of that extended project. Although KEYW has now pledged to burst onto the
commercial market with its long-awaited breakthrough sometime in the third quarter (set to
begin mere weeks from now), the company has yet to even announce a formal name for
that celebrated platform, let alone provide an official price list - still under review itself - for
its overhyped services.


Indeed, by the time that KEYW confirmed that third-quarter deadline with
TheStreetSweeper last month, its own CEO had already backed away from that schedule
and hinted at further delays.


"I expect to open the doors, making it more broadly available later in the year -- perhaps in
the fourth quarter, late third quarter," Moodispaw conceded this spring, with the earlier
date (still two months away at that point) already sounding a bit like an afterthought. But
"we don't expect significant revenue for G in 2013 … Nothing's changed in that regard."


In reality, KEYW has changed its tune so many times by now (revising the launch date for
Project G two or three times since it began testing that supposed breakthrough less than a
year ago) that even the company itself may have easily forgotten all of the outdated
versions of its original story. Of course, with KEYW currently sporting a generous $500
million market valuation that effectively rewards the company for promises that it keeps on
breaking, its trusting investors also look remarkably forgetful themselves. Given the high

stakes for all parties involved, TheStreetSweeper felt compelled to close by providing a
detailed chronology of noteworthy revisions for those who might need some more jarring
reminders to refresh their stale memories.


History Lesson


"I don't intend to be prolific with announcements touting some tactical or incremental
event or news not meaningful to KEYW. I do intend to communicate, as clearly and openly
as possible, about matters that really impact our strategy and risks associated with
achieving it. … The Aura contract opportunity, with one of our major customers, has grown
to be a seven-year, $700 million program to deliver next-generation intelligence
community capabilities using agile systems integration methods. We delivered our
proposal during December 2010 and expect a decision in mid-2011. (But) we expect to
continue high organic growth regardless of specific contracts."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Letter to Shareholders (Jan. 5, 2011)


"We don't … worry about having a contract in hand or a new task (order). If we see
something that needs to be done, we just go do it and the contract catches up. And we
have never failed to get the contract."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Article in The Washington Post (Jan. 24, 2011)


"We believe we're going to continue to grow 20% to 30% organically a year, without
considering the Aura contract. Demand for what we do is very strong. We have over 100
contracts. We're the prime contractor in about 40% of those and the subcontractor in the
rest. Part of our strategy is growing the prime contractor relationship in which we are
closest to the customer."


-- KEYW Chief Strategy Officer, Article in Reuters (June 3, 2011)


"While the award of the Aura contract to a competitor is disappointing, we continue to see
abundant opportunities for continued high growth … Our strategy and success are not
dependant on any single contract or opportunity."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Press Release (Sept. 26, 2011)


"We don't go out looking for companies. I don't know of a single company we've acquired
that hasn't in effect knocked on our door and said, 'We want to join up with you.'"


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Article in the Baltimore Business Journal (Oct. 26, 2011)

"We have known each other for years and worked together for years. But most recently,
after the contract was awarded (to Poole), we began chit-chatting about how it might be
useful to be together. So I would say, back in the spring, we started talking about how to
do it and when to do it and so on … Obviously, they are prime on the very large contract;
we are a subcontractor to them … Mike (Poole) and I would have gotten it done in a day,
but for lawyers and bankers and accountants making it much more difficult."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Conference Call (Sept. 11, 2012)


"The acquisition price of $126 million is a significant premium to the $60 million and $90
million in expected revenue that the press release states for 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Given that high valuation, I would assume there is visibility of significant growth beyond
2013. Could you talk about what you see (that) gives you the sense of visibility that this
should be so highly valued relative to near-term revenues?"


-- Noble Financial Group Analyst, KEYW Conference Call (Sept. 11, 2012)


"Visibility implies that I have data - or that I have good, solid facts - so I don't want to
dignify it by saying that … I can't give you specifics, (but) we are quite comfortable with the
growth that will follow on this."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Conference Call (September 2012)


"The acquisition of Sensage accelerates our pace and our ability to respond to
(commercial) demand. Picture giving some steroids to the parrot in his food and seeing
how fast it can go; that's what Sensage helps us do. So we're going to get further - and
faster - than we would have without Sensage … We believe, with their contribution, it will
enhance the profitability and speed with which we could roll out G, which at the end of the
day makes G more profitable for us. (The) early adopter phase is going to take us through
the fall, so to the end of the year … You won't see much in terms of announcements
related to G until the end of the year or early spring, when we say it's now generally
available."


-- KEYW Senior Management Team, Conference Call (Sept. 13, 2012)


"In July 2012, we announced the installation of our new cyber-awareness and response
platform, code named 'Project G,' in its first operational network … We expect to continue
working with Project G early adopters through the end of 2012, with general release of the
Project G platform in early 2013."


-- KEYW Prospectus for Secondary Offering (Sept. 26, 2012)

"The commercial phase of what we call 'Project G' is already starting … The software will
be generally available in the second quarter, as we have planned, and we're on pace for
that. We are finishing up two of the three early adopters, (NYSEARCA:AND) we are
picking up the pace … So, in a sense, I believe we're ahead when it comes to the
commercial phase of G … We fully expect to have it out - those core capabilities - in the
second quarter."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Conference Call (Feb. 7, 2013)


"We don't make it easy for people who write about us, because we don't give guidance.
And I know that some folks were, I'll say, wildly optimistic about our results, and they may
be disappointed. But we're very pleased, and we think we did a good job … We expect to
continue growing double-digits this year. (Right now), we're in the low double-digits in
terms of organic growth … Obviously, we have the impact of Sensage and Poole in
(overall) numbers. But if you strip that out, we're still over 10%."


-- KEYW Senior Management Team, Conference Call (Feb. 7, 2013)


"Getting (Project) G generally available in the second quarter is so important to us
because RSA cost us a lot of money and because we want to keep - and must keep - our
development team focused on G. (But) we have taken our time to do it right. We don't
want to go out and fail. We'd rather take time and be one month late and have it right than
be one month early and have to go 'Oops.' So we're going through that."


-- KEYW Senior Management Team, Analyst Day (March 1, 2013)


"We've been working with the commercial side for quite some time. For example,
everybody's heard, I think, about Project G … But Project G just happens to be there
because Projects A through F are things that we didn't talk a whole lot about."


-- KEYW Chief Executive Officer, Analyst Day (March 1, 2013)


"In 2012 and 2011, we recorded inventory reserves of $963,000 and $471,000,
respectively, for certain products where the market has not developed as expected."


-- KEYW Annual Report (March 12, 2013)


"Organic revenue, addressed in more detail in the segment discussion below, increased
$10 million - or 5% -- on a net basis, including the reduction in our services segment
related to the Air Force services, a contract reassignment of $14 million and the absence
of the Integrated Solutions production contract of $6 million from 2011. Absent these three

"The company determined that it had achieved technological feasibility during the third
quarter of 2012 on certain software being developed. (However), as of March 31, 2013,
(Project G) was not yet available for sale."


-- KEYW First-Quarter 2013 Report (April 30, 2013)


"Our gross margin's … down from where we were, due to the reliance we have on
subcontracted labor, predominantly from the Poole acquisition. our cash from operations
was basically zero for the quarter - which was significantly better than it was last year …
We're still growing, as you can tell - 14% above where we were last year - but not in terms
of the numbers that we were hoping for."


-- KEYW Chief Financial Officer, Conference Call (May 1, 2013)


"G's functional, and it's being deployed. What we learned, however, is the necessity for
very thorough upfront analysis could be more extensive than we anticipated. (NYSE:SO)
we're not planning to install and deliver more G platforms until we're satisfied that these
initial deliveries are working smoothly. Thus, as I said before, we don't expect significant
revenue for G in 2013 … Perhaps next year, at the end of this year, we will extend and
expand our marketing efforts to bring on more customers, but we've got more than what
we're ready to deal with right now … The early adopters, we had three. One, we were able
to talk about, which is AT&T, which is going through reorganization … So we really haven't
gone far with them … The first installations, we are less concerned about pricing. the way
we're working these first ones is to get those systems installed and to make sure they're
working before we beat the customer up for the cost therefore … It is less important to us
right now to have that paid upfront before we open the doors … I want to try and clarify a
terminology because I think, between us all, we may have confused things. So for some
time, we've been talking about G being generally available in the second quarter. And
when I said we're on track - we're ahead of the game - it's because my definition of that

has been, and I think we've said this, when the platform is ready to go out to customers …
I don't want to get hung up on the terminology of 'what's an early adopter?' (or) 'when is it
generally available?' The product is ready to go, is gone, is out being installed. It might be
ahead of pace. We could be installing more. If that meets somebody's definition of general
availability, so be it. (Meanwhile), we don't need another thing in terms of acquisitions … If
we don't make an acquisition in either side (of the business), we're going to continue to
grow and be successful."

Last line says it all. They are short KEYW. This team is following, very closely, the same trajectory they did with Essex
Corp. After a very bumpy ride, investors were rewarded handsomely for their patience with Essex. This is a solid
company, with a good long range game plan, and very well conected in government contracting. Cyber security will be
a priority in government, utilities, and a vast market that is currently under served, and under protected. I have no
doubt that KEYW will emerge as a player in that space.

the tone is truly slamming just like any short. yes, they have disappointed, but i believe they show promise. anyone
who has dealt with the government knows contract delays are the norm. things go slower than one ever ever thinks.

i don't know but the stock price thinks it's a buy. This author is an idiot. G will be in every company that wants to know
whats going on with their network, EVEN FROM THE ALLOWED USERS. Talk about watching. No longer will
employees be able to download hugh data files to sell. G is watching. AND it doesn't compete with other security
vendors, G is unique! 
Been watching since 14.50 through 11.50 and NOW 13.50 Geez no letup!
