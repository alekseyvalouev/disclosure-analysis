Mindray Medical: The Smoking Gun
Jan. 17, 2014 9:05 AM ET29 comments
by: Ottoman Bay


On December 12th, 2013, Ottoman Bay released its first report on Mindray Medical
(NYSE:MR). In our original report, we detailed our findings in a 103-page slide deck,
which supports our view that Mindray Medical has systematically deceived investors and
regulators, including the SEC.


On December 13, 2013, Mindray Medical's management team released a response to our
beliefs. Not only do we believe Mindray's responses were intentionally misleading, but
management deliberately evaded some of the more serious concerns from our original
report.


In our report, we present the country level financials, from local registries, for each of
Mindray's operating subsidiaries. The financials confirm our beliefs that Mindray reports
inaccurate sales, has roughly 30% gross margins and has reported an operating loss in all
of European business.


Summary of New Findings:


1. Mindray Medical's business is a fraction of the business MR purports. Ottoman Bay
has obtained the "in country" filings, from local registries, of MR's operating
subsidiaries which confirm MR has been reporting substantially inaccurate sales, gross
margins and has been hiding operating losses in subsidiaries from US investors for
years.


2. We believe Mindray's earnings are materially overstated, by at least 30% and real
gross margins are 30% vs. the 60% the company claims. For example, in the
Netherlands & UK, MR's gross margins were just 6% and 30%, respectively.


3. So much like past Chinese frauds, "in country" filings confirm that the company has a
mere fraction of the cash it reports to the SEC.


4. Mindray's UK business has had 3 separate auditors in the last 3 years, of which 2
abruptly resigned. Investors should question what the auditors know that we don't.


5. MR's business has deteriorated so significantly in the last year that the core business
is now growing at sub 10% vs. the 17% full year guidance management gave in 2Q12
(-7% in 8 mos.). MR has propped up the ailing business solely by making dubious
acquisitions which the company refuses to disclose the contribution of.

6. Mindray's SEC financial statements are materially misrepresented, rendering them, in
our view, unreliable and inaccurate.


7. Mindray's shares are worth no more than $10.00/share, and will approach $0.00 as the
event risks unfold.


The Smoking Gun


We present smoking gun evidence, which confirms our initial belief that Mindray Medical's
business is a fraction of the business MR purports. Specifically, we requested and
compiled all of the "in-country" reported filings from local registries of each of Mindray
Medical's operating subsidiaries dating back to 2010. The documents present a company
that does not even remotely resemble the company that Mindray portrays to US investors
in its SEC filings. Furthermore, contrary to consensus perception, MR's international
business realizes gross margins of roughly 30% and has been hiding significant operating
and net profit losses in its subsidiaries for years.


More alarmingly, the "in country" filings confirm that the company has a mere fraction of
the cash the company reports to the SEC, so much like past Chinese frauds. Specifically,
Mindray's UK filings confirm that its business overseas is largely insolvent. We believe
Mindray's problems run deeper than unusual accounting. The MR story also comes with
misrepresented financials, multiple auditor resignations, hidden losses in subsidiaries and
governance abuses.


Given the gravity of these issues, we have notified the IRS and the SEC of the material
abuses at Mindray Medical. We believe Mindray Medical will restate several years of
filings as a result of the issues covered. Ottoman Bay contacted Mindray Medical on
several occasions and did not hear back from the Company, further confirming our
suspicion. Below we address these concerns in detail.


Mindray's International Revenues & Earnings Are a Fraction of the Amount MR
Claims


Ottoman Bay first became skeptical of the reported sales and earnings of Mindray's
International business when we discovered an interview dated 12/6/2012 between Lun
Tao (David) Yin, head of Mindray Europe and Oost NV, a regional business development
and investment agency in the Netherlands.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1951711-mindray-medical-the-smoking-gun 3/15


We noted numerous statements made by Managing Director of Europe Mr. Yin, which we
could not reconcile with the company's reported SEC filings.


In the interview, Mr. Yin, in fact, accurately disclosed the following:


Mindray apparently runs its entire +$100m European business through its location in
the Netherlands (Europe headquarters), which services 30 countries out of what is a
3,080 square meter office and a leased 1,380 square meter warehouse. See photo
below:


Investors can confirm via Google maps:


Mindray Medical Europe Headquarters


Address: Doctorandus W. van Royenstraat 8 3871 AN Hoevelaken, Nederland


More notably, Mr. Yin also said ― "We keep investing in Europe, and we will see in the
future if our business over here can be over 100 million or even 500 million US
Dollars. That's our target we'd like to achieve in the next 5 or 10 years."


Initially, we found this comment particularly strange because in 2012 Mindray reported
sales in Europe of $101m, up from $91m in 2011. Therefore, Mr. Yin was a mere $10m
away from his 5 year target in December 2012 when the interview was taken and just a
few days before MR closed its 2012 books to end its fiscal year. This disclosure implied
that the scale and profitability of MR's European business, as reported to the SEC, could
be far lower than the company claims.


To reconcile Mr. Yin's comments, we compiled all of the filings of MR's European operating
subsidiaries dating back to 2010. Specifically, we analyzed the 2011 public filings, as the
Netherlands 2012 filing has yet to be filed. Evidence shows that Mindray Medical has
been reporting inaccurate sales, gross margins and operating earnings to US investors for

years. After consolidating the results, MR generated 2011 revenues of just $67 million, an
operating loss of -4m a net loss of -14m and the losses continued in 2012 filings.
Furthermore, the $67m represents revenue for ALL of the UK, Spain, France, Italy, the
Netherlands & Sweden - incorporating many of the largest countries in Europe. MR's
European sales are a significant 31% lower than the $100m+ the company reports to the
SEC and in line with Mr. Yin's comments. Investors should note that in MR's most recent
press release, the company dubiously claimed that "Western Europe" was the key growth
driver despite filings which suggests that it is a money losing business and has been so
for years.


In 2011, MR claimed to generate $91m in sales. However, as can be seen below, country
level financials show substantially lower sales of $67m and net losses of -$14m. See chart
below.


Investors should note that we were unable to obtain the filings for Germany but through
earnings transcripts have gathered that it is a small portion of sales. Furthermore,
Mindray's CIS region is included in "other" in the company's reported filings. This segment
reported $147m in sales in 2012.


Hidden Losses In Subsidiaries


The most concerning revelation are the significant losses the company has been hiding
from US investors in its subsidiaries. In 2011, MR's largest businesses in Europe realized
a negative operating margin of -6% and a net margin of -21%. Notably, not a single
country reported operating margins higher than 12%. The UK, the Netherlands and
France reported significant operating losses and Spain and Italy reported op. margins of
just 4% vs. the consolidated 21% operating margins MR reports to the SEC. We find this
implausible and investors should question just how significant the losses MR is
experiencing for subsidiaries we could not obtain.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1951711-mindray-medical-the-smoking-gun 5/15


Note that in 2011, MR reported Europe revenues of $91m, which is an overstatement of
31% from the $67m MR discloses in its "in country" filings. Even after taking into
consideration consolidation issues a $22m discrepancy (the equivalent of 4 of MR's UK
businesses) is still significant given we accounted for all of the major countries in Europe
and MR has a segment titled Other, which purportedly did $279m in sak2011. Ultimately,
we believe that Mindray reports accurate financial figures to their own government
whereas they report fabricated financial figures to the U.S government and U.S. investors.


If MR cannot turn an operating profit in larger, mature European markets, that spend a
higher % per capita of GDP on healthcare, what does that imply for operating profit for the
rest of the business? Better yet, how many countries is MR reporting significant operating
losses that US investors do not know about?


We have included the filings for each of Mindray's operating subsidiaries below; investors
can also confirm that Mindray's financials are misleading for themselves:


1. Mindray Medical UK 2010
2. Mindray Medical UK 2011
3. Mindray Medical UK 2012
4. Mindray Medical Netherlands 2010
5. Mindray Medical Netherlands 2011
6. Mindray Medical France 2012
7. Mindray Medical Italy 2012
8. Mindray Medical Espana 2011
9. Mindray Medical Espana 2012


10. Mindray Medical Sweden 2010
11. Mindray Medical Sweden 2011
12. Mindray Medical Sweden 2012


Contrary to consensus belief, Mindray's UK segment is an inconsequential 6 million euro
business, which reports 30% gross margins, operating losses and carries a mere 643
thousand euros in cash.

What Has All of Mindray's Auditors Spooked?

MR's claims to be "transparent" are implausible. Its offshore structure, which utilizes
multiple British Virgin Island entities, is an unjustifiable black hole.


Another significant corporate governance abuse we identified is that Mindray uses
different audit firms for each of its subsidiaries, making checks and balances nearly
impossible. To compound matters, Mindray UK has had 3 separate auditors in the last 3
years, of which 2, abruptly resigned. In 2010, Mindray's UK auditor was Silver Levene
Audit, the auditor abruptly resigned during the year and was replaced by UHY Hacker
Young. Similarly, in 2011, UHY Hacker Young also abruptly resigned during the period and
was replaced by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Looking Past the Smoke and Mirrors


On Monday January 13th, Mindray Medical pre-announced 2013 full year earnings. The
company noted that revenues grew 14.3% YoY and Non-GAAP earnings grew 11.5%.
Specifically, the press release noted that "In 2013, we exceeded our revised financial

guidance with both our sales and non-GAAP net income". While analysts were quick to
superficially cheer the report, a deeper look into the numbers presents a more troubling
picture.


The Ugly Truth: Mindray's Core Business Has Deteriorated Significantly in 8
Months.


Mindray Medical's purported business has deteriorated so significantly in the last year that
the core business is now growing at sub 10% vs. the 17% full year guidance management
gave in 2Q12. This implies that the core business has deteriorated by -7% in the last year,
propped up solely by dubious, dilutive acquisitions the company made.


For starters, management has changed guidance 4 times in 2013, which should render
management's visibility valueless to investors.


In Q3, management completed the acquisition of Zonare Medical and Ulco Medical.
Management refuses to break out the contribution from acquisitions; therefore investors
have little visibility into the earnings power of Zonare Medical or Ulco Medical. However, in
fact, investors can back into the core businesses growth using Zonare's press releases
which released sales numbers. The financials imply that sales have been amplified by
acquisitions and the company faces declining demand for its products. We believe in
2013, MR experienced negative organic growth. See below.

Author’s reply »  They claim that office services 30 countries, watch the video. We provided the filings for
investors to corroborate. It is not simply tax arbitrage. They report 30% gross margins vs the 60%
consolidated they claim and MR reports "operating" losses in nearly all of the countries. It is clear that it is far
worse. Read the UK filings, the auditor reviews the business on a "going concern" basis.

you are still ignoring the export explanation, some sales in Europe can come from their Europe Division and
some from their China Division as exports. You only have the tax filings from the Europe division from a few
countries, to have a complete picture you need to have ever filing from ever country in the world, you can't
just pick a couple of divisions tax filings where margins are lower (and for tax reasons you would try to get low
as Europe is high tax and china is low tax) and try to claim margins are lower than they report. You could do
the exact same thing with Apple or Pfizer.


So you are trying to imply that a company with minimal debt and $1b in cash at Bank of China is going to go
bankrupt. That is just silly.

The accusations in the report are a bit odd. Germany is also a part of Western Europe and it is missing in the
numbers. Also you don't have to make a profit in Western Europe in order to be successful. Companies like Starbucks

"Ottoman Bay" is a moron, this ameutuer hour for sure. But what do you expect from a Michigan State graduate, do
they even have a business school? First off in the video he is talking to Europeans, and does not say USD, so the
implication is that he is referring to Euros. Ottoman Bay may not understand curreny, but a Euro is worth more than a
Dollar, so that would be well over $100m. There "in-country" filings miss Germany, the largest country in Europe, how
lame is this report.


17 Jan 2014, 12:17 PM


Ottoman Bay, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Comparably, the interviewer quotes Mr. Yin. You can confirm for yourself, its on the website.
This is pretty easy to fact check. Read the filings, if he were referring to Euros, the discrepancy would be
even wider. It might be helpful for you to read before you comment, just a suggestion.


How do you see the future for Mindray Medical in Europe?


“Mindray has a very good advantage in its product price and performance. We keep investing in Europe, and
we will see in the future if our business over here can be over 100 million or even 500 million US Dollars.
That’s our target we’d like to achieve in the next 5 or 10 years. Our growth is based on our innovations, so we
keep investing 10% of our yearly revenue into our R&D.”

Simple FX $100m euros are worth $130m USD. If they have $100m in USD sales $100m euros is 30%
growth. Listen to the video he never says $100m USD. How is this public access video in broken english your
"smoking gun"


As for europe, which is is their 4th and least important region, China, EM , US, and then Europe.


Plus, you completely ignore Mindrays explanation, they lose money on sales in europe due operating costs
that benefit exports from the china division for tenders and large contracts in Europe. It is called tax
arbartraige and is quite common, taxes in europe are much higher than china so you want your profits to be
made in China and have losses in Europe. Why do you think so many healthcare and IT companies are
bases in Ireland. I don't think you understand the difference between tax and reporting accounting, they are
meant to be different, you can not tie them like you are trying to do on a country tax to a corporate level they
would not match for any company. Are all companies frauds? And where is the support, normally on a got
short you have at least some public support, but all of the sell side disagree. All of the big shorters have
looked at this name and have past. 40% of this name is owned by 4 top instutional investors like ballie gifford

Your European data is very flawed. You only accumulated 5 countries - UK, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands &
Sweden - and you already get $67M.


Mindray's products are best suited for emerging nations who are price conscious. So in Europe, this means a portion
of its sales must come from countries in Eastern Europe and former USSR nations.


In fact, in their Q3-2013 earning transcript, the CEO specifically stated:


"In Asia Pacific, we did particularly well in Indonesia and the Philippines largely due to our improved brand
awareness, attractive products and good services.


In the CIS region, as discussed before, the tough sales comparison affected the year-over-year growth performance
in our single largest sales country there, Russia."

By not including Russia, you are missing out a big chunk of their European sales.


Also, you do not even include Germany - which typically accounts for 1/4-1/3 of European sales for most medical
companies.


Your research is very biased and your data is extremely flawed - structured primarily to support your short thesis.

Author’s reply »  The fundamental point is MR's entire European operation is NOT profitable. As you noted
yourself, "price conscious" customers nor do the "in country" filings support 60% industry leading gross
margins like MR claims. They are simply not profitable, nor do they have a business that reflects a 30% op.
margin. Read the filings provided, some of the subsidiaries have real equity issues and have experienced
multiple auditor resignations. Germany is not a meaningful segment and the CIS region is classified as "other"
which they claim did about $147m in sales in 2012. It clearly debunks your view point. The proof is in the
numbers, read the filings!

Ottoman Bay, would you mind providing your credentials as a research organization? The only information I was able
to find about you relates to your bashing of Mindray. Before I form an opinion about your comments, and taking into
account that you are a short seller, I would like to have some more information on your background or your
organization's background if it consists of more than one person. 
Thank you very much.

Outside tax arbitrage, hike transfer prices from China to Europe, to reduce EU taxes, which is legal and common (of

trying to imply that the European ultrasound industry has margins equal to the TV industry? 60% gross margins are
the industry normal, your 30% claim based on tax filings is just silly.

The following is a case study written about Mindray's early acquisition of Datascope by INSEAD - the top European
MBA program based in France.
