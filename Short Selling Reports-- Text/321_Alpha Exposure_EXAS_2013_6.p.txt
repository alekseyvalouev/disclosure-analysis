Exact Sciences - Appendix: Answering The Critics
Jul. 31, 2013 9:48 AM ET99 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


This article will respond to some of the criticisms levied at our analysis in our five-part
series on Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS). We stand by our analysis and believe we
have published a thoroughly researched and validated short thesis on Exact Sciences (the
"company"). We believe the evidence of Cologuard's impending failure is overwhelming
and believe it is the best short in our portfolio today. Our price target remains $3 per share
based on our expectation that Cologuard will fail in at least one (and likely all) of the four
areas needed for success: FDA approval, payer reimbursement, doctor prescriptions, and
patient compliance. As a reminder if any one of these four areas fails, the company's
commercialization efforts will fail.


We are first going to tackle a few the critiques found in Adam Feuerstein's (AF)
article here:


AF Critique 1 - "'Alpha Exposure' accuses Exact Sciences of misleading investors
by setting up an easy and rigged comparison between Cologuard sensitivity and
specificity and historical data on FIT sensitivity and specificity. The fund points to
Exact Sciences' recent investor slides comparing Cologuard to older, previously
published FIT data as proof the company is misrepresenting the accuracy of its
screening test. 'Alpha Exposure' is wrong. In the pivotal 'DEEP-C' study conducted
by Exact Sciences, all patients underwent screening for colon cancer using
Cologuard and FIT."


Adam Feuerstein misconstrues our arguments. We presented exactly what the company
published publicly. We even referenced this in article one here, where we stated "First, it
appears that Exact administered a FIT in its DeepC trial in order to compare the two tests
in an identical patient population. Exact clearly states a FIT was administered as a
comparison here. Exact then chose not to disclose the data generated in its trial and
chose to instead use an outdated 2005 FIT study done in Japan by Morikawa as the
comparator test."


We never stated that the company omitted any FIT data. We said that it was odd that the
company did not release the FIT results from the DeepC trial, not even the top line results,
as is customary for publication of preliminary top line results. Instead, the company
provided historical FIT data from a different study, which was the study with the worst FIT

outcomes we have seen. The company has never been shy about telling investors
positive information, so it makes us very suspicious that the company has chosen not to
reveal the performance of the FIT. Imagine if a biotech company touted successful top line
results of its cancer drug without releasing the results of the trial's control arm. Exact's
actions should be viewed with similar skepticism.


AF Critique 2 - "Cancer sensitivity is really 75%, not 88%. Pre-cancer sensitivity is
27%, not 43%, as 'Alpha Exposure' claims."


We re-ran our analyses with a cancer sensitivity of 75%, a pre-cancer sensitivity of 27%,
and a specificity of 97%. As you can see below, the InSure FIT still outperforms in every
category:

To be honest, we are unsure why AF would bring this up. His figures actually support our
case because his data is better than the numbers from the Morikawa study. We already
proved that the FIT is superior to Cologuard after adjusting for the differences in testing
frequency, even with the Morikawa numbers. If there is any other way critics would like us
to present the numbers, please let us know. We have yet to find a way to present the
cumulative efficacy of FIT vs. Cologuard that results in a win for Cologuard.


We will now address critiques made by Seeking Alpha Contributors (SAC):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1588472-exact-sciences-appendix-answering-the-critics 3/31


SAC Critique 1 - There is no proof that the cumulative efficacy of the various tests
is relevant.


Exact Sciences' CEO Kevin Conroy speaks over and over about the importance of
cumulative results and taking multiple tests. There are many examples of this. Quotes
from the 3Q 2012 transcript here, 4Q 2012 transcript here, and Citi Global Healthcare
Conference transcript here prove this:


"I would like to drive home the point that point-in-time sensitivity is not the most
important part of this test clinically. The impact of this test will be felt from
repeated screening and the cumulative sensitivity, like the pap smear, of
detecting pre-cancers, which take a long time to develop and turn into cancer."


"I, again, don't have any reason to believe that the sensitivity will fall to 85%
from 98%, but I want to make sure that we're setting expectations and driving
home the point that the real value of this test is in the cumulative sensitivity like
the Pap smear, which is -- which detects on average about 47% of
precancerous lesions for cervical cancer. But the real value is in repeat testing
and that increases the sensitivity over time."


"This shows you the power of repeat testing. This is why the pap smear has
basically eradicated cervical cancer in screen population because we have a
long period of time to detect something and you have over 50% chance to
detect it in any given time, repeat testing will find these precancerous polyps."


To further prove this point, as we mentioned in article five, CMS clearly states its opinion
on the bottom of page 44/top of page 45 here. CMS believes that the assumption of the
conditional independence of repeat FIT/FOBT screens is reasonable due to the fact that a
particular lesion may be bleeding during one test but not another. This drives home the
point that we have been making: the cumulative results of repeat testing are incredibly
important for patients tested with FITs.


However, CMS then states that this assumption does not hold for DNA stool tests because
regardless of whether or not a particular lesion is bleeding, its gene mutation is unlikely to
change and the chances of finding cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions will therefore not
increase from of repeated stool DNA tests. We can now see that cumulative sensitivity is
less important for Cologuard than for FIT.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1588472-exact-sciences-appendix-answering-the-critics 4/31


In summary, we believe it is appropriate to compare tests based on their recommended
frequency. This means comparing one year of Cologuard results with three years of
cumulative FIT results (or two years vs. six years, or three years vs. nine years, etc.). The
results are clear: over a three year period Cologuard is less effective than FIT.


SAC Critique 2- Contributors agree with AF that we cherry picked the best possible
data for the InSure FIT, which is unlikely to be the case, and we only performed our
results over three years, not allowing the cumulative effect of the Cologuard test to
be seen.


Below we present the results of re-running our analyses with a cancer sensitivity of 75%, a
pre-cancer sensitivity of 27%, and a specificity of 97%, and performed the test over a nine
year period. These numbers were also mentioned by "dejerzeus" and "Energy-Trader" in
their comments on Seeking Alpha here. As you can see below, the InSure FIT is still
dominant:


SAC Critique 3 - It is unfair to run the analysis without taking into account the
actual compliance adjusted rates of catching cancerous and pre-cancerous polyps.


We believe that compliance rates are directly related to the simplicity of the test and
inversely related to the amount of feces that a person is forced to handle. Therefore we
strongly believe that compliance will be better for the InSure FIT than Cologuard. In fact,
poor compliance rates were one of the main reasons that Exact's first two tests failed.
Nevertheless, we ran our analyses assuming 100% compliance for both the InSure FIT
and Cologuard, which in our opinion is unfair to the InSure FIT because compliance for
FIT will likely be higher than for Cologuard.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1588472-exact-sciences-appendix-answering-the-critics 5/31


Contributors have commented that it is less likely that a patient takes an additional test in
the subsequent years following a negative result. We wanted to address this criticism. As
was suggested in the comments, we performed a three year study of the Cologuard test
and the InSure FIT using the compliance and accuracy numbers deemed fair in our critic's
comments. We assumed compliance rates of 95.1%, 79.9%, and 66.2% for years 1, 2,
and 3 respectively, and we used a cancer sensitivity of 75%, a pre-cancer sensitivity of
27%, and a specificity of 97% for the InSure FIT. As you can see below, the InSure FIT still
outperforms in every category and for less money, even after being adjusted for declining
compliance over time.

SAC Critique 4 - If the Cologuard test is so bad, why hasn't there been any insider
selling?


Given the rate at which Exact Sciences is burning through cash, and the amount of cash
that it is going to need to commercialize Cologuard, the company will undoubtedly need to
raise more capital. This is much harder to do if it appears that management doesn't
believe in the company and is selling stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1588472-exact-sciences-appendix-answering-the-critics 6/31


SAC Critique 5 - As seen here, "defiance" stated that we should have included a
disclaimer, and shouldn't have criticized Exact Sciences for doing so.


Rather than hiding behind a meaningless disclaimer in smaller, harder to see font at the
bottom of the page, we came out and said, "Below is the expected performance of the
Cologuard test in a 10,000 patient group, identical to what the company used in its DeepC
test. This assumes that the test is given once every three years, as suggested by the
company. Below it, we show the FIT being administered to those same patients every year
for three years." We were open, honest, and forthright about all of our assumptions.


SAC Critique 6 - As seen in the comments here, "Ulysses Benjamin Dover" states
that "Also possible this hedge fund is in cahoots with a distant competitor or a
company that wants to buy Exact on the cheap."


We have no desire to own this company at all. We also believe industry leaders Quest
Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) and LabCorp (NYSE:LH) want nothing to do with Exact
Sciences either. As we disclosed, we are short.


SAC Critique 7 - It isn't fair to criticize the company for using a historic control
because they have not released the actual FIT data from the study.


If Cologuard performed so well against the FIT in the same study, why would Exact
Sciences only release data for Cologuard without releasing data for the FIT comparator?
The data is clearly available. If the data wasn't available, how would the company know
that the Cologuard outperformed? It is suspicious that the company would release one
piece of data without the other. After all, this isn't a company that is shy about announcing
positive news.


Further, if the DNA testing component of the test is so valuable, why didn't Exact release
the number of true positives that were caught because of it rather than the FIT included
with Cologuard? The company claims that this component is valuable. Why not release
top-line data to support this claim?


SAC Critique 8 - As can be seen here, "Energy-Trader" stated that, "Meanwhile,
Cologuard demonstrated 66% sensitivity for 2cm pre-cancerous polyps. Your
beloved FIT comes nowhere near that kind of performance."


The first part of the critique is true. Cologuard did in fact demonstrate 66% sensitivity for
2cm pre-cancerous polyps. That said, we are still unable to find any study that tracks this
data point, and have yet to find it as an endpoint for any study, FIT or otherwise, which

signifies to us that this is a meaningless clinical endpoint. With that being said, we have
nothing to compare this Cologuard data point to. Not surprisingly, Exact didn't provide this
information for the FIT. If you have this data, please post it in the comments below.


SAC Critique 9 - FITs and FOBTs as part of Digital Rectal Exams (DREs) are not
recommended by the American Cancer Society as a stand-alone test for colorectal
cancer.


This is true. It is also true that the NIH appears to think that DREs are a valid way to
collect stool for colorectal cancer testing. Frankly, we do not understand this criticism. We
were open and honest about this point and even included a link to the American Cancer
Society article in part three when we wrote, "DREs are also performed to collect stool for
sampling, which allows the doctor to perform the FIT or FOBT, as seen here and here."


We stand by our beliefs that getting tested using FITs or FOBTs during DREs is far better
than doing nothing, and that if a patient is unwilling to undergo these screens while at the
doctor's office as part of an annual check-up, than he or she is very unlikely to administer
a Cologuard test to him or herself at home.


In addition, "Energy-Trader" stated here, that FOBTs during DREs are only 9% sensitive to
cancer, which "disproves" that DREs can be used. Given that he or she is talking about
FOBTs and not FITs, this is using the wrong comparator. Further, this is not substantially
different from the FOBT performance cited by the company on slide 18 of its June 2013
report here.


SAC Critique 10 - The detection rates for stages I, II, III, and IV were never analyzed.


While we do not have the data for the Cologuard test, the complete data for the InSure FIT
is below and can also be found and explained in detail here:

As can be seen above, there appears to be no correlation between the stage of the cancer
and the probability that Insure FIT will detect the cancer.

Yes, you are correct.

dude give it a rest ... you've argued your points ad nauseum if you would have a loved one take FIT over Cologuard
have at it.... Cologuard has FIT built into it... contact the FDA and CMS halt the parallel review before it's too late and
billions of tx dollars are saved a long with millions of lives potentially world wide. This is a slam dunk for the Affordable
Care Act- you are correct in noting the problem is in getting people screened... you miss the point on precancer
sensitivity and the assumption that more dna is shed into the stool, sDNA, as the adedenoma grows becoming more
likely to be malignant. We have a serious issue with the right sided serile lesions as they are difficult to see- it is
believed these are faster growing i.e. more dangerous ... a positive with Cologuard slows the colonscopist down

Can you say short squeeze????


EXAS Short interest is now 10.07mm shares, just off all time highs of 10.26mm. Shorts as a % of float is
14.48%.


What does this mean???


Most traders putting on a short would use options as well as shorting the stock. With EXAS high Vol (62%) it
is not cheap. There is a large Open Interest (over 10,000) in the Jan 2014 $16 calls and puts... about 10x the
normal size.  
This is called a risk reversal... it helps lower your cost. You sell the $16 calls to buy the $16 puts.. With a delta

of 42 you are short about 500,000 shares. As the stock goes up your short increases...OUCH! That is a large
% of the float for an illiquid option/stock. After you put on the options, then you short the stock.


So what does AE do now????


For most trades, you need a catalyst to work. AE was hoping that his one sided analysis would get people to
jump on the bandwagon. What is now happening is EXAS is about $1 off all time highs... If AE's trading ability
is anything like their analysis, I would bet their trade is under water! If you are a good trader you need to
analyze your trade. When am I wrong? You have shot your wad and now under water!!! Uh Oh!!!!! with a high
number of shares short, high Short interest ratio and a very problematic short as a percentage of float, it could
be interesting times for the shorts!


This will be very interesting if EXAS keeps going up after AE has done everything they can to get EXAS to go
down!!! AE can now only hope that the overall market goes down... EXAS has a high beta so that could bail
them out of a bad trade. That's what AE is praying for now!


Good luck!

Remember when these clowns tried to credit their propaganda campaign for the drop in EXAS shares last week? Well
who gets credit for the recovery? How is Alpha Exposure going to find a way to keep this going after today? I wonder
how big Alpha's short position must be to justify this kind of effort? Every time I see the price of this stock go up, it
doubles my pleasure to think of Alpha sitting at his desk sweating and wondering how he is going to get out of this
mess.

Of course you didn't do it personally, or at least with the same profile. It just "appeared" in the Market

Ulysses Benjamin Dover
I compound money pretty well for me and mine. I think a few people know who I am and know I have been
long EXAS since the $1s and have made a lot in options. While I am willing to read what you write because
EXAS is a large long holding - we own about 1/2% of the company, the more I read the more I think you are
either a very small hedge fund losing money for friends and relatives, in which case you will need to do some
relationship repair soon or trying to stall the stock so it has a spring effect on a long option trade - I hope that's
the case because I'm long calls.


If you are really a short, let me give you a hint about shorting, do it better.


Regardless, the short thesis is wrong. EXAS will get FDA approval, and within 90 days of that CMS
payments. The test will take 2/3 of the FOBT/FIT market, not 1/3, within 3 or 4 years and will double all the
current earnings estimates and become a $60 stock in that time frame. Not sure what happens after that,
buyout or it becomes a major biotech.

The more and more that I read from this "author" the more and more I believe that this person has no science
background whatsoever.


It's downright mind-boggling for someone to argue that DRE can be used to obtain a fecal sample for a FIT test
because the NIH states that it can be done, on their website. Yes, it can be done. But it is not effective at all. More
flawed logic as usual.


For some reason, it doesn't seem to matter to this author that the American Cancer Society does NOT RECOMMEND
such a procedure and goes on to offer the following factual data that flies in the face of any reasonable logic
whatsoever:


ACS 2008 Guidelines document:


“A significant limitation of testing with gFOBT is that it is commonly performed in the doctor’s office as a single-panel
test following a digital rectal exam. ……While this approach may seem pragmatic, Collins et al2 demonstrated a
sensitivity of only 4.9% for advanced neoplasia and only 9% for cancer. The accuracy of this method is so low that it
cannot, under any circumstances or rationale of convenience, be considered as a method of CRC screening,.”

and adenomatous polyps, 2008: a joint guideline from the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force
on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology. CA Cancer J Clin. 2008;58:130–160.

Medicine 2005:142:81-85.

It's also interesting how "Alpha Exposure" cites a 2500 Australian patient study for FOBT/FIT performance as the
basis for his "mathematical model" yet conveniently ignores the FACT that 160 of those patients were symptomatic
and already bleeding, which seriously inflated the sensitivity of both the FIT and FOBT test in the study.


"Alpha Exposure" also conveniently leaves out the FACT that the this "Australian" study that was published in the
November 2006 issues of Cancer..... that is the bedrock and foundation of his entire argument only screened patients
for colonoscopy that were either FIT or FOBT positive.


On Page 2156, the paper (Smith et al in Cancer) actually estimates the true sensitivity of the tests, with FIT at 75%
sensitive for cancer and 127% for pre-cancer; which is not far from the Morikawa study that Exact Sciences frequently
cites - - - a study that I might add was prospective and of high-quality.

"Alpha Exposure" must not have actually read Page #2156 of the paper because he started off using a Sensitivity of
88% in his initial article.


31 Jul 2013, 11:37 AM


Energy-Trader
Another erroneous "claim" made by Alpha Exposure that serves as the "bedrock" for his mathematical calculations is
his assumed compliance rates for FIT of 95.1% in year one, 79.9% in year two, and 66.2% in year three.


Unfortunately, these compliance rates are pure "fantasy" when it comes to the REAL WORLD.


A retrospective cohort analysis of 1,122,645 patients aged 50-75 years seen at any of the 136 Department of
Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States in 2000 and followed through 2005 showed that only 41.1%
of men and 43.6% of women received adequate screening.


Of the 384,527 men who received exclusively FOBT, 42.1% received a single FOBT, 26.0% received 2 tests, 17.8%
received 3 tests, and only 14.1% were documented to have received at least 4 tests during the study period.


Bottomline: Adherence to repeated FOBT is low, suggesting that cross-sectional measurements of quality may
overestimate the programmatic success of colon cancer screening.

Author’s reply »  Dear Energy Trader,


Thank you for your active engagement with this series. Based on your above comments, I believe that the
correct way to interpret the study you mention is that of people tested once, 61.7% returned for a second
testing (26% = 61.7% x 42.1%) and of people tested twice 68.5% returned for a third screening (17.8% =
68.5% x 26%). Please let me know if you agree with this and I can re-run numbers assuming 10,000 people
get both tests in year 1 of which 4,210 actually take each test in the first year.


All the best,

Author’s reply »  Energy Trader,


If I run the numbers above using your suggested Insure performance stats, over three years I get Cologuard
picking up 25 cancers vs Insure 24. Cologuard 133 pre-cancers vs Insure 155, and Cologuard 503 false
positives vs Insure 260. Total Cologuard cost is 72% higher than Insure. Which had better outcomes in this
simulation in your opinion?

That 9 year chart is fascinating - 100% compliance over 9 years. This really stirs the imagination. Just imagine a test
that performs at the noise level will find almost all pre-cancers with just 20 years of testing! There is no need to waste
R&D dollars on finding better tests since all that is needed is programmatic compliance with even a lousy test.


Why is anyone not just using a $4 FOBT instead of a $25 FIT? For the same cost one has to screen 6 times less
often with FIT. Therefore if FOBT has a sensitivity of 14% and FIT 23% 10 gFOBT screens will find 586 pre-cancers
vs. 549 for FIT in 5 years at a cost of only $40 vs. $125 for FIT. Therefore, FIT dramatically underperforms gFOBT. All
kinds of cool Excel multiplications here. Should one start shorting FIT stocks next?

31 Jul 2013, 02:54 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  You compare apples and oranges. The point of testing frequency is not to equalize cost but
to compare tests using their recommended frequency. My understanding is that both FIT and FOBT are
recommended as annual tests whereas cologuard is only recommended to be used once every three years.
Accordingly, the comparison between FIT and FOBT would be accurate either 1 test against 1 or 3 against 3.
In fact, the CMS study that was linked to in part 4 showed total 10-year costs with FOBT vs FIT on page 32.
There was only a 3% difference in total lifetime costs. The DNA tests, on the other hand were on average
28% more expensive and resulted in many fewer life years gained vs FIT, which supported the author's
contentions that these tests do not merit reimbursement anywhere near the rumored $400 price point.

Author’s reply »  So just to be clear, you also think the appropriate comparison is sensitivity and specificity in
a single year when one of the comparators is supposed to be given annually and one is supposed to be give

31 Jul 2013, 04:54 PM


exas_cologuard
Which "DNA test" are you talking about. Likely not cologuard, because EXAS only recently submitted the
Deep-C data.  
Also, there is a reason why (at this point in time) cologuard frequency is every three years. The amount of
DNA shed is directly proportional to the size of the polyp. (not my opinion but based on studies) Adenomas
are slow growing tumors and it likely makes sense to repeat the test in 3 years when the polyp is bigger and
is shedding more DNA. This relationship between size of polyp and detection rate makes programmatic
sensitivity numbers for cologuard plausible. 
I do not think that it is true for FIT, especially with regards to polyps, because bleeding would be a random
event. 
Another point, Deep-C study had unusually large number of polyps detected. I would bet that most of them
were small, which in turn pushed the overall sensitivity down. As other posters have already pointed out, most
likely, the adenoma detection rate for FIT in Deep-C is in the single digits. But, we would have to wait for the
study publication to settle that.

The Deep-C clinical trial by Exact Sciences is the largest "high-quality" clinical trial ever conducted for a non-invasive
colon cancer screening test. The study enrolled more than 12,700 patients, of which more than 10,000 were ages 50 -
84 and underwent ALL phases of the clinical trial, INCLUDING being screened via Colonoscopy.

Interestingly enough, not one of your articles even touched upon one of the PRIMARY requirements set forth by the
FDA for the Deep-C study to achieve, that being the required 65% lower bound of confidence interval threshold for
cancer detection based on the 92% sensitivity achieved. The Deep-C study surpassed this 65% lower bound CI by as
much as 20% - - - a significant margin.


How could you miss such a basic Primary Endpoint that was required by the FDA in your articles???


31 Jul 2013, 12:14 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I never question whether or not they reached the 65% threshold. I question whether the test
is more effective than FIT, whether it is cost effective vs FIT, whether docs will prescribe it, and whether
patients will use it.


31 Jul 2013, 12:19 PM


exas_cologuard
Few points I would like to make. 
I will again point out that the cumulative efficacy numbers in your first article are made up. No study exists that
validates your numbers. If FIT were that effective, it would have made a huge dent in colon cancer prevalence by
now.


CMS statement on stool DNA tests might be based on older tests not on cologuard. The amount of DNA shed is
directly proportional to the size of the polyp. The same was shown in the DEEP-C trial. (based on increased sensitivity
numbers for polyps >2cm)


You have conveniently decided to omit the "compliance engine" aspect of EXAS approach.


What is the basis for alleging that EXAS management is deliberately withholding FIT data when management has
already stated that cologuard numbers were much better than FIT in the DEEP-C trial.


Finally, IMO 
"FDA approval": 99.99% certain, EXAS has met all primary and secondary endpoints in the Deep-C trial.  
"payer reimbursement": numbers used by EXAS are very conservative. 
"doctor prescriptions": very likely to prescribe cologuard because they are not happy with the alternative i.e. FIT. Also,
numbers used at this time are very conservative. 
"patient compliance": we wont know until EXAS is given an opportunity to prove itself but "compliance engine"
approach sounds promising.


31 Jul 2013, 12:19 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I disagree that the cumulative efficacy numbers are "made up." They may be simplistic but
the point is that the company is making a false comparison between the point in time efficacy of Cologuard
and that of FIT when the correct comparison would be over a three year period.

The CMS paper provided a very helpful sensitivity which showed the warranted prices for DNA stool tests that
are even better than Cologuard. These prices are around $200 - not even close to what the company wants
to charge.


As regards the "compliance engine," I don't really see why a call center should justify using a test. If it is really
important, then I would advocate charging an extra $10 for FITs and using the compliance engine with the
FIT.


I believe that EXAS management deliberately misleads investors and have given numerous examples (i.e.
comparing Cologuard prices to Mammograms instead of FIT, choosing the worst FIT data for their slide deck,
making up a new 2cm endpoint, etc) and that this type of behavior is systematic and not one-off. Put another
way, they are not shy about sharing good data, so I suspicious when they withhold data. We will see.


I think many of your conclusions will prove to be incorrect.  
* FDA approval is uncertain IMO due to the use of the wrong comparator test (OF FIT-CHEK instead of
Insure) and a comparison based on using the incorrect frequency for the comparator.  
* Payer reimbursement seems very unlikely to me because I think the test's price is not economically
justifiable. This is covered in detail in the CMS study 
* Doc use seems unlikely because of the low specificity and concerns over patient compliance 
* Patient compliance is likely to be poor because the test requires so many steps and includes the need for
patients to UPS their excrement rather than mail an envelope.


We will see within a year or so.

Given that the average cost of Colonoscopy in the greater New York area is around $3500.00 I believe that Cologuard
and its 92% sensitivity will do quite well with a $300-$400 price point.


No bowel prep required the night before. 
No having to be placed on dietary restrictions or going off of medication. 
No having to take an entire day off from work. No doctor's office visit, which can be difficult for those that live in rural
areas. No having to undergo a sedative or in some cases, anesthesia. No risk of bowl perforation by surgeon, or
missing serrated lesions in the descending portion of the colon which are much more difficult to see via optical
colonoscopy.


http://bit.ly/14iJNeS


As Elisabeth Rosenthal reported in the June 9th Sunday NY Times article on the "Cost of Colonoscopy", the lowest
price in New York was $740. The highest price in New York was $8500.


PS. Medicare (CMS) spends $14 BILLION annually treating colon cancer patients. More than 50,000 Americans a
year die from colon cancer. Sure doesn't seem like FIT is all that effective.

Your statements are laughable.


"Cologuard did in fact demonstrate 66% sensitivity for 2cm pre-cancerous polyps. That said, we are still unable to find
any study that tracks this data point, and have yet to find it as an endpoint for any study, FIT or otherwise, which
signifies to us that this is a meaningless clinical endpoint."


-- or maybe it's because no other non-invasive test (especially FIT) is successful at finding pre-cancers - the stage
where CRC is easily curable.

If you want to continue "looking in the rear-view mirror" at not ready for prime-time tests like PreGen+ and ColoSure,
you are incredibly uninformed. Those two tests have absolutely NOTHING to do with the current management team,
or Cologuard for that matter.

I'm not ignorant of that "FACT" (!!). To me it smacks of "hope and dreams," but maybe you know more than I do. I also
know that just by sticking a new management team in front of a situation doesn't necessarily change the product's
effectiveness. It MIGHT, but it might not.


If you go back to 2005 and look at research reports they look remarkably like the ones today. Analysts pumping the
TAM, assuming market share penetration, etc. etc. A new management team may change the results this time...or it
might not.


My point is, even if it does, the stock is still priced for perfection...if ANY (!!) of author's points turn out to be correct,
the stock is in for a world of hurt. If he's wrong on everything...the stock probably is worth about what it is today.

The FDA Clinical Trial has been completed with Cologuard. 
Moreover, the threshold of beating the 65% lower bound of confidence interval on the 92% sensitivity that the FDA
REQUESTED was beat by 20 percentage points!


I repeat: Cologuard has nothing to do with the previous lab developed tests under the previous management team.
You talk about "hope and dreams" and yet you are unable to cite specific FACTS. My guess, is that you really don't
have much of a scientific background to be able to address the actual performance of Cologuard.

good grief, that's not true. If Cologuard gets just 1/3 of the FOBT market and doesn't increase compliance, it's
worth north of $40 per share. It is much more likely to completely make FOBT obsolete, get 95% of market

hi alpha. Well, at this point i must commend you for your short call - if you stayed short from $14, you must be up
north of 30%. And i am equally impressed with the amount of work and research you put into your articles. Seriously. i
am impressed.


i have the opposing viewpoint regarding EXAS Sciences, the management and indeed Cologuard. But you did raise
some interesting and well researched points that i really want to question you about.


The first is one of the points that Adam Feuerstein raised, and relates to the data you culled from the study in Cancer
from 2006. Given your vast research on this subject and your erudite writing, it seems evident that you are quite
intelligent. how then is it possible that you would take a sensitivity and specificity from this study in the manner that
you did? Specifically, the sensitivity and specificity of InSure Fit were not design outcomes this study was addressing;
in fact, the author states as much by saying that a true estimate of the sensitivity for cancer and precancer for InSure
Fit are 75% and 27% respectively. And gives a specificity of 88.5%. You must know this. Why would you use numbers
for FIT that you must know are from a patient population that were heme positive and/or high risk for colon cancer and
which study was specifically designed to compare FIT to FOBT? I understand that you believe that the "correct"
numbers still show advantage for FIT as compared to Cologuard (which I may dispute later), but I ask why a smart
guy like you chose to use numbers you must have known to be spurious.


For me, this move alone throws everything else into question; as I expect suits your agenda as a short on this stock....

Author’s reply »  I originally used the numbers on Insure FIT's website rather than going to the source. When

EXAS has been a good short. I have covered most (80%) as I expect that the test will ultimately receive
approval and the stock probably goes up on approval. I intend to rebuild my short position at that time.

One of the big issues with any stool test, as you well know and pointed out, is compliance. As far as I know, there is
no compliance engine in place for FIT. You used numbers suggesting increasing sensitivity and specificity with
annually repeating FIT tests in you analysis. To be fair, this is what EXAS did in their presentation. Got that. However,
it is a big leap to suggest that the same folks take the test annually. It is much more likely that a small percentage of
people repeat the test annually and the rest are either first time users or repeaters from some time more than a year
in the past. In any case, cumulative statistics only works if the same people repeat the test.


EXAS can make the claim of cumulative sensitivity and specificity given the large amount of resources they intend to
put into a compliance engine. This and the fact that the test is only done every three years will likely have a huge
positive impact on compliance rates which gives the company room to make these claims.


You state that you got your numbers for FIT from the company website originally instead of the source article. Sounds
dubious, but fine. In that source article, the writers suggest that the specificity for InSure FIT was about 88.5%. They
even suggest surprise at such a low number. Nowhere in your analyses do you even hint at this low number. If you
use this number for specificity, your cost analysis disintegrates. The cost of FIT done annually then FAR exceeds that
of Cologuard done every three years. Moreover, if you did use this number and add that pivotal fourth year, the
Cologuard numbers shoot way up and FIT becomes second best.


I do not recall you talking at all about the impact of the tests on an individual basis. Let me clarify; it is generally
understood, that in diagnostic testing, once sensitivity and specificity are maximized, the improvement in one usually
causes a corresponding drop in the other. One must yield sensitivity to improve specificity and vice versa. All things
considered, patients are likely to want improved sensitivity at the cost of specificity. This is because a test with higher
sensitivity is more likely to be right when it says you don't have cancer. I want the test that I can put the most trust in
when it says I don't have cancer. Missing a cancer is what we don't want. Cologuard's sensitivity is far higher than that
of FIT. You have said so yourself. If the specificity of the test is less for Cologuard, still in dispute, it simply means that
there are more false positives which leads to colonoscopy which will again provide comfort when the patient learns
they have no cancer. Sensitivity is much more important from the patient perspective.


In your comments above, you suggest that repeat DNA testing of stools will not necessarily improve the detection rate
for colon cancer with the argument that the DNA in the mutated cells may not be tested for. True. But nowhere do you
address the likelihood of this outcome for Cologuard. The Cologuard test in fact, screens for the most likely DNA
changes in colon cancer and will catch all but the most rare mutations. I do not have numbers for this, but I assure
you they are vanishingly rare.


Finally, you nonchalantly throw the current management team and test under the bus with history. In fact, this
management team came in when the last iteration did not perform to expectations. This is a completely revised and
remodeled test. Mr. Conroy brought his expertise in molecular testing that he learned at Third Wave to this endeavor.
This test has very little to do with the previous iterations which again I would think you would know.


As for the personal integrity of Mr. Conroy and team, we will just have to agree to disagree. I have followed Mr.
Conroy since his days at Third Wave and have found him to be a principled leader - at least from where I sit. He has
been forthcoming and honest in all of the dealings with the public.


I welcome your comments.

Author’s reply »  I don't see any questions here - just statements.


I continue to believe that the cumulative sensitivity of Cologuard is worse than FIT. I actually think that low
compliance further benefits FIT because if you miss Cologuard you have no second shot since the test is only
once every 3 years. The compliance engine sounds like BS to me - France, for instance, has tried to
implement something like this with FIT and the results have been poor.


I continue to believe that this management team distorts facts and misleads investors. For instance, when
discussing cost effectiveness, the management said that the test will be cost effective vs mammograms and
pap smears. The correct comparisons are colonoscopies and FIT. Why doesn't management use these?
Because we already know from CMS that Cologuard is not cost effective in comparison to alternative tests for
colon cancer.


As regards specificity, my recollection is that the order of testing to reach the 88.5% you mention was first
colonoscopy and then FIT. This is likely to cause intra-colon bleeding that would hurt the specificity of a FIT.


Many posters have said that I should only use the Morikawa study - fine - in that case I still think FIT is
superior to Cologuard over a full cycle.


I think that addresses your concerns. I've written enough about this so I will not be replying to additional
questions on EXAS unless/until I write another article.

you're wrong about the cumulative sensitivity and you're pretty alone on that.

And another thing.....


you suggest that no big labs signing up with EXAS is indication that these labs don't believe in the test. you then go
on to at least partially answer why this is but don't make the connection for the reader. let me help you there. Quest
diagnostics is one of the big labs you mention that wants nothing to do with EXAS or its test. This is indeed true and
you know why that is -- and it has nothing to do with the accuracy or potential success of Cologuard. Enterix is the
company that makes InSure FIT and Quest Diagnostics aquired Enterix Inc. in September 2006. So one of the two big
labs who is not endorsing Cologuard which you point out as indication that they don't think it will succeed, actually
owns the competition. A rather important point wouldn't you agree?

Seeking Bull . . . Alpha Exposure conveniently omits significant FACTS all throughout the fundamental story
of EXAS. He's been very consistent in this regard.

His "analysis" is heavily biased, and in many cases makes no sense at all. He didn't even understand the
significance of ColoGuard detecting high-grade dysplasia at a sensitivity that management says, ".... was
several points above the 66% sensitivity for 2cm pre-cancers."


Anyone with the slightest kind of medical background knows full how significant that is when it comes to
screening for colon cancer. But instead, Alpha Exposure got bogged-down highlighting the "disappointing"
pre-cancer number.


Bottomline: He made money on his EXAS shorts for all the wrong reasons. Thank God John Boehner forced
a Govt. shutdown which caused many fund managers in the biotech arena to go "risk-off". He owes Boehner
a bottle of Champagne!

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Insure FIT is a very small part of DGX and was recently disposed of. I;m sure that if they
thought cologuard would be a big hit then they would have attempted to partner with EXAS. I continue to think
the lack of a partner is a big negative.


16 Oct 2013, 08:40 PM


Energy-Trader
Your logic is as "twisted" as ever.


You have no idea whether or not DGX or LH tried to partner with EXAS. How would you know if they
"attempted" to partner? 
Do they send out a press release???

Thanks for the comments energy trader. i am just trying to give AE some ground for answering . As he points out, the
NASDAQ is up 6% and EXAS down 21% since he wrote his multi-part series. I am not sure that his articles had no
effect on share price. It is disappointing to me that they did, but I have learned that one must discount the price of a
stock based on the sometimes woeful market intellect. This is such a case. Comprehension of the numbers is difficult
to start with which opens the door for more manipulation than usual.


it has been a painful ride for me in this particular stock because of the ease with which the facts can be misconstrued
along with market ignorance - and because of our ridiculous gov't. in any case, I am content for now to just hold my
position and watch my retirement grow now as the share price of EXAS inexorably rises in the coming months.

Seeking Bull, as of today EXAS is -14% since Alpha Exposure's first article came out. No big deal. The low is in and
the Fund that puked their position last week is already regretting it given that the stock is currently trading $11.30

One last thing alpha, you have repeatedly stated how you think management is deliberately misleading us; indeed,
calling into question the character of Kevin Conroy. One question: have you ever met Kevin Conroy? Have you made
any effort to visit with management and get their direct input? Just wondering...


24 Oct 2013, 09:34 AM


Energy-Trader
Of course he's never met Kevin Conroy. 
He's probably never even been to a break-out session after one of Mr. Conroy's presentations where an off
the record "Q&A" occurs during these biotech conferences. His understanding of the colon cancer diagnostics
marketplace is extremely poor.

There must be a market for companies to hire Opposers, ie, those who argue every little opinion/fact of every little
statement some one makes -- something on the order of PUMP and DUMP, but in reverse order. Are these People

23 Jan 2014, 12:04 PM


Energy-Trader
There doesn't have to be a marketplace for "opposers" as you claim when you are dealing with a PROVEN
management team such as the one at EXAS. Try doing some basic due-diligence and look into the previous
company that Kevin Conroy and Maneesh Aurora lead ("Third Wave Technologies") which developed an FDA
approved screening test for HPV cancer, which is where the majority of cervical cancer comes from. You
might also like to know that the MAYO CLINIC is Exact's research partner. That makes for a very powerful
combination!


25% of the float of this stock is Short. 
The people here that are short this stock have had their heads RIPPED OFF. 
They have "friends" that spend their entire day on Seeking Alpha and Yahoo Message Boards spinning "crap"
and trying to create uncertainty that will lead to a price decline in the stock. Sorry folks.... it's NOT WORKING!


EXAS is +34% since October and the shorts are squealing like little pigs.

but, it is becoming more and more difficult. Fortunately I do not need to make a lot of money anymore -- the 80s and

Author’s reply »  I think you need to compare all recommendations against their respective indexes. I would
argue that if someone recommended a biotech as a long on the date of my first article and that long
subsequently went up 30% until today, it would be an underperformer. Likewise, a short recommendation that
went up 30% would be an outperformer. I think the short setup today/yesterday is great. We'll see soon
enough.

Yes, I am sure Alpha timed it all just right. So are you saying that all of the negative garbage was simply market
manipulation? This is why Seeking Alpha is becoming completely worthless, shameless propagandists like you. It's
bad enough that you spend endless hours putting an piece like this together, all to try to cover your butt, and then you
can't even admit that you got pounded in the end. What a way to make a buck.


20 Mar 2014, 05:03 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Pounded? You must be joking! As of today, I am down 4% since the day prior to my first
article being published. You need to re-check the definition of pounded. There are some shorts I
recommended where I have been pounded, such as LEE which is up 51% since the day before I published
my article on it, but EXAS is not a recommendation where I have been "pounded." I continue to think this is a
great short and per my comments above, I shorted it on March 20th.

Alpha, I'm not sure if you saw the latest anonymous EXAS short smear piece, but if you have, would you care to
comment? Conroy blew them out of the water point by point in the earnings call, and all their seemingly well research
points were proven to be carefully crafted misrepresentation of facts and reality.


Being as the ADCOM was so heavily in favor of EXAS and the comments that Conroy received after the meeting from
panelists (see today's conference call @ the end), have you changed your mind yet? What do you think of Whitney
Tilson's tacit endorsement of this short smear piece yesterday, after promoting Travis Cocke's similar short thesis on
EXAS last year? Have you ever communicated with Whitney Tilson in regards to EXAS?

The Gravity Research piece was full of lies, either from the omission of factual evidence or just flat out
incompetence when it comes to analyzing scientific data. The fact that Gravity Research couldn't figure out
something as simple as the AUC and ROC curves (comparing FIT to ColoGuard) is quite telling in my
opinion.
