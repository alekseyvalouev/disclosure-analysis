Universal Travel Group: the auditor resigns edition
On September 29th Universal Travel Group held a conference call to discuss their business model.
They took no questions on the phone but instead answered a bunch of pre-prepared questions which
included some but by no means all of the questions I asked on this blog.


In the call they specifically indicated that they had no problems with their auditor – but noted that their
auditor had only been appointed recently and had not yet affirmed their accounts.


A week later, all that had changed. To quote from their press release:


On September 29, 2010, we received a letter dated September 28, 2010 from our
current independent registered public accounting firm, Goldman Kurland Mohidin, LLP
(“GKM”), informing us that they had resigned as our independent registered public
accounting firm effective with the commencement of business on September 27, 2010.
No reason was given as to the cause for their resignation. GKM was only recently
appointed as our independent registered public accounting firm on September 1, 2010,
and had not yet commenced providing any accounting services to us. Accordingly, GKM
had not provided any opinions, qualification or modification to our financial statements
for each of the past two fiscal years nor do we have any disagreements with GKM on
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
GKM, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of such
disagreements in its report on our financial statements for such periods.


And later in the same release:


Our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved the appointment of Windes &
McClaughry Accountancy Corporation ("Windes") as our new independent registered
public accounting firm effective as of September 30, 2010 and Windes has agreed to
act as our new independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the Company
clearing Windes’ client acceptance procedures.


Deriving a timeline is difficult here. If the company received the letter on the 29th was that before or
after the conference call? If it were before the conference call (or if the company had any indication
that the auditor was about to resign) then the statements made on the conference call were actively
misleading. The call was held at 9am in New York on the 29th of September which is 9pm in Shenzen
(where the company has its head office). It would be deeply problematic if the letter were received in
business hours on the 29th at head office.


Also problematic is that they took a full week of trading days to report this to the SEC. I am not a US
securities lawyer – so I do not know what the time-frame under which a company is required to report
the resignation of an auditor – however – given what was said in the conference call the auditor
resignation was market-sensitive – I think the default reporting requirement is rapid. (If someone is
familiar with the legal requirements can they please detail in the comments.)


But this is not the first problem that Universal Travel has had with its auditors. The accounting industry
publication Going Concern surprised me by going through all their filings for audit changes. I quote:


Auditors 


First we went back to the 10-K filed on March 31, 2008 and discovered that on June 23, 2006, the
company dismissed Moore & Associates, Chartered:


On June 23, 2006, we dismissed the firm of Moore & Associates, Chartered (“Former
Auditor”), which had served as our independent auditor until that date. The Former
Auditor was our auditor prior to the acquisition of control of our Company by Xiao Jun.


On June 23, 2006, we retained Morgenstern, Svoboda & Baer, CPA’s, P.C. to serve as
our principal independent accountant.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Universal Travel Group: the auditor resigns edition


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/10/universal-travel-group-auditor-resigns.html 2/5


Posted by John Hempton at 3:24 PM  


This seemed to be a pretty good call on UTA’s part since it turned out that Moore & Associates was
issuing bogus audit reports. No cause for concern at this point.


The relationship with Morgenstern, Svoboda & Baer appeared to be going on swimmingly but
ultimately, for reasons unbeknownst to all, it didn’t work out. MS&B resigned on June 30, 2009 to
make way for Acqavella, Chiarelli, Shuster, Berkower & Co., LLP:


On June 30, 2009, our prior independent registered public accounting firm,
Morgenstern, Svoboda & Baer CPA (“Morgenstern”) resigned and on the same day, we
appointed Acqavella, Chiarelli, Shuster, Berkower & Co., LLP (“ACSB”) as our new
independent registered public accounting firm.


Similar to their predecessors, ACSB & Co. was humming along just fine, getting ratified in the recent
preliminary proxy statement filing until they were up and fired on September 1st…


End quote. Going Concern continues through a total of five auditors and a smaller handful of CFOs
and note that this run compares unfavorably to Overstock. I had no hand in this article and I
encourage you to read the whole thing as a beautiful example of accounting due diligence.


But there are questions beyond audit. The conference call downplayed the importance of the
websites indicating that about 80 percent of the business came through a traditional (and telephone
based) travel agency. It also dismissed my staff-salary concerns by indicating that most the staff were
taken on late in 2009 to staff their new 300 person phone center.


This left me puzzled. Somehow this company suddenly had enough extra business to staff a 300
person phone center – but the company had effectively zero marketing expense in 2009. How did
potential customers suddenly know the phone number? How is it that anyone can open a phone
center that large and without advertising get enough people to ring? There must be some really
special marketing tricks here… I just wish the company would explain what they were…


Alas – they do not answer questions I send to them by email so I encourage speculation (especially
informed speculation) in the comments. I thank my readers for that.

PS. This blog is having an effect. The 2007-dated “Easter eggs” on the www.cba-hotel.com site are
being removed. For instance they have removed the link allowing you to purchase tickets to the 2007
Sinopec Formula 1 Grand Prix. They also removed (my as yet unreported) link to their “latest” air-
flights mileage plan (a plan that was abolished when Lufthansa purchased Swiss Air in 2007).

Amazingly, UTA stock is up since then

The next time Jim Cramer or one of the other Happy Bulls on CNBC is denouncing evil
shorts, your work should be cited as a case study as to why they are dead wrong.  
 
Where is the SEC? How could this train wreck possibly be listed on the NYSE?  
 
Are they asleep or simply indifferent? 
 
It's so much like 1999, except the fake dot.coms are based in China this time rather than
the US.

Mike, 
I was a little sheepish to admit it, but I take it a little step further. I use hand crafted
puppets to act out the dialogue between blog commentors, with accents and everything.
My kids have really been enjoying the UTG episodes, it sure beats reality TV these days

Hi John, 
 
Great blog. What has happened to the Bronte Capital website (it states "It works" - which
is encouraging!), but nothing else. I have a question regarding if you have a minimum
amount for prospective investors? Where can I find that out? 
 
Cheers.

UTA stock is up because while John Hempton is busy detailing why you should sell, he is
secretly covering his large short position. 
 
When the SEC checks into his trading activity and the timing of his blog postings, it will all
be revealed. 
 
So there's your answer as to why UTA stock has been going up.

John - I've learned quite a bit from your blog. Few people take the trouble to do first-hand
investigation and analysis. 
 
As a techie, I was pleasantly surprised at the way you covered virtualization and
operating systems by actually getting your hands dirty, and the high quality of your
conclusions. Unlike industry analysts, who wouldn't be caught dead actually trying out a
product. 
 
Do you have an RSS feed? I couldn't find one, and I much prefer that to email
subscription.

This is totally off topic, but I would love to read your thoughts on the mortgage

favorably (and also unfavorably at times) about BAC.

Hi John, your research on UTA is quite intriguing, and it seems like you have multiple
lines of evidence to support your overall thesis at this point. I thought the accrued interest
argument was particularly interesting. Now, I recently saw an article that applied your
mode of analysis across a large number of small caps, by Ben Strubel. See:
http://seekingalpha.com/article/231699-warning-signs-for-chinese-small-caps?
source=dashboard_global-markets 
 
It looks like UTA is a company that obtains the third-lowest interest rate of all the Chinese
small caps analyzed at 0.18% -- well below the sector average of 1.53%, by more than a
factor of 8. Certainly it's worth considering whether management is being completely
straightforward there. However, there are also other companies with extraordinarily low
implied interest rates, such as 0.06% at Biostar Pharmaceuticals and 0.13% at Deer
Consumer Products. Let us know if you have any thoughts on them... thanks!
