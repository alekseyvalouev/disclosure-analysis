Hydrogenics: Margin Drop, Cash-Poor, Insider Sell-Out And Enough
Malfunctions To Make You Swoon

Summary


Burning cash. The company's shelf prospectus allows up to $100 million worth of
banknotes, common stock, etc. We expect an equity raise.


A big customer-shareholder sells off Hydrogenics stock.


Gross margins drop heavily.


Amid 30-50 percent growth expectations, a decline noted in backlog - sometimes
considered a measure of future revenues, though subject to customer cancellation.


Hydrogenics execs back off from 30 percent growth projection - a figure that may or
may not materialize, given backlog numbers.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Hydrogenics Corp. (NASDAQ:HYGS) suffers an unfortunate link to Janet Jackson - sort
of a "wardrobe malfunction."


The fuel cell company is now dealing with a "parts malfunction" in which it revealed that
two multi-million dollar shipments were delayed because Hydrogenics' supplier had built
defective equipment. This mistake by the fuel cell technology company electrified listeners
almost as much as the singer's caper.


Oddly, much as that other malfunction ignited fleeting promotion for a fading star,
Hydrogenics' malfunction may have sparked an unexpected boost for the company, too.
We'll explain that below.


We'll also look more closely at various big issues threatening the company's business:


The reputation-damaging parts malfunction.
A big shareholder sells off stock.
Gross margin drops heavily.
Backlog drops - indicating shrinkage of future potential sales - even as some analysts
expect 50 percent year-over-year growth.

Hydrogenics execs back off from 30 percent growth projection - a figure also unlikely
to materialize, given backlog numbers.
Burning cash. The company's shelf prospectus allows up to $100 million worth of
banknotes, common stock, etc. We expect an equity raise.


Hydrogenics did not respond to our requests for an interview for this article.


With a tip of the hat to some old Janet Jackson tunes, we'll review Hydrogenics' positives,
as well as the negatives that we believe make this stock scarier than any future
outrageous attempts by Ms. Jackson to remain relevant.


"Whoops Now," Here's The Bull Case


Canada-based Hydrogenics provides hydrogen fuel cells for stationary and mobile uses,
and hydrogen-generating products for industrial applications as well as for energy storage.


The bull argument includes a belief that Hydrogenics can sell more products as California,
Canada, the European Union and Germany develop policies to encourage alternative
energy uses.


Additionally, backlogged inventory still appears significant, and bulls add that this suggests
the pipeline will lead to a positive adjusted EBITDA for 2015.


The maturing and expanding order pipeline should drive more news flow, which analysts
believe would be a strong positive catalyst pointing to growth and stability - assuming
hydrogen fuel cells become a more common power source.


"Can't B Good," Or Why Did Hydrogenics Have To Blow This Delivery?


The stock has zig-zagged over the past year like a pop musician drunk on fuel cell bubbly.
It swooned again in December when the company updated investors with the news that
delayed shipments would squash 2014 targets.


Then came the day for Hydrogenics to sing out those sour notes in the earnings call. In
light of the delays, EBITDA remained negative and the targeted $50 million revenue
turned out to be just $45.5 million.


"Let me assure our investors that it was very unusual for these particular parts in question
to be defective," CEO Daryl Wilson said early in the call on March 4.


Those parts were critical. One shipment was destined as a second energy storage system
for E.ON SE, an important German energy and gas customer.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3012086-hydrogenics-margin-drop-cash-poor-insider-sell-out-and-enough-malfunctions-to-make-you-swoon 3/15


Mr. Wilson said the supplier had simply provided inferior parts for this "OnSite Generation"
project and another project that he didn't name.


E.ON's Falkenhagen project currently uses Hydrogenics' 2 megawatt electrolyzer. The
system allows the combination of water with excess energy from wind turbines to create
hydrogen that is stored and moved into the natural gas pipeline.


A big portion of a $5 million sale and Hydrogenics' reputation hinged on delivering a
second electrolyzer to E.ON. This was to be installed in the Hamburg project that the
E.ON folks enthusiastically referred to as "the first prototype operating in the 1MW range."


But Hydrogenics executives indicated the company will recover from this blunder and get
paid this first quarter.


We hope so. But we can't overemphasize the significance of messing up these OnSite
Generation orders.


Consider this customer concentration issue: E.ON and the other unnamed important
customer are among just four big customers that delivered 39 percent of Hydrogenics'
sales last year.


"You Want This," or Darn Right We Want Good Gross Margins. Ahhh, Those Twisty
Low Margins.


The parts problems went hand-in-hand with another blow-up mentioned gently by analysts
in the earnings call. Gross margins fell both sequentially and compared to the same
quarter in the prior year. In fact, the margins are by far the lowest since the first quarter of
2013, as shown below.


Yet, this disappointment apparently handed Hydrogenics the oddest twist.


OnSite Generation sales are lower-margin, at under 15 percent (10 percent below the
other division, Power Systems).


An analyst who requested anonymity pointed out that if the shipments had actually
occurred, more low-margin product revenues would have diluted the higher-margin
revenues.

"If those sales had been in there," the analyst said, "Hydrogenics might not have been
profitable because of those crummy gross margins."


And though the company reported its first quarterly profit of $612,000 on revenue of $15.7
million, that doesn't dampen our concerns about the low margins that the CFO referred to
as "a new normal."


Even Backlog "Doesn't Really Matter;" Next Rev Hit Unlikely


Backlog, which is sometimes crafted in the fuel cell business as a measure of future
revenues (though it is subject to customer cancellation), decreased by 7 percent to $62.2
million:


But let's say Hydrogenics converted most backlog to revenue, as executives said most
inventory will be delivered in 12 months. And let's add the roughly $5 million revenue from
the delayed shipments hoped to be realized in the first quarter.


Though 23 is the highest percentage converted from backlog in any quarter so far this
year, let's go ahead and assume Hydrogenics converts a crazy-optimistic 95 percent of
that backlog by year end.


2015 Revenue Estimate/Bloomberg $ 68.5 million


95% Backlog Converted $ 59 million


Q4 Rev. To Be Recognized in Q1 2015 + $ 5 million


Estimate Miss - $ 9 million


Our calculations suggest that unless Hydrogenics can charge substantially more for each
system sold, it's impossible to hit those analyst estimates.

"There's no way Hydrogenics can hit 2015 revenue," an analyst told TheStreetSweeper.


In fact, in the earnings call, executives seemed to have their own doubts about lofty
revenue guesses.


They refused to be pinned down on speculating (as they did in Q3 and earlier) that
Hydrogenics could even hit 30 percent additional revenue - which would be $59 million -
and our example above shows even that much would require 95 percent of backlog to be
converted to revenue.


Major Shareholder Sings Along With Janet, "You Want This?" And Just Keeps
Selling Shares. More To Come.


Customer and major shareholder CommScope (NASDAQ:COMM) sold HYGS shares last
week. And the week before... and twice the week before... and so on.


Just since last May, it has sold nearly 1 million shares, or nearly half its entire stake.


CommScope bought about 2.2 million shares in 2011, and records show it now holds only
1.3 million shares after kicking off its selling spree last May.


Mr. Wilson explained during the earnings call that CommScope's CFO has just decided to
monetize the investment:


Daryl Wilson, CEO: "We believe there will be demand in the stock to buy out that
relatively slow dribble out that's coming from CommScope. And again, they are
limited by regulations on trading those shares in each three month period, no greater
than the weekly average trading volume. So it's a pretty severe limitation on their
ability to sell."


CommScope has a unique perspective on Hydrogenics business, because it is not just an
investor, but also a customer.


If you're wondering if you should be worried, you're not alone. After confirming that
CommScope owns about 14 percent of the company, Tendercapital analyst Marco Sirugo
raised that very question.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3012086-hydrogenics-margin-drop-cash-poor-insider-sell-out-and-enough-malfunctions-to-make-you-swoon 6/15


Marco Sirugo: "Okay. So should I not be worried by this data?"


Bob Motz, CFO: "No, I don't think at all. It's not germane to our business directly,
because as Daryl has indicated, it really doesn't affect in my view the value
proposition for the company."


We're still worried. And curious. If CommScope actually believed in Hydrogenics
technology, why sell now?


Judging by the current trend, investors will likely have a few white-knuckle weeks to watch
the remaining 1.4 million shares hit the market.


The last time 1.5 million shares of Hydrogenics hit the market, shareholders probably
weren't in the mood for humming along with Ms. Jackson's song, "The Best Things in Life
Are Free."


In fact, Hydrogenics announced a public offering on May 13, 2014 of 1 million shares in
the treasury - plus 500,000 shares owned by CommScope.


In reaction, the stock took a freefall to a new normal that persists today. The price fluttered
30 percent virtually overnight from ~$20 to ~$14.


Here's that Hydrogenics stock chart:


"Hold Back The Tears." That Cash Burn's Hurting


We, too, could barely hold back the tears when we spotted Hydrogenics' available cash in
2014 and noted it dropped below 2013. Yet, its cash burn grew.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3012086-hydrogenics-margin-drop-cash-poor-insider-sell-out-and-enough-malfunctions-to-make-you-swoon 7/15


Cash burn leaped 62 percent to about $3.9 million per quarter. At the same time, the
available cash slumped to $6.6 million.


With little more than one quarter's worth of cash available - even less if the company
hopes to sell improved products - it makes sense that it would put its stock on the auction
block this year.


So we're expecting a cash raise in the second quarter - or the third quarter, at the latest.


After all, the company's shelf prospectus allows up to $100 million worth of banknotes,
common stock, etc. So why not an equity raise soon?


"Son Of A Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)" Indeed, This Material
Weakness Alert is About Your Stock


If all that's not enough to make you want to change your playlist and portfolio,
Hydrogenics' material weakness warning tucked away in Exhibit 99.1 may do the trick. It
trills out bad news uncovered by PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants, dated March 3,
2015:


Inherent limitations


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Opinion


In our opinion, Hydrogenics Corporation and its subsidiaries did not maintain, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at December 31,
2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by COSO, because of a material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting related to the incorrect recording of non-monetary assets denominated in foreign
currency in the German subsidiary.


Hydrogenics' execs added:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3012086-hydrogenics-margin-drop-cash-poor-insider-sell-out-and-enough-malfunctions-to-make-you-swoon 8/15


Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31,
2014.


We identified a material weakness in our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
in our 2014 financial statements related to the translation of non-monetary assets in
our German subsidiary. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. The material weakness resulted in errors in the measurement of non-
monetary assets in the German subsidiary that were corrected in the Company's
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 prior to
their release. We are committed to remediating the material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting by enhancing existing controls and introducing new
controls over the use of appropriate exchange rates in the recording and translation
of foreign currency transactions and balances in our foreign subsidiaries. We are
committed to implementing its remediation plan as soon as practicable.


A Bill Gates quote may apply to Hydrogenics:


"In this business, by the time you realize you're in trouble, it's too late to save
yourself."


Executive compensation gets fired up and just goes "On And On."


Mr. Wilson's annual salary and stock value exceeded $1.5 million. And compensation for
all seven top officers in the most recently disclosed year of 2012 reached $4.1 million - in
just one year.


All on the backs of shareholders, many of whom have watched their shares fall apart over
the past year.


How badly? Here's the 1-year chart showing Hydrogenics stock (down 55%) compared
with the Nasdaq (up 13%).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3012086-hydrogenics-margin-drop-cash-poor-insider-sell-out-and-enough-malfunctions-to-make-you-swoon 9/15


And, though the company has plugged along for years, handing many shareholders
diminished share value, the trend for executive compensation is rising... and just goes on
and on.


Conclusion: "Sad"


Janet Jackson might agree that a face-full of spider-leg eyelashes, a truckload of spooky-
high heels or even a closetful of red bustiers set to malfunction at just the right moment
could never erase the sad issues surrounding Hydrogenics.


We believe the company will ultimately get pummeled even worse than other former high-
flying alternative energy stocks, such as Plug Power (PLUG, $7.99 on 3/16/14, now
$2.75), along with others that TheStreetSweeper has warned investors of, including
Ballard Power Systems (BLDP, $2.60 on 2/19/15 publish date, now $2.09) and FuelCell
Energy (FCEL $2.84 on 8/19/14 publish date, now $1.28).


The combined chart for those stocks over the past year shows the downward trend:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3012086-hydrogenics-margin-drop-cash-poor-insider-sell-out-and-enough-malfunctions-to-make-you-swoon 10/15


Much as many people would prefer otherwise, these alternative energy-related stocks are
likely decades ahead of the infrastructure, compelling uses and wide market acceptance
needed to become really profitable.


It looks like investing in Hydrogenics is just about as pointless as Janet Jackson and
Justin Timberlake replaying that wardrobe malfunction at the old folks' home.


And consider this: After 20 years of trying, Hydrogenics is still making big mistakes within
the slow-moving fuel cell field, and has only just eked out $612,000 profit. Yet, the market
has placed the company's value at $134 million.


So, if the company continued to make $612,000 every quarter, it would take a while for
profits to add up to Hydrogenics' current value - well, quite a while! About 55 years.

Analyst X, Contributor
Though I disagree with your conclusions, I like to hear the short argument for a stock. Thanks for posting it.


My own view is that the company will have no need to sell shares, as it will be cash flow positive for 2015. I think it
has a technological lead in multiple key areas, and this will allow it to generate consistently increasing positive cash
flows as time goes by.

Well, its an unusual way to write as business article. (I understand you get paid by the word; if so, where's your
credibility? And "wardrobe" ? What glue are you on! And tho' I have no idea who these references are about, I can
guess at the parallels: I think)


And I like : "the EU and Germany". ('Bout right!!)


All the same, its a good analysis IMO - and like another Canadian company (WPRT) - HYGS seems to have lost sight
of its Finances. This should be corrected.  
If the product for E.ON is fundamentally OK & HYGS' Quality Control dept is to blame, again, this can be corrected. 
And Commscope, you may be right; this is the second time they've done a big sell. Last time they brushed it off, said
they needed the cash. 
You are also right to say they might need to issue another tranche of shares; not unusual for a fledgling company
which is succeeding in the long term. Rarely a smooth ride.  
So short term, thanks for the bad news. Long term: will this technical operation catch on? (Ans : Yes) Are these probs
terminal or trivial? (Ans : Trivial in the big picture).  
And its right to match (even projected) future revenue to total valuation. Mmm. 
The real question is, regardless of share price, is it a good company or not. You say "very patchy".  
I think, given normal human endeavour, the patches will get mended in time.

I share none of these concerns. I own no shares yet. First of all the entire economy and stock market will collapse to
under DJI 6000. A 12000 point rip will take HYGS to at least 7 or 8. D Wilson can't help that. This management does
no PR to promote hydrogen to the public and to Congress or the climate change advocates. Hydrogen is the only
remedy for climate change. The risk of total destruction of the climate has no corrective action. We are all on a path
for suicidal disaster from starvation.


Today was the climax for stocks. DJI 18076 AND s&p 2099. Janet Yellin is delusional. There are more than
47,000,000 getting food stamps. In 2006 there were 23,000,000 getting food stamps. Money velocity has collapsed
and margin accounts hit a high last January. Giant daily swings are only at major tops. The spike in the dollar will
crash the world economy.

Toyota plans 1500 hydrogen vehicles for CA with only 19 fueling stations. If they gave them away free they are
worthless without fuel. This is absurd.


I listen to Senators Boxer, Sheldon, and Sanders never mention hydrogen. Naomi Klein wrote her book about climate
change with no word of hydrogen.


19 Mar 2015, 02:12 AM


malc9141
by definition, these guys are amateurs ( Boxer, Sheldon, and Sanders never mention hydrogen. Naomi Klein).
There IS a move. UK : Wales, Isle of Wight, London 
CA: you don't need many filling stations for "take off". That research ha s been done. 
Korea tho' not sure of details.


Attraction is they only need a small footprint 'cos the electricity supply and gas tank are behind the shop,
small c'os continuous supply. No huge fuel tank being topped up once a month by a huge truck.

Is the Tea Party selling hygs too, or are they short? They don't believe there is climate change. Has no elected official
ever heard of hydrogen fuel cells that produce no pollution when they use hygs products? Did Daryl Wilson learn his
company can solve climate change if hygs replaces all other power systems in the entire world? hygs is paying a
zombie a huge salary who thinks his job is to travel to any stock analyst who will listen to him.


Anybody who owns hygs is clueless. Don't own hygs until Daryl Wilson is fired

Did Janet Yellin solve any economic problem? She claims 0% interest rates are working. My bank charged me
interest on my loan but they also charge $7 per month if I ever dip under $1000. (That's 8.4%).

An analyst I talked to who wanted to remain anonymous said quite the opposite of this author's anonymous source.
My analyst contact actually thinks the stock is going to $100 by the end of next year. "This stock is going to $100 by
the end of next year," he said. So there you have it. Case closed.

This gal is on glue. Bad news. 
Having re-read the Conference Call and looked again at the Financial Reports, I don't agree at all with her weird
perspective. Regarding Commscope, I don't know why they sell HYGS shares but I can guess: they can get Cash to
pay their staff (from the sales) or they can manufacture stock options. I prefer a company that does the former. 
HYGS will have its ups and downs but will it fold? No. Then will it prosper? Yes, in the long term.

I think as rightly said the stock sale by Comscope is a drag and would continue to be so till they sell the balance
shares which would take at least another 12 months or more . I think we can expect to accumulate this stock in end of
this year at prices below 10 considering that Comscope would continue selling at a run rate of around few thousand
shares capped by the restrictions of selling around 350K shares maximum per quarter approximate as per my
calculations. Considering that they still hold 1.3 million shares this is expected to take around 12 months. This is likely
to be an interesting trade as company seems to be near break even and at late stages of comscope sale it might
provide a good opportunity to accumulate. What do you think on this ?

It won't be Comscope it'll be the entire stock market that takes hygs down. Sell this now and buy back at 7 or 8 when
the DJI breaks 7000. In a panic $2 is realistic. 
MONEY VELOCITY PLUNGE  
STOCK PRICES AT RECORD HIGHS


The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced
goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy
goods and services per unit of time.


It is impossible to have the cataclysmic collapse of money velocity without a corresponding collapse of GDP. Both
reports are derived by the government and one is false. No individual or institution has the vast source of economic
data that creates both reports. By looking at every commodity price chart only cattle remains at its lofty price. The
GDP is reported and discussed daily while money velocity is never mentioned by any of the economists featured on
C-span, CNBC, and Bloomberg.


Stock indices will absolutely disengage from the fake Federal Reserve contrived price of 0% to .0025% voted for by
Janet Yellin and her independent FOMC colleagues. How many more years will it take for the delusional, incompetent
Fed Chair Lady to know Americans who lose jobs and join the ranks on food stamps has skyrocketed from
17,194,000 in 2000 to 47,636,000 in 2013 with its first decline in 2014 to 46,536,000? The coincidence of plunging
money velocity with skyrocketing food stamp recipients in many stingy states has been ignored by stock traders
risking their capital in a sea of hypocrisy always believing stocks will always go higher.


Last week it was the word “patient” mentioned constantly by people deemed smart and sophisticated and trusted with
investing trillions of dollars. Nothing much is going to happen when Greece finally collapses because the Greek
economy is only based on their statues visited by tourists. Shipping used to be significant.


Which will collapse first, the American stock bubble or the Greek tourist trade? Very poor 1st quarter earning reports
are absolutely not priced into the market closing near record highs on Friday March 20. As the “March Madness”
cheerleaders leave the arenas they could ship their pom poms to the CNBC broadcasters who won’t mention the
plunging money velocity and growing food stamp recipients.

HYGS has been paying its work force with stock options. Over the last 3 years, the shares outstanding have
increased >50%. 
Assuming no more of this (which will understate my point), the ~10M shares value the company at ~$130M


If we want to see these shares at (a mere) $20, (when it would be worth $200M),  
to get there, at a P/E of 15, lets say, it should clear (20/15) = $1.33 gross, per share, over some chosen but
reasonable time period. (i.e. therefore get $1.33 x 10M total). If it kept 10% earnings as profit, that means getting
exactly $100M in sales, again over the time period, typically a year.

This skips how we get there, and assumes no more dilution, but could it grow to $0.1B sales p.a. in a realistic future
period? Criticism welcome.

Hi Malc9141,


I think HYGS has an excellent chance get to 100 Million in Revenues in 2018, and I think if it does it will be on
a rapid growth pace at the time, with revenues and profits accelerating. In other words, the PE will be much
higher than 15 in this scenario. The market is waiting to see IF these companies can be profitable, and IF
they can, they will be categorized as growth stocks.


I'd say HYGS at 100 Million in revenues, with revenues growing 30+% a year, and if its net profit is (using
your number) 10 Million at that time and also growing 30%+ a year, then I think we are looking at a valuation
of at least 500 Million or so if the stock market is in decent shape. A lot depends on the health of the overall
market, and the stock price itself (as you point out) would depend on how many shares are outstanding, but if
this scenario unfolds for the business of HYGS I absolutely think for the share price will be multiples of what it
is today.

only IN AMERICA ,you can bash any company without any solid reason . There is no SEC for investors. They are
JUNK Useless. You are too late for this article. You should have done when it was 24 dollar to help investors. This
article is only for some to trash the stock for own purpose. COMM is killing the company and i was bashing and telling
investors to get out from HYGS when it was 24 dollar. Now i like to buy around 11 to 12 dollar rather shorting. COMM
is very negative as of today but HYGS is good buy around 11 or 12. 15 page on HYGS and spending so much time
means you are scare in your short position or you are slave of hedge fund . I am planning to buy 2000 shares around
11.

Put succinctly, this girl is a crook. Ignore her rant, paid for by the word.

dsinbull; What is your rationale for buying at 11. Dont you think if Commscope continues to sell the share may even
go below 10. They have been selling from 24 and sold a bulk with the secondary at 15. Since then they have been
selling every week and since their buy price is around 4 I think they would continue to be a seller till they hit the cost
price. Welcome your views
