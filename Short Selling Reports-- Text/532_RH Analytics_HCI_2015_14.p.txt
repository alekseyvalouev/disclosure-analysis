HCI Group: Jack Of All Trades

Summary


HCI implements the 'jack of all trades' investment program, and ramps up risk in the
process, by investing in several alternative strategies.


HCI's 10-Q shows investments in several new investments that appear to be hedge
funds, including distressed debt and long-short funds.


Risky assets as we define them have grown from approximately 20% of the portfolio
at the end of 2013 to 40% in Q1'15.


With the core business set to decline, management appears committed to either
generating returns by other means or spending shareholder cash trying.


A review of the HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) Q1'15 10-Q points to a persistent trend with the
company: increasing risk. Management's willingness to take on increasingly risky ventures
in the hope of generating returns is evident in its turn to wind-only policies and the
company's investment program. Out of mainstream, one could say fringe, investments
began with real estate development and have since grown to include direct lending and
hedge fund investing. It appears as if management is going to find a way to stem the
pending decline of returns on capital or spend all the cash trying.


On the Q1'15 conference call, HCI's management addressed the company's investment
program in something of a cursory way. They stated that investments in fixed income and
equity securities increased $75.5 in the quarter to $218M. While true, we don't consider it
material, particularly because HCI should have an active investment portfolio in fixed
income. What we more interesting to us is what the company did not discuss on the call:
the risk ramp in the investment portfolio.


The table below shows details of HCI's investment accounts, with the exception of fixed
income.

Our table includes equities and what we consider alternative investments, which combined
can be thought of as risk assets. As indicated, HCI's exposure levels to more risky assets
than typically associated with insurance company investment programs increased from
$33.9M to $105.9M, or 3x over the period in question.


Importantly, risky assets have increased relative to the overall investment portfolio. At the
end of 2013, what we define as risky assets were 23.2% of the portfolio. As of Q1'15, that
figure has almost doubled to 40.1% of the investment portfolio. It appears as if after a
massive, liquidity driven 5-year bull market in risky assets, management has determined it
is time to get in on the game.


The interesting aspect is that the company's real estate investments are now one of a few
alternative investments. In our review of the 10-k, we discussed the company's investment
in what appears to be a private business development company, BDC. This quarter, there
are two other alternative investments, which are shown below.

The BDC investment revealed in Q4'14 has been joined by what appears to be
investments in a distressed debt hedge fund, and a long/short hedge fund. Current
investments of $21.8M will increase to $35.2M when the investments are fully funded.


HCI has increased exposure to equities dramatically, upped its investment in real estate
and has embarked on what appears a concerted effort to put cash to work in hedge funds.
It is unclear to us as to what drives the investment decision. It is likewise unclear to us
how much leverage is embedded in the structures. Clearly, more leverage would equate to
more risk.


We think this can be looked at two ways: the company is ramping up risk and throwing
things against the wall, so to speak, in effort to find returns. Alternatively, one could argue
that they are moving down their stated path of Buffett-like diversification.


We completely understand HCI's predicament. With takeouts disappearing the core
business can no longer deliver the growth to which investors have become accustomed.
Indeed, real decline is on the horizon. Fixed income returns are thoroughly uninspiring.
Management likely feels that they must do something to generate returns to find their
reaison d'etre. Without the promise or at least hope of returns, investors would probably
clamor for the return of capital and wind-down of the business.


The problem is that HCI's search for returns appears to be leading them in many
directions: they will consider purchasing any business; they are real estate developers,
middle market loan investors and hedge fund investors. It appears as if management will
either find returns somewhere or squander shareholders cash looking.

Nice article, with valuable insight. However, your bias is showing.

Management is following a Buffet like strategy. It could work, we have no idea if they have Buffet like skill. However,
instead of investing in a Buffet like group of mostly predictable, conservative, branded, companies during periods of
temporary weakness (e.g. Heinz, Coke, Wells Fargo) they are predominately pursuing pass through alternative assets
(e.g. REITs, BDC's, asset backed securities, etc.). These securities tend to have relatively stable high income streams
but volatile prices (note I run a portfolio of predominately pass-through securities called the 50+ fund so I am
generally positively biased on these securities: http://bit.ly/1hd0fxz). Using float to buy pass-through securities is not a
bad strategy as the spread can be significant. I would do it myself were it available. However we are a little late in the
market cycle (particularly with REITs), the price risk is higher, the investors skill unproven and therefore the multiple
on book unwarranted. Were HCI trading at book, I might go along for the ride. They could be great investors, we just
don't know that yet. If they are average or below average investors, the market turns south or their is a hurricane out
of season, this equity will suffer. As such the short position is a good one.

Really close to jumping in on the short side, hopefully it comes up a little more. Anything over $48.50 and then have to
take that ride down Sliding Ln. :)

This would be an interesting possible long... at $20. Still a short for now though.

Repost from July 16:


I've been in and out of this stock since 2011, when I first bought warrants that went up 1000% in 3 months and then
rode the stock up another 100%. 
It got fairly valued at one point and I moved on. Happy to come back and find it severely undervalued again and still,
obviously from the short comments, very misunderstood. This is about the easiest company I've ever analyzed and I
know middle schoolers that would realize this is a no-brainer.


The third quarter is normalized earnings for these "4th quarter takeout" companies and with no storms, my back of the
napkin math shows HCI can make $1.60ish/share in the third quarter (they'll easily beat the current Q2 estimate, FYI.
And did one of these shorts put in the estimates for Q3 or something? Total joke.). I haven't studied the new
reinsurance contract, but I'm comfortable this management did the right things and so the costs are similar to last
year.


Multiply that by 4 and you get annual earnings of $6.4/share. A conservative investor pays 10x earnings. A huge
storm would wipe out one year of earnings (the shorts don't seem to understand reinsurance), so maybe a real
stickler would pay 8-9x for this. But with the way this management always seems to find growth and the fairly
consistent, temporary earnings from any takeouts 10x is reasonable.
