Focus Media: How To Cover A Smoking Gun With A Red Flag

Focus Media Holding Limited (NASDAQ:FMCN) has just released more details on their
theater network. In their latest 20-F filing, theater revenue is more precisely defined and is
now distinguished from the traditional billboard revenue, as far back as 2007. There is
also a theater and screen count for 2011.


Rather than resolve the issues, however, the new information raises more red flags.
Specifically, the Focus Media screen count per theater exceeds the Chinese average by a
difficult-to-believe margin.


For those readers new to the scandal, perhaps a brief recap is in order. Before Muddy
Waters Research published their report in November 2011, Focus Media's filings claimed
a network of 27,164 theaters for 2008. The problem with this was that there were only
1,545 such theaters in all of China at the time. This was proven conclusively by
referencing Chinese government statistics and widely published articles. (If you have any
doubts at all, please see the slide show: A Critical Failure in the Focus Media Story).


After the January 2012 Amended 20-F, Focus Media changed their story and claimed they
had used an old methodology which has been recently updated. This was simply untrue,
and their responses, which were submitted to the SEC, provide the final evidence that

fraudulent statements had been made. (here.)


That brings us to the present. In their latest filing, Focus Media claims ...


For our movie theater network, we leased screen time in approximately 316 movie
theaters (consisting 2,190 screens) in cities across China as of December 31, 2011.


Using the final (lots of amended filings here) 20-F documents from 2009 to 2011, we can
construct the theater count and revenue. From 2010 to 2011, the theater count grows 22%
while revenue outpaces them, growing from $18 million to over $50 million ... a 180%
increase.


Note that the theater count is more or less flat relative to the growth in revenue. How do
we account for the disproportionate leap? ... through the exponential growth in the screen
count?


316 56


2190 637


2800 803


9200 3030


As you can see below, Focus Media has more movie screens per theater in its network
than average. A lot more.

For example, Focus Media's total theater and screen counts for 2011 are disproportionate
to the average, with Focus Media at 6.9 screens per theater; China, 3.3.


In 2011, Focus Media increased its theater count by 56; it's screen count by 637. This
comes out to a ratio of over 11.4 screens per theater.


Compare this to China's growth over the same period, showing a ratio of 3.8 screens per
theater.


Of course this is a red flag for Focus Media; not a smoking gun. Claiming 27,000 theaters
in a country that had less than 1,600 ... that is a smoking gun. This is just a red flag, but
it's bright red and big.

Professional translation: "In 2011, 803 new cinemas were built and 3030 movie screens
were added in new extensions, an average of 8.3 new movie screens per day. By the end
of the year, the number of urban cinemas across the entire country was more than 2800,
with the total number of movie screens reaching more than 9200."


Original Chinese: "2011年，新建影院803家，新增银幕3030块，平均每天增长8.3块银
幕。截至年终统计，全国城市影院数量突破2800家，银幕总数达到9200多块。"


These statistics were widely published in China: Google (copy and paste into the Google

It is amazing Matt. Whenever the facts come to light this stock just continues to shrug it off. That said, it seems to be
getting weaker and weaker with low volume up days and high volume down days.


Good luck to you.

Author’s reply »  Thanks. Good luck on your picks as well. We'll see how much light is shed on FMCN over
the coming months (... and whether or not any additional facts make any difference at all...?)

above average is a norm, i don't think that is where it stands, but 11.3 per theater sounded high. again anyone who
shorts China stocks, hope you guys really do some DD, not just sit there, read and type, that is not convincing... my
experience is, I have not seen a cinema in Beijing that has more than 8 screens in a theater. 
BUT! bear in mind, FMCN's value is not judged by its screen assets, it does prove they have something shady, but
does not 100% correlate to financial fraud, so I suggest not to shift people's eyeballs purely on these screen-counts,
does not make too much credibility on your write-up against the name.
