Summary


Mexican Senator Ricardo Barroso Agramon formally calls for Oceanica's mining
concession to be revoked to avoid ecological effects.


Legislature: "There is already a large onshore phosphate deposit in Baja California
Sur that produced 1.7 million tonnes in 2012 making this project unnecessary".


The site where OMEX claims to plan to begin phosphate mining is the Gulf of Ulloa,
an area highly productive fisheries.


Appears doubtful that EIA will ever be filed now, OMEX trying desperately to raise
money based on false hope with just a few weeks of cash in the bank.


We continue to receive communications from locals in Baja, Mexico about the status of
Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s Oceanica underwater phosphate mining
project and have posted our research online in our last article.


Things have just taken a dramatic turn for the worse today for Oceanica with formal
communications in the Senate calling for Oceanica's mining concession to be revoked.

Agramon Senator Ricardo Barroso warned the risk to the fisheries in the state of
Baja California Sur, on the pretense of private companies to initiate exploration and
exploitation of phosphates in the seabed of the Gulf of Ulloa.


In this situation, Agramont Barroso appeared before the Standing Committee on
Point Agreement which calls on the Ministry of Economy that are canceled, revoked,
canceled or permits for the operation of rock phosphate or other minerals that are
granted are to be collected seabed of Baja California, to avoid ecological effects. In
its argument, the legislature stated that according to the Mexican Center for
Environmental Law project is unworkable and unnecessary because the entity
already exists a very large exploitation of phosphates. "El only producer of
phosphate status in our country is Baja California Sur, the production of this mineral
in 2012 was 1 million seven hundred twenty-four thousand six hundred sixty-two
tonnes, representing a value of 1,240,000 pesos, "he revealed. senator highlighted
the need for PRI proposition because, he said, it is certain that the activities on
marine mining can produce serious adverse effector to the marine environment,
which will affect the fishing industry in the area. "In the time it widespread mineral
extraction at sea, the consequences would be severe for fisheries, as the chemicals
become toxic when the concentration thereof.

Agramon Senator Ricardo Barroso warned the risk to the fisheries in Baja California
Sur, on the pretense of private companies to initiate exploration and exploitation of
phosphates in the seabed of the Gulf of Ulloa.


At one point of agreement submitted to the Standing Committee requested the
Secretariat of Economy (NYSE:SE) that are canceled, revoked, canceled or permits
for the operation of rock phosphate or other minerals extracted from the area
intended to be granted.


The paper, published in the Parliamentary Gazette, the PRI legislator argued that
according to the Mexican Center for Environmental Law project is unworkable and
unnecessary because the entity already exists a very large exploitation of
phosphates.


Companies that want to conduct marine extraction and mining, mainly phosphates,
are Oceanic Explorations, S de RL de CV; Phosphorites Pacific SD, SA de CV;
Phosphoric Corporation and Mexicana, SA de CV, said.


The site where the affiliate Odyssey Marine Exploration plans to begin phosphate
mining is the Gulf of Ulloa, an area highly productive fisheries, explained.


Furthermore, the entity exists and phosphate mining greatly, so it is also
unnecessary, since Baja California Sur and has sufficient exploitation of this mineral.


"The only producer of phosphate status in our country is Baja California Sur.
Domestic production of phosphorite in 2012 was 662 million 724 thousand tons, 2
percent higher compared to 2011, "he added.


Phosphate exports in 2012 reached $ 234 per seven thousand only three tons; in the
period 2005 to 2007 showed an average annual growth rate of 54.5 percent, while
from 2008 to 2012 reported an annual decrease of -43.2 percent.


Mexican exports of that mineral are primarily sent to the Netherlands and the United
States.


PRI senator stressed the need to adopt this point of agreement, because it is certain
that mining activities can result in serious adverse effector marine environment,
which will affect the fisheries sector.

Senator Agramont Barroso stressed that it is certain that activities relating to
mining can cause serious adverse effects to the marine environment.


fishing in Baja California Sur


By Bertha Becerra C / El Sol de Mexico


Mexico City -. A day that was voted on in the Senate package of secondary
legislation in the energy field, including the Mining Law, the PRI Senator Agramont
Ricardo Barroso warned the risk to the fisheries in Baja California South, by the
claim of private companies to initiate exploration and exploitation of phosphates in
the seabed of the Gulf of Ulloa.


Sudbajacaliforniano legislator said that according to the Mexican Center for
Environmental Law project is unworkable and unnecessary because the entity
already exists a very large exploitation of phosphates.


"The only phosphate producing state in the country is Baja California Sur. Production
of this mineral in 2012 was 1.7 million tonnes, worth 1.24 billion pesos," he said.


In this situation, presented to the Standing Committee a point of agreement, which
calls on the Ministry of Economy that are canceled, revoked, canceled or permits for
the operation of rock phosphate or other minerals that are tried are granted
extracted from Baja California seabed to avoid ecological effects.


Senator Agramont Barroso stressed that it is certain that activities relating to mining
can cause serious adverse effects to the marine environment, which will affect the
fishing industry in the region.


"At the time that the extraction of minerals in the sea widespread, the consequences
would be severe for fisheries, as the chemicals become toxic when the
concentration thereof.

The Senate isn't lining up against Oceanica. This is one Senator. His main argument is that Oceanica will hurt the
fishing industry, but he has no way of knowing this will be the case. The Oceanica mining activity won't overlap fishing
concessions, so none of this even matters.


Just like you said the firm will be bankrupt on 7/16, or that the Central America will have no gold, or that the firm was
lying about its contract with the UK government, or so many other things....you're just dead wrong.

BTW, Mexican consumption of phosphate is over 2.5 million tons per year. Mexico is not close to meeting its own
demands for phosphate and must rely on Morocco to make up the difference.


Mexico also suffers from a severe trade imbalance. It needs to develop more natural resources to begin to correct the
situation.

Last, the production facility in LaPaz is decrepit and is regularly put out of commission by storms. Mexico has been
left dangerously short of phosphate in the past because of this plant's issues.

User 14172792
The senator claims that large concentrations of phosphate is toxic ---- so maybe Oceanica should bill the Mexican
government for removing (dredging) all of that nasty mineral and cleaning up their gulf waters.  
Alas -- Mexico would deny that phosphates are harmful and that the mining takes place far from (35 to 40 miles
offshore) any fisheries anyway. 
Who is the main contributor to the senator for election purposes --- Fisheries maybe?

<<Somebody covered 5 million shares 6/30-7/15>>


Almost certainly prearranged Russell Index Delisting "short against the box covering" buys made on June
27th that had 3 market days to clear and so didn't make the initial NASDAQ short report.


So the rise to 24 million was artificial and so is the drop.

As rsabet pointed out, the short position in OMEX has gone down dramatically,


Settlement Date Short Interest  
7/15/2014 19,205,661  
6/30/2014 24,106,989  
6/13/2014 22,989,876


Put on top of that Morris distributed almost 905 of the LEI holdings to its partners.


Meson is a very small Fund, this certainly looks like he could have been covering his OMEX while rabidly trying to talk
it down because he needs to cover before his Fund is gone. You can distribute long stock to partners, you can not
distribute shorts to partners.


So if Ryan is covering, what does that say about OMEX, the stock continues to go down? At some point, Ryan will be
done, then what? That buying will be gone.


And if Ryan is gone, who will you all try to blame OMEX's stock declines on? Who can you whine and cry about after
Meson is gone?

So what other possible alternative explanations are there when an individual senator authors a legislative proposal in
support of his constituency? Has this letter from one senator imply the entire senate is in agreement? 
I therefore parked my bike for a few days and I've dedicated time to explore what the most senior officials and
ministries in Mexico have been reportedly doing in regards to food security and the need for mexico to expand its
fertilizer production.


Let's start with motivation...isn't it always about the money? 
I believe the Mexican PRI government has attempted to "institutionalize graft" by recent changes to the mining law
which created a royalty payment stream of some 7plus% to be shared by the central government (aka PRI party) and
a to-be-identified "local population". The most unusual feature of what we just learned about "Don Diego" is that the
mining activity will take place outside of Mexican territorial water limits, but inside the EEZ (Economic Enterprise
Zone) over which no local or state government has jurisdiction. Thus there is a need for the federal government to
define who is a legitimate "local group" and this deal is going to see a lot of hands being stretched out to be
scratched. 
I believe that there are also deal(s) to be cut in order to fit into the loudly proclaimed national campaign against
hunger and its related project to increase fertilizer production. Beginning in the Spring of 2013, the Minister of
Agriculture & Fisheries SAGARPA (Sr. Martinez y Martinez) began a publicity campaign based on the need to reduce

fertilizer imports which equal 50% of current total used. Yet even more is needed since 40% of the arable land is not
even being fertilized, thus reducing production and fomenting the significant import bill of food stuff. Pemex and others
have made announcements since regarding their plans to expand production by 2015. Oceanica's timing couldn't
have been better, which I attribute to blind luck, while the junior senator from BCS appears out of step with his bosses
within the PRI, but let's explore the issue further.


Bottom line is that there is a national strategic plan for food security which will eventually trump the valid fears,
although yet to be determine how the facts laid out in the EIA really impact the fisheries. The local politicos, such as
the junior senator from Baja California Sur (who also serves as the head of a fishing cooperative support agency) has
petitioned the senate to outlaw seafloor mineral extraction, and so he is dutifully representing their constituency of
fishermen. Ironically the equivalent of the Mexican State Dept., less than a year ago, hosted an international
conference on opportunities for mining the Mexican seabed. So eventually President Nieto himself will weigh in since
there is a significant choice to be made...outlaw seabed mining even without knowing what, if any, damage it will
cause to the local fishing cooperatives of the Gulf of Ulloa. For perspective, a SEMARNAT study of the local area
coastal fishing industry (out to a limit of activity of some 20 kms) put an approximate value of the catch along the
coast of some US $25 million annually) while the national need to add 100% to their domestic fertilizer production, to
which the Oceanica project represents potential foreign exchange gains of some $500 million annually and tax
payments of some $ 50 - 75 million annually). 
Mexico does not typically move fast and cares less about the shareholder debate between longs and shorts, much
less the need for shorts to cover before there is any facts about recoveries from the SSCA operations. But as once
made famous by Bob Dylan...you don't need a weather vain to see which way the wind is blowing on this one!

Rory Duncan
Ryan,


Below is a chronological summary of you crying "Wolf" with respect to OMEX's imminent bankruptcy:


In your 10/31/13 piece you said that OMEX would run out of cash in "2-3 quarters."


On July 8th you wrote, "What possibility does OMEX have to survive Q3 without filing for bankruptcy (We initially
predicted an equity filing or bankruptcy raise Oct 31, 2013 within 12 months and continue to believe this is on track)?"
So, you misrepresented your earlier call, which had one year as the maximum length of life for OMEX, and you
estimated BK during Q3.


On July 10th, you predicted bankruptcy on July 16th.


On July 17th, you said that cash balances should "hit zero" during the first week of August.


On July 23rd you said, "OMEX Cash Perilously Low: Likely Bankruptcy punted to August 16th."


On July 30th you wrote, "We believe OMEX will file bankruptcy before EIA is filed - only weeks of cash remaining."


So, Ryan, that's at least six predictions of bankruptcy. You've been wrong every single time. You've also been shown
to have misrepresented all manner of facts about OMEX and to have omitted significant material information in your
"research."


My question is this: is that embarrassing to you? Or is the sting of that embarrassment eased by the fact that you
were exiting your short as you dissolved your fund and you were able to talk the stock lower with false promises of
bankruptcy? I'm sure all the shorts that helped you out of your position (at a personal gain to you) are going to be very
happy with your oh-so-ethical behavior as the stock rallies now.


12 Aug 2014, 08:53 AM


Rory Duncan
Ryan, I find it interesting that you continuously accuse OMEX management of overpromising and underdelivering, and
yet just about every prediction you have made with respect to this company has been dead wrong. You have
overpromised and underdelivered in just about every respect possible in your "research" on OMEX. Meanwhile,
OMEX has promised zero with respect to the central america and brought up around $40mn, so far. They've promised
zero with respect to the value of Oceanica, and this claim appears to be generating substantial interest and may be
worth hundreds or billions of dollars. The situation is very ironic.


You might want to take a look in the mirror at some point and ask yourself what exactly it is that you've accomplished.
You've lost almost every single battle with respect to this stock and embarrassed yourself completely with your
ridiculous predictions and proclamations. You've lost the Chairmanship of LEI. You've seen LEI threatened with
delisting and had the stock trade to $0.50. You've lost your fund, Meson, which is being dissolved. You've opened
yourself to lawsuits and investigations. Do you think it might be time to try a new strategy? This one isn't working very
well for you.
