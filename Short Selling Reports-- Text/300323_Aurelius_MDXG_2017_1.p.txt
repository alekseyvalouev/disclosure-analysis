Like Achilles, the hero who forgot his heel, or like Icarus
who, �ying close to the sun, forgot that his wings were
made of wax, we should be wary when triumphant ideas
seem unassailable, for then there is all the more reason
to predict their downfall.

You should assume that as of the publication date of his reports and
research, Aurelius and possibly any companies a�liated with him
and their members, partners, employees, consultants, clients and/or
investors (the “Aurelius A�liates”) have a short position in the stockshort
(and/or options, swaps, and other derivatives related to the stock)
and bonds of MiMedx. They therefore stand to realize signi�cant
gains in the event that the prices of either equity or debt securities of
Mimedx decline.  Aurelius and the Aurelius A�liates intend to
continue transactions in the securities of Mimedx for an inde�nite
period after his �rst report on a subject company at any time
hereafter regardless of initial position and the views stated in
Aurelius’ research.  Aurelius will not update any report or information
on this website to re�ect such positions or changes in such
positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius
A�liates” are not in any way associated with Aurelius Capital
Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and
any a�liates of or funds managed by the latter company.

We see large undiscounted channel stu�ng and kickback risks
lurking beneath the surface at MiMedx (NASDAQ: MDXG). This
report speci�cally exposes:


Undisclosed related party transactions and entanglements
with distributors, including a key MiMedx distributor that has
been controlled by an insider. These relationships are
especially problematic because secret ties to distributors
have featured prominently in historical channel stu�ng
schemes.


Detailed allegations that MiMedx’s channel stu�ng scheme
relies on at least three more distributors who have
undisclosed special agreements involving millions in
discounted product and favorable �nancing terms as “house
accounts”. Not only does the alleged scheme now extend
signi�cantly beyond the VA, but MiMedx has allegedly
manipulated its �nancials through multiple avenues to hit
sales targets.

Documents showing that over 40 podiatrists across the
country, including the current President of the American
Podiatric Medical Association, received undisclosed
membership interests in a MiMedx reseller linked to MiMedx
a�liates. The HHS O�ce of Inspector General has declared
physician owned distributors as “inherently suspect” in a
special fraud alert.


The research mosaic at MiMedx stirs memories of ArthroCare, a
medical device company with a similar revenue recognition policy
that in�ated sales by “parking” millions in product at distributors
before period ends. ArthroCare’s fraud relied on a distributor secretly
controlled by insiders, which metastasized alongside a scandal
involving improper relationships with doctors.


ArthroCare’s channel stu�ng was �rst dismissed by some investors
as impacting only a small portion of its business and the CEO initially
blamed short sellersshort  before he was eventually sent to prison.


MDXG shares trade at a premium of over 5x sales, even though the
business generates minimal pro�tability.  The risks facing MiMedx
investors, in our opinion, are beyond elevated.


Background


MiMedx’s origins date to the 2009 arrival of former Matria Chairman
Parker “Pete” Petit shortly after a reverse merger.  After ashort
transformative acquisition in 2011, MiMedx’s sales of its placenta-
derived healing products have grown exponentially.


Mr. Petit has frequently touted MiMedx’s remarkable consistency in
meeting or beating revenue guidance (25 of the last 26 quarters).
Even with shares trading near all-time highs, Petit has complained of
supposed “naked short selling”. Yesterday, the company scheduled ashort
conference call for tomorrow morning to address topics including
“short selling matters and proactive remedies”.short


We fear MiMedx’s growth story is simply be too good to be true.

7/10/2019 MiMedx: Flying Too Close To The Sun - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/mimedx-flying-close-sun/ 4/15


Last December, two former MiMedx sales employees �led a
whistleblower complaint (here) alleging that MiMedx engaged in
channel stu�ng at VA Hospitals using a distributor named AvKARE. 
Because MiMedx recognizes revenues as soon as product is shipped
to stocking distributors, as opposed to when the product is
implanted, the whistleblowers allege that MiMedx used AvKare’s
consignment agreements to hit sales targets by �lling shelves with
excess product that the “VA did not request or initiate”.


The scheme was allegedly concealed through a secret agreement
whereby AvKARE would “provide sales documentation falsely
documenting the bogus VA sales” as well as “a dummy purchase
order to MiMedx for the bogus sale to the VA”. Publicly available VA
Documents suggest that MiMedx and AvKARE even shared a fax
number.


According to the whistleblower allegations, some of the excess
inventory was intercepted by sales reps and hidden in their home or
car. One former MiMedx sales rep we spoke to in a different region
than the whistleblowers corroborated this allegation:


“Products being kept at employees’ homes? Yes. Yeah. Absolutely.
Yeah. Lots of cases. Yeah. I’ve heard stories, I’ve heard lots of crazy
stuff, things buried or just thrown away. Really just stuff that turns
your stomach”


Two weeks ago, The Capitol Forum, an investigative news company,
issued a report stating it con�rmed that “The VA O�ce of Inspector
General (OIG) is conducting an investigation that involves
documents related to MiMedx”.


In response, MiMedx issued a press release (one of 21 this quarter)
dismissing the Capitol Forum report as “innuendo” and reiterating its
contention that the whistleblowers fabricated the allegations to
negotiate releases from their non-compete agreements.


MiMedx also disclosed that it is aware of an ongoing VA OIG
investigation but declared that the company is not the target of that
investigation. But MiMedx stated that one former employee has now
pled “the �fth amendment rather than answer questions related to

dinners provided to doctors” and that terminated employees have
“provided gifts and meals to employees of the VA that potentially
result in violations of federal law and MiMedx policies”.


Even though MiMedx says that “there has not been any testimony
that the Company’s executives directed anyone to behave in such a
manner”, we �nd this revelation particularly problematic because
MiMedx recruited a material portion of its sales team from Advanced
BioHealing (ABH).


ABH was the subject of a movie-worthy alleged VA kickback scheme
involving falsi�ed expense reports, gold Kruggerands, and cash in
envelopes that led to the largest settlement in medical device history
and a $650 million loss for Shire (ABH’s owner).


Based on our analysis of Linkedin, a signi�cant portion of MiMedx’s
Regional Sales Directors came from ABH.  Two current MiMedx
Sales Directors were speci�cally named in a Qui Tam complaint
alleging that they engaged in misconduct at ABH that included, for
example, bribing VA doctors to �ush product down toilets and falsify
charts.

Undisclosed Related Party Transactions & Alleged Channel Stu�ng
Outside the VA


Bulls seem to have taken comfort in that, although MiMedx charged
off $11.1M in product returns over the past twelve months (a sharp
increase), the company did not have to buy back signi�cant amounts
of inventory after its AvKARE agreement expired earlier this year.


But our research has also identi�ed deep undisclosed
entanglements between MiMedx and multiple other distributors.


Two of these distributors, CPM Medical and SLR Medical, are
speci�cally identi�ed in Florida court documents �led by one of
MiMedx’s whistleblowers as having special undisclosed agreements
along with an unidenti�ed third having a “house account”.  The
allegations (here) that MiMedx’s channel stu�ng scheme extends
signi�cantly beyond the VA appear to have gone largely unnoticed by
investors.


MiMedx’s accounting policy for its stocking distributors is similar to
ArthroCare, whereby revenue is recognized as soon as product is
shipped (page 9 of 10Q).  Historical channel stu�ng schemes have
abused this accounting policy to manipulate their �nancials through
secret agreements to generate “sales” merely by shipping excess
product to a�liated distributors (see ArthroCare, McAfee, Bristol-
Myers).


This is precisely why the anecdote published by the Capitol Forum
last month, of an alleged MiMedx scheme to load product onto a
truck and be “driven around the corner like it was going to a
wholesaler”, is so troubling.


Relationships we have concerns about include:


CPM Medical


The court documents �led by the whistleblower allege that CPM
Medical received “signi�cant product discounts as well as exclusive
territory rights within Texas, in exchange for CPM Medical placing
large orders for MiMedx products at the end of quarters”.

Speci�c order amounts are included with totals implying that CPM
was over a 5% customer for MiMedx during 2015. For example, the
whistleblower states that CPM made roughly $2.5 million of
purchases immediately before the end of Q1 2015, an order that
would have been directly responsible for MiMedx’s ability to meet its
guidance of $40.8 million during that quarter.

If you have already read the SEC’s ArthroCare complaint, this
allegation will sound awfully familiar. ArthroCare awarded a key
distributor expanded territory rights in exchange for purchases that
enabled the company to hit its sales targets.


Source: SEC Complaint


That distributor, DiscoCare, hired a former top ArthroCare salesman
to help run the company along with a number of other former
ArthroCare employees.


According to the whistleblower’s court �ling, the owner of CPM
Medical, Mark Brooks, “was personal friends with the MiMedx Vice
President of Sales, Mike Carlton”.  An investigator from another
investor paid a visit to CPM’s headquarters and asked for Mr. Brooks
but was instead referred to a man named Bill Cochrane. Bill
Cochrane is a former MiMedx National Sales Director.

Asked about his role, Mr. Cochrane said he is “a consultant to
distributors” before producing a card for a business named “AZ
Biomedical”.


MiMedx told another investor that CPM has not generated any
revenue for MiMedx since 2015, but Mr. Cochrane estimated that the
business has over 100 employees and holds inventory that includes
MiMedx product as well as spine & orthopedic hardware.


A web of at least 53 different LLCs are registered to CPM’s
Richardson, Texas address as well as two tissue banks, CPM
Medical dba AmBioMed and Palm Springs Partners dba Maxim
Surgical. Both of these have �led FDA registrations that disclose
storing and distributing unspeci�ed amounts of MiMedx product.


We also discovered that CPM has an undisclosed OEM agreement to
sell MiMedx products under the “AmbioChoice” trademark.  The
most recent tissue bank disclosures for MiMedx, CPM, and Palm
Springs Partners each report storing AmbioChoice inventory.


SLR Medical


After CPM allegedly defaulted on its credit line, the whistleblower’s
court �lings state that MiMedx began to “shift more of its channel
stu�ng efforts to AvKare and to SLR Medical Consulting”. Then,
“SLR Medical Consulting would make end of the quarter orders of
MiMedx products at MiMedx’s request on highly favorable �nancing

terms” and was treated by MiMedx as a “house account” along with
the third unnamed distributor.


Source: Palm Beach County Case No: 50-2016-CA-013806-XXXX-MB


Documents show that SLR is currently owned by a now-former
MiMedx Sales Director, Jerry Morrison.  Importantly, documents
show that SLR was distributing product even while Mr. Morrison
was still at MiMedx.  None of this, of course, has been disclosed to
investors.


The FDA inspected SLR Medical in January 2015, a time when Mr.
Morrison’s Linkedin says he was a MiMedx Sales Director.  We
obtained the inspection records which name Mr. Morrison as
“responsible for all operations” and state that SLR was storing and
distributing Amniotic product at that time. Mr. Morrison’s Linkedin
pro�le says he has been the President/CEO of SLR since 2010.

photo of Mr. Morrison


SLR Medical’s COO is currently Jayce Holley, the former CFO of
Stability Biologics.  MiMedx acquired Stability Biologics in 2016 and,
according to his Linkedin pro�le, Mr. Holley moved to SLR Medical
after the MiMedx acquisition.  The whistleblower’s court �ling also
alleges that excess SLR product was stored at the home of an
unidenti�ed former MiMedx employee that went to work for SLR.

SLR Medical is currently registered as a tissue bank housing
amniotic product. Its website features MiMedx product and Linkedin
suggests that SLR has been actively growing its sales force.


Other Relationships of Interest


Evidence also points to related party dealings involving a distributor
named Spinelogix.  MiMedx’s current Texas Regional Sales Director
is listed in corporate records as being a partner with SpineLogix in a
different LLC named StreamLogix, indicating that a �nancial
relationship exists.

We also found a large network of other sales entities that report
storing and distributing MiMedx product, often from residential
homes or obscure locations, especially in Texas.


Our search through FDA records identi�ed a total of 73 tissue banks
that have disclosed storing and/or distributing MiMedx product at

one point in time, 33 of which remain listed as registered or active in
the FDA’s Tissue Bank Database.  We note that this likely understates
the actual total because it omits entities who simply have not
registered as tissue banks.


Examples include a MiMedx distributor named Arthomed, who says
on its website that it has MiMedx territory rights in Florida, with
representatives also in Puerto Rico and Central America.  Arthomed
has registered with the FDA as a tissue bank that stocks and
distributes MiMedx product out of the below residential home,
located in the outskirts of Boca Raton.

In many cases, it’s unclear to us if the tissue banks storing MiMedx
product are distributors, resellers, or sales agents.  Based on
MiMedx’s disclosures, it’s impossible to know how much distributors
presently contribute to sales and the company has declined to break
out the revenue contribution from independent sales agents.


On the most recent earnings call, MiMedx did go out of its way to
downplay its reliance on distributors, stating that “sales from
distributors are no longer material nor have they been for some
time”.


But just weeks later, MiMedx announced that it would divest Stability
Biologics, the distributor it had acquired last year. Ironically, MiMedx
had acquired Stability in 2016 after allegations surfaced that Osiris, a
MiMedx competitor, was using Stability to engage in channel
stu�ng.


The divestiture includes a new distribution agreement that will give
MiMedx ongoing access to Stability’s large network of sales agents
that Mr. Petit has previously lauded.  As a result, MiMedx should now
be able to begin recognizing revenues as soon as it ships product to

Stability, where it previously would have had to wait until the product
was used or implanted by physicians.


MiMedx Product Is Sold Through Physician Owned Distributors


Although MiMedx’s 10-K states that “we do not directly sell to or
distribute any of our products through PODs”, we discovered that
MiMedx product is still sold through PODs.  A Special Fraud Alert
issued by the HHS O�ce of Inspector General declared that PODs
are “inherently suspect under the anti-kickback statute” (“AKS”).


Most notably, documents show that over 40 podiatrists across the
country received membership interests in a MiMedx reseller named
Fuse Medical that is linked to MiMedx a�liates.


Fuse Medical is a penny stock (OTC: FZMD) registered to CPM’s
address and Mr. Brooks. Bill Cochrane told an investigator that he is
also involved in Fuse.


According to its SEC Filings, Fuse derives most of its sales from
amniotic tissue which is speci�cally listed in an exhibit as being
MiMedx product.  Fuse discloses contracts with both SLR Medical
and CPM Medical to purchase the product which Fuse then resells to
hospitals and surgical facilities.  It appears the agreement with SLR
was recently not renewed, leaving CPM as the principal supplier of
Fuse.


Source: Fuse Medical 10-Q Filed 8/10/2017


Fuse Medical was created through a reverse merger of various
physician owned partnerships.  A 2014 SEC comment letter reveals
that the podiatrists exchanged their partnership interests for
membership interests in Fuse Medical, with the doctors typically
paying $100 along with a contribution of “general consulting
services”.  Fuse’s 10-K explains that it “intends to utilize the ‘small
investment interest safe harbor’ in the AKS [Anti-Kickback Statute] as
a business model”.
