Trustee of Whiting USA Trust I (WHX) Warns
of Possible Abrupt Substantial Decrease in
Stock Price
Russian Hill Points out New Language in WHX's Annual Report


Mar 28, 2014, 09:00 ET from Russian Hill Capital, LP


NEW YORK, March 27, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Russian Hill Capital, LP ("Russian Hill"), would like to
make investors aware of new language that The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company (the
"Trustee") has included in the latest annual report for Whiting USA Trust I ("WHX" or the
"Trust").   Russian Hill believes that the following new language from WHX's annual report is an
acknowledgement that WHX is overpriced and that investors bear signi�cant risk:  "To the
extent that the Trust units are trading at a price substantially in excess of the aggregate
distributions that may be reasonably expected to be made prior to the termination of the
Trust, the market price decline in Trust units is likely to include one or more abrupt
substantial decreases." [i]


The only assets that WHX holds are the net pro�ts interest (the "NPI") in various oil and natural
gas properties.  The NPI entitles WHX to receive 90% of the net proceeds from the sale of 9.11
million barrels of oil or oil equivalent ("MMBOE"), meaning 8.20 MMBOE are allocated to the
Trust.  To date, 7.12 of these 8.20 MMBOE have been produced and sold.   Russian Hill estimates
that the proceeds from the sale of the remaining 1.08 MMBOE will be less than $2.10.


Since WHX is currently trading at $5.35, Russian Hill has taken a short position in WHX and
expects that the stock will soon see one of the "abrupt substantial decreases" that the Trustee
has warned about in WHX's annual report.


Also included in the annual report is the fact that the expected date of termination of the
Trust has advanced to March 31, 2015 (from June 30, 2015).[ii]  This means that investors will
now receive only four (4) more distributions instead of �ve (5).

Russian Hill believes the new language in the annual report was long overdue.  The substantial
risk of loss that investors carry should have been highlighted much earlier and more
prominently than in ambiguous disclosure in an annual report.  Acknowledging that investors
may be subject to "abrupt substantial decreases" in the value of their holdings and that they
will receive fewer distributions than they had previously expected are both pieces of materially
signi�cant information that Russian Hill believes should have been the subject of a press
release and 8-K.  Russian Hill encourages investors to contact the Trustee[iii] and Whiting
Petroleum[iv] (WHX's parent company) for guidance on the value of their shares.
