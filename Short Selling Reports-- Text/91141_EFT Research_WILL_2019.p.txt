EXECUTIVE	SUMMARY	
FINANCE	&	TECHNICAL	FINDINGS
EXECUTIVE	SUMMARY		


Based	on	our	analysis	and	modeling,	we	believe	that:	


¢  Whi@ng	Petroleum	("WLL")	stock	is	worth	$0	at	current	strip	pricing	
excluding	op@on	value	


¢  WLL	has	March	2020	and	April	2021	maturi@es	looming	


¢  Exis@ng	unsecured	bonds	trading	at	14-15%	create	headwinds	for	a	
refinancing	


¢  Few	wells	will	meet	WLL's	projected	1mm	BOE	EUR	provided	to	investors	


¢  Sanish	infill	wells	are	likely	to	show	considerable	degrada@on	going	forward	
as	WLL	moves	to	DSUs	with	6	+/-	wells	already	drilled	


¢  The	market	is	underapprecia@ng	Sanish	infill	degrada@on	risk	


¢  Analyzing	>	2,000	individual	wells	suggests	WLL	is	oversta@ng	reserves	


¢  Whi@ng	has	less	than	half	of	the	~2,000	drilling	loca@ons	it	claims	to	have

EXECUTIVE	SUMMARY	–	FINANCE	


¢  The	Whi@ng	is	on	the	wall.		With	>$1.1	billion	of	stub-Mar'	20	converts	and	looming	2021	
maturity	that	goes	current	in	1Q20,	WLL	appears	likely	to	tap	the	high	yield	market	for	a	
term	1st	lien	bond	over	the	next	5	months	(1)	


¢  WLL	should	have	to	pay	9.5-10.0%	for	a	$1.2	billion	1st	lien	bond	(400-600	bps	inside	
unsecured	yields)	to	clean	up	the	front-end	maturi@es.		The	incremental	interest	expense	
will	be	devasta@ng	to	the	FCF	story	given	WLL	is	refinancing	1.25%	and	5.75%	debt	


¢  WLL	equity	has	modeled	equity	value	per	share	of	($27.94)	in	our	base	case,	with	a	$12.00	
parallel	shir	across	the	oil	strip	needed	for	the	equity	to	be	worth	$0	


¢  WLL	oil	price	op@onality	appears	mispriced	and	overvalued	by	$2-3	(25-40%);		admitedly	
there	is	op@on-like	leverage	to	oil	prices	–	both	ways	–	but	in	our	view	the	stock	has	less	
upside	leverage	than	oil	futures	call	op@ons			


¢  There	is	op@on	like	exposure	to	oil	in	WLL	stock,	however	the	impact	of	G&A	and	
interest	expense	burn	in	the	context	of	op@on	gamma	remain	underappreciated	


¢  Infill	well	degrada@on	at	Sanish	appears	to	be	a	material	financial	risk	perhaps	not	fully	
understood	


(1)	2020	bonds	mature	in	April,	however,	it	is	unlikely	WLL	wants	the	March	2021	maturity	to	become	a	current	liability	for	1Q20	10Q;	it	occurs,	but	
rarely	do	CFOs	take	refinancing	risk	near	or	at	maturity

EXECUTIVE	SUMMARY	–	TECHNICAL	FINDINGS	
¢  We	believe	Whi@ng	Petroleum	("WLL",	"Whi@ng",	or	the	"Company")	is	consistently	overes@ma@ng	


per	well	reserves	and	type	curve	projec@ons	


o  Oren	referenced	1	million	BOE	type	curve	implies	a	650	MBO	EUR	per	well	which	is	inaccurate	based	
on	actual	produc@on	records	and	reasonable	decline	curve	assump@ons	


•  650	MBO	assumes	65%	oil	at	current	corporate	gas	/	oil	ra@o		


¢  Our	PDP	PV10	value	is	$2.25	billion	at	current	strip	pricing	


¢  Back	da@ng	our	reserve	database	and	inpuung	SEC	pricing	for	2018	company	reserves	appear	to	be	
overes@mated	by	30%	and	was	closer	to	$3.5	billion	


o  If	you	assume	that	reserves	will	con@nue	to	be	~30%	overstated	then	2019	reserves	should	be	~$2.9	
billion,	adjus@ng	for	pricing,	which	would	indicate	a	~$1.6	billion	write	down…	we	will	anxiously	be	
watching	for	that	to	happen	


¢  Varying	degrees	of	“infill”	


o  Ideal	spacing	solves	for	~15%	recovery	factor	


o  Higher	recovery	factors	do	happen,	but	almost	always	a	result	of	over	drilling	(12	well	/	drilling	spacing	
unit	(DSU)	with	modern	comple@ons)	


o  ~660’	or	~7-8	(depending	on	area)	modern	comple@ons	/	DSU	results	in	a	15%	recovery	factor	


¢  We	see	a	high-risk	factor	for	Sanish	and	overall	well	produc@on	degrada@on	moving	forward	


¢  Con@nuing	historic	trend	of	8	-	10%	per	year	of	oil	EUR	degrada@on	moving	forward,	all	else	being	
equal,	creates	a	cash	flow	squeeze	and	reverses	FCF	trends	impairing	the	equity	at	strip	pricing

DATA	SET	&	METHODOLOGY	
PROCESS	AND	MODEL	DRIVERS

EVALUATION	PROCESS	OVERVIEW	


¢  Began	by	crea@ng	a	database	of	per@nent	public	informa@on	including	produc@on	history,	well	construc@on	and	
comple@on	informa@on		


¢  Used	produc@on	data	to	create	individual	decline	curves	for	every	Whi@ng	well	in	North	Dakota,	Montana	and	
Colorado	(all	future	references	to	"Whi@ng"	or	"Whi@ng	produc@on"	mean	these	three	core	areas)	


o  The	overwhelming	majority	of	focus	is	Bakken	and	Three	Forks	wells	in	North	Dakota	


¢  Produc@on	data	was	used	to	create	proved	developed	producing	(PDP)	es@mates	for	Whi@ng's	produc@on.	This	
includes	es@mated	ul@mate	recoveries	(EURs)	or	total	volumes	of	oil	and	gas	that	each	well	is	projected	to	make	in	
the	future	in	addi@on	to	cumula@ve	produc@on	


¢  Used	prior	produc@on	performance	from	recent	wells	(post	2016)	and	created	type	curves	for	each	of	Whi@ng's	
areas	


¢  Created	an	original	oil	in	place	(OOIP)	map	


¢  Allocated	EURs	from	individual	wells	to	sec@ons	


¢  Cross	referenced	the	allocated	EURs	for	each	sec@on	with	the	OOIP	numbers	to	es@mate	oil	recovery	volumes	
(recovery	factors)	


¢  Using	these	numbers	created	an	es@mate	for	future	volumes	of	oil	and	gas	that	could	be	recovered	from	addi@onal	
drilling	within	the	fields	Whi@ng	outlines	


¢  Combined	the	remaining	reserves	es@mates	with	the	es@mates	of	produc@on	from	type	curves	to	determine	the	
number	of	drilling	loca@ons	remaining	on	Whi@ng's	North	Dakota	acreage	


11	*Authors	would	note	that	certain	units	in	North	Dakota	exhibit	recoveries	that	appear	to	be	as	high	as	20%,	however,	we	believe	these	higher	volumes	are	generally	atributable	to	high	density	
drilling	spacing	units	that	have	proven	uneconomic	at	today's	oil/gas	price
OUR	PDP	ESTIMATION	-	BACKGROUND		


¢  The	Proved	Developed	Producing	(PDP)	Model	is	created	to	quan@fy	only	the	value	of	
the	current	produc@on	
o  This	does	NOT	include	volumes	or	value	for	future	drilling	


¢  Produc@on	volumes	for	oil	and	gas	are	quan@fied	by	the	operator	(Whi@ng)	or	their	
purchasers	and	reported	to	each	state	on	a	monthly	basis	
o  Latest	available	data	at	the	@me	of	this	analysis	was	August	of	2019*	


¢  Produc@on	forecasted	off	of	monthly	decline	trend	
¢  Field	type	curve	generated	for	each	field	and	over	different	@me	frames	


¢  Noted	effects	on	both	oil	and	gas	volumes	due	to	curtailed	gas	sales	in	Williams	and	
McKenzie	Coun@es	and	atempted	to	give	credit	to	prior	period	decline	trend	when	
possible	


¢  Generally	a	difficult	dataset	due	to	oren	erra@c	and	inconsistent	oil	and	gas	volumes,	
possibly	due	to	mul@-well	tank	bateries	and	common	gas	meters	being	allocated	
back	to	individual	wells	


¢  Ran	two	years	of	“loss	ok”	to	keep	short	term	volumes	in	line	with	company	
produc@on	what	appear	to	be	wells	at	a	loss	


12	*Authors	would	note	that	public	produc@on	volumes	can	be	off	and	based	on	experience	tend	to	be	less	accurate	within	the	last	6	months	of	the	query.	Some	graphs	on	the	following	page	shows	
significant	difference	between	WLL's	2Q19	reported	in	10Q	versus	current	state	reported	volumes
CREATING	FIELD	TYPE	CURVES	


¢  Based	on	EUR	versus	Time	and	EUR	versus	
proppant/r	its	clear	that	the	frac	jobs	improved	
produc@vity	drama@cally	star@ng	at	the	end	of	
2015	


¢  Frac	size	in	terms	of	ppt/r	was	at	its	peak	in	
2017	and	has	been	decreasing	since	that	@me	


¢  Decided	to	only	use	wells	with	first	produc@on	
post	2016	for	crea@ng	type	curves	


¢  Each	field	was	broken	down	based	on	WLL	
designa@on

FINANCIAL	MODEL	
SUMMARY,	SENSITIVITIES	&	VALUATION
MODEL	SUMMARY	&	NOTES	


Our	analysis	and	modeling	indicates	that:	


¢  High	level	of	confidence	WLL	equity	has	no	intrinsic	value	at	today's	strip	


¢  Op@on	value	appears	mispriced	by	25-50%	vs	oil	futures	call	op@ons	


¢  PUD	degrada@on	reduces	gamma	of	embedded	oil	op@on	


¢  On	our	base	case,	the	stock	is	worth	($27.94)		
o  Assumes	strip	pricing	


o  $1.25	billion	1st	lien	bond	issued	at	9.5%	to	refi'	2020	and	2021	notes	between	now	and	March	2020	


o  As	WLL	infills	Sanish	on	DSUs	with	>=7	wells,	empirical	data	suggests	PUD	well	produc@vity	will	decline	at	8%	per	
annum	


¢  WLL	needs	to	kick	the	can	down	the	road	but	it	will	come	at	a	high	expense	to	the	equity	
o  2023	&	2026	bonds	yielding	14-15%	at	prices	between	66-77	cts	imply	stress	at	the	equity	level	of	the	capital	


structure	


o  The	unsecured	bond	market	is	largely	closed	to	Whi@ng	


o  1st	lien	bonds	likely	cost	9-10%,	increasing	interest	burden	and	ea@ng	into	the	FCF	story	


o  $1.2	billion	of	1L	bonds	+	revolver	draw	do	not	appear	covered	by	asset	value,	net	of	g&a	+	interest	burn		


o  Expect	opportuni@es	in	unsecured	bonds	based	on	views	of	expected	dura@on	of	current	interest	payments	


o  Theore@cal	unsecured	bond	recoveries	in	a	jump-to-default	scenario	are	-44%	immediately	arer	1L	issuance

MODEL	SUMMARY	&	NOTES	


¢  Tier	I	PUD	deple@on	during	low	oil	prices	creates	@me	decay	


¢  WLL	"Tier	I"	acreage	appears	"limited"	at	strip	pricing	
¢  Sanish	–	ex	degrada@on	-	comprises	most	of	market	perceived	WLL	PUD	value		


¢  Sanish	infill	well	degrada@on	arer	7	wells	per	DSU	is	a	material	financial	risk	
¢  Despite	having	liquidity,	WLL	cannot	create	equity	value	at	strip	pricing		


¢  Posi@ve	NPV	PUD	inventory	is	limited	at	current	prices	
¢  The	amount	of	equity	market	capitaliza@on	rela@ve	to	enterprise	value	makes	any

EVALUATION	PROCESS	OVERVIEW	


¢  Began	by	crea@ng	a	database	of	per@nent	public	informa@on	including	produc@on	history,	well	construc@on	and

¢  Used	produc@on	data	to	create	individual	decline	curves	for	every	Whi@ng	well	in	North	Dakota,	Montana	and

¢  The	overwhelming	majority	of	the	focus	is	Bakken	and	Three	Forks	wells	in	North	Dakota

OUR	PDP	ESTIMATION	-	BACKGROUND		


¢  The	Proved	Developed	Producing	(PDP)	Model	is	created	to	quan@fy	only	the	value	of	
the	current	produc@on	
¢  This	does	NOT	include	volumes	or	value	for	future	drilling	


¢  Produc@on	volumes	for	oil	and	gas	are	quan@fied	by	the	operator	(Whi@ng)	or	their	
purchasers	and	reported	to	each	state	on	a	monthly	basis	
¢  Latest	available	data	at	the	@me	of	this	analysis	was	August	of	2019*	


¢  Produc@on	forecasted	off	monthly	decline	trend	
¢  Field	type	curve	generated	for	each	field	and	over	different	@me	frames	


¢  Noted	effects	on	both	oil	and	gas	volumes	due	to	curtailed	gas	sales	in	Williams	and	
McKenzie	Coun@es	and	atempted	to	give	credit	to	prior	period	decline	trend	when	
possible	


¢  Generally	a	difficult	dataset	due	to	oren	erra@c	and	inconsistent	oil	and	gas	volumes,	
possibly	due	to	mul@-well	tank	bateries	and	common	gas	meters	being	allocated	
back	to	individual	wells	


¢  Ran	two	years	of	“loss	ok”	to	keep	short	term	volumes	in	line	with	company	
producing	what	appear	to	be	wells	at	a	loss	


48	*Authors	would	note	that	public	produc@on	volumes	can	be	off	and	based	on	experience	tend	to	be	less	accurate	within	the	last	6	months	of	the	query.	The	graph	on	the	following	page	shows	
significant	difference	between	WLL's	2Q19	reported	in	10Q	versus	current	state	reported	volumes
