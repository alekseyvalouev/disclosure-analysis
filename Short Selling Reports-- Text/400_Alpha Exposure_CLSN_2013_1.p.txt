Celsion: 50% Downside After The HEAT Trial Failed
Jun. 11, 2013 3:39 PM ET114 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Over the last few weeks, Celsion's share price has skyrocketed from below $1 to nearly $2
per share, largely on hopes that the recently presented post-hoc analysis shows that the
Phase III ThermoDox HEAT trial was not a complete failure. We have spoken with key
opinion leaders as well as doctors who participated in Celsion's (NASDAQ:CLSN) Phase
III ThermoDox HEAT study. Their opinions were clear: the HEAT trial was a total failure.
Even the post-hoc subgroup analysis that Celsion presented last month failed to show a
statistically significant benefit in patients and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
Having reviewed the Phase III results and subgroup analysis, all the doctors we spoke
with unanimously believed that Celsion has no chance of regulatory approval.
Furthermore, our research leads us to believe that the road forward for Celsion is perilous,
especially if they pursue another Phase III trial for ThermoDox.


We believe Celsion is a compelling short at these levels and have a price target of $0.73,
which is the current net cash balance per share. We believe the ThermoDox asset is
worthless and that the company's ongoing cash burn, which we estimate at $14 million
this year, means that the company's value will continue to decline. In fact, it is not unusual
for companies to trade below cash when they have no viable assets and are burning cash.


Nothing Compelling from the Phase III Results


What makes us believe Celsion is a compelling short? First, the Phase III trial was a
failure. It failed to meet its primary endpoint of a 33% improvement in Progression Free
Survival (PFS). In fact, there was no benefit at all! Patients who received RFA plus
ThermoDox had a PFS of 13.97 months versus 13.87 months in the control arm. Look at
how closely the two lines overlap with each other.

Second, while Celsion is touting the results of its post-hoc subgroup, experienced biotech
investors know that such analysis is very suspect. Last month, Celsion presented a post-
hoc subgroup analysis that showed ThermoDox may work better when RFA is given for
greater than 45 minutes (see link here).


This is an extreme form of data-mining. When biotech companies fail in their Phase III
trials, they invariably conduct a post-hoc subgroup analysis to dig for any positives. This is
akin to Scott Boras representing a free agent who just finished the season hitting .200,
and going around to teams and presenting data that shows the baseball player averaged
.300 against lefties in 25 games. While the .300 average may seem impressive, the data
set is too small to draw meaningful conclusions, is not indicative of the real world, and
ignores the fact that the baseball player is hitting 0.180 against righties. In Celsion's case,
by believing the subgroup analysis, investors are also believing that the ThermoDox
treatment actually harms patients if it's given for less than 45 minutes. This demonstrates
the absurdity of the subgroup analysis.


In addition, there's no scientific justification for Celsion's subgroup classification in the first
place. A doctor who participated in the clinical trial told us that the 45 minute cut-off time
was more or less arbitrary. He said that while he thought the 45 minute time frame made
sense, he admitted that the 45 minute mark was a company-chosen time frame that made
the data look the best.

Lastly, it's important to note that even the cherry-picked subgroup failed to achieve
statistical significance. Despite Celsion's best efforts at data mining, they could not even
find a subgroup that showed statistical significance! The log-rank p-values for both
Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival failed to reach statistical significance and
were 0.1379 and 0.2213, respectively. These levels are nowhere close to being
statistically significant, which typically requires a p-value below 0.05.

When we asked key opinion leaders for their thoughts on the subgroup analysis, they all
agreed that no conclusions could be drawn from the Phase III trial, nor did they find
anything remotely compelling in the trends in the subgroup data. It was their unanimous
opinion that Celsion cannot obtain regulatory approval in any country based on the results
of the Phase III ThermoDox HEAT study, even on the results of the post-hoc subgroup
analysis. They all said it would not pass regulatory muster with the FDA, the EMA in
Europe, or the CFDA in China.


Risky and Expensive Road Ahead for Celsion


Celsion only option if they want to continue to pursue ThermoDox they is to run a new
Phase III trial. This is not an easy task, and our research indicates that Celsion will face
significant challenges if they choose to conduct another trial.


First, a new Phase III trial will take at least 5 years to complete. Celsion needs to design
an entirely new trial with new parameters, obtain FDA approval for the new trial design,
enroll patients, and then follow the patients through PFS and OS. As reference, the
ThermoDox HEAT Phase III trial began enrolling in the second quarter of 2008 and read
out in the beginning of 2013. That's 4.5 years.


Compounding matters is that Celsion may have to conduct a larger clinical trial. The
doctor who participated in the HEAT study believed Celsion should go for a smaller clinical
benefit than the 33% improvement in PFS that Celsion originally targeted. However, in
order to achieve statistical significance for a smaller benefit, Celsion will need to enroll a
greater number of patients to make the statistics work out. The HEAT trial took 4 years to
enroll. A larger trial would take even longer, perhaps 5 to 6 years to enroll.


In addition, there are other significant challenges that a new Phase III trial will face that
may prevent it from even getting off the group. The doctors we spoke with all said they
would be wary about participating in a trial that originated from such data mining,
especially if the data mining did not result in a statistically significant finding. As a result,
we believe Celsion will face difficulties getting centers and clinicians on board for a new
trial, especially one that will require a lot of patients and potentially take 6-7 years to
complete. The clinicians also told us that RFA times are declining and that fewer and
fewer procedures last as long as 45-90 minutes. This is because the base RFA procedure
is getting more efficient due to advancements of the probes. Clinicians naturally feel that
less surgery time is better, so Celsion will be fighting an uphill batter if they ask these
clinicians to extend the RFA procedure time for longer periods.

Lastly, running a new trial is extraordinarily expensive. Celsion will need to raise a lot of
money, which will heavily dilute existing shareholders. Over the course of the HEAT Phase
III trial, Celsion spent $76 million in R&D and $22 million in G&A, suggesting that Celsion
will need at least $100 million to run a second Phase III trial. Celsion has roughly $50
million of cash today, so they will need to raise at least another $50 million, which
represents another 30 million shares on their existing share count of 62 million. That's
nearly 50% dilution. We believe current shareholders don't fully understand just how much
dilution they are facing if Celsion decides to pursue a second Phase III trial for Celsion.


To illustrate what this means to investors, based on the new share count of 62 million,
even if Celsion gets back to its peak market cap of $327 million in early January before
the failed HEAT data was released, that means Celsion shares will reach $3.50 per share
6 years from now. Biotech companies require a very high discount rate due to the risks
they face, so discounting the 3.50 by 30% per year over 6 years gets a present value
today of $0.75 per share. There's no upside to shareholders if Celsion decides to pursue a
second Phase III trial!


Our share price target on Celsion is $0.73 per share, which is where it was before the
recent increase after it was featured as one of Jon Najarian's picks for ASCO.
Humorously, the company didn't even attend ASCO, so making it a pick for ASCO is odd
to say the least. Even at $0.73 the stock would probably have downside due to the
continued cash burn and lack of promising products.

opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I wonder why it said "Visit us at ASCO" on their website for several weeks - and also listed their booth number.


2. Also, a lead up to another Phase III is surely going to bring the stock up with it, regardless of the final results.


3. "We believe Celsion is a compelling short at these levels and have a price target of $0.73" - Obviously the fund that
just invested $10 million seems to think $1.57 is a fair STARTING price to invest in. What are your thoughts on the

recently closed financing, without warrants, at a 50% premium to market price from just weeks ago?


4. You fail to mention anything having to do with acquisitions that the company said it was pursuing to give it several
other legs to stand on aside from ThermoDox, assuming ThermoDox is off the table - which we know it isn't.


5. The company is burning about $12 mil/year, not $14 mil -and has a cash position CURRENTLY to run to 2015 at
this rate.


6. "To illustrate what this means to investors, based on the new share count of 62 million, even if Celsion gets back to

Wrong. That's using CLSN's absolute highest point. If speculation runs rampant again, it'll blow through $3.50
(although I get your logic here) -- and if the company finds success from TDox or other roads, it'll likely blow through
there as well.

well within his rights and some of the stuff he says here is correct - we're just not looking at the company from
the same perspective going forward from the Phase III results (which, by the way, were priced in on this run -
they're not going to get priced in AGAIN - it happened once, the market reacted once - this is panic selling I'm
guessing). I'm still a buyer and still bullish here.

As I understand RFA has a limit of 3 cm for tumors, but MWA is capable of ablation of 7 cm tumors in half the time. If
CLSN were to start another trial wouldn't they be better off using MWA, especially the unit from BSDM that uses
synchronous antennas?


Also, if RFA has that 3 cm limit, why did CLSN use RFA for larger tumors? And isn't 45 min. a long time to use RFA
considering its inherent limitations?


Another question I have is, does the effectiveness of Doxorubicin deteriorate with high heat because as I understand
T-Dox releases at much lower temperatures?

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  1. That should have read that they did not present at ASCO. They did buy the obligatory booth but
their results were so irrelevant that they didn't present.


2. I think another Phase 3 sends the stock down as the additional dilution that it will entail on a fruitless trial is a net
negative. We disagree on this.


3. I think that the stock was trading at $1.76 when they sold at $1.57 or a 11% discount. This is not impressive and the
buyer most likely just flipped their shares for a quick buck. We don't even know who it was.


4. Acquisitions are a negative. CLSN has nothing but money to offer a seller, which means that they would need to be
the highest bidder to buy anything. Also, the majority of acquisitions destroy value. I would expect the stock to trade
down on an acquisition.


5. So we have a different burn number of $0.5mm per quarter - different estimates - who cares??


6. So now you expect the company to sport a higher market cap then its last peak even though they would be
retesting a drug that already failed? If anything a peak market cap would be lower because the odds of success are
lower now that we already know the drug doesn't work (and it doesn't even work when you cherry pick subgroups).


7. I don't reveal my sources when I speak to them off the record.


CLSN is a microcap company with a failed drug, some cash, and not much else. I think it would be lucky to trade for
$0.73 per share

major funding needed, proving you wrong. The company expects to begin meeting about this as soon as end
of summer, as they've already disclosed. So, you're wrong, again.


3. You're wrong - again, and big time - your comparing the stock price the day of the announcement versus
the day it was closed, where it said DIRECTLY IN CELSION'S PR that the financing was done AT CURRENT
MARKET PRICES. Also we know exactly who the financing was done by -- TRY READING THE FILINGS -
"Sabby Healthcare Volatility Master Fund, Ltd."


4. WRONG WRONG WRONG - the company has a field of 10 companies they are looking to acquire and can
do that easily with stock or cash at this point. If they acquire a profitable company, don't you think that would
contribute to the value of the company? I do.


5. I do, I try and get my facts dead-on correctly.


6. Wrong. Psychology of trading dictates that it could easily move to past price levels despite market cap.


7. That doesn't sound suspicious at all. LOL.

Raven, have a future career in humor.


As regards Sabby, that's even funnier. They are the only investor who has bought CLSN since the failure of
HEAT. It's kind of sad when you can only find one dance partner. My guess is that they've since sold.


Lastly, as regards acquisitions, I maintain that this is a reason for the stock to trade down and not up. In my
opinion, the management here is third tier and has consistently destroyed value. Acquisitions are more of a
risk than an opportunity.

I know the buyer of a majority of CLSN's most recent offering. I can't reveal the identity but the investor does
not believe in Thermodox, or CLSN for that matter. The fund makes it money primarily in the options market,
trading on the volatility.

Fast Money John Najaran pumped this in Final Trade segment 5-30. The pump pushed CLSN to a $2.10 high

In which case that buyer of the offering wants to get rich in a way similar to Icahn. Acquire tons of shares in
the target company (CLSN), write tons of calls and buy lots of puts..........then get your boy Seth Shaw to
publish a very negative article and strike fear into the retail holders, then use your millions of shares to dump
into the market and cause a panic which makes your option position go up 10x. Get rich-- the "effectively
legal"-- market manipulation way.

Good write up but let's call your article for what it truly is.


Planned legal cover for others you are connected to to dump their shares on the open market to cause a
panic and artificially manipulate the stock price.


That is all your article is and it has done it's job nicely. Now the main price manipulators can claim that your
article sent the stock lower and not their planned scheme to tank the stock and profit handsomely in the

I would like to comment on Quoth's point #3: If I had a dollar for every time I saw a company raise capital that was
either a biotech, tech, or junior miner, and the person who bought the offering ended up under water, then I would be

I've seen many of these BS articles by shorties trying to manipulate the market and shake out the weak hands.
Loaded up each time and made a killing. Folks check out what happened to BDBD and EBIX when the bear raids

Well what do you know...THIS is the guy that wrote the article on UNXL. At that time he was writing his

one shred of proof or evidence. He sites the same vague sources in his previous article. Really contemplating

It would be hard to like management now I admit. I was advocating a short term trade when CLSN was under a dollar.

The fact is people buy shares and if they do not do the proper research than shame on them . Best to wait till the 19th
if on the 19th they say well this thing failed and there was not significance to the subset of data than so be it. It is not
duration alone my friends it is more so to do with frequency. Consider the fact that the motion of a rather small object
given the right frequency and conditions can rapidly amplify to take down large bridges or buildings . My guess is data
mining found something of significance that could not be disregarded as an anomaly . Look RFA is a energy pure
plain and simple. The encapsulation is a modification of an existing treatment with a clinical benefit. this is a marriage
of chemistry and physics. If the 2 arms were so close that leads me to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the
chemo was not being released in the concentrations required to show a clinical benefit. They continued to enroll
beyond the initial number that subset i guarantee you are patients are all on the back end of this trial. Do your
homework the run up was far greater in volume that this nobody's spin on initial data released.

stack of gold ryo(dollars). He puts the dice in the cup shakes them up and accidentally lets the dice fall out of the cup
so all players and house can see. well everyone bets on odd because that is what is showing outside the cup . He lifts
the cup which has nothing and everyone yells odd and are happy they all won. no one said hey blind man you let the
dice fall out and we can all see . they take advantage of his handicap for free money . Now the second time around
everyone is excited he says there is plenty more where that came from and slams down twice as many gold pieces as
before . Peoplare now in a frenzy. He does the exact same thing except this time he lets the dice appear like they cam
out of the cup but in reality they fell out of his sleeve. The real dice are still in the cup . everyone bets even ( the dice
outside the cup) he then feels around as if looking for the cup and acts shocked as he feels the dice showing outside
the cup and quickly says how did these fall out of my sleave and puts them back up . Everyone goes what the heck
no no no He then flips over the cup . The dice read Odd everyone loses. Everyone is furious at him at this point. He
kicks some peoples behinds to show who he really is the feared # swordsman and ganster Zatoichi. then he says in
an authoritative al capone type voice " the rules are you bet on the dice in the cup you mean to tell me you people bet
on the dice outside the cup". when they bet on the dice that fell outside the cup they were breaking the rules and had
no grounds to complain and get their money back but they learned a valuable lesson. Nothing is as it seems and that
people must do their best regardless of the circumstance to do what they think is honorable and act with integrity. the

By the way, show us your understanding of "statistically significant", what's the difference between P value 0.05 and
0.10?


12 Jun 2013, 02:55 AM


IntelligentInvester
This is not data mining/selectively manipulating through failed data. The fact is that these trials were large multi-
national efforts with enormous enrollment. Doesn't it make sense to analyze and sift through such a big group and
find out what worked and didn't work? The baseball analogy was also hopelessly inaccurate because this is a drug
whose success will greatly depend on the treatment conditions. They aren't finding subgroups of men over 6 feet tall
or women who have 3 thumbs who responded positively to the treatment; they are finding "subgroups" of different
treatment conditions that included the same diverse subjects. A better analogy is that a large trial was conducted for
using a microwave to cook chicken. Overall, it may not have been effective (i.e. average result = uncooked chicken).
However, if you analyze the data, you will see that if you had cooked the chicken for >45 seconds, it indeed did cook
while most of the short cooking times yielded raw chicken, thus bringing down overall effectiveness and yielding not
statistically significant data. How is that data mining?? It's something called the scientific method. Also, please
educate yourself on the drug and the delivery system, because I for one did. Are you familiar with the Duke professor
and all his tremendously successful publications and work? He has been published in very famous and well-known
PEER REVIEWED scientific journals and is currently being paid to establish a center in Denmark. Fellow scientists
and the government have approved of his work, so I'm pretty sure he didn't just make all this up. If you are familiar
with the scientific specifics, you would know that this delivery system alone is tremendously valuable and has
enormous potential for all kinds of other drugs. Maybe that's why they just got valuable patent protection for this?!  
I for one am typing this comment from a Duke laboratory and am a scientist. Please stick to writing articles about non-
scientific companies (i.e. things you actually know what you are talking about).

TruffelPig
Sorry, but publishing and being successful in cancer treatment are two type of things. How many great ideas
in cancer treatment by top scientists didn't result in anything? Hint: the answer contains the word "many".


The "cooked chicken analogy" is funny but probably not really relevant here. Something that isn't statistically
significant is not scientifically sound. There may be trends etc. in the mined data but its true - the formulation
failed in a clinical phase III - and that is about it. This could be for many reasons.


There are ongoing phase II trials - maybe the data are useful there to guide them but even there I have my
doubts.

company in the future. I can also see a lot of big pharma wanting to buy out CLSN just for that. Also, if you
took a stats class, you would know that statistical significance is also just an arbitrary concept and number. If
you look closely at the subgroup in interest here, you'll find that it is actually significant. Also, statistics doesn't
make something scientifically sound or not; science makes something scientifically sound. The delivery
system isn't just a "great idea" but rather it is something that has actually been proven to work. The problem
right now is that it isn't working with Thermodox in its current treatment parameters. I'm not going to say that I
am 100% confident that Thermodox will be a miracle drug that is going to save millions of lives but I will say
that the science behind it is very sound, and there's a lot of potential if the treatment is modified to reflect the
findings. I guess time will tell.

"Oncothyreon (ONTY) represents one of the few opportunities for investors to take a high probability, statistically-

Around July 20 2011 ONTY stock was around $11 and today almost 2 years after your article the stock ONTY is

If you ask a HCC patient if he would like to use a treatment which only improves about 10%, you can guess what the
answer is. There is no need for CLSN to target 33% improvement.


It also makes logical sense to require minimum treat time to make Thermodox effective, as it takes time to have
Thermodox circulate through the liver and get released by the RFA.


12 Jun 2013, 12:44 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  To properly power a trial to show a 10% improvement in the hazard ratio would probably
need over a thousand people (possibly even two thousand) in a new phase 3. Such a trial would take a
decade or so to enroll. I think liver cancer is a lost cause for CLSN.

That they powered for 33% was either hubris or deceit: it made for a smaller study. And they didn't get close.

The author has a point saying that post-hoc subgroup analysis can be suspect. However, in this case, it is at best a
total misunderstanding to call Celsion's analysis an "extreme form of data-mining".


It seems rather reasonable to conjecture that the duration of ablation would affect results (this, in some way, is similar
to an assumption that effects of any drug would be dependent on the dose). Without seeing the data, it is not clear
that the effect is due to the duration itself or the correlation between the duration and other patient-specific factors.
Either way, there is strong evidence that the treatment helps (and helps a LOT - did you see that hazard rate in the
included graphs?!) for a reasonably selected subgroup of patients.


I am not surprised that statistical significance was not achieved. Most likely, there simply are not enough people in the
subgroup to make the result statistically significant. The company will most likely have to deal with this by running an
additional trial, which is nothing new and has been fairly clear for a long time now.


Think about it this way, the subgroup analysis results have turned a failed phase 3 study into a very promising phase
2 study that should be helpful in developing a good design for an additional phase 3 trial.


Investing in CLSN at this point is similar to investing in a biotech with very promising phase 2 results and under 100M
market cap. Not too many opportunities like that around.

totally agreed. Bought more today. The downside risk vs. upside potential makes it worth to make a bet.

CLSN's problem with asserting a time duration for RFA w/TD is confounding of causation. RFA is used alone,
already. Claiming that better outcomes with longer RFA is *due to TD* won't fly with FDA. It could be that
more RFA, by itself, is better. In fact, CLSN *should* know how much energy, and for how long, is required to
release a given dose of dox from TD in situ. That they're now making a 45 minute claim is prima facie
evidence that they don't *really* understand the MoA of their product.

This shows total lack of understanding of the released data. The comparison is between people who received
RFA for >= 45 min plus placebo and people who receives RFA for >= 45 min plus treatment. It is common for
a company to not fully know everything there is to know about medical procedures and drugs - just look at the
package inserts of some of the most successful and widely used drugs on the market.

What did I say? Buy whenever "Alpha Exposure" writes a fraudulent and bearish article. The truth comes out and the
stock returns to some normalcy. Big 2-day gains :)

I'm not saying its buy and hold. I sold UNXL after 2 days as well. I think your long-term thesis on a few of
these may be correct, but I think the initial sell-off from the results is unwarranted given some of the ambiguity
of the articles, and the stocks regain some of the losses as a result. Keep doing your thing though because its
working well for me (and likely you as well)

Doesn't change the fact that your article on UNXL was full of fabrications. Share price isn't proof of truth.


I've only been trading it and have no long positions but your articles should make you ashamed when you visit
your mother.

Taken into context review the PPS from november 2011 to december . This is when they announced enrollment
beyond 600 . My guess sometime a few months before this release they found out the initial data was poor a leak
happened that is why the PPS went south October through dec 2011, dont be naive insiders always leak no matter
what you think. Sometime shortly after they found this wasnt working out as planned they stumbled on what they
thought was an Optimization of RFA . Being there was no way to conclusively prove that at the stage in the trial they
upd the enrollment to 700. Read these statements below and tell me if my thoughts are wrong .


Nov 2011 CEO states 
Top-line data from 380 events is due "as early as 1 year from now", and this will be accelerated by extending HEAT
enrollment to 700 patients, 
( not real reason IMO they couldnt come out and say this is a flop at 500 patients but good news is 50 of the patients
have double PFS from extended RFA that would not be enough to confirm added time improved PFS.) 
they go one in PR 
the decision to continue enrollment beyond 600, assuming enrollment goes as planned, should provide a benefit in
terms of time to final data of 4-6 months based on their internal modeling.The PFS bar as been set high intentionally
to conserve alpha...an overall survival bar has not been set, but will have to be trending in the right direction.
Thermodox toxicity profile again will be evaluated in parallel on a risk-benefit basis, as it has been in previous DMC
reviews." 
The key word assuming things go as planned. things like 
he says we set the bar high for endpoint , if this is making the patients sicker and they are seeing little benefit then
they would stop at 600 . they were silent most times after this . they knew then it was unlike for the FDA to approve
even at 700 The last set of 300 patients will be undeniable proof this truly works. it would have . The subset is real If
MT is reading this post he would say that little SOB nailed it a regular perry mason. So buy this stuff works dont be
fooled by AF the volume on the buys were not duplicated in sales over past few days . all the shorts did was rob the
faint of heart or ill informed. The big dogs arent so dumb. 20% float is not controlling wont bounce below 130 . the
institutional investor wont budge on no news

Celsion has a "delivery platform", not a "drug".The "drug" delivered was doxorubicin, an already FDA approved drug
for chemotherapy. What Celsion does is DELIVER already existing FDA approved drugs in a TARGETED fashion.
They do this by encapsulating the approved drug in a liposome, that then "leaks" the drug on target when heat is
applied. The benefit of this type of delivery is such that the drug is not delivered SYSTEMICALLY, thus causing much
less side effects and much less damage to other parts of the body (in this case the heart).


What some fail to see is that the delivery platform worked VERY WELL. This was proven in the trial. There were NO
SIDE EFFECTS. Do you have any idea what the side effects of doxorubicin are when administered systemically? It's
catastrophic in some cases.


This "delivery platform" which is PATENTED, can be used to deliver just about ANYTHING in much lower dosages,
with HIGHER concentrations to the targeted site. Celsion is working with other companies to encapsulate other
products. It is of particular interest to companies whose drugs are going off patent, and could regain patent protection
if encapsulated.


What went wrong in this particular trial is likely several things.


1) there was no protocol for the length of time heat was administered by RFA. This meant some got 20 minutes, some
got 2 hours, and everything in between. The optimal length of time for Drug release has been determined to be 45
minutes. Had every one of the 700 patients received 45 minutes of RFA, the outcome would likely have been much
better.


2) The FDA approved drug doxorubicin is probably not the best drug to target liver cancer with.


3) Distant metastases in liver cancer are a severe problem, and caused further problems in the trial, since the
doxorubicin was highly targeted.


What does all that mean?


It means Celsion has a very valuable proven drug delivery system, that must now be targeted to the right cancers with
the right drugs. It means that the 2 ongoing trials will probably have better outcomes now that they know these details.


Furthermore, Celsion has also patented a STORAGE method for storing these nano-particles and all liposomes. No
one else has this storage capability. That alone is a valuable technology with potential for a good royalty stream to
develop. Other companies will license this technology from Celsion.


Lastly, Hisun pharmaceuticals still has a development deal in place with Celsion, and remains interested in
Thermodox, if the subgroup data can be shown to benefit ANY subgroup. China has half the world's HCC cases, and
currently has no SOC. A deal here based on the subgroup data is still very possible, and requires NO FDA approval.

Celsion has about 50 million dollars in cash, which at the current burn rate of 1 million a month can keep them going
for 4 years. This company is in no danger of vanishing, and is more likely to come back within a year with a
marketable product, and licensing revenues.

That is all correct, but there are companies with better, more efficient targeted drugs. I personally prefer
$ECYT in that space. Even some big ones have targeted drugs (Abraxene by $CELG). The use of Dox still
puzzles me - it is very inefficient in many many applications.


Your mentioning of the fact that the system doesn't seem to work in metastasis could indicate one weakness
(but I didn't read up on that). I am not sure you are actually correct in that point! They are treating other than
liver cancers with the liposomes in clinical trials. Metastasis also have leaky vasculature and the nano-
liposomes should accumulate in them due to their size there too by EPR effect. It is again your point 2 I think
which is responsible for inefficiency - the use of Dox........


In the end I agree that there is some potential in the platform and one could probably let a small position just
sit and see what happens. Could easily recover from here.

Author’s reply »  I don't what you call thermodox - drug, delivery platform, popsicle - it doesn't matter when
thermodox doesn't work. Let me repeat that: Thermodox does not work. I think it's therefore worthless.


02 Jul 2013, 09:54 AM


TruffelPig
@Alpha Exposure: For an author of an article about this company that comment is really something. The
liposomes are the platform, the Dox is the drug. Those liposomes are designed to disintegrate at a certain
temperature which is a nice property. That platform could be used with another drug. Not sure what the
company would be worth based on that though.


Your comment is what I expect from a short-seller (=inverse pumper).


02 Jul 2013, 11:28 AM


Lorax666
If CLSN is so smart, then why choose a drug known, at the time, to be lousy in the application? Besides,
there are a slew of "targeted" delivery micro-caps out there. None have shown much promise. And, how does
ThermoDox clear the oversized drug load? Haven't seen that explained. At least DCTH has a mechanism,
which may not work, of course.
