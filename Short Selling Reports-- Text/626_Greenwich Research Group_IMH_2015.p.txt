Impac Mortgage: Poor Business Model, Misleading Accounting:
Target: $5.96
May 11, 2015 2:06 PM ET31 comments

Summary


Recent stock runup due solely to acquisition of Cash Call.


Cash Call successfully sued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and a
number of states for deceptive and abusive practices, harassment and charging
customers interest rates of 100%+.


Cash Call is a refinancing machine that generated huge profits in Q1, 2015, but that
won't continue and is already waning.


Most all profits from Cash Call must be paid back to previous owners.


Legacy IMH business continues to lose money.


Impac Mortgage Holdings (NYSEMKT:IMH) has recently experienced a dramatic run-up in
stock price. Starting at around $5 last November, it doubled to $10 in early February, then
on to $15 two weeks ago, and recently peaked at $28. It's already correcting and the
technicals look bad going forward.

Why the runup? There is no good reason. In our opinion, IMH has little value as a
company, and no good future prospects. The only catalyst has been the one-time high
quarterly earnings results put up by IMH in Q1, 2015. IMH reported $2.94 EPS on April 23.
But these numbers were due solely to IMH's recent acquisition of Cash Call ('CC') and
they won't continue going forward. In addition, CC has a dubious history, having been
sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and by a number of states. Given
CC's past, we can only conclude that IMH made the acquisition as a desperate attempt to
save its money-losing business.


Cash Call (NYSE:CC) in the News


Here is some of the history on CC:


In December, 2013, CC was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
for collecting money consumers did not owe. The CFPB alleged that the defendants
engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices, including illegally debiting consumer
checking accounts for loans that were void.

In September, 2014, CC was sued by the West Virginia Attorney General and paid a
$13mm fine after being accused of abusive debt collection in violation of the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). CC allegedly "harassed its consumers through
excessive phone calls throughout the day and night, threatened involving local law
enforcement, disclosing private financial information with friends and acquaintances of the
borrowing consumers, and charging their customers 139 percent interest on the loans
serviced". Cash Call allegedly made 84,371 calls in total to 292 West Virginia borrowers.
That's an average of 289 calls to each borrower.


In October, 2014, the Iowa Department of Justice announced that the Superintendent of
Banking repealed CC's Iowa lending license. CC was banned from lending in Iowa, and
had to pay victimized borrowers $1.5mm. The charges brought for illegally charging Iowa
borrowers interest rates of up to 169% on their loans. CC's defense argued that the loans
were made on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation so were outside the laws of Iowa.


In August, 2013, N.Y. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against CC for
violations of New York's usury and licensed lender laws alleging CC charged annual rates
of interest on loans from 89% to more than 355% to thousands of New York consumers.
CC was ordered to pay 1.5mm in fines and to provide refunds to borrowers.


In December, 2013, Colorado filed a civil complaint accusing CC of operating illegally in
Colorado and servicing and collecting predatory loans made to approximately 5,000
consumers statewide, with annual percentage rates (APRs) that ranged from 90 percent
to in excess of 350 percent. CC again claimed it was not subject to the laws of Colorado
since it was operating under tribal immunity and preemption. But the Denver District Court
rejected those claims.


But CC hasn't stopped these business practices. In February, 2015, California ordered CC
to pay $1mm in fines and restitution to consumers for "exorbitant" interest rates and using
"bait and switch" tactics.


In this section of the Consumer Affairs website, consumers write on their experiences with
CC. There are lists of instances listed with allegations such as interest rates above 100%,
loan balances that increased after payments were made, agents that are "rude and
harassing", "incompetent and shady", "who had more tricks in his vocabulary than
scrabble". The complaints number more than 400 and are as recent as last month - so it's
obvious that CC has not changed its practices.

IMH signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) to acquire CC on January 2nd. The
acquisition closed March 31st. The value of executing the APA on January 2nd is that IMH
was able to include CC's 1st Quarter 2015 results in the results of IMH's previous
operations (the 'Legacy IMH business'). The agreement includes:


· purchase price of $10mm cash (with $5mm due May 5, 2015 and the other $5mm due
over the ensuing 12 months


· 500k shares of IMH stock


· earn-out of:


o 100% of CC earnings for January and February, 2015


o 65% of CC earnings for March thru December, 2015


o 55% of CC earnings for 2016, and


o 45% of CC earnings for 2017


Because it's a call center, CC is a refinance machine. Call centers do very well in
refinancing waves, which is what occurred in 1Q15 and the beginning of 2Q15. But the
wave is waning now due to the recent rally in interest rates. So CC put up a great first
quarter number, but it won't continue. The Legacy IMH business generates losses. That's
why the stock price was at $5. But the significant first quarter operating profits at CC -
even with the continued losses at Legacy IMH - allowed IMH to book non-cash results
(Deferred Tax Asset - DTA) that further improved finance results. Obviously this can't
continue.


IMH ran out of cash in 4Q14 and required a $6mm short-term note investment. Further,
On May 8th IMH announced a convertible deal at 7.50% convertible at $21.5 (Guess there
is always a greater fool). However in this case the Fool was already saddled with a huge
position in the stock that they need to protect. The main lender of the $25M debt raise was
the Pickup family who already owns about 20% of the outstanding shares. They loaned
IMH $20M 2 years ago when the company was out of cash, now they're doing it again.
Now one wonders why they chose such a ridiculous convert level. "hey, lets use $21.5 and
maybe the stock will hang around there and we can get a better price for an equity raise.
Of course it will not matter if the stock ever reaches the convert level, the Pickup's just
want to protect their equity investment. They are loaded with the stock. They are happy to
get a 7.5% interest rate while they hope to eventually offload their equity position for $5-$8
in the future years. The family was the only one willing to make this transaction. The

payment for CC was necessary by May 15th and the company could not find institutional
investors to do it. The Pickup's were just protecting their stock investment. If you listen to
the last conference call 13 minutes in IMH states that it needs $50mm or an additional
$25mm in equity capital this month and needs to complete an equity/debt deal before then
as they have little operating cash today. The company has indicated that the next raise will
most likely be equity, but they have not located any investors at this time.


In the 4Q14 earnings call, IMH reported that CC originations - they bought loans on a
correspondent basis in 4Q14 - were 76% refinances. While they didn't report this same
metric in the 1Q15 results - wherein they now report CC originations as "retail" -
management has stated that when they provide the 10-Q, the refinance % of 1Q15 CC
originations will exceed 4Q14 levels. In other words, it's mostly all refinancing. IMH paid
$140mm for a refinance machine. As a call center originator, it has shown no ability to
originate loans direct to retail in a purchase-dominated market. The press release on the
acquisition was very detailed, i.e. sufficient so that IMH will not have to file a 10-Q
prior to raising capital. This is advantageous as they will not provide detailed data
showing that CC originations are even more refinance-centric than they were in 4Q14.


The Legacy IMH business loses money. For 2014, IMH lost (-$0.68) per share and
has an operating loss of (-$10.8mm). A significant portion of revenue is from Real
Estate Services, money it pays itself for managing its own loan portfolio of behalf of
investors. These are loans originated in prior years and securitized. For managing defaults
and other activities, IMH charges fees. This portfolio is amortizing and these fees will
subside over time.

investment to meet cash requirements.

A LOOK AT 1Q15 RESULTS - THE BENEFIT OF THE OPTICS OF CASH CALL


Cash Call originations were recorded as "retail" in 1Q15 at gross GOS margin of 275bp.
Refinances as a % of total originations exceeded 76% allowing for a very efficient cost-to-
originate of 111bp (very little media spend required), and once again legacy IMH lost
money. Putting aside the change in Fair Value (FV) of debt and the tax accounting, IMH
reported $17mm of operating income in 1Q15, approximately $1.67 per share if you
include the 500k shares issued to Cash Call on 4/1/2015. Management also noted that
$3mm of the $6.5mm MSR charge was mark-to-market of the MSR so if you add that
back, operating earnings were ~$1.94 for the quarter which resulted in a significant rally in
the shares.

IMH Expenses ($17.2mm)


Operating Results at IMH ($6.2mm)


The IMH Legacy business continues to lose money - even more in 1Q15 than it did in prior
quarters - and this in a refinance wave. The impact of buying CC is obvious - a
refinance machine will burden the balance sheet (increased goodwill, increased
intangible assets) but make the income statement look great even though almost all
of the earnings are required to be paid out to CC management.


To be clear, the 164bp above is CC gross GOS of 275bp less its cost to originate of 111bp
(both in the press release). It is recorded in the consolidated IMH as a net number.


FOCUS ON 1Q15 CASH


IMH reported ending cash of $5.6mm which means it burned $4.4mm of cash during the
quarter. The biggest use of cash is the increase in warehouse line haircuts given CC large
origination volumes. As you can see, the $25mm cash payment owed CC puts them at
significant cash deficit requiring a capital raise. We highly suspect IMH sold more
mortgage servicing to raise cash and these funds will be received in 2Q15. Going forward,
IMH is likely to continue selling originated servicing rights, and future earnings streams, to
raise cash to meet warehouse equity obligations and future CC payments.

THE 2015 OPERATING MODEL


Assuming a slow-down in refinancing activity, Legacy IMH will continue to lose money on
an operating basis. Management indicated April originations for CC will be $600mm.


Assuming even a modest decline - not one indicative of a ~80% refinance-driven business
- we estimate 2Q15 net GOS revenue of ~$27mm falls to $16mm in 4Q15 and then
continuing at that level. Obviously GOS could fall much lower if refinancing declines a lot
and the company is not able to generate purchase-related mortgages. There is virtually
no historical evidence of a call center strategy that worked in a purchase market.
These assumptions - probably too optimistic vis-à-vis CC originations - take estimated
2Q15 EPS of $1.24 to $0.51 for 4Q15 and to $0.36 for 4Q16 on a PRE-TAX BASIS. This
assumes $50mm raised at $15 per share plus the convert.


Using a (relatively high-end) multiple of 8x for pre-tax earnings, and after making
adjustments for the contingent payments, the retained portfolio and the RE servicing
runoff, we see a company that looks like it has a value of $33.52 per share now, but
drops to ~$12.99 per share by 4Q15 and then to $5.97 per share by 4Q16:

You said "allowed IMH to book non-cash results (Deferred Tax Asset - DTA) that further improved finance results.
Obviously this can't continue."


Actually, it can continue. They booked $24 million out of $163 million. It most certainly can continue, especially with
the ramp up to 40 states.

A lot of people have lost money trying to be too clever.


Why would you short a stock like this with this sort of volatility?


This thing spikes like crazy.

The only statement in your article that makes sense is the current $33.52 valuation. Once Q2 numbers are released
that number will only increase and you and all the other shorts will have to cover sending the share price even higher.

Who would short a stock earning $5.00 and trading at 3.6x??? Who knows where interest rates are going
from here. Based upon today's move, the 30 year mortgage is only about 13 bps off its lows in April...hardly a
move that is capable of reducing volumes like they think. Whats more, the writer fails to mention that while
their estimates go down, IMH is on a path to doubling its ownership of cash call, thus, even in a draconian
scenario where CC's earnings get cut in half, IMH earns it back through the buyout provision going from 45%
to 100%.

Cash call provides great synergy and its mortgage division has been ranked by the Mortgage Bankers Association as
one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the U.S. It had about $6.5 billion in total originations in 2013
(latest figure). I think the deal was a great one to make. I think IMH benefits greatly/quickly.


The mortgage division is very different from cash calls personal and commercial loan business. The latter business is
staying with cash call and has been the source of most legal issues mentioned above. These issues are not from the
mortgage division. Need facts checked.


Agree with D. Sims above, why no mention of the Macquarie deal or alt-qm business?

Macquarie only buys the AltQM's http://lat.ms/1Fh4IRt


As stated above: Also on paper this IMH outfit LOOKS like should trade for $33.52 per share now plus the
assumed $50 Million raised at $15 per share plus the convert the Pickup Family Trust have brought.


Who else has better grasp on the refinance market and the justification of a LBO of $140 Million for CashCall
Mortgage that is a hidden timebomb itself BEFORE the acquisition by IMH?

The legal issues noted at the beginning of your article were with the consumer loan division. Impac bought
the mortgage division. Unless you were trying imply guilt by association. I didn't read beyond that as it looked
to be just a hit piece, so I don't know if there were any redeeming qualities in the rest of your article.

R Investments, the info you posted looks to be Industry related and not company specific. As an retired owner
of many companies, these type of actions are fairly common across a wide range of sectors. Impac will need
to make changes to it's pay practices to resolve this and pay compensation.


12 May 2015, 12:21 PM 


elliotaltman@gmail.com
The aforementioned earn out %s are what is owed to CC as part of the APA. Impac owns CC and will recognize all
earnings generated from the acquisition once the payouts are completely in 2017. All earnings will continue to be
reflected on the income statement.


11 May 2015, 04:46 PM 


Craig Mechling
Everyone had their opportunity to buy IMH at the targeted $5.96/share - back on 12/2/2014. These guys were left on
the dock when the IMPAC boat sailed on 3/23/2015!


It would take a very long article to answer each negative points. But IMPAC has enough cash for the $10 Million Cash
Call 2015 payment coming from the Residual Trust portfolio - without even touching GAAP revenue or profits.


While I do expect some more retracement in the stock price - near term - $6.00 is "Somewhere, Beyond the Sea".

"we see a company that looks like it has a value of $33.52 per share now"


So you see $33.52 pps now? Why would you short this now in this range? Wait til it hits $28-30, short and then
release the article.


11 May 2015, 04:55 PM

Its also imortant to note that the CFPB and various law suits are all targeted at CCs consumer business and
were initiated back in 2013. Impac only bought the mortgage operations and going foward CC uses IMHs
licenses not CCs. The reason IMH was able to buy a company earning $114M (25M contingent payout
divided by 88%, IMHs Q1 ownership pct) or $11 per IMH share was because CC has these issues with the
regulators and needed to find a buyer, not the other way around as the writer from Greenwich says.


11 May 2015, 07:30 PM 


R Investments
I beg to differ, both companies needed each other since IMH sold their brick and mortar branches to save
$700k a mth in expenses and was out of cash end of 2014 and J Reddam could reduce his liabilties of CC
without having to put money into his company. There is litigation against Cash Call Mortgage as well.

CC Mortgage will use IMH licenses going forward because CC's are revoked in many cases,some were even
denied. The license of CashCall, Inc. to act as a mortgage lender is Connecticut is hereby REVOKED
effective thirty days following the Commissioner’s execution of this Order. http://bit.ly/1QEjvHO

Will Impac not be liable in any class action lawsuits from this CashCall Mortgage LBO and/or is the $25MM plus
earnings going forward CashCall is getting to help pay for all the litigation going forward?


12 May 2015, 12:15 AM

R Investments, you seem to have trouble understanding what Impac purchased. Unless you trying to imply
that the mortgage division is liable for legal actions against the consumer loan division.

there is probably opportunity here because this company is confusing as hell. unfortunately I can't figure out if it is on
the long side or the short side. :-)

If I was looking to buy, add or cover a short, the open gap below $15 would be a good target. It should fill at
some point in time.

Author’s reply »  After looking at several comp's we still believe that origination volume will be higher than expected
but the margins will be squeezed 20 bps more than our expectation. We have put the short back on.

Have any of the shorts taken any time to figure out how much of the float is actually held by insiders and their friends?
These people have a very long-term view on the stock. You have pretty much shorted 80% of the available float in a
stock that has a PE of 5.

Yo Beta
On the one hand you say pickups have plenty of stock and will take the 7/12%, so how do your account for pickups
adding at the $15-18 dollar range. Only reason to add open market is to make money. 
he does not need any more control.


there was massive insider buying, at this range. show me another stock with that kind of insider buying and at 4-5x
earnings, and I will show you another winner!


30 Oct 2015, 09:36 AM 


Craig Mechling
Based on David's comment, the soon to be announced 3Qresults (which I expect will be quite good) should create a
short squeeze that will magnify the price run-up in early November.

Greenwich Research is overwhelming me with detailed calculations and assumptions about future earnings.


Their proposal (from this morass of numbers) are that investors should: 
(1) sell IMH short or,  
(2) get out while you can

5/20/2018 Impac Mortgage: Poor Business Model, Misleading Accounting: Target: $5.96 - Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc. (NYSEMKT:IMH) | Seekin…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3169886-impac-mortgage-poor-business-model-misleading-accounting-target-5_96 20/21


But the argument is based on two unproven assumptions: 
1) Interest Rates are surely going to rise 
2) IMPAC's business will surely collapse when this happens


I have several problems accepting the Greenwich proposition:


THE FED 
Every January, since 2008, market forecasters and seers have been telling us that the FED must raise interest rates.
Ben Bernanke himself set off the famous "taper tantrum" in the spring of 2013 by warning us that QE would end.


But after two whole years, the FED has not raised rates. Contrarily, central banks around the globe are cutting reserve
requirements, reducing rates, and expanding their own versions of QE - whilst the IMF is begging the U. S. Fed to
stand pat.


Even if rate normalization were to begin - none of us expect the increases to be so fast or so great that the refinance
market would suddenly disappear.


THE ALT-QM CARD 
IMAC sold and securitized over $90 BILLION of Non-GSE mortgages from its founding in 1994 through the collapse
of 2007. In 2014, they made arrangements with Macquarie to purchase any and all ALT-QM mortgages they can
produce - so that loan volumes will not be constrained by the size of IMPAC's own balance sheet.


I would expect IMPAC to expand its ALT-QM business with sufficient speed to grow (total originations) even if
refinance volumes are in decline.


THE MANAGEMENT TEAM 
Greenwich Research wants us to believe that the management team - which survived the greatest depression in
Residential Real Estate Finance since 1932 (no help at all from any Government Agencies, thank you) - would be
unable to cope with changes in the market place.


IMPAC Mortgage's future success depends on how well its executive leadership adapts to a constantly-changing,
ultra-competitive environment.


So, at the end of the day, you are betting on Joe Tompkinson and his staff to succeed (or fail) in an uncertain world.


The Third Quarter Earnings Call is coming soon. Time to place your bets.....

The fact that they actually survived from 2007-2011 (it was like emerging from Noah's flood) proves how nimble,
talented and tough the leadership has been.


But now, their entire world is getting better. The U. S. housing market is constantly improving at a sustainable pace,
and is on track to become fully "normal" by the end of 2017. This is precisely when IMPAC's buyout obligations to
CASH CALL MORTGAGE will be finished.


Mortgage finance is getting better and the market pressure for more "sensible" credit terms certainly plays to IMPAC's
strength as a long-time non-agency originator. It helps tremendously that the biggest and most dominant competitors
since 2008 (too-big-to-fail banks) are withdrawing from residential real estate in search of more traditional commercial
banking business.


Finally, the expansion of CASH CALL MORTGAGE division from just 11 states to a national market has barely begun.


I just can't imagine that IMPAC will fall over and collapse at this point, when there is still so much positive momentum -
both internally and externally.

Interesting note from Earnings report. Margins improved in Q3:


"...an increase in gain on sale margins of 20 bps to 205 bps, as compared to the second quarter. "


20 bps margin improvement is pretty big increase. No wonder this quarter turned out pretty nicely with Q3 $1.48 EPS
and operating income of $0.83 EPS. This fact ran opposite to the prediction of this article in which the author stated
"the margins will be squeezed 20 bps more than our expectation." The author's predicted a 145 bps Q3 2015 sale
margins which runs counter to the actual Q3 sale margins of 205 bps as stated by the company's Q3 earnings report.
