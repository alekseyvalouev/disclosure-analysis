Odyssey Marine: Shrinking Cash Position Fails To Cover Current Bills,
CEO Greg Stemm Must Go
May 13, 2014 8:24 AM ET73 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


OMEX cash declined by $25.8mm (to ~$6mm) in Q1 alone, after making required
$13mm debt payments and >$10mm cash burn.


Estimated May 13th (today) cash position between $400k and $3.3mm fails to cover
$6.5mm of current cash liabilities estimated due within 3 months.


OMEX appears to have converted some or all of $2,347,826 Additional Notes after
March 31st into stock at ~$1.80/sh to preserve cash, contrary to CFO statements to
repay in cash.


New $10mm Credit Line only can be drawn AFTER gold salvaged from SS Central
America and appraised: unclear how OMEX can make July payroll without a rapid
cash injection.


Drastic times require drastic action: OMEX Board needs to consider action to
replace CEO Greg Stemm.


Though I have not yet been accused of being an optimist with respect to Odyssey Marine
(NASDAQ:OMEX), even I was shocked by the excessive level of cash burn and increase
in share count in this most recent 10-Q. It appears that without a rapid injection of capital,
OMEX would be unable to make payroll: potentially as soon as this coming month.


The Directors' Dilemma


While I obviously disagree with the business practices and CEO's conduct at Odyssey
Marine, I did have the pleasure to meet with the OMEX Chairman Brad Baker and Lead
Director Max Cohen at a recent NYSE event. I say (truly without sarcasm) that they are as
reasonable, pleasant, and mature as any directors I've met and I have sincere sympathy
for their situation.


The CEO and his management team runs a company, not the Directors: whose primary
job is to hire and monitor the CEO. I would not be surprised if the Directors were as
stunned as I with the disappointingly high cash burn this last quarter. I have myself been in

similar difficult situations that they appear to facing at the moment. So while I will leave it
to the large shareholders to file 13D's and am short the stock, I would say a careful
examination of the CEO position is warranted in the board room.


While CEO Greg Stemm's PR background may give him a certain competitive edge in the
business of fertilizer production; if OMEX is to transform itself into a phosphate miner, new
leadership appears necessary with a stronger focus on cost controls.


With that, here are some questions that I would like to be able to ask on the coming
conference call at 11am est today, if only they were open to more than just the Craig
Hallum and Lake Street bankers eager for underwriting fees!


How Does OMEX Intend to Address their Rapid Cash Burn and Negative Working
Capital?

How Did the Share Count increase after March 31, 2014?


Despite "non-dilutive" financings such as Mako/Oceanica, Share-count is rapidly
increasing including at least 828,958 shares SINCE MARCH 31, 2014 and 5.9mm shares
(7.5% dilution) in the last 12 months.


May 2, 2014: 84,786,098

April 18, 2013: 78,870,929


The date listed in the 10-Q for share count is May 2, 2014. Was the full $2,347,826
principal remaining on the "Additional Note" (that was indicated to have been paid off in
full in this PR) converted into shares rather than paid in cash (as indicated previously)?
What was the end result for this note in terms of cash and stock conversion?


Do the Fifth Third $10mm Credit Line Collateral Requirements apply before or after
your 45% share of SS Central America potential recovery?


According to the loan agreement, you require collateral gold to be recovered before a
draw down, are these numbers pro-rata for your 45% share or gross?


2.6. Loan Disbursements. The Loan proceeds shall be reserved by Lender and disbursed
to Borrower under the following procedures:


(NYSE:A) Interest Reserve Account. At closing, the sum of $500,000.00 of the Loan
proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to an interest reserve account #7420836376 with
Lender (the "Interest Reserve Account"). All accrued interest payments payable under the
terms of the Note shall automatically be debited from the Interest Reserve Account. The
Interest Reserve Account is hereby pledged as additional security for the Loan.


(NYSE:B) Loan Advances. Under the terms of the AON Insurance Policy, as the Valuable
Cargo is salvaged from the wreck, Borrower is obligated to deliver to the Odyssey Cargo
Insurer a detailed inventory of the Valuable Cargo (the "Cargo Reports"). Copies of the
Cargo Reports shall be delivered to Lender. Lender will make Advances of Loan funds to
Borrower upon verification of the Valuable Cargo based on the Cargo Reports at the
following Advance Rates:


(NYSE:I) $2,000.00 per coin for any $20 Double Eagle (for years 1850 through 1857), for
the first $5,000,000.00 in Advances under the Loan. After the first $5,000,000.00 is
advanced on the Loan, the Advance Rate shall be $1,000.00 per coin for any $20 Double
Eagle (for years 1850 through 1857) until the remaining $5,000,000.00 is advanced.


(ii) for each gold bar, 50% of appraised market value (verified by a 3rd party appraiser
reasonably acceptable to Lender) for the first $5,000,000.00 in Advances under the Loan.
After the first $5,000,000.00 is advanced on the Loan, the Advance Rate for each gold bar
shall be 25% of the appraised market value.

How long will the SS Central America archaeological preservation phase and site
mapping take? Will OMEX's apparent short term cash needs allow a proper
preservation?


Given that the Fifth Third $10mm credit line only can be tapped against artifacts
recovered, how will the balance of preservation and rapid recovery given the cash burn be
balanced to preserve the site?


OMEX converted the Neptune $500k note from Q3 2013 - How did it determine a fair
conversion ratio?


The 10Q mentions that during April 2014, OMEX converted to Class A voting shares at
$12.00/share which is higher than the $10.00 per share (+150% liquidity preference) that
Neptune was attempting to raise capital at around the same time. Why did OMEX appear
to get a much worse deal than smaller, arms-length investors?


Why has OMEX not filed a NI 43-101 Report as Other Mining Companies Do?


It is well known that the gross tonnage of resources, particularly for something as low
value as phosphate (~$105/tonne) is a very small piece of the economic value. The level
of impurities that need to be removed; infrastructure; processing costs, environmental
impact, etc. all need to be considered whether something has a positive economic value
at current commodity prices. Why has OMEX chosen not to file this information for
shareholders at this time and when does it intend to do so?


When will you provide more details on the "Commodity Wreck Program"?


Language from the previous 10-Q has been changed substantially indicating further
delays. When will shareholders receive more information?


10-Q Filed Nov 2013 (when the SS Central America was already in the works according to
the current press release):


If the testing of the new ROV is successful in the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect to
perform reconnaissance and salvage planning trips to one or more commodity shipwrecks
in the first half of 2014.


Current 10-Q:


Depending on the availability of recovery ships, expert off-shore project managers, and
equipment, we plan on pursuing further commodity shipwrecks in the near and medium
term.

Meson,


Per your article, Fifth Third is valuing the coins at $2000 each and the Bars at 50% market value. These valuations
are for collateral purposes, not actual valuations or appraisals of the coins and bars. Banks have to protect their
business interests and loan collateral is always valued by the bank by about half its real value just in case of a default.
Then the bank knows for sure they can easily recover any unpaid loan balance. OMEX's track record with Fifth Third
over many years shows that Odyssey has ALWAYS paid back their loan obligations with this bank and taken back
possession of their collateral.


OMEX has sufficient cash on hand to cover their current short term obligations and new revenue from the Central
America is literally forthcoming shortly.

Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Ship1 - No disagreement on this topic, in the article it clearly says this is the collateral
advance value. This will be the cash they can access in the short term: 
1) If they recover some gold and  
2) After it is appraised


Sales proceeds will take quite a bit longer and they get a portion of (not 100%) per their contract. 
Unclear what your statement "OMEX has sufficient cash on hand to cover their current short term obligations"
is based on? The math seems pretty clear that this is false unless there is something you know that is not
stated publicly in the 10-Q?

Author’s reply »  Yes, they can probably borrow $400k against it (estimated based on the collateral advance
note) BUT they have to FIRST put up $500k to fill the interest collateral cash account. So I would estimate
they do not have access to net cash today on the line as of today.


13 May 2014, 09:40 AM

I don't believe they will appraise the bars at melt value. I think it's reasonable to assume 2-3x.

Author’s reply »  I was impressed. I wish they answered the one about the Convertible note about what
happened to it after March 31... How much was converted to stock (at least 800k shares??) vs cash


13 May 2014, 11:37 AM


Dart
Just a thought. I am sure they did convert with equity or they would have said they did not. However, given
your position on the stock and stock price, that being that it is highly overvalued (target price 0 I believe) that
wouldn't using equity to pay down debt be a good thing. We can both agree when a company's equity is over
valued it is a terrific currency for the company correct? thoughts?


14 May 2014, 10:00 AM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The part about the cash vs equity paydown for debt is two issues: 
1) Paying it down with equity includes a 15% discount to the closing price (in the 10-Q) so if the stock was at
$2, it's effectively selling stock at $1.70/sh... 
2) They DID pay it off in cash through March 31 and indicated on previous calls that they would pay the whole
thing in cash - so why the change of course?


So they changed course to pay off the note in equity at a 15% discount instead of cash (at a 0% discount of
course) after March 31... That does not seem to speak well to the cash position post March 31?

A call to all fervent OMEX supporters - before you spend your valuable time attempting to bash the credibility of
Meson Capital and weigh in on why you think this next recovery mission will be the one you've been gambling on
(despite OMEX's long history of blunders), spend some time reading the 10Q and forming an argument regarding the
dire cash situation laid out above. OMEX clearly will need to raise more capital, as highlighted in the Q, and has
limited options. 1) Debt funding is obviously tough to come by, given the stringent terms of the Fifth Third loan; 2)
Tapping the public markets is an option, but will come at a significant discount to market and will dilute shareholders
even further; and 3) OMEX could also continue to sell ownership stakes in its subsidiaries, though based on the
diligent effort of Meson Capital, the valuations and interminglings with OMEX execs are beyond questionable. What's
comical is that its not even worth mentioning funding cash flow through operations as a possibility, given the long
history of significant losses. Based on the LTM rev multiple of 7.8x at yesterday's close, its amazing that OMEX's
historical performance and current cash situation allow the stock to command a higher market multiple than even
most all high-flying SaaS companies!

The short sellers must really be getting desperate! Two Meson articles in ten days!  
OMEX having scooped up "nearly1000 oz" of gold in two hours, is already ahead on the loan proceeds. At the rates
noted, 7700 ounces of gold will obtain the whole $5 mil loan. At 500 ounces recovered per hour, looks like 16 hours
work. (OK, that may be somewhat optimistic.)


Site mapping? All you need is to "fly" the ROV over the wreck and record pictures. The ship is 300' long. With the
ROV moving at 3 mph, it should take one and a half minutes to make a pass and turn around. Fifty feet wide, ten feet
coverage per pass, what's that, 10 minutes?


The short position is now 30% of the float, at 20 million shares. No one is going to sell now until we see some results
this summer. The brokers these shorts use had better have their current financial reports and be checking them twice.
For the short seller, the potential gain is $2, the potential loss upward of $10 per share. Some of these shorts have
held their position for years. Someone is letting his ego make his financial decisions.


The pinnacle of salvage operations is just lying there waiting, HMS Victory.

This is False, they have to first put up $500k of their own cash as collateral.

The $500k is drawn from the loan, not paid in cash.

"the potential loss upward of $10 per share"


How is there a potential $10/share loss for shorts when the company has never made any money over the
course of the past ~20 years, nor has any realistic hope of making money in the future?

Meson,


I do not have any inside information. It's my opinion based on their past ability to continue to operate, which they have
been successful and expect they will continue to do. They stated they're starting recovery ops and new revenue
should be forthcoming. Once that happens, they can always go back to fifth third and re-negotiate their credit facility
terms, which I expect they will do.

In their conference call today, available at http://bit.ly/1lu4lpv, OMEX management responded to this article noting that
OMEX has no concerns on meeting payroll. it also noted that this article's speculation on OMEX's cash on hand as of
May 13, 2014 is false. The cash on hand is well in excess of the numbers provided by this article.


Other points made during the conference:


The $10 million credit line applies not only to gold taken from the Central America, but from any shipwreck cargo
recovered by OMEX in the world.


OMEX management also noted that there are several budgets for OMEX. None of these budgets will require an
equity raise using OMEX stock for operations in 2014. There is sufficient cash and other nondilutive financing to cover
all projects for 2014.


OMEX will be able to do proper archaeological work on the CA shipwreck. The predisturbance survey has already
been completed. The next step is to recover valuable artifacts visible on the surface. It is a good assumption that
OMEX is now recovering the gold and other valuable artifacts that are visible on the ocean floor.


There is no NI43-101 report filed because it is a Canadian document required for stocks listed on the Canadian stock
exchanges. The SEC does not allow the NI43-101 report to be included in standard filings. Nonetheless, OMEX has
chosen to comply with those standards in its preliminary report. This report is reviewed by a qualified independent
person in accordance with NI43-101 standards.


I would encourage all OMEX investors to pay close attention to this conference call.

"I would encourage all OMEX investors to pay close attention to this conference call"


If you listened closely to the call, they were quite vague on exactly how they would raise cash (if necessary).
They said one option is that they could "sell equipment" - huh? Don't they need their equipment to, like, run
the business? Sounds like burning the furniture to heat the house.


Also note the following statement from the 10-Q (doesn't sound much like the cheery message delivered on
their call today):


One or more of the planned shipwreck or mining project monetizations, financings, syndications or
partnership opportunities may not be realized which may require us to curtail our desired business plan until
we generate additional cash. We can offer no assurance any of our planned projects will be successful in
providing additional cash during 2014. We have experienced several years of net losses. Our capacity to
generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing
shipwrecks, monetizing our interests in mineral exploration entities, generating income from shipwreck or

some of our stake in our mineral exploration shareholdings, recover and monetize cargo from the SS Central
America, and generate cash inflows from other projects and opportunities. If cash inflow is not sufficient to
meet our desired projected business plan requirements, we will be required to follow our contingency
business plan which is based on curtailed expenses and requires less new cash inflows. While we have been
successful in generating cash inflows and raising the necessary funds in the past, there can be no assurance
that we can continue to do so in 2014.

Very similar statements have been made in the Trends and Uncertainties section of OMEX 10Qs and 10Ks
going back to at least 2009. These cautionary statements, which basically say that, due to circumstances that
are unpredictable or beyond their control, no company can guarantee their plans will come to fruition, are
routine in such SEC filings.

OMEX et. al. want to make money, easily, since you already have the equipment and diving expertise....well what the
hell is wrong with sucking up gold from the most northern shores of Alaska, as shown in the reality show ' Bearing
Sea Gold'?? Most of that subsurface placer was deposited and 'washed' or concentrated by several hundred years of
tides, concentrating the gold in one spot where it was deposited hundreds of years ago.


Glaciers have been melting for hundreds of years along Alaska's northern shores...although the largest glacial
deposits seem to be within the confines of the NOME peninsula, surely there are other similar 'lodes' along the coast
from other historic glacial movements and melting.


Why not construct a complete manned underwater system to extract that gold so that you won't be subject to above
water weather conditions, especially winter ice coverage. Seems like a no brainer to me. A good season or two would
provide the cash to 'repay' patient and deserving/supporting share holders and bond holders, not to mention
increasing the value of those shares so that we also may make a profit for a change...hell you can't take it with you,
so why not share the spoils with all those other greedy bastards out here like me ( I bought in at 7.30/sh...seems like
we'll never see that share price again....but may be possible, if you could put a successful ' Alaska ' program together.
Also, before I forget, using a metal detection unit along the ocean floor, would save lots of time or at least maximize
the time you do spend buy allowing you to concentrate on a known 'richer' site. MO

A gift from the Shorts! With presentation today of an article by an acknowledged short seller, which probably few had
read and fewer believed, the shorts dumped stock at the open driving the price below $2, where the stop loss orders
waited. The selling fed on itself, driving prices lower. We see capitulation here, 4.5 million shares traded with price
down 25%. Capitulation usually results in a V-bottom. A double or triple bottom here is unlikely. Margin calls went out
today, so more stock will be sold at Wednesday's open. That may be the low.

Ask yourself, why would the shorts drive down the price before today's Conference Call and before SS CA salvage
even starts? Why not wait until the salvage fails? Perhaps they see this is their last chance before good news
appears.


There was a lot of positive news in today's Conference Call. The most noteworthy, imo, was a potential Go decision
on salvaging HMS Victory this fall. Contemporary news accounts of her sinking estimated 4 tons of coins aboard. This
would amount to over 500,000 quarter-ounce coins. How much would a gold coin which has been underwater 260
years, recovered from one of history's most famous ships, sell for?


13 May 2014, 06:57 PM

Bill,


The gold that is possibly on Victory is likely gold moeda coins according to Neil Cunningham Dobson. They trade at
about 1.75 times gold value. They don't have alot of numismatic value like rarer US coins and bars on the CA, but
hey.......gold is gold.

Shipbuilder1 - Moeda was a new term for me, had to look up the definition, which says it's a gov't token rather
than a coin? I have no insight into what people used for money in 1740. If they were Portuguese tokens,
would they be useful in England? Seems like the merchants would have converted their earnings into coin of
the realm of England.

Bill H...back in the day...England dominated trade with Lisbon and gold from Minas Gerais in Brazil became
the most utilized currency in the British realm. Look up "bits of eight" and you'll find that what you call a
"token" was part of the currency mix of the day...so long as it was gold! If you look at the range of varieties
coins that played off of gold from Brazil in the 1740's, the values are a wide range much higher than 1.75x
melt (likely low end of the quality range) depending on the specifics of size, quality and origin. We will likely
find that the 2015 value of any Vic currency, due to its provenance, is greater in the Brazilian nouveau riche
market (and Europe) than the US.

I sold my small position years ago, because I disapproved of Stemm's management, I thought his decisions were bad.
But mostly I thought Stemm ran OMEX like his personal piggy bank without regard for shareholders.


At the time, because they were out of options for selling more shares, OMEX was financing their explorations using
outside investors to pay up front for a return off the top. This meant those non-shareholders got paid first and there

My guess is that Stemm will survive to continue ripping off shareholders. There are always plenty of people to invest
for the glamour and allure of gold. But I have doubts that OMEX shares will ever be worth much.

Bill/Papa,


Based on what i see on trading activity on OMEX, the shorts are not done with the stock yet. They know that CA gold
news will come out on the wires which will move the stock, but they also know that no news will probably be
forthcoming for at least 3-4 weeks and maybe a little longer.


Here's my take based on what happened the last time OMEX was shorted to death about 3 or 4 years ago. The
shorts pushed it down to a low of 97 Cents a share. From there, the stock price marched back up over the next year
to about $2.50 a share. It took a year because at that time Odyssey had no impending projects and little to stimulate
investor excitement for shipwreck recoveries or revenue.


It's different this time, and the shorts know it. the CA contract was an unexpected development for the shorts which no
one knew anything about when they started their short attack last year. Now they have had to change strategy
because effectively, the CA contract filled the void of the potential Victory recovery, and added a bonus which is that
everyone now knows there is in fact gold on the CA site and the site has not been disturbed. This has not been
determined on the Victory site yet, which is why the CA news is much better for longs.......we know there's gold down
there. The shorts have a very limited time frame to short the stock down, and then get out.


Now, the shorts know gold is going to come up from the CA, and even if it's a smaller amount than we would like, it
will certainly move the stock into the 2 dollars range or higher, because it still represents revenue to Odyssey and for
investors on the fence, the revenue infusion will convince them that the short reports of OMEX's impending death
were in fact greatly exaggerated.


There is an outstanding opportunity for OMEX investors with dry powder, to realize a very handsome profit in a very
short time........and oddly enough thanks to the shorts. You have to set your own buy in levels. I've set mine, and when
the stock goes there, I'll be going in fast and furious.


This is a spectacular opportunity for profit, but like so many other opportunities, timing is everything.

than most I have read.


If they had been a little luckier and hit the G spot the summer before last instead of temporarily whiffing in late
summer 2012, they would be well into the turnaround right now....but what happened happened. Old news


In a message to me, another OMEX investor made the apt point the other day that managers front running
the Russell index rebalance might have something to do with the bear volume last week. I believe the list will
hit on June 13th, but the market anticipates such stuff of course. There will be a hefty amount of automatic
selling off of the index.


I have purchased all I intend to purchase right now....and while eventual outcomes have fortunately and
usually been good for me my timing often sucks to some degree. I plan to hold for at least a year.....I never
use margin so I would have to sell other stocks I like to buy more OMEX and I am and will be reluctant to do
that


Again you may have the right idea, Ship. Obviously we'll see....Good Luck to Ya!

The ' Honest ' mind's reality is great either way because it assesses the truth regardless of whether it is a positive or
negative truth. Same is true of Shipbuilder 1 comments above, regarding the potential for shareholders to be
rewarded as a result of the CA project. His stated expectations are a reasonable conclusion from an honest mans
perspective...under the circumstances. But...


Unfortunately, as they usually do, OMEX will find a way to 'flush' the profits into 'paying' old bills, phoney debts and
other causes before any shareholders see appropriate results from the 'CA find.' . It seems obvious to me that as far
as OMEX management is concerned shareholders are to be treated as any other poker player across the table from
OMEX's seat at the table.... ' you takes your chances, no one forced you to 'play the game', so you get what you
get...if you're lucky...and we owe you nothing unless we're forced to.'

Another aspect of the huge short position in OMEX stock is the dilution it causes. To short stock, the short seller must
borrow stock from a broker, stock owned by someone else. The short seller sells the stock he borrowed to a buyer, so
now two people own the same stock, and the effective number of shares outstanding has increased by the amount
sold short.


There are roughly 83 million shares of OMEX outstanding, 75 million constituting the "float", or shares readily
available to trade, and 20 million sold short. These 20 million are held by buyers who think they own stock, but in
reality those shares are already owned by someone else. The float is effectively 95 million shares. It is as if OMEX
issued an additional 20 million shares, which diluted the stock of the company by 25%. That alone should cause the
price to drop 25%. If the stock would otherwise be at $2.00, the extra shares created by selling short 20 million would
mathematically put the price at $1.60 per share.


The reverse is true, also. When the shorts buy to cover their sales, it is the same effect as if OMEX instituted a "buy
back" program to retire 20 million shares. It would mathematically cause the price to rise from $1.60 to $2.00 per
share. This is in addition to any price increase due to the increased Demand.


You can see the powerful pressures on these short sellers, especially if OMEX has a better than expected salvage
operation. Not only is there the possibility of large earnings, the short sellers would be sorely pressed.


Nothing is certain, but the risk-reward ratio for OMEX looks pretty good to me!

I have been following OMEX for a while. These levels seem like a gift if you are wrong (even just in the short
term about their liquidity). If and when they draw down on the loan, the stock should rocket - it will be a huge

I don't think you understand how bank underwriting works. They do not make loans to stay undrawn. They make
money from drawn loans that are current. The 10q says the note was paid in cash during the quarter. You are
speculating that shares were issued after the quarter to pay of the remaining note.

You will have to ask the company. They have issued shares for various purposes over time. I know the 10q very

In my mind the fifth third loan is a huge validation of what they are trying to do and should be hugely beneficial to
common equity. A real securitized loan against recoveries in their core business. They will also get an 80% advance
of the first recoveries to get back their costs which should rapidly satisfy their cash needs. You are taking what appear
to be positive events and painting them as negative. I wonder if you are covering on this "news" ?

Dante - you need to avoid OMEX, IMO - this company is decidedly NOT shareholder friendly (as opposed to
Ullman, who actually cares about his shareholders, buys stock on the open market, etc). If you look at the
past 20 years, you see what the track record for this mgmt is - and it's not pretty. GLTY.

Blue Ridge - You may be a bit overly-critical on OMEX. There is not much management can do for
shareholders until the company makes a profit. Would the company have operated differently had they been
able to keep the 17 tons of Black Swan silver coins? Who would have predicted that Hillary's State Dept
would take the side of Spain in the court case, so she could repay a large contributor to the Democrats?


This is the world's premier deep sea salvage company. They employ men of different character than those
who sell soap, or those who make bear raids on small companies. Stockholders will prosper when salvages
are successful. With the short position in the stock, a really successful salvage will create really succesful
stockholders. Patience -

From 8K: $8mm today = min $800k restricted cash => $7.2mm unrestricted 
-4.8mm added from line


=3.4mm cash including at least 300k restricted cash  
= 3.1mm unrestricted cash before line drawn.


I estimated 3.27mm for unrestricted cash in my article as an optimistic number, it appears the true number was just
BELOW this (CFO said "WELL IN EXCESSS" of our estimate which appears false). Payables balance was probably
increased as well vs mar 31 2014.


This appears to confirm that they did convert all of the converts to stock post mar 31 NOT cash, so there are an extra
~1.3mm shares out vs march 31 today.


They have 7.2mm of unrestricted cash and no ability to monetize the $9.6mm of cargo they brought up anytime soon
since they don't have title. 
So 7.2mm of cash, burning ~700k-1mm/week = 7-10 weeks max left to go... Which is around when we predicted
(July) that they run dry/aground on cash.

Certainly focus on the trees and not the forest!


How soon until they draw the remaining $5.2M? After all, given the slow archaeological methods employed, it
is not at all unreasonable to assume that the draw announced with this 8K represents a bulk of recoveries
that all laid on or just below the surface. One wonders if that Fifth Third contract has an escalation clause.
How anxious do you think they will be to further extend the instrument when OMEX has drawn 100% and
there are still months of excavation left? Even you are smart enough to know that collateralized debt is in a
whole different league than alternative funding. This predictable attempt at 'I told you so' is nothing more than
cries afoul as you are toppled from your soapbox.

Let's cut Meson some slack on their analysis of the debt re-structure and stock dilution. With their significant
expertise, they have recently guided another company in which they have active board participation (LEI) into a debt
package at 15% with warrant kickers and all fees paid. And this on top of a highly successful equity offering last
month, priced well above this week's trading range, and again with a long-dated warrants being issued. Seeing these
details has helped me to better understand Meson's perspective on the OMEX capital structure. You can't understand
pretty until you see ugly!


For another good perspective, a quick review of the latest SEC filings has an interesting comparison of legal
procedures between these same companies...one has disclosure of multiple lawsuits that look particularly nasty, while
OMEX has a one-liner in the latest 10Q. These type of contingencies are critical to any company bleeding cash and
so I hope that Meson will continue to diligently keep an eye out for legal exposures on behalf of the OMEX
shareholders.


All this and profits donated to charity...what an inspiration to budding CFA's everywhere! Almost makes me ashamed
to be long OMEX for personal gain.

These postings by Meson are getting tiresome. I haven't been a shareholder all that long so can understand the
impatience of long term investors. I will withhold further comment until I see positive results from their latest dive. If
they come up with even more than the first haul, Meson will scurry away and focus on some other short play
somewhere else. One thing I have learned by following Seeking Alpha contributors, most of the rantings talking down
a stock is for their own benefit.

Papa,


Good info. thanks. With the shares now trading at $1.37, there is going to be an inflection point soon. Shorts are
having more and more trouble borrowing shares since institutions own 40M shares, plus there are 20M shares
already sold short. That accounts for 60M shares. Plus Mr. Uziel's makes 64.6M shares which are all basically
untouchable by the shorts (my opinion). The entire float is only 83M shares. The stock will probably continue to go
down slowly until any specific news of gold quantity recovery comes out. Another potential OMEX stock mover will be
if any filings come out that indicate OMEX has borrowed more money, gotten VC capital infusion, extended credit
lines, etc. We all know there will be more gold coming up and I'm positioned sufficiently in the stock that whenever the
gold numbers start looking good and the stock moves higher, I'll be in the money. But as it continues to go down, I'm
systematically adding to my OMEX position. Though I'm not expecting it, if the recovery news which comes out some
time this summer looks anything like "OMEX recovers xxx tons of gold"....... I'll be headed into retirement. Even if it's
not tons of gold, but some reasonable expected amount based on the receivers experts opinions on how much is left
down there, we will still all do very well.


I think the market has ignored the fact that it is now known that the site has been undisturbed since TT left in the early
1990's which means no pillaging of remaining gold has occurred. I think the market has not taken into account that
Odyssey is being compensated for at least some of the costs of their recovery efforts, just that the amount has not
been made public. I also think that the market has forgotten that there are other valuable artifacts down there besides
gold, which OMEX has every intention of recovering and monetizing in some way. So even if the recovery is not tons
of gold, but the expected many hundreds of pounds of gold coin and bars, OMEX should still realize decent revenue
from the CA recovery.


I've been able to solidly identify through mint records and other sources that at least another $100,000 in face value
coin was paid to people who ended up on the Central America.......that's over and above the documented 1.6M
commercial gold shipment which most of that was recovered by TT. But for sure, there is also some of that
commercial shipment of gold that he missed or could not get to due to limitations is his ROVE technology, or that it
was not visible and/or hidden. Bottom line is that when this info begins to come out, investors will realize OMEX stock
in the $1.00 to $1.40 range is making the assumption that there will be virtually no gold recovered from CA, no capital
or lending available to OMEX, and I don't see either of these scenarios as plausible. Meson keeps harping on that
OMEX will not be able monetize their gold in time to stay solvent, but I don't buy that argument. If OMEX has x-
millions of gold from the CA recovery which takes some time for them to take possession of, and monetize, I seriously

doubt that they are going to have to resort to going to some lender or VC entity with their hat in their hands and say,
"We have a contract with the court receiver and will be taking possession of x-millions of dollars in gold......can you
lend a few sheckels? They are seasoned at raising capital even when they don't have impending collateral to back
them up. I believe that this summer of 2014 will be the real "Summer of Opportunity" for OMEX and we shareholders.

That is one thing they have indeed done very well, Ship. Here's to the day when they no longer have to

Appreciate your research and thoughts. And I am an OMEX long....


I do believe you should factor in the effects of Russell delisting in your price calculations.


The actual index fund selling of delisted stocks like OMEX is usually very gradual with each stock and does
not begin (I think) until aftermarket June 30th....but there is always anticipatory selling (and shorting) by some
other people and funds and we have probably already seen that in action. What percentage still to come is
hard to say. Some have also probably been accumulating.


Any such selling can always be offset by powerful positive news.....we'll see....interesting summer for sure

Hey Papa ... timely find of the 13G. Last night I confirmed that the filer is an MD of Perry Capital. Now that must have
sent a shiver down the back of every short in OMEX. I've known them for years and these guys are mavericks who
love the type of catalysts at play in OMEX. Major positions are AIG and Herbalife...OMEX is a rounding error for them.
It will be amusing to see what Meson comes up with to try and save their sinking ship! They'll soon be needing the
services of a good shipwreck recovery company...who can they call?


So Shipbuilder, your notion that the share price will continue to fall in the week(s) ahead is much less likely since
4.7mm shares is hardly a real position for Perry. Helps to explain the floor that has been forming under the stock
price. I have found it harder/impossible to get anyone to chase my low-ball bids lately or fill option orders.

Simply a matter of capitalization, Ship. The last trading day for determining inclusion was yesterday. The still fairly
recent very sharp decline in price was the sole determinant. I'll leave it to you to assess all the elements that drove
that decline....


Definitely a "short" term win for one interested group....

The rty boot is pure market cap issue, but yes its does help the shorts cover and puts pressure on the shares. It
doesn't change the fundamentals and we shall see if bears are right on this topic as they just drew down on the line
that wasn't supposed to be available to them according to the bears.

Ori did pretty well when he bought 5 million shares (5%) in real estate company iStar $STAR when it was trading at
$2 near its all time low. It recently hit $15 and his most recent filing showed he still owned 3.5 million shares. Looks

like he called that bottom with amazing accuracy. Nice chart: http://goo.gl/kIJrq0


Wonder if he got the OMEX idea from Blackrock which is also a significant holder in iStar and OMEX

Meson, whats your take on the few gold coins they did recover? Does it call into question your thesis that there was
no extra gold/rogue salvagers would have removed it. I am skeptical of the company too and am short. Thanks for the
excellent work you did on this.

Author’s reply »  We expected there would be some scraps left over and weren't surprised, the problem is
that the costs are so high that it seems unlikely the project will be economic but we will see. Zero chance it's a
homerun, maybe best case they are ahead of their costs by a few $mm... A key problem is that they won't be
able to monetize the treasure for some time as it is in the hands of the receiver and best case is end of this
year while they burn cash on overhead and appear to have no other prospects for revenue.


The whole Army gold homerun thesis is nonsense as we detailed in our report, it's based on a vague
fabricated document marked "Classified" from before the US started even using that term after WWII.

Guys,


I personally like to do my own due diligence on the issues surrounding any given stock. I've completed my DD pretty
thoroughly on the potential Gold left at the CA site. For certain, there are many unknowns. But there are some facts
and high probability speculations from which we can draw reasonable conclusions about what Odyssey Marine might
recover from the site, and if the recovery will yield them substantial revenue.


First, on the Army gold, I simply can't make an informed determination without seeing the government letter being
cited. It certainly has generated alot of speculation, but in the final analysis, No one can say definitely whether the
army gold is there or not until the recovery is completed. So with that, my due diligence tells me to assume that it's not
there.


Second, there are some irrefutable facts that must be considered about what treasure is left on the site. One fact is
that mint records do not lie. I have researched and found the names of dozens of people who were on the passenger
manifest for the Central America, who had also been paid varying sums of money from the US Mint in San Francisco
in a 10 day period just before they departed California for Panama, to board the CA. I've found about $100,000 dollars
that was paid to these various individuals which they were taking that money with them on their trip East. Another fact
we recently learned was that Odysseys assessment of the CA site shows that it has not been disturbed since Tommy
T last visited it in the early 1990's......ergo, any gold and artifacts that were left unrecovered by Tommy T, are still
there on the site. These are two very important facts. There is another piece of information that is also a fact. The

original recovery groups chief historian (Bob Evans) was with Tommy T many times on the CA site and saw first hand
at least some of the treasures, gold and artifacts that remained according to his statements. Though he does not go
into specifics about what exactly is still there, he was one of the courts experts who weighed in on the estimates of
how much gold might still be on the site, which going by what I've read, those experts have estimated in a range of
$350,000 to $1.2 million dollars in specie, presumable most in 20 dollar gold pieces.


My due diligence leans toward the low end......maybe even a little less. I'm basing my opinion on several factors,
some of which are facts, and one is a reasonable assertion. There was definitely $100,000 in passenger money
according to mint records. Since OMEX already brought up some gold assay bars which should have been from the
$1.6 million of the commerical documented gold shipment, this tells me that TT did not recover 100% of the $1.6M
commercial gold shipment. Here, I'll make an educated guess and say that he missed possibly 10% or $160,000 in
gold bars and gold coins. that makes $260,000 in 1857 face value gold. From the standpoint of being conservative, I'll
stop right there and say my DD tells me there may be another 260K on the site. For arguments sake, if the entire
amount is in 20 dollars gold coins, that equates to 13000 coins, however, we know some will be bars. This is really a
bare low end estimate. It also does not take into account other artifacts that may be recovered and have value. It also
does not take into account that any of those gold coins may be exceedingly rare dates (There are quite a few very
rare date gold coins from 1850 to 1857). And if any more of the exceedingly rare coins still exist, an undisturbed
shipwreck site is where they will be found. Now, I'm not saying that any exceedingly rare date coins will be recovered,
but the notion cannot be dismissed, and I'll use the the first recovery of the CA as an example. prior to TT gold
recoveries in the late 80's to early 90's, Mint State 1857-S 20 dollar gold pieces were very rare. Since he found so
many, now they are about as common as most of the other S mint 20 dollar gold pieces.


I will say that Meson had brought up a point in one of their previous articles that it was possible that many people who
survived were actually able to get their gold money and take it with them on the lifeboats. This is a conjecture that
cannot be proven one way or another, however, I will cite Green River's research that indicates that the rescued
passengers could not even come up with the few hundred dollars to pay the rescue ship captain for his services. If
they had managed to take a substantial amount of money with them, I'm sure the money would have been gladly paid
on the spot. However, none of this can I attribute as fact, so this one we have to leave it to interpretation. My personal
interpretation is that the passengers were not able to take much money with them. Certainly, any passengers who had
entrusted there money for safekeeping by the ships purser would not have had easy or ready access to it.


So, based on my own due diligence, If OMEX can recover most of what is left on the site, in today's numismatic
market, the gold bars and coins should be worth between $70M to $100M dollars. So we've been told that OMEX gets
80% up to a point (that point dollar value has not been disclosed publicly as far as know) and then 45% after that.
This means that even using my very conservative diligence, the total recovery could be worth $35M to $50M minus
their expenses which GS estimated at 10-20 Million dollars. To me, this represents an economical recovery and will
provide revenue which will keep OMEX in business as a going concern for the forseeable future. Then of course,
there are the potential unknown recoveries, which are not limited to the Army gold. It could be recovery of other
valuable artifacts, or recovery of coins that are exceedingly rare, or if they recover a private mint assay bar which
weighs more than 960 Ounces (That would then become the new largest gold numismatic assay bar in existence, and
would likely command much more than the $8M dollars previously paid for the 960 oz bar which was auctioned in the
1990's). All of these things remain possibilities that we all must factor into the potential CA recovery outcome.

As for OMEX running out of money, I can only point to the fact that Meson and others on this comment board have
stated that Odyssey is already beginning to tap their credit line with 5th Third Bank. So whatever the terms are
between OMEX and 5th Third, there seem to be provisions that OMEX does not have to physically have ownership of
the gold during the recovery period, I suppose since they have an ironclad contract with the court receiver that OMEX
will receive their gold and artifacts later this year, as recovery winds down. Borrowed money against future assets and
revenue is almost as good as the actual revenue coming in itself. My opinion is that OMEX will use this credit
arrangement to full advantage and remain in business using that credit facility until they can take possession of their
CA gold assets and monetize later this year.


So with all that said, I just wanted to give everyone the benefit of my own due diligence, facts, opinions, and
conclusions.


One last note. Of great significance to me is the fact that Bob Evans actually saw what was visibly left on the site
during his tenure with the original discovery group. I give high credence to the accounts and opinions of an individual
who was actually there and talked about what he saw, and rendered his opinions to the court receiver. Think about it.
HE ACTUALLY saw and knows to some degree what is left on the CA site. This is not guesswork or supposition. I
weigh his inputs and statements as fact. Effectively, he is an eyewitness to what gold and artifacts remain on the CA
site. And it's not just "a few scraps".

Your dd is much appreciated, Ship


(still long...braced for uncertain Russell delisting effects...not sure the preponderance of those has passed but
just do not know...though strikingly positive news on any of several fronts could easily counter the delisting)

shipbuilder1
Well Papa, we don't have long to wait. If the stock goes down much more due to non-fundamental factors such as
delisting from the Russell, I'll be buying more. Usually, when the maritime GPS watchers notice that the ship leaves
the site to come back for supplies and off load whatever has been recovered, you begin to see heavier speculation
and buying of the stock, even before any announcements of what was recovered.

Nice write-up Shipbuilder. I concur with many of your conclusions. Only an idiot would get into a lifeboat with gold on
their person in a raging hurricane. That said, passenger gold is likely to be scattered in small parcels and OMEX will
have their work cut out for them. However they do have the skills to succeed.

Thanks and I agree with you. But based on Bob Evans commentaries over the years of what he actually saw in
general,, there are still small piles here and there of concentrated gold. And even though i was trying to be ultra
conservative with the conclusions to my due diligence, my gut tells me there are just too many things and information
that have been lost to history that we can't know about, which portends there might be significantly more gold, silver,
treasures and artifacts. There is a reason why the courts experts estimated remaining down treasure in a range up to
$1.2M dollars. They probably have information that we don't know about to cause them to draw those conclusions.
That final story will be told over the next months as recoveries continue and are completed.
