AmTrust Financial Services: A House Of Cards?
Dec. 12, 2013 10:51 AM ET88 comments
by: The GeoTeam


We believe short sellers have the winning position in AmTrust Financial Services
(NASDAQ:AFSI). Owners of AFSI should take careful note of the discussions of
consolidation of earnings and valuation of assets that could result in large losses and
regulatory scrutiny for the company.


AFSI is a multinational insurance company headquartered in New York City that provides
specialty property and casualty insurance to small and medium businesses. AFSI's
primary business lines include worker's compensation, commercial automobile, general
liability, extended warranty, UK legal expense and Italian medical malpractice coverage.
The company also invests in life settlement contracts ("LSCs").


It seems suspicious that a company could take on so many different types of risk while
beating consensus estimates for 14 consecutive quarters. We find it difficult to believe that
AFSI could quickly enter areas where they had no previous experience and at such a
pace without ever missing a step. This has led us to take a deeper look into AFSI's books
and accounting. The SEC has been very active in investigating LSC investments (GWG
Holdings is now under investigation), and we think they will be very interested in AFSI's
valuation of LSCs and the reported profits from the LSC portfolio.


In addition to LSC-related mark to market gains, it appears that management is
ceding/sending losses to offshore captive reinsurance companies it has purchased since
2009, but not disclosing these losses in SEC financial statements as required.


We will show that AFSI appears to be inflating earnings/net equity via offshore
entities, making it difficult for regulators to see the complete picture and/or get accurate
information. We think that AFSI could be next in line to face regulatory scrutiny.


Summary of Findings


1. A cross section of public documents (AFSI SEC filings, Statutory financial filings by
AFSI subsidiaries and Credit Rating information) shows that AFSI appears to be
excluding losses of wholly-owned subsidiaries in its SEC filings


2. From 2009 to 2012 we believe that AFSI has not disclosed a total of $276.9
million in losses ceded to Luxembourg subsidiaries.

3. AFSI seems to be mismarking its LSCs by using egregiously aggressive assumptions
relative to peers despite lawsuit documents showing AFSI holds many policies which
are probably worthless.


4. Applying industry standard discount rates would result in an
impairment/markdown of $90-$135 million in AFSI LSCs.


5. These findings regarding AFSI's LCSs are especially troublesome since more than half
of the policies held by AFSI are of contracts where Phoenix Life Insurance,
(NYSE:PNX) (see footnote 1) is the issuing carrier / counterparty. Since PNX and/or
its subsidiaries are faced with possible bankruptcy, its ability to honor the payout on
these policies could be diminished and AFSI's expected collection on these contracts
would be even less than other comparable policies.


6. Press releases contain different accounts than those reported in SEC filings, leading
us to question the company's internal controls over financial reporting.


7. We conclude that AFSI is worth between $3.87 and $13.00 per share.


Additionally, AFSI CFO Ronald Pipoly & COO Michael Saxon were executive officers at
Credit General ("CGI"), a P&C insurance company that was liquidated in 2001 by the Ohio
insurance regulator after it was revealed that the CEO, Robert Lucia, had committed fraud
via related party offshore entities and stolen $30 million from the company.


Insurance Industry Is No Stranger to Fraud


The complexity of insurance accounting as well as the latitude management teams can
use in the accounting for certain items can make it difficult to detect fraudulent or risky
behavior. Mutual Benefit (private), EEA Life settlements Fund (private), Absolute Life
Solutions (once a public company), and Life Partners Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LPHI) are
examples of companies that had their feet in the toxic life settlement insurance sector and
whose accounting tricks eventually were detected. This led to a massive destruction of
investor capital.


Just recently, shares of Tower Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWGP) imploded shortly before and
after an August 7, 2013 announcement that the company was delaying its 10-Q to
reevaluate issues related to reserves, the integration of its Canopius Bermuda merger,
and its integration of goodwill and certain tax accounts. The events surrounding these
issues led to over $700 million in charges incurred upon TWGP and a credit rating
downgrade by insurance rating agency A.M. Best.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 3/41


In order to understand AFSI, it's important to comprehend its organizational structure,
summarized below:


The subsidiaries (or groups of subsidiaries and parent) in blue do not directly participate in
insurance underwriting. The subsidiaries (or groups of subsidiaries) in green are AFSI's
regulated insurance subsidiaries which can write policies directly. The subsidiaries (or
groups of subsidiaries) in red are "captive" reinsurance subsidiaries.


Regulatory and Accounting "Arbitrage"


A captive reinsurance company is wholly owned by an affiliated entity (in AFSI's case, the
parent) to insure the risks of its other insurance subsidiaries under the same corporate
umbrella. Captive reinsurance subsidiaries are used to shift profits to lower tax
jurisdictions or to reduce capital requirements. By using captives, they need to have fewer
reserves to pay out policy holders that need to collect, and can instead take more risk than
they otherwise could if they stayed at home.


Since AFSI voluntarily gave up the tax benefits associated with this structure (see
footnote 3), we guess the benefit for AFSI is capital-related. We believe AFSI is
interested in Bermuda in order to shield operations from the view of investors, regulators
and ratings agencies.


The Luxembourg Cookie Jar


AFSI uses an offshore captive reinsurer called AmTrust International Insurance ("All") in
Bermuda to off lay of more than half of its contracts. We believe it is doing this not only lay
off the risk, but to in effect hide the eventual losses from this risk. Under All sits a
Luxembourgian domicile captive insurer called ACHL. We believe AFSI is using this web
of subsidiaries to move bad policies and conceal losses. Here is a snapshot showing loss

and premium information from 2010 through 2012 comparing AFSI SEC financial
information to AM Best data and a statutory filing from (Schedule Y) of one of its wholly
owned subs, Technology Insurance Company ("TIC").


Table Items Defined: 
NPW = Net Premiums Written 
NPE = Net Premiums Earned 
Net L/LAE = Net Loss/Loss Adjusted Expense 
AEL = AFSI's UK subsidiary 
AIUL = AFSI's Irish subsidiary 
AII = AFSI's Bermuda subsidiary 
ACHL = AFSI's Luxembourg subsidiary 
TIC = One of AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries


Referencing the last column of the table above, we can see that AFSI is not consolidating
the losses ceded to ACHL (see footnote 4), but appears to be recognizing premiums
associated with those policies. As you can see, the 10-K reconciles when it comes to
premiums. But when it comes to recognizing losses, those do not appear to be present in
the 10-K. The mismatch approximates the losses being sent to Luxembourg, so it would
appear to us that AFSI is not recognizing certain losses in its SEC filings.


AIUL's 2009 AM Best report is not available, so we're unable to perform the same
exercise for 2009. We will revisit this table later in our report and also present evidence
that AFSI also did not consolidate losses into ACHL in 2009.


GAAP Accounting Shenanigans

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 5/41


We believe that AFSI is inappropriately taking advantage of differences between U.S.
GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP to create a cookie jar for earnings. In brief, AFSI's
Bermuda subsidiary ("AII Bermuda") "stuffs" losses into "ACHL", yet keeps the premiums.


Let's look at the clear evidence that has led us to conclude that AII Bermuda is ceding
losses to ACHL, and that the results reported to investors do not accurately portray this
fact.


In simple terms, we believe AFSI acquires shell companies that have built up
"equalization" balances for smoothing future earnings that are recognized in Luxembourg
GAAP, but not US GAAP (see footnote 5). Then AFSI appears to inappropriately
incorporate the results of Luxembourg entities under Luxembourg GAAP (which allows the
use of these smoothing balances) instead of what the results would have been under U.S.
GAAP (which does not allow the use of smoothing balances). Basically, Luxembourg
GAAP allows these smoothing balances to offset future losses vs. U.S. GAAP that
prohibits this practice specifically because these balances allow companies to avoid
reporting losses on financial statements. Thus, real losses AFSI is sending/"smoothing
out" in Luxembourg are not being reported in the results AFSI reports in its SEC filings.
We believe this is why AFSI has spent $730.9 million buying Luxembourg captives - it is
the key to being able to report steady profit growth.


Origin Luxembourg "Equalization" Balances


AFSI did not incur the equalization balances. Instead, they purchased entities that already
had the balances built up.


This all started in 2009 when AFSI bought Imagine Captive Holdings Limited
(subsequently renamed AmTrust Capital Holdings Limited or "ACHL"), a Luxembourg
holding company which owned three Luxembourg-domiciled captive insurance companies
("Luxembourg Captives"). They proceeded to purchase another 8 entities through 2012.
The full list is below:
5/23/2018 AmTrust Financial Services: A House Of Cards? - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 6/41


In total, AFSI paid $730.92 million to buy Luxembourg-domiciled entities that had
approximately $688 million (see footnote 6) of "equalization" balances.


We have no problem with AFSI's purchase of the entities as long as the parent company
is properly recognizing subsequent intra-company transactions appropriately under US
GAAP. However, we believe AFSI is not recognizing these intra-company losses correctly
-- most likely by mixing and matching Luxembourg GAAP and US GAAP.


In the following two sections we will show that magnitude of losses (that ACHL is
absorbing and clearly not disclosing) by comparing its financial statements presented in
SEC filings with the public filings of its subsidiaries. We will also show that ACHL is
receiving no premiums.


Proof That ACHL Received Zero Premiums


AII Bermuda's 2010 financial statements break out premiums assumed and premiums
ceded for 2009/2010, which we show below.

Proof That Losses Exist


Statutory filings of AII Bermuda


The statutory filings of AII Bermuda in 2010 (the only year they are publicly available)
show a mysterious $62.1 million dollars of losses being ceded to Luxembourg in
2010 and $31.8 million in 2009. The following are pictures from AII Bermuda regulatory
filings in 2009 and 2010:

The statutory filings of AFSI's wholly owned subsidiary, Technology Insurance Company,
confirm the AII Bermuda 2010 Financials disclosure - to the dollar. Specifically, the
following table shows that $62.1 million was sent to ACHL in 2010 which matches the net
loss ceded figure in the above table of AII Bermuda. We then present two additional tables
from TIC statutory filings showing that a total of $183 million of losses was ceded to
ACHL throughout 2011 and 2012.

Dipping into the Cookie Jar - Unconsolidated Losses


We are willing to accept that if the losses are being ceded, this is not necessarily a big
problem as long as AFSI reports those losses on the 10-K and consolidates them for US
GAAP purposes. However, they do not appear to be consolidated and so net income
appears to be overstated.


Not In the Net Loss Expense Line


The table below compares the AII Bermuda Financial statements for 2010 to the AM Best
report for AII Bermuda in 2010 and shows that AM Best is basing ratings on the AII
Bermuda financial statements:

statements, showing the data points:

Source: Filed by AII Bermuda


This confirms the validity of the AII Bermuda 2010 financial statements that show losses
being ceded to ACHL from AII Bermuda as AM Best does not recognize the losses ceded
to ACHL either. It also provides us with a consistent data source to compare the
subsidiaries' net earned premium and net loss and loss adjustment expense to the 10-K
since AM Best reports are available for AFSI's insurance subsidiaries (US Subsidiaries are
filed as a group) with the exception of ACHL.


However, since we can derive ACHL's results from the AII Bermuda 2010 Financial
statements and Schedule Y of AFSI's US Statutory subsidiaries' filings, we can check to
see if all net earned premiums and net loss and loss adjustment expenses are
consolidated in the 10-K. If it were being consolidated properly, the losses ceded to ACHL
would be present in the disclosed aggregated net loss numbers reported, yet they are not,
and they appear to be off by roughly the same amounts that are being sent to
Luxembourg.


The tables below are the result of that exercise for 2010, 2011, and 2012. AIUL's 2009 AM
Best report is not available, so we're unable to perform the same exercise for 2009. The
tables clearly show that AFSI is not consolidating the losses ceded to ACHL (see
footnote 7):

Table Items Defined: 
NPW = Net Premiums Written 
NPE = Net Premiums Earned 
Net L/LAE = Net Loss/Loss Adjusted Expense 
AEL = AFSI's UK subsidiary 
AIUL = AFSI's Irish subsidiary 
AII = AFSI's Bermuda subsidiary 
ACHL = AFSI's Luxembourg subsidiary 
TIC = One of AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries


Notice that Net Premiums Written ("NPW") , and Net Premiums Earned ("NPE") of
GroupSubs (US Subs, AEL, AIUL, AII, ACHL) for each year closely approximates the
consolidated 10-K disclosures, giving us comfort that no material entities are missing
when we try to back into the earned premium and loss numbers disclosed in the 10-K.


However, also note that Net loss and Loss Adjustment Expense (Net L/LAE) of the
GroupSubs, is $290 million higher than what is disclosed in the AFSI's 10-Ks, and that
$245 million of this discrepancy comes from ACHL. We are not choosing to believe
that AFSI got it right on premiums and wrong on losses. Thus, given the known data
points, we can only assume that AFSI did not disclose $245 million of ceded losses in its
SEC filed financials from 2010 to 2012.


Furthermore, adding the 2010 to 2012 ceded losses ($245 million) to ACHL
(Luxembourg) referenced in the above table to the losses ceded ($31.8 million) to ACHL
per AII Bermuda's statutory filing 2009 earlier in our report works out to about $276.9

million.


This comparison clearly indicates that the results AFSI reports to investors significantly
understate the loss expense (thereby significantly overstating income).


2010 Net Loss Reserves in 10-K Exclude ACHL


Thus far, we have primarily focused on income statement analysis to support our
conclusions. But we can also reference balance sheet items to show that AFSI is not
recognizing AII Luxembourg loss items, such as net loss reserves. Taking a look at ASFI's
2010 10-K, we can calculate net loss reserves from page F-3 (amounts in thousands):


[Loss and loss expense reserves ($1,263,537)] + [Reinsurance payable on paid losses
($11,343)] - [Reinsurance Recoverable ($775,432)] = $499,448.


Now, it appears that ACHL's net loss LAE reserves are not incorporated in AFSI's 10-K,
even though AII Bermuda has disclosed that ACHL has L/LAE has reserves of 93.975 in
its filings.


The reported loss reserves in the 10-K ($499.448 million) are different from the sum of
subsidiary loss reserves ($592.88 million) by the exact amount sitting at ACHL ($93.975
million). This is potentially a $93.43 million hole in the AFSI balance sheet. See below
from AII Bermuda financial statements:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 14/41


Using the same AM Best filings we have been using throughout our article, we can also
show that ACHL's net loss reserves appear to not be reflected in AFSI's 2010 10K. As one
would expect, since the premium earned ties out (as discussed earlier), unearned
premiums tie out between Am Best and 10k from the above table, it is revealing that net
loss reserves do not even closely match.


Information GAAP - Investors & Ratings agencies Need More Data Points to
Properly Assess Luxembourg Risk


We believe that the company is not recognizing the losses to make reported earnings look
better. This could also lead to downgrades from AM Best, as AM Best's ratings
assumptions use the net losses and loss adjustments that match unconsolidated
financials and therefore do not include the full financial results.


AFSI should provide additional Information regarding losses ceded to Luxembourg to the
public and ratings agencies. The financial data AM Best uses to assign a credit rating to
AFSI match what is in AFSI's 10-K, so it seems ACHL's losses are not part of the ratings
evaluation process (AFSI supplies AM Best with statutory filings).


Comparing the 2010 financial statements of AII Bermuda, which show ceded net losses to
ACHL of $62.1 million, with the 2010 AM Best report for AII Bermuda (see previously
discussed 'AM Best + ACHL Comparison to SEC Filings'), we see that the net loss &
loss adjustment expense of $249.5 million matches. Therefore, the net loss expense
shown in the AM Best report (appropriately based on their methodology) excludes the
losses of AII Bermuda's wholly owned subsidiary, ACHL, and only takes into account the
reported unconsolidated numbers.


Life Settlement Mismarking


AFSI appears to be boosting earnings and tangible book value by marking up its portfolio
of life settlement contracts ("LSCs"). LSC, net of non-controlling interest now represent
approximately 19% of AFSI's tangible book value. In valuing an LSC portfolio, the discount
rate and life expectancy ("LE") are the two most critical inputs. AFSI uses a 7.5% discount
rate to value its LSCs while peers use a rate approximately 20%. Applying industry
standard discount rates would result in a mark down of $90-135 million, or roughly 13-19%

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 15/41


of AFSI's tangible equity. Further, it appears that AFSI relies on internal estimates, only
considering third party estimates for the LE input (See 10-Q for the period ended
September 30, 2013, page 17). In contrast, best practice is to use third party estimates to
determine LE estimates and weight them towards the more conservative estimate. The
use of internal LE estimates has been a staple of past frauds in the LSC industry (notably,
Life Partners and Mutual Benefits).


AFSI has been revising down its LE assumptions, generating gains on its LSC portfolio.
Publicly traded peers are revising their LE assumptions higher (especially for the
premium-financed LSC paper that AFSI holds) (see footnote 8). Simply put, peers are
assuming people are living longer while AFSI assumes people are going to die sooner.
We are unaware of any reason why AFSI is taking a non-consensus view on lifespans of
Americans. It is possible that AFSI's policyholders en masse have decided to take up
smoking, skydiving, or ride motorcycles without their helmets, but given a diverse base of
people, this seems unlikely despite what AFSI management is asking the market to
believe if you accept its LSC valuations.


More than half of AFSI's LSC portfolio consists of contracts where Phoenix Life Insurance
is the issuing carrier/counterparty . Faced with possible bankruptcy, PNX has been
attempting to induce holders of its LSC paper to lapse on their policies by hiking premiums
& denying death benefits. Given the possibility that PNX death benefits will not be paid,
when PNX paper does trade, it trades for pennies on the dollar.


For example, Fortress described the market for Phoenix policies in a complaint filed
August, 2012 as follows:


"As a result of Defendants' anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct, there are very
few, if any, buyers who remain willing to purchase Phoenix life insurance policies on
the secondary market. Defendants' anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct, and
the resulting uncertainty it has created, has destroyed the value of Phoenix policies
and robbed policyholders of the once-precious ability to sell their policies in a
competitive market. The few buyers who do remain will only buy Phoenix policies at
severe discounts..."


Tiger Capital LLC, an AFSI sub, filed a lawsuit against Phoenix in 2012. In recent days,
Tiger Capital's court documents showed it held 136 Phoenix LSCs. In their third quarter
2013 10-Q, AFSI disclosed 81 of the policies it held are carried at "no value", including
those policies that have a negative NPV. This implies that a minimum 55 of the Phoenix

policies (136 minus 81) have been assigned value despite there being essentially no
buyers for these policies. Marking these LSCs to true market value would result in a
significant impairment.


AFSI suggests that marking its LSC book at $194 million is conservative; since this
represents a 17.7% IRR based on $795 million in future cash flows. But, if one were to
apply the same LE standard peers use, this $795 million would be lower since longer LEs
require more premiums to be paid before the death benefit is received. By shortening LE,
the policy holder gets to "double dip" by using fewer years in the present value calculation
and by assuming less premiums paid. The effect is not simply an adjustment based on
discount rate. The true amount of future net cash flows, calculated using peer
assumptions, then, would be closer to $439 million (after applying the reserves that,
essentially, make AFSI's LE methodology comparable with peers).


The peer group calculation would then be to discount the $439 million by 17.7% or more,
rather than the 7.5% discount rate AFSI uses. We estimate that AFSI's LSC would be
worth $90 - $135 million less if they used the same discount rate as peers based on their
disclosed sensitivity to changes in the discount rate assumption.


In fact, since Phoenix policies (they make up the policies in the LSC portfolio) trade at
cents on the dollar, an appropriate discount rate is probably 50-60%.


Finally, despite claiming to set reserves based on LEs calculated by outside data
providers, management does not address why its own LE assumptions have been falling
(generating portfolio gains) while peers, who rely on the same data providers, are revising
their LEs upward. As we said earlier, it could be that the people associated with contracts
owned by AFSI are becoming riskier.


See the below chart for a display of comparable companies and the discount rates they
use. Note that the one company, EEA LS Fund (Full Credibility) that uses a discount rate
assumption (10.0%) closest to AFSI's (7.5%) has been warned by its auditor Ernst &
Young, that the discount rate is "significantly lower than what would be used by
market participants in an arm's-length transaction":

We wonder what E&Y would have to say if they were to replace BDO as AFSI's auditor?


AFSI Disclosure Discrepancies


Amtrust frequently has discrepancies between the balance sheet items presented in press
releases and SEC filings. However, the adjustments made to the balance sheet have not
resulted in changes to Shareholders' Equity, Goodwill & Intangibles, or the Income
Statement items.


The discrepancies could have offsetting entries as appears to be the case in the first
quarter of 2009 where adjustments to assets and liabilities offset. Additionally, the press
release only includes certain line items, so there could be offsetting entries that we are
unable to see. However, there are other quarters where the magnitude of the discrepancy
is significant and likely explanations do not appear to offset the adjustment.

For example, in the fourth quarter of 2012 AFSI reported $47.1 million more premiums
receivable in the 10-K than in the press release (excerpts below), $4.37 million fewer total
assets and $4.84 million fewer loss reserves:

Sources for the three images above: Fourth quarter 2012 Press Release and 2012 10-K


An increase in premiums receivable should be offset by either:


1. a reduction in cash if the premium was thought to be collected but actually was not,
2. an increase in unearned premiums if additional premiums correspond to future


policies, or
3. a higher reported revenue.


However, none of these were the case. We question what other offsetting entry AFSI
made and why it was not accompanied by an explanation in the 10-K or an 8-K to correct
the press release if there was an error. How does $47 million simply appear and then
disappear? AFSI management needs to explain what happened.


Interestingly, David Einhorn (Greenlight Capital) had similar questions and concerns with
Lehman Brothers' disclosures:

"As you can see, the table in the 10-Q does not match the conference call. There is
no reasonable explanation as to how the numbers could move like this between the
conference call and the 10-Q. The values should be the same. If there was an
accounting error, I don't see how Lehman avoided filing an 8-K announcing the
mistake. Notably, the 10-Q changes somehow did not affect the income statement,
as there must have been offsetting adjustments somewhere in the financials."

Executive Team's Sketchy History


Several pieces of information make it difficult to put our trust in the AFSI management
Team.


Outright Fraud- Theft and Money Laundering


AFSI CFO Ronald Pipoly & COO Michael Saxon were executive officers at Credit General
("CGI"), a P&C insurance company that was liquidated in 2001 by the Ohio insurance
regulator after it was revealed that the CEO Robert Lucia had stolen $30 million from the
company. From Court documents:


"During this same period of time, Mr. Lucia, in breach of the duties of care and
loyalty that he owed to Credit General, diverted checks belonging to Credit General
into the Outside Accounts. Although the precise amounts so diverted are presently
not known, Plaintiff reasonably estimates that the amount so diverted exceeded $30
million."


Other members of the executive suite issued false financials to hide the theft. CFO Pipoly
was Controller of CGI at the time, & COO Saxon was Chief Claims Officer. Both men were
named as defendants in lawsuits (see here and here) brought by the Ohio Director of
Insurance, alleging they were actively involved in the cover-up. Here is a quote from the
relevant court filings:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 21/41


"Fazekash subsequently notified Pipoly that Lucia would be wiring a substantial
sum of money to CGIC and instructed Pipoly to account for the money as a
reduction of CGIC's commission expense. Pipoly understood that Lucia would be
wiring the money to follow through on Lucia's commitment to cease diverting
premium payments. Pipoly also understood that an accounting entry to reduce
commission expense would not be the appropriate way to account for
previously unrecorded premium payments."


In the years prior to liquidation, CGI reported incredible growth in premiums written, with a
focus on small company worker's comp (similar to AFSI). AmTrust, which entered into a
management agreement with CGI in 2000, was also sued by the Ohio Director of
Insurance.


Valuation/Conclusion:


Comparable publicly traded property & casualty insurance companies currently trade
between 1x to 1.5x tangible book value per share ("TBV"), yet at around $40 AFSI trades
at 4.7x TBV of $8.61 on a fully diluted basis. Even barring the issues we have
presented, AFSI appears massively overvalued.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 22/41


The bullish investors will try to justify this premium valuation by referencing AFSI's
"impressive" reported EPS growth and a P/E that is in-line with comparables. However,
once our findings become apparent the market may place little value on AFSI's
earnings and P/E and will instead focus on TBV.


Interestingly, the next highest P/TBV multiple belonged to a very good comparable to
AFSI, TWGP, until it blew up as a result of under-reserving. It now trades at a discount to
TBV. If we were to use a 1x to 1.5x AFSI's current stated TBV, the stock would be $8.50 to
$13 per share. If we are right about the hidden losses (a $276.9 million hit) and our LSC
over valuation (a $113 million mid-point hit) conclusions, it will be worth $3.87.

Footnotes:


 In 3Q13, AFSI held 272 total policies. The Tiger Capital lawsuit claimed that AFSI held
138 policies issued by Phoenix. So Phoenix is 50.7% of the portfolio.


 Derived from 2012 Technology Insurance Company Inc.'s Schedule Y, Part 1A "Detail of
Insurance Holding Company System"


 During 2012, AII made a section 953('d') election which means that AII is now treated as
a US corporation and included in AFSI's consolidated US tax return. AFSI maintains other
non-US subsidiaries for which profits are considered to be indefinitely invested offshore.


 Note that net premium written and net earned premium very closely approximate the
results reported in the 10-K, demonstrating that there are not any material operations that
are missing other than ACHL.


 Reference: Materials For The International Solvency And Accounting Standards Working
Group, April 2013


 Our estimate is derived from AFSI's purchase price allocation disclosures. DTLs
associated with Luxembourg acquisitions totaled $206.4m and AFSI disclosed that a 30%
tax rate is applied to equalization reserves acquired ($206.4m/30%).

Nice read on this. Their LS valuations (discount rate) have been supect for a while. As for Phoenix paper, its
worthless and ladened with potential litigation costs. As Fortress has discovered, litigating for yield is not a sound
business practice. 
One note of contention and semantics. ..Insurers in US cant go bankrupt, they become insolvent.

Point 5 above, that Phoenix insurance company is going bankrupt and they won't pay out on the policies
seems to be a completely incorrect? 
This is because, and C=correct me if I am wrong, but don't all 50 states have emergency funds set up to
protect life insurance policy holders in the event their life insurance company goes bankrupt, or, as you say,
insolvent? Don't licensed insuracne companies have to pay an annual fee into the pool so that if a company
goes out of business the life insuracne policies are honored? http://bit.ly/1bZL7WH

Furthermore, I am familiar with bogus investments on life settlement policies, see my article on Life Partners
predicting the eventual demise of Life Partners. 
However, life settlements can sometimes be a good investment. I looked at the information I could find on
amtrust's life settlements at the time they bought them, and they appeared to me to be of a high quality. 
Here, the author fails to provide any support, facts, reasoning or analysis to support his conclusions on the
value of Amtrusts life settlements. 
Amtrust is the customer or purchaser of the life settlements, so the author is mistaken to apply the industry
standards of companies that are in business to be sellers of the life settlements. 
Since, when i viewed them, it appeared that the life settlements purchased by Amtrust were of a high quality,

it makes sense that their marks would be higher, particular given that there is a lot of very low quality life
settlements out there like Life Partners. 
The author provides no specific analysis of the life settlements that Amtrust has purchased, so his
conclusions regarding that are of no value, and I assume the author would admit that he has made various
assumptions to reach his conclusions that he does not have any idea as to the truth or falsity of.

I am familiar with both AFSI and TWGP, AFSI is nothing like TWGP. In fact, AFSI, who acquires a lot of
insurance companies, had no interest in purchasing any of TWGP's business at extraordinary discounts in a

state guaranty association coverage varies from state to state and benefits are not provided in a uniform
fashion. Coverage is generally determined by the state of residency at the time of impairment or insolvency of
an insurance company.


Unlike PBGC coverage, which offers a maximum yearly guarantee based upon a number of factors, including
the age of the retiree , state guaranty associations limit their coverage to a lifetime coverage amount.
According to information published by NOLHGA insurance guaranty coverage limits as determined by the
retiree’s state of residence, are as follows:


● Eight states and one territory – AK, AZ, IN, MA, MS, MO, NH, NV and Puerto Rico – limit coverage for
annuity holders in case of a default or shortfall to a lifetime maximum of $100,000;  
● Twenty eight states – CA, CO, DE, HI, ID, IL, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MI, MN, MT, NE, NM, ND, OH, RI,
SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WV, WY – limit coverage for annuity holders in case of a default or shortfall to a
lifetime maximum of $250,000; 
● Ten states – AL, AR, FL, GA, NC, OK, OR, PA, SC, WI and the District of Columbia – limit coverage for
annuity holders in case of a default or shortfall to a lifetime maximum of $300,000; and 
● Just four states – CT, NJ, NY and WA – offer coverage for annuity holders in case of a default or shortfall of
a lifetime maximum of $500,000.


Most state guaranty associations are underfunded or unfunded, relying on future premium assessments to
fund unknown liabilities. State guaranty associations depend entirely upon contributions from their member
life insurance companies and there are limits to the amounts than any one guaranty association can assess
its members. Moreover, insolvent members are unlikely to contribute funds to a multistate insolvency. The
ability of the state guaranty associations to withstand the insolvency of a company the size of Phoenix is
completely uncertain and delays and reductions in benefit payments could result. Also, some guaranty
associations may not provide coverage to life settlement purchasers - this has not been tested to my
knowledge.

Despite state guaranty association coverage, at least two life insurance company insolvencies have thus far
resulted in over $1 Billion in losses to policy holders – Executive Life Insurance Company and Executive Life
Insurance Company of New York. Both of these insolvencies took decades to administer and caused
significant payment reductions and disruptions to policyholders. At least one state guaranty association
refused to contribute funds when they found evidence of a secondary market transaction.

BEA, I see your point, but the state guarantee associations (are not state run entities) leave people very short
on death benefits and cash values are annihilated within those resolutions. As for Phoenix paper, you'd be
hard pressed to find anyone willing to absorb any of it for more than a few pennies...sub 5 cents. PHX seems
to have been a major and willing underwriter of STOLI paper with what is thought to be the plan to disallow,
heavily discount the death benefit or rescind/void and retain premiums. Then again they have also played
some games on COI to prompt lapses. 
As you and I are aware, LS lends itself to plenty of accounting games as it has a horizon for comeuppance of
a good 5 plus years, plenty of time to shuffle. 
Another company you may find of interest to probe is SUND, Sundance Strategies. ....plenty of games just
starting there with deterministic modeling.

Got out quick after reading this. I apologize to investors for my previous bullish piece. http://seekingalpha.co... I was

I'm not short the stock and I lost money on my long position so I don't see how you can accuse me of foul

Thanks,


All things considered, I am okay. Major accusations of accounting manipulation and a huge stock movement
and I was able to get out at $35.70. I had 20% exposure and an average purchase price of $40.42, so it has a
-2.3% effect on my entire portfolio. It troubles me that I didn't pick up on this stuff but then again the analysts
that cover the company didn't either. Will be more skeptical next time when looking at a company that went
through financial crisis virtually unscathed.


12 Dec 2013, 03:42 PM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
I would also add that I am not sure that these accusations are true, but decided that the practical move to limit
inevitable further losses as the news got around would be to liquidate my position. Amtrust has denied foul
play in a press release issued about an hour ago http://bit.ly/Jc0b6R and if they can sufficiently prove that
Pipoly and Saxon were not involved in the CGI scandal, that the ceded losses are consolidated, and that the
LSCs are liquid and conservatively valued, then I will certainly consider getting back in at this much lower
price. Until then, the practical move in my opinion is to stay away.

If you were in my position selling at $35.70, and the charges did prove baseless, you could easily buy back

SA's business model does not make it feasible to thoroughly investigate the contents of each submitted
article. If the information in this article is accurate, it deserves to be Alpha-Rich. If it isn't, then of course it
shouldn't have been published. The editors took the midpoint by publishing it with no special distinction.


If you watch the news carefully tomorrow and in the days to follow and react quickly, you may be able to, but
even if not, I'd rather be out of the stock to avoid all that uncertainty.


Regardless, the outcome will be very interesting.

Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
well, you may have been right in the first place and be wrong now. There is no info provided about Pipoly and
Saxon, what is said is that they previously worked for a company where the CEO stole from the company.
There is no accusation that Pipoly or Saxon did anything wrong whatsoever, so that info is completely
irrelevant. 
Furthermore, the author does not state affirmatively that the ceded losses were not consolidated. The
presentation is contorted and difficult to follow and certainly does not appear conclusive at all. The author
effectively states that by using words like suspicious, it appears, we believe, instead of affirmatively stating
facts or factual conclusions. On the other hand, the company has affirmatively stated that all ceded losses are
consolidated.

There are plenty of books out there on the subject of detecting fraud, so ordering and reading those might be
useful to you. Generally, it takes doing due diligence till you are comfortable that those running the business
are honest and able, till you are comfortable that the numbers reported make sense and are reasonably
accurate, making sure you understand the business well, and so on. There is no magic answer, it us just a
combination of having the ability, doing the necessary work, and using common sense.

or in the WSJ, should be taken with a grain of salt.


What do you think drives animal spirits anyway? Facts and reason? Geezus. Repeat after me: "Greed and

Brian: 
When you invest in a stock with 30% of the float sold short; it should be a conviction pick and you should be
prepared for short attacks like this one and consider them buying opportunities.


13 Dec 2013, 11:07 PM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
You're right, but the circumstances were such (me getting the news quick) that I sort of anticipated shares
dropping further than where they were at the time, whether or not the claims were grounded. Complex
accounting issues not withstanding, it is a conviction buy for me. The company has consistently maintained
returns of ~35% on tangible equity and my model has shares worth about 60% more than where they are
now, give or take depending on how long I project the high profitability continues.


I got back in $1 lower than where I got out, less than I'd hoped for, but it'll have to do.

Brian: I didn't really understand the entire article, but it looks like geo is showing proof of financial
shenanigans.


If you believe that, then "The company has consistently maintained returns of ~35% on tangible equity" is
what the filings show, but is an accounting lie, and eventually it will implode on itself.


Or as Dave wisely suggested, if you are convinced that the company is legit, then unless a "short-attack" has
material new information for you to consider, then you can use that as a buying opportunity.


For your own sake, I suggest you figure out exactly which side you are on. 
Me? Until I fully understand the finances, I'm staying on the sidelines. (Also, shorting seems to require much
better time/dedication/risk-loss than being long as judged by some of einhorn,ackman, and other 2008 crash
shorts.)


15 Dec 2013, 07:19 AM


Brian Grosso, Contributor
Thanks voiper, I am definitively on the company's side at this point. I know that it is very easy for companies
to temporarily inflate profitability, but usually that comes back to bite them in the long run and is not
sustainable. AmTrust has been performing the way it is now for years. The fact that Geo speaks of a 7.5%
discount rate on the LSCs when just looking at the Q2 call and the 10-k I see 14%, doesn't help their
credibility much. The point about Pipoly and Saxon is a concern and I want that explained by the company.
Bronte Capital convinced me the ceded losses point was inaccurate and misunderstood.


Still young and learning but I think I handled this okay. I guess time will tell.

Buy the preferreds at $18. Yielding about 9.5%, par value $25. Much safer than the common and very good upside
potential. Even if the allegations are true, $400 million in write-downs, the company should be solvent.


12 Dec 2013, 01:59 PM


dave mckay
That's what I'm thinking too. Preferred stock dividend is not at risk until the common dividend gets eliminated.


12 Dec 2013, 02:23 PM


WKField
I agree as well, and did this via the Maiden Holdings end. The yield for MHNC was just shy of 9.5% at close
and even misaligned with the MHNA notes at that point. It will be interesting to follow how all this develops
going forward.


12 Dec 2013, 06:07 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Yes, it was hard to figure the authors math, where he alleged, without much basis, that AFSI reported $400
million more than it had, yet the author suggested the stock price should drop the market cap from close to $3
billion to something between about $280 million to about $1.2 billion. Very sloppy and speculative work all
around.


13 Dec 2013, 09:24 AM


Joe Eifrid, Contributor
MHNA, MNHC...Thanks for the ideas. Interesting that PNX's exchange traded debt, PFX, has a lower yield
(8.16%) and "junk" rating yet the author sees PNX faced with possible BK.


14 Dec 2013, 01:36 PM

I prefer the common, I think it is just as safe, with better upside.


21 Dec 2013, 10:52 PM

Who cares if it's a short attack if the allegations are true ? You don't sit around and watch your account evaporate
unless you're totally clueless. Geo does great work. If they say jump, you ask, "how high" ? You don't try and be a
hero, as you'll get run over like the bug you are in the grand scheme of things.

If PNX is facing bankruptcy, then why is the stock trading for $50 a share?


12 Dec 2013, 02:14 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Not only that, I thought everyone knew that insurance companies pay into a fund so that if an insurance
company goes bankrupt, there is money in the fund to pay the claims of the policy holders. So, why does the
author say the life settlements will be worthless if PNX is facing bankruptcy?


13 Dec 2013, 09:24 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Well, again, the author doesn't claim that PNX is facing bankruptcy, he says they are faced with "possible
bankruptcy", which means that they also are faced with possible no bankruptcy. Consequently, another
meaningless statement by the author that appears designed to create the conclusion in the mind of readers
like yourself that the author said PNX was going bankrupt, whereas the author really expressed no opinion as
to whether PNX was going bankrupt or not. 
Essentially, the whole article is like that. 
Since the author said little to nothing definitive, the author could write an article that was actually consistent
with the current article that said that it appears the life settlements are understated on the books and the
company may have overstated the ceded losses. The article would sound inconsistent, but would actually
being consistent because of the lack of definitiveness is virtually everything the author said. 
I could write an article saying AFSI may be worth $5 a share and another saying it may be worth $100 a
share. As long as I don't committ to either valuation, I am being consistent. 
The author should have waited till a definitive conclusion was reached, based on facts and reasoning, rather
than putting out an article that was based on unsupported assumptions and speculation, with no definitive
conclusions.

@BEA If all authors waited until a "definite conclusion was reached" then the entire financial news industry
would go out of business. "Definite conclusions" are always after the bell. Almost no investor makes decisions
based on "definite conclusions." What they demand instead is exactly the crap that we read here, except that
we want the crap to be so sophisticated and subtle that it can fool us well enough to make us feel good about
our speculative buying and selling.


I mean, what would happen to greed and fear, if the only information available to us was "definite
conclusions?" That's simply not how humans work. We thrive on speculation, rumor, opinion, bombast, and all
the rest of it. You would not be upset at all if a speculative rumor that you acted on gave you a 100% return,
right?


13 Dec 2013, 02:40 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
well, I know you are being tongue in cheek, but taking you seriously, I would respond, read Warren Buffett, he
focuses on definite conclusions. 
Would I be upset if a speculative rumor I acted on gave me a 100% return? Well, I know if that was my
strategy, I would end up going broke or at least losing a large percentage of my money. 
It is a bit like going all in with your money in a poker hand on a long shot, without the proper price, and getting
lucky and sucking out and winning. Their may be temporary happiness, but it won't last if you keep doing that,
because eventually you would go broke. 
So would I be happy? maybe temporary happiness or a sense of relief, but no, I would not be happy because
I know that I will end up broke with that strategy or methodology. 
I know many people don't understand that reasoning, but that is the reason many people are bad investors,
and bad poker players, for that matter. 
A sound strategy and approach leads to long term success in investing and in poker. A strategy or approach
that relies on short term luck is doomed to failure.

MHLD is controlled by the Karfunkels and Zyskind as well and depends on AFSI for much of it's book of
business. If there's foul play at AFSI it would make sense that MHLD would be in the same boat.

DB2013
Is there any indication or accusation that MHLD was involved with any unreported AFSI losses? Do they deal
in LSCs at all? I haven't seen any comment on either from Geo or anywhere else, so it doesn't "make sense"
just to assume that MHLD is anything but the reinsurance arm it has functioned as until now. Incidentally, they
just did the major notes offerings with four blue chip underwriters.


12 Dec 2013, 10:30 PM


Micro_Cap_Value
Yes, the notes are pretty illiquid, so part of the issue here is you don't want to wait around to find out whether the
accusations are true or false. The upside/downside risk with an illiquid note makes it tough to sit with them unless you
are completely certain the accounting is accurate -- and how can you really know if you're on the outside?


12 Dec 2013, 03:35 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
It is called doing due diligence.


12 Dec 2013, 10:43 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
well, the author didn't provide any negative history on Pipoly and Saxon, he said the CEO of a company they
previously were at stole money from the company. He didn't say that had anything to do with them. 
Also, this article seems to say that they suspect that the Luxemburg ceded losses are not consolidated, but the author
failed to have the confidence to say that they actually know this is the case. So, the author is claiming not to know, but
to be suspicious. I would rather actually know one way or another, especially before writing such an article.


12 Dec 2013, 04:14 PM


GardenWeasel
From Investopedia: 
Definition of 'Controller': 
An individual who has responsibility for all accounting-related activities within a firm. In most organizations,
the controller is the top managerial and financial accountant.


Pipoly was controller at CGI. $30 million went missing and he didn't know anything about it? If he isn't a crook
he's an idiot. Either way, I wouldn't invest in a company that employs him as a CFO. Just sayin'.

Remember, that $50 is AFTER a 20-for-1 reverse split.


12 Dec 2013, 04:15 PM

Actually should read 1 for 20. PNX stock price has done well since the split, unlike many that continue down
the toilet. PNX was selling at 1.50 going into the split, to a split adjusted $30 PPS. Now trading at $54. Nice
chart;

I have owned this stock for many years now. It has been one of the jewels of my portfolio. I'm not quite ready to sell.
There may be something to the story, but I would like to hear more about it from Management. However, I'm
disappointed that management has not responded to the charges made here in much more detail. I would like to see
how they account for losses (assuming that there were some unaccounted losses - which is unclear at this point) as
well as identify the type of accounting practices they are using. I do agree that if there were losses that were not
properly accounted for in some way - then the CFO, CEO, and possibly others should spend some time in prison. In
that case, they would be guilty of inflating earnings - which is fraud. If on the other hand, the company can show that
there were no losses or that the losses were accounted for in another area that was overlooked by the authors of this
article, then the SEC should prosecute them and they should go to prison. Sure hope the authors did not overlook
anything... The insurance and re-insurance business can get very complicated sometimes.


12 Dec 2013, 06:04 PM


yeti123
Question for GEO: 
The primary claim is that the ACHL subsidiary is where losses are hideen from SEC fillings. Are you sure you are not
double counting the 2010 $62M ceded losses twice, the first time in the A.M. Best US subsidiaries of which TIC is
included, and the second time in the TIC Schedule Y disbursement to ACHL?


In 2010, TIC ceded $215M losses to AII, which then ceded $62M in losses to ACHL. Separately, TIC also sent $62M
in cash to ACHL as stated in TIC Schedule Y. Would not the losses ceded by AII to ACHL by incurred by TIC, as the
amount they are sending in cash to ACHL under some reinsurance agreement?

If there was double counting, wouldn't that double count the net premiums as well?

I'm surprised at the emotional attachment some people have to their investments. Insurance companies are valued
rather conservatively. as for AFSI valuation, freakin' MetLife sells for less than book and goodwill and intangibles
(otherwise known as smoke and mirrors) is 15%-ish of equity. AFSI? Even after the fall it is going for 2x book value,
and that book value is based on goodwill and intangibles that are over 42% of equity. So you all think AFSI is way
more solid than MetLife, eh? With thousands of stocks to put your money in this is the best you can come up with? I
have no horse in this race, I wish you luck.


13 Dec 2013, 10:08 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
AFSI has been growing faster than Metlife, which is much easier for them to do because they are much
smaller, and AFSI is selling at under a 10 p/e, and only a small % of stocks are selling for less than a 10 p/e.


15 Dec 2013, 12:21 PM


GardenWeasel
A quick check shows that 615 U.S. stocks are currently selling for a P/E of 10 or less. Hell, 205 are selling for
a P/E of less than 5! Why not buy them? Good sense will tell you that they are selling for such low P/Es for a
reason, and that reason is that their accounting or future prospects are not to be trusted. What is this growth
based on? Willy nilly acquisitions with dubious future prospects? EBIX is quite the growth story and their book
value minus Goodwill and Intangibles is a NEGATIVE VALUE! They may be a great story but do you want to
risk your money on such a premise? Rotsa ruck if you do. I wish you well.


17 Dec 2013, 10:25 AM

Not many stocks with a PE under 10 earn a 35% return on tangible equity and have done so for years. That
justifies a higher multiple.


17 Dec 2013, 10:27 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
When you say that every stock selling for a p/e under 10 or 5 is selling for that price for a good reason, you
sound like a devotee of the efficient market theory, which I completely disagree with. 
I believe some stocks are greately mispriced. I have looked at every U.S. stock trading for under a 10 p/e
over the last 4.5 years and I keep an eye on them. AFSI is one of my favorites, my very favorite is JP Morgan
since the London Whale incident. I think both stocks are selling at a heavy discount to what they are worth
and I don't think there is any good reason for it at all.

Why are you comparing AFSI to Mutual Benefit (private), EEA Life settlements Fund (private), Absolute Life Solutions
(once a public company), and Life Partners Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LPHI)? 
Those companies were in the life settlements business, in fact it was their primary business, they bought life
settlements and sold them to customers. 
AFSI is not in the life settlements business, they are a customer that was sold to. It is a very small part of their
business. They are simply not comparable to these businesses at all. 
I should know, you can see I wrote an article about Life Partners, predicting their demise. 
You are comparing apples and oranges and it makes no sense to me.

You don't say that it had anything to do with Pipoly and Saxon or they did anything wrong. 
If person x and person y work for the same company, and person x steals money from the company, what does that
say about person y or what does it have to do with person y? Nothing, unless person y was involved. You don't say
Pipoly or Saxon was involved. So what is your point in bringing this up?

How do you compare GWG holdings, which is in the business of purchasing life settlements for sale to customers,
with AFSI, which is merely a customer that purchased some life settlments? 
What is the significance of GWG holdings being investigated by the SEC, have you concluded they did something
wrong or not? Many companies are investigated by the SEC without anything happening, witness CVBF, who I wrote
on article on when their share price cratered because they were being investigated by the SEC? It was a great time to
invest in CVBF and the SEC has not done anything against them, despite investigating. 
Another example is Fairfax Financial years ago. 
It seems like you are just casting aspersions without any basis.


And, how does that relate to AFSI, who is not in the same business at all?

Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
You base a claim that half of AFSI's policies are held by Phoenix on a Tiger Capital lawsuit that claimed that AFSI
held 138 policies issued by Phoenix. However, AFSI has said that the Phoenix policies represent only 15% of the fair
value of their portfolio as of 9/30, 2013, and their net carrying value is $20 million. 
Obviously, it is the percentage exposure of the policies and the carrying value of the policies that is important, as
opposed to the total number of policies or the % of total policies (if the phoenix policies are much smaller or have
been written down to be much smaller, then having more of them may not be significant). 
Do you dispute AFSI's claims? Do you have any information that the exposure that AFSI claims, less than 15% or $20
million, is in Phoenix policies? 
If you don't, then don't you think the information you provided is much less relevant than you tried to make it appear,
or misleading at worst?

5/23/2018 AmTrust Financial Services: A House Of Cards? - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 40/41


1. No allegation AFSI underreserved: typically, the big problem that hits insurance companies is being underreserved.
I think AFSI is not under reserved, but if someone contended otherwise, we could disagree about it. It is not easy for
regulators to know for sure if a company is well reserved, because it is a judgment call. For example, the problem with
TGWP is being under reserved. 
2. AFSI accounting is right on the ceding of premiums and losses issue. As Bronte points out in his article, AFSI's
accounting on the ceding of losses and premiums and consolidating them are correct. AFSI so contends. Plus, this is
the kind of thing accountants and auditors look for, and is easy to figure out and validate, so I suspect AFSI wouldn't
even bother to do it for that reason, and, if they did, accountants and regulators would have discovered and pointed it
out. Reserving and other tactics are better ways to pull a scam off with a much less chance of getting caught. 
3. AFSI is not in the life settlements business, they are an investor in life settlements. So, I don't believe there is any
chance there will be any investigation. All the companies cited by the author are in the life settlements business, buy
and selling them. My review of the life settlements is that they are conservatively marked. AFSI bought these life
settlements dirt cheap. However, we can argue about that. At the end of the day, it is not a small % of their
investments, and the SEC will have no interest whatsoever in it. 
4. Pipoly and Saxon. I can just say here that the author hasn't established anything other than they were indicted. But
what happened? plenty of indicated people are innocent. It appears here that they were indicated by it was either
dropped or they defended successfully. Pipoly and Saxon appear to have had long stable jobs at 3 different places.
Perhaps there is a problem with them, but the other hasn't established that. Meanwhile, the author has alleged no
problems with the founders, the board, or the CEO, all of which I have not uncovered any problems with.

"Here is a quote from the relevant court filings:


"Fazekash subsequently notified Pipoly that Lucia would be wiring a substantial sum of money to CGIC and instructed
Pipoly to account for the money as a reduction of CGIC's commission expense. Pipoly understood that Lucia would
be wiring the money to follow through on Lucia's commitment to cease diverting premium payments. Pipoly also
understood that an accounting entry to reduce commission expense would not be the appropriate way to account for
previously unrecorded premium payments."


So where's the link to this?


The quote seems to indicate plainly that Pipoly and Saxon are bad guys, thus short the stock...among of course other
factors.


The 2 links provided prior to the quote do not link to that snippet. After googling Pipoly and Saxon and combing thru
various legal reports...nothing seems to clearly indicate Saxon and Pipoly were clearly committing foul play. Seems
the CEO was, but doesnt seem clear the CFO and COO was.


A link to where this came from would be helpful. Otherwise, this piece smells like bunk.

Well I clearly lost on this one. I foolishly sold my position that I had for years when this seeking alpha article was
published. For some reason I had more confidence in this site.
