SS Central America Comes Up Short: Bankruptcy Countdown
Jul. 10, 2014 1:37 PM ET43 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


SS Central America recovery coming up short: “only a few small containers”
recovered over the last month: We now believe the project will be clearly unprofitable
overall.


We model cash balance hitting zero, with likely corresponding required bankruptcy
filing July 16th after mid-month payroll & bills are paid.


Oceanica EIA still not filed, local environmental opposition appears to be building
strength.


Creditors and vendors likely to be impaired at this point given high liabilities and little
bill-paying cash liquid assets, will get worse with time and continued cash burn.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s fate appears to be coming down to the
wire with their two key projects, SS Central America and Oceanica entering their "show
me" phase in typical OMEX over-promise, under-deliver fashion. Just filed yesterday
afternoon, the court has lifted the seal on the inventory of the treasure and… It's about
time to tear up those lottery tickets and move on, the numbers have been called.


July 9, 2014 Letter To Court overseeing SS Central America: (emphasis ours)


Dear Judge Smith:


Pursuant to the Court's June 12, 2014 Order, we are writing regarding the upcoming
arrival of the vessel [Odyssey Explorer] in Charleston on July 14. It is anticipated
that there will be only a small number of artifacts available for offload and transport
to the substitute custodian, likely comprising only a few small containers. All of
these containers would easily fit into the trunk of a small vehicle.

Announced and inferred recoveries have been on a decline curve, which makes sense as
the best treasure would surely be recovered first. Things have declined from 1,000oz of
treasure in the first 3 hours to only 5,000oz in the first 6 weeks and now just "a few small
containers" after last month's work.


SS Central America Likely To Be An Unprofitable Project


We now believe there is strong evidence that the SS Central America, like every other
treasure hunting project, ever (Treasure Hunting Is the World's Worst Investment), will
ultimately be unprofitable at a project level given the high expenses and extremely
unprofitable when overhead costs are included:

Creditors and Vendors Likely to be Impaired At this Point


Based on our estimates (below) and in more detail here of the cash and liability balances,
we believe a bankruptcy filing on July 16th is highly probable. We certainly hope at a
minimum that OMEX does not bounce the paychecks of the men who have been working
out in the stormy seas and puts their interests ahead of executive paychecks. It does
seem likely at this point that there is no way that trade creditors will come out whole and
likely that Fifth Third will be impaired on their "secured" loan on the SS Central America
find, given that monetization is a long way away and there will likely be additional
expenses incurred between now and ultimate realization.


This Certainly Contrasts to CEO Greg Stemm's statements at the AGM just recently:

We've already recovered over $100,000 in 1857 face value of ingots and other gold


As for the site itself, there is one thing that I can tell you without any qualification -
and that is that anyone who thought that the previous operations twenty years ago
recovered all the gold and valuables from the site was clearly mistaken. Nearly every
day of seafloor operations produces new discoveries and recoveries of gold in a
dazzling array of different forms.


Now that we've completed recovery of most of the gold and valuable artifacts on
the surface outside the hull structure, we're starting on the excavation inside the hull
itself.


Our estimates of cash and liabilities indicate best case OMEX has cash to last until
August without a dilutive equity raise


Recall - the Fifth Third $10mm credit line is available for up to 50% of the appraised value
of ingots or $2,000 per coin for the first $5mm borrowed and half of this for the second.


So with generous assumptions that all the gold was coins (it was stated as less valuable
ingots…) at $100,000 face value = 5,000 oz * $20/oz. This would provide collateral for up
to $7.5mm on this credit line ($5mm/$2,000/coin + $2.5mm/$1,000/coin = 5,000 oz), or
$7mm unrestricted cash (there is a $500k restricted cash required as collateral that cannot
be touched). In this "best case" cash may last another 2-3 weeks given the rapid
$3mm/month cash burn.


Oceanica Monetization Appears Unlikely Given EIA Still Not Filed and Local
Environmental Opposition Appears to be Strengthening


6-4-2014 AGM Presentation: CEO, Greg Stemm: I am pleased to report that this [EIA]
filing - all 1,200 pages of it - is completed and ready to be filed shortly


See our other article for more details on this but it now appears there is substantial local
pushback from environmental groups and the projects is facing challenges that have not
been disclosed to shareholders.

Since CWM is obviously not the Ohio court, I wonder if this letter concerns personal effects and/or items that may

Interesting that the next sentence of the letter to the Court on July 9 that was referenced was not quoted. More
particularly, after the end of the quoted sentence that ends in "small vehicle" the report goes on to note that "This is in
stark contrast to the large number of artifacts off-loaded in June , which were loaded on pallets and transported in a
tractor-trailer rig from Charleston to Sarasota." Recall that the initial recovery was in May so the tractor-trailer load,
obviously of considerable size was the second recovery.


10 Jul 2014, 02:42 PM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yes, the stark contrast indicates that there was recovery and now the level of recovery has
dropped sharply - they even highlight that in the letter, which is clearly linked.


I believe that is the load that Greg Stemm was referring to on June 4th (ship came back a week later) that I
put in the chart as 5,000 oz. Don't forget they are bringing up a lot more than gold, all the artifacts, etc.

"ship came back a week later"


5000 ounces (312.5 pounds) would not require a tractor trailer. Actually as double eagles that would easily fit
in the trunk of a small car.


To go from that to the need for a tractor trailer (doubt it would share its load with Sears appliances or the like
or that they would use a tractor trailer unless they had to) would take a whole lotta "artifacts"


Mark Gordon did say they had to up their 25 million onboard cargo insurance.


We'll see.


10 Jul 2014, 03:33 PM


tigersfirtwhoe
Sorry, read the letter closely, "economically worthwhile". If it was full of gold worth even $1 million it would be
"economically worthwhile" to take off the ship. Seriously, how expensive is a fork lift, a few bodyguards and an
armored car. If they had millions of $ worth of stuff it would be "economically worthwhile" to unload. Their
words not mine.


It would be a lot safer at the custodian than on board a ship, it would be irresponsible if not borderline criminal
to keep something worth $millions on the ship, they have to take proper care of it. .


Dont know how or where he got this letter but it is pretty damming evidence.


10 Jul 2014, 03:49 PM


Papaoomowmow
Tiger, I was referring to the space between Stemm's first statement and the unloading at port a week later. It
was that load which required the tractor trailer. The initial 6000 ounces the author assumes would not have
required a tractor trailer.


So it all comes down what exactly was on that truck.


It took two summers to find the bulk of the insured Gairsoppa silver. Now this is a wooden ship instead of
steel and half the depth of the G, but not every month yields the final amount. They will be back in port soon,
and we'll know then if they judge it worthwhile to continue..


Point well taken about leaving ultra valuable stuff onboard indefinitely......you are right ..they probably would
not.

Hmm, "pallets" in June. Pallets typically carry 2,000 pounds. If we assume only two pallets of gold that is
about 4,000 pounds and converting that to the bullion value we have how many hundred million dollars at just
$1300 per ounce?


10 Jul 2014, 04:14 PM


paintthecorner
So to my question, why would they need a tractor trailer? Are they bringing up parts of the ship? This is
investement recovery that OMEX was hired to do, I am assuming anything they go after would need to be of
value for RLP to recoup investment. I find it hard to believe they are going to waste time picking up large
items that have no significance.

Do not forget there is a preservation aspect to this salvage. Any organic matter or heavily corroded items will
need to be stored in water baths until appropriate preservation can be achieved. Ie at OSU in Columbus. No
one except the involved parties can really account for work performed at the site. At this time it mat be better
to leave salvageable items at depth until specific arrangements for preservation can be made.

Belief is wonderful....but one could also wait for facts...no one....especially yourself has any idea of the value of what
has been recovered. The project has months to go. I notice you make no mention of plausible explanations on why
the recovery might be lumpy...especially once they are no longer doing surface recovery. The company clearly
remains optimist...and they are the ones with facts.


Looking forward to July 14, 15,16......

Good deduction sparco.... I'd like to know what kind of magic glasses Meson is wearing that he can read so much
between the lines. That is a very carefully worded letter which sheds no light whatsoever on what exists on, or is
known about the shipwreck. Morris paints the letter as an admission of failure. Read carefully, it is anything but. It
clearly anticipates future recoveries. Further, Morris has no clue as to what the contents of that semi trailer were,

therefore all of his calculating and ciphering are just exercises in wishful thinking or worse, intentional efforts to
mislead.


I'd think that if the team is trying to access area in the bowels of the ship, it can be expected to be time consuming.
Not everything they touch is going to be treasure. The absence of success isn't necessarily failure.


10 Jul 2014, 03:08 PM


tigersfirtwhoe
You are right, it is very carefully worded, we know their are few artifacts, can fit inside the trunk of a car and is
not economically worthwhile to spend the money to take it of the ship.


Fairly obvious to anyone that has half a brain and is intellectually honest. Aint no magic glasses necessary, If
you can't figure it out too bad for you.

Judge Smith is in control of the salvage operation and it is she that requires the regular update. In her decision of July

So Ryan - even 5000 $20 gold coins - if that's what the $100,00 face value is comprised of is - which it isn't, because
they told us it was a dazzling variety of coins, bricks, nuggets, jewelry, etc. - it could all fit in the trunk of a small
vehicle. So, Ryan, can you imagine what it might have been - what those many things might have been - that were
loaded onto pallets (plural) and trucked in a semi trailer? Can you imagine for a moment that, if they are seeking court
approval to avoid the unnecessary cost of transporting what might only be another 5000 or so $20 gold coins (or
equivalent) - what it must have been that was CLEARLY worth the expense when the pallets were trucked away?

Just thinking. If the "letter" mentions wanting to keep the small amount of artifacts currently on board, then OE fully
plans to go back out to the site, after their shore leave/supplies in Charleston. We are not done recovering yet! Pretty
important to the total recovery value that we will be going back out for another leg of recovery. Otherwise, box the few
artifacts and take them in the car as you leave Charleston and OE (still in port) after the "finished" job.

Simple question Mason: If OMEX is about to file for bankruptcy, why not just sit back, grin a big grin, and get ready to
write a check to charity? Why keep relentlessly publishing reports? The stock will be at zero on July 16 according to
you? What's the rush to drive it to zero today? Can't you wait a week? Its the most important thing about you that
makes no sense. Winners never gloat.

All,


I've been in attendance at several recent large coin shows, and there's been a lot of sidebar talk that several large
rare coin dealers and rare coin investors have approached Odyssey Marine to gain the rights for "first dibs" on the
Central America Gold Coins and Private Assay bars that OMEX will eventually take possession of. There is alot of
speculation that the big money dealers already have committed collectors/buyers for the newly recovered CA
numismatic gold coins and bars, and they are in the process of working a financial deal with OMEX that does not
infringe on the collateral rights of the fifth third credit facility. I know many of these big money players in the coin
business, and $10M - $15M is a drop in the bucket for many of them. Some of them spend that much money to
acquire coins for deep pocket clients with want lists every month. This is part of why I've commented in earlier posts
that I don't believe OMEX will have a problem with running out of money any time soon. They have the right to assets
that many coin collectors and collectible investors covet, and that is a powerful card. I feel certain, and it's my strong
opinion, there are some financial arrangements being made with Odyssey, or have already been made that might
include up-front cash for future purchase of OMEX's CA gold coins after they receive back their CA collateral assets
from fifth third. No bankruptcy filing is coming. I feel quite sure about that.

Ship, I also have been speaking regularly to one of the large dealers who said they have money ready and
are trying to get an exclusive. They said collectors are " drooling " to get their hands on any new territorial
coins. Customers are lining up for this opportunity.


11 Jul 2014, 10:04 AM


shipbuilder1
Teklord,


I'm with ya' there. In the coin dealer and collecting community, this happens every time a new undiscovered cache of
numismatic coins and items is discovered.....whether it be a hoard found behind someone's wall, a bank vault storage
find, shipwreck recovery, whatever. There's always a lot of drooling and backdoor dealing. The July 9th letter which
talked about the June off-load being several pallets and transported in a big rig was telling (at least to me) about the
breadth of gold and artifacts that have been recovered so far. Certainly, it was not all gold in the big June offload, but
I'm sure there was more gold, plus jewelry, bottles, ceramics, religious articles and who knows what else. It would only
be a guess, but given we know they have already recovered about 6000 ounces in coin and assay bars, it would not
be a stretch to say the June off load probably contained more bars and $20 gold coins, if only a few thousand more
ounces (which would not take up much space at all), would make the recovery even more economic than it already is.
Continuing to watch and wait.

"We model cash balance hitting zero, with likely corresponding required bankruptcy filing July 16th after mid-month
payroll & bills are paid."


At the start of April they had nearly 6 million in cash, so add that to the 10 million and that was 16 million available as
of April 1st.


As of May 12th they had not drawn any of the $10 million in line of credit, and to July 16 is little over two months of
operations. At about $1 million per month for the SS Central America.


They are probably close to dipping in to the Line Of Credit now but $10 million should last until the artifacts are sold
and they are paid for the recovery.


They also can sell equity in Oceanica to raise more cash if needed.

Forward looking, in the direction of all OMEX shareholders’ future, what do CEO Greg Stemm and company have
planned for the remaining days of the 2014 salvage year? As of Friday, July 11, 2014 there are 173 calendar days
remaining until Wednesday, December 31, 2014. Will they merely sit at home in Florida continuing to burn cash or is
there some other as yet un-announced planned money making event to earn income dollars before sunset on
December 31, 2014 arrives? If creative accounting did not exist then CEO Greg Stemm and company would really be
in deep and I don’t mean water!


As OMEX shareholders we always hear about past projects but not so much what is scheduled as the next task to
complete. I have never observed such a group of pompous people crush their laurels more by sitting on them until the
laurels are dead, dried-up and lifeless all while bragging with the past in such myopic hind-sight.


Is this company a one trick pony or can CEO Greg Stemm and company handle juggling more than one ball (project)
at a time? Actually, tossing one ball (project) at a time is more like playing catch with one's self, two balls (projects) at
a time is a game of toss while three balls (projects) at a time is juggling. I certainly would never expect CEO Greg
Stemm and company to attempt something as complicated as keeping four balls (projects) in the air during within a 12
month calendar year.


Does anyone else notice what selfish losers (thieves) CEO Greg Stemm and company are for not being able to
successfully run a company except by only enriching themselves and not the OMEX shareholders?

So you need a tractor trailer for 5000 oz? So you ignore the fact that they have recovered and likely will go
back out after crew rotation and simply focus on the fact that a letter said this trip in would not bring up much.

May 2014. Painter is right........5000 ounces of gold does not take up much space......about 2 brief cases. The tractor
trailer shipment was offloaded when OE came back in late June. We're supposing three or four or five pallets of
recovered material. We don't know what that recovered material/artifacts were. Could have been all gold, could have
been a mix of gold and lower value artifacts, or could have been all lower value artifacts. I personally think it was a
mix of some gold and some lower value artifacts. The lower value artifacts like bottles and ceramics would take up a
bit of room. But, no one will know til the inventory comes out.

Ok, so lets summarize what OMEX has brought up so far from the CA....


April 2014 ..... Inital test recovery 2 coins/5 gold bars (1000 oz's) 
Late May 2014......$100,000 1857 specie/value recovery (5000 oz's) 
Late June 2014.....3 to 5 pallets of artifacts (probably combination of some gold coins, gold bars, jewelry, bottles,
ceramics, religious items, and miscellaneous) 
July 9th 2014......small amount of artifacts which could easily fit into the trunk of a small car......this is still on the
Odyssey Explorer and not off loaded yet since OE is still at the CA work site.


I'll leave it to your imagination to estimate the value of all this stuff, since we don't know exactly what everything
is........but my opinion is that the CA recovery is already well within the realm of a profitable recovery for Odyssey
Marine. And they are still working the site, which bodes that there may be more coming up........

The approximate value of U.S. gold per ounce in the year 1857 was $20.65 per ounce which should get the
old horseshoe fairly close to the stake for a rough order of magnitude estimate for then versus now.

Today's gold price closed at approximately $1306.80 (Bid) if you were a seller of the metal. Another way of
looking at OMEX's recent recovery is by today's dollars (07-14-2014) gold is worth 63.28 times more than it
was worth in 1857.


It will be interesting to see how the final numbers compare to the ship's manifest less of course what was
recovered by the previous salvor who is by all regards untrustworthy and now a fugitive from justice.

I wonder how much gold dust (fines) and nuggets were also able to be recovered.


Did the ship sink all at once in a single contained debris field or is there more than one designated search
area?


I guess we shall soon find out.

Pearson,


Interesting observations. I left the value estimates alone because truthfully, there are so many variables it's not funny.
You have spot gold value, then you have numismatic gold value for private assay bars, then you have numismatic
value for gold coins which varies by grade, then you have unknowns like bottles which are collectible and have value,
sometimes up to $1000 dollars each, then you have period jewelry, gold rings, silver jewelry, pearl necklaces, maybe
diamond rings, then religious items such as gold crosses, then plain gold nuggets which are valued at spot, but if you
put a small nugget into a plastic encasement with the words "gold nugget recovered from the SS Central America", it
becomes worth 10x gold value or whatever the market will bear......and then there is the possibility of the army gold
bars.


The frustrating part is we can only speculate right now because we do not know the composition of the
material/artifacts recovered so far except we do know tidbits. If I were to take a wild guess based on what we know,
and figure in for variables associated with the 3-5 pallets of goodies that we frankly have no idea what was on those
pallets in the big rig, I would say conservatively that OMEX has brought up $50M dollars in gold and artifacts. Since
they are entitled to 80% up to point to cover their recovery costs, I would say the breakdown right now is $30M goes
to OMEX and $20M goes to the receiver. If they bring up more, the number will skew closer to even between OMEX
and receiver since we must be in the 45%/55% split area now.


But at this point, I'm not sure it does much good to guess......you're right, we'll find out soon enough.


On your question, My impression fr0m historical events is that the ship sank whole and came to rest on the bottom
about a half mile from where she started sinking at the ocean surface. Some materials probably fell out and scattered
the sinking debris field, but I don't know anymore than that. There are others like Bob Evan who studied the event in
excruciating detail, and he believes that little fell off the ship during sinking, and most gold and artifacts came to rest
on the actual shipwreck site. Of course, this did prove itself out in the early 90's when the CADG found the lions share
of the commercial gold shipment on the CA wreck site.

Meson - do you still expect OMEX to file for bankruptcy today, this week??

So where's the bankruptcy filing?

Author’s reply »  Like I said in this report, IF they were able to borrow another (appears max $2.7mm) then
they could have enough cash to postpone bankruptcy until the 1st or 2nd week or August so that is the date
now. 3 weeks to go!

This reminds me of the brilliance of Warren Jeffs, who too managed to fool some gullible people a couple
times.

What you said was "we believe a bankruptcy filing on July 16th is highly probable".


But yet it didn't happen. Gee, what a surprise. You must be flabbergasted at having gotten something so
specific and "highly probable" wrong. But your premise and analysis couldn't be wrong, could it?

Coming up short on those bankruptcy predictions? 
Epic FAIL.

What I want to know is how Meson Capital Partners can continue to bash this company with slander and libel and a
continued stream of negative stories that are not accurate, and not get sued? Isn't this stock price manipulation? You
guys better watch out, or YOU will get put out of business. OMEX continues to do well, has ample lines of credit, has
had great success with its latest salvage project, recovering 13,500 gold and silver coins from the site of the 1857 SS
Central American shipwreck, is bidding on work to find the lost Malaysian airliner - nothing but GOOD news.

Is your strategy just to throw enough negative stories against the wall and see if anything sticks, in the hope of driving
down the price and profiting from shorting the stock. You guys are criminals, and the SEC should be notified. This
can't be legal. Meson reminds me of Bill Ackman vs. Herbalife, shameful.

The consolidated net result of the company in the second quarter of 2014 improved by 63% as compared to the same
period in 2013. The net loss in the second quarter of 2014 was $4.0 million or $(0.05) per share, as compared to a net
loss of $10.9 million or $(0.14) per share in the year-ago quarter.


Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.7 million at June 30, 2014, as compared to $5.8 million at March 31, 2014.
Operating cash flows for the second quarter of 2014 improved by 39% as compared to the same period in 2013.


Subsequent to the quarter, Odyssey entered into a binding letter of intent for a long-term marketing agreement and
new funding vehicle that is non-dilutive to Odyssey shareholders and provides $10 million to the company. The
agreement provides for an immediate payment of $5 million upon closing and up to an additional $5 million based on
benchmarks that the company expects to achieve in the third and fourth quarters of 2014.


“In addition to this new funding facility, we are pursuing other cash inflow options such as monetizing a stake in our
subsidiary Oceanica, collection of receivables, and monetization of the SS Central America cargo,” stated Philip
Devine, Odyssey’s CFO. “In parallel to these cash inflows, management expects to reduce the company’s operating
cash needs by at least one third by the end of the year.”
