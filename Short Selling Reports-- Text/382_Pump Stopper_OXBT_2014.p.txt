Oxygen Bio: Insiders Register To Exit As Paid Promoters Hype Stock
Jun. 10, 2014 2:39 PM ET7 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Multiple stock promoters are aggressively hyping OXBT stock, including Small Cap
Street, whose recommendations have recently been halted by the SEC (FSPM,
PHOT, and PTOG) or declined 75% (PVCT).


S-3 registration filing of June 2nd should be effective any day now, enabling the
largest shareholder to cash out his stock.


OXBT is already up 250% from October 2013 after licensing levosimendan
(Simdax): Abbott previously said it was not "commercially reasonable" in the U.S.
market.


Executives and directors have track records of shareholder value destruction,
including total wipe-outs.


OXBT has a long history of failing to get to market: it guided to start Oxycyte Phase
II trials in 2009, still not done!


I believe Oxygen Biotherapeutics (OXBT) is a Strong Sell and the shares have a high
probability of eventually ending up worthless, given their non-stop net losses. After an
incredible 500% run-up from $1.40 to $9 after purchasing a licensing agreement for
levosimendan (Simdax) for just $4.8mm, the stock has since had a steady decline and
looks to be running out of steam. So I was surprised to see an S-3 registration statement
filed by the company on behalf of the largest shareholder, Gregory Pepin, which will allow
him to sell his 5.3 million shares and warrants. The same day, there was an S-8
registration to allow insiders receiving shares as compensation to potentially sell 3.96
million shares.


Simdax was already evaluated by Abbott for the U.S. market, and Abbott chose to
not proceed


Why would he want to sell now, when it is just getting started on Phase III trials for its
claimed $600-million market opportunity? Perhaps it is because this is not a new idea?

2. 2004 Orion and Abbott "expand" marketing relationship.


3. 2006 Abbott says it is "exploring options for next steps in the U.S."


4. 4/27/2007 Abbott "has decided not to continue the development program for the product
in the US, because it would not be commercially reasonable."


5. 6 years later, Orion licenses Simdax to a recently founded "company" called Phyxius,
apparently made up of 4 guys using a residential address in New Jersey as their
headquarters.


6. This same group of individuals then sells this to a floundering biotech company in
exchange for $4.8m in stock.


7. Are we to believe that two global pharma juggernauts already spent millions of dollars
and apparently years of effort attempting to commercialize this old drug in the U.S., both
failed, but a few guys operating from a house in NJ now have a "$600m market
opportunity" that they traded for $4.8m in OXBT stock?


8. Milestone payments based on the achievement of market capitalization (i.e. stock price
increases!) - also why are licensing terms redacted? Reference details below.


At the same time, a number of stock promoters with highly questionable track records
appear to be promoting OXBT stock. Multiple other stocks these promoters have been
involved with were halted by the SEC.

5/22/2018 Oxygen Bio: Insiders Register To Exit As Paid Promoters Hype Stock - Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TENX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2261763-oxygen-bio-insiders-register-to-exit-as-paid-promoters-hype-stock 3/12


On Friday, May 16th, the SEC issued a warning letter to investors. In this warning letter,
the SEC highlighted 5 stocks it has recently halted. These stocks are:


1. FusionPharm Inc. (OTC:FSPM) - promoted by Paul Lipp's OTCbbjournal.com


2. Cannabusiness Group Inc. (OTC:CBGI)


3. Growlife, Inc. (OTCQB:PHOT) - promoted by Mark Bonacci Paul Lipp's "SmallCapIR"


4. Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:CANN)


5. Petrotech Oil and Gas, Inc. (OTC:PTOG) - promoted by Paul Lipp's "StocksImpossible"


While the press release specifically focuses on marijuana-related investments, there is
another story behind three of these stocks: FSPM, PTOG and PHOT were all stocks that
benefited from positive research reports from Small Cap Street LLC, a firm that is in the
business of marketing and advertising public companies for compensation. Small Cap
Street LLC is apparently owned and operated by Paul Lipp.


Small Cap Street has also recently published on OXBT and PVCT (see our full report),
which were written by the same author who wrote the PTOG report, Osman Ghani, a paid
writer for Small Cap Street LLC.


We do not know for certain who compensates paid promoters such as Small-Cap Street:
is it the company, an intermediary, or perhaps a large shareholder about to sell stock?


However, based on the number of promotional articles and based on the disclaimers it
appears to me that someone is paying for OXBT's stock to be promoted.


1. Osman Ghani put out an extremely promotional "research" piece on OXBT working for
"Small Cap Street", and their other "analysts" have also covered OXBT. Osman Ghani
appears to have zero biotech experience, per his resume.


a. Small Cap Street also has an unusual track record of publishing on stocks that get
halted by the SEC (see PVCT report and see this disclaimer).


b. "The Group (and our Media Publications/Products) is periodically compensated for
describing certain securities of the issuers highlighted on SCS Websites. In addition, in
some instances the Group and SCS Websites's affiliates, officers, directors and
employees may also have bought or may buy, or have sold or may sell the securities
discussed in SCS Websites and may profit in the event of a rise in value of those
securities."

c. "We are engaged in the business of marketing and advertising companies for
monetary compensation. "


d. Then, what appears to be the same group using a different company name called
"Small Cap IR" published another report recently on OXBT.


e. I have found Small Cap Street's disclosure to be confusing and unclear in the past. Did
Osman Ghani write this 12-page report with graphs and charts on OXBT for charity, out of
the goodness of his heart? If not, who paid him?


2. With virtually zero discussion of any potential market or sales estimates, Osman claims
OXBT is worth a whopping $10.56 per share.


3. OXBT has also been "researched" by a Marc Bonacci on "Small Cap Street". Some of
Marc's articles appear to reference the CFA Institute and designation, but when I put
Marc's name in the CFA member directory, I could find no evidence of his name.


4. It also appears that a whole host of questionable-looking stock promotion websites,
some of which have disclaimers about paid research, have published on OXBT, including:


a. "StockSumo.com": "Bull in Advantage does on occasion sell shares in the open market
without notice, and on occasion is compensated by a Third-Party for its above-referenced
services with the company stock."


b. "Blue Horse Shoe Stocks"


c. "flashmarketresearch.com" and "undergroundalerts.com" published on OXBT. A quick
look at their websites lists no disclaimer at all.


d. And "SHAZAMSTOCKS" (my personal favorite) with this disclaimer:
"Shazamstocks.com has been compensated by companies profiled on this site, or by a
third party"


5. Who paid for all this stock promotion about OXBT? Was it OXBT? Or perhaps OXBT
paid or retained a marketing group or IR firm that then paid for this stock promotion for
OXBT?


6. Just yesterday, PennyStocksWeekly appears to be added to the list - just in time for a
big registration statement to become effective for millions of shares!

Twitter and Yahoo message boards listing paid promotions from PennyStocksWeekly just
Monday, 7 days after the S-3 was filed, shortly before it should become effective and
shares freely tradable.


OXBT Lists Its Own "Market Cap" as "Performance Milestone"??


Why might OXBT be tied to stock promoters? Could it be that the largest shareholder,
Greg Pepin, just last week, filed to be able to sell stock? Could it be the company was
looking at a financing, and the higher the stock price, the more money it could get from
investors? Even more worrisome, the "performance milestones" (page 14. contract point
2.5) lists the company's own market capitalization as a "performance milestone" at which
point the CEO's convertible note he received for the Phyxius deal vests at.


OXBT Management and Board have Track Records of Value Destruction and
Shareholder Wipe-Outs


Current CEO, John Kelley was previously president of The Medicines Company
(NASDAQ:MDCO) from 2004-2009. During a period where the overall market was roughly
flat, his company declined 72% in value:

Other board member track records:


Ronald Blanck was at DelSite from 2003-2008 (wipe-out) and


Pyng Medical (on the board 2009-present): Stock lost 88% of value during this time
period:

Anthony DiTonno, CEO of NeurogesX 2003-2011 (wipe-out)


1. Anthony A. DiTonno: Sued by shareholders for "misrepresentations and omissions" in
case 4:12-cv-05034 in 2012 regarding his time as president and CEO of NeurogesX.
Apparently, shareholders allege NeurogesX did not accurately disclose that Tobias was
"actively seeking to leave NeurogsX" when Neuro was actively selling stock to investors;

when it was finally announced that Tobias was leaving NeurogesX, since he was a critical
part of the business, the stock subsequently fell -40%. Apparently, NeurogesX was forced
to settle 5/16/2014 per court document 84.


Chris Rallis: Board of Aeolus Pharmaceuticals (2004-present): Lost 90% of its value


Note: PennyStocksWeekly published that Aeolus was their "Pick #2" back in 5/5/2006,
with 125-166.6% upside! AOLS instead lost -66% of its value since, and is a $0.26 per
share stock that trades on the OTC exchange. PennyStocksWeekly has also recently
published on OXBT as well.

OXBT Patent Protection and Contract Terms Questionable:


1. It is not clear that Simdax, even if you believe management and the stock promotion
websites' extremely bullish claims, could even be economic.


2. One of the key patents (#5,569,657) actually ran out in 2013, and the other two expire
in 2020. OXBT assumes it can get those extended, but with the pending Phase III trial (if it
is successful and completed on time and on budget) not being completed until 2016, the
drug would likely not be on the market until 2017, at the earliest. All drugs take time
(typically years) to build a sales force and start generating revenue, so it is very possible
that the patents will run out before material revenue is generated, let alone profit.


3. Furthermore, Orion originally developed Simdax in the 1990s, and apparently had an
unsuccessful attempt at commercialization that it dropped. Given this simple compound
has been out for over a decade, with one key patent already expired, do you think one of
the generic pharma giants like Mylan or Teva could challenge these patents and beat the
tiny OXBT in court, instantly rendering its product a very low value generic?


Phyxius/OXBT Simdax contract terms very questionable:


1. For those reading the license contract terms on Simdax closely, there are more red
flags. Apparently, if the actual net sales are lower than the "minimum net sales", there is a
"shortfall royalty" due to Orion that has to be paid within 60 days (contract point 8.7).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2261763-oxygen-bio-insiders-register-to-exit-as-paid-promoters-hype-stock 10/12


a. This reads to me that if the drug does not live up to whatever the internal sales
expectations are, there could be a potentially large (terms have not been disclosed to
shareholders) cash payment due that could wipe out OXBT.


b. Furthermore, the royalty terms, milestone payments are all redacted, so we don't even
know what the terms are on this contract or what the financial implications could be for
OXBT. Why weren't the contract terms fully disclosed to shareholders? In my experience,
failure to disclose can imply bad news for shareholders.


c. The "$600m market opportunity!" claims by OXBT management also seem to imply a
market that is beyond the LCOS indication. However, the contract terms on the Simdax
agreement do not make it clear to me if OXBY or Phyxius would even have ownership of
any "line extensions" (contract term 2.5) of this product?


OXBT Track record: Failing to get to Market


Back in Jan 2005, before OXBT changed its name from "Synthetic Blood International", it
announced its Phase II plans for Oxycte, with Phase I trials starting many years before
then. During the touting and hype of Oxycyte back then, OXBT went from a (split-
adjusted) stock price of $44 up to a high of $222 per share. Despite dozens of press
releases and positive-sounding announcements (and equity dilution), OXBT fell
dramatically back to $24 in early 2006.


Apparently the FDA did not like the Phase I data, as "The project was placed on hold,
based upon a decision by the Food and Drug Administration not to allow a clinical trial with
the perfluorocarbon (PFC) Oxycyte to be performed within the United States." And "A
revised statement of work was also submitted, effectively changing the project from a
human clinical trial to an animal study." While this FDA halt on more U.S. trials has been
lifted in early 2014, keep in mind this was after OXBT guided that Phase II trials would
start in early 2009, even after it had already been delayed in 2008. Furthermore, such
minor questions as "How much?", "When?", "Where?", "With whom?" are all still not
precisely answered.


OXBT has over a decade of "over-promise, under-deliver".


Management Response


I called management and spoke with their IR representative, who would not connect me
with management directly. The IR representative was unfamiliar with the substantial
business elements that I had questions about.

Comments (7)


In conclusion, I feel that investors in OXBT may not have read the terms of the contract for
this new licensing agreement, and may only be focused on paid research coverage that
could be temporarily keeping the stock up while insiders liquidate per the recent S-3 and
S-8 filings. Simdax is certainly is a new thing for OXBT, but it is not NEW to the world and
has been investigated by Abbott, who has far more resources and determined it was not
commercial. At the same time, the stock is being aggressively hyped by paid promoters
(though I do not know exactly what is going on there), and an S-3 registration statement
will allow the largest shareholder to sell stock as soon as it becomes effective any day
now, increasing the supply of stock in the market and likely weighing on the price.


Investors need to be extremely cautious and ask critical questions of the company, with all
of these elements lining up to make me think OXBT needs to be flushed from the market:

Thank you, Pump Stopper for this extensively researched article! I don't need the headache, so I fully exited this stock
today based on your careful, informative research and recommendation of Strong Sell. I will certainly continue to
follow you. Thanks again :)

OXBT does not look like a short to me anyway , The security seems to be forming an uptrend in my opinion. do not
beleive everything you read on the net people

''do not beleive everything you read on the net people''.


Thanx. I won't. And your post is an excellent example.

Not to mention that he leaves out the fact that the FDA lifted the hold on Oxycyte in the last 3 months. 
The company has 60 million in cash. 
Most biotechs don't make a profit until a drug is approved. 
Levo is approved in 40 countries. 
OXBT is using Levo for another indication than Abbott was, LCOS for surgery.

$oxbt long ! They get paid by the navy division to do research plus a high ranking members of armed forces is in their

stock. Holding since 2013 June.

Remember to mention when the board bought shares and how! (Michael Jebsen, CFO purchased nearly 15,000
shares at $ 4.67)  
- Can you tell us about the subscription of the latest AK? It is fully subscribed? who bought these actions?  
The announcement of the first patient enrolled in Phase III is imminent now. I expect pleasant surprises and silence
Executive said he communicates advisedly. When they will start this phase 3, we assiterons a slow and steady rise of
the action in the three months that follow I think to reach $ 20 by September 2015.  
What do you think?
