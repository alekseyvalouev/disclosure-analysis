AFSI 3q14
Operating EPS:
$1.16 (Company
PR Uses Negative
Tax Rate)
Nov. 3, 2014 10:03 PM ET | Includes: AmTrust Financial Ser…


AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) decided to ignore taxes this
quarter.


AFSI reported $1.70 / share of operating earnings in the headline of their
press release. However, this EPS estimate incorporates a -5% tax rate as
opposed to the 28% tax rate to which the company the CFO guided on the
2q14 earnings call:


“ "And then, you would look at effective tax rate, if you remove thereduction of the Luxembourg DTL, to be something around 28% or so."
Note: 3q14 press release does not mention Luxembourg DTL reversals, so I
believe this is the right tax rate to use.


Below is how AFSI typically would have presented "Operating Earnings". To be
clear, this EPS number is before considering the potential accounting problems
AFSI discussed in Part II. My guess is that the earnings result would have been
substantially lower if not for a number of accounting issues discussed
elsewhere.
