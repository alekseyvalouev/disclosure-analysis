Funding Shortfall, Foundation Selling, And Flawed Structure Likely To
Result In Downward Spiral At AFSI
Nov. 28, 2014 12:46 PM ET14 comments

Summary


Funding Gap Will Likely Force AFSI Stock Offering Before Year-End (~11.3m
shares).


Recent Karfunkel Foundation Maneuver Unlikely to Solve the Excess Business
Holdings Problem (~12.1m shares).


Flawed Structure of ACP Re Creates “Vicious Cycle” Risk for AFSI (~6.0m shares &
up to $250m of write-downs at AFSI).


Summary:


AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) appears to have a strange combination
of circumstances that could result in the Company and insiders being forced sellers of as
much as 29.4 million shares, which would double the float (and be difficult to place).


In Section I, I discuss why I believe AFSI has a meaningful funding gap that will require a
significant common stock offering before year-end.


Section II covers the recent transfer of 7.2 million shares from the Hod Foundation to the
Teferes Foundation and why I suspect this transfer could backfire on the Karfunkels by
drawing regulatory scrutiny, thus accelerating the sale of approximately 12.1 million shares
of AFSI (including shares held by the Chesed Foundation of America).


In Section III, I discuss why I believe ACP Re poses a significant risk to AFSI and how
their interconnectedness could create a downward spiral in shares of AFSI resulting in the
forced sale of up to 6.0 million shares of AFSI and the write-off of up to $250 million in
AFSI assets associated with ACP Re.


I. AFSI's Funding Gap Could Prompt 11.3 million Share Offering Before Year-End


I believe AFSI has a substantial funding gap that will force the Company to issue
approximately 11.6 million shares of common stock before year-end to avoid being in
breach of a credit agreement and/or the NYDFS conditions.

The holding company AFSI has very few sources of readily available cash that it can use
to fund capital shortfalls at its subsidiaries, as demonstrated by its December 31, 2013
cash balance of $1.5 million and "Due to affiliates - net" of $207.5 million (2013 10-K, page
S-2).


In addition, it appears AFSI's holding company has done relatively little to generate or
raise cash that it could use to fund the capital requirements associated with the
Company's rapid growth:


However, AFSI's holding company will need to raise substantial cash before year-end if it
is to remain in compliance with its credit agreements and the NYDFS conditions.


While many of the items in the table above are straightforward, my estimates of the first
four items require further explanation.


First, I estimate that AFSI's U.S. insurance subsidiaries need capital injections of
approximately $336 million to avoid breaching a covenant of their credit agreement. The
primary drivers of this requirement are the rapid growth in premiums written (and
associated increases in reinsurance recoverables and reserves, all of which factor into the
RBC requirement) and the credit agreement covenant (see page 69) which requires
AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries' consolidated capital is at least 200% of the applicable "Company
Action Level RBC" (which is also 200%), or 400% of the consolidated authorized control
level RBC (emphasis added).

Risk-Based Capital. The Borrower will not permit "total adjusted capital" (within
the meaning of the Insurance Model Act as of the Effective Date) of ((x)) any of
its existing or future U.S. Regulated Insurance Companies, in each case as
determined as of the end of each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2014, to be less than 150.0% of the applicable "Company Action
Level RBC" (within the meaning of the Insurance Model Act) on an individual basis
for each such Regulated Insurance Company and ((y)) all of its existing and future
U.S. Regulated Insurance Companies, as determined as of the end of each
fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014, to be
less than 200.0% of the applicable "Company Action Level RBC" (within the
meaning of the Insurance Model Act) on a consolidated basis for all such
Regulated Insurance Companies.


As of December 31, 2013, AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries' authorized control level RBC was
approximately $198 million. Adjusted for acquisitions and dispositions, the authorized
control level RBC was approximately $201 million.


AFSI's substantial growth in 2014 will meaningfully increase the capital requirements of its
U.S. operations. An insurance company's RBC calculation is not public, but one can
estimate the change in an insurance company's RBC requirement based on publicly
available information.


I think it's safe to say the primary drivers of AFSI's RBC are components R3 (credit risk,
ie: reinsurance), R4 (reserve risk) and R5 (premiums written risk). In each case, AFSI's
U.S. subsidiaries are on track to grow in excess of 50% (NPW growth is tracking ~100%
year over year).


For simplicity, I chose to use AFSI's overall NPW growth (60.9%) as a proxy for the
increase in capital requirements. As such, I estimate that the authorized control level RBC
requirement will be approximately $323.4 million thus making the credit agreement
requirement approximately $1,293.6 million.


The statutory filings of AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries show the consolidated statutory capital
stood at $931.2 million. Applying the year-to-date ROE to the current balance for an
additional quarter implies statutory capital would be approximately $957.4 million at year
end if there were no capital injections into AFSI's U.S. insurance subsidiaries - a $336.2
million shortfall against its credit agreement.

One might be tempted to shrug off the covenant breach since AFSI has not borrowed on
its revolver, but that would miss the highly important letters of credit that AFSI uses to
support its intra-company reinsurance arrangements. Therefore, a material covenant
breach imperils the entire complex since the holding company does not have the liquidity
to meet capital requirements if it loses access to credit.


Second, AFSI will have to inject a significant amount of capital into AII (its Bermuda
reinsurance captive) to cover the capital deficit created by the Company's growth in
premiums (which directly drives the "minimum solvency margin" per page 33 of AFSI's 10-
K) and the NYDFS condition that requires AII become less reliant upon "line 4 of the AII
statutory balance sheet" (equity in affiliates - see "AFSI AmTrust Financial Services: A
P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I").


Finally, AFSI will need to raise capital to increase the collateralization rate of its ING credit
facility it has in place to support the underwriting of its Lloyd's of London subsidiary from
50% to 100% since it has not received an extension of this credit agreement.

10.2 Full Collateralisation Date


The Full Collateralisation Date in respect of a Full Collateralisation Event shall be:


 (NYSE:A) in the case of the Full Collateralisation Event described in Clause 10.3


(Non-extension), the fifth Banking Day following 31 December 2014;


…


10.3 Full Collateralisation Events


Each of the following events shall constitute a Full Collateralisation Event:


…


  Non-extension: The Banks do not agree by 31 December 2014 to extend this


Agreement so that it permits the issue of Letters of Credit with a term beyond 31


December 2017.


As disclosed in AFSI's most recent 10-Q, AFSI has $317.2 million letters of credit
outstanding on this facility, so increasing the collateralization rate from 50% to 100% will
require $158.6 million of high quality collateral from AFSI's holding company, which
it does not have.


The combined effects of higher capital requirements for insurance subsidiaries and the
increased collateral requirement suggest that AFSI will have a sizeable funding shortfall at
year-end unless it raises significant capital. However, it can only issue $100 million of
subordinated debt due to restrictions in its unsecured credit agreement (JP Morgan), and
AFSI's use of the revolver is limited by its outstanding letters of credit, as well as its debt-
to-capitalization covenants. As a result, AFSI will have to raise preferred or common
equity.


AFSI has been a frequent issuer of preferred stock in 2013 and 2014, issuing $300 million
of perpetual preferred, including $185 million already in 2014. The previous issuances
may limit AFSI's ability to issue much more preferred stock though.

I estimate that if AFSI is able to issue $100 million of subordinated debt, draw $150 million
on its revolver, and issue $50 million of preferred stock, it will still have a funding shortfall
of approximately $451.9 million that will need to be met with the issuance of common
equity. In light of the significant increase in float, I have assumed that shares would be
sold at $40 each, which I think would be a fortunate outcome for the Company given the
sizeable increase in float that would represent (not to mention the myriad red flags I have
discussed in various articles).


II. Karfunkel Foundations' Excess Business Holdings Could Prompt ~12.1m Share Sale


Roddy Boyd of the Southern Investigative Research Foundation wrote an interesting
article in August ("The Mitzvah Factory") that highlighted the problematic nature of Michael
(Chairman of AFSI) and George (Director of AFSI) Karfunkel's foundations holdings in
AFSI.


Specifically, Boyd noted that the Hod Foundation ("Hod") and the Chesed Foundation of
America ("Chesed"), controlled by Michael Karfunkel and George Karfunkel, respectively,
had exceeded the holding amounts and holding periods for AFSI (emphasis added).


Boyd's article takes on increased importance in light of the Friday night 13D filing which
disclosed a transfer of Hod's shares to the Teferes Foundation ("Teferes"). Teferes is
controlled by Michael Karfunkel's son-in-law Barry Zyskind - the CEO of AFSI:


On November 12, 2014, the Hod Foundation, a charitable foundation controlled by
Michael Karfunkel, donated all of its 7,216,773 shares of Common Stock to the
Teferes Foundation.


However, Boyd seems to have anticipated such a form-over-substance transfer in his
article. In fact, Boyd noted that the shares could not be sold (ed: or transferred) to a
disqualified person, such as Zyskind's Teferes (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2717635-funding-shortfall-foundation-selling-and-flawed-structure-likely-to-result-in-downward-spiral-at-afsi 7/13


The rule that emerged to combat this is IRS section 4943 and it is primarily
concerned with the idea of excess business holdings, or the amount of stock a
private foundation can own - Here is an accessible primer on key aspects of the rule
- when so-called disqualified persons (the founder, directors, their family members
and key donors) have significant holdings too.


Traditionally the IRS mandates a bit of arithmetic to get to the foundations "permitted
holdings" figure - the formula being 20 percent of the shares outstanding less the
percentage of stock held by disqualified persons. In this case the Karfunkel family
and their controlled entities own about 59 percent, making the point moot.


Under a provision of rule 4943 there is a second approach, known as the "de
minimus rule," with each foundation permitted to hold 2 percent of the shares
outstanding, meaning that Hod and Chesed could hold slightly more than 1.5 million
each.


It is difficult to interpret the IRS rules as meaning anything other than a lot of
AmTrust stock needs to be sold or donated away - about 6.4 million shares for
Chesed and 5.7 million shares for Hod, nearly 16 percent of the shares
outstanding.


There is a catch, and as catches go, it is a significant one: the AmTrust stock
that Hod and Chesed need to sell cannot be sold to those same disqualified
persons, meaning that neither the brothers nor their families can bid for any
shares the others foundation is forced to sell. (A second option is for the
shares to be donated to an unaffiliated public charity, like the Red Cross, who
would almost certainly begin selling the shares upon delivery.)


In light of Boyd's anticipatory research and the basic intuition that the Chairman of a
company could not get around a tax law by transferring shares to his son-in-law CEO, it
seems likely that the Karfunkel/Zyskind foundations will still have to sell shares to be in
compliance with IRC 4943.


In addition, the recent transfer (seemingly in response to Boyd's article) could bring
increased scrutiny of the Karfunkel foundations' holdings of AFSI by the IRS or the
NY Attorney General, and, should Boyd prove correct, Teferes and Chesed could be
forced sellers of 12.1 million shares - exacerbating the pressure from any stock
offering that results from the shortfall I discussed in Section I.

III. ACP Re's Highly Levered Balance Sheet and Concentration in AFSI Could Prompt
Additional Forced Selling & Write-Downs at AFSI


ACP Re, a private company controlled by the Karfunkels, appears to have been initially
capitalized with shares of AFSI before partaking in a quota share agreement with National
General Holdings (NASDAQ:NGHC) and, more recently, acquiring Tower Group.


According to AFSI's proxy, ACP Re owned 6.05 million shares of AFSI. Based on the AM
Best's credit report on ACP Re, the AFSI shares comprised over half of ACP Re's assets
and equated to over two-thirds of its approximately $300 million equity as of December 31,
2013. Needless to say, the success of ACP Re is tied to AFSI's stock price performance.
However, prior to ACP Re's acquisition of Tower Group International, Ltd.
(NASDAQ:TWGP), ACP did not employ much leverage in the form of debt or insurance
liabilities. As such, ACP Re could have arguably held the AFSI shares indefinitely no
matter what happened to AFSI's stock price.


Then ACP Re purchased TWGP.


By the time ACP Re closed on the acquisition, TWGP had a tangible book value that was
approximately negative $100 million. To make matters worse, ACP Re paid TWGP
shareholders $143 million and had to pay off the maturing convertible bond. As a result,
ACP Re's nearly unlevered position in shares of AFSI has become hyper-levered.


To fund its purchase of TWGP and have collateral to post against its reinsurance
obligations, ACP Re borrowed $250 million from AFSI and NGHC ($125 million each).
ACP Re also entered into a circular reinsurance agreement with AFSI and NGHC whereby
ACP Re's subsidiary, CastlePoint Re (a former TWGP subsidiary) would reinsure the U.S.
operations against adverse development with a 100% stop-loss reinsurance agreement
with AII (if commercial lines) who will then reinsure 100% with ACP Re. The end result of
this arrangement is that AII (and therefore AFSI) bear credit risk with ACP Re of up to
$125 million.


Since ACP Re's assets are substantially invested in AFSI shares and because ACP Re
has very little equity, the $250 million of credit risk AFSI has towards ACP Re ($125 million
loan & $125 million stop loss reinsurance) is a real risk.


AFSI's risk towards ACP Re also has the risk of creating a downward spiral in AFSI
shares.


Consider the following scenario:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2717635-funding-shortfall-foundation-selling-and-flawed-structure-likely-to-result-in-downward-spiral-at-afsi 9/13


1. AFSI issues shares to bridge a year-end funding gap, but the offering requires a
significant discount and shares trade down 25% or more from recent levels;


2. AFSI's auditors worry that the loan to ACP Re is impaired due to the limited equity at
ACP Re and force AFSI to write-down the loan to $100 million ($25 million charge),
causing shares to fall further;


3. ACP Re incurs adverse development on TWGP's workers' comp reserves, triggering
the stop-loss agreement for $50 million;


4. AFSI, who purchased the renewal rights to TWGP's commercial lines has claims come
in higher than expected, pressuring earnings on top of a further loan write-down and
the write-down of reinsurance recoverables due from ACP Re;


5. Claim payments and collateral requirements strain ACP Re's balance sheet, prompting
ACP Re to sell shares of AFSI;


6. Shareholders of AFSI lose confidence in the Company's risk management and sell
shares down further, eliminating any remaining ACP Re equity as adverse
development continues at ACP RE;


7. At this point, AFSI will have to write-off most, if not all of its remaining $125 million loan
to ACP Re and its $125 million of reinsurance recoverables from ACP Re. In addition,
ACP Re will likely be forced to sell any of its remaining shares.


Conclusion:


I and others have raised significant questions about AFSI's accounting and business
practices. Now it appears the Karfunkels' financial engineering may be coming back to
haunt them.


Specifically, the holding company faces a funding gap into year-end that likely requires a
common stock offering of in excess of 10 million shares at the same time that their private
foundations could be forced sellers of 12 million shares.


This one-two punch of sizeable selling could prove to be the trigger of AFSI's downfall.
Should that be the case, ACP Re could exacerbate the situation by creating a third leg of
forced selling that also creates write-down risk of up to $250 million for AFSI.


It should be an interesting December for AFSI.


Reiterate price target: $0.

"the AmTrust stock that Hod and Chesed need to sell cannot be sold to those same disqualified persons." Maybe I'm
simplistic in my thinking, but generally where there's a will, there's a way. Why wouldn't the K's have an unaffiliated
friend or attorney act as a straw man to accept a donation of shares? Or create an offshore trust that's controlled by
who knows who? to receive the donation,. etc. just seems like someone with a clever attorney could figure something
out.

Author’s reply »  Micro_Cap_Maven,


What you're suggesting as a solution to the Karfunkels' excess business holdings problem is tax fraud.


If that is the solution the Karfunkels go with, they would have even bigger problems. Further, if they distribute
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares to avoid selling them or paying substantial tax penalties, I'm
confident someone will seek answers as to who is behind the recipients of those shares.


Why do the Karfunkels seek a loophole rather than simply addressing the problem? Perhaps they are
desperate to avoid the shares hitting the market because of other implications for the Karfunkel complex of
companies (ie: ACP Re's net worth going negative and triggering losses at AFSI as discussed in my article)?

The only desperation here seems to be the Karfunkels' desperation to avoid selling or distributing shares they
are required to by tax laws. Why is that??


I find it odd that you are more interested in the author than the content of the article. You allude to
connections for which you have no basis.


To be clear, I have consistently disclosed my short position. GeoInvesting disclosed they had a short position
when they wrote about AFSI in December 2013. SIRF disclosed that they do not have a position, but that
GeoInvesting had been a donor (though GeoInvesting was not a source and was not informed prior to the
release). I have no such connection.

Why is it that you never address the content of the articles in your comments?


Your focus on the messenger rather than the message is wearing thin and seems to be exactly what AFSI's

The company simply needs to address the issues. In my opinion, their unwillingness (or inability) to do so
speaks volumes.

While I appreciate the persistence and the zeal of these attacks on AFSI, the company has addressed all of the
accusations with an abundance of information.


As bbmaven has correctly identified, it does appear oddly coincidental that unusual activity in the options market in
the past has preceeded these attack pieces. After the company refutes them, the temporary hit to the stock price

released, then they could profit nicely from that blip to the downside.


It is also worth noting that these accusations are having less and less impact as they have been so roundly refuted by
the company and objective analysts. That is probably to everyone's long term benefit, not just with AFSI but also other
stocks that could be vulnerable to similar coordinated attacks (if that is indeed what is occurring).

I have to agree with Gotham on one point...there are attacks against Gotham but no questioning the validity of the
comments. Gotham has put down a specific date on the cash shortfall, so we will see how accurate that becomes.


A few questions for Gotham. Does ACP Re have any third party reinsurance deals that could be jeopardized if they go
insolvent? What would NGHC impact be on $125 million ACP Re credit risk? Have you evaluated NGHC? It appears
there are a bunch of Karfunkels there too making big $...same MO on acquisitions and miraculous turnaround in a
hyper competitive space, without serious management talent.

Actually I believe "the validity of the comments" are entirely questioned as they have been completely refuted
over the past year or so (beginning with GeoInvesting and now this similar line of attack). Hard to have a
more thorough record.

Author’s reply »  Please point to this "complete refutation".


I've reviewed every public disclosure available and despite very similar assertions from the company, I have
seen no reconciliations of Luxembourg, nor a bridge of how/why their DAC is anomalous, nor any SEC filing
disclosure of their supposed "reserves" for LSC, nor...the list goes on.


Their responses have been a joke. December 2013 - no q&a. February 2014 - Barron's catches them in lie on
DAC / AFSI changes story (fake or real losses, Barry?). May/June 2014 - response to Barron's validates,
rather than refutes bear case. August - laughably inadequate answers to SIRF.


Now they try to ignore questions and subsequently claim they've answered them (or their minions do it for
them). Nice try...if they allowed anyone besides the cheerleaders (sell-side) ask questions on conference
calls, MAYBE we'd get a real question now and then...

I'm confident that AFSI will blow-up. The only question is whether it's tomorrow or 18 months from now.
