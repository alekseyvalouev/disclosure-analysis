The ExOne Company: Irrational Exuberance Obscures Black Clouds
Building Around 3-D Printing
Aug. 28, 2013 3:43 PM ET29 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


The ExOne Company's (XONE) surprise stock offering last week irritated investors. The 3-
D printer maker is diluting investors' shares to raise millions just six months after its public
offering.


But the company has buried reasons for even more irritation deep within the S1
registration papers it filed after the bell Aug. 21. The chief executive and his interests get
far more money under this deal than the company itself.


It's roughly $100 million for him versus $72 million for the company. That's 1.55 million
shares and 1.1 million shares respectively at an estimated $65 per share listed in the
filing. The registration papers specify the shares will be offered by the company and by
"selling stockholders." A dig through the gibberish reveals those "selling stockholders" are
actually CEO Kent Rockwell - through his two entities and trust.


Funny timing on that trust. Exactly one day before the offering announcement, Mr.
Rockwell, through an entity, boldly gave his trust 450,000 shares worth about $30 million.


The stock reached $70 on the day he gave away the shares. As is common, share prices
dropped right after the company announced the offering, briefly hitting below $65. The
stock price closed Tuesday at $70.04.


And there's more to this trust arrangement. Mr. Rockwell himself ultimately stands to
benefit yearly from his charitable deed.


The "remainder trust" benefits Lafayette College, Rockwell's alma mater. It requires
Lafayette to pay Rockwell's entity 5 percent of the trust's assets each year for 10 years
(likely over $1 million the first year). Whatever's left over after a decade goes to Lafayette.

Once approved, the stock offering could also include up to 398,400 additional shares held
by Rockwell's entities, President David Burns (whose total 2012 compensation exceeded
$3.5 million), Chief Financial Officer John Irvin (whose compensation exceeded $1.8
million) and two other execs. These are over-allotment shares exercisable within 30 days
of the offering if the public demand is high enough.


The other millions of shares are locked up for 90 days or the end of November.


Yet another lockup release date hits just around the corner in early September. One
minute before midnight on Friday, Aug. 30 is when the 180-day post initial public offering
lockup expires, potentially unleashing more than 7 million shares onto the market. The
lockup release initially set for Aug. 5 was delayed until after the company reported its 2Q
earnings in mid-August.


At nosebleed valuations, the company and Mr. Rockwell are likely to sell far more stock
than if the valuation had been depressed.


Personal piggy bank


XONE reported proceeds of about $92 million from the initial public offering in February.
But about $16.6 million of this went into Mr. Rockwell's pockets through his entities for
things such as land payments, and repayment of loans and one entity's entire debt. He
also sold more than $10.2 million of stock in the IPO.


After subtracting costs such as offering expenses, our figures show XONE realized IPO
proceeds of about $63.3 million. The initial public offering made Mr. Rockwell about $26.8
million richer.


Indeed, Mr. Rockwell seems to be having a lot of success in making XONE his own
personal piggy bank. The two offerings potentially could make him $97 million to $127
million wealthier at these levels.


Mr. Rockwell's ownership has gone from 71.1 percent pre-IPO to about 22-23 percent or
over 3 million shares, according to the filing. They're currently worth somewhere around
$200 million. Yet he's apparently not afraid to pinch pennies - he charges XONE hundreds
of thousands of dollars for the use of his entity's airplane and services.

The offering deals are just more black clouds building on top of the past six stormy
months. The stock has risen on hopes and fallen on missed earnings its entire public
existence.


"This is the kind of company you want to buy when you've had 15 cups of coffee and 20
hours of sleep," said analyst Fred Russell of Fredric E. Russell Investment Management
Co. "It's the kind of company you approach with a little bit of naiveté and a great deal of
enthusiasm."


Investors caught up in the 3-D printer hype have been buying XONE since it went public at
$18. The stock has rocketed in the last six months. Just yesterday, CNBC analysts
commented on XONE, briefly sending the price back above $71.


But we think the company faces more share-zapping storms, particularly since we believe
its technology is inferior. Indeed, TheStreetSweeper's sources have talked with
representatives of companies that bought XONE's machines. And some don't even use
them. Additionally, one aeronautics company uses XONE for prototyping but reported it
likely wouldn't buy another machine because - like the stock itself - they are too expensive
at up to $1.4 million.


Other companies report skepticism that the 3-D industry's prototypes and production parts
will ever meet their needs. For example, GE Aviation, a part of the world's biggest
manufacturer GE (NYSE:GE) is choosing to build its own 3-D printers so it can print bits
for jet engines - and eventually other needs - rather than buying one from XONE.


An ice cream maker owns an XONE 3-D printer that sounds about as useful on the plant
floor as a museum exhibit.


One of our sources asked a plant manager, "Do you ever use it?"


"No. I can make the part faster on my own," said the manager.


"What if the part doesn't work?" our source then asked.


"I'll just make a second part," the manager replied.


Primarily using heavy sand in the case of XONE, the 3-D printers use computer images to
print, layer by layer, three-dimensional objects. The company's pokey biggest printer, Max,
takes 24 hours to print just one job.

XONE's printer is also distinguished in that it is an MIT brainchild, the company boasts.
But it's also old technology - 17 years old - a real dinosaur in technology-years. And
forebodingly, the technology is so ancient that XONE shows no signs of having to fend off
any patent infringers who like the technology enough to bother copying it.


Mr. Rockwell even hinted at a lack of confidence in his company's technology. "Obviously,
we have to enhance our machine technology," Mr. Rockwell said during the last earnings
call.


Our sources visited XONE's factory and were amazed to see that behind a roped-off area
about 10 employees were tediously hand-building one single printer. It would take six
weeks to make just one of these million-dollar babies, visitors were told. Six weeks. Such
a handcrafting feat undoubtedly would be impossible if XONE ever wanted to mass
produce the machines.


But everything suggests the demand will never justify mass producing these machines,
anyway. Our sources found that the potential customers they spoke with would be
interested only in machines that produce functional products rather than just molds or
prototypes or some sort of plastic sample.


Suppliers have some misgivings, too. Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has been selling printing heads
to the 3-D industry for a decade, according to CNBC.


"I just think the (additive manufacturing) market will be small (for Xerox)," said Kevin
Lewis, head of Xerox's 3-D initiatives.


Buried in hopeful commentary, XONE executives themselves nervously acknowledged
that customers are struggling with the company's machines.


"And so while we feel we've made dramatic progress in terms of our ability to appeal to
the industrial base in terms of quality and in terms of the cost per piece that we're
manufacturing, we are finding customers that are struggling a little bit to find ways to
implement what we can sell them," Mr. Burns, the president, said during the last earnings
call.


So, trouble's mounting as customers, suppliers and even execs voice doubts about this
technology. And, sadly for XONE, nobody's going to be lining up to buy old, expensive
technology.


A perfect storm

"You have to feel invincible. You have to feel nothing could go wrong with your
investment," in considering a company like XONE, said Mr. Russell. "Nothing had better
go wrong considering this type of price-to-earnings ratio," he said.


XONE's estimated price-to-earnings ratio for 12 months ending in December 2013 is a
staggering 2000-plus, according to FactSet. And for 2014, XONE's estimated ratio of 111
is still ominous enough to set off the tornado sirens. That's about three times higher than
its rivals and about seven times higher than the overall industry.


Mr. Russell said it reminded him of the Internet boom.


He recalled the days when Yahoo sold for $150 a share during the Internet bubble. A
couple years later, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) pretty well shoved the company aside and
Yahoo's stock got stomped back to under $13. Now both are in the $27 to $33 range.


Even if XONE's P/E ratio doesn't zap out that invincible feeling from investors right now,
it's definitely another black cloud in the perfect storm that we believe is fast approaching.


Always volatile, the 3-D printer stock prices rocketed Aug. 26 when a Citigroup analyst
commented favorably and initiated coverage of DDD and SSYS. In July, the whole 3-D
group got beaten down when a report hit suggesting ultra fine particles emitted during use
may pose health risks. This is a big question mark that likely translates to the group
having to take measures - probably expensive ones - at some point to address those
concerns.


The 3-D printer sector appears to be in a bubble. That bubble could burst at any time,
soaking investors.


Our research suggests that two companies will dominate after this 3-D storm calms down.
And we believe XONE will be left out.


Competition gets the razor-razor blade model


Market leader 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) just stepped out in front with its plan to get
printers into homes and small businesses. In May, Staples announced it became the first
major retailer to stock 3-D printers when it began selling DDD's Cube for $1,300. Japan's
huge retailer Yamada Denki also began selling the Cube.


So DDD got the critical jump in this market. This is the area grabbing all the headlines -
the mainstreaming of a technology that has been around some three decades.

We're seeing the economic "razor/razor blade" model in action with DDD. The Cube uses
material cartridges that cost a pricey $49.99 and the Cube PLA plastic cartridge in silver is
"Not compatible with 1st generation Cube printer." Furthermore, the printer jet head
replacement costs $249.99 and is compatible with only the second generation Cube
printer.


So investors can see that users of DDD printing machines become loyalists by necessity.
They buy the printers and get locked into constantly buying expensive cartridges for it,
plus an occasional jet head.


During the recent earnings call, DDD execs said demand for the Cube and Cube X
trounced expectations so much so that the company expanded its manufacturing lines a
second time. Indeed, DDD's products pushed the growth rate to 58 percent over six
months for recurring revenue.


Likewise, the leader in 3D printing materials, Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) offers
proprietary supplies that represent a growing recurring revenue stream. SSYS, which
recently acquired Makerbot, enjoys recurring revenue through the sales of its resin and
plastic consumables.


This recurring revenue disappointment is thanks to XONE's comparatively crotchety
technology, dependence on print shops which can't really offer competitive recurring
revenue and the limitations of primarily using that heavy, difficult-to-transport sand in its
process.


As engineer Brian Smith ably put it: "... the vast majority (of) XONE's business revolves
around creating sand molds into which molten metal can be poured to create usable parts.
Unfortunately for 3D printing bulls (and XONE), it takes about 16 hours for each print to
harden, two full days for each print to fully cure, and each sand-casting can be used to
create just one usable part! Two days for one part!"


XONE announced in late July that it added iron infused with bronze to its materials
portfolio. We applaud this but realize it could be mostly hype. A year-old article we found
mentioned XONE's use of bronze at that time. And a source said XONE was using bronze
infusion when he visited the Pennsylvania factory in June. Besides, an announcement
worthy of investors' attention should have said a certain number of related orders are
pending. Absent that detail, investors are forced to conclude the press release lacks
substance.

XONE recently announced adding another printing material, tungsten. Announced just
before the disappointing earnings release, this press release was more positive because
XONE said the bonded tungsten use is tied to the pending sale of its cheaper $350,000
machine M-Flex to rapid prototype + manufacturing or "rp+m." But XONE's filing says this
is the only M-Flex it has ever sold.


Unfortunately for XONE, customers looking for 3-D metal printing may choose from
numerous public and private companies - including 3D Systems, Electro Optical Systems
and ARCAM AB.


XONE sells just four? Can it really sell 20 more this year?


The company just sells a few of its expensive units in a quarter. By a few we mean four.


That's right. XONE sold only four printing machines in the second quarter. That's the
number sold the previous quarter, plus a cheaper laser machine sold in the first quarter.
The previous quarter, eight machines were sold. XONE primarily blamed European
weakness in 1Q and yen weakness plus two machine sales that fell through in 2Q.


"And those two sales are simply not going to happen this year," Mr. Burns explained to
obviously concerned analysts during the earnings call.


XONE's president continued, " ... we had anticipated a couple of more machines being in
the third quarter. It's not clear to me now that those programs are going to book out in the
third quarter."


It looks like XONE is facing the monumental task of selling roughly 18 to 20 machines the
next six months in order to hit the minimum 2013 revenue forecast of $48 million.


Can XONE really average nine to 10 machine sales in the next two quarters? The
executive's comments and company history suggest it's extremely unlikely.


XONE focuses on printers for industries such as aerospace, automotive, heavy equipment
and liquid and gas transmission - most of which have had difficulties and may face more
of the same in the soft economy.


But DDD and SSYS boast highly diversified price points and uses that include prototyping,
dentistry, healthcare, and research and development. And as Canaccord Genuity notes -
they ship hundreds of units each and every quarter.


Here's a rough comparison of some interesting recent metrics, available here and here
and here:

SSYS 104 1,155 215m - .55 13


DDD 49 1,010 415m + .43 13


No surprise that XONE's disappointing sales produced such underwhelming earnings in
both quarters this year. Both revenue and earnings missed analyst estimates.


Everything considered, we wouldn't be surprised to see the same thing happen in 3Q.
Absent changed estimates, we could see yet another miss in 4Q.


We wouldn't even be buyers of DDD and SSYS at current levels. But at least they're
bigger and have about 10 times more employees, revenues, resources and, arguably,
vision than XONE.


Hello, Bull


Strip the "sexy" out of 3-D, tame the bull market and before you know it, the real deal
shines through with companies like XONE.


"Exciting technologies seem particularly exciting during bull markets. Everyone drops their
guard. Everyone believes the world will be revolutionized quickly," said Mr. Russell.


With all the irrational exuberance, the price-to-earnings ratios get bid up to absurd highs,
like XONE's 2000-plus ratio.


"You've got to really, really have a lot of faith when you buy something with 2000-
something times earnings," said Mr. Russell.


"I haven't had that much faith in a long time. Maybe I'm drinking the wrong kind of coffee,"
he said.


Even companies with exciting technologies can get a good soaking, he said. Apple and its
iPhone seemed invincible two years ago - and then along came Samsung (OTC:SSNLF)
to stir up things.


"Barnes and Noble (NYSE:BKS) was once thought to have a concept that would
guarantee profits for decades," Mr. Russell said.


Along came Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and almost put the bookstore out of business,
along with Borders.

"You don't want to pay too much for an exciting technology. I certainly don't. I want a
reasonable price for proven technology," Mr. Russell said. He added that XONE should
sell for less than half its current price.


Like Mr. Russell, Citron Research presents some amusing and cogent thoughts about the
3-D bubble.


"We are not claiming that direct digital manufacturing has no place in the
industrial landscape and that it won't grow incrementally as new technology
enables new applications," Citron wrote. "We simply observe that appearances
have become completely unhinged from reality when it comes to the mania
created in so-called 3D printing stocks, and 3D Systems in particular."

Conclusion


Like the 1990's dot-com bubble collapse that sent screaming high-fliers slamming back to
earth, these 3-D printing companies - particularly XONE - likely face a killer storm.

As people like 3D Printing Investor is well aware of the Arcam EBM systems (more than 100 systems installed across
the world) are up and running,  producing parts such as "high end" orthopedic implants. XOne has a long way to go
before (if ever) it is there. See e.g.: http://bit.ly/140j6eo

Also see Christopher Barnatt's thoughts on ExOne binder jetting vs. Arcam Electron Beam Melting in an
interview out today:


Ever hear of "3D Printing- The Next Industrial Revolution?"


He wrote the book- literally.


And he also says Arcam AB and their EBM technology is superior to the binder jetting used by ExOne.

I don't own any XONE stock and do not plan to buy XONE in the next 72 hours. Your article sounds like something a
jilted lover would write.  
Do you have any connection to XONE or any senior management at XONE.  
The reality is that all the major players have stock that is overvalued.  
I am buying because I believe that 3D technology is the future of manufacturing. From my business days as a VP of
sales I know a number of major manufactures installing either DDD, SSYS and even some XONE printers for major
tests.  
GE may build their own printer but someone else may own the patent on the technology. Anyway even GE has
installed printers for tests in a number of different business. We are at the beginning of a major change in
manufacturing. I expect a rough ride for all 3D stocks over the next year but three or four years from now I expect a
major pay day. Only time will tell. Oh, my dentist just ordered a printer for his practice. He is going to a training class
in a few weeks.  
I have started to accumulate significant number of shares in DDD and SSYS. Sold all of my XONE about a week or
two ago at over $72.

Excellent piece describing the problems XONE is facing. We really think the stock is trading at absurd multiples here.
As we conveyed in our article: http://seekingalpha.co...


For instance Xone trades at a TTM price to sales ratio of around 24X, versus SSYS at 12.5x, and DDD at 12. So
XONE's share price is based on a price to sales ratio is twice as high as the leaders in the industry. Given it only has
a niche market one would think it would trade at a discount to average industry sales.

Insider lock-up has been extended 90 days from the effective date of the announced offering from last week. I
have confirmed this with ExOne's investor relations department with is outsourced to Kei Advisors LLC.


From Kei Advisors:


"The announced offering delays the lock -up expiration by 90 days from the offering date. While the offering
has been announced, we are awaiting SEC approval and then we can go effective, at which time it will price."

I not only own ExOne's stock, I also purchased and will deploy the first commercially available M-Flex metals machine
from ExOne. Their technology is game changing, because of the possibility to produce small volume production
without the need for tooling, and create designs that are not possible in traditional manufacturing processes, such as
consolidating several parts into one or designs that are not possible to manufacture in traditional manufacturing
methods. 
Comparing ExOne to Arcam is like comparing apples and oranges. Arcam's technology is engineered and designed
for small, precise applications such as medical device implants, surgical tools, and aerospace applications. If you
want to benchmark Arcam, look at EOS. Their technology DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering), is a head to head
competitor.


ExOne does not have a true competitor in the additive space, specifically in metals additive. ExOne's technology is
revolutionary because of the size and materials they offer. You can produce larger parts, such as replacement parts
for castings, forgings, assemblies and tooling in production applications. The benefit of this technology, is that
traditional manufacturing processes for making the final part is very time consuming, labor intensive and requires
capital investments in tooling, patterns, secondary machining and finishing (labor intensive and extended lead times).

Not sure if you've seen this article Matt, but there appears to be more than a few who are not impressed by
ExOne's technology:

Also, DMLS is more closely related to binder jetting than it is EBM.


01 Sep 2013, 09:13 PM


Matt Hlavin
Gary, I did see that article. It looks like a liberal rant on capitalism, rather than focusing on the technology and
how it is going to evolve manufacturing, specifically, American manufacturing, which will create higher paying
jobs, thus re-establishing the middle class. ExOne specifically, is an American company, creating American
jobs, in the beaten down manufacturing sector. If anything, we should be celebrating their story, as long as
they continue to deliver.


Sonya’s concern about the payout for the executives, is not an invalid point. But, did she research the
investments that ExOne has announced? They are building a facility in Germany to support the European
market, from a sales and technical support perspective. They are adding PSC’s (part service centers) across
the US and adding facilities in Asia and South America. They are also adding resources in PA to be able to
support mass production of their machines and advance their technology through strategic partnerships.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1662762-the-exone-company-irrational-exuberance-obscures-black-clouds-building-around-3-d-printing 14/18


My objection to dragging ExOne's body through town, is that most of the critics, including the bloggers and
journalists that are so quick to pass judgement, do not understand this technology. They want to criticize the
financial successes of the leaders who created these technologies, rather than focus on what these
technologies can create and how these technologies will change paradigm of manufacturing. They are taking
snippets of information and making pretty damning statements rather than doing the due diligence to
understand what these technologies offer. Not one of these critics contacted the company that was mentioned
in their last earnings call, rapid prototype + manufacturing (rp+m) to do further fact finding before publishing
their articles. So how well do they really understand what they are criticizing?


I am the founder and CEO of rp+m, who was mentioned in ExOne's earnings call who bought the 1st M-Flex
machine. We have also own EOS' M-280 DMLS machine and will be adding Arcam's EBM technology as well
as others technologies (EOS’s SLS technology). We also own every technology that Stratasys offers, and
produce parts out of every material (for prototyping and production). Each technology has been developed to
provide different solutions, as you well know.


To your second point, ExOne's metals binder jetting technology stands alone, and is unjustly compared to
DMLS and EBM. ExOne’s metals binder jetting technology has been commercialized to create solutions for
more industrial applications. There are no lasers in this technology, the binding of the powder is completely
different than DMLS or EBM. The applications this technology provides solutions for can be similar to the
above mentioned technologies, but are not intended to create orthopedic implants for example. The
production speeds are much faster than DMLS or EBM. The open architecture of their metals machines
allows for more materials to be commercialized faster.


ExOne’s specific focus on industrial applications is very relevant, as these applications can be
commercialized much quicker than medical device and aerospace applications due to the stringent testing
and validation requirements. The industrial market has a much broader offering, including service parts for
machines that are no longer available due to the small companies that produced these parts are no longer in
business.


The size limitations and speeds in EBM and DMLS at this time prohibit additional applications like tooling for
traditional processes such as injection molding, blow molding and casting. Binder jetting allows for this, and
compliments the traditional manufacturing processes to produce higher volume products out of more
materials than additive offers today (examples like tooling cavities and cores for injection molding).


If you or anyone is interested in better understanding ExOne’s technology, why not ask the customer, who is
not biased. I can be reached at mhlavin@rpplusm.com.

Thank you for the information Matt,


I believe I do understand the technology. It's something I've invested a great deal of time in researching as an
active investor in the industry.


Also, (to be frank), you're not a "customer" in the traditional sense. You are a reseller, so you are naturally
biased.

I think PriceWaterhouse is a better arbiter of the advantages of EBM vs. DMLS vs. binder jetting from an
investment perspective:


http://bit.ly/16bHl9I


When looking at defense and aerospace (and in the future automotive applications like 3D printed TiAl
turbochargers), EBM technology is superior to binder jetting.


- EBM uses an electron beam as the energy source, not a laser. This gives a much higher power capacity,
today up to 3500 W and the future even considerably higher, which is advantageous in several ways.


 
- EBM builds in vacuum, not in a protective gas. The vacuum ensures very high purity of the material, which is
of great importance in for example implant manufacture. Building in vacuum also enables to work with
reactive materials such as titanium without reaction with oxygen, which otherwise would cause alpha casing
and contaminate the unused powder. Instead, the Arcam Powder Recovery System enables to recycle any
unused powder, and use it for new builds (saving you money).


 
- Thanks to its high power capacity EBM can build at a high temperature in the build chamber, typically about
700 C for titanium. This gives a fine microstructure, high ductility and good fatigue characteristics. It also
mitigates residual mechanical stresses, enabling you to build large parts without any subsequent warping or
dimensional change.


 
- Its high power capacity means that EBM can melt the powder faster, giving you a higher build speed. This
becomes increasingly important when you move from Rapid Prototyping into Rapid Manufacturing, where
productivity becomes a major factor.


So, thank you for the offer to better understand this technology, but I do know where my investment dollar are
going, and it's not with ExOne's technology, or their unattractive fundamentals, share dilution and lowered
revenue guidance for 2013.


02 Sep 2013, 11:13 PM


Matt Hlavin
Great synopsis of EBM's technology Gary. From researching your work, it looks like you are fond of their
technology, and have taken time to understand the specific market applications EBM is designed to produce.
That that was not the point of the article, nor my response. You have an agenda to try and influence the stock,
so you can make money on shorting it. I get it, short the stock because the market is emotional right now, and
if you can influence trading, you win.


Secondly, your understanding of being a customer is inaccurate. I do not sell the equipment, rather I acquired
the technology for a specific use, different than EBM. Your analogy is like saying that when you purchase a
particular oven, let's say a GE oven, and make cookies to sell at a bake sale, you are now a re-seller of the
GE oven.

Thanks Matt for the clarification of your position as a customer. I appreciate it and understand where you're
coming from better.


Incidentally, I'm not short XONE. I'm not crazy enough to short any 3D printing stock. But I do think it's
fundamentally overvalued here from an investment perspective. Others disagree and that's a great thing.
After all, if everyone agreed on valuation there wouldn't be a stock market.


thanks again for your reply and the added information


03 Sep 2013, 12:02 PM


Matt Hlavin
Thanks Gary. This was a great discussion, and it's always great to have a healthy debate on both sides. As
you stated, if everyone is on one side, there's no market to bet on!


I look forward to following your work, as you are a passionate investor, and advocate for this new economy of
manufacturing. Hopefully we can meet sometime down the road!


For the rest of the followers of Seeking Alpha, there is a very bright future in 3D printing. The market is
emotional right now, but the big difference between the dot com era and the 3D industry, is this technology is
profitable, creating tangible goods, and new tangible products much quicker. This industry is very similar to
the traditional manufacturing and will impact our economy for many years to come.

I bought XONE at $64 and sold at $72. Your article has merit when speaking about P/E and P/S ratios. But that is old
news. People have know for a while that the stock was a "Tesla like" creature, priced at well above valuations. But
that hasn't stopped people from buying it. The rest of your article seemed like a "short-and distort" article. First part
tugging at blue-collar heartstrings by criminalizing the evil businessman who got rich. So what if he started a trust
fund, or if he cashed in on his own stock. The man has a right to make money. And maybe my math is wrong, but
starting a trust fund that pays 5% a year for 10 yrs is a good sign, because that shows he has confidence that his
stock will at least double in that time. There are a million reasons for a person to sell stock, but only one reason to buy
it. That part had nothing to do with the company or its potential. And the part about 10 people building a printer...what
does that have to do with why people should short XONE? Are there any other companies that mass produce
industrial 3D printers at this point? Who is to say that they won't do that when the time arises and it makes sense
financially to invest in that kind of manufacturing equipment? And the GE argument that other companies will produce
their own stuff like GE is doing....you failed to mention that GE bought out a 3D printing company a couple of years
ago just so they could produce for them. They didn't just start making stuff on their own. So how many of these legit
3D companies are lying around now waiting to be bought up by all the giant companies of the world? Not many.
Finally, you speak of an "ice cream maker" company not using their 3D printer because it takes a couple of days to
print a part. Well, all 3D printers take a while. And if I knew about the print time, why didn't the company that spent lots
of money on this machine know about it. I'm sure they did. It doesn't sound like an XONE problem. It sounds like this

Ice Cream company has poor management. And rather than focus on a part that takes 2 days to make, why not talk
about the lead time and cost that ordering a part from a supplier would take, not to mention the space and cost of
holding inventory for that business? In conclusion I agree that in the long run XONE is not as good as AMAVF, DDD,
or SSYS. Even ONVO has more promise because of the novelty. But stick to the numbers to prove that. That's all you
need. The other parts of the article are seemed like patchy and biased information and like you were trying too hard to
"short and distort". Happy trading.

I always wondered who shorts stocks like these?! Now I know. I agree it is MASSIVELY overvalued, but the current
borrow rate is 75%. This stock will tank at some point, but you've got to have pretty good timing to make money here.
You're losing a little over 1% every week that this stock doesn't tank (compounded). I think that a valuation of 1/10 of
its current one would be very generous, but to predict that it'll hit that value in under a year is pure guesswork. Good
luck on the short, but time is not on your side.

Wildeweasel
I would not buy xone based on a price, but on actual news. If they (Xone) announce something that would give them
the possibility of highly increased sales or profits. Right now they are looking pretty weak with no new tech R&D, or
acquisitions and fairly limited use of the old tech they do have. I have to agree with the writer of the article that
Rockwell seems more interested in offloading his shares than advancing the company.
