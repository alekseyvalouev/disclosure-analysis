Mesoblast Is Trying To Fool Investors Again

Summary


The Phase 2 program in Rheumatoid Arthritis failed.


We believe MESO performed post-hoc analysis to data-mine for positive endpoints.


In our opinion, MESO has followed this same game plan to disastrous results in its
Chronic Heart Failure trial.


Short MESO for 80% downside.


MESO is back to its old tricks


In November 2015, we revealed here in Seeking Alpha how we believed Mesoblast
(NASDAQ: MESO) was trying to fool investors into believing its Phase 2 trial in Chronic
Heart Failure (CHF) had not failed by utilizing a myriad of biotech tricks; such as, making
up new endpoints, performing endless post-hoc analysis, and data-mining for positive
results. When we published the article recommending a short, MESO last closed at
$12.33 per share. It is $6.30 per share today, down nearly 50% over 9 months, even after
the large recent rally.


We believe MESO is back at it again, this time with an even flimsier trial: its recently
released Phase 2 trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) (here). In this article, we will show how,
we believe, MESO has manipulated the trial data to make it seem like it had a successful
result when in fact the Phase 2 trial in RA failed to meet its specified endpoints.

1) MULTIPLICITY


We've written in the past (here) about the issue of multiplicity and why investors should be
extremely wary of biotech trials with a high number of endpoints. Specifically, we wrote, "If
a company does enough post-hoc analyses using different subgroups, it is nearly certain
to find something statistically significant. This problem is called 'multiplicity' in statistics,
and results in inflated false positives." This is the reason that most well-constructed, high-
quality clinical trials have one primary endpoint and one secondary endpoint, or at most
co-endpoints.


When we look at Mesoblast's Phase 2 trial in RA (official ClinicalTrials.gov page here), the
issue of multiplicity becomes patently obvious. The trial had 12 possible endpoints across
2 dosage groups, which creates at least 24 chances to find a statistically positive result.

It doesn't stop there! Mesoblast included two post-hoc additional time frames (weeks 4
and 8) and two pre-specified subgroups (all subjects, and subjects with 1-2 prior biologics)
that dramatically increased the trial's potential findings. Simple arithmetic shows
Mesoblast's trial had a total of 144 opportunities to data-mine for a positive result in the
study.
5/18/2018 Mesoblast Is Trying To Fool Investors Again - Mesoblast (NASDAQ:MESO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3999528-mesoblast-trying-fool-investors 4/15


In our multiplicity article, we showed that if a trial had 20 subgroups, the probability of at
least one significant but false positive result at a p-value of 0.05 is 64%. Mesoblast's
Phase 2 trial had 144 opportunities!


The issue of overwhelming multiplicity makes the findings from the Phase 2 RA trial
largely irrelevant. It was almost a statistical certainty that Mesoblast would find positive
results. But do these positive results mean anything? We believe not.


2) TRIAL FAILED TO MEET OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED ENDPOINTS


We want to be clear. We do not believe the Phase 2 trial in RA was successful. Our
reasons are below.


ACR endpoints are for the wrong time period


If we look at the main findings for ACR rates, we note that the trial's original time frame is
12 weeks. The ClinicalTrials.gov page clearly states that the objective of the trial is to
demonstrate the "efficacy of allogeneic MPCs compared to placebo at 12 weeks post-
infusion."


However, 3 of the 4 "positive" ACR findings touted by Mesoblast are at 8 weeks, and
failed for the 12-week time period.
5/18/2018 Mesoblast Is Trying To Fool Investors Again - Mesoblast (NASDAQ:MESO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3999528-mesoblast-trying-fool-investors 5/15


12 weeks is significant because that is the efficacy time frame that the FDA recommends
in its Guidance for Industry Rheumatoid Arthritis: Developing Drug Products for Treatment,
where it states, "Data from 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial(s) generally would be
acceptable to provide evidence of efficacy in clinical response and physical function
domains," (here, page 4).


We believe that once Mesoblast learned that the Phase 2 trial had failed, it data-mined for
positive statistical results and found that the Week 8 endpoint happened to have good
results. However, the 8-week data is meaningless for two reasons: 1) the FDA does not
consider 8-week data when evaluating efficacy and 2) this analysis was done post-hoc.


Even more incredulous, for the DAS28 secondary endpoint in the trial, MESO touted a
one week positive result! This result is completely worthless and just goes to show how
meaningless these "positive" findings are.


In the end, MESO had 144 chances for a positive result and only found four such results.
That is a paltry 3% hit rate. How positive of a sign should Mesoblast investors take this to
be? We believe it's an extremely negative sign and clear evidence that the trial failed.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3999528-mesoblast-trying-fool-investors 6/15


Failed the FDA's preferred ACR20 endpoint


Furthermore, it's important to highlight that the Phase 2 trial failed to hit the ACR20
endpoint. Why is this important? Both Mesoblast and its consultant, Dr. Allan Gibofsky,
stated on the conference call (replay here) that ACR20 is the traditionally accepted
endpoint for arthritis treatments by the FDA. In fact, the FDA states in its rheumatoid
arthritis Guidance for Industry ( here, page 3), "ACR20 response criteria continues to be
an accepted measure to demonstrate reduction in RA disease activity."


As for ACR50 and ACR70, the FDA downplays the importance of these measures and
states ACR50 and ACF70 can only be used as "supportive evidence." The Phase 2 RA
trial missed on the most important endpoint that the FDA examines, and only "hit" on
supportive endpoints after data-mining for different time periods. Mesoblast's Phase 2 RA
trial completely missed on the crucial ACR20 12-week endpoint.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3999528-mesoblast-trying-fool-investors 7/15


This just adds to the absurdity of Mesoblast's blatant data-mining in our view. Despite the
sheer number of chances Mesoblast had to find positive results, Mesoblast could still not
find a positive result in the most relevant RA endpoint! We believe this is a testament to
how patently obvious the RA trial failure was.


3) MESOBLAST CHANGED ITS STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY


For the two secondary endpoints of HAQ-DI and DAS28, the ClinicalTrials.gov clearly
states "mean changes from baseline" as the official statistical method.


Using the arithmetic mean makes sense since the Phase 2 trial only had 48 total patients,
with 16 patients in each arm. The arithmetic mean is very straightforward given the small
size of the trial.


However, the "positive" findings for HAQ-DI and DAS28 peddled by Mesoblast all used
"least squares mean change from baseline." This is important because a least squares
mean is very different from a normal, arithmetic mean.


Least squares mean is a fancy calculation to be used on a patient population so small.
When properly used, it controls for a covariate such as center of enrollment, patient age,
etc. However, an impact of this is that it alters the weight of each data point. With only 16
patients in each arm in the trial, every patient's result is important and should be counted
equally. The least squares mean allows for different weightings, which can dramatically
alter the results. A clear example of the difference between the arithmetic mean and least
squares mean is below.
5/18/2018 Mesoblast Is Trying To Fool Investors Again - Mesoblast (NASDAQ:MESO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3999528-mesoblast-trying-fool-investors 8/15


We believe Mesoblast changed its statistical methodology in order data-mine for positive
results once it realized the P2 trial failed. This is another major change to the trial that
Mesoblast did post-hoc to its benefit.


4) POST-HOC ENDPOINTS


Lastly, we call attention that MSB added two new, post-hoc endpoints by altering the
original endpoints for HAQ-DI and DAS28:


First, the ClinicalTrials.gov page does not include responder endpoints for either the HAQ-
QI or DAS28 endpoints.


Second, the cutoffs for what constitutes a "responder" were not pre-specified endpoints.
This only adds to the significant multiplicity problem in the Phase 2 trial and makes it even
more egregious due to the post-hoc nature of the analysis.


As a result, notice how different the endpoints have now become. The Phase 2 endpoints
were originally "mean change from baseline" for DAS28 and HAQ-DI for the treatment
arms versus placebo, which is an absolute measure of therapeutic benefit. With the
5/18/2018 Mesoblast Is Trying To Fool Investors Again - Mesoblast (NASDAQ:MESO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3999528-mesoblast-trying-fool-investors 9/15


changes that Mesoblast implemented, the endpoints have now become, "the difference
between the percent of patients who had an improvement of X amount." Not only is it now
a relative measure, but it is also a drastic change from the original endpoint.


For these two reasons (changing the statistical method and adding new endpoints, both of
which were done post-hoc), we find the HAQ-DI and DAS28 results to be meaningless.


Where's Waldo: Can you spot the issues?

Reminiscent of what Mesoblast did in with the P2 CHF trial

We outlined all of Mesoblast's statistical sleight of hand (here) back in late 2015. We
clearly warned investors of the low-quality results in the CHF trial. Soon after we wrote the
article, Teva (NYSE: TEVA), Mesoblast's partner for the CHF trial, terminated the
partnership at the first chance Teva had. This caused MESO's share price to drop to 7-
year lows in one of the biggest bull markets of all time (here).


Our last short in MESO returned 53%. We're even more enthusiastic today.


When we originally recommended MESO as a short, it had last closed at $12.33. Since
we wrote the article, MESO has fallen nearly 50%. We think it's an even more compelling
short today given the deterioration in the company.


Mesoblast's only major partner, Teva, terminated the partnership for Mesoblast's most
important product. That's a bad sign.


Mesoblast failed to complete a partnership agreement with Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG).
That's another negative sign.


Mesoblast is quickly burning through its cash reserves, we believe, and will have to
support itself through dilutive equity raises. Mesoblast is in a precarious financial position.


In our opinion, Mesoblast is in a precarious financial position and is again touting post-
hoc, data-mined results. This time with a Phase 2 trial with only 48 patients. This is even
lower quality trial than Mesoblast's Phase 2 trial in CHF which had only 60 patients.


We feel that Mesoblast is trying to use the same tricks with RA. Investors should not be
fooled twice.

I'm looking forward to reading this, thanks. It was fun earlier when the stock got halted and I was able to cover at a

The multi-year chart here is incredible, perhaps my favorite in the entire stock market. Talk about an alpha short.

Never trust a hit piece published by an anonymous author who admits "I am/we are short XXXX stock." Ulterior

great point survtech the logician - most of these guys just throw a dart at a board to find a stock to short and
then write a bunch of stuff about how awful the company is. none of the ibanks, insiders, or optimistic longs
have ulterior motives.

There are many. But how many publish articles that then are used by lawyers to initiate shareholder lawsuits
that were subsequently thrown out of court?


And for that matter, how many publish hit pieces claiming companies are scams and/or have no employees
where subsequently the company is acquired for a 90% premium?


"Ocata: Dilution Imminent, SEC Investigation Potentially Underway, Office Appears Empty, Price Target
$0.00" and "Cellceutix: Empty Office, Unviable 'Science', Misleading Disclosures, 96% Downside" come to
mind.

Each and every one is different. That is why the intelligent investor will do their own due diligence before
taking any action. You know, rather than getting mad at others for having an opinion. If you think this is going
to get acquired for a 90% premium, this author just did you a favor.

A partnership deal will most likely move the shares up by at least 50%, so if not wanting to cover the short

Outside of the short ideas, I must say, the comment section of these type of articles is can't miss entertainment.

Thank you. I must think carefully. What I want to see is evidence of the assertions of end-point changes. I presume
they are there. Must re-read. 
Thank you again. 
BTW, you are "incredulous" but in the sentence in the text, its simply : "(it is) incredible." Bit like people using
