ACB


Aurora Cannabis is equitizing convertible debt due in four months in a death spiral-
like transaction.


Aurora faces potential of virtually unlimited dilution.


That Aurora, one of the largest and most liquid cannabis companies was unable to
obtain better financing options should signal caution in the cannabis sector.


Based on set-up, stock should fall this week, until the convert is equitized.


On Thursday, November 14, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: NASDAQ:ACB) quietly issued a
press release alongside its earnings release. In the press release, Aurora announced
the equitization of CAD $230M of convertible debt (with an original exercise price now
far out-of-the-money) in a classic "death spiral" structure. The fact that Aurora was
forced into this extremely dilutive option should signal caution in the cannabis sector.

From Investopedia: "A Death Spiral is a term applied to a type of convertible debt that
stimulates an ever-increasing number of shares, leading to steep stock price drops. The
convertible bond, unlike a conventional convertible one, converts into a fixed value
instead of a fixed number of shares. If this bond is converted into stock, the price of the
stock tends to drop due to the increased supply of shares. This, in turn, encourages
more conversion because the convertible debt owners can obtain — and then sell —
even more shares of the stock with the fixed value feature. Theoretically, the death
spiral can end with the stock at or near a zero dollar value."


Management was vague about the true mechanism of the repayment of the 2020
debenture. They pitched it as a measure to "strengthen" the balance sheet, when in fact
it exposes shareholders to the potential of virtually unlimited dilution. While Aurora
shares are down ~30% since the announcement, the potential downside is even lower
given how punitive this repayment structure could be for existing shareholders.


It appears that a few sophisticated hedge funds have negotiated this repayment
structure which allows them to hedge out the debenture without needing to borrow
shares, meaning they can begin selling the approximately 80M shares that would be
needed to hedge the entire $230M debenture issue. Note the 80M shares figure
assumes the share price stays at the current $3 CAD over the next 5 trading days - but
this number could increase significantly if the share price were to drop in a meaningful
way.


The supplemental indenture filing reveals a very deliberate structure that allows holders
to lock in gains by hedging out shares of ACB over the course of this week. The
debenture holders have cleverly negotiated a two-part repayment: the first, based on the
average daily VWAP from November 18 and 19, is paid in shares on November 20. This
is extremely advantageous as it allows the funds to receive shares in a standard T+2
settlement, thus obviating the need to borrow shares. The second part of the repayment
is based on the VWAP over the whole week (November 18 to November 22) and paid in
shares on November 25. The staggered repayments allow holders to begin hedging or
shorting this week without the need for borrow.

It’s a vicious cycle: the lower the price of ACB, the more the debenture holders
need to hedge. The more they hedge, the lower the price goes. The below table
outlines the dilution that ACB will suffer under various price scenarios. All references
below are in CAD.


While the financing structure will be a significant technical headwind into November 25,
shares could find support if the broad cannabis sector experiences a sharp rally or short
squeeze. However, the effects on ACB shares would likely be outweighed by convertible
hedging and additional shorting given the size of the issue and the stock's liquidity.


The takeaway is that there will likely be continued heavy selling pressure on ACB stock
throughout this week as hedge funds who own the 2020 debentures scramble to hedge
out their exposure and lock in gains. Given this, we recommend investors avoid Aurora
stock or reduce their holdings until the convertible is equitized.

I’m confused. We have a stooge screaming about Distress signals and a stone fox
screaming “smart decisions” Which is it? Again, why won’t they find a partner? Is it stupidity
or pride? Maybe they are orchestrating a collapse in sp at suggestion of a white knight
company that has hinted it will come to the rescue “if you can just bring the price down a bit
more”? (I am out of my depth here.) (edited)

How much of their control is it appropriate to share with someone else? I think CGC
might be worth looking at when contemplating an answer to that question. (Their
former CEO and remaining board members might be willing to share their viewpoints
on that..)

Yeah, I can understand their desire to be autonomous, but I guess there are many
different ways to form partnerships, and it would be helpful for ACB to have access
to capital as well as possible synergies with a pharma, CPG, tobacco, food or
beverage company. Just my opinion, probably driven by frustration at watching my
400 shares go from around $3k down to less than $1k in value! (I need to remember
that I have made $5k in the rallies during the past 3 years; glad I took that profit and
held just a portion for the long term.)

yes we know inhaling smoke is bad. yes we know you shouldn't drive on substances that

Investing in MJ companies shouldn't be any different than investing in any other companies.
Look for a company with good management, solid balance sheet, profits, and strong growth
in the future- and you will make money. The other route is day- or swing-trading based on
charts. The long-term fundamentals approach is what makes retail investors money. To
succeed in day-trading you need to be a genius (in addition to dedicating an enormous
amount of time and energy to trading).

Thanks Jim Cramer , the Mad Money carnival barker that was pumping the pot stocks and is
now back tracking on his words , as he always does. Cramer should be called out for the
number of times he has mislead his "home gamers" and then tried to put the blame on them
for "not doing their homework". Why should they do their homework when the teacher is
supposedly giving them the answers. Shame on you Cramer!

@No Camo  
pretty sure he was all about canopy...and he would probably still be long CGC at
current levels if he was long before.


also, I'd like to see you give stock picks EVERY day without the ability to properly
relay when to sell / when the investment thesis changes while still abiding by SEC
laws. I don't follow Cramer, I'm just saying...you're vastly oversimplifying it.


Lastly, cracks me up that you're angry because you can't blindly trust a guy on T.V.
to tell you everything you need to know about investing.

What a disaster with ACB, they continue to dilute the stock, way too much goodwill paid ($3
Billion!) and no real value showing beyond speculation. SP still dropped by a staggering
30%+ in a few days, and you guys are still rooting for ACB? Watch this stock drop again
tomorrow and more people lose money. Just a trap manipulated by the markets. You people
are stuck with too much skin in the game and can't face reality. Avoid ACB. APHA is actually
a way stronger company, when markets go up, APHA will shine even more.

Could have something to do with the fact that cannabis has already been reported to cause
decreased mental ability in those who start using it as teenagers and a relation between
cannabis use and the risk of psychosis.


Sadly, that's just the beginning.


What so conveniently eludes much of the reporting is that THC is not "Reefer Madness"--it
is a potent, often dangerous drug. As "recreational" use is legalized from California to
Maine, watch for more studies that show how it figures in traffic deaths, mental illness, the
escalation of other forms of drug dependence, and so on.


You might make a buck off it, but you'll also have to put your head on your pillow at night.

wow, you're quite misinformed on MJ as a whole.  
A.) its not "dangerous" scientists have shown alcohol is about 400x more dangerous
and harmful. caffeine is more addictive.  
B.) There is no risk of psychosis, unless eating your entire pantry is considered
psychosis? either way, there is nothing to back that up.  
C.) of course drugs as a teen, while your brain is developing is a bad thing, alcohol
again does more damage. hence the age restriction 
D.) it can treat various mental illnesses, as well as exacerbate them. So does any
pharmaceutical, ten fold on the exacerbate part too. I know that first hand. So again,
pharmaceuticals can be added to the list of things more "dangerous" than marijuana.
especially benzo's and opiod's, two things marijuana is an alternative for, also two of
the most addictive substances known to man.  
E.) as for other forms of drug dependence, no, that isn't linked to marijuana, that's
linked to hanging out with the wrong crowd. you know? drug dealers. the shady guys
that used to be the only way to get it. that "gateway" garbage was fear mongering by
the same people that brought you "just say no". 
F.) the war on drugs is quite possibly this country's biggest failed venture of all time.
it has led to the rise of drug lords richer and more powerful than some of history's
royalty. like prohibition gave birth to the mob, the prohibition of marijuana has given
cartels and gangs steroids. the same people that deal heroin, cocaine, and
numerous other illicit drugs. of course they want you to be a better customer. that's
your "gateway".

You're not a physician or a statistician. Can you site the literature or the double blind
studies showing "400% more dangerous" or the measure of addictive quality
parameters used to compare with caffeine.


It's always the same with the Marijuana fan boys. Just anecdotal evidence and then
degeneration to ad hominem attacks etc...


I'm long ACB, MO so I'm not averse to investing in companies that have products
deemed harmful to humanity...like my other investments.. Raytheon, General
Dynamics, BAE etc... just as long as they make money.


But going around siting the "good" that marijuana does for society is laughable. In
discussing this with friends I always state that I want their kids to wake and bake....to
smoke and ingest as much marijuana as they can... because they're competing with
my kids.

Washington St 14 rec stores per 100,000 residents. 
Canada 0.8 stores per 100,000 residents as of May '19. 
There is a major retail bottleneck, no lack of demand. There will be 600+ stores by EOY.
ACB will be pulling revenue of $175m by end of 2020.

In Alberta where the government did not interfere with outrageous regulation nor did
they limit retail outlets like Ontario did, the marijuana retail sales are much much
better and it has reduced black market sales while ensuring supply and a reasonable
price. In Ontario it is a disaster. 28 or 30 retail stores in the ENTIRE province;
excess government regulation and the right hand simply does not know what the left
is doing. I think the answer is in allowing retail stores to open up and let the free
market operate with less government interference.

In BC i honestly don't even know where to find a single store. And now sadly many
of the grey market store that were operating prior to legalization have been forced to
close by zealous enforcement of government regulations.

BC is a big province @Ulsterman - where are you at?


Check out this link for starters (these are retail, not dispensary) - maybe it will help..

Pretty sure unless you live in Toad River in a cabin you can find one relatively close
by with just a little effort and a search engine.
