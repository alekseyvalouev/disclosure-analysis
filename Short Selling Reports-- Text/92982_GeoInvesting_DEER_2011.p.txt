Through our own set of recordings, we have confirmed details regarding the claims
made by AlfredLittle.com that Harbin Electric (NASDAQ: HRBN) and Deer Consumer
Products (NASDAQ: DEER) have likely misappropriated a combined approximately
$44.0 million by exaggerating the price paid for land use rights. We are very familiar
with issues surrounding land use rights. We have seen similar cases of
misrepresentation of land use rights with stories we broke such as China Redstone
(CGPI.PK) and Lotus Pharmaceuticals (OTCPK:LTUS).


CGPI denied our claims of land use right misrepresentations despite recordings with
government officials and the publication of a PRC newspaper article, after our research
report, which agreed with our findings. Our findings were even supported by quotes from
employees of CGPI! The stock now trades near $0.70 per share. The key lesson to be
learned is that ChinaHybrid paper and words cannot be trusted at face value.


HRBN Summary of Findings


We confirmed that Ms. Wang actually does exist and works at Xi’an Lintong
Tourism & Business Development Zone Management.

Ms. Wang confirmed a much lower land price than indicated by HRBN.2.

Contrary to DEER’s claims, we confirmed that Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Fei Li actually do
exist and work at Wuhu Economic & Technological Development Area.


1.


They both confirmed much lower land use prices than indicated by DEER.2.


Earlier this week, China-based stock "fraud sleuth" Alfredlittle.com ("A*L") published a
hard-hitting exposition of land fraud in China, focusing on and. A*L presented a series of
recorded conversations and emails with government officials in charge of selling land
use rights. He offered evidence that he believes proves that HRBN and DEER both
dramatically inflated the prices (disclosed in SEC documents) paid for land use rights to
large parcels of land the companies acquired for the purpose of expanding their
production capacities.


Following the publishing of A*L’s report, HRBN quickly responded, denying the
allegations but providing no evidence of why it appears to be overpaying by
approximately $18 million for the land use rights and no explanation of why the official
overseeing the purchase was unaware of HRBN’s alleged approximately $23 million
deposit.


The recordings we subsequently attained give much credibility to A*L's findings. We too
were informed by some of the same government officials that the prices paid for land by
HRBN and DEER were much less than what land use rights sell for (as set by relevant
government agencies) in Xi’an and Anhui, respectively.


Government Official Name confirming information on HRBN: Ms. Wang.


Government Official Names confirming information on DEER: Mr. Zhuang and Mr.
Fei Li


According to A*L’s due diligence, in the case of HRBN, the $38 million purchase price
was approximately $18 million higher than the highest price quoted by the official in
charge of the land use sales in the local development zone. HRBN claimed in its SEC
filings that as of June 30, 2011 it paid approximately $23 million deposit for land use
rights. The government official overseeing the land purchases denied the price and
other details of the transaction, including whether or not it had been formally agreed
upon. Furthermore, the official was unaware of the approximately $23 million HRBN
allegedly paid as a deposit. Where did the approximately $23 million prepayment really
go?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/293849-geoteam-corroborates-alfredlittle-com-findings-on-harbin-and-deer?source=all_articles_title 3/16


In an effort to verify A*L’s report, we dispatched our investigator to establish the
authenticity of A*L’s communication with the government officials recorded in its report.
Our investigator contacted Ms. Wang at Xi’an Lintong Tourism and Business
Development Zone Management, the official in charge of HRBN’s land use rights
acquisition. In his brief conversation with Ms. Wang (Audio here; Transcript here), she
verified the maximum selling price of the land use rights is significantly less than
HRBN’s claim, thus supporting allegations HRBN was overpaying by approximately $18
million.


The government official also said that it is typical that a discount, not a premium,
would be applied to large land use right purchase arrangements. Our investigator also
confirmed that the price per Chinese acre ("mu") for the parcel of land in question
should have been RMB 260 per mu as opposed to RMB 500 per mu HRBN claimed as
its purchase price.


It is our belief that going-private financiers, specifically China Development Bank, may
start to question the documents provided to them by HRBN and shareholder ABAX.
That could torpedo the already controversial buyout. Would China Development Bank
want to be involved in a story that may be fraught with fraud, especially as the SEC and
PRC regulatory agencies are working together to stop rampant fraud by ChinaHybrids?


Interestingly, in the September 6 HRBN press release, chairman Yang refuted A*L by
indicating that China Development Bank reaffirmed its position in the private transaction
without providing any contact information for individuals at China Development Bank.
We find this very interesting considering the fact A*L’s article came out at approximately
11:30pm China time. Subsequently, chairman Yang’s press release came out at 3:30am
china time, an odd time business activity and to contact the bank.


The bank will likely consider the risks of an exit strategy if PRC authorities drop the
hammer on HRBN post a going private transaction or if the SEC files a lawsuit.
Investors need to be cognizant of a potential SEC lawsuit against HRBN and if this
would lead to cold feet by potential financers of the company’s going private deal. We
need to keep in mind that companies that are looking to go private are not immune to
SEC action as was the case with PUDA.


Investors should know that 90% of the "going private" market cap is based on a bet that
the CEO will complete a buyout despite of the following:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/293849-geoteam-corroborates-alfredlittle-com-findings-on-harbin-and-deer?source=all_articles_title 4/16


Our PRC filing analysis of HRBN also parallels that of Citron and Chimin Sang who
claim that SEC financial information significantly diverges from PRC financial filings.


1.


Evidence from 2 separate sources (Alfredlittle.com and GeoInvesting.com) indicates
that the company may have materially overpaid for land use rights. We are
compelled to ask, where did those excess payments go?


2.


U.S. regulators have halted and/or delisted companies with similar circumstances.3.


There is real risk that a "going private" transaction will be thwarted if U.S. regulators
actively investigate this story.


4.


In the case of DEER, the $37 million purchase price was approximately $21 million
higher than the highest price quoted by three different government officials in the
development zone office. The officials explained that such payments in excess of the
agreed price are rebated in 7 days to the account of the buyer’s choice. DEER has
never disclosed the receipt of any such rebate. Where did the approximately $21 million
rebate really go? We surmise that either it was not paid in accordance with normal
practices in China, it was embezzled, or it was paid and DEER’s management needs to
explain where those funds really went.


Our investigator successfully contacted Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Fei Li, two of the officials in
charge of DEER’s land use rights acquisition. Mr. Zhuang confirmed (Audio here;
Transcript here) to us the maximum selling price of the land use rights is significantly
less than DEER’s claim. Thus, it appears that DEER clearly overpaid by approximately
$21 million.


Mr. Fei Li of Wuhu Economic & Technological Development Area also corroborated a
much lower price for land use rights than DEER had claimed to pay. (Audio here;
Transcript here)


DEER responded that A*L’s allegations included "totally fabricated information, false
identities, and false allegations." DEER provided no explanation for why it paid $21
million more than the maximum price quoted by three officials overseeing the
transaction and offered no explanation of where this money really went. The company
did manage to brazenly observe that A*L included HRBN in the investigative report.
DEER went on to then tout HRBN’s private offering:

Deer also notes the short seller "Alfred Little's" attempt to link Deer to a heavily
shorted and unrelated company, Harbin Electric, Inc. whose management team has
announced a going private transaction at $24 per share in cash, with a shareholder
voting record date of September 13, 2011, and advised by Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley and Lazard Freres & Co., as well as represented by several global law firms.


This statement seemed ridiculous to us since there is no reason for a reputable public
company to divert attention from itself by going into so much detail regarding a private
transaction for what is in their words, an unrelated company. We find their assertion of
no relation peculiar given that Ben Wey played an integral part in bringing both
companies public, establishing a connection between HRBN and DEER not immediately
noticed by the untrained eye.


Now that we have verified the information in A*L’s recorded calls with the officials
overseeing HRBN and DEER’s land use rights purchases, we strongly agree that
regulators should take action. The facts of each case are very simple. The combined
approximately $44 million in excess cost above the maximum prices quoted by
government officials cannot be simply denied or explained away. HRBN’s and DEER’s
attempts to brush aside these allegations should not be tolerated.


We believe that there is significant risk to long positions in both stocks due to a risk that
each could be halted until independent investigations are announced, financials are
restated and executives responsible for the misappropriations of corporate funds are
terminated.


Our PRC filings for DEER do not match SEC filings on both sales and net income.


These findings that agree with A*L's findings are being sent to the SEC and Nasdaq.


Disclosure: I am short HRBN, OTC:DEER.

Umm, so what you're saying is, the figures you've chosen to base your newest defamation
on, are discounted figures, and may not reflect the actual price paid?


Sheesh guys, anybody can say anything these days so have at it why don't you?


BTW - My crystal ball indicates SA readership is dropping off a cliff due to so much incorrect

I think Geo should spend more time talking about track record than these random account
analysis your fine team does with Citron/AL, but one as clever as you should note track
record speaks volume louder than random bloggers who are publicly short the stock & the
price performance. Since your team have been writing these articles the stock has rallied
30%, so it is clearly obvious the market does not favor your thesis, and that anyone who has
actually followed your advice has lost a significant amount of money.

You are absolutely right. It's amazing to watch how they challenge what is basically a
done deal. Once CSR and HRBN are done, maligning and shorting Chinese stocks
will not be a one way street any more; that is probably the reason behind all these
late attacks, not just the HRBN deal.

Just to fair:


After some digging I found the land grant minimum price page that works in my browser. It is
available here:


www.law-lib.com/law/la...


The Price list seems to be from 2006 (Let's hope China does not do inflation adjustments ). I
assume that Xi'an is in Shaanxi province and that would make it grade 5, not grade 10 as
AL says. Numbers for top 10 grades are below. I calculated price in yuan for 500 Chinese
Mu also. Seems to match AL's price numbers, if not the grade. Numbers are in order: 
Grade--Price Yuan per sqr meter--Price Yuan per Mu--Price for 500 Mu (Yuan)


1 840 560000 280,000,000 
2 720 480000 240,000,000 
3 600 400000 200,000,000

So geo investing has confirmed alfred little all on seeking alpha. I don't get a warm fuzzy
that Geo and Alfred little aren't the same people or in cahoots. The fact that it is all on the
same website also feels like collusion. It would be good to get a named, reputable source to
look into all this - someone real.

misutira:


So by your reasoning, since Geo Investing very well might be the same person as
Alfred Little, that could mean Alfred Little is the same person as Citron. So, then
Citron could be the same person as Chimin Sang! So all FOUR of these
persons/investing teams could very well be the SAME PERSON! Since Geo
Investing's "PRC filing analysis of HRBN also parallels that of Citron and Chimin
Sang who claim that SEC financial information significantly diverges from PRC
financial filings." 
Never mind the fact Seeking Alpha does require the true identity of all contributing
authors to its website. Perhaps you should read up on Seeking Alpha's policy
regarding anonymous authors.


Also, since these persons who question HRBN might be "in cahoots", by the same
reasoning, everyone who posts positive comments in support of HRBN might also
very well be "in cahoots"; or worse, they could very well all be the same person,
also! So, for all anyone knows, you might very well be the same person as the other
'commenters' that have defended HRBN on this article.

Here's the difference. These guys steal from investors and SA supports it. Its what is
called "Short Friendly Media". Shorts have the motivation to multi-post and of course
make up anything slanderous they want and SA seems to be very accommodating
to this activity. What motivation would longs have here to multi post under different
aliases? Shorts need someone to supposedly support their frivolous stories but there
is zero motivation for longs here other than to defend against what is clearly a very
illegal attack. I can understand defending these scumbags if you yourself is one of
them or stands to profit from taking investors money. Fact is, long term investors get
their money from the company's prosperity and shorts get their money by destroying
it or at least attempting to. These frivolous stories are just about played out and
these companies are now very aware of how to handle them going forward and too
many of these thieves have been proven wrong time and time again so its just about
over for this short scheme. Then it will be on to the next attack on another company
to steal from those investors. The more mr little and geowhatever talks, the more
secure longs should feel here.

We do agree with your point that the companies have figured out how to deal with
negative press: sue the messengers. Delay their day of reckoning.


But they can't refute the track record. It is only a matter of time before the truth
prevails.

These allegations are not very well supported. Most sophisticated investors will see right
through this propaganda from bloggers with a short interest in both companies - particularly
with such curious timing 1 day before options expiration.

Does your opinion also hold true to bloggers who hold long positions?

I have never owned and know very little about Harbin.


But I am amused at the "we confirmed that Ms. Wang does exist" stuff.


Did you take a page from Mr. Chanos's book and "confirm her existence" via satellite photos
taken at 3 A.M. on a cloudy night?

Think the deal would fall on this minor transgression in Chinese politics and finance? Think
not. Worst case is a correction to SEC and shareholders in mho:


According to A*L’s due diligence, in the case of HRBN, the $38 million purchase price was
approximately $18 million higher than the highest price quoted by the official in charge of the
land use sales in the local development zone.

It seems that HRBN actually is prepared to pay the legal price while local authorities
were quoting their discounted, but illegal, negotiated deal prices. But what do I know
- I just read China Supreme Court decisions.


HRBN's payment schedule for the land use grant deal is structured exactly in line
what should keep it valid according to the China Supreme Court decision. Funny
coincidence, indeed.

You guys are getting desperate. And repeating fraud accusations 1000x while spewing more
garbage isn't going to cut it. Investors who have met and spoken to the company and those
holding 5% more shares are clearly comfortable of the deal moving forward then you
chumps that like you guys trying to pile it on, like crap on crap, I guess.. and it won't work.
What is astounding is your lack of understanding of relationships between CDB and Harbin
Chairman. Harbin bought two SOEs from Chinese govt as part of overall Chinese goal of
modernizing the industry. Harbin Chairman sits in the committee to help set policy and
promote the industry and CDB is a policy setting bank which helps fund those policies. If you
think Harbin, holding two large SOEs bought from the State, will find issues from CDB, the
you unbelievably ignorant or perhaps you are trying to sucker shorts into this name?. You
deserve to lose all your money going short on Harbin.

I found some confusing information about pricing of land use rights for state owned land in
China. Namely these quotes:


"Development zone administration commissions  
have never had the power to grant land use rights,  
but continued misinformation on this point has  
made it necessary for the Interpretation to  
reemphasize it."


"A negotiated price for a grant of land use rights  
that is below the applicable minimum price is  
invalid, but the grantee can elect to make the grant  
valid by paying the difference between the  
originally paid price and the appraised value (at the  
time of the grant contract)"


source: 
www.orrick.com/fileupl...


The article is based on China's Supreme People's Court’s “Interpretation Regarding Trials
Involving Cases of State- Owned Land-Use Rights Contract Disputes”, issued on June 18,
2005 and effective from August 1, 2005.


Can somebody clarify?

The connection between DEER and HRBN, as you guys pointed out, was the fact that both
companies did the backdoor listing with RTO transactions orchestrated by the notorious
stock promoter Benjamin Wey from NYGG. The difference was HRBN fired Wey right after
going public probably due a fight over the free shares taken by Wey,while DEER quite likely
kept Wey as an advisor up to this minute, letting Wey handle IR functions, draft up those
aggressive, fraudulent, promotional press releases. DEER and Wey also tried to conceal the
fact that Wey was the mastermind behind its RTO by removing this page from NYGG
website (www.asensio.com/china/...). Sadly, such attempted didn't work with the webpage
archived by Asensio.com.


On top of your proof of the existence of the officials that being falsely labelled by DEER as
"false identities", DEER told another ridiculous lie by claiming that Mr. Liu A*L spoke earlier
didn't exist. The guy's existence and his 6 years of history at the same government
department you called has been proven with the audio recording of a phone call in the A*L
report (vimeo.com/25819357). I guess such a ridiculous lie by a the mgmt of a public
company with $200 market cap to cover up its dirty is really common in the capital markets,
huh? It's a shame such blatant type of fraud even exist in today's market.

Are you kidding Wu tang? Where is the proof? GeoInvesting and Alfred Little have
held the company hostage with false attacks just to make their own deals under the
table to cease. Why would that be? Apparently these thieves only care about lining
their own pockets at the expense of thousands of shareholders. Thats why Mr little,
is a criminal and is still committing crimes against these companies. Some things
never change. If you can't earn it, steal it i guess is their mottos!!

Its also clear these short writers suggest these companies hide behind a shroud of
secrecy yet the Little man and Geowhatever hide behind so called, "Investigators".
Who are these investigators names. Why do these clowns not release that
information like responsible journalist should. Why? Because its all a scam by these
shorts. I demand the names of these investigators. They're probably undercover.

Connorport, why would we possibly consider giving up the names of our
investigators? That would immediately expose them to great personal danger in
China, forcing them to hide for safety rather than continuing to do the great work of
exposing the massive fraud in Chinese U.S. and Canadian listed companies.


Anyone who doubts the quality of our work can easily verify our track record:
