Dilution	or	Bankruptcy:	The	Future	Looks	Dim	for	YRC	Worldwide
Shareholders

by:	Studioso	Research


On	17	May	2011,	YRC	Worldwide	(NASDAQ:YRCW)	filed	an	S-1	with	the	SEC	that
describes	its	intention	to	issue	billions	of	shares	in	exchange	for	a	relatively	small	amount
of	its	outstanding	debt.


The	exchange	offer	expired	on	15	July	at	5pm,	and	shareholders	should	expect	an
announcement	from	the	company	shortly	regarding	the	success	(or	otherwise)	of	the
restructuring	plan.	Regardless	of	the	outcome,	the	future	looks	bleak	for	YRCW
shareholders.


If	the	plan	succeeds,	the	company	will	issue	billions	of	additional	shares.


Alternatively,	“If	we	do	not	complete	the	financial	restructuring,	it	is	very	unlikely	we	will	be
able	to	generate	cash	sufficient	to	pay	the	principal	of,	interest	on	and	other	amounts	due
in	respect	of	our	indebtedness	and	other	obligations	when	due	and	we	would	likely	need
to	seek	protection	under	the	U.S.	Bankruptcy	Code.”


As	a	result	of	our	analysis	of	the	restructuring	plan,	we	have	a	price	target	of	$0.28,
which	is	over	78%	lower	than	the	closing	price	of	$1.31	on	15	July.


1.	Debt	Exchange	and	stock	issue	to	IBT	Employee	Stock	Trust


1a.	Debt	exchange:


The	company	will	exchange	$1,033,566,247.30	in	credit	agreement	claims	for	shares	of
new	preferred	stock	that	are	convertible	into	common	stock.	The	new	preferred	stock	will
be	convertible	into	1,384,832,389	shares	of	common	stock.


1b.	Stock	issue	to	IBT	Employee	Stock	Trust


If	the	exchange	offer	is	completed,	new	preferred	stock	(also	convertible	into	common
stock)	will	be	issued	to	the	IBT	Employee	Stock	Trust.	The	new	preferred	stock	will	be
convertible	into	477,528,410	shares	of	common	stock.


2.	New	debt:	Series	A	Notes	and	Series	B	Notes

In	addition	to	the	receipt	of	the	new	preferred	stock,	some	holders	of	credit	claims	will
receive	$140	million	principal	amount	of	Series	A	notes.	These	notes	are	convertible	into
common	stock	at	a	price	of	$0.1134.	Therefore	the	$140	million	represents	an	additional
140	million	/	0.1134	=	1,234,567,901	shares	of	common	stock.


Credit	claims	holders	are	also	given	rights	to	purchase	$100	million	in	Series	B	notes.
These	notes	are	convertible	into	common	stock	at	a	price	of	$0.0618.	Therefore	the	$100
million	represents	an	additional	100	million	/	0.0618	=	1,618,122,977	shares	of	common
stock.


3.	Calculation	of	valuation


On	28	February,	YRCW	gave	the	first	hints	regarding	the	significant	dilution	that	would	be
the	result	of	its	restructuring	plan.


The	market	capitalisation	of	the	company’s	stock	on	25	February	was:


47,770,650	shares	outstanding	*	$3.42	=	$163,375,623.


Value	of	restructured	company:


Existing	company	value 163,375,623


Debt	cancellation 1,033,566,247


Series	B	notes	proceeds 100,000,000


Total	value 1,296,941,870


Note	that	the	debt	cancellation	represents	about	79%	of	the	company’s	value.


Number	of	shares	outstanding:


Existing	shares	outstanding 47,770,650


Shares	to	be	issued	to	credit	claims	holders 1,384,832,389


Shares	to	be	issued	to	IBT	Employee	Stock	Trust 477,528,410

https://seekingalpha.com/article/280197-dilution-or-bankruptcy-the-future-looks-dim-for-yrc-worldwide-shareholders 3/5


Conversion	of	Series	A	notes 1,234,567,901


Conversion	of	Series	B	notes 1,618,122,977


Total	shares	outstanding	after	restructuring: 4,762,822,327


1,296,941,870	/	shares	outstanding	4,762,822,327	=	$0.2723	price	target


4.	“Earnings”	guidance	provided


On	14	July,	YRCW	provided	earnings	guidance	showing	projected	EBITDA	of	$210	million
for	2011.	Some	media	outlets	reported	this	information	as	good	news,	especially	in	light	of
the	company’s	EBITDA	of	$74	million	in	2010.	We	caution	investors	that	the	$210	million
does	not	include	expenses	that	the	company	will	incur.


The	complete	picture,	as	described	in	the	8-K	filing,	includes	the	following:


Depreciation	and	amortization $191,808,000


Letter	of	credit	expense	and	non-cash	stock	compensation $34,810,000


Restructuring	fees $56,016,000


Operating	income $(64,864,000)


Furthermore	a	recent	Bloomberg	article	stated	that	the	company	is	borrowing	$225	million
for	3	years	at	11.25%.


Negative	operating	income	and	borrowing	at	an	interest	rate	of	11.25%	are	hardly
indications	of	a	strong	company.


5.	Valuation	guidance	from	S-1	filing	and	options	market


The	above	valuation	of	$0.28	per	share	compares	very	favourably	with	other	“valuation
guidance”	provided	in	the	S-1	filing.


This	guidance	includes:


Conversion	price	of	Series	A	notes $0.1134

https://seekingalpha.com/article/280197-dilution-or-bankruptcy-the-future-looks-dim-for-yrc-worldwide-shareholders 4/5


Conversion	price	of	Series	B	notes $0.0618


Conversion	price	of	preferred	stock


($44.38	liquidation	preference	per	share,	372.4722	common


shares	per	1	preferred	share)


$0.1192


Furthermore,	the	share	count	of	4,762,822,327	that	we	used	above	is	quite	generous
when	compared	to	the	share	count	used	by	YRCW	in	the	S-1	filing.	The	company	used	a
share	count	of	5,978,390,211	shares	to	be	issued,	representing	additional	shares	issued
to	holders	of	Series	A	and	Series	B	notes	as	payment-in-kind	for	interest	owing	to
noteholders,	and	“make	whole	premium”	for	Series	B	noteholders.


The	options	market	also	provides	a	great	indication	of	market	expectations	of	the	value	of
YRCW	stock	following	the	completion	of	the	restructuring.	As	at	the	close	of	trading	on	15
July,	the	August	$0.50	and	$1.00	calls	were	trading	with	time	value	of	close	to	zero.
Whereas	the	August	$1.00	puts	were	bid	at	$0.31,	despite	being	$0.31	out	of	the	money.
Likewise,	the	August	$1.50	puts	(trading	at	$0.19	in	the	money)	were	bid	at	$0.72	–	a	time
value	of	$0.53.


This	skew	suggests	that	most	investors	expect	a	significant	decline	in	YRCW	shares	as	a
result	of	the	impending	dilution.	We	agree	with	the	options	market,	and	have	a	price	target
of	$0.28	per	share.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	YRCW.

Frank	B.
YRCW	up	to	$8.02,	just	a	little	north	of	your	ridiculous	projection	of	$.28	a	few	years	back.	You	were	just	off	by
2984.62%.

Author’s	reply	» 	Frank	B,
We're	not	sure	if	your	comment	is	serious	or	not.	
But	just	in	case	it	is	genuine,	YRCW	did	a	1:44	split	on	2	December	2011.	Therefore	the	$8.02	price	you
mention	is	actually	$0.18	on	a	split-adjusted	basis,	which	is	well	below	the	$0.28	price	mentioned.
