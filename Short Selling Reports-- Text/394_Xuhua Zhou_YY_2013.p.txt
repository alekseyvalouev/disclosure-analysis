YY: Do You Know What You Own?
Aug. 1, 2013 11:30 AM ET148 comments
by: Xuhua Zhou


The Chinese internet has been a hot topic for investors, with the anticipated debut of
Alibaba and the growing international expansion of Wechat from Tencent
(OTCPK:TCEHY). In fact, I believe Wechat may be the first platform that can gain
international adoption of a Chinese platform and compete with the likes of Facebook
(NASDAQ:FB). Growing up in China and being a proud Chinese, I view these
developments with excitement. Yet with all excitement, we need to exercise caution. A
rising tide lifts all boats, including the undeserving ones. In this case, there is one Chinese
internet stock that is both overvalued and overhyped: YY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY). YY is very
overvalued and should not be owned at or near current levels.


Shares of YY Inc have more than quadrupled since its IPO at a price of $10.50 per share,
mostly by promoting itself as a leading social network platform with a rapidly growing user
base. Further, its ability to quickly ramp up its revenue and profits relative to other Chinese
Internet companies attracts Western investors looking for a piece of the growing Chinese
internet market. In fiscal 2012, YY reported revenues and net income of $132 million and
$14.3 million respectively. At $43 a share, YY's market capitalization is roughly $2.4
billion, over 18x its fiscal 2012 revenue.


Before even beginning to discuss the questionable financials reported, it is important to
inform those who do not know that YY is not a social network platform in China. The
western media has magically equated YY to the likes of Weibo and Facebook yet it is
really a platform that exploits women while feeding on the ego and wallets of uninformed
men.


YY's Business Model


Investors in YY should take time to understand its business model. In a Bloomberg article,
the journalist quoted a hostess, Ms. Ni.


"I'm the sexy mature type, that's what they like about me," said Ni. "You feel like a star.
Hundreds of people will respond to whatever you say."


YY primarily profits from financial patrons purchasing virtual gifts for hostesses like Ms. Ni.
Yet the entertainment content provided by these patrons is truly unflattering. Investors
should watch a video of such live interaction to understand why YY simply is not a

mainstream social network platform.


While no one could dispute that connecting patrons who purchase virtual teddy bears for a
"sexy mature" type of hostess like Ms. Ni may potentially fall into the category of a social
network, it is certainly not a mainstream social network such as Facebook or Weibo. If
anything, FriendFinder Networks may be a much closer comparable social networking
platform.


Major Issues Concerning YY


As YY is set to report another quarter today after the close, rumors are rampant as the
stock price surges. Words have spread that YY will beat analysts' estimates by over 50%
and raise its guidance. However, before posting another record quarter, YY's management
team should address concerns posted below for its investors. There are a number of
major significant warning signs spelling accounting and business issues at YY, including:


Virtually no marketing spend. YY's competitors consistently spend 15% - 20% of
revenues on marketing as a necessary condition to securing more revenues. YY
spends 2%. In the past we have seen a nearly identical phenomenon at Longtop
Financial (etc, etc) which was delisted following the resignation by auditor Deloitte.
High probability of undisclosed use of tuo, which may result in reporting false
revenues. Relevant Chinese media reports indicate YY platform attracts individual
patrons who spend tens of millions purchasing virtual gifts on YY's platform. YY's
management claims its business model is unique in China and attracts extremely
wealthy individuals who are willing to throw away millions in virtual gifts to patronize
the hostess they like. While it may be true to a certain extent, the reported spending of
over thirty million RMB by one single individual on virtual gifts defies logic and common
sense. YY lacks disclosure on its revenue concentration and the identities of its major

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 3/46


customers. It is questionable whether an auditor performed adequate procedures to
ensure the individuals spending tens of millions RMB on virtual teddy bears are in fact
unrelated third parties.
The way that the revenues could be potentially fabricated is through the use of
promoters (aka "tuo"). These promoters are company employees or affiliates who post
fake spending numbers in YY games or its music channels as part of an effort to lure
in new customers. Their efforts to lure in new customers are now coming under
scrutiny in China for defrauding customers. But the real problem is whether the
spending numbers they report amount to revenue fraud for investors in YY. YY never
publicly disclosed the existence of promoters on its platform but research indicates its
widespread existence. One industry veteran went as far as stating it is an implicit rule
in the industry. The revenue recognition is potentially problematic if some reported big
spenders on YY platform are in fact "tuo" or promoters, i.e. YY affiliates. We found
extensive commentary on Chinese online forums discussing suspicion that some of
the biggest spenders on YY platform are in fact such promoters.
The extent of YY's overstatement on the number of registered users and active users
is unprecedented. Evidence includes Taobao page where individuals can purchase
310 registered accounts for 1 RMB (value 15 cents). At the Taobao quoted price, one
can technically acquire YY's entire user base or 530 million users for approximately 1.7
million RMB or 220 thousand USD. YY further creates incentives for the registration of
zombie users. Meanwhile, multiple third party software apps exist to facilitate the log-in
of multiple user accounts. YY's official channel policy incentivizes its users to use such
software. In addition, proprietary data indicate YY's highest paying subscriber count
experienced substantial decline in the last three months. The most expensive form of
subscription, "King account," experienced a decline from 133 subscribers at the end of
March to 73 at the end of June.
Research through Baidu Trend and Weibo survey all indicate lack of interest or general
awareness of YY platform aside from avid gamers. Baidu Trend shows consistent
decline since peaking in 2011.
A lack of mobile strategy due to data limitations of Chinese network providers

Inconceivably Low Marketing Spend

5/23/2018 YY: Do You Know What You Own? - YY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 4/46


For many long and short investors who were involved in Longtop Financial (NYSE:LFT),
the biggest red flag indicating fraud was simply in plain sight for the whole time. Citron
Research's fateful April 2011 report on LFT noticed the substantial gross margin
irregularity in Longtop. While all the software peers were reporting gross margin in the mid
30% range, Longtop was reporting gross margin in excess of 60%. We believe certain line
items in YY's reported financials indicate even greater irregularity than Longtop's "industry
leading" gross margin. Compared to all of its major competitors, YY spends a tiny fraction
of its revenue on sales and marketing. The chart below shows the sales and marketing
spending as a percentage of its total revenue for fiscal year 2012 and is compiled using
data from 20Fs filed by the referenced companies.


While other leading social media, video and platform companies in China spend a
significant percentage of revenue on marketing in order to achieve growth, YY seems to
be able to do the same with minimal or nonexistent marketing spending. YY's sales and
marketing expenses from year 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 are 5 million RMB, 12 million
RMB, 13 million RMB and 17 million RMB respectively. With the exception of doubling in
the year 2010, the number has largely remained a flat line. As a percentage of revenue,
the number declined from 15% in 2009 to a mere 2% in the year 2012.


The management attributes such low sales and marketing spending to word of mouth. In
Morgan Stanley's initiation report, the analyst also noted word of mouth as the reason for
YY's spectacular low customer acquisition costs when compared to its peers. Such
explanation is simply extremely implausible because while Weibo, Yoku and Renren are
household names in China, YY is a brand few people in China have heard of. If anything,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 5/46


YY should be spending much more marketing dollars to expand awareness, not less. A
sell-side initiation report also includes the customer acquisition cost for YY and its
customer acquisition is a tiny fraction of its peers.


YY's management also allocated almost zero additional marketing spending in year 2011
and 2012 while reported revenue numbers were exploding. This of course defies common
business sense. To further demonstrate the implausibility of its sales and marketing
spending, additional analysis on marketing spending was performed on each individual
business segment of YY.


A Direct Comparable of YY Music


A few months ago, Bloomberg published a profile article featuring YY. The article
discussed the aspects of YY's business that are less mentioned in YY's regulatory filings.
Part of the true appeal of YY seems to stem from the sexual appeal of attractive girls
wearing low-cut tops. Entertainers are compensated by luring users to buy virtual teddy
bears and necklaces. In the same article, the journalist listed 9158.com as another live
broadcasting firm with virtually identical business model. Investors should navigate the
website of 9158.com and yy.com for comparison purposes.


The curious case of YY's incredibly low sales and marketing spending is only marked with
further implausibility when the CEO of 9158.com gave a substantially different marketing
spending figure when discussing the profitability at 9158.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 6/46


"Bo Zhengjun, the CEO of 9158 stated that while many think it is an extremely
profitable business, profitability is in fact very difficult. We spend 40% of our revenue
as paid commission to our entertainers, another 20% on sales and an additional
20% on marketing. There are a lot of other costs associated with the business such
as costs related to bandwidth and R&D personnel."


Assume Mr. Bo was stating the truth, 9158 would be spending close to 40% of its revenue
on sales and marketing. Yet YY spends approximately 2% while operating a substantially
similar entertainment platform. Such discrepancy is simply irreconcilable.


Online Games and Others


Aside from YY music, YY generates revenue from gaming related products. The online
gaming segment is notoriously known for its high costs of sales and marketing promotion.
Both Renren and Qihoo operate web game platforms. While Qihoo and Renren have
significant presence in China and are well-known brands, they still spend heavily to
promote their gaming platforms in order to maintain growth. YY operates its gaming
platform through a website called duowan.com. Duowan is one of the leading gaming
informational portals in China and is a direct competitor to 17173.com. According to Alexa,
17173.com is ranked as the 134th most trafficked site in China while Duowan.com is
ranked as the 102nd most trafficked site in China.


To further show the implausibility of YY's sales and marketing spending claims, investors
should look at a transaction to sell 17173.com. Per relevant disclosures, the sales and
marketing spending related to 17173.com as a gaming information portal was roughly
10% of its total revenue at the time of the transaction. Regardless, YY's extremely low
sales and marketing spending is incredibly difficult to conceive in an industry where better
known competitors are spending a substantial percentage of its revenue to maintain brand
awareness and popularity.


YY's Revenue Integrity Issues


Despite a lack of traction and the scant marketing spending, YY has thus far managed to
report record revenue since going public. As the Company is set to report its latest
earnings, rumors abound that the Company will beat the estimates by over 50% and raise
its guidance to the investing community. The stock doubled in the last month alone.
Investors thus far haven't asked any questions regarding its revenue integrity.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 7/46


But YY's revenue integrity should be a top concern for its investors. Per relevant Chinese
media reports, YY user spending is extremely skewed. In a news article dated May of
2013, it was reported that in order to support their favorite hostess in channels, the top
spender, Brother Bao, threw 5.2 million RMB to get on top, followed by another user
spending 4 million RMB. It was further reported the other eight users within the top 10
spent no less than 1 million RMB each. So, in aggregate, ten individuals spent well over
20 million RMB in a single event on YY's platform.


Logic of such spending aside, it presents a unique challenge to the auditors and it is
equally concerning YY never disclosed to its investors how spending on its platform is
distributed. There are certain SEC rules governing the disclosure of major customers.
Auditors need to make sure that each business transaction is conducted on an arm-length
basis. It is much less common and much more difficult for any auditor to verify individuals
to ensure the arm-length criteria are met.


It is unclear whether the auditor and the Company have taken appropriate measures to
ensure the individuals who spent 10 million RMB are indeed trying to support a hostess
and not trying to boost the top line of YY with round-tripped revenue. To add to the
suspicion, multiple Chinese online sources also suspect employees of YY may be posing
as customers to bid up virtual gifts and boost spending on its platform. In a Chinese article
discussing YY's business model, the journalist mentioned many YY users suspect one of
the top spenders to be a "tuo" of the company i.e. a promoter who spends money to
induce others to spend more. In a separate Q&A platform, somebody answered
definitively that platforms like YY do have "tuo" to induce its customers to spend more. YY
does not disclose whether it uses "Tuo" in its public filings and this raises significant
questions as to the integrity of YY's revenue stream. Is 100% of the revenue reported by
YY coming from independent legitimate third party customers?

5/23/2018 YY: Do You Know What You Own? - YY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 8/46


These referenced articles raise significant questions regarding the independence of YY
customers. Chinese internet users have long suspected some big spenders on YY
platform are in fact employees posing as customers to induce additional spending. While it
may be a good marketing strategy, YY's management needs to be forthcoming with U.S.
investors on its usage and how its revenue is properly recognized. If the media reports
were true, it is highly suspicious that a significant number of wealthy Chinese internet
users would in fact engage in a competition to throw away money. Moreover, YY's
management should disclose to the investing community the percentage of its revenue
coming from the top 30 spending individuals and auditors should perform customary audit
to establish the arm-length criteria on those customers.


Adding to the concerns, YY went public under the JOBS act, which exempted the
Company from an internal control assessment by the auditor. The auditor identified two
material weaknesses in their assessment. One of which is the lack of accounting
resources to fulfill GAAP accounting. While many firms went public through JOBS may
have internal control issues, it certainly becomes much more of an issue when combined
with other issues on its reported financial statements.


Unprecedented User Base Inflation


For many institutional investors, investing in a social networking company is about
investing for the future. Investors often pay less attention to the current monetization
opportunities but focus more on the company's user base and its ability to engage its user
base. On the surface, YY is doing a phenomenal job growing both its total registered user
base and its active user base. As of the end of 2012, YY's total registered user accounts
stand at 457 million and its monthly active users also stand at 70 million. YY currently
boasts a total registered user base of 530 million.


Even if we ignore the total registered user accounts, which is clearly an inflated number, a
70 million monthly active user is still an incredibly substantial figure. If this were an
accurate representation of YY's business, roughly 15% of Chinese internet population
would be signing into YY on a monthly basis. Does this figure reflect the reality of YY's
business? If not, how inaccurate is the figure?


YY publicly acknowledge in its risk factors that its reported registered and active user
count does not reflect its unique user base. Investors understand that all social network
platforms have some level of overstatement in its registered and active user count. But
they may not be aware in the case of YY, the inflation is unprecedented.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 9/46


To demonstrate, investors simply need to look at a Taobao posting which sells 310 YY
accounts for 1 RMB or 15 cents. For investors who are less familiar with the YY platform,
this probably comes both as a surprise and a puzzle. Why on earth would anyone want
310 YY accounts? To understand the issue, investors need to understand YY's own
community policies.


YY's Skewed Community Policy Calls for Abuse


While companies regularly disclose risk factors, it is investors' job to understand and
properly assess such risks. Even though YY did disclose the risks of abuse, it certainly
failed to highlight to investors how pervasive and substantial the issue is. The business
model of YY involves channel owners, entertainers and patrons. Through YY's platform,
an individual can apply for a channel and as the channel gains popularity, it can become
classified as a lesser digit channel. For example, a four-digit channel is more prominently
displayed and therefore more popular than a six-digit channel. Given that entertainers and
channel owners are paid a percentage of the virtual gifts purchased by the patrons, they
have substantial incentives to obtain and keep a low-digit channel. Per YY's own policy
governing the application, usage and forfeiture of channels, a 4-digit channel can be
applied if during the seven days prior to the application, the channel achieves a maximum
of 150 concurrent users for a two hour period for a total of five days. Upon obtaining the
channel, the channel owner still needs to maintain the 150 concurrent user number
requirement for two hours for no less than fifteen days in a thirty day cycle. Given the
strong financial incentives for the channel owners to apply and maintain low-digit
channels, which are inherently more popular and profitable, it is common practice for
channel owners to create multiple accounts and have them logged in all at the same time
to meet the popularity requirement in order to maintain their ownership of low-digit
channels. Such practices are so pervasive that there are software programs specifically
created to facilitate logging into multiple YY accounts.


There are 21 different software programs specifically dedicated for users to log into
multiple YY accounts listed on one of the websites frequented by YY users. Investors
would have to download and use one of these programs to understand how substantially
overstated the active user count is.


A number of screen shots are provided to show the extent of the issue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 10/46


Such programs allow users to login a substantial number of accounts using a single
computer. The worst part, YY's own policy in fact strongly incentivizes the channel owners
to do exactly that so they can apply for a more popular channel or keep the more popular
channel. The overstatement in YY's reported active user count is likely many orders more
substantial than the similar numbers reported by companies like SINA and Renren due to
the incentive misalignment.


Management Awareness


The management of YY is certainly well-aware of the extent to which its active user base
is overstated. It is doubtful they are benign enough to alert investors to these important
issues. As a matter of fact, it is almost comical that YY's management highlighted its lack
of ability to validate the identity and registration information of its users in its risk factor
disclosure. Register for an YY account may just be the easiest registration process in the
world. Most notably, users are not required to even provide an email address in order
to register for an account, not to mention an email notification process that is

required by many websites. We suppose management is telling investors about its
inability to police the registration process when in fact it is simply unwilling to police such
process.


Third-party Checks Show Popularity Waning


YY has been reporting significant growth in its user base over the past few years, but
some simple checks show the popularity has in fact been waning.


Baidu Index Search


YY operates a platform YY client, YY.com and Duowan.com. Baidu Index tracks the
popularity of certain key phrases and could be helpful in understanding the trend. Baidu
Index results tracking the popularity of YY to primary brand names suggest their popularity
has in fact been waning.

YY:


Alexa traffic paints a similar picture although it is less reliable due to the platform and
client software nature of YY's business.


Chinese Internet Users' Response to YY's IPO


Immediately prior to YY going public, a poll was conducted on SINA Weibo where Chinese
internet users were asked about their thoughts on the upcoming IPO of YY. The result of
the poll is very revealing.


1. It hasn't been easy for YY, Tencent somehow overlooked a niche market. (31 users,
24%)


2. 400 million users, they must really been YY or Yiyin (Chinese online slang for being
delusional), the total internet users in China only amount to 500 million. (38 users,
29%)


3. Number does not equate to loyalty, YY has substantial limitation. (19 users, 15%)

4. Once again, it's proven that the real high-value customers are financial patrons. (28
users, 21%)


5. The Panda (YY's mascot) managed to gloriously turn the corner; it's no longer just
instant noodles (Panda was also used as the trademark for a popular brand of instant
noodles in China). (11 users, 8%)


6. WOWers: YY, we can only help you this far (23 users, 18%)
7. YY still may face fierce competition from Tencent! The end game is unknown. (13


users, 10%)
8. Great! Very optimistic about YY's push into education. (14 users, 11%)
9. YY has not shown any potential or competitiveness in mobile. (10 users, 8%)


10. Online Karaoke plus social networking can produce a real public company. (5 users,
4%)


Of all the votes cast, 30% of the surveyed do not believe YY's popularity comes even
close to what was stated on its prospectus. Obviously, the management claimed the user
base has been growing even further since then. According to the most recent quarterly
results, YY commands total registered users of 526 million. Ironically, people cast the
lowest number of votes on item number 10, suggesting a substantial amount of the
surveyed individuals do not believe YY has a realistic business model to even merit being
a public company. While the vote itself does not conclusively prove the lack of popularity
of YY's platform, it should be included as an important piece of information when
evaluating the strength of YY's platform and the quality of its user base.


Challenges Abound in YY's Mobile Strategy


In the most recent quarterly conference call, YY's management attempted to alleviate
some prior concerns investors had about its mobile strategy. Investors betting on YY's
success in mobile should keep a few things in mind.


1. 3G data usage concerns. YY operates as a live video streaming platform and therefore
requires significant data usage to support the interactive features afforded by its
platform. Most Chinese smartphone users do not purchase nearly sufficient amount of
data to allow for extensive usage of live video streaming.


2. Mobile live broadcasting introduces further regulatory uncertainties. In May of 2011,
Ku6 (NASDAQ:KUTV) introduced a similar platform, which allows for mobile
broadcasting and live streaming of UGC. The platform turned out to be a flop and was
subsequently shut down. Sources stated that part of the reason for the shutdown
relates to regulatory issues and the difficulty in policing such UGC. It is simply too easy
to broadcast certain censored materials through mobile. For example, somebody may

broadcast a gambling game or a fight when such content would typically be heavily
censored in traditional video uploading sites.


Insider Sale


Lei Jun, a well-respected Chinese VC investor has sold over 500 thousand shares on
behalf of his firm at $27 and the stock is currently trading at $43.6.


Conclusion


At its current valuation, YY presents a compelling short opportunity. In addition to an
incredibly rich valuation, significant fraud risks exist due to its substantial growth with
unexplained low sales and marketing spending. Further, its user base is much more
substantially overstated compared to its peers. Finally, YY's platform expansion may be
limited by its initial market position and its defined user base. Much of its user base
appears to be either avid gamers or financial patrons of young attractive female
entertainers. It is simply a much different platform than the mainstream social networking
platforms such as Facebook or Weibo, and it is loaded with red flags and high fraud risks
for all investors.


Disclosure: I am short YY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.


 Like this article


raining2009
YY is clearly undervalued given its growth potential. 
YY has strong sustainable competitive advantage, and terrific growth potential. It just begin to profit, expect its profit to
rise 100% or so in next few years. Its P/E will soon fall to around 20-30 level. 
Expect YY to reach $100 easily in next one or two years.


There are also lots of doubt and short interest in TSLA, but TSLA's stock price skyrocket every day. Shorting such
stocks is like suicide. If you are not on the bull side of these stocks, at least avoid shorting them. Shorting YY or TSLA
is the sure way to suicide.

Great analysis, except one thing, looks you never use any YY products. Why don't sign in to contribute one more user
base and stay there to watch what's really happen in the virtual entertainment society and record how many online
users on most of hot channels and add them together, count how many gifts (most are small gifts worth only around 1
Yuan, which is not worth TUO) has been ordered? For sure, there will be some Tuo(which btw, their earn money from
YY too) or other fake things there, just like anything else in China or even the world? but, their business is real.


Or maybe you did sign in but just don't enjoy these type of hot girls, it doesn't matter, most people there do.


Talking about value, it is probably over valued but you don't want to short them for sure.

Author’s reply »  I have in fact tried its products and forced myself on the platform for an extended period of
time. People in general should go check out the platform and make their own conclusions. I don't deny the
platform holds appeals to a very specific niche group but it is not a mainstream social media like Weibo. Yet
the valuation on this thing is incredibly rich for a much lower tier platform despite all the issues I presented in
the article.


I like the fact you acknowledge they use Tuo in their business. Where is the disclosure to investors. How are
they accounting for the revenue that is generated by Tuo rather than legitimate good faith arm-length
customers? Are they commingled? If so, they have a serious issue in terms of revenue recognition that
constitutes fraud.

YY went through a traditional IPO. There were negative articles about QIHU and NQ mobile as well. Look at
how those two chinese small caps have performed... Quite well. I actually own NQ and have been quite
pleased with my return. For ONP, I was under the impression they were not guilty of fraud. Poor management,
yes. Fraud, no.


CCME & RINO were reverse merger and frauds. Thats part of the problem with reverse mergers. Theres
much less regulatory scrutiny on these companies. Chinese companies happen to be getting all the headline
press on this, but there have been plenty of US frauds in the past. Theres also plenty of ongoing frauds in the
US OTC markets as well.

The author does not understand YY's business. YY is not soley a "social media, video and platform company". YY is
more like an online Entertainment and Education provider with live performers and teachers.


YY has little marketing spending because it does not need it. It markets through YY's existing users to their family and
friends because of its attractiveness. That is why its user inflation is unprecedented and the author could not
understand.


Each of YY's registered user accounts (that can give out gift to the performers) has an active mobile phone number
associated with it. I do not think FB or RENN have this policy.


YY does not have a true "competitor" in China right now, or in other countries. RENN, FB, SINA, QIHU, TCEHY, they
are all NOT YY's competitors. People visit YY website for Entertainment and online Education, not for social.


You can consider YY as 30-year-ago BBC or NBC. Or you can consider YY as 10-year-ago TCEHY. You can not
consider it as a social platform solely.


01 Aug 2013, 04:50 PM

Author’s reply »  That is utter nonsense. Why doesn't QIHU spend any money on marketing if they can just
rely on family and friends' word of mouth. What about 9158, which runs the exact same business?


It is not TRUE that YY requires a cell phone number to register an account when one can purchase 300+ YY
accounts for 1RMB.


It is funny you guys promote YY as the next tencent when there's absolutely not basis that its platform
provides any meaningful traction..Retail investors who lack understanding of the Chinese sector should stay
clear of names like this to avoid another episode of RTO debacle in 2011.

It makes no sense to buy 300+ accounts with 1RMB. You need real money from your bank to be transferred
to your account to give out gifts, unless you take part in some of the promotion activities such as playing
games, which in turn might lure more money from your packet later....:-(


Those online live programs and games are extremely attractive to the young people between 15~25s, as long
as they have a computer and internet, or a mobile smartphone. That is a huge population, over 200millions of
people in China as potential contributors to the profit of YY.


I would say to short YY is as risky as to long RENN/FB, even though RENN/FB jumped in the last couple of

Some concerns:


2. For a writer that asks a lot of questions about a company - meaning you don't have the answers or proof of
your positions - you certainly throw around the word "fraud" a lot. You demand answers and identities of
purchasers. Have you heard of privacy?

3. I haven't viewed the content you are questioning. From what I read, including the comments, it could be
something like porn to sexy females singing and acting or them just trying to turn on guys in a non-nude way.
You doubt so much money can come from this type of activity. Do you know how much money the porn
industry makes? Much of it doesn't even involve interaction with the "object."

1, their is very little retail investors in YY or Most of the Chinese names because of the blowup in 2009-2011. So YY,
vips, qihu.nq are mostly getting run up in strong institutional hands not retail investors. - That's why shorts are getting
imploded and most of the articles in SA by China shorts have zero effect.

You didn't understand YY or you ignore below points: 
1. YY's platform has economy scale or its platform is very scalable. After adding some new clients, its earning can
skyrocket (because the fixed cost is the same). So YY is easy to have fast earning growth and easy to improve profit
margin. 
2. YY has strong network effect, combined with first mover advantage, YY has a strong sustainable competitive
advantage, or strong moat. Others are difficult to compete with YY. 
3. YY has tremendous growth potential. It just cooperate with "Happy Boy" in Hunan TV. And its education haven't
turn to a profit yet. This is a good thing, when its education become profitable, the stock price will skyrocket again. 
4. YY is significantly undervalued. Its forward P/E is just around 20. Considering its tremendous growth potential and
near-term growth rate at 100%, 20 forward P/E is significantly undervalued. Given its growth, YY is one of the most
undervalued stocks in US market.

30 millions are nothing in today's china when a 1000sqft apartment costs more than 5 millions of RMB. There
are millions of apartments in the city of Beijing itself. And some families own tens of them.


If you stay in any of the hottest channels of YY for more than two hours, you will understand how they make
profits. With over 10,000 visitors EVERYDAY watching/listening the performance, and contributing gifts to the
performer, that channel is simply a cash collecting machine. The visitors are contributing with little amount of
money, usually like 0.1 RMB each time. But the base is huge so the sum is huge. I would not be surprised
that they make over one millions of profit from that single channel.

You mentioned most of the users are from 15 ~ 25, I doubt whether Chinese people at this age can own tens

purchased came from YY affiliates, or tuo. The real legitimate customers are much smaller than what
appears. The company overstates its revenue number to include virtual spending by its affiliates...that's the
issue here


Moreover, this is a stupid argument to say that because there are a lot of rich people therefore people are
spending money on YY..A lot of other things you can do with 30 million RMB such as buying a few ferraris for
fun...

Download and install the YY PC Client from YY.com. Try a channel like 2086, 2135, 2429 or other top listed
channels. These singers attracted over 15,000 listeners everyday during their performance time slots. Add up
the money contributed from their top 50 fans listed on the right of the video screens to see how much revenue
they are generating weekly. (Note that 100 red diamonds equals 1RMB.)


These performers (and many others) are on the track to become virtual superstars with YY's expansion. They
attract fans with their excellence as singers as well as their good personality.


Since some of them come from rich families with friends and classmates who are truly rich too. I acknowledge
that some of the top contributors to their channels are possibly their friends or relatives in real world. But this
is not the key.


The key is that, the performers are growing rapidly to start to publish new songs written solely for them. And
to some extend, they are contracted to YY.

YY surfaced on my radar screen one month ago. As a 30's adult chinese, I never heard YY before. Initially, I
was skeptical about its profitability and the integrity of its financial report, as you wrote in the article. It should
be a target of famous shorter like muddy water and its fraud should be uncovered easily as you can found
these clues through secondary research. But why YY's stock price remains high and has been rising since
your post?


I cannot answer this question until I found it is owned by LeiJun, who is dubbed as "Chinese Steve Jobs" to
disrupt low cost smart phone market in China and has achieved few milestones with his phones in China. I
also found YY is the only public trade shell he owns in the U.S stock market and he is owning 20% of YY.


My explanation of YY's "Overvalue" is that institutional investors of YY are betting on Mr. Lei may use YY as
the vehicle to introduce his smartphone product to the world and raise capital in the U.S capital market. In this
regard, Mr. Lei should not make fraud on YY's financial document at the expense of his reputation and future
wealth, which could be ten times more than the gain from cheating in YY. BTW, he also owns a HK stock
market trade company. As we all know, u.s market is the top choice for fund raising.

Well, my man, very interesting. This is the first I've read a serious bash of YY which is one of the hottest stocks of

No doubt people will call you crazy and a liar. Only time will tell. I've seen no one else call YY out. If you are correct, I
think you'll have established a lot of credibility.


If you are short, you could still get blown out because this market is not interested in fact-checking momo names.
Many traders will pile on as they did with TSLA. Valuation goes out the window in a bull market.


Good luck with your investment, if short. Market loving YY story so far.

ari5000
Should point out the float of YY is under 7 million -- it is extremely easy for this stock to get ramped simply on tight
liqudity. XONE had the same structure. If this falls apart, it will eventually fold on secondarys, or insider selling. Until
then, this can just float upward as all available shares get taken up by momo players, forcing the price upward until
shorts get margin calls.

websites can provide much more information for your reference. Also when the market keeps going the
opposite direction as what u predicted, please don't always think u are the only one know the ultimate FACT, it
will really kill u. 
As a long long time speculator, to me, buying stock is changing my class in the society, so every time I bet
more than 100% on one stocks! frankly speaking! I never short any stocks! although I don't trust NQ, and
don't like QIHU, but I prefer spending much more time to find some good companies that may really change
the world, like TSLA, even extremely high valuation, but u know time is her friend, one day she may catch the
high value. We are not opponent, and I see some of the comment is really for your own good. To short YY,
why not just buy SFUN, or even BADU, YHOO? You already win a bit, why insisting on the believe it is fraud? 
Anyway, good luck man, hope u can survive from the speculating world. 
BTW, if short better short NQ instead of YY.

Author’s reply »  Timothy Chan - Morgan Stanley 
Hi, good morning everyone. Congratulations on a very solid quarter, and thanks very much for taking my questions. I
have two questions.


If we look at your strong music performance in second quarter, I'm wondering what's the driver for that. Is it due to
your new music package or new layout of YY Music or is it better seasonality? I have a second question after that.
Thank you.


Eric He - CFO 
Tim, thank you for your questions. Yes, second quarter was a very good quarter. For the music question, because you
asked some specific drivers, so I would -- I will answer your question.


Yes, you know, in the second quarter this year, the music performed very, very well as we alluded that the music
revenue actually exceeded our expectation as well. Obviously we have a lot of activities going on a daily basis. For
confidential reasons, we are not going to disclose all of them. But I can just point out a couple of examples.


For example, from the business running angle, we have a lot of marketing campaigns that's geared towards different
parties. For example, you know, May 20th, 520 in Chinese can be found like I love you. So, you know, May 20th in

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 26/46


fact is the internet Valentine's Day in China. So we build marketing activities around that May 20th activities. So these
activities really is geared toward our performance. So we will incentivize our performers who will get as many as
[inaudible] then their levels or their ratings will be enhanced. So a lot of performers, they are very incentivized to earn
as much as the virtual items they can get. So that's one activity which was very successful.


There's another one actually is more related to our Guild. You know, Guild is one of the organizations in YY's platform,
they're very active. So every year we will have a rating for our Guild. You know, so the Guild members look upon their
rankings of their Guild very, very seriously. So they want to be in the high rank the Guild. So we provide something
like a competition among guilds in terms of their activities, in terms of their sponsorship. So the members want to
heighten their rankings on their guilds, so they participate on a lot of content. So for that, what we call yearend
ceremony [Chinese language spoken] in the second quarter, it was very, very popular as well.


There are some other activities we actually was running around users. For example, we will give out some incentive
or coupon to our users if they participate more, and they can use that coupon to buy the virtual items. All of those
activities in second quarter has been run very orderly and very efficiently, so the music business actually exceeded
our expectations

Author’s reply »  I want to draw investors attention to this specific part of YY's earnings conference call. The analyst
community is indeed bewildered by YY's wide margin earnings and revenue beat given the lack of specific traction or
marketing activities in the quarter. YY posted revenue number over 20% ahead of expectation when the underlying
business was expected to perform inline. Tim at MS asked the question: how did you do it?


The CFO's response is elusive at best but the specific he did give raises significant issues with YY's business model
and the high likelihood of revenue fraud. The CFO stated that Guild is an organization on YY's platform and YY
members look at the rankings and therefore compete for the rankings. The very existence of such organization raises
questions about their independence. Is YY's management or insiders involved in any way shape or form manipulating
the revenue? YY's revenue beat is completely bewildering...unexplai... likely fraudulent.


Finally, investors should take notice in the trading of YY shares. Clearly a lot of insider trading is going on in the stock.
The run up in the stock ahead of a substantial earnings beat is almost unprecedented.


02 Aug 2013, 09:57 AM


leagfino
The question "how did you do it?" comes out whenever you make big progress that surprises everybody. It is
like a complimentary comment more than something being negative. With the "happy boy" events going on
during the 3rd quarter, YY might beat expectation by another 20%. Do not be surprised again at the time.


By the way, the exact MS question was "If we look at your strong music performance in second quarter, I'm
wondering what's the driver for that. " And Timothy (from MS)'s response to YY's answer of the question was
"That's very comprehensive. "

How to address this? 
• YY's Q3 guidance is for revenue of RMB430M-RMB440M ($70.1M-$71.8M), good for 88%-92% Y/Y growth and well
above a consensus of $61.4M. 
• Q2 music services (YY Music) revenue +189% Y/Y to $27.8M (42% of total) thanks to a 174% increase in paid users
to 635K. 
• Online game revenue +87% Y/Y to $24.8M. Paid users +61% to 440K, Q2 ARPU +16% to RMB346 ($56.72). 
• Online ads +42% to $6.9M, other revenue (membership program) +149% to $7.1M. 
• Opex doubled Y/Y to $22.4M thanks to higher R&D and G&A spend. But since gross profit rose 136% Y/Y on the
back of 118% rev. growth, op. margin rose to 20.2% from 12.7% a year ago.

Could not understand why "The platform has been stagnant and user growth is lagging". Any details?


In YY's earning transcript, it write: "Revenue from YY Music increased by 189% year over year to RMB170.6
million. This increase primarily reflect a 174% increase in the number of paying users to 635,000 with ARPU
of RMB269 during the second quarter 2013". They are counting "paying users" who transferred money from
their banks to YY and spend, not some fishy accounts.

Tianci spent over 30mil on YY platform.


03 Aug 2013, 01:04 AM


eric_wuwei
I think the author over stretched the fact on marketing spending. It is true YY spends little compared with other
companies. However, this does not mean that YY is a foul play here. Similar thinkg happened on QIHU. At early time,
QIHU got most of its income from a single web page. Many shorts questions QIHU's accounting based this fact. But it
turns out QIHU's accounting was accurate.


For investors, please check the following information: 
1)Who were the underwriters for YY's initial public offering? 
Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup were lead joint book runners and Pacific Crest Securities LLC and
Piper Jaffray & Co. were co-managers for the offering. 
2)Who is YY Inc. independent auditor? 
PWC Services, LLC.


PWC has not been found any accounting problems in China. This should give some confidence on YY's financial
accounting.


03 Aug 2013, 03:05 PM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Lets debunk each claim of yours. The IPO book manager means very little as we all know.
Longtop was bookrun by Goldman when it went public and it turned out to be a complete scam.


Next, let's move onto the auditor. YY is audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian CPAs Limited
Company...this track record of this company is in fact incredibly spotty. Among its auditing clients, CMED was
a notorious fraud. AMBO also turned out to be a complete scam and it is another client of Zhong Tian. Wonter
Auto Tech, WATG, is another client of PWC Zhongtian...You should do a little more research before coming
out saying YY's auditor has not been found any accounting problems in China...YY's auditor has A LOT of
accounting problems in China!


03 Aug 2013, 05:17 PM


Trade Star, Contributor
Couple of observations.


1. Would you rather have a boutique book running the IPO or MS/DB/C? Having respected bookrunners is
partially about syndication ability and prestige, but also about the ability of those banks to properly conduct
DD. GS messed up on Longtop. So what. Do you know how many fraudulent companies there are in the US?
Tons. Its about minimizing risk, not ex-ing out an entire asset class.


2. PWC has a fairly decent track record. AMBO is still TBD. I'll admit, it doesnt look good, but until a definitive
judgement has been made, it can as easily be classified as poorly managed. CMED was originally audited by

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 30/46


KPMG. PWC tried to fix the problems but ultimately failed to untangle the prior mess. WATG was a reverse
merger. Those all have issues with disclosures and subjective filing requirements. Should YY be lumped in
with those? I dont see why. You are trying to assign guilt by association. At this point, YY has been issued a
clean bill of health and to assume PWC is not doing their jobs (especially now given the extra scrutiny levied
on Chinese companies) seems premature.


In addition, I'd like to point out the CFO for YY is highly respected. Eric He is an MBA/CPA/CFA
(http://bit.ly/14T4RBT) with prior public company experience and a long tenure working with US firms. If you
really think this guy is about to toss his career on some make believe 30M teddy bears, you are probably
underestimating him. Regarding advertising spend and proclivities of "fans" paying egregious amounts of
money for what you consider a stupid business model, let me refer you to another business model that is
similar in concept and equally as profitable. http://yhoo.it/14T4RBV


Ricks' dosent spend a ton of money on advertising. And for some strange reason, men seem willing to spend
thousands, if not millions on the entertainers.


03 Aug 2013, 06:53 PM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Your points are all valid. I'm merely pointing out all the issues with YY in the article. I'm not
here to prove anything definitively; nor do I have the capability to do so. YY's got a lot of strangeness going
on. I agree each individual one of them may be explainable but when combined together, the company's
reported financials are highly suspicious. On the auditor, I'm just pointing out it's not an auditor with a perfect
track record. That alone doesn't spell any guilt whatsoever but when combined with all the other red flags..it
should be of concern to investors.


On the CFO...I dunno if I would call Eric a highly respected CFO. The Giant Interactive IPO was a classic bait
and switch. Go read the class action and look at the history..It is not a CFO I would give a lot of credit to for
having high integrity and honesty to investors. Furthermore, Friday's trading action spells loud and clear on
the extent of the massive insider trading that occurred with YY. The insider traders piled in ahead of a hugely
positive earnings report only to liquidate the day after. It is embarrassing to say the least.


FWIW, your comparison between Rick's and YY is completely unreasonable..Rick's is a 86 million dollar
company and YY's 2.4 billion. There really isnt anything to extrapolate here.


04 Aug 2013, 06:54 PM


Trade Star, Contributor
Eric's accomplishments far outweigh the GA disclosure issue. The penalty was a slap on the wrist. How many
public companies have legal issues outstanding? Tons. We're talking about fraud vs a lapse in judgement.
Eric's accomplishments speak for themselves. He still has his CFA designation. If you think hes truly been
dishonest and fraudulent, why dont you complain to AIMR?


The ricks comparison was highly relevant. You noted that you dont understand why people throw money at
these performers. Why someone would allegedly spend "30M" on teddy bears. etc etc. I've merely pointed out
that there are plenty of examples of industries that advertise very little and yet have large audiences where

patrons spend a lot of money on entertainment. When you take into context how fragmented Rick's industry is
and how small a niche player they are, it makes a lot more sense as to YY's valuation.


04 Aug 2013, 07:59 PM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Ha...I don't know CFA designation does any good to somebody who cheats investors. If
anything, the smarter that person is, the more concerned investors should be...I have filed complaints with the
SEC on insider trading as well as potential of fraud. We'll see if the commission polices the situation or not.
From my perspective, the Giant's class action is not a lapse of judgement..investors were intentionally duped.


I find it utterly stupid to compare Rick's with YY. Rick's operates physical strip clubs while YY operates virtual
stuff. When you go to rick's, u get actual action...on YY, it's all virtual stuff. It's a joke to compare those two to
start with. Secondly, the key here is YY claims itself to be a social network company, not a pool of strip
clubs..Investors certainly should comp it with other social networking firms rather than a strip club operator.
Anyone with half a brain should see the difference here and I find it pointless to further argue the issue with
you. Feel free to invest in YY and I'll happily bet against you...


04 Aug 2013, 11:57 PM


Trade Star, Contributor
Touchy. I thought we were having a civilized discussion here. Its very clear you can have your CFA
designation revoked. If you believe there is a good case for fraud, I suggest you report him to AIMR. GA was
never convicted of Fraud. A lapse in judgement on disclosure materiality yes, fraud no. You are claiming that
YY is outright willfully defrauding investors and that Eric is a direct agent with little or no morals or
respectability. I do not believe that to be the case.


You can disagree with my comparison all you want. I was not comparing a virtual world to a physical strip
club. I was bringing up the point that men / people pay for stupid things for performers all the time. It happens
in the virtual world, it happens in strip clubs. Do I think they should be "comps" per se? No. As you correctly
noted, the business models are not similar enough. I just wanted to point out that people pay for stupid things.
30M rmb for teddy bears seems egregious, however larger amounts have been spent on dumber things. Just
because you do not see the value for the entertainment provided on YY does not mean others to not. If you
dont think its comparable, then we'll agree to disagree. However, to say I have half a brain is uncalled for. I've
been nothing but cordial with you. My comparison is completely legitimate.


05 Aug 2013, 01:13 AM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Fair enough. You can believe what you want to believe I suppose. I personally find it
troubling given the quality of the entertainment content and the alleged amount that's spent on the platform by
individuals. I came to the conclusion that the likelihood is high that some of these big spenders are not
independent and legitimate customers. I'm not proving anything definitively here but merely raising the issue
to the investment community. Investors should make their own determination as to whether to believe the
management's story or not. I personally do not. The last point I would want to make is 2.4 billion can buy you

I do not like the author's words talking about the performers of YY. Many of the channel hostesses on YY are
hardworking and talented young people. They earn money by providing excellent online entertainment
programs to visitors and subscribers, by singing, dancing, talking.... These programs are just like TV
programs, except they are more interactive and customer involved.


To insult people by making inaccurate comments on their clothing is not the way to make any point here. The
screen shot in the author's article is biased and not representative too. Most of the hostesses, especially
those top-ranked ones, are dressed decent and elegant in fashion. To behavior well is critical for them to
retain visitors in their channels to survive competition from peers.

man(money from family) , having too much money and yy is a good way for him to prove his money-privilege,
especially over beauty girls. for them , money is just a number in games, is just garbage.


i know he competes with other rich men for a girl (zhubo) in one day spending more than a million. when you are rich

Author’s reply »  Hilarious..I agree there are a lot of people with more money than what to do with; still there
are a lot of ways to spend money. I find it much more likely the company is cheating investors by accounting
for revenue sourced from affiliated parties than a significant amount of chinese rich people spending millions
buying virtual teddy bears. Auditor and the SEC should investigate and confirm to the investors that those
folks are indeed legitimate independent third party customers. It is crucial to the integrity of YY's reported
revenue. I think investors need to first be aware of those situations and secondly be careful and cautious
when deciding whether to believe those claims.

Nice, I hope more people short YY, so I can grab more YY at cheaper price. 
Most people are just short-sighted. They only see YY's price is temporarily overbought from technical point of view.  
What people don't see is YY's price will increase many folds in next few years. 
The longer you see, the more profitable you will become. 
YY's business model is one of the best. Of course only people with insight can see its value. That's a good thing, if
everyone can see the value in YY's business model, YY's price already much higher than 100. It's the people who
don't understand the value in YY's business model give us opportunities to buy YY at a discounted and undervalued
price.

YY's growth potential haven't been understood by author, so doubt is reasonable. 
most of Chinese businessman are crook, you can say that. but that doesn't prove the CEO of YY is such a man. 
YY music idea comes from 9158.com or 6.cn, these websites already proved individual online show is a money print
machine. allegedly 1 billion revenue of 9158.com in 2012. YY copied 9158.com's business model and quickly made a
fortune based its huge user base. 
now situation is very clear, online show is a big golden mine in China. 
QQ just lauched a online show to copy YY music in April 2013.  
this business model is so real.  
because of YY's technical feature is very much like QQ IM, it is easy for YY to employ more business model on its
platform, just like QQ did. YY music is just a good start. 
yy will blow your mind again and again like QQ did. 
If YY can maintain its leading position on multimedia technique, I expect it is a ten-tenbagger in ten years.

Agree, network effect combined with first mover advantage is a huge sustainable competitive advantage.
Consider YY to become 2nd EBAY or Tencent. Both Ebay and Tencent are the perfect example of network
effect combined with first mover advantage. YY's business model is the same. 
And check YY's P/E, different site has different numbers now. On TDAmeritrade, YY P/E is only 20. On
Morningstar.com, YY's P/E is 15. Yahoo's P/E is highest at 49 but with forward P/E 24. On google finance,

YY's P/E is also 20. So the average P/E from above sites are around 20-25. 
Can you imagine a company with over 100% earning growth rate only has a P/E around 20? 
YY is your dream stock, and is ridiculously undervalued, actually it is one of the most undervalued stock in the
US market. 
I even can recommend people to put 100% of their money to YY if their portfolio is not big.  
In short, YY has one of the best growth potential and is one of the most undervalued stocks on the street.  
Buy as much as you can.


06 Aug 2013, 10:43 PM


Justin Kundrat, Contributor
this was possibly the worst written investment thesis of all time.


So you're saying. 
1. YY will become ebay 
2. YY has a low (20-25 PE ratio) 
3. YY is growing (yes it is, if you believe the rev #s aren't inflated) 
4. Therefore it's one of the most undervalued stocks on the US market 
5. Forget diversification, put ALL of your money in this stock. Enron guys! Look!


07 Aug 2013, 10:22 AM


raining2009
Go to Google finance, and check its P/E yourself. 
I didn't say YY will become Ebay, I just say both of their business model are one of the best. They share same
kind of moat. 
Time will tell whether put all your money to YY is good or not (for a small portfolio). For large portfolio, of
course you need to have more stocks. 
As Buffett said, diversification is only for people who didn't really understand the company's business

@Justin


I dont think Raining is saying that YY will become the next ebay. Raining is making the point that a network
effect is a tremendous benefit for first movers. As for Raining's other points, the PE issue is due to differences
in EPS estimates. CapIQ vc Firstcall, vs whatever proprietary database each website uses. The point is, all of
them are pointing at a 20-25 fwd PE for a company growing topline at almost 100% and earnings at 50%.

Believe it or not, this is still considered a value stock. Where does Raining says its the most undervalued
stock on the US market? Or is that just your interpretation of what Raining wrote?


For diversification, you have to look at Raining's caveat. If your portfolio is not too big, then why not roll it all
into one holding. If your portfolio is 5-10k, why not? Its not like you have much to lose.


Lastly, show a little respect to the other people on this board. "worst written investment thesis?" A bit rude
dont you think?


07 Aug 2013, 02:20 PM


Justin Kundrat, Contributor
His words were: "YY is your dream stock, and is ridiculously undervalued, actually it is one of the most
undervalued stock in the US market."


So yeah, he did call it one of the most undervalued stocks on the market.


As for respect, sure it was rude. I apologize for that. But it's not nearly as rude as some of the other
comments on here that are instantly rejecting the author's hypothesis just because they are long the stock.
I'm all for argument and debate, but only when the argument has logic and well-researched support, not
people saying "this stock has a low P/E ratio, therefore it's cheap, therefore it'll double", or "you're wrong, this
is a 10 bagger", with absolutely no backing.


The ideas aren't the problem, it's the absurd claims.


 
And in addition, minimal diversification is fine. I do the same thing with a smaller portfolio, but he really didn't
provide good logic for why someone should be putting all of their money in this stock, especially amidst what
seems like a pretty valid argument that their numbers are inflated. Would you go and put all your money in
FB? Or ZNGA? Or GRPN? No? Why? Because it's a risky tech stock that isn't (or recently became) profitable
and is heavily dependent on user growth and beating top line estimates that will eventually become
unsustainable.


07 Aug 2013, 02:49 PM


Trade Star, Contributor
fair enough on the "undervalued stocks" I missed that part. I think the rest of your statement was overboard
however. From a valuation perspective, YY is still fairly undervalued given its growth prospects. You can
believe or not believe in the financials, thats your prerogative. You can believe or not believe the street
estimates as well. Thats data for you to use and interpret as you see fit. Some people think its all hocus
pocus numbers and worthless. If you do, cool. Then short the stock or find a different investment. I on the
other hand do not want to toss out an entire asset class just because a company is Chinese. Theres a lot of
ways to minimize investment risk. YY has a lot of attractive attributes. 1. tangible product. 2. traditional IPO
with major wallstreet banks, 3. institutional support. 4. PWC auditor. 5. tons of cash on the balance sheet.
These are all the things you want to see in a chinese company.

As for a P/E based valuation methodology, theres nothing wrong with looking at investments on a P/E basis. I
do it all the time. I do a bottom's up valuation as well but for the most part, a lot of these tech/chinese
companies are cheap beyond belief. You just need to know what to look for in terms of legit vs likely frauds.


07 Aug 2013, 02:59 PM


Justin Kundrat, Contributor
I agree with you. Definitely not supporting the "short the Chinese stock" game. And while I agree that
estimates are estimates, they are ultimately supporting the stock. The prices are dictated by funds/managers
since they're the ones with the money, and most of them are setting estimates by which they base their price
targets. So a company missing these estimates can often times result in selling/liquidating of positions by
these larger funds.


I'm not saying you shouldn't own the stock, nor am I saying your argument is wrong. I was more countering
the first argument made by raining2009 because there wasn't much to it. Your argument appears to be a bit
better rounded (although I'd disagree with the tangible product thing... it's a web based service in the same
way GRPN or YELP is, right?). Also, auditors, especially international divisions, can get things wrong all the
time. With a lack of internal control oversight to sign off on, it's certainly a red flag. The auditor will perform
their procedures to ensure everything checks out, but that's no guarantee of anything. To your support though
is the fact that FCF/Revenue % has been growing each of the last three years, which is hard to argue against
since cash can't be manipulated. That in itself makes it difficult for me to short the stock.


P/E is a fine measure, but not by itself. The P/E was the only thing he mentioned as to why the company is
cheap which isn't good logic.


07 Aug 2013, 03:08 PM


Trade Star, Contributor
Actually, prices are dictated by the last person buying. Be it a fund or retail. Most institutional funds will look at
research but derive their own thesis and estimates. Research is just a data point. For YY, the bulk of the
share are still held by the company or retail. Institutional interest is only around 25% of the shares.


For tangible - I'm speaking strictly from the sense that a US investor can go to their website and see the
product and interest in the company and verify that its a real product. Its not like chinese vegetable oil, or a
payment processor, some other hard to verify product.


I have to disagree with your auditors statement. Especially as it relates to a big 4 firm. With all the issues of
chinese fraud in the past, auditors, bankers and lawfirms are extremely diligent when it comes to Chinese
IPO's. For banks/auditors/lawyers, theres reputational risk, but also culpability. Damages from these offerings
can reach into the multiples of the original offering amount. The current crop of Chinese IPOs are thoroughly
audited and reviewed. YY went public fairly recently. So their numbers should still be pretty clean.


Agreed on the P/E measure. Its a good initial screen. Realistically however, any projection you make for YY
will be wrong. ITs how close to being right you can be. For a company growing this fast, and it being a high
margin internet company, its pretty nonsensical to do much in terms of fundamental analysis.

raining2009
@Justin 
"I was more countering the first argument made by raining2009 because there wasn't much to it" 
That is not my first argument, I made my points about YY very clearly in previous post: 
1. YY's platform has economy scale or its platform is very scalable. After adding some new clients, its earning
can skyrocket (because the fixed cost is the same). So YY is easy to have fast earning growth and easy to
improve profit margin. Scalable platform/business is easy to have faster earning growth than traditional
business. 
2. YY has strong network effect, combined with first mover advantage, YY has a strong sustainable
competitive advantage, or strong moat. Others are difficult to compete with YY. 
3. YY's customer base is very stable, there are strong customer stickiness. That means customers are difficult
to switch to other websites. 
4. YY has tremendous growth potential. It just cooperate with "Happy Boy" in Hunan TV. And its education
haven't turn to a profit yet. This is a good thing, when its education become profitable, the stock price will
skyrocket again.


When consider buying a growth stock, below points need to be considered 
1. growth rate and growth potential 
2. competition, prefer no competition or little competition with high entry barrier, this point actually means the
certainty of future growth 
3. good profitability and low business risk 
4. fair price


For 1st) point, YY's growth rate is terrific and still has huge growth potential. The company just turn to profit,
lots of growth potential still waits ahead.


2nd) point, in the earning call, when analyst asks management how YY maintain its competitive advantage
during a competitive market. YY's management say during the first phase, YY beat competitors by better
technology. Then the second phase, YY develop an ecosystem. To rephrase this, it is actually the network
effect combined with first mover advantage. By beating competitors on better technology, YY's build first
mover advantage. When YY develop its ecosystem, this is actually network effect. As more users attract more
singers/showers on YY channel, it will in turn attract more users to YY, forming a virtuous cycle. Don't
overlook the power of network effect and first mover advantage. Ebay and Tencent both knock out
competitors by this combination. High growth and good profitability means nothing when there is no moat,
because other competitors will easily mimic you, so moat is the key in a high growth industry. 
Network effect and first mover advantage is THE most important reason why I long YY and have such a
strong conviction about YY's future growth. If you don't think it is important or ignore this point, then you will
never recognize YY's value, until several years later YY's price rise many times more.


3rd) point, YY just become profitable, this is good thing, it means YY is still in its early phase of growth, there
are more growth potential left. And YY has good profitability. With high customer stickiness, YY's has a low
business risk.

5/23/2018 YY: Do You Know What You Own? - YY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593492-yy-do-you-know-what-you-own 39/46


4th), you can say YY is not undervalued by only looking at its P/E. But if you consider its growth potential and
growth rate, I believe YY is clearly undervalued. YY's PEG is around 0.5-0.6, definitely a undervalued growth
stock.


You shouldn't neglect YY's education platform. YY's education, if success, will also have strong network effect
+ first mover advantage. As more users/students using YY's education platform, it will attract more teachers,
then in turn attract more students to YY. There is a huge profit potential here if succeed.


And another point about education and why it is so good for YY's future price. Because education hasn't profit
yet, so even if YY's education fail and never make a profit in future, it won't affect YY's price much because it
is not making profit now. But if education succeed, it will add a lot profit to YY's EPS.  
So if YY's education fail, YY's price won't fall much, but if education succeed, YY's price will skyrocket. This is
a very favorable risk-reward ratio and definitely worth the bet.  
If you read the book Market Wizards, you will find this thinking is actually the Michael Steinhardt's "Variant
Perception". And this thinking will help you to make more money in the market.


Given above, YY definitely is one of "my" dream stock (I am a growth stock investor). I can't understand why
there are people shorting it. And I also don't think my conclusion is "the worst written investment thesis of all
time" 
Maybe a few years later, you will find "the worst written investment thesis of all time" become one of the most
profitable investment ideas :)

Very good, after the coming CB raising YY almost has 500M USD cash, very powerful for an internet
company. I really wanna to mention YY chairman, I chase him since he is in Kingsoft. He does change a lot,
and he is drawing a very big picture in China mobile internet industry.  
BTW, one point wanna add to YY business, folks, if u ever see China The Voice, u will understand much more
on what's today Chinese society, lots of people is fighting for their dreams, singing is just one of it, and YY
provides one of the channel for them as the first step to pursue their dream. 
To me, YY is good stock, which in 2013 around 34 pe, not cheap, but in 2014 down to less than 20 pie, not
bad to invest but not 100% speculation stock. 
PS, YY chairman, really the one who u can keep an eye on, his companies definitely worth to spend a few
weeks to dig.

I am checking the landscape of China net industry. It seems to me a few giants are strong enough now to start

This kind of competition will cost giants, but will popup pops.


Baidu just spent 1.9 billion for app firm. Best to keep an eye on YY, for it might well be a merging target with such an
ideal size.


09 Aug 2013, 10:28 AM

That is not likely happened to YY if you know the CEO and chairman of YY more. These two are ambitious
men who favor Jobs and Musk. 
Chairman Lei Jun has a long famous experience in chinese TMT industry. He owns famous XIAOMI
intelligence mobile too.  
CEO Li, whose enterprinuer history already proved what he said wanna be a leading player like BAT and
grow up as an independent company. He will not compromise till YY fully mature. 
CFO eric, he is just a paid employee with short history in YY, not a top decision maker, please leave him
alone. CFO in China company is not as important as in American company, most of situation, CFO is just a
bookkeeper of boss.


0.5 billion registered users, just a number. 
over 80 million active users monthly, this matters. 
over half a million paid users and have a growth more than 50%, this is real cash.


QQ users can buy those "stupid" virtual images and gifts and coins, why not YY can't? 
So many young guys pay billions to buy virtual things in online games, why YY users buy gifts for their favor
girls strange to author?


YY just launched a product like QQzone to reinforce the social network attribute, although it is not the cash
point right now. 
If you really looked into YY, you will know what you hold, too many imagination space on YY.

read that 100,000 units of latest model cell from YY founder, Red Rice, were all sold today in 5 minutes. His
earlier model is already one of the top popular brands in China. This Red Rice could further fuel YY
community.


12 Aug 2013, 10:12 AM

right.  
little rice cell for the middle-low end users, red rice cell for the low end users, good substitution of iphone. 
the recently pull back of YY is just technical adjustment, in my view.  
fundamental of YY doesn't change.


the purpose of YY chairman creating such a cell is to grasp the entrance of mobile traffic, to control the
platform of cell and pre-install software market. this is why major players of chinese internet like BAT3 all have
tried to make a cell of their own. So far, little rice is the most popular, the amount of others are miserable.


one day, little rice will pre-install IM on it, it surely will be YY, not QQ or webchat. everybody know this strategy
years ago when these internet giants started to make their own cells.


12 Aug 2013, 12:47 PM


raining2009
"the recently pull back of YY is just technical adjustment". It is actually high-tight flag if the stock price can
stay above 40. High-tight flag is THE strongest technical pattern of all. The average price rise after high-tight
flag is 60% from historical statistics of all NASDAQ stocks. 
Expect it to rise at least 60% if it stays above $40. Of course in the long term, the stock have potential to rise
multiple times.

Original: 
http://xueqiu.com/S/YY


About Revenue and Tuo 
Bao brother also play the game, and this point you can be found through the Baidu search for the answer to their in-
game spend no less than in the YY. Do our company can jointly Giant, Jinshan, Tencent and other game companies
do “Tuo” jointly? Or are we more than silly to send the Tuo to play game burning other tens of millions?


About Inflated users


Of course there are the following causes: 
1, YY is a requirement for popularity (mainly channel assessment), so a user with two or five accounts is normal, we
generally look at the internal monthly active users, will not see how many registered account.


2, YY is a very suitable platform for the promotion, in order to take over before I had a long time to do promotion,
Baidu account I am at least tens of thousands, not to mention the weiBo, with the third-party development tools we
can effectively to bring their own very large number of users. And YY happens is a very suitable platform for the
promotion, a lot of people in the YY to do promotion, so these people to create a very large number of registrations,
but also gives us a lot of trouble, I have some work is against it.


3 because YY some virtual goods (such as flowers and pass) the interests of the chain and cause waste generated
accounts, this part of our crackdown is the biggest! Most of the so-called almost extinct now available plug, YY is the
senior user should have to understand.

Thanks for posting this insightful article on YY. I bought some today because I liked the technical action over the past
few days and I also like its financials.


I don't speak or read Chinese and didn't really understand the company until I read your article, in a nut shell it sells
soft porn, which is a category though very profitable I don't normally invest in for ethical reasons. So I will likely sell
my position.


From the point of view of the numbers, unless their is hard core fraud (excuse the pun) the investment case is
compelling (unlike Facebook fatigue, people seldom get tired of titillation). And the numbers seem quite compelling.


It has also posted positive and growing free cash flow in all of the past 3 quarters and 5 of the last six quarters. Cash
in the bank has also grown faster than liabilities over the past 3 quarters. (you really need some serious cooking and
off balance sheet vehicles to pull this off)


YY has a trailing 12 month PE of 50 and a future (estimated) PE of 25. Given that it has grown EPS by more than
100% in recent quarters this seems quite reasonably priced.


Growth speaks for itself on both the top line and the bottom line (+100% in the most recent quarter).


Though I see the company in a poorer light, I am not convinced by the short thesis.

Xuhua Zhou - I absolutely agree with your work and have looked at the business on the short side.


Can any of you explain this company's maturities from short term investments on the cashflow from investing line -
the returns appear implausible (~+50% every year) in 2012 the company invested 1bln RMB in ST deposits. Also how

do you believe the company is accounting for this income on its financials. I find no way that this income is being
properly recorded? let me know your thoughts

Idiotic post. Who thinks marketing spend has to be a certain percent of revenues. How much did snapchat spend on
marketing .. Is the offer 4B from google/facebook for snapchat a fraud too?

YY was up 10% today on large volume. Can anyone provide some insight? Is this a good level to add to short??

Good article, how do you know Lei Jun has sold over 500 thousand shares on behalf of his firm at $27? Do you know
how much he earned? As a VC, it may be normal to unload part of his investment at a reasonable price. Lei Jun
invested in 10% of YY for only RMB1m (around $164K). If he sold 500K at $27, he will get $13.5m! That is an
excellent investment!

Are you still alive in the market? Or already died by some short trade?

This company has been reporting superb earnings. Where is the author of this article hiding now?

the guy probably covered and long gone - or went long! 
why stand in front of a company having same number of users as WhatsApp and spend more time on the
platform (stickiness) and unlike WhatsApp - a hugely profitable company. 
If WhatsApp is $19B, what should be the value of YY platform?

Agreed. Bold move on his part to post the article. Bad idea during a bull market where China is running wild. Good
luck next time.

Is the author still short? is the person still alive financially? just wondering if he had posted recently .. hope he was not
ruined completely (financially) due to misguided short position.
