Synageva Heading For Big Disappointment
Apr. 22, 2014 10:00 AM ET24 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Investors and analysts have overestimated the market size for SBC-102 by at least
3-9x.


Most sufferers of CESD can be treated by proper diet and common statins (i.e.
Lipitor) without the need for a $300,000 drug.


Management has now sold 95% of its stock, reducing combined holdings to less
than 1% of outstanding – even before their drug has completed trials.


Similar to Raptor and Aegerion, Synageva will likely drop by at least 50% from
current levels.


[Note: just prior to publication of this post, an article appeared in the European
Atherosclerosis journal entitled "Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency - an under-recognized
cause of dyslipidaemia and liver dysfunction". The article contains references to many of
the studies and issues which I have referred to below. That article was supported and
funded by Synageva and Synageva researchers and is available for purchase via

Company overview


Synageva BioPharma (NASDAQ:GEVA) is a $2.6 billion biotech which specializes in
developing drugs for very rare diseases. The company came public via a reverse merger
in 2011 with failed biotech Trimeris. At the time of the reverse merger, legacy company
Trimeris was held 36% by the Baker Brothers. Recent purchases by the Bakers have
served to maintain (but not increase) this stake in the venture. Following five large equity
offerings raising over $600 million from stock sales, the Bakers continue to currently hold
just 35% of the renamed company, Synageva. The Bakers have made it their practice to
buy into each of these equity offerings, typically in proportion to their ownership stake.


Synageva currently trades at around $75 per share and has a current cash balance of
around $600 million (equivalent to around just $18 per share in cash). The company
expects to lose $190-205 million in 2014. The company lost $95 million in 2013.

Short interest in the stock has gradually declined over the past few months, and now sits
at just 4% of shares outstanding.


In 2013, Synageva derived $13 million in total revenues from royalties on AIDS drug
FUZEON along with additional collaboration revenues. But both of these revenue sources
are declining and neither is material to the $2.6 billion valuation at present. Synageva has
no other sources of revenue at present.


Synageva currently has several preclinical programs which it hopes to advance going
forward. But for the time being, it has only 1 compound in clinical trials, sebelipase alfa
(SBC-102). This is the compound which we will focus on.


During March, Synageva quickly dropped by around 30%. This was largely due to three
factors. First, an unexpected (and unnecessary) $200 million equity offering put heavy
pressure on the share price. Second was the news that the company expected it would
lose around $200 million this year, which was far larger than expected. And third, it was
largely the result of concerns regarding pricing developments at Gilead Sciences
(NASDAQ:GILD) which could affect the broader space of rare / orphan drug developers.
Gilead has seen heavy backlash over the perception that prices for its new Hep C drug

are simply far too high. The company is now taking steps to address these concerns
including providing deeply discounted drugs to certain markets such as Egypt. But this
discounting precedent caused Gilead and other drug developers such as Alexion
(NASDAQ:ALXN) to see similar plunges. These developments are not the primary focus
of this article but are still highly relevant to the prospects for Synageva and others. I have
included details in Appendix I.


Investment thesis


Synageva's SBC-102 is highly likely to be approved by late 2014. FDA approval is likely
not a concern or a problem.


Yet management has been rushing to sell nearly all of its holdings in Synageva.
Management has now unloaded over $50 million in stock, representing more than 95% of
its holdings. This has occurred even before its drug completes clinical trials.


CEO Sanj Patel alone has now sold nearly $37 million in stock…and holds less than
$100,000 remaining. In April, Chief Medical Officer Anthony Quinn sold more than half of
his remaining stock valued $1.7 million.


Meanwhile, the company was also quick to issue new shares in March, raising an extra
$200 million that it did not even need. Synageva already had over $400 million in cash on
its books.


Although the cash balance is still only $18 per share, this opportunistic offering resulted in
Synageva raising far more cash than it needs, simply due to the desire to cash in on a
high share price.


It is very easy to see why management has been so quick to sell.


The problems for Synageva are as follows:


1. The market for SBC-102 is in reality much smaller than has been predicted (as shown
below, analysts have overestimated the market size by 3-9x)


2. Most of those who suffer from CESD have such mild symptoms that they do not
require a $300,000 drug (depending on the severity, diet and simple statins like Lipitor
will often suffice)


3. For those with serious symptoms, other more permanent solutions are becoming
available via bone marrow and stem cell transplants.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 4/29


We have seen this exact same phenomenon with other rare / orphan drug developers.
There is an initial surge when a company looks set to sell its drug at orphan prices of
$100,000-500,000 per patient. The share price surges by hundreds of percent in
anticipation of the company becoming "the next Alexion." But when the market better
understands the limited size of actual market, the stock quickly gives up its gains, plunging
by at least 50%. Near identical examples are shown with Aegerion (AEGR) and Raptor
(NASDAQ:RPTP), each of which plunged by 50% or more after their sharp run ups failed.


LAL D / Wolman Disease / CESD


SBC-102 is currently in clinical trials for treatment of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency
("LAL D"). There are two variations of this genetic ailment, one is when it is early-onset (in
infancy), while the other is late-onset (typically childhood to young adult).


When LAL D manifests itself in infancy (i.e. "early-onset"), there is typically a complete
absence of the LAL enzyme leading to harmful amounts of lipids accumulating in the
spleen, liver, bone marrow, small intestine, adrenal glands and lymph nodes. Symptoms
which follow include enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), poor weight gain,
low muscle tone, a yellow tint to the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), vomiting,
diarrhea, developmental delay, low amounts of iron in the blood (anemia), and poor
absorption of nutrients from food. This nearly always results in fatality, typically before
age one. When describing early-onset LAL D in infants, it is known as Wolman Disease
("WD"). There is currently no approved treatment on the market for WD.


When LAL D manifests itself later in life, there are a wider variety of outcomes and
severities to the deficiency. Unlike early-onset WD, the enzyme is present, but it is present
in a malfunctioned form. In this latter case, it is known as Cholesteryl Ester Storage
Disease (CESD). More information on the wider variety of outcomes due to CESD is
provided below.


What is driving the $2.6 billion valuation of Synageva ?


Both manifestations of LAL D (i.e. both early-onset WD and late-onset CESD) can be
considered ultra-rare afflictions. But only with WD is it ultra severe (life threatening) in all
cases. SBC-102 has been granted orphan drug designation in the US and in Europe, and
has been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA.


Terms like "ultra rare," "orphan drug" and "fast track" often result in premium valuations for
the drug companies who can attain them. What these terms mean are that a drug is likely
to come to market more easily, more quickly and at a tremendously higher price than for

normal drugs.


For example, Alexion currently trades with a market cap of nearly $30 billion even though
it markets only a single product sold to a few thousand patients. That product is Soliris, for
treatment of several ultra rare immune disorders. The cost for Soliris: over $500,000 per
patient.


In 2013, Alexion brought in over $1.5 billion in revenue, implying a total patient count of
around 3,000 (perhaps slightly more, assuming some discounting in price takes place).
Beyond just revenues, Alexion has also been highly profitable with this one drug. Even
after R&D and selling expenses, Alexion was able to achieve operating margins will in
excess of 25%. In 2013, net income was $252 million, putting Alexion on a PE of over
100x.


If Synageva held any such bullish prospects, then it would certainly be very difficult
to reconcile this with the wholesale liquidation of stock which has gone on by the
key members of management.


As shown in the table below, Synageva management members have been extremely
quick to sell nearly all of their shares. They have done this almost as quickly as
they get them via option grants.

A list of all of the recent share sales by management has been included as Appendix II. As
part of this, it can be seen the CEO Patel continued to sell nearly $10 million in stock this
year. He now holds just $77,000 in stock. In April, the CMO sold more than half of his
remaining stock. This follows sales of nearly all stock by other key members of
management.


The purpose of the analysis that follows is to explain WHY management has expressed
such urgency in selling nearly all of their shares of Synageva as quickly as possible.


Will SBC-102 be approved for WD and CESD ?


The answer is an almost certain "yes." Even the bears on Synageva should agree that
SBC-102 will be approved by the FDA without issue.


The real issue for investors is that there are three major commercial problems facing
SBC-102, which explains management's heavy share sales.


Problem #1: the total addressable patient population has been dramatically
overestimated.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/4/21/4238561-1398113405611673-Richard-Pearson_origin.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 7/29


To evaluate this problem, we need to look at the two afflictions (WD and CESD)
separately.


There is little debate about the fact that (early-onset) WD in infants is an ultra rare
affliction. In fact, it would more aptly be described as ultra-ultra-ultra-ultra-rare.


According to the NIH, WD is expected to occur in just one out of every 350,000 live births.
That means just 8-10 cases per year in the US.


The numbers for WD are so small and are tied to new births such that that even if SBC-
102 were to replace Soliris as the world's most expensive drug, the total revenue it might
realize would still not even justify the cost of the clinical trials and R&D.


So then WD is not where Synageva's ambitions have been stated for commercial
purposes. Instead, it is the hopes for treatment of (late-onset) CESD that have propelled
the stock higher.


In attempting to size this market, the primary study being cited by Synageva management
and analysts was one conducted in Germany which came to the conclusion that CESD
should have a prevalence in the general population of about 1:40,000. That equates to 25
patients per million, or about 7,500 total affected individuals in the US.


In its corporate presentation, Synageva has cited a wide ranging number from 1:40,000 to
1:300,000 and used multiple studies, blending together the ultra rare WD with the more
common CESD. But it is clear from their estimates that many analysts have focused
heavily on the 1:40,000 number. Morgan Stanley estimates the total patient population at
exactly 7,500 people (exactly in line with 1:40,000). Wedush tones this down a bit and
estimates it at just over 5,000.


What these sources fail to mention is that the German study was NOT a measurement of
the incidence of CEDS in the German population at all. Instead it was a simple
extrapolation of what might be expected in the overall population of Germany based on a
gene mutation model applied to just 2,023 individuals. This is very important.


The findings from this genetic modeling exercise were certainly not a clear cut
measurement. This can be illustrated by the clumsy wording of the conclusion of the study.
It comes to its 1:40,000 (25 per million) number by stating:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 8/29


Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the homozygote carrier frequency can be
estimated to 6 per million. Applying these results to the German general population,
about 91 E8SJM homozygotes aged 18 years or younger would be expected. Under
the assumption that this mutation represents about 50% of all CESD-causing
mutations, the prevalence of CESD (homozygotes or compound heterozygotes)
among German newborns is estimated at 25 per million, or a total of 366 cases
under the age of 18.


After reading that paragraph, most readers likely walk away simply saying "huh ?!?"


The point to this very clumsy conclusion should be obvious. It does not even remotely
resemble a statement that 25 people per million actually HAVE CESD. It is just an
exercise in genetic modeling.


But for marketing purposes of SBC-102, all that mattered was obtaining a hard number
which justified large revenues. In this case, that number was a hard and fast 25 per
million.


Yet many seem to have ignored the very next (and most important) sentence in this
German study, which states:


This estimate is in apparent conflict with the small number of CESD cases reported in
the literature.


The "apparent conflict" and the "small number" of CESD cases should be very obvious.
What it means is that IN REALITY, we don't find anything even remotely near a 25 per
million incidence of CESD.


According to the NIH website in 2007 (the same year as the German study)


Cholesteryl ester storage disease appears to be a rare disorder. About 50 individuals
affected by this condition have been reported worldwide.


Since that time, and with the onset of clinical trials for a specific drug targeting CESD,
there have been efforts by Synageva to increase awareness and reporting such that it
should be expected that this will have increased from just 50 cases over the past 7 years.


Much of the reason for the low reported incidence of CESD is simply due to the fact that
the disorder is "considered a benign indication" in most cases. It can in fact be treated by
simple changes to diet and the uses of fairly simple statins such as Lipitor. As a result, it is



http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cholesteryl-ester-storage-disease
5/22/2018 Synageva Heading For Big Disappointment - Synageva BioPharma Corp. (NASDAQ:GEVA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 9/29


often never even reported as a disease at all. This will be described further as part of
Problem #2.


But it should also be noted that a more recent US study conducted in 2013 evaluated the
incidence of CESD across various racial groups and estimated prevalence at 1:130,000.
In other words, the "apparent conflict" disclosed in the German study and being used by
the research analysts (i.e. bankers) is that these numbers are overstated by 300%.


Some of the bankers do get credit for paying attention to the wide spread in the numbers
presented by management. For example, Nomura points out the oddly large size of the
variation between management's estimate of 1:40,000 and 1:300,000. Nomura then
settled on a number in between at 1:150,000. That is about 7 per million, instead of 25 per
million.


Not surprisingly, this resulted in Nomura placing a target on the stock that is $20 lower
than Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley is clearly estimating a market size that is around
triple that of Nomura.


Goldman Sachs took a similar approach, and an even smaller market size, and ended up
with a $72 share price 12 month target upon initiation.


But moving into the next section, we can see that the real problems are about more than
just debating the numbers. This is where all of these analysts are much further off, and
why their share price targets will ultimately be cut in half from current levels.


Problem #2: unlike WD, many who suffer from CESD face very mild symptoms


With early-onset WD, the implications are categorical. There is a complete absence of the
LAL enzyme. Symptoms are severe and if it is left untreated the individual will not survive.
The entire purpose of having orphan drug status is to incentivize drug companies to
develop treatments for underserved "orphan" areas such as WD.


But again, due to the ultra low incidence of WD, this is not where Synageva's actual
commercial hopes lie. Even at ultra high prices, there are simply not enough cases of WD
each year to generate adequate revenue.


Synageva hopes to commercialize SBC-102 mostly for treatment of the (relatively) more
common late-onset CESD.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 10/29


The problem is that when it is late onset as it is with CESD, the symptoms are not black
and white as they are with WD. In CESD, patients have a mutation to the enzyme (rather
than a complete absence) and therefore still express some amount of enzyme. However, it
has varying degrees of functionality.


According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)


The symptoms and severity of cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) are
highly variable from one individual to another. Some individuals may develop
symptoms during childhood; others may have extremely mild cases that cause few
symptoms. Still other individuals may not have any noticeable symptoms
(asymptomatic) and may go undiagnosed until well into adulthood.


Under the section entitled "treatment," NORD goes on to note that


A hypolipidemic diet and statins are the main therapeutic tools used against
CESD. …The combination of diet and drug administration has led to dramatic
reductions in the levels of lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood
of affected individuals.


It is from observations such as these from NORD that we can see that the severity of a
LAL D diagnosis can vary quite widely from life threatening at one extreme to just heavy
nuisance at the other. It is also safe to say that those in the nuisance category are not
going to be spending over $300,000 on an ultra rare orphan drug. Instead, they will
monitor their diet more carefully and take a statin such as Lipitor.


Obviously, with the most severe cases of CESD such mild treatment would not suffice.


Yet current sell-side analyst estimates are calculated based on the assumption that the
vast majority of all individuals who could be considered to have a CESD diagnosis will
require the $300,000 drug. This is simply wrong.


This is not to say that CESD is without the potential for serious, life threatening
consequences - in SOME cases. NORD goes on to note that:


In most cases, CESD is considered a benign condition, but in some cases significant
complications may eventually develop including fatty liver (liver steatosis), fibrosis and
finally micronodular cirrhosis with liver failure and esophageal varices due to altered

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 11/29


hepatic venous circulation. The vessels swell and sometimes may rupture, causing
potentially life-threatening bleeding. Abnormal enlargement of the adrenal glands
(adrenomegaly) may also occur in few cases.


The point is that for some small portion of the CESD patient universe, there may be a
genuine need for a $300,000 drug. But the size of this paying population is going to be
incredibly small, nowhere near the thousands that analysts have been projecting when
they have forecast hundreds of millions in revenue.


The point is that even within the small population that is affected by CESD, most
individuals have such minimal symptoms that they certainly will not be paying $300,000 or
more for treatment. Many may not even know that it is called CESD. Some individuals that
have it may even be entirely asymptomatic.


But there was also some excitement that Synageva has been able to complete enrollment
in its Phase 3 clinical trial with over 50 patients. Presumably this would ensure that there
is a large universe of patients around the world. Right?


Wrong.


It is very important to note that the Phase III clinical trial "inclusion criteria" are simply that
there exists in the patient a "Deficiency of LAL enzyme activity confirmed by dried blood
spot (NYSEARCA:DBS) testing at screening." What this means is that even patients who
don't have debilitating symptoms (i.e. the "benign" ones) can be accepted into the trial as
long as they simply evidence some sign of LAL deficiency.


As shown above, there are plenty of people who would test positive for CESD without
even having symptoms or without even otherwise knowing that they had the indication.
These people would certainly be accepted into the trial, but would certainly NOT end up
paying $300,000 for the drug.


As a result, the enrollment of the trial is by no means an indication of who might end up
actually paying $300,000 for the drug.


Problem #3, for those with a severe need, there are multiple other serious treatment
options becoming available. These are permanent, one-time options as opposed to
ongoing drug therapy.


As mentioned above, for those with only mild-to-moderate issues with CESD, there are
ways to deal with it which are not burdensome at all. This includes proper diet and the use
of drugs like Lipitor. There are also other alternatives such as cholesterol and triglyceride

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 12/29


medications.


But even when we get to severe, life threatening cases of WD and CESD, there are still
alternatives. These alternatives are very important to consider due to the high price at
which SBC-102 will be sold.


CESD is often diagnosed in adolescence, such that a patient might end up being
treated for as long as 70 years or longer. With an annual price tag of $300,000 or
more, that implies a total cost to treat which could potentially exceed $20 million!
This is certainly an instance where the party paying for reimbursement would want
to be well informed of all realistic alternatives.


As early as 2000, this study noted that "Wolman Disease Successfully Treated by Bone
Marrow Transplant." The focus of this procedure was on an infant with WD who would
have otherwise died. At age 4, following the transplant, the patient was growing and
healthy. This procedure is unlikely to be broadly applicable for WD (i.e. for an infant) itself
because of the risk of death due to the transplant itself. But it must be remembered that
CESD is by definition a late onset of LAL D, such that it will be applicable to older children
and adults who could more easily tolerate a bone marrow transplant.


The issue to keep in mind is that bone marrow transplants have successfully been able to
permanently treat LAL D, which applies to CESD. The alternative for the patient to
consider would be to keep taking a drug that costs $300,000 per year for the rest of his
life. Again, this could even exceed $20 million total depending on the age of the patient
when diagnosed.


A similar treatment success, but this time with stem cells, was also described in this report
entitled "Successful treatment of Wolman disease by unrelated umbilical cord blood
transplantation." Again, the patient treated was an infant, so technically it was treatment
for WD. But the results should apply to both WD and CESD (i.e. both are simply LAL D
with different ages of onset).


The implications are the same. For patients (or their insurers) the decision becomes
whether or not to be treated once and for all via a transplant or to continue paying
$300,000 per year for life and still be dealing with the unresolved health problem.


So now we know why management has sold virtually all of their stock! The real
world incidence of CESD is as much as 70% less than had been described, the
severity of CESD typically does not even merit the $300,000 treatment…and in the
few instances where it does, other more permanent options are becoming available.

With these facts in mind, the heavy selling by management becomes quite
understandable.


Have we seen the same situation with other orphan drug stocks ? Yes.


Orphan drug stocks are now a red hot topic and have been seen as a source of windfall
profits to the biotechs. As a result, we are seeing many of these biotechs overshoot due to
hype and excess enthusiasm simply associated with their orphan status.


We can see repeatedly that orphan drug stocks overshoot on the way up when the market
gets too excited about their potential to sell drugs for $100,000-$500,000 per year. Once
the market better understands the real world potential, the share prices plunge by 50% or
more.


For example, Aegerion Pharmaceuticals launched its orphan drug to much fan fare in
December of 2012. Yet (just like Synageva) there were contradictory indications provided
about the size of the addressable market. These varied by a factor of 10x (ranging from as
few as 300 patients to as many as 3,000 potential patients).


In the interim (while there was still hype and uncertainly), the share price quadrupled
during 2013, from $25 to over $100, as investors accepted the higher patient number as
fact. As the actual performance failed to materialize, analysts were quick to cut their
ratings on the stock (after the fact) and the stock is now down by nearly 60% from those
highs.


For example, as recently as April 1st, Jefferies cut its price target to $80 from $90. The
share price currently sits at around $45.


When the stock was still trading at over $80.00 in November, author Matt Berry had
warned of this outcome using easily obtained and publicly available information. His point
was simple: the real market size for this drug could in no way generate the kind of
revenues to support this $3 billion stock. It was simply a function of market size. As was
easily predicted, earnings were a disappointment, and the stock has since been cut in
half.


As with Synageva, management at Aegerion were very heavy sellers of their own stock. In
the past year, just as the stock was peaking, insiders unloaded over $85 million in their
stock. The stock is now down by around 60% since its peak in October. Given the
advance warnings and management selling, investors should have known better.

Another nearly identical example is Raptor Pharmaceuticals . Raptor was a $7.00 stock
when it obtained FDA approval for Procysbi, but the stock barely budged until it received
orphan designation in the US and Europe. These designations, along with ample analyst
upgrades, sent the stock to as high as $17.00. When the sales failed to meet expectations
due to a smaller than forecast market size, the shares quickly plunged to their current
level of around $7.00.


As with Aegerion, investors had ample warning in advance from Gravity Research which
predicted the plunge based on overhyped forecasts of the tiny market size for Procysbi.
Just like Matt Berry's analysis on Aegerion, the analysis simply used easily obtainable
public information to demonstrate a far smaller market for Procysbi than had been billed.
The ultimate outcome was a decline in the stock of 55%. This should have been entirely
predictable.


Also like Aegerion (and also like Synageva) management at Raptor has been heavy
sellers since the stock peaked out. In the past few months, insiders have sold nearly $7
million and there have been no insider buys.

As with these other orphan drug examples above, investors should have known better.


This dismal performance is all the more notable given the unanimous bullishness given
across the board by the sell side analysts. Gravity had included the following table
highlighting the research calls expressed on Raptor.

In each of these cases, the information so easily obtained by these independent authors
was somehow entirely overlooked by multiple investment banks who happened to be
raising money for the companies. This analyst optimism is identical to what we see at
Synageva, and we see it even by a number of the same investment banks.


With Raptor, the stock did briefly touch the high share price targets, but only before it fell
by 50% to current levels where it now sits. Likewise, the share price targets on Synageva
did serve to temporarily lift the stock to those levels before the current decline which we
are now seeing.


As these miscalculations become apparent once again, we are also likely to see a
decline of at least 50-70% in the share price of Synageva from current levels down
to around $30-40. This level of decline would simply see the stock trading back
where it was 1 year ago.


Management has no doubt been thrilled with the bullish support from Wall Street analysts,
as it has allowed them to sell more than 95% of their shares, much of it in the past few
months. These same investment bankers then reaped millions in fees from an equity sale
by Synageva in March which raised over $200 million in proceeds.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 17/29


But what about the big institutional buying by the Baker Brothers?


Much of the confidence in Synageva stems from the continued buying by the Baker
Brothers. In the March equity offering by Synageva, the Baker Brothers purchased
375,000 shares at a price of $105.80. So clearly they were looking to increases their
holdings substantially, regardless of price, right? Wrong.


The Baker Brothers strategy with Synageva has simply been to maintain their original
ownership position and avoid dilution. Prior to the reverse merger with Trimeris in 2011,
the Baker Brothers owned 36.2% of the company. And now 3 years later, following a
continued stream of purchases at every equity offering, they now own 34.89% - i.e. almost
unchanged. All they have done is maintain their percentage stake in the company which
they have owned for years.


This is almost identical to the strategy that we have seen with Dr. Philip Frost in his
ongoing purchases of Opko Health (NYSEMKT:OPK). Dr. Frost continues to buy shares of
Opko on a weekly (or even daily) basis, seemingly regardless of price. But what many
investors fail to realize is that his ownership position has remained largely unchanged.
Unlike, Synageva, Opko has largely refrained from issuing shares for cash and instead
has been issuing shares as consideration for a string of acquisitions. In this way, Opko is
increasing its number of "shots on goal."


Were it not for his open market purchases, Dr. Frost would see his ownership stake in the
company fall dramatically due to the for-stock acquisitions. But this is far different than the
idea that he is conducting a "creeping takeover" (which view has been proposed
incessantly by various small investors).


As with Dr. Frost and Opko, the Baker Brothers have an in-price which is at least 60-70%
below current levels and a position size which is already large. The implications are
twofold: First, incremental purchases vs. the large existing position do not really raise the
in-price by very much. Second, with the in-price so low, it becomes nearly impossible to
end up losing money on this position unless the stock falls by more than 70%.


With both the Bakers and Dr. Frost, their objectives and constraints are far different for the
rest of us, such that they can feel free to continue to buy shares at much higher prices
without an impact on their performance. The rest of us cannot say the same.


Author Stock Matusow ran two articles in December highlighting what appeared to be
some very attractive trades put on by the Bakers. The premise was that by "following the
smart money" we could also make money for ourselves.

The following table shows the results of the investments highlighted in these two articles:


As we can see, simply following the smart money" and buying these Baker stocks would
have led to average declines of 24% YTD and 43% declines vs. their recent highs.


The point is not to suggest that the Bakers are bad investors. Nor is it to suggest that they
have simply ridden up a multi-year bubble in biotech stock prices. The only point to make
is that the Baker Brothers have their own sets of opportunities and constraints which are
not applicable to the vast majority of outside investors. Playing follow the leader is the
wrong way to invest in biotech stocks. The right way to invest is to evaluate all facts and
data and then decide where the most profitable investments will be relative to today's
prices.


Conclusion


As it applies to Synageva, the point should be clear. Common sense is showing us that
there are likely to be just dozens or perhaps (at most) hundreds of applicable patients for
SBC-102 at prices of $300,000 or more. This is far less than the thousands of patients
which would be necessary to justify the current market cap of over $2 billion.

In addition, we can see that many of the potential patients may have symptoms which are
so mild that they do not require the high priced drug. For those with severe symptoms,
there are already alternative therapies (transplants) which may represent permanent cures
rather than ongoing expensive treatments.


Meanwhile, management continues to sell its shares as fast as it can, mostly refusing to
retain anything more than token holdings of the stock. So far management members have
cashed out of more than $50 million in stock in the past three years. CEO Sanj Patel has
personally sold nearly $37 million in stock and currently holds a mere 1,031 shares
remaining - almost nothing.


Realistically, we should expect to see Synageva decline by around 50-70% from current
levels.


Appendix I - Developments at Gilead and impact on drug pricing


In December the FDA approved Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, used to treat hepatitis C. The
drug is fantastic. It is the closest thing we have to an outright cure.


It was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and is effective on 90% of
patients in as little as 12 weeks, only involving daily pills.


However, Gilead's exorbitant pricing of the drug for $1,000 per day or $84,000 for 12
weeks of treatment has caused unbridled backlash from many stakeholders. "Never
before has a drug been priced this high to treat a patient population this large, and the
resulting costs will be unsustainable for our country," said Express Scripts chief medical
officer Steve Miller. Specialty drugs comprise less than 1% of all US prescriptions but
account for ~28% of total spending on pharmaceuticals. Sovaldi is not the most expensive
drug in the world, but costlier drugs typically treat extremely rare conditions whereas 130-
150M people suffer from hepatitis C globally, 3.2M in the US.


Involved parties are not just idly complaining either. In its first guidelines on treatment of
hepatitis C issued in early April, the World Health Organization suggested tiered price
discounts by branded drug makers, voluntary licensing, and even compulsory licensing to
combat unbearable prices. Express Scripts plans to create a coalition of employers,
government health plans, and private insurers and is also working with doctors to delay
treatment on many patients until lower-priced alternatives are on the market, probably in
2015. Representative Henry Waxman sent a public letter in late March: "Our concern is
that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it." Last month, US lawmakers
asked Gilead to explain the $84,000 price tag.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2153203-synageva-heading-for-big-disappointment 20/29


With so many pricey drugs on the market, it is curious that this was the drug that finally
sparked such an massive outcry about drug pricing. It is particularly notable given that this
is for a drug which is extremely effective at treating a very serious problem.


On Friday March 21st (just after the close of stock markets), Gilead announced that it
would be offering the drug to Egypt at discounts of 99% vs. the $84,000 cost.


On Monday March 24th (in reaction to the Friday announcement), shares of Gilead
dropped by as much as 6%. Other orphan drug makers such as Alexion and Synageva
dropped by 7-10% as well. The message was clear that companies may no longer be free
to simply set pricing at the highest level the market will bear. There can be qualitative
consequences to even the perception that a company is charging too much for a drug -
even when it is an effective drug for a much needed indication.


Appendix II - Stock sales by GEVA management


During 2014, 2014, Synageva insiders have sold nearly $13 million in stock, including over
$9 million from CEO Sanj Patel alone. This brings total management sales to more than
$50 million. Management has now sold over 95% of its shares. As a result of the recent
selling, management now owns less than 1% of the total share count.

Hello, nice article.


Just one point, you said a lot of insiders are selling shares.  
I am ok, but Baker brothers who are estimated in the bio sector have bought a lot of shares bellow and above the
actual price and have sold anything.

Several flaws in this piece:


1. We have studied hundreds of biotechs over the past 20 years. There is absolutely zero correlation between insider
selling and subsequent share price performance. There is a positive correlation between insider buying and
subsequent share price performance (almost always with what I will call "busted" biotechs).

2. Baker Bros hold 2 of the 8 seats on BOD, including Felix Baker himself. Which means there has really been net
insider BUYING, not selling. You failed to mention this as far as I can tell.


3. Your assertion that the Bakers are buying into secondary offerings only to maintain their ownership stake at fixed
levels is ludicrous. The Bakers do not throw their clients' money around unless they believe they are going to deliver
an excellent return within a reasonable period of time. As such, there are countless other biotechs they could have
invested in with that most recent buy of $40M. That they chose GEVA @ $105 speaks volumes.


Your article is several weeks late. Where was it when the SP hit $119?


For the record, we bot GEVA at $38+, sold some @ $79, $97, and $107, then bought back @ $81 what we sold @
$97 and $107.


Cheers!

RPTP was overvalued at $17 with current earnings. All said and done, if earnings are as expected for their drugs, it
should easily be a $13 stock. We will find out May 5.

2.5 billion market capitalization without any products approved (just based on terms like orphan, breakthrough, fast

Great insight into Baker brothers "just maintaining the 35% holding". The CEO sold 35 million worth of shares and
holds just 1035 shares?? Man..very huge red flag.

If you worked there and brought any of this up regarding the incidence of the disease Sanj would have fired you the
next day. Very, very solid article from the medical perspective and regarding the obscene dilution of shares. The
environment inside GEVA is a nightmare, with employees afraid to bring up problems as the CEO arrogantly stomps
the halls threatening to fire anyone who dares to question these numbers and sources, after all it's making him rich.
This company will tank, due to the CEO, but he's pulled out his millions already...

What is the source of this information? And has the CEO threatened to fire any analysts? The PT targets on
this stock are not too shabby (of course, probably because the analysts did not care to ask Mr Pearson).

The insider holding information is bogus. Below is the (correct) info from finviz.com. You will see that Mr Patel holds
52K shares, with a market valuation of roughly $4.5MM at today's prices. The R&D Head holds around $3MM worth.
The Bakers apparently think little enough of the company to hold over $1.5BN of stock.


However, we should all thank Mr Pearson, since the stock is up over 8% since this attack piece was published.

acquisition upon approval of trial . End of story. That is simple . BB knows the figure and its just north of last offering .
Not to much higher. At today's price good action.

there's one way that Synageva can transcend all this negativity and that is to find a way to ferry their products across
the blood brain barrier (bbb) so that they can treat the condition in the CNS. if they're hoping for a compromised bbb
to rely on leakage from the bloodstream to the target areas of they brain they're not going to be able to reach their
goals.  
crossing the bbb would mean that $83 for their equity could be considered a steal.

As an investor in biOasis Technologies (TSXV:BTI), for several months I have maintained a passing interest in
Synageva and have written about the company elsewhere. One reason for my interest is that the LSD space seems
to be wide open to anybody who can find a vector to transport the required enzymes across the Blood Brain Barrier

5/22/2018 Synageva Heading For Big Disappointment - Synageva BioPharma Corp. (NASDAQ:GEVA) | Seeking Alpha

(BBB). BiOasis has a means of doing this and has made two announcements about patent allowances for their
Transcend vector for LSD treatments. (BiOasis also has collaboration programs with MedImmune, Shire, UCB and
Abbvie.)


My real interest was in the value placed on GEVA by investors. I thought it was exciting but problematic. The inferred
value of LAL treatment was way high given that Synageva cannot really place a high value on SBC-103 because they
have no apparent means of transporting the drug across the BBB. SBC-103 is a drug for the treatment of the LSD,
MPS IIIB, or Sanfilippo B syndrome.


So I was astonished to watch the market place such a low value of $40 million on biOasis, who can transport
biologics, enzymes, gene therapies and small molecules across the BBB, all with a very small peptide (<2kDa) p97
vector, and yet watch the market place values of $2 billion to $3 billion and more on a company that can't increase its
potential commercial value without such a vector.


It's like Synageva has the question and biOasis has the answer but Synageva gets all the value and biOasis none. I
understand the dynamics of getting stories out there and having to wait for market awareness to take root, so I'm not
complaining.


But like all biOasis shareholders, I'm waiting for the market to show a similar exuberance for biOasis that it has shown
for Synageva. Such exuberance for biOasis, I think, could happen with more justification. BiOasis could be a licensing
monster for the transport across the BBB of drugs treating brain tumours (already successful in mice), anti-TNF drugs
treating pain, drugs for metabolic disorders and a host of other drugs for CNS diseases, syndromes and disorders.


Although our calculations show that LSD drug conjugate licenses with the Synagevas of the world would be a
comparatively small part of biOasis's licensing potential, we nevertheless consider it to be rather low-hanging fruit for
biOasis, something that could be used to help investors determine a real valuation for biOasis. Also, LSD therapies
should be strong candidates for early FDA approval based on their compassionate approval policies. Time will tell.
Other than on various stock forums we've never seen Synageva mentioned as a potential partner for biOasis, but it
could make sense.


One thing for sure, the biOasis insiders do have skin in the game, something very comforting compared to the
situation with Synageva. This was a very compelling piece you wrote, Mr. Pearson.

Small Pharma Analyst, Contributor
Excellent article. Very well researched and good insights.


This drug reminds me almost exactly of the Isis drug KYNAMRO for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The
CEO Crooke was touting this drug as the next $1 billion seller in the orphan disease arena. However, if you look at the
latest earnings report and conference call, there is not a single mention of this drug. Why? In an article last August,
Barron's suggested TOTAL prescriptions written for the drug were in the 30-40 range. In other words, Isis does not
provide revenue numbers because they are exceedingly small. SBC-102 has a good chance of going down the same
pathway.


Again, thanks for your article - this is why Seeking Alpha is so valuable.

HOW MUCH is your net WORTH??? If it was all this simple you should be worth billions and probably not even a
million or did you even earn it.

Short $ALXN @171,25$. Pays $230 per share for GEVA. Premium 140% vs. closing price of GEVA yesterday 85,87$.
Biotech-Bubble written allover it.

25% of float is short. Ouch!

If I were short GEVA (luckily I´m not) I would just stay short and wait and after the deal gets through, stay short in
ALXN. They are desparate to buy growth and seem to be ready to pay insanely high prices.
