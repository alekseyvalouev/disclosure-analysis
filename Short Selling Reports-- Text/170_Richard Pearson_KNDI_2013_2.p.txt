How U.S. Investors Got Punk'd By Kandi

(Editors' Note: This article mentions micro-cap stocks. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


When I last wrote about Kandi Technologies (NASDAQ:KNDI), the stock had been sitting
at roughly 50% above where it is currently. The stock has now fallen from the $7-8 range
down to the $4-5 range due to subsequent events. During this time, shares of Tesla
Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) have continued to hit new highs, recently breaking above $125.
As I have stated before, Tesla and Kandi have virtually nothing in common, so this
divergence should not have come as a surprise. Yet it had previously been the case that
numerous articles had suggested that there should be a direct correlation between Kandi
and Tesla share prices.


The purpose of this article is not to say "I told you so." Instead it is to encourage investors
to further reevaluate the "facts" upon which they have been relying regarding Kandi.


My last article was long, but the key points can be summarized as follows:


1. Kandi had $25 million in debt coming due during the week of June 24th -- but lacked
the money to pay these debts


2. In anticipation, Kandi filed an S3 registration statement in April -- but the stock lacked
both the price and the volume to sell enough stock


3. Just two days after the S3 was filed, a highly organized promotion campaign was
begun in order to lift the price and volume


4. The promotion consisted of the following:


1. Aggressive articles predicting a meteoric rise in the stock
2. Press placements of headlines with sites such as Motley Fool and CNN Money
3. Press releases by Kandi touting minor non-events
4. All of a, b and c were synced with a coordinated buying campaign, temporarily


increasing both the price and volume of Kandi stock


This plan worked quite well. Kandi's stock more than doubled. Volume increased by as
much as 400-fold.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 2/52


As predicted, within 3 days of my article, Kandi issued $26 million in stock. The amount
coincided precisely with what was needed by Kandi for debts. The date coincided perfectly
with the timing of these debts. Despite these coincidences, Kandi has stated that the
proceeds of this financing will only be used for "general corporate purposes."


Just two days prior to announcing the financing, Kandi put out a press release in response
to my article. It basically told investors the following:


- Kandi's debts had been paid


- Kandi didn't need to raise money


- Kandi had not been selling stock under the S3


For those who were still on the fence, Kandi included a punchy last paragraph to their
press release to remove all doubt that it was safe to continue buying Kandi. Kandi stated
that:


"The Company filed a similar shelf S-3 registration statement with the SEC on
November 19, 2009 which became effective December 24, 2009. Almost one year
after that S-3 registration statement became effective, on December 21, 2010, the
Company raised approximately $16 million with a shelf take down."


This reassurance clearly worked well. Apparently Kandi didn't need any money and was
unlikely to be selling stock for up to a year. The stock quickly rose back to $7.18 that
Tuesday. However, on Wednesday, Kandi announced that it had already sold over $26
million in stock at $6.03 plus millions of shares in warrants. The stock quickly fell to $6.03
and then continued its descent back into the $4-5 range.


US retail investors who fell for this ruse are now likely feeling "punk'd." There were several
months of promotion leading up to this moment. But the last minute reassuring press
release from Kandi was clearly the crescendo.


We can see from the disclosed engagement letter that FT Global had already been signed
up as a "placement agent" on the fundraising, a full week before the reassuring press
release was issued by Kandi. FT Global was appointed on June 18th.


But some investors continue to search for excuses on how this farce is actually great
news for Kandi.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 3/52


The truth of the matter is that the "institutional" investors received so many warrants in the
offering that their real effective purchase price is just $4.37. This was a no brainer trade for
any institution when the stock was sitting at $6.50. Even when selling at $5.00 (or below),
these investors will pocket millions with minimal risk.


If I had been given the opportunity to buy a $6.50 stock for $4.37, I would have
participated in the deal and happily made a few million dollars in risk free profits as well. I
would have gladly done so even though I am extremely bearish on Kandi's business
prospects, because it was a "free money" trade.


This was an easy arbitrage, not an investment in Kandi.


By giving out free warrants, the company is subsidizing the purchase of the stock. As
shown below, the warrants are worth around $7 million. These investors were therefore
paying $26.3 million, but receiving $7 million in warrants back immediately. Their net cost
on the stock is around $19 million. Therefore, the actual amount that they are paying for
each share is just $4.37.


As an investment banker, I spent years demonstrating similar economics to CEOs of multi-
billion dollar public companies. The full calculations are demonstrated in Appendix I, along
with the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes model. They are all consistent with
prices demonstrated by Kandi's current options trading.


For some reason, some small retail investors seem to think that several "institutions" are
making a bullish bet on Kandi at $6.03. They also think that these warrants at $7.24 imply
that Kandi is expected to actually rise to that level.


Neither is the case. Instead, this was a predatory financing.


The negative impact on other shareholders has already begun to demonstrate itself. And if
history is any guide, Kandi will fall much further.


The fund that participated in the deal was a Cayman Islands based fund called Capital
Ventures. Their "investment manager" is Heights Capital Management of San Francisco.
We can see by looking at the past 13Gs filed by this fund that they are a financier of last
resort for companies that are either in distress or are otherwise unable to raise new
funding.


They specialize in engineering highly dilutive deals for "new energy" companies that
appear to be in terminal condition.

Examples of past investments include the following:


- B456 Systems - Formerly A123 Systems (OTC:AONEQ). Last traded for 3 cents with
a market cap of $6 million. Was once a multi-billion dollar battery supplier to EV
manufacturers.


- Tengion (TNGN.OB). An OTC BB company developing "artificial organs." The stock has
traded down 80% to 50 cents. Market cap of $1 million.


- Wireless Ronin (RNIN). A "digital media" company with a 70 cent share price and a $4
million market cap. Stock is down 70% this year.


- Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). A 38 cent "alt energy" stock that is down 70% in the
past year.


- Alamo Energy (OTC:ALME). A pink sheets oil and gas stock with a price of below 1
cent.


The key point to take away from these deals is that Capital is a predatory financier that
profits by getting into extremely cheap deals from companies who are desperate enough
to offer them terms. Capital profits by selling these cheaply acquired stocks on the way
down, not by picking winners who are about to go up. This is what explains the
tremendous warrant coverage and the $4.37 effective purchase price that Kandi gave up
to these investors.


Additional examples are numerous and can be found by viewing the filings.


Capital's only other Chinese investment was in China Medicine Corp. This company
ended up defaulting on its debts and being delisted to the pink sheets. It subsequently
conducted a voluntary withdrawal from the pink sheets and is no longer traded.


With Kandi, Capital made sure that there were enough warrants included in the deal to
ensure that nothing could go wrong for their investment -- even as Kandi plunged.


In fact, there appears to be a built in incentive for the fund to sell Kandi stock sooner
rather than later. In looking at the Form of Warrant document, we can see the following
limitations, which would prevent the holder from exercising his warrant.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 5/52


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, this Warrant shall
not be exercisable by the Holder hereof to the extent (but only to the extent) that the
Holder together with any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99%
(the "Maximum Percentage") of the Common Stock after giving effect to such
exercise.


Capital had already purchased over 5% of the outstanding share count of Kandi
common stock in the offering. Obviously the easy way to ensure that the warrants
can be exercised is for the fund to simply sell all of the stock that it purchased.


The point from this is that this "institution" did not invest in Kandi to take a long-term view
on share price appreciation. They simply received so many shares and warrants from the
trade that they were nearly guaranteed to make a substantial profit, even when selling into
a falling share price.


Investors who have been on this wild ride may now be asking what was the point of
"running the stock" to $8.50 if Kandi would just end up handing shares to investors for
$4.37.


The point is that when the stock was at $3.70 and trading on around 60,000 shares per
day, no equity financing was possible. The share price was too low and the volume was
too light to issue a meaningful number of shares.


Sadly, getting the stock up to $8.50 was the only way for Kandi to get investors to buy in at
a still low share price of $4.37.


Now that Kandi has this money, there remains very little incentive for the company
and its promoters to continue "running the stock." This should be self evident
given the share price declines that have followed the huge equity and warrant
offering.


Even bigger problems for Kandi


There have been many pump articles that caused Kandi to rise dramatically over the past
few weeks. However, it remains the case that the only real "news" that might have an
impact on Kandi's future came solely in the form of two press releases.


On June 5th, Kandi announced the MIIT approval of the Kandi Geely sedan. The share
price quickly doubled, briefly hitting $8.50.

When the share price quickly faded to around $6.00 (a 30% decline), Kandi quickly issued
a second press release on June 17th, which stated that HangZhou had started
construction on a charging facility that would use 5,000-10,000 Kandi cars. Kandi soared
by 30% once again, hitting $8.30.


In both cases, the "news" was released weeks after the developments actually occurred.
Kandi simply selected the optimal time to put out these press releases. The timing worked
well in terms of raising the share price right before the equity offering.


In my last article, I already described how each of these events are (in reality) non-events
for Kandi.


The MIIT approval applies to hundreds of other EV manufacturers and their models. None
of them trumpeted the "news" with a press release. Even Geely's stock did not budge on
the news. Yet Kandi's trumpeting (along with promotional articles) caused the stock to
double (temporarily).


The HangZhou news had been announced a year earlier as 20,000 vehicles. The new
news was actually a decline of as much as 75%. Yet for some reason it still caused the
shares to jump to $8.30 (temporarily).


Neither of these "news events" should have resulted in a significant boost in
Kandi's share price from its then level of around $3.70.


But in fact, the reality of this "news" is actually much worse.


The Geely partnership was originally announced in February, causing Kandi's stock to rise
by 11%. As with the recent developments, the timing of this news also appears to have
been correlated with warrant activity and Kandi's attempts to raise money. Just prior to the
news, Kandi had amended a warrant purchase agreement with two investors. The
warrants on over 300,000 shares were set to expire worthless on January 22nd, so Kandi
voluntarily extended the term of the warrants to March. The intent was to allow warrant
holders to make money while Kandi would end up issuing over 300,000 new shares and
receive proceeds. The warrants had a resettable price to as low as $2.75, but would have
been exercisable ultimately at around $4.00-5.00.


Although much hype has been given to the Geely partnership, it seems that no one has
bothered to read the disclosure that came from Geely.

5/22/2018 How U.S. Investors Got Punk'd By Kandi - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 7/52


The JV Company will be owned as to 50% by Shanghai Maple of the JV Company:
Guorun and as to 50% by Kandi Vehicles.


The JV Company will not become a subsidiary of the Group or Kandi Group and
its financial results will not be consolidated into the financial statements of either
the Group or Kandi Group or their respective subsidiaries.


The fact that the Geely JV Company will not be a Kandi sub and will not even consolidate
the financial results has not been mentioned by Kandi or its promoters. But the financial
implications for Kandi should be painfully obvious to Kandi shareholders.


In addition, this agreement still requires a capital contribution of $80 million by Kandi,
which Kandi clearly does not have.


To be clear, Kandi needs Geely in order to proceed. Geely does not need Kandi. The EV
that received MIIT approval was model number JL7001BEV. The "JL" stands for JiLi (吉
利), which is Geely's name in Chinese. From the attachment on the MIIT website, we can
see that the vehicle is registered to Geely and not to Kandi.


In fact, Kandi's other promising vehicle candidate was also not even a Kandi
vehicle.


Kandi first announced the HangZhou "contract" in October of 2012. The "buyer" was
China Aviation Lithium Battery (CALB, 中航锂电(杭州)有限公司), which is a subsidiary of a
Sichuan Company called "ChengFei" (四川成飞集成科技股份有限公司).


The model number was quoted as JNJ6290EV. But we can once again see from the MIIT
website that this model is actually owned by a different car company called Zotye
(pronounced ZhongTai in Chinese, 众泰汽车). The models, which were to be supplied to
the HangZhou rental project, are in fact ZhongTai models, not Kandi models.


This problem likely stems from the fact that Kandi is not even licensed in China to
make Electric Vehicles for use on roads (i.e., non go carts or ATVs).


We can see from Kandi's filings with China's State Administration for Industry and
Commerce ("SAIC") that Kandi is licensed to make the types of golf carts and go carts that
are not highway legal. In Chinese these are shown on the filing as 电动车、专用车. But
Kandi's license also specifically says (不含汽车), which means "does not include
automobiles." 汽车 is Chinese for street legal automobiles. The filings can be found here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 8/52


This would help to explain why Kandi keeps effectively "renting" the right to make licensed
vehicles from other companies such as Geely and ZhongTai, who are allowed to do so.


From the Kandi announcement regarding CALB and HangZhou, we can see that:


Under the sales contract, the temporarily scheduled deliveries of the 5,000 vehicles
will occur from September 29th to December 31st, 2012.


Yet according to its 10K filing for 2012, Kandi only sold a TOTAL of 3,915 "Super-mini
cars" for the entire year of 2012. All of its other stated sales are for go carts and ATV type
vehicles. It is important to note that the 3,915 total included all cars made before
September 29, along with any and all cars sold pursuant to the "contract" with CALB.


The biggest problem here is that Kandi had stated that


Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. ('Kandi Vehicles') has signed the sales contract
with China Aviation Lithium Battery (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd. ('CALB Hangzhou') to
provide the first 5,000 EVs


But when we look at the actual documents in Chinese (put out by ChengFei, not by Kandi)
, we can see that it is in fact only a "cooperation letter of intent" (合作意向协议, subject to
competitive bidding (中标) and lacks legal binding (不确定性).


This now explains why the sales never materialized. The "contract" was not a
contract.


The two press releases issued in June (along with heavy promotion) caused Kandi's
shares to double. Volume increased by 100-400x. This all occurred just in time for Kandi
to complete a much needed (and very predictable) financing.


But with the Geely approval announcement, any results will not even end up within Kandi's
financials. Shareholders will not benefit.


With the latest HangZhou news, we can see from the past that the "sales contract" was
actually not a contract at all.


Fortunately, Kandi was very quick in cashing in on the share price spike, raising $26
million in new money and allowing new investors to get in with an in price of just $4.37.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 9/52


But now there is a predatory fund, which is likely putting pressure on Kandi's share price.
At the same time, investors are gaining an understanding that the two "news" releases did
not merit a substantial rise in the stock from its then level of around $3.70.


Based on these factors, I strongly expect the share price to return to below $4.00 and
volume to quickly subside to less than 100,000 shares per day once again.


Conclusion


Those who benefit from a rise in Kandi's stock price have been quick and brutal in their
criticism of my findings.


Over the years I have written many cautious articles regarding pumps, promotions and
outright frauds in the US and in China. On many occasions I have received death threats
and threats of lawsuits from those who wanted to see my articles pulled. I have never
agreed to pull any of my articles.


Some of the more problematic companies I have highlighted include China Media Express
(OTCPK:CHMD), China Biotics (OTC:CHBT), Ziopharm Oncology (NASDAQ:ZIOP) and
Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL).


These are just a few notable examples. There are many, many more.


Once the dust settles and people have a chance to get a clearer perspective, I often
receive a small number of thank you notes and an even smaller number of apologies from
my critics.


When I wrote my first article on Kandi, I made it clear that a large financing was imminent.
This was simply what the facts should have led us to conclude. The financing happened
just 3 days later.


I do not simply write my own musings about what I "think." I write about situations where I
can demonstrate adequate basis. I continue to receive new information on Kandi from
readers in China almost every day. I expect to continue sorting out these new findings and
will hopefully provide one or more additional updates in the next few weeks.


Investors in Kandi should strongly consider reviewing all possible findings with a critical
eye to determine the validity of the hyper-bull thesis that caused the stock to double just in
time for the $26 million financing. They should also consider the negative implications of
having just completed a highly dilutive and predatory warrant financing.

Now that Kandi has gotten the money it was after, there is no near-term incentive to hype
the story or promote the stock. As in the past, Kandi's share price will likely fall back to
below $4.00.


Appendix I - calculating the value of the free warrants


In connection with the offering of stock at $6.03 per share, Kandi offered two classes of
warrants. There were 1,750,415 warrants offered with a 30 month maturity and a strike
price of $7.24. There were also 728,936 warrants offered with a 60 day maturity and a
strike price of $7.24.


Investors who wish to independently value these warrants can refer to the current prices
and volatility numbers for Kandi's existing options which are actively traded.

The PRICE MANIPULATOR is at it again!


Shareslueth also just published (an hour ago) a negative KNDI article. What are the odds that you both release
negative articles within an hour of each other?


Sure, seems like a coordinated ambush.


And neither article mentions how strong Kandi's fundamentals are and how well they are positioned in the China EV
market.


Which is just a little ONE sided - don't you think?


Next time - how about writing an articles that at least has a whiff of being fair and balanced?


I wonder if you'll respond head on to the comments that will come - instead of dodging them like you did after your last
unwarranted bashing of Kandi.

Richard, This morning there were two well written comments by Arthur Porcari (another SA author) that were
posted right below my first comment.


Do you have any idea how they got deleted? They certainly seemed factual and enlightening and worthy of
staying as comments.

Just a beginning investor trying to learn, how did the author know that there was 25 mill in debt about to come

Author’s reply »  What part of your comments do you think merits a response ?


I had no idea that sharesleuth was publishing anything today on Kandi.


Maybe you should actually read my articles and evaluate the facts rather than just rejecting anything that disagrees
with your original bull thesis.


Had you listened to me before, you could have sold at over $7.00 instead of in the $4's. Your welcome.


Keep in mind that I was nice enough to offer to speak with you by phone while I was on vacation, but you had no
interest in speaking.

"What part of your comments do you think merits a response ?"


That's what I was just thinking. But I like the phrase, "pack of lies." But Arthur, you use that term a lot. You
should change it up to something like "6-pack of lies," or "suitcase of lies."


It's funny too because you list all of your sources that your comments come from for anyone to see. And you
hit the pump up and drop off perfectly. I like the one where KANDI says it's not going to sell stock to raise
capital and then does it the day after or so. How can that be refuted?


Seriously people, 3.70 to 8:50 and back to 4 bucks all in two months?


I gotta bridge for sale down in Mississippi.

One should seriously question the credibility of this author. But, don't just take my word for it........


Mr. Pearson's last article: 
What The Market Missed On Kandi 
Richard Pearson • Fri, Jun 21 • 115 Comments


Included an Editor's Note from SA: (Editors' Note: The accuracy of some portions of this article have been
disputed.)


Here are two reasons I think this editors note from SA should make investors pause and question the integrity
of this author...... 
1) The "Dispute an article" page of SAs websites states: "Seeking Alpha's editorial approach is to interfere as
little as possible with contributors' articles". 
2) When a search is done within SA's website using this editor's note (The accuracy of some portions of this
article have been disputed). Richard Pearson's prior article on Kandi is at the top of the search list and is the
only article to get that editor's note in the last ten months.


Take a look for yourself - let me know if you get the same results.

dwdallam,


Well - because Arthur's well written posts have been deleted I guess we won't be able to have a meaningful
conversation regarding the well researched challenges that he put forth.


Now, I must admit that Arthur's comments were worded strongly and parts of them could be interpreted as
"personal attacks" on the author - but there are many other unsubstantiated comments made here and
elsewhere that violate the stated rules of commenting on SA articles. Here are the rules on commenting from
SA's "Comment Guidelines" page:


Passionate discussions are always welcome on the site, but we believe that comments should be genuine,
helpful responses and that users should behave with and be able to expect high ethical and intellectual
standards from other commenters. So we will delete comments which we believe detract from civilized

conversation (and repeat offenders will have their posting privileges revoked or their accounts deleted). Such
material includes:


- obscenities or abusive language about another user or the topic under discussion 
- personal attacks on another user or contributor 
- unsubstantiated allegations against an article’s author 
- blanket dismissal of someone else’s ideas 
- comments which mislead other users


Now, I know it would be unreasonable to expect SA to police comments for all violations - but, I've witnessed
many violations of the last two rules:


- blanket dismissal of someone else’s ideas 
- comments which mislead other users


and, I've NEVER seen anything done about those. 
Therefore, the fairness of which posts are deleted and which ones aren't doesn't appear to be very fair or
balanced.


Thoughts?

Seriously, you haven't responded to a lot of criticism related to your article. It would be somewhat excusable if
their were no responses from you ( maybe you've not had the time) but I've noticed that you have replied to
some comments but not others. To me this means your observing the reaction to your article and picking and
choosing whose comments to answer too. The ones you don't answer too must mean that you just don't have
an answer!!!

done very frequently in responses to the article,

your own conclusion.

That's a terrible excuse remmycat.... Most comments adverse to his position are similarly natured. All Richard

Wouldn't that help validate his article and stance?

My investment in Kandi is up 50%. I'm not a professional but I just read an article about China restricting car sales
because of pollution.


10 Jul 2013, 08:35 PM


RockyMtnHiiigh
Yea, I saw it too. Eight major Chinese cities will be reducing the number of ICE cars that can be sold next
year by 20% to 25%.


If no restriction were put in place these cities would have probably had another increase in ICE car sales.


I would think this should only help future EV sales?


btw, cities have also been encouraging people to buy EV's over ICE cars by restricting the days you can drive
based on odd and even license plate numbers, and by making it less expensive to register EV's.


Traffic and parking are also major issues in many Chinese cities. Kandi, with their partners, has smart
solutions for these issues too.


11 Jul 2013, 01:13 AM


DWD Investing, Contributor
Or they could mandate pollution controls on petrol cars.


11 Jul 2013, 02:03 AM


RockyMtnHiiigh
True - but it might take more time for the ICE car manufacturers to put improved pollution controls in place. 
By limiting the number of new sales it improves the pollution problem right away. And, this also puts a lot of
pressure on ICE makers to come up with a models that pollute less.


I can't put my finger on a recent study of China's pollution problem - but, the study said that pollution levels in
China cities is on average about ten times worse than in US cities! 
So - let me ask you - if pollution was ten times worse in US cities than it is right now - would you want our
government to take immediate and decisive action?

"Now that Kandi has gotten the money it was after, there is no near-term incentive to hype the story or promote the
stock."


Don't you have any comment on whether the government EV subsidies (curiously, expected in just a few days), might
affect KNDI? Whatever you feel about the subsidies, I would think they would warrant near-term hype; at least more
so than some of the mentioned PRs.


Also, what's with all this speculation about timed bull articles for the spike? I've been following all KNDI articles for
years, and there certainly wasn't any huge increase in hype that triggered that spike. The best and most convincing
bullish articles were written months or years ago.


There are some factors to consider in your writing, but you have to understand why some readers don't trust you. The
timing of your writings and the lack of discussion of actual company progress and prospects cause people to just say
"hit piece" and wonder about your agenda.

dw-


I think you ask the right question, but I think RP overplays his hand significantly in trying to answer it. Some
sort of media pump seems to have been in operation. And maybe it was orchestrated so that an "institutional
investor" could get in and out in a hurry, leaving the company with as much cash as possible (bad for people
who bought on the hype, not so bad for long-term holders, who benefit from the higher price of the issuance).


But the rest of the case doesn't seem to hold up. RP makes a big deal about the value of the warrants. That
doesn't make any sense to me unless the investor believes that (i) it can turn the warrants into cash, or (ii) the
warrants will some day be exercisable at a profit. Yet RP argues BOTH that the warrants guarantee the
investor a profit AND that the investor is hurrying to sell its shares (which depresses the price) SO THAT it
can later exercise the warrants without violating the 5% ownership ceiling. "Simpson-Bowles" was so named
to avoid an unpleasant set of initials. Let's just say that you can't spend "Black-Scholes" dollars.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 18/52


If KNDI were a big company with readily marketable warrants, the plan could well have been to dump them
ASAP. If that were so, then why worry about exercising them? It makes more sense for the investor to have
shorted the stock massively at 8+ and then to use the newly acquired shares and the warrants at $7.24 to
cover. But wouldn't that have required an aggressive shorting campaign in the middle of the pump? Again,
KNDI's size seems to make that plan problematical. And how would that make the warrants worth
$7,000,000?


Then RP tries to make something of the fact that the Geely JV is not a subsidiary of KNDI for reporting
purposes, so " any results will not even end up within Kandi's financials. Shareholders will not benefit." KNDI
owns half of the JV. If the JV increases in value, half of it belongs to KNDI, however it is accounted for. And if
the JV throws off cash, that's KNDI's cash and profit. How is that not "benefiting" from results?


I know that RP is talking his book, but so are Art and his fellow cheerleaders. Was it Keynes who said the
hardest thing in the world to do is convince a man that something is false when his livelihood depends on its
being true? So I try to take the opinions with a grain of salt. But I would like the logic to be sound, and, in that
regard, this article appears to me to come up, well, short.


11 Jul 2013, 08:07 AM


DWD Investing, Contributor
Lawrence,


Thanks for that clear explanation. I will admit, I'm a rank amateur when it comes to stocks, so I cannot,
without a good amount of research, call into question your explanations. But, at least your explanations are
clear and easy to research, and I appreciate that.


I do not fully understand the warrants sale, but didn't the investors get back immediately upon purchase a
sizable %age of their initial investment, and then a buy in far below the 8+ plus price, something like 4.37? In
other words, they immediately got back 30% (approx.) plus 4.37 warrant prices?


As far as the JV Geely, that is a very good question for RP, since it is quite clear how you have put it. If true,
then RP has a lot of work to do to explain his position.


Two contradictions, which are not necessarily true contradictions, have me vexed on this company: 
(1) They manipulate prices by saying such things as they will not sell warrants and then do so the very next
day. Just one example of a not so truthful approach.


(2) As Arthur has stated, the CEO is a good business person with millions of his own money tied up in the
company itself. So the survival of the company is definitely in his best interest.


Given that, and other information, I believe both Arthur and RP--lol. However, I am not really intimate with
KNDI as I had some interest in playing it, but I am currently fully in with other securities. Still, I enjoy reading
all of the comments as they are fruitful to my education. And, I admire both Arthur and Richard. They are both
obviously on top of their game.

" In other words, they immediately got back 30% (approx.) plus 4.37 warrant prices?"


No, they paid $6.03, and got shares plus warrants. RP values the warrants at $7,000,000, so HE treats that
as reducing the share price to 4.37. If the investor sold the warrants for $7,000,000, the shares will have cost
$4.37 GUARANTEED. Otherwise, the shares may cost $4.37 in the investor's mind, but he is not
"guaranteed" a profit on his purchase as RP asserts, because, if the shares don't rise in value, the warrants
fall in value every day. RP is claiming, in effect, that the investor could, for example, cash out his shares at
$5.00 and be glad it made the deal, because the shares only cost $4.37, and that just ain't so: the investor
has NOT liquidated the warrants and is at risk on them just as it is on the shares.


I'm not sure what you admire about RP. He is not making sound arguments. You can, however, admire him for
being able to make money by manipulating the price of the stock, but that's a matter of taste. I think he's in
the business of separating fools from their money. I guess someone's got to do it - we need capital too badly
to let fools allocate it - but "admire"?

There seem to be a lot of similarities in the twenty plus articles this author has written. 
1) He chooses a thinly traded stock (easier to move the pps) 
2) Timing of release is consistently near market open (investors must react) 
3) The articles are unduly lengthy (investors can't get through it and must just react) 
4) Most any point that CAN be spun negatively - IS. 
5) His position is always short.


Take a look for yourself - I've made mistakes before - tell me if I'm giving the guy a bum rap?


Overall I have been quite impressed with the quality of authorship on SA. Of course, I don't agree with some of the
opinions authors make - but, most every author makes it clear as to what is fact and what is an opinion.


But, I thought that SA had higher standards in place to make sure that articles published where require to be relatively
fair and balanced?

the price of the stock exceeds the strike price.I have to assume the new investors are confident this will happen. BTW,
since the new investors have been in business for quite a while, I am sure they must have had some winners. I hope
they appreciate the fact that you picked out their worst investments and make them look like complete incompetents.
Especially, since I know they have been following KNDI for the last three years and have done some previous
financing for them.

I don't believe the author was suggesting that Capital has lost money due to investments in penny and

He could also list all the failed investments of Kleiner Perkins, First Round Capital, and other VCs with a
similar finding... risky investment portfolios deliver returns not because any one company is a sure thing, but
because a few will deliver on their huge potential. But I wonder if he "thinks" this means all of their portfolio
companies are "punking" their previous investors.


This recent financing doesn't strike me as a down round.

the option has value from day one.


the option can be sold to someone else or hedged immediately. it is free money on day one.


just like the stock, the options will eventually be worth more money IF the stock goes up and IF the holder
keeps holding.


But there are plenty of investors who are not in the business of gambling on Chinese reverse mergers with
multi year bets. Instead, investors like this get a very cheap deal. They sell as fast as they can. They lock in
an attractive *RISK FREE* profit. They then move on and repeat the process with other companies.


It is a much more certain business model than is stock picking on volatile micro caps.

Mr. Pierson,


I see, in one your charts that exercise price is $7.24. In the other chart you show deductions in current day valuations
re the warrants of a deduction of approximately $7,160,000. I'm confused.....


Answer this question for me....What proceeds, if any, does Kandi receive if and when the warrants are exercised? If
so, why didn't you include another chart to show proceeds to Kandi?


Lastly, if Kandi does receive any proceeds what will be the average price the institutional funds have paid to Kandi for
all the original stock plus the exercised warrants?


I'm so confused.....


10 Jul 2013, 10:10 PM

If all the shares are bought and all the warrants are exercised, Kandi gets $48,772,725.26 (less expenses) for

Author’s reply »  Harris,


The exercise price is $7.24 per share.


If the stock goes above that level in 30 months, the investor would exercise and then deliver $7.24 per share
to Kandi. They are simply buying more new share from Kandi.


If the stock price does not go above $7.24, the warrant will not be exercised and will expire worthless. Kandi
will receive no additional proceeds.


This option has tremendous value to an investor today. It is just like owning an ordinary stock option on any
other company. When the stock is volatile, the option is worth more.


You can look at your option chain screen from your broker to see what Kandi options are worth. The closest
ones are the $7.50 strikes.


All I did was model out the value of a 30 month option and a 60 day option. This is what Kandi gave away to
the investors for free...even though these options are worth $7 million.

A couple questions- First, you indicate that the JV agreement with Geely indicates the results will not be
consolidated. However, doesn't this just mean the equity method will be used to pull down each party's 50%
share of net assets (including retained earnings) instead of gross assets and liabilities? And should the JV
issue publicly traded stock, then the shares would be valued at market value- which would tend to provide
quite a boost at that time, yes?


Secondly, you say Kandi clearly does not have the $80M contribution, but if they have $30-something Million
reserved plus another $26 Million in offering proceeds plus plant, equipment, inventory, technology that could
be converted to cash, and time to make contributions in installments (I believe 3 years or more with approvals
for deals of this size)... is "clearly" really a fair word to use?

Out of the money options are not worthless just because the stock is below the strike price. There is huge
time value involved here.


Out of the money options have huge value and can be sold or used as a hedge.

About the value of the warrants: BEWARE!


One of the most important inputs into the Black-Sholes options calculator is the implied volatility, the higher the
volatility, the more expensive the option. What is the volatility of KNDI? No one really knows what it will be. I checked
out the KNDI 7.50 calls which is the closest to the 7.24 strike price of the warrants and got the following results from
the option chain:


10 days to expiration 152.073% 
38 days to expiration 108.854% 
73 days to expiration 94.494% 
164 days to expiration 78.688%


As you can see, the further the expiration date the lower the implied volatility. What should one use for 915 days? I
used 50% for the series A and C (the author does not even mention series C) and I used 70% for series B. The sum

total value of all the warrants is 78 cents per share making the cost of the shares $5.25 (6.03 - 0.78)


I would like to know why the author used 120% volatility and why he used the same volatility for the shorter and the
longer expiring warrants. By using the higher volatility the author is calculating the value of the warrants at $1.89,
more than twice what I think their fair value might be.


There is a market for KNDI options and I think it is reasonable to use a volatility figure that reflects what the market
believes it to be. Check out the option chain for KNDI,

Author’s reply »  The volatility changes from day to day.


At the time the warrants were given, I used the vol which corresponded to the longest dated options I could
see.


I deliberately included all inputs so that anyone can run their own option model and come up with their own
valuation.


Even if you use the lowest possible vol, you will get a value for the options of millions of dollars that was given
to these investors for free.


Feel free to run your own numbers if you like. The point is that a) the options were very valuable and b) they
were given away for free in order to subsidize the purchase of stock at $6.03

Unlike his strategic article, Pearson is short...and most likely in more ways than one. The shorts, Pearson desperately
among them, are nervous that a subsidy announcement and news for the GVE Expo regarding Kandi's vertical EV
rental garages—the first of which will be unveiled at the Expo later this week or early next—will leave them feeling
squeezed. Like the coordinated and timely PR Pearson speculates on from Kandi, his article, together with
Sharesleuth, is more obviously both coordinated and very timely. Pearson fails to look at company performance.

Pearson fails to acknowledge the value in partnerships with Geely, SGCC and the govt. Pearson fails to write a
balanced pieced. Pearson failed to respond to any comments on his intentionally long piece of drivel. For this I don't
begrudge him. He is short...and positive news will not help his selfish agenda. By contrast, I give credit to the short
who acknowledges Kandi is oversold—Jon Carnes aka Alfred Little among them. Pearson is no Jon Carnes. What he
is, is simply short...most likely in more ways than one. As an earlier post commented, break out the popcorn this
should be fun to watch play out. If I were a betting man, I feel Pearson is sounding like he (and other shorts)
desperately needs to preempt imminent, positive news out of the GVE Expo.

You are not able to scare me to sell my shares...Let me explains where you are fundamentally wrong without a need
to get into the facts: 1) If you assume there is 0% probability for the stock to go above $7.24, the warrants would be
worth 0. Then why do you think the institutional investor is only paying $4.73 instead of their actual cost of $6.03? 2) If
you assume the stock will go above $7.24 so that the warrants are worth something, why do you want investors to sell
instead of waiting to hit $7.24? 3) what is your evaluation model to derive the below $4 in the few weeks with less
than 100,000 shares per day, and 4) I grew up near Hangzhou and I know way more than you do about this
company....I have a Phd in finance, and I know the inherent challenge in valuing a growth stock. This seems to be
purely a scare tactics to me.

Hey, if it turns out the company lied and/or successfully conspired to steal fair share of gains from
stockholders, you have my support to get a lawyer to deliver a fair punishment (along with the SEC and
perhaps Chinese authorities who really don't like corruption they're not sharing). But based on everything we
know now, it would be a waste of your money and anyone else's time.

myhershey
To start, I always appreciate a good contrarian view as this provides out of the box thinking for me to think over an
investment. Your piece contains some easily refutable claims. So let's start with just 2 of these:


1) That there was a coordinate promotion with aggressive articles predicting a metoric rise in the stock.


Art, struftepete and a few KNDI followers have published more bullish and "aggressive" articles touting the potential of
KNDI for years.


2) That the company makes these claims:


a) that the debts had been paid; 
b) that the company didn't need to raise money; 
c) that the company had not been selling stock under the S3.


Nowhere in the Kandi issued PR that said that the debt was paid - it was rolled over. It is a prudent use of debt. If it
can finance it, why not. It can deploy capital that would have been used to service debt to expand their capacity. If
Kandi really needed this money from the S3 raise to pay off the debt, it would not have agreed to the language of only
using for "general corporate purposes."


Nowhere in the recent Kandi issued PR or any other historical PRs that said that the company didn't need to raise
money. If it doesn't, it wouldn't have to file a S3 - right? 
All capital intensive industry (such as auto) requires tons of capital to ramp up production. How else can business
plan for the potential increase in the demand for their car? Is this a prudent business decision? Of course it is!

Now, Elon from Tesla did indeed mentioned that he doesn't need to raise any money, but guess what happened? He
did.


The company said what it was suppose to do in regards to the sell of securities under the S3 paperworks. It will file
the papers within 2 days of such activity - and it did.


It is one thing to mention fraud by others(day traders, etc), it is quite another to mention fraud of the company. We
need to separate that clearly. There has been no proven or clearly articulated fraud committed by the company.


While nothing is guarantee in life (or else, I'll be a trillionaire), there are risks worth taking. Kandi is worth that risk
based on the following:


- China needs EV as one way of eliminating pollution 
- China is unique in its development of the electric grid, renewable energy and the use of batteries in this
infrastructure 
- While a few rich Chinese may be able to afford a Tesla, China in general needs cheap transportation ( that Kandi
provides) for the 99% of its citizens. 
- China needs to promote a consumption based economy. Cheap EV (Kandi) is the way for product/consumption
mobility. 
- China wants to be the leader in EV. Kandi is promoting the right technology, the right business model and the right
price to get this thing moving in a massive fashion (think leasing, short term renting, government assistance and
planning)


Count me in to buy on the dip (I hope it happens)....

Mr. Pearson,


Can you explain in better detail why the effective price that the institutions paid was actually $4.37? That doesn't
seem to make sense to me in light of the warrant exercise price at $7.24 (which obviously has not been reached since
the financing). I'm not sure I follow you on this, and this is a crucial part of your entire argument.


Also, you wrote: 
---- 
The fact that the Geely JV Company will not be a Kandi sub and will not even consolidate the financial results has not
been mentioned by Kandi or its promoters. But the financial implications for Kandi should be painfully obvious to
Kandi shareholders. 
----


Can you explain what these financial implications are? You kind of leave us hanging there without fully flushing out
your argument. Based on this detailed article, you don't seem to be the lazy type, so if you could continue your
thought here, I think we'd all appreciate it.


I'm long KNDI and think it has a lot of upside potential that you choose to ignore here, but I'm also a dispassionate
investor (as much as possible, I suppose) and I'd genuinely appreciate it if you could flush these thoughts out a bit so
people like me can make a reasonable assessment of the merit of this article.

Dirk McCoy, Contributor
He (and the author?) seems to be misunderstanding the statement that each side will create a subsidiary that
the JV will then buy to mean that that neither company will own any of the JV, neglecting the reality that the
JV is being capitalized by owners who will be owners until someone else buys the ownership. The value of
their ownership will show up on their balance sheet as "equity in earnings of associated companies", without
flow-through of assets and liabilities. He also seems to think this was a choice when, in actuality, this
treatment is dictated by changed in PRC GAAP to converge with IFRS.


It's actually the most serious misleading (or false) representation from this article, IMO.

to be run over. You forgot to mention all those impending sales again! And the three factories with 100K capacity each
(fourth under construction). You keep forgetting those and all the other positives about Kandi that justify a fast-
growing capital-intensive business doing a financing to fund the coming explosive growth from their urban mass-
transit program.


By the way, Geely's CEO Li Shufung says Kandi's low-speed electric vehicles are the market segment he expects to
have the fastest growth among all Geely's offerings over the next three years. He assigned his superstar marketing
VP to head the Kandi/Geely JV marketing! (NOT a coincidence, like the things you chose to point out...)


And Kandi investors do understand that unconsolidated subsidiary activity will only be recorded as an investment on
Kandi's books, not shown as part of operations. The footnotes to the financials will probably detail the operations of
the Geely JV.


Since you're into wild speculation, don't you think that JV will be spun off on the HK exchange in a couple of years?
Or maybe Geely will buy out Kandi's half? Or all of Kandi? You have to know this JV is going to be huge... surely you
aren't in denial about that too!


I think it's smart marketing for Kandi to team up with bigger manufacturers the way tiny US biotechs make marketing
agreements with big pharma companies. Why is it standard marketing procedure for them, but when Kandi, with it's
patents and disruptive technology and it's contracts that are way too big for such a small company to deliver on it's
own makes the same type of arrangements with larger partners, you twist it into something nefarious and insulting to
their innovation.


You are so unfair that it seems to be intentionally so. This article implies that normal course of business events are
suspicious coincidences and part of an intent to deceive. It has denigrated a very successful private investment
company that makes lots of fine speculative investments in biotech and high tech in emerging markets. And Capital
Ventures isn't the only fund that's been adding Kandi in recent months, you'll soon learn.


Most longs can see through this rather flagrant attempt to panic them into selling. I don't think it will work in the kind of
large volume you need to cover 1.8 million shorts, many of which might be trapped naked right now. Of course I'm just
guessing, based on the timing and distortions of your article.

Forget about the rental program, this balloon has been brust, I called the rental company in Hangzhou today,
they told me there's no KNDI car actually rented out, and KNDI would never get subsidize from
government,because KNDI does not has a license for produce EV car.


I believe you may a very rich man, seems you even don't care KNDI diverted the money from your investment
and won't share rewards with you. I really can't understand that.


Geely's CEO Li Shufu is a very smart man, he knows KNDI is just a shell, he doesn't want to involve into

Borrowing KNDI for short-selling is no problem in my experience. For one thing I've finished returning the
entire 60K shares or so I borrowed so anyone else can have them now.


I caution shorts though that the gravy train is over and I for one do not intend to try to grab nickles in front of
steamrollers. Let this have a deadcat bounce back to mid-5's and then we're talking.


As for Alfred Little getting a bit burned on his call to go long KNDI it's just further evidence that those who
short well should not try their hands at going long, lol.

The point is that Li Shufu is very excited and proud to be linked to Kandi in this rental program. He speaks
about it often, and claims there will be 5K sales this year. Panda didn't sell for the same reason hardly any
EV's by any manufacturer sold over the last few years... Except Kandi that is. They sold almost 3,000 EV's in
Jinhua and elsewhere under the pilot program. Panda wasn't part of a pilot program, but now they are....
thanks to Kandi. It sounds like you're an impatient investor. Disruptive technologies take time. The price is
down due to a coordinated bear raid. You need to ignore this sort of static and focus on the long term
prospects.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 34/52


At the time of my last article, the stock was over $7.00. I made it clear that a financing was in the works. Many
ardent longs were quick to attack me for such a prediction.


Anyone who listened to me got out when the share price was 40% higher. Even if they didn't like what I had to
say or the fact that I was (and still am) short the stock.


Yet many people continue with the personal attacks to divert attention from the problems at Kandi.


Like I said, I will get back to as many comments as possible over the next few days.


In the meantime, good luck.

HIS MONEY
Does it really matter what the stock price was when you wrote the last $KNDI article? We all know the run up
from 4.00 to 7.00 PPS was overstretched. This pullback is healthy. Recent news is now priced in to the stock
at approx 5.00 per share... i.e. about a 20% increase in PPS where we have consolidated for a few days. The
likelihood that a PPS drops anywhere near pre news levels in very low IMO. These nonsensical SA article
may spur on a little more selling, and leave a long downward tail on tomorrow candle, but I suspect the dip
will be aggressively bought. This is already oversold. Shorts that have not covered to this point are playing on
borrowed time. More positive KNDI news will come soon IMO.

Richard, It's been 36 hours since your above post....Should we expect anymore comments from you?


It appears that many constructive challenges have been made to points you made in this article.


I believe the biggest pps impact from articles published on SA and elsewhere is within a day or two of being
published. Would you agree with that? 
If my assumption is correct - to achieve a fair and balanced discussion - it would be best if the author
responds to worthy comments with 2 days of their release, right?

Sounds very complicated case withso many issues . 
Let's look at the simple one; US investor got punk'd by Kandi.


Is it true that Company let retail investor believe there is no dilution, couple days later dilution news was out . As a
matter of the fact, it most likely already happened when company said there is no dilution.


OK, if your answer yes, maybe first thing is to figure out why and what kind of the xxxx can/will do such thing? Can
people trust anything from this company.....


If you want to defend the company about it, then ,


Good luck

They did not say they wouldn't do a financing. They said they would announce one within two days if and
when they did a financing. They refuted Peason's contention that it would be done without shareholder's
knowing about it timely.

Exactly as Elon Musk did.... No, no, no. I have no plans to finance. Then the stock runs up a few days and he
issues on a shelf registration. Kandi had an issue with Chinese bank financing spiking to 12% and he had no
way to know if it would go down soon, as it did. Luckily the buyer is a long term investment firm and does not
trade.

a) funds sell ahead of the financing, and this fund almost certsinly distributed the entire placement ahead of accepting
the stock, while it was bouncing off $8's.


b) the warrants have time value, which was given for free. The bright side is the stock will be pumped to well past the
strike price UNLESS KNDI registers the warrants for trading, in which case the fund will sell the warrants.


c) if KNDI is NOT licensed to make and sell street legal EV's, they will lose big and the licensed companies will win
big when China pushes EV's as pollution control.


d) the timing of the article was to publish once the facts were in. publishing on the rise without seeing what was
happening completely would be irresponsible. Publishing a few weeks from now when there is no further for the stock
to drop would be a pointless "I told you so".

It seemed that the four-part promotional campaign by KandiI worked. But I wonder if the regulators were liable to

11 Jul 2013, 04:54 AM


Marc Chang, Contributor
“US retail investors who fell for this ruse are now likely feeling "punk'd."  
I don’t believe that your second attempt to deceive and fool investors is going to be a very productive one….


99% of investors were very well aware that the S-3 registration statement was an indication that Kandi was going to
raise money and under normal circumstances it wouldn’t have happened that early. The fact that it did happen earlier,
and at a lower than expected stock value, might have been partly triggered by your first article. 
So definitely, if anyone feels “punk’d” after the fundraising, than who’s to share the blame for “defrauding” retail
shareholders?


Just as in your first KNDI article you again try to deceive shareholders with half-truths and innuendo. 
Let me debunk one of your half-truths that haven’t been taken care of by other KNDI shareholders till now: “This
problem likely stems from the fact that Kandi is not even licensed in China to make Electric Vehicles for use on roads
(i.e., non go carts or ATVs).”


Kandi was approved as a “Special Vehicle Manufacturer” by the “National Development and Reform Commission” in
2006 and has several EVs that were approved by the MIIT and listed in the "Energy saving and new energy vehicle
demonstration and application of recommended models directory."  
All those MIIT approved EVs were street legal Evs for use on road in multiple cities listed in each of the approvals!
Kandi has never promoted it EVs to be “highway legal” but to be a perfect solution as City EVs!

However, when in mid-2011 the new subsidies for private purchase of New Energy Vehicles were launched, the
Central Government added new stipulations, contrary to previous subsidy stipulations whereby it was now specified
that to be applicable for subsidies the NEV cars needed to be M1 Class. 
KNDI’s manufacturers licence didn’t allow Kandi to produce M1 class “Passenger cars” and consequently Mr. Hu
Xiaoming, supported by the Hangzhou Government sought cooperation with car manufacturers that had the
appropriate licence. Kandi then made an arrangement with Zoyte so that it could make use of Zotye’s manufacturer
licence to have its MIIT approved model KD5011XXYEV reclassified as a Zotye JNJ6290EV to become applicable for
subsides. 
When comparing the specs of the above mentioned models it’s obvious, anyone can easily see that the specs are the
same.

Marc, what about the JV Geely-Kandi Panda? Didn't that get the required approvals?


11 Jul 2013, 07:54 AM


silver phantom
You should do more work at KNDI, "Energy saving and new energy vehicle demonstration and application of
recommended models directory." is NOT a production license, however "does not include automobiles" is on
their company business license. 
You also mentioned " MIIT approved model KD5011XXYEV " this model is not a passenger car, it's a MINI
cargo truck,you can check out the list directory #222 to verify it.here is the link from MIIT. 
http://bit.ly/18PApA1 
Till now, this model was never be allowed to run on th street in Hangzhou city, that's why we never see any
KNDI car on the road.


11 Jul 2013, 09:37 AM


Marc Chang, Contributor
And now go to check the car specs for the KD5011XXYEV and compare them with the JNJ6290EV... 
KD5011XXYEV never allowed in Hangzhou? Don't make such a bold statements, I had a ride with that model
in Hangzhou together with a representative of the SGCC.


11 Jul 2013, 10:07 AM


silver phantom
What you've been driving is a Zotye car, not KNDI car, did you checking the registration of that car? I did, all
the EV on the road are Zotye car which model is JNJ6290EV.


I also called DMV Hangzhou yesterday, they told me KD5011XXYEV was never be allowed running on the
road in Hangzhou,only Zotye car, that's why KNDI need to put Zotye label on their car.

Again, you're making bold statements just to serve your purpose. 
1) I drove the KD5011XXYEV before the time that it was renamed JNJ6290EV and approved by the MIIT as
such. 
2) I have pictures with date stamp to prove what I say 
3) There are multiple articles and pictures available from Chinese articles which prove that the KD5011 was
approved for use in Hangzhou. 
As a consequence I will inform SA that you are using lies to serve your purpose.


11 Jul 2013, 07:23 PM


silver phantom
I know you drove KD5011, and I also saw the picture, no one doubt on your picture, I was just saying KNDI
does not have a license to make a car, just like you said it's JNJ6290EV now, not a KNDI model, therefore,
KD5011 does not equal to JNJ6290EV.


Please note,this model JNJ6920EV was listed on the MIIT approved catalogue #240, but it was not listed
under KNDI's name, it's listed as a Zotye car, it belongs to Zotye (Hunan Jiangnan Vehicle), not KNDI, please
check MIIT website again, here is the link: 
http://bit.ly/11Hjihq


As my posting below, KD5011 does not have a CCC certification, and it's just a mini box truck, not a
passenger car, this model would never be approved to use on the road legally.


The only thing we should know is the one approved in Hangzhou is Zotye JNJ6290EV, not a KNDI car, that's
the point.


11 Jul 2013, 10:22 PM


silver phantom
Marc, 
Here's another simple question for your reference:


if KNDI has a license, why they would like to put a Zotye logo on their products? that's too preposterous, as
everyone knows, iphone was made by Foxconn，do you think Apple will sell a iphone with a Foxconn logo on
it? or sell a Foxconn iphone? 
Honestly, you're really so funny.

Marc Chang, Contributor
Yes, hereby a quote from the relevant PR: 
According to No. 27 public announcement of MIIT, Kandi Brand/JL7001BEV model is among the latest vehicles on the
lists of "Approved Vehicles (No. 248)" and "Recommended Models for Energy Saving & New Energy Vehicle
Demonstration and Promotion in China (No. 45)". As a result of this approval, the purchaser of such pure electric
sedan will now be qualified to receive all levels of national and local subsidies and incentives for EVs.


11 Jul 2013, 08:00 AM


Marc Chang, Contributor
And if Mr. Pearson has any doubt that the JL7001BEV is approved as a Kandi model I suggest he looks at the
specs and pictures now available here: http://goo.gl/Uw1bM


11 Jul 2013, 08:04 AM


silver phantom
The JL7001BEV is a real thing, but it does not belong to KNDI, it belongs to JV company, as known: "The JV
Company will not become a subsidiary of the Group or KANDI Group and its financial results will not be
consolidated into the financial statements of either the Group or KANDI Group or their respective
subsidiaries."


Therefore, KNDI diverted money from US investors to established JV company, however, US investor who
hold KNDI stock will never get any rewards from selling JL7001BEV.


That's the point.


11 Jul 2013, 02:06 PM


DWD Investing, Contributor
Silver,


But if KNDI is supplying cars to the JV won't that mean revenue for KNDI?


12 Jul 2013, 01:18 PM


silver phantom
First, KNDI is not supplying any cars to the JV company, the car is supplying by Geely, nothing to do with
KNDI. also the JV car model is Geely Panda, and made by Geely. it could be verified from MIIT website.the
MIIT approved model is a Geely car and must be made by Geely factory in Linhai Zhejiang.


Second, according Geely statement announced: "The JV Company will not become a subsidiary of the Group
or Kandi Group and its financial results will not be consolidated into the financial statements of either the
Group or Kandi Group or their respective subsidiaries."

Which means the investors who hold KNDI shares will never get any rewards from the profits of JV company.
however, the 50% captial of JV company was diverted from KNDI, which means it's US investor's money.

HUH? You don't have to consolidate to get financial benefits. If it's an UNconsolidated subsidiary, it's
profitablility (increase in net worth) is recorded as "gain on investment in unconsolidated sub". If it was
consolidated we'd see the line item detail. But either way, Kandi and Geely record the JV profits!! Of course!

Over 2,000 Kandi EV's have been driving around the streets of Jinhua for well over a year. Maybe more by now. In
Hangzhou there are 30 EV's driving in a pilot program for the leasing plan to commence this summer (almost 6,000
buyers on a waiting list). Plus 100 taxis. All licensed CITY cars, low speed EVs.

Yes, Jinhua is the only city that allows Kandi car running on the road, the model is KD5011,and it should be
only registered as a mini cargo truck, not a passenger car.


Jinhua is the only city that can wink at KNDI doing business without license,because the headquarters of
KNDI is based in Jinhua, in china all company must operate business within scope of business, otherwise,it's
illegal.

cities in China? why only Jinhua?


11 Jul 2013, 02:06 PM


Marc Chang, Contributor
Again, bold statements and twisting of thruths. 
Get your facts right! The subsidized program in Jinhua is for the KD5010XXYEV. 
Every Kandi EV model approved by MIIT lists the cities where it can be used.


Besides, your argument about a licence is a laughter in the case of China. Just look how many Shifeng EV
cars there are in Shandong Province while their EVs were never approved by the MIIT. 


11 Jul 2013, 07:36 PM


silver phantom
You're so funny, please just google "KD5010XXYEV" and see what results you will get, this model was
defined as box truck,厢式运输车 by MIIT, it's not a passenger car, you can also check MIIT website to verify
this.  
I also suggest you search KD5010XXYEV on CQC website, the CCC certification for this model has been
suspended on 2009-12-14, how do you think this model can be driven on the road without CCC certification?


BTW, till now, there's no vaild CCC certification found under KNDI's name, nothing. will you still believe KNDI
have a license to make a car? that's ridiculous.


I also noticed that you mentioned Shifeng EV cars in Shandong, you made a good analogy, the KNDI car is
the same thing as Shifeng EV cars, that's why Jinhua is the only city that allow KNDI car drive in the street,
just like Shifeng car was only be allowed to used in Shandong, in China, that's called regional protectionism,
but that doesn't mean it's legal.

car that wasn't certified? 
And who would believe that the Hangzhou Government would be silly enough to announce a project with
20,000 Kandi EVs...


12 Jul 2013, 12:01 AM

That's you're trying to twist the truth, the truth I want to tell reader is there's only Jinhua government would
wilfully turning a blind eye on KNDI's certification and applied subsidies to it, no more city in China would do
that.

And please do not advertise rental project again, that balloon has been burst. Yes, you just answered your
own question, I believe there's only you would believe "Hangzhou Government would be silly enough to
announce a project with 20,000 Kandi EVs", that's why I said you're so funny.


You really need do more research,Hangzhou government never announced there's a rental projector for 20K
Kandi car, they just announced there's a rental projector needs 20K EV car, never specifically said they'll buy
any Kandi car, that's a lie.


If you want to retort me, please show some official statement from Hangzhou government that could
specifically indicate Hangzhou government would buy 20K Kandi car from KNDI for rental project.  
Of course,I know you can't. so you're right, no one would believe that.


BTW, I also suggest you make a call to the rental company in Hangzhou, and they will tell you the truth, the
truth is till now, there's no KNDI car actually rented to any individual. the phone number is 0571-81023700.


How funny you are............

The rental program is not active YET! Waiting for subsidies to flow and garages to be built (under
construction). Do you think they are building all those garages (confirmed by Hangzhou authorities, not KNDI)
to leave them empty? Hangzhou has been bragging about this upcoming rental program for months! You are
just early... not right!

Thank you, sir, for a very well-thought out analysis of the recent KNDI transaction. This work is of a quality rarely
exhibited on this site. I particularly appreciate the depth of the analysis and the depth of the facts you were able to
bring in. I was unaware that KNDI is not even licensed to make cars in China.

One should seriously question the credibility of this author. But, don't just take my word for it........


Mr. Pearson's last article:  
What The Market Missed On Kandi 
Richard Pearson • Fri, Jun 21 • 115 Comments


Included an Editor's Note from SA: (Editors' Note: The accuracy of some portions of this article have been disputed.)


Here are two reasons I think this editors note from SA should make investors pause and question the integrity of this
author.... 
1) The "Dispute an article" page of SA's websites states: "Seeking Alpha's editorial approach is to interfere as little as
possible with contributors' articles". 
2) When a search is done within SA's website using this editor's note (The accuracy of some portions of this article
have been disputed). Richard Pearson's prior article on Kandi is at the top of the search list and is the only article to
get that editor's note in the last ten months.


Take a look for yourself - let me know if you get the same results.

Anyone else find it a little suspicious that the user, "silver phantom" just signed up to seeking alpha yesterday
and has dedicated all of their comments to bashing KNDI? Not a single comment on any other company...

Yes, I am a new guy here, the KNDI is the worst investment I ever have. I bought 20K KNDI for 6.9 and now
seems only 2/3 left, I signed up yesterday because some inside story mentioned in this article also matched
my research, I think it's worth to discuss now.

So you're new here and you have only recently invested in KNDI? 
What makes you so sure than that with the little bit of study and a few tel calls to China you will suddenly
have so much more knowledge than other long time investors??? 
Your purpose here is quite transparent.


11 Jul 2013, 07:42 PM


silver phantom
I am not only invested in KNDI, but KNDI is the only shell company I found so far, I am just explaining the fact
that I've verified, and I am not going to fight knowledge with anyone. 
It's not about knowledge, all information could be verified through internet easily, you can just pretending not
seeing it, but other investors would getting understand that. KNDI dropped 8% today is just a perfect proof. 
Yes, you're right, my purpose here is really transparent,I am the one want to see KNDI drop to cents.

Don't confuse a bear raid with a lack of fundamental value. You seem to be upset that you timed your buy
wrong and are taking it out on the company. It's not the company's fault that shorts are playing games. The
truth will determine the share price over the long term. Deliveries of cars later in 2013 will overwhelm all these
scare tactics. Don't fall for them... ignore them. Your "facts" are inaccurate. Use the real ones. Nobody sees
Kandi's on the road in Hangzhou because only 30 of them have been released to a pilot program pending
subsidies.

A lot of manipulation going on here. The reality is, we have a company here that has yet to prove that they are able to
build a going concern that create profits for it's shareholders. It's pure speculation and what you need to ask yourself
is, do you trust that there are enough safeguards in place to protect your investment given they are operating
overseas, under a communist regime?

Thanks to you, I've been able to to make substantial gains by taking the long side of some of the companies you
cover.


So far I've gained:


+35.8% from NEPT (starting on your article date on Dec 12) 
+41.6% from TSL (starting on your article date on Jan 7) 
+63.4% from ALNY (starting on your article date on Feb 25) 
+20.1% from NOW (starting on your article date on April 1) 
+47.6% from TEAR (starting on your article date on April 24) 
+17.6% from TSRO (starting on your article date on May 6)


Looks like I'll be getting a good price on some KNDI shares, thanks again and I look forward to future articles!

Tickerman
Correlation does not necessarily equal causation.


KNDI filed in April in anticipation of an eventual capital raise, but to ascribe to the company both the ability and
prescience to pump the share price up for the purpose of a shelf offering is a reach at best. Only an agenda to bash
would suggest loosely linked assumptions


After metaphorically napping for literally years, both volume and PPS of KNDI suddenly woke up. Why then?
Numerous previous press releases and previous articles, including those on SA, had little to no effect on PPS or
volume. What happened this time?


IMHO, a perfect storm of coincidence ran into a thunderhead of timing, producing a light show that attracted sudden
attention. No conspiracy.


Simply put, KNDI broke out on strong volume during a serious market downturn period. That breakout just happened
to put KNDI, for the first time I believe, on the NASDAQ tape...not just on the tape but as a top performer, due to
random market timing, not coordination. Add to that KNDI PPS broke above five bucks which put it on more radar
screens and amid a tide change in favor for Chinese stocks. 
Against this backdrop consider that any prudent manager would naturally want to take advantage of higher prices
when available.


I opine that, although thousands of attentive eyes have been and continue to remain lazer focused on KNDI,
everyone, including KNDI management, was caught by surprise by the rapidity of change. Traders bought, investors
trimmed or added, shorts scrambled to cover and KNDI management (likely gleefully) took advantage of that high
PPS opportunity (amid horrible financing conditions) to execute their shelf offering to raise cash for growth.


Why this is a surprise to anyone amazes me, but that amazement pales in comparison to amazement over a short
author's attempt to morph this into some conspiracy to pump PPS for a fund raise....


Thanks for a good laugh and the opportunity to buy more shares.

This Pearson article is about counting money in someone else pocket. Who cares about how much a fund is paying or
making? It is a done deal. You want to close the barn door now? They filed an S3 a while ago and as any good
managed company they raised capital when it was the proper time. You are abnormally obsessed by this company,
proven by the number of articles in a short span. Your point of view is becoming irrelevant.

The S-3 was out there and the press release implied in my opinion and i would guess 90% of investors that they
would not to a deal in the immediate future- My question to you why would you have a press release like that when
your were negotiating the deal? It's extremely shady any way you slice it and hurt the company's credibility
dramatically. Also, I would guess the investors buying it above 7$ after that press release probably didn't think a deal
was coming that quickly?

5/22/2018 How U.S. Investors Got Punk'd By Kandi - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1543282-how-u-s-investors-got-punkd-by-kandi 48/52


First off, I was short the stock from $7-8, as I posted on the YMB, but covered at $6, and went a big long at the same
time - and stopped out at $5.70. I was bearish simply due to the fact that the share offer priced as I speculated at $6,
also posted on YMB, before it was announced. The trade was purely technical - reading the charts. So, now you know
where I stood in this trading game.


I think the author was far from being factual in several points.


(1) "Predatory financing" was purely sentimental - all stock offers are "predatory" to certain extent, no matter which
other companies you want to talk about. KNDI received the money after the normal expenses, and didn't
"compensate" the buyers of the stock. The so-called $7m demonstration was really a way of promoting to the buyers
of the share offer. The warrants are a show of expectations, both ways, and have no value currently to any party. In
other words, the buyers of the shares offered paid $6.03/share in effect.


(2) The debt the author referred to was already rolled over before Dec 31, 2012. That was documented in the10-K
latest. So, the author was less than being honest on this point too.


(3) The actual structures of the company and its JV and "subs" are way too complicated for any articles by the likes of
the author. In other words, the author was/is simply not qualified to evaluate the structure of the company. It would
take a lot of works from those corporate lawyers to show who benefit from what in that structure. IMO, the author was
far from being truthful about the facts.

Richard Pearson ...... I would love to see you reply to the challenges that H_H makes to your article. And,
make sure your replies to the questions are head on and include sufficient detail.


But, based on the way you've dodged many of the more difficult comments in this and in previous articles -
often cherry picking just a few that are to your liking. 
I'm not exactly expecting much. I mean, you've already made your impact on the stock price and are have
probably moved on to your next thinly traded target.


Come on, prove me wrong......


12 Jul 2013, 01:22 AM


H_H
There was one point I wanted to make but ran out time yesterday. That's point (3) in my previous comment.


It's interesting the author cited the JV framework, but only picked up what he wanted other to see - the author
was microscopic in looking at the JV, but probably failed to look at the big picture, and thus the much bigger
value proposition in the reality.


Remember those who dissed QIHU, FSIN, Focus Media, etc, etc? If one is really serious about doing the
research, they would have picked up the fact that the JV was valued at $1bln via the registration in China. I
don't know how they will manage to achieve that, but I have a strong feeling they will. In other words, Kandi's
50% share of the JV would/will be valued at $500 mln.

That's the big picture the author completely missed. But that's the very reason, I believe, into which those
buyers of the stock offer jumped with great enthusiasm. Can you imagine the real value of KNDI in the eyes of
the Chinese big money players?


That's the reason I want to buy the stock.

wait until after the expo.

There's nothing could be expected on expo, just checked the expo website and found KNDI even not on the
recommend manufacturer list. people in china already recognized what kind company is it, just US investor
don't know yet.

Did you guys see the new EV models on display at the Expo from KNDI? The brand name is sweet, literally.


Anyhow, I bought some last Friday at $4.48, and I like the chart - very deep correction - it suggests very sharp
recovery to $8, in due time.


You must follow the truth - the reality of the EVs in China - the Chinese gov have no other effective option for the next
10-20 years to clean up the air. The big picture is bullish.


15 Jul 2013, 09:07 AM


H_H
I'm sticking with the technical breakout in KNDI. I would suggest everyone take a look at the two-day chart -
that's a beauty, if you didn't chase it over $6-7. But even if you did, I think the stock will be ok in the long run.


The bottom line - the JV with Geely makes KNDI a much better bet - a much bigger and convincing
investment, as the auto makers in China start to consolidate. They need to stand out with a unique line of
vehicles, as the company becomes bigger. The JV makes KNDI a much more credible story in EV's.


16 Jul 2013, 09:14 AM


H_H
Correction to my last post in this section: I meant to say the two-year chart, NOT the "two-day chart", which
was meaningless. I didn't know why I typed two-day, instead of two-year.


16 Jul 2013, 09:22 PM


H_H
I sold my trading position, bought at $4.48 as posted, out at $5.50 yesterday morning. I didn't have time to
update my trade immediately.


Anyhow, I'm looking to reload. This time, I may build a size before I trade it again. One step a time, and be
profitable is always the key - go back to the stocks you got right over and over, and do it as many times as
possible, or until it fails your thesis.


Apparently, "trading scams" are daily events. Real business scams are still not common events. That's my
rule of thumb.

RP can you expand on how you think the warrants fit into a pump and dump scheme.


You say that KNDI found an institution willing to pay 6$ for a stock they knew was more properly valued at 4$ and for
this were compensated with warrants, let us say valued by Black-Scholes at 2$, but for which they may not find any
buyers at all.


This would be too risky a proposition for me as it relies entirely on finding greater fools to unload the overpriced stock
on.


We also need to get rid of the warrants and the only way seems to be to duplicate dynamically the position -warrants
(short call). This calls for an immediate sale of a large number of shares which makes our position as overpriced
longs even more precarious.


We would have to have confidence that we can manipulate the market to absorb a large number of shares at
artificially inflated prices.


That doesn't sound like free and riskless money to me.

Well - it's been eight days since the author's (Richard Pearson) last comment. In total he made a hand-full of
comments (compared to the 170 total comments made so far), addressing just a couple of the many subjects readers
have made challenging claims made in this article. 
His last comment was a mere five hours after this article was released - in it, he states that he would return to respond
to some of the comments made. But, there's been no sign of him since.


I have to say, I'm not all that surprised though - because it SEEMS that Short authors respond to comments much
less frequently than Long authors (for SA articles written about Kandi).


So being a Corporate Financial Analyst - What should one do with a SUBJECTIVE observation such as this????
.....Welllllll......Run the numbers of Course!


So, I went back and wrote down a list of all of the authors who have written an SA article on Kandi. Along with the
number of articles they've written and total number of comments. Then, separated the authors into Groups - Long
Kandi and Short Kandi.


Here are the results with the Ratio of comments per articles written calculated.

Richard Pearson 34 53 1.6 
ShareSleuth 6 3 0.5 
The Geo Team 112 311 2.8 
Totals for Shorts 152 367 2.4


Now - keep in mind - the data is for ALL articles and comments made by each author. Not just articles or comments
on Kandi. 
(Note: this is the only data available). Data is based on the SA website on 7/18/13 at 3PM.


Well it seems my intuition was right this time...... Long authors have written 30.3 comments per article while short
authors have only written 2.4 comments per article they've written.


So, I'd like to hear from some of the readers now.... 
- Are these numbers surprising? 
- Why is there such a disparity? 
- Why aren't the short writers writing more comments? Should it be "required" that authors respond to legitimate
challenges?

I have to say that this is a bad article even the author claimed that he is a banker.


Yes the company who provided the financing did have made instant huge profit. But the KNDI got needed money to
support its business plan.
