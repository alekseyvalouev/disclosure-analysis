Don't Get Zulily'd By Wayfair's Overstocked Valuation
Top Idea | Aug. 17, 2015 5:00 AM ET21 comments
by: The Friendly Bear


Summary


Spoiler Alert: we have seen the Wayfair movie before and it does not end well…the
company is a money pit combination of Overstock.com's business model with
Zulily's advertising strategy.


We see the stock trading to $12/sh (75%+ downside, 0.5x 2016E sales) as growth is
inevitably going to hit a wall and margins are going to inevitably disappoint.


Zulily is the ultimate case study in what will soon happen to Wayfair…a spectacular
collapse as a result of diminishing returns to advertising dollars.


The only thing disruptive about this company is that it has somehow found a way to
lose money on a scaled revenue base of $2 billion.


We suspect the magnitude of Wayfair's revenue "beats" are going to start dwindling,
and given the house of cards valuation, we think that is enough to reverse the
stock's momentum.


With Wayfair (NYSE:W) shares going through one of the most epic short squeezes we
have seen in recent months, we thought it was time to take a view on this supposedly
disruptive force in online home goods retailing.


In our years of short selling, we have seen our fair share of short squeezes and always
think it is important to understand the dynamics behind a squeeze to test our thesis.
Sometimes promotional management teams get a stock's momentum going. Other times,
the culprit is "overeager" sell-side analysts who tie valuations to irrelevant comps and
construe even the most negative of data points as "sources of future opportunity".


But sometimes a stock price movement is grounded in nothing but sheer stupidity.


So today we offer a proposal. If you have been in the market buying Wayfair at north of
$50 per share, please give us a call…we have a collection of Beanie Babies from the
1990s that we are still looking to offload, and we think you would be the perfect buyer.

What is Wayfair? It is an "inventory-light e-commerce player that is disrupting the home
goods market". What else is Wayfair? It is a ~$2 billion revenue company that is magically
managing to lose money (please pause, take a deep breath, and think about this statistic).


It is no easy feat to lose money at that level of revenue scale (especially in an asset-light
model), and we think Wayfair management ought to be commended for putting together a
company that can generate $2 billion of revenue yet STILL lose money.


So let's break down Wayfair into simpler terms. Wayfair goes out and "acquires"
customers - through aggressive TV advertising, Google keyword buying, and Facebook
advertising. These customers have no loyalty to Wayfair - they simply are in the market for
some furniture or are convinced to buy furniture due to Wayfair's never-ending advertising
campaigns. If these customers have even half a brain, they will price comparison shop
Wayfair against other companies (and given Wayfair is moving the same items that are

sold on Amazon and Overstock, as well as dozens of other e-commerce merchants,
customers are likely to choose the e-retailer that either has the lowest price or the best
shipping terms).


The Competitive Landscape for Barstools:


Wayfair is then responsible for processing the shipping of customer orders from 3rd-party
suppliers to customer homes. In other words, Wayfair does not make anything nor does it
have a real brand. There is no reason to believe that any amount of advertising spend will
create a brand for this company. The recent failure of Fab.com (that was once valued at
~$900 million) is a good example of how horrendous these e-commerce companies can
be.


This model likely reminds you of Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK). Congratulations. That
is because Wayfair is Overstock.com.


The only difference is that Wayfair management has somehow convinced investors that
losing lots and lots of money today is a wonderful way to build a brand.

Of course, the sell-side analysts that cover this stock have been careful to minimize the
comparisons between W and OSTK. OSTK has about the same amount of revenue as
OSTK yet trades at a $400M total enterprise value, versus W that trades at a 10x larger
total enterprise value of $4B.


Given Overstock.com has been executing on Wayfair's business model for over a decade,
we think a lot can be learned from the Overstock case study. The key learning from OSTK
is around potential profitability for Wayfair at maturity. Note that OSTK's adjusted EBITDA
margins have reached at best 2.5% in the past 7 years:

Wayfair management thinks they will somehow get their EBITDA margins to 8%+, but
reason, logic, and history suggest that Wayfair will at best be a ~2% margin business once
the growth engine is turned off. Even if Wayfair hits the insane sell-side revenue estimates
for 2020 that are as high as $9B, and even if you assume Wayfair commands a very
healthy (and nonsensical) EV/EBITDA multiple of 12x on those numbers, you are looking

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3443236-get-zulilyd-wayfairs-overstocked-valuation 5/19


at a valuation of around $2B for the business, 50% below the current valuation of $4B.
And that valuation is 4-5 years out! Consider all the execution risks that come along with
trying to take a business from $2B of revenue to $9B of revenue.


However, given the short interest dynamics and the lack of profits, we acknowledge that
this stock has completely disconnected from fundamentals. Nonetheless, we think it's
time to press the short.


In the near term, we are highly confident that the investors buying into W shares are
buying based on momentum and the expectation of top-line beats. In our view, these
investors are either unfamiliar with Zulily (NASDAQ:ZU), or are making the same mistake
twice.


The similarities between ZU and Wayfair are uncannily eerie, with the only real difference
being about one year of separation between IPOs. In fact, if you're having a hard time
seeing the similarities between ZU and W, we challenge you to spend the evening
watching Law & Order re-runs on WE tv.


We are willing to bet that during one of the commercial breaks you are going to be hit with
back-to-back commercials from ZU and W (and for extra-credit, stick around and wait for
the Care.com commercials which are also almost certain to appear).


Wayfair is just using the ZU advertising playbook (but doing so in a steroid-enhanced
manner). We already know how that story ends. We do not need to finish this episode of
Law & Order to figure out which way the jury is going to swing…


Jack McCoy has been converted into a Wayfair brand loyalist as a result of being
inundated with 6 Wayfair commercials per Law & Order episode…

Here is a quick compare/contrast of the ZU and W business models:

In fact, the biggest mistake Zulily management ever made was coming out as a public
company with positive adjusted EBITDA margins. The Wayfair guys got that part right.
Once investors know how much you can make, one element of the dream is dead. Zulily
was forced to maintain profitability in order to keep its valuation up. Wayfair, on the other
hand, benefits tremendously from providing suckers with the ability to dream the dream -
because…just IMAGINE where margins could go if they are negative now?


But for anyone long Wayfair shares, we think you need to stare HARD at the chart below
as our crystal ball tells us that Wayfair's NTM performance is going to play out in an eerily
similar manner.

And here is Zulily's stock price performance:


Wayfair in our view is actually far worse than Zulily because its unit economics look
atrocious.


Wayfair management points to the chart below as evidence that Wayfair's business has
positive unit economics, to challenge the view in the bear camp that Wayfair is losing
money on its new customers:

First of all - let's be clear. This is a transactional business. Customers come, buy things,
and go away.


According to our research, home goods purchases are often clustered in 3-6 month spans
during periods of redecorating (i.e. following a move). So, at a base level, we
fundamentally challenge the notion that lifetime value ("LTV") is even relevant for a
transactional business model such as Wayfair's. If you do not make money on interactions
today, there is no reason to believe you will ever make money on interactions.


But let's humor Wayfair management and roll with their analysis for a moment.


The company would have you believe that its customer acquisition costs ("CAC") are at a
healthy level (despite the fact that the company's P&L looks dreadful). We suspect that lot
of massaging needed to take place to get to a reasonable CAC - but we would note that
even if you take the company at face value, a $64 customer acquisition cost is absurdly
high. Why? Because according to the company itself, ~76% of customers order only once
in a year then never return in that year. We know this from the company's S-1. We wonder
why this data was never incorporated into the customer LTV math.


Repeat Rate from Wayfair S-1

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3443236-get-zulilyd-wayfairs-overstocked-valuation 9/19


Source: Wayfair SEC filings


We think a more appropriate and intellectually fair way of looking at this CAC math is to
spread the advertising cost out against net new customer additions - in which case the
CAC number would be something in the $125 range.


We will split the difference with management for the purposes of this analysis. Therefore,
in our opinion Wayfair is spending something between $64 and $125 to add new
customers. We will presume for a moment that $95 is the right number to center around
(our generosity will not matter for this analysis because even $64 will prove to be a highly
unattractive CAC).


Of the ~300-400k customers that Wayfair adds each quarter, historical cohorts would
suggest that 76% of these customers order once and never come back (per Wayfair's S-
1). Therefore, Wayfair is spending ~$95 to add a customer and 76% of new customers are
ordering only once in a year.


We will assume that the customers who order only once in a year need to be re-recruited
the next year if they fell into the so-called "one-and-done" bucket (they obviously did not
like the service enough to repeat order, suggesting that they either had a horrible
experience or were just in it for the daily deal). Average Wayfair customers spend around
$210 per order at a 20% contribution margin, generating around $42 of contribution
margin per order for Wayfair. Therefore, Wayfair is losing around $50 on ~76% of its new
customer additions (the $42 less the $95 spent to acquire the customer).

So we have serious doubts around how the unit economics could ever work unless
the remaining ~24% of customers are making dozens of orders with Wayfair. Given
the company has an average order rate of ~2 orders per customer, we rest our case.


Perhaps then Mr. Shah should be less confused as to why the short interest in his stock is
so high:

Putting aside the clear overvaluation (OSTK vs. W) and the likelihood of momentum
deceleration (ZU as a case study for W) there are really two things that matter on Wayfair
in the near term:


1. A management team that knows how to play the "beat & raise" game by setting the bar
low, shifting the focus away from profits, and guiding for ~10% beats


2. A low float highly shorted situation (given the recent price movement, we think a
secondary is imminent)


Point 1: A management team that knows how to play the beat & raise game:

Street analysts were enthralled over Wayfair's recent revenue beat. Analysts could not get
enough of the "top-line momentum". Who could have ever expected that the beat would
be around 10% on the top line?


Well, based on this chart, just about everyone could have expected that magnitude of
beat:


So we are going to let you in on a little secret. Based on management's guidance on the
call, revenues in 3Q are likely to beat yet again (surprise surprise!)…however the
magnitude of the beat is likely to decline…and as experienced momentum stock investors
should know - when the beats get smaller, the stock prices do as well. Look at Wayfair's
stock price change in the November quarter when it beat by only 9% - it was down 16%
on that print. GRUB is a great example of how recent beat and raise stories eventually
fatigue.


So why are we so confident of this beat?


On the 2Q call, we were given a guide of 56-66% direct segment top-line growth for 3Q,
and furthermore we were told that the direct segment growth rate so far in the 3rd quarter
was less than the 81% growth rate seen in the 2nd quarter but above the 66% high end of
guidance.


How kind and sweet of Wayfair management to set guidance below where the business is
currently running.


The Wayfair long investors must be so glad to know that management has continued to
set the bar low and provide themselves room for a completely unexpected top-line beat
in order to support the house of cards valuation that currently holds up Wayfair shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3443236-get-zulilyd-wayfairs-overstocked-valuation 12/19


So did the sell-side analysts take Wayfair management at face value when updating their
estimates? Revenue estimates should have been set at around $550M based on
management guidance. Sell side analysts must have heard the same thing and inputted
this into their models, right?


Of course not. Given Wayfair is a beat & raise money pit story, the essence of the
momentum in this stock is based on continued big beats. So for those of you expecting a
beat in 3Q, congratulations you are in luck. You have been all but promised revenue of
$550M or so in 3Q versus consensus numbers that are sitting at only $525M (the high end
of guidance).


Now for the bad news…


The market appears to have grown accustomed to 10% beats relative to the high end of
guidance. Wayfair's high end of guidance currently sits at $525M. We ran a quick analysis
to determine how quickly the direct segment would need to grow in order to beat the high
end of guidance by 10% in 3Q…and the results suggest that the company is unlikely to
beat its guidance by much more than a ~5% level (~550M vs. consensus expectations at
525M).


Our analysis suggests that Wayfair will need to put up ~85% growth in the direct segment
in order to placate the market's desire for 10%+ top-line beats. This is certain feasible, but
it would require a massive acceleration in the 3Q revenues in the back half based on the
color commentary on the call (as a reminder, management indicated the direct segment
growth was running below the 81% seen in 2Q).


We therefore expect that the momentum train that has been taking Wayfair shares ever
higher is about to come to an abrupt halt.


We also want to take brief moment to recognize the analyst at Cowen who was so
surprised by Wayfair's ~10% 2Q revenue beat that he decided to take his 2020 revenue
estimate up from $6.6B to $9.1B. Beating by 10% in one quarter tells us a lot about a
revenue figure 5 years out right?

We look forward to seeing how analysts adjust their estimates on this name as the beats
turn into massive misses…


Point 2 - A Word of Caution to Long Investors Who are Playing the Short Squeeze:


Whether you're long or short this stock, one piece of push back we expect to hear is that
the short interest is simply too high for Wayfair to "work" on the short side. We suspect the
high short interest is also attracting longs who like "playing the squeeze". We point both
the longs and the reluctant shorts to World Acceptance (NASDAQ:WRLD) which presently
has short interest in excess of 70%. Generally speaking - when there is smoke, there is
fire. We caution any investor playing the short squeeze game to recognize that
astronomically high short interest generally exists because the shorts are right:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3443236-get-zulilyd-wayfairs-overstocked-valuation 14/19


We assembled an appropriate list of comps that are actually comparable to Wayfair (i.e.
we left out BABA which many sell side analysts include in order to inflate the comp set
revenue multiples given that BABA is a model that commands very high gross profit
margins).


Based on these comps, we believe that an appropriate revenue multiple for Wayfair is
around 0.5x sales. We expect the stock will re-rate to these levels (in line with ZU) once
growth hits the wall. Based on the ZU case study outlined above, we think W will start to
show cracks over the course of the next twelve months given it came out 1-year after ZU
and also started juicing its advertising right around the time it went public.


We expect the company to generate $2.2-2.4B of revenue in 2016. We believe that 0.5x
sales represents an appropriate discount to Zulily (given ZU has a superior margin profile
to W), and an appropriate premium to OSTK (as we expect W will continue to demonstrate
superior growth).


Based on this valuation range, we think the stock is worth around $12/sh, or around 75%
less than today's price.


For patient short sellers, this represents an asymmetric opportunity, assuming one can
weather the quarterly volatility. This stock is trading ahead of any fundamental value it
could ever reach. We believe that the patient shorts who are willing to wait for the ZU-like
break will be rewarded handsomely.


Following our short recommendations on TRUE and FRPT, we are adding Wayfair to our
Stocks that are Poised to Plummet list.

W will ever be. The ZU takeout valuation was also done at a total enterprise value that is

also note that strategic interest in ZU only picked up after the company saw its growth rate

Coleman's, Bob's Discount. Wayfair had no specific advantage. Most of these companies sell the same furniture, with
slight differences in prices. There is absolutely no brand loyalty in this business, and nothing spectacular about
Wayfair from a client's standpoint.


On top of that, the furniture business is a horrible business to be in, with intense competition, awful services, high
costs etc.


18 Aug 2015, 12:35 PM


buysideanalyst14
I don't think you understand salvatort. W is revolutionizing the way we buy furniture. See, there is this thing
called the internet, ever heard of it? And with the click of a button, you can have everything you ever wanted
to delivered right to your front door. Armed with this information, how could you not want to own W????


Your comments are exactly right, W is spending hundreds of millions on advertising to build a brand that no
one cares about. And because of this, they will never earn anywhere close to the 8% EBITDA margins they
think they can get. Sure they can grow topline, but anyone can if they are just buying revenues.

Is anyone buying puts on W? Stratospheric IV.

I have purchased two items from them and the experience was excellent. The sight is very well done. I don't buy the
bear case yet. Will need to see if customers like me keep coming back.

A major problem for them is their competition. There is not much of a difference between Wayfair and Hayneedle,
Amazon, Overstock, the manufacturer's website, and the hundreds of other home goods' companies online. Plus brick
and mortar companies like Costco, Ikea, Pier One Imports, Home Goods, etc are improving with their merchandising
and pricing. I do like Wayfair's loyalty rewards, but I'm sure that doesn't help their margins.

OSTK has a big loyalty rewards program too and they make 2% EBITDA margins. W will be no different.

If I were the Wayfair team I would think of using the higher currency to do a secondary and or buyout furniture
retailers with strong distribution and delivery networks to increase their margins...thye could easily buy about $1 billion
worth of revenues from a bunch of regional cmpanies in the USA and easily get 10% EBIT margins and leverage that
expertise and knowledge nationwide.


Correct, they would no longer be an asset-light model but they could turn into amazon by having the warehousing for
all furniture and use some local furniture retail brands....


I am sure in the early 2000's a similar case was made about Amazon and it has evolved pretty well...the key thing
here is...will the management be smart about their higher currency and decision making to avoid a Zulily? IF so, what
will they do. Nevertheless, I like your article and do believe the same will happen unless they make a big change.

I find it rather curious that the Citron short thesis failed to address valuations when comparing Wayfair to Zulily.


For my first point, Wayfair is currently trading at around 1.5x TTM sales (so it's cheaper than Zulily!). Liberty's intent to
acquire them for $2.4B puts about a 2 times TTM sales valuation on the company. If I owned W and it got acquired for
2x sales, I'd take that to the bank.


Second, Zulily was outrageously expensive to begin with. Take a look at the price to sales multiple the market paid for
Zulily when the company went public. They opened at almost 10 times their trailing twelve month sales and peaked
soon after at almost 16 times!! When Wayfair came public, they opened with a price to sales multiple of under 2.5
times TTM sales.


Thoughts?

Let me get this straight. You're arguing W - hemorrhaging cash, but phew a cheaper price to sales ratio - is cheaper
than ZU, a dreadful yet profitable company. I never thought I'd defend ZU, but hey, at least ZU has a PE ratio which is
a real number, versus infinity for W.


You know it's a comedy show when folks are arguing 0.5 points of PRICE TO SALES and that justifies the "bargain".
Ah yes, price to sales, the well-utilized metric to value investors and bargain hunters everywhere. Not.

As a former supplier of durable goods to Wayfair and other ecommerce retailers, I agree with your assessment. They
have no competitive advantage that might assure repeat customers.


They also try to squeeze their suppliers with onerous terms and conditions. We did not like doing business with them
and I think they will eventually fail.

Luke, they have benefited from the consumer's transition from brick and mortar (PIR) for home goods/furnishings to
the internet. But I do agree, they have absolutely no moat--anybody can do this and offer loyalty points. In fact, they
have a ton of competition, many with better prices. Eventually the stock will get drilled, just a little early while the
investment banks hold this one up.
