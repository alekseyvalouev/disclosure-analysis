Why Owning National Bank Of Greece Common Stock Is An Awful
Decision
Oct. 23, 2013 9:53 AM ET134 comments
by: Xuhua Zhou


Buying or holding National Bank of Greece ("NBG") common stock in either Greece
[TICKER: ETE] or in the U.S. (NBG) at its current price is an extremely unwise decision an
investor can make. The investment case for wanting to buy NBG is understandable at a
high level, but investors are making three grave errors and may very well cost them
significant money in the near future:


1. Investors are confused by the actions of larger hedge funds who are investing in Greek
banking stocks


2. NBG is the most overvalued bank stock by almost any metric
3. There is a simpler solution to benefit from a stronger NBG, with lesser risk and far


greater upside


Background


Often, when equity markets show great performance for a long period of time, as they
largely have done since 2009, investors look to find ways to participate that might provide
significant upside if the economic picture continues to improve. We have seen this
dynamic many times this year in a number of stocks where momentum was the pure
driver of the stock price. In May, the stocks of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie
Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) rose 393% and 358% respectively as the average retail investor
mimicked famous hedge fund managers who publicly disclosed investments in these
companies. What the average investor did not realize was that the hedge funds were
largely buying the preferred shares of these entities (at substantial discounts to par value)
and when the bubble popped on FNMA and FMCC, the stocks declined 58% and 57%
respectively over 2 days.

A similar dynamic appears to be occurring with U.S. retail investors and day traders
buying the common stock of NBG. As can be seen in the following chart, the price of the
Greece common share trades in a reasonable manner throughout the Greek trading day,
but rises significantly (nearly 10%) upon opening of the U.S. market (see 9:30 time on 7-
Oct-13).

This indicates speculative trading by investors who are ignoring fundamentals. This is a
pattern that has continued as can be seen in the following two charts (see 9:30 time on
18-Oct-13 and 21-Oct-13).

Day traders gravitate towards the NBG common stock because of liquidity and easy
access, as it is traded in the U.S. However, keep in mind that Alpha Bank
(OTCPK:ALBKY) also has an ADR that trades approximately three million shares per day

and is likely a better bank and a better investment to play a Greek recovery through (as
explained later).


Follow the Leader Again?


Why are investors so enamored with a Greek recovery? They are again following the lead
of a few prominent hedge fund investors (such as John Paulson, Seth Klarman, David
Einhorn, Mark Mobius, etc). These investors all have publicly stated that they have
invested in a Greek recovery by buying into the recapitalized Greek Banks as shown in
the following 2 articles:


Paulson leads charge into Greek banks and Einhorn's disclosed position in Greek banks.


So naturally, what do retail investors do? They follow the leader and buy shares that they
believe will benefit from a recovery in Greece. Given that NBG is the most visible and
liquid way for U.S investors to invest in Greece due to a liquid and actively traded ADR,
NBG became the darling. Since October 1st, NBG stock is up 56% and the volume is
165% higher than it has been over previous 3 months.


Celebrity Investors are Playing a Different Game


Unfortunately the retail investors buying into NBG may not be making the right bet. The
celebrity hedge fund managers had made their investments in Greek banks in a selective
manner. In all cases, not one famous fund manager has mentioned National Bank of
Greece as an investment they have made and for good reason. The hedge funds are
actively invested in the other recapitalized banks of Greece, Piraeus Bank and Alpha
Bank.


Why has the smart money avoided NBG?


The smart money has avoided NBG for a number of reasons:


1. It is the most overvalued bank, not only in Greece, but as compared to other European
banks and even the largest and most well-capitalized U.S. financials


2. It is hardly even an investment on a Greek recovery
3. There is a way to participate in the upside of National Bank of Greece without taking


most of the downside risk associated with owning the common shares


Let us address these individually:

Bank Valuation: most commonly used metric for valuing a bank is its book value and in a
lot of cases, investors would compare Price to Tangible Book Value. We will look at both
as follows. NBG is clearly overvalued by these metrics. On a price to book value NBG is
overvalued by 50-70% vs. the average valuation of its peers. On a price to tangible book
value, it could be 100-200%.

Additionally, research analyst community has placed price targets on the stocks of NBG
and others - NBG has materially overshot these price targets while the other banks still
offer compelling value.

Country of Operations: The name National Bank of Greece can be quite misleading. While
it is true that the bank has meaningful operations in Greece, over half of its revenue is
generated outside Greece and greater than 100% of its profitability comes from Turkey
along with a significant portion of its value.

With NBG, Turkey + Other accounts for 58% of revenue. Turkey is the only profitable
region. Additionally, a large portion of NBG's value is attributed towards its Turkish
operations, Finansbank AS. As Finansbank is publicly traded, we can see the market
capitalization of €3.0 billion of which NBG owns 95%. This implies that Finansbank
accounts for €2.9 billion of NBG's total valuation. Based on NBG's current market
capitalization of €11.3 billion, the implied remaining value in NBG excluding the Turkish
operations is then €8.4 billion. The implied price to tangible book value (calculated below)
that investors will pay for the Greek operations (excluding Turkey) is a staggering 3.0x.
Readers should be aware that most other peers trade around 1x book value. Imagine this
premium being paid for a bank with borderline capital adequacy ratios and 25% non-
performing debt ratio.

While Turkey can be an attractive market, a large portion of the value of NBG is contingent
on Finansbank. Are investors really prepared to take on the meaningful risk associated
with the Turkish operation as opposed to a Greek recovery? Are investors even aware that
their play on a Greek recovery is not even all that Greek after all?


NBG Warrants: A Much Better Way to Invest in NBG


For those who would want to stay involved in NBG, the warrants are much more attractive
as an investment than the ADR. These warrants participate in 100% of the upside for a
fraction of the cost. As such, the amount of capital being risked by an investor who buys
the warrants is a fraction of the loss possible for a common stock buyer.


Each warrant allows the investor to buy 8.23 shares of NBG. The strike price to exercise
the warrant on December 27th is €4.37 ($6.02) which means the warrant holder can get
all of the upside on any NBG price increases at a fraction of the cost. Currently, the
warrant costs €1.80 ($2.48) which means you can buy an in-the-money call option for
€0.22 ($0.30) a share. Why pay €4.70 ($6.47) for the shares when you can pay €0.22
($0.30) for the same upside with the warrants?


See below the potential trade value on buying an equal dollar amount of warrants versus
shares.

So what is going to happen?


Because the warrants are in-the-money for the December 2013 strike date, arbitragers will
exercise the warrants to buy the shares at a discount to current market value. This will
increase the amount of tradable shares on the market and may pressure the stock. Given
the over valuation that is already present, the upside in NBG may very well be limited? For
those who bet on further upside to be had, the warrants are a way better way to
participate.


Conclusion


It is quite apparent why the prominent billionaire investors have not invested in NBG
common stock. It is not only very overvalued, but it does not even offer the best way to
play a Greek recovery. Also, do not be fooled by the chart - NBG issued 2.2 billion new
shares in June and such dilution will mean it will be decades before it reaches anywhere
near the previous highs seen in the past.


If your excuse for owning NBG common stock is that this is the only way you can logically
invest in Greece, you should ask yourself if that is a sufficient way to approach investing.
One could have said that multiple times over the past year. We remember in May when
the same sentiment sent the stock up to $24. In fact, those who invested on that basis in
May near the previous peak would be down 74% on their investment. So with regards to
an investment in NBG common stock, we draw on two quotes from the most successful
investor of our time, Warren Buffett:


1. Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy
2. The stock market is a no-called-strike game. You don't have to swing at everything -


you can wait for your pitch.


With NBG stock up 52% in the past 14 trading days, one needs to wonder if the crowd is
currently greedy or fearful.


Disclosure: I am short NBG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article. I hold a short position in NBG and long the
warrants

Excellent article. Seems every month or so we'll see NBG skyrocket and then come back down hard. Weird situation
but long the warrants is a very good hedge.

Be very very very carfeul with TBV or BV. BV is always inaccurate for banking stocks (completely subjective)
and TBV is only calculable by only the most diligent of analysts who focus on banks.


Where did you get your statistics from?

Id really like to see an answer to Redrut's question...Also, I'd like to see the effects of TBV in the good
bank/bad bank scenario which NBG has commented should be taking place within the next 2 months. It was
around this time the GB/BB news was leaking that this NBG rally really started taking off. They are the first of
the banks who are trying this with Piraeus trying to complete it by Q1 2014. Funny the author mentions going
long Alpha and is short NBG. Last time I heard a strategy like this on SA it was O. Davies going long MTG
and short RDN. With the ATHEX going parabolic, and the MSCI adding NBG and a few other Greek blue
chips to the MSCI emerging market index in November, I feel like this is the inverse of catching a falling knife..

"Why Owning National Bank Of Greece Common Stock Is An Awful Decision"


Really? I honestly don't think most investors with a brain need much of explanation on why not to own something
called the "National Bank of Greece." The name of that stock says pretty much everything you need to know about it.

If you buy NBG now you will have a very, VERY high dividend yield on your cost basis if you are willing to be patient
for a few years. (NBG paid a $4.90 dividend as recently as 2006)


In the future, income investors will flock to NBG.


Warrants aren't available to U.S. retail investors.

NBG market cap is 14.5B with Enterprise value 48B, 0% long term debt and return on equity of 14.53%. It is an
excellent long term investment whether you hold the common stock or the ADRs.

NBG had a market cap of EUR 20B at the peak of the bubble. The only reason its stock price is so low is
because of the huge dilution (90% now owned by the financial stability mechanism). Even if it were to return
to such levels-something totally unreasonable-the upside is a mere 30% while the risk is huge.

The European banking system is pretty weak. Watch what happens with the stress tests (assuming they are
finally credible). What happens to NBG when European banks start having trouble?

A 30% upside is not good enough given both the risk of the investment and the time it will take to materialize.
Even if Greece returns to growth next year (which as a Greek I believe it is highly unlikely), it will take almost
a decade of slow growth and deleveraging for the GDP to reach each 2007-08 peak.

They are just too cheap to pass up even if it doesn't exceed 7. I will at least profit off the premium.

This article highlights that the warrants are clearly the cheapest way to participate in this stock (see hockey stick

There is also massive potential dilution from the warrants come December.

The problem with warrants is that they are not liquid and may be difficult to get out of them when the market
turns against you.


23 Oct 2013, 01:29 PM

There is no dilution from the warrants. Stocks will be sold by the financial stability mechanism, so the total
shares outstanding will not increase.

IMO NBG reminds me of Citigroup when they were just a buck. 95% of investors were counting them out too. When
an economy tanks the banks usually fall right with it but when an economy starts improving it's the banks you want to
be invested in. IMO NBG is a great spec play .

As I mentioned in other comments as well, its market cap is huge (14B) compared to its historical level. The
price is low due to dilution, not low valuation.

Can you explain how the market valuation became 14B. it was around 1.3B in dec 2012.

You should use warrants mostly for downside protection, not for upside gains.

My view: buying NBG is a smart decision.


We have already made few doubles trading on NBG. Recent double is from $3.00 to yesterday's $6.36. We may see
$10.00 by year end or early next year.


Greece is now in emerging market category and the company is going to see rapid growth in coming years.


Bank of Greece has been profitable in last few Q even in difficult environment.

Great article, Xuhua.


Not sure if I even agree with the big name investors who are buying into the "Greek recovery" theme, as the real
problem is and always been the Euro. But even ignoring that, you're right --- there are better banks to buy than NBG.


23 Oct 2013, 12:49 PM


Wisdom7777
in times of recovery, especially during the first phase, shares often move in a positive overreaction, and discount
future profits similar to the pre-crisis times. This is ONLY STARTING with NBG in my opinion, and could lift it into the

Certainly, the warrant provides an incredible potential. It will move like dynamite if the shares moves just moderately.

This article is materially wrong. Finansbank is valued at €8.1 billion not €3 billion. In other words this guy undervalues
the finansbank stake by 270%!!. US investors cannot do the warrants play. Prem Watsa, the warren buffett of canada,
tried to buy a stake but was unable to get terms due to the bailout conditions. Lastly, the Latsis family invested heavily
in the recap of NBG.

You are the one that is mistaken! Finansbank is worth 8.1 B TRY (turkish lira), so about 3B Euros! Get your
facts right!


23 Oct 2013, 07:55 PM


CihanYildiz
When evaluating Finansbank, you should take into account that recently it's p/e ratio is 6,9. It's very cheap for
a profitable bank with a healthy balance

Given the numerous threats to the Turkish economy (both political and macro) PE of 6.9 does not appear low.

The the person which sold 10'000 Call Jan2015 5$ Strike and bought 20'000 Call Jan2014 7$ Call ... doesn't seem a
retail investor to me. This is just one of the Example of the very bullish options trades we witnesses this month.


That's what the big money are betting on. NBG above 8.65 by the end of 2014.


He will also have a little bit of insurance ... and if NBG is below $5 ... he will pocket in part of the premium (about
$350,000)


On that Trade the Maximum loss is about $1,650,000 if PPS at expiration is 6.99


$1,000,000 in profit for each 1$ NBG settles above $8.65


23 Oct 2013, 01:23 PM


platonicbomb
If someone bought a high-strike 2014 call and sold a low-strike 2015 call he's not all that bullish. He thinks
anyone buying it now is a sucker and the stock is going to plummet next year. And he's probably right.


24 Oct 2013, 02:37 PM


UNEMON1
well ... unfortunately ... I do not agree with you on this one. It would be bearish ... if he had sold the same
amount of Contracts. For Example ... if he has sold 10k contracts of the low strike and had about 10k
contracts of the high strike. Such a trade would be bearish because the traded obviously was looking to cash
in the premium ...of the calls he sold.


However, buy buying a double quantity of high strike calls ... it becomes a pretty bullish bet! ... This is
because the premium he cashes in is insignificant.


It is a bet ...on NBG above 8.65 by 2015. ... ... Ha he wanted to place a bearish bet, he would have bought
only 10k of the higher strike contracts.

Apparently traders do have a different opinion about NBG potential. One of the most popular trade today was : 
- long Dec2013 6$ Call --->-$0.40 
- short Dec 2013 7 Put --->+$1.25 
----------------------... 
Net Credit --------------------&g...


Selling the Puts to finance the purchase of Calls is one of the most bullish trade.


Break even for such a trade is: $6.075


23 Oct 2013, 01:24 PM


fredje
Could stuff Unemon. Please also have a look at the extremely low call implied volatility and the high implied
volatility on the puts.


I sold puts at high IV strike 4.5 and used the premium to buy lots of calls at 6 at low IV.


Don't know why people are so keen on these warrants, when you can trade the derivatives.

Why would anyone admit to shorting a $6 stock? The maximum profit potential of $6 is hardly worth the effort or
margin requirements. If he/she is lucky it might go to $3, big whoop.

Are you an idiot? $3 is a 50% return for the short! It doesn't matter if its 6 or 60 or 600..its the percentage

I was looking at NBG at about 3.30 but didnt pull the trigger... It has shot up quickly, but really it does scare me a bit....
Could go either way, and has recently done a consolidation which I really dont like...


23 Oct 2013, 03:38 PM


salvatort
Guys, those long at NBG are missing the point. The bank was recapitalized and yes, the risk of it going under is very
low. However, due to the recap, it now has a very high market capitalization. Thus, as the article states, it trades at
very rich valuations. Even during the peak of 2007-08, its market cap was slightly above EUR 20 billion, and now it is
EUR 14 billion. The upside therefore is not huge, and NBG even remotely reaching that level will be a large departure
from fundamentals.

NBG can be double digits, No one will let Greece go down (mainly European coutries that is), so as Greece recovers,
so will NBG. The difference is in a few years (2 to 5) I think Greece will be in the double digits.


They did a 10:1 and so did another company which in 8 months shot from $4 to $82 which was another financial
institution.


NBG has a lot of assets and it can revive itself (already is). 
Just like FNMA which I am heavily invested in, many said it will dissolve and now we are seeing a lot of skepticals
switch sides.


LONG NBG and FNMA


23 Oct 2013, 03:53 PM


Ahmed Amin, Contributor
As the economy recovers, we will see NBG going up slowly but surely, there maybe some surges.


Just as in FNMA (fannie mae), people were very skeptical and there still are some, but slowly they are diminishing.
Their stock price went below a quarter this year and not it is over $2. NBG without a doubt will do the same.

Brent Rawlings CPA
I agree the stock is over valued presently. The 06-30-13 interim financial statements show a post-recapitalization total
stock holders' equity of E7.599 billion. After the reverse split and shares issued in the recapitalization, there are
approximately 2.44 billion shares outstanding. Book value per share is E3.12, or approximately $4.22, using a
currency conversion ratio of E1:$1.35. Most banks in the USA and other countries with economies that have
recovered more than Greece are still trading at a discount, generally around 75%-80% of book value. Why does NBG
command a premium to book value? The present price is around 150% of book value. If Greece's recovery is lagging
the rest of the world, as economists have claimed, it seems the price should be discounted perhaps at least 50%, like
many non-Greek banks were a year ago. With 50% of book value at $2.11, now might be a good time to consider
short positions with the present price around $6.


23 Oct 2013, 03:56 PM


greedoshotlast
As people have pointed out, US retail investors do not have access to warrants. Being that this site is largely geared
towards retail investors, your suggestion is misplaced. The better suggestion for a retail investor trying to capitalize on
the upswing of NBG would be LEAPS options far from the strike.


23 Oct 2013, 04:04 PM


Forever young
The author argues that NBG is a poor buy because individual investors are stupid since they follow the hedge funds.
This is an absurd allegation without any substantiating facts. I have been watching NBG for the past year. I have read
carefully its public disclosures and management discussions. I went in and bought a big chunk at the low 4's recently
and will sit on it until at least a year from now.


Valuation of a bank's balance sheet is subject to the economic environment the bank is in, and it is a subjective
exercise. Given the Greek economy has seen its worst, NBG's balance sheet and valuation should improve next year.
A bank with a good franchise and management team in a country at the cusp of an economic recovery is a good
investment.

This part does make no Sense to me: "While it is true that the bank has meaningful operations in Greece, over half of
its revenue is generated outside Greece and greater than 100% of its profitability comes from Turkey along with a
significant portion of its value"


The author, probably forgot that the Acquisition of the Turkish bank did happen after the Crisis! Pre Crisis, NBG has a
MCap as high as $40b.


if you add the Turkish bank .. you need add another $10b in MCap. That would make NBG a $50b Bank.


If in 5 years Greece economy does recover, NBG Stocks could be valued as high as $22.


with a 20% discount rate .. that would put NBG fair value at $8.80. NBG is everything but overvalued! Of COURSE ...
it's not as attractive as it was 2 months ago!


A short term PPS above 10 could be a chance to take some profit!

Please do your research before writing anything.  
NBG acquired Finansbank in 2006, not after the crisis... And the Mk Cap was around EUR 20B, and now is

Salvator are you looking at the value of the ADR's or are you looking at the total value of NBG? I am asking

WallStreet_Broker
I question your claim of "It is hardly even an investment on a Greek recovery". I agree that investing in some of the
other banks like Piraeus Bank and Alpha Bank will be a decent choice but I don't think they are that much better than
the National Bank of Greece. All of them are an investment on Greek recovery.


In addition, you compared NBG with the metrics of many other banks outside Greece. Do you not see the flaw in your
reasoning here if you're trying to take advantage of the recovery in Greece?


23 Oct 2013, 06:30 PM


Ray Lopez
Good article by XZ, who proves he knows more about Greece than the Greeks themselves (I live there). The Chinese
also are taking a hit investing directly in Greek shipyards at Pireaus, as the Greeks go on strike too much and are not
productive. Greece is full of old people and frankly are past their growth stage IMO, and can only increase their GDP
by allowing more foreigners to live there, which would be good but be unacceptable politically (BTW it's kind of cute
and funny when I run into Chinese in Greece who speak decent Greek, same with Africans). I was waiting for them to
go off the euro so I could make money as a vulture capitalist but that looks increasingly unlikely (for now). Avoid
Greece unless you are an insider like me, or, as XZ implies, you are a speculator looking to make money off of NBG
volatility. As for NBG, it's a fine bank for customers, a bit stodgy (I use Pireaus/Alpha bank, more better), but Greece
has too many banks anyway.


23 Oct 2013, 11:49 PM


liquidminded
What is the saying again?....What seems overvalued and overpriced; goes higher. There is a reason for that, study
the technicals, not the fundamentals, and you'll see NBG is in its infancy of a new bull run.


Forget the fundamentals on this one because all the news and fundamentals is/are horrid at the beginning of a bull
run.

You make some very good points here. NBG shares are a liquidity-driven market with participants exuberantly bidding
the share price above strike price. I understand that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain
solvent but at one point something will have to give. For the time being I would argue that it is best to stay on the
sideline.

Bottom line: If you don't believe the economy of Spain and Greece will turn around you are clueless as to the history

So, what valuation does NBG have in a Greek exit ? when the positive effect from the write-downs end. ( a massive
stimulus, that still can't break even the GDP, at least in the USA the stimulus has created positive GDP, merely by QE
and no write-downs )


25 Oct 2013, 10:30 AM


kesef10
One important fact is missing from the argument in this article. Greek banks are the foundation of the Greek economy.
For Greece to grow out of the recession they need a solid banking system. NBG is one of the largest in Greece and it
will be ready to assume this role. Many US banks in 2008 were considered zombies, but we all know how well they
are doing now. Same lesson for Greek banks.


25 Oct 2013, 10:32 AM


User 12747501
Greece is not the USA. Greece is stuck with one of the strongest currencies in the world, and ZERO chance
to compete with the German Industrial power ( or any similar economy ) and few companies to drive tax
revenue, except shipping firms at the brink of bankruptcy, so Greece continually performs sporadic tax raids,
written into law "on the go", like bandits from the "wild west". Then, you have a downturn in 50% of the EU,
also effecting tourists. In all this, Greece has to rely on the whims of the German socialist government, for
hand-outs. ( write-downs, interest at 1%, even if it should be at +15% ) A German government, that was
persuaded by the Russians to "out-law" future investments in nuclear power plants, to become even more
dependent on Russian exports, of coal based energy. My question is, how can Greece come out "on top", in
this deadly hierarchy. Greece doesn't have a central bank, or any means to stimulate, and still being stuck in
one of the worst depressions in the history of modern civilization. Greece can not afford public TV and radio.
Half of the domestic journalists, have worked with zero pay, for years. The largest radio station in Greece,
can't afford to pay it's telephone bill, so they have to conduct interviews from "skype" and similar free
services, with internet connections that are donated by someones Grandmother ! The country is occupied. I
mean, you might as well buy stock in Palestinian banks. You guys have a wild imagination, and a positive
sense of freedom, but most of you are probably born in the States, and live there. Greece doesn't have a
basic freedom, so it doesn't matter if EU donates 10.000 billion Euros to Greece, it will still be controlled and
corrupted. I have traded NBG, and avoided losing money. In the long run though, Greece is doomed under
the current order. There is an exit coming, or a make-over ( once again, ad infinitum )

HELLO Zhou! 
Slamming NGB when you are shorting the stock makes sense. You want the stock to go down... 
However, having a sizable chunk of NGB's market being in another country, Turkey and others, is a nice hedge
against the bottom falling out. Hence, NGB is GOOD buy. If in five years it only goes to $20.00, then 350+% is an
amazing return. 
Go Long NGB. Go long.

as soon as bank profits will rise ... and they will ... they will reinvest the profit in the economy ... and more GDP rise
will occur. Furthermore banks are now largely owned by governments and they want the stock to rise ... and rise ...
and rise ... and rise ...

When an economy improves the banks are a great hold. They almost always increase in value before the other
stocks. The other sectors follow the banks since the banks are directly affected.


Unless Greece gets wiped off the map the banks will be fine in the long run as long as they are well capitalized.


Strong performance by Fininsbank (Turkey) with profits up by 23% on constant currency basis is dramatically
stabilizing NBG and is making net profit possible. If it wasn't their subsidiary in Turkey they would have needed a
huge amount of cash infusions to be able to survive.


NBG reminds me of Citigroup. Everyone was counting them out and now look at them.

-Book value should not be overly relied upon, while it looks convincing in the chart provided let's remember that it's a
very subjective valuation and Greece is a very special case given the enormous recession it has been in. The idea is
to buy into the stock in the *anticipation* that the banks valuation will rise in the future to *meet* and *exceed* the
buy-in price. Given how far Greece has fallen, the idea is that there is a *lot* of growth room there to regain. 
-Alpha and NBG are both very good investments right now, Alpha is the better one but NBG is fine for those who
prefer a company that is easier to research, both will be worth a lot for those patient with a 5-10 year holding period.
Why do I say this? 
-Research OIL and GOLD, in relation to Greece, the information isn't easily obtainable but if you dig you can find it.
Greece is sitting on enormous amounts of oil and gold -- there are hurdles to be overcome (environmentalists, Turkish
territorial disputes, etc), but the United Arab Emirates is formalizing an agreement for investment relations with
Greece with the plan to develop the vast oil reserves. Furthermore, Brussels/USA are both eager to turn Greece into
a major pipeline route for Europe to undercut Russia's energy dominance in the region. Further, China is investing
heavily into Greek shipping/ports in a bid to turn Greece into the port of entry for Chinese goods into the European
market. There's a lot more positive outlook there, these are the biggest gems, do your research and be wary of shorts
quoting Buffet in an attempt to incite panic.. no offence to the author of this article, please don't stifle my freedom of
speech again by deleting my post! Fair and equal discourse from opposing points of view is important if you want to

According to PwC, NPLs at Greek banks are more than EUR 65 billion, approximately 30% of total loans. Currently
loan loss reserves at Greek banks are appx. 10% of their total loans.


Book values are going down. Banks have enough capital to withstand write-downs, but they are expensive right now.


31 Oct 2013, 10:32 AM


Justin Grant, Contributor
See: Piraeus, NBG to set up 'bad banks'. Also, those NPLs can be sold and will be worth an okay price in Jan
2014 when the government allows evictions to take place again. This last will further allow more aggressive
mortgage loaning as there will not be a STICK by which to penalize those who do not pay. Greece and Greek
stocks are not overnight wunderkinds, they are for those investing at the Macro level with a long-term horizon.
This is the sort of investment you can throw $1k on, forget about, remember it in 10 years, look and notice
you're now sitting on 10 or 100 times what you paid for it.


31 Oct 2013, 09:50 PM

Setting up bad banks reduces risk, but will also reduce book value of equity. NBG already trades at a high multiple
compared to peers, which in that case would increase even further.


Also, it has regained most of its market capitalization, even though that is not reflected in the stock price due to the
huge dilution. You have to analyze how much the company is worth, then look at the shares. Do you really believe
that in 10 years NBG would have a market cap of EUR 140 billion? I'm sure you don't.


01 Nov 2013, 11:26 AM


Justin Grant, Contributor
It's amazing how no one on here responds to this critique. I can include myself in that list. I've finally managed
to track down all historical data on this bank, factored in eventual warrant exercise (held by HFSF), and the
results aren't pretty.


I'm amazed to find that there is only 20 - 30% movement potential to reach back to pre-recession valuations
(based on market cap).


Some things to keep in mind, market consolidation has taken place in Greece in a big way, I believe I have
read that 11 banks have closed/been acquired. Leaving the remaining four Efficiency seems to be on the
increase as well, mass staff layoffs and branch closures.


Anyone invested in this bank should really consider whether a 20 - 30% potential increase over what may be
a period of ten years or more before Greece even approaches back to 2007 levels, is a good investment.

Justin Grant, Contributor
One thing I will give to this article, it really does show the case for investing in the other Greek banks over NBG. I
think the truth is exactly what this article exposes, the Paulson article proves that people only read the headline and
are careless with their investments. The article clearly states (as this article mentions) that Paulson is in Alpha and
Piraeus, not NBG. The majority of the recent surge was off of that headline -- a false surge, essentially.


I think the real hidden value is still Alpha. It's not received the same amount of attention as NBG, it's the healthiest
Greek bank (has been for many decades according to some obscure Greek text studies I've read dating back to
2002). Something also to consider with Alpha is that currently it's the smallest of the 'big four' Greek banks. Being
healthiest and smallest makes it a potential acquisition for another bank. In 2011 NBG attempted just such a takeover,
offering a very hefty 30% (if memory serves) premium for Alpha shareholders. Alpha rejected the offer saying it wasn't
good enough, they wanted to wait until they were trading closer to book value to really get the most out of any such
deal. There's a lot of big money players who are in Alpha and are not averse to the right deal being struck, and
Greece frankly is not a large enough country economically or population wise to support 4 banks. Expect a merger,
and expect Alpha bank to profit most handsomely. Also be sure that Alpha is currently undervalued vs NBG owing to it
being harder to research, harder to invest in (penny stock OTC), and the average investor jumping on the NBG
bandwagon without knowing exactly what they're doing.

I lost some money on NBG when they made that horrible split dilution play back in may. but even then i realized there
was a story here and i just didnt have the opportunity to go long. I recently picked up some JAN 2016 at a $7 strike.
its a relatively safe bet considering each contract only costs me $50 to control the upside on 100 shares which would
cost 10 times to buy the shares outright. the way i see it i'm going to lose that money or i am going to make a profit of
over 3,000% for such little outlay thats a risk i cannot afford not to take.

Israeli diamond billionaire to gain stake in Greek real estate!


Private equity firm Invel Real Estate, together with Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz’s BGS Real Estate and other
investors, is close to buying a majority stake in Greek real estate company Pangaia, two bankers close to the deal
told Reuters.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1763442-why-owning-national-bank-of-greece-common-stock-is-an-awful-decision 30/33


The stake is currently owned by National Bank of Greece, the country's largest lender. “The agreement will close in
the next 10 days. Invel will acquire about 66 percent of Pangaia for more than 600 million euros [$808 million],” one of
the bankers said.


Invel will pay part of the purchase price in cash, contribute equity in the form of real estate and finance the rest with a
loan from National Bank, the bankers said. Dutch-based Invel was set up in March to take advantage of opportunities
in the European real estate market by offering investors the ability to co-invest in deals.


Steinmetz, whose BSG Real Estate will be one of the co-investors in Pangaia , is best known in Israel as a diamond
miner and trader.


“NBG will retain management control at Pangaia for five years,” one of the bankers said. “The loan by NBG for part of
the majority stake will be at a spread of 275 basis points, secured by real estate contributed by Invel.”


Pangaia’s real estate portfolio includes office buildings, branches operated by National Bank and other property
recently acquired from the country’s privatization agency. Pangaia may pursue a listing on the Athens stock exchange
by 2015, one of the bankers said.


The agreement has been approved by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, the bank rescue vehicle that recapitalized
the country’s big four banks in the summer and is now their major shareholder, one of the bankers said.


Last month, Canadian firm Fairfax Financial Holdings announced its intention to raise its stake in Greek real estate
firm Eurobank Properties.

While I may agree or disagree with the content and statistics it doesn't really matter. 
The stock will sky rocket in 2014 and probably continue to up trend later on. There will be a few falls that will allow
more speculators (not investors) to get back in.


Why is that? It's all because the name of the stock - National Bank of GREECE. Greece can only produce good news.
Everything bad is already in the price. It doesn't matter if National Bank of Greece sells ice-cream in Bangladesh. The
minute good news will appear about the Greek recovery, speculators will flock into the stock buying at whatever price,
thinking that the stock represent the national bank of Greece. Does it matter to them that most of the business is
actually in Southern Europe and Turkey? no. The name is Greece. Not Turkey.... Most will hardly put a second in
checking that. 
I'm in, because of that reason, and because of 4 more reasons (Technical setup provides good risk-reward if you use
OPTIONS and LEAPS, most agencies are with hold or sell rating - so there's only one way and it's up (see Moody's
last month), May's performance during last few years, Greece recovery (Again, the name is enough for me).  
I'm speculating (again, not investing) only with what I'm willing to lose, but I believe there's a strong opportunity here
to make profits based on people not checking what they are buying. Simple.


Want more proof that it can work? see Tesla, Amazon, CRM, etc. prices. Soon Twitter will join the club. and FB...
ridiculous but people are buying.


Seinfeld once said that helmet was invented to protect people from their head cracking activities and life style. Instead
of stopping the head cracking activity (which could be the smart move) they invented helmet. And he added - there is
even a more stupid law that enforces helmet wearing to protect people who are not smart enough to wear a helmet :-) 
-- 
I say when people are not checking things all the way (and I'm in the same club I guess) - look for these kind of set
ups. Won't hurt much.


Good luck.

"Greece", I'm betting on the volatility of a penny stock on the pink sheets.. either way, they could both take off
and fundamentals dont mean much in that scenario. Just take a look at AIBYY, the second largest Irish bank,
trading with a market cap the size of DeutscheBank.. no logic to the valuation, trading at about 4 times its
book value, but being a penny stock on the OTC means it's become completely unhinged from its
fundamentals, while the larger Irish bank IRE trading on the NYSE is trading at around 1 p/b.

My only disagreement is this. In Feb 09' the American market was one that nobody wanted to touch. But your
technical you mentioned said otherwise. The same is true with the Greek market. ALBKY, NBG, HLTOY and
several Greek Shipping stocks. Its cyclical. Period. Even the dreaded silver and gold stocks along with their
ugly cousins the mining stocks are looking pretty sexy right now. HL, PAAS, SLW..etc. Fundamentals look like
garbage at the bottom but tend to improve on the way up...hence Greece!! I'm long NBG, ESEA,ALBKY,TNK,

Since when is Greece growing? Dudes, stop investing based on the name Greece and look at the fundamentals.
Greece is still in a recession, its GDP is 25% below its peak, it primary surplus is based on questionable accounting
methods, and NGB already has a market capitalization of EUR 10 billion (compared to its 20-22 bln peak).

Everybody ran from the American Markets in Feb 09'. Greece has a low CAPE ratio and great technical.
