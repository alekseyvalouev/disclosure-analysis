Vipshop: More Indications Of Misrepresentation
May 29, 2015 7:30 AM ET81 comments
by: Mithra Forensic Research


Summary


VIPS has indicated on calls with investors that analysts misunderstood their sales
figures for Lefeng; we have found additional information which suggests that VIPS
continues to misrepresent Lefeng's revenues.


Significant and growing losses at Lefeng and Ovation are likely driven by VIPS
pushing Operating Expenses onto them.


CFO Yang failed to disclose an ongoing Directorship at Synutra; he also provides a
graduation date from Nakai University in SEC filings that differs from that on HBS
Alumni website.


Mithra is not associated or affiliated with J Capital or any hedge funds; we ask that
analysts, VIPS and the media focus on the issues in the report and update.


We reiterate our call for Strong Sell on VIPS with a target of $2.75.


Recommendation


Mithra Forensic Research initiated coverage on Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) with a
Strong Sell rating on May 12, 2015. Since that time, a number of commentators and
researchers have provided opinion, alternate views and other insights, but we have seen
no evidence or additional information that refutes, contradicts or explains the myriad of
serious and disturbing anomalies Mithra identified in VIPS' financial statements.


In fact, we have uncovered additional information which supports our belief that VIPS is
significantly manipulating and misrepresenting its accounts. We therefore reiterate our
Strong Sell rating with a target price of $2.75.


1.0 VIPS misrepresented revenues at Lefeng by at least $250M


In our original report published on Seeking Alpha here, we called attention to the fact that
VIPS had misrepresented to equity analysts and the media the amount of revenues
generated by a recently acquired company, Lefeng. We are aware of the fact that Lefeng
was restructured prior to the sale, but VIPS' disclosures state that Lefeng was a wholly-

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 2/31


owned subsidiary of Ovation and that the primary changes during the restructure were
movements of domains, employees and some liabilities, so we expect revenues post-
restructuring to be broadly in line with those pre-restructuring.


1.1 Revenues, less than $65M or more than $315M?


In its 2014, 20-F, VIPS announced that Chinese government notification requirements for
M&A transactions are triggered when both Chinese companies involved in a transaction
have revenues in excess of $65.1M. According to VIPS, revenues from Lefeng, which
solely operates in China, were less than $65.1M threshold and thus exempted from the
reporting requirement:


We believe that the turnover of acquired business of Lefeng in 2013 is less than
RMB400 million (US$65.1 million) within China and have not sought clearance from
the Ministry of Commerce, but we cannot assure you that the Ministry of Commerce
will not take a view contrary to ours.


Yet in a report dated July 7, 2014, Standard Chartered analysts Wendy Huang and Betty
Dai, reported that Lefeng had net GMV of RMB 3,000, principal GMV of RMB 1,500 and a
net loss of RMB 150. They cited the source of this information as "Companies".


It is our belief that since this information was reported in a July 2014 report, the financial
data would have been provided to the analysts by VIPS management, not the prior Lefeng
management as the Lefeng acquisition was finalized in February 2014.


Also, we believe that since Lefeng had been a private company prior to the acquisition,
detailed information such as net GMV, principal GMV, net loss and margin would have
been provided by management, as it is not likely to be widely accessible in the public
domain.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 3/31


Standard Chartered Research, "China: Internet E-commerce in Transformation", p. 83.


The figures in the table suggest that Lefeng had revenues of around $315M in 2013
[Principal GMV + (Marketplace GMV * 25%)]. VIPS reported that it paid consideration of
$132M for 75% of Lefeng, which implies a company valuation of $177M. If Lefeng had
revenues of $315M, then VIPS acquired Lefeng cheaply at a Price-to-Sales ratio of 0.56
times. A number of media outlets reported that Lefeng would report $149M in 2014
revenues and then determined that VIPS paid a reasonable Price-to-Sales ratio of 1.2
times, since VIPS was trading at 2.37 times its sales in February 2014.


1.2 Blame it on the Analysts


We have heard from one source who was invited to attend a call with VIPS management
after the release of our report. Our source indicated that when the topic of the revenues at
Lefeng was broached, VIPS stated:


1. that they believe that they had paid a fair price for the asset, and
2. that the reporters and the Standard Chartered analysts probably misunderstood the


figures that they discussed at the time of the July 2014 report.


With respect to valuation, our concern has never been related to valuation. Our concern
has always been that the company has misrepresented the size of the acquisition. Our
belief is that VIPS, like other Asian companies with these sorts of issues before it, is
seeking excuses to immediately spend large amounts of cash which can be funneled to
Related Parties as a source of funds for fake sales.


We are inclined to believe that the media mistakenly pulled the $149M in sales from the
press release announcing the purchase and supply framework agreement totaling $149M;
it relates to the minimum level of Ovation revenues expected post the sale of Lefeng.


However, we believe that the Standard Chartered analysts were supplied with the $315M
figure by VIPS management and they did not, in fact, misunderstand management's
conversation. We attempted to reach Ms. Huang and Ms. Dai, but they are no longer
employed by Standard Chartered and current contact information was not available.


1.3 Not the first time we have seen this number


Ideally, we would love to hear the analysts' response to VIPS' claims, but we found
additional support for our view that the Standard Chartered revenue numbers are correct.
Just four months before the sale of Lefeng to VIPS, a senior executive of Lefeng was

featured in a 4-page testimonial for Dell Technology. Details about Lefeng were
highlighted throughout the brochure. One especially noteworthy sentence discusses
Lefeng's 2012 revenues of $310M. See circled text below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 6/31


VIPS management misrepresented to the market that Lefeng was a $315M revenue
company, when, in fact, Lefeng generates revenue of no more than $65M. VIPS
clearly overpaid for the asset and likely used the transaction as a means to divert
funds to related parties.


2.0 VIPS is likely pushing significant amounts of Operating Expenses Off Balance
Sheet


Misrepresenting revenue at Lefeng is only part of the manipulation of recent trends in
profitability - or more accurately - loss, suggest that costs allocated to Lefeng and possibly
Ovation have ramped up substantially and it is our view these additional costs reflect an
over-allocation of operating expenses to Lefeng and Ovation.


We used figures reported by Standard Chartered for Lefeng's 2013 loss; profit/losses
information for Ovation in 2013 have not been disclosed. For 2014, and 2015E losses, we
relied upon data reported in the respective Income Statements to derive losses:


1. "Share of Loss at Affiliates" which is predominantly Ovation was divided by 23% to
calculate total loss at Ovation;


2. "Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests" which relates to Lefeng, was divided by
25% to derive the total loss at Lefeng.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 7/31


It is clear from this chart that Losses at Lefeng have grown dramatically since 2013. While
we have no data on Ovation's profitability/losses in 2013, it is clear that losses here are
growing as well based upon 2014 actual and 1Q 2015 annualized data.


2.1 Where is the money going?


VIPS would argue that it is necessary to spend significant amounts to develop the
businesses, but both companies have been operational for some time and the magnitude
of the cost increases suggests that expenses relate to more than just building up the
businesses. If VIPS is to be believed, Lefeng, per company disclosure, is a company with
less than $65M in revenue. Does it make sense to incur losses of $133M (2014 and
2015E) on an established business with less than $65M in revenues.


We believe that VIPS is using a bit of accounting gimmickery at Lefeng and Ovation so
that it can keep the listed entity outperforming analysts' expectations. VIPS directly owns
75% of Lefeng, and as such, VIPS consolidates Lefeng's financials with its own. VIPS
subtracts the portion that relates to the Non-Controlling Interest (Ovation's share of
Lefeng) from its Income Statement. VIPS owns only 23% of Ovation and consequently
does not consolidate Ovation's figures. It does, however, get to record its non-controlling
interest in profits and losses in Ovation on its income statement. Hence every dollar of
profit at Lefeng, results in $0.75 profit at VIPS and every dollar of profit at Ovation, results
in $0.23 at VIPS.


But presently Lefeng and Ovation are reporting losses. If VIPS wanted to push costs off of
the listed company's income statement, it could over-allocate costs to Lefeng and Ovation.
Of course, the bigger benefit will be when VIPS pushes costs onto Ovation as VIPS only
records $0.23 in loss for every additional $1.00 of loss at Lefeng.


2.2 Off-Balance Sheet Expenses at Work-Fulfillment


Based upon the calculations we discussed above, the total losses and entity
apportionment of losses would be as follows:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/29/saupload_VIPS_New_3.jpg
5/21/2018 Vipshop: More Indications Of Misrepresentation - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 8/31


The losses that are attributable to VIPS will remain on VIPS' reported financials. Only 23%
of the losses at Ovation will show up on VIPS' income statement. If we assume that in
2014 Ovation reported only those revenues that VIPS guaranteed to transact totaling
$149M, then we can use the revenue and reported loss to derive expenses at Ovation in
2014 of $205M ($149M +$55.7M). Similarly expenses at Ovation in 2015 would
approximate $216M using the same assumption.


It is our view that VIPS is using these off-balance sheet maneuvers to show continued
decreases in its Operating Expenses. Based upon our estimates, VIPS' fulfillment
expenses in 2013 and 2014 accounted for 11.6% and 9.8% of revenues, respectively. For
VIPS to achieve the decrease in fulfilment expenses as a percent of revenues that it
reports, it would only have needed to allocate an additional $40M in fulfillment expense to
Ovation. The rate of the increases in the losses and the magnitude of loss at both Lefeng
and Ovation suggest that it is likely that VIPS is transferring operating expenses to
Ovation.


Losses at Lefeng and Ovation have increased dramatically over the last two years.
The losses at Lefeng are nearly 3x what they were prior to the acquisition. We
believe, VIPS may be pushing Operating Expenses, such as Fulfillment costs, onto
investee companies.


3.0 CFO Donghao Yang had not revealed a directorship at Synutra International


While foreign private issuers as defined by the SEC, are not subject to all of the proxy
rules that US firms are, we found it odd that VIPS' CFO Donghao Yang has failed to
mention his Directorship at Synutra International at all in VIPS' filings.


Various members of the VIPS' board reference specific current or past directorships, but
as part of his VIPS filings, Yang has not. Yang has mentioned that he was, prior to his
tenure at VIPS, CFO of Synutra and had worked in that role from June 2010 to September
2011. However, immediately upon resigning from Synutra, Yang assumed the role of a
Director on Synutra's Board and served on Synutra's audit committee until last year.


Synutra which manufactures and distributes baby formula has survived two tainted
product scandals - melamine (2008) and breast development in infant girls (2010). The
company's share price during Yang's tenure dropped from around $20 to $4 a share as a
result of these scandals. When Yang resigned as CFO in 2011, Synutra failed to appoint a
new CFO and was forced to report a material deficiency in its 2012 financial statements.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 9/31


Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd., our independent registered public accounting
firm, also expressed an adverse opinion in its attestation report on our internal control
over financial reporting because of this material weakness.


Yang continues to serve on the Board of Synutra. Our concern here is not around Yang's
qualifications or professional judgment, but more around yet another instance of coziness
between VIPS and its auditors, Deloitte & Touche. In our earlier report we expressed
concerns about Deloitte, not only because it had failed to identify large recent frauds at its
clients Longtop Financial and China MediaExpress, but also because Deloitte seemed to
be conflicted in its role as auditor and advisor to multiple entities negotiating acquisition
terms. We believe that the VIPS/Yang relationship is so important to Deloitte Touche that
the auditor's independence could be an issue of genuine concern.


Donghao Yang as CFO of Synutra was a client of Deloitte;
Donghao Yang as Audit Committee member of Synutra frequently interacted with
Deloitte;
Deloitte served as auditor to Lefeng, Ovation and VIPS prior to the investments
completed in February 2014 - all companies where Donghao Yang serves on the
Board;
Deloitte continues to serve as auditor to VIPS and conducts the assessment of internal
controls.


Our analysis shows that Deloitte has earned $8.7 million in fees from just VIPS and
Synutra over the last 4 years.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 10/31


It would not be too far-fetched to speculate that if there are areas of concern or contention
over the financials (say, with respect to accounting for revenue gross versus net or
acquisition terms), Deloitte would be especially keen to give Yan the benefit of the doubt
when disagreements on accounting principles and estimates arose.


3.1 Donghao Yang's graduation year from Nankai University as reported in SEC
filings for Synutra and VIPS shows a date of 1993, whereas his Harvard Business
School Alumni page, updated in 2013, shows a date of 1989


We are not sure why, but Yang has very consistently reported a graduation date from
Nankai University in 1993. See biographical entries from FY 2014 20-F's for VIPS:


Mr. Donghao Yang has served as our chief financial officer since August 2011. Mr.
Yang has held senior executive and managerial positions in various public and private
companies, including serving as the chief finance officer of Synutra International Inc.
(NASDAQ: SYUT) from May 2010 to August 2011, as the chief financial officer of
Greater China of Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) from March 2007 to April 2010, as a
finance director of Asia Pacific of Valmont Industries, Inc. (NYSE: VMI) from October
2003 to March 2007, and as a director of China Minmetals Brazil Holding Limited from
January 1999 to April 2001. Mr. Yang received an MBA degree from Harvard Business
School in 2003 and a bachelor's degree in international economics from Nankai
University in 1993.


Here is the Harvard entry with personal details redacted. We note that undergraduate
information is self-reported, but we are perplexed as to why Yang notes 1989 as a
graduation date here.

4.0 We have heard from a source in contact with suppliers that VIPS must get
approval from suppliers for any price changes on goods; this is further evidence of
a true agency arrangement and further confirms our view that VIPS should be
reporting Net Revenues, not Gross Revenues.


We do not typically contact suppliers or sources for our reports, but as part of our
research, a source reached out to us to inform us that VIPS does indeed need to follow
supplier guidance on pricing. We highlighted in our report of May 12, 2015, that there are
a number of key determinants that need to be assessed before applying Gross Revenue
reporting. If VIPS is indeed, getting direction on pricing from suppliers, this would support
our argument that VIPS should be reporting Net Revenues. Other determinants arguing
for Net Revenues include the fact that VIPS:


Does not have General inventory risk;
Does not change the products;
Cannot substitute suppliers once a customer has purchased a product;
Is not involved in determining product specifications;
And has no credit risk.


Professor Paul Gillis who authors the China Accounting Blog wrote an article that can be
found on Seeking Alpha here and on his website here. His article is a good summation of
the key issues and while he concludes the article with the suggestion that time will tell, he
goes a step further in the comment section of his blog. Gillis suggests that if the SEC
reviews this matter, Mithra's argument is more than likely to prevail:


The SEC reads this blog, and I expect they will be probing further into the arguments
the company makes for gross. If they decide to look at the issue, I'd bet 70/30 they go
for net.


5.0 Mithra is an independent research company; we have no association with J
Capital or any hedge funds.


There has been considerable energy expended over the last few weeks spent on trying to
understand the relationship between Mithra Forensic to J Capital or to various hedge
funds. Let me make it absolutely clear that Mithra Forensic Research is not affiliated with,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3221136-vipshop-more-indications-of-misrepresentation 13/31


owned by or acting on behalf of J Capital or any hedge fund. Our research is supported by
our own analysis and relies solely upon VIPS' own reported financial statement data.


5.1 The timing of the release of the Mithra and J Capital reports is a coincidence.


We identified VIPS as a potential manipulator based upon its 6-K filing in February 2015.
However, we decided to wait for additional clarifying information which we expected would
be provided in the more comprehensive 20-F. VIPS released its completed annual
statements on April 24, 2015. Unsurprisingly, VIPS' 20-F provided little clarification; in fact,
it contained disclosures that gave us even greater concerns about the integrity of VIPS'
accounts. We spent the subsequent two weeks completing our report and issued our
findings as soon as we could. The fact that our report and the J Capital report were issued
within days of each other is sheer coincidence. I would therefore encourage investors to
evaluate the content of both reports and conduct their own due diligence of the issues
raised in each report.


5.2 Where is the Diligence?


When we issued the May 12th report, the Wall Street Journal capitulated immediately,
stating that this is "all too difficult for retail investors to parse", while other media
commentators spent their time investigating Mithra or trying to find evidence of a non-
existent conspiracy. Not one equity analyst on the earnings call that was held one day
after our report was released raised a single question regarding any of the detailed
findings in the Mithra report, despite the fact that the report is solely focused on the
detailed and complex financial and accounting issues which we would expect them to
understand and interrogate. Each of the analysts was provided copies of our report via
email at least one day prior to the call. Over the last several days, most equity analysts
have piled on with reiterated buy ratings on the basis of comfort provided by VIPS in one-
on-one meetings with the analysts. VIPS's response has been to regurgitate much of its
previously disclosed and woefully inadequate accounting policies pablum.


5.3 Mithra's Objectives


As we disclose in our profile and on our website, we have conviction in our research and
take positions in advance of releasing our reports. Clearly one of our key objectives is to
make a return on our investment. In that regard, we are no different than anyone else in
the market - short or long. But the return is not our only objective.

Comments (81)


Our quantitative models and qualitative research suggest that VIPS is a large-scale
financial statement manipulator. We sincerely believe that misrepresentation and fraud
should be rooted out of the financial markets, so we intend to pursue this campaign until
we have evidence that suggests VIPS is not manipulating or misrepresenting its results.


It is our sincere hope, that the additional findings contained in this update receive the
consideration, analytical rigor and challenge that they deserve, not for Mithra's benefit but
for the benefit of the people whose savings and pensions are being diverted to this
seemingly unrivaled company.


In the end, VIPS, the analysts, the media and investors may well decide that they do not
agree with our findings. We are OK with that. But we do ask that they discuss, debate,
support, refute, or challenge the issues. Rigorous due diligence conducted by the various
market participants is the least investors deserve, particularly given the fact that VIPS is a
$15B NYSE-listed company, with virtually all of its operations, majority shareholders and
management team in China - a country where the regulatory, audit and legal frameworks
provide little redress to non-Chinese victims of fraud as recent history can attest.

With all due respect, accusing CFO's graduation date mismatch seems to be a desperate move. Clearly the price
hasn't gone in the way short expected. Lefeng is never a important part to the growth thesis on the name. Every
single analyst knows that particular business is loss making yet strategically important for category expansion. Cross
checking with other internet names, opex has almost all piled up relatively to revenue growth amid rather tough
competition and user acquisition. Again, this is another example of rather shallow speculation over Chinese names.
Any doubters on the internet sector development within China need to really get a perspective, and perhaps, visit the
country some time.

My understanding is GeoInvesting report is against what mentioned in JCapital report. It doesn't have much
value to Mithra's report.

One trivial comment is that Chinese people tend to put their starting year of college instead of graduation year. But
nice job in exposing the intricate ties between its CFO and other related companies.


To me, one lingering question is how VIPS is lowing its expenses down at a much faster rate than any other
competitors despite having similar economies of scale from revenue expansion. I think this has led to speculations
that VIPS may be shifting some expenses to the logistics company they invested. I think this is more likely than
shifting to Ovation.


If VIPS has close ties with those logistics company or those logistics companies mainly serve VIPS, it is possible that
the shipping/fulfillment costs are reported at a much lower rate.


Wall Street analysts never dig deep into their filings and accounting statement because they simply don't have the
time.


I am also wondering whether companies can provide material new information in one-on-one meetings with the
analysts under reg FD? This is just a general question for all companies. Thanks!

VIPS indeed invested in many local delivery service providers over the past few years. If you break down
fulfillment cost further, you will see per order delivery cost dropping quite significantly mostly due to scale and
delivery carrier investment (VIPS does disclose, not like most other ecommerce players, the breakdown of
delivery cost and other non-delivery fulfillment cost in quarterly result). Mgmt specifically emphasis that
currently over 70% of the orders are already delivered by invested delivery partners and such number should
reach 80% by the end of this year, bringing further upside to the operating margin.


The drag on OP margin last year mostly comes from marketing and to a less extent, research expense. As
someone who lives in China, I definitely saw more display ads, either printed or online, from VIPS since last
year, and the number seems to be allying to what I observed.


It's easy to just attribute a seemingly abnormal financial figure to "related-party transaction" especially when
the overall Chinese internet names are surrounded by the undeniable pessimistic sentiment (can't believe
people even questioning BABA as a fraud, jez). Unfortunately many investors do not have the chance to see
the operation by themselves, and it gives space for shorts to speculate. To me, Mithra's allegations just
seems to be another piece of well-articulated but poorly-supported college essays, and I prefer to trust my
own eyes and analysis with my money.

It's great to hear from someone living in China. My perspectives come from another developing nation with
over 1.2B population (India) which I visit often. The changes happening are so dramatic, a population that had
less than 1% land line phone connections going to over 100% mobile connections in a short span. And fast
becoming a nation with many leading eCommerce players with market caps (private) commanding over $10B!


Unfortunately people in the US who don't travel much can't appreciate the transformations across the oceans
apart.

I travel to Asia and China 7-8 times a year on business and I totally agree with your observation. People here
fail to see that China with 1.4 billion people and nearly 1 billion online (China Mobil alone has close to 600
million subscribers), estimated 500 million middle class and currently only about 300 million shop online, so
the potential is enormous. The big 3 e-commerce sites are BABA, JD and VIPS, they are the dominate
players in that fast growing sector. These companies true value are discounted because they are Chinese
companies (there were some shady first gen Chinese companies) and people assume the communist
government is irrational and anti-business.

This author is so clueless, I could not help pick some shares for swing trade today .. Nice job for the opportunity. Now
wait for the stock to rebound sharply as these allegations can only come from someone clueless on industry.


Why would VIPS guarantee only $149M if the sales were already $315M (Are you sure 315M was not in RMB?). How
could $315M revenue generating company sell for so less (check JMEI's multi billion dollar valuation for comparable)


As to losses attributed to "non-controlled interests" it was $4.27M in Q1. At 4x that it amounts to $17M or a mere 1.5
cents on EPADS approximately. That still leaves Q1 with a beat on original analyst estimates. Even assuming your
hallucinations are true (which nobody seems to believe), it is INSIGNIFICANT on the bottom line or top line for a
$1.4B revenue (Gross) company!


Your character assassination on Harvard Grad CFO shows your true colors. It is uncalled for and completely
unprofessional. I thought you were better than that (oh boy you're throwing yourself under a bus)


On a side note - listen to DANG conference call yesterday. Peggy Yu Yu, Chairwoman of DANGDANG answered a
question from an analyst in which she states "Yes. I see the other ecommerce company such as [V Shop] [ph] and
Jingdong have higher growth rates. And I admire them for their achievements" per the transcripts on SA. Its a rare

Author’s reply »  I referenced it as a comment to the original article, but can add it here as well.


Geo Investing only addresses 1 (Gross vs. Net) of the 10 items that our report detailed. In fact, Geo Investing actually
compliments Mithra's work and defers to Paul Gillis' article for a view on Gross vs Net. It should be noted that the
Professor also posted his article on his blog and stated in the comments section that in his opinion, should the SEC
look at the Gross/ Net question at VIPS, the SEC would agree with Mithra. Gillis put the odds at 70/30 in Mithra's
favor.

I have a problem with this point: since VIPS is the majority owner for Lefeng, all expenses are consolidated already
into VIPS' numbers, and at the end they deduct whatever losses are due to the non-controlling interests to arrive at
net income attributable to VIPS shareholders. The argument here that VIPS shifted expenses to Lefeng seem to
indicate that the author misunderstood accounting 101?


On the other hand, if VIPS didn't do the acquisition to grow to this new category, their net income would be $16M
(4*$4.27M) higher. It seems to me the core business is doing really well.


29 May 2015, 03:17 PM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I address this above. With respect to Lefeng, 25% of its losses will go to Ovation as Non-
Controlling Interest; a total of 77% of losses at Ovation will remain at Ovation. Hence, by pushing expenses
onto both of these companies, VIPS is able to get the benefit of not having to report 100% of these expenses
on its books. The greater benefit comes from shifting expenses to Ovation directly, but even expenses shifted
to Lefeng result in 25% of it going to Ovation in the form non-controlling interest.


30 May 2015, 12:59 PM


Retired Securities Attorney, Contributor
Mithra,


This is a much more significant allegation than the gross vs net argument. Unfortunately, by its nature, one
cannot find direct evidence to shifting operating expenses to a partly owned consolidated subsidiary.


30 May 2015, 01:47 PM


stockplaza
I have addressed this above too. Even assuming your accusations are true, they amount to nothing
significant. So in the worst case, it is a meow, meow insignificant amount as explained above. In the best
case scenario (which I believe), Lefeng / Ovation was very smart move by the management and are worth a
lot more now than what VIPS paid for them!


I wish Ovation / Lefeng are sold by VIPS at much higher valuation than what they paid to put your garbage to
an end

Retired Securities Attorney, Contributor
stockplaza,


>>So in the worst case, it is a meow, meow insignificant amount as explained above.<<


You are missing the point. In the worser (not the worst) case scenario, VIPS has shifted an arbitrary amount
of cost from their income statement to limbo and is showing profits that do not exist.


Suppose I have 100 million in gross before operating expense of 110 million. I lost 10 million. But just let me
shift 20 million of that 110 million in operating expenses to an unconsolidated subsidiary, and presto/chango,
now I have 10 million in profit. The numbers are arbitrary. For a small amount, it wouldn't be noticeable. If you
think nobody is capable of reading a financial statement, however, or if you think no one will notice, make it
more. At some point the numbers on the combined financial statements no longer make sense when read
together, if you shift too many operating expense dollars.


In my opinion, which I use in making my own investments, these numbers do not make sense as a coherent
whole. I am not saying that anyone else should use my opinion in making their investments. Each one should
use his/her own.


30 May 2015, 05:13 PM

RSA - Except in the case of VIPS Q1 statement, a total of only $4.274 was attributed to "non-controlled". This
is out of 1.4B revenues and $83.5M profits in the quarter. The amount attributed to "non-controlled" is
insignificant. Read my comment above to see how insignificant it is even assuming worse case accusation of
Mithra.


I do believe Ovation / Lefeng acquisition was strategic that helped VIPS to take on $3.5B valued JMEI and if
Lefeng/Ovation are to be sold, VIPS will get "multiples" of its original investment. It is almost like FB spending
1B on Instagram which raised many eyebrows but proved to be very valuable (as much as $35B by some
estimates) to FB! You get the point!

"5.2 Where is the Diligence?


When we issued the May 12th report, the Wall Street Journal capitulated immediately, stating that this is "all too
difficult for retail investors to parse", while other media commentators spent their time investigating Mithra or trying to
find evidence of a non-existent conspiracy. Not one equity analyst on the earnings call that was held one day after our
report was released raised a single question regarding any of the detailed findings in the Mithra report, despite the
fact that the report is solely focused on the detailed and complex financial and accounting issues which we would
expect them to understand and interrogate. Each of the analysts was provided copies of our report via email at least
one day prior to the call. Over the last several days, most equity analysts have piled on with reiterated buy ratings on
the basis of comfort provided by VIPS in one-on-one meetings with the analysts. VIPS's response has been to
regurgitate much of its previously disclosed and woefully inadequate accounting policies pablum."


Priceless info there. No analyst with boots on ground visits and market research or Geo Team believed any of it. Not
even one out of 30+ .. Wow, that's a great record!

This is nothing to do with reg fd. Companies can always talk to analysts or investors with questions. They
cannot disclose material non-public information - say if Tencent or some other were to make an investment in

companies are, for example not having to disclose information about trading by insiders. Hence, when questions or

analysts to conduct more comprehensive due diligence. In this case, it seems they are not.

with your "hallucinations". That's a record of an achievement only you can accomplish! I have never seen

I have some seen some huge battles between longs and shorts on some companies in the past, HLF is a recent
example. All the times both sides were hot shots or well-known figures on Wall Street. Whatever they do and they say
people listen. They got broad media coverage.


What's peculiar this time is that there is not a distinguished long-side figure. On the short-side, there is a self claimed
one-person research firm that would have not gotten any media exposure if not for SeekingAlpha.com came out
pushing very hard. The research firm was never heard before and had not done researches on any other companies.


I don't know about the others, to me the reports appear to be full of speculation and rather amateurish, not
professional at all. If you have watched Bill Ackman's three-hour long video laying out their short thesis on Herbalife
you would know what I mean. And the author's articles appeared to be very different in style from the research reports
from general security analysts.


In the two articles published, the author appeared to be addressing a very inexperienced audience as if the readers
are either very poorly informed on VIPS or had little knowledge in accounting and investing. The author did a lot of
handholding as if fearing that the readers wouldn't get the points.


I think there are some inexperienced speculators on a hot stock like VIPS. There are certainly good reasons for the
author to specifically target them and hoping to sway some of the other investors along the way.

Rob Y Stifel did even better than that. They initiated new coverage even after Mithra report. It's one thing to reiterate
or upgrade but to assume new coverage after the Mithra report is like throwing the report in trash can after tearing
apart into million pieces. That's what Stifel analyst seem to have done.

Why would you say that? Basically based on your reasoning, any company with a minority interest in a loss-making
company are all problematic?

Very detailed article, may need to skim their financial statements a lot more to understand some of your allegations.
For now shall remain neutral :D

MFR, please answer my question. Any company having minority stake in a loss-making company is problematic?
Where is the evidence that VIPS is actually not profitable? I suppose for your actual job, you do not jump to
conclusion like this, do you?

Splitter R, I am not surprised Mithra went quiet. I have seen the same thing with other fraudsters like Trinity
Research Group. Once they cashed out on short term distortions following their hit pieces on VNET, they
vanished. VNET is going private and none of the fraud accusations leveled on VNET came to be true.


In case Mithra chooses to respond, I want him to state unequivocally - a) that he is not covering his short
position until it meets the price target he set out b) come forward upfront with his positions and any changes. I
want to see if this person really means what he says! I bet he is not and I would not be surprised if he already
partly cashed out on short term distortions caused (similar to what Trinity Group did on VNET)


Unfortunately these financial terrorists are causing more harm to the US investors (by helping the PE firms
steal companies at low valuations) than any real fraud being exposed. Check how many companies went
private or bought out after hit pieces vs. any real frauds exposed!

Agreed. I respect short sellers only when they are truly diligent and honest to the public and to him/herself as well.

Going by the recent record of short hit pieces, hardly any have been proved to be true. Many short sellers
caused short term market distortions and took profits before disappearing from here.


Lot more financial damage has been done to US investors by the short sellers (with baseless accusations)
than by any real fraud companies that they exposed. Short sellers are unleashing financial terrorism on US
investors by invoking China Scare on US investors with baseless accusations for their short term profits.


Many China ADRs opted to go Private following the "short hit" pieces depriving the US investors of the real
value of the companies. Most private offers are at low ball prices, taking full advantage of the US investors
negative sentiment towards China ADRs driven partly by the baseless short sellers accusations.


SEC should look into these short seller baseless accusations and make them fully accountable for their
actions and trading activity. These things are similar in nature to somebody issuing a false SEC filing like the
recent Avon case

It is quite funny to see that VIPS is so heavily discussed by a lot of people who actually have never been to China and
have little understanding on the industry dynamics. In China, the opinion on this stock is pretty divided as well with
lots of not so sophisticated investors having been heavily longing VIPS, believing that it is another miracle stock. The
problem with this stock is that sophisticated investors have never tried its service and therefore cannot be sure
whether there are really many people using it.


Basically the business model of VIPS is taking advantage unsophisticated consumers in China. The prices of most
merchandise sold on VIPS are pretty much the same as most other websites. It is unclear whether these
unsophisticated consumers will realize that or not in the future.


VIPS's business model has been benefited a lot by the sluggish Chinese economy with ongoing destocking activities
by various manufacturers, esp apparel. If Chinese economy is picking up soon (on the consumer sentiment), this kind
of business model is going to be adversely affected.


Its current margins are definitely not sustainable in the long run with the competitive landscape. Its bargaining power
with supplier will greatly diminish once destocking activities slow down in China.


There are also a lot of suspicion on its current reported net margin, which looks very unrealistic in China. It has to be
the case that the logistics company is charging a much lower rate on VIPS vs all other e-commerce companies in
China. It is unclear whether VIPS's equity investment in the logistics company they use has real economic savings or
only temporary accounting savings.


I also want to comment that most sell-side analysts on this stock have not done much of due diligence or even
demonstrate in-depth understanding on the industry landscape.

Geo-investing's ground report is a nice start but it is almost pointless for valuation purposes. VIPS's valuation is
almost entirely based on flow metrics instead of stock metrics (trading at enormous p/b multiple anyway).


I suggest that investors should pay close attention to unbiased 3rd party operation metrics on VIPS and consumer
sentiment on this company, something I may elaborate more if I have time.


Disclosure: I have always been shorting VIPS as a hedge as its stock prices go up while longing some other Chinese
stocks/Internet stocks.

Condor - though I disagree on your short thesis on VIPS based on your understanding of its market size /
potential, margins, etc., I respect your opinion.


"Disclosure: I have always been shorting VIPS as a hedge as its stock prices go up while longing some other
Chinese stocks/Internet stocks."


If you were successful in hedging short against VIPS, you were a great investor. Last I checked VIPS has
been one of the top performers in the markets since its IPO. I don't know how you could have successfully
hedged against it. But if you did, you deserve a pat on the back.


Along with VIPS, I have invested in several other China ADRs (like DANG BABA YOKU JD JMEI VNET
DSKY etc.) but none came close to the way VIPS has done! My only wish was if I had invested the money I
put in DANG 3 years ago also in VIPS, that would have performed 5000% better!

It feels like you are so bullish on VIPS, along with some speculators in China. VIPS is a decent company, but
not worth its current valuation. If you are still making some money in this stock, you may as well consider
reducing your stake in it. VIPS needs to fight extremely hard to live up to market expectation in the coming
few quarters.

Read this article. With regards to your major points, it seems as though you make a lot of accusations but I don't see
a lot of proof. You say things like "we believe they are doing X to funnel funds to related parties." Ok well do you have
any proof? Will anyone ever have any proof? Because if you don't these will remain accusations and that will be that.


I know some pretty smart hedge funds that did a lot of digging into VIPS, Passport and ESG to name a few. Both own
or have owned a lot of this company. They do on the ground due diligence, not just reading some filings. I'm not
saying they are right here, but going to China, meeting with management, suppliers, customers, doing background
checks, doing surveys, etc. - it all adds up to more than what you put on paper here. Just saying.

Somebody did decent work on the background of Mithra - http://bit.ly/1LoT7R6


It is also posted on StockTwits under VIPS by user oddly named as mithra too!


Per the information, Mithra is Melvin Glapion of Kroll - Until recently Kroll has a page on him listing details. However
that page no longer exists. One can still view it on Google Cache - http://bit.ly/1LoT6wG


Why his information has been removed from Kroll? It was there last week as per google cache but does not exist any
more? Perhaps Mithra (err Melvin) can explain?

Someone on StockTwits (DLB4) called Kroll to inquire on Melvin Glapion. He or She was told that Melvin no longer
works for Kroll. One wonders what happened? Was his employment came to sudden end due to illicit publication here
putting Kroll to possible legal action by VIPS?


This author's silence for several weeks here also does not help. I'm wondering what happened to Mithra (Melvin?).


26 Jun 2015, 06:14 PM


stockplaza
There is a wide speculation on StockTwits, Yahoo and SA here http://seekingalpha.co... that something is brewing
against this author?


People who called Kroll confirmed Melvin Glapion is no longer employed there. After 5 years, his employment ended
suddenly in the past week or two. Speculation is that he has been fired.


Anyone has any additional information on what's behind the silence of this author (Melvin) or the reasons for sudden
separation from Kroll? Why is this author silent and not addressing questions/issues raised?


What is the involvement of the SA Editor Daniel?

Author’s reply »  The author of this report is busy writing yet another update.


Wouldn't your energies be better spent asking VIPS about when they will answer the questions raised in the various
reports.


Their silence has not helped the share price.

Glad you chose to respond and yet write another update. The share price has indeed done better than other
comparable in the space (for example JMEI which I was short as a hedge). I don't think you raised any

questions that are worthy of paying any attention by the company. Not even one sane analyst cared to even

I have just now checked the charts of BABA and VIPS ever since you published your reports? Guess what,
VIPS is doing on par or better than BABA despite all the slander, hundreds wasted press releases
(advertisements?) from law firms, JCAP, Dialectic, etc.


If you don't believe check the charts for yourself:) and you'll be surprised!
