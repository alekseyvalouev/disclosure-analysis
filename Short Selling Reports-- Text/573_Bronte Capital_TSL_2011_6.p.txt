Trina Solar's very understanding banks...
Trina Solar is fast becoming a test-piece about just how understanding a Chinese bank can become. 
 
They have just produced some pretty ordinary numbers (as pre-announced) but it the massive
changes in their balance sheet that are really interesting.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Trina Solar's very understanding banks...


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/08/trina-solars-very-understanding-banks.html 2/5


Posted by John Hempton at 10:11 PM  


 
 
 
 
Cash went up from $490 million to $631 million - an increase of $141 million. 
 
But that was the end of the balance sheet good news. 
 
Short term debt went up from $153 to $343 million. They borrowed $190 million short term. 
 
And long term debt went up from $296 to $383 million. They borrowed another $87 million. 
 
So another way to look at it is that the company chewed through a net (190+87-141=) 136 million
despite their (much lower) stated profit. 
 
What gives? Its a widget company with stated profit but cash burn. 
 
Actually we know what gives - the company still can't sell their product to customers that actually pay. 
 
Inventory went up from $180 to $226 million. This company is still shipping to warehouses... 
 
Receivables went up from $543 to $584 million. So they are selling to people who are slow to pay (but
who have probably already received irrevocable delivery of solar panels and installed them into
levered solar parks. (The project financier almost certainly has the collateral now!) 
 
The rest of the cash burn wasn't really burn - it was (another) large increase in capacity. These
increases are happening despite the obvious problems this company has in selling its inventories. 
 
As I said - the banks are very understanding. 
 
And they will need to be because the company has contracted to buy lots more silicon and it needs to
increase its output substantially. They tell us that the silicon price will be lowered in accordance with
the contract. That is great: they are going to need it. 
 
Today at my office in Sydney I was cold-called by a solar panel installer. Business is quiet so they
were drumming up business. They want to sell me panels at an installed price (with inverters etc).
 The panel price was $1.35 per watt. Not kidding - way below where Trina is currently booking sales. 
 
The brand was Alex Panel - another company which the salesman assured me was "planning to list
on the New York Stock exchange".  
 
Trina say next quarter will be better. At $1.35 per watt sold by retail-cold-call in Sydney I don't quite
see it.

1.35$ is really very cheap. 
 
Don't know what power prices are in your area, but at that solar cost and in your climate -
it must be becoming competitive without any subsidy.

Given their last loan facility previously discussed was at 10% over best lending rates in
China, how the hell do you fund yourself at 7x debt/EBITDA if you borrow at 13-14%? I
guess this is policy lending in China....  
 
Really the convertibles here are super dooper cheap. Unlikely they default if the state still
loves them and its a cheap option with free carry.  
 
Alternately, well, they're screwed.

Why did they borrow $190 short-term when they have $630 in cash on the balance
sheet?

For accuracy's sake might be noted that listed nominal output could be misleading the
same way car engine's top HPs - it's the curve that actually matters. About a year ago I
talked to oil/gas guys, they among other thing tried small bits of solar power here and
there and found that actual, round-clock output including weather conditions was not
directly proportional to listed capacity - some leaders-on-paper would drop output too
sharply when light goes below perfect. They said even suppliers weren't able to explain or
accurately predict those effects with various brands. 
But that's of course low-two digits % difference, not times, so underlying point stands. 
 
Same Russian guy who was happy with Guanxi explanation, 
Dmitry.

$1.35 AUD or USD? Because $1.35 USD is well above the current market price (around
$1.20 USD currently)

AUD $1.35 a watt sold retail by someone cold-calling - that is interesting...

Hey John, 
 
Have you checked out the company that is quoting the $1.35 figure? If something sounds
too good be true, then it should be worth checking out whos behind it.

They got an agent in Australia in June, according to their News page.

By best guess is that Trina Solar is being financed by subsidies from the Chines
government, or through a bank intermediary to expand capacity. If global solar demand
tanks because of an economic contraction in Europe, the Chinese government will be the
buyer of last resort since it needs to diversify away from its coal only energy policy and It
wants to rapidly grow local green energy suppliers. So watch out for the Chinese
government put on solar stocks...

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Trina Solar's very understanding banks...


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/08/trina-solars-very-understanding-banks.html 4/5

I read an article about Evergreen Solar (R.I.P.) that was written before their bankruptcy.
The author of the article was wondering aloud why the bondholders hadn't closed them
down, as they had defaulted. 
 
Then I remembered the Lehman debacle... the bond holders were loaned shares of
Evergreen as part of their convertible debt deal. They were completely hedged. So, I'm
bringing this up because maybe Trina's banks are short the equity or are hedged perfectly
somehow. Maybe they have some off balance sheet puts or something funky.

cough *political influence* cough 
 
Trina's CEO is also a politburo member of Changzhou city politburo. 
 
Trina is based in Changzhou. 
 
this is not about guanxi/connections, political influence is one step above guanxi.

(1) on the inventory increasing, you have to remember that Solar sales have a lot of
seasonality (sales come in Back-end loaded throughout the year and there was a lot of
uncertainty in key mkts ie. Europe over last few months, so I expect inventory to
deplete..this phenomenon happened last year too)...plus goldman says the sector is
bottoming out..so cant be too bearish (2) No one in their right mind would sign a contract
for $4b of poly over however many years @ a certain price without outs, and im sure they
can get out of it (ie. how STP got out of their MEMC contract this qtr)...so i disagree with
the "they have to grow like crazy or go bust" thesis(3) Could it be possible that this
$1.35/W you recieved would be net of subsidies? And if so, have you worked out how
many years it would take for you to breakeven on your investment in a solar panel?...that
could be very interesting..in my humbe opinion, once it gets to about 3yrs or even
5yrs...these panels will sell like hotcakes. Your thoughts appeciated.

What's so different about Trina?  
 
Almost all the Chinese panel makers are running high debt/cap with a significant portion
of the debt being short-term, and at implied interest rates more commonly found amongst
the senior secured investment grade bonds of U.S. utilities than commodity
manufacturers in the midst of a supply glut and economic challenges in their main
markets. 
 
They almost all have massive off balance sheet purchase obligations that swing wildly
from year to year. It's more common than not for these guys to either be integrating
vertically or making strategic investments in, or advance payments to, the same poly-si
makers they have the purchase commitments with. 
 
It looks and feels like a coordinated strategy to create national champions. It's opaque as
hell. Clearly the culture of the industry is promotional. 
 
If anything, the difference with Trina is the presence of those LOCs in the hands of
suppliers you pointed out the other day. But how can you be sure that what you see is
real? 
 
I don't know how a person can value companies like these. You don't know if the inputs to
the financial statements are real. There is so much happening behind the scenes that's
not knowable.  
 
If I know one thing that's actionable it's that FSLR and SPWRA are on the business end
of this activity and by the time China gets done with them they probably won't be trading
above book.

John, it seems to me that you're making your bet primarily based on that $14.5 billion 5-7
year poly-si supply purchase obligation. So, you believe that number (and contract), but
don't believe other numbers (and/or comments). What gives? Although your reasoning
makes sense - if you can believe what you read in those numbers - how on earth do you
make a massive bet with such uncertainty in the sources? If you don't believe one
number or comment, how can you believe the others?  
 
Sounds like you might owe your investors an explanation, eh? 
 
Thanks for the posts, nonetheless...:)
