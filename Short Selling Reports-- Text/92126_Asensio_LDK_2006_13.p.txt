LDK: Another Questionable


Supply Agreement, Another


Recycled Announcement


Today LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK $48.74) made another


questionable announcement concerning a supply


agreement.


LDK announced signing an agreement with Solartech Energy


Corp. to supply 550 MW of silicon wafers over a �ve-year


period, from 2009 to 2013. On October 3, 2007 LDK


announced signing a �ve-year contract with Solartech, to


supply $224 million worth of wafers. To view the press


releases, click here.


Solartech had production capacity of 30 MW last year, and is


expanding to 180 MW by the end of 2008, according to LDK’s


press releases. With 550 MW over �ve years, LDK is


supplying 110 MW per year, over half Solartech’s production


capacity, not including supplies under the contract


announced last year. LDK’s average selling price for the


second quarter, stated in the earnings conference call, is


$2.44 per watt. At this price, the contract with Solartech


announced today is worth approximately $1.32 billion.


Though Solartech, a Taiwan-based company, is apparently


able to sign agreements to spend over a billion dollars, it has


not yet managed to have its website translated into English.
