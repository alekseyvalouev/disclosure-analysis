What The Market Missed On Kandi
Jun. 21, 2013 9:30 AM ET122 comments
by: Richard Pearson


(Editors' Note: The accuracy of some portions of this article have been disputed.)


Lately I have been flooded with inquiries from investors on Kandi Technologies
(NASDAQ:KNDI). The stock has doubled in the past two weeks on the back of two
encouraging press releases from the company. There have also been several bullish
Seeking Alpha articles.


The question these investors have is: with all of the recent positive news, why can't Kandi
hold its gains. Kandi has twice soared to over $8.00 following company press releases,
only to quickly fall back by 25-30% into the $6.00 range.


Many investors have become so focused on researching the technology that they failed to
do some very basic reading which could significantly change their current investment
theses.


I have lived in and out of China for over 20 years and I have formally studied Mandarin for
more than 8 years. I have also owned two electric vehicles while in China which I have
absolutely loved. In years past, I would describe the pollution in Beijing as either: bad,
extremely bad or absurd. But 2013 is the first year in which "absurd" no longer does it
justice.


However, I am not a bull on Kandi at current prices. The market has missed some very
important information. Once clarified, it is likely that Kandi will return to $4.00-5.00 as soon
as next week.


I am not a China bear. Of my last 4 China stock articles, I have written 2 bull pieces and 2
bear pieces. My next planned article is a bullish piece on a Chinese small cap buyout. If I
thought that Kandi had further upside, I would be the first one to buy the stock in size and I
wouldn't hesitate to tell the world why.


On April 25th, Kandi filed an "ATM" registration statement under which it can sell up to $60
million of equity "from time to time" in the market. No investment bank is needed, only
brokerage firms. Reporting can be done much later such that investors won't even know it
is happening. Yet given the low price and volume at the time, such an offering would have
been impossible.

5/22/2018 What The Market Missed On Kandi - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 2/56


The rise this week is extremely fortuitous. Kandi needs the stock to be high and needs to
issue equity immediately for one simple reason. Next week the company has over $25
million in short-term debt and payables coming due, beginning on Monday, June 24th. Yet
those promoting the stock have simply ignored the fact that Kandi has only $3 million in
cash.


Fortunately, for Kandi, author, investor and former brokerage head Art Porcari appeared
exactly two trading days after the filing of the ATM with a series of extremely bullish
articles on Kandi. He likened it to Tesla and predicted an epic short squeeze. Mr. Porcari
informed me by phone that he has also been the architect of a coordinated buying
campaign being done through various firms and promoters.


Mr. Porcari's relationship with Kandi dates back at least 6 years to before its reverse
merger in 2007. He has accompanied management on multi-city road shows to introduce
them to investors. He has approached the company to try to raise money for them from
his investors. He is in the process of trying to get a brokerage firm to publish research on
the company. Now his investment banking company is also sending out promotional
emails on the Kandi. Mr. Porcari told me by phone that none of this is for business
purposes, because he is retired.


Yet these are all of the services for which an investor relations firm would be paid at least
$10,000 per month. Since the time of the IPO, that would mean around $720,000 in fees
(and some warrants on the stock). But Mr. Porcari told me that he performs these services
for free.


Porcari claimed to me by phone that he has generated over 4 million shares of buying into
the stock. He also claimed that his buyers would not sell until $50.00. But given that many
of Mr. Porcari's claims about Kandi are entirely incorrect, I believe that many of these
buyers will flee the stock when they uncover the misstatements that are circulating with
respect to Kandi.


In the past, Porcari's registration was terminated by FINRA for a near identical scheme in
which he misrepresented facts to brokers in order to pump up a stock. At the time, Porcari
had been retained as a "financial relations" consultant to perform the services he now
provides for Kandi. The SEC noted that he had been pumping a stock as a short squeeze
without any basis. He ended up settling with the SEC. He was also charged with insider
trading for trading ahead of non-public announcements. The details can all be found at
FINRA BROKER CHECK. I strongly encourage people to read this, as the charges are
very serious.

5/22/2018 What The Market Missed On Kandi - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 3/56


The ammunition for those promoting the stock has been two perfectly timed press
releases from Kandi. The first one was an approval by the China's Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology ("MIIT"). Yet so far no one appears to have actually read the
actual document. I have included links to the original Chinese and translated copies
below, along with an explanation of why this document is actually quite problematic for
Kandi shareholders.


The second announcement could have come on the same day as the first announcement.
It was released in China weeks ago. Instead, Kandi kept this fire power in its back pocket
until needed. When the share price dipped to $6.06, Kandi put out a press release about
the pending sale of 5,000-10,000 cars in HangZhou. The share price soared by a much
needed 30% for Kandi.


Yet this was actually old news, having been released in 2012. At that time, the original
number was 20,000. Yet this 50-75% reduction in vehicles has been spun by promoters as
a positive development to those "newbies" who are just getting into the stock without any
background information or knowledge. Details are included below.


Investors would be wise to view with caution the timing and content of the two recent
press releases and the coordinating momentum campaign. These coincide perfectly with a
$60 million stealth equity offering and an urgent need for money.


Similar activity with other Chinese reverse mergers.


A few weeks ago, Cleantech Solutions (CLNT) put out a press release noting that it had
become a certified supplier to Sinopec. Naturally the stock price tripled. The normally
illiquid stock quickly traded over $200 million in volume. But when I verified the details with
Cleantech and with Beijing New Century Certification Co. (北京新世纪认证有限公司), I
found out that this was just a perfunctory 3rd party certification that does nothing to ensure
actual sales.


Like Kandi, various US-based parties had been pumping Cleantech as a multi-bagger
stock. But when I wrote my article disclosing my findings, Cleantech quickly plunged.


Following my article, the stock is now down by 50% from those highs.


Sometimes these "news" releases are just plain false.


On the day when Kandi soared 70% based on misunderstood MIIT information, ChinaBak
Battery (NASDAQ:CBAK) was up by 65%. A headline was somehow disseminated stating
that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 4/56


China Bak confirms deal with Kandi to make batteries.


Saying that a company "confirmed" such news is a very strong statement. Yet ChinaBak
has never done any business with Kandi and in fact did not even know who Kandi was
prior to the false headline.


How did I know this? I simply called ChinaBak in Shenzhen and asked their management
team. The stock had traded over 1.5 million shares, so it seems I was the only one to have
done this.


Following my article on ChinaBak, the stock is now down by around 35% from its highs.


The mere idea that ChinaBak would be supplying batteries to anyone was absurd.
ChinaBak is deeply insolvent, its CFO has resigned, its audit chair has resigned and it has
already received a delisting notice from the NASDAQ. ChinaBak is now selling its
remaining inventory at below cost in order to repay the banks that it owes. But someone
clearly made money off of the false headline.


Kandi's upcoming debts


The details of Kandi's $25 million in debt which comes due next week can be found in the
recent 10Q. Yet no one who is promoting the stock seems to give it any mention. This is
surprising given that Kandi only has $3 million in cash.


Kandi does have $7.9 million in restricted cash, but the amount for loans and notes
payable now totals over $55 million.


On page 26, we can see that there are $22.3 million of Notes Payable due next Monday
and Tuesday. On page 25 we can see that there are an additional $3 million of short-term
bank loans due next Thursday.


The "ATM" registration statement


Kandi's S3 filing is known as an "At the Money" registration statement. These stock
offerings are referred to as ATM's for their ability to simply withdraw cash from the market
"from time to time" and without using an investment bank. Companies can simply sell to
brokers who then resell. Reporting of the sales can be done much, much later. Investors
who are buying at the same time the company is selling may not find out about it for
months.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 5/56


There are two problems with ATM's. First, they create an invisible overhang which
investors cannot see. The stock will appear strong, but then fail to rise as the company
sells into it. Investors never know why.


But second, the timing of "major news," which drives the stock upwards into the offering,
can then become very suspect.


Without the news, the Kandi ATM offering would be impossible to execute due to the low
price and volume. Without selling stock, Kandi would only have $3 million in cash with
which to pay these $25 million in debt next week.


Fortunately for Kandi, two very well-timed press releases and a string of bullish articles
have now enabled Kandi to sell $60 million in stock. No press release is required.


Mr. Porcari has told me (and presumably many others) that by Friday, Kandi's stock will
surge because market makers are short many call options and they will need to scramble
for cover. Yet even a market novice knows that market makers do not sell naked options.
When they sell a call, they simultaneously buy some common stock to hedge. This is how
they make their tiny arbitrage spread. He has also likened Kandi to Tesla
(NASDAQ:TSLA), predicting an epic short squeeze. Yet as I will show below, this
statement is entirely unfounded.


But getting the stock price higher as possible was obviously very important for Kandi.


The Porcari promotion campaign - suddenly reignited


Mr. Porcari has now written a grand total of 17 articles on Seeking Alpha. All 17 of these
articles are centered around a single company: Kandi.


Mr. Porcari informed me that the real "muscle" behind the buying comes from Phil
Hummel of New Jersey and New York. Hummel had previously worked for Blinder
Robinson.


Blinder and Robinson was a notorious brokerage which was shut down for committing
stock fraud with microcap stocks. Founder Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud
following the collapse.


A lengthy and detailed expose on how Blinder would own stocks while hiding the
ownership can be found here. It makes for very colorful reading. The nickname "Blindem
and Robem" can first be found in a Forbes article which focused on the stock fraud. In

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 6/56


fact, when mentioning Hummel, Porcari stated simply that "he came from Blindem and
Robem," assuming that this was funny.


Hummel now works for World Equity. Mr. Porcari notes that he has known Mr. Hummel for
31 years. When the stock hit $6.90 on Wednesday, Mr. Porcari quoted the muscle as
saying "watch me run the stock" and within an hour it was back to $7.50. That is certainly
power. But by the end of the day it was hitting $7.00 again.


Understanding the MIIT approval - the initial surge in Kandi


The initial news spark which caused the 100% leap in Kandi's share price was a very brief
press release noting that the Kandi / Geely car (model JL7001BEV) had been approved
by the China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and would qualify for
subsidies.


I found the doubling of the stock to be odd given that Kandi has released nearly identical
press releases in the past. These press releases provided a temporary boost to the stock
but have never resulted stratospheric sales.


Back in 2010, Kandi put out a press release stating


Kandi Reports Another of Its EVs -- Model KD5010XXYEV -- Has Been Approved for
Sale in China by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology


The share price soared 30% as expected. But then it fell back to its original level, as
expected.


The most recent press release only pertained to the Geely model and stated


According to No. 27 public announcement of MIIT, Kandi Brand/JL7001BEV model is
among the latest vehicles on the lists of "Approved Vehicles (No. 248)" and
"Recommended Models for Energy Saving & New Energy Vehicle Demonstration
and Promotion in China (No. 45)". As a result of this approval, the purchaser of such
pure electric sedan will now be qualified to receive all levels of national and local
subsidies and incentives for EVs.


Yet of all the people writing about Kandi in articles, it seems that no one makes any
reference to the actual text within this MIIT announcement. In Mr. Porcari's recent article,
he did not include any reference to this link. Instead he included a link from a commercial
site called ChinaCar.com. This site has nothing to do with MIIT approval.

For anyone who cares to actually read the actual document from the actual MIIT, what
they will see is that "248" and "45" lists are a massive list of Chinese and international
automakers. There are quite literally hundreds of carmakers who have been approved for
thousands of models on these lists.


International carmakers approved include Honda, Buick, Mercedes-Benz, Chevrolet,
Suzuki and Peugeot, among others. Domestic carmakers approved included giants such
as FAW, DongFeng, Beijing Auto and ChangAn. It also included dozens of smaller
manufacturers.


Readers should also make note of what types of vehicle made the extensive list. There
are literally dozens of electric sedans listed, but there are also electric dump trucks and
even electric cement mixers. The point is that there is nothing exclusive about this list.
Anyone who makes an electric vehicle can get on the list, and thousands of models are
already on it.


Most other companies did not even bother to make an announcement. Certainly their
share prices would not have doubled just for getting a single model placed on this
extensive list.


It certainly was not "news" for Geely. Geely's share price was basically flat to slightly down
on the day of the announcement. Volume was light.


The MIIT put up the announcement on May 17th. While no one else felt it worthwhile to
highlight their spot on this list, even Kandi did not put out their press release for two full
weeks. They controlled the timing completely.


The "news" of being one spot within this massive list did not generate any attention in
China whatsoever - until Kandi released it and Porcari promoted it. At that time, various
authors began to make it into something that it clearly wasn't. Being on this list is truly a
non-event.


I have posted a copy of the original announcement in Chinese along with an English
version at moxreports.com. The translation was done automatically using the Translate
feature in Word. The model referred to is listed under the brand "Lucky." (Geely in Chinese
is pronounced JiLi 吉利 and it means Lucky in Chinese).


Key point: Kandi's approval by the MIIT (which caused the stock to double) was a
non-event. There are hundreds of other manufacturers who received the same
approval. No other vehicle makers felt the need to sensationalize this news. Geely's
stock did not budge on the news. Prior to the headline, Kandi was trading at $3.92.

The HangZhou EV sharing - Kandi's second surge


Following the MIIT announcement, Kandi soared as high as $8.50. But unfortunately the
buzz didn't last. Within days, Kandi was down to $6.06 and it looked like the hype was
fading.


With perfect timing, the company then announced that the city of HangZhou would be
launching a "mini-public transport system" and that 5,000-10,000 Kandi vehicles would be
in use in that system within 1 year. As would be expected, the stock soared again, briefly
hitting $8.30 - up a whopping 30%.


But those who are suspicious of Chinese ATM facilities are quick to point out that the
latest "news" had actually been announced by the HangZhou government two weeks
earlier. It was only when Kandi's share price began to plummet that this news was
released by Kandi.


These suspicions towards ATMs only grow stronger when watching an otherwise strong
share price quickly fade by 20% to $6.72 on heavy volume after hitting that high of $8.30.


Back in 2012, Mr. Porcari wrote an article trumpeting this development, well before it had
occurred. The number which had previously been contemplated was not 5,000-10,000
vehicles, but instead was a much larger 20,000 vehicles. Mr. Porcari noted:


Four days prior to KNDI's US press release, this article came out on China's
preeminent "Electric Grid" website which seems to confirm my point clearly:


Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. Signed a Cooperative Letter of Intent With China Aviation
Lithium Battery Co., Ltd. (OTCQX:CALB) to Promote 20,000 Pure Electric Vehicles
in Hangzhou


It is reported that Hangzhou 20000 pure electric car rental project will be
implemented in August, is expected to be completed before the end of 2013


The Kandi press release took the share price from a low of $3.60 to over $4.00. Mr.
Porcari's subsequent article further took the stock to $4.92. Yet within weeks, the share
price was back to trading as low as $3.84.


The implementation of the HangZhou plan has clearly happened as planned and on
schedule. Yet the decline from 20,000 vehicles down to as low as 5,000 vehicles has
somehow been ignored. Actually the 5,000-10,000 number has been somehow portrayed
as a significant positive.

The stock price quickly faded and closed yesterday at $6.90.


Understanding the relationship with Geely


Many investors in Kandi have a serious misunderstanding about who Geely is and what
Kandi's relationship with Geely is. I continue to see Geely referred to as a "major" Chinese
automaker. This is not the case. Geely's market share has been consistent at around just
3% in recent years.


Earlier this year, it was announced that Geely would be partnering with Kandi to produce
and distribute electric vehicles.


The fact that Geely would choose to partner with Kandi is not surprising. Both companies
happen to be based in the Zhejiang, China. In fact, Kandi's relationship with Geely goes
back much further.


Kandi Vehicle Co. was established in March 2002 and was owned 83% by chairman Hu
Xiaoming and 17% by Haoqing Vehicle. Haoqing Vehicle was actually a subsidiary of
Geely such that the two were already acting as a joint venture until 2004.


This information can be found in the documents filed with China's State Administration for
Industry and commerce ("SAIC" 工商局). The reference to Geely's (吉利) ownership can
be found as the second line item in the table on this page from Kandi's SAIC file.


Personal relationships go a long way in China. Geely did not wake up one day and decide
to partner up with new upstart Kandi. These two companies have a long personal
relationship. No one that I have spoken with was aware of Kandi's long personal
relationship with neighboring Geely.


More importantly, bulls have ignored the fact that Geely is actually partnered with a
different EV maker, Detroit Electric, even months after Kandi. The much larger Detroit
partnership may end up supplanting the Kandi partnership.


The Detroit-Geely car will have a range of up to 160 miles and a top speed of up to 124
mph. Kandi's current vehicles have a top speed of about 35 mph. When I asked Kandi
about the specs for their Kandi-Geely vehicle, they said that they have not yet been
released and would be released later this year.


The stated value of the JV between Kandi and Geely was $160 million, with each side
contributing 50% of the money. Yet Kandi currently has just $3 million in cash and $50
million in short-term debt, so it is unclear where they will suddenly find the $80 million

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 10/56


needed to take this JV forward.


How Kandi will actually fund this remains a big question.


Even at the current elevated share price levels, Kandi's market cap is only $200 million,
meaning that funding this JV by issuing equity will be very difficult. Kandi is highly likely to
issue a large amount of equity under its ATM at current levels, but raising the full $80
million would be almost impossible. Even raising $60 million will put extreme pressure on
the share price.


And even then, most of the money raised will need to be used to repay near-term debts,
leaving Kandi without a clear funding source for this $80 million need.


Looking at Kandi's competition in China


Many US investors have been led to believe that Kandi is unique in China and produces
one of the only electric vehicles in China. As we can see from the MIIT list, there are
many, many competitors in this market from cities all across China.


Anyone who has actually lived in China knows that there are similar electric vehicles
everywhere. Most of these are basically identical to the Kandi vehicles and can be
purchased from small dealers in every major city.


The only reason why American investors think Kandi is so unique is that Kandi is the only
Chinese electric vehicle maker to trade on a US exchange (non pink sheets).


I have included this link to Alibaba, where I ran a search for electric car (电动汽车).
Clicking the links will reveal hundreds of different electric cars with identical prices and
specifications to Kandi cars (top speed, range, etc). For those who are not familiar, the
prices are listed with the Chinese unit of "wan" (万). When you see that symbol it means
10,000. So seeing a price of ¥3万 means 30,000 RMB, which equates to around
US$4,800. It should be noted that there are a number of electric cars available for less
than $3,000. According to its most recent 10K (page 2), Kandi is selling its electric cars for
an average price of around $4,500.


I strongly encourage anyone with an interest in Kandi to take a look at that Alibaba list and
compare the types of cars which are on the market. The list is extensive and the
competition is immense. These are the vehicles that will be competing for the business of
consumers, but also for the business of locally run EV rentals.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 11/56


Kandi has not developed any new and revolutionary technology for electric vehicles which
might set it apart from other manufacturers. Over the past few years, Kandi's total R&D
expense has totaled around $0.6 million per quarter. This is basically just the expense of
updating existing models and would not involve substantially new technology.


Tesla has spent over $500 million on R&D in just the past two years! This is more than
double the entire market cap of Kandi. New technology is not cheap, and with just 0.6
million per quarter in R&D, Kandi is not developing anything new.


Key point: Kandi is a low tech, commodity manufacturer of EVs with hundreds of
identical competitors. Kandi will not have scarcity or pricing power in trying to sell
its EVs.


Comparing Kandi to Tesla - the good and the bad


Kandi makes a form of electric car. Tesla makes an electric car. That is where the
comparison ends. People who are trying to tout Kandi as the next Tesla are simply taking
advantage of the sharp rise in Tesla's share price to draw attention to Kandi with the hope
that the extra attention will benefit Kandi's share price. So far, it has clearly worked.


Mr. Porcari has now penned 5 separate articles which contain both "Kandi and Tesla" in
the title. But in 2010, his efforts were focused on likening Kandi to a different high flyer.


EV maker BYD was up by as much as 1,000% and Mr. Porcari quickly likened Kandi to
BYD, even speculating that BYD shareholder Warren Buffet could buy Kandi!


This hype caused Kandi to rise from $3.65 (before his articles) to over $6.00 on
substantial volume. As with his recent Tesla-Kandi articles, the strategy clearly worked.
Yet within weeks, the stock was back to around $4.00 again.


Now that BYD is no longer the hot stock, Mr. Porcari has simply analogized Kandi to a
different (and equally dissimilar) EV maker, Tesla.


BYD is still around, but its share price has fallen by nearly 70%. It still boasts a partnership
with Mercedes Benz and Buffett is still involved. But since BYD's stock has collapsed, the
analogy to BYD no longer helps Mr. Porcari's cause, so this has all been forgotten.


When a high flying stock emerges, stock promoters will use that high flyer to attract
attention to a different stock that they hold simply to try to boost its price. When the
analogy helps them, they use it. When it doesn't help them, they abandon it.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 12/56


The slew of recent Tesla-Kandi headlines has been picked up by other media sties, who
look at nothing more than Kandi's soaring share price and the Tesla articles written by
promoters.


Even CNN Money came out with a short piece. But it was only 4 sentences long and
stated:


Look Out Tesla, There's a New Kid In Town


The picture they included appears identical (except for the color) to the low speed, low
tech Kandi car which I recently test drove. The Kandi EV truly has nothing in common with
the Tesla Sedan. CNN Money does not appear to have done any specific work other than
disseminating a well timed headline. Yet the share price immediately bounced on the
headline alone, hitting $8.00. The next day it traded down to $6.72.


Tesla has spent over $500 million on R&D in the past two years to develop game
changing technology. Their car has received rave reviews from all corners, including
Consumer Reports. This puts it in stark contrast with Kandi which continues to produce a
very functional, but very generic and commoditized, low speed elective vehicle.


Telsa's stock has tripled this year. This is partly because it greatly exceeded expectations
with its game changing technology and design. But it is also due to a very high short
interest in Tesla, which generated a massive short squeeze. The high short interest also
creates short buyers when the stock falls. As a result, it slows any decline in the share
price.


Tesla's short interest has stood at 20-30% of shares outstanding for most of the year. With
short interest this high, Tesla continues to be a dangerous and unrewarding short unless
one is extremely well capitalized and can afford to be extremely patient.


With Kandi, the short interest has been consistent at only 2% of shares out. It is irrelevant.
This is why the share price was able to drop from $8.50 back to $6.06 in just days. This is
also why the share price is likely to drop back to $5.00 or below without much resistance
as soon as the recent hype starts to fade. Mr. Porcari cited a very large short interest in
Kandi when comparing it to Tesla. He conveniently noted that average daily volume on
Kandi was just 40,000 shares, translating to 18 days of trading to cover the short position.
Yet earlier in this same article he mentioned that the volume had risen to 18 million
shares. Had he used that as the basis for his calculation, the time to cover the short
position would have been expressed in minutes not days.

Kandi's short interest is not responsible for its rise, as it was in Tesla. Instead, the stream
of promotional and inaccurate articles are responsible. More importantly, unlike Tesla, the
short interest will not slow a fall in Kandi's shares. We have already seen this on multiple
days where the share price has fallen by double digits.


Tesla is held 70% by institutional investors. Nearly every major mutual fund has a stake.
There are many institutional holders who hold individual positions of over $100 million.
With Kandi, only 1% is held by all institutions combined, just $2 million. The notion that
Tesla holders are now buying in to Kandi is clearly unfounded. Retail investors who bought
Tesla may now be buying Kandi, but that is not what would ever take this stock to $30.00.


Tesla's product is unique. Not just in America, but in the entire world. Tesla built a vehicle
that is actually desirable enough on its own merits to result in substantial sales despite a
whopping 6 figure price tag. Kandi is producing a commoditized product and it will vie to
compete with identical models from other manufacturers, even though its price tag
averages just $4,500.


This is actually a good thing for Kandi. Tesla has beaten the odds in getting as far as it
has. The market is littered with failed attempts at creating a Tesla style vehicle.
Companies simply engage in a strategy of "build and burn." The tendency has been
towards failure.


For example, Fisker Automotive had built a complicated and sophisticated electric car and
it expected to sell 100,000 of them in 2013. But instead it only sold around 2,000.


Fisker had the benefit of a $500 million line of credit from the DOE. Despite a few billion
raised and spent, the company is now facing bankruptcy.


Coda Automotive is now facing bankruptcy after its highly anticipated electric vehicle sales
failed to materialize. Coda debuted in 2010, so it only took 3 years to go from start to bust.


The point from this is that Kandi is pursuing a different market. Kandi is not pursuing the
high cost, high performance end of the spectrum. Kandi is pursuing a low cost, low end
highly competitive (and low margin) segment of the market.


The good news is that (unlike the companies above) Kandi is far less likely to spend itself
into bankruptcy. The bad news is that Kandi is never going to be a Tesla with a
stratospheric share price. Not unless it chooses to first burn half a billion in R&D and wait
5 years.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 14/56


Most of the people investing in Kandi are US-based retail investors. There is not even a
single institution which holds more than 0.3% of the shares outstanding. Kandi has also
failed to attract any research coverage. Those who are predicting that Kandi will trade at
$30.00 (or higher) this year should ask themselves why well funded and capable
institutions are basically ignoring this stock completely. Institutions like to make money
even more than small US retail investors.


Had institutions been buying Kandi, we would have already seen a flurry of 13G's
and 13D's which disclose institutional ownership.


Why is there no institutional interest ? It is likely that they are familiar with Kandi's product.


I recently had the opportunity to test drive a Kandi car, straight off of the lot. The car was a
2012 model which was still for sale, so it was not an old model. The model contemplated
by Kandi / Geely is actually based on the Panda model, which debuted in 2008.


On the positive side, this car is surprisingly roomy on the inside. Even though I look huge
when standing next to the car, when I get inside and put the seat all the way back, it is
really not too bad. It is not a car I would want to spend several hours in, but the range is
only 60+ miles, so driving for an extended period is not even an option.


The car drives just fine, but it tops out at about 35 miles per hour. The car comes with a
preset (programmed) speed limit of 25 mph, but this limit can be overridden by the dealer.


One positive about the Kandi car (and in fact about all competing Chinese electric
vehicles) is that they are low tech and easy to plug in. Total charging time is about 8
hours, so it can be done overnight. For those who get stuck somewhere, battery swapping
capability is expected to increase in the coming years.

However swapping batteries during the day is likely to be time consuming and expensive.
I expect most people will try to avoid it if they can.


On the negative side, this car definitely feels like a Chinese made car. The noise from the
propulsion definitely interferes with conversation. It is a very loud whirring noise. Each
time I hit a bump, the glove box would fall open. Shifting from forward to reverse is a bit
clunky. Driving at 35 mph is a slightly nerve racking experience.


Anyone who has the opportunity to drive this car would never, ever compare the company
to Tesla. A Tesla car can accelerate fast enough to snap the driver's head back. The Kandi
car is so slow that it made me self conscious while driving in traffic. No one would ever
want to be stuck driving behind one of these cars.


Even though it is roomy for the driver, there is almost no additional space to store
anything. A few bags of groceries in the back would entirely fill up the "trunk" type space.
This is clearly a necessary compromise. If the car were too small for the driver, no one
would want it. But by making space for the driver, extra trunk space had to go.


The batteries are kept under the seats. Accessing them was complicated and time
consuming. They are wired in in a very fixed way, such that getting them out and then
back in will be very cumbersome and time consuming when trying to swap them.


These cars are quite obviously not made for highway driving. But many Americans
assume that they are still fine for all types of intra-city driving. This is clearly not the case
in China. For example, Beijing is an enormous city of over 20 million people. To get from

the business district in ChaoYang to the technology district in ZhongGuanCun, one must
take a series of high speed "ring roads" that encircle the city. The trip should normally take
about 45-60 minutes.


Electric vehicles such as this one made by Kandi are not permitted on the "ring roads" due
to their speed. Taking normal streets to make the same trip is not feasible and could take
5-6 hours each way.


Other cities in China are also massive. Beijing is the size of New York and Los Angeles
combined, and Shanghai is actually double the size of Beijing! If you haven't been to
China, then you can't appreciate how massive and sprawling these cities are. There is a
misconception that Chinese cities are old and have narrow streets. It is a misconception
which is held by foreigners who have not been to modern China in the past 20 years.


That does not mean that Kandi's car won't sell any units. Instead it means that it will sell a
small number of units to those who want an alternative to taxis for very short local trips to
the gym, to the store or to meet a friend for dinner. I have used electric vehicles for these
purposes in China and they are perfect. Anyone who has been waiting to catch a taxi for 4
hours in the rain in Beijing will understand my point perfectly.


This vehicle is not going to be a Tesla style daily driver. There are also hundreds of
identical competing vehicle models for those who want such an alternative.


Conclusion


Just 2 weeks ago, Kandi was trading at prices of around $3.70. It then doubled to over
$8.00 due to two well timed press releases. Since the filing of the ATM registration
statement in April, there have been 4 articles from Mr. Porcari. When the stock began to
fade to $6.00, another well timed press release pushed the stock briefly above $8.00
again. But now it is fading again.


The recent run-up in Kandi's stock has nothing to do with any improvement in the
company. The MIIT news is a non-event which applies to hundreds of other manufacturers
besides Kandi. The HangZhou news is actually a let down vs. previous expectations of
20,000 vehicles, which has now been reduced to as low as 5,000 vehicles.


But the special promotion of these headlines by authors (along with a coordinated buying
campaign) has caused the share price to temporarily spike.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 17/56


Kandi has historically only traded around 40,000 shares per day, but this new attention
has seen this volume spike by 100-400x compared to normal. Yet the share price can't
hold its gains, despite the staggering volume.


The recent filing of an ATM registration statement casts doubt on the content and timing of
the recent news releases. It would certainly explain why the stock keeps giving up all
gains on high volume days. To the extent that this has all been a run up to facilitate a
much needed financing, Kandi would not even need to report the stock sales until much
later.


It would be a very grand coincidence if all of this happened to come together just days
before Kandi needed to pay $25 million in debt next week. Kandi has $3 million in free
cash, $7 million in restricted cash but over $50 million in notes payable and short-term
bank loans.


As with companies such as Cleantech, a dramatic spike in the share price which
immediately follows an ATM registration statement should be viewed with extreme caution.
It should also be reason for ample skepticism of recent "news" and of promotional efforts.


Kandi is not Tesla. It is not even close. The good news is that Kandi is less likely to spend
itself into bankruptcy through billions in R&D. The bad news is that Kandi is not new or
unique. It should not ever be expected to ever be a star performer like Tesla.


Those who own the stock (and benefit from its rise) have been making inaccurate and
irresponsible analogies to Tesla simply in order to create hype for Kandi. This is the same
technique that was used in comparing Kandi to BYD when it was up 1,000% in a year. It
worked in the short run, and Kandi rose to over $6.00, before falling back into the $3.00
range. The information being spread about a "short squeeze" on Kandi is both wrong and
misleading.


People are free to continue to believe that Kandi will eventually command a dominant role
in the Chinese EV market. They are free to believe that the share price will rise. But given
that there has been virtually no foundation for the recent explosive move, these people
should fully expect that the share price will correct to $4.00-5.00 within the next few days
or weeks. By knowing this, they can then make a decision as to whether or not to continue
to hold Kandi vs. selling now and buying back at $4.00 again.


Disclosure: I am short KNDI. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any

No mention of QBEX. No mention of 3 factories with 100K unit capacity. No list of cities lined up for rental garages

mention of Chinese subsidies soon to be announced. Very one-sided article. Only deliveries of thousands of units will

Look at John Petersen- when he writes an article, and people have questions or just attack, he's willing to
engage and explain. This is why he is one of the most popular contributors on SA. In fact, I first heard about
KNDI from him in a comment where I asked about battery swapping and he said KNDI was doing it.

Dirk McCoy, I'd bluntly say that you have not read the news during the last several days where there is a
growing credit crunch amongst Chinese banks,  and it is highly likely that in future it will be much harder for
companies to renew bank loans on a revolving basis. Unless of course you think there is no credit problem in
China?


Here is a link to an article from Businessweek that describes the current situation:


http://buswk.co/1aAt2f1.


One paragraph from this articles says:


"More responsible means reining in some of the rapid lending that has helped drive growth. In a worrying
sign, such lending has recently become less effective at doing so—likely because more and more new credit
has gone toward paying off interest on outstanding loans (and is probably helping hide a growing bad-debt
problem, too). Financing has been “going to firms that were rolling over their loans, and that is not causing an
expansion of the economy,”


The company also recently issued a bond at the a very high rate of 12%, with the funds coming from China
Everbright Securities. I assume China Everbright did their due diligence on the risks for this company and
know more about Kandi than you. Do you think a borrowing rate of 12% is the normal rate for a company that
has great finances?


Related to China Everbright Securities, China Everbright Bank, and other banks were previously lending
Kandi money at the rate of 6-7%. Now the borrowing rate for extra cash has shot up to 12% using this bond.
Please do not try to understate the risk for this company.


For those who wish to dispute this interest rate, The details of the 12% bond can be found at the bottom of
Page 26 from the latest 10Q filings. The comparable bank loan rates are at the bottom of Page 24.


21 Jun 2013, 03:22 PM


Dirk McCoy, Contributor
I left open the possibility there is a logical explanation for claiming $3M cash with $28M in revolving short loan
debt is a problem, and I appreciate your response. But I've been reading about a Chinese credit crunch for a
long time and I don't see anything that would portend the company being unable to roll this over. If your
information had been in the article, perhaps I wouldn't have suspected that this was a hit piece so fast, though
I would have suspected it all the same. Since I'm not privy to the company's debt negotiations, I guess we'll
wait and see.

I think the greater risk is the company not being allowed to substantially increase its debt (unless its at very
high interest rates), which may limit its ability to increase sales through credit and consequently restrict
account receivables growth. As of the last 10Q, account receivables were some $38m with another $11m in
notes receivables. Instead of growing this, Kandi must get customers to pay up using more cash rather than
letting them buy more on credit.


There are also $22m of notes payable due next week (see page 26 of the recent 10Q up to March 2013). The
company also needs to deliver $16m upfront cash for the jv.


All these factors must be reasons why the company recently filed an S-3 to raise up to an extra $60m in
stock. It is both common sense and inevitable that the company will try to issue new shares.


It will be interesting to see how things develop.

numjudge- KNDI is still borrowing at the same 6-7% or lower rate on their revolver. The 12% loan you are
talking about is a three year bond. The first KNDI has ever taken down and the total of their long term debt.
Not the revolver. Multi-year loans are rare in China and don't come cheap. There was a specific reason why
KNDI took down this three year bond (which btw can be paid off early with no penalty) at years end. If you
knew anything about the company and cared to get your facts straight you would have known this. Read all
the filings.


That bond is a junior debt instrument to other liabilities. Do you really think EB would have made that loan for
three years at any price if they felt the Company had any realistic risk?


Investors need to be concerned more about good prospects then worry about whether the company pays a
few points higher on their loan. KNDI is about to make over $30 million in the next 12 months. I think they can
handle the few point extra required at that point in time.


Since you don't know anything about the company, KNDI has taken less than a million dollars over the years
from government grants and loans, and paid multiples of that in taxes. Yet they still managed to build 10
different PRC approved EV's using their own resources? As much as I like TSLA, I would have liked to see
how they would have survived the past four years without Government help.

Arthur Porcari, what you say does not address the real issue, which you have attempted to obfuscate through
a load of waffle. If you knew anything about company analysis and cared to get your facts straight then you
would know that a 12% loan rate using a 3 yr bond is an unusually high interest rate for a company that is
supposed to be in good financial condition and have great prospects .

Everbright did a risk assessment of Kandi and decided it appropriate to charge it a high 12% interest rate to
reflect higher risk. Not 6% or 7%, but 12%. This is a much higher cost of extra debt. If the company had such
great finances and prospects, then it would be charged a lower interest rate. Therefore investors should be
concerned.


If the company had such great finances and is about to make so much money then it would not need to issue
an S-3 statement proposing a capital raising exercise of up to $60m.


Anyone should know that a 12% borrowing rate is high. The risk indicators are very clear, and even though
they do not seem to bother you, they certainly bother me, and they certainly bothered Everbright .


22 Jun 2013, 03:13 PM


Arthur Porcari, Contributor
nemesis- If we were talking about a US bank in the US Banking system, I might agree that the 12% for a
three year note is high, but we are not. We are talking about a China bank that works in a system that only a
small percentage of their business loans are done at terms over over one year.


Let me repeat what I said in a few other comments here but add another point. We have now gone 14 trading
days, and have traded over 76 million shares on a stock who's prior average daily volume was closer to
50,000 shares. Aside from the fact that we have seen no SEC filing of a "takedown" which is required within
two days, there is a further SEC restriction on selling stock in an S-3 which is no more than 30% of the float
can be sold. That would be around 5.5 million shares.


I don't know about you, but in my 40 years as a very active market participant, I have never heard of a stock
in one day jump 40% and trade 380 times is average volume, then over the next 13 days go up another 50+%
and sustain an average volume of over 100 times its prior average volume while slipping in a 5.5 million share
dilution.


Now perhaps I should feel honored by the scurrilous author of this "tome of pure hyperbole" giving me credit
for creating this trading circus, but I have been doing and saying the same thing about KNDI for several
years, to include two article comparing KNDI to TSLA in late April, which BTW, had no upward affect on
KNDI's stock,(though I guess I might should be given credit for kicking off TSLA's big run since its stock was
around $40 a share when I wrote those pieces). But if I really have all of a sudden become so powerful, to
create this type of action, then perhaps I should auction my services for a pay check on ebay.


But let me ask you. If you were the Company, and had to do an offering, do you think they would have done it
in the first few days of this run? Or wait a week risking a decline in activity and price?

Arthur Porcari, what you say is not true. The average interest rate is only 6-7% for multi-year loans in China
and they come in a variety of different forms. These are for non-SOEs. Yet in comparison Kandi is charged
nearly double at 12% for extra debt.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 23/56


This quote is from Institutional Investor magazine-the article's name is “China’s SMEs Look Increasingly to
the Bond Market for Financing”:


“SME bonds, which generally have maturities of about 30 months, offered yields of 6.37 percent on average
last year, according to NAFMII”. Here is the link to the article:


http://bit.ly/1aHMCWA


SMEs are Small to Medium Enterprises in China. NAFMII is the regulatory authority for China‘s Inter-bank
bond market and operates under the supervision of the PBOC. These SME bonds are considered relatively
high risk, and yet comparing yields, Kandi’s bond is nearly double their average yield.


For those interested, there is even a junk bond market in China. Here is a link describing it:


http://nyti.ms/1aHMCWE


And here are some specific examples of other financing forms:


In May 2013, Yingli Green Energy, listed on the NYSE, issued 1.2 billion RMB-denominated multi-year three-
year medium-term notes (MTNs) at a low annual interest rate of 5.78% . Here is the link:


http://bit.ly/1aHMC91


Even China BAK Battery, listed on NASDAQ, can get cheap three and five year bank loans at 6.4%. CBAK’s
loan details are on page F30 in their 2012 10K.


Zhongpin Inc, listed on NASDAQ, has a series of cheap multi-year bank loans with four Chinese banks, with
interest rates ranging from 6.4% to 7.2% and maturities for each year up to 2020. They are all listed on Page
67 of their 2012 10K.


All my opinions are based on fact, with references provided. Lower yield m ulti year loans do exist in China,
and come in a variety of forms. The company is borrowing extra money at long term rates of 12% when it is
supposed to have great finances and when other companies in China can do it much more cheaply.

Have you heard that Kandi's revolver isn't going to be rolled over? With receivables and inventory up and solid results
and prospects, it would be a normal course of business to replace the current short term notes with new short term
notes, although KNDI could decide that a share price around $8 might be a good time to raise some additional equity.


And what about the $38 Million deposit for acquisition on the books?


21 Jun 2013, 10:28 AM


Arthur Porcari, Contributor
KNDI's revolve has been rolled over for all the years they have been public. Each year the banks increase it.
In the past year alone it was increased almost 20 million.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 24/56


KNDI has very little long term debt which is common in the Chinese banking system. The Banks keep it to
one year so they can adjust to the current interest rates.


In KNDI's case, their CEO Mr. Hu, who is worth about a half billion dollars outside of KNDI p;ersonally
guarantees the revolver, not because he has to, but because he wants to get a lower interest rate for all his
shareholders. Know any US CEO's who own less than half the stock that stick out their neck like that?


21 Jun 2013, 11:00 AM


Arthur Porcari, Contributor
Let me first address the total BS you are creating. KNDI does not need any money next week, or for that matter in the
next year. They filed the S-3 like all listed companies do to take advantage of a major move up. Like over $25 a share
if at all. If they did, they would have used their S3 by now since the stock has traded over 70 million shares and has
doubled. If a company is of the mind to use an S3, they do it when the volume is strong and the stock first makes its
move. Here we are two weeks later and nothing.


If you and your short selling buddies have only this to hang your hat on. What are you going to tell the world when
next week comes and goes and KNDI just does what they always do and just roll their notes?


KNDI will likely earn over a dollar a share in the next 12 months. If you spent time talking about KNDI's China EV's
instead of its US LSEV's that never have been more than an asterisk to it financials, you would have know this. And
over 2.25 a share in 2014.


If you took the time to read my 17 articles, you would know I flood my comments with back up links. And I make the
logical case for investors to decided if they want to invest or not. It is none of my business who buys and sells any
stock. Its there money and they can spend it as they like. I just don't want them to be mislead by people like you lying
to investors.

It's interesting that the first four comments all attack the author and his motives without contradicting any of the facts
in this well-articulated explanation for how this entire runup was a pump and dump scheme to fund KNDI on the backs
of retail shareholders.

starting construction of the parking garages...... If you really want to talk "facts", that is.

Let me make this as perfectly clear as possible Mr. Pearson. You prey on manipulation and innuendo instead of hard
facts to shake out weak hands, usually the momentum traders, in an attempt to gain on a MicroCap stock that is
coming into its own. If you were truly someone of integrity and ethics, you would argue facts with facts, not argue facts
with manipulations and personal attacks. I do hope your "followers" see you for a hedge fund superstar wanna be who
doesn't have the training, analytical mind and integrity to study a company and make decisions based solely on facts.
Disagree with the facts if you will, I respect that. Your writing and its timing show you as a weak person destined for
ultimate failure in this life or beyond. Oh, you might "win" the moment and scare a few uneducated souls to bail and
take profits, but those that really know Kandi, who have met Mr. Hu and trust those that have helped educate many of
us into investing in this company will do very well in the long run. I will actually pray for your soul Richard.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 27/56


The shorts are making an all out effort to drive Kandi down now. Take a look at the inflated asked side quotes. With
such a small float what's happening now is not you or I who are selling out, it's the shorts. It's now or never for them.
They only have 5 1/2 hours left to make money on the puts. What they are not counting on is the options specialist. If
he lets Kandi finish below *6.20 he will lose money. He will not let that happen. I'll cover that a bit later in this
comment.


*The first block of 1803 June 10 Puts were bought at 3.80. The specialist will lose money if the stock goes below 6.20.
Here's the math:


Purchase of June 10 (strike price) puts@3.80. $10 - 3.80 = 6.20


What our major short is doing makes all the sense in the world to me.


Given:


1. He is holding a substantial amount of shorted stock 
(my guess close to 500,000) 
2. For him to short more he is going to have to borrow more shares  
which is proving difficult for him because of the low float,  
and scarcity of shares available to be borrowed. I talked with 
a brokerage friend of mine the beginning part of the and he told  
me that his company has had requests to borrow Kandi stock and  
that they are charging a premium of 20% to do so. 
3. The short doesn't want to do this so he's stuck. So what does he 
do?


My theory:


This is what he did. Instead of borrowing a total amount of an additional 500,000 shares to get out of his position, he
bought about 5000 puts, or more, June22 puts 10's@3.80. In the meantime he gets someone to write a "hit" piece on
Kandi the day of expiration. By doing this he wouldn't have to pay the enormous amount of premium for borrowing the
total amount of stock required for his scheme. He could just watch the results of his "hit" article and win both ways in
his scheme (he thinks). He walks the stock down by putting a big offerings on the sell side which panics the
shareholders and traders and makes money on the short positions he holds and also makes money on the put
options (he thinks).


My prediction: Kandi will not go below 6.20 because that is breakeven for the options specialist so the short won't be
able to cash in on the puts. Once he see this he will start to get out of the puts and then become a buyer of Kandi
stock.


So, if you're weak-kneed you can given into what the short is doing or buy Kandi at an unbelievable discounted
price...your choice.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1514402-what-the-market-missed-on-kandi 28/56


Kandi has already traded below 6.20 today and I do not see $6 as " an unbelievable discounted price"
considering that Kandi was trading below $4 not very long ago. The market makers job is not too protect
whatever profits he may have but to create and orderly market. Keeping the price artificially high in a falling
market would be illegal manipulation on his part. BTW, I do not consider it weak-kneed to double my money in
a stock.


Disclosure: No position


21 Jun 2013, 12:31 PM


Harris Goldman, Contributor
I am not talking about Market Makers here. I am talking about an Options Specialist. There is a difference.
Both do create markets in a figurative sense. The OS, however, controls his market a lot more than the MM.
In the real world the OS is there to make money and not create a market. He controls the bid/asked quotes
any way he wants. The MM, in most cases, doesn't really care which way a stock moves. The OS is basically
the bank in Las Vegas and the option player is the gambler.


Btw, I guess my comment should have been the EOD (end of day) price for the option would not be above
$3.8. That is equal to a stock price of $6.20.


Let's see who's right at the end of the day.


21 Jun 2013, 12:42 PM


Upyourassets
Harris,


Thanks for the clarification. I am not an expert on the specialist market for options, so it would be unwise for
me to argue with you on these points. It kind of makes sense though with some of the ridiculous price
movement and spread action we see in options.


21 Jun 2013, 12:59 PM


Harris Goldman, Contributor
Thanks for your response.


The Options Market is a totally different "animal" from the stock market mainly because it is time limited.
There are many nuances that must be taken into consideration but I will not cover them. Suffice it to say that
once an option expires it is dead forever. June options are officially dead tomorrow but today's final prices are,
in fact, final. As we know the stock market lives on to fight another day....Good Luck!

You are saying the newly started rental garage project in which Kandi indicates it will sell 5-10k cars is the same as

You also imply that Kandi was responsible for the CBAK runup. Show me where Kandi said they were being supplied

I just sent email to Richard Perrson and I think he may lose all his shirts. The following is the email.


You declare that you live in China for a very long period. I think you can read it.


所有炒KNDI的都没意识到KNDI的基本面已... MODEL完全发生了变化。 KNDI在杭州的５年１０万辆租车换电项目，

有布局的天津，成都，上海，海南同样的事情，每做成一个，那么价值就加一倍。


Let me write briefly in English for you.


The Hangzhou rent car project change KNDI fundamental dramatically. After finish the project, KNDI become a rental
car service company in addition of car maker.


KNDI's Hangzhou rent EV car project, the incoming is  
100,000 cars * 1000 RMB/month *12 = 1.2 billion RMB, = $6 per shares yearly


The cost is 28000 RMB, 100, 000 * 28000 RMB / 8 years car life / share, it is less than $0.5 per shares 
Of course, there operation cost, tax cost, all other cost, let us assume it is $3 per share 
So, the Hangzhou project will bring KNDI about $3 income per year.  
Since this income is rent service, for such income, give PE 10-20 is reasonable, so the project bring KNDI potential
value is about $30-$50 per share.


If KNDI get such kind of business in Chengdu, Tianjian, Shanghai, Hainan, any addition project may double the value
of KNDI.

Now that I have time, lets go over your lies one at a time.


"Mr. Porcari's relationship with Kandi dates back at least 6 years to before its reverse merger in 2007. He has
accompanied management on multi-city road shows to introduce them to investors. He has approached the company
to try to raise money for them from his investors. He is in the process of trying to get a brokerage firm to publish
research on the company. Now his investment banking company is also sending out promotional emails on the Kandi.
Mr. Porcari told me by phone that none of this is for business purposes, because he is retired."


I have never accompanied the Company on any road show, and certainly never tried to assist them in raising capital.
Since I am just a retired former broker, I don't have any license or desire to raise money.

To see into KNDI's future I suggest you look at a chart of a similarly manipulated stock - CLNT - except that on paper

in all of my years being a licensed broker, I never once had a client file a lawsuit against me. And that included the
time of the 1987 crash. You see. Unlike you, many people know and respect me because I don't BS them. And I also

"You said."Yet this was actually old news, having been released in 2012. At that time, the original number was 20,000.

It looks like you test drove the Kandi car in the US and not in China. I would think that in all of the research you did
that you would know that the US cars are LSEV and subject to each states maximum speed limits, unlike the cars that
will be sold in China. Since you fail to realize the difference between these vehicles, you not only lost all credibility
with me, but you must have also failed to realize what makes Kandi stand out from the other MIIT approved EVs you
mentioned earlier in your post... QBEX with the State Grids battery underneath the car. Are you trying to say that all
the EV cars on Alibaba will have access to these batteries and garages?  
Now, if you had visited Jinhua and took a spin through their QBEX stations and had something negative to say, the
rest of your article might not be as suspect as it is to me now (sound familiar). Instead what you have done is show
that Kandi is a real company that does sell cars in the US as well as China, much to the chagrin of Sharesleuth.

While this article started off as a potentially interesting bear perspective on Kandi, it quickly deteriorated in quality as I
noticed multiple erroneous claims that the author either failed to research or was ignorant about it.


In your conclusion you write, "Just 2 weeks ago, Kandi was trading at prices of around $3.70. It then doubled to over
$8.00 due to two well timed press releases and four sudden articles from Mr. Porcari. When the stock began to fade
to $6.00, another well timed press release pushed the stock briefly above $8.00 again. But now it is fading again."


In the past two weeks, Mr. Porcari posted one article, exactly two weeks ago on June 7th, not the "four sudden
articles" you claim. The article he posted prior to the June 7th article was on April 29th, roughly EIGHT weeks ago...


It should be noted that following the April 29th article, Kandi's share price stayed the same and then fell as low as
$3.70 a share before surging on June 4th; more than a month after Mr. Porcari's April 29th article.


Towards the end of your article you state, "However swapping batteries during the day is likely to be time consuming
and expensive. I expect most people will try to avoid it if they can."


Please see this video here: http://bit.ly/19aPJbb ; demonstrating Kandi's quick battery exchange. Dare I say, even
faster than Tesla's?

You also completely ignored Kandi's business model and key relationships with the SG and PRC. Referencing
Kandi's EV rental plan (link can be found in Mr. Porcari's April 25th article) Mr. Porcari's says, "This program allows
the lessee to pay a flat monthly sum of 800-1,000 rmb ($129-$150 USD) depending on the EV and have all expenses
covered to include permit, license, tax, insurance, maintenance, free parking, and unlimited free battery exchanges for
the term of the lease"


Regarding Geely's market share and size, please see this link from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers here: http://bit.ly/19aPL2S


In this report the top three automotive manufacturer's for Chinese companies are Dongfeng Motor, Geely, and Beijing
Automotive. It's important to note that Dongfeng Motor and Beijing Automotive only produced 375,805 cars and
33,374 cars respectively (with most of their production stemming from LCV and HCVs), while Geely produced
902,824 cars.


While Geely only has market share of around 3% in recent years, their goal is to increase that 5-6% in 2015 with
approximately 2 million vehicles sold (1.4 million from Geely, 0.6 million from Volvo).


Given that Chinese consumers are favor domestic car companies and are becoming increasingly environmentally
conscious (as per multiple McKinsey studies, here is one: http://bit.ly/19aPJbj), combined with increasing government
incentives for green technologies, I believe Kandi is incredibly well positioned for success in the Chinese marketplace.

Might someone answer the question in the article: "Where is the 80 million usd for the JV going to come from" b/c
thats not clear to me either.


21 Jun 2013, 01:12 PM


Harris Goldman, Contributor
Fair question:


The $80 million requirement of each party to the JV agreement is made up of two components. The first
component is that both parties agree to put up 20% in cash respectively, $16 million, within two months after
the agreement is put in force. The second component is that each can contribute the balance of $64 million,
by mutual agreement, in kind within 2 years.


The cash part of Kandi's contribution to the JV could come from it's remaining $32 miilion dollar credit line or
other sources not specifically named as of yet. It should also be noted that, Kandi has already committed it's
new 100,000 vehicle state of the art manufacturing facility in Wanxiang (sp?) Zhejiang Province to the JV.
They have already reserved the money to be paid for the facility, approx. $43 million +, which you can find
listed on their latest 10Q financials balance sheet.


The way things are set up for Kandi in the near future, re sales, the financial requirements should not be a
problem.


Hope that helps....

Dirk McCoy, Contributor
So please clarify, Harris.... there are $43 MILLION DOLLARS REAL USD sitting in Kandi accounts waiting to
be spent on facilities that will then be contributed to the JV? Or when it says "deposit" on the balance sheet,
does that mean bitcoin or shits and grins or something else?


Because if this is real cash or cash equivalents, then this article may be the most misleading, poorly
researched article I've ever read on SA.


21 Jun 2013, 03:10 PM


Harris Goldman, Contributor
Sorry Dirk that I didn't respond to you earlier. Been a busy day at the OK Corral.


This is "real" cash set aside on the Balance Sheet as of the last 10Q SEC filing on March 25,2013.


I also feel compelled to comment that this article was written in the same style as ones presented by
Sharesleuth on SA re Kandi. Maybe the author has adopted their style, or probably it's simply just mere
coincidence. All I know is that both styles are long and tedious, coupled with self serving innuendo and
falsehoods...La Cage Aux Folles.


What made me just a wee bit suspicious as to his real agenda is that the author hasn't responded to any of
the numerous requests for "discussion" regarding his "facts". I am going to suggest to SA that authors must
respond to legitimate comments made by people who read their articles. Make it mandatory, and if not
adhered to remove their articles and ban them from publishing again. That seems not only fair but just. One of
SA's mandates, if it is not already put in place, would be to expose the truth tellers from the fabricators. If an
author attacks individuals and or companies they should be held accountable. Nobody on this site should be
given free license to do otherwise.


So, as the song goes, "where are you Joe DiMaggio, Jesus loves you more.....da da da da". Don't be shy
author, come out and play with your peers. We're easy to get along with if you would only talk to us.

Jens- $38,644,613, or almost half of the $80 million has already been put up (really put in reserve since the
JV had not closed by the March 30 cut-off date on that 10Q) by KNDI as can be seen, (though ignored by the
writer and other ignorant pundits) in the Balance Sheet Line Item called "Deposit for acquisition" in the recent
10Q. See page 3 at this link:


http://1.usa.gov/19qUydf


In actuality, under China Corporate law, the parties have two years to put up their "stated capital" plus it does
not have to be all cash, pertinent assets will do.

The 20,000 arrangement is a LEASING program for 1+ years, heavily subsidized (low monthly payment, free QBEX,
free service -- and 6,000 on the waiting list in the first few months after announcement). Just waiting for the PRC
subsidy policy to be announced.


The 5,000 agreement is the first installment of the RENTAL program (short term, by hour or day or week). This is the
program using the garages, now under construction in Hangzhou.


Surely you didn't conflate those two contracts deliberately to concoct a negative out of an amazingly huge positive
prospect for this company. Surely not! Must have just been confused by all the good news over the last year. And I
guess you just forgot to mention the three factories under construction, the cities currently negotiating to be part of the
rental program, and the fact that the Panda model that just got approved will be manufactured by the JV with Kandi
(50% interest). I know... there are just too many positives to keep them all straight.

Pretty thorough and damning analysis, I'm surprised the stock isn't down more today.


Seems like common sense together with looking at their R&D budget should tell you that there's no way they could
have developed a game changing EV that could even begin to legitimately be compared to TSLA.


21 Jun 2013, 02:02 PM


DWD Investing, Contributor
Well, Arthur has replied to my post stating that it's not EV tech but the overall KNDI business model that
makes him Bull. However, unless TSLA's business model is similar to KNDI's, then there is no similarity. At
that point I'd say Arthur is just name dropping.


Just so there is no confusion, what I am saying is that in order to fairly compare TSLA and KNDI, at least one
thing needs to be similar--either the tech or the business model, or both. Otherwise, you might as well be
comparing China's navy with USA's navy, based on the fact they both have navies.

Impressive, and pretty entertaining reading. It should knock a few of the newbies back out of the stock for a while.
However, all of the long term holders like myself, who have all of the information you deliberately left out of this piece,
just use days like this to buy more shares. I must say though, hit pieces from shorts do make investing a little more
exciting. It feels like a battle between good and evil almost, and by the way you spun this story I have decided you are
on the evil side.

The problem with your logic is that you assume there's a reason for KNDI to come back. This is an undistinguished
'nother electric car company like the dozens besides it that are still hanging on before exiting on the last train to
Chapter 11. The only difference is that KNDI has an excellent pump operations that's allowing it to grab money from
the US street in order to forestall their demise by a year or two.

Companies that go BK usually have negative book value, negative earnings, and don't form partnerships with
companies like Geely and get orders from municipalities. None of that applies here.


People looking to drive a stock lower usually mislead, provide incomplete analysis, and engage in ad
hominem attacks. All of that seems to apply here.

The market didn't miss anything. Most investors who do not have Multi Millions or and Billions do not have money to
specualte on the CHINESE being HONEST. There are hundreds of companies failing its shareholders.


The market already has has no faith in the US Companies, brokers and believe there to be collusion at all levels or
seriously suspects it with confirmation daily.


LIBOR 
Jon Corzine $1.6B, SENATOR AND CONGRESSMEN

So many examples but you get the point.


There is no trust here in America regarding its market and now to ask the investors to have trust in a Chinese
company to do right by its shareholders would be naive.


You should be writing about articles on the 100's of Chinese companies that are failing to do right by their investor
instead of playing "the game" which we have come to know as "stealing our money".

I’m sure you spent numerous days researching and writing this article. 
Now many investors have taken a lot of their time to comment and contest many of the statement you’ve put forth –
we need to hear a rebuttal from you. 
Normally, SA authors add their own comments to defend their work and their pride. 
I am a serious investor – who tries to do sufficient DD before investing – which I have done three fold on Kandi. I have
invested a good deal of my account in long positions on Kandi equity at this point. 
Investing is serious stuff – it’s supplement income in some cases and determines the size of our retirement accounts.


So, I am pleading with you to respond to the many challenges to you statements that have been made so far.


Now, We NEED to Hear from YOU!

Rocky,


When I invest in tech it's based on two things: Business model and technology. If one is lacking, there is a
problem, but I always look for the technology side first. What superior tech does KNDI have?


So, given it doesn't have any, it's gotta be the business model, and KNDI is impressive in that area. And, the
CEO is deeply invested in his company too. So that shows me he is motivated to make it work.


I don't think KNDI is a sham, but KNDI technology almost makes me laugh. Still, once the business model is
in place, there is nothing stopping KNDI from using better "me too" technology.


As such, KNDI is high spec and going in so much might have been more wish than fact.

First of all, Kandi EV market is in China. The QBEX (from the side of the car) is heavily patented personally
by Mr. Hu (the CEO) and he donated all of them to Kandi. This QBEX from the side is definitely what the PRC
want. Most of the existing QBEX in China (other than Kandi) is from the trunk, where there is basically no
hard barrier between the passengers and the battery. The explosion case on Zotye Taxi EV car has basically
shifted PRC tendency to the technology that Kandi have. That is one of the disruptive technology that
protected by several Chinese patents. Chinese patents by Chinese in China tells us the high moat Kandi
have.

Hi geleng, 
Thanks for posting. It sounds like you are quite familiar with Kandi - so, I hope you keep posting on the SA

I'd like to hear more about how solid patents are in China - when it's a Chinese company doing business in
China that holds them. In that case are patents respected and dependable for the most part? for instance,
Should KNDI's multiple patents on the QBEX act as an effective moat? 
Thanks.

25 Jun 2013, 06:55 PM

One more lie, and this you cannot be excused from since you claim you are an Investment banker:


"On April 25th, Kandi filed an "ATM" registration statement under which it can sell up to $60 million of equity "from
time to time" in the market. No investment bank is needed, only brokerage firms. Reporting can be done much later
such that investors won't even know it is happening. Yet given the low price and volume at the time, such an offering
would have been impossible."


Just to be sure since it has been over 25 years since I was one myself, I checked with two different Securities
Attorneys who state that you are totally wrong about S3 offerings being an ATM offering. One gave me this reference:


"When a specific offering is planned, a prospectus  
supplement that describes the terms of the offering  
normally must be filed with the SEC under Rule 424(b) 
within two days of the supplement’s first use or the  
determination of the offering price, whichever is earlier.  
In most cases, the prospectus supplement is filed after  
the takedown has already priced.


As you can see, they would have to file with the SEC within two days. Something that I am very sure you were aware
of when you wrote this piece.


Doing a re-read of your worthless piece, the way it is written strikes me that you have been short this stock since it
was below $4. Since you picked today to do this, I assume you are short by way of options. I hope you were not as
gullible as those morons who sold due to your article without you covering your short earlier today. KNDI is real, and
its intelligent audience has been growing dramatically, it will win. You will lose.

It's true that companies, including Chinese companies, will spin numbers- they'd probably say they learned it from us,
see: Jack Welch; and the spin can get away from them, see: Jon Corzine.


But it's also true that the Chinese want to lead and not follow and know that they'll never do that with a sullied
reputation. And it wasn't so long ago I awoke in Beijing to read in the morning paper that a middle manager had been
executed for embezzlement.

So true, so true! Those Chinese reverse-merger frauds did not happen people! Those were stories planted in the

they got caught that they would never take a chance on something corrupt or illegal. Not for all the tea in China.

of the articles about how Tesla could not succeed - how it wasn't worth what it is? That was when it was down in the
20's and 30's, and see where it is now! Looks like a similar time, here, has come along with Kandi.

Rocky mountain- I suspect I know why he is so silent. After speaking with interested legal counsel yesterday
afternoon, what Pearson did here went beyond that thin line that most attack writers know not to cross. He
didn't just give innuendo of possible problems with the target company which makes it hard to bring legal
action, he clearly "created" his own facts out of his own fiction and stated the fiction as fact, rather than couch
his comments as "opinion" like most smart attack writers do. And forget about what he has said about me, I
have been similarly personally attacked with the same 25 year old SEC Finra stuff on a half dozen KNDI
attack articles over the past three years, and as you can see, I am still around writing under my own name
and publishing my phone number for anyone to contact; where he screwed up big time is totally disregarding
facts that were in his possession about the company, and replaced them with facts best suited for his
immediate agenda.


Where he has a particular problem is that he claims to have been a licensed trader and investment banker,
yet he has made claims regarding SEC rules, such those regarding S3 filings that are totally incorrect, making
even the SEC look like an errant keeper of investors trust. If his stated background is correct, he cannot claim
"ignorant investor" as a defense.


I know and have known this as fact for decades as a former licensed investment broker/banker. That is why
when I write publicly I make sure my facts are correct and give backup links when ever possible to pertinent
references.


Yes, I had a run-in with the SEC in the 1980's as he properly stated over a stock my firm was behind that hurt
a number of short sellers severely. I will give you two guesses who complained about me to the SEC
regarding that NASDAQ stock going up ten fold in a few months. But if you read the SEC claim against me at
the link he provided, you will note that I did agree to settle with the SEC after fighting the case for seven yeard
and spending six digits on attorneys. What was my penalty from the SEC? Read the settlement. It was
nothing, no fine, no penalty, just a promise that I would be less aggressive in the future. (sorry to say, while I
spent six digits of my own money fighting that case, the taxpayer probably spent ten times that much keeping
that case alive.)


BTW, regarding the insider trading accusation he made against me, once again shows how little he cares for
accuracy. While this FINRA incident was filed against my firm as a "possible" insider trading violation, we
were cleared of that charge but subsequently settled years later after we already sold the firm and left the
business for a inconsequential "records keeping" violation. (I apologize for the CAPS below, as this is a direct
copy and paste from the order he gave you the link to) If he would have taken the time to read the whole link

reference as to what a bad guy I am, he would have seen this, but then that would not have suited his
agenda.


Copied from the FINRA Order (NASD at that time)


THE PURCHASES ON DECEMBER 12 AND 17 WERE MADE AT A TIME WHEN NEITHER PORCARI NOR
FEARNOW WERE IN POSSESSION OF INSIDE INFORMATION. THE 9,800 SHARES WHICH WERE
PURCHASED ON DECEMBER 23 WERE ACQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE PRE-EXISTING
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE MARKET MAKER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WHETHER OR
NOT THE RESPONDENTS HAD ANY MATERIAL, NON-PUBLIC, INFORMATION CONCERNING THE
POSSIBLE MERGER.


THE FINDINGS THAT THE RESPONDENTS VIOLATED ARTICLE III, SECTION 1 OF THE RULES OF FAIR
PRACTICE IS BASED SOLELY ON THE RESPONDENTS' FAILURE, AFTER THEY HAD ARRANGED FOR
A MEETING BETWEEN THE ZIM AND PETR REPRESENTATIVES, TO NOTIFY THE MARKET MAKER
THAT THE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE PURCHASE OF PETR STOCK HAD BEEN TERMINATED. THE
FINDINGS THAT PFA VIOLATED ARTICLE III, SECTIONS 1 AND 27 OF THE RULES OF FAIR PRACTICE
IS BASED UPON THE FAILURE OF THE RESPONDENTS TO HAVE ADOPTED WRITTEN PROCEDURES
FOR PFA WHICH WOULD HAVE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED THEM TO TERMINATE ANY SUCH
EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS.


THE COMMITTEE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE TERMINATION OF THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS
WOULD ONLY HAVE AFFECTED THE PURCHASE AND RESALE OF PFA OF THE 9,800 SHARES BY
THE MARKET MAKER ON DECEMBER 23, 1985, SINCE PFA WAS ALREADY OBLIGATED TO
PURCHASE THE 5,000 SHARES WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE MARKET MAKER
ON DECEMBER 17.


(I am almost embarrassed to admit, the shares spoken about in the above action were trading at $.30 a
share. Yes, lots of legal money wasted on both sides over less than $5000 in stock :-)


Bottom line in what I am trying to say here is that if he has a half smart attorney, he has likely been advised to
keep his mouth shut because he has already said too much.

An Update.... 
- The Author (Richard Pearson) DID respond to my direct message.....His reply was polite and friendly.


Here are the main things in his message: 
1) He feels that KNDI could go through the same thing that CLNT just went through. Specifically, the company may
pump up the stock price and then sell additional common shares at a materially discount share price versus the
"pumped up" share price. Which would drive the share price down. 
He added that CLNT also took out a big amount ($500,000) for commissions and expenses.


2) He feels that KNDI investors are being distracted by the sexy car story and are ignoring what matters more -
namely, the games that Kandi may be playing to raise money.


He hasn't had a chance to respond to the comments yet (he's currently on vacation).


I'm just passing the information along to everyone - hope it helps.


21 Jun 2013, 10:31 PM


Arthur Porcari, Contributor
RockyMtn- Was that a copy and past from his message or did you paraphrase his response?


If that was his actual response to you; don't you find it a bit strange that the morning of options expiration, he
was adamant that the Company had already done the financing and its cars are bogus, but now that
expiration is over and the stock went through another round of fireworks, he says:


"Specifically, the company may pump up the stock price and then sell additional common shares at a
materially discount share price versus the "pumped up" share price. Which would drive the share price down."


Even his second comment should sound strange, but I must admit partially true. KNDI does have a "sexy car
story" and is likely what caused the stock to take off, but isn't that what people are buying TSLA for? A sexy
car story? They certainly aren't buying it on historic earnings. And while I do not believe KNDI is raising any
money to expand their sexy car story, TSLA sure did and had the stock go up after.


But what is most incredible, he decides to go on vacation the day after he put out his hit piece? Hmm. Maybe
he was smarter than I thought and did cover his short while he was scaring out investors. That's why he can
now afford a vacation.


Amazing, Just Amazing how some snake oil salesman like Pearson can sucker ignorant investors into selling
with just one fairy tale, and I put out 17 articles on KNDI totally over 300 typed pages in the past three year
full of fact verified with back-up links, and I couldn't get the stock price past $4 and I am the "bad actor".

Arthur - In my comment above - I was Paraphrasing the message I received from Richard Pearson. At that
moment I thought I would just summarize a couple of points he had made - giving HIM another day to
personally respond to some of the eloquent and fact based challenges made here in the comments section of
his article.


But, Richard still has not personally responded to any of the many comments made here. So......... 
Here's the full message I got from him........

Hi Rocky,


Thanks for the email.


I don't always get a chance to respond to all of the comments on the board. Often there are so many frivolous
ones. But I always make it a point to write back to anyone who emails me directly.


If you want to see what will happen to KNDI, take a look at CLNT today.


They have been at about $5.50 - $11.00 for the past month, but they sold about 25% of the company @
$4.50, then they took out $500,000 for commissions and expenses.


The KNDI story is less about EV's and more about what games they are playing in order to raise money. Yet
people are so distracted by the sexy car story that they are ignoring what matters more.


Thanks for taking the time to write.


It sounds like this is an important position to you.


If you'd care to chat by phone, I'd be happy to.


I will also try to get to those comments over the weekend if I have time...but I'm supposed to be on vaca right
now.


Have a good weekend. Hope we can chat soon.

responding ... where is his computer? And how did he find time to write the whole thing in the first place?!!!
How convenient, the timing. This explanation sounds about as fishy as the "facts" in his article.

Are you saying the main reason people are buying TSLA is the same reason people are buying KNDI? If so,
please show us some similarities besides the fact they both have "sexy cars."

Renmycat!
heres a little tip.. dont invest in the trash companies that richard pearson writes about!! simple.. these companies are
all sketchy, maybe engage in fraudulent activity.. just too many red flags, and its so easy to spin a story based on
what one investor thinks..


richard pearson has done nothing wrong, he has stated ideas as he sees them, he didnt make anyone sell their
shares. thats too bad that others did, but if you are sooo confident about this company, sell the farm and invest
EVERYTHING in it. Now that tons of shares have been sold short.. come on create a squeeze. you will make tons of
money by this in the end.


Richard Pearsons article has given you a great entry point..if this sounds good, then quit whining. if you are long term
investor, heres a ticket to wealth. thanks for the article Richard.. disclosure: no position in KNDI, closed my short
position in CLNT.  
and small cap chinese companies are not the place where you should be dabbling too big, dont invest more than you
can afford to lose.

Last year Kandi had order to supply cars, some (I think 5000) by Dec2012 and 15000 during 2013. I did not see press
release from KNDI that it shipped cars by end of 2012. So i sold my shares early this year. Can someone tell me how
many cars were shipped or sold and when?


This will help me more than anything. Thanks


21 Jun 2013, 10:42 PM

Read the 10Q and 10K to see how many thousands of EV's they've sold. The Leasing program contract you
refer to (20K cars) was delayed by the expiration of the previous national subsidy program and will begin
shipments as soon as the new subsidy program is announced by the PRC (with weeks). It had the same
effect on ALL Chinese EV makers, with buyers waiting for subsidies to purchase any EV in China.
Independent press reports say there's a waiting list of >6,000 customers for the Hangzhou leasing program,
supplied by KNDI.


Since you sold your shares KNDI has opened two new factories with production capacity >100K units/yr each,
including one that's a JV with Geely which will supply the new municipal transit systems based on mini-
LSEV's. A third factory, in Hainan, should begin production next spring. That's production capacity of

300K/year at this time! Do you think there might be a reason the company has built so much capacity? Could
it be that these agreements with 6+ cities and provinces are real?


You've missed a lot of exciting news, not the least of which is construction of the first smart EV parking garage
in Hangzhou. Do you think the city of Hangzhou is building an EV rental garage to leave it empty? It's
designed to hold KNDI mini-LSEV's.


Thanks to Mr. Pearson and his short-seller friends, you can still buy back KNDI at half of what it will be worth
by year end.


21 Jun 2013, 11:28 PM


Arthur Porcari, Contributor
RAJS- Sorry to hear you sold your shares too early. While they did not sell the full 5000 by year end through
no fault of theirs, they did sell 3919 EV's for the full year, and 2909 in the fourth quarter. I might add, both
numbers exceed TSLA's tally.


If you want the full explanation why they missed the 5000, I explain it thoroughly in a Seeking Alpha article I
wrote on April 25. Here is the link.

Richard, If I had shorted this stock I would be losing some serious sleep tonight, so I hope you covered.


I've been following Kandi for about three years now and can tell you that the company has gone through the most
detailed reviews looking for some chink in the armor that I have ever seen. Most of the seasoned investors in this
issue won't be phased.


I've learned that it is easy to scare people out of an investment. And I must give you credit for your attempt as it
shows much work on your part. But it also shows that you ignored many relevant facts which throws or skews any real
consideration of balance that would drive any long term movement.


Ever heard of the boy who cried wolf too many times?


Kandi Investors have.

Interesting photos. The vehicle depicted is the COCO, a Low Speed Electric Vehicle being marketed primarily to
retirement and golfing communities in the U.S. such as the Villages in Florida. The photos shown were taken in the
USA - the signage is in English. The COCO is NOT equipped with the QBX feature. The author properly described the
limited trunk space in THIS vehicle, but this is NOT what is projected to be sold in mass in the Chinese market.

There seem to be a lot of similarities in the twenty plus articles this author has written. 
1) He chooses a thinly traded stock (easier to move the pps) 
2) Timing of release is consistently near market open (investors must react) 
3) The articles are unduly lengthy (investors can't get through it and must just react) 
4) Most any point that CAN be spun negatively - IS. 
5) His position is always short.


Take a look for yourself - I've made mistakes before - tell me if I'm giving the guy a bum rap?


Overall I have been quite impressed with the quality of authorship on SA. Of course, I don't agree with some of the
opinions authors make - but, most every author makes it clear as to what is fact and what is an opinion.


But, I thought that SA had higher standards in place to make sure that articles published where require to be relatively
fair and balanced? If there are actually no such SA standards - then I guess SA is kind of just a gloried Stock chat
room, where most anything goes?

I think you are. An article can at best move a stock temporarily but in the end, as you well know, stocks are a weighing
machine, ie- it don't matter. But as a matter of fact two other Chinese stocks that Pearson has panned; CLNT and
CBAK, have turned out to be enduring and profitable shorts. If there were real value behind their numbers CLNT
wouldn't be trading at <cough, cough> 2x earnings.


We've been sold on every kind of supposed Chinese pot of gold only to find out too late that there was fraud and
corruption and misdealings beyond belief that belied the story they were selling western investors.


Beyond pervasive corruption there's the problem of a massive credit bubble in China (see this week's Barrons), and a
systemic misallocation of resources into overproduction (see every single Chinese solar PV maker), add a chorus of
vociferous and pugnacious promoters of this stock, and I would run from a company like this.


These Chinese reverse-mergers have turned out to be a new phenomenal wealth-extraction machine.

It's not fair to attribute all the faults and flaws of the Chinese economy to one small company that is not party
to or even impacted by those macro conditions.


Tesla was gestated during the worst US economic climate in 50 years, in a state that was bankrupt. Why can't
a Chinese company with a founder/CEO of highest integrity, intellect and experience, that has products and
patents which are in demand (one could say China is even desperate for urban, affordable, low speed EV's),
that has excellent financial condition, including current profits, that is well-connected in the auto industry and
government, that has existing agreements with State Grid, several top battery makers, Geely, and six major
municipal regions that would produce quintuple it's current revenue in two years..... why can't this company
succeed in spite of the generic macro conditions you describe? It can, and it will.

Arthur Porcari, it should be noted, is hardly as pure as the driven snow. A simple Google search of his name will
reveal several problematic ethical entanglements he has experienced in the past.


Question for Mr. Porcari: Can you please divulge your interest in Stone Mountain, and Stone Mountain's interest in
this stock?


23 Jun 2013, 01:06 PM


Harris Goldman, Contributor
Mercury - Question for you:


Since you are making a rather round about inference that Mr Porcari had some direct interest in the RTO, why
don't you come out like a "big boy" and say something which we, as Kandi investors, don't know about yet.
Come on now, fess up.....


I have come to the point when I read comments that smell of a "witch hunt", without any justification, people
should be called out as I am doing to you now. This article should have been strictly about Kandi and not Mr.
Porcari. But you, like the author, want to divert our attention because Kandi is going to cause you and the
author to lose a lot of money; lots of pain. It should also be noted that "baiters" such as yourself never have
anything substantive to add to any discussion...you certainly didn't disappoint....just bait and switch is your
MO...


Btw, I know of Mr. Porcari's history with the SEC. In fact, Mr. Porcari has explained his problem many times to
guys like you, but you still have this "cuteness" about you to bring it up once again. ...Much ado about
nothing. And, if you have unearthed some new development, that we are not aware of, tell us what it is. And,
don't hide behind that Mercury Value moniker you conveniently use.Stand up and be counted just like I do. My
name is real and so is Mr. Porcari's.


More specifically, what "several problematic ethical entanglements" has he been involved in. I know of one
that was ridiculous on it's merits. Enlighten me as to what others you are referring to.....Only then can we
have less deceitful comments, with transparently alternative agendas, re Mr. Porcari's problems. Maybe we
can discuss who you are too? Or maybe, just maybe, we can intelligently discuss Kandi.


23 Jun 2013, 06:23 PM

Mr. Porcari seems to be dramatically understanding the extent of his troubles. It is not "much ado about
nothing." He is a disgraced broker who has been sanctioned by final regulatory action from FINRA. All of this
is publicly available information. It's 2013, baby. No hiding from Google.


"...The Commission found that in in or about September 1989, Porcari was retained by the Cedar Group, Inc
to engage in financial public relations activities. The Commission further found that, in his efforts to bring
about a short squeeze in Cedar's securities, Porcari made predictions, without a reasonable basis, to

registered representatives that Cedar's stock price would rise to specified levels within specified periods of
time. Also, the Commission found that Porcari advised groups of registered representatives to purchase
specified amounts of Cedar's securities simultaneously in order to raise the market price of those securities."

And there seems to be more outstanding, there are also questions relating to a company called OMDA dating
back to 1985.


Now, as for me, I am in no way involved in this stock long or short and indeed never heard of the company
before Pearson's article. I am always interested in observing and speaking out about potentially fraudulent
actions.


Can Mr. Porcari divulge his interest in Stone Mountain, and Stone Mountain's interest in this stock?

This article was well researched about Kandi Technologies. It is quite obvious that all the negative responses are from
long shareholders that believe the "hype" story trying to compare this company to Tesla. There is no remote chance
this is even true. We have seen this china "shell" company scheme many times before. The PR firm is really trying to
move the stock based upon headlines. The balance sheet of this company needs to looked at by the SEC. Something
doesn't seem right!

I have printed out these comments and will be looking through them in the next few days.


There are obviously quite a few mistaken comments above, so I probably won't respond to all of them.


I would suggest that people re-read the article and be sure to actually click the links so as to read the filings that I
referenced.


Given the number of comments, I will likely write another full article on Kandi rather than trying to debate point by
point with many people who made their minds up before even reading the article.


You are all certainly entitled to your opinions, and you are certainly entitled to continue buying Kandi stock.


Eventually the stock will either rise or fall on its own merits. So if you are confidant in your thesis then whatever I
uncover and write about should be of no concern to you in the longer run.

Please include all the positives you left out of your first article in the next one. Focus on the company and it's
unique urban mini-bus marketing, it's patented robotic 'quick battery exchange', and it's new factories coming
online soon. Or at least mention them!! A well-rounded analysis will give you so much more credibility. If the
company is as good as some think, what does it matter if one promoter is touting it! Unless of course you
have a specific agenda that isn't about the company as an investment at all....

But wait, there's more.


"In addition to posting information about Kandi on stock message boards under the nicknames “corstrat” and
“tchauncy,” Porcari is one of the moderators of a private forum set up to counter negative information about the
company.


Porcari maintains that he has never been compensated by Kandi for his promotional activities. But our investigation
found that he has longstanding financial ties to some of the other people who helped package Stone Mountain for the
reverse merger.


In fact, those ties are closer than he has disclosed in his Internet posts.


We found that Porcari had been involved with Logan Anderson, one of Stone Mountain’s shareholders, in another
company that went public a few years before Kandi."

Mr. Pearson,


I hope by stating 'mistaken comments' you are referencing your own falsehoods and inaccuracies rather than the
ones from the investors commenting on this article.


There are many investors here who have taken the time to reply to your article with links to multiple sources proving
your inaccuracies, and yet you proclaim the same ignorance as your detractors; telling them to re-read your article
and look at the links you posted...Very professional....


Personally I am very open-minded about investments and enjoy reading both bull and bear theses. This article was
simply not quality work given the multitude of misinformation you are spreading and refusal to debate the
counterpoints made by the commenting investors.


It seems you have also "made up your mind" on this company with no desire to have an intelligent discussion based
on the omitted merits of Kandi.

The stock doubled over a 2 week period since early June, from $3.70. However the timing of Mr. Porcari's 4 articles
began in April, right after the ATM filing, not in June. This can be seen by looking at the dates on the articles, and is
consistent with the text in the body of the article.


That sentence has now been split in two in the conclusion.

Kandi Technologies Provides Updates to Its Shareholders


JINHUA, China, June 24, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (the 'Company' or 'Kandi')
(KNDI), stated today that it has come to the Company's attention that a recent online article, published by a short
seller, contains inaccurate and misleading information about our Company. While the Company firmly stands by its
disclosures in its filings with the SEC, we are taking this opportunity to clarify certain issues as follows:


1. Kandi's $25 Million Debt/Note Payable.


As we have described clearly in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2013 (the "10-Q"), by issuing
bank notes payable rather than paying cash to suppliers, the Company can defer the payments until the date the bank
notes payable are due. Simultaneously, the Company deposits restricted cash in banks to back the bank notes
payable, and the restricted cash deposited in banks generates interest income. On December 24th and 25th, 2012,
the Hangzhou Branch of Ping An Bank issued 140 million RMB (approximately $22 million) notes payable to the
Company due on June 24th and 25th, 2013, as disclosed in our 10-Q. The Company deposited restricted cash of 50
million RMB (approximately $8 million) to Ping An Bank as collateral when the notes were issued. The Company re-
paid 140 million RMB (approximately $22 million) notes in full on June 6th, 2013 and June 19th, 2013, and the
Hangzhou Branch of Ping An Bank has also re-financed 150 million RMB (approximately $24 million) with new short
term notes payable of $6 million and $18 million to the Company due on December 6th and December 19th, 2013
respectively. Simultaneously, the Company deposits restricted cash of 60 million RMB (approximately $9.6 million) to
the bank as collateral. As we have indicated in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks, this is a common practice for the Company in
conducting its normal business; using rolling notes payable from the banks, which the Company's good credit makes
possible, allows us to optimize the use of our cash flow.


The remaining $3 million short term bank loan referenced in the article is a loan from Shanghai Pudong Development
Bank issued on June 27, 2012 and becomes due on June 27, 2013. The Company has already arranged the

repayment of the loan on June 25, 2013 and has negotiated its renewal by way of a new loan in the same amount
and received approval from Shanghai Pudong Development Bank for such new loan.


2. The Shelf Registration Statement (S-3). 
On April 19th, 2013, the Company filed a $ 60 million Universal Shelf Registration Statement (S-3) with the SEC
which became effective on May 23, 2013. The shelf registration did not include the registration of any shares for an
offering nor a prospectus for an offering of any shares. When a specific offering is planned, a prospectus supplement
that describes the terms of the offering will be filed with the SEC under Rule 424(b) within two days of the
supplement's first use or the determination of the offering price, whichever is earlier. A shelf registration statement (S-
3) is authorized by the SEC under rule 415 allowing a single registration statement to be filed by certain qualified
issuers which permit public offering of multiple securities for up to three years. In a shelf registration, securities usually
are registered for sale either on a continuous or delayed basis. However, the Company's current S-3 registration is
not an "At the Market" or "ATM" offering as described in the short seller's article as: "Kandi's S-3 filing is known as an
"At the Money" registration statement." We believe the short seller either lacks basic knowledge of securities
regulation or simply releasing misleading information to the investing public.


The Company filed a similar shelf S-3 registration statement with the SEC on November 19, 2009 which became
effective December 24, 2009. Almost one year after that S-3 registration statement became effective, on December
21, 2010, the Company raised approximately $16 million with a shelf take down. On the same day, the Company filed
with the SEC a Form 8-K to disclose the transaction with purchase agreement attached


(http://1.usa.gov/176Fd0D) as well as a prospectus supplement to the shelf S-3 Registration Statement
(http://1.usa.gov/176Fd0F).


Subsequently, the 2009 S-3 registration statement expired in December, 2012.


"Being one of very few Chinese electric vehicle (the "EV") companies publicly traded on NASDAQ, we are very
excited about the tremendous growth potential of our EV offering and innovative business model in China,"
commented by Mr. Hu Xiaoming, Chairman & CEO of the Company. "As we continue to build a solid foundation for
our long term growth, we care deeply to protect the interest of our shareholders. While we have always welcomed
suggestions and constructive criticism from all parties, we will also defend ourselves against inaccurate and
misleading accusations or any attempt to manipulate our stock price."


I rest my case (at least on this board)

The company has released the above press release. 
Apparently, your article was so inaccurate and misleading to investors that the company has issued this press release
- specifically to refute key points made in you article.


As I understand it, It is very rare (and maybe even unprecedented) that the company would take the time to respond
and refute the statements made in a published article.

So, you may want to be a little more careful of what you state as fact about a company. I know you like to prey on
companies that are thinly traded - but, just because they're thinly traded - doesn't mean that won't fight back.


Here's Kandi's press release:

Author’s reply »  Rocky,


Your "understanding" is clearly not good.


I have had much more forceful responses from other companies, some of which occurred shortly before they
were delisted due to outright fraud.


You are no longer evaluating facts and circumstances. You are simply trying to use your imagination to shape
events to fit your already anchored beliefs.


The fact that the company chose to raise exactly the amount I said just 2 days after that press release should
leave you congratulating me. But I don't expect that.


I offered to speak with you by phone, but you have no interest.


You seem to feel like you are far more informed that I. As I said before, if I thought that this stock would go up,
I would be buying big. You may wish to consider whether or not you really have an advantage with this stock
in terms of your experience, your knowledge and your understanding.


Do you really believe that a group of retail investors posting news articles on Yahoo boards is the deepest
pool of knowledge ?


Good luck with your investment.


We will touch base again in a few months and see who was right.


If I am wrong, I will publicly apologize and you can quote this post. .If you are wrong, then I expect nothing
more than a private apology

It's hardly rare that a company looking to raise capital would, in coordination with their US spokesman Porcari, jointly
respond to anything that might get in the way of this pump operation.


But if you want to take anything a company, much less Chinese, says on face value you're more than welcome to lose
your money that way. I'll just try to position myself in the general vicinity of wherever you're throwing it.

Multicat, 
The company's press release clearly refutes Pearson's claims of imminent insolvency. This was a very serious and
misleading statement to make - and it did scare away some of KNDI's less knowledgeable investors. But, the fact is -
This company's progress, current activities and future prospects are very strong - and there are are a lot of very
knowledgeable and active KNDI investors. 
So, Richard's hit piece - as misleading and unethical as it was - had a negligible affect on Friday's share price - in
spite of massive coordinated short seller efforts.


I have a feeling that the "for hire short writers" will be moving on the easier prey going forward.

ATM, or technically BTM, just spit out $26M plus 50% warrant coverage. Nice to see institutional investor interest in
China again, but IMO they are overpaying.

DWD Investing, Contributor
That's what I think too. Overpriced. I would consider KNDI a personal spec for sure, but not at current price.
Pigs get slaughtered.

I went back and wrote down a list of all of the authors who have written an SA article on Kandi. Along with the number
of articles they've written and total number of comments. Then, separated the authors into Groups - Long Kandi and
Short Kandi.


Here are the results with the Ratio of comments per articles written calculated.


Authors Long Kandi Articles Comments Ratio 
Harris Goldman 3 47 15.7 
Aurthor Porcari 18 456 25.3 
Dirk McCoy 19 600 31.6 
Perry Coleman 13 552 42.5 
Marc Chang 5 101 20.2 
Totals for Longs 58 1,756 30.3


Authors Short Kandi 
Richard Pearson 34 53 1.6

ShareSleuth 6 3 0.5 
The Geo Team 112 311 2.8 
Totals for Shorts 152 367 2.4


Now - keep in mind - the data is for ALL articles and comments made by each author. Not just articles or comments
on Kandi. 
(Note: this is the only data available). Data is based on the SA website on 7/18/13 at 3PM.


Well it seems my intuition was right this time...... Long authors have written 30.3 comments per article while short
authors have only written 2.4 comments per article they've written.


So, I'd like to hear from some of the readers now.... 
- Are these numbers surprising? 
- Why is there such a disparity? 
- Why aren't the short writers writing more comments? Should it be "required" that authors respond to legitimate
challenges?


18 Jul 2013, 06:06 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
I believe the disparity in author comments is due to the nature of the shareholdings. Geo and Sharesleuth
likely had no position at all. Pearson's position was short term. But the bullish reports were written by very
long term investors in support of a company and investment position they are very committed to.

Perry Coleman, Contributor
I think the point is that it's easier to support facts than innuendo and twisted truths.


If you only tell half the story and someone asks you about the other half, there is no benefit in responding.


You say that "Geo and Sharesleuth likely had no position at all". Do you think that they wrote their articles as
a public service?


20 Jul 2013, 11:28 AM


Mukticat
While the articles actually are able to move markets - and we've had an equal balance of long and short ones
- this focus on who comments and posts is a red herring. I'm convinced it has negligible effect on the way
KNDI is trading.


I'm kind of surprised that a well-known short would take a long position in KNDI at 5.00. The news alone was
good for a 30c spike. I wish you luck if you think that KNDI can break through a thick overhang of secondary
sellers and retail bagholders. Playing with sharp sticks was all fun and games on the way up . . . . until
someone gets hurt. Picture an army of half-blinded traders looking for someone to pull their stick out and stick
it in their own eye.


From the sidelines I'm with Pearson and ShareSleuth on this one.

KNDI was just a trade. I stopped out after reading, and re-reading the Sharesleuth reports. I've done no DD
on KNDI.

frellgem
I'm reassured that you're aware of KNDI and impartially looking at both sides. Allowing for the bumps that all
early stage growth companies have, it's a rare opportunity that small investors shouldn't be scared out of
without good reason. None of the negative articles so far has revealed a good reason -- just the usual bumps
in the road that all high-growth disruptive marketing models have to take. Acquisitions have already
telegraphed by mgmt in the shelf reg, and they'll surely issue more stock along the way, but behind that will
be sales in the tens of thousands of units, starting soon, both from KNDI and from the 50% JV. There is
vulnerability in this pre-shipping stage which the shorts are smartly exploiting, but the second half of 2013 will
make shorting KNDI more difficult. In the short term ANY stock is a shorting opportunity, but for those of us
who don't mind riding those waves, being on board before the funds and large volume sales is perfect timing.
The profitable legacy recreational vehicle business makes the downside minimal for those of us who bought
in below $5, as your previous 'undervalued' assessment implied. I hope your research convinces you that
there is also big upside potential in the long term. Thanks for taking the time to learn about it.

"Are these numbers surprising?"


No.


"Why is there such a disparity?"


Because once an honest case is made, there is little to spin, while a dishonest case might lend itself to an infinite
amount of spin.


"Why aren't the short writers writing more comments? Should it be 'required' that authors respond to legitimate
challenges?"


Required by whom, the Spanish Inquisition?
