Yuhe International: Too Risky an Investment
Jun. 16, 2011 2:56 AM ET46 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Our due diligence findings regarding Yuhe International (NASDAQ:YUII) raise serious red
flags. Our most important findings:


We have reason to believe that YUII has misrepresented the details surrounding its
acquisition of 13 breeder farms. More specifically, we believe we have compelling
evidence that YUII never reached or executed an agreement with the owner of the
Dajiang farms, as stated in December 2009,. This leads us to believe that the $12.1
million deposit allegedly paid to acquire the farms may have been misappropriated.
We have begun to question the details surrounding the acquisitions of other breeder
farms allegedly consummated by YUII.
SEC filings reveal a host of other red flags.


Over the next few days, we will disclose more information that will strengthen these
findings as well as discredit the supportive documents that YUII management supplied to
rebut the information we uncovered.


Given our findings, we deem YUII shares to be uninvestible.


Introduction


Our opinion regarding the validity of the Yuhe International (YUII) story has been a volatile
one. As the Chinese RTO universe was tumbling down during the past year, YUII was one
of the few ChinaHybrids we still held a long position in.


However, in September 2010 we unwound that position due to our suspicion that the
company was about to tap the equity market for capital at what we feared would be a poor
valuation. Just one month later YUII did in fact climb aboard the dilution train.


Despite our reservations about the equity offering, though, we reinitiated a long position in
YUII shares prompted by:


The strong pricing of the offering. Although we felt that the P/E multiple for the
transaction was sub-par, the offering was completed at a premium to prevailing market
prices at the time of the offering.
The appearance that YUII would use proceeds from the offering to consummate
accretive acquisitions.

Knowledge that SAIC filings were in line with SEC filings.


Given our long position in YUII we decided to perform more extensive due diligence
("DD") of the company to justify our investment. It was our expectation at the time that we
would eventually increase our exposure to YUII shares.


We began our DD process two months ago. The initial findings were encouraging. We
were able to confirm the existence of 15 of YUII's "legacy" farms and they all appeared to
be in good shape.


However, our optimism began to wane once we shifted our focus to concerns about
YUII's planned acquisition of 13 farms from Dajiang Enterprise Group Co., Ltd. Soon
afterwards, we issued an alert to readers that we had initiated a small short position in
YUII shares pending further DD. That DD led us to conclude that YUII may have
misappropriated $12.1 million in the Dajiang acquisition and had misled investors
regarding the details surrounding that transaction.


Background of Intent to Acquire Dajiang's Farms


As background, YUII originally announced the acquisition of Dajiang's farms in December
2009. At the time, the company claimed it paid an 80% deposit ($12.1 million) against
the purchase price and said the transaction would close by March 2010. The first
disclosure regarding this transaction in a SEC filing follows:


Form 8-K (December 31, 2009): Under the First Agreement, Dajiang agreed to
transfer to Weifang Yuhe a total of thirteen breeder farms (the "Farms") with a total
area of 560 mu (approximately 37 hectares) at a total consideration of RMB
103,870,000. The transfer consideration is to be settled in two installments with the
first installment in the amount of RMB 83,000,000 being payable on or before
December 31, 2009 and the balance being payable within two months following
completion of the transfer. Payment of the first installment has been made...The
transfer of the Farms will be completed in or around the beginning of March
2010.


Despite YUII's assertion that the transfer of the Dajiang farms would be completed by
March 2010, the company apparently made limited progress in closing the transaction for
more than a year after it was first announced. Following are additional disclosures YUII
made in its SEC Filings regarding the transaction:


2009- Form 10-K: On December 24, 2009, PRC Yuhe entered into an agreement to
purchase thirteen breeder farms at a total consideration of RMB103,870,000,



http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1047857/000114420409066963/v170297_8k.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 3/26


approximately equivalent to $15,191,891. As of December 31, 2009, PRC Yuhe has
paid 80% of the total consideration, or RMB 83,000,000, approximately equivalent to
$12,139,472. The remaining balance will be paid within two months after formal
delivery of the farms, expected in early March 2010
Form 8-K (January 4, 2010): The aggregate purchase price for the 13 breeder farms
is RMB103.87 million (approximately $15.2 million). Pursuant to the agreement, Yuhe
already paid 80% of the purchase price on or before December 31, 2009 and will pay
the remaining balance within two months after formal delivery of the farms, expected
in early March 2010....These farms will add 600,000 sets of parent breeders for
Yuhe by the third quarter of 2010.


2010-Form 10-K: On December 24, 2009, PRC Yuhe entered into an agreement to
purchase thirteen breeder farms for a total consideration of $15,709,792, equivalent to
approximately RMB 103,870,000. As of December 31, 2010, PRC Yuhe has paid 80%
of the total consideration, or $12,553,314, equivalent to approximately RMB
83,000,000. The remaining balance of $3,156,478, equivalent to approximately RMB
20,870,000, is expected to be paid by the end of December 2011.


YUII updated the disclosure concerning the acquisition in the 2010 Form 10K stating the
remaining balance of the Dajiang transaction was expected to be paid by December 2011.
We found no mention in the company's public filings of why the date had been changed.
However, since we did not participate in most of YUII's investors conference calls we don't
know if the issue was discussed then. Regardless, given the new timeline for the closing
we did not expect a near term resolution of this issue.


On May 16, 2011 the company announced in a press release regarding the QI 2011
financial results that it had officially taken possession of 11 farms from Dajiang as of the
date of the release. There was no reference to what happened to two of the 13 farms
YUII originally contracted to acquire from Dajiang.


Following is the excerpt from the press release disclosing the Dajiang transaction had
been completed:


As of the date of this press release, the Company had officially taken possession of
13 breeder farms from its previous acquisitions conducted in December 2009 and
July 2010. Of these, 11 breeder farms were taken over from Weifang Dajiang
Corporation, and two breeder farms were taken over from Liaoning Haicheng
Songsen Stock Farming and Feed Co., Ltd.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 4/26


Certain aspects of the Dajiang acquisition struck us as odd including the payment of an
80% deposit on the transaction rather than a more prudent 20% or 25% down payment.
Also, the 16 months between the execution of the agreement and claimed transfer of 11
chicken farms is excessive. Finally, we are intrigued by the convenient timing of when YUII
claimed that the transfer of the farms became official since it coincided with the date of the
QI press release.


Chairman and General Manager of Dajiang Denies Acquisitions


Dajiang's Chairman and General Manager Vehemently Stated in Two Telephone
Conversations that YUII Did NOT Acquire Dajiang's Farms


Once our interest in the Dajiang transaction was piqued we decided to reach out to the
Chairman and General Manager of Dajiang and get his perspective on the transaction. We
obtained the Chairman's name, Mr. Xuejiang Zheng, and telephone number from the
Dajiang's 2010 SAIC filing (attached).


On June 8  and 9  2011, Geo's investigator called Mr. Zheng, the Chairman and General
Manager of Dajiang Enterprise Group Co., Ltd. In both calls Mr. Zheng categorically stated
that YUII did NOT acquire the farms owned by Dajiang. Further, YUII never had serious
negotiations with Dajiang, much less execute an agreement to acquire the farms. Key
comments made by Mr. Zheng during the telephone conversations concerning YUII's
claim to have acquired Dajiang's farms and other comments regarding YUII follow:


First Call With Chairman Zheng, June 8, 2011


Geo's investigator initially called Mr. Zheng on June 8  and identified himself as a
representative of an investment fund interested in acquiring chicken farming operations in
China. Since Mr. Zheng did not know who he was talking to he was less forthcoming in the
first call than the follow up call made the next day. Despite his reticence to be too open
during the first call he did reveal the following details concerning YUII's claims to have
acquired Dajiang's farms:


Mr. Zheng stated he knew of YUII but categorically denied there was ever an
agreement for YUII to acquire Dajiang's farms. It should be noted that he also denied
having been contacted by representatives from YUII.
He further stated that YUII is a company with a very poor reputation in the local
business community that is generally thought to be on the verge of bankruptcy.
He was interested in having discussions with our investigator concerning the sale of
Dajiang's farms.

Full Transcript of First Call


Second Call with Chairman Zheng, June 9, 2011


Geo's investigator made a second call to Mr. Zheng the following day. This time Zheng
was more forthcoming about a discussion he did in fact have with YUII representatives in
2009 and provided details regarding the meeting.


Mr. Zheng was approached by YUII in the fall of 2009. He stated that only one
discussion concerning Dajiang and its operations took place and there were no formal
negotiations for YUII to acquire the farms.
YUII's representative shared with Mr. Zheng that the company was in the process of
raising capital in the US markets and having an acquisition of Dajiang's farms would
help that process. They wanted Mr. Zheng to "do them a favor" and work with them
to come up with a deal that would be attractive to US investors.
Zheng stated that YUII's offices are located close to Dajiang's so he knew of the
company. He stated that YUII is, "not a good company and did not have strong
capacity."
YUII proposed a fake deal which would result in Dajiang's farms being listed under
YUII's name. The idea was for YUII to rent the farms from Dajiang or enter a joint
venture with Dajiang so YUII could claim control/ownership.
Zheng was initially somewhat intrigued that he could use an investment from YUII to
renovate and upgrade his farms but he was put off by YUII's unprofessional approach
and shady propositions.
Zheng rejected YUII's approach and there were no further discussions between the
two companies.


The bottom line is that according to the Chairman of Dajiang, YUII did NOT acquire
Dajiang's farms and there is and never was an official agreement in place for them to do
so. The transcripts and recording of these two conversations are enclosed to this report.

Internal Controls


Examination of SEC Documents Give Context to the Internal Control Environment in
Which YUII Executed Its Alleged Acquisition of Dajiang's Farms

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 6/26


During the course of our ongoing on-the-ground due diligence we began scouring SEC
documents to gain insight into YUII's operating history and disclosures that might be
relevant to the alleged acquisition of Dajiang's farms. Our key findings are as follows:


Material Internal Control Weaknesses and Possible "Rubber Stamp" Audits


YUII attempted to upgrade auditors by engaging Grant Thornton ("GT") in December
2009 to complete the 2009 audit. GT replaced Child, Van Wagoner & Bradshaw, PLLC
("Child"). Child is the firm that had served as YUII's independent auditor since March 31,
2008. GT discovered prohibited related party loans and material internal control
weaknesses during the firm's initial audit work. Management caused the related party
loans to be paid prior to the end of 2009. Despite management's best efforts to resolve the
related party issues, ongoing material weaknesses in YUII's internal controls compelled
GT to resign as independent auditor effective March 5, 2010.


YUII's Audit Committee accepted GT's resignation and reappointed Child as independent
auditor effective March 9, 2010. Since Child had done the 2008 audit and interim audit
work for the 2009 audit prior to GT's appointment, the firm was able to reassume the role
of independent auditor and complete the audit in time for the Form 10-K filing on March
31, 2010. However, the timing of Child's reappointment and the filing of the Form 10-K
makes us wonder just how thorough the 2009 audit could have been under the
circumstances.


Even allowing for the interim work done prior to year end, it is surprising that Child was
able to seamlessly complete the audit on such short notice. We also wonder how Child
has been able to accept the same internal control weaknesses that compelled GT to
resign as independent auditor. It appears that Child is not operating under the same
standards as GT.


It should be noted that YUII did in fact make efforts to resolve its internal control
weaknesses. The company obtained outside professional assistance in an effort to
address and correct the internal control weaknesses prior to filing the 2009 - Form 10-K. It
appears that these efforts, however, did not eliminate all of YUII internal control
deficiencies as the 2010 10-K revealed that internal controls are still not effective due to
activities that took place in early 2010. YUII has stated that it has since put measures in
place to remedy its internal control issues. Any such remedies would be post the Dajiang
acquisition.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 7/26


In the case of YUII, it is vitally important for investors to understand some of the factors
that internal control policies address. We can directly reference YUII's 2010 - Form 10-K
for details:


Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:


(i) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly


reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;


(ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to


permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.


GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in


accordance with appropriate authorization of the Company's management and board


of directors; and


(iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of


unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could


have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements."


We find such information particularly relevant for a company such as YUII that has been
growing through acquisitions. This is especially relevant to the Dajiang transaction since it
appears unlikely any remedies to correct internal control deficiencies would have been put
in place before payment for the alleged acquisition took place.


Other Aquisitions


Other details in the 2010-Form 10-K regarding YUII's practice of acquiring some of its
suppliers also gives us pause.


We were particularly struck by the details surrounding the following acquisition of five
farms:


On July 14, 2010, PRC Yuhe entered into an asset purchase agreement with Liaoning
Haicheng Songsen Stock Farming and Feed Co., Ltd. ("Haicheng Songsen"), and Mr.
Jiang Zhaolin, the controlling shareholder of Haicheng Songsen.



http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1047857/000114420411019022/v216756_10k.htm

http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1047857/000114420411019022/v216756_10k.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 8/26


Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, PRC Yuhe agreed to buy certain assets of
Haicheng Songsen, including five breeder farms with a total area of approximately
52 acres and buildings totalling approximately 63,174 square meters in Haicheng,
Liaoning Province, China, for a purchase price of $3,214,335 (RMB 21,252,540). As
of December 31, 2010, PRC Yuhe had paid $2,458,111 (RMB 16,252,540). The
remaining balance of $756,224 (RMB 5,000,000), is expected to be paid by the end
of August 2011. Concurrent with the purchase, the Company issued 300,000
restricted shares of its common stock to Mr. Jiang Zhaolin pursuant to a service
agreement (the "Service Agreement") between PRC Yuhe and Mr. Jiang Zhaolin.
Pursuant to the Service Agreement, Mr. Jiang Zhaolin agreed to provide PRC Yuhe
with certain services related to completion and closing of the Transaction in
consideration for the restricted shares of common stock of the Company calculated
at a price of $10.00 per share with total consideration equivalent to approximately
RMB 20 million. On the issuance date, the 300,000 restricted shares were valued at
$2,736,000, based on the closing market price of $9.12 on that day.


Note that as was the case with the Dajiang "acquisition", there was an 80% deposit paid
on the transaction as well as an excessive period of time between the agreement (July
2010) and the anticipated closing of the acquisition (August 2011). Also note that the
controlling shareholder of Haicheng Songsen received 300,000 restricted YUII shares as
closing fee valued at $2.7 million. Does $2.7 million paid for services related to the
completion of a transaction valued at $3.2 million seem reasonable? Finally, as of the
end of QI 2011 YUII had taken possession of only two of the five farms acquired.


More recently, YUII announced the acquisition of yet another 10 farms in December 2010:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 9/26


On December 31, 2010, PRC Yuhe entered into an asset purchase agreement,
collectively, the Purchase Agreements, with each of Mr. Liu Tiezhu, Mr. Liu Kaichun,
Mr. Luo Xingshi, Mr. Xu Zhenming, Mr. Shan Jichun and Mr. Xin Yubin, collectively,
the Sellers. All Sellers are unaffiliated with the Company. Pursuant to the Purchase
Agreements, PRC Yuhe agreed to purchase from the Sellers, and each of the
Sellers has agreed to sell, certain assets, including, in the aggregate, ten breeder
farms with an area of 558.4 mu, approximately 91.0 acres and building coverage of
approximately 136,740 square meters in Henan and Liaoning provinces of China, for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately RMB 108.7 million, or approximately
$16.4 million. Mr. Xu Yubin will receive approximately 431,848 restricted shares of
the Company's common stock calculated at a price of $10 per share with total
consideration equal to approximately RMB28.6 million, or approximately $4.3 million.
These restricted shares, which have not yet been issued, will be subject to a six-
month lock-up period. The other five Sellers will receive an aggregate cash
consideration of approximately RMB 80.1 million, or approximately $12.1 million.
The Purchase Agreements are subject to customary closing conditions and are
expected to be closed in the first half of 2011.


Notice that these two acquisition arrangements appear to have been negotiated with at
least three individuals who were suppliers to YUII.


PRC Yuhe's suppliers (including distributors of suppliers) in 2010 were as follows:

Total 26,854 62.05 %


Adding to our belief that YUII's recent acquisitions should be further scrutinized is that,
Jiang Zhaolin was YUII's biggest supplier of eggs in 2010 after supplying only 1.8% of
its eggs in 2009. That increased level of business with Zhaolin would seem to help justify
YUII's rationale for the acquisition.

We recognize the benefits of vertical integration, but we view YUII's acquisitions with
extreme skepticism for the following reasons:


Red flags and risk factors discussed in the next section.
Weak and accommodating internal controls.
The propensity of a number of ChinaHybrid companies to deceive through related
party transactions and suspect acquisitions.


Cash Management Practices Raise Red Flags


YUII's 2010-Form 10-K filing disclosed,


The Company uses company-controlled personal bank accounts of certain of its
employees for transit purposes to transact a substantial amount of its business and
the Company transacts a significant amount of its business in cash without using
bank accounts.


YUII reports $42 million cash as of QI 2011, yet continues to take out short term
loans for "liquidity needs".
Despite having $42 million in cash, the company's 2010 Form 10K reports being
delinquent on "employee benefit payments" of around $600,000 at December 31,
2010. Given the company reports having $42 million why wouldn't they just pay the
benefits liability with existing cash?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 12/26


The company reported in its Form 10-K filings less than $1,000 of AR for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, and no AR for the year ended December 31,
2010. How is that possible? Did management really run a $67 million revenue
business during 2010 entirely on a cash basis?
Despite having a beginning cash balance in January 2010 of over $14 million and an
ending cash balance at December 31, 2010 of over $35 million, the company only
generated $35,000 of interest income during 2010 according to its 10-K filing. Even
a 1% yield on an average cash balance of $24 million would have generated $240,000
of interest income during the year. Does management maintain its cash balances in
non-interest bearing accounts and, if so, why?


Risk Factors


Certain Risk Factors Disclosed in the SEC Filings Are NOT "Boiler Plate"


The following risk factors are disclosed in the company's SEC filings:


The Company's construction projects may be challenged by the relevant
government agencies. The Company has not obtained relevant government
approvals and permits, including the planning permit, construction permit and the
environmental permit, with respect to two of its projects involving the construction of
breeder farm and feed stock production. The constructions of these two projects
may be challenged by relevant governmental authorities and the Company's
business operations may be interrupted or suspended.


YUII needs to offer more color on this issue. How long as this issue been open? Does this
issue have anything to do with the following disclosure?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 13/26


Further approvals are required for the land that the Company leases from
village committees. The Company has entered into several land lease agreements
respectively with certain local village committees in Weifang city for use of certain
land owned by such villages. According to relevant PRC law, prior to entering into
the lease agreements with the Company, the village committees must obtain the
consent of at least two-thirds of the members of the respective village as well as the
approval of the relevant people's government. However, these village committees
have not completed the required consent and approval procedures. Although
the Company has not received any notice from any governmental authorities
challenging the validity of these lease agreements, the Company cannot assure you
that its use of the leased land will not be challenged in the future, which may
adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial
condition.


Once again, YUII needs to clarify some issues. Why has YUII been unable to close this
chapter in its history? Have the villagers not accepted YUII payment terms? Is YUII unable
or unwilling to make agreed payments? Is YUII involved in an illegal lease scenario?

Past incomplete disclosures may cause certain investors to rescind their past
investment in us. The Company filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1) on
October 15, 2010 to amend its previous SEC filings to supplement certain
disclosures with respect to a general, verbal and informal understanding between
Mr. Gao Zhentao and Mr. Kunio Yamamoto at the time of a share transfer agreement
dated October 18, 2007. Pursuant to such understanding, all or part of the shares of
the Company's common stock issued to Mr. Kunio Yamamoto would be transferred
to Mr. Gao Zhentao in the future in consideration of Mr. Gao Zhentao's commitment
to management of the Company's business operations and future achievement of
the financial targets set forth in a Make Good Agreement on March 12, 2008. The
general, verbal and informal understanding may result in invalidation of the
Company's corporate restructuring in 2007 as described in the risk factor entitled
"Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore
special purpose companies and corporate restructuring by PRC residents may have
adverse effects on the Company's business, results of operations and financial
conditions." Such past incomplete disclosure may cause investors who purchased
the Company's shares pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with
the SEC on May 12, 2008, as amended, to rescind their purchase of the Company's
shares based on the Registration Statement on Form S-1, in which case the
Company's may be required to purchase from such investors their shares at
their initial purchase price. This may have an adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on the trading price
of the Company's common stock.


What are the implications for US investors?


Conclusion and Valuation Scenarios


We remain short YUII, but investors will have to draw their own conclusions and make
their own investment decisions.


For us, the YUII story comes down to one simple truth: the Chairman and General
Manager of Dajiang categorically stated that there was never an agreement for YUII
to acquire Dajiang's farms. Simply put, the transaction never happened. That of course
brings into question:


Where did the $12.1 million deposit really go?
Where did the increased production capacity in 2010 10K come from?
Were 2010 financial results overstated?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 15/26


Why does YUII still plan to pay the remaining balance for an acquisition (Dajiang) that
appears to have not taken place?
Do improprieties exist with regards to YUII's other acquisitions?
How can investors place trust in YUII's management in the future?


We also can't ignore the implications of other disclosures in YUII's SEC filings. For
example, the 10-K disclosures regarding past due employee benefits payments and
unfinished business related to completing the transfer of lease rights leads us to ponder
Dajiang's chairman's assertion that YUII is not as substantial and financially sound as they
lead investors to believe.


There are other issues that give us pause regarding the YUII story including:


How the company carries out its business transactions without going through its own
bank accounts;
Certain balance sheet items that do not make sense such as the lack of AR;
Acquisitions of suppliers;
Internal controls that have not been effective, leaving investors vulnerable to possible
improprieties.


Valuation


The financial markets have no tolerance for companies that may have violated investors’
trust and neither do we. And, the environment of ChinaHybrids has worsened in recent
months after a series of proven and alleged frauds in the space have grabbed the
attention of investors and regulators. In fact, just last week the SEC formally
announced that it will be stepping up its investigations of Chinese small cap companies.
We assume this means the pace at which the SEC takes action against companies that
appear to have misrepresented themselves to investors will quicken. Also, brokerage
houses are beginning to limit the ability of customers to buy Chinese RTO stocks on
margin and even prohibit customers from initiating new positions in some names.


The reality of these developments has only begun to sink into the market's psyche. We,
therefore, have a hard time envisioning a scenario in which YUII shares will not be
punished severely by investors once the gravity of our findings sinks in. Given the overall
market environment, we can't justify the risk of owning shares in a company that may have
violated investors’ trust.

Comments (46)


So how can we value YUII shares? This a difficult task for us since we do not trust the
financial data presented in YUII SEC filings. Valuing YUII becomes even more problematic
when we consider management may be misappropriating cash when making alleged
acquisitions. What possible claim would investors have on that cash and what recourse
would they have against a company located in China?


However, some investors may view YUII's situation differently and wish to value the
company based on its reported cash. Others may instead look to the inferred cash per
share based on the interest income generated in 2010. Whatever valuation approach is
used, investors should consider possible events that would adversely affect YUII's shares
including:


A potential SEC investigation;
Management and/or Board Member resignations;
Auditor resignation;
Further negative DD findings as this story unfolds;
Analyst downgrades; and
A trading halt.


From our perspective, we are simply not interested in trying to derive a base value for
YUII shares or deciding if a chicken farming operation will attract suitors to take the
company private. We will let the market speak to these points. Likewise, we will not be
influenced if YUII announces plans to buy back shares in the open market or supportive
"paper" it offers in its defense. Shares of CCME, CHBT, SCEI and a host of other
companies received only a temporary lift from such moves.


In the end, from our point of view, we do not consider YUII shares as investible. The
risks are just too great and cannot be quantified at this time.

I actually called Mr. Zheng this morning China time, the nr you provided is correct. He changed his wording
dramatically and basically just said to check other sources.  
Now, I know YUII is not financially unsound like Mr. Zheng is claiming because it raised so much USD out of
the US investors just recently. In fact, if I look at Mr. Zheng's SAIC, looks like his is in shamble. So who is
facing bankrupcy? Mr. Zheng or Yuhe? Btw, you still haven't answered me why Yuii's SAIC would match with
SEC's? In none of the frauds I have seen so far, did this occur. Are we talking about a new level here? 
Disclosure: Looking to buy some if Mr. Zheng is the dishonest one.


17 Jun 2011, 08:10 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
The reason a fraudulent company's SAIC would match SEC is because SAIC filings are easily manipulable,
especially in less economically prosperous regions where the subject company can have some "pull" with the
local government. Off the top of my head, I can list several RTO frauds (ONP, LIWA first come to mind) as
well as one IPO stock (LFT) that had matching or at least very close SAIC to SEC financials. That bank
statement provided by YUII was the best evidence the company's operating business is a sham. Where's the
interest income on its over RMB 100 million cash?


Looks like now it's quite obvious who the dishonest one is.


17 Jun 2011, 12:27 PM

So now aligning SAIC is merely a panel for business license renewals. SAT and SEC are what needs to align.
Companies just need to make public SAT filings and align them with SEC filings. Personally i think thats
enough but they will all be forced to align all three to avert scamming Illegal Short sellers.


22 Jun 2011, 09:53 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
All of your favorite scams had the choice and opportunity to publish their SAT filings, but they failed to do it.
Trust me, if SAT filings of all these companies were to be made public, 90% of the RTO will instantly go to
zero. Maybe you can take that advice to the fraudsters at CGA? You remind me of the delusional Arthur_Big,
who bashes every short seller but does nothing to address the real of issue of protecting investors from
frauds.

Not true but i get it. Your short and are trying to make money. Fact is and i assume you want facts, The SEC

Has anyone, especially any Chinese speaking investor, taken a close look at the docs provided by YUII in its press
release yesterday? What a bunch of jokes. There's one very obvious Chinese typo just in the first a few paragraph of
the agreement body. It's funny YUII wants people to believe this is an agreement underlying an acquisition involving
monetary consideration over USD $15 million?


Also, their bank statement is a total joke. Not only it's incredibly hard to read given how low quality (intentional?) the
scan was, but also there's apparently something important missing among its transactions, which is supposed to be
on a REAL bank statement. Anyone care to venture a guess what I'm talking about?


Last but certainly not the least, where are the english translations of all their docs?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/275126-yuhe-international-too-risky-an-investment 19/26


LIQUNPU
To the all shareholders of YUII (Yuhe International, Inc): 
I am an individual investor. I believe that YUII (Yuhe International, 
Inc) is lying about their financial report. I don’t think they can 
make such good profit. It is too good to be true. The reason is below: 
1. In 2009, the DOB (day old broiler) price is crushed; it is far 
below the cost. All the big competitors like Shangdong MinHe Animal 
Husbandry Co. Ltd had a big loss. But YUII had a big profit; their 
profit margin was as high as 27%. This is too good to be true. DOB is 
basically like commodity, you can not sell higher price than others. 
Their cost is 80% of soybean and corn (Also commodity), you can not 
buy these stuff far below market average price. One more reason is 
Shangdong MinHe Animal Husbandry Co. Ltd had higher brand recognition 
in Shangdong province, China. Minhe sell their DOB a little higher 
than YUII. And MinHe is 2 times size of YUII. These two company are in 
same province, same market area. There should not be such big 
difference. 
2. In 2010, YUII had a net profit margin of 29%. At the same time, 
Minhe only has 4%. We know this is a commodity. 4% is reasonable. 29% 
is ridiculous. And I also find some other competitors in China who has 
same profit margin around 5%. So I believe this is an industry 
average. How YUII can have such high margin??? Is that suspicious? 
3. YUII said they don’t have account receivable because the customers 
all pay cash. This is in China. If you know a little about business in 
China, you will know this is impossible. Every company in China has 
account receivable. All the other competitors have, why YUII don’t? 
What makes YUII so special? 
4. YUII made 19.5m, 12.7 million, and 10.5 million in 2010, 2009, and 
2008 respectively. At the same time, MinHe, a company 2 times size of 
YUII, lost 42 million RMB (about 6.3 million USD) in 2009, and made 41 
million RMB (about 6.2 million USD) in 2010. MinHe had an profit 
projection for 2011 and 2012 is around 10.1 million USD and 11.2 
million USD. 
5. YUII made a lot of acquisition recently. All these acquisitions are 
suspicious to me. There must be some accounting shenanigans. 
Conclusion: YUII tried their best the telling you a perfect 5 stars 
company growth story (high margin, no account receivable, excellent 
cash flow, high growth rate, smart acquisition). But, if you look 
closely to all these elements, this just makes no sense. This is just 
another mediocre Chinese company which is not qualified to make public 
offer in Chinese market. Then they made some shortcut, hired some

there is simply one less red flag (but fraud could still be likely if there are other flags)... or do you think it gives

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings.
Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-
five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been
done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the
short community.


Class Action lawsuits — Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law
firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a
Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under
short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the
truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.


Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. — If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or
financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the
customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade
them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers — The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will
suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This
causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares
that they need to cover.


Paid bashers — The shorts will hire paid bashers who “invade” the message boards of the company. The bashers
disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the
manipulation.


Just ask Jim Cramer


Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function: 
When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your
view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fictionâ€¦ you hit the brokerage houses with
a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle
down — it's a pretty good game. 
This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air, however, it somehow ended up
on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of
YouTube.


Pretty enlightening information. How many people got a margin pull due last friday or monday by your brokerage
house? This report came from a former SEC member who saw the atrocity that happens to American Investors as
well as the Institutions that come under attack.

Why is somehow immoral and unethical for "paid bashers" to "invade" the message boards, yet there is not
the same indignation (by some people) of the "paid pumpers". Like for instance someone who has been
pumping APWR right before its auditor resigns?

Now that he has another stock halted, he can enjoy more time writing at length to pump other frauds.

Has anyone from GEO or others, tried to get in contact with, or get an opinion from the large Japanese shareholder:
Yamamoto, Kunio... the only person basically on par with Zhentao Gao-s share holdings?
