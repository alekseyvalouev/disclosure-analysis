Massive	Dilution	Coming	For	National	Bank	Of	Greece	Shareholders
Jan.	7,	2013	7:13	AM	ET76	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


On	December	27,	the	Bank	of	Greece	directed	Greek	banks	to	raise	capital.	National
Bank	of	Greece	(NBG)	has	been	directed	to	raise	9.756	billion	EUR.	Given	a	share	price
as	at	January	4	of	1.43	EUR,	NBG's	market	capitalisation	is	only	1.37	billion	EUR,	a	mere
14.01%	of	the	capital	required.	It	follows	that	current	shareholders	will	face	substantial
dilution	once	the	capital	raising	is	complete.


Current	financial	position


On	December	21,	NBG	released	its	Q3	results.	Some	notable	figures:


2.45	billion	EUR	loss	for	the	9	months	ending	30	September,	of	which	"only"	465
million	EUR	was	impairment	of	Greek	government	bonds
554	million	EUR	loss	for	Q3	2012


NBG's	large	historical	losses	are	not	the	focus	of	this	article.	Nor	are	the	likely	future
losses	as	Greece	continues	to	be	stuck	in	a	deep	recession.	Instead,	we	draw	investors'
attention	to	the	company's	financial	position	as	at	30	September	2012:


Assets 103.10	billion	EUR


Liabilities 105.73	billion	EUR


Total	equity	attributable	to	NBG	shareholders Negative	2.87	billion	EUR


Non-controlling	interests	and	preferred	securities 241	million	EUR


It	bears	repeating	-	this	bank,	with	a	negative	book	value	of	2.87	billion	EUR,	is
trading	with	a	market	capitalisation	of	1.37	billion	EUR,	and	has	been	directed	to
raise	9.756	billion	EUR.


Capital	raising	terms:


The	9.756	billion	EUR	capital	must	be	raised	by	the	end	of	April.

In	a	separate	press	release,	the	Hellenic	Financial	Stability	Fund	(HFSF)	announced


(1)	that	they	would	underwrite	the	Greek	banks'	capital	raisings	and


(2)	the	terms	of	the	capital	raisings.


The	link	provided	above	to	the	HFSF	website	contains	the	terms	in	Greek,	however	there
are	numerous	summaries	of	the	document	in	English,	such	as	this	one	from	a	Greek
research	analyst	and	this	one	from	Bloomberg.


The	key	terms	are:


(1)	Greek	banks	must	issue	common	shares	to	achieve	a	core	Tier	1	capital	ratio	of	6%.


(2)	They	must	also	issue	contingent	convertible	bonds	(CoCos)	to	increase	the	Tier	1
capital	ratio	by	3%,	from	6%	to	9%.


(3)	Common	shares	will	be	offered	at	lower	of	
(3a)	at	least	a	50%	discount	of	the	50-day	moving	average	[MA]	preceding	the
announcement	of	a	bank's	capital	raising	and


(3b)	the	last	traded	price	preceding	the	announcement	of	a	bank's	capital	raising.


Rights	issue	and	impact	on	share	price


The	sale	of	common	shares	will	most	likely	take	place	as	the	result	of	a	rights	issue	to
current	shareholders.


Many	European	banking	stocks	are	trading	at	price-to-book	ratios	below	1.0,	and	these
banks	have	operations	countries	much	stronger	than	Greece.


Greek	banks	deserve	a	price-to-book	multiple	lower	than	other	European	banks	due	to	the
high	levels	of	doubtful	debts	from	Greek	customers.	After	NBG	shares	go	ex-rights,	the
share	price	should	fall	very	close	to,	or	even	below	the	issue	price	of	the	new	shares,	to
reflect	a	price-to-book	ratio	of	1.0	or	below.


As	mentioned	earlier,	NBG's	capital	requirement	is	9.756	billion	EUR.	This	amount
represents	a	core	Tier	1	capital	ratio	of	9%.	Therefore	the	common	stock	capital
requirement	is	6/9	*	9.756	billion	=	6.504	billion	EUR.


NBG's	50	day	MA	is	1.59	EUR.	Therefore	if	the	capital	raising	were	to	be	announced	in
the	near	future,	NBG	shareholders	could	expect	a	rights	issue	price	of	about	0.80	EUR
per	share,	which	is	roughly	50%	of	the	50	day	MA.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1097711-massive-dilution-coming-for-national-bank-of-greece-shareholders 3/5


Given	the	above	assumptions,	6.504	billion	EUR	capital	required	is	8.18	billion	shares	at
0.80	EUR	each.	This	is	significant	dilution	for	a	company	that	only	has	956.09	million
shares	outstanding.


Taking	the	analysis	one	step	further,	if	NBG	raises	6.504	billion	EUR	in	capital,	then	the
book	value	of	the	company	only	rises	to	3.634	billion	EUR	(new	capital	6.504	billion	+
existing	(negative	2.87	billion).	Given	a	new	share	count	of	9.14	billion	shares	(956	million
existing	+	8.18	billion	new	shares),	this	gives	a	share	price	of	0.40	EUR	(3.634	billion
EUR	/	9.14	billion	shares)	at	a	price-to-book	ratio	of	1.00.


Eurobank	merger


On	November	23,	NBG	shareholders	approved	a	proposed	takeover	offer	of	rival
Eurobank.	Under	the	offer,	Eurobank	shareholders	will	receive	58	NBG	shares	for	every
100	Eurobank	shares	held.


The	merger	may	close	before	NBG	completes	its	capital	raising,	so	we've	also	reviewed
the	capital	requirement	for	Eurobank,	which	is	even	worse	than	that	of	NBG.


Eurobank	financial	position	and	capital	requirement


Eurobank	has	been	directed	to	raise	5.839	billion	EUR.	However	it	also	has	a	book	value
as	at	September	30	of	negative	404	million	EUR.	If	we	assume	that	the	NBG	and
Eurobank	merger	is	finalized	before	either	bank's	capital	raising	is	completed,	the	position
of	the	combined	entity	is	shown	in	the	table	below.	Please	note	that	the	shares
outstanding	count	for	the	combined	entity	is	calculated	as	follows:


552.95	million	Eurobank	shares	*	0.58	=	320.71	million	additional	NBG	shares	to	be
issued.


956.09	million	existing	NBG	shares	+	320.71	million	new	shares	=	1,276.80	million	shares
for	the	combined	entity.


Combined	entity NBG Eurobank


Shares	outstanding 1,276.80	million 956.09	million 552.95	million


Recent	share	price 1.43	EUR 1.43	EUR 0.7000	EUR


Market	capitalisation 1,825.82	million	EUR 1,367.21	million	EUR 387.06	million	EUR

Capital	required 15,595	million	EUR 9,756	million	EUR 5,839	million	EUR


Market	capitalisation	as


percentage	of	capital


required


11.70% 14.01% 6.63%


As	we	can	see	from	the	table,	Eurobank's	market	capitalisation,	when	compared	to	its
capital	requirement,	is	far	smaller	than	that	NBG.	Therefore	the	completion	of	the	merger
(before	NBG's	capital	raising)	would	result	in	additional	dilution	for	NBG	shareholders.


Catalysts	for	share	price	decline


There	are	many	catalysts	for	NBG's	share	price	to	decline	in	the	coming	days,	weeks	and
months.	These	include:


(1a)	A	delayed	reaction	to	the	NBG	and	Eurobank	Q3	loss	reports	from	mid-December
that	disclosed	negative	book	values	for	the	two	banks.


(1b)	A	delayed	reaction	to	the	Bank	of	Greece	report	of	late	December	that	directs	NBG
and	Eurobank	to	raise	9.756	billion	EUR	and	5.839	billion	EUR	respectively.


(2)	NBG	going	ex-rights,	and	then	declining	to	or	below	the	rights	issue	price.


(3)	NBG	shareholders	receiving	their	newly	issued	shares	from	the	rights	issue	will	likely
sell	their	shares	if	the	share	price	is	higher	than	issue	price.	As	described	above,	a	price-
to-book	of	1.0	would	be	overly	generous	for	these	banks.


Catalysts	1a	and	1b	could	result	in	a	lower	NBG	share	price	at	any	time.	Catalysts	2	and	3
are	almost	certain	to	occur	between	now	and	April	30.


Massive	dilution	for	NBG	shareholders	is	coming	between	now	and	April	30,	with	the
capital	raising	to	take	place	at	a	50%	discount	to	the	stock's	50	day	MA.	This	will	probably
continue	to	put	downward	pressure	on	the	stock,	given	a	likely	capital-raising	price	below
the	52-week	low	of	0.8980	EUR.	A	market	capitalization	of	1.37	billion	EUR	is
extremely	rich	for	a	Greek	bank	with	a	book	value	of	negative	2.87	billion	EUR	and
an	impending	capital-raising	of	9.756	billion	EUR.

Unless	I	misinterpreted	the	documents	coming	out	of	Greece,	my	understanding	was	that	10%	of	their	new	capital
would	need	to	be	raised	from	private	interests.	The	rest	would	be	coming	from	the	low-interest	loans	approved	by	the
ECB.	There	may	be	a	dilution,	but	the	degree	of	the	dilution	you	are	suggesting	seems	to	be	exaggerated.

Studioso	Research,	Contributor
Author’s	reply	» 	Catchingknives,	our	interpretation	of	the	capital	raising	requirements	are	different.	The	10%
threshold	to	which	you	refer	is	the	requirement	for	the	bank	to	remain	managed	privately.


Any	capital	raising	shortfall	will	be	underwritten	by	the	HFSF,	which	will	purchase	the	common	shares	at	the
same	price	as	they	were	offered	to	existing	shareholders.


So	regardless	of	who	buys	the	common	shares,	massive	dilution	will	occur.
