Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Tech


CTRL


Control4 offers a closed solution in competition with the open solutions offered by
Amazon, Google and Apple.


The Company's products are far more expensive than the competition, while
demanding burdensome installation.


Its financial performance has been stagnating, and guidance was unimpressive.


Insiders have been selling shares and resigning from the board.


During last Sunday's Super Bowl, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) spent about $10 million
advertising its voice-activated "Echo." In one commercial, Alec Baldwin turns on the
lights merely by telling Echo to so do.[1]

Searching Amazon.com for "Echo" yields over 40 devices which now interface with
Echo, from coffee machines to lights to speakers to thermostats.  Capabilities are
being added all the time - ordering a Domino's pizza, requesting a joke, playing bingo
and calling for a ride with Uber are just some examples.  Echo is on a roll.

The ability to control home appliances by voice and/or smartphones grows exponentially
with help from Google (Android) (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS9
(which "contains" HomeKit).


In comparison to these systems, Control4 Corp. (NASDAQ:CTRL, or the "Company")
offers a home automation system that is: (1) closed to outside innovation, (2) very
expensive and (3) difficult to install and service.


The free/low-cost "hubs" made by Google, Apple and Amazon offer an open system
where any developer or designer can plug a product into the platform. Over twenty
equipment manufacturers have already made their devices compatible with Apple or
Google, including General Electric (GE), Honeywell (HON), and Phillips (PHG). Between
Apple and Android, there are about 2.3 billion smartphones, a massive base of
hardware on which to easily control home appliances and such.  We think this is how
you will control your thermostats and music - not via some extraordinarily expensive
fickle hardware delivered by a guy in a van, if he even shows up.


[4, 4a]


CTRL's closed system requires professional installation and uses proprietary
programming, which works only with a limited number of licensed devices. Much like
how AOL (a closed system) was supplanted by an open system approach to the
internet, we believe CTRL is going to have the rug pulled out from under it by "down
market" competition.


Despite offering limited functionality (relatively speaking), CTRL's system is significantly
more expensive than its open system competitors. According to a check we completed
with a local dealer, homeowners can build their own home-automation systems with far
greater ease of use and convenience than CTRL allows, in some cases at just 1/3rd the
cost:

For $199, Echo owners can buy an Insteon hub, two lamp dimmers, two on/off modules
(for things like coffee machines, fans, etc.) and an LED bulb. This Insteon DIY system is
cheaper than the rate we were quoted for a single CTRL dimmer ($968/4 = $242)
excluding labor.[5]


One would think that at these sky-high prices, CTRL would provide an exceptional user
experience and support. ASecureLife.com, on December 16, 2015, wrote, "Installation
will usually require two people to come to your home for two days to install even the
most basic features."  BestCompany.com, on August 11, 2015, explained that "because
the initial installation requires a great deal of labor, there is no trial period for the
system."

If your system breaks (and there are numerous such complaints online), you could be
stuck with an entire audio-video, lighting and home automation system that does not
work. Imagine if all the lighting in your home ceased to work and you were reliant on a
third-party dealer to fix it.


After visiting two different Best Buys in San Francisco in March 2015, we discovered
that none of the CTRL display systems in the demonstration room worked properly. The
sales associates (at each location) blamed the failure on faulty Wi-Fi connections and
seemed indifferent about CTRL products.

The confluence of a degrading value proposition and mediocre customer service has
resulted in slowing growth across key metrics for the Company.


Figure 2: Inconsistent Results; Failure to Reach Inflection[8]


Although the Company insists that dealers do not keep significant inventory, we have
seen large lots of new CTRL equipment selling online on websites such as eBay - often
a red flag. Days of inventory outstanding has been trending higher, which, coupled with
decelerating revenue, portends looming demand and margin issues.

Insider Sales and Resignations


From August 2013 to November 2014, insiders sold 455,276 shares of the Company.
On February 27, 2015, board members representing Foundation Capital and Frazier
Ventures, two venture capital shareholders with a combined 23.7% stake in CTRL,
announced their resignation. It is possible these board members left the board in order
for these firms to more easily exit their positions.

Obfuscation of Deterioration, Grasping at Straws


In an effort to drive growth, CTRL announced, on February 4, 2016, the acquisition of
Pakedge Device & Software for $32.7 million in cash. Based on Pakedge's 2015
financials, the Company paid 33 times its approximate $1 million of earnings and 1.8
times its $18.5 million of revenues - a very rich price even when compared to the high
valuations of CTRL.[10; 10a]


Pakedge designs and manufactures high-end networking equipment. It serves a very
limited market of individuals who require a comprehensive, enterprise-grade IP network
in their home. An eBay search for Pakedge reveals routers being sold for up to $500.
Needless to say, the Pakedge acquisition represents a step in the wrong direction,
adding more expensive product offerings and more closed systems.


[11]


In response to the Pakedge acquisition announcement, Q4 2015 results and the
issuance of fiscal year 2016 guidance, CTRL shares closed 22% higher on Friday,
February 5, 2016. We believe this enthusiasm is misplaced.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/3868176-control4s-ctrl-ceo-martin-plaehn-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160204006323/en/Control4-Acquires-Pakedge-Device-Software-Leader-Advanced

http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?ssPageName=GSTL&_nkw=pakedge&_sop=16
While CTRL management would not disclose the expected growth rate of Pakedge
baked into their 2016 guidance, they did say on the February 4, 2016 conference call
that it would be "accretive to our growth rate." We are not sure what this means. On
Pakedge's website, it describes "exponential revenue growth", which would seem to
make sense for a company that was founded in a garage in 2003.[12, 12a]


If you assume Pakedge grows its top line revenues 35% in 2016, we estimate CTRL's
2016 revenue guidance was roughly in line with the consensus number and implies just
8% revenue growth for the legacy business in 2016, down from 10% in 2015.


In addition to this mediocre 2016 revenue guidance, CTRL reported Q4 2015 operating
margins of 1% (down from 10% in Q4 2014) and controller shipment volume of just
16,964, down 25% year over year.


CTRL did not generate any profit in fiscal year 2015. It did, however, generate $4.4
million of cash flow from operations. On an enterprise value to 2015 cash flow from
operations basis, the stock trades at a multiple of 24 times. Even assuming the sell-side
analysts covering CTRL are correct and the Company sees a sudden rebound of profits
in 2016, it would still appear expensive at 22 times 2016 GAAP EPS.


Figure 5: Control4 Price to GAAP Earnings Multiples


Our price target for CTRL ranges from $1.60 to $2.40 per share, based on 8-12 times
our 2016 GAAP EPS estimate of $0.20. We think even this estimate may be optimistic,
however. It is our view that CTRL is DOA, and we question how it can reverse its 2015
loss. According to Bloomberg LP's compilation of GAAP EPS estimates for 2015, the
Street cut estimates from $0.55 in August 2014 to (-$0.05) in November 2015. Even at
this sharply reduced estimate, the Street was too optimistic and actual results came in
lower.


Alea iacta est.  Why would anybody spend all that money and endure all the
headaches when Google and Amazon, to name a few alternatives, are more elegant
and cheaper?

CTRL offers yet another solution crafted by technologists. The Company hides behind
adjustments and acquisitions to obscure the fact that it has not, and likely will not,
produce meaningful profits. Now that shares of CTRL have moved higher on misplaced
enthusiasm, the time to sell the shares is now. This is only our opinion. The reader is
encouraged to carefully and slowly review the footnotes in this report and visit with
dealers and make up his own mind.

[8] Note that these figures do not take into account CTRL's January 31, 2015 acquisition
of Nexus Technologies. On the Company's Q4 2014 conference call in February 2015,
management indicated they expected Nexus Technologies' "incremental revenue to be
in the range of up to $5 million" for 2015. Excluding $5 million of revenues from Nexus in
2015, CTRL would have posted only 6% FY revenue growth, versus the 10% reported.

[13] From Wikipedia.org: "Alea iacta est ("The die is cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by
Suetonius (as iacta alea est [ˈjakta ˈaːlea est]) to Julius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC as
he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy." The inference is that it is too
late for CTRL now. The die is cast. Google, Apple and / or Amazon have already
crossed over the Rubicon and there is no going back now. It's over for CTRL.
