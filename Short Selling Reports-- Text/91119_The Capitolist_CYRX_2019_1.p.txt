Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Healthcare


CYRX


Cryoport is massively over-hyped by Wall Street, the banks are pushing a bizarre
theory of regulatory capture that isn't supportable by fact or customer testimony.


In fact, CYRX produces containers that support the shipping of cryogenic preserved
tissue and drug products; the company also offers logistical support for said
shipping.


Detailed within are numerous examples of companies that produce similar
cryogenic shipping containers, more concerning to shareholders should be the
relative lack of traction the company has in logistics.


One client confirmed that they do use Cryoport for shipping containers but not for
the high margin logistical support business.


The use of terminal values by the sell side is extremely lazy here. It's dependent on
the fact that Cryoport is listed in the Biologics License Application (BLA) - this
regulatory moat is a false premise.

Cryoport is a Commodity Business Trading at 10x Revenue, There is No
Regulatory Moat


There Is No Moat


Cryoport, Inc. (NASDAQ:CYRX) provides cryogenic shipping and logistics services to
the life sciences industry. Specifically, the company is hyped as the primary, and in
some cases, sole provider of shipment logistics and containers for gene therapies such
as Kymriah (NVS) and Yescarta (GILD). I started working on the company after reading
an article by Mako Research on Seeking Alpha – the author did a nice job of laying out a
bear thesis on the company, I decided to look into the regulatory side of the equation to
put a fine point on why this business is being mispriced.


My conclusion is that CYRX is a perfectly fine company that probably does a good job
for their customers. But ultimately, CYRX has no moat to protect the business and is
being hyped by the sell side with wild valuation metrics suggesting a far greater level of
duration than is appropriate.


Importantly – regardless of the analyst’s desires – there is no FDA regulation that forces
companies to use the CYRX platform. They have no moat. This is a commodity
business that the sell side prism has bent into a biotech company, and in that sense, this
reminds me of Trupanion (TRUP) (an insurance company posing as a SAAS company).
In the end, I see a company worth ~$2.50/share that probably shouldn’t be publicly
traded.


The sell side has created a story around CYRX being a necessary evil for any drug
manufacturer unfortunate enough to have used the company’s product in their clinical
trial (and subsequent Biologics License Application (“BLA”)). The inferred value is based
off of an assertion that the drug company cannot move away from CYRX post approval,
which would give CYRX structural pricing power and thus a terminal value. This is a
false premise.

CYRX Core Business and Competitive Review


Source: SVBLeerink Report


I spoke to several former employees who confirmed that the BLA inclusion does not
convey the kind of economic protection that these analysts are suggesting.


The reality of the situation is that FDA doesn’t even regulate the best practices around
cryopreservation, those guidelines are published by USP (About USP). This enables
any sophisticated competitor to abide by said guidelines and provide the same or similar
service.


BLAs require multiple vendors to be listed, their inclusion in the filing is generally
intended to ensure that those vendors are known by the FDA and subject to audit by the
agency for quality control. They are not intended to lock the manufacturer into a binding
contractual relationship. While a change in supplier would have to be validated and may
be subject to the submission of a prior approval supplement to FDA, there is no reason
why new clinical data would be needed. Additionally, clinical data would not be a very
good way to demonstrate that the change does not adversely affect the safety, purity,
and potency of the product. Instead, the focus would be on laboratory testing (far less
onerous).


CYRX makes cryogenic storage containers, like the ones you see below, and provides
logistical support for shipping of cryogenically stored biologic material (like those found
in fertility settings and some gene/cell therapy products).

The logistics support business is the high margin service offering that everyone is
fighting for. It seems that CYRX has been more successful at being the manufacturer of
shipping containers.


Unfortunately, it also seems that the larger players are deeply entrenched. I emailed
Novartis and asked them what service providers they used to transport Kymriah and
received the following response confirming just how many players are involved in this
business.

Very Capable Competitors In The Manufacturing Business


QUICKstat is also a large logistics company for medical and biological products,
highlighting that CYRX is not winning the logistics business and has been brought on as
a cryo-storage manufacturer.


What multiple are you willing to pay for a simple manufacturing company?


BioLife Solutions (BLFS)


BLFS bought SAVSU Technologies in August of this year, (evo - SAVSU) their new
cryogenic shippers come with tracking hardware and a corresponding software suite.
There is nothing particularly interesting about BLFS as they too are largely a hardware
manufacturing company at this point – but the company serves as a poignant example
of how competitive the cryoshipper market is.

The sell side has blown it again. Let’s look at Needham’s model whereby a Terminal
value of 25x 2025 EBITDA is used to value the company.


Figure 8: Needham Report Citing BLAs


Source: Needham Report


Embedded in this kind of valuation is an assumption of pricing power and contractual
duration. By using a terminal value, you are stating this EBITDA is at once obviously
attainable and permanently repeatable. As I have shown above, this is an incorrect
characterization of the regulatory framework and competitive landscape in the field.

Conclusion


Source: Needham Report


The fully diluted share count of the company is 35,592,828 per the form 10-Q filing.


As you can see above, the terminal value – which makes no sense – comprises a full
88% of the analyst’s $736m fair value for the enterprise. Even with this impressive
growth expectations, the company only produces $89m in discounted net cash to the
investor. So under these assumptions, CYRX is scheduled to generate $2.50/share
in discounted net cash between now and 2025.


Using the Street numbers for the company, we see a 10x sales multiple being placed on
2020 estimated sales. This strikes me as particularly rich for a manufacturing company
that is losing logistics contracts to larger established players.

Forecasting past 2025 for a commodity business that has an indeterminate level of
pricing power and is under competitive pressure from multiple large multinationals is a
challenge for anyone. Perhaps at some point the company will establish that it is cash
flow positive and we can consider a terminal value (although 25x EBITDA won’t be my
chosen multiple). Until then shareholders are in the uncomfortable situation of owning a
stock that is trading at a 440% premium to a level that offers some downside protection.
I am short CYRX, I believe the investments banks have done a great disservice by
suggesting there is any level of moat surrounding this business model.
