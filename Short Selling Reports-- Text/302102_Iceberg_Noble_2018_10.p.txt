DEAD MEN WALKING


May 8, 2018  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 2 Comments  


The following was offered as an open letter to all Noble Group’s shareholders,
creditors, bondholders, and employees. The author, Michael Dee, is the ex-CEO of
Morgan Stanley South East Asia and a former managing director of Temasek. He
has been an early critic of Noble Group’s accounting practices and management.


 


Noble should not be allowed to continue to operate until they come clean to


all investors with a fully independent forensic accounting of its historical


finances and management compensation. As someone who has been


publicly focused on Noble Group’s finances for almost a decade I have seen


nothing to dissuade me from the view that Noble has been running a


massive multifaceted accounting fraud for a very long time. This fraud has


ultimately cost thousands of employees their jobs, investors have lost


billions and billions of their savings, and Singapore’s well deserved


reputation for regulatory excellence is a shambles.


The restructuring plan is a sham which should be dead-on-arrival until the


full truth of Noble’s alleged malfeasance and self dealing have been fully


investigated and exposed. Goldilocks is performing a valuable public service


by bringing legal action against Noble. One has to wonder where CIC,


Templeton, Orbis and Prudential have been napping during all of this. And


bondholders need to lawyer up because all the asset sales you have been


reading about are like burning your furniture to heat your home, in short,


you are getting screwed!


The SGX and MAS have proven themselves incapable and impotent while


greed has blinded the vast array of financial intermediaries who have


enabled this tragedy. While I remain open to being proven wrong, Richard


Elman, his management, E&Y and every single board member have utterly

disgraced themselves through the most appalling lack of transparency,


financial controls and governance. This indeed is Asia’s Enron.


What is needed now is for the courts and the legal system to do the


regulators job and step in and force the disclosure and transparency the


regulators have been unwilling to demand. Until that is done no one should


approve this restructuring plan.


The most diabolical and dubious of aspect of this so-called “plan” is the


clause whereby shareholders and bondholders release the company, its


management and its board from claims of fraud and malfeasance. Do no


such thing, for these scoundrels must be held to account. I have been on top


of this situation for years now and until it’s proven otherwise such an


agreement is providing nothing less than a get out of jail free card.


I believe that when fully transparency is provided on Noble’s finances the


financial world will be shocked at how much shareholder and bondholder


funds have been paid out to this catastrophic management while the shares


have fallen 99%, The perpetuals 90% or so, and the bonds 60-65%. The


destruction of value has been truly epic and yet management believes they


deserve a large share of a recapitalized New Noble? Never! The sheer


audacity is astounding, and the silence from Noble’s leading shareholders,


lenders and bondholders is deafening. Is the old saying true? “Sheep


deserves to get slaughtered.” I like sheep so I say no. Rise up all you sheep


and defend yourselves.


One must sit back and wonder what is going on when some of the most


sophisticated of global investors lose so much money without a whimper.


Goldilocks, for whom I cannot have any pity is at least showing they are


willing to stand up for their shareholder rights. Personally I would never


give my funds to anyone who loses everything and does nothing about it, for


years. There must be an explanation because this has been front page news


for a full three plus years now. Surely CIC, Prudential, Orbis and Templeton


have some explanation for their lack of action, or is the explanation worse


than the funds lost?


More than seven years ago while analyzing a different commodity trader I


did a comparative analysis with other trading houses including Noble.


Noble Group stood out to me because of their negative cash flow while


generating book profits. Strange right? It certainly was. Their mark-to-


market positions were generating those profits and they were increasing


dramatically, and increasingly out of touch with reality. In the early days


though, Noble’s opaque financials meant one couldn’t readily ascertain


what they were doing to make those paper profits, but it was plausible. I
7/8/2019 Dead Men Walking | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2018/05/08/dead-men-walking/ 3/10


made a mental note to stay away from Noble and went back to the other


company occupying my attention.


A few years later I saw an article about Noble Group regarding a report


written by an entity called Iceberg Research. The pun was not lost on me. As


I devoured the Iceberg report I resolved to pull my old files and update them.


To say I was shocked would be an understatement. What I had seen early on


as a small dark spot on the X-Ray had become stage four cancer. I was truly


shocked at how Noble was bleeding cash and yet reporting massive mark-to-


market profits. What once was somewhat plausible now was totally


implausible in my view.


I was a Wharton graduate and had been an investment banker at the time


for almost 35 years, 26 of them at Morgan Stanley where I was a Managing


Director and Regional CEO. My career spanned hundreds of companies. At


Wharton I had taken a brilliant course on accounting deception and fraud


and how to spot it. It had served me very well in steering clear of many dicey


situations. The basic lessons were, 1) if it’s too good to be true then it’s likely


not true, 2) one can follow accounting rules and still be guilty of fraud and


3) in the long run there needs to be a correlation between the ability to


produce positive cash flow and reported profits. My updated review showed


no such correction and a massive amount of borrowing to fill the cash flow


shortfalls.


In fact I was surprised that the banks were lending to Noble at all. My work


with the rating agencies over the years and reading their Noble reports were


vastly inconsistent with the credit I saw. I read every single equity research


analyst report I could find. They were virtually all over-weight in their


recommendations and not challenging their own recommendations. If that


was due to the negligence of the analyst or perhaps directions from the top I


don’t know, but I have well founded suspicions. Noble has been a real money


maker for a number of financial institutions. I looked for credit research


from the houses who were underwriting bonds, there was none. How could


banks be selling bonds to Private Banking and institutional clients with no


fixed income research? None of it made sense until I called some investors


and banking contacts. What they said really shook me.


No need to worry they said, CIC, China’s Sovereign Wealth Fund owned


about 15% of Noble’s equity. I checked and sure enough they did. Thus,


investors and bankers told me, Noble is as good as gold, given Chinese


backing. I had seen this movie before when Temasek, Singapore’s State


owned investment company took a large stake in the unrated Olam


Corporation. This allowed Olam to have almost unlimited access to the


capital markets on the mistaken assumption, likely pushed by the


underwriting banks that Temasek would guarantee Olam’s credit. I knew


this was not true. I was a Senior Managing Director at Temasek at the time
7/8/2019 Dead Men Walking | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2018/05/08/dead-men-walking/ 4/10


and knew Temasek never guaranteed a portfolio companies debt. This was


an overwhelming investment principle as the objective was that portfolio


companies should rightly operate on a stand alone basis. However, as often


happens the banks were pushing this notion on Olam and investors were


buying it with no idea what Olam’s credit rating was.


Interestingly Noble’s investment by CIC came only a few months after the


Temasek/Olam investment. It struck me that Noble had watched and


learned from Olam and set out to get their own SWF backing despite having


an investment grade rating already. It proved to be shrewd move by Noble


and a catastrophe for CIC. What was most unusual about the investment


however was that one-third of the CIC investment (5% of the company) was


secondary shares owned by the founder and Chairman Richard Elman. I still


wonder why CIC would do that. The last thing a major investor should want


is the founder and Executive Chairman directly reducing his exposure to the


company. In any event it was a shrewd move by Elman and provided him


with significant amounts of cash at a peak in the share price.


Because Noble’s financial statements were as transparent as mud it was


almost impossible to spot the exact mechanism Noble was using to generate


book profits from negative cash flow, except for one which proved prescient


… Yancoal. Noble owned a small stake in Yancoal, a publicly traded


company, which made identifying the market value of that stake simple


multiplication. But wait, it was valued on Noble’s books at about 50 times


the market value of the stake! In fact the accounting value of Noble’s small


stake exceed the entire market value of Yancoal. There was no way to justify


that, but Noble tried anyway saying Yancoal was illiquid and thus grossly


undervalued.


I publicly offered $10,000 to be donated to the Singapore charity of Noble’s


choice if they would release the full model that justified the Yancoal


valuation. No response of course because it couldn’t be justified. The


liquidity of a stock does not alter the inherent value of that stock by that


magnitude. With my banker hat on I thought Noble should be bidding for all


of Yancoal if they really believed it was so drastically undervalued, or


someone else should. But no one of course did because Yancoal book


valuation was phony.


Then Noble did something interesting, they wrote it down to something like


30 times taking a big earnings hit. This prompted me to wonder how they


decided on the new mark-to-market value. What model did they use, what


crazy ludicrous assumptions could generate these values, and most


importantly, how did their auditor E&Y allow and sign off on this? I tried to


recreate such a valuation model but it was nuts, the numbers didn’t work at


all. It was then I learned that E&Y had been Noble’s auditor for 20-ish years!


Now the red lights were flashing and the alarm bells were deafening.
7/8/2019 Dead Men Walking | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2018/05/08/dead-men-walking/ 5/10


No board audit committee should ever allow an audit firm to stay in place


for 20 years, the conflicts of interest are simply too big to allow it. Then I


looked up the Board’s audit committee and saw none other than Noble’s


founder Richard Elman was member of the Audit Committee…. and member


of the Compensation Committee and if that wasn’t enough he was also


member of the Nominating Committee to the Board. He had total control


and absolute power over a weak board unwilling to do their job as


representatives of investors.


When Noble issued a four-page press release aimed personally at me I was


amused because they did not answer a single concern I expressed. It was a


master class on the Octopus Theory of press management, squirt ink and


swim away. The stock continued to plunge as any credibility Noble had


evaporated. I had been very precise, Laser focused and calculated in the


issues I raised and yet Noble just poured more gasoline on the tire fire. At


this point I absolutely concluded they were lying and were never going to


tell the truth. They have not proven this assumption wrong yet. To me this


shredded any hopes of saving the company. The management, board and


auditors were unwilling to face reality.


Never had I seen such shoddy and conflicted governance in a public


company in 30 years! I was breathless at the broader implications and in


light of my concern about their accounts I saw the potential for an


unstoppable ability to commit fraud. Yet the board had notable financial


and corporate personalities, where were they? They should know better, this


was not rocket science. It was also notable that E&Y never really stepped up


to defend the accounts. They just took their fee, signed their opinion and


crawled back under their rock.


Early on I had decided I would never take a position in a company I decided


to write about or comment publicly about. I always demanded this be noted


at the end of any articles I wrote. I would never put myself in the position of


having a conflict of interest or challenging my integrity by having an


economic position and a public voice. While I chose to be public with my


views, I never had any economic interest whatsoever in Noble or their fate. I


was true to my word.


I was also very protective of the capital markets on which I had built my


career and was always a proponent of strong active regulation. While that


may seem parochial and counterintuitive in today’s climate, I knew to my


core the trust and integrity required in the financial system and the ease


with which unscrupulous players could game markets and commit fraud.


One only had to read about Enron, Worldcom and Madoff amongst many


other scandals.
7/8/2019 Dead Men Walking | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2018/05/08/dead-men-walking/ 6/10


Yet what amazed me was that no one other than Iceberg seemed to see all


these obvious problems, even after we both were writing and talking about


them. All the circuit breakers in the financial system were flashing green


while I saw what Iceberg saw but through a different lens. I wanted to know


why the tsunami warnings were not blaring. Were we just smarter than


everyone else? History has proven that we were, but it didn’t feel like that at


the time.


I was wondering what I was missing, my confidence was shaken, how could


other not see what was so glaringly obvious? The Iceberg report had


generated worldwide press but the analysts and the rating agencies kept


saying all was well and holding to their target prices, earnings estimates


and ratings. I reached out to everyone who was writing and commenting on


Noble but no one seemed to care, yet some hinted other internal forces and


portions of the banks were at work. I spoke to the regulators to ask what


they saw or were doing. They just didn’t pay attention. Then Noble said


something else that caught my attention.


They spoke about liquidity and that their inventory was very liquid and


could be sold. Noble discussed “sale and purchase” arrangements where


they would sell their inventory to banks and purchase it back later. Look up


‘Repo 105 Lehman Brothers’ and you will see why I was shocked even more


than ever. Noble seemed to be claiming that they sold physical inventory to


the banks for cash where Noble in turn did not have to buy it back, but they


always did buy it back. I ran Morgan Stanley’s Asian Financial services


practice and had worked with banks my entire career. I did not believe any


bank risk committee in the world would buy physical inventory without a


solid agreement for it to be repurchased at a higher price, and I still believe


that.


Perhaps there was a contract or a document that said as much but behind


the scenes was there a handshake, a separate written agreement, an oral


agreement, or a wink and a nod that those inventories would be


repurchased? And would they be repurchased at a specific price and date so


as to generate for the bank an attractive fixed return on the “purchase and


sale”? I say yes.


Repos of course occur every day in the tens if not hundreds of billions of


dollars. The catch though is that if Noble in any way had any form of


agreement to repurchase that inventory then they were nothing more than


Repos which are nothing more than debt and debt must be reported on the


balance sheet. If Noble structurally was executing Repos and not showing it


as debt then their balance sheet was a fraud. I believe it was an exercise in


showing less debt than they really had.
7/8/2019 Dead Men Walking | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2018/05/08/dead-men-walking/ 7/10


My question was whether the banks were booking these the same way,


because I doubted that regulators would look kindly on a bank speculating


in commodities without an ironclad repurchase arrangement. This remains


an essential unanswered question as to whether the auditors at E&Y and the


Audit Committee were in essence hiding off balance sheet debt and thus


committing balance sheet fraud in addition to income statement fraud


through false mark-to-market transactions.


There was more that bothered me but these were the big three; (i) the


negative free cash flow combined with mark-to-market accounting profits,


(ii) the vastly inflated Yancoal valuation, and (iii) and the so-called “sale &


purchase” arrangements. On top of all this Noble did not disclose


management compensation on the shaky grounds of competitive reasons.


Well, surely the disclosure of compensation for senior executives at


thousands of other public firms don’t seem to be a problem for them, yet


Noble’s senior management and board had wrapped itself in an invisibility


cloak which remains in place to this day. It’s a lot easier for a teller to rob a


bank if no one knows how much money is missing.


It was breathtaking to learn that the former CEO, Yusuf Alireza, was suing


Richard Elman personally for about $50 million in promised compensation.


Read that again … $50 MILLION! Was that ever disclosed? Nope! And why


was Alireza suing Richard Elman? One can only suspect it is because he


knows Noble doesn’t have the funds but Elman does.


What other outrageous deals like this exist at Noble? In all the vampire


movies I saw as a kid the vampire killed the victim right away by drinking


all their blood. Could it be that the Noble vampires had found a new model


whereby they kept the victim alive while only drinking enough blood to


keep them alive and waiting for rights issues, bond sales, bank lines, sale


and purchase agreements and asset sales to regenerate the prodigious


quantities of blood they were consuming in secret? We don’t know because


the SGX allowed Noble to keep secret the perhaps voracious compensation


appetites of Richard Elman and his senior team as evidenced by the Alireza


lawsuit disclosures.


I can almost rationalize the terrible performance of the rating agencies who


have been so slow to catch up to what was going on at Noble given their


unquenchable thirst for fees so amply demonstrated by their rating of


worthless mortgage securities AAA. The overweight research analysts and


bankers seem to have been motivated by the massive fees Noble paid out to


the bankers for access to their oxygen (ie capital). Noble desperately needed


capital to fill the negative cash flow hole and paid massive fees and interest


rates to get it, much to the joy of the bonkers bankers making money hand-


over-fist. Noble always seemed to me to be completely desperate in their


search for funds and when banks dropped one by one it seemed the fees and
7/8/2019 Dead Men Walking | Iceberg Research


https://iceberg-research.com/2018/05/08/dead-men-walking/ 8/10


profits went up for those who remained, creating a kind of musical chairs,


or perhaps more appropriately Russian Roulette.


The Board of course has Directors and Officers Insurance and thus virtually


no liability. I continue to wonder if Elman hadn’t already limited his


financial exposure in some way. E&Y in my book has no excuses, they have


never stepped out front to resolve these accounting questions and after over


20 years as Noble’s auditors I wonder if a full forensic accounting would


render them the fate of Arthur Andersen. The media kept writing about this


story but did limited deep investigation which is on them. The story was


there to be done but Noble hired the now disgraced firm of Bell Pottinger to


spin Noble’s story of being wronged and to strong-arm, threaten and


intimidate the press. I heard this from numerous reporters some of whom


had to get articles cleared by legal to avoid the threat of lawsuits. One pines


for the days of Katherine Graham.


However, it is the regulatory infrastructure in which I am the most


disappointed. I lived in Singapore for eleven years, at one point the SGX was


a client who sought my advice as to whether to reopen immediately after


911 (they showed great character in doing so), and when I left Singapore the


first time the MAS senior management threw me a going away lunch to


thank me for our working relationship. While I have the highest and deepest


regard for the people and policies of the regulatory regime in Singapore at


the SGX and MAS I do believe they miserably failed the investment


community in the Noble case. They should be judged by the cataclysm


known as Noble. I do hope at some point they stiffen up and demand a fully


independent forensic accounting review of Noble in addition to


undertaking some deep soul searching in the wake of this and other recent


scandals. Singapore has a very well deserved reputation but no one is


perfect and in this case they failed miserably the implication of which is


loses of tens of billions of dollars.


Some say Richard Elman lost also and it was due to market conditions not


accounting fraud. If so then he should welcome a fully independent


forensic account review externally led and staffed. The PWC review was a


complete sham with massive disclaimers and a very narrow mandate


conducted by a firm which had a conflict with a director who had a nine


year relationship with PWC. Noble used that report to claim their


accounting was vindicated, yet PWC’s own words in the report prove that


claim was not even remotely true.


It is time to pull open the curtain, blow away all the smoke and once and for


determine whether Noble has been noble in all its actions or whether it has


been fraudulent in its activities to the benefit of a corrupt management and


board. If the former I will gladly acknowledge this, but if not, the harshest


criminal and financial penalties should be applied to everyone involved.

Bad blood of avarice and greed MUST always be transfused….fast


and decidedly. 


I agree with Dee.Too bad Temasek gained nothing to scoot from


the loot but at least 


they should ask MofF to bring E&Y to task.
