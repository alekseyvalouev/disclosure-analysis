ExOne (XONE) -
Who Is Tu Guihua
And Mega Fame
Holdings?
Jul. 7, 2014 3:54 PM ET2 comments | Includes: ExOne (XOâ€¦


Before discussing the simple question of the title above, we want to
congratulate Gotham City Research on its outstanding work uncovering the
Let's Gowex fraud. Kudos to Gotham City Research for its outstanding work!


Moving on to ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), shares have had a parabolic move since
early May, climbing nearly 90% from its lows on minimal news. However, two
recent filings with the SEC led us to ask the simple question - Who is Tu
Guihua, Mega Fame Holdings, and Novel Century Ventures? This morning, a
Form, 3 was submitted with the SEC disclosing an initial statement of
beneficial ownership of 2,235,596 shares in XONE by a consortium "group"
comprised of two British Virgin Island funds called Novel Century Ventures and
Mega Fame Holdings, as well as an individual named Tu Guihua, that uses a
Chinese address in the Guizhou Province.[1] The shares reported by the
"group" would represent 15.5% of the outstanding shares based on disclosures
in ExOne's most recent 10Q.[2] Surely, the magnitude of the purchases,
representing a large percentage of volume during the recent parabolic move,
could explain the mysterious move in XONE. Based on the Form 3 disclosures,
it appears the "group" exceeded 5% requirement on 7/1/14 for 13D disclosure
pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1934. However, under the short
swing profit rule of the very same act, the "group" would be subject to short
swing profit restrictions given its ownership exceeds 10% of outstanding
shares. The goal of the six month statutory window is to "eradicate speculative
abuses."[3] (Investors may recall the Wood River Endwave securities
fraud/prison sentence when discussing the importance of beneficial ownership
filings[4]).

Incredibly, just three minutes after the Form 3 was filed disclosing ownership
of more than 15% (subjecting the "group" to short swing profit statutes), a
Form 4 was filed with the SEC disclosing the very same "group" had begun to
sell its XONE on 7/2/14, just one day after triggering its 13D disclosure
requirements.[5] Why had a group that was so aggressive running the stock
up, decided to start selling shares one day after it triggered disclosure
requirements?


We have been unable to find any information on the "group" shareholders,
Novel Century Ventures and Mega Fame Holdings, or its principal Tu Guihua
(aside from a similar filing on MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT)).


To be clear, we are in no way suggesting, or even implying, that ExOne
management even knows who this "group" is, and we have no reason to think
ExOne management has done anything wrong. However, the circumstances of
a 90% stock price move, combined with a mysterious filer that subsequently
begins selling shares one day after an initial disclosure - triggering the short
swing profit rule stature in the process, sure creates additional intrigue for a
company that has missed and/or guided down every quarter of its public
existence.

Something certainly smells with this 13D,
sounds like an orchestrated short squeeze
attempt. Too bad everyone knows this
company is garbage, 2 quarters of
sequentially declining revenue and still
trades above 15x sales. All smoke and
mirrors in our view.

CDM, this orchestrated squeeze attempt
has 3 possibilities: it did take place, it
doesn't take place or it will take place.


If the companies are not going to be
acquired or going to merge on a short
notice, my best guess is that Mega
Fame is going to short XONE and VJET,
because both companies probably
deserve it at the moment. Mega Fame
can probably make a killing.  
And, they probably have all the shares
they need when they need to cover...
Meaning they are net long.


But that's only for NOW, b/c XONE will
be fine in the end!
