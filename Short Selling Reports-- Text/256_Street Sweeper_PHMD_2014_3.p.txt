PhotoMedex: Deadline Ahead, All Options Look Ugly

Summary


PhotoMedex, headquartered in Horsham, Pa., is suffering from declining sales of its
no!no! hair removers advertised on TV.


PhotoMedex bought a money-losing company for $106 million last spring. But within
weeks, PhotoMedex defaulted on covenants of the $85 million loan used to buy
LCA-Vision laser vision correction centers.


The banks’ forbearance granted PhotoMedex temporary relief. But the clock’s
ticking. On Oct. 31, PhotoMedex will face one of several options – all ugly.


PhotoMedex stock appears risky. One analyst warns it could even eventually spiral
down to zero.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


PhotoMedex (PHMD), best known for its No! No! hair removers seen on TV, defaulted in
August on covenants of an $85 million loan inked in May to acquire a laser vision
correction company.


On Oct. 31, the Horsham, Pa. company is expected to face one of three options - a
rewritten note, a new forbearance which is basically an extension, or foreclosure.


The issue poses significant risk to investors.


"As a stock, I would not even touch it," Hamed Khorsand of BWS Financial said in an
interview with TheStreetSweeper.


PHMD faces various possible solutions to whatever option set forth by the lenders,
including increasing sales, trying to sell stock to wary investors, or selling assets.


"I've seen stories like this before where companies can't get out of it," Mr. Khorsand said.
"And eventually it becomes a zero."


Already Wall Street considers the company worth about $80 million - far less than the
$106 million PHMD paid for LCA-Vision laser vision correction clinics.

The scenario does not look good to Mr. Khorsand, who said in an interview with
TheStreetSweeper that he folded his long position last spring after two years of coverage.


"LCA isn't making money and No! No! is not making money and they're out of Japan,"
where No! No! was once distributed, said Mr. Khorsand. "So it's too many issues."


TheStreetSweeper warned investors that PHMD would lose No! No! distribution in Japan.


PHMD has a number of businesses, but the main businesses are the No! No! hair
removers and the XTRAC laser machines used primarily by doctors to treat skin
conditions such as psoriasis. The company expects the LCA-Vision laser vision correction
centers to meld into the company and boost revenue.


Read about PHMD's lawsuits, insider selling and many other issues in
TheStreetSweeper's two previous stories here and here.


And PHMD faces even more pressure, thanks to an issue TheStreetSweeper will describe
very soon in our next article on PHMD.


PHMD did not return TheStreetSweeper's numerous requests for comment. Investors may
find other viewpoints here.


PHMD Buys Declining LCA-Vision


The once-screaming $16 PHMD stock recently slammed back to about $4 as the
company's sales of No! No! hair removers and other products dropped off by about 60
percent.


So PHMD beamed in on LCA-Vision, a laser vision correction company that had racked
up about $2.6 million in operating losses.


Consequently, the company approached a group of American and Israeli banks last spring
to ink the $85 million loan to purchase LCA-Vision. It's a $10 million revolver and a $75
million 4-year loan to buy LCA-Vision laser vision correction clinics for $106.6 million.


That price was nearly two times above and beyond LCA's assets worth only $57 million.
LCA reported declines in procedures and revenue, with sales down to $92 million in 2013.


Sounds Good On Paper


PHMD's pitch to investors was that PHMD could claim LCA's revenue and put its own
XTRAC lasers for psoriasis treatment, as well as its skin care products, in its recently
acquired LCA vision centers.

"The deal sounded good on paper," Mr. Khorsand told TheStreetSweeper.


But within months, PHMD defaulted on loan covenants. It leverage ratio exceeded 5, while
a major loan covenant required just 2.5 to 1, prompting PHMD to report the issue to
lenders, who initiated the forbearance.


The PHMD filing states: On August 4, 2014, the Company received a notice of default and
a reservation of rights from Chase and engaged a third-party independent advisor to
assist the Company in negotiating a longer term solution to the defaults.


"That may not be a record for early default," analyst Fred Russell, of Frederic E. Russell
Investment Management Co., said with a laugh. "But it sure is impressive.


"The bankers got their bad news fast. There was no agonizing suspense. It's like if a guy
knows a girl is going to dump him, he'd rather hear it over an email than a long, drawn-out
dinner."


The lenders - JP Morgan Chase, PNC Bank NA and Bank Leumi Le-Israel - then signed a
forbearance agreement that holds lenders' foreclosure and other rights at bay as the
company works with an advisor on restructuring finances through Oct. 31.


In exchange, PHMD agreed to pay about $19 million in payments, prepayments and fees.


A JP Morgan Chase Bank representative who signed the deal declined to comment.


Business Deteriorates


"So they're already in default on the covenants. OK, how did you mess up this deal? I've
never seen that before," Mr. Khorsand told TheStreetSweeper.


"It's either the business has deteriorated faster than they're disclosing to The Street. Or
the terms were very strict and tight that put them in a corner," added Mr. Khorsand.


Indeed, PHMD in August reported deepening financial problems with earnings minus 18
cents versus analysts' estimates of plus 8 cents. In the first six months, consumer revenue
plunged a whopping 29 percent.


Net losses over six months reached $7.8 million at the end of June. Its working capital
came in at a negative $15.4 million.


And the company reported only $36.7 million in cash.

Comments (2)


Yet management of PHMD and LCA presented an interesting combined package to
investors. But look at the pro forma net loss of the combined companies, below.


Conclusion


The latest events have thrown PHMD into a spiral worsening quicker than the ink could
dry on the loan docs.


On top of loan issues, this downsizing company also faces a new $42 million Israeli class
action lawsuit along with other legal complaints such as the Kim Kardashian lawsuit, plus
other issues TheStreetSweeper will soon explain in a follow-up report.


We agree with Mr. Khorsand's assessment that this stock could follow the pathway set by
other unfortunate companies: "Eventually, it becomes a zero."


Additional disclosure: * Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a
short position in PHMD and stand to profit on any future declines in the stock price.
