ATHX


MultiStem has failed its previous clinical trials.


Former licensing partners Pfizer and Chugai terminated licensing agreements with
Athersys after failed trials.


Athersys’ post-hoc analysis on MultiStem in ischemic stroke is particularly
egregious, in our opinion.


Athersys’ new Japanese partner is near 52-week lows due to MultiStem concerns.


Athersys appears to be running out of cash, and insiders have been selling shares.

Failed Pfizer partnership in Ulcerative Colitis: 2009-2015


It appears to us that Athersys’ MultiStem is back like a zombie from Night of the Living
Dead to feed on the wallets of new, unsuspecting biotech investors. An examination into
MultiStem’s history shows that MultiStem has failed every major past trial, yet today’s
Athersys (NASDAQ:ATHX) investors are excited about its prospects and have driven the
shares up more than 55% year-to-date. In this article, we shed some zombie-zapping
light on MultiStem’s past failures and address what we see as Athersys’ current dire
financial situation. We are short Athersys (ATHX) with a price target of $0.


On December 21, 2009, Athersys entered into a global agreement with Pfizer (PFE) to
develop and market MultiStem for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Pfizer is a big, established, and very reputable global pharmaceutical company, and the
licensing partnership caused investors to become excited about the prospects of
MultiStem in IBD.


The day after the licensing agreement was announced, Athersys shares hit a high of
$5.55 per share (source Yahoo! Finance), which was up from $1.00 per share on the
day before the announcement. Not long thereafter, Pfizer began a Phase 2 trial in
Ulcerative Colitis, the most common form of IBD, in late 2010.


Unfortunately, the excitement for MultiStem was proven to be misdirected. In 2014, after
numerous delays in the trial, Athersys and Pfizer announced that the Phase 2 trial had
failed to hit its primary endpoint. Athersys’ share price fell 51% that day from $2.73 to
$1.33 (source: Yahoo! Finance).

Failed Chugai partnership in ischemic stroke in Japan: 2015


Athersys even examined multiple secondary endpoints and could not find a single
statistically significant difference. This lack of efficacy across numerous endpoints
suggests to us that MultiStem is inert. A treatment of MultiStem essentially had the
same efficacy as a saline solution infusion for IBD.


In May 2015, Athersys announced Pfizer had decided to terminate the 2009 license
agreement.


Fresh off MultiStem’s failure in IBD, Athersys signed a licensing agreement with Chugai
Pharmaceutical Co. (OTCPK:CHGCF) in March 2015 to exclusively develop and
commercialize MultiStem for ischemic stroke in Japan. Athersys had actually started the
Phase 2 trial for ischemic stroke in 2011 and apparently had been searching for a
partner for many years.


Chugai is a large and respected pharmaceutical company in Japan. It was established
almost 75 years ago and has a current market cap of over $23 billion, according to
Bloomberg. Like with the Pfizer partnership, Athersys was able to find a big, reputable
partner, and investors became excited for the potential of MultiStem in ischemic stroke.


That excitement proved short-lived. In April 2015, Athersys announced that the Phase 2
trial for ischemic stroke had missed its primary and secondary endpoints, just like the
failed MultiStem trial in IBD. The primary endpoints of the trial were 1) frequency of dose
limiting adverse events at 7 days, and 2) stroke recovery based on global test analysis
including modified Rankin Scale (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel Index (BI) at 90-days.
There were 8 secondary endpoints for a total of 10 possible successful outcomes.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4112631-athersys-zombie-like-multistem-wont-survive-much-longer 4/12


Athersys conducted post-hoc analysis for positive results in the
MultiStem Phase 2 ischemic stroke study


In the press release, it seems to us that Athersys tried to salvage the failed MultiStem
ischemic stroke trial by conducting post-hoc analysis and data-mining for positive
results. The company clearly states that by using post-hoc analysis, the company was
able to find a sub-group of patients that showed a statistically significant difference from
placebo on the secondary endpoint of Excellent Outcome.


We have previously expressed our views about the dangers of post-hoc analysis.
Following are several issues that we see with this analysis:


As Dr. Peter M Rothwell, an expert in the field, put it, "Post-hoc observations should
be treated with skepticism irrespective of their statistical significance."


1.


Athersys’ findings are based on post-hoc analysis, which we believe makes any
findings low-quality. Athersys’ post-hoc sub-group excluded over 40% of the trial’s
patient population. It included only patients who had received MultiStem within a 24-
36 hour “treatment window,” which took the number of patients from 134 to just 79.


2.


It’s not surprising to us that Athersys was able to data-mine for success on 1
endpoint out of 10 possible primary and secondary endpoints as Athersys adjusted
the patient population through post-hoc analysis. This issue is called “multiplicity” in
statistics, and it results in inflated false positives. Essentially, it means that a trial is
virtually guaranteed to have one statistically significant result if the data is examined
enough different ways.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4112631-athersys-zombie-like-multistem-wont-survive-much-longer 5/12


The secondary endpoint, Excellent Outcome, that was positive for the 24-36 hour
sub-group is a composite measure, which is a combination of the stroke recovery-
based primary endpoint that was mentioned above, but at multiple cutoff points. This
article titled, “Composite Endpoints: Proceed with Caution,” describes how such
composite measures are less reliable.


4.


A major red flag for us is that the Excellent Outcome endpoint was the only endpoint
out of 10 total endpoints that the study was able to show statistical significance. We
want to highlight how implausible this is. All 10 endpoints of the trial were related to
stroke recovery-based measurements. As we just stated, the primary endpoint of the
trial was stroke recovery based on the same measurement criteria that comprised the
Excellent Outcome endpoint. If the stroke patients were indeed helped by MultiStem,
then we would expect some of the other endpoints to also show statistically
significant improvements. That didn’t happen, which makes us believe that the
statistically significant Excellent Outcome endpoint was a fluke that was uncovered
through data-mining.


5.


Despite Athersys’ best efforts, investors seem to have seen through the data-mining
exercise. The shares fell 35% from $2.18 to $1.40 on the day of the announcement April
17, 2015 (source: Yahoo! Finance).

Current situation: Zombie land


The post-hoc analysis apparently didn’t convince Chugai either; Chugai terminated the
agreement on October 2015. This made Athersys 0 for 2 with large, reputable licensing
partners.


With two failed partnership and two failed clinical studies, it appeared to us that
MultiStem was dead. Miraculously, Athersys seemingly resurrected MultiStem after
touting positive 1-year results in ischemic stroke and by signing a new Japanese
partner, Healios K.K.


First, we’ll tackle the 1-year follow-up results in the Phase 2 ischemic stroke trial, which
the company touted in a February 2016 press release. Athersys stated that post-hoc
analysis showed that the study was statistically significant for the Intent to Treat (ITT)
population on the Excellent Outcome measure at 365-days (p=0.02), and that the sub-
group of patients who received MultiStem within 36 hours following stroke had an even
better Excellent Outcome measure versus placebo (p<0.01).


We see numerous additional red flags that should make investors extremely wary of the
trial results.


The trial failed its primary endpoints, which was stroke recovery on 3 test measures
at 90 days and 365 days. This is irrefutable as Athersys itself disclosed the failures.


1.


The sub-group of patients that was statistically significant in the February 2016
release is different from the sub-group in the April 2015 release. In the April 2015
release, the company highlighted patients who had received MultiStem within a 24-
36 hour post-stroke treatment window. However, in the February 2016 release,
Athersys makes no mention of that 24-36 hour sub-group. Instead, Athersys only
highlights the <36 hour sub-group. This leads us to believe that the 24-36 treatment
window patient sub-group from the April 2015 release was no longer statistically
significant at 1-year follow up, and that Athersys data-mined again for another sub-
group and found the <36 hour patient sub-population. We believe this is a big red flag
in terms of lack of trial outcome consistency. While we cannot be certain that these
represent different patient populations, Athersys’ specific use of detailed time
windows leads us to conclude that the 24-36 hour treatment window patient sub-

group is distinct from the <36 hour treatment window patient sub-group and had
different results.


Lastly, the Excellent Outcome endpoint of the trial was pre-specified as a 90-day
endpoint, which suggests that 90 days is the appropriate time frame for this measure.
However, Athersys touted the Excellent Outcome measurement at 365-days and
ignored the failed 90-day endpoint.

Adam Feuerstein even wrote an article about “why Athersys' MultiStem spin job doesn't
work.”


The second zombie-inducing development was the partnership that Athersys signed
with Japanese startup biotech firm Healios K.K. in January 2016. In exchange for $15
million cash upfront and future milestones and royalties, Healios K.K. received exclusive
rights for the development of MultiStem for treating ischemic stroke in Japan, and began
making plans to start a Japanese clinical trial.


Frankly, we’re not sure why any investor would mistake this to be a very positive
development. First, there has been no new data on MultiStem since the failed Phase 2
trial in April 2015 that we have seen. Secondly, we point out that, unlike Chugai, which is
a respected pharmaceutical company in Japan, Healios K.K. is a startup with no history
of past success. We highlight some of the main differences below.

Investors should be concerned about Athersys' financial resources


We also point out that Healios K.K.’s share price has declined toward 52-week lows, we
were told by analysts who cover the company, due to Japanese investors’ concerns
over the MultiStem program.

Executives have been selling shares


Even if investors choose to ignore Athersys’ past failings with MultiStem, both clinically
and in terms of partnerships, we’re shocked that investors are overlooking what we see
as Athersys’ dire financial situation, one that poses an imminent risk to shareholders.
Athersys had $29 million of cash on its balance sheet, as of June 30, 2017, and has a
current cash burn rate of $22 million a year, as per the 3Q 2017 10-Q.


The company has yet to even initiate its pivotal trial for MultiStem in ischemic stroke in
the US and Europe, which the company stated will cost about $30 million in its last
earnings conference call. We believe this will surely increase the burn rate.


To review, we have a company that has $29 million of cash, is burning $22 million per
year, and needs another $30m to fund its long-term pivotal trial.


Keep in mind that this need exists after Athersys raised $23 million by issuing shares at
$1.01 per share in February 2017 and after tapping the Aspire Capital equity purchase
agreement by selling shares at $1.45 per share during the second quarter of 2016 (see
“8. Stockholders’ Equity” in 3Q 2017 10-Q).


Athersys was issuing stock well below current prices. With Athersys shares up over 40%
year to date and near 52-week highs, investors should be very concerned about
upcoming dilution given the company’s cash needs.


We believe the signal to sell has continued to be been given by executives at Athersys.
On September 19 after the close, Athersys’ President and Chief Operating Officer,
William (BJ) Lehmann, and the co-founder and now Executive Vice President and Chief
Scientific Officer, John Harrington, revealed in public filings that they sold Athersys stock
at average prices of $2.38 and $2.17, respectively.

We are short Athersys with a price target of $0


While these stock sales have been pursuant to 10b5-1 plans, we want to highlight that
Athersys executives have left their 10b5-1 plans in place even as Athersys shares hit
their lows earlier this year. It appears the executives have yet to pull their 10b5-1 plans
and continue to sell shares.


Given MultiStem’s long history of clinical trial failures, past failed partnerships, its current
partners’ weakness, and the significant liquidity issues we have observed, we are short
shares of Athersys with a price target of $0. We believe MultiStem, which is Athersys’
only major asset, is worthless and that the company will rapidly burn through all of its
cash within 12 months unless it substantially dilutes investors.

The risks to our short thesis is that MultiStem turns out to be effective in ischemic stroke
for patients who receive MultiStem 18-36 hours after the stroke. Athersys is planning on
commencing a pivotal Phase 3 trial for MultiStem in the US and in Europe, which to our
knowledge has no timeline for completion. We do not believe the trial has a good
probability of success due to the reasons we went through above, in particular its history
of clinical trial failures. We also believe that any potential upside in Athersys will be
diluted from future equity raises to fund operations and the expensive pivotal clinical
trial.


Another risk is that Athersys could sign up partners to help fund the trials, but we believe
this is unlikely or that any funding will be small. After Pfizer and Chugai terminated the
MultiStem agreements, MultiStem is unlikely to be an attractive partnership candidate.
Any future partnerships would probably be similar to the Healios K.K. contract, and have
a small upfront payment that will not do much to offset the underlying cash burn at
Athersys.
