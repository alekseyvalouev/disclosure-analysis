Questcor And The Chronic Disease Fund: Is Free Drug Truly Free?
Oct. 22, 2013 2:21 PM ET52 comments
by: Ikarian Point Research


In February of this year, we posted an article on Value Investors Club detailing the
aggressive accounting used by Linn Energy (LINE). Subsequently, on July 1, LINE
announced that the SEC launched an investigation into LINE's usage of problematic
accounting practices that artificially inflate their reported distributable cash flow
(NYSE:DCF). The result was an immediate 32% stock price decline and the real
possibility that LINE's $4 billion acquisition of Berry Petroleum (BRY) will be scuttled.
Questcor (QCOR) is another company with some questionable dealings and it is already
being investigated by the U.S. Attorney General's Office in Pennsylvania. In particular, we
question the manner in which Questcor conducts its free drug program in conjunction with
the Chronic Disease Fund. Given the issues we raise with Questcor detailed below, we
wonder what may come next.


Despite the fact that Questcor appears optically cheap, trading at just 13x 2013E EPS, we
believe the company's increasing reliance on its co-pay and free drug programs operated
in conjunction with the CDF can potentially put earnings at great risk as these programs
are scrutinized.


Say Hello to the Chronic Disease Fund


The Chronic Disease Fund (CDF) is the 45th largest charity in the United States. It is
bigger than Teach for America, the March of Dimes, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America
and Doctors Without Borders USA. Six years ago it raised a tenth of the $200m in
contributions it received in 2012. Its mission is to "support patients with chronic disease,
cancer, or other life-altering conditions and provides financial assistance for FDA-
approved specialty therapeutics used to treat those diseases." It performs this mission by
providing co-pay assistance to impoverished patients who could not afford the drugs
otherwise. Co-pay assistance donation dollars are largely solicited from pharmaceutical
and biotech companies whose expensive drugs are then purchased with those same
donations.


In other words, without these programs in existence, pharmaceutical and biotech
companies could not sell their drugs because no one can afford them. The most surprising
part of CDF's business is that it is not widely supported by the pharmaceutical community.

Rather, 80% of its donations come from just two drug companies. But the CDF does not
want you to know this fact and it has gone to great lengths to keep this truth and many
others hidden from the public.


The CDF Is Hiding Something


The Chronic Disease Fund is a 501(c)(3) charity, which means that it is a tax-exempt
charitable organization that receives a substantial part of its income from the general
public. To prove that the CDF is a bona fide charity and not a private foundation it must
meet either of two tests: the 33 1/3% test which requires it to receive one third or more of
its funding from the general public or the 10% facts and circumstances test which requires
it to receive 10% or more of its funding from the general public and meet several
requirements. The CDF misses the 33 1/3% test by a mile and claims it meets the 10%
facts and circumstances test. We question whether the CDF meets two requirements
necessary to meet this second test: 1) Does the organization receive support from a
representative number of persons? and 2) Does the organization have a governing body
representative of the broad interest of the public? We first note that the CDF is doing its
best to make sure the public does not know the identities of its major donors.


Charities must file a tax return with the IRS annually via a Form 990 and are required to
file Schedule B, Schedule of Contributors with their Form 990s every year. Schedule B
details the name, address and total contributions from every donor who has given more
than $5,000 in a given year. Form 990s are public information but the identity of large
donors can be redacted. Before 2009, the CDF complied with IRS regulations and
included its Schedule B in all of its Form 990 filings. In its 2008 990 filing, for example, it
noted in its filed Schedule B that it had seven large donors who collectively accounted for
97.8% of all donations ($90,138,000 out of $92,156,509). It clearly did not meet either the
33 1/3% test or the 10% facts and circumstances test and yet was deemed a bona fide
public charity by the IRS. Why? Because brand new charities have five years from
inception to meet either of these tests in order to be deemed a bona fide public charity by
the IRS.


So what happened in year six (2009)? The CDF stopped filing Schedule Bs with the IRS
despite noting on page 3 that "yes," the organization is required to complete Schedule B,
Schedule of Contributors. Even the State of California noticed the missing Schedule B and
requested that it be filed. In 2010, the CDF changed its mind and decided that "no," it did
not have to file a Schedule B (see page 3 on 2010 Form 990). This is seemingly a
violation of IRS rules regarding Form 990, which state that a charity must answer "yes" on

Line 2 in Section IV of Form 990 if the charity "received during the year contributions of
$5,000 or more from any one contributor" (see page 12). 2011 was the same for the CDF;
they said "no."


In 2012, the CDF changed its mind once again and said that "yes," it did have to file a
Schedule B with the IRS. It simply chose not to file it. In fact, in 2012 the CDF decided that
it only had to make public half of its Form 990, just the Schedule A. The 2012 Form 990
filed on the company's website as well as the same form listed with several states' charity
registries including North Carolina do not include more than half of the 2012 Form 990.
Where is the rest? Lucky for us, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) enabled us to
obtain the full 50 page document. The Schedule B is still missing! It would seem that the
CDF does not want anyone, including the IRS, to know who its major donors are.


We also note that the 2012 Audited Financial statements presented on the North Carolina
charity registry are incomplete; they are only eight pages long and are cut off right where
the Concentration footnote indicating the percentage of donations made by large
pharmaceutical companies normally resides. We spoke with the audit partner who
completed the audit for the CDF and he confirmed that the 2012 financial statements are,
in fact, 14 pages long -- and include a statement of cash flows. This is not a one-time
mistake because the same shortened filings are available on several other states' charity
registries. Misfiling financial statements and tax returns are not actions the IRS takes
lightly.


So what exactly is the CDF trying to hide? It might be the fact that the 2011 Audited
Financials highlight that 81% of its donations come from just two pharmaceutical
companies. We have spoken with attorneys who specialize in setting up charities and they
all said no pharmaceutical company's board of directors would ever be comfortable being
the source of more than 20% of total donations made to a single charity. Or maybe it's the
fact that the CDF is de facto controlled by its Founder and Chairman Michael Banigan who
has full control of the board per the charity's bylaws: "(A) General Appointment and
Removal Provisions: MICHAEL H. BANIGAN (i) shall appoint all Directors of the
Corporation, (ii) may remove any then serving Director of the Corporation, and (iii) may
designate and, once designated, remove successor Directors of the Corporation pursuant
to a written notification to the Board of the Corporation." This second fact about the CDF is
really the most interesting, and we explore it in detail below.


Due to the many reasons spelled out in this report, we believe that the CDF does not meet
the conditions of a bona fide charity pursuant to the IRS 10% facts and circumstances
rule.

It's All About Banigan


Michael Banigan is a serial entrepreneur and the founder and chairman of the CDF. As
shown above, he controls the board of the CDF. He also owns numerous businesses that
conduct millions of dollars of business annually with the CDF. We highlight page 2 of
Schedule L of the Complete CDF 2012 Form 990, which notes that CDF spent $7.8m on
services from three entities "controlled by an officer," CDF Services LP, Fourth Floor
Realty and CDF Rx, Inc. All three of these businesses as well as one other, DiseaseTrak,
are owned by Michael Banigan. All four of these businesses share an address with the
CDF itself, 6900 Dallas Parkway Suite 200 Plano, TX 75024. In total, these four for-profit
companies that Banigan owns have collected $41 million from the non-profit CDF the past
five years.


According to the CDF 2008 Form 990, "Chronic Disease Fund uses DiseaseTrak, a
software program supplied by the company, DiseaseTrak, a Delaware Corporation owned
by Chronic Disease Fund, Inc.'s President, Michael Banigan (formerly DBA Chronic
Disease Management Group). This agreement with DiseaseTrak was approved by the
Chronic Disease Fund board of directors after a competitive bid process." How
competitive could the process have been with Banigan as the owner of DiseaseTrak and
one other CDF Trustee, Travis DeWayne Manning, as president of DiseaseTrak, which
paid him $270,000 in salary in 2008? What's amazing is the fact that the CDF 2012 Form
990 on page 35 states,


"All transactions are approved by the company's Board of Directors with any
organization associated with board member prior to the transactions."


Banigan controls the Board! He can elect and dismiss any of them at will. The CDF
Board's independence needs to be called into question.


CDF Services LP, another Banigan company, was merged into a successor company
called Sonexus Health, also owned by Banigan. Sonexus Health says on its website,


"After listening intently to the needs of specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers,
Sonexus Health responded -- by developing integrated pharmaceutical
commercialization solutions that now enable manufacturers to own their relationship
with physicians and patients and control their product through the supply chain."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-truly-free 5/24


Unsurprisingly, Sonexus Health's corporate office shares the exact same address with the
CDF. Michael Banigan's brother Jim is also an employee, working as president of
Financial Solutions. Jon Kwiatkowski, division president of Pharmacy Services at Sonexus
Health and former senior director of CDF Rx, is also employed by the CDF as a senior
director; he was paid $147,992 for his work at the CDF in 2012, working 40 hours a week.
He must be a workaholic, working 40 hours per week for the CDF while also working for
the pharmacy division at Sonexus Health. We discuss the interrelationship between
Sonexus Health, the CDF and Questcor in more detail below.


The Complete CDF 2012 Form 990 highlights one other way that Banigan has been able
to enrich himself as a result of his control of the CDF. He had the CDF purchase
DiseaseTrak for $36.5 million in 2012 (check page 29 -- Schedule D Part X). Again, we
note that this transaction was left out of the 2012 Form 990 filed on CDF's own website.
What's not clear is why a charity needs to own a business like this, or a specialty
pharmacy like CDF Rx.


These facts call into question whether the CDF meets one very important piece of the
10% facts and circumstances test, "Does the organization have a governing body
representative of the broad interest of the public?" It would seem, rather, that the CDF
exists to enrich both pharmaceutical companies like Questcor as well as its chairman
Michael Banigan.


Questcor's Free Drug Program Isn't Free


Defenders of Questcor will argue, "Questcor discloses how much money they give to co-
pay assistance programs in their SEC filings." This is true: In the last four quarters,
Questcor has reported that it has donated $11.3m (up 200% Y/Y) to co-pay assistance
programs to help patients obtain Acthar. Assuming patients averaged a 10% co-pay
means that this program generated $113m in sales for Questcor, 19% of QCOR's total net
sales during that time. The fact that these co-pay assistance payments are growing at
such a rapid rate, up 200% Y/Y ($11.3m the past four quarters) and up 65% Y/Y in the
most recent quarter ($3.2m), indicates that Questcor is increasingly relying on these sorts
of programs to boost sales.


What Questcor does not say is that they are also increasingly relying on their free drug
program to direct patients to the CDF and its affiliates. In the past year Questcor has
donated $177m (29% of net sales during that period -- up 90% Y/Y) of free drug to
patients in the U.S. This program to-date has donated $360m worth of free Acthar to
patients according to the company's most recently filed 10-Q. Questcor notes in its SEC

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-truly-free 6/24


filings that it does "not recognize any revenue from the Acthar free drug program." Again,
this is technically true. However, we believe these free vials are vital to Questcor's
misleading business plan.


The CDF is the only charity in the country that owns its own specialty pharmacy, CDF Rx.
While CDF Rx's mere existence is key to understanding CDF's relationship with Questcor,
we note that it does not appear to do much except distribute free vials of drug from
Questcor. We visited CDF Rx's offices in Plano, TX and saw no one working when we
looked through the heavily tinted windows of the office, one floor below that of the CDF
itself. The 2009 CDF Annual Report highlights the fact that the organization planned to
open its own pharmacy designed exclusively for free drug programs called CDF Rx the
following year. The original goal was for CDF Rx to be a separate charity, but it never was
able to file a Form 990 with the IRS. This timing is noteworthy because the very first time
Questcor mentions in its SEC filings that it works with the CDF was in its Q2 2010 10-Q.


It is clear that 2010 was the first year that Questcor sought CDF's aid; the 2009 CDF
Annual Report reported that it did not cover any diseases treated by Acthar. The 2010
CDF Annual Report, however, notes that the organization started covering acute
exacerbations of multiple sclerosis and nephrotic syndrome, two diseases treated by
Questcor's Acthar. The 2011 CDF Annual Report added exacerbations of lupus to its list of
Funded Diseases. This is the same year that Questcor started marketing this usage of
Acthar to physicians. Questcor sought the CDF's aid because high priced drugs like
Acthar run into problems with reimbursement because insurers demand prior
authorization.


In the same 10-Q that Questcor first mentions working with the CDF it also mentions
another charitable organization, the National Organization for Rare Disorders
(NYSE:NORD), that it works with to provide assistance to patients. One quick fact we wish
to highlight: NORD no longer has an active program funding Acthar prescriptions
according to NORD employees we spoke with. This means that the all of Questcor's co-
pay assistance dollars and free drug vials are going to the CDF and no other charitable
organization.


Questcor has had problems with insurance companies reimbursing patients for
administration of Acthar. Aetna, for instance, "considers repository corticotropin [Acthar]
not medically necessary for corticosteroid-responsive conditions [like multiple sclerosis]
because it has not been proven to be more effective than corticosteroids for these
indications. Aetna considers repository corticotropin experimental and investigational for
all other indications because its effectiveness for these indications has not been

established." Other insurance companies require a large amount of data from a potential
patient's doctor indicating that alternative treatments, like much cheaper corticosteroids,
have not been effective in treating the patient's disease. This process is known as prior
authorization. This is a big barrier to adoption of Acthar because it is so expensive and
because the medical literature surrounding its efficacy is limited. Questcor, however, has
remained undeterred.


Questcor has a real problem with patients who have insurance with companies like Aetna
or are uninsured. The free drug program with the CDF enables Questcor to fix these
problems. When a patient contacts the CDF looking for assistance they are often given
free drug, administered by their referring physician, to start treatment immediately. This
free drug, distributed by the non-profit CDF Rx, comes with a catch: the patient must file
for insurance via CDF-affiliated Sonexus Health, a for-profit marketing company. Sonexus
Health offers "Prior Authorization" solutions on its website. What these solutions really
entail is that Sonexus handles all of the referring physician's paperwork. This is an
extremely important step in the process as most doctors are skeptical about the benefits
of a decades-old drug that has not been in a successful NDA-approved clinical trial.


However, when the doctor is relieved of having to fill out numerous forms as well as argue
for hours with insurance companies about why the drug is necessary he might be willing to
give the drug a chance. We do not know whether there are any stronger inducements
offered to referring physicians but we would not be surprised given the Attorney General
investigation mentioned in the opening of this report. Ultimately, Sonexus Health and the
CDF may be successful in finding the patient an insurance company willing to take them
on; they often apply to three or more simultaneously. We believe that the CDF is in a great
position to know which insurance companies are covering Acthar because they can share
data with Sonexus Health and thus may have the ability to direct patients to those carriers.
The patient is fine with the arrangement because the CDF pays for their co-pays AND
their insurance premiums, if necessary.


The deal is great for the doctors because Sonexus Health takes care of all of the heavy
lifting and can intimate that someone, often the CDF, will handle the co-pay. The
simultaneous distribution of free drug, marketing to doctors and co-pay assistance is what
makes this arrangement so outrageous. Sonexus, as a for-profit company, should never
be allowed to handle the co-pay but with a non-profit like the CDF along for the ride this
arrangement can be accomplished. As more and more insurance companies balk at

paying millions of dollars for a drug with limited demonstrated efficacy the problem for
Questcor will compound: the number of insurance companies who pay for Acthar will
continue to shrink.


Finally, we think it is instructive to point out one very important conclusion we reached.
While we have named several different entities, the CDF, CDF Rx, CDF Services LP,
DiseaseTrak, Sonexus Health, we believe the truth is that they are simply one large
commingled entity sharing an office suite and controlled by just one man.


The OIG Opinion Loophole


Pharmaceutical companies cannot donate money to charities explicitly to purchase drugs
made by those same companies as such an arrangement would violate the anti-kickback
statute of the Social Security Act. Violation of the statute is a felony. The CDF, however,
found a clever away around this rule; drug companies that donate money to the CDF for
co-pay assistance programs cannot earmark their donations for specific drugs but can
earmark them for certain disease states (a "Funded Disease"). The CDF got the Office of
Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
approve this type of arrangement in an Advisory Opinion dated Sept. 14, 2006.


We note that the OIG issued its opinion relying "solely on the facts and information
presented to us. We have not undertaken an independent investigation of such
information. This opinion is limited to the facts presented. If material facts have not been
disclosed or have been misrepresented, this opinion is without force and effect." The OIG
relies so much on just the data presented to it that it turned a blind eye to the fact that the
CDF's chairman, Michael Banigan, owns DiseaseTrak noting in Footnote 4,


"We have not been asked about, and express no opinion regarding, any
arrangement between [Requestor] and the entity [DiseaseTrak] providing therapy
management services."


The CDF currently maintains 37 separate 'Disease Trusts' with separate funds for each
disease state. The CDF helps patients obtain funding for 78 distinct drugs, including
Questcor's Acthar, to treat these diseases. We highlight three curious items: 1) every
single indication for Acthar that currently generates revenue for Questcor is on the CDF's
covered disease list (acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, lupus, infantile spasms,
nephrotic syndrome, polymyositis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and Ankylosing
spondylitis -- the last four all added in the last year when Questcor started marketing these
usages of Acthar to physicians); 2) among the 78 drugs approved for reimbursement by

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-truly-free 9/24


the CDF only Questcor's Acthar is approved for treatment of nephrotic syndrome, infantile
spasms and acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis; and 3) while most of the drugs
listed are trademarked only H.P. Acthar Gel is shown as such. It would seem that
Questcor's lawyers (who else would think of adding a trademark?) have a direct line into
the CDF. We note that the three indications listed above for which only Acthar can be
prescribed combine to account for approximately 80% of Questcor's sales. In other words,
if anyone, including Questcor, donates money to the CDF and earmarks its use for one of
these three Disease States only Questcor's Acthar can be prescribed and purchased.


The OIG also notes that pharmaceutical company donors are not allowed to receive
specific patient or drug data from the CDF. The OIG states,


"Upon request, Requestor informs donors of the aggregate number of all applicants
for assistance for particular Funded Diseases and the aggregate number of patients
qualifying for assistance for particular Funded Diseases. Requestor does not provide
donors with any individual patient information. Requestor's reports to donors do not
contain any information that would enable a donor to correlate the amount or
frequency of its donations with the number or medical condition of patients that use
its product or services."


The sanctity of this relationship is paramount; pharmaceutical companies are not allowed
to know how exactly their donations are used or else the arrangement may be viewed as a
kickback. The law forbids them from knowing exactly how many patients are treated or if
they were even treated with their drug.


Take a look at the 2012 CDF Patient Application. In order to be considered as a patient, a
person is required to authorize the CDF to share their demographic and contact
information as well as physician name, disease and drug treatment information. Patients
appear to then be required to agree to let the CDF share the information with the for-profit
Sonexus Health which does not have to play by the same rules as the non-profit CDF. An
authorized recipient like Sonexus Health may then "re-disclose" the information,
seemingly without limitation. Who else but Sonexus Health's clients, pharmaceutical
companies like Questcor, would want such information? It's a catch-22: patients cannot
obtain assistance unless they disclose certain information and authorize the CDF to share
it with companies like Sonexus Health.


Ultimately, we believe that the closeness with which the CDF, CDF Rx, Sonexus Health
and Questcor conduct their operations makes the separation required to make these
dealings kosher is a near impossibility. We have heard from experts in the field that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-truly-free 10/24


several large pharmaceutical companies have declined to donate to patient assistance
charities like NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders) because NORD could not
give the pharmaceutical companies the patient count or specific drug usage data. They
felt that donating money to an organization like NORD, without any resultant data, would
just go to help pay for a competitor's drug. This does not seem to be a problem for
Questcor and its involvement with the CDF.


In its conclusion, the OIG ruled that the CDF can operate a co-pay assistance program as
long as it remains, "an independent, nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that operates with
absolute, independent, and autonomous discretion as to the use of donor contributions."
For all of the reasons detailed above, we believe Banigan's control of the CDF and its
numerous affiliates violates this first and most important requirement.


There is one other line in the OIG's opinion that caught our attention as it relates to a
revelation highlighted in the beginning of a recent Barron's article (subscription required)
questioning Questcor's relationship with the CDF. The OIG notes,


"No donor or affiliate of any donor… exerts any direct or indirect influence or control
over Requestor or Requestor's program."


This statement is curious to us as we wish to know how Questcor knew the identities of
certain registrants of the CDF's yearly conference. Later in the OIG's opinion it notes,


"Donors do not receive any information regarding other donors, except that
Requestor's annual report and list of donations may be public available, as required
by the IRS."


Even the Department of Health and Human Services knows the CDF should file a
Schedule B! But we digress: If Questcor and the CDF are truly independent and Questcor
does not exert any 'indirect influence or control' over the CDF then how would Questcor
obtain this information and why would they send threatening letters from their lawyers to
the canceled registrants?


We are confident that a supposed charity working hand in hand with a for-profit company
marketing high priced drugs is not what the OIG had in mind when it approved the CDF's
program. We also believe the OIG has been made aware of the arrangement between the
CDF and Questcor. Finally, the OIG concludes its opinion on the CDF by stating,



http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904462504579137163650125276.html?mod=BOL_hps_mag#articleTabs_article%3D0

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-truly-free 11/24


"The OIG reserves the right to reconsider the questions and issues raised in this
advisory opinion and, where the public interest requires, to rescind, modify, or
terminate this opinion."


There Is Precedent Here


Barron's just questioned the coziness with which Questcor and the CDF conduct their
operations. The outcome of this outing in the press is yet to be determined. We can,
however, point to a similar situation involving the Wall Street Journal and a program
similar to the CDF called Patient Services, Inc. (PSI). In a December 2005 article called
"Through Charities, Drug Makers Help People - and Themselves" (subscription required),
the WSJ wrote a few choice lines:


"Under this support system, drug-company money keeps patients insured -- and
keeps insurers paying for the high-priced medicine. 'It's a win-win situation,' says
Dana Kuhn, co-founder and president of Patient Services, a Midlothian, Va., charity,
which solicits money from drug companies. 'Patients are helped and companies are
helped. They make a small contribution to help the patient and get much more
money back when the insurer pays for the drug.' … When he makes his pitch to
companies, Mr. Kuhn says he emphasizes that they can make money by donating.
… After the favorable [OIG] opinion, Mr. Kuhn says he found drug-company
executives eager to donate. 'You could see the dollar signs shining in their eyes and
they would jump over the table and say, 'When can I start?'"


The immediate result of the press generated from this article was a 40% reduction in
donations made to PSI the following year. It would seem that the WSJ's reporting had a
material impact on the usage of these co-pay programs by pharmaceutical companies.
Perhaps they feared an investigation by any number of government entities including the
IRS, HHS, OIG or DOJ. PSI is still in operation today but has largely cleaned up its act
according to informed persons we spoke with. We also think it is important to highlight
some differences between PSI to the CDF. First, the CDF is massive: it is more than 3x
PSI's size. Further, according to PSI's 2012 Form 990 (filed in totality on their website) it
met the 33 1/3% test handily: 49% of total support was from the public. Compare that to
CDF's lowly 16%. Finally, we note that none of PSI's Trustees own any affiliates with
which PSI conducts its business.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-truly-free 12/24


Very little in life is free and while patients who work with the CDF may not pay anything for
their Acthar prescriptions, those same prescriptions are certainly not free for insurers or
Medicare. Programs like these can artificially boost drug prices which insurers as well as
the federal government ultimately pay for. The future of such programs we believe is
uncertain.


We do not mean to suggest that all patient assistance programs are illegal, as we are
aware that there are several legitimate ones in existence. The CDF, however, by virtue of
its reliance on two huge donors, it's seemingly special relationship with Questcor, its
wholly owned specialty pharmacy, a long history of inaccurately filing financial statements
and tax returns, enormous riches generated for insiders and close association with several
for-profit companies that share the same office space is not your run-of-the-mill patient
assistance program. If there really were armed guards at CDF's yearly conference,
according to Barron's, this would seem to demonstrate that they were very nervous about
these facts being exposed. Questcor's actions would also seem to indicate that they are
equally determined to see that its relationship with the CDF does not see the light of day.
There is a long history of the Department of Justice and HHS Office of Inspector General
investigating these organizations and we believe that when they look at the CDF and
Questcor neither will stand up well to the scrutiny.


We estimate that nearly 50% of Questcor's revenues are generated as a direct result of its
relationship with the CDF, and if this arrangement is ever modified or canceled a huge
portion of earnings could be negatively impacted. Given the company's high incremental
margins, we estimate that EPS could get cut by 60% if Questcor were no longer working
with the CDF. If this were to happen then run-rate earnings would be approximately $2.30,
and we think an appropriate multiple would be 10x. Our target price is thus $23.00 (-63%).

The writer joins the growing list of Wall St. "whores" who provide duplicitous information full of innuendos, mistruths
and in many cases lies. How propitious it is that a week before earnings Barron's comes out with an article followed
by this wordy, overbearing piece of ......... Oh and then there's Adam Feurstein innocently tweeting his little brains out.
For those that don't know he's one of Jim Cramers little hatchet men. What a merry band of thieves. All toiling hard to
drive the price down before Oct. 29th when earnings will blow them up. 
Advice to this "writer"...cut down on the verbiage, do some due diligence on your grammar and learn a little more
about the subject at hand before taking a hatchet to it. Pathetic shorts, getting nervous.

Desperate attempt by short sellers to control the share price of Questcor, with near certain terrific earnings one week
away, and many clinical catalysts on the near term horizon.


Last I knew, the CDF assisted economically disadvantaged patients with the co-pays on 80-100 drugs, Acthar Gel
among them. And the program was approved the Office of Inspector General.


But go to their web site and check it out for yourself.

If the drug is so "unproven" as you suggest then why is QCOR spending more and more money on more and more
studies to show the drug's effectiveness in treating more and more conditions. Either you know more about the drug
than they do or they are eager to crush the business by publishing a bunch of studies showing the drug is useless.
You also suggest doctors who prescribe it are dummies who do it only because CDF Rx helps with the paperwork.
And you suggest insurance companies are dummies for reimbursing the drug after getting all the paperwok they
themselves require. And you also suggest the FDA are dummies for clarifying the Acthar label in 2010 (we are not
talking about the 1950s original approval) and including 19 indications for which Acthar is effective. The way I see it,
the drug works and that is why it is being prescribed, the drug is expensive so insurance companies don't want to pay
for it unless it is used as last resort, the required paperwok is tedious so QCOR (directly or through partners) helps
with the reimbursement process. The idea that QCOR would lose 50% of revenue if it stopped its relationship with
CDF sounds hard to believe...another assumption on your part, that QCOR management are dummies too...so far the
only dummies have been the shorts.

Ok. Let me get this straight. Author estimates 50% of sales are generated through this relationship with CDF. And
further, that IF, QCOR stops working with CDF on this program, their EPS could be reduced by 60%. Questions:


1) Where do you get the details to support this? 
2) What facts suggest that QCOR would want to sever this relationship? Is this based ONLY on your theory that
something "may" be going on, that someone "may" want to investigate, that if they do, they "might" find something
that isn't right and force the separation of a partnership?


In the meantime, QCOR is expecting a blow out quarter, right?

Valuable Insights, Contributor
You ought to be ashamed of yourself - bashing a stock in your first SA article, and you're short!


Just because 
1) The company has a history of selling its drug off-label 
2) Is currently under investigation 
3) Appears to have a way too cozy relationship with a charity 
4) A charity which, by the way, does not appear to be filing all appropriate regulatory filings, and is way too much into
self-dealing, and 
5) You did thorough research, including speaking to multiple chartable organizations to understand industry norms... 
Doesn't mean that it's a short.


Come on, the stock chart is up and to the right and management is beating it's chest (we'll ignore the ongoing insider
selling) so it's gotta be good...no, it's gotta be great.


To the poster above who profited by buying near lows when Linn took a plunge...were you around a decade ago - and
did you buy Enron.


This will end badly for longs - great first article.


Disclosure - NO POSITION, but know the stock well and will consider initiating a short position in the next 72 hours.

If you know the stock so well you would realize that these types of articles have been written over and over
again. Usually by people that just suddenly show up out of nowhere. They make claims that are negative for
the stock price short term, but which are later proven to be untrue, malicious, and manipulative of the facts.
Please initiate your short before earning, and see how well it all ends.


22 Oct 2013, 05:07 PM 


Mongoose7916
@ Valuable Insights If you initiate a short position before earnings you are going to get killed! Even with all the
volatility surrounding QCOR all the company has done is execute on their business plan and grow the
business. But apparently that is not good enough for the shorts as they think QCOR should be assigned a
multiple so low that it would be the most hated S&P stock by at least a factor of three. Combine this with all of
the criticisms of QCOR which have been blatantly false and the timing of this hit piece and it is no wonder that
people are having a negative reaction. But since you seem so sure of yourself lets go through a list of all the
supposed problems there have been with QCOR over the last year checklist style. 
-Aetna's reimbursement of Acthar- Aetna never actually explicitly stated they would be denying the drug only
that the review process would be more intense. 
-Stock drop on Citron report- Citron links Aetna's bulletin in their short report five days after the bulletin had
been published as reason other insurance companies would also likely not reimburse Acthar. 
-Insurance companies- no insurance companies have come out denying coverage for Acthar. 
-Acthar is too expensive- Not even close to the most expensive orphan drug out there. 
-Competition by Sycthan(typo)- Questcor has acquired this rival drug which was supposed to provide
competition.


So it would seem that shorts are left to speculate on whether QCOR is involved in a fraud and then also
speculate on how damaging the fraud will be once it is substantiated. And all of this occurring a week before
another blowout quarter. So forgive me and the other posters in this comment thread if we don't fall in love
with these allegations and immediately sell our shares. 
But since you know the name so well Valuable Insights and this is so likely to end badly for longs I implore
you Valuable Insights please short QCOR before another earnings beat you seem to know so much more
about this stock than I.


22 Oct 2013, 05:21 PM 


Mongoose7916
Wow Valuable Insights did not realize you have been bearish on QCOR for so long. Just checked your
comments thread and you have been bearish on QCOR since it was in the mid to low 20s. Good thing you
weren't short back then or you would be hurting pretty bad.

Sbremer/Mongoose - Appreciate the advice on how to manage money and time my investments. We believe
there are currently numerous good shorts (and longs) and timing is of the essence. No doubt we've been
investing since you were in grade school. We have no desire to be run over by runaway trains so our shorts
need to be well-timed. Perhaps a post-earnings short will make sense...our call. We like to see catalysts.


Check out our track record on this site. We have only recommended 2 shorts, Groupon and Millenial Media in
articles - each was well-loved, and each fell by over 50%. We're particularly proud of MM ( http://bit.ly/SN3Oin
) since we were right for all the right reasons - since the article MM is down 50%+, the NAS up 25%+, and
advertising/internet/m... darlings are all much higher. Could say we nailed it.


Incidentally, everyone should get off the conspiracy theory bandwagon. There's not some secret committee
ruling Wall Street out to manipulate stocks and bash otherwise pristine, precious companies.

You are a pompous AH. You compare an Enron to this company with a drug that truly works wonders for
seriously ill individuals with incurable autoimmune inflammatory disorders. A drug of last choice, and it works
in spite of your despicable short community spreading the usual lies and innuendos. Condemning a
philanthropic effort to provide the medication to needy patients is a pathetic response. In this world making a
profit is not sinful and helping to alleviate suffering is admirable. 
Did you ever, in your narrow minded world, see a person with MS, or Lupus or an infant suffering life
threatening spasms? I am sure not and if you did you would be the one to look away. You couldn't hold a
candle to the many researchers searching for treatments and cures and the corporate entities who bankroll
the research. Selling a drug off label is not an uncommon practice in the world of medicine because it can
effect a cure or a remission of a serious disease. You have no clue and you are simply wallowing in a swamp
of ignorance.

1 - please short immediately - go big. 
2 - after watching a few weeks of p/l vol, ponder how a drug with 19 approved indications can really be sold

I just want to point out that the stock is now 8% higher since you were thinking about shorting it. You're
probably much more compelled to short it now (I'm glad you haven't shorted at the open, because you would
have lost 8% already.)


It would be great if you can announce the timing of your short position or the lack of it, in the next couple of
days. Also, if you've got time, I'd be happy to read your short thesis, if you can lay it out in an article before
earnings.


Thank you,

He already backed off his position of shorting in the next 72 hours to shorting QCOR after earnings. Valuable
insights is not stupid. He is wrong on QCOR but he does know what he is doing. The one thing that he
doesn't seem to grasp is that shorting a stock is a whole different kind of ballgame as you are not just
presenting a thesis and executing on it, you also have to constantly determine sentiment of the longs who are
involved in the stock. His previous experience of shorting the likes of groupon and millennial media which had
expensive valuations and comparing the likes of QCOR to them is off the mark. When you have battleground
stocks an increase in the price will be determined most often by the numbers the company is able to produce
at earnings. And when looking at an earnings chart of QCOR it is about as pretty as it could possibly be.
Anyone should be wary of shorting stocks it surprises me the kind of carefree attitude many people have
when it comes to shorting as if a good short is = to a good long. But regardless of my opinions of shorting
their are very clearly some indicators which should make anyone rethink their short position. 
-Positive free cash flow- Check for QCOR 
-Cheap Valuation- Check 
-Dividend- Check 
-Stock buybacks- Check 
-Earnings growth- Check 
-Buy out candidate- Check 
If any one of those criteria is met a person should probably stay from shorting the stock and QCOR matches
all of them. If a person goes against my checklist (or some other arbitrary list which they deem acceptable
that QCOR is likely on) they have better have some damn good information that has hard evidence and a
smoking gun. If the shorts want to argue they make their decisions strictly on technicals then it is true that
technicals may come into play which can make any stock a short candidate and if valuable insights believes
QCOR will fall into that category at some point I am not inclined to disagree with him.

Questcor provides free vials of Acthar, to support a patient assistance program administered by the National
Organization of Rare Disorders, or NORD. From September 2007 through June 30, 2013, the commercial value of
Acthar vials provided through this program approximates $360 million. This value is based on our selling price at the
time, though the vials are not sold, and we do not recognize any revenue or net sales from this Acthar free drug
program.


Separately, Questcor makes charitable contributions, in dollars, to the Chronic Disease Fund, which administers co-
pay assistance programs. In the quarter ended June 30, 2013, Questcor contributed approximately $3.1 million to the
Chronic Disease Fund in support of its co-pay assistance programs. Amounts provided to the Chronic Disease Fund

The author leaves out a few important details about Acthar Gel and Questcor.


1. In the majority of cases, Acthar is a last line therapy, meaning physician specialists will only prescribe Acthar when
first and second line therapies fail. Said another way, Acthar is prescribed primarily for challenged, compromised and
even desperate patient populations.


Does the author seriously have issues with these patients receiving assistance with co-pays if financial need is
established? Whew. That's cold.


2. Co-pay help or not--insurers are rarely (almost never) going to approve Acthar unless other therapies have failed.
Most insurer reimbursement policy bulletins state this condition in no uncertain terms.


In my mind, helping seriously ill, financially compromised patients with co-pays is a great concept. Alleviate their
suffering if possible, get them back on their feet as contributing citizens. Works for me.

Organization of Rare Disorders, or NORD. From September 2007 through June 30, 2013, the commercial value of
Acthar vials provided through this program approximates $360 million. This value is based on our selling price at the
time, though the vials are not sold, and we do not recognize any revenue or net sales from this Acthar free drug
program.


Separately, Questcor makes charitable contributions, in dollars, to the Chronic Disease Fund, which administers co-
pay assistance programs. In the quarter ended June 30, 2013, Questcor contributed approximately $3.1 million to the
Chronic Disease Fund in support of its co-pay assistance programs. Amounts provided to the Chronic Disease Fund
result in a deduction from Questcor¹s gross revenue in the calculation of its net sales, as disclosed in the
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section.

Thank you so much for your expose. I've been a shareholder of QCOR for over a year now. Had no idea how corrupt
the company can be. I'll sell all my shares pronto tomorrow morning. Surely I don't want to be associated with such a
sinister company. The Streetsweepers and Citrons of the world tried their best to bring QCOR down to no avail. But
now this, for sure QCOR's management better change their business practices or face the wrath of the US Attorney
General's Office in Pennsylvania. Or you really mean the US Attorney's Office - Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Wasn't sure if they're the same thing.

I was wondering if you can list any of your references in regards to this article. Thanks

To valuableinsights and lidisum, how you thinks this article makes any sense is beyond me. There is little to no
fundamental support in the points of argument, only drawn out verbiage knocking down the company....oh wait, is this
a week before earnings...after Barron's released a completely bogus short article...and you all forgot to cover your
positions?...No, couldn't be. Where did you receive the 50% of revenue is generated from the CDF and if the
relationship were to end there would be a 60% drop in EPS? I'd love to see some tables, charts or analysis of the
history of their revenue and EPS gains as a result of their relationship with the CDF. If you want to start delving into
conspiracy theories maybe you should take a look at the short publications being released a week before
earnings...maybe that's where the SEC should start their investigation.

Further to holycow's point about the somewhat fantastic last paragraph: according to the Barron's article, Questcor
donated $3.1m to CDF for Q2 (ie. quarter ending June 2013). For that same quarter, non-GAAP revenues were ~
196m. Assuming a range of 10-20% for copays, the CDF donations would then blow up into a range of $15.5m to
$31m, ie. a range of roughly 8 to 16% of revenues. Not 50%!!


Even assuming CDF's tax status were canceled, and its functions closed down (unlikely considering the number of
other drugs and companies involved, with Questcor only a smallish player in the mix - but assume it), Questcor would
always be free to set up a similar arrangement with another such charity. There would be plenty of time while the
proceedings against CDF went on.

Once again the short seller's silliness rises to a fever pitch only days from Questcor's earnings release where short's
are trapped and are facing pps estimates rising to $100 post earnings. On some days short's account for 70% of the
volume. Not only are the whisper numbers portending yet another blowout, the huge catalysts from multiple trials are
expected over subsequent months which in the words of QCOR will transform the company in 2014.  
Many investors already know the dirty tricks hedge funds use (see Jon Stewart's interview with Cramer -utube) but it
is almost always the shorts that conjure up a "hit piece" full of dazzling half truths, misleading statistics, and outright
lies which they of course hope will lead to a sell first, ask questions never response. But QCOR investors are a hardy,
well informed bunch, we own one of the most manipulated stocks ever traded but still quarter after quarter the
earnings and cash grow and the naysayers become believers or they become poor.

This author is absolutely shameless. At the begining of this article, this author even brags about the dirty work done
on Linn Energy.

Hey Mr. Short ....how's your stomach today? A little sour and churning? You are going to get decimated and all your
drivel that you wrote won't save you. Up over 6% at this moment. Have a nice day.

Good article.


Perhaps he wanted to buy more QCOR yesterday.

So the CDF was the real target of this article? I mean, if they were slimy, wouldn't QCOR just establish a relationship
with another charity? Maybe a small disruption while that's occurring?

One day and $5 a share against your shorts, feeling a little tighter?

And yet no response from the author...

lockeptrv
The article alludes several times to 2 large drug companies that are the basis of the CDF's support. Is there some law
that inhibits the publishing of the companies names?

This wandering diatribe misses the point entirely.


Does Acthar Gel work?


Acthar Gel has saved thousands of lives and improved tens of thousands of lives over the last half century. It is
broadly approved for use by the FDA, and has proven to be safe and effective. Why this random journey down rabbit
holes?

Inflection Point - What do you think of $QCOR now? 
Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc.(QCOR) is trading 3.2% higher at $71.87 after-hours as the company reports Q3 EPS
of $1.68, better than CIQ consensus estimates of $1.20, and 73% higher than 2012 Q3 EPS of $0.97.


Revenues of $236.3 million handily beat CIQ consensus of $199.7 million, and were 68% higher than revenues of

You still short?

I've reviewed the 990 return for 2012 in depth and spotted a number of irregularities. I understand your wish to remain
anonymous, but I would like to discuss these with you at some point as I think both of us would find it helpful and/or
profitable. I can be reached thru m website at http://www.LittleBear.us or my twitter feed @zackfoot

I worked for CDF for 7 years, as well as 2 of the other affiliate businesses listed. It's eye opening to compare this to
what they tell you while you work there.
