Blue Earth: Strong Sell On Law Enforcement Investigation, Fraud
Allegations And Paid Stock Promotion
Oct. 21, 2014 10:47 AM ET35 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


BBLU CEO Johnny Thomas and John Francis have presided over financial disasters
at many companies, including ABTX, which resulted in fraud allegations and
bankruptcy.


A recent FOIA response from the SEC indicates evidence of a current law
enforcement investigation related to BBLU.


BBLU has hired multiple questionable stock promoters, including the infamous John
Liviakis, who was involved in countless stock market wipeouts.


Multiple accounting red flags, including BBLU's previous auditor's license revoked
and barred, while the current BBLU auditor has multiple PCAOB deficiencies,
including "failure to perform sufficient audit procedures".


BBLU CHP business already failing with due diligence turning up serious regulatory
risks that could make it "not viable", while traffic battery business has apparently
already failed before.


I believe Blue Earth (NASDAQ:BBLU) is a reverse merger with paid stock promoters that
has immediate -93.3% downside with longer-term bankruptcy risk.


BBLU is a questionable reverse merger led by CEO Johnny Thomas and Vice President
John Francis, a team involved with numerous failed rollups that have wiped investors out.
Thomas and Francis are now applying their rollup strategy anew with BBLU. These
executives were co-founders and executives at the famous AgriBioTech (formerly ABTX,
ABT) shareholder wipeout that occurred during the late 1990s, which led to a plethora of
lawsuits and fraud accusations after the SEC forced ABTX to restate its financials - the
result was the loss of nearly a billion dollars of market capitalization and bankruptcy. More
recently , these two presided over Consolidation Services (formerly CNSV), also a near
total wipeout for shareholders. Curiously, neither CEO Johnny Thomas nor John Francis
have any real renewable energy or power plant operation experience that I could find at
all, leading me to question why they are even involved in BBLU.

Furthermore, BBLU has hired many of the most questionable paid stock promoters on
Wall Street to tout their stock. Among them is the infamous stock promoter John Liviakis
who was also involved in the ABTX wipeout and sold his entire stake before the SEC
forced the company to revise its financial statements. In the case of BBLU, Liviakis is a
current shareholder but has allowed himself to be diluted significantly. Meanwhile, BBLU is
60% owned by retail investors who have been drawn into the promotion, but I don't believe
they know the real history of this company and the people involved.


Furthermore, a recent SEC FOIA response indicates evidence of a current law
enforcement investigation. While the SEC has not released details of what this could be
about, I do not view this as a positive. Meanwhile, BBLU's previous auditor Lake &
Associates had their license revoked and were barred. BBLU's current auditor HJ &
Associates has multiple PCAOB deficiencies spanning a gamut of issues outlined below.


Now after the failures of Xnergy and Castrovilla, research into the new traffic signal battery
business turns up evidence that it seems to have already failed once with ProGenix's
previous partner having moved on to lead acid batteries. Furthermore, BBLU's much
touted CHP business appears completely unviable while facing a shocking regulatory
headwind that could make the entire thing "not viable" per BBLU partner JBS.


BBLU currently trades for a sky-high P/E of 268x using optimistic estimates and given that
the value of all acquired businesses BBLU bought to build their company total just $63.5
million, BBLU's current $200 million market cap is absurd in my view. Even using wildly
optimistic estimates BBLU has -93.3% downside, but based on all of the above, I believe
BBLU is a terminal short on an inevitable path to $0.


I believe the evidence is irrefutable and has been linked, cited and sourced for you.


AgriBioTech: Fraud Allegations, SEC Investigation, Accounting Issues, Lawsuits and
Bankruptcy


The collapse of Johnny Thomas' AgriBioTech was so disastrous it is literally used as a
published example of a stock market debacle by David Faber. The issues at ABTX ran the
gamut from an SEC investigation, allegations of a "massive fraud", alleged revenue
"double counting", financial restatements, "accounting manipulations", CEO
contradictions, margin calls for executives, lawsuits, and then bankruptcy as shareholders
lost everything, ultimately wiping out more than $1,000,000,000 of equity value. A full
summary of this debacle is beyond the scope of this report, but it will certainly go down in

history as one of the worst stock market disasters of all-time. When it was all said and
done Bloomberg News reported February 22, 1999, that AgriBioTech had hired armed
guards to protect defendant Thomas at the AgriBioTech annual shareholders meeting.

The AgriBioTech Wipeout: The Beginning of an Interesting Pattern Emerges


If, one time, a group of people take people's money, claim they are building a business,
but instead investors are wiped out while insiders benefit, then that might be explainable
with bad luck or a mistake. Stuff happens. However, if the same people do this repeatedly
over and over again for decades, I believe most people would consider that something far
different and much worse.


I believe to understand AgriBioTech it is best you read the lawsuits and the very serious
issues alleged. I will quote the lawsuits regarding Thomas' previous M&A/rollup
AgriBioTech (NASDAQ:ABTX), then walk you through the subsequent wipeouts and then
we can see the similarities with BBLU to get a clearer picture of what is truly going on at
Blue Earth.


It seems to me that one of the first steps they took at ABTX was to hire the extremely
questionable paid stock promoter Liviakis Financial (a recent promoter of BBLU) and paid
2 MILLION options for an 18-month consulting agreement to "assist with investor
communications" (much more on Liviakis later).


A subsequent ABTX lawsuit (emphasis mine), alleged "fraud and deceit on purchasers of
AgriBioTech securities". The lawsuit further goes into detail about "accounting
manipulations" around revenue as AgriBioTech set "effective dates much earlier than the
closing dates of the acquisitions" and furthermore "defendants frequently touted the
rapidly increasing amount of the Company's "annualized net sales" but failed to disclose

that these reported annualized "net sales double-counted intercompany sales,"
apparently "in violation of 'GAAP' and SEC rules" and "resulted in the artificial inflation
of AgriBioTech's revenues" and therefore the stock price. This occurred while Thomas
was CEO of company.


Apparently, these accounting issues were strong enough to attract SEC attention and
resulted in an SEC investigation. This seems to have resulted in this concerning
discussion between investors and ABTX about "documents that say you defaulted on two
banks in Albuquerque" and a surprised shareholder "You mean the SEC is investigating
right now?"


Perhaps even more alarming, apparently in response to SEC inquiry:


1. "Gillespie stated that Ingalls said they had to show the SEC ABTX was managing the
acquired company. He asked her to write down the things she did at each acquired
entity to justify the Effective Date. When she was asked to document control, she told
Ingalls that ABT did not have control at all. Ingalls responded, 'Yeah, I know, and ABT
could lose them all.'"


2. Then "On June 11, 1998, ABT responded to the SEC's comments, and indicated ABT
obtained effective control of the acquired entities" - "She said you don't want them to
know we put together a bunch of letters to get profits up front."


3. And then most shocking: "Gillespie's statement that if ABT needed the truth
'flowered up' or stretched, she would do it (for the SEC comment process)."


4. In this legal document, we find another interesting quote about Thomas: "Gillespie
had discussions with others, including Thomas, where she said ABT did not have
control by the effective date. (Ex. 35 at 3.)"


5. "Defendant Thomas knew or with deliberate recklessness disregarded that
AgriBioTech's accounting practices and policies regarding acquisitions, as alleged
herein, artificially inflated reported revenues and earnings because he was involved
in the day-to-day operations of AgriBioTech and signed the Form 10-K for fiscal
1997."


6. "Thomas repeatedly reassured the investing public that AgriBioTech was aggressively
exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value and that these efforts
were 'on schedule' and would culminate in finding a buyer or substantial equity partner
for the Company by early February, 1999." And ABTX stated they had hired Merrill and
Deutsche Bank to run a process.


7. "With the stock trading around $10 in October, Thomas told The Wall Street Journal
that he could sell his company for $30 to $70 a share. Two weeks ago, AgriBioTech

said it had 'elected' to stay independent after, according to news reports, receiving no
bids." Oops.


8. With the stock in free fall Johnny Thomas blamed "lies placed on the Internet by short
sellers, with no basis in fact" and said that there would be no accounting or financial
restatements.


9. "[D]efendant Thomas wanted the market to believe that there was a realistic
opportunity to sell the Company… if the price continued to fall, defendant Thomas
would be subject to margin calls on the more than 900,000 shares (or almost half
of his holdings) of AgriBioTech which he had on margin." [Thomas did get a margin call
and was forced to sell all 900,000 shares].


Does that sound like honest management to you? Are these the kind of people you want
to financially partner with using your hard earned money? After reading this I think it is
obvious why Bloomberg reported AgriBioTech hired armed guards to protect CEO Johnny
R. Thomas at the shareholder meeting.


Ultimately, the SEC required ABTX to restate their financials and the whole thing began to
come unraveled. By March 1999, Johnny R. Thomas and John Francis had both been
replaced and then shortly after AgriBioTech went bankrupt. This bankruptcy is outlined in
Thomas' current biography.

I tried calling the lawyers involved with AgriBioTech as I was unable to pull the actual court
documents, I believe since the case is so old. So I cannot tell you in detail exactly how this
all ended for insiders and what kind of punishment or outcome they may or may not have
experienced. What I can tell you is that it seems to me the ending involved insiders paying
out a multi-million dollar settlement as "Other company directors, officers, employees and
consultants were also defendants in that litigation but have since settled for more than $18
million." I very strongly encourage you to read all the legal documents related to
AgriBioTech so you can learn how this happened and develop an informed view of who
you are investing with in BBLU.


Perhaps ABTX was a one-off event or just bad luck for Johnny Thomas and John
Francis?


If it happens once, it might be bad luck. If it happens twice, some call that a pattern, but
what do you call it if it happens repeatedly?


While AgriBioTech filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy January 2000, Johnny Thomas and
Francis were not wasting time and while their last company was still dealing with the
consequences of bankruptcy, Johnny Thomas and John Francis apparently teamed up for
some sort of Honduran resort slash spiritual wellness center with Hunapu Inc and the
attempted IPO of Crest View Inc. But perhaps unsurprisingly, this seems to me to have
failed also.


You'd think after that much failure in such a short period of time they'd maybe take a break
and reevaluate? Why Johnny Thomas and Francis' experience at ABTX or this failed
Crest View IPO qualifies them to give advice to anyone about business is just mind
boggling, but Johnny Thomas also appears to have become involved in "Falcon Financial
Group" literally the same month ABTX filed for bankruptcy in January 2000.


"Falcon is engaged in the business of providing assistance or advice to private
companies on capital formation and on becoming a publicly traded company and
introductions to investment banking firms"


It appears it's not just outside investors that get wiped out when Johnny Thomas is
involved. With Falcon Financial, it looks like Johnny Thomas owned so much (9.8% of
shares outstanding) of Wasatch Interactive stock at $6 per share that he had to file a 13D

with the SEC in April 2000. How did investors fare this time with Johnny Thomas?
Wasatch Interactive's stock price declined by -81.17% over the time frame below.

It appears Johnny Thomas and Falcon Financial were also involved with Winsonic Digital
Media Group. It is not clear exactly what time frame he was involved here, but as you can
see below the stock pretty much wiped investors out over basically any longer time frame
and has declined -99.86%.


(picture credit Capital IQ)


It didn't stop with his investments either, as it also appears Falcon Financial Group, LLC
"has suspended its operations " and is now inactive, so presumably it wasn't shut down
because it was such a resounding success.


But Wait! You Also Get...


Then Johnny Thomas was also an executive officer and director at Decision Link, inc
(formerly known as FiberChem) which was also a "blank check" company. It looks like
Decision Link was also a wipeout with the stock falling -99.8% and now listed as inactive
by Capital IQ.

THE MORE RECENT WIPEOUT WITH ABSURD $22 BILLION MANAGEMENT
"GUIDANCE" AT CNSV


After AgriBioTech failed and subsequent attempts all seem to have failed, Johnny Thomas
and Francis found themselves in another frothy bull market in 2007 and seem to me to
have decided to take another swing at it. Neither executive has any apparent background
in oil and gas or managing an organic farm, but that didn't stop them from launching
Consolidation Services, Inc., another Henderson Nevada shell company (formerly CNSV
before it failed and was renamed Mongolian Holdings).


Apparently, using the AgriBioTech playbook, Johnny Thomas and Francis quickly hired
another stock promoter to help them promote their stock: This time it was the infamous
Agoracom! (More on Agoracom later.)


This wayward company floundered, first claiming it would roll up the food distribution
industry, then aiming at organic farming, until eventually entering the energy industry by
acquiring oil wells. Hilariously, management claimed they would do all of these and that
modern coal and natural gas recovery techniques actually, synergistically "enhance
arability" of organic farmland (tastes like oil!).


The Company intends to make energy resource recovery and organic/natural
farming work synergistically, because modern recovery methods not only avoid
damage to the land but also enhance arability."


Does farming for organic produce on top of a coal mine or natural gas well even make any
sense to you at all? That seems like an obviously terrible idea to me.


In a familiar playbook by now, CNSV got started via reverse merger with Vector Energy,
bought from James Francis for $10. Johnny Thomas then hired his wife and began
acquiring assets primarily in stock. Then management came out with their familiar stories

about some amazing (!!!) potential opportunity, like this press release from John C. Francis
at CNSV trying to tell investors that someone had just sold them a coal property for $1
million that they "guided" investors to expect $30-40 million in royalty revenue.


Next the company hired Agoracom, a firm that allegedly used "fraudulent postings" with
more than 670 fake aliases created by Agoracom representatives posting more than
24,000 alias posts on client message boards. In exchange for this, Agoracom offered
pricing models for its clients which incorporated a monthly fee and stock options equaling
the greater of 250,000 shares, or 0.5% of the company's fully diluted outstanding share
total at current prices.


Quoting from a lawsuit in which Agracom directors received fines and bans:


"Tsiolis and Kondakos required their representatives, as part of their daily
responsibilities, to post anonymously to the client forums using aliases. To post
messages anonymously, the representatives created fictitious usernames and
posed as investors blending in with other users, investors and interested persons.
Representatives had between 40-50 aliases (some had up to 200) and were
required to make a requisite number of posts per hub per day or risk having
their pay docked. On occasion, Agoracom staff conversed with themselves on the
forums using different aliases."


This is really bad stuff, and in my opinion, no legitimate management team would ever hire
such a stock promoter. However, in my opinion, the Agoracom promotion pales in
comparison to Thomas' own promotional statements. I strongly encourage you to listen to
this interview he gave as CEO for Consolidation Services, Inc. (formerly CNSV) to
"Emerging Issuer". It is a real gem.

(Chart by me using quotes from Emerging Issuer interview)


By the way, this interviewer, Emerging Issuer, was a paid stock promotion company that
Johnny Thomas and James Francis at CNSV paid $20K for a 3-month program.


Despite having "$22 BILLION of coal" (oh wow!!) and Johnny Thomas guidance of $2-4
million in 2009 revenue, the CNSV 10-K literally shows $0 in revenue for both 2008 &
2009. Johnny Thomas seems to have missed his own guidance he fed investors by
-100%.

According to this Yahoo Finance stock price chart, CNSV declined from ~$9 per share
ultimately to $0.08, losing -99.11% of its value, essentially wiping investors out before
changing its name to Mongolia Holdings Inc.

Johnny Thomas and John Francis seem to have stepped down from management roles in
2010, but retained involvement "to use their extensive acquisition experience to further the
CNSV goal of increasing shareholder value through acquisitions."


From 2010, CNSV fell another -98% so apparently this is just about in line with Johnny
Thomas and John Francis's "acquisition experience" for shareholders.

BBLU's QUESTIONABLE PARTNERSHIPS WITH PAID STOCK PROMOTERS


I personally believe no investor should ever invest in any company that is hiring paid stock
promoters because it speaks to the highly speculative nature and low quality of the
company. In my opinion, "real" companies run by honest management don't do this. There
are 60K+ public companies globally and you simply don't have to take the total wipeout
risk paid stock promotion usually entails. I recommend if you come across something like
this, just "pass" and find something else to speculate or invest in.


In my opinion, BBLU hired a collection of the worst stock promoters available for hire on
Wall Street. Why would they partner with people like this? BBLU has partnered with
Liviakis Financial, RedChip, First Equity Group's SmallCapStockPlays, SmallCapNetwork
and now is associated with SeeThruEquity as well.


Who is John Liviakis?

Nice Looking Jet, John

Who is the mystery man behind promoting BBLU stock? Let's investigate, going all the
way back to his humble beginnings in 1985 as a stock broker who was sued for allegedly
wiping out the entire life savings of a family in Sacramento, CA, and ended up settling.


Silicon Investor's website contains a copy of a media piece covering Liviakis called Tale of
Tout I recommend reading as a balanced look at Liviakis. In fact, Liviakis' very first client
was Cascade International, a stock that went down in flames with criminal charges and
fraud allegations, creating brutal financial losses for shareholders. I strongly encourage
you to go to the Liviakis site and watch these absolutely hilarious Liviakis Financial
"promo" videos.


Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incidence for Liviakis. One of his next "greatest
hits" was a public company called Projectavision, the CEO of which liked to describe the
company as "The most conservative of Liviakis's companies." Projectavision later
changed its name to Vidikron and went bankrupt, resulting in a disaster for shareholders.

Quoting the Tale of Tout article:


"Other stocks that Liviakis promoted never met his high expectations. Among them
were Airship International Ltd., a Florida blimp operator; Holmes Microsystems, a
Utah modem maker; Quadrax Corp., a Rhode Island manufacturer of lightweight
extra-strength materials for a variety of uses from aerospace to bicycle production;
and Big Sky USA Inc. (now known as Organik Technologies, Inc.), a Washington
State clothing manufacturer that had developed a system for nonshrinking cotton
without using harmful chemicals."


All of these stocks ultimately went bankrupt, ceased to trade or were just financial
disasters for shareholders:

Webb stock now trades for a fraction of one penny.

Just how many wipeouts has Liviakis been involved with? It's hard to say, the companies
above are just a small fraction of the total he has been involved with. Due to Capital IQ
data limitations (doesn't go back into the 1980s), as well as the sheer volume of
questionable microcaps Liviakis has promoted, it is difficult to fully track out his handiwork
- I simply got overwhelmed. I believe it would most likely take an entire branch division of
the SEC months if not years with a large team to fully untangle the entire Liviakis web.
Nevertheless, it's clear for anyone to see that a startling amount of Liviakis' stocks have
resulted in large shareholder losses over the years.


Don't bet against Dan Loeb, that is not a good bet for you


I am not the first person to write about John Liviakis. According to the book Hedge
Hunters, Dan Loeb used to specifically target Liviakis stocks to short:


"Many of Loeb's short ideas came from a promoter named John Liviakis. 'We used
to go through his [Liviakis'] client list because it was a particularly fruitful universe of
attractive short candidates,' he says."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2578955-blue-earth-strong-sell-on-law-enforcement-investigation-fraud-allegations-and-paid-stock-promotion 20/60


Quoting the relevant portions from a recent Vanity Fair Article discussing Loeb's short
selling efforts against Liviakis:


"That same year, 1999, Loeb got into more legal trouble, this time with John Liviakis,
a San Francisco public-relations executive, who also sued Loeb for libel. Using a
pseudonym, allegedly Loeb had written an imaginary monologue, supposedly in
Liviakis's voice: I have registered 1.7 million shares to sell and these will soon flood
the market. Hopefully I will sell these before the company loses its Nasdaq listing…
Then I will laugh at you fools for buying my shares and I will celebrate with a bottle of
grappa, some fresh feta, and a nice young boy-just like in the old country."


In this Dealbreaker article, we see that Dan Loeb allegedly posted under the Yahoo
Finance message board pseudonym "John Crimiakis StockSwindler".


These alleged comments resulted in a libel lawsuit against Loeb that was settled. Based
on the above, I think it's clear that Liviakis is not Dan Loeb's favorite person and Dan Loeb
thinks shorting Liviakis' stock promotions is a profitable endeavor. The charts above seem
to support this view as well I believe.


I don't have to remind readers that Dan Loeb runs Third Point Management, one of the
most successful and best hedge funds on the planet with over $10 billion in assets built off
a ridiculously good long-term track record. My advice is don't bet against Dan Loeb.


Citron Has Also Dominated Liviakis Multiple Times in Print


Liviakis has also been a long-time Citron favorite, here and here. There's something
particularly offensive to me about a stock promoter willing to promote BioPulse, a Tijuana-
based cancer clinic that utilized the amazing medicinal healing powers of urine, and was
ultimately raided and shut down by the Mexican health authorities.


BBLU = MORE Paid Stock Promoters


While it is nearly impossible to get worse than Liviakis, in my opinion, BBLU is making a
good effort. BBLU also retained RedChip, and paid them a monthly cash fee plus 50K
shares for stock promotion and comically bad interviews like this one discussing BBLU's
energy efficiency debacle before it happened (explained below).


RedChip is known for promoting multiple Chinese reverse mergers that later
essentially wiped investors out. This is common knowledge to anyone with Internet, so
why would BBLU do this?

Unfortunately, BBLU also hired First Equity Group with such newsletters as "Penny Stock
Warrior". First Equity group was paid 80K in BBLU shares for a paid stock promotion
campaign.


How do First Equity Group stock promotions turn out? Perhaps there is another pattern we
can see that will help us predict where BBLU is going?


We can see a list of penny stock and microcap companies that have paid First Equity for
stock promotion here. First Equity Group appears to have covered "Vision Industries Corp"
(VIIC) which saw its stock spike up, then tried to increase shares outstanding from 500
million to 10 BILLION before going bankrupt a few months later.


Or CDII which appears to have given First Equity Group 1 million shares but after a brief
stock price pop, CDII stock appears to have wiped out investors, losing most of its value.
Over the past 5 years, CDII stock has declined -96% and now carries a mere $3.6 million
market cap.


Or PSID, which has a very suspicious looking stock price chart. PSID paid First Equity
Group what looks to me like well over 1 million shares and PSID promoted their stock.


Small Cap Stock Plays also seems to have allegedly performed a paid email stock
promotion campaign on BBLU as well. I could go on and outline all the wipeouts all these
stock promotion firms have been associated with, but honestly this is just overwhelming
and not necessary at this point.


What kind of company partners with people like this?

"We're getting the band back together… we're on a mission from God." - The Blues
Brothers


(picture credit: Blues Brothers)


It seems Johnny Thomas and Francis have a keen eye for a frothy "anything goes" bull
markets and so despite an overwhelming amount of failure in their past, it seems to me
they decided to "get the band back together" and have another go.


Now just 5.5 miles down the road from the ABTX HQ, and 4.9 miles away from the latest
failure CNSV, Johnny Thomas seems to have "gotten the band back together" for another
run with a disparate group of random companies acquired primarily for stock based on a
high stock price, with paid stock promoters, with the additional goal of now piling on a
large amount of debt. As a reminder, it was leverage combined with lack of profits that
ultimately drove ABTX into bankruptcy.


Blue Earth Has an Even Worse Acquisition Record than ABTX (so awful)


First let us run through the numbers of BBLU and have a high level look before showing
that the current story of CHP is completely unviable, and that BBLU is likely worthless as it
gets closer and closer to the eventual bankruptcy and wipeout I expect.


While ABTX was a value destroying rollup that resulted in large shareholder losses, the
most shocking part to me is that ABTX was vastly superior to BBLU on the numbers:
ABTX had an incremental return (EBIT, or operating income) on incremental assets of -4%
(bad), while BBLU has generated a -28% on the same ratio (horrific capital destruction - it

would be faster to just light the money on fire). Another way of saying this is the more
acquisitions BBLU makes (or ABTX made), the more money they lose, creating a vicious
cycle of capital destruction. Since both companies rely on a high stock price, they can use
the stock as currency to make acquisitions (note the massive share dilution in the chart
below), I believe it is clear that this can only end one way - huge shareholder dilution and
eventual crushing losses leading to bankruptcy.


(picture credit: charts built by me with public information)


I believe this is why BBLU has been a "dilution machine" with shares outstanding
increasing by ~600% since 2010 with revenue going up by 1/3 of that and losses with
cash burn actually accelerating. Note that when Johnny Thomas talks about BBLU
revenue or guidance, he doesn't measure it in a "per share" metric that current
stockholders should be focused on.


BBLU Dilution

This stock promotion has temporarily added buying demand to the stock despite the story
falling apart. As you can see below, the market capitalization and BBLU valuation, while
now breaking down, is still near all-time highs.

According to Capital IQ data, Liviakis originally became a shareholder in late 2009. The
first time Liviakis' name shows up in BBLU's SEC filings is 11/5/2009 in an 8-K when
BBLU disclosed that Liviakis and his representatives were granted 1,384,000 shares of
stock for an 18-month investor relations consulting agreement with BBLU through May,
2011 - this represented more than 7% of BBLU shares outstanding at the time.
Interestingly, the 8-K lists the company's name as Genesis Fluid Solutions Holdings,
indicating to me that BBLU management planned a stock promotion before Blue Earth
even existed in its current form - obviously the recurring Johnny Thomas playbook was

well planned out in advance. Then this 13D filing showed Liviakis owned nearly 10% of
BBLU stock at one point. We now know that Liviakis owns only 3.7% according to his
latest 13G filing, a far cry from the 10% he once owned.


John Liviakis was also a large shareholder of ABTX and liquidated his entire position
before the company went bankrupt. The original ABTX Liviakis 13D filing is dated May 6th,
1996, in which Liviakis disclosed that he owned 1,125,000 shares of ABTX stock. In
another 13D filed on May 6th, 1997, Liviakis reported that he owned zero shares,
indicating he liquidated his entire position.


I am not suggesting that Liviakis in any way influenced the bankruptcy of ABTX or likely
bankruptcy of BBLU, rather that his job is to increase the stock price.


Make no mistake though, this service has been extremely profitable for Liviakis. In one
interview, Liviakis apparently bragged that he makes as much as $40,000 an hour. Based
on the long running history of investor wipeouts, I suspect most people who buy into
Liviakis promoted stocks do much, much worse than that (probably negative dollars per
hour).


BBLU ALREADY FAILING: Castrovilla & Xynergy


"Watch What We Do, Not What We Say."


-Nixon Attorney General, John Mitchell


Once at BBLU, Johnny Thomas and John Francis wasted no time and began acquiring
companies in 2011 largely with stock, while immediately offering extremely promotional
guidance to investors of huge potential numbers. In 2011, Johnny Thomas stated his
guidance to investors of "$100m next year of revenues" with positive EBITDA of ">$10m"
while "comfortable" with these forecasts. Actual revenue in 2012 for BBLU was barely
$9.96 million (or -90.04% below guidance) with a -$9.6 million loss. Are you seeing a
pattern yet? How long can this continue?


The first was a company they bought that became "Castrovilla" on 1/1/2011 for the
whopping price of $1.7 million paid mostly in stock (purchased for a valuation of about
0.5x revenue). This company seems to have historically had a large refrigeration gasket
business, but the "story" Johnny Thomas put forth was for them to sell energy efficiency
retrofits. Thomas guided to projected $30-60 million of revenues (up from ~$3.5 million)
with the "eecoaStation" opportunity as they do 250 stores per quarter in a >$3.5 billion
"potential" market.

Then on 10/5/2011 BBLU signed a financing agreement with Gexpro of Shelton, CT and
G&N Holdings LLC,, but this was terminated on 2/14/2012 (valentines day fail). So it does
not seem to me BBLU was able to provide growth capital to help the people who sold this
business.


At least one investor seems to have viewed this as "charging $30k to change the
lightbulbs" though and the Castrovilla story seems to have come unwound just as quickly
as it was promoted.


Johnny Thomas "Guidance" for $30-60 million In 2012 Castrovilla Revenue: Actual
Was $3.44 million…


(picture credit Blue Earth, apologies for poor picture quality, but curiously I was unable to
find this slide deck anywhere on BBLU's website. But only in this archived low-res
RedChip interview)


Shockingly, Johnny Thomas' guidance seems to have again turned out to be wildly
incorrect. Actual REAL revenue from Castrovilla in 2012 was just $3.44 million which is
-94.1% less than guidance. Most shockingly, this is actually a DECLINE of -11% yoy vs.
2011. Missing the "expectations" given to investors, who bought and valued the stock
based on that, by -94.1%.

It doesn't stop there though: Xnergy also an "epic fail".


Xnergy was acquired 10/2011 for ~$15 million mostly in stock (again, valued at ~0.5x
forecasted revenue) with the promise of a $500 million + "project pipeline" with "guidance"
for Xnergy revenues to double from 2010 to a 2012 level of $36 million. Johnny Thomas
went on further to guide investors to a $579 million pipeline that could generate a $15
million total net income. Actual REAL revenue for Xnergy, however, was just $6.5 million in
2012, which I estimated is -76% below "guidance" Johhny Thomas gave out. Even more
alarming for companies considering selling to BBLU, Xnergy 2012 revenue was actually
down tremendously from Xnergy's revenue before BBLU acquired them of $18.9 million in
2010. It also appears that the Xnergy insiders did not receive their earn-out bonuses.

I find this Xnergy debacle particularly offensive. Xnergy was quoted as having worked on
in some way on "nearly 100mw of traditional and alternative energy systems" as of 2013.
However, you can see from the company's own news releases published going back to
2005 that the company has been in operations for over 8 years so that's an average of
only 12.5mw per year. Yet Thomas's guidance to investors seems to have been for a
579mw pipeline of projects to come soon? Even if BBLU had executed on 100% of this
pipeline for 5 years that would be more than 10x the mw volume that Xnergy had done
historically. Does that sound like an honest expectation to you?


Furthermore, Xnergy has been doing work for big companies like LG since 2004.
However, claiming Xnergy has a "partnership" with LG is similar to some landscaper
claiming he has a "partnership" with Goldman Sachs simply because he does their yard
work. Obviously that is absurd.

Most comically, Johnny Thomas has been guiding investors to expect positive EBITDA for
quite some time now too. Here is another BBLU investor presentation I was surprised is
not displayed on BBLU's website. Johnny Thomas was "forecasting" revenue of $100
million with >$10 million in EBITDA in 2012. We can see the past revenue in 2010 and
2009 of Xnergy and Castrovilla before Johnny Thomas got his hands on them. Revenue
then seems to have done quite badly in 2011 and we can see more amazing Johnny
Thomas "guidance" for 2012. Does this "guidance" told to investors seem credible and
honest to you? Are we to think Johnny Thomas truly believed he was going to go from
~$10 million in 2011 total revenue straight to $100 million in one year with two companies
he had just bought?


You may be just flabbergasted to hear this, but BBLU had ACTUAL 2012 total revenue of
just $9.9 million and instead of generating positive EBITDA, BBLU actually had a net
LOSS of -$9.6 million for 2012. This followed a -$14.01 million net LOSS in 2011.

Do you think it is interesting that BBLU does not host these presentations or webcasts on
their website? Is the Company deliberately making an effort to shirk accountability of prior
guidance? And where are the past earnings call or investor presentation recordings
typically offered to investors by most companies? And why does the "press releases" page
on BBLU's website only go back to early 2014? How are retail investors supposed to be
able to do their due diligence? I have never seen a publicly traded company offer so little
historic information to their shareholders before and I find it troubling.


Johnny Thomas "Guidance" at BBLU So Far: Do You Notice a Pattern?


Johnny Thomas also seems to be referring "AgriBioTech" as his and James Francis's
"most successful project" (LOL At 3:30 mark) but curiously doesn't mention the name of
the company or the rest of the story of what happened there? Does that seem honest to
you?


IT GETS WORSE: BBLU'S CURRENT "STORY" WITH TOTAL LOSS RISK, TOTALLY
UNVIABLE WITH CONFUSING STORY CONTRADICTIONS


Now with two "epic fails" behind them already at BBLU, Johnny Thomas and BBLU
wasted no time moving on to the next story. BBLU is now touting two new "businesses"
recently acquired, but unfortunately for BBLU shareholders, serious cracks are already
appearing in both of these businesses as the risk of "total loss" is becoming clear.


BBLU BATTERY BUSINESS: OBVIOUSLY UNVIABLE AND LIKELY WORTHLESS

With the past two failures still fresh, BBLU moved onto expanding into the battery
business by acquiring two business interests primarily in stock, with Millennium Power
Solutions for $14.5 million and then a $10 million equity investment in PowerGenix.
Curiously, it appears no information on what percent of PowerGenix was bought for this
$10 million though? As a result, BBLU shareholders have literally no idea how attractive
this investment is. Did BBLU wildly overpay? We just don't know but given the track record
of people involved with BBLU, I'd say odds are likely this is going to end up worthless.


In case you missed it, it appears that PowerGenix seems to have already tried to enter
this traffic signal battery market as far back as 2011, apparently failing. Considering they
just sold the opportunity to BBLU I would assume that this was not a resounding success?
What happened last time PowerGenix attempted this? Why was no discussion of this
disclosed in BBLU's investor presentations? Have you called and spoken with the last
company PowerGenix partnered with in this space to see what happened? Here is their
website and phone number.


The "story" being fed to investors now is that there is a $500 million (WOW!) in the traffic
$2.4 billion (!) battery backup market for BBLU. I think both of these points seem obviously
mistaken, confused and the battery "opportunity" for BBLU is so obviously unviable I
question why BBLU management is even wasting their time and shareholder money on
this.


Let me explain:


First, I believe the size of the market "opportunity" BBLU presents appears misleading to
me and is not even close to accurate. BBLU seems to quote different numbers in different
presentations too. In the slide below, BBLU states there are 400k traffic intersections in
the US for their market and their opportunity is $6k per intersection.

However, in this presentation, BBLU seems to "shift" that number and is claiming there are
313k intersections in their addressable market? Even if you add the Canadian intersection
estimates I believe you still don't get even close to 400k intersections quoted above so not
sure what is going on here?

The $500 million+ market potential number BBLU throws around here is without credibility
and misleading as well. It's not exactly clear where BBLU gets that $504 million number
from, but best I can tell it seems to have been fabricated using the 313k intersection
number from BBLU's slide above multiplied by a price point of $1,450 for the batteries. I'd
like to state that if BBLU's traffic signal batteries indeed have a $1,450 price point they are
in serious trouble as this document from 2009 states their signals had $832 battery cost
per signal and that is using retail price to end user and not wholesale price that BBLU
would be expected to receive. This document states the batteries are only $185 each, and
if you search around you can find them even cheaper.

Furthermore, the battery content of a traffic intersection is only a tiny component of the $5-
6k it costs to install a battery backup system anyway. In that context, how does that
"Canada Market Potential" Section make sense? Does BBLU even have a current
construction presence in Canada anyway?


This is absurd though for multiple reasons. First of all, no city or area is going to battery
backup every signal because these are not free and a cost-benefit analysis must be done.
We can see this from countless city generated analysis like this, or this. This takes 1
minute with Google to prove for yourself so I question why BBLU management presents it
this way.


Further impairing this market analysis, per this CA state report battery backup systems
seem to only be possible when used on signals that have been upgraded to LED lights.
While this is increasing in prevalence, not every single traffic intersection in the US has
LED lights or ever will have.


Also, battery backing up traffic signals in the US has been going on for decades. Any
signal already done has a battery cabinet, making some battery alternative that is more
expensive than current lead acid batteries but replaces the cabinet simply not useful. As

far back as 2012, Baltimore had already done 10% of its intersections and was working on
more. Remember, backing up every single intersection is never going to happen, so if
10% of the total has been done, I estimate this is more like 30-40% of the total
addressable signals. Even more obvious, why would any city design their battery backup
systems so they could only use one company's batteries? They could then be hostage to
that company for price increases and hassle. I think it's obvious this doesn't make sense.


The currently offered batteries work just fine anyway and are extremely cheap. For cash
strapped municipalities, saving money is always crucial. Per this document, they last 7-8
years and only cost $185 each. I don't see how PowerGenix could ever compete with this
price point and I would imagine lead/acid batteries have come down in price further since
2009. Also, the batteries are typically required by the municipality to have tool free
maintenance so the current battery options are not difficult to work with apparently. Plus,
the company that did the install and the manufacturer will get battery replacement sales in
my view anyway as they already have the relationship and the trust with the people
involved. Furthermore, any new vendor would typically have to go through a process or
their product put out to competitive bid again.


Not ever traffic signal backup will even be done with batteries anyway. This NYC report
shows they are exploring solar backup, fuel cell, generator and other options. To ever
think that batteries will get 100% of this market seems absurd.


Third, these systems come with warranties and the batteries last a long time. See this on
page TP-13 to see the batteries have 5-year unconditional warranties with full
replacement. So if there is a battery issue it is not the municipalities' issue. It is the
installer or manufacturer that has to fix that. I would have to imagine that installing some
battery with unclear long-term reliability could void a battery backup signal equipment
warranty as well. If this is true, why would any municipality take this risk?


Fourth, and most importantly, the last company to partner with PowerGenix now appears
to have moved back to Lead Acid batteries. This is the company PowerGenix partnered
with previously in the traffic intersection space. Here is the data sheet on this company's
currently listed product. As you can see under "Electrical", this system now uses a "sealed
AGM" 65 amp batter setup. AGM batteries are lead acid. Here is the data sheet from the
other currently listed traffic signal battery backup system offered by this company as well.
As you can see on the second page on the upper left, AGM batteries are also listed as
what is offered.

Furthermore, in the information sheet we can see "these batteries can be supplied to be
installed within the traffic cabinets or in a separate battery pack enclosure." So there
are already traffic signal battery backup systems that include the batteries in the cabinet.


The data center story BBLU management touts is a joke too. Do you really think BBLU,
which doesn't even state any R&D on its income statement (literally zero spent on lifetime
R&D?), is going to take a tiny license for a technology they don't even own and out
compete GE or any of the other huge global leaders that have been dominating this space
for decades? If I need to get into this in further depth in the future I can do that but I think
you are hopefully starting to understand what is going on here.


I could keep going but I will stop here. Based on the above, this whole thing seems like
such an obviously bad idea I question what management and Johnny Thomas are
honestly doing here.


BBLU CHP "STORY": Unviable with "total wipeout" risk unappreciated


BBLU appears to have been attempting the CHP business with Xnergy since 2011, but
redoubled their efforts when they acquired (primarily with stock) "IPS Power Engineering".
IPS was bought for stock valued at $18.34 million with ~2/3 of that highly restricted and
not available to the buyers yet. BBLU immediately came out touting a headline of "over
$750 million of recurring revenue"! (Does this sound familiar yet? I wonder how this will
turn out?)


The foundation for BBLU's current CHP story, seems to have been brought to BBLU by a
"Robert Nickolas Jones" who was given 50k shares of BBLU stock as a finder's fee.
Assuming this is the same "Robert Nickolas Jones" from Utah, then this individual also
appears to have been connected to the questionable "Fonu2 Inc." blow up which seems to
have had a rally only to collapse. Fonu2 stock now trades for $0.0013 per share and has a
$143k market cap.

A "Robert Nickolas Jones" seems to have also been to CFO of Bnet Media Group, which
announced a delayed 10-Q filing, executive resignations after their auditor expressed
doubt the company can continue as a going concern. Does this sound like someone you
should be taking business input from?


Ignoring this, given the large retail shareholder base I do not believe investors have "done
the homework" on this CHP theoretical story and understand that this "CHP story" seems
likely to me to ultimately be the downfall of BBLU due to the extreme leverage BBLU is
attempting.


BBLU has no discernible sustainable competitive advantage I can find in this sector as
they hire outside EPC firms and use off the shelf parts available to anyone. So
unsurprisingly, as in all extremely competitive and crowded industries and even using
BBLU's wildly optimistic profit guidance, I estimate these CHP projects are incapable of
covering BBLU current cash burn issues and the enormous net income earnings investors
seem to be expecting will not occur.


To claim BBLU is like Solar city is absurd too, there are literally hundreds of companies in
the US doing CHP projects and have been for many decades. BBLU competes in a
commodity CHP business where, unlike Solar City, CHP projects also have volatile
commodity inputs costs and so the two are not even close to comparable. BBLU has no
competitive advantage in this space and in fact, the wipeout history of people involved is a
strong competitive disadvantage as I cannot imagine that helps them get capital when
they go to banks and compete against credible CHP contractors run by people without
multi-decade history of creating investment losses.


What exactly is BBLU's value add here exactly? They hire someone else to build
something using off the shelf componentry and a group of people with connections to
countless wipeouts is supposed to be the people who will raise the money? Pardon me if I
don't sound surprised that people aren't lining up to give these people money. One quick
Google of the CEO's name turns up a bankruptcy with fraud allegations along with a string
of wipeouts. I personally would not give these people a dime, let alone put them in charge
of managing a power plant. I find the whole thing both scary and absurd.


Any business that is (attempting) to generate returns on projects that are greater than the
cost of their capital is, by definition, unviable.


Unfortunately for BBLU, the CHP business is a business where scale matters too. The
business is extremely competitive. If you don't' believe me, then verify for yourself. Look at
this EPA website which lists the EPA's "partners" involved in CHP.

There are a full 475 companies listed just on this website and I am sure this website is far
from encompassing the industry. Even worse for BBLU there are 147 "CHP project
developers" listed here. That is a lot of competition from companies dedicated solely on
this niche with many years of experience. As a result of the intense competition here, this
is a business where your cost of capital and scale are vital. Most of these projects are
generating a "teens" return. For a tiny unprofitable company like BBLU, I estimate their
cost of debt alone is 8-12%+ (if they can even get it) and cost of equity is much higher.
Even wildly optimistic conference provider SeeThruEquity seems to estimate BBLU cost of
capital at 13%. I don't see how BBLU possibly is generating a return higher than their cost
of capital, and that is the definition of an unviable business in my view. If you add
tremendous debt leverage to a situation like that, rapid bankruptcy can occur.


As we can see below, since this is an incredibly competitive space occupied by huge
global companies, the returns on these CHP projects are not attractive.

BBLU hopes to compete against some credible and established companies. For instance,
global EPC juggernaut SNC Lavalin Constructors inc has over 70 years of specialized
experience in gas cogeneration plants. CAT is already focused on cogen in food
processing in Canada and the US (as well as globally) and has been for many years.
BBLU does not even appear as a top 600 specialty contractor yet competes against
vertically integrated giant companies like Gem Energy, which had $168 million in revenue
back in 2011. If you can choose between legendary global businesses with the smartest
employees on the planet like Caterpillar to do your CHP plant or a team of people with
decades of failure and a wake of financial disaster in their path, which would you choose?


Furthermore, people will fight these CHP projects the same way they fight any new power
plant being built in their backyard.


If you are a BBLU shareholder, I encourage you to pose the question:


"In 2 years, Blue Earth will grow from an unprofitable $10m in sales, to generating
$100m+ of revenue from CHP with extremely high profit margins despite having no
proprietary technology when competing against hundreds of other companies because…"


Then call any CHP project developer on this EPA list (where phone numbers are clearly
listed) and ask them to fill in the blank.


JBS: Already in the CHP/Cogen Business

It is not even clear the terms or if there is any exclusivity with JBS anyway. This JBS
document states JBS is in the cogeneration business and this doc covers 2010-2011.
Furthermore, it is not unusual to see customers operate their own CHP facilities like this
ADM CHP cogeneration plant in Decatur, IL. Assuming they want to and end up building

these CHP plants, what is stopping JBS from using multiple contractors or financiers to
build their plants? What is stopping them from operating them on their own or hiring
someone more credible outside company to do that for them? Any terms of BBLU's long-
term involvement, even if you believe Johnny Thomas, is not clear.


More "Johnny Thomas Guidance": CHP Projects Already Being Pushed out


Johnny Thomas guiding for CHP project to commence operation during Q3 2014 but now
end of September has come and gone and no announcement of that plant in operation.
Plus he initially guided investors to "turning on" 3-4 power plants before the end of 2014
and that seems clearly not possible given not one of them is turned on yet. As the CHP
business for BBLU seems to get pushed out further and further without widescale
financing locked in, the risks here increase that investors grow concerned and the whole
thing comes unraveled.


CHP Business Faces Future Uncertainty From Utility: Unrecognized Risk of Total
Loss


This past legal dispute involving JBS, IPS Engineering (BBLU's acquired CHP company)
and FERC (regulator of energy/power plants in the US) could threaten any JBS
cogen/CHP project in the US. I advise you to read that right now (emphasis below mine)
but I will attempt to explain how I see this situation because this has ENORMOUS
potential implications for BBLU's CHP Business:


"the partners (JBS) say the plant won't be feasible without a contract to sell at
least 10 years of its excess energy and capacity to PPL."


I read this legal dispute to mean the current regulations require utilities to purchase
excess power if a plant is 20mw or smaller. The utilities currently have a pathway to
challenge this to avoid taking on these PPLs. The risk however is that the wording of the
current regulations essentially mean the utilities cannot prove the small plant has "non-
discriminatory access" until it is already built and the utility is then already forced to buy
the extra electricity. This seems like an obviously circular argument that makes little sense.
The FERC commissioner agrees too, as they state:


"PPL could not make that showing, the commission acknowledged, because the
Souderton QF has not begun operation. And that, said Commissioners Philip
Moeller and Tony Clark, is a problem"

I do not think it is an accident that BBLU is focusing on cogen projects 20mw or smaller.
However, this loophole where the utility is currently "forced" to buy the electricity seems to
me to be a clearly unsustainable model already in the process of being addressed. Why
should utilities be forced to buy electricity from small plants without any ability to protest at
rates that don't reimburse them for the infrastructure they built? This whole thing seems
quite unsustainable to me and this 20mw "loophole" threshold at which power plants can
be build and then force utilities to buy the power without protest makes little sense in my
view.


This is obviously a serious legal dispute between JBS, IPS Power Engineering (BBLU's
subsidiary) FERC, and the utility whose power purchases seem to be what makes the
project viable. IPS engineering also claims the local utility PPL Electric "has denied
interconnections" so why was this not disclosed to shareholders in investor presentations
so retail investors can understand this risk?


I think if BBLU thinks they can scale into a real power plant operator selling electricity into
the markets as if they were a utility without crushing their own business they may be in for
a bad surprise. Their very goal of becoming a power plant operator in scale while trying to
come in below this 20mw threshold where they can force the utility to buy the power
without contest seems absurd to me. Utilities are already fighting this on a project-by-
project basis and BBLU hasn't even gotten one JBS plant running in the US yet.


The entire concept of distributed generation poses great risk to the utilities as well. The
risks here and the many moving parts are beyond the scope of this report but I'd
encourage you to look into it more yourself here, here, here, here and here. While the
risks to the CHP industry are widespread, suffice to say there is a very real risk the utilities
step in here and impair or shakeup the entire industry. Where BBLU will land if this
happens is anyone's guess but I am assuming they will not come out well from that, and
likely even worse if they carry enormous levels of debt.


I'm as much a fan of local energy production and renewable energy as anyone but at
some point the utilities will need to get paid for providing, operating and maintaining the
infrastructure or the whole thing is not sustainable. Couple this with extreme proposed
debt levels and there is very real risk of "total wipeout" to investors if this goes against
BBLU.


Could this 20mw project loophole risk be why Xnergy never panned out according to the
huge expectations Johnny Thomas fed investors?

PLANS TO ADD BIG LEVERAGE SOUNDS LIKE ABT AND LOOK LIKE THE ROAD
TO ANOTHER BANKRUPTCY


Have you sat down and modeled out what BBLU's net income per share will look like with
these projects? I get the impression nobody has sat down with a sharp pencil and figured
this out so let me provide some fair and balanced insight on this.


(picture credit Blue Earth)


BBLU is guiding investors that they plan to build 7 plants in the near term, which will
require layering $119 million on this tiny and unprofitable company. First I do not believe
banks will finance $130 million of these with just $11 million of BBLU equity (more dilution)
as that would leave these projects with an astounding 91.5% debt to equity. Furthermore,
even using what seem like extremely optimistic assumptions from management of $1.9
million EBITDA per project, that would leave project debt/EBITDA at an unbelievably high
8.95x. I really doubt any bank will finance anything with these people involved at those
types of extreme leverage and even if they do this creates an extremely leveraged
balance sheet at BBLU.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2578955-blue-earth-strong-sell-on-law-enforcement-investigation-fraud-allegations-and-paid-stock-promotion 43/60


Given the multi decade track record of failure and bankruptcy I find BBLU's guidance of
adding significant debt to their business model to be particularly alarming and I believe will
likely accelerate the eventual shareholder wipeout or bankruptcy.


EVEN IF BBLU CAN GET THESE DONE (DOUBT IT) IT APPEARS THEY WON'T EVEN
MAKE BIG PROFITS FROM THEM


Even if they get many of these CHP projects done, they are only supposed to generate
$1.9 million in EBITDA each and with BBLU's -$28 million in 2013 net losses I don't see
how these will stem the losses and create a profitable company. Furthermore, assuming
BBLU can borrow debt at 5.5% interest rates (this seems unrealistically low but we'll be
generous here) I estimate that would mean interest expense per project alone would be
>$1.0 million also. So after paying the debt off, each CHP project would only leave BBLU
an estimated ~$900k in earnings and that is before tax and before accounting for the very
real expense of depreciation (equipment wearing out) in this capital intensive business.
This is all probably not even worth discussing though because given their multi-decade
track record of failure and lack of ability to provide financing I doubt they will be able to get
these done.


So even if everything goes right exactly according to BBLU management guidance and
even if you choose to ignore the "total loss" risk of the 20mw project loophole that could
get changed any day, these CHP projects still don't' provide an exciting return to BBLU
shareholders.


I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT BBLU ACCOUNTING INTEGRITY, AUDITORS
ARE SKETCHY


Getting back to ABTX for a minute, we can see a very questionable auditor situation here
for a company later facing accounting manipulations allegations and lawsuits:


"Defendant Henry A. Ingalls ("Ingalls") was Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial
Officer and Treasurer of the Company until he was replaced on November 2, 1998, and
thereafter became Vice President of Capital Formation, Mergers and Acquisitions. Ingalls
joined AgriBioTech effective April 1, 1996 after more than 25 years in the Albuquerque
office of KPMG Peat Marwick ("KPMG"). Prior to his departure from KPMG, Ingalls was
the head of the audit department of the Albuquerque office and thus was
responsible for the AgriBioTech audits. Pursuant to his employment agreement
entered into on February 13, 1996, defendant Ingalls received options to purchase up to
1,250,000 shares of AgriBioTech common stock, exercisable at $2.12 per share vesting
over five years."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2578955-blue-earth-strong-sell-on-law-enforcement-investigation-fraud-allegations-and-paid-stock-promotion 44/60


As a result, I think all investors should pay very close attention to who is verifying financial
statement accuracy and protecting shareholders, especially if you insist on speculating on
tiny, unprofitable reverse mergers like BBLU.


Are BBLU's Financials Reliable and Trustworthy?


Given that BBLU CEO Johnny Thomas oversaw and led an acquisition-driven company
later alleged to be a "massive fraud" with "accounting manipulations" I believe this is a
valid question - one made especially relevant by BBLU's history of choosing questionable
auditors, starting with Lake & Associates, CPA.


In the 2011 BBLU 10-K Lake & Associates is listed as the auditor. In 2013, the PCAOB
(Public Company Accounting Regulators) censured both the firm (Lake & Associates) and
founder Jay Charles Lake, revoked the registration of the firm and barred Lake from
being an associated person of a registered public accounting firm. This 2013 PCAOB
statement is an amazing read, detailing how Lake "audited" China Fruits Corporation and
China Logistics Incorporated.


Furthermore: "…[Lake] had overall responsibility at the firm for promoting compliance with
Board standards, after engagement teams under his supervision had failed to perform
required audit procedures to address fraud risks at their clients."


Lake's 2010 and 2012 PCAOB inspection reports were also both alarming with examples
found by examiners of "failure to identify, or to address appropriately a departure from
GAAP that related to potentially material omission from audited financial statements of
required disclosure concerning related party transactions". Then there's: "[F]ailure, in two
audits, to identify or address appropriately departures from GAAP that related to
potentially material misstatements in the audited financial statements concerning the
statement of cash flows."


The 2010 and 2012 PCAOB reports show us that patterns of questionable behavior and
poor oversight were occurring and found easily online in less than one minute of Googling.
What kind of companies does Lake & Associates, CPA typically work with? There are
countless nightmare investments but for example (before they were revoked) Lake was
apparently the auditor for GRZG. GRZG was a "company" where the stock was allegedly
promoted with a paid $1.1 million hard glossy mailer stock promotion campaign before it
declined -99% from the peak to current price of $0.03 per share.

Lake & Associates seems to be based in Tampa with some business in Chicago, while
BBLU is headquartered in Nevada. Why did BBLU choose Lake and Associates? Why
would any legitimate company partner with an auditing firm of that quality?


After Lake & Associates, Blue Earth engaged marginal auditor HJ & Associates, a Salt
Lake City audit firm that offers Rent-A-CFO services to public companies, among other
things. According to Capital IQ data, HJ & Associates has 48 public company clients
including BBLU. Of these clients, 44/48 sell for <$0.50 per share, and 43/48 have <$50
million market cap. Many of these stocks sell for less than a nickel per share. My opinion
is that HJ & Associates is simply not a credible auditor for any legitimate public company.


Don't take my word for it though, see these PCAOB deficiency reports for HJ & Associates
from 2006 and 2010.


2006:


"The inspection team identified matters that it considered to be audit deficiencies.
The deficiencies identified in two of the audits reviewed included deficiencies of such
significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm did not obtain
sufficient competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the issuer's
financial statements. Those deficiencies included-the failure to perform and
document sufficient procedures to test revenue


This issue seems shockingly similar to me to what contributed to the ABTX wipeout.


"2010: The deficiencies identified in one of the audits reviewed included a deficiency
of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time
it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient competent evidential matter to
support its opinion on the issuer's financial statements. That deficiency was the
failure to perform sufficient audit procedures to evaluate the accounting for
financial instruments."

In the process of appointing Mr. Krusi to the board, Chairman Laird Q. Cagan also
voluntarily resigned from his position on the Audit Committee. It also seems there were
past "material weaknesses" in BBLU's internal controls.


I'd like to state for the record that I am not accusing BBLU of accounting fraud at this
stage. What I am saying is that a management team with direct ties to alleged prior
accounting issues and restatements with a history of wipeouts owes it to shareholders to
hire top quality auditors and err on the side of conservatism with its financials. Based on
the foregoing evidence, I believe it is wise to be cautious when analyzing BBLU's financial
statements.


BBLU SEC FOIA 7(a) REPONSE: INDICATES EVIDENCE OF A CURRENT LAW
ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION REGARDING BBLU


Most worrisome, a recent FOIA request to the SEC about BBLU returned a 7(a)
exemption which indicates to me there is evidence of some kind of law enforcement
investigation related to BBLU.

what is going on. This could be about something minor or something devastating.

This is yet another reason I believe investors should remain cautious on shares of Blue
Earth though. We know the SEC has investigated at least one prior Thomas company,
requiring financial restatements in the case of ABTX and resulting in bankruptcy.
Therefore, I view this 7(a) exemption response as a red flag that deserves attention.


BBLU Looks like a Free Call Option for Management at Shareholders' Expense


In my view, it is clear all 3 companies, ABTX, CNSV and BBLU are failed, capital
destroying Johnny Thomas and John Francis rollups. I can't blame them for trying though,
in a sense this is actually a great business strategy for insiders as its effectively private
equity via the public markets. You get involved with a reverse merger shell company, issue
yourself lots of low strike warrants or nearly free stock, hire questionable stock promoters
to promote the stock, and begin buying assets left and right primarily in overpriced stock.
The strategy is asymmetric: If it works, you will get the upside of the low strike warrants
and can cash out very profitably plus your cash salary and any benefits. If it doesn't work,
then unlike private equity, you are not on the hook because your personal capital is not
really at risk and you still get your cash salary and any other benefits. Shareholders will
likely get wiped out in that scenario, but no biggie since it isn't management's personal
cash that bankrolled the company.


I believe, this strategy is best encapsulated by the following YouTube video:


BIG MONEY BIG MONEY NO WHAMMIES


I think BBLU is a Whammy


(picture credit to the legendary Press Your Luck game show)


In the meantime, insiders collect hefty salaries, which is a good deal for them because I
speculate that no private company would put people with resumes like this in charge of
anything important. It seems entirely possible that Johnny Thomas and John Francis don't
really have any other options for work other than unviable reverse merger rollups using
paid stock promoters.

EVEN IF YOU LISTEN TO STOCK PROMOTERS AND TAKE THE "BLUE SKY" CASE,
BBLU STOCK IS STILL IMPOSSIBLY OVERVALUED, -93.3% DOWNSIDE ON
VALUATION ALONE


I think there is a compelling case to be made Johnny Thomas' guidance to investors is not
something you want to bet your life (or your wallet) on. That being said, perhaps the single
craziest aspect of BBLU stock is that it is dramatically over valued even if you trust
management and assume the Johnny Thomas' dream comes true as planned! Below are
the SeeThruEquity estimates which seem to me to line up closely with BBLU management
guidance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2578955-blue-earth-strong-sell-on-law-enforcement-investigation-fraud-allegations-and-paid-stock-promotion 50/60


As you can see, even these wildly optimistic estimates show BBLU only generating 2015
earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) of $0.01 with that increasing to a whopping $0.02
in 2016. That means that even assuming all these proposed projects and "guidance"
come through that BBLU is currently valued at an insane 268x P/E on 2015 estimates and
134x P/E based on 2016 numbers. Since BBLU has a history of large losses and cash
burn, if we value BBLU on this optimistic 2014 revenue numbers, which means BBLU is
currently valued at ~12x revenue. These valuations are clearly ridiculous and remember
we are using wildly optimistic estimates I feel are virtually impossible.


Let me elaborate:


Shareholder Peer company Tetra Tech (TICKER: TTEK) is a "real" $1.5 billion company
with ~$200 million in cash that is global in scale and focused on solving the world's water
problems and exposure to renewable energy end markets. It is larger, growing, profitable
and run by some very credible people with PhDs. I believe TTEK is obviously a vastly
superior company to BBLU in virtually every possible way. TTEK trades for ~0.80x
revenue (BBLU is not profitable and burns cash so you can't value it using any profitability
or cash flow metrics).


If we are generous and value BBLU at the same valuation as superior peer company
TTEK while simultaneously using the absurdly optimistic estimates from SeeThru (which I
believe are obviously impossible), BBLU would be valued at $0.17 per share based on
2014 estimates or $0.82 per share on 2015 estimates, for something between -93.3% to
-68% downside. These are probably generous valuations for BBLU.


BBLU: -67.66% Downside Just to Acquisition Value


BBLU had paid a total of $63.5 million, primarily in stock, for its acquisitions so far. Despite
repeated failures so far and I believe due to the temporary impact of paid stock promoters,
the current market market cap of BBLU is a whopping $196 million. If BBLU was valued
just at the value of their acquired businesses and ignoring the disappointing failures so far,
BBLU would be valued at just $0.863 per share, creating immediate -67.66% downside.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2578955-blue-earth-strong-sell-on-law-enforcement-investigation-fraud-allegations-and-paid-stock-promotion 51/60


Remember, BBLU has not been able to provide capital or financing necessary to come
even close to their guidance and BBLU's last 10-Q filing shows no broken out R&D
spending. I would argue BBLU should trade at a discount to their acquisition value based
on that and history of losing money and dilution. I think it is irrational to value BBLU at
over 3x the value they paid for the businesses that make up their company. Especially
when the management team is literally one of the worst I have ever seen based on their
ability to destroy capital.


Furthermore, why are business sellers willing to be paid in stock at this absurd valuation?
And why would these business owners feel comfortable being paid in stock that could be
inflated by questionable paid stock promoters? Anyone being paid in BBLU stock at
anything close to current stock prices is taking a very dangerous gamble in my view and I
believe has near-term risk of losing -80% or more of the value of that stock.


MANAGEMENT RESPONSE


After calling BBLU's headquarters multiple times I was eventually able to get in touch with
someone involved with BBLU. When asked detailed questions about unit economics and
returns on capital on their proposed businesses, they were unable to answer. Instead
more stories about large potential markets and potential opportunities were given. None of
my questions were answered satisfactorily. Upon receiving the SEC FOIA response I

BBLU Chart Now Officially Breaking Down: Indicating Near-Term -77% Downside
"Best Case"


(picture credit Capital IQ)


I believe it is clear BBLU stock has now obviously broken through technical support and is
heading lower. BBLU's next level of technical support is at $0.62 per share, which
matches relatively closely with near-term valuation downside from multiple fundamental
valuation analyses presented. It is rare to see both the fundamental and technical pictures
align so perfectly. Note, however, that BBLU has 600% more shares outstanding than it
did back in 2011. So $0.62 near-term support may be a "false bottom" that may not hold.
As a result, BBLU may have considerably more near-term downside than this
conservative technical picture indicates as it "round trips" the recent move benefiting from
the multiple paid stock promoters.


CONCLUSION


The Plungefather Calls His Shot: Shares of BBLU Will End Up Worthless, Long-
Term Price Target $0

I believe BBLU stock will collapse as investors and partners come to understand the
disturbing truth and recognize the mistake they have made by being involved with these
people. Continued disappointment seems a near certainty to me with BBLU and as the
story we've seen so many times happens here again, I expect the outcome will be similar:
shareholder wipeout and bankruptcy.


The strangest thing to me is that not only have ABTX, CNSV and the others been
wipeouts for investors, but for the people that sold their businesses to Johnny Thomas
and John Francis, it wiped them out also if they didn't sell their stock in time.


And what partner would sell their business to BBLU in exchange for stock that is being
promoted by paid stock promoters? Doesn't that mean by definition that BBLU stock is
likely far over valued?


Johnny Thomas was given 1 million options for BBLU stock at $1, worth nearly over $1.5
million fully vested. John Francis also received nearly the same package with slightly
lower salary.


If BBLU is such an amazing concept or company, why not go through a "real" IPO process
instead of this unusual "reverse merger" which has gone so badly for many involved in the
past? And where are the institutional investors performing sophisticated and deep due
diligence? Why has BBLU paid some of the worst stock promoters on Wall Street to
promote their stock, presumably (given shareholder base) to retail investors?


I rate shares of BBLU STRONG SELL.

Good catch on a blatant stock promotion. Interesting to see that the auditor HJ and associates is also the auditor for
PCYG, which is playing around with suspicious revenue recognition to book bogus revenues.

My apologies but I must clarify. Bill Richardson was the former Governor of New Mexico, not Nevada. Please call his
contact number 505-988-7140 and give them an earful. At least tell him to do his job since he is on BBLU Board of
Directors.


Of course, the person answering would not comment. Does anyone know what agency you can call to find out about
any active investigation? They just recently listed this stock on the NASDAQ. Is everyone asleep at the switch in this
country when it comes to fraud against the small retail investor.


I thank the author of this article. Does the author know if anyone will be held responsible, or investigated, when this
stock blows up? Doesn't the NASDAQ have any regulating authority that should uncover this before small time

Excellent! I would love to work with you because you have outstanding sources. What is always the same at these
revolving scams, the players are on each other's boards. Too bad for them that the internet can now easily expose
them. Only seven years ago, that might not have been possible.

Pump Stopper: Fantastic article. I greatly appreciate it. Just being a natural skeptic, the one area I would like to

I just want to say thank you Pump Stopper. You are doing servants work. May you have eternal rewards for exposing
these charlatans. I applaud you for being a watch guard for peasants like myself.


I got BBLU as a stock tip from a local financial firm in Rochester, NY, that I presumed did its due diligence. Needless
to say I paid heavily for my education. I wish there were a paid agency that did this type of work for a fee, since our
government regulators are incompetent, or too overwhelmed to protect us.


This will continue as long as they profiteers can make pay offs, and are never held accountable. The revolving door of
politicians advancing to higher degrees of theft as they retire from public service,lol, to much greater degrees of theft
and corruption.


These folks should be serving time in jail, next to the violent felons I used to lock up as a urban law enforcement
officer.


Bill Richardson was nominated for a Nobel Prize. I guess when your level of criminality rises high enough, you receive
international acclaim with the likes of Yassar Arafat, and President Obama.

It was an uncompensated stock tip during casual conversation from someone in the financial business, so I
prefer not to.


I am certain the person is upstanding and reputable. I am sure he feels bad also. I wouldn't rub salt in a
wound like that. The person may have already gotten any clients out, and I never had follow up conversation
about BBLU.


My expensive education is in what I lost after selling today. No regrets as you likely saved me from even
deeper red territory.


I assume responsibility for investing and have passed on bad advice myself, unknowingly. What is troubling is
how these OTC BB stocks get listed on the NASDAQ when it is clear to someone with knowledge, like
yourself, that the fundamentals don't add up.


Shouldn't the SEC have a better handle on the folks they know have misled investors in the past?


Shouldn't that be a red flag?


The political connection makes this stink even further. Why doesn't the SEC expose this immediately. Oh
yeah, the regulators are now pawns. When you have the likes of Eric Holder as the US Attorney General, well
I guess anything goes for the Democrats.


I filed a complaint with the SEC today, just for giggles. I wish you worked for them Pump Stopper. A person
with a passion, like yourself could probably do some well needed damage to these criminals. Of course, they
would find a way to get rid of you for seeking the truth.


Anyways I look forward to your future exposes, and will be a loyal follower.

Good article on Blue Earth. 
It looks like you have done some good research. 
Not positive where the truth lies about this company.  
But you should be careful about disparaging reputable firms like RedChip. 
They are not perfect but as far as far as small cap I.R. firms are concerned they have represented some good
companies and they have a very transparent platform. 
Since I follow their stocks I called the folks at RedChip today and they said that they have not represented Blue Earth
in over two years.  
They said that they did not write research on the company because they had unanswered questions about their
business.  
They did not provide any details. 
It sounds like they might have been on to something as well. 
Keep up the good work.

I personally have talked to Liviakis. I made a fantastic trade on his recommendation in Pacific Ethanol based in CA
that went from $2.50 to $9 or so back in 1998. Sold it at $6+. the three other subsequent recommendations from
Liviakis lost all the profit plus the principal. BBLU was the last recommendation that I spoke to one of his promoters. I
have 7 different telephone numbers saved for him and his office. I do not take the calls any more, unless they call
from a different number, then I save that one to the list also.

So, SEC filing shows definitively that Pump Stopper was wrong. Liviakis was increasing his position by about 50%,
definitely not dumping. If one actually look at the 13D and the proxy that PS holds up as evidence that Liviakis sold
"all his stock," you'll pretty much have to conclude that Pump Stopper willfully mislead people here.


PS notes that a 13D filing from August of 2012 "showed Liviakis owned almost 10% of BBLU stock." That is correct.
Liviakis owned almost 1.9 million shares, or 9.91% of BBLU stock. PS then points out that a proxy from March of 2014
does not show Liviakis to be a 5% owner. This, again, is correct. But note the stupendous error of basic math and
reasoning (to put things charitably) that leads to this conclusion: "Interpret this to mean that Liviakis has sold some or
all of his BBLU stock." PS complains frequently about BBLU's steadily increasing number of shares, and I'm pretty
sure he knows that fractions have numerators and denominators, so I'd have to conclude that he's intentionally
deceiving people here.


By the time that proxy was released, BBLU had over 63 MILLION shares outstanding, so the only thing we can
conclude from the evidence put forth by PS is that Liviakis could not have PURCHASED more than about 1.2 million
shares, since that would have put him over the 5% threshold. Think about that. But it gets worse. About five lines after
erroneously concluding that Liviakis must have sold "some or all" of his stock, PS drops this doozy: "Liviakis appears
to have helped BBLU uplist to the NASDAQ but then sold all [!] his shares? When a stock promoter sells all his stock
what does it tell you?" The mind reels. If one is really bad at math one might conclude that he sold "some or all"--but
how does PS then get to ALL?


24 Oct 2014, 08:10 AM


CuriousDave
Well said. Let's see BBLU come forward with an update of the CHP project they've been mentioning for many
months now, then I think the rest of this ludicrous article will lose all credence and the stock will return to it's
pre-shorted level around 3.00 to 4.00.


Even if it is delayed a few months and otherwise still on track, and mention of continued interest in their
services, and I'll be much more at ease and back in the saddle.

atrickpay, I'm not sure I follow you on this margin call business. I was an ABTX investor and watched JT build it out of
nothing, which is why I have so much confidence in him. He was a strong believer in that company, even after he

Congratulations Pump Stopper. This article is sourced from extensively in the securities fraud class action complaint
filed by a BBLU shareholder in a federal trial court in California last week. The complaint credits the article as the
cause of the share price correction.


In the complaint, paragraph 25 on page 8 reads: "On October 21, 2014, SeekingAlpha.com published an article
concerning Blue earth that questioned, among other things, the viability of UPStealth." That article is yours, the one
above these comments. The next two paragraphs are sourced from the article. Paragraph 28 on page 14 then states:
"Following this negative news, the Company's stock fell $1.29 per share, or 50%, on extraordinary volume from its
previous closing price to close at $1.29 per share on October 21, 2014." (The whole complaint is 24 pages in length.)

The shareholder who filed this action, against BBLU, the CEO, CFO and a VP, purportedly seeks to represent
purchasers of BBLU common stock who purchased between 7 October 2013 and 21 October 2014, inclusive. The
aim of the lawsuit is to recover damages for BBLU shareholders under federal securities laws. Thus far it seems only
this one complaint has been filed but more may be forthcoming as other affected holders may still commence their
own legal actions and seek to lead the proceedings.


Whoever interested in reading the actual complaint, please send me a direct message here on SA or via Skype
(kranenburgesq) so I can send it to you.
