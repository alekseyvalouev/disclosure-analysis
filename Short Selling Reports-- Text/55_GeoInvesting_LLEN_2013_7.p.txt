L&L Energy: New Disclosures, More Misrepresentations
Oct. 9, 2013 12:47 PM ET69 comments
by: The GeoTeam


On October 7, 2013 L&L Energy (NASDAQ:LLEN) issued yet another misrepresentative
press release, in which the company tried to attribute nearly half of its fiscal 2013 coal-
washing revenue to a second previously undisclosed facility that LLEN refers to as
"TaiFung". The press release states:


"During the period in question, L&L operated two (2) washing facilities, Hong Xing
and TaiFung. During fiscal 2013, Hong Xing washing only represented approximately
20% of consolidated total company sales (not 39% as alleged by GeoInvesting),
while TaiFung washing represented approximately 19% of company sales."


A simple review of LLEN's public filings shows this is a misrepresentation. Based on
LLEN's 2013 10-K, "TaiFung" owns the Hong Xing Coal Washing Factory, and Taifung
itself is only a wholesale coal marketing and distributing company:


"On November 30, 2009, TNI acquired 100% of the equity interest in SeZone County
Hong Xing Coal Washing Factory ("Hong Xing"), which was subsequently
transferred to Tai Fung (as defined below), another subsidiary of the Company."


…..


"On March 8, 2011, the Company entered into an Operating Agreement to invest up
to US$3,063,069 (RMB 20,000,000) in a newly established entity, Tai Fung, a
Chinese company established in SeZone Country, Yunnan Province, PRC. TaiFung
is a marketing and distributing company of coals throughout China and had
yet to begin operation as of April 30, 2011."


LLEN's corporate chart from its 2013 10-K shows TaiFung's ownership of Hong Xing and
wholesale coal operations as follows:

Never, in any of LLEN's public filings, is there any mention of a TaiFung coal
washing facility.


According to LLEN's corporate chart, LLEN only owns two coal-washing plants: Hong Xing
Coal Washing Plant and DaPuAn Coal Washing Plant. LLEN has made it very clear in its
2013 10-K that the DaPuAn Coal Washing Plant only washes coal from the DaPuAn Mine
with "no washing reported separately," as shown below:


"We own two washing facilities with an aggregate annual coal-washing capacity of
approximately 480,000 tons. The facility at Hong Xing washes coal mainly for third
parties (i.e., non-affiliates to the Company.) The facility at the DaPuAn Coal mine
only washes coal from the DaPuAn mine."


"Since DaPuAn only washes its own coal from its own mine, we only listed the raw
coal under the Mining Segment. We have considered this is part of the total
service provided within DaPuAn before the coal was sold to customer. There
was no washing reported separately."


Our visits to TaiFung at the end of 2011 and again in June and July of 2013 showed it is
impossible that TaiFung could have a coal washing business at either its business address
or its registered address we visited.


Our pictures of TaiFung's business address we visited are as follows:

We also obtained TaiFung's basic SAIC information that showed a registered address of
A6-101, Lvhai Garden, Weibi Ave. Danfeng Town, Shizong County, at as follows:

The following pictures are of TaiFung's registered address:


Neither TaiFung's business address nor its registered address we visited has a coal
washing plant on their premises. Therefore, based on all of the above we conclude that
LLEN's press release claim of operating a "TaiFung" coal washing facility is false and

misleading.


Furthermore, Clayton Fong Acknowledged on the Fiscal 2013 Conference Call that
LLEN Coal Washing Revenues are Only Generated from the Hong Xing Facility


On the July 31, 2013 conference call, Clayton Fong attributed all 470,000 tons of coal
washed in fiscal 2013 to the Hong Xing facility and admitted that Hong Xing is the only
(coal washing facility) LLEN would segment separately:


"…The coal washing at Hong Xing has been relatively steady year-over-year.
2012 to 2013 we washed about overall 77,000 tons in that segment and that
compares to about 62, 63 - excuse me, let me get the actual tons right: We went
from about 400,000 tons to 470,000 tons year-over-year. That area has been a
little more steady. I don't have the breakdown between the two [facilities], but I know
because, I would expect and I'll make sure of this, but I believe that's all of the
Hong Xing facility, because those numbers exclude the Ping Yi mine, which
was a split facility and they also - and Hong Xing will be the only facility we
would count separately. The DaPuAn mine washes only its only coal, so it
tends to just get lumped in with its coal sales, not a separate breakout on
washing…"

What About the HunTai Facility that LLEN Claimed TaiFung Will Operate?


On July 10, 2012 LLEN issued a press release disclosing that TaiFung would operate a
coal-washing facility called "HunTai", then in trial production.


However, the press release clearly states that "L&L will receive a management fee for
operating the plant and can earn revenues from wholesaling the washed coal." LLEN
estimated its future wholesale revenues and earnings from operating HunTai as follows:


"The agreement is expected to generate approximately $63 million of additional
wholesale revenue and $5.9 million in net income, based on coal pricing of $160
per ton. Additionally, L&L will earn a management fee of $0.5 million for the next 12
months of operation."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1736692-l-and-l-energy-new-disclosures-more-misrepresentations 5/20


Therefore any revenue from selling coal washed at the HunTai facility (if there is any)
would be booked as wholesale revenue, and not included in LLEN's coal washing revenue
reported in its 2013 10-K.


We can only conclude that either LLEN fabricated its TaiFung coal washing claim, or that
possibly LLEN changed the accounting treatment of HunTai washed coal revenues from
the treatment disclosed in the press release announcing the original agreement.
Regardless of what percentage of fiscal 2013 revenues LLEN now wants to attribute to
Hong Xing, it is a fact that the only remaining staff on site as well as the local government
officials we interviewed were quite certain that Hong Xing shut down in June 2012.


While we will not share the video recording of our lengthy interviews, (the NASDAQ and
SEC need time to verify the information with its sources), some key points are as follows:


1. A major accident killed 34 miners at the Si Zhuang Coal Mine on November 10, 2011
and prompted a government-mandated shut down of mines in the area. The Si Zhuang
mine is less than 20 kilometers from the Hong Xing facility.


2. Following the mine shut downs, the supply of coal to be washed at Hong Xing sharply
declined, leading to the June 2012 closure of the facility.


3. Only after May 2013 did the coal production in the area gradually begin recovering.
Yunnan Coal and Energy (Shanghai: 600792), which also has several coal mines in
Shizong County, confirmed this point in an announcement.


The decline and subsequent closure of the Hong Xing facility were corroborated by our
interviews with the only remaining staff as well as by the tax record that showed only a
miniscule tax paid in the first half of 2012 and no tax paid (or even filed) to the local tax
bureau since June 2012.


In fact, we strongly believe that LLEN's false disclosure of the "winding down" of Hong
Xing's operations in an August 19, 2013 strategic update was prompted by LLEN's fear
that certain participants in the July 31, fiscal 2013 conference call had discovered the
2012 closure and were asking probative questions regarding the washing trend in the
current quarter (ending July 31, the day of the conference call!). Consider the following
very uncomfortable questions asked:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1736692-l-and-l-energy-new-disclosures-more-misrepresentations 6/20


"How much revenue is generated and how many tons of coal was washed at your
Hong Xing facility in Q4 and how was the trend in the Hong Xing coal washing in the
current Q1 compared to Q4."


"…can you at least comment on the trend from Q1 to Q4 in the [Hong Xing] coal
washing, can you give us a little color on the trend?"


"…referring back to Hong Xing. Would you consider that given in Q4, excuse me, in
Q1, in this current quarter that they are trending up at the Hong Xing coal washing
facility. Is that safe to assume from what you, from your answer, your last answer?


On August 19, 2013 LLEN disclosed it was "winding down" the Hong Xing operation. In
the current October 7, 2013 press release LLEN clarified by claiming "Hong Xing ceased
operations as of June 30, 2013 and produced no revenue in July 2013."


GeoInvesting simply asks: Why was Clayton Fong not aware of the supposed June 30th
closure, one month later, on the fiscal 2013 July 31 conference call? Why did Clayton
Fong respond to the repeated questions posed to him on July 31st that Hong Xing's
business was "trending up"?


Hong Xing Pays Taxes? Then Prove It


In its October 7, 2013 press release, LLEN simply claims "Hong Xing pays taxes to the
proper Chinese authorities for its sales." This statement proves nothing. LLEN then
proceeds to challenge GeoInvesting's findings from the Shizong County Local Tax Bureau.


In the event that Hong Xing paid its VAT tax and/or income tax based on PRC tax law,
investors need the company to provide those VAT tax invoices and/or income tax invoices
to the public. We urge LLEN to publish the tax invoices so that an independent third party
can verify them. GeoInvesting has already provided Hong Xing's tax information we
gathered to the SEC and NASDAQ.


Two days ago we reached out to their attorney, who is heading up the "independent
committee" and asked for a meeting with the committee. He said he appreciated us
reaching out and would ask the committee members if they would meet with us. We hope
to hear back soon so that we can be as much help as we can in bringing more clarity to
their investigation.


Disclosure: I am short LLEN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Look at that! You found some photos of a business' office!


And you don't like the fact that LLEN may have changed the way it classified revenue from the agreement with Hun
Tai.

Now you're asking for a meeting with the committee?


Why didn't you present your initial findings to the company and ask for clarification before you shorted and published

GeoInvesting my personal opinion is you should move on, I feel like your credibility is being lowered with each article
you write.


From my reading of the last reply from LLEN they are passing the findings on to an auditor who will look into claims of
income and report back. You sending out your pictures and your lengthy articles with no new content are not what
either side needs.


Let's just go through the process and let the auditors come back with the message on the income.


So far to this investor it looks like your mine ownership claim has been refuted and your income claim has also been
refuted. This leaves very little from your original article left.


Perhaps you should exit your short position and move on to the next hit piece. Just hopefully next time it wont be on a
company I am currently invested in.

BTW, according to the L&L. statement, the tax office your people "visited" doesn't collect income taxes on coal
washing; they are a county tax collector which would tax things such as construction... which frankly invalidates your
entire train of reasoning, Geo, which is like going to the DMV to see how much income tax Coca Cola paid, and then
concluding Coca Cola doesn't make coke when they say it's not there. I know you can read proper English, which

of SEC regulations.


From their press release: "In addition, GeoInvesting's allegation that they "sent [a] representative to visit the Shizong
County Local Tax Bureau, Second Branch [and t]he local tax bureau confirmed that the Hong Xing Coal Washing
Factory paid less than RMB 30,000 to the Shizong County Local Tax Bureau, fundamentally misrepresents how
Chinese tax collections operate. Hong Xing pays taxes to the proper Chinese authorities for its sales. The Shizong

county's special surcharges and taxes, including local education and construction surcharges. The surcharge amount
is generally small. "

Well, according to LLEN 10q filing for the period ending January 31 2012 (published on march 12 2012), the
company was planning on expand the Zonelin faclity. UNfortunately ... a government document dated january
21 2012 ... already reported the plan to shut down and demolish the facility!


how can you explain that?

Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
I'm not confirming your date (which I'm not certain of), but documents don't announce themselves. When was
L&L notified of the city's decision? According to Geo (I have not verified his statement), Quijing City Industry
and Information Technology Committee ISSUED A NOTICE on JUNE 6, 2012 regarding the elimination of
outdated production facilities in 2012." Unless L&L is extremely connected, this is when they would start
reacting; not before.


12 Oct 2013, 11:02 AM


Rolling O Research, Contributor
Easy. There was likely a choice as to whether to modernize (and expand,) or tear it down and destroy the
equipment.


By mid-June, the decision had been made, and that decision was to trade the plant to Union, which would
then tear it down and receive payment from the government.

Meanwhile, what's your other point? That they aren't washing coal in their subsidiary's main office? Wow, you're really

Again, as for your argument that Tai Fung hasn't been announced as doing coal washing, here it says they are in a
very public statement: 
SEATTLE, July 10, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- L&L Energy, Inc. 
..."L&L's TaiFung Coal Ltd. ("TaiFung") subsidiary and HunTai entered into the agreement on July 10. HunTai,
currently in trial operation, will expand L&L's coal washing operation in the region, providing the Company with further
recognition as an industry leader. The agreement is expected to generate approximately $63 million of additional
wholesale revenue and $5.9 million in net income, based on coal pricing of $160 per ton. Additionally, L&L will earn a
management fee of $0.5 million for the next 12 months of operation."...

That's so cute! You guys found someone who will interview you and provide the opportunity for Geo to rehash
its accusations, yet subtly shift the goalposts!


Face it, you're in a battle you're now losing, and the next part of your initial article to fall will be the bit about
Zonelin, which will likely turn out to be a perfectly acceptable deal where an out-of-date, polluting coking plant
was mandated by the government to be environmentally improved or torn down by the end of 2012.


When it was determined in mid-2012 that it was uneconomical to improve the plant and bring it up to code in
a declining coke market, the decision was made to demolish it. Then, because the PRC government was
paying the operator to tear the plant down, based on revenue over several years, LLEN swapped that value
to Union Energy, which handled the demolition and collected from the government.


Really too bad you didn't talk to LLEN about this stuff before you issued your first hit piece, because your
irresponsibility might result in a successful lawsuit against the author and Geo.

The first notes that in Geo's original article, they didn't include in the translation the part that says that Zonelin
was being closed for environmental reasons:

The second has a complete timeline that shows how LLEN's language in the 10-Qs and 10-K regarding
Zonelin changed as the fate of the plant became more certain. It also has a link to a translated document that
talks about incentives for plant improvement/demolition:

I forgot that the article at that link talks about incentives, but doesn't indicate how they might be calculated.


While I've never been able to find an actual schedule, the government paper at the following link contains the
following section on award conditions and criteria:

If this is how it worked, then LLEN needs to explain it a bit, but as I wrote in my post on IHub, if this is the
story, then the particulars don't matter once Union agreed to the deal.


09 Oct 2013, 05:58 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Exactly. The way I calculate this, Union did value the plant. The incentives must have been substantial: It was
described as a $37.1 million deal... 95% interest in the LuoZhou and LaShu mines in exchange for $1.7m in
Chinese cash + 60% of Daping (valued at $18.3m) + 98% of ZoneLin, so the equity in the ZoneLin coking
plant was valued at $17.1m. The Chinese government's financial incentive program accounts for the "missing
value" very soundly.

I have found this interview very funny.


1) I am not sure what functional difference is between a staff writer and a reporter. Does it require a staff
writer to verify source of infomation before disseminating? Luke seems to me never attempts to contact LLEN
for first-person interviews.


2) Information source gathered by Luke Jacobi apparently is very limited and secondary. I mean Dan David is
not from or aoosciated with KPMG TaiWan or LLEN. He's only a short seller working for GEO, which issues
negative reports about LLEN. The whole interview is purely based on short seller opinions with obvious
agenda and lacks any investigations or verification from insiders.


3) Answers provided are irrelvant to the argument of legitamcy. What does share dilution, size of US Head
office (with 12 staff members) or implication of government action have any direct correlation to the question
of legitimcay?


4) Luke seems never has any queries about what Dan says. His job is more like a copy and paste than
anything. Hiring big 4 and paying them handsome fees, they are regarded as truly independent; however,
issuing shares to independent committee members as compensation, they ought to become not truly
independent. Dan and Luke must have forgotten what credibilty, professional ethics and moral obligations are.

There is something to be added here: 
Geo, you preemptively accuse the L&L special committee of being unbiased because they hold shares. But
you hold shorts, which is completely analogous, for your these purposes. Therefore, by your own logic, your
reporting is not trustworthy.

Assuming TaiFung is the same as Taifeng, GEO again does not mention the TaiFung's basic SAIC information it
obtained also shows the business scope includes coal sale and COAL WASHING.


While I cannot rule out the possibility that Taifeng does have a coal washing operation, I must admit that LLEN public
reports are not complete. Information contain therein sometimes inconsistent and hard for readers to follow.
Apparently Dickson Lee lacks the ability to keep the company transparent. He really sould not hold two top positions
concurrently. He just does not have the time, energy and skills to fulfill his roles being the chairman and CEO of the
Company concurrently. He really should consider to take only one of these two top positions.

I caution against confusing "inconsistency" with "evolving over time". Always look at dates.

GEO Said: "the company tried to attribute nearly half of its fiscal 2013 coal-washing revenue to a second previously
undisclosed facility that LLEN refers to as "TaiFung"." ... "Never, in any of LLEN's public filings, is there any mention of
a TaiFung coal washing facility."


TaiFung is not a "facility"; it's a Chinese subsidiary, with a main office and equity holdings. Furthermore, TaiFung isn't
"undisclosed" - it's been reported in SEC filings for some time, and it was certainly mentioned in the July 30, 2013 10-

K, to cite one I read recently. Finally, the same 10-K -does- disclose Hong Xing equity being transferred to TaiFung,
which takes precedence over TaiFung's original role, when it was acquired.


"On March 8, 2011, the Company entered into an Operating Agreement to invest up to US$3,063,069 (RMB
20,000,000) in a newly established entity, Tai Fung, a Chinese company established in SeZone Country, Yunnan
Province, PRC. TaiFung is a marketing and distributing company of coals throughout China and had yet to begin
operation as of April 30, 2011. The net assets on acquisition date comprise only cash contributed by the 2% non-
controlling interest." 
... 
"On November 30, 2009, TNI acquired 100% of the equity interest in SeZone County Hong Xing Coal Washing
Factory (“Hong Xing”), which was subsequently transferred to Tai Fung (as defined below), another subsidiary of the
Company. Because the Company also has other trading companies such as TaiFung, DaXing, and in order to
streamline the organization and improve efficiency, TNI was cancelled with its registration in November 2012."

Anyone buying into the excuses of LLEN should review the excuses of Longwei Petroleum. Longwei went to 5 cents.
LLEN will too.


10 Oct 2013, 01:19 AM


Rolling O Research, Contributor
Geo had video of inactivity at Longwei's facilities at a time when they were supposed to be busy, and Geo led
with that video in the first report.


Unless they're waiting to spring similar vids on LLEN, Geo's first article appears to have depended upon a
lack of understanding on how LLEN actually arranges its contracts in China, and on interview with supposed
employees and locals which were probably "pay for play", just like in the prior hit on LLEN from a year or two
ago.


Bit by bit, Geo's story about LLEN is breaking down.


10 Oct 2013, 02:39 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Cool_ , why would Geo "spring" evidence on LLEN which would only serve to give Dickson Lee time to
fabricate more fake rebuttals, just like Longwei tried but fortunately failed to do.


10 Oct 2013, 03:25 PM


Rolling O Research, Contributor
Obviously, you don't understand what it means to "spring" a trap on an unsuspecting prey.


Geo waited for Longwei to provide a counter-video supposedly showing activity at one of the facilities, then
put out another video it had held in reserve that showed the entrance of the same facility during the same

time period, which showed little activity, thus springing the trap.


Contrast that with Geo's response to LLEN so far. It's been purely reactive, with no new proof.


The article to which we're now commenting was "weak tea", and did nothing to further Geo's claims.


In fact, the stock went up a bit yesterday after it was published.


10 Oct 2013, 03:43 PM


adecinvestor
How do you explain the fact that so many insiders have bought the stocks themselves?


16 Oct 2013, 12:52 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
No insider has purchased a single share. All the Form 3s and 4s you see are for shares LLEN gave to
insiders, to pay them in lieu of cash, which is odd for a company claiming to be so profitable. It also creates a
huge conflict of interest for independent directors examining Geo's allegations.


16 Oct 2013, 08:54 AM


Greenfire87
I believe that is an option officers have. If I believed the Co. I worked for has potential, I also would accept
stock in lu of cash.


16 Oct 2013, 10:34 AM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
In fact that's a distortion. They AGREED to accept shares instead of pay. In that regard, you could say they
are spending every penny they earn on L&L shares.


16 Oct 2013, 12:30 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
I dont believe it was a choice, I dont think LLEN has the cash to pay.


16 Oct 2013, 12:31 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Get out of here. There's no precedent for saying that. The clear message L&L's board and staff were sending
was that they know Geo's claims are false, and they are so confident of that, that they are willing to stake their
entire compensation on it. Each day they are at work is a day they are sure Geo is wrong.

Rolling O Research, Contributor
I see that you folks at Geo aren't too impressed with the SeeThru analysis that LLEN today highlighted on its site, and
wish that they had done some "on-the-ground due diligence".


I can understand your concern, as it would have been great if another analyst had confirmed that there is no coal
washing going on at TaiFung's downtown business address.


Of course, your DD also was incomplete, as a complete exposé would have involved your gaining access to the
bathrooms of the business office, and determining that there was no coal washing being done in the washbasins.


10 Oct 2013, 12:30 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
SeeThrough charges $5,500 for companies to present at their conferences. So their independence depends on them
writing positive enough reports to convince companies to pay them $5,500. OK


10 Oct 2013, 12:38 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Who said L&L presented at their conference? Initiating coverage isn't the same thing.


10 Oct 2013, 12:41 PM


Rolling O Research, Contributor
Sure, Seethru arranges conferences where small companies not followed by larger investment houses have
to pay to present to potential investors, and according to their website, LLEN has presented at their
conferences in the past.


That, in an of itself, is pretty common.


Your post would carry far more weight if you went after the content of the report, rather than the business
model of the company that wrote it.

Excellent work Herb! Appreciate the effort.


11 Oct 2013, 06:05 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Thanks! After all the homework I've done, I might be submitting an article on L&L in the near future.


11 Oct 2013, 08:36 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
What content? Did Seethru ever visit the facilities in China and interview employees? If so, they would have
concluded that LLEN is a scam.


10 Oct 2013, 01:44 PM


Rolling O Research, Contributor
And based on some of the data used by Geo, along with further online research, I've concluded that Geo is
wrong, and that the Geo analyst ignored available data that would have shown his published analysis wrong.


For example, see my comments above regarding Zonelin.


Couple things like that, along with the fact that Geo never went to LLEN to express their concerns and ask for
clarification, I believe that Geo has, through its irresponsibility, created grounds for a lawsuit.


10 Oct 2013, 01:54 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Alfred, everything Geo has said here is debunked; the same goes for his other articles: either debunked, or
highly suspect [which gives presumption of innocence to L&L, not Geo]. A patient read of the commentary,
L&L's rebuttals & SEC filings will reveal that fact. Geo has already been reported to the SEC on multiple
counts of presenting materially false, unsubstantiated and misleading statements about a company. I honestly
feel sorry for the guy, because this is a downward turning point for his whole career, and his credibility. He
played a credible role in the Longwei expose, but in this case, sticking to his position is only making it worse
for him. He needs to issue a retraction. It's his only hope.


10 Oct 2013, 01:59 PM

Herbert, you are wrong and will learn the truth soon enough.

Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Alfred, I advise you to read the commentary of this, and all the L&L GeoBashing series, and then cover your
short; the market is starting upwards on L&L, whatever you personally believe, because Geo is out of ammo -
and he was shooting blanks to begin with. I've personally researched and developed retorts to everything Geo
has said. My retorts are based on SEC filings, press releases, sound logic and direct reference to Geo's
articles. Geo has subtly shifted his position, sometimes, to adapt to refutations (mine or other's), and without
mentioning that he was wrong, before...he's clearly doing this for personal reasons. His articles are all smoke
and mirrors. His verbage is raw deception: Consider this article, where he first claims TaiFung was "previously
undisclosed" - that's just a complete lie. Therefore I must warn you that Geo is a bad source of information. It
appears to me as if self interest or myopic thinking have damaged the integrity of his reports.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Herbert, I understand that you've done some research, but you haven't been to China and interviewed the staff of the
facilities and government officials. I am certain NASDAQ will halt and delist LLEN after Geo's findings are confirmed.


10 Oct 2013, 04:52 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Alfred, Geo has yet to disclose any specific source. He says he interviewed "locals", "government officials",
Union Energy "managers", and all of them of unknown station. An equity transfer is not something ordinary
people know about...even within a company. If you worked at McDonald's, you would have no idea who was
collecting dividends on your company's stock. It's even more so, here. Equity transfers happen in their
financial stratosphere, and they weren't looking up.


10 Oct 2013, 05:15 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
You don't think local officials would be aware of plant closures and ownership?


10 Oct 2013, 07:04 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
Would a county clerk know who owns equity in McDonald's? No. Would his office records tell him? No. Would
he know if a gas station were closed for a few days? Doubtful.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Herbert - of course not, but officials certainly know when a plant has been shut down for over a year and
workers are all laid off. They also have a very good understanding of the ownership, before and after a
closure, as they are looking for entrepreneurs to redevelop the sites and rehire workers.


10 Oct 2013, 09:01 PM


Herbert Samuel Jennings, Contributor
This is all speculation, but there are scenarios where the local officials don't know... L&L has said the facility
was opened and closed at times... asking someone who only saw it closed doesn't mean it was never open.
