Summary


Short Ideas Tech


In the 2nd half of 2015 mobile revenue growth began declining. Mobile is 75% of
their traffic.


We estimate pre-acquisition total core organic revenue growth is declining
approximately 6%.


Having fully lapped all recent acquisition, we believe negative core growth will
again become apparent in coming quarters.


As the core continues to decline they will be forced to acquire more companies to
replace lost revenue, further weaken the balance sheet.


We see 60% downside on extreme valuation. Major shareholders led by AOL's
Steve Case have been selling at a loss. 2.4mil shares held by this group remain as
an overhang.

It's been a tough couple of years for investors in Everyday Health, Inc.
(NYSE:NYSE:EVDY). EVDY became a public company March 28th, 2014 raising
approximately $100mil at $14 per share. After an initial rally, the stock declined for over
a year before recovering more recently. The move down mainly reflected initially
disappointing quarterly results along with concern over front-page headlines on
pharmaceutical pricing. EVDY relies heavily on drug company digital advertising.
Potential regulation could cause drug companies to spend less on advertising.


The recent rebound has been the result of a couple of decent quarters that have made
believers out of the EVDY faithful combined with retreating concern of a political crack-
down on big pharma. Our concerns remain largely on the mid to long-term trends that
we feel investors are currently ignoring.


The company is facing several revenue growth headwinds while expenses grow faster
than revenue. Starting this quarter the company has now lapped revenue growth driven
by the three acquisitions they've made since going public. We believe their core pre-
acquisition organic revenue growth is declining and will reveal itself in coming quarters.
As a result growth will be harder to come by in future quarters without further
acquisitions. When combined with what we see as extremely extended valuation, we
see significant downside for the stock of 60% or more over the next 12-24 months.

Who Are
They?



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVDY?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
In the simplest terms, EVDY can be thought of as a poor man's WebMD
(NASDAQ:WBMD). Like WebMD, EVDY mainly sells digital advertising to
pharmaceutical companies. This portion of their business they call "advertising &
sponsorship" and it represents about 90% of their business. 75-80% of this 90% is
pharmaceutical digital advertising to both consumers and physicians. EVDY health has
three "flagship" sites and they include everydayhealth.com, medpagetoday.com and
whattoexpect.com. Everydayhealth.com is a general consumer oriented healthcare site
similar to WebMD.com. Medpagetoday.com is a site geared toward professionals
(physicians) and is similar to WebMD's Medscape.com. Whattoexpect.com is the
leading site for mothers-to-be and is comparable to sites like Thebump.com.


Overall EVDY has about two-dozen websites and over a dozen mobile apps but by far
the majority of their business is associated with the three flagship properties. With the
exception of whattoexpect.com where the company is the industry leader in a small,
albeit strong category, WebMD is by far the dominant player in the industry and the
company they compete directly with most often.


The other 10% of their business is "premium services." Premium services mainly
consists of two revenue streams. The 1st is their legacy subscription business that they
are fading out. This includes sites like SouthBeachDiet.com and JillianMichaels.com.
These high margin recurring revenue lines will be a drag on earnings as they are
phased out.


The 2nd is the company's first entry into Software as a Service (SAAS) with the
acquisition in August 2015 of a company called Tea Leaves. Tea Leaves is also the
initial entry into marketing to payers (insurance co's) and providers (hospitals). This year
management is very focused on growing this very small part of their overall business.
Tea Leaves currently represents only about 5% of total revenue. According to the
company, this business will be a significant drag on 2016 adjusted EBITDA as they
ramp up spending to support growth.

The digital
ad industry
is expected
to continue
strong
growth for
the
foreseeabl
e future as
television
and print


advertising move to the Internet. Specifically, healthcare and pharmaceutical digital ad
spend is expected to grow at a 12.4% CAGR from $1.43bil in 2014 to $2.55bil by 2019
according to eMarketer. However, these general trends are well established and
reflected in current stock expectations.


Healthcare digital ad spend currently only constitutes 2.8% of total digital ad spend as of
2015. EVDY boasts that this low percentage means there is a huge opportunity for them
to expand digital ad market share in the category. Interestingly, although healthcare
digital ad spend is expected to grow, it is not expected that healthcare share of the
market will grow. This reflects the reluctance of the healthcare industry to move to digital
as they continue to rely on traditional TV and print media.



http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Digital-Ad-Spend-US-Healthcare-Pharma-Industry-Catch-Up/1012526
In The Beginning:


EVDY may be only two years old as a public company but they're actually a fourteen-
year old company started in 2002. Current CEO Ben Wolin former president Mike
Keriakos and Mark Tauber founded the company in a Brooklyn kitchen and the original
name of the company was Agora Media. The initial idea was to open a web portal
focused on diet and fitness content. From here the model quickly transitioned to building
out off-line brands online.


SouthBeachDiet.com, now a legacy business they are phasing out was actually their
first big hit. The idea was to approach experts and brands that didn't have a presence
online, like a book author, and convince them to partner with the company. In exchange
EVDY would create and promote websites that sold subscriptions to the publishers
content like diet plans and health advice. Other early content partners included New Age
doctor Andrew Weil, fitness guru Denise Austin, finance expert Jean Chatzky and
Tyndale House Publishers known for their evangelical Christian series "Left Behind."
Since it was incremental revenue for the content owner, it was a win-win.


The original plan was to advertise the partner brand/content by buying advertising (not
selling) on other sites to drive traffic and revenue subscriptions on their partner sites.
Although they did sell some advertising on the partner websites, the main objective of
the business was the sale of subscriptions. Comparing that to their current business
model it's clear they are now at the completely opposite end of the spectrum as 90% of
revenue now comes from selling advertising and they are phasing out the brand/content
subscription business.


The First of Many Poor Business Combinations:



http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080623/13639-michael-keriakos-ben-wolin.html
Back in 2003 an early investor in Agora Media named Bo Peabody convinced Ben
Wolin's team to buy his defunct company Streetmail.com. The combined company was
called Waterfront Media (later renamed Everyday Health). Streetmail was an email that
focused on local small town news. It really had nothing to do with EVDY's focus on
expanding content and brand subscriptions in diet and health. Peabody argued the
company had cash on the balance sheet, plus it was a way for him to try and get a
return for investors that had dumped $14mil into Streetmail. It probably didn't hurt that
his venture fund Village Ventures was part of an investment group that included Time
Warner Investments, Rho Capital and Star Ventures that invested $4mil into Waterfront
Media. Of course Streetmail.com was eventually shutdown.


This was the first of several examples of poor business combinations led by the current
CEO. At the time Mr. Peabody seemed to believe they had a real winner in what would
become EVDY. He was quoted as saying that "if Streetmail had started in 1994 or 1992
and had grown during the boom, it would have done quite well," but they had the
misfortune of focusing the business on selling advertising revenue. He went on to
say that Waterfront Media's approach was different because they "took advantage of
what was killing Streetmail," instead of selling digital ads, Waterfront is a huge
buyer.


Of course as we've already described, EVDY derives most of their current revenue from
selling digital advertising, not buying. It seems from the very get-go, the company didn't
really know what they wanted to be. It was the old "throw it at the wall and see what
sticks" method of growing a business. As we'll describe, not much has really changed at
EVDY to this day. The fact that they started as buyers of advertising and flipped the
script to become mainly sellers of digital advertising we believe is the first of many red
flags for this company.



http://billingsgazette.com/business/streetmail-finds-its-niche-with-subscribers/article_277c0f8c-409c-5e4c-b631-0a94e00ca111.html

http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/waterfront-media-creates-a-splash---new-revenue-stream-in-the-publishing-industry-58778647.html

http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108008089806963339
Why are they phasing out the original business? We suspect they hit a wall on growth
and discovered they could never leverage the expense base to reach consistent
profitability with the old model. Unfortunately they didn't foresee the changing market
place and didn't invest in the correct technology. This seems to be a recurring theme for
the company. Larger companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL) swooped in and ate their lunch with e-books. In our opinion, they are
currently facing a similar situation in selling digital advertising. Although they continue to
grow revenue and "adjusted EBITDA," actual sustainable net income profitability eludes
them.


AOL's Steve Case Joins The Fray:


In 2005 shortly after the Streetmail combination there was a new entry into the
healthcare space when Steve Case of AOL fame entered the digital healthcare
advertising market with his Revolution Health Group (RHG) and Revolutionhealth.com.
RHG was formed to compete with WebMD who had just completed their IPO at the time.


Mr. Case chaired the board and other high profile figures including Carly Fiorina, Colin
Powell, former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale, former Oxford Health Plans CEO Steve
Wiggins, and former Fannie Mae CEO Frank Raines were board members. At the time
RHG CEO John Pleasant said they were planning to "build the leading online resource
for healthcare, period." As the leader in the segment, clearly beating WBMD was the
intended target.


Fast forward to October 2006 when Waterfront Media launched Everydayhealth.com.
Like RHG, Everydayhealth.com was targeting the same category in healthcare where
WebMD already had a large lead, selling digital advertising. This is the same category
Bo Peabody said had "killed" his previous business, Streetmail.com. This was
essentially the beginning of EVDY's move from a subscription based content promoter
to a WebMD.com wannabe.

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2005/10/03/daily27.html
By 2008 Steve Case and his Revolution Health Group came to the realization that they
weren't going to be able to compete alone in digital advertising by competing with
competitors that already had a large lead and were consolidating advertising dollars.
RHG's traffic was falling behind and they were bleeding cash. In October of that year he
sold the ailing company to EVDY. It was rumored at the time that Case and friends had
dumped $200mil into RHG and that EVDY paid $100mil for it. According to TechCrunch
Revolution Health at one point had been valued at a half billion dollars but was
unprofitable on their $20-30mil in annual revenue.


EVDY and RHG believed that as a combined company they could surpass WBMD as
the largest healthcare related site on the Internet. According to ComScore in July 2008
WebMD was the #1 health site with 17.2mil unique visitors per month, Everyday Health
was #2 with 14.7mil and Revolution Health was #3 with 11.3mil. By combining they
would become #1 in the category with approximately 27mil unique visitors per month.


In a New York Times article regarding the combination Steve Case was quoted as
saying, "we think we have the wind at our back, and can pass them," referring to
WBMD. He went on to say that they could "really be the new leader in the category,
which is a hot category." Current EVDY CEO Ben Wolin was quoted as stating that prior
to the RHG acquisition in 2007 his company was profitable on $50mil in revenue and
that post acquisition in 2009 they planned to reach $100mil in revenue and again be
profitable.


Something Doesn't Add Up:


In 2010 EVDY made their first attempt at going public, which failed according to the
company due to weak market dynamics. In their 2010 S-1 filed for the IPO we discover
a bit more detail about the true metrics of the RHG deal and the state of EVDY's
business during the period mentioned by CEO Ben Wolin in the New York Times article.


As it turns out, they didn't pay $100mil for RHG but a meaningfully smaller $72.8mil.
Additionally, regarding 2007 EVDY's financials filed with the SEC, EVDY sales for 2007
were $47mil, which was fairly close to Mr. Wolin's claim of $50mil. What we found most
disturbing was his comments involving profitability for EVDY in 2007. In that year EVDY
reported a loss of $10.1 mil. Even when looking at EVDY's preferred metric for
evaluating their company, adjusted EBITDA, they still recorded a loss of $6.8mil in 2007.
We also find this in the 2010 S-1:



https://techcrunch.com/2008/10/03/revolution-health-gets-a-mercy-sale-turns-200-million-into-100-million/

http://ir.comscore.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=333307

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03deal.html?_r=1

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1358483/000095012310004443/y80435sv1.htm#302
We have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to incur
losses in the future.


We have accumulated significant losses since our inception. We recorded net losses
of $13.2 million and $20.5 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2008
and the nine months ended September 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, our
accumulated deficit was $59.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant
operating expenses and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to
achieve or maintain profitability. We may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability
on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.


This appears to significantly contradict the current CEO's comments to the New York
Times in 2008. That year losses increased to $13.2mil as disclosed in the S-1. The New
York Times article came out in October 2008. Is it possible the Times article got it
wrong? Perhaps he was misquoted when stating the company was profitable at the
time? That would appear unlikely.


We found a 2nd article from CBS MarketWatch in October 2008. In it CEO Ben Wolin
again is being interviewed regarding the RHG acquisition and he again states that they
would be profitable for 2008 and that combined with RHG he expects revenue to be
"well north of $100mil in 2009."


We feel the CEO should have been aware at the time that the company was in fact not
profitable, but highly unprofitable and his commentary at the time severely
contradicts SEC filings. His prediction of $100mil and profitability as a combined
company for 2009 fell short. Combined revenue was $90mil with a loss of $19mil. We
feel this is another red flag for the company.


Case & Friends Dump EVDY Stock:


As for Steve Case, at the time of the combination he joined EVDY's board. Mr. Case left
one year later and since they've gone public he has been selling EVDY stock. None of
the "rock star" board members of RHG are on EVDY's board.



http://www.cbsnews.com/news/interview-ben-wolin-ceo-waterfront-media-a-two-horse-race/

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1358483/000095012310078908/y80435a5sv1za.htm
Steve Case personally championed Revolution Health and was confident enough in the
idea to spend $100mil of his own money and nearly $198mil combined with Revolution,
LLC investors. Yet he sold the company for $72.8mil in Waterfront Media stock on the
hopes he might someday get his payday in an IPO. So how's that working out for him so
far?


Well, he's been dumping the stock at a significant loss to his original investment. In the
sale he received convertible preferred stock that converted to about 6mil shares of
common stock. Since going public, he has sold approximately 3.6mil shares for about
$14/share or $50mil. If he were to sell the remaining 2.4mil share position around the
same $14 level (assuming it ever gets there) Case and the investor group would be
cashing out of EVDY for about $84mil for a total loss of about $114mil.


Steve Case likely has a better understanding of the potential opportunities and
challenges a company like EVDY faces than the average investor. After all, RHG was a
very similar company that he founded, ran and then sold to EVDY. In our opinion it's also
unlikely he's blindly selling just to raise cash.


The EVDY shares owned by Case & friends are held by WF Holding Company, LLC
(WF as in Waterfront, we assume). David Golden, a member or EVDY's board is one of
the board members of WF Holding Company as well.


David Golden, a member of our board of directors, is one of eleven members of the
board of directors of WF Holding Company, LLC. No single member of the board of
directors of WF Holding Company, LLC has sole voting or investment power over the
shares of our common stock held by WF Holding Company, LLC. Revolution WF
Holdings LLC holds a controlling interest in WF Holding Company, LLC. Revolution
WF Holdings LLC is indirectly controlled by Stephen M. Case.


~EVDY Prospectus, 3/28/2014



http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/steve-case-launches-his-health-revolution
Mr. Golden is also a managing partner at Case's firm Revolution Ventures. As we
mentioned, Case has sold 3.6mil of the 6mil shares held by WF Holding Co. That leaves
the remaining 2.4mil shares hanging over investor's heads like the sword of Damocles
should the shares ever rise again. We feel this doesn't bode well for investors in EVDY.
If Case is willing to sell at a loss after all this time what does it say about EVDY's
prospects as a company? If he isn't confident in owning shares in this company why
should anyone else be confident?


Internal Struggles:


In the 3rd quarter of 2015 growth in the consumer portion of their business, which
represents about 60% of sales, went flat. The stock sold off hard as a result. The
company blamed their own sales execution and decided to reorganize the sales force
into three distinct categories: consumer, professional and payer/provider. Prior to this
point the sales force had little to no distinguishable categorical organization that we are
aware of. In the 4th quarter of 2015 they guided for mid-single-digit growth for the
consumer segment for 2016 with a return to "historical" growth rates in 2017. The
changes to the sales force were made by year-end and by Q1 of this year it appeared to
be paying off with a return to consumer growth.


Despite the improvements we remain extremely concerned on the consumer portion of
their business. Despite growth in the other 40% of their business, consumer remains the
majority of revenue. Consumer advertising revenue consists of not only consumer
packaged goods (CPG) and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs but also pharmaceutical ads.
Digital pharmaceutical ads remain the bread & butter of this company. The fact that
traction appears to be slowing in the category that represents the majority of revenue we
see as a major red flag.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/14/47406777-1471200839879983_origin.png
The sales force reorganization appears to be "righting the ship" for now but we remain
concerned for potential implications in the future. Currently the sales force employee
split is 40% consumer, 40% professional and 20% payer/provider. The fact that
consumer slowed to flat while professional and payer/provider grew means the easier
growth is in those latter two categories. Since sales teams are often driven by
commission packages, we feel this will ultimately lead to internal strife within the sales
team, as some members of the team will achieve strong growth while the majority in the
consumer category struggle to "hold the line." We would not be surprised to find many
leaving the company in the coming quarters. This in fact is an issue the company seems
to have repeatedly faced.


Comments from the website Glassdoor.com provide some insight into what employees
are thinking and most seem negative. The company has a rating of 2.7 out of 5. While a
potentially disgruntled employee isn't always the best source of insight to a company,
when you see the same comments repeated by many different individuals it begins to
have some weight.


Some of the consistent negative comments:


Turnover is extremely high


Middle and upper management don't seem to know what they're doing


Company focus is to hit short-term quarterly goals


The sales team is seen as superior to the rest of the employees, including tech


Lack of direction leads to layoffs


Expansion into new businesses tend to fail


Too many middle managers


Priorities are constantly changing every 6 months or so


Lower level employees don't feel respected or utilized


"Chaos is constant" as they burn out employees to hit numbers


Some of the consistent positive comments:



https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Everyday-Health-Reviews-E101724.htm
Unlimited paid time off, but many complained they were discouraging from using it


Free fruit and cereal


Good co-workers


Nice office, great location


What we found in the employee reviews aligned very closely with what we would expect
after researching the history of EVDY. The company seems to lack direction and is
constantly changing focus to a new line of business. This creates internal strife and
frustrated employees.


WebMD A Far Superior Option:


If you're interested in investing in digital advertising there are far better options for your
money than EVDY. Trends show that traffic and more importantly digital advertising
dollars are being consolidated to the bigger platforms like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)
and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) while smaller platforms like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) suffer.
These are long-term well-established trends that we feel are unlikely to change. We
have to look no further than TWTR's recent quarter for proof. The same is occurring
within digital advertising for healthcare. WebMD has emerged as the goliath in this
rather small category.


Truthfully, we would argue that in the long run WBMD is also unattractive at current
valuation because the larger players will continue to be a nuisance to growth for them as
Internet traffic likely further consolidates to the majors. We feel both of these companies
are better shorts than longs but between the two WBMD is the better option.


Before going further, let's take a moment here to differentiate between consumer and
professional (physician) traffic trends. For WBMD, MedScape is their professional site
representing 60% of advertising revenue according to their latest quarterly transcript.
This implies <40% of advertising revenue is from the consumer which is represented
primarily by WebMD.com traffic (60% professional/40% consumer). The exact opposite
ratios apply to EVDY (40%/60% consumer). This implies that relative to WBMD, it will be
harder for EVDY to grow organically if long-term industry trends hold on consumers and
there's no reason to believe that they won't.

The professional portion of their business we feel is better insulated because it's geared
toward physicians and provides a way for them to differentiate their product from the
general consumer population. Additionally as the leader in the category any erosion
should likely be slower for WebMD.com vs. smaller competition (i.e. EVDY).


All things being equal, EVDY is starting from a less attractive position than WBMD with
the majority of their advertising revenue coming from consumer, but all things are not
equal because in addition to the consumer trends WBMD has a substantial lead in
Internet traffic. In fact in WBMD's most recent quarter they stated that today, "WebMD
has approximately 55% more monthly visitors and over 3 times more page views than
the next largest competitor, it is also the reason WebMD continues to rank number one
in virtually all the 50 most important condition-suffering populations online."


We believe EVDY is in a desperate struggle to remain relevant in consumer with
Everydayhealth.com. This would explain why they have yet again changed their
business model by acquiring businesses like Doctor Directory and Tea Leaves that rely
less on consumer advertising. Today these are the businesses EVDY is focused on and
the divisions they talk about most. They want us to focus on growth in these newly
acquired businesses (this is not organic growth) and ignore the boring, low to no growth
consumer portion of their business that represents the majority of the company! Don't
look over here, look over there. This is yet another major red flag.


We believe that the attempt to diversify away from consumer advertising via acquisition
is acknowledgement that they no longer see a path to profitability for this business. As
Internet traffic further consolidates and advertising dollars follow, we believe only the top
player in specific industry segments (like healthcare) are likely to survive profitably long-
term. EVDY is not the top player.


Ten years ago when these trends weren't in place many believed there was room for
several players within any given segment but the data clearly shows that's simply not
the case. You don't need a Facebook and a MySpace. You don't need a Google and a
Yahoo. You don't need a WebMD and an Everyday Health.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/3997450-webmd-healths-wbmd-ceo-david-schlanger-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
If you think it can't get worse, you're wrong. What makes it worse is that in those other
examples they're competing for total worldwide digital ad spend in any and every
category. While Yahoo will likely never regain the crown, the market they compete in is
huge and it will take a very long time for them to disappear. EVDY and WBMD on the
other hand are competing for share in the tiny healthcare digital advertising space,
which represents only 2.8% of total digital ads spend. 2nd tier companies in small
categories are likely to die a quicker death. Healthcare is not expected to grow as a
percentage of total digital ads spend through at least 2019 according to eMarketer.


Traffic Trends Show WebMD.com Dominates Healthcare:


Recently Google changed their algorithm and WBMD admitted it is negatively impacting
traffic to their properties. If the consumer advertising environment for WBMD, the leader
in the segment, is likely to deteriorate, we feel a company like EVDY is in an even more
precarious position. EVDY often talks about how their traffic is growing on their three
flagship properties, but the growth is not very meaningful if your competitors are growing
faster. A better metric, and one that EVDY doesn't provide, would be traffic market share
trends. We believe WBMD has extended a large lead in traffic market share over the
past 3-4 years.


Internet traffic tracker comScore releases monthly data for the top 50 U.S. web
properties. WebMD.com is consistently ranked in the top 50 category for both mobile
and desktop traffic. EVDY does not make the top 50 in any category. That wasn't always
the case. As mentioned earlier, when EVDY acquired RHG in October 2008 it was clear
at that time that their goal was to surpass WBMD's dominance as the leading healthcare
Internet platform.


By combining EVDY took the lead with 25.8mil unique visitors per month compared to
WBMD at 19.6mil in October 2008. From late 2008 until July 2012 EVDY held the lead
in the healthcare category, at least in desktop. Then in August 2012 WBMD regained
the lead in desktop visitors and they never looked back. We suspect that during this
period while EVDY was in the lead on desktop traffic, WBMD was focusing on the future
of digital ad traffic in mobile. The comScore data makes the case for us.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3997450-webmd-healths-wbmd-ceo-david-schlanger-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

http://www.comscore.com/Products/Audience-Analytics/Media-Metrix-Multi-Platform

https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/10/will-webmd-lose-its-stranglehold-over-health-information/
Beginning in August of 2014 comScore began releasing top 50 traffic data including
mobile data. Prior to this point the only publicly available comScore traffic data for the
top 50 sites was for desktop only. WBMD has ranked in the top 50 for both desktop
and mobile data every month since comScore began releasing the data ranking at
worst 36th and at best 25th. Again, Everydayhealth.com has never once ranked in the
top 50 data when including mobile.


As you can see in the chart above, consistent with industry wide trends, desktop traffic is
slowing for both companies but WebMD.com has clearly taken a substantial lead. It is
worth noting that October 2014 is the last time Everydayhealth.com made the comScore
top 50 ranking with 23.4mil unique visitors. This is the reason why there are no red dots
beyond 2014. The trend line indicates they are currently probably closer to only 15mil
unique desktop visitors per month. Before acquiring RHG in 2008, desktop traffic was
around 15mil indicating they have completely round-tripped the desktop traffic gained
via acquisition of RHG. In our opinion this is evidence that RHG was another example of
a poor acquisition by EVDY.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/14/47406777-1471200979040128_origin.png
We include the chart above to provide a more complete picture of traffic trends. The blue
triangles represent mobile only traffic for WebMD.com. As you can see, mobile traffic
has surpassed desktop traffic by a large degree, essentially doubling it. To get the total
traffic figure you would have to add the two together. For example, in June 2016
WebMD.com's total unique visitor traffic per month was 74.5 mil. This data implies that
66% of WebMD.com's total traffic is now from mobile devices (this does not factor in
other sources of traffic for WBMD, namely MedScape).


Since mobile is growing and is the majority of traffic, it is clear that overall traffic for
WebMD.com continues despite the drop off in desktop traffic. If we had the data we
believe we would see a similar trend for Everydayhealth.com. Unfortunately comScore
only releases data for the top 50 web properties by traffic. Since Everydayhealth.com
does not make the top 50 any longer, we do not have the comparable data. The
important takeaway and the reason we provide these graphs is to show that although
traffic for both companies continues higher, Everydayhealth.com is no longer the leader
in this space and unlikely to regain the lead given the long-term industry trend toward
traffic consolidation.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/14/47406777-14712010592905452_origin.png
As Everydayhealth.com becomes a smaller percentage of traffic market share, they lose
relevance, and by extension will lose advertisers over time. We feel this is actually one
of the key reasons they keep having to change their business model to focus on the
latest acquisition to drive overall growth. We believe that in Q3 when EVDY stated the
consumer advertising portion of their business went flat, this was likely one of the
primary reasons. Although EVDY has regained some footing in consumer with a recent
reorganization of their sales force, we believe this issue will continue to rear its ugly
head in the future, specifically as they begin seeing tough compares to the sales force
changes made sometime early next year.


Let us be the first to point out that the above data is incomplete and only examines
Everydayhealth.com in comparison to WebMD.com. It does not take into consideration
other EVDY properties like Whattoexpect.com, Medpagetoday.com and others.
However, we feel this data is enough to show current trends in the industry and the
trend represents a significant overhang to future growth for EVDY. As we have already
stressed, 60% of their current advertising revenue comes from the consumer.
Everydayhealth.com is their primary flagship site (after all, it's the name of the company)
and is considered by the company to be a consumer site. By this we mean that the
majority of visitors to Everydayhealth.com are consumers, not physicians.


Everyday Health Stops Providing comScore Data:


It's telling that in EVDY's initial S-1 filed in January 2010 when they were leading
WBMD, there are references to comScore data showing they are number one in the
category.


"During 2009, the Everyday Health portfolio attracted an average of 25 million unique
visitors per month, according to comScore, Inc., a leading market research firm."
~EVDY S-1 January 22, 2010


They even provide a table…

This is the last time the company would provide comScore data on everydayhealth.com.
Why is that important? comScore is one of many companies that track Internet traffic but
they are considered the "gold standard" if you will, for advertising agencies. It's also the
source of traffic info that WBMD regularly references.


A Casual Relationship With The Truth:


It's not unexpected that a company would want to paint itself in the best light possible
but some do it more than others. What's disturbing is when the examples seem blaringly
obvious. We've noticed several examples of this with EVDY and this gives us further
pause. In our opinion this hurts management credibility and it becomes hard to know
what positive data is real and what is simply "spin."
Post their failed IPO attempt in 2010 they had to withdraw their registration request and
file a separate S-1 in 2014 on their 2nd attempt to go public. In the S-1 dated February
24th, 2014 when they had again relinquished the lead to WBMD there is no reference to
EVDY's unique visitors per month and no table either. The only reference they make to
comScore data is when they state that,


During 2013, on average, approximately 132 million unique visitors accessed health-
related websites per month in the U.S., an increase from approximately 94 million
on average in 2009, according to comScore.


It's interesting that they reference a 2009 comparison and not say, a year over year
comparison. As it turns out, in the original draft registration statement (DRS) filed July
31, 2013, which is before they knew what the full year figure for healthcare traffic would
be for 2013, they provide the 2012 traffic data. The DRS says that,


During 2012, on average, approximately 151 million unique visitors accessed health-
related websites per month in the U.S., according to comScore.


Some might overlook a detail like this as something insignificant. We feel it is anything
but. The filings clearly show that once EVDY had the 2013 comScore healthcare traffic
data they specifically chose to change their S-1 to compare that years data to the more
favorable data of 2009. We feel the only purpose to changing the draft is to put their
industry and by extension their company in a better light for the IPO.


The point of highlighting this issue goes beyond the IPO. We've already shown the
seemingly inconsistent comments of CEO Ben Wolin in the New York Times article. Now
they appear to have cherry-picked flattering data for their IPO. What the company
seems to be very consistent with is a long history of exaggerating the truth. This
continues to the present day.


In yet another example from this year's first quarter press release the company
highlights that adjusted EBITDA increased 625% on a year over year basis in Q1 2016.
These kind of eye-popping numbers will often catch the attention of retail investors
looking for growth in this low growth economy. While technically true, this kind of stat
can be deceptive without a frame of reference.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1358483/000093041314000808/c74554_s1.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1358483/000093041313004018/filename1.htm
Evaluating the details it's clear that highlighting this kind of growth is irresponsible at
best. Q1 adjusted EBITDA in 2016 was $2mil. In comparison to Q1 2015 this is up
625%....from $270k. This extremely low base, approaching zero means that practically
any year over year growth comparison would show "huge growth" in percentage terms.


When looking at absolute numbers adjusted EBITDA was up $1.7mil. This is a fairly
marginal amount even for many small-cap companies. Comparing this number to Q1 of
2014 it's actually down from $3.2mil. In that year adjusted EBITDA was up 1,838%
making a mere 625% improvement look downright pathetic in comparison (are you
getting an idea for how meaningless this number is?) It's also down from their
seasonally strong Q4 of 2015 of $26.1mil*. The fact that their adjusted EBITDA was up
$1.7mil was good, it's just not as good as they seem to be implying in our opinion. We
feel management is highly promotional and as a result any growth figures they reference
cannot be taken at face value.


[*Technically we could have said EVDY's Q1 adjusted EBITDA was down 92%
sequentially (as opposed to up 625% year over year) and if you didn't look close enough
you might think the company is going belly up. Instead we offered that Q4 is the
company's seasonally strong quarter and therefore isn't the best comparison. The
company could have provided a fairer comparison by highlighting absolute numbers
instead of a percentage increase. Instead they chose to highlight a bombastic 625%
increase. This is yet another red flag for EVDY investors.]


Everyday Health Goes to Hollywood:


In EVDY we find several examples of a company that doesn't seem to know who they
want to be. They continually morph from one concept to the next. When growth starts to
taper off, they tend to look for the next "big idea" to acquire instead of just focusing on
improving and refining the existing business. For EVDY, it seems the grass is always
greener on the other side of the fence.
Just when it looks like they finally decided who they want to be, they flip the script yet
again. In another example of bad ideas, in 2010 EVDY decided to dip their toe into the
television production game with Everyday Health Studios. Their first TV show was
Everyday Health TV and it lasted for 20 episodes. At the time CEO Wolin was quoted as
saying that he wanted EVDY to be "the ESPN of health." Of course the only problem
with this analogy is that no devoted enthusiasts follow healthcare the way they might
sports.


The company hired ABC news veteran Paul Slavin to run Everyday Health Studios.
They supposedly even built a studio to better "model a television network more so than
a traditional Internet company." Now they were really out of their wheelhouse. The
company teamed up with YouTube to create a channel called "Everyday Health TV:
Content to Change Your Life." It contained cooking shows like "Recipe Rehab" and other
health and fitness oriented content.


During this period EVDY acquired a web video production company called EQAL in
September 2012 (a mere four years ago). EQAL's claim to fame was a YouTube show
called Lonelygirl15 about a fictional teenage girl named Bree. In the show Bree, played
by Jessica Lee Rose has "trait positive blood that makes her the target of a dangerous
cult called the Order." CEO Wolin was quoted as saying that "EQAL are experts at
providing value around brand communities and celebrities." Now they're in the
"celebrities" business?


EQAL's other media content properties included JenniferLopez.com, Bethenny.com,
ElizabethBanks.com, ToriSpelling.com, LaurenConrad.com, Alicia Silverstone's
TheKindLife.com, DerekHough.com, ElleandBlair.com, MichellePhan.com,
WalkWithWalgreens.com, KRAFT's RealWomenofPhiladelphia.com and others. EQAL
also produced the content for a show called U Look Haute. EVDY supposedly paid at
least $12.5mil not including earnouts for EQAL.


Paul Slavin left EVDY in February 2015 and was replaced by current President Michael
du Toit. The most current YouTube video we can find for Everyday Health is 8 months
old. As far as we can tell, they don't discuss Everyday Health Studios on their quarterly
calls. It appears they may have quietly scuttled the division in what we consider to be
yet another waste of time and money.

To recap, EVDY started off as a diet and fitness web portal business. Then they
transitioned to a content subscription business for seemingly random categories like
dieting and faith based content. When that didn't work they decided to become WebMD
junior with a content subscription business on the side. Then they acquired RHG. In
December 2010 they continued to follow WBMD's lead by acquiring MedPage Today.
Next they attempted to enter television production as the ESPN of healthcare. Their
most recent acquisition is a SaaS company. When we say we feel the company lacks
direction and focus, this is why.


Other Major Concerns:


The pharmaceutical industry is facing a set of unique circumstances that could prove to
be major concerns. We discovered several issues investors in EVDY should be aware of
that could impact the company.


1. Orphan Drug Act


On EVDY quarterly calls they talk a lot about how orphan drugs are now about 50% of
all FDA drug approvals. EVDY sees this as good for their business because these drugs
tend to have very small target populations that are not well suited to television ads. This
should help grow the digital advertising market for orphan and specialty
pharmaceuticals. EVDY's acquisition of Cambridge BioMarketing, which focuses on
orphan and specialty drugs, fits this trend nicely. Yet orphan drugs have historically been
unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies to develop because the populations are so
small (<200k people). So why is this happening?


In 1983 the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) was passed to provide incentives and tax breaks to
encourage drug development for diseases affecting small populations. The ODA
provides incentives including subsidies, tax credits and 7 years of marketing exclusivity
for orphan drugs. The incentives are so beneficial to drug companies that they are
targeting FDA approval for specific niche orphan applications to get the benefits. Once
approved the drugs are subscribed off-label to a much broader population of patients,
turning the "orphan" drug into a blockbuster drug.
Recently this "gaming" of the system has come under increasing criticism. An article
from last November in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology discusses how drug
companies are submitting drugs to the FDA via ODA loopholes. Drugs that are
approved with "orphan" status tend to have extremely high prices. This is another major
area of concern given the political environment regarding drug pricing. The drug
companies justify the prices by claiming that in order to recoup their development costs
they have to charge high prices because the population base is so small. This argument
essentially gives them cover to charge extremely high prices for the drugs, which are
then prescribed off-label to larger patient populations. Also, once approved for orphan
status, many then quickly apply for the drug to treat larger populations. Of course this
wouldn't be positive for EVDY, because once the drugs can legally be marketed to larger
populations, TV ads become the preferred marketing method.


Dr. Martin Makary, one of the authors of the AJCO article said that "the abuse of the
ODA means higher drug prices for our patients" and that the abuse of the ODA "dilutes
its mission to patients with rare diseases." By focusing efforts on approving what are
really blockbuster drugs for orphan status, true orphan drugs get passed over.


For example, AstraZeneca's Crestor, a widely prescribed cholesterol drug, has orphan
drug status. A recent New York Times article describes how AstraZeneca attempted to
keep generics off the market with their claim to orphan drug status. Increasingly the FDA
is rejecting these claims by drug makers.


In addition the FDA is now receiving so many applications for orphan drug status that
they can't keep up. The pharmaceutical industry is essentially gumming up the system
and this hurts any drug that truly deserves orphan status. EVDY focuses on how the
situation benefits them in the short-term, but in the long-term it's becoming clear that the
ODA and orphan status approval system need revisions that will likely eventually lead to
fewer approvals for orphan status, not more. This is concerning for EVDY shareholders
because the company is heavily focusing their current and future growth efforts on this
specific category of drugs.


Additionally we feel EVDY is largely overstating the addressable market size of digital
ad spend for this category of drugs. A drug may have an "orphan" status but if the true
intent is to appeal to a much broader patient population, there is no reason to focus
advertising on a specific niche population via the Internet.

http://www.pharmtech.com/fda-adjusts-review-timeline-keep-orphan-drug-demand-0
Once the drug is approved for these other indications in addition to its orphan status,
there is no reason to assume they would not focus advertising efforts mainly on
television. Despite slowly shifting trends, TV remains the medium of choice for drug
companies according to Timothy Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern
University's Kellogg School of Management. Regarding direct-to-consumer
pharmaceutical ad spend he said that "people talk a lot about how television viewership
is eroding, and traditional media is fading, and that is all true. But the decline is very
slow, and so there are still big audiences. And if you're a pharma company, and you
want to reach a lot of people quickly…there's really no better place to go still than the
traditional networks." Of the approximately $5bil spent on direct-to-consumer drug ads,
about 60% is still via TV. Most of the rest is via magazines and newspapers. When it
comes to digital advertising, the pharmaceutical industry is slow to adopt new methods.


EVDY has put major emphasis on growing this portion of their business with pharma
companies. With drug pricing becoming a bigger political issue, changes to the orphan
drug category represents significant risk to their business model going forward.


2. Could Consumer Drug Ads Be Banned Entirely?


Did you know that besides the U.S., New Zealand is the only other country in the world
that allows direct-to-consumer drug ads? Drug ads represent about 70% of EVDY's
revenue and much of that is to consumers. Recently the American Medical
Association (AMA) recommended the banning of all forms of direct-to-consumer
drug advertising. AMA Chairperson Patrice A. Harris stated that the "vote in support of
an advertising ban reflects concerns among physicians about the negative impact of
commercially-driven promotions, and the role that marketing costs play in fueling
escalating drug prices. Direct-to-consumer advertising also inflates demand for new and
more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate." The AMA
doesn't have any authority to enforce such a ban, but their stance speaks volumes on
the state of the drug industry and advertisings role within it.



https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/09/drug-industry-advertising/
Recently Al Franken (D-Minn.) introduced legislation called the Protecting Americans
from Drug Marketing Act. The bill is an attempt to end the tax break that drug companies
take when advertising drugs to consumers. This also is considered an attempt to limit
drug advertising to consumers. Eliminating the tax benefit supposedly would reduce
drug ad spend by about 35%. That would be a major blow to a company like EVDY.
Similar to the AMA's argument, Franken thinks increased ad spending contributes to
high drug costs and pushes brand names when a cheaper generic may be available. If
you think he's only going after TV you'd be wrong. The Franken bill specifically mentions
dissemination on the Internet as one of the targeted areas.


Additionally Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) recently introduced legislation
calling for a three-year moratorium on new drug advertising. Hillary Clinton of course is
also well known for recently beating the war drum on drug pricing.


Meanwhile the advertising industry is largely ignoring the issue. They claim it is highly
unlikely that any legislation limiting drug advertising will be passed. They have seen
these attempts before and the attempts failed. In fact Mr. Franken had introduced the
exact same legislation to the Senate in 2009 and nothing ever came of it. Ultimately if
anything were to pass many believe it would be challenged in the courts under the First
Amendment and ultimately be prevented. The outcome of these issues is currently
unclear, but sometimes just the threat can cause the intended result. Either way, it's
something investors in EVDY should be aware of.


3. Mobile Ad Blocking and The Trend Back To TV


Before the days of DVR, television advertisers had a captured audience. If you wanted
to watch a show you had to sit through the commercials. Generally speaking consumers
don't like advertising and as technology has developed, it has provided them ways to
avoid it. Like the DVR that allows us to fast forward past commercials, mobile ad
blockers allow us to block ads while on a mobile browser.


In the U.S. mobile ad blockers are still not very widespread, but in emerging economies
many use them. In many emerging countries a persons cell phone is their primary path
to the Internet. Digital ads use data and slow the speed at which websites load. Digital
ad blockers have become very popular in these communities because they conserve
data and speed phone performance. 36% of smartphone users in the Asia-Pacific region
use ad blockers. Ad blocking is growing 90% annually.

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/business/international/smartphone-ad-blocking-software-mobile.html
In the U.S. the adoption has been slower but is expected to pick up. Concern is
increasing that as these tools become more widespread, digital advertising will suffer.
Current Internet trends are clearly showing that mobile has taken over as the most
popular way to access the Internet and that is also where the growth is. At the beginning
of 2016, 75% of EVDY's traffic was via mobile device. As ad blockers grow, this could
become a major issue for a company that depends in large part on digital advertising for
their existence.


Recently Facebook has become concerned enough with ad blockers that they are
implementing technologies to block the blockers on desktops. For now, they have
decided to leave mobile blockers alone, probably due to fear of user backlash on the
largest piece of their business. The issue of ad blockers is serious enough that it was
mentioned as a risk factor in their 10-K for the first time this year.


It's important to note that not all mobile advertising is via a mobile browser. Mobile
phone apps are also a major component. While apps appear to be mostly immune to
this issue for now, there are some ways to avoid even in-app advertising. A blocker by
Adguard supposedly blocks ads in both browsers and apps without having to root the
phone.


For EVDY we don't know what the revenue split is between mobile app and mobile
browser digital ads, so the potential impact is also unknown. Our takeaway is that
technology is allowing consumers to find new, creative and often free ways to avoid
advertisements of all kinds be it via app or browser. This sets up a technological arms
race between advertisers and consumers that makes consumers more difficult and
expensive to reach.

https://adguard.com/en/faq.html
EVDY and WBMD do have the benefit in healthcare of having a generally older
consumer base that they are marketing to, but that is also probably a major factor
working against them in trying to get drug companies to move advertising dollars
meaningfully away from television and print ads. Increasingly large advertisers are
coming to the realization that targeted digital ads aren't always very effective. Procter &
Gamble (NYSE:PG) has decided to limit the amount of targeted advertising spend with
Facebook and is cutting Internet advertising with platforms that don't reach a broad
enough customer base. Instead, they are going back towards dependable mass-market
media like TV. P&G is the largest advertiser in the world. Pharmaceutical companies
have been notoriously slow to adopt digital advertising. We feel this change in direction
by P&G will not go unnoticed by EVDY's clients.


Despite Growth, The Balance Sheet Continues to Weaken:


Since their IPO, EVDY has consistently produced strong growth for both revenue and
adjusted EBITDA. In 2014 revenue grew 18% with adjusted EBITDA growth of 66% and
in 2015 revenue grew 26% with adjusted EBITDA growth of 27%. Despite strong
growth, the stock has mostly trended lower since the IPO. Why?


To get a clearer picture we have to look under the hood. Despite the growth in the
topline and in adjusted EBITDA, the company has been unable to reach sustainable net
income profitability. After the IPO they quickly began acquiring companies, dramatically
increasing debt levels while depleting cash reserves. As you can see in the chart below,
as recently as Q3 of 2014 they had approximately $18mil in net cash and less than two
years later they have over $86mil in net debt. So while they are growing, that growth is
coming at a cost and it's unclear whether or not it will ultimately pay off for investors.


As an example, this year they are spending to grow their new payer/provider SaaS
platform Tea Leaves and while the platform is growing fast, it's not growing profitably.
The company has stated that this year it will be a drag on adjusted EBITDA. This is yet
another "pivot" for the company into a new area of business where they have little
experience. The company says they can continue to grow the business at a 50% clip for
several years and that because it's recurring revenue it will provide a stable base of
revenue. All of that may be true but does that mean it will also be profitable? If so,
when? Outside of the acquired management team, does the company have any
experience in building a SaaS business? What competitive threats might emerge?

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
In our opinion getting into this business provides more questions than answers. When a
company gets to far outside their wheelhouse, you have to question what's wrong with
their primary business? Why not focus on building out the digital ad space in consumer
and professional? Now they're a SaaS company focused on payer/providers? What's
going on here? Is there no growth to be had in the existing business? We can't help but
think that they know in the consumer portion of their digital advertising space in the long
run they're dead meat.


We believe the company has been acquiring growth to "paper over" the dramatic
slowdown they likely saw coming in their consumer business, which again is 60% of
revenue, for the reasons we've already discussed. Since going public EVDY has
acquired three companies: Doctor Directory, Cambridge BioMarketing and Tea Leaves.


Doctor Directory acquired November 19th 2014, a provider of pharma marketing
solutions focused on physicians, for $65mil in cash.


Cambridge BioMarketing acquired March 23, 2015, a provider of marketing and
communication solutions for the orphan and rare disease market, for $33mil and a
$5mil performance based earnout.


Tea Leaves acquired August 12th, 2015, a leading SaaS-based CRM for hospital
systems, for $30mil in cash and stock with a $20mil earnout.


If we assume all earnout targets are hit, the total acquisition cost for these three
companies is $153mil. This is where all their cash has gone, and they have to spend
more to build out these businesses, specifically Tea Leaves. If you're an investor in
EVDY, you better hope management knows what they're doing.

Core Primary Business in Decline:


So are they acquiring growth? They in fact said on their Q3 2015 earnings call that if
they had owned those companies as of January 1st, 2014 that their 2015 pro forma
revenue growth would have been approximately 6%. If the combined company would
have only grown 6% including acquisitions, we suspect the core organic growth is flat or
in decline. If these assumptions are correct than this would be a textbook definition of
growth via acquisition. In our experience, companies who can't grow organically and
need to acquire to achieve growth are generally not rewarded with increasing stock
prices.


We attempted to back into what core revenues would be for EVDY if they had not
acquired any company since the IPO. The table below is based on our estimates and is
not provided by EVDY. First we'll describe the assumptions that go into our estimates for
the three companies EVDY has acquired since going public.


Doctor Directory:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/14/47406777-14712013237767873_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3674186-everyday-healths-evdy-ceo-ben-wolin-q3-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
Starting with Doctor Directory, EVDY has provided that total professional revenues are
growing about 20% for the company. Doctor Directory is in the professional revenue
category for EVDY. We assume it is growing faster than the overall category at 30%. We
also assume that at the time of acquisition Doctor Directory revenue was around $20mil
per year and that it contributed $4mil to 2014 revenue (acquired Nov. 2014). Based on
these assumptions we attribute $34mil of 2016 total revenue to Doctor Directory.


Cambridge BioMarketing:


Regarding the specialty and orphan drug marketer Cambridge BioMarketing, we
assume this business can also grow at least 30% off a small base. When they were
acquired in March 2015 EVDY held a conference call and presented this slide show. In it
they state that Cambridge BioMarketing revenue in 2014 was $15.7mil. At the same
time the company raised their revenue guidance by $14mil to account for the nine
months of ownership for Cambridge BioMarketing in 2015. Based on this we assume
this was about a $20mil business in 2015 and growth of 30% gets us to $26mil for this
business in 2016.


Tea Leaves:


Finally, regarding Tea Leaves the company has said this business is growing at least 85-
90% in 2016. They began the year with $10mil in annual contract value (ACV). We
believe they will end the year with at least $17mil in ACV. Based on this we feel $14mil
in SaaS revenue is achievable in 2016. In addition the company has said in quarterly
calls that they also are seeing marketing spend of at least 50c per $1 in SaaS revenue
from this business. This adds another $7mil in advertising revenue we attribute to Tea
Leaves to get us to a contribution of $21mil in 2016.

Combining these three estimates for the acquired companies brings us to a total
revenue contribution of $81mil for 2016. We then take the midpoint of EVDY revenue
guidance of $252-$260mil to arrive at $256mil estimate for 2016 revenue. Backing out
the $81mil gets us to the core revenue of the business if they had not acquired any
company since going public. This reveals a 6% decline in the core revenue of the
business. This matches other trends we have discovered, such as the decline in mobile
revenue. It also matches comments the company has made publically that the
consumer business, their primary source of revenue, has slowed. Additionally total
revenue in their most recent quarter only grew 5% including acquisitions. EVDY has
now lapped all the acquisitions made since the IPO. If they make no further
acquisitions, we believe the decline in core revenue will begin to reveal itself as a
significant drag on revenue and earnings.

A Moving Target:



http://corporate.everydayhealth.com/investors-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Everyday-Health-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Financial-Results/default.aspx
When a company reports earnings, it is helpful if they provide company metrics that can
be compared on a quarterly & yearly "apples-to-apples" basis. Provided with this
information we are able to discern business trends. When a company does not provide
consistent data and tries to refocus attention to different metrics or different parts of the
business this can be a sign that something is very wrong. EVDY has only been a public
company for 2 ½ years so we find it extremely concerning that we can find multiple
examples of this activity over their 10 quarters as a public company. This is another red
flag for investors.


In our opinion EVDY is cherry-picking what data they disclose on a quarterly basis.
When certain data doesn't put the company in a positive light, they stop reporting it and
replace it with another metric that looks better. For example, in 2014 when they went
public the company began providing the following metrics on a quarterly basis:


Top 30 Advertiser Revenue Growth


Number of Advertisers Worked With


Average Revenue Per Advertiser


Growth in Average Revenue Per Advertiser


"Flagship" Property Visitor Growth


Total New Registrations


Beginning in Q1 2015 they begin to drop these very useful metrics that would provide
investors a way to evaluate trends within the business. The first to go is "growth in
average revenue per advertiser" in Q1 2015. By the 1st quarter of this year, we could
find no apples-to-apples data for any of these data points. We believe that as these
metrics have deteriorated, EVDY has stopped providing them.


For example, we were able to back into growth in average revenue per advertiser. By
Q2 2015 it was down 1%. Q3 2015 was down another 8%. By Q4 2015 they no longer
provide "average revenue per advertiser" so we are no longer able to back into the
growth. In that same quarter they also stop reporting "number of advertisers worked
with" and "flagship property visitor growth." By the first quarter 2016 they also drop "total
new registrations."

A Disturbing Trend:


This increasing lack of clarity into the business model is concerning, however we've
saved the best for last. Mobile has become a huge part of EVDY visitor traffic. At the
end of 2015 mobile accounted for 75% of EVDY's total traffic. Oddly, as mobile has
accounted for a larger part of EVDY's revenue, they've provided less detail about it. For
example, when EVDY first went public in 2014, the first 10-Q filing mentioned the word
"mobile" 32 times. In that year mobile revenue grew 82% to $67.7mil. Then in 2015
something happened. Mobile revenue growth hit a wall. In the most recent 10-Q, the
word "mobile" is only found 7 times.


As mobile advertising & sponsorship revenue growth was dramatically slowing in 2015,
the company decided to change what information they provided on a quarterly basis. In
Q1 2015 the company provided mobile revenue of $15.6mil. That was the last quarter
that a quarterly mobile revenue figure was provided. In Q2 they began providing year-to-
date mobile revenue. The 2015 10-K was the last time they broke out mobile revenue.
Mobile revenue in 2015 was $73.1mil, up only 8% in comparison to the 82% growth in
2014.


We backed into 2015 quarterly mobile revenue and it appears that in Q3 mobile
revenue growth went negative. We do not believe investors in EVDY are aware that
mobile revenue has been in decline and therefore this is not currently factored into
valuation. This is a major development for a digital advertising business being driven by
mobile traffic. Remember, as of the beginning of 2016, 75% of total traffic is now
mobile for EVDY. This development is extremely disturbing. This also helps explain
their recent acquisition spree beginning in November 2014. The acquisitions make it
difficult to see the negative underlying growth trends that we suspect are at the
heart of the core business. They also provide something else for management to
focus analyst/investor attention on. We do not find it surprising that they no longer
breakout mobile revenue given this development.

Extremely Poor "Earnings" Quality & High Valuation:


First let us point out the obvious. One of the reasons its so important to dig into the
financials of this company is because they do not have earnings in the traditional net
income sense that would allow us to compare a P/E multiple. It's not an uncommon
situation for a small company, but the fact that evaluating the company requires financial
engineering amounts to another red flag in our opinion.


It's becoming increasingly popular for companies to offer "alternative" non-GAAP
measures for evaluating financial performance. In some cases they are justified. In
others they are a convenient way for management to get investors to focus on
something other than the fact that they are not moving toward sustainable profitability.
We feel the latter case applies to EVDY.


EVDY mainly relies on growth in adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance.
They often guide that their long-term goal is for adjusted EBITDA to reach 30-35%.
Unfortunately because WBMD is the company they are usually compared to and WBMD
also relies on adjusted EBITDA this helps justify using this non-GAAP metric.
Management and even analysts often push the idea that adjusted EBITDA is a better
metric to evaluate a company because it more closely follows the operations and cash
flows of the company. Evaluating adjusted EBITDA can be a useful metric in
understanding a company's financials but it shouldn't be considered in isolation.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/8/14/47406777-14712014879115899_origin.png
When a company says they are providing adjusted EBITDA it's important to understand
exactly what has been "adjusted." Most companies when reporting adjusted EBITDA, in
addition to adding back depreciation and amortization (D&A), tax and interest expenses
also add back stock compensation expense and "other" one-time charges.


Management often justifies adding back stock comp expense by claiming it's a non-cash
expense and the "other" charges are added back because they are not considered to be
charges that would be incurred in the "normal" operation of the business.


There are two issues to consider on these points. First concerning stock comp expense
it's important to consider the alternative. When executives receive options or stock
grants in lieu of a cash payment they are still receiving compensation even if in a non-
cash form. If these executives were not receiving compensation in stock form they
would require compensation in cash form. Additionally, the shares dilute current
shareholders so there is a real cost to the investor even if it doesn't impact a company's
cash flow. This cost shouldn't simply be ignored when valuing a company. Additionally
the level of stock comp can vary to a large degree between companies. To simply ignore
the cost is giving management a pass and not holding them accountable to investors.


Second, regarding "other" one-time expenses. What is defined as a "one-time" expense
by management may be a fairly consistent expense that someone else may consider to
be a recurring operating expense. Again, the level and frequency of "one-time"
expenses must be considered. The larger the impact of stock comp expense and one-
time expenses to adjusted EBITDA, the more important it becomes to compare other
valuation metrics. To ignore these costs is like listening to a used car salesman telling
you not to worry about that clanking noise in the engine, and buying it hook, line, &
sinker. Caveat emptor.


Considering these issues, it shouldn't be surprising that when valuing EVDY on an
EV/Adjusted EBITDA basis it looks inexpensive. We calculated 2015 trailing valuation
for both EVDY and WBMD. EVDY had a 7.7x EV/Adj. EBITDA multiple compared to
11.2x for WBMD. If you stop your analysis right here you'd buy EVDY and sell WBMD,
but we dug further.
Before proceeding let's explain why we are evaluating trailing 2015 actuals vs. 2016
estimates. The company does provide revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. That
said, current adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 of $43.6-47.6mil is exactly the same
as the full-year guidance EVDY gave going into the end of 2015. Also, the $45.6mil that
they actually reported for 2015 is exactly the middle of EVDY's 2016 guidance. So on an
EV/Adjusted EBITDA basis the 2015 valuation is identical to 2016. Another reason we
decided to use 2015 actuals is because in addition to knowing what the adjusted
EBITDA is, we know what stock comp and one-time expenses for 2015 were as well.
For 2016 we only have Q1 & Q2.


So far in 2016 stock comp and one-time expenses are higher than 2015. If that trend
holds true full year, any valuation metric that includes those expenses makes EVDY
appear even more expensive than 2015, not less. Whether that will hold full year or not
is unclear. Therefore we chose to evaluate 2015 because we have the full years actual
data, which should be similar to 2016 at least on adjusted EBITDA and it appears the
stock comp and one-time expenses are representative if not favorable vs. 2016. In other
words, we believe the valuation results on 2016 estimates will likely be very similar to
2015 actuals. Since we have the results for 2015, it gives us more to work with.


Comparing the more traditional, straightforward EV/EBITDA for 2015 reveals that
EVDY's multiple is 23.1x compared to 14.2x for WBMD. Suddenly EVDY looks
extremely expensive on this theoretically similar metric. This is because EVDY has far
more stock comp and "one-time" expenses backed out of their adjusted EBITDA on a
percentage basis than WBMD does. No wonder they prefer to look at adjusted EBITDA.
We continued to dig.


We decided to back out "one-time" expenses for both companies to get an
understanding of how much, on a percentage basis these charges were contributing to
boosting each companies adjusted EBITDA. In 2015 EVDY had "one-time" charges of
$19.4mil representing 43% of their adjusted EBITDA. Over this same time period
WBMD had "one-time" charges of $6.2mil representing 3.2% of adjusted EBITDA. This
implies the quality of EVDY's adjusted EBITDA is far lower than WBMD's.
Next we considered if these "one-time" charges were truly one-time, or if they should be
considered a normal part of the company's operating expenses. If they are a recurring
expense and not one-time than we argue they should not be excluded from adjusted
EBITDA.


Again we compared EVDY to their closest comp, WBMD. We calculated what we have
dubbed the "one-time" ratio. The "one-time" ratio is the number of one-time charges
(excluding stock comp) divided by the number of quarters as a public company. We
consider a ratio of <25% to be truly one-time in nature and a ratio of >50% a recurring
expense that should not be considered a "one-time" expense. Essentially what this ratio
says is that if you have more than two quarters per year, every year with a "one-time"
expense than in our opinion those charges aren't really one-time and should be
considered normal operating expenses.


We found that in EVDY's 10 quarters as a public company they have incurred 17 "one-
time" charges for a "one-time" ratio of 170%. This compares to WBMD's "one-time"
ratio of 30% over the same time frame. Again, we believe anything over 50% shows that
a company is recording "one-time" expenses so frequently that they should not be
considered one-time in nature but instead should be considered regular recurring
operating expenses. Therefore these expenses should not be backed out of adjusted
EBITDA when evaluating EVDY. EVDY regularly backs these expenses out of adjusted
EBITDA. We conclude the quality of this "earnings" metric is extremely low and should
not be relied upon in valuing the company in our opinion.


We also considered the value of total one-time charges over that same time frame and
calculated what percentage of enterprise value they represent. The one-time
charges/EV was 9.3% for EVDY compared to .28% for WBMD. Another way to look at
this is that EVDY's one-time charges/EV are 33x higher than WBMD. Again, this shows
that the quality of EVDY's earnings is extremely poor in comparison to WBMD in our
opinion.
We feel the best metric for evaluating EVDY would be an EV/EBIT analysis. We like this
metric because we feel it better represents a picture of the true operations of the
business while still holding them accountable for stock comp expense. Unfortunately,
EVDY didn't have any operating income in 2015 for us to compare, so we had to use
adjusted EBIT. Frankly we're running out of ways to fairly assess the value of this
company (another red flag).


For our adjusted EBIT we add back "one-time" expenses but we don't add back stock
comp. Why? We feel it's the fairest compromise we can make in valuing the company
while providing a positive number to evaluate. By excluding one-time charges we give
the company the (seemingly undeserved) benefit of the doubt that in the long run their
"one-time" charges are truly one-time in nature. At the same time we hold them
accountable for stock comp expense. This seems like a fair compromise. While the one-
time charges may subside over time, the stock comp expense is likely to be a consistent
recurring expense and we do not feel they should be ignored when valuing a company.


EVDY's EV/Adj. EBIT was 24.7x compared to 16.8x for WBMD. Our conclusion is
that both of these companies are extremely expensive at current multiples. We consider
fair value for EV/EBIT multiples to be around 13-14x. It should be lower than a P/E, but
higher than an EV/EBITDA multiple. Although they are both expensive, EVDY is
substantially more expensive than WBMD. This would never be apparent if one simply
looked at EVDY's adjusted EBITDA. Despite being more expensive, EVDY's earnings
quality appears to be far inferior. Additionally WBMD is in a far superior position within
the market place as we described earlier. Based on our analysis investors are paying a
higher valuation for a far lower quality company in our opinion. Lastly, while EVDY is
guiding to zero adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016, WBMD is guiding to 16-20% adjusted
EBITDA growth. We feel an appropriate valuation for EVDY would be 13.5x
EV/Adjusted EBIT, or $3.20 per share. Therefore we see approximately 60%
downside to EVDY (see table).

Conclusion:


We have discovered several red flags that we feel should give investors in EVDY
serious concern. The company appears to be struggling to find itself as they attempt to
acquire their way to growth and profitability. Over the course of fourteen years this
strategy has yet to pay off. There is little reason to believe that it will finally pay off now.
As the company has acquired other companies, they have depleted cash and increased
debt, weakening the balance sheet. While acquisitions initially provide growth, if the
growth is not sustainable and the core business is in decline, which we believe it is, this
sets the company up for difficult revenue and profitability comparisons in the future. The
result is a company and management team that is on a "hamster wheel" of growth. The
company grows via acquisitions (runs faster) while never really getting anywhere
(sustainable profitability). Long-term we believe this will end badly for EVDY investors.


Several industry trends will likely impact their ability to grow, not the least of which is a
well-established industry trend toward traffic and ad dollar consolidation to the very top
Internet platforms. Since EVDY is not a top Internet platform and is not a top platform
even in the small healthcare niche, they are at serious risk of becoming irrelevant to
advertisers over time. This trend appears to already be significantly impacting their
business. Additionally, because the majority (60%) of their business remains tied to
consumers, which we consider the most vulnerable portion of digital advertising to
competition, they are at a significant disadvantage to WBMD, which has considerably
smaller exposure to consumers (40%).

Traffic trends continue to show that WBMD is dominating the category by a large
margin. As digital advertising continues to move to mobile devices, we believe WBMD's
domination will increase. As evidence we point to EVDY's recent decline in mobile
revenue and their admitted slowing in the consumer portion of their business. Other
potential risks include industry abuse of the Orphan Drug Act, a potential outright ban on
drug advertising and the impact of ad blocking software. These risks do not appear to be
fully reflected in current valuation.


Meanwhile, a highly promotional management team presents an ever-moving target of
business metrics that make it difficult to evaluate underlying business trends. Ultimately
we believe core organic revenue is in decline and will eventually be revealed in quarterly
results with negative consequences to shareholders. Earnings quality is extremely low
due to the high frequency and amount of one-time expenses and stock based
compensation. Not surprisingly, management prefers investors evaluate the business
using "adjusted EBITDA" which excludes these expenses. Peers including WBMD also
use this valuation metric. However, based on our evaluation we feel valuing EVDY on
"adjusted EBITDA" is completely inappropriate given the degree to which this one metric
skews results when compared with other valuation techniques as outlined above.
