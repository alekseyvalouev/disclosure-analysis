Odyssey Jettisons Lottery Ticket Upside With New HMS Victory Deal
Oct. 27, 2014 12:36 PM ET76 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


New HMS Victory deal with the MHF and UK MOD conforms to the UNESCO
CPUCH Annex which prohibits commercial sale of recovered artifacts and requires
the collection kept intact.


Wessex Archeology report that it is “highly unlikely” that there is gold; speculation of
“secret undocumented gold” based on a single unsourced Dutch newspaper
clipping.


Soonest excavation could begin is 3-5 months, still could be derailed: MMO may not
approve; true Balchen descendants may demand judicial inquiry; OMEX cash
balance perilously low.


Former CEO’s GALT Resources still has an override claim for 50% of proceeds to
OMEX up to $15mm and a 7% royalty thereafter.


New fee-for-service model and no "lottery ticket" upside highlights unviability of
current business model with high debt load and corporate overhead.


We were surprised for a number of reasons to see Odyssey Marine Exploration
(NASDAQ:OMEX)'s announcement Friday about their planned go-ahead on the HMS
Victory. Among other things, it seemed to be inconsistent with the stated change in
strategy to focus on more "singles and doubles" rather than the homerun-or-nothing
strategy that resulted in disasters such as the "Black Swan" case where after years of
legal wrangling, they had to pay Spain's legal fees and lost all their treasure.


We did take advantage of the share price increase to increase our short position as there
is a major misunderstanding about what this new deal means. We question how it's
possible for someone to write and publish a 9,000+ word article hours after a company PR
without advance knowledge.

The full announcement from the UK can be found here.


Most notably, the announcement is clear that MHF and OMEX have an arrangement to
move forward that conforms with the UNESCO Annex.


The UK Government announcement states that the Maritime Heritage Foundation has
adopted:


1. The Annex to the UNESCO Convention 2001


2. The Museums Association's Code of Ethics


3. The government's heritage policy (including the UNESCO Annex and Key Management
Principles)


More on how these restrictions impact the project economics and viability below.


Hurdle 1: UK Marine Management Organization


The UK MMO has yet to approve the project. They must grant a license to move forward
after an Environmental Impact Assessment is filed publicly with the project plan. Our
understanding is this process takes on average 3 months although complex applications
may take longer, during which there is a period where interested parties and the public
can offer scrutiny and comment which the MMO must take into consideration.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2600675-odyssey-jettisons-lottery-ticket-upside-with-new-hms-victory-deal 3/37


The Public Register is available online and as of this writing neither OMEX nor MHF
appear to have filed a plan. This would not normally be a concern for a project like this.
However, as of November 2013, according to a FOIA request, the MMO was investigating
OMEX for potential charges for violating licensing requirements. We have submitted an
update request to determine if this investigation is ongoing.


Hurdle 2: A cash bond or equivalent must be posted prior to commencing the work
so it can be completed


According to the UNESCO CPUCH Annex section 18, there must be a bond posted for the
full cost of the salvage before work can even start. If we estimate a full recovery would
cost $20-30mm and just this first "at risk surface items" piece of the project would cost
$3mm, how would OMEX be able to fund this? We estimate OMEX's maximum possible
cash balance will be approximately $3mm as of the end of this month unless they have
been able to borrow more on the as yet undisclosed "Marketing agreement loan".


Cash estimate end of June 30 (10Q): $5.7mm - 4 mos * $2-3mm cash burn/mo + $5mm
loan (closed in Aug) = between $2.7mm and -$1.3mm as of Oct 31.


The weather is rough at the HMS Victory site until late March in 4-5 months and the cash
burn between now and then would overwhelm even the most optimistic liquidity scenarios
posited without a substantially dilutive equity raise.


Hurdle 3: Former CEO's Galt Resources still has a large override on proceeds


"Galt will also receive 50% of Odyssey's net proceeds, if any, on the HMS Victory project
until Galt receives two times its initial investment and thereafter will receive 7.5125% of
Odyssey's net proceeds from the HMS Victory project." "Galt will receive 7.5125% of net
proceeds from the HMS Victory project after they recoup their investment of $3,756,250
plus three times the investment." (OMEX 2013 10-K)


Essentially it looks like Galt gets 50% of any net proceeds to OMEX until they recoup
$15mm and then a 7.5125% royalty on anything in excess of that.


Hurdle 4: Will the Actual Descendants of Lord Admiral Balchen demand a judicial
review and hold up the process?


The representatives have made the following statement via email to the media which was
forwarded to us. They also have a website.

As the only direct descendants of Admiral Balchen of HMS Victory we feel the same
sense of duty towards his crew he would have felt. We are disappointed, but not
surpised given Lord Lingfield's connections to the top of the Conservative Party, that
the Government has chosen to allow a company, Odyssey Marine Exploration, which
was condemned in a US Court for acting "contrary to Law" on a similar historic
warship, to salvage the grave of our ancestor and his 1100 crew.


As part of the consultation which must come before any work we will insist that the
work is supervised by independent archaeologists from English Heritage to ensure
the work is done appropriately and with due respect to the site as a memorial and
grave.


In the meantime there are still many questions to be asked about today's decision
such as, is it appropriate that the same consultant, Dr Sean Kingsley of Wreckwatch
International, acts for both Odyssey Marine Exploration and the Maritime Heritage
Foundation?


This was disclosed in the UK Parliament in February 2014 [our italics].

(end quote)


BIG Hurdle 1: The agreement with MHF must have changed, the old one did not
conform - OMEX SEC filings are consistent with this.


The following is the actual language regarding the HMS Victory contract that OMEX has
used in their press releases and SEC filings. The original 2012 press release and
corresponding 10-K indicated a "% of treasure" potential payment which is what is being
repeated now as a basis for calculating 'lottery ticket' upside. However, this type of
contract does not conform with the UNESCO Annex - which UNTIL NOW OMEX/MHF had
not formally agreed to conform to. Note the language changes in the SEC filing 10-K filed
March 2014 that appears to indicate that there is NO LONGER a "% of treasure" contract,
as has been speculated.


Feb 2, 2012 Odyssey Marine Exploration Executes Agreement with Maritime
Heritage Foundation

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2600675-odyssey-jettisons-lottery-ticket-upside-with-new-hms-victory-deal 6/37


The relevant language to which some have speculated that, if there is a large
amount of treasure found then OMEX could get a large percentage of this:


The agreement calls for Odyssey's project costs to be reimbursed and for Odyssey
to be paid a percentage of the recovered artifacts' fair value. The preferred option is
for Odyssey to be compensated in cash. However, if the Foundation determines,
based on the principles adopted for its own collection management and curation
policy, that it is in its best interest to de-accession certain artifacts, the Foundation
may choose to compensate Odyssey with artifacts in lieu of cash.


§ Odyssey will receive the equivalent of 80% of the fair value of artifacts which were
primarily used in trade or commerce or were private property and bear no direct
connection to the construction, navigation, defense or crew of the ship, such as
coins or other cargo.


§ Odyssey will receive the equivalent of 50% of the fair value of all other objects
typically associated with the construction, crewing and sailing of ships including, but
not limited to, the ship's hull, fittings, fasteners, construction elements, clothing,
organic remains, foodstuffs, cooking utensils, pottery, weapons, ammunition, ground
tackle and navigational equipment.


§ For any private property including coins or other cargo administered through the
Receiver of Wreck, the Foundation has agreed that Odyssey shall receive 80% of
the value.


March 2013: Section on Page 5 of OMEX 2012 SEC 10-K Filing


The Foundation has contracted with Odyssey to provide a full range of
archaeological, recovery, conservation and other services.


Pursuant to an agreement with the Foundation, Odyssey has produced an extensive
project design for the archaeological excavation of the site, including a complete
plan for recording, documentation, conservation, publication and public education.
The agreement calls for Odyssey's project costs to be reimbursed and for Odyssey
to be paid a percentage of the recovered artifacts' fair value. The preferred option is
for Odyssey to be compensated in cash.


*This language was brought to our attention by numerous archaeologists who highlighted
the UNESCO CPUCH Annex, to which the UK is a signatory to.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2600675-odyssey-jettisons-lottery-ticket-upside-with-new-hms-victory-deal 7/37


The Annex clearly states that:


1) the site is to be considered as one indivisible unit, there is no recognized legal
language such as "trade goods" for artifacts to be judged non-archaeological in nature


2) recovered artifacts cannot be sold commercially


March 2014: The italicized paragraph above was deleted in the OMEX 2013 SEC 10-K
filing (section now on page 6).


October 24, 2014: OMEX HMS Victory Press release does not mention any agreement
with the MHF regarding percentage of artifacts' fair value and reiterates, "All recovered
artifacts will be declared to the Receiver of Wreck in accordance with UK legislation."


Specifically the Annex language that is relevant for this project:


Rule 2. The commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage for trade or
speculation or its irretrievable dispersal is fundamentally incompatible with the
protection and proper management of underwater cultural heritage. Underwater
cultural heritage shall not be traded, sold, bought or bartered as commercial goods.


Rule 18. The project design shall demonstrate an ability, such as by securing a
bond, to fund the project through to completion.


Rule 33. The project archives, including any underwater cultural heritage removed
and a copy of all supporting documentation shall, as far as possible, be kept
together and intact as a collection in a manner that is available for professional and
public access as well as for the curation of the archives.


The Museums Association Code of Ethics is extremely strict on the sale of material:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2600675-odyssey-jettisons-lottery-ticket-upside-with-new-hms-victory-deal 8/37


In 2007 the Museums Association amended its code of ethics to accept financially
motivated disposal in exceptional circumstances, when it can be demonstrated that
all of the following factors have been satisfied:


· it will significantly improve the long-term public benefit derived from the remaining
collection


· it is not to generate short-term revenue (for example to meet a budget deficit)


· it is as a last resort after other sources of funding have been thoroughly explored


· extensive prior consultation with sector bodies has been undertaken


· the item under consideration lies outside the museum's established core collection
as defined in the collections policy.


In addition, the code requires museums to ring fence any money raised as a result of
disposal through sale solely and directly for the benefit of the museum's collection.


Money raised must be restricted to the long-term sustainability, use and
development of the collection.


We assess proposed financially motivated disposals on a case-by-case basis
against the criteria in the Code of Ethics.

HURDLE: It is "highly unlikely" that gold even exists at the site according to
scientific research


We will not rehash all of the circuitous and circumstantial arguments made by certain
holders of how there could be a large amount of gold at the site of the Victory. In fact
OMEX has never claimed in any SEC document that there is likely to be gold treasure
down there. Our Summary Interpretation of the Facts:


· A thorough study conducted by Wessex Archaology on numerous sources concluded
that is "highly unlikely" that there is gold specie or bullion.


· Most of the argument for gold being aboard is highly circumstantial: it was a ship, ships
sometimes carry gold, there was world trade at the time.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2600675-odyssey-jettisons-lottery-ticket-upside-with-new-hms-victory-deal 9/37


· The only specific piece of evidence highlighted is a quote from a Dutch newspaper (The
ship was traveling from Portugal to the UK?) that references UK Pounds rather than Dutch
currency which seems odd.


· OMEX failed to provide the actual source of this quote to the Wessex study or to anyone
else to our knowledge so its quality cannot be ascertained. Neither would OMEX release
or discuss any other "research" regarding a bullion cargo which they claimed to possess
with the Wessex Archaeology Authors. However OMEX did admit they had found no
evidence that the Victory called at Lisbon on its return voyage. [Wessex Archaeology Desk
Top Study p32 5.5.42]


It is also the case that the precise way HMS Victory broke up and sank is currently
unknown. Even if bullion or valuables were present on board the ship, they still may
not be present on the current wreck site.


In order to believe there is substantial gold down there, you would have to believe that:


1) A 74-year-old Admiral Balchen would have taken aboard undocumented gold to earn a
personal transport fee


2) That a huge amount of gold could simply disappear and not leave any documented
trace with insurance records or shipping records


This is reminiscent of the numerous "Secret Gold" stories that have been hyped in the
past including the most recent "Secret Army Gold" nonsense in the SSCA project that has
of course not turned up.


No "secret gold" stories ever work out, these things have records and don't
disappear. "Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."


Best case IF there is treasure and other hurdles are overcome: A lengthy court
battle like the "Black Swan"?


We expect that some motivated parties would have investors believe that:


- despite all the clear language both in the Museum Code and the UNESCO Annex;


- and despite the fact that OMEX's 10K appears to indicate that the contract regarding "%
of treasure" has been changed from 2012->2013

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2600675-odyssey-jettisons-lottery-ticket-upside-with-new-hms-victory-deal 10/37


-That somehow OMEX will still be able to collect some large % of the gold treasure value
(assuming it's there - which there is no scientific evidence of...) because perhaps only
"cultural items" will be considered part of the pact and OMEX will be able to get the 'side
items' of gold to sell.


To be perfectly clear: This is without legal precedent and contrary to the current rules.
Rules can always change but not quickly and there is no way this could happen without
challenge. Will it turn out as bad as the "Black Swan" case with Spain? This is unknown of
course but given the involvement of numerous interested parties in the UK it will not be
simple despite assertions. Further - OMEX's own SEC filings (above) are consistent with
the fact that there is no longer even an agreement relating to "% of treasure" but rather
just a fee-for-service / day-rate model.


OMEX claimed they are going to shift towards new projects where the legal ownership is
clear up front: and this is an example of that IF there is no "% of treasure" compensation
but rather only a day rate / fee-for-service model which is all we believe OMEX is even
attempting to do now. Even in what seemed to be simple cases like the SSCA, it is STILL
under appeal as of this writing and OMEX has received $0 from the Receiver and as far
as we can tell has no timetable to receive any until the appeals are resolved.


Likely project economics most likely to produce more losses, highlight unviability
of business model with current corporate overhead and debt load


Estimating the potential project economics based on facts gets us to the chart below.
OMEX received $250k for salvaging 2 cannon ($125k each) when they first found the
ship. If there are a maximum 98 more cannon to save and there is no bulk discount for the
receiver of wreck then there could be as much as $12.25mm revenue - 50% of which goes
to Galt and then the rest (and more) go to expenses and corporate overhead.

Comments (76)


We believe that OMEX is trying to use this project as a "prestige project" in order to
generate more fee-for-service business from other National governments. This is fine and
if done in compliance with all the relevant UNESCO conventions can be a win-win for all
involved. However, there is NO "lottery ticket" upside - these treasures belong to the
public and there are numerous contractors able to salvage them for a fee-for-service
model that OMEX appears to be transitioning to. However, such a business model does
not justify the extravagant corporate overhead of $1mm/month+ that OMEX burns.


We respect the changes that new CEO Mark Gordon is doing and appreciate the
significant toning down of hype in the press releases. There is still a long way to go
towards shareholder transparency but unfortunately these new facts highlight that the
enterprise is worth less than the current debt load. Paying a $100mm valuation for a small,
relatively low margin salvage business is not economic for shareholders.

What's the matter? Getting nervous in your short position? I sure wouldn't blame you. Nice gain today on strong
volume probably from more intelligent shorts beginning to cover. You have been wrong from the start so I don't

CAUTION READERS: The above article is premised upon the fact that the UK is a signatory to the UNESCO
CPUCH Annex. The author argues that because the UK is a signatory to the Annex, OMEX is not allowed to
earn a percentage on the gold found in the recovery operation. While this is untrue, as the Annex does allow
for commercial sale under certain circumstances, the more important point is that the UK is NOT a signatory
to the UNESCO Annex.


Though the author claims that "it is a fact" that the UK is a signatory, he has not been able to provide any
proof of this "fact." This is because proof of this fact does not exist.


According to the UK's Ministry of Defence "Though NOT CURRENTLY A SIGNATORY to the UNESCO
Convention, the UK Government has adopted the principles set out in its Annex (reproduced at Appendix C)
as best practice in the ARCHAEOLOGICAL and CULTURAL MANAGEMENT of underwater sites and
artefacts. (my caps)


Thus, according to the Ministry of Defence, Odyssey would be expected to adopt best practices as far as the
archaeological and cultural management of the wreck site, in accordance with the UNESCO Annex. To
suggest that terms of Odyssey's commercial arrangement with MHF are subject to the Annex appears to be
false.


30 Oct 2014, 11:37 AM


Green River Asset, Contributor
The premise of your paper is faulty and misleading. You have neglected to mention a key portion of the UNESCO
CPUCH which states:


This Rule cannot be interpreted as preventing:


(a) the provision of professional archaeological services or necessary services  
incidental thereto whose nature and purpose are in full conformity with this  
Convention and are subject to the authorization of the competent authorities;


(b) the deposition of underwater cultural heritage, recovered in the course of a  
research project in conformity with this Convention, provided such deposition does not prejudice the scientific or
cultural interest or integrity of the recovered material or result in its irretrievable dispersal; is in accordance with the
provisions of Rules 33 and 34; and is subject to the authorization of the competent authorities.


It is clear that selling of trade artifacts (coins) would be allowed under part b of the Convention.


You have zero idea whether or not OMEX's contract with the MHF has changed. You are grasping at straws.


As for objections from Temple West, the deal is done. The MOD has made its decision and that's not going to change.
BTW, how can Temple West claim to represent interests of all of Balchin's descendants? There are likely thousands

"We question how it's possible for someone to write and publish a 9,000+ word article hours after a company
PR without advance knowledge."


I'm not quite sure why you would question this. You were also privy to the news that OMEX was likely to get
approval on the Victory. You just decided to ignore it. This is something that management has been very vocal
about for the last six months (and longer) in public forums.


Please be aware of the fact that I also have a long paper written on the Oceanica monetization (which
management has publicly alluded to several times) which is just about ready to go. I am waiting for the
announcement to fill in details with respect to the investor, format, valuation, etc.

Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  GR, I think ironically the attention you have brought to this project serves to make it even
more impossible than it might have been had it slipped under the radar. The concept that you highlighted that
they would need to damage the "at risk surface items" to create the next layer of "at risk" items for one, this
UNESCO interpretation for another..


1. The provision of services for profit does not have to be financed by the sale of artifacts. eg: I offer to clean
your pool and retrieve your lost signet ring from the bottom. You say how much? I say a price based on cost
plus my mark up for profit. We agree. I do the work and get paid by you. Neither I nor you have to sell the
ring.


2. You do not take into account the other documents cited, including the Museums Association Code. Among
other stipulations this prevents the sale of objects to cover a short term costs.


3. If OMEX tried to claim salvor in possession of non-Crown items both OMEX and MHF would almost
certainly find themselves injuncted and in Court. For example- how do you know that the gold coins found are
not from a Royal Navy pay chest [there is no evidence for any other money on board and it would clearly be a
breach of the Government's policy under which permission was granted]. Black Swan part deux!


27 Oct 2014, 02:24 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
I disagree, but time will tell. The Museum's Association Code would apply to accessioned items, not personal
property. If the government thought that it had a Royal Navy pay chest on board full of coins, it never said so.
There is plenty of evidence for a commercial cargo on board as outlined in my note (perhaps you missed it?).
Note that historic shipwreck salvage awards have generally ranged between 90 and 100% to salvors, so even
in the unlikely event that claims are made, OMEX would retain most of the economics.

You have nothing definitive to say, you aim to cast doubt by hinting at remote possibilities. You've taught the
market to distrust your analysis by calling wolf many times with claims of insolvency, claims of imminent
bankruptcy, claims that the Central America would yield little or no gold, that the CA work was unprofitable,
that 18% phosphate is waste clay, that phosphate has never been mined underwater, that the company would
never be awarded the Victory. I could go on for days citing your inaccurate work, but I'm as tired of it as
everyone else, so I'll stop.

Your argument fails on several fronts. The agreement does not differentiate in regard to what was transferred
or not. The over-arching agreement is for the management of the SITE, regardless of sovereign or private.


Everything recovered will be turned over to the ROW, everything. Should items of personal effects show up,
the ROW will determine ownership. As noted, Balchins heirs and the collective group of sailor's heirs are a
very vocal group.


While UNESCO veils at the ability to sell artifacts, the UK governments version does not. The UK is not a
signatory to the convention, but in reality, their version is much stronger.


You are making up terminology such as trade goods (coins)


This is what the MHF project plan states:


"Treatment of Recoveries 
14. Archaeological material recovered from the wreck site of Victory 1744 under the authorization of the
Maritime Heritage Foundation, and the associated archive including site plans, drawings and photographs,
will form the 'Victory 1744 Collection' and will be subject to the following conditions:


15. In managing the Collection, the MHF will abide by the Museums Association's Code of Ethics for
Museums (2008).


16. All such recovered archaeological material and its associated archive should remain together as a single
assemblage whenever possible.


17. The Collection will be managed in line with the archaeological principles of the UNESCO Convention on
the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage, including Rule 2 to the Annex.


18. Where the disposal of any material from the Collection is proposed, the archaeological principles of the
annex to the UNESCO Convention and the Museums Association's Code of Ethics will be applied.


19. Any decision to dispose of archaeological material from the Collection by the Maritime Heritage
Foundation will not be made without full consideration of the merits of the case, taking into consideration
appropriate advice from the Advisory Group and requiring the written consent of the Secretary of State for
Defence.


20. In the exceptional circumstances where consent is given to the disposal of archaeological material from
the Collection, it shall normally be limited to the transfer of such material to an accredited museum or a body
registered as a charity in England and Wales or Scotland, rather than to private individuals or organisations."

It does not differentiate between the sovereign and personal cargo, but treats the wrecksite as its entirety. I
think that any attempt by Odyssey to circumvent the wording and spirit of the agreement will not be looked
favorably upon by the UK Government. (although given your posts, and the obvious connection, I expect
them to try, unfortunately) 


30 Oct 2014, 04:55 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
It is not my wording, my friend. It is the wording of the Project Design Non-Technical Study that MHF prepared
for the Ministry of Defence. You can find said document here http://bit.ly/1pHCWkc .


In that document you will note the following statement: "the Secretary of State for Defence transferred to the
Maritime Heritage Foundation:  
a) "every part of the said vessel; and  
b) all that is connected with her which is situated in the immediate vicinity of where she is lying (save insofar
of personal property not belonging to the Crown)."


When you cite the Project Plan, you misunderstand the definition of Collection. That Collection is everything
that is transferred to MHF from MOD as per the above statement. It is clear from the statement above that
personal property will not be transferred, and is not part of the Collection.


I agree that everything will be turned over to the ROW. Items transferred under the agreement would then go
to MHF and be accessioned (as part of the Collection). Items not transferred are considered personal
property (which would include coins as the government has specifically not claimed any). These would be
subject to normal legal channels in the UK which the ROW is charged with upholding.


The Balchin's heirs have been heard already, plenty. They vehemently protested the salvage and were very
vocal in perpetuating all the same falsities that other bloggers voiced. Logic and reason carried the day,
however.


They are perfectly within their rights to make claims as well. Assuming that they have proper documentation,
they could even win a portion. Understand that the portion would be very, very small. Balchin would have
been entitled to one percent of the commercial cargo, and 80 to 90 percent of that one percent would likely go
to the salvor (at least that has been the case in historic salvages in the past). You may also note that Balchin's
direct heirs may number in the hundreds or even thousands, so a small group of people cannot presume to
represent that entire class without proper authority.


30 Oct 2014, 05:34 PM


26922203
This paragraph is highlighted in bold text in the original document:


"8. Anybody wishing to investigate an historic military wreck must agree to uphold the general principles of the
UNESCO Annex. As such, a suitably experienced archaeologist should be appointed by the finder/proposer
to manage the project and they would be expected to comply with current policies, legislation, standards and
guidance applicable to UK maritime archaeology and marine heritage management. "

The UK government adds this, and the Victory is within the 200nm limit.


"11. UK policy in relation to marine planning and the historic environment is set out in the UK Marine Policy

territorial seas and offshore area adjacent to the UK, and the UK sector of the continental shelf."

You appear to rely simply of information provided by Odyssey, and criticize any information provided by other
sources.


The filing of the EIS was promised for months, and in several conference calls. Shareholders had been
promised it would be submitted any day for months. When it was submitted, did Odyssey issue a press
release? In fact, the CFO was at an investment conference the day after it was submitted, and still stated the
filing was imminent. Did you finally hear about it a week later after others posted on the net, and Meson wrote
an article?


Did Odyssey ever provide information or admit they were found guilty of Contempt of Court and fined over
$1.1 Million dollars?


Has Odyssey publically stated that the Admiralty Arrest for the Central America is under appeal?


Will Odyssey ever show the foundation for their claims on the Victory, the Courant article to the public? Very
simple question that would clear up the issue, but it is far more suspect when Odyssey refuses.


It is interesting that you require posters and Meson to provide links and source documents on information
posted, yet do not ask the same of Odyssey.

So there was an investigation, and a judge found them guilty (of what) yet the MoD ( with the MMO) still gave
OMEX the green light to act as contractor for the HMS Victory. Unless of course, what they were found
"guilty" of was at most similar to a misdemeanor, akin to a traffic ticket, as I don't think there was any trial or
judge involved. Nevertheless, whatever it is-if anything- is a non issue.

Meson Capital's initial report on OMEX is dated 10/31/13 and the day prior close price was $2.84. The shares have
fallen as low as $0.85 or a 70% gain. If you want to use the $1.20/share right at the time of this comment, thats still
58% in a year. That type of gain sounds pretty right to me.

The UNESCO web site shows the UK is not a signatory to the CPUCH treaty.


A contract once signed cannot be altered by one party because new rules are under consideration or adopted.


Balchin's descendents appear most of all concerned that OMEX is not spelling the name as they think it should be
spelled.


If Wessex does not believe there is gold aboard HMS Victory, then of course, they should not buy OMEX stock.


It does not matter whether OMEX gets the real articles (actual coins) or fair market value. Fair market value is really
preferred, because then they just cash the check without the hassle of managing a sales force.


The shorts are now trapped. With 19 million shares sold short, the volume is insufficient for them to cover at these
levels. When the stock opens up 20%, it says the shorts are in panic mode. Shareholders who cannot be flushed out
at $0.85 are not going to settle for $1.25. The party is over and the shorts have stayed too long.


By next spring's salvage season in the Channel, all the permits will be in place. Now is a good time to sit back,
welcome the new longs, and watch the SSCA coins come to market. I still want two of those 9000 dimes they found,
minted in SFO in 1856.

The contract that you and every keeps referring to is Odysseys contract with MHF. As noted by the MOD and
Advisory Committee, that contract is irrelevant. The MOD and Advisory Committee are dealing with MHF only.


The Deed of Trust, agreements and approvals are between the MOD and MHF.


The approval process between MOD and MHF has been ongoing. That over arches everything.


Balchin's descendants were far more concerned with who was representing themselves as a descendant,
hence the name revision sought, and given to them.


Wessex cares neither way if there was gold or not, they were hired by the MOD to review Odysseys work and
provide an assessment of the research and field work provided by Odyssey. As noted, Wessex did very
thorough desktop and field research.  
Wessex are not shareholders, they aren't short or long, they are a professional corporation. Their findings
significantly questioned Odysseys research and conclusions. Should not an extensive peer review, from a
very large firm of professional archaeologists, be regarded with a little more respect? After all, who does
Odyssey have on staff as an accredited maritime archaeologist?


Bottom line, it appears that the Odyssey research, both desktop and field work, was found to be with little
foundation. It was refreshing to read the Wessex report, especially the field work, and by comparison was far
more substantial. 
Failure to provide the key, the Courant report, should have been anyone's tale of the tape.


As far as fair market value, you need to go back and look at the Deed of Trust. The wreck was handed over to
MHF to administrate, with the Advisory Committee oversight and MOD approval required for anything. A
Deed of Trust is not a Quit Claim Deed, there will be no value associated with anything turned over to the
ROW, it is only for identification and likely a record of the recovery. The collection will be kept together, as a
living exhibit.  
MHF was required to have all funding for the recovery, conservation, and curation in place prior to approval to
proceed. MHF will not be 'paid' by anyone for the items recovered, they were required to provide prrof of
funding to proceed.


Odyssey will be paid from the MHF funding. That being stated, it is likely there was funding for cost plus
recovery, but not value associated with each artifact.

Wessex Archeology only did a desk based analysis, which means they sat at a desk and used what others did to
draw all of their conclusions. This is not the same as going out and researching all the information through
independent research.


On the financial situation I think that the Maritime heritage Foundation is going to raise the money for the recovery
and post the bond if it is necessary. Odyssey is conducting the recovery under their direction. So this company now
has three profitable projects happening, the Central America, The Victory and also Oceanica.


27 Oct 2014, 06:49 PM


26922203
You are wrong.  
Wessex also provided a very substantial field analysis.  
http://bit.ly/1p7SGSN


Upon review of this report, you will note is is far superior in many ways to the Odyssey reports. If Odyssey
had the equipment, they would not be reliant on taking thousands of closeups with the ROV and stitching
them together. There are also camera ROV's which have a very good field of view, and take HD images.
Again, more equipment that Odyssey does not use.


At that time, Odyssey did not have the triple beam sonar array, nor the sub-bottom profiler capabilities. Both
pieces of equipment are recent purchases by Odyssey.


The sub-bottom profiler is very important, as it can scan through the sediment, tell how thick the cover is, and
if there are any buried hard objects such as cannon. One would question why the self proclaimed 'leader' in
underwater recovery, would not have this very essential, and inexpensive, piece of equipment, and simply
relies on shallow plug cores by the ROV.


The Wessex report shows the depth of the sediment, and items potentially buried in that sediment.


This information was right next to the desktop study, so I am not understanding why so many people cannot
find it, or refuse to look for it.

For your information, the technical term for research is desktop, which doesn't mean you are sitting at your
desk, it simply differentiates between archival research and field work.


In addition: It should be noted that the sub-bottom profiler that Odyssey purchased, did not have the depth
capability to be used on the Central America. The profiler can be added to an ROV, and one wonders why this
has not been done.

There is nothing in the Wessex report that is original, they used information from other sources for the entire
report. They even asked Odyssey for the research so they could review it instead of going out on their own
and finding it.


And did Wessex do their own survey of the Victory site using their own equipment? No.


So the Wessex report gave us nothing new, it was a desktop based report in all senses.

Wessex Archaeology was commissioned by English Heritage on behalf of the Department for Culture Media
and Sport, to undertake an undesignated site desk-based assessment of the wreck site identified by Odyssey
Marine Exploration as site 25C, and possibly identified as the Victory. Odyssey Marine Exploration report that
the site lies within five nautical miles of 
49º40.8N 003º 47.9W (datum not given). This position lies within the Western English Channel, off Torbay,
Devon.


The Ministry of Defence and the Department for Culture Media and Sport requested that a desk-based
assessment of the site be undertaken in order to inform decisions concerning the future of the site.


WA did a far more extensive field analysis of the site. The geophysical survey is with the desktop report.

You are wrong, again.


Why do you keep repeating the same nonsense? Wessex was asked by the MOD to review Odysseys work.

on the Wessex website.

Green River Asset, Contributor
Ryan, Your analysis has several “fatal flaws,” but the most important has to do with the way that you apply the
UNESCO Annex to the Victory recovery. You say that the UK government announcement states the the MHF has
adopted the Annex to the Unesco Convention. Yet, the government announcement says something altogether
different.


That statement reads as follows: “ In parallel, the Government have worked with MHF to develop a phased approach
to the management of the site through a Project Design that conforms with the ARCHAEOLOGICAL principles of the
Annex to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage (“the Annex”), the agreed Key
Management Principles, and with the Government’s heritage policies.” (my caps)


MHF is not bound to comply with all facets of the Convention. It has developed a plan that conforms to the
Convention’s ARCHAEOLOGICAL principles only. That is exactly how the statement reads. To suggest otherwise is to
mislead your audience. The UK wouldn’t compel MHF to abide by all the rules set out in UNESCO, as the country has
not agreed to the UNESCO rules in general.


This said, even had the MOD compelled MHF to abide by UNESCO’s Annex, it still would not have prevented the sale
of items not accessioned. Rule 2b of the Annex clearly states: This Rule cannot be interpreted as preventing:


(b) the deposition of underwater cultural heritage, recovered in the course of a research project in conformity with this
Convention, provided such deposition does not prejudice the scientific or cultural interest or integrity of the recovered
material or result in its irretrievable dispersal; is in accordance with the provisions of Rules 33 and 34; and is subject
to the authorization of the competent authorities.


All of your subsequent Hurdles having to do with UNESCO (e.g. cash bonds, agreements between OMEX and MHF,
etc.) are therefore null and void.


You speculate that because OMEX no longer uses language regarding a percentage of treasure in its filings, that the
firm cannot take a percentage of the coins. This is faulty logic and a dangerous assumption. This is especially
dangerous given your history of making faulty assumptions.

You state: “This language was brought to our attention by numerous archaeologists who highlighted the UNESCO
CPUCH Annex, to which the UK is a signatory to.” Again, you are fabricating stories to scare investors. Here is the
direct quote from “Protection and Management of Historic Mitlitary Wrecks outside UK Territorial Waters” that the
MOD and you reference: “Though NOT CURRENTLY A SIGNATORY to the UNESCO Convention, the UK
Government has adopted the principles set out in its Annex (reproduced at Appendix C) as best practice in the
archaeological and cultural management of underwater sites and artefacts.” The key is that they note that the UK is
not a signatory (contrary to your statement) and that the UK follows the UNESCO principles as best practice in the
ARCHAEOLOGICAL and CULTURAL MANAGEMENT of these sites, not in the overall management of the sites.


You’re wrong that the 400,000 pound sterling reference is the only piece of evidence about the commercial gold
shipment. We also know that the Courant published the fact that, “concerns over the disappearance of the Victory
“today drove up the premium on the insurance of this ship to 15 percent.” So, something was insured on the ship.
Wessex argues that it could have been the ship itself, but I’m guessing that the government wouldn’t have looked too
kindly upon commercial bets as to whether its ships would go down.


All of the evidence for the shipment is circumstantial, but that is normal for the period. None of this would be on logs
or manifests. The circumstantial evidence is strong, ignore it at your own peril.


As for whether the gold could disappear without leaving a trace – it did leave a trace - in the newspaper. Virtually all
records in Lisbon prior to 1755 were destroyed in a massive earthquake.


You say, “No "secret gold" stories ever work out.” Yet, This isn’t a secret gold story. It’s a commercial shipment.
Similar to the Central America (that you thought would yield no gold), the Republic, and the Gairsoppa.


You contradict yourself when you assume a lengthy court battle. You’ve claimed that there’s no evidence of the gold,
yet now you turn around and suppose that there is evidence to support a claim in courts. If someone’s making a
claim, they’re making it based on something, right?


There’s not a lot to challenge here in this arrangement, but I realize that you have no other option than to keep
protesting. MHF was gifted the wreck. The laws in the UK provide for how personal property would be disposed. The
MOD has approved the work and Project Design. The Receiver of Wreck will follow the laws and those laws are clear.
If a claimant comes forward to claim a portion of the gold and has valid paperwork from 1744 that survived the
earthquake then they might be entitled to a portion. Just note that salvor awards historically have ranged from 90-
100% of value. The 80% we are assuming is below the low end of historical salvage awards.


You say, “To be perfectly clear: This is without legal precedent and contrary to the current rules.” But this is inaccurate.
There is plenty of legal precedent, and this project is well within the rules. Museums in the UK regularly deaccession
items of cultural heritage an offer them for sale. The Treasure Act of 1996 allows for treasure finds to be sold to
museums or on the private market. The Portable Antiquities Scheme also allows for the sale of cultural items in the
UK. The Victory recovery will adhere to the archaeological principles laid out in the UNESCO and to English Law, and
OMEX will be paid a percentage of the commercial cargo recovered.

Would you please provide proof that the UK is a signatory to the UNESCO Annex? I know that Bob Yorke has

different concept than being a signatory, of course. Is the UK really a signatory to any part of the CPUCH or
its Annex?

Hi Ryan, we're all still waiting for you to back up the key assertion in your article with a citation. Are you able
to prove that the UK is an official signatory of UNESCO's Annex?


You have stated that this is the case in the body of your article. Later in the comments, when pressed on the
subject, you stated that "The UK is a signatory to the entire UNESCO ANNEX, not the full convention or some
'archaological' subset of the Annex, but to the Annex. This is a fact."


If this is a fact, then you should be able to provide a citation that proves this fact. It is a material statement of
fact that you are making (at least you claim it to be a fact), as it buttresses the premise for your article.


So, can you prove it? Shareholders deserve answers, Ryan.


29 Oct 2014, 03:35 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
Ryan, 
Because the premise of this article relies so heavily on the material “fact” that the UK is a current signatory to
the UNESCO CPUCH Annex, and you have yet to produce any form of proof of this “fact” after three days, I
am going to suggest that you add a disclaimer to this paper. This disclaimer is for your protection.


As you know, the US has rules pertaining to the “Employment of Manipulative and Deceptive Practices,” (rule
10b-5) which state that, “it shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or
to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading….”


I believe that your research note is in direct violation of rule 10b-5. Note that this is not an allegation of bad
faith, rather I am letting you know about this for your own protection. Perhaps this is just a mistake on your
part. Perhaps this was a simple grammatical error that resulted in a full-blown investment thesis. Perhaps
after the error was pointed out to you, you meant to acknowledge the “mistake” and correct it, but you made
another grammatical error and typed “this is a fact” instead. We will give you the benefit of the doubt because
you have been so straightforward with shareholders in the past.


After three days of searching, I cannot find any reference to the UK as a signatory to any part of the UNESCO
CPUCH or its Annex. So, for your own protection, you might add the following to your disclaimer: “Investors

The UK government is not a signatory, but they have adopted the Annex to their own version, in this regards,
the "Protection and Management of Historic Military Wrecks outside UK Territorial Waters"


" 1. This document sets out information for anyone who may discover a Historic British Military wreck, located
outside UK Territorial Waters anywhere in the world, and includes details on who must be notified, the
protection that applies, and the process that follows in considering its long-term preservation and
management."


"Historic British Military wreck" not only sovereign, but all.


They have adopted the Annex:


"7. Since 2001 our underwater heritage policies have been developed in line with the Rules set out in the
Annex to the UNESCO 2001 Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. Though not
currently a signatory to the UNESCO Convention, the UK Government has adopted the principles set out in
its Annex (reproduced at Appendix C) as best practice in the archaeological and cultural management of
underwater sites and artefacts. The Government has also developed Key Management Principles which,
together with the Rules set out in the UNESCO Annex, must be followed. Examples of the Key Management
Principles are set out at Appendix D. "


This paragraph is highlighted in bold text in the original document:


"8. Anybody wishing to investigate an historic military wreck must agree to uphold the general principles of the
UNESCO Annex. As such, a suitably experienced archaeologist should be appointed by the finder/proposer
to manage the project and they would be expected to comply with current policies, legislation, standards and
guidance applicable to UK maritime archaeology and marine heritage management. "


The UK government adds this, and the Victory is within the 200nm limit.


"11. UK policy in relation to marine planning and the historic environment is set out in the UK Marine Policy
Statement. The UK Marine Area stretches up to 200 nautical miles from UK shores and includes the UK
territorial seas and offshore area adjacent to the UK, and the UK sector of the continental shelf."

GR: One would think that the Dutch Merchants would have a record of such a substantial amount of money?
What happened to their records? The Dutch Merchants had no insurance on their property?


Historically, the accounts of the blockade are well known. It is also known that the two Dutch warships in the
convoy, asked for permission to break off due to being low on supplies, correct?


I would ask this, why would money for Dutch Merchants be on a patrol boat in the English Channel, and not
be on the Dutch warships that returned home?


One has certainly seen many accounts of ships carrying gold, but what about silver? Why are those accounts
suspiciously missing (hence WA comment)?


Historically, in the mid 1700's, the Dutch Merchants were desperate for silver, as they were trading
extensively in India and China, which required payment in silver. You could note that the Dutch coinage of the
day was virtually ALL silver.  
The Dutch were importing huge amounts of silver, especially Spanish Reales, and this is substantiated in
historical and numismatic records.


All of that, yet Odyssey provides no proof of shipments of silver, but all gold?


The Odyssey version would have one believe that the Dutch Merchants put their shipment on a British
Warship, not a Dutch Warship? Does that appear very logical?


The Odyssey version would have us believe that the Dutch Merchants did not have a record of, nor carry
insurance on their cargo. Again, does that appear very logical?


From the Wessex report:


"5.5.42. It should be noted that in relation to the above analysis that OME have said to WA that they have
undertaken further research into their theories about prize cargo and bullion cargo. However, they have
refused to provide further details or enter into any further discussions on the issue, other than confirming that
they have been unable to find evidence to suggest that Victory called at Lisbon on the return voyage (OME
pers. comm.). OME have also agreed to provide copies of the Amsterdamsche 
Courant reports upon which their analysis relies. However, to date these have not been received. It therefore
cannot be confirmed at the present time that the translations given in the OME paper are correct or that there
are not other relevant reports that have not been disclosed by OME."


Odyssey confirms to WA they have NO evidence Victory called at Lisbon...


"...other than confirming that they have been unable to find evidence to suggest that Victory called at Lisbon
on the return voyage (OME pers. comm.)"


Odyssey promises the Courant....


"OME have also agreed to provide copies of the Amsterdamsche Courant reports upon which their analysis
relies. However, to date these have not been received."


There is the Odyssey website for the project, the Courant reports are not there, there is nothing proprietary
about the article(s), the information would simply be historical accounts. Such a very simple document to
produce, yet after all of this, the document is no where to be found?

I would add this from the Contempt of Court ruling in the Mercedes case from last September:


"...Odyssey withheld and deceived and deflected with respect to what it found because Odyssey knew full
well why Spain was asking and knew full well the adverse consequence to Odyssey’s financial aspirations if
Spain discovered the answer. "

269, Obviously it was not illogical for Dutch merchants or their intermediaries to place gold cargo on the
Victory, because a Dutch newspaper reported it as fact.


It would be seen as highly risky to put a large commercial shipment on two Dutch vessels that were traveling
alone in wartime. Those vessels would have been at great risk of attack from the French fleet which was
known to be in the area. They would have made a fantastic payday for Rochambeau, who would have
become wealthy almost beyond measure had he taken them with a large commercial shipment on board. No
one would have been comfortable putting the gold on those vessels.


The commander of the British fleet, Balchin, would have taken the payments on board the floating armored
car called Victory that was traveling with an entire British fleet. Victory was the strongest ship in the world at
the time. Balchin also had private profit motive in mind, and as Admiral of the fleet he would have been in
charge of the commercial shipment.


The Victory wouldn't need to call at Lisbon to receive commercial cargo from that port. We know that vessels
from Lisbon were received by the fleet while it was stationed off Lisbon.


I like the comparison with the Mercedes. In that case, OMEX salvaged somewhere near $500mn in coins
from the wreckage, but was not allowed to keep the coins. Omex learned its lesson from that experience and
has applied those lessons to the Victory recovery. The company has secured the full support of the UK's
Ministry of Defence ahead of the recovery in this case. That will make all the difference in the world.


The Mercedes was a fiasco in court. But with the US government surreptitiously operating against the
company to help Spain, it is no wonder the company was made to look like a villain.

Again, you provide a vast amount of text, but refuse to answer the simple question.


Why is there no record by the Dutch merchants for such a substantial loss for that time period. The Dutch
merchants have no record, and there is no record of insurance payouts on this amount?


The only record is a newspaper report that Odyssey refuses to provide?


The UK government has the full support? Why did it take 4 years to approve?

Per Meson Capital statement in the comment above, "The UK is a signatory to the entire UNESCO ANNEX"
Their article states "This language was brought to our attention by numerous archaeologists who highlighted
the UNESCO CPUCH Annex, to which the UK is a signatory to."


Why is it that several other serious commentators above have indicated that extensive research has not been
able to verify this statement. It is also contrary to what OMEX has stated under the higher level of SEC
scrutiny that Meson Capital is not being held to. Certainly Seeking Alpha requires such simple statements of
fact to be linked to the original source when many others question its veracity? Even Meson Capital is making
similar demands from commentators for links.


Why is Meson Capital not holding themselves to the same standard that they instigate with Seeking Alpha to
demand of others? This would not be the first time that Meson Capital has made false statements of this type.
It is clear that a similar false, if not worse, statement was used in the article in which Meson Capital stated
that Oceanica was in violation of Mexican environmental regulations for their drilling of the Don Diego site and
while their "source" BCS Noticias later retracted the false accusation, the Meson Capital article is still
published on Seeking Alpha with the false contents still incorporated. It was never similarly retracted and its
related headlines still adorn many financial websites across the Internet. 
False statements should not be tolerated on Seeking Alpha by commentators, much less by authors. The
UNESCO ANNEX was either signed by the UK or not, and it is clear that nowhere can anyone find this to be
a factually supported statement. So, let's ask that Seeking Alpha use a consistent standard and require that
Meson Capital either produce a link to the UNESCO signatory document or officially retract the statement
which several commentators, including myself, find is a self-serving false statement by a short position
perspective that isn't opinion, but rather a blatantly false statement of "fact". Shorts nor longs should be
allowed to invent their "facts".

Again, lots of words, but you still fail to answer the questions.


1. So, if the money for the merchants wasn't on the Dutch ships that headed home, how was the money
expected to get to Holland? 
(I will save you some time here, Britain and Holland are not connected by land.)


2. The is no 'fact' as you state regarding the Courant report. This newspaper article, nor the translation, has
not been seen by anyone outside Odyssey. That is very suspect. (remember the ruling)


3. The only record of this alleged sum of money is the Courant? Dutch merchants would not have insured
their cargo? There is no record from the Dutch Merchants themselves losing such a vast sum of money for
the day. 
Not a word from any merchants, in any record, anywhere? Answer that question.


4. You keep saying gold. Why is that? The Dutch exclusively used silver for currency and trading. The trading
partners in China and India demanded silver, not gold. Answer why you think this shipment would have been
gold.

5. 400,000 florins in guilders would have been 36,000 pounds sterling of the day, and would have been silver.
Should you be stuck on gold, 400,000 would have been 80,000 dukaats, each having 3.2g of gold. (about
8200 ounces of gold., not 4 tons) This is why the actual Courant is needed for a translation. Stop the guess
work, stop obfuscating the issue. If it were not an issue, one would bet the report would be available. (again,
ref ruling)

1. The coins could have stayed in the UK as London was the financial capital of Europe and Dutch merchants
could have kept balances there to facilitate trade. Money could have also later been brought to Amsterdam.


2. There is a newspaper item that mentions the shipment. This is a fact and there is really no other way to
explain it to you to make you understand it. Just because you haven't seen the article doesn't mean that it
doesn't exist.


3. You need to pay closer attention. There is evidence that the cargo was insured. That evidence comes from
the newspaper which reported a spike in the premium when news hit that the ship was missing. You won't find
records from merchants because they were in Portugal and very little survived the earthquake of 1755.


4. I keep saying gold because that is what the historical evidence suggests. Portugal was making more gold
than anyone in the world at the time. They were mining it in Brazil and shipping it home in vast quantities.
Gold coins from Portugal were the de facto currency in the UK. If the shipment contained silver, it would
increase my estimated value for the salvage due to the exchange rate at the time.


5. The Courant specifically mentioned pounds sterling so I wouldn't feel comfortable assuming Dutch
currency.


269, you can believe whatever you like. We are all used to short sellers telling us stories about the fact that
omex's projects will produce nothing and that the company will keep nothing, or that the govt or courts will get
in the way. I am very confident that the Victory will be an extraordinary recovery for omex. Time will tell.


01 Nov 2014, 08:43 AM


26922203
You are simply making up stories now.


1. The Dutch Merchants needed silver to trade with India and China. Those are facts. The VOC was importing
massive amounts of Spanish Reales to pay the East India, Chinese and Japanese markets. That is fact. Gold
on account in England? What so the VOC could use their debit card in China? The Dutch were never at war
with the British, and of course, the common system of banking in the mid-1700's was accounts, not cash,
correct? You statement fails on all tests. 
The Dutch were sellers, not buyers.


2. There is no fact about the article until there is peer review. For now, it is simply another secret cargo.


3. Again, circumstantial. Other than an article regarding illegal wagering, there is no other evidence that
supports that claim. Cargo could be insured, so why is there no evidence of a claim. The Dutch VOC and

other Merchants had their records in Holland, not Portugal. Again, your evidence fails on each level.


4. There is factual evidence that shows it would not have been gold. There are many articles available that
discuss the Power of the Dutch Merchants, VOC and East India, and the demand for silver, not gold.
Amsterdam was just as equal to, if not more powerful as a financial center in Europe at the time.


5. Again, why was the Courant report not provided to Wessex? A great chance for peer review, but again,
Odyssey obfuscates. Why?


Short or long, is of little matter, facts are. Why not let the facts of the Courant document speak for
themselves? Why is there no other account of the loss that a news article. The Dutch kept very good records,
in Holland. This is mid 1700's, not the age of stone tablets. There a vast archives of written works, even
archives of the Courant, save for the one referenced repeatedly. Circumstantial?

The gold in Lisbon came from Brazil, it flooded the country at that time. This is the money that was sent on
the ships, it was gold.


01 Nov 2014, 11:08 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
1) Sure, silver was in demand in the far east. Portugal had massive quantities of gold, however, and was thus
paying in gold. When the mines in Brazil stopped producing gold for Portugal, the economy collapsed. The
country was dependent on Brazilian gold to finance its trade deficit. That's a fact and there are plenty of
research papers out there that attest to this fact. 
2) "there is no fact about the article until there is a peer review"....Hey, have it your way.....short the stock as
much as you feel like....I know there's an article but if you're comfortable with basing an investment thesis on
lack of peer review, that is entirely your prerogative. 
3) Of course it's circumstantial. Pay attention. We've said from the outset that all the historical evidence is
circumstantial. We have a newspaper article that says that premiums spiked, that's what we have to go on. 
4) If you say that you have factual evidence that definitively shows what was on board Victory, we would love
to hear about it. 
5) Ask management.


I've had enough of this back and forth because it's going nowhere. You see it your way and I think you're
wrong, while you think I'm wrong. Time will tell who is right.

likely elucidate the lack of factual scientific perspective which is what is the basis for a valid permit to be

suspect that is the real motivation, as your friends at Puerto Chale cooperative explicitly stated in the link you
provided to their signature to a protest web site...."we have not seen a dime..." This is really pretty basic
stuff..."get a piece of the action" and the real fishermen on the Pacific Coast of Golfo de Ulloa are as upset

charity, don't you think? Unless of course, you are not donating to charity and this is just a marketing ploy. 
Also, do you know for a fact that ALL the fishermen will be protesting Oceanica? How do you know this?

The chart with financial analysis is so lacking that as a CFA I would be embarrassed to have my name associated
with it, even if I were short and looking for a worst case presentation scenario. Even the Wessex group which you site
in the article realizes that HMS Victory with her crew of over 1,000 men will have a very significant number of unique
artifacts and naval items illustrating the details of life on a first rate British vessel of huge historic importance. The
MOD will find it of special interest to have these salvaged from the site prior to further exposure to the risks of damage
and theft. 
However, if you consider the timing of the scenario, it will all take place long after the looming October 31st
bankruptcy date Meson Capital has predicted. Thus the analysis is meaningless at any rate so I wouldn't bother
updating the work.

To all my friends, commentators and authors.......it has been a veritable roller coaster ride over the last year with our
beloved OMEX stock........she has been beaten, bruised, battered, violated, misunderstood, stomped on, her
reputation sullied by innuendo, had her eyes pecked out by merciless short mercenaries, been castrated by angry
mobs of stock market renegades, been chided for having only mere millions in the bank, been called worthless,
useless, ugly, a dog, and her existence only affable to benefit management insiders...........and she is all but dead, but
not quite...........


The phoenix rises from the ashes...............she looms over her detractors, a looming menace and voraciously rips out
their hearts with her sharpened talons........Longs are riding her wing and look down upon the short bloodbath and
take solice..............OMEX the Braveheart wins the battle !!!!!


Wow........I should have been a movie producer..........Long and Strong OMEX.

STARTS


Hansard


24 Feb 2014 : Column 147W


Mr Kevan Jones: To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport pursuant to the answer of 10 February
2014, Official Report, column 410W, on HMS Victory, under what conditions and criteria her Department decides
either to salvage discovered British shipwrecks or to leave them to remain as war graves. [187915] 
Mr Vaizey: The management of historic wreck sites must be compliant with the Rules set out in the Annex to the 2001
UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. 
http://bit.ly/1p6IWs1


ENDS


As manager of the site, the Maritime Heritage Foundation are bound by this.


This is a Minister reporting to Parliament in a written answer which will have been drafted by his Civil Servants, so it is
as authoritative as it gets. Misleading Parliament is one of the most serious things a Minister can be accused of. So it
is a FACT that the UK is bound by the Annex - any action otherwise would be certain to be challenged in court

You are reading comprehension challenged. "The MANAGEMENT of historic sites…" 
And where in the above does it say that the UK is a signatory to the ANNEX et al?


I think GR beat you to it 10 minutes before your comment:


"According to the UK's Ministry of Defence "Though NOT CURRENTLY A SIGNATORY to the UNESCO
Convention, the UK Government has adopted the principles set out in its Annex (reproduced at Appendix C)
as best practice in the ARCHAEOLOGICAL and CULTURAL MANAGEMENT of underwater sites and
artefacts. (my caps)


Thus, according to the Ministry of Defence, Odyssey would be expected to adopt best practices as far as the
archaeological and cultural management of the wreck site, in accordance with the UNESCO Annex. To
suggest that terms of Odyssey's commercial arrangement with MHF are subject to the Annex appears to be
false." GR

But this doesn't support what you have claimed.


Nowhere in this parliamentary dialogue does it state that the UK is a signatory to UNESCO's Annex. Nowhere
in the parliamentary dialogue does it say that the commercial terms around the recovery will be bound by the
UNESCO Annex. All that this dialogue indicates is that the management of the site will be compliant with the
Annex's rules.

This idea is in accordance with the quote that I cited above where the MOD said, "Though NOT CURRENTLY
A SIGNATORY to the UNESCO Convention, the UK Government has adopted the principles set out in its
Annex (reproduced at Appendix C) as best practice in the archaeological and cultural management of
underwater sites and artefacts.”


Again, can you please furnish proof that the UK is a signatory to UNESCO's CPUCH Annex?

GR, et al,


Why do you keep reiterating the signatory issue? It has been established that the UK has adopted it. 
It is in their rules, which were published before the approval decision. MHF states they will abide by the rules. 
You attempts to separate the recovery are in violation of the rules, are trumped by the rules, and foundation of
the rules.


Again (hopefully for the last time)


This paragraph is highlighted in bold text in the original document:


"8. Anybody wishing to investigate an historic military wreck must agree to uphold the general principles of the
UNESCO Annex. As such, a suitably experienced archaeologist should be appointed by the finder/proposer
to manage the project and they would be expected to comply with current policies, legislation, standards and
guidance applicable to UK maritime archaeology and marine heritage management. "


Hence Margaret Rule...


The UK government adds this, and the Victory is within the 200nm limit.


"11. UK policy in relation to marine planning and the historic environment is set out in the UK Marine Policy
Statement. The UK Marine Area stretches up to 200 nautical miles from UK shores and includes the UK
territorial seas and offshore area adjacent to the UK, and the UK sector of the continental shelf."

I'm not sure why everyone is so hot over the UNESCO wording, OMEX never wanted to own the coin cargo assuming
it exists for its own amusement.


This has always been a recovery for the UK, and the UK, through the Maritime heritage Foundation, would determine
what would happen with the coins and other artifacts.


OMEX would be paid a percentage of the ultimate value, whatever that is. This is like finding an ancient gold treasure
in the hills of the UK, you notify the government and they would get to keep the collection intact and pay the
discoverers.


The same should apply here like the Staffordshire hoard. What's the difference if it went down with a ship or was
buried on land?
