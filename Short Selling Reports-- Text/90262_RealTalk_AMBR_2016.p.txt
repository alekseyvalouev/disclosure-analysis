AMBR


AMBR is a no-moat business within a HIGHLY competitive space at a significant
disadvantage to its peers.


Balance sheet and company metrics are deteriorating, and the credit card is
maxed.


Despite VERY optimistic forward assumptions, the company is significantly
overvalued.


Majority shareholder was the CEO of seized bank, is currently battling securities
fraud allegations, and recently sold a lot of shares at $9.00.


I love this more than my BNFT call (check the tape!), and have a PT of $3.50.

Amber Road, Inc. (NYSE:AMBR) is a provider of supply chain management software. If
you read the descriptions online or throughout the investor deck, you'll find buzz words
like "Global Trade Management Solutions" and SaaS. You'll learn that it offers products
related to Import Management, Export Management, China Trade Management, Global
Logistics Management, Trade Agreement Management, Supply Chain Collaboration,
and Professional Services. Not only that, but also AMBR "competes" with Oracle
(ORCL) (TTM revenue of $37.2Bn) and SAP (SAP) (TTM revenue of $21.7Bn). AMBR
sounds like a pretty large business.


Unfortunately for shareholders, the description is a lot more impressive than the
company's outlook from a historical or forward perspective. In reality, AMBR's TTM
revenue is <$70MM, and the CEO has been leading this "Global Trade Leader" since
August 1988. In other words, the company's software isn't new and disruptive.

More importantly, AMBR's "comps" are not really SAP or Oracle. There are an estimated
35-50 other tiny companies competing for the SAP/Oracle supply chain management
(SCM) scraps. Before you jump on my case for using the word "scraps", consider that
AMBR's average revenue per subscriber is less than $100k despite a "Global Customer
Base" filled with Fortune 500 names.

Furthermore, AMBR is a JOBS Act "lack of disclosure" beneficiary:

From my experience, "emerging growth companies" are generally unprofitable, but are
growing/changing pretty quickly, and thus, provide an "aspirational income statement
sizing" within their decks. AMBR does not offer a forward estimate of its aspirations
within its investor deck.


In summary, AMBR is an unprofitable JOBS Act beneficiary that has been in operation
since 1988. It competes within a highly competitive space, achieved a per/sub metric of


OK, now that we're on the same page, I'd like to further discuss AMBR's realizable
revenue prior to discussing its deteriorating balance sheet and company metrics, fair
value, and management.


Competitive Landscape, TAM, and Realizable Revenue


For many, it likely goes without saying that the SCM space is very competitive, but here
is an unbiased summary of the top 20 competitors:

The space is very competitive, and relatively mature (isn't expected to grow at break-
neck speeds). The most recent data (mmh) suggests that 2015 YoY growth for the top
20 suppliers was ~4.14%. AMBR's total growth (including acquired growth) was 3.5%,
suggesting that it may be losing market share. What's more concerning is that removing
acquired growth results in an approximate organic revenue loss of between 5% and 7%!
This is the proforma provided in Q2-2015:

First half of 2015 revenue was $32.6MM and the acquisition took place March 2015, so
there is 1Q of revenue within the $34.5MM proforma number (1Q of ecVision =
$1.95MM). Hypothetically, if ecVision's revenues were flat, then the implied revenue
within the 2015 number is ~5.9MM (3Qs at $1.95MM). 2015 full year revenue was
$67.1MM (YoY growth of 3.5%), which means organic revenue was ~$61.3MM, and
thus, 2015 achieved an organic loss of 5.5% (2014 revenue was $64.8MM). What's my
underlying assumption? ecVision was flat/stable throughout the year. Perhaps it grew
every quarter, which means organic growth was even worse. Or, perhaps it shrank,
which would suggest that management made another disappointing acquisition
(Chinese subsidiary discussed below). Please find the build here:

Obviously, AMBR lost a large customer in 2015, which frankly is a part of
business/competing. Every competitor within the above graphic faces these same
challenges, and at the end of the day, AMBR lost market share.


Given an approximate SCM spend of $6.3-6.6Bn in 2015, AMBR held an approximate
market share of 1-1.1%. Assuming that recent organic growth was an oddity, and in fact,
AMBR will gain market share through 2020, what's the best case? I think that 1.5%
(increase in market share of ~50%) provides the short case with ample margin of safety.
Therefore, that leaves us with a 2020 SCM spend of $7Bn and realizable revenue of
$105MM.


Prior to jumping into future earnings potential and valuation, a look at the balance sheet
and company metrics is warranted.


Balance Sheet is Deteriorating


At the end of 2014 (first annual report post AMBR's IPO), there was total cash of
$41.2MM, zero debt on the balance sheet, goodwill of <$25MM, net working capital of
>$24.6MM, and total shareholder equity of about $65MM.
8/8/22, 10:00 PM Amber Road _ The Road To $3.50 (>65% Downside) (NYSE _ AMBR) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4021218-amber-road-road-to-3_50-65-percent-downside 9/21


Fast forward to today (recent 10-Q) and a lot has changed. Shareholder equity has
plummeted to $36.7MM, net working capital is negative at -$8MM (been negative for two
quarters and trending downward), goodwill of nearly $44MM, net debt of about $20MM,
and total cash of $16.1MM.


Given such a stressed current ratio (0.82 in Q2, 0.89 in Q1), I wouldn't be surprised if
the company needs to raise cash. It's uncertain what the company's revolver constraints
are, but I expect some sort of return to the capital markets in the near term. Such a
return to the capital markets would serve as a significant tailwind/catalyst for the short
case as seen recently in Benefitfocus's (BNFT) case. Also, the credit card is still nearly
maxed out! From the recent 8-K:

In addition to a deteriorating balance sheet, it seems as though the company metrics are
also on the decline.


Company Metrics are Deteriorating


Annual margins have declined since 2013, gross profit YoY declined by 19% in 2015,
and revenue mix is trending towards the less-profitable service segment. All that said, I
find the following graphic to be the most telling:

Despite the company metric deterioration, I have built in a significant margin of safety
going forward, including my forward income statement sizing.


Wildly Conservative Income Statement Sizing


Management hasn't provided the typical "aspirational income statement" within the
investor deck that most growing but unprofitable companies provide. It's possible that
management simply views its business as stable but I've built in a huge margin of safety.


Source: RTI Graphics Department


To put the FWD cost CAGR in perspective, management would essentially have to stop
expanding and let costs rise with inflation (2-2.25%). Also, management would need to
expand margins at about 3% per annum. Prior to the recent acquisition, margins had
expanded from 53% in 2010 to 58% in 2015 (flat-lining after 2014, equating to 1% per
annum increase). Said differently, historically, this business hasn't achieved any
operational leverage, and going forward, I've assumed a ton of operational leverage.


All things considered, it's tough to argue the above sizing isn't a best-case scenario for
the bull. Despite using the bull's best-case scenario, AMBR is significantly overvalued
(foreshadowing: the shareholder with the most shares seems to agree!).


Valuation


Assuming management can produce significant forward operational leverage (despite
the past suggesting this won't happen), what kind of net margins am I arriving at?
Unfortunately for the bulls, the above conservative assumptions result in estimated net
margins of <1.25% (I've added a tax-rate of 35% to the assumptions above).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4021218-amber-road-road-to-3_50-65-percent-downside 12/21


Given the realizable 2020 revenue we calculated before ($105MM, equating to 17%+
FWD CAGR compared to historic CAGR of <16% including acquisitions), resulting
earnings are only $1.3MM. Assuming Amber Road can take margins from ~50% (today)
to 65% (low end of SAP's historic gross margins), it will still only achieve earnings of
~$5.3MM. Let's assume that we fall somewhere in between (still wildly conservative), we
ought to expect 2020 earnings of ~$3.3MM. Even if Mr. Market ascribes AMBR a 50x
trailing multiple, its future EV is <$168MM.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4021218-amber-road-road-to-3_50-65-percent-downside 13/21


I can't stress enough how conservative the above assumptions are. We've assumed wild
forward operational leverage despite management's failure to produce operational
leverage in the past, and recent annual organic growth of -5.5%.


RTI Price Target: $3.50 = 65% downside


Perhaps you've met with management, think it's best-in-class manager/investor, and
believe the acquisition of ecVision was the greatest investment of all time. I have used
the below information to ease that concern (from the short perspective).


Management


According to the proxy, at least one past acquisition has been a disappointment
(Chinese subsidiary):

In other words, the EasyCargo acquisition wasn't a huge success (didn't achieve
revenue targets). Although past experience may not indicate future performance, we all
know how important track records are within the investment community.


Additionally, it is worth noting who the major shareholder is in order to add to the "AMBR
mosaic".

Mr. Caldwell was the CEO of Atlantic Financial when regulators seized it in 1990. More
recently, Mr. Caldwell is also a key party within the class action lawsuit against Rubicon
Technology (RBCN). The class action suit alleges that management (including Caldwell)
misled investors for the benefit of Caldwell and his fund, Cross Atlantic Funds. A
summary can be found here (source for next four graphics).

In total, Cross Atlantic Funds and Caldwell received $31MM in the secondary ($31MM is
>2x today's entire market cap). At the time of the offering, Caldwell, together with Cross
Atlantic, owned nearly 10% of RBCN's outstanding shares. Today, Cross Atlantic is not a
major holder and Caldwell owns less than 0.65% of the company.

It is important to note that these shares were sold in mid-September, and institutional
ownership has declined from ~59% to less than 55% as of late (June-16 to Sep-16).
This suggests that the marginal buyer is a non-institutional/retail investor.


Summary


As an investor who prides himself on picking real money-making shorts (as opposed to
"free loans"), I became very excited when I started looking into AMBR. Rather than
summarize the above points, I made a summary graphic of all the "short boxes" AMBR
checks:
