Even Bulls Seem To Agree: AmTrust's Loss Reserves Defy Accounting
Logic
Jan. 5, 2015 7:31 AM ET16 comments

Summary


AFSI's Loss Reserve Triangles Imply Negative Remaining Reserves, Which
Accounting Logic Forbids.


Review of Peers' Disclosures Confirms AFSI Situation Is Anomalous.


AFSI Bulls Ignoring Significant Problem (Despite Independently Computing Same
Amounts!).


BDO & Audit Committee Members Face Significant Risk If They Ignore Reported
Problems.


Independent Investigation Necessary & Increasingly Likely; Could Trigger Significant
Restatement.


AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) has been the focus of two letters from
Alistair Capital in recent weeks.


First, AFSI's Audit Committee received a letter criticizing the Company's accounting and
arguing that AFSI appeared to have material deficiencies with respect to internal controls
for financial reporting.


Then, the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority received a letter that described yet more
accounting problems and highlighted a troubling fact about AFSI's intra-company
reinsurance agreements. Specifically, nearly all of the eligible assets in AFSI's
Bermuda captive reinsurance subsidiary have been pledged to AFSI's US
subsidiaries, leaving the Bermuda captive almost nothing with which to fulfill its
obligations to AFSI's European subsidiaries.


In both letters, an apparent flaw in AFSI's 10-K reserves was discussed as an example of
why AFSI is significantly under-reserved and/or has significant accounting control issues
(or both). For example, the letter to the PRA states:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2796805-even-bulls-seem-to-agree-amtrusts-loss-reserves-defy-accounting-logic 2/12


"AmTrust's reserve deficiency can be seen by converting the Company's calendar
year loss triangles, as presented in its most recent Form 10-K, into accident year
results. Upon doing so, it becomes clear that accident years 2008 and 2009 are
significantly under-reserved because the Company has already paid claims in
excess of the Company's revised estimate of ultimate claim payments for those
accident years, implying negative remaining reserves - an 'accounting impossibility'.


"I believe AmTrust is under-reserved for other accident years as well, but chose to
focus on these accident years because I believe it is the clearest demonstration that
the Company has underestimated its liabilities for claims."


There have been some comments that criticize this analysis, but they fail to provide any
substantive argument for how the critics' methodology is incorrect (or what their alternative
calculation implies).


Instead, AFSI bulls seem to rely on sell-side analysts to justify their positive views. Yet the
bulls seem to ignore the fact that even the sell-side analysts they use to justify their
positive views of AFSI arrived at the same conclusion as the letters' author.


At the same time, it seems the analysts themselves have chosen to gloss over their own
calculations and ignore the fact that AFSI's accounting is, in all likelihood, erroneous.


If (when?) AmTrust finally acknowledges a TWGP-esque reserve deficiency, long holders
will probably be shocked but they shouldn't be. After all, the sell-side was bullish on
TWGP until it was too late as well. In fact, most of them kept buy ratings on TWGP even
as the collapse became increasingly obvious.

Long-time investment banker to the Karfunkels, FBR, included the tables below in their
April 9 note titled "2014 Reserve Analysis: Favorable Read on TRV, XL, AMSF; AIG, AFSI
Neutral". Note that FBR arrived at the same amounts (rounded) for "Unpaid" reserves at
AFSI as what was Alistair Capital computed for "Remaining Net Reserves," including the
critical years of 2008 and 2009. FBR's paid-to-incurred ratios of greater than 100% for
those years confirms this result.


In fact, of the 24 companies in FBR's table below, only one company had a year
where paid-to-incurred was greater than 100%: AFSI.


Each and every one of the other 23 companies FBR reviewed (see the table below) had
paid-to-incurred ratios below 100%, as they should, because exceeding 100% defies
accounting logic.

Note: FBR's tables covering all companies only go back to 2009. AFSI's paid-to-incurred
(revised) also exceeded 100% for AY 2008 (163.7%).


Barron's


If FBR's confirmation of Alistair's calculations does not sway bulls, they could also look to
the Barron's article from May 31, 2014 ("Balance Sheet Risk Makes AmTrust Shares
Vulnerable") which noted AFSI's negative reserves:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2796805-even-bulls-seem-to-agree-amtrusts-loss-reserves-defy-accounting-logic 5/12


Questions about whether the company is under-reserved arise because of some
puzzling accounting disparities: AmTrust and Maiden Holdings show a $400 million
difference in their accounting for the same reinsurance activities; AmTrust's numbers
for acquired reserves differ by $50 million in different parts of its financial
reports;while the latest 10-K's tabulation of loss reserves leaves AmTrust with
negative reserves for some years-an impossible accounting that would mean that
policyholders would actually pay AmTrust millions for claims in those periods.


...


Insurance investors usually study a company's annual tabulation of loss reserves for
each year. But, as noted, AmTrust's 10-K indicates that its reserves remaining after
claim payments for all the years up through 2007 are $95 million more than the
amount for those years plus 2008 -- which if correct, would indicate that
policyholders will pay AmTrust that $95 million on the 2008 incidents.


KBW


In response to the Barron's article, KBW published a note on June 1, 2014 ("Barron's
Publishes Another Negative Article on AmTrust") which implied agreement with Barron's
criticism:


Conclusion


Since FBR, Barron's and KBW all seem to agree with the view expressed in the letters
sent to AFSI's Audit Committee and the PRA -- that AFSI's 10-K reserves imply
(nonsensically) negative reserves for 2008 and 2009 -- the criticism and analysis appear
to be well-founded.


The question now is:


Will BDO and the Audit Committee continue to ignore these obvious problems?


Doing so might to maintain the facade for now, but BDO and the Audit Committee are
likely feeling significant pressure to initiate an investigation since BDO is likely doing their
last audit of AFSI (NYDFS condition) and the Audit Committee members now risk
personal liability via Sarbanes Oxley if they continue to ignore the problem.

Comments (16)


On that note, if AFSI's accounting is fine, there should be no hesitation to initiate
such an investigation, so why hasn't AFSI's Audit Committee announced that they
will do so?


However, if AFSI's accounting is not fine and my views (as laid out here, here, here, and
here) are validated, AFSI may need to massively restate earnings -- likely rendering the
company insolvent.

There is a very very very small chance of the worst worst worst case scenario. And only then would a $0 price target

First of all. It is clear that you and Alistair Capital are either one and the same, or working towards the same goals.
You quote these "letters" as if they are independent. They are sent by someone like yourself with a massive short
position in this stock, attempting to tank it with what appear to be coordinated news releases and articles to give it the
air of legitimacy. The Barrons article that you are referring to essentially parrots prior hit piece and adds nothing new,
which leads me to believe that the hit piece was the source of the Barrons article for the most part.


What I find interesting and sometimes funny, is that once one line of attack is closed or addressed you simply move
onto another.


The simple fact of the matter is that your analysis of the 10-K is flawed. It displays an almost deliberate amateurish
understanding of insurance. I ask you to please explain how you have arrived at these results, rather than pointing to
a source that parrots your results. If you understand this stuff so well show me a screen shot of the 10-K and explain
how you have arrived at your results. I suspect you have made errors in either calculating them or in assuming it
means what you think.

And while we are at it here is a question for you: what do you think is more likely, that AmTrust has really paid out 95
million more in 2008 than they have reserved for that year (an accounting impossibility as you have noted), or that
your analysis of these and all accident years is seriously flawed?


You are trying to tease out numbers and doing so badly, I suspect intentionally, to move the stock and improve your
position. I also find it curious that you highlight these two years in your analysis and not 2007, which appears to be
massively over reserved by your same analysis, but of course this would not fit your goal. I also find it interesting that
you state that you believe other years are under-reserved but choose to focus only on those 2 years. You focus on
those 2 as they are the only ones based on your analysis that support your short position.


I have already bought more of AFSI on this dip, and while I should thank you for providing this opportunity, I will not,
as I feel that distortions and the hit pieces that you have been spewing are actually a disservice to all investors. Good
luck in your defamation suit with AmTrust, you will need it.

Gotham Investing, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Are you suggesting that FBR and KBW (references in the article that you ignore in your
comment) are merely parroting others as well?


That was the point behind the article -- three independent firms (including two AFSI supporters) arrived at the
same conclusion.


As to your comment that I "choose to focus on only those 2 years", I would make two points. First, as the FBR
table demonstrates there should not be a single year that has negative reserves. Two anomalies that indicate
significant accounting problems are, in my view, worth highlighting.


Second, even if one lumps 2007, 2008, and 2009 together, there would only be $34.7m of reserves for these
three accident years COMBINED. Since AFSI paid out $48.1m for these three accident years in 2013, it is
highly, highly unlikely that $34.7m of reserves are sufficient.


The analysis I did is standard protocol insurance analysis that FBR applied to all 24 companies in their
coverage universe and arrived at the same result.


Any number of sell-side primers on p/c insurance will discuss this concept and the analysts update these
calculations each year. I suggest you approach them about it because I doubt you will believe anything I say
anyway.

As I mentioned earlier, this is an error in your calculations and assumptions. You cannot always pull this data
out of the 10-K, and the fact that you have negative reserves after your analysis should have made that clear.
Here is the companies response to the Barron's article that you refer to:


"Question 2: I ask, because the loss triangles on pp. 19-20 of its 2013 10-K seem to indicate 
that AmTrust has paid out claims in excess of its revised estimates of losses for the 
accident years 2007-2009. How can an insurance company have negative reserves for an

accident year? 
Company’s Response to Question 2: The loss triangles on pages 19 and 20 of the 
Company’s 2013 10-K show cumulative loss development on a calendar year basis, not 
on an accident year basis. Our accident year reserves for 2007 through 2009 are not 
negative and are consistent with our calendar year results. 
The anomaly that you appear to be referring to results from backing out accident year 
results from the calendar year triangles. It is the results of that effort, not the loss 
triangles themselves, which appeared to show negative accident year reserves. 
Unfortunately, the analysis you have performed does not show the effect of the 
Company’s acquisition in 2007 of $168 million in loss reserves. Therefore the analysis 
is flawed and we did not have negative reserves in 2008 or 2009. 
Finally, our consolidated actuarial studies underscore that we are squarely within 
developed actuarial ranges."


And here is the link http://ow.ly/GPCJu


These are old allegations that have already been addressed responded to by the company.

Don't you think that AM Trust would hand over the AY data, so FBR Capitals (their banker) and others would
be able to compare them to their peers and get it over with? The letter you are attaching is very interesting
but it says nothing of substance. I mean, what did you expect them to tell you. All insurance companies are
telling you they found the magic recipe, 'till you find out they did not (i.e we though we did but we actually
made accounting errors etc).


I would advice you to cut back a little on supporting AM Trust, as i noticed you bought more shares today, and
if it happens and the critics are right you will be the first in the line looking to hire a lawyer....


Personally, i think FBR Capital knows what is going on, and they are trying to cover their butt, as i think they
were Tower's bankers as well, and if 2 of your companies collapse chances are people will be looking at you
in a weird way, unless you said something in advance.


06 Jan 2015, 01:10 AM 


Marcel Proulx
So how does this work. When Gotham doesn't want to respond you jump in? Do you take turns?


They have already addressed this in the note above, and frankly, should not have to continually respond to
the same distorted info again and again. Why on earth would they supply this to FBR for analysis on the
sector based on backing out data from 10-K's. Were they asked to respond by FBR? All we are given are
these tables in isolation, are there any comments on this table, or qualifications? The regulators would have
their accident year data and more detailed information on their reserves, yet they do not seem to be
screaming fire, or even saying there is smoke.

The letter does not have to have a lot of substance, as the allegations are nearly groundless and simple for
the company to explain.


More groundless speculation: 
"Personally, i think FBR Capital knows what is going on, and they are trying to cover their butt, as i think they

I do not even know Gotham, or any of the other people involved, and again i have no position on the stock. It
is not groundless speculation, as in the industry it is not the norm to go out and say bad things about your
customers. It does not work like that. and if i am your banker since always, chances are i know what is going
on.


I did not say they should continuously respond. Just hand over the data needed and get it over with. does not
this make more sense?


And the insurance department put a million requirements for them in place, totally unprecedented for anyone
that knows how the NY department of insurance works.


06 Jan 2015, 10:20 AM 


Marcel Proulx
So in an industry where it is not the norm to go out and say bad things about your customers, you are
assuming because they do not say bad things that there is some sort of conspiracy to under reserve and cook
the books? Wow, pretty convincing argument there.


So let us respond to your question: 
"I did not say they should continuously respond. Just hand over the data needed and get it over with. does not
this make more sense?"


Were they asked for this data? If the analysis that they put out there is based on trying to break out accident
years from the 10Ks of all of these companies, would it not seem odd to get the adjust numbers for the
accident years in question from AmTrust? There is nothing to put to rest, the fact is that AmTrust is extremely
likely properly reserved for both 2008 and 2009.


Let us respond to your last comment and hyperbole and all: 
"And the insurance department put a million requirements for them in place, totally unprecedented for anyone
that knows how the NY department of insurance works."


Did you listen to the last earnings call where they addressed the requirements by NY Dept of Insurance in
depth? If not perhaps read the transcript. If anything the fact that they have no issues with any of the
requirements speaks more to the fact that there is nothing untoward going on and nothing to hide. However, if
you want to paint it as something different you are welcome do, just don't expect everyone else to fall over
themselves to accept your conspiracy theories and that this company is not above board.

If you are not short the stock then my guess is that you are working for a competitor. Either way, you have a
vested interest in supporting or continuing to propagate what amounts to really unfounded speculation and
the repeating of already addressed issues.


The analysts covering this stock have all this information. They access the same information as you and I. Yet
they are still very bullish on this stock. I guess the analysts, the regulators, the audit committee and everyone
else are either completely and ridiculously incompetent, or they are in on the broad conspiracy.


Only the parties that have recklessly bought 150K puts expiring Jan 17 clearly know what is going on? It is a
short and distort scheme plain and simple. Anyone can see this, you choose to be blind to it, I cannot help
you there.


06 Jan 2015, 10:50 AM 


DevilsAdv
Yes, no investment banker will put reports out saying their customers are not doing well. Period. This is how
things work in finance. So, the fact that FBR capital put this report out, and asked these questions is very
suspicious. And the reason I think they did it is because of Tower. If one of your customers collapses, you can
say you did not know anything about it, but if a second customer of yours collapses for the same reason, and
the same accounting/reserving problems, then people will start asking if you are doing your job.


If I read what happen correctly, AM Trust says that the reason they seem to have a paid to incurred ratio of
more than 100% (vs. none of their competitors did) is because the FBR analysts used CY data instead of AY
data for their analysis. So, it is easy to shut critics up by putting the AY data out so people can see what you
paid vs. what you reserved is not over 100%, and then nobody will be asking questions. Right? Why leave
this hanging for so long?


I worked with the NYDOFS for many years, and I know how they work. They are very friendly, and very
accommodative, which is good for the industry. For them to put such requirements in place, it means they saw
quite a few red flags, in my opinion. I do not want to make nothing out of it. But if AM Trust collapses, I will
print all these and go to the DOI and SEC and demand answers, because nobody has the right to distort the
markets in such a way, cook the books (if they are) and make a profit. In case you did not notice, an AM Trust
insider made another $833,688 through selling company stocks yesterday.


I think I disclosed to you already that I work in the industry, and this is why it bothers me so much what they
are doing, but no, I do not work for a competitor. I have a different role in the industry and I am not directly
affected by what they are doing. It just bothers me as it is so obvious to everyone in the industry that what
they are doing is not right, yet they can keep doing it for so long, and make so much money in the process.


What you say about analysts have all information etc. would be very convincing, if it wasn’t for Tower to have
collapsed a couple of years ago. Tower seemed to be doing great for years, and then it was all proven to be,
let’s call it “accounting mistakes”.


The reason these parties need to be rewarded if they are right (short sellers), is because we want to give
incentives to these parties to go out and do independent research on companies as the DOI and the SEC do
not have enough resources to audit so many companies. What they do is very valuable for the industry.

If their is any conspiracy theory, DevilsAdv & Gotham Investing, it is about folks like you trying to tank AFSI so
that you can make gains on your shorts by bouncing the market.

As i already disclosed to everyone here, i am an insurance professional (and no, i do not work for a
competitor), and i have no position on the stock. Neither short, nor long, nor puts, nor calls nor any other
derivatives position. Period. And i do not know any of the people writing these articles (Gotham, Alistair etc).


Actually, i would love the opportunity to be called by the SEC and the DOI, to discuss AM Trust doings. But i
do not think they will ever call me to discuss these issues with me.


Btw, instead of attacking me, why do not you attack my arguments? And i would also appreciate it if you
disclosed how you are related to AM Trust, if you are?

Exactly. it worked for them once well last year, and they are going to keep using the same formula and

As a CPA I believe that consistent reporting of financial statements on a calendar year basis demands that all
schedules including "loss reserves schedules" be reported on a calendar year basis. Each year should stand on it's
own, showing adequate reserves for losses incurred during the year. The company's contention 
that accident year should be used to reconcile losses goes against the accounting precept to always match costs and
revenues in the calendar year being reported. 
A restatement of prior years financial statements might be in order.
