BofI Holding: Will Regulators Strike?
Dec. 2, 2014 1:55 PM ET35 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


We found a presentation that sheds light on BOFI's lending activities. As a result, we
believe the market is meaningfully underestimating the regulatory and credit risk in
BOFI's loan book.


We view the HRB transaction delay as an early sign of regulators taking a harder
look at BOFI’s business practices.


Our research points to potential management and organizational credibility issues
(including: potential CEO resume embellishment, recent auditor change, recent
resignation of key officers, and potential disclosure issues).


We see ~65%+ downside in the stock.


Overview


Sandler O'Neill had Bank of the Internet (NASDAQ:BOFI) management on the road in
November to meet with institutional investors
Following these meetings, Sandler published a note on 11/24/14 stating that
"management's biggest concern right now is regulatory risk"… We Agree
We found a presentation through a web search (the presentation was put together by
an Account Executive at BOFI and provided to Crossline Capital ) that provides details
about BOFI's high risk lending activities
Our research also suggests that there may be a persistent culture of aggressive
lending standards within the Account Executive ranks at BOFI
We view the October 2014 H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) transaction delay as an early sign
of regulators taking a harder look at BOFI's business practices
We believe that the market has completely missed the heightened risk present in
BOFI's loan book as a result of weak disclosure in BOFI's public filings and we believe
that in 1QF15 (CY 3Q14) we saw the first signs of weakness in BOFI's loan book
(delinquent loan balances doubled between 6/30/14 and 9/30/14)
We also believe that CEO Greg Garrabrants may have misrepresented his work
experience in his official BOFI biography, which if true calls into question his credibility

We see signs of potential issues in the company's accounting organization. BOFI's
Chief Accounting Officer resigned in May 2013 and at around the same time BOFI
changed its auditor from Crowe Horwath to BDO USA
Based on our review of the above presentation, we have questions about how BOFI is
calculating the LTVs and FICOs it reports to the market
We think that BOFI is taking outsized regulatory and credit risks. We also think that
BOFI may be under-reserving against future losses. Finally, we have concerns around
the bank's financial disclosures and accounting practices
We see ~65% downside in BOFI's stock price (based on a target price of 1x TBV) as
we expect NIM compression, potential regulatory intervention, as well as a re-rating of
the multiple to levels more appropriate for a bank of this risk profile


"No Job, No Income, No Problem"


Our focus in this article is on the asset side of BOFI's balance sheet as well as on the
management team at BOFI. Previous research reports have already called out the
interest rate risk at BOFI as well as the risks associated with BOFI's potential foray into
prepaid cards (see: Seeking Alpha, Kerrisdale, and Citron).
Our research points to signs that the lending culture at BOFI is "aggressive." In
addition to the correspondent presentation we found above, we also found an article
dating back to 2011 in which a BOFI Account Executive was accused of using the
phrase "No Job, No Income, No Problem" in a marketing email
When asked to comment on the language used by the Account Executive, Garrabrants
said that it is "the complete opposite of who we [BOFI] are"
However, our research suggests that BOFI's Account Executives continue to employ
aggressive marketing and underwriting tactics. In addition to the March 2014 dated
presentation we found online, we reviewed LinkedIn profiles for multiple current BOFI
Account Executives and provide excerpts from their profiles below:
"I simplify Niche Jumbo lending for Mortgage Bankers and Brokers so they can fund
more deals and get paid more often"
"We offer aggressive non-QM options",
One Account Executive indicated that BOFI could ""create" monthly income for all or
part of a borrower's qualifying income" (we did not add the quotes around the word
create)
In our opinion, BOFI's underwriting standards appear to be lacking discipline as
evidenced by the bank's willingness to extend credit to borrowers including foreign
nationals who lack historical tax returns and credit scores, as well as borrowers who
have blemished credit histories (foreclosures, short sales, and bankruptcies)

While the Street applauds BOFI's outperformance relative to peers, our research
suggests that the primary driving factor of BOFI's outperformance versus peers are its
high risk loans. Despite the riskiness of its loan portfolio, BOFI's loan loss reserves are
amongst the lowest of any bank we surveyed
Management has spent the last few quarters convincing the investment community
that the reason for BOFI's outperformance versus peers is its efficient "internet model"
However, this claim does not explain how BOFI's net interest margin is so far ahead of
its peers. Keep in mind that branchless banks such as BOFI have to generally pay
more for deposits than traditional banks, meaning that all-else equal, branchless banks
should have lower NIMs but are able to offset their structurally lower NIMs through
superior efficiency ratios versus their traditional banking peers
Many BOFI bulls view BOFI as an "internet name" that is deserving of an "internet
multiple" (some bulls have referred to BOFI as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix
(NASDAQ:NFLX), or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of the bank industry - we find this view
comical given that virtually every bank in the U.S. has offered robust internet banking
tools for the past decade!)


Lending Guidelines - "90% LTV Loans" at "680 FICOs…but we're flexible!"


In regards to BOFI's underwriting standards, we found a document online that BOFI
provided to one of its mortgage correspondents (the presentation was previously
available through this link (now dead) on Crossline Capital's website…we have
provided a live link to the original presentation here and have also provided a link to
our Bing search for the file here … the search result remains live as of this publishing
The authenticity of the presentation can be confirmed through a quick LinkedIn search
for the publisher of the document
While former Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke is struggling to refinance his home
loan, BOFI is "willing to be flexible" in its loans to foreign nationals, including
"accepting letters of employment translated into English by certified translators" (their
words, not ours!)
BOFI regularly highlights its marketing partnership with Costco (NASDAQ:COST). We
believe that BOFI's COST originated loans are likely all sold to agencies and therefore
are not at all reflective of the "portfolio loans" BOFI actually holds on balance sheet
Based on our review of the presentation, we understand that BOFI is open to
underwriting high-risk loans including, but not limited to, loans to foreign nationals
(including foreign nationals that lack verified historical tax returns), jumbo loans to
retirees that are based on retirement savings rather than current income (i.e., a jumbo
home loan to a 73-year-old who is unable to qualify for a loan based on current income

but has retirement savings that BOFI uses to "synthetically create" income), and loans
to borrowers with a history of foreclosure and bankruptcy
We note that foreign national loans are subject to potential fraud and "know your
customer" risks, and loans to borrowers who fail to qualify based on verifiable income
are subject to potential violations and penalties associated with originating non-QM
loans and violating the ability-to-repay rule
BOFI originates its loans through the wholesale channel and as a result of its
"branchless" business model is unlikely to truly "know its customers" in the way a
traditional bank would… despite the risks associated with buying loans through the
wholesale channel, BOFI writes gigantic home loans, often well in excess of $1 million,
meaning that it will only take a few bad loans for asset problems to emerge at the bank
Loan delinquencies picked up meaningfully in the most recently reported quarter yet
BOFI continues to reserve for loan losses at one of the lowest rates of any bank in the
U.S.
The presentation also suggests that BOFI is open to making large loans on second
and third homes to individuals (the presentation seems to suggest BOFI has "no limit
to the number of financed properties" a borrower may have). These types of loans
carry potentially higher risk of becoming non-performing because the underlying
borrowers have multiple mortgages to support
BOFI also appears open to lending to individuals with historical credit issues
(bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc.)
Finally, we are surprised at BOFI's willingness to test CFPB ability-to-repay rules with
"at-risk" groups such as retirees (illustrated in the underwriting example BOFI provides
of lending to a 73-year-old seeking to use liquid retirement savings to fund the loan as
a result of having insufficient income to qualify)
Per BSN Law: "It is important to note that for non-QM loans, a lender may find it very
difficult to avoid a trial if compliance with the repay test is raised, since such
compliance is very much fact specific. Therefore, a judge will be disinclined to grant a
motion for a summary judgment without first hearing all of the evidence regarding the
underwriting of the loan and the borrower's particular situation. This may increase the
likelihood that failure to comply with the ATR test will be routinely raised in disputes
with mortgagors, and will also increase the likelihood that lenders will want to settle
before the expense of an evidentiary trial is incurred"
Not only are there potential regulatory issues associated with this type of lending, but
BOFI does not appear to have any escrow rights to the assets used to "create the
income" for the loan, enhancing the risk that such loans could end up non-performing

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 5/31


The evidence of BOFI's outsized risk taking is clear in its asset yields and in its overall
best-in-class return on assets (two charts below illustrate this point)…BOFI earns a
massive premium in its loan book relative to peers (generating over 5.0% returns on its
loans  which are predominantly jumbo 5/1 ARMs versus peers that earn between 3.0%
and 3.5% on average in jumbo 5/1 ARMs)
We note that BOFI earns over 5% on its loan assets which are predominantly single
family mortgages, versus internet bank peers such as EVER and ALLY that earn
~3.75% in their single family books, and First Republic (NYSE:FRC) which earns
~3.5% in its single family residential book
We think it is wrong to compare a branchless internet bank such as BOFI to a highly
esteemed private bank such as FRC. We cite FRC as an example only because BOFI
management recently claimed BOFI has a superior product offering to FRC on an
earnings call
A quick review of Bankrate.com's mortgage tables will show that jumbo 5/1 ARM rates
are as low as 2.75% to 3.0% in some parts of the country, indicating BOFI's yields are
off the charts
While BOFI management claims that its loans are high quality and low risk, its massive
rate premium versus its peers would suggest otherwise… in fact, it would suggest
BOFI is taking on risks that other banks are simply unwilling to underwrite, yet is
reserving against future loan losses at rates far below other banks. This dynamic is
even more surprising to us in light of the fact that BOFI is growing it loan book at the
incredible pace of >60% y/y!
Even the CEO of Ocwen Financial (OCN), which faced its own regulatory scrutiny,
rejected the idea of playing in the non-QM space that BOFI specializes in, saying on a
recent conference call:
"Let me state that we have no interest in originating non-QM loans, given the penalties
that the originator could incur."
Based on BOFI's "outlier" asset yield reported in its SEC filings, we believe
substantially all of the loans held on balance sheet fit into these high risk non-QM
categories
We wonder why the Board has not taken a harder look at the loans BOFI is
underwriting and the reserves the bank is taking against these loans
We also believe that the company should take immediate steps to enhance its public
disclosures regarding these loans
We reviewed BOFI's financial statements from the past several years, and also looked
through conference call transcripts from the last several quarters and could find no

mention of the risks associated with BOFI's non-QM lending, or even any mention that
BOFI engages in non-QM lending
The charts below summarize the "too good to be true" nature of BOFI's business
model; despite having a best-in-class return on assets as a result of its high risk
lending, BOFI has one of the lowest reserve ratios of any bank in the United States:


Despite management's assertion that BOFI underwrites low loan-to-value loans of
under 60% and borrowers with ~716 FICO scores, the presentation we found suggests
that BOFI is underwriting loans at up to 90% loan-to-value ratios through its
"pledged asset program", and is also underwriting borrowers with FICO scores of
680 or lower (both far lower metrics than the averages management quotes on
earnings calls)
Based on the language in the deck, BOFI appears willing to go even lower than 680
FICOs… we note that these scores are far lower than the 700 level that Experian
claims usually reflect "good credit management"
We were also surprised to read that BOFI allows "anyone to pledge assets on behalf of
the borrower"
We note that while the presentation we found mentions that BOFI offers "pledged
collateral loans" at up to 90% LTVs in numerous instances, BOFI's 10-K from FY2014
suggests that under 1% of BOFI's home loan balance outstanding consisted of loans
with >80% LTVs…

We therefore wonder whether BOFI's financials accurately reflect the credit
quality (LTVs and FICOs) of its loan book…
We hope that in the future BOFI will provide enhanced detail in its financial reports,
including the segmentation of its loans (QM vs. non-QM, types of non-QM etc.),
enhanced clarity on LTVs, and enhanced clarity on borrower credit worthiness
Direct excerpts of BOFI's underwriting guidelines are provided below:

Potential Management and Organizational Credibility Issues


We believe that CEO Greg Garrabrants may have misrepresented his work experience
in his official BOFI biography (found here), which if true calls into question his
credibility in managing a highly regulated entity such as a bank
Based on our review of BOFI CEO Greg Garrabrants' official biography, we believe
that he may have misrepresented his work experience by claiming to have practiced
law at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and at Munger, Tolles & Olson
As readers will recall, Scott Thompson was forced out as CEO of Yahoo (YHOO) after
falsely claiming a Computer Science degree in his biography on the company's
website
We think that this potential discrepancy could be a concern given that the company's
website is picked up by SEC filings and CEOs are required to sign off on SEC filings
Our research suggests that Garrabrants' bar license (and ability to practice law / refer
to himself as an attorney) was only active from June 2001 to January 2002
We confirmed that Garrabrants was employed as a clerk for the Honorable Steven
Wilson from August 2000 until August 2001 (confirmed through a phone call to Judge
Wilson's office)
After completing his federal clerkship in August 2001, we believe that he went to work
at McKinsey in September 2001, pointing to the extremely low likelihood that he could
have worked as a practicing lawyer at either Skadden or Munger during the ~6-7
month period his bar license was active. We therefore believe that his claim that he
practiced law at both of these firms appears to be untrue
In our view, Garrabrants is potentially aware of the inconsistencies in his official
company biography as evidenced by the fact that he utilizes two distinct versions of his

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 11/31


biography - one version on BOFI's website (that has been picked up in the broader
media), and a different version in SEC proxy filings
While in his official BOFI biography on the company's website Garrabrants purports to
have been an attorney at Skadden and Munger, the term "attorney" is notably
missing in the biography Garrabrants provided to the SEC for use in BOFI's
most recent proxy
See the Appendix at the bottom of this article for a side-by-side comparison
A quick search on the CFA Institute website also suggests that Garrabrants is
potentially unable to claim the CFA Charterholder designation (which he includes in
both versions of his biography)
Finally, we note that BOFI's Chief Accounting Officer left in May 2013. BOFI never
hired a replacement for this role, instead appointing current CFO Andrew Micheletti to
the role of Chief Accounting Officer
We find it surprising that despite serving as the active Chief Accounting Officer at
BOFI, Micheletti's CPA charter appears to be inactive. He may potentially be breaching
California Accounting Board protocol by failing to specify that his license is inactive in
his bio
Right around the time that BOFI's Chief Accounting Officer resigned, BOFI changed its
auditor from Crowe Horwath to BDO USA… we think that the CAO resignation and
auditor change raise potential questions around what is going on with BOFI's
accounting organization…
BOFI's COO also resigned in January 2014 and we found no indication that BOFI hired
a replacement
We note BOFI loan growth appears to have kicked into "hyper-drive" right after the
CAO resignation and auditor change. Therefore, a significant chunk of BOFI's loans
are still unseasoned and in the "too early to tell" credit quality bucket. Bulls who rely on
historical net charge off data are missing that BOFI's loan growth has been so robust
recently that historical charge offs are likely to have poor predictive value
Furthermore, BOFI's reserve ratio has been moving down since the shakeup in the
accounting group despite BOFI's 62% y/y loan growth. This relationship makes
absolutely no sense to us. As a reminder, reserve ratios are calculated by taking
expected future losses on loans divided by the current size of the loan book. In the
case of BOFI, the denominator (loan book) is clearly growing, meaning that
management is implicitly assuming that its newer loans carry less future risk based on
its decision to take its reserve ratio metric down. Given the nature of BOFI's loans
highlighted in this note, we have a hard time believing this reserve policy is appropriate

Connections to Troubled Banks & Stock Promoters and Potential Related Party
Questions


We note that the BOFI management team has deep ties to troubled banks, including
Chief Lending Officer Brian Swanson (formerly Indymac), Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Micheletti (formerly Imperial Savings), and of course Greg Garrabrants himself
(formerly Indymac). Our review of LinkedIn profiles suggests other members of the
bank were formerly at Indymac as well
Both Garrabrants and Swanson obscured Indymac on their resumes, with Garrabrants
referring to it as the "7th largest thrift" in his bio, and Swanson referring to it as "a top 5
mortgage lender"
We note that while BOFI sports an impressive >$1B market capitalization today and is
covered by firms such as FBR, KBW, Sandler O'Neill, and Raymond James, the
company appears to have been an off-the-radar microcap stock just last year
In fact, as recently as 2013, Greg Garrabrants was out promoting BOFI through
Tobin Smith's penny stock website (see this interview between Tobin Smith and
Greg Garrabrants). We note that Tobin Smith was fired from his job at Fox News a
few months after his interview with Garrabrants for taking payments from microcap
companies to pump their stocks…
For readers who are interested, Tobin Smith was recently mentioned at an investor
conference in Chicago

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 13/31


Our research also suggests that there may be potential undisclosed related party
dealings between BOFI and one of its largest shareholders
The shareholder in question states that he owns Westlake Financial, which is listed as
a BOFI distribution partner in public presentations on BOFI's investor relations website
Westlake Financial also appears to offer compensation to individuals who open new
accounts with BOFI (Netbank is a BOFI brand)
Despite what appear to be potential business dealings between Westlake Financial
and BOFI, there is no mention of any related party connections in BOFI's financial
filings, nor are there any mentions of related party connections in the shareholder's
13D filing
The shareholder in question also appears to have been the only non-insider who was
invited to participate in an October 2012 private convertible funding round
While we have found no definitive evidence of any wrongdoing, we do think that
enhanced disclosure around the relationship between the shareholder and BOFI could
potentially benefit investors
We also noticed that the bank had ~$10.9M of related party loans to principal officers
outstanding in FY2014 (collateralized by property). The interest earned by BOFI on
these home loans amounted to $141k in FY14, suggesting that the annual interest rate
on these loans to principal officers was only ~1.3%. We note that a 1.3% rate seems
very attractive relative to market rates for home loans, and even more attractive
relative to the 5%+ rates BOFI charges on its home loans


Summary and Price Target


In summary, we think BOFI's management team appears to have real credibility issues
In our opinion, BOFI is misrepresenting the types of loans it makes, under-reserving
against future loan losses, providing incomplete financial disclosures to investors, and
running an aggressive balance sheet in which loan growth is far outpacing deposit
growth
Some bulls on BOFI view the relatively light levels of insider selling (particularly by
Garrabrants) as a positive sign. We point readers to the case study of Indymac,
Garrabrants' former employer. The former CEO of Indymac famously did not sell stock
as subprime problems were brewing, and actually meaningfully increased his stock
holdings as late as February 2008 when subprime problems had already clearly
emerged… as a reminder, Indymac was ultimately one of the largest bank failures in
U.S. history
BOFI's non-QM loans are fraught with risk (particularly "ATR" risk which is difficult for
lenders to challenge in court)

5/19/2018 BofI Holding: Will Regulators Strike? - BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ:BOFI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 14/31


BOFI's reserves appear too low in context of the nature of its loans and its massive
loan growth and we expect a material downward revision to BOFI earnings as the loan
portfolio seasons, interest rates normalize to historical levels, and regulators potentially
step in to curtail the nature and pace of BOFI's loan growth
While we have focused on the asset side of BOFI's balance sheet risk in this note,
previous online commentators have highlighted the interest rate sensitivity risk in
BOFI's balance sheet (i.e., BOFI's outlier interest rate gap ratio)
The company also recently reported a loan-to-deposit ratio (a measure of risk and
liquidity) of over 120%, which puts BOFI on the extreme far end of the spectrum in
terms of loan-to-deposit ratios for California-based banks (the average California bank
has a 78% LTD ratio)
Despite our view that there are warning signs of aggressive accounting and regulatory
risks, BOFI continues to trade at an egregious bank multiple of ~3x TBV despite BOFI
having, in our view, a far higher risk business model than comparable banks that trade
at only half of BOFI's valuation
We find the recent strength in the stock perplexing in light of the October delay of the
H&R Block deposit transaction. Our concern is enhanced by statements at recent
Sandler O'Neill investor meetings in which management said that their biggest concern
right now is regulatory risk
We view the H&R Block delay as a sign that the regulators may be taking a harder
look at BOFI and its high-risk business model
We see substantial downside in the stock (~65%) as we believe that BOFI should
trade at a discount to thrift peers as a result of its risky loan book and interest rate risk.
We ascribe a value of 1x TBV to the stock (arriving at a price target of ~$27/share)

They used to be aggressive when they were making RV loans in the '90s but things have changed. They are
aggressive but conservative now. Finding some quote from 2011 by an underling does not make a case. In case you
did not notice, Freddie and Fannie just announced easier lending standards--FICO scores of 620, which will allow
BOFI to sell loans. As you point out, their FICO scores are well above average. Most of their loans are syndicated
loans from other banks. The credit quality is akin to Regions Financial and Zions. You are suggesting BOFI will
decline 65% and sell at 5x earnings. Earnings are adding $5 to BV every year.


In case you are not aware, there are bank examiners in residence at the bank who review reserves and loan quality
quarterly. A bank cannot be free wheeling anymore. Trivial matters of resumes are a reach. You have been short for
some time and I guess it is not working for you. WE expect a short seller bash now and then from you. I suppose you
will use a downdraft to cover and move on.

I can not square your portrayal of BOFI and Garrabrants as reckless maniacs with how they've actually behaved in
the last decade.


For example, during 2005-2007 they were saying, "the market is nuts", everyone is being crazy, we will not
participate, this will shake out eventually. They patiently bought seasoned whole loans to avoid risk and paid the price
in the form of razor thin margins and a terrible ROE. For several years. Then the market imploded. Hurting them NOT

AT ALL, and enabling them to snatch up profitable opportunities. That happened. And BOFI's credit metrics have
remained pristine, like 99.9% outlier pristine, for a decade.


So BOFI has transformed itself from exceptionally prudent to exceptionally reckless, virtually overnight?


Maybe. There has certainly been a lot of change. But that puts the burden on your evidence. (And I think culture is
easier to maintain in an operation w/ just a few hundred people.)


Now, the key question is these strangely high yielding non QM assets. What are they? Are they super high risk? Or
are they extremely mispriced i.e. a niche BOFI has found and exploited?


Because, you know, there are a lot of rich Chinese nationals and rich old people in the US that may simultaneously be
non-QM (thus high spread) and yet excellent credit risks. So which is it? Risk or niche?


Ya know, a relevant question is: what's BOFI's asset allocation track record like? Were they reckless during the
bubble? No. Did they take advantage of the recession? Sure: remember all those discount MBS they bought and
reaped windfalls on? What happened after that? Well, they said, "we see opportunities to expand in some niche non
QM spaces". And so far they've done exactly that. And credit metrics remain absolutely pristine.


So these studs just all of a sudden are going buckwild? Hard to believe.


Now, what I can't rule out is regulatory risk. If their hyper profitable niches are harmed by new rules, or new force in
interpreting existing rules, then sure, they could get squeezed.


I wish you'd write just about that instead of slamming a thousand things at the wall to see what sticks. If you're right
about regulatory risk please convince me! I'm open minded.

The piece you are missing here is that Garrabrants did not become CEO until October 2007. So you there
was a different team running BOFI during previous housing bubble. Secondly, they did not start making these
quirky non-QM loans until June 2010 when they hired the old Thornburg mortgage team to go out and
replicate that model. Thornburg, by the way, blew up back in the previous downturn and was accused of
having misleading financial statements.

The article has the distinct tenor of desperation. I found lots of innuendo, repeated many times, and some
misrepresentation. A PE of 5 on a 20% growth stock then stretches any credibility of the piece - if it ever existed.


BOFI stock price has been relatively flat the last year. I sense a real worry that earnings and book value will continue
to increase quarter, after quarter, after quarter. BOFI is certainly a volatile stock that might seem attractive to short.
But for a growth operation, time is definitely not on the short sellers side.

Extremely well written article. I have been following BOFI for some time and I never understood why Citron and
Kerrisdale never addressed the asset side of the balance sheet. Their loan book earns over 5% when 5/1 Jumbo
Arms in California are around 3%. They are earning a 2% spread (huge in this interest rate environment) because
they are lending to foreign nationals and doing other quirky loans (asset depletion, asset amortization) that no other
banks will do. And there is a reason no other banks will do them, because there is a TON of regulatory risk around
there. BOFI thinks these are low risk loans because they take low LTVs. But they are completely dismissive of the
regulatory risk around these loans (foreign national mortgages are fraught with money laundering).


Someone should forward this to the regulators. I have to believe they already know about this, particularly with the
HRB transaction. That being said, with the OTS being shut down and merged with the OCC, I believe their first audit
with the OCC was just completed in July 2014. I wouldn't be surprised if we heard back from the regulators in the near
future on this. With 60% loan growth, that in and of itself will alert the attention of regulators.


It's amazing, you would never know that BOFI was doing these sort of loans by reading their 10-K and listening to
their conference calls. They pitch this Costco affinity relationship and the sell-side loves to talk about this. I remember
reading a research report that said that their loan book is of high quality because they loan to Costco members, who
are more affluent than Wal-Mart shoppers. Beyond that being an absurd statement, BOFI does not hold any of the
Costco loans on its book, it only holds the quirky loans which is why they can have loan yields of above 5%.


Your background check on the CEO and CFO are very interesting. Speaks to the fact that they feel they don't need to
play by the rules like everyone else. The problem with this is that they are a regulated entity! You can't be so flippant.


The Chief Accounting officer resigning right after the auditors being fired is the biggest red flag in the entire piece for
me. No one ever fires their accountants unless they won't do what you tell them to do. And then to hire BDO of all
people who have a reputation of being so hungry for business that they will do anything. Its interesting that they never
hired a new Chief Accounting Officer and the CFO just assumed the role. Probably because they didn't want
someone looking under the covers.


Nice work, at 3x P/BV for a company where longs don't know what they own, this should work out very nicely.

Maybe. But also, every other bank has tons of branches, and tons of back office support, all over the country.
The issue is managing risk enterprise wide, everywhere. The difficulty is not letting anything slip through the
cracks in some far flung suburban office complex. These guys all sit under 1 roof, I'm fairly sure - I'm not sure
that folks understand how this changes the compliance/risk/control dynamic, and i think it's fairly significant.


Like, other banks wont lend to really rich retired seniors with no income, because it's a slippery slope (ppl will
abuse it), and it's really a case by case basis anyways (for deciding to make that kind of loan). The
institutional controls you have to build to make sure that none of your offices are abusing this asset
generation channel is insane. So, you cant really have an enterprise-wide framework bc it's case by case, and
it's really hard to control for that across a gigantic corporate struture. But, is that too hard to control if all of
your underwriters sit in the same building? maybe not

is truly desperation as you try to cover before time runs out. You know that when the HRB transaction processes that
the stock is going to take off. Additionally, BOFI already released information supporting that their pipeline was
already 1.9% higher than last quarter's pipeline as of 10/31 putting this quarter into record territory again or at least
38.7% over last year. Check out the 8-k presentation released today (PDF page 28, document page 25:

While theoretically possible to verify that October 2001 is the right date, it's hilarious to me that you are so
confident that "not paying the dues" is a "technical glitch". As I read this post I thought, "Wait, would the CFA
Institute tell a random caller there was a technical glitch?" Nope, I checked. They simply tell you he hasn't
paid dues and confirm that he is inactive.


To CommentLA: Can you share your insights regarding said “technical glitch”? One person who would have
this insight is a CFA Institute employee. That being said, I doubt that a CFA Institute employee using the
CommentLA handle would comment in March 2014 “…BofI will be the victor, and the CEO has $17MM of
stock to boot and he has not sold shares in the stock's meteoric rise over the past year” within their only other
SA post. More likely, the charter holder in question is behind this post.

I am a 72 year old man with more than a$1mm in cash and securities and I cannot get a mortgage. BOFI will lend to
me at a slight premium using an amortized schedule against my cash. I think this is far sighted lending and way
ahead of most banks. I am pleased to pay them a very slight premium. They also have my Real estate as security.
The Crossline presentation does not mention anything about regulatory risk and is uplifting as it outlines many of the
poor practices of the traditional banking industry. BOFI is solving the problem. The regulators love them. The latest
presentation as John notes shows 30 day non current loans and non accruals well below industry standards--you do
not publish such numbers unless they are correct or you can go to prison.


Note failure to mention business deposit base has grown from $468MM to $1700MM in one year a 263%CAGR. THis
is the fastest growing bank in U.S. with $4.8B in assets. Earnings are growing atv 40%+ and the P/E is only 14x. Bank
ratios are impecable. I think you shorts are pretty nervous as BOFI runs circles around sleepy slow moving traditional
bankers with empty lobbies and too many tellers. Check volumns 6-10% negative CAGR. BOFI is disruptive.

What a load of crap. If this is all he can come up with, I am even more inclined to invest in this company. READ the
documents in the links he provides. I have done so, and have not been able to verify ANYTHING he says!!! Here are
a but a couple examples of the outright lies:


He states: "we believe that in 1QF15 (CY 3Q14) we saw the first signs of weakness in BOFI's loan book (delinquent
loan balances doubled between 6/30/14 and 9/30/14)"


There is absolutely NO TRUTH TO THIS - read the quarterly report (10Q) that he is referring to for yourself - you can
download it here: http://bit.ly/1vmZnkX - On page 60 you will find reference to "total non-performing assets", which
have increased from 20.46MM to 25.06MM. What matters is not the absolute number, but the percentage of the total
outstanding loans that that number represents. That number also increased significantly at that same time. Non-
performing loans have increased slightly from 0.57% to 0.62% of the total. For comparison, according to the Federal
Reserve, the average non-performing loan percentage in all banks in the US as of that same filing date was 2.13%. At
less than 30% of that, BOFI's delinquent loans are FAR BELOW those of the average bank!


In ANOTHER LIE - as well as dramatic misrepresentation, he states: 
"Lending Guidelines - "90% LTV Loans" at "680 FICOs…but we're flexible!"", clearly implying that they give 90% loans
to people with 680 fico scores. First off, there is no mention in the document ANYWHERE of 90% LTV loans - the
HIGHEST LTV that they list as available is 70%! In the example he is using to make this claim, the borrower is paying
10% in cash and assigning an additional 20% of assets to the bank. The bank is then loaning the borrower's own
money back to them (at the going interest rate)! That's every bit as secure as a pure 70% loan (but a clever way to
help a borrower make the purchase without having to liquidate assets, and at the same time, increase the bank's
income with zero added risk - I'm starting to understand why these guys are able to make so many loans)!


I could spend all day tearing apart this crap - Foreign nationals are NOT given high risk loans - they have to verify
their income, and can get a MAXIMUM 60% LTV loan! Again, it's right there in the document that he provides the link
to.


If you are AT ALL inclined to believe ANY of this BS - check the facts - he is short the stock and is trying to tear it
down. If you check the facts, I suspect that you'll end up being pretty damned impressed with the company.

I would like to know more about regulatory risk. Certainly something is scaring banks away from the niches
BOFI exploits. I'd like to understand that better.


And no one like to see an auditor and CFO bounce nearly in sync.


But it's tough to think clearly about the interesting stuff when we're drowning in BS.

Simple Insights,


I highly recommend reading this article from a lawyer at National Mortgage News for more on regulatory risk
in making non-QM Loans.


http://bit.ly/1vokZNL


The Emerging Non QM Problem 
Many lenders touting so-called safe origination practices for loans made outside the legal safe harbor for
"qualified mortgages" are relying upon practices that are simply insufficient to protect them legally.


Most are using approaches that focus upon one particular area of risk (ignoring the others). In some cases
lenders are also using “safeguards” that regurgitate old protections that did not work before and will not work
in the future.


For instance, lenders relying upon 24 months of bank statements to verify income on a non QM loan may well
be guarding against claims that the lender did not verify income. However, if the borrowers' true expenses are
not accounted for, the income-based verification will not establish the ability to repay as it examines only one
part of the equation.


Other lenders are using forms for borrowers to sign to certify the borrower’s ability to repay. Such disclosures
are more of the same – documents that get added to the stack that borrowers have to sign to get the loan –
and they suffer the same shortcomings that made them ineffective in the past.


Even a residual income analysis, standing alone, does not offer the necessary protection. Such an analysis
does not guard against the “I did not understand” or “they did not tell me” claims that would enable borrowers
to back-door into a non QM-based defense.


Indeed, if a borrower claims the lender failed to explain a loan was adjustable or that the good faith estimate
was filled out after they signed it, or that they were promised a refinance —all of these claims will allow a
borrower to assert an ability to repay defense to a non QM loan as an alternative theory for a jury to consider.
A jury that believes a borrower was misled will have little problem concluding that the lender lacked the
requisite belief in the borrower’s ability to repay.


The bottom line is that in order to safely originate a non QM loan, a lender needs to develop procedures that
better document the loan file, utilize third party or independent oversight, and address income/expenses in a
common sense matter that allow average persons to recognize the lender was legitimately trying to make the
right decision.

“Good faith" is not difficult to demonstrate as long as the procedures that lead to the decision are
demonstrably above board and insulated from self-interest.

Thank you swinston, very helpful.


Garrabrants talked directly on this matter during BOFI's 1Q14 CC. Below, for those interested, is what he
said. My comments are in brackets.


-----------


We are very bullish about loan volumes in our business generally. We are particularly bullish about the jumbo
mortgage business because we believe that multiple regulatory and competitive factors provide strong
tailwinds to our business. Despite the occasional sporadic deal, the securitization market is not an effective
alternative to balance sheet lending at this time.


The enhanced capital requirements at larger banks are driving many of them to exit businesses and reprice
loans, and many potential competitors are discouraged by the wave of complex regulations, specifically
related to the qualified mortgage rules coming into effect in this January that are not well correlated to the risk
on individual loans.


[What he's saying is that some non-QM loans are lower risk than some QM loans.]


Becoming qualified mortgage rules sale to specify any particular loan-to-value ratio, and the income
guidelines that were essentially copied from FHA guidelines are not well tailored to the unique and complex
financial situations of high-end jumbo borrowers. For this quarter, our non-interest income continues to show
the diversity of our platform.


[Though the QM criteria are numerous, LTV is not one of them. Secondly, there is no flexibility in the QM
critiera: if debt service exceeds 43% of pre-tax income, it is non-QM, period, no matter how low the LTV, now
matter how great the borrower's assets relative to the size of the mortgage.]


*BTW, for those lagging behind, QM regulations define that set of criteria which, if validated/documented by
the lender, give them legal invincibility with respect to that relationship. By venturing outside of QM-invincibility
the law gets more subjective. That's all.


**Again, CLEARLY the regulatory issue related to BOFI's non-QM book is the most interesting thing here! It is
either a big, nasty risk. Or it's another instance of this management team's ferocious skill, adaptability, and
flexibility at swapping between asset classes as the winds shift.

From from BOFI on jumbo/qm/regrisk from 2Q14 CC:


Well, I'll take the regulatory changes first. The QM side of things, I think the potential impact could be
interesting. We've been seeing continued growth and the demand for our product before QM came into being.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 25/31


And so I can't say right now that I can attribute any particular loans to QM per se. But I do see continued
growth in our customer base and in the demand for the product.


So I would like to give specific reasons as to why that's the case, but I will tell you we've spend a lot of time
improving and expanding our internal sales operations, the way we market our products, the technology and
the ease-of-use, the customer service responsiveness and all of those sorts of things.


So I think that there are people going to do business with people who don't do a good job for them,
particularly on the jumbo side, because those customers tend to be use to being served in a particular
manner. And just like in wealth management or other things, if you don't serve them in that way, you may
permanently offend them.


So the idea that they're going to have to wait 60 days for an underwriting answer and things like that, and
then get an answer and not be able to talk with someone about the conclusion, the no sorts of things, they're
problematic. So I think we have a really good formula and a model and it involves continually looking at those
operational elements and making them better. And that's been reflected in what's happening in the pipelines.


Gregg Hillman - First Wilshire Securities Management 
And can you explain briefly what QM is?


Gregory Garrabrants - President and Chief Executive Officer 
Sure. The QM rule has two separate components. One component, which is commonly called the ATR rules,
is a set of rules that requires that an institution appropriately document the ability of a borrower to repay a
loan. And what that effectively does, it outlaws loans that had been made in certain respects that were
problematic in the crisis, which would include no income, no doc loan types, that were widely available during
that 2006, 2007 timeframe. And it basically states that you have to document a borrower's ability to repay.


Now in our case, we never did no documentation loans. We always requested every piece of documentation
that we possibly could, including tax returns from the IRS and everything else. So that really didn't changed
anything that we did. Then the next thing that it does is it states that there is a particular way you need to
compute income and that mechanism of computing income is essentially in accordance with what was
historically FHA guidelines for the computation of income.


So for example, we did a loan for a borrower who owned a significant piece of a multimillion dollar market
capitalization insurance company. They owned more than 50% of this insurance company, we did their loan.
None of that income, none of those income or assets would have been able to be calculated as income for
the utilization of the loan under the Appendix Q to the QM rules, because those rules were designed for
thinking about a borrower with a day job, who didn't owned businesses, didn't have subchapter S
corporations, didn't have an investment portfolio, didn't make a significant amount of variable bonus income.


So the attempt has been made to apply these FHA standards, which were always designed for a very
different borrower to all borrowers and as a result of whether those loans pass through different
characteristics, they received different levels of legal benefits associated with those, which include a
presumption that you've appropriately calculated the ability to repay, a repayable presumption that you have
the ability to repay, and no presumption that you have the ability to repay.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724995-bofi-holding-will-regulators-strike 26/31


And in each instance there is as an assortment of penalties that could arise if you have not calculated the
ability to repay, but the precursor to all those penalties is that you have to have not calculated the ability to
repay, which we always do. So for those of you who are on this phone and who have felt tortured by that, I
apologize, but there really isn't a quicker way to explain it, because it's a bit complicated.


[So the bottom-line here is this: is BOFI consistently adequately documenting ability to repay? We can't know
that directly. But the most powerful piece of evidence we have is BOFI's long, superb record of competence,
contrarianism, and risk aversion. Bears: you need more evidence than you've shown.]

Simple Insights,


I spend a lot of time looking for banks who earn an outsized return and trying to figure out how sustainable
that return is. I am trying to do the same but am having a hard time finding the information I need to properly
analyze BOFI.


For example, if you look at Provident Financial Holdings (PROV) filings, they give the following disclosure in
their 10-K (despite saying they have immaterial non-QM exposure):


Mortgage reform rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act became effective in January 2014, requiring lenders
to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower’s ability to repay any consumer closed-end
credit transaction secured by a dwelling and to limit prepayment penalties. Increased risks of legal challenge,
private right of action and regulatory enforcement are presented by these rules. The Bank originates an
immaterial number of loans that do not meet the definition of a “qualified mortgage” (“QM”). To mitigate the
risks involved with non-QM loans, the Bank has implemented systems, processes, procedural and product
changes, and maintains its underwriting standards, to ensure that the “ability-to-repay” requirements of the
new rules are adequately addressed.


Then they give an incredible helpful table that breaks out what % of their loans are interest only, stated
income, FICO less than 660 and over 30 year amortization. They give you weighted average FICO, weighted
average LTV and weighted average seasoning by bucket.


http://bit.ly/1FQP61J


The only disclosure I can find in any BOFI's public filings about non-QM loans is they state they do jumbo
interest only (which by definition are non-QM) which makes up ~25% of their SF mortgage portfolio. They give
no disclosure on the other 75%. In order for me to invest in BOFI, I would need much greater detail on what
this other 75% is. How much are these Foreign National loans, how many are tied to borrowers who have
previously had a bankruptcy or short sale? Without better disclosure from the company, I don't think there is
any way to effectively determine the regulatory risk at this bank.

swintston, I'm sympathetic. Disclosure quality varies lots among small banks. Skimpy disclosures don't merely
make analysis hard, they're also associated with poor underwriting. For example, everyone did TDR's
(restructurings) differently during 2009-2011 and those with skimpier disclosures ultimately showed higher
future credit losses, on average.


I get that. (And I recall Provident's pristine accounting actually.)


But skimpy disclosures are a much more powerful warning sign when accompanied by a syndrome of other
worrisome factors; prior regulatory problems, persistently poor ROE, credit loss provisions that look like 0,0,0,
BOOM!, ridiculous stuff like errors in arithmetic in 10Q's, or some sort of motivation to hide something. (signs
of incompetence in general)


Now, I admit that BOFI has flashed a few weird symptoms recently: the CFO and auditor swap outs in
particular. (BDO, too. If BDO's reputation is indeed poor, I admit surprise that BOFI would affiliate w/ them,
from what I think of BOFI.)


However, having followed the company since ~2006- and I know this is unglamorous to admit, I know theses
are supposed to be based on 30 pages of modeling and stuff- I trust BOFI. It's implausible to me that their
proven (proven not just in terms of results, but the reasoning underlying their choices) competence, risk
aversion and far-sightedness could be lost so quickly.


And there is a plausible explanation for their discreteness: you don't want others to reverse engineer your
strategy.


You think the sustainability of 15-18% ROE's is sufficiently uncertain to avoid BOFI at 2.75x book? Perfectly
rational. Can't blame you.


My gripe is with those who confidently rule out BOFI's sustainability (and the possibility that BOFI is run by
ferociously competent, adaptive asset allocators w/ a uniquely flexible platform), and who think there's strong
evidence of something lurking in their loan book.


The bears are ignoring the big picture. When the direct fundamental evidence is murky, take a step back and
look at an institution's decision making track record.


(By the way: ever looked at SMBC, or PKBK? Also, you seem smart: care to share your best current idea? I'll
freely do same if anyone is interested.)

Very amusing. I am still trying to sort through this b/c both sides seem convicted and probably invested. Feels like a
political debate where people are picking facts and saying this isn't true, that's not true.


Example is last post saying delinquencies doubling in prior quarter has "no truth to this" and then citing a completely
different statistic of non-performing loan data only up a bit. I just scanned the Q that he provided a link to, the 30+ DQ
balance did double from 15M to 30M. Its on page 32. Presidential candidates would be proud!

Also like the notion that he is a CFA charterholder that maybe hasn't paid his dues in 5-10 years. Last I checked, they
make me pay those every year to keep in good standing and I seem to recall a whole section of the exam dedicated
to properly using the designation. Have to cross the T's and dot the I's. But I'm sure one can cut a check with back
dues this week to get in good stead. If they do cross regulatory lines, I'm not sure the clean up would be as easy.


On the plus side, can't argue with security selection in 2009 and underwriting the past few years. Have done some
things quite well. Results speak for themselves. Do question the 06 or 07 decision to leave GS for IndyMac...not all
good underwriting, but can understand why they won't specifically say the name in bios. Not sure I would either. At
least would not want to.

According to Item 2. 10-Q Nov. 4, 2014 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The weighted average LTV percentage for our entire real estate loan portfolio was 55% at September 30, 2014 . We
believe that this percentage is lower and more conservative than most banks, which results in lower average
mortgage loan charge-offs when compared to many other comparable banks.


The best I could find for comparison was Freddie Mac 2014 YTD Weighted Average Estimated Current LTV Ratio
(Percent) of 67%. (Data as of Sep. 30, 2014).


To the author of this article:


Can you comment on what you think of this assertion put forth by BOFI's management?


06 Dec 2014, 11:17 AM 


gleepbeep
Obviously, the LTV metric is more meaningful during periods where real estate is NOT overvalued. Currently,
there is not much of a housing bubble, so LTV is perhaps more meaningful.


From 10Q Nov 4, 2014 Furthermore (Dollars in thousands):


The Company provides general loan loss reserves for its recreational vehicle (“RV”) and auto loans based
upon the borrower credit score at 
the time of origination and the Company’s loss experience to date. The allowance for loan loss for the RV and
auto loan portfolio at September 30, 
2014 was determined by classifying each outstanding loan according to semi-annually refreshed FICO score
and providing loss rates. The Company 
had $13,560 of RV and auto loan balances subject to general reserves as follows: FICO greater than or equal
to 770: $3,421; 715 – 769: $4,502; 700 – 
714: $1,043; 660 – 699: $2,401 and less than 660: $2,193. 
The Company provides general loan loss reserves for mortgage loans based upon the size and class of the
mortgage loan and the loan-tovalue

ratio (“LTV”) at date of origination. The allowance for each class is determined by dividing the outstanding
unpaid balance for each loan by 
the loan-to-value and applying a loss rates. The LTV groupings for each significant mortgage class are as
follows: 
The Company had $2,222,015 of single family mortgage portfolio loan balances subject to general reserves
as follows: LTV less than or equal 
to 60%: $1,290,619; 61% – 70%: $775,927; 71% – 80%: $132,293; and greater than 80%: $23,176. 
The Company had $1,097,555 of multifamily mortgage portfolio loan balances subject to general reserves as
follows: LTV less than or equal to 
55%: $496,006; 56% – 65%: $359,799; 66% – 75%: $227,964; 76% – 80%: $11,077 and greater than 80%:
$2,709. The Company divides the LTV 
analysis into two classes, separating the purchased loans from the loans underwritten directly by the
Company. Based on historical performance, 
the Company concluded that originated multifamily loans require lower estimated loss rates. 
The Company had $17,271 of commercial real estate loan balances subject to general reserves as follows:
LTV less than or equal to 50%: 
$9,230; 51% – 60%: $5,715; 61% – 70%: $1,425; and 71% – 80%: $901.

As an aside, FICO itself is a dubious measure. It is possible to have ample assets, a spotless history, and still get only
a "fair" FICO score if you pay cash for major purchases and heavily use and fully pay off your credit card accounts
each month for minor purchases. FICO is geared to rewarding people who have a lot of medium to long term debt that
they are paying down, and does not necessarily identify excellent credit risks who avoid debt and act responsibly.
Many retired or older people, having paid off their homes and cars, and having a nest egg, may have little to no debt
service except for credit cards they pay off each month, and thus so-so FICO scores, but nonetheless be excellent
credit risks. Hard to see that in the FICO-correlated filings, although the banks can see it in the details of the loan
applications. I do not know if this situation is relevant to BOFI's loan portfolio.

Don't care about audit changes - BDO is better than Crowe in my mind so it is an upgrade.


BOFI website clearly says that the portfolio LTV if 55% for multi and 57% for single family. These numbers have to be
right because of the regulators. Deposit base is 50% checking which is good.


I think what people don't understand is how the company generates such high ROEs. But you can look on the
website. BOFI NIMs are 4% versus peer average of 3.57%...so higher but not crazy higher. Efficiency ratio for BOFI is
30.99% versus peer group of 68.76%....that is where are the ROE juice is coming from. Their business model is just
lower cost due to lack of branches.

The SA article is stretching because they can't wrap their head around the ROE and P/B multiple of BOFI. But
comparing their multiples to a traditional bank is difficult because there are structural differences in the way they do
business.


There is also very little insider selling and Burke owns 8% of the bank and is largest personal shareholder. BOFI could
be disruptive, and if it is, it can be very big as its market share is fraction of 1%. It may be the Microsoft of banking.

Oh wow. So, H&R Block's prepaid card business is the tax refund business. So, the government is issuing refunds to
HR Block, who is giving prepaid cards to folks as refunds (if they want them). I know this b/c in their 2015-06 10k, they
said the liability balance ranged between 400m and 1.7b in 2015. And, on april 30, 2014 it was 745m (2014-06 10-k).
So the balance shoots up in january/feb, as detailed in their 2013 10-k, and then declines as folks spend their refunds.
that's what BOFI bought. so you clearly do not have the same kind of regulatory problem here - for HR Block, issuing
a prepaid card is no more difficult for them than issuing a tax refund, and obviously they have govt approval to issue
prepaid cards in lieu of checks.


H&R Block, a tax company, was regulated as a S&L b/c of their inhouse HRBank. This sucked, b/c they had to have
65% of time-averaged assets in single family homes for every 12 month period. So, this tax company had to hold
$400 million in MBS in order to run their inhouse bank - b/c, again, the S&L is just the vehicle for their refund
business, it's not a mortgage lender. Very capital intensive. I don't know why they had an S&L in the first
place...maybe it used to have a favorable regulatory regime/cost structure. post-crisis, they had to deal with additional
regulations,etc from Dodd-Frank and the transfer of oversight to the Fed/CFPB, which included th fact that they had to
get Fed approval every time one of their subsidiaries wanted to pay a dividend to corporate HR Block. makes sense -
very capital intensive, regulatory costs going up, have to wait for Fed approval every time u want to make a dividend...


So, they decided to sell it. They had the $440m in MBS per S&L requirements, and they sold those and gave that
cash to BofI to assume HRB's liabilities. In short, HRB just gave BofI the business - transferred an equal amount of
assets/liabilities, and gave BofI the exclusive right to offer HR Block-branded products through HR Block's tax
services business. Why? Because it's too small and weird (balances shooting around from 400 m to 1.7 b every year)
that no bigger folks want it, and they wanted to maintain their own branding (i think), and also they weren't trying to
make a profit from selling the business unit, they jsut wanted to get out from under Fed supervision and release $400

million in capital (which crushed their return metrics, Im sure). its not like HR Bank was a big money center for them,
it's just a service that they have to offer to their customers. But, if they can release a lot of capital, and the unit wasn't
making money anyways (and probably cost them $ - regulatory costs are overbearing, especially if you don't have an
underlying lending business to support them), and have a 3rd party bank do the service for them, why not?


I think it's also iportant that BofI is operating HR Block-branded banking products. Like, everything is still HR Block,
but BofI operates it behind the scenes. Kinda like private-label banking...


clearly this is not a case of "nobody else wanted it, b/c the business is so bad and the regulators will kill them." these
are tax refunds we're talking about...and what a beautiful niche! very consistent revenue year in / year out (death and
taxes kinda thing), spike of cash flow every jan/feb, and BofI can basically do expense arbitrage to make it profitable
in it's own right. and also, liabilities are probably lower than stated - if someone doesnt spend their prepaid card in the
1st year, it's probably in a shoe box in the basement and will never get used. but thats cash that BofI wont actually
have to pay out. Like, gift cards are a great business for retailers. BofI basically just got the equivalent of a recurring
gift card business, where the US govt is the issuer of the gift card

Re your last point, I may be mistaken but I believe that it is may now be illegal to simply keep "breakage" in
PPD cards. I am not sure what happens if every attempt to contact the card owner fails. That is, whether
unspent funds on a card go to the issuer or to some gov't fund or elsewhere.


On another point, some percentage of the people who get the refunds on a PPD card continue to use the
card thereafter. What percentage depends on how easy the card is to use, and what features and benefits the
card has. So the tax issuance is a marketing program for ongoing acquisition of PPD card users, as well as a
Q1 bump.
