Closed End Funds


We are short both Cornerstone Total Return Fund (CRF) and Cornerstone Strategic
Value (CLM).


Cornerstone Total Return Fund (CRF) and Cornerstone Strategic Value (CLM) are two
closed-ends funds that pay a large "dividend" stream to investors which typically
consists mainly of the investors' own capital. Because many investors are hungry for
yield, these funds have often traded at a large premium to their underlying net asset
value (NAV).


Currently, investors in these funds are paying more than $1.40 for each underlying dollar
of assets held by the funds. Only two closed-end funds trade at comparable premiums,
PIMCO High Income (PHK) and PIMCO Global StocksPlus and Income (PGP). The
PIMCO funds have an annualized trailing 5-year net return (by NAV) of 9.77% and
10.61%, respectively. In contrast, CRF and CLM sport an annualized trailing 5-year
return (by NAV) of 1.10% and 1.78%.


I suspect that most investors in the Cornerstone funds simply don't realize that they are,
in essence, paying $140 (or more) for $100 worth of stocks, managed by a mediocre
fund manager, who invests their capital in fairly average equity investments, racks up
annual expense ratios of 1.74% (CLM) to 2.36% (CRF), and then returns $21 to the
investor each year (about $1.75 each month), which is largely generated by selling
some of that $100 worth of stocks.

The end-game for such a fund is obvious. Unless the fund manager chooses
investments very well and generates extremely high returns (which is clearly not the
case with Cornerstone), the fund's asset base will shrink year after year until (1) the fund
slashes its monthly payout to slow the shrinkage, or else (2) the fund shrinks so much
that it decides to close. Unless, of course, the fund can find new suckers--oops, I mean
investors--to buy new shares directly from the fund company at a price above their net
asset value.


Cornerstone has mastered the art of selling new shares of CLM and CRF. What
knowledgeable investor in their right mind would they sell these shares to? Why none, of
course. So they don't sell to knowledgeable investors--they sell to the current owners of
CLM and CRF, using a rights offering.


In 2010, Cornerstone announced a rights offering for CLM and CRF shares, which
ultimately gave holders the right to add to their position at a 10% discount to the market
price, which was still a significant premium to NAV. From June 28, 2010, when the
preliminary SEC filing was made, to December 10, 2010, when the rights offerings were
completed, the market price of CLM fell from 10.61 to 9.15 (an 8.1% drop when adjusted
for dividends) and the price of CRF fell from 10.37 to 8.03 (a 17.9% drop adjusted for
dividends). Meanwhile, the S&P 500, which is reasonably similar to the fund's holdings,
gained 16.4% over the same time period.


Those who owned CRF and CLM shares when the rights offerings were filed, and did
not recognize the bright red flashing "SELL" sign, saw their holdings underperform the
market by 24 percentage points or 34 percentage points, respectively, in the next four
and a half months. Ouch.


The academic literature offers ample evidence of high premium closed-end funds
severely underperforming during a rights offering, so this underperformance should not
have come as a surprise to anyone paying attention.


Last year's rights offering was poorly subscribed (surprise, surprise, surprise), and now
it's another year, and Cornerstone's management has to figure out how to get their
funds' dwindling asset base back up. So, after the close of June 28 (CRF) and during
the trading day on June 29 (CLM), Cornerstone has filed with the SEC for two new
rights offerings which will be nearly identical in form to the 2010 version.

What do you think is going to happen to the shares in the next four months?


So, we are short CLM and CRF. I wouldn't recommend that anyone try to follow our
trade. The shares are hard to borrow, and the cost of borrowing them is high. Because
of the danger involved, it is a very small position for us.


If, on the other hand, I were long CLM and CRF today, it would be a very easy decision
to sell them any day the market is open. If you must own CLM and CRF (WHY?), then
why not keep 100 shares, participate in the rights offering, and oversubscribe for as
many shares as you'd like? If this rights offering goes anything like the last one, you'll be
able to get as many shares as you want at much less objectionable prices.

I have owned CFP for about six months and it has been pretty sweet. We will see, but I think
I will be going back into one of the three funds. Good luck to all!

I once profited from being short the stock and the rights for one of these Cornerstone funds.
However, the moment I realized that I was facing potentially unlimited liability (depending on
what the rights owners decided to do), it was the most nerve-racking moments in my
investing career. Fortunately, the rights I was short went undersubscribed, but I'll never risk
that again.

For a you haters of CLM, CRF ,CFP. I see that on November 1st 2011 they are allowing
dividends to be reinvested at the net asset value. It seems to me that these fund are doing
the same as all other ETFs and mutual funds in the market at this time. There all down 30 to
50% form there 2007 highs. And yes the premium is high on all these funds but if your
waiting for them to fall you will be waiting for a long time. They have been at a premium
since 2003.

There has only been token insider buying at CFP. The main insider Ron Olin sold his stock
as fast as he could.


The fund will not pay a $1.20 dividend for 5 years. They only have $5.45 in assets per
share. They will cut the dividend and the stock will get crushed.


I don't know where you get your 30 year history. CLM came public at a split adjusted $40 in
1987. It is now $8.77. It was a bond fund until 2001.


Current management took over fund in 2001 with stock around $35. It is now $8.77.

Author's Reply Gman,


1. The 17% dividend you are getting is a return of YOUR OWN CAPITAL, and therefore
drives the NAV lower every time they pay it. Without the company selling new shares,
there'd likely be very little NAV left five years from now.


2. The insider buying in these funds is a trivial expense for management compared to how
much in fees they collect for keeping this thing going. The buying serves to retail investors,
"hey, we think this is a good investment." I sincerely doubt anyone managing this legal Ponzi
scheme thinks it is a good investment.

CRF, CLM and their newer CFP all are the same. CFP pays out roughly 17% yearly
Dividend of $1.20, so really, holding this stock Long you'll gain and erase the NAV upfront
premium. This stock pays for itself in 5 years with re-invested Dividends, from then on, it's
free money. Seems like a good deal to me. 
I do notice ALOT of Insider Buying, so that tells me if they are willing to buy it, it must be ok.
CLM and CRF have been around since the 1980's, they made it through all the ups and
downs for 30 years, I dont see them closing up shop anytime soon. CFP though is brand
new, we'll see.

Shorting these funds is difficult and the rights offering makes it very risky as pointed out by
Flipper. But do not forget these are basically index funds. NAV has stayed constant with the
stock market rising. When the stock market falls the NAV (and dividend) will fall sharply with
the premium likely to evaporate.


The chances that someone long these stocks outperforms the market over the next 5 years
is very close to zero.

CRF has been selling at this high premium for almost two years and the NAV is mostly
holding. I suspect that the referred to ignorant owners of CRF will continue to hold as long
as the NAV does not tank.


Paying a 14% dividend plus 10%+ interest on the short? How long can one afford to wait?


Then again it looks like CRF usually lowers the dividend in the winter. After which you might
pick up a dollar or two. Maybe.... but why not wait until the fall.

hmmm...well you are giving away secrets.


Game Theory same as Russian Roulette on shorting here, no question. The liability is off
the chart relative to the potential gain, IMHO. Not a well balanced risk/reward. If you cuase
your Prime Brokers short box to go negative over shorting then it opens up a massive
situation. You can not replace those rights.

Author's Reply Fliper,


That's a very good point. That's why I'm not telling people to run out and short these names.
It takes does take some finesse. (There's some nice game theory that goes on with the
oversubscription option. I don't want to give away all of our secrets, but let's just say we
dealt with it last year, and we'll deal with it again this year).


Anyone who is long here though would be crazy to hold onto more than 100 shares, as
those shares that are now at a 40%+ premium will soon be at a 10-20% premium, less a
10% rights offering discount. Sell almost all now, buy at lower prices later. Effectively, that's
always what happens in a rights offering; it's just that CRF and CLM do it in slow motion,
since so few retail investors understand what's going on.

IMHO, you are nuts to be paying 20-30% negative rebates to short this. You are betting on a
collapse of premium that only happens if everything else collapses.


AANNNDDD.....Short into an NON-transferable rights offering is INSANE. You can be held
liable for all the shares owed PLUS a huge over-sub. NYSE rules says you owe what they
client was due. Short 6k and the guy's shares you borrowed wants 200k shares on the
offering (and assuming would have gotten them on the deal) guess who is going to be short
200k on Monday AM after the deal? And AT the deal price. It happened to a friend of mine
15 years ago, got hit for the commission too. It was a serious loss. It is true Russian roulette,
and to pick up a point or so.....crazy I feel.

Their model would work except for one thing...you can not reinvest your dividend at NAV.
They are dumb NOT to do rights offering with a massive premium, they are highly accretive.


With them paying 21% at NAV creates the illusion of high income but constantly selling new
shares a massive premium adds a lot of value (out of thin air) to the NAV. Thus adding to
their blah portfolio.


You lose only if you sell and the premium has decreased and and the fact you get 21% of
your money back at NAV. If they allowed dividends to be purchased at NAV it could be an
internet model.

Some retail brokers offer to pay stock lending fees to IRA accounts of their high net worth
investors. I would imagine they keep most of the fee paid by the short seller for themselves.
For most securities, the lending rate is pretty low, but I heard of an offer of 10% for CRF a
few weeks ago, and much higher for stocks like LKND.

I paid 130% for GM and Citi once. It is all rigged.


You need to be a VERY sizable account to collect fees. Likely you need a short
credit of $5m plus to have them even talk to you. They can take your stock mostly
without paying you a nickle thx to fine print.


You bet they keep it for themselves. PLUS they take the short credit you produce
and lend it to margin acct for 5-8%. It is an old wall street ugly secret...something for
nothing.

Author's Reply George, I'd rather not say exactly how much, but it's a goodly bit. It varies
day-by-day, and especially as the monthly "dividend" nears. If most of the retail investors
who own CRF or CLM realized how much hedge funds are willing to pay to short them, I
think they'd have a second thought about owning these securities.


As you probably know, if our fund were to be long such terrible securities, we'd earn stock
lending fees from our prime broker for letting them lend our shares out. It's only fair that the
entity bearing the risk of owning these funds is compensated with the stock lending fees.
But, if you are a retail investor (as nearly all of the investors in CRF and CLM are), and
Schwab, Fidelity, E-Trade, Ameritrade, etc. makes a pretty penny lending your shares out,
those retail brokerages generally keep the stock lending fees for themselves.

Also if you are doing street borrows to short this and borrow a goldman Sachs
traders stock trading firm capital and the NON-transferable deal is under-subscribed
and he wants a million shares...guess who is going to be short 1m shares at the deal
price on Monday after the deal? There is a DIRECT trance to your shares. No
dancing around that one.
