Whitney Tilson: Why We Covered Our Netflix Short

When the facts change, I change my mind - what do you do, sir?


-- John Maynard Keynes


In mid-December, we published a lengthy article on why Netflix was our largest bearish
bet at the time. With the stock up nearly 25% since then, one might assume that we’d
think it’s an even better short today, but in fact we have closed out our position because
we are no longer confident that our investment thesis is correct. There are three primary
reasons for this:


1) The company reported a very strong quarter that weakened key pillars of our
investment thesis, especially as it relates to margins; 


2) We conducted a survey, completed by more than 500 Netflix subscribers, that showed
significantly higher satisfaction with and usage of Netflix’s streaming service than we
anticipated (the results of our survey are posted here); and  


3) Our article generated a great deal of feedback, including an open letter from Netflix’s
CEO, Reed Hastings, some of which caused us to question a number of our assumptions.


In summary, while we acknowledged in our December article that Netflix “offers a useful,
attractively-priced service to customers, is growing like wildfire, is very well managed, and
has a strong balance sheet,” we now believe that it is an even better business than we
gave it credit for. The company has enormous momentum and substantial optionality (for
example, international growth), and management is executing superbly. In particular, we
tip our hat to Reed Hastings, whom we had the pleasure of meeting last weekend. In
addition to his success building the business and navigating the transition from DVD-by-
mail to streaming media, he’s also one of the most down-to-earth, honest and
straightforward CEOs we’ve ever encountered. 


To be clear, in covering our short and writing favorable things about Netflix in this article,
we are not recommending purchase of the stock. Many things will have to go very right for

the company to justify its current market valuation, but we no longer think it’s wise to bet
against Netflix. 


This is particularly true in light of our belief that this market is filled with much better short
opportunities that are in our sweet spot: outright frauds (our very favorite), industries in
decline or facing major headwinds, weak or faddish business models, bad balance sheets,
and incompetent, excessively promotional and/or crooked management. It’s so much
more rewarding, both psychically and financially, to short these types of businesses. 


Our Short Thesis 
Our short thesis was predicated on the following stream of logic:


1) Netflix’s future depends on its streaming video business (rather than its traditional DVD-
by-mail business); 


2) The company’s streaming library is weak, which would lead to customer dissatisfaction
and declining usage; 


3) This would either cause subscriber growth to wither or force Netflix to pay large
amounts to license more content, which would compress margins and profits; 


4) Either of these two outcomes would crush the share price. 


We are no longer convinced that #2 and #3 are true.


Customer Satisfaction With Netflix’s Streaming Service 
To measure the quality of Netflix’s streaming movie library, we looked at the top 50
grossing movies of all time, Internet Movie Database’s 20 top-ranked movies of all time,
Rotten Tomatoes’ 20 top-ranked movies of all time, and the 10 top-selling, top-renting and
top-video-on-demand DVDs for the week ending 11/28/10. In our December article, we
shared our findings: “of these 120 movies (including duplicates), Netflix has a mere 17
(14.2%, and 0% of the current most popular movies) vs. 77 for iTunes (64.2%), 63 for
Vudu, 62 for Amazon, and 41 for cable.” A similar analysis for TV Guide’s list of the 100
most popular TV shows showed that Netflix streamed fewer than 25% of them. 


Thus, we concluded that Netflix’s streaming library is weak and customers would be

https://seekingalpha.com/article/252316-whitney-tilson-why-we-covered-our-netflix-short 3/34


dissatisfied and reduce their usage of the streaming service – but our survey of more than
500 current Netflix customers revealed increasing usage over time and reasonably high
satisfaction:


In response to question #8, Compared to the first month that you started using Netflix’s
streaming service, has your usage changed?, 36% of respondents said they were
streaming more than twice as much, 25% said somewhat more, 23% said it’s about
the same, 12% said somewhat less and only 4% said less than half as much. In other
words, 61% said they were using the service more and only 16% said less. (For
details, see appendix A; all of these percentages exclude respondents who said “I’m
new to the service or don’t stream.”)


In response to question #9, Overall, how satisfied are you with Netflix’s streaming
service?, 40% said highly satisfied, 40% said moderately satisfied, and only 11% were
dissatisfied. While these are lower satisfaction levels than Netflix’s DVD rental service
(our survey showed 65% highly satisfied and 24% moderately satisfied), Netflix’s
customers are much more satisfied with the streaming service and are using it much
more than we expected.


The most commonly cited explanation by the Netflix customers in our survey for their
increasing usage and overall satisfaction is that they appreciate the easy-to-use, widely
available service and perceive good value. For a low monthly price – typically $7.99 or
$9.99, less than the cost of a single movie ticket and a tiny fraction of their cable bill – they
can have unlimited access to nearly 20,000 movies and TV shows. While many
respondents complained about the weak streaming content, most seemed to understand
that at such a low price point, they’re not going to get the latest, hottest movies like Avatar. 


Here are some representative comments from our survey:


Needs more & better content, but everyone knows that!


I believe we get what we pay for.


Not enough selection and not enough updates. Still great convenience & video quality.


I can watch what I want, when I want, for a price I can afford.


Great value, simple, problem free, no advertising.


Easy to use, good selection, and getting better all the time. It’s the best deal out there,
even with the recent price increase.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/252316-whitney-tilson-why-we-covered-our-netflix-short 4/34


Streaming itself is great. The library of streamable choices is lacking, especially for
movies. Once you get hooked on a TV show Netflix carries, though, the streaming is
awesome!


I’m not married to Netflix. I would easily switch to a carrier with the fastest and widest
selection of titles. The flip side is I haven’t tried other services because Netflix is easy.
I’m not a tech expert and don’t even know what Hulu does.


Good product at good price. Online quality is much better than I expected. Lots of kids
content to stream (don’t need the latest). Netflix finds TV shows that I may like but did
not know existed and/or would not rent as DVDs. Have gotten rid of the expensive
cable bill as a result.


Margin Compression 
In our December article, we pointed out that Netflix was paying increasing amounts for
streaming content, which pressured margins in Q3 10 – and we predicted that this trend
would continue. We wrote:


Our belief that the increased costs of streaming content will negatively impact
Netflix’s margins isn’t just a theory. Last quarter, strong evidence emerged to support
our view: in Q3, Netflix’s operating margin was 12.6% and net margin was 6.9%,
down from 14.9% and 8.4%, respectively, in Q2. That’s a huge decline in only three
months. 
 
The result was a 12.5% sequential decline in earnings from $0.80 in Q2 to $0.70 in
Q3.


When Netflix reported Q4 earnings on January 26th, we were exactly right about the
impact of higher streaming costs on gross margin, which fell to 34.4%, down from 38.0%
year over year, and 37.7% sequentially. Yet the margins that count, operating and net,
rose to 13.1% and 7.9%, respectively, up from 12.6% and 6.9% in Q3 10. How did this
happen? To our surprise, marketing expense fell to 10.5% of revenues, down dramatically
from 15.9% year over year and 14.7% sequentially. 


Of course, any company can goose its margins and profits in the short term by slashing
marketing spending, but this usually triggers a fall-off in sales and customers. Yet this
didn’t happen to Netflix: in Q4, the number of paid subscribers jumped by 2.4 million to
18.3 million, up 53.5% year over year and 15.2% sequentially, both the highest levels
going back more than four years. Subscriber growth isn’t merely high, but it’s accelerating.
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We Covered Our Netflix Short - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/252316-whitney-tilson-why-we-covered-our-netflix-short 5/34


Such a large gain in subscribers fueled at 34.1% year over year jump in revenues, the
highest percentage gain since Q1 07. 


This surge in subscribers and revenues is creating a virtuous cycle for Netflix, both in
terms of word-of-mouth buzz (which is, of course, the best – and cheapest – form of
marketing) and financially. Allow us to explain the latter. In our December article, we wrote
the following:


Netflix’s Dilemma 
Why is Netflix’s streaming content so weak? The primary reason is that, unlike its
competitors, Netflix isn’t willing to pay what content providers demand for the best
movies and TV shows. For example, Netflix’s competitors typically charge $4.99 to
stream a popular movie, of which $3 goes to the content provider, and the
economics are similar for the $1 TV shows. 
 
But this model doesn’t work for Netflix because it’s only charging $7.99 per month for
unlimited streaming. Given that content providers aren’t about to slash their prices,
Netflix has three choices, all of them unpleasant:


1) It can have a weak library and maintain low prices, or 
 
2) It can license better content and pass the cost along to its customers, which
would crimp growth, or 
 
3) It can license better content and eat the cost, which would hurt margins.


Netflix’s Q4 earnings report underscored for us that there is a fourth possibility – one
which is very pleasant for the company: high subscriber growth leads to higher revenues
and profits, which allows Netflix to license more/better streaming content (without
sacrificing margins), which leads to even more subscribers. 


To see how this might work, let’s consider the scenario in which Netflix continues to grow
its net paid subscribers by 2.4 million for each of the next four quarters (9.6 million
incremental). Last quarter, the average paying customer generated $11.64/month in
revenue (based on $596 million in revenue divided by 17.1 million average paid
subscribers). Let’s assume that the new customers are mostly signing up for streaming (at
$7.99/month), so that the average revenue is $10/month: that’s an incremental $1.15
billion in annual revenues for Netflix.

Comments (112)


It’s harder to estimate the incremental profitability these 9.6 million subscribers would
generate, but we’d guess that it’s a high number, given that each additional streaming
user costs Netflix very little since its streaming licensing agreements are for fixed
amounts. Thus, robust subscriber growth would allow Netflix to spend many hundreds of
millions of additional dollars each year on streaming content– more than enough to renew
the Starz deal and license much more content as well – without impacting its profit margin. 


Of course, this rosy scenario depends on Netflix being able to continue to attract huge
numbers of new subscribers, which is far from assured given the possibility of saturation
and the many current and potential competitors that we highlighted in our December
article (since then, Comcast has launched a competing service for its customers, and
Amazon appears likely to as well). That said, Netflix has a big head start so we don’t want
to bet against its subscriber growth. 


Conclusion 
At today’s closing price of $222.29, Netflix is trading at 75.0x trailing EPS of $2.96. In
more than 12 years of managing money professionally, we can’t recall an instance in
which we paid more than 20x our estimate of normalized, current year earnings for any
stock – and this has worked very well for us – so we won’t be buying Netflix anytime soon.
But just because we don’t think it’s a good long doesn’t make it a good short.

Mr. Tilson,


I can only say that you are long-term right because NFLX can not be worth what it's current market value is.
Unfortunately, the USG made you short term wrong with QEinfinity.

run if you are wrong. As far as NFLX being overvalued, I compared it to CSCO here to show the absurdity:

Okay 
It's time to go short. He's out of his position.  
The trade to put on is.... in March options only....


Trade in the following ratio... based on your capital / pain tolerance. 
Sell two Mar c270 Calls ( $ 1.35).... Buy one Mar 195 Put ( $ 2.10).


If NFLX hits $250 ... exit trade... take loss. Go to another stock.  
If NFLX pulls back and the calls lose 50 % of value...exit all call shorts...  
and exit 1 put only.... This leaves you long with one put.  
Keep the one put.. see what happens.


Come on Netflix.. show me what you got left.

desire until the short interest in the stock decreases to a much more reasonable level. As of January 31, 23.46% of
the shares outstanding were being sold short. Until this figure comes down to around the 10% range, NFLX will not
fall.


We actually got long NFLX ahead of earnings, but as of today we have cut almost all of our long position on the stock.
While the short interest is too high, the stock could easily pull back to the 200 level before taking off again.

Well, I admire intellectual honesty in anyone for starters. I agreed with the original set of premises myself, in all but
one vital regard -- the timing of the short. The author violated the inverse of "never try to catch a falling knife" rule.


The situation is in some ways analogous to what happened with the RIAA. They were (and are) floundering with the
new models and tech. Steve Jobs comes along and makes the deal that saves them from their ignorance, which is
what it took. 
Yes, they stubbornly still do stupid things, but without someone with the clout to make that deal, they'd be almost dead
by now.


Whether Netfilx can do for the MPAA what Jobs did, or whether that will be some other outfit pulling it off is really the
big question. That is the only economic "moat" a competitor would have to cross. It's a large one, but once crossed is
the same as any other disruptive tech, it changes the game itself.


So while the short Netflix idea may have been a sound one -- the timing was wrong, and the understanding of the
industry overall situation a little lacking in important details.


There might be an opportunity in the future to go long Netflix, or whoever can cross that moat, instead. So far in my
view, no one has -- even Netflix.


I wonder if the reason they do well despite lacking some of the "top" titles is that everyone has already seen those --
and they go to Netflix to explore things more off the mainstream, where the marginal cost is very good for the
customer.


There is otherwise very little try before you buy in the video business...as there is (radio and the older music stores) in
the audio business. Netflix seems to be satisfying a demand for that, and I think that's key to their current success
and valuation.


I'm not a customer myself, but my friends who are say things like this, and I see demand for it even on my cable
connection -- my household loves a lot of very obscure things that didn't get play on mainstream media, and prefers
those (loudly) over say, the networks or Bloomberg.

I'm sure similar falling knife statements were made about Enron and Worldcom before their accounting truth
was uncovered. The street is indicating that something is amiss with NFLX. It may be valuation or business
model sustainability or insider selling or lack of transparency or something else. Hard to tell because the
Bernanke buying train is skewing the liquidity variable in thinly traded easily manipulated stocks like NFLX.
Time will tell.


The studios have not had a problem with the new century. They embraced digital delivery to theaters. They
embraced digital delivery sales of first and second tier movies to iTunes and Amazon On Demand. They
embraced 24 hour rental of digital copies of movies by iTunes and Amazon On Demand. They have
embraced a subscription delivery model for their content by creating Hulu Plus. As they roll it out to more
devices and add more content (Viacom just joined this year), NFLX will be affected. They just want to be paid
a reasonable amount for their intellectual property. They spent hundreds of millions to develop and nurture
their brands. Apple and Amazon are paying the going rates. Netflix is not.


Without a first use doctrine for streaming content, those who want to play in the arena cannot bypass the
studios distribution channels like they could with DVDs. That is why today they are happy to deal third tier
movies and previous season TV shows to Netflix. It provides another small revenue stream that they control.


12 Feb 2011, 07:44 PM


Freedoms Truth
In what way does a 300% increase in price indicate something 'amiss' with NFLX? Rather, it indicates that
NFLX is on a roll.


More likely than a 10 bagger from here, or a sharp fall, you will see it unfold that the current price is pricing in
much of NFLX future growth.

I continue to be impressed with you as an investor and manager. It is rare to see someone admit a mistake with such
an objective, honest and thorough public article. Although I have never held a position (long or short) in NFLX, I have
enjoyed reading your thoughts on the company- whether short-term right or wrong. I am sure this short NFLX position
was a tough loss for your fund, but the manner in which you have conducted yourself has not gone unnoticed. Well
done.


11 Feb 2011, 02:21 PM


Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, Contributor
Good, honest article. In this business, you really have to leave your ego and your emotions at the door if you want to
have any kind of longevity. It takes discipline and emotional detachment to take a loss like Tilson is doing here, but it
is the right thing to do. You keep your investors' funds intact and you live to trade another day. I've certainly had to eat
my share of crow over the years for calls that I had to reverse later. Readers and investors respect the honestly
though.


I agree with Tilson. Netflix is far too expensive, but I wouldn't feel comfortable shorting it. I might be a little biased
though because I just finished watching the Tudors on the company's streaming service :)

What about this:


"Netflix has surrounded itself with accounting issues, short seller Brecken says expecting the stock to fall"


11 Feb 2011, 02:47 PM


Bruce Whitaker, Contributor
Brecken has more concrete issues with NFLX than much of the theoretical posturing that has taken place on
both sides of the NFLX argument. Most of the reasons put forward for shorting NFLX are based on the
premise that earnings momentum is unsustainable and that new competition will drive up NFLX cost of doing
business. While these arguments are not to be dismissed, the most cogent argument has been given by

Brecken and other numbers people. While completely legal, the way NFLX accounts for the value of its library
is questionable.


For an oversimplified example, take a household who expenses its grocery purchases when it goes to the
store to buy them. We bought $200 worth of groceries and our net worth just went down $200. Our creditors
are concerned that we are living beyond our means. To make them happy, we will spread recognizing the
expense of groceries over a month since salad dressing and croutons sit on the shelf for at least that long.


The truth is that we ate the New York steaks, drank the milk and ate the fresh vegies within the first few days,
but that's alright because when we stop by for more milk and goodies, we will amortize the expense over a
month again. To make things look even better to our bankers, we will pay by credit card and not have to
actually use the cash until the end of the month. Presto chango, our grocery expenses have gone down. Our
checking statement has improved.


All of this works well until we move through a few weeks of applying this completely legitimate and legal
method for accounting for groceries. Eventually you will end up with the same weekly grocery expense you
originally had, but in the meantime, the numbers made your overall financial picture appear to be far brighter
than it was.


Please excuse the oversimplification. The only way to avoid normalization on this sort of accounting gimmick
is to increase revenue fast enough to offset the reality bite. As pointed out by Brecken, NFLX takes this even
further by increasing their top line by 30% while accounts payable have risen 100%.


Most damning to my way of thinking is massive insider selling that has taken place at Netflix. Everyone
seems to give Hastings a pass by saying that this is a common practice in the industry, but to me, it just
doesn't cut it. It is one thing the take money off the table when you are seeing huge gains in the value of stock
incentive compensation, but it is another to consistently exercise all options and sell immediately. Ask
yourself, if you owned a company that you had utmost confidence in and believed was destined to become
exponentially more valuable over time, would you be selling your interest in that company as fast as you
accrued it? It flies in the face of all reason.


When Barry McCarthy (CFO) resigned, he virtually liquidated his entire interest in the company. This was the
man who understood the accounting more than anyone else in the company and more than any outside
expert. When you see a train wreck coming, you don't wait until the last minute to remove yourself from the
train. The earlier you depart, the less culpable you will have been seen to be.


I don't blame Tilson for relenting. The money he lost shorting NFLX was mostly other people's money--other
people who were not happy with his stubborn refusal to capitulate. His timing was terrible and the financial hit
his fund took probably threatened to erode his customer base. His clients were more likely to forget what he
had done for them yesterday than to ask what have you done for me today? Private market participants have
the luxury of only having to answer to themselves.

Totally agree. What kind of answers are:


1. About half and half to the question of percent streaming vs mail usage for the quarter 
2. About the same to the question of churn


These are not hard numbers that you would get from most S&P 500 companies. They would at least show
slides with percentages or more likely actual numbers.


What are they hiding?

Stoic Perspectives, Contributor
A good article, but here are a couple of points that I had contention with.


First, you surveyed 500 current Netflix subscribers about satisfaction and found 11% dissatisfied. That tells you
NOTHING. If you survey the last 500 Netflix subscribers to quit, you'll find 100% dissatisfaction. The only thing
learned in that question is that the customers who are paying are fairly happy (obvious cause they are still paying!)
and 1/2 of the dissatisfied customers will likely leave, proving Netflix' own CHURN numbers of around 4%. Maybe the
11% is signs of CHURN getting higher?


Also as to streaming usage. Same bias. If you get something for FREE, you are going to do it more until you wear it
out, then hang around a couple months and quit. Current subscribers = using free stuff more and more until they get
bored of it.


You should have survey 500 Netflix quitters to see if you could identify if churn will go up or down due to the new
model.


Then you wrote "given that each additional streaming user costs Netflix very little since its streaming licensing
agreements are for fixed amounts". This is right in the short term and WRONG in the long term. Content provider
costs will likely grow in proportion to the number of subscribers upon each contract negotiation.

"This is particularly true in light of our belief that this market is filled with much better short opportunities that are in our
sweet spot: outright frauds (our very favorite), industries in decline or facing major headwinds, weak or faddish
business models, bad balance sheets, and incompetent, excessively promotional and/or crooked management. It’s so
much more rewarding, both psychically and financially, to short these types of businesses."


That comment (which makes a lot of sense) raises the question of why Tilson & Co. shorted NFLX in the first place,
since it wasn't in their sweet spot. One possible answer is that shorting a high flyer like NFLX generates a lot more
publicity than shorting a little-known smaller company circling the drain due to financial distress, fraud, or something

investor willing to acknowledge mistakes. That may lead to more than enough new business to make up for a ~25%
loss in one short position.

Am I missing something here, or does everyone on this article want to congratulate Mr. Tilson for being horribly
wrong? Last I checked this is a results-oriented business. I'm pretty sure if it was your money on the line you wouldn't
be patting Tilson on the back for losing 25% of it.

You're right, I know that if I was an investor in T2 partners for the last 5 months, where they underperformed
the S&P 500 by close to 30% (S&P up 23.5%, T2 down 4.3%) I'd be very very pissed. However, as someone
on the side, I'd be much more inclined to invest in his fund at this juncture. Everyone will have mistakes, this
one was a very very big one for him. However, it is very important that you learn how to deal with those
mistakes. Mr. Tilson clearly understands his mistake, and I doubt that moving forward he's going to repeat
that. In investing, sometimes it's more important to have a proper method than getting the best results in the
short term. For the former can lead to long term prosperity even if there are stretches of bad returns, but the
latter has a tendency to blow up in people's faces. I'd never ever short a stock like Netflix, because shorting
on value and not fundamentals requires timing more than anything (time works against the short of a
business with improving fundamentals). Tilson recognizes this now, and the way he was able to acknowledge
his mistakes and deal with the consequences in a quite responsible way indicates that he has a much better
approach (in my mind) than the person who was right but for the wrong reasons.


11 Feb 2011, 07:42 PM


Ananthan Thangavel, Contributor
Thanks for the well-reasoned response Tatertot. However, I must beg to differ.


Take a look at the stocks Tilson has shorted recently: NFLX, OPEN, LULU, to name a few. Every one of them
is a momentum, supposedly overvalued name. How he makes any money on his short book is beyond me,
most likely he loses alot. He hasn't so much learned his lesson as just given up, exactly what I said he would
do (seekingalpha.com/artic...).


Mr. Tilson's long bets have been good (BP comes to mind), but, in this case, I believe his bark is far worse
than his bite. I can't find many definitive numbers, but I don't think he manages even $1 billion. In the hedge

fund/asset management world, this is tiny. The only reason we all know who he is is because CNBC and
other outlets constantly interview him. His performance (9.1% annualized) is decent, but not anywhere near
good enough for him to receive the credit he does.

Tatertot
If you read his January newsletter, he details more his changes in methodology 
www.gurufocus.com/news... 
in particular, since the shorts have done him in (and you are right, his short book is costing him money at the
moment). 
"Where we have had much less success, however, especially in recent months, is shorting good businesses
that are growing rapidly, even when their valuations appear extreme. Such open-ended situations, regardless
of valuation, are very dangerous, so going forward we will avoid them entirely unless we have a high degree
of conviction about a specific, near-term catalyst."


He is also talking about how he had 60% short exposure, which will be reduced markedly moving forward. I'm
not sure I would invest with Tilson. I am very much a value investor and his talk is very much focused on
appealing to value investors, but I haven't done enough due diligence on his methodologies to see whether it
is compatible with my investing methods. Having said all of that, the discussion is completely academic
because I am but a poor college student at the moment, and hedge fund thresholds are significantly above
what I could afford for years, if ever.

Once they have millions and millions of streaming users, the amount they can spend on the library (not per person,
but the actual millions they can offer a Sony or Warner) grows to such an extent that the content owners will want to
get in.


What they will likely do is have premium tv shows for $0.50 each, and movies for 1.99. Fifty cents for a one hour TV
show is more than the networks get by showing me commercials (which no one watches anymore, with PVRs). So
why would a network refuse a cut on 50 cents/hour for a TV show? I can't figure out why the studios demand 3 times
the profit to watch a movie for 5.99 online, compared to the deal they get from a physical DVD rental from blockbuster.
If the studios think they can hold onto that price, I wish them happy dreams.


Netflix is doing what Apple tried to do and failed. Remember when Apple first came out with TV shows on the
AppleTV 2 years ago? The studios demanded $3 per 1/2 episode of a TV show! Then surprise surprise, no one
bought, and they dropped their price. But they still get about 3 TIMES what they get for an advertiser supported show.

I have a question. 
AAPL's p/e is around 19x EPS. No body else does what apple does, they are the leaders in their sector. 
NFLX's p/e is 78x EPS. Netflix was the leader of renting dvd by mail, but the transition to streaming would be
something different, Netflix is going to have more powerful competitors and in order to compete their profit margins
are going to shrink.


What is wrong with this picture?


I think Mr Tilson was right on his short premise, he was just early like he said NFLX is not on the sweet spot yet. 
And we have our own government artificially inflating the market with QE2. 
This type of bubbles never end well, when they burst NFLX is going to fall like a rock. 
But for now it was the right thing to cover the short, and wait for the right time, it will come sooner rather than later.


11 Feb 2011, 04:29 PM

I think the fact that AAPL sells at a far lower P/E than NFLX reflects how much more complex the business of
selling many $200+ products is vs. the simplicity of getting subscribers to pay $10/mo. for movie rentals.
AAPL does not have its own space like NFLX does. AAPL's competitors are fully grown. NFLX has no
competition of any stature, which is why each day over 25,000 new subscribers came to NFLX last quarter.
Jobs's health is also a small factor. AAPL / NFLX are still great buys: AAPL 2012 P/E is 14; NFLX's is 37.

While I have the utmost respect for Tilson and his value investing repertoire, this was not the type of trade for an
investor of his stature to get involved in the first place. The future of the NFLX business is extraordinarily difficult to
assess and it is an emerging growth company trading erratically on news flow.


Given what occurred 10-15 years ago with the Internet bubble, he should have known better. He simply got in front of
a strong quarterly report on a trade and got burned. I'd be interested for him to tell us if the stock had tanked 25%,

Kudos for accepting your mistake publicly. Not many people have that courage. You earned some respect from me
even though you might have lost some money. 
I would like to point out few things from your letter though:


1. Quoting Keynes: "When the facts change, I change my mind – what do you do, sir?" 
Well, the facts never changed here. Not within these 2 months. So I am not sure if you should have used this quote.


2. Your Survey Findings: "The most commonly cited explanation by the Netflix customers in our survey for their
increasing usage and overall satisfaction is that they appreciate the easy-to-use, widely available service and
perceive good value" . 
-- Looks like you believe only your own surveys. There were plenty of reputed surveys with far larger sample size
which have found the same results years back at least regarding satisfaction and value.


3. New Conclusions : "high subscriber growth leads to higher revenues and profits, which allows Netflix to license
more/better streaming content (without sacrificing margins), which leads to even more subscribers."  
-- Even average person like me can come to such conclusions. To make it easy for you Reed Hastings has already
stated the above conclusion in his earning calls/interviews.


I would still agree with you that valuations are higher for Netflix. But when we are searching for ways to understand
things which are beyond our comprehension, we should turn to wiser men. Warren Buffett has said that "Stock
Markets can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent". I think you needed this advice before shorting
Netflix.


11 Feb 2011, 07:34 PM


Ananthan Thangavel, Contributor
I think you're getting at the real point here...nothing changed with regards to NFLX! Mr. Tilson simply realized
how much money he was losing, and decided to cover. The fundamentals of NFLX did not change
whatsoever.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/252316-whitney-tilson-why-we-covered-our-netflix-short 17/34


The reasons he gives for ending his short position are a farce. Firstly, he says they conducted a survey of 500
NFLX subscribers. Are we supposed to be impressed? NFLX has over 17 MILLION subscribers. If he is
basing multimillion dollar investment decisions on 500 person surveys, I would run, not walk, away from him
as an investor.


His argument that the library was weak and that subscribers would start to wither was flawed from the start.
Exactly how do you have a weak library when subscribers are flocking to you in droves? Vote with your feet,
and NFLX subscribers voted.


Mr. Tilson is smarter than this. He published his original article on Seeking Alpha in a last ditch attempt to get
long holders to dump the stock. When that didn't work and the next quarter's earnings caused him an even
larger loss, he decided to give up, and now he's citing some phantom fundamental change.


12 Feb 2011, 12:56 PM

I infer two things from this.


1. Facts have not changed as much as this letter makes it out to be.  
The new findings do not really negate the earlier findings - competition when it emerges will still reduce growth (once
it emerges - which i have to admit is not happening) and content producers will demand higher prices commensurate
with Netflix's viewership - at least the larger ones who can and are saying that they will.


2. Mental pressure of being on the losing side of a short trade was perhaps too much. Although Mr Tilson is not
saying that. 
Since market madness can propel the stock to even higher levels, he did want to be in a position to explain to his
investors as to why he is short something like NFLX. As another commentator mentioned above, people who were
short mortgate stuff in 2005-2006 had a difficult time keeping their investors waiting (for the eventual payoff). Read the
Big Short and you will see the pain suffered by professional investors who shorted that stuff.


Some thoughts on likely competition.


Once competition emerges, Netflix valuation will deflate.


Amazon is the most likely competitor (having purchased Lovefilms and being exposed to losing the DVD sales
revenue). Of course there are many others - Walmart with Vudu's purchase and facing same declining DVD sales,
Apple with the many millions of customers and having indicated that they want to part of media selling to consumers,
and Google with Youtube viewership are all likely contenders. Among these, Amazon and Apple can very easily offer
a plan along the lines of $10 per month for 5 hours of video - view anything among the few thousand available for
streaming. And then offer the next few thousand for a substantial discount to such regular viewers. And all of these
players have deep pockets.


Deep pockets are important because a competitor will not be able to earn enough in the first 1-3 years so as to afford
to pay for content. A competitor, to effectively compete with Netflix, will likely have to subsidize the service, give away
TV connecting device (a-la-Roku) at a discount and perhaps offer a discount on video-on-demand to their monthly
subscribers.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/252316-whitney-tilson-why-we-covered-our-netflix-short 18/34


After all this, it would still be cheaper than buying Netflix. Say a competitor subsidizes for the first two years to the
tune of $200MM a year by way of extra content spend, subsidize up to $100MM by way of $50 per TV connecting
device to the first 2MM subscribers. Do that for two years and one is looking at $600MM of investment. There will be
few $100MM of cost in pulling together the site, the interface, the backend etc. We are looking at no more than $1B in
building out the business.

Interestingly Mr Tilson states he favours "outright fraud" for shorts. Naturally enough if we could spot 'em but of
course we often don't know until its too late, do we Mr. Madoff.


Even more interestingly I recall Mr Tilson stating that Interoil Corp (IOC) is one of his big short plays.


Is it a coincidence that this company with its promise of assets in the back of beyond is run by an individual who is
somewhat "hot". Far be it from me to suggest to anyone that searching for "Interoil" and fraud on google would result
in a picture thats far from pretty. But you never know in this world, who's wearing the swimming costume and who's

Hey Guys,


I am new here so go easy on me. I read the article and I read all the comments so far. I kept looking for the issue that
may be the big issue for Netflix...... and nobody mentioned it. I think it should have been one of the important
measuring sticks as to whether Netflix can sustain their success over the next few years.


As you may know the Feds changed the net neutrality rules about 2 weeks ago. Nobody knows yet what the result will
be.


My point is that if Netflix does everything else right, and they can't deliver quality streams to the end user, their current
user base can turn on them in what will seem like a wildfire.


As an end user myself, I have had a Netflix account for 3 years now, but only use it to rent DVDs. Why? Because I
have a 55" Samsung TV and my wife watches all the shows with me. We mostly (99%) only watch the HD channels.
(Even the DVDs I rent are lower picture quality than HD programming from Comcast and RCN).


I don't stream movies from Netflix yet, but sincerely want to once the picture resolution is equal to HD programming
from my cable provider. The picture resolution one receives from Netflix depends on what device you are using and
there are MANY devices that stream Netflix, but none that I know of that meet or exceed the cable company's HD
programming.

It could get worse.


Now here's the kicker. What I should have thought you guys would be looking at, is whether the ISPs who were just
given an opening by the Feds to throttle the speed, will indeed throttle the speed.


The ISPs feel that Netflix has been getting a free ride, and the Feds just gave the ISPs an opening to change that.


I know it upset the Netflix CEO enough that he published a threat to release the actual download speeds of all ISPs
that serve Netflix to end users. The following day, he released it.


Here are links to the article with his threat followed by his release of the data.


Is Netflix trying to embarrass certain ISPs? 
news.cnet.com/8301-310...


How Well Does Your ISP stream Netflix? 
news.cnet.com/8301-310...


Why have you not paid any attention to this outside threat towards Netflix?


With Comcast's recent acquisition, they have placed themselves in direct competition with Netflix. Did you know that
Comcast wants me to watch my streaming through Comcast's streaming service, not Netflix's?


Please share your thoughts on this issue.


Thanks,


RWS

this is also a serious risk.  
since people will fight any direct imposition of costs on them, this cost increase on Netflix can perhaps be only
imposed via charges on Level 3 (or the peering partner that sends the Netflix traffic onto the ISPs).


i think most people here agree that risks that can puncture this absurd valuation are many. the key question is
whether those risks will become real before the short holders lose patience (rightly so because the company
does increase in value every day - at least until such time as there is credible competition).


---


i wonder also why people have not discussed the possibility of competition from AAPL or AMZN along the
following lines. 
- both of them already have streaming rights for a fees 
- why not offer a plan that involves monthly subscription for say $8, offer 8 hours of video to choose from a
large enough library, and then on top of that offer discount on regular streaming. 
- in this way they may not have to drastically alter their terms with the content suppliers, and still be able to
compete with Netflix 
- I for one find Netflix content limiting and miss the fact that Netflix does not offer the add-on option of
streaming movies for cheap

12 Feb 2011, 09:38 AM


Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
agree with RWS regarding the impending increase in "pipe" costs to maintain current quality (let alone
improved quality) stream. NFLX has not only benefited from content costs fixed at low levels prior to
conversion to large population of streamers (upon renewal or new purchases these content costs will become
far higher just by switch to variable costing or even a ratcheting up to higher fixed cost) but also pipe costs
fixed at low rates as well. Again a move to variable costs will raise NFLX pricing to better reflect streaming's
high and growing usage of capacity. Furthermore, the current low cost 'buffet' that exists in US broadband
space does not flourish in the international markets. Netflix's valuation - now greater than $12 billion - implies
a very high required rev stream off of current high margins for greater >14-year continuous subscription
horizon over a base of subscribers >50 million subscribers. Based on the current NFLX subscriber base and
the number of US households with a broadband connection that could support streaming, this subscriber
number requires substantial international growth. Obtaining and then maintaining these subscriber numbers
while maintaining current margin levels and for the requisite > decade time period - LONG ODDS. NFLX may
have a head start on competition but the party wont last forever. Who will get the last empty chair??


14 Feb 2011, 09:11 AM


Technical Analysis is Voodoo Investing
I feel that Reed Hastings hit the nail on the head with this statement:


" I have to agree with my friend Whitney that there are many risks ahead for Netflix, that our valuation is substantial,
and that it is possible that one could make money shorting Netflix today. But shorting a market leading firm as it is
driving a huge new market is a very gutsy call."


The problem with shorting Netflix, is that despite being overvalued, its "true" value continues to climb at an incredible
rate. There is a huge risk that by the time the price falls from over-valued to true-valued, the true value has climbed
past the price at which the stock was shorted.


In other words, you short Netflix now, then you had better pray that the price drops to the true value soon, or you are
going to lose money even if you are right.


I think that is the point of Mr. Hasting's summary.


12 Feb 2011, 02:11 AM

Which is exactly why Mr. Hasting's stock sales are a continuous activity. He too doesn't know when the music

5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We Covered Our Netflix Short - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha

but you just shouldnt short bubbles before they actually burst... they can always keep getting bigger...

Shorting in the strongest bull market (or bear-market rally depending on perspective) since 1999 is a schoolboy-error.
Especially shorting a stock with 30%+ short interest. Short squeeze NFLX to $500!

Tilson is a class act. Long BP when everyone is shorting. Shorting NFLX and back out a trade that is not working. I'm
very impress with his style and philosophy.

We are getting close.


Tilson capitulated, nflx just hit all time high, wait for the short squeeze that always follow a new high, then time to go
short. Use options to cap your risk.


78 P/E who are we kidding....

Over 20% of the float traded today. Another sign of capitulation? Tomorrow will tell.


14 Feb 2011, 04:32 PM


bilton
Looks like fear (or smart opportunism) is following yesterday's apparent capitulation. Over 10% of the float
traded in the first hour erasing over half of yesterday's gain.


Still some outrageous pumping news coming out of Cramerica. On MM last night, Lime Networks said it can
handle all NFLX traffic given 2 to 3 months notice. What? Imagine big communications companies coming out
with a statement like that. But apparently it warrants repeated mention on CNBC this morning like it is a
revelation.

Wilson may write an articulate, classy article, but that doesn't get back the $40,000 that he led me to lose on Netflix
alone. He recommended the short in a Forbes column in September when the stock was at 132. I thought that
shorting at 148 should be a grand idea. Here we are 80 pts later. And this is only one of three colossally stupid shorts
recommended in the same article! IOC has done nothing but go up while he shouts "fraud", hoping for the crowded

theater effect, and GMCR, which he recommended to short at 32, is now 42 and rising. How does he make any
money as an adviser when this is the kind of advice he makes??? 
I have canceled my Forbes subscription (all of the short recommendations in it have only been losers for me) and I
will run the opposite way of this guy every time in the future.


12 Feb 2011, 05:19 PM

Not to defend the advice but you are to blame not Tilson or Forbes. You chose to listen and then made a poor
choice not to exit the trade when it went against you. I will defend his track record of over 170% gain in ten
years. Apparently he could afford the pain that you are whining about now.

Why blame someone for your loss in NFLX? Even a minimum amount of study would have left you to believe
that shorting NFLX was dangerous. When a company's stock takes off, the P/E has to jump-it's because
reliable estimates of revenue and earnings 2 or even 3 years down the road show growth that tends to get
recognized at today's price. Are you aware that though NFLX's P/E is now 78, its current P/E for 2012
average estimate is only about 37, based on $6 earnings. I can't understand why some people in this
discussion aren't focused on future earnings. Isn't investing about the future?


13 Feb 2011, 08:38 AM


Joe Morgan
yep, and NFLX is expected to earn $9.00 per share in 2013...that implies a forward P/E of 25.


13 Feb 2011, 11:55 AM


Ananthan Thangavel, Contributor
Mr. Tilson certainly did not understand this point before committing a large amount of his investors' money.


13 Feb 2011, 12:58 PM


winemanjmr
How does this guy make his clients any money??? He recommended this short, along with IOC and GMCR, in a
September Forbes issue, and they have done nothing but go up, losing thousands for investors like myself. A pox on
his house!

I think your poll was wrong because it did not ask the right questions. People will leave Netflix when they can
subscribe to a full tier service from Hulu, Amazon, or Apple. As a Netflix subscriber for many years, I know I will
because the current streaming offering sucks. Recently, my household's only use of Neflix is to stream previous
season episodes of TV shows that we just became interested in but that can be done in a couple of weeks. My wife
used to watch DVDs but the one a month selection just sits on the shelf. We get second tier movies, live music, news,
and sporting events on DirecTV. Cord cutting will have limited life because Netflix will never be able to deliver live
events. There is too much sponsor money paid for them. You cannot go to the local bar to watch concerts and
performing arts award shows


Netflix thinks they will use subscriber base to bully this industry. Good luck with that. Just like the financial industry,
big media always gets its way. They used Amazon to eventually get an extra $0.30 per song on iTunes. They will use
Hulu or Amazon to do the same to Netflix. A clue was when they blocked Google TV from viewing their websites. It
sent a message that this is not public domain content. We control the vertical. We control the horizontal. Welcome to
the NFLX Twilight Zone.

I think some of the readers don't seem to be getting the main point of the article. Whitney Tilson is not telling you that
he's ready to jump on board and buy netflix and that netflix is not overvalued. Mr Tilson has realized that it is simply
too dangerous to short an excellent company on valuation alone. He is also telling you indirectly that shorting is not
his specialty.


In late 2008/2009 Mr. Tilson's shorts probably saved his fund by making him money and allowing him to aggressively
go long at the 2009 lows. However, I believe that this short term success from shorting companies probably taught
him SOME bad lessons (that he seems to be quickly remedying now -- KUDOS to him). In shorting Netflix Mr. Tilson
was playing with fire and forgot his core competency. As he acknowledged making money shorting stocks should be
tougher than being long (especially in a bull market and especially if it is not your specialty). Mr Tilson's core
competency is being a Value investor -- this is what he does well and he should stick to it. Shorts should represent
only a small portion of his portfolio and should serve mainly as a hedge.


12 Feb 2011, 09:30 PM


Ananthan Thangavel, Contributor
I agree with your point. Mr. Tilson seems to be a very adept long investor. After reading his report, his long
holdings and his reasoning for holding them are sound.


13 Feb 2011, 01:00 PM

ok .. finally Tilson is out .. now we can short it on the next spike up .. put spreads for the brave

Why don't people focus on a company's success and take a chance on a stock moving up rather than on company
risks and market forces that might drive the stock down? Skilled people can do this periodically with some success I
suppose, but when an earnings mountain is staring you in the face, why not go long? This is safer and allows an
investor to get in and out on the way up.

Could Mr Tisson comment on the Amortization of Content figure in Q4? That declined to 46% of Content Acquisition
Costs from 53% in Q3 and from the 91% average Mr Tilson had calculated for previous periods. It seems operating
margin is overstated. A big chunk of the Balance Sheet is the unamortized Content Library - if they had Amortized at a
higher rate, the company would have no profits and negligble asset value.


Is it possible assess whether their accounting is fair? 
Thanks

If you review the historical 13Fs of T2 over the past 4-5 years you'll basically see that a very significant portion of T2's
historical returns have been largely generated by basic copy cat/piggybacking off Ackman and Einhorn picks.


Also a good portion of losses have been from copycatting these guys too. T2 went heavy on TGT when Ackman was
in there, BKS, and BGP as well.


However, if you look at the latest 13F of T2 www.sec.gov/Archives/e...


you'll see big stakes in ADP (Ackman), CIT (Einhorn), a small position in Citigroup which I assume he is building up
given Ackman deciding it was worth something, DISH (Einhorn), EMC (Einhorn), GGP looks like T2's biggest position
(Ackman), KFT (Ackman), MSFT (Einhorn). T2 has also been short MBIA (Ackman) and now JOE (Einhorn).


Then other big holdings include BP which was a T2 original, although what was prob a better risk/reward at the time
would have been bonds. BUD appears to be a T2 original but Ackman considered going activist on it in 2007 so
perhaps easy to dust off that research. BRK which is something all value investors apparently must own...and then
some megacaps like INTC and JNJ.


One curiosity is that some of T2's seeming "in-house" picks look like dogs. REXI is something he's pushed for a few
years and it's been in the doldrums for quite some time. WINN is another T2 "original" for some time and appears to
have been going nowhere, same with YHOO. DLIA is another multi year underperformer.


So as a T2 investor it appears that one is paying fees to have some 13Fs copied and then the in-house, proprietary
picks actually damage the performance of just a basket of those commonly held hedge fund holdings.


The one very peculiar thing, and not sure if it's a typo but T2 looks like it has $287MM (out of $578MM) in SPDR
puts? Making a massive market call or market short doesn't seem to be that consistent with a bottom up value
investor nor does it seem that T2 would put 50% of the fund into puts...so I'm curious based on the 13F if that's "real"
or a typo in the filing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/252316-whitney-tilson-why-we-covered-our-netflix-short 26/34


In either case, Tilson is one of the best businessmen in the investment mgmt industry. T2 seems to have had about
about $100MM-$200MM in AUM the past few years and based on his recent 13Fs, it appears that AUM has
increased above $500MM with most of the capital coming in over the past 9 months. If this occurred during a period of
significant underperformance it's very very impressive given the track record and heavy dependency on the picks of
other investors.


In addition, Tilson has also created a very successful value investor business through his value investing congresses
and various newsletters. Lot of Buffett quoting and then doing things like investing in BRK, MSFT, and JNJ when you
can invest in just about any part of the market with that level of capital.

"Of course, any company can goose its margins and profits in the short term by slashing marketing spending, but this
usually triggers a fall-off in sales and customers. Yet this didn’t happen to Netflix"


It didn't happen yet. The reason? the lag between marketing expenditure and sales impact. It will absolutly happen
and when it does your original thesis for shorting the stock will be in the money. How ironic is it that the only one thing
(subscriber growth) holding the stock up now will be same thing bringing it down as a result of marketing cuts (that
seems to impress you). You can't have it both ways.  
While I am disappointed with your cover, I have to say that you made me money over the years and I thank you for it.

Added to my short position today. With the stock up 7% today on news that is only modestly positive. Was anyone
really shocked by the Nielsen story? And then this item comes in from sfgate.com (San Francisco Chronicle online):
www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin... The article in entitled: "Is It Impossible To Lose Money In Netflix?" I would say yes and no. I
haven't lost any money yet on my short, but may lose a bundle if I cover sooner rather than later. If there was
substantive positive news on NFLX I would consider covering, but predictable earnings beats, and flattering press
releases along with analyst earnings upgrades based on hot air and predictable events are moving the stock in a way
that defies reason. Take a look at the press releases relating to stocks like IBM or Catepillar or any other number of

blue chip companies and you will see a plethora of positive releases that do nothing to move the stock. My take on
the Nielsen story (obviously biased) is that the pigs are at the trough at the NFLX All You Can Eat Buffet and that is
probably not wonderful news for NFLX bottom line. Call me stubborn, but I don't have to answer to anyone but myself
for my successful and unsuccessful trades and I'm still waiting for the catalyst either positive or negative. Last night
before I was aware of the Nielsen story I found myself thinking that there would probably be some sort of big event
story that would provide cover for some of the large holders to exit. I doubt this was it so I won't be shocked at more
spikes, but for bulls to wait for some sort of bell to ring to get out is probably a mistake. Congrats and best wishes to
all NFLX shareholders on their success. Be careful. Remember the story about pigs and chickents. I'll probably be
adding to my position with every big move up. A little at a time with no hedges. Conviction is a hard thing to overcome
and it exists in both camps.

Now is absolutely the time to short this stock , and yes based on valuation, and performance of the service. I know
lots of Canadians who have stuck their toe in the water, it is most definitely tepid at best, in terms of the value of the
service itself at the user level. We will see where the longs are at in one year from today with this fad stock.

Well looks like Tilson has pulled his chips out too early. I see a whole lot down for NFLX after hitting the target range
of $230-235. Shorts were acting like legs for NFLX. Now most of them are gone. The table is kinda tilted.

There's been a lot of talk about NFLX streaming to mobile devices. Cramer said it was another "game, set and match"
for NFLX, going with his ridiculous "annointed" comments. However, I think the buzz about cellular access instead
shows how weak the assumptions on NFLX growth are. AT&T charges $25 pm for 2 giga of data download. Verizon
charges $29 for unlimited downloads, but has said that it will have to go to a per usage charge like AT&T. 2 giga is

about two hours download. That means that to view NFLX will max out the cell capacity very quickly and will probably
raise cell phone costs dramatically. NFLX on mobile cell access can't happen.


In my opinion , it will be the same with internet access. In Australia, internet access costs depend on download
volume. With web streaming catching on, the same will happen in the US to prevent overload. People will only pay
higher ISP fees for premium downloads, such as new movies on iTunes.

I am not sure why people would want to watch Netflix on a mobile device with a screen size less than 6 inches.


That said, most smartphones have Wi-Fi and a lot of my data usage happens over Wi-Fi. So the limitations of a data
plan may only affect a small percentage of users unless, as you indicate, ISPs in the US start charging by download
volume.

Hmm. Good. But I still feel bad for you. I.e you lost and continued with your losing short postion for this long. One qn.
Why did`nt you "stress test" you short thesis earlier ? So you admit to make the mistake of entering your short with a
mind frame of being over-confident but under-prepared ? And other mistake would be continuing and throwing more
money on a losing trade ? my prev. comment ( here seekingalpha.com/artic... ) on your short thesis also drew quite a
flak but I`m fine with that. " Markets can remain irrational for longer that we can remain solvent" . ;-)

Perhaps you covered too soon. It is clear Amazon and Apple will use low priced movie services to fight over tablet
marketshare in the future calling into question Netflix's user numbers, margins, and business model. If downloadable
movies become a teaser in this war no one will be making money on the content side.


I took a short position realizing you don't want to go up against these two very savvy titans. I know Netflix made a lot
of money for the longs but Amazon and Apple made a lot more and have a lot more business savvy than them. My
bet is made siding with the big boys. Netflix may get crushed in the process.

Regarding my suggested Netflix short option trade dated 2/11/2011. 
Original trade offered was made in multiples of 2X .... 
-4calls & +2puts.... -10 calls & +5 puts. 
trades were executed at the following prices 
-2units March 270 calls @ 1.35 
+1unit March 195 put @ 2.10


Adjust as follows... 
cover all the Mar 270 calls @ .68 or better 
sell out half of the Mar 195 put @ 2.40 or better. 
Keep the extra puts... let the market run down.

I am usually not a short term trader, but FYI I closed my Netflix Puts just now after seeing all the money market
makers have made selling puts. Options closes will support Netflix on a technical side for now. I may re-enter when
the effects of Amazon etc are clearer. Sadly its dangerous shorting a high beta stock too long.

Especially in an UP market like this one. The selling last week didn't do much damage to the markets so far in
a technical sense. Good sale of NFLX puts. It's going to have a bounce here. We'll see if it can make a new
high. If it can't, then maybe more puts later. Is this the top-building process? Too early to say for sure.

Hard to short stocks successfully during a government-sponsored bull-run. I've never seen a market like this one.


There will be a LOT of short-sale possibilities (including Netflix probably) once Dr. Bernanke steps aside or gets
impeached). Until then, it seems like Russian Roulette to short a stock.

First of all let me say I love Whitney Tilson! By following a play of his in Dec 09 I have made the most profit I have
ever made in the market! 
He is a great investor, but this what makes investing so interesting, in that even a guy like Whitney,and there aren't
many, with his outstanding market knowledge and the resources of T2, at hand, even one so blessed can still make
mistakes! 
What is unusual is for such a high profile investor to admit his error. This column only strengthens my profound
respect for Whitney and I will continue to pay close attention to his ideas!

That's a good one. With a $17 spread as of today, According to my screen, theta is almost zero (.0007) and

Oops. I was looking at the weekly option. The Mar monthly still has $3 or so bid/ask value. But theta (currently 0.17)
decay will not be that much difference compared to the price swings this stock makes. A 0.50 swing will more than
compensate for a one day decay. Better to wait three weeks unless you think the stock is going up.

With market value of $11B, for the P/E to drop to 20, net income will have to grow 2.4 times from $160M in 2010 to
$550M. Assuming same margin, the number of subscribers will have to increase from 20M now to 68M, which is 90%
of the total broadband internet subscribers in US.

huge influx of int'l subscribers. Those subscribers won't come as easily as US subscribers and certainly not as
cheaply as 
1) NFLX has little brand equity in int'l markets. 
2) There is competition in Int'l markets (in Europe, its Lovefilm - soon to be Amazon; and in Aussie its quickflix); 
3) There is no net neutrality internationally so video streaming and bandwidth hogging will cost either the service or
the subscriber additional money; 
4) Netflix hasn't purchased the content for int'l yet (NFLX content for canada is not same as it offers in US).

AS, I share the same view with you on the international market, much smaller size and competition.

When the facts change, I change my mind - what do you do, sir?

Have you changed your mind about netflix, or are you going for full out broke on this one?

It's time to play Netflix options again. We're doing the June option. 
Sell 1 unit of the June 280call. ( closed at $4.20) 
Buy 1 unit of the June 290call ( closed at $3.25). 
Adjust your quantities to suit your risk tolerance.  
Two rules to follow.  
1. If NFLX hits $245... your out with a loss. Or.... 
2. You are out of the position by the latest... 4/14/2011. Earnings show up on 4/18/11. DO NOT GO INTO EARNINGS.
Any pullback( I doubt it) will let you out with a profit. Back to 200 .. get out also.


have fun

Time to get out of NFLX option position. 
NFLX hit $245 in premarket openings. My original position was... 
Sell 1 unit of June 280call ( around $4.20) 
Buy 1 unit of June 290call ( around $3.25)


Friday's close... June 280 call was $8.05... the June 290 call was 
$6.10. As always wait twenty minutes after the market opens to offse

the position. Give the option boys time to settle down. Don't play with the offset orders. Get out. Forget about it. Move
on. 
Have a good day

Mr Tilson I greatly appreciated hearing your thoughts. I agree the valuation isn't overly compelling here however as
you summarized a great company even if its overvalued could be a bad decision to short. Thank you for imparting
your wisdom on us. I personally wouldnt buy more here however I have a small long if the price drops to say 210-220
I'll add to my position. All the best. Jason

Do you feel you were right--just too early?

Excellent short thesis, bad timing. I think maybe it is the time to go short now. They can't have the self re-enforcing
looping of more client---better content now.


I am a little bit worries about their high margin. I am still thinking about it, and standing aside.

Looks like you changed your mind too soon.


It is now way down - and there are other problems with the streaming model that have to do with cost and who the
market really is. See here for another analysis:-

It's too bad Mr. Tilson couldn't have waited 9 months to watch the NFLX bubble burst.


Shorting is easy...timing is very hard.

well, its easy to think that stock going down proves a theory. Since netflix stock had such a nice run up there is always
a 'headline risk'. I have not seen a bad decision by netflix management yet. ups and downs in the stock price are
nothing new for netflix. Whatever is happening this year will be forgotten by jan 2012. There is still no better option for
a video streaming service. and there will not be one in at least next one year. Mr Tilson was right in covering his short.

rav... Tilson should have never had a position to begin with... As you say this is a "headline" risk stock. News
flow created a bubble on the upside and now news flow is bringing it back to earth. I still contend the stock is
grossly overvalued, but until the traders exit the stock and stop the wild momentum, I won't take a non-
hedged position.


This is a trading stock, not a stock to take a position and close your eyes with, unless properly hedged.

Actually, it has nothing to do with theory, that is what both investing and trading are all about, trying to predict total
pricing factors (including fad status and run-up from huge institutional support and effective control of the float at the
outset) and at 43x earnings at $155, us idiot shorts will indeed discuss this with you in January, but likely later. As I
have said before, I trade strangles, as I am sick of losing money on early but accurate positions, and am not well
enough capitalized to carry actual positions of this size , but I amstill short-bias overall, and will remain that way until
$90 or less. ($60?) Earnings will continue to be under pressure, from both increasing content cost, and subscriber
attrition through incomplete roll-over of user base. That is a close to a "theory" as I can get.

I remembered this article because I've had to write a similar letter. OUCH (as of 9/27/2011)!! I guess timing is
everything. One slip up re: pricing of service and the investment community long on a high-momentum/flyer, takes it
down 125%.

IMO - You are exhibiting Style Drift - This is no value play at present prices.
