MagneGas (MNGA): Insider Enrichment And Paid Stock
Promotion; -92.9% Downside – Pump Stopper

agneGas (MNGA): Strong Sell On Opaque O�shore Entities, Insider Enrichment And Paid


Stock Promotion; -92.9% Downside by The Pump Stopper,


Summary


Investigation shows MNGA International partners appear nonexistent, defunct or unviable. MNGA co-


founder Bo Linton partner Albert Reda jailed for fraud.


MNGA auditor was just barred by SEC for “falsi�ed and backdated audit documents” among other


misconduct. MNGA insiders fail to �le SEC �lings or hold shareholder meetings in timely fashion.


Santilli family related party enrichment abounds with $14.1m+ of insider compensation, ~12x more


than spent on R&D, Santilli family seized total control over MNGA through convoluted preferred share


voting rights.


Tests show Magnegas -30% slower, 26% more expensive. Praxair now selling demonstrably superior


product nationwide. Santilli and MagneGas apparently failed in 1998, resulting in legal action and no


strategic buyer.


Despite 9+ years of failure, 1,100%+ dilution and -$32m of losses, with recent paid stock promotion


MNGA temporarily in�ated to unsustainable 113x revenue valuation. Insiders aggressively selling


stock.


I believe Magnegas (NASDAQ:MNGA) is an imploding paid stock promotion shell of insider enrichment


and hype with immediate -92.90% downside risk. With a stock shell purchased for $32,000 and


cumulative total R&D spending of $1.18m, this team of calculated wipeout artists have carefully

5/22/2018 MagneGas (MNGA): Insider Riches, Paid Promotion - Pump Stopper


https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 2/45


orchestrated a clever “reboot” of a failed 1998 penny stock story with obsolete and unviable


technology while paying themselves $14.1m, ~12x more than has been invested in R&D. Through a


convoluted and under the radar preferred share structure, the Santilli gang have apparently seized


complete control over MNGA and can do whatever they want now without recourse.


With paid stock promotion using some of Wall Street’s worst paid touts, MNGA stock has temporarily


managed to rise +344% to the obviously unsustainable valuation of 113x 2014 revenue or $120m.


Investigation of MNGA’s claimed o�shore partners shows unviable, nonexistent or defunct company


shell. The last time MNGA hit a similar $120m valuation the stock price immediately imploded as


shareholders experienced a swift and uncompromising -93.8% stock price decline.


(graphic from Magnegas with my own edits)


Even if you assume MNGA is a legitimate company run by people you should trust with your savings,


the current valuation of 113x trailing revenue means the stock is still -92.9% overvalued using a “best


case” valuation. Simultaneously, global cutting gas juggernaut Praxair apparently “passed” on


MagneGas years ago when it was available for virtually nothing and instead is now aggressively


marketing their next gen “Star�ameC” cutting gas nationwide, which is estimated to cut ~20% faster


than MagneGas while costing at least -50% less with many other bene�ts. Meanwhile core MNGA


patents issued at company inception are expiring soon, rendering any hope of long term upside a moot


point. Further con�rming this view, MNGA insiders are aggressively dumping their stock into the


temporary stock promotion despite MNGA insider history of failing to disclose their trades to the SEC


on a timely basis. Without further diluting shareholders, MNGA will go bankrupt as cash burn and


losses continue to accelerate.


In this report I will outline the true nature of MNGA, what is going on behind the scenes, deep due


diligence into their partners and how this unviable business has managed to stay alive. Pour yourself a


very tall glass of warm gin and bring your patience for this incredible blueprint the Santillis have


managed to perpetuate so far.


All research and opinions based on public info shared below for the public’s good to help you in your


due diligence.


History of MNGA: Born Through a Shell Company with
“Questionable” Characters Involved


Apparently Ruggero was hired at MNGA’s forefather company Florida founded “Earth�rst” in 1998


which touted a purported familiar sounding “revolutionary process” for producing syngas from


waste, antifreeze and used motor oil with their plasma reactor technology which could be transported


onsite. This gas was attempted to be sold into the welding market under the name “NextGas” at the


time where they claimed a huge commercial production facility for their gas with claims it was 40%

faster/cleaner/safer based on a higher hydrogen content while their stock traded on the OTC markets


under ticker “EFTI”. They claimed applications in the utility markets and even signed questionable


JVs with far o� utility partners in Dominican Republic as they racked up -$50m in losses.


After ~3 years of employment, it seems starting in 2001 Santilli’s relationship with Earth�rst ended


badly with Earth�rst accusing him of libel and violating his non-compete contract (bottom of page 23


on the newspaper page 7b) where a Hillsborough judge seems to have granted Earth�rst a temporary


injunction.


At “Earth�rst”, insiders took egregious compensation for themselves, losses piled up as the concept


proved an unviable failure as shares outstanding ballooned with endless dilution. Eventually this �rst


Santilli company collapsed around 2006 with their unviable product which, tellingly, no big partner or


company stepped in to buy for pennies when it was available for practically nothing.


(pic credit)


Despite already failing once and Earth First now o�cially gone, the same unviable idea was free to be


rebooted in 2007 by Ruggero. As a result, MNGA was co-founded by Ruggero with penny stock wipeout


master Bo Linton using a defunct stock shell they purchased for $32k in cash. Thus, MNGA was born


touting the claims of “MagneGas” again but with some deliberate and interesting twists.

To understand what the MNGA game plan was from the start we can look into the founders to gain


insight. MGNA co-founder Bo Linton’s bio states he “led the development of the business plan” of


MagneGas and also owned 15% of MNGA stock. Unfortunately, Bo Linton’s career of wiping out penny


stocks was so proli�c he has drawn comparisons to Jordan Belfort, the Wolf of Wall Street. I will


present a brief history here but I recommend you dig into this MNGA co-founder on your own as the


story is amazingly bad in my view.

Who is this MNGA founder Bo Linton? Virtually everything I found Bo Linton associated with has an


interesting, recurring pattern of shareholder disaster:

MagneGas and the Santillis: It’s A Family A�air


When entrusting your money to speculative small cap stocks it is vital you understand the people you


are entrusting your money to. I believe the Santilli family and their surrounding crew are some of the


worst penny stock wipeout artists in America today.


Ermanno P. Santilli is Ruggero’s son, and the CEO of MagneGas. Luisa Ingargiola is the company’s CFO


and is Ruggero’s daughter. Luisa’s maiden name is Santilli according to her bio. Carla Santilli is


Ruggero’s wife also and a director at MNGA currently as well. O�cial FL company records show


Ruggero, Carla and Luisa Santilli were all in on this from the start with “Clean Energies Tech Co”


listing them all on corporate documents from even as far back as 2003.

Ruggero Santilli


A deeper look into Ruggero Santilli’s background reveals endless bizarre stories of events and


behavior including Santilli apparently claiming to have invented a new kind of water as well as being


“disrupted” repeatedly by Jewish scientists whose religion is highlighted speci�cally. I personally


found Ruggero’s background as detailed by Pepijn van Erp to be extremely confusing as I evaluated


MagneGas, and everyone may want to read Pepijn’s thoughts and opinions to form their own


conclusion.


To see how Santilli penny stocks typically end let’s look at the other disasters this family have been


involved with. Ruggero Santilli was involved with Thunder Energies Corporation (OTCPK:OTC:TNRG)


where Carla Santilli, Ruggero’s wife, was also involved, where I estimate the stock has been a disaster


falling -86.2%.

Why have so many Santilli investments ended so badly? What are they doing with this new penny stock


shell “Magnegas”?


MagneGas: Making the Santilli Family Rich For 9+ Years So Far


There are so many pathways of money from MNGA into Santilli pockets it makes my head spin. SEC


�lings show Carla Santilli and Luisa Ingargiola (Santilli) receive 25,000 shares of common stock


options per quarter EACH with a strike price of $1.50. Furthermore, MNGA has entered into some


amazingly lucrative consulting agreements with Rugerro Santilli:


MNGA also apparently leases o�ce space from Ruggero Santilli and Carla Santilli:


“The terms of the consulting agreement consist of issuance of common stock
(10,000 shares) and payment of $5,000 per month to Dr. Santilli, upon the
determination by the Board of MagneGas Corporation of achieving adequate
funding. The Board has since determined that Dr. Santilli’s monthly accrued


salary will be $15,000 per month. This consulting agreement was terminated on
June 11, 2012 and was replaced with the employment agreement between Dr.


Santilli and the Company, as described above. Dr. Santilli resigned April 30, 2013
and compensation ended.”

MNGA also paid Santilli for the use of a production re�nery Santilli owned:


It actually gets even worse once you look at how much the Santillis and other insiders collect from this


shell in the context of their claimed “business” fed to retail shareholders:


(click to enlarge)


(chart and estimates built by me from SEC �lings)


In just the past few years I estimate MNGA insiders have managed to pay themselves over $14m so far.


To put this into context, over the same time frame TOTAL R&D investment has been $1.18m. Also


“Beginning in April 2008, we entered into a month-to-month lease, at a monthly
rate of $2,500 per month for facilities to occupy approximately 3,000 square feet
of a 6,000 square foot building and the use of certain equipment and utilities, as


needed. In January 2011, the company expanded to occupy 5,000 square feet of the
building and as a result, the rent was increased to $4,000 per month. The facility
allows for expansion needs. The lease is held by EcoPlus, Inc., a company that is


e�ectively controlled by Dr. Santilli and Carla Santilli.“


“The use of an initial small production re�nery has been contributed by Dr.
Santilli. The value of the re�nery is approximately $210,000; the computed fair


value of this month to month rental agreement is $1,870 per month and has been
charged to equipment rental expense in the operating expenses, beginning in July


2008. Due to production demand, on December 28, 2011, the company entered
into an agreement to transfer the title of the unit to the company in exchange for


a promissory note of $210,500. The note was paid in full in April 2012.”

interesting the INCREASE ALONE of 2012 “investor relations” expense was $200k, while TOTAL


MNGA revenue since inception is just $6.8m.


Why is MNGA CEO Ermanno Smiling? $14m of insider
compensation would make anyone smile…


(pic credit Magnegas)


Just named executives alone have taken an estimated $4.45m for themselves not even including 2015


compensation or pro�ts on stock sales. I estimate of that, a full $2.8m has been in CASH without even


including any weird consulting agreements or other payments which may be going on.

It Gets Worse: Santillis Have Total Control Over The Public Shell?
Nothing You Can Do About It…


Meanwhile, you will see something I �nd both confusing and o�ensive in the latest 10-Q. Apparently


through a convoluted Series A preferred structure issued to an entity controlled by Ermano, Ruggero,


Carla and Luisa Santilli they granted themselves 1m preferred shares each with 100k votes, so now they


can exert dictatorial control over this public shell and shareholders can do nothing about it!


“Series A Preferred Stock has liquidation and dividend rights over Common
Stock, which is not in excess of its par value. The preferred stock has no


conversion rights or mandatory redemption features. There have been 1,000,000

MNGA’s Best Invention: A Stock Promotion Machine


Now that we understand what MNGA truly is, let us understand how it is possible this �nancial vehicle


even exists and funds itself.


MNGA is one of the most highly promoted stocks I’ve ever personally seen as the company has


executed an all-out media blitz to generate buzz around MagneGas. At one point the company even


signed former NFL player Mike Alstott to create “product awareness.” Interestingly, when ex NFL


player Jack Brewer also got involved with MNGA it was claimed he was a “UN ambassador” which is


not exactly what I see on his LinkedIn….


It’s also unclear what an NFL player would do to create product awareness for a product that seems


obviously unviable but it sure does make for a good press release. As you can see below, MNGA


discloses the absurd amounts of money it is spending on “investor relations”, “public awareness” and

5/22/2018 MagneGas (MNGA): Insider Riches, Paid Promotion - Pump Stopper


https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 14/45


These amounts are simply astonishing when you remember MNGA has spent an average of $136k total


per year on R&D while the Investor relations expenses increase alone in 2012 was $200k.


Either way, a signi�cant amount of the money appears to be �owing to penny stock promotion


websites from somewhere with >$303k in payments to stock shills disclosed in just the past few


months. According to hotstocked.com MagneGas has been subject to an impressive level of paid stock


promotion which coincidentally seems to line up with the Santilli’s aggressively selling their shares.


Below is a list of the recent touts temporarily promoting MNGA that I found:


“There was a slight increase in the issuance of common stock equivalents for
services valued in the amount of $1,511,989 in 2014 compared to $1,465,888, in


2013.” — 2014 10K


“Investor relation expenses increased over $200,000 in 2012 due to costs
associated with our funding and for the increase in regulatory compliance and the

“There was a signi�cant increase in the issuance of common stock for services
valued in the amount of $787,990 in 2011 compared to $2,053,090, in 2012.” — 2012

“In the current quarter, as in prior quarters, we used common stock as a method
of payment for certain services, primarily the advertising and promotion of the
technology to increase investor and customer awareness and as incentive to its

For example, such questionable teams as “OTCBB Journal” are ironically touting themselves as small

When you dig deeper though this “protector” is obviously just a paid stock shill on a 30 day contract:

https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 16/45


One interesting thing you may �nd interesting is to look at the dates of the paid stock tout campaign


above and then look at the ~$1m worth of stock Carla Santilli and MNGA insiders have just recently


sold so far.


(click to enlarge)


(chart and estimates built by me using SEC �lings)


I would note the most recent stock sales by “Global Beta” and Carla Santilli at $0.95-1.37 are some of


the largest insider sell transactions to ever occur at MNGA.


Paid stock tout campaigns basically always end in horri�c and sudden losses, which is why it is my


opinion that no legitimate company should be involved with paid stock promotion, which consistently


ends with retail shareholder wipe out. Does everyone else who holds MNGA stock know this is going on


while Carla Santilli is dumping stock?


MNGA Insiders Appear to Routinely Fail to Report
Their Transactions with the SEC on Time?
Also concerning is the fact that several MNGA executives have repeatedly failed to report their MNGA


transactions on a timely basis:


(click to enlarge)


Source: MagneGas SEC Filing


There has been excessively high volume in MNGA stock recently. Given that insiders historically have


not reported their ownership positions in a timely manner, how do we even know that insiders haven’t


already liquidated some or all of their stock at these temporarily high prices? SEC form4 �lings are


also typically short and simple 1-2 page template �lings so I am confused on how or why anyone could


repeatedly fail to �le them on time.


Other types of promotion: Buying your own award?


It is not just the paid stock promotion that is concerning with MNGA either, how about this hilarious


“award” MNGA touts on their website:



https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/2015/12/20/24831403-14506224886803935-The-Pump-Stopper_origin.png

https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 17/45


Unfortunately for MNGA shareholders the truth comes out in the �ne print again:


What a coincidence!


It is important to remember that MNGA only survives, and MNGA insiders only get rich, if the stock


stays high which requires that someone keep buying it. We can see from the shareholder list that no


intelligent institutional investors have fallen for the MNGA story. What is happening with MNGA and


all these bottom-tier paid stock promoters temporarily touting the stock? What investors would


possibly support this insider enrichment escapade?


(click to enlarge)


(chart from capiq and built on public information)


As you can see above, the vast majority of MNGA stock is being purchased by unsophisticated retail


investors who typically do not have the resources or time to perform true institutional levels of due


diligence. I think you may be beginning to see why MNGA is so desperate to keep their stock up at all


costs, because when these retail investors decide to stop e�ectively donating their savings to MNGA


insiders through o�ensive warrant agreements, the MNGA house of cards will implode (again), just


like predecessor EarthFirst (OTC:EFTI).


“After the Award was determined and presented, MagneGas elected to publish


paid advertising in the New Economy publication at a cost of $24,863.“

MNGA’s “Warrant-Conversion Retail Investor Mine�eld”: The
Easiest $5m You’ve Ever Seen


In late 2015, despite assuring investors MNGA did not need capital and had no intention of raising any


capital on the November shareholder call, MNGA was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy with an


estimated <$2m of cash left and burning -$1.5m or more per quarter, the situation appeared dire with


bankruptcy imminent without another immediate cash infusion. Suddenly MNGA stock soared after a


series of �akey press releases and stock promotion appear to have confused retail investors. Then the


coup de grace: MagneGas Updates Investors Regarding Cash Position as warrants were exercised at


the temporarily in�ated price. Let us look at how this was $5m coupe was brilliantly orchestrated:


SEC �lings show a huge number of warrants held by MNGA insiders and where those warrants strike.


(click to enlarge)


Source: MagneGas SEC Filing


For these warrants and options to be valuable, MNGA stock needs to trade above the stock price. If that


happens warrant holders can exercise, that cash goes directly into MNGA co�ers, and the warrant


holders can dump their stock onto whatever retail shareholders are buying into the hype. With the


warrant strike prices laid out, what was necessary next was to get the stock up to get money.


(click to enlarge)


Source: Chart by me with data from Capital IQ


With the mine�eld of warrants laid out the last piece was to run retail investors into it so the warrant


holders can exercise and dump their stock onto someone, and “BOOM” MNGA now has $5m in cash!

Institutional investors have clearly not fallen for the MNGA story so the only option left was the path


MNGA stock has taken, and I believe a huge number of retail shareholders have been led to their


�nancial demise in this mine�eld of MNGA warrants being exercised and sold into the market. The


retail shareholders were led by promotional press releases and paid stock promotion into this situation


and are now holding MNGA stock temporarily in�ated to an obviously unsustainable valuation. MNGA


now has what they want, their ~$5m in cash and I think we all know how this story ends now.

MagneGas: Long History of Brutal Shareholder Dilution and Losses

MagneGas has also recently �led a shelf to sell $50 million worth of stock, which is an enormous

We can all agree that with tiny and speculative penny stocks, the quality and trust of the people


controlling the company is of utmost importance. Capitalism is littered with the corpses of decent


products run into the ground through bad or greedy management and with 10K+ stocks you can invest


in there is no reason to invest in these kind of disasters.


MGNA’s Partnerships: The Story Really Starts to Unravel Bad
Here….


At this point I would like to remind you that MNGA makes lots of grandiose partnership claims but


unfortunately once further research is done the cracks quickly appear in their story. For our �rst


example, MNGA just announced a much touted partnership with a Sierra Leone company “Masada”


and MNGA stock temporarily soared adding millions of dollars of valuation.


Upon further diligence on Masada though, serious issues arise. Primarily that Masada does not appear


to have any signi�cant MagneGas (any?) operations, no phone number and no address.

How can MNGA possibly expect investors to believe this is a viable and real partnership expected to


drive pro�ts when the company doesn’t even have a phone number or useful website?


Unfortunately the touted Sierra Leone deal isn’t the only MNGA claim that doesn’t seem to stack up.


MNGA also touts their purported Joint Venture with a Chinese company and their claimed “LOI!” with


Chinese DDI and Hyfuels for a claimed $29.8m production center in China. The website for this


venture is listed right in the press release but when we look further we see:

Then Chinese business pro�les show that DDI’s representative uses a @163.com email address, this is


a personal Netease email and in my view is analogous to claiming the contact info for a huge global


company is an “@aol.com” personal email address. If you look closer at this link you’ll see that the


“DDI Industry International (Beijin) Co., Ltd” address is actually so speci�c as to be limited to a single


room in one o�ce. So apparently this theoretically thriving, huge global business is so successful it


doesn’t even have corporate email and is so successful is it apparently relegated to a single room?


Further giving you con�dence that the entire DDI is contained in one single room, is not a mistake,


this address is repeated in multiple places from Panjiva to Bloomberg and the listed president of DDI


claims the company has been around since 2005. Perhaps this is why despite claiming to be a “Global


Investment Group!” if you go to their claimed website it shows it is also non-existent.

Similarly, a deep dive into MNGA’s much touted MOU partnership with “Afnetco” in South Africa at


least shows some company that least appears to exist in some form. However, further research turns


up zero website or contact info with only one active employee I could �nd on Linkedin with a P.O. Box


listed as the postal address.


Or how about this press release of a claimed partnership in Michigan also:


But if you call this Mayo shop you will �nd they do not stock Magnegas. If you push them to explain why,


you will receive a short and tense response without detail that they are simply not going to provide any


information on why they do not stock Magnegas, just that they aren’t and goodbye. Assuming this


place ever stocked Magnegas, where is a press release announcing they dropped the gas and deemed it


not worth their time?


In fact I called many of their claimed distributors and partners. What I found is that typical stock


Magnegas, if it is even there, is ~3-5 cylinders per shop and that they were unhappy about paying for


the $5-15 per month tank rental charge on a gas apparently nobody wants while the gas just sits in


storage and the distributors pay monthly rent back to Magnegas.


“MagneGas Expands Midwest Market Presence With New Michigan Customer”


“…announced today that it will begin supplying Mayo Welding and Fabrication
(“Mayo”) of Royal Oak, MI with MagneGas™ fuel for its metal working needs.”We


are pleased to announce our continued advancement in the fabrication-heavy


midwestern market,” stated MagneGas President Scott Wainwright. “Mayo has a


seven-decade legacy of outstanding workmanship, and has evolved into a trusted


market in�uencer. We believe it will help cement our presence in the region and


also serve as an active advocate for our fuel.”

Before we conclude this section I’d like to hear a round of applause for MNGA’s “VP of strategic


alliances” and close with one �nal question: what would you say… you do here, Jack?


(pic credit Magnegas)


Why Did MGNA’s Technology Fail Before With No Interest? Why
The Constant Failure?


If you somehow still believe the MNGA story you are probably wondering how this apparent miracle


gas and leadership, despite 9+ years and $32m+ of losses so far, has yet to ramp revenue and their


claims seem to repeatedly fall through?


There are basically two key pillars to the investment case which confused Magnegas shareholders are


being fed: the claimed welding opportunity and co-generation.


Miniscule R&D Has Left MNGA Hopelessly Behind with Large
Competitors Selling Superior Products


One irreparable side e�ect of spending virtually nothing on MagneGas R&D since Santilli’s Earth�rst


days in 1998, and chasing so many disparate projects simultaniously, is that MagneGas is hopelessly


obsolete, left behind by large companies selling superior cutting gas products with truly global


distribution and sales. For brevity, I will start with just two examples in this report for now.


(pic credit Praxair)


Praxair is widely known as the global leader in cutting gas. They are now marketing a next gen cutting


gas called “Star�ame C” which has so many advantages relative to MagneGas I think it will make you


laugh out loud. I will also point out here that Praxair (NYSE:PX) spends ~$100m on R&D each and


every year.


We can start with the easy stu�: �rst of all Praxair (far more reputable company than MNGA in my


view) appears to claim Star�ameC can cut as much as a full 50% faster than Acetylene. Magnegas2


distributors themselves claim Magnegas is 38% faster than Acetylene. This makes Praxair’s


Star�ameC gas an estimated 19.35% faster than Magnegas based on their publicly disclosed


performance �gures.

5/22/2018 MagneGas (MNGA): Insider Riches, Paid Promotion - Pump Stopper


https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 25/45


Star�ame C is also -20% cheaper than propylene and -50% cheaper than Acetylene, which since we


know MagneGas is MORE expensive than Acetylene we can use the Navy’s independent cost numbers


below, means Star�ame C is an estimated -79.8% cheaper than MagneGas.


(pic credit Praxair)


It gets even worse for Magnegas because Star�ame C also requires only 1/5 the tanks and tank space.


This saves capital on tanks, saves shipping and transport cost and time, makes handling easier, as well


as reduced hydro certi�cation time and money as well. Furthermore, Star�ame C has superior edges


and drag lines with minimal slag saving time on post cleanup relative to Acetyelne. Star�ame also is


more forgiving on torch tip, requires no special training and works with the same regulator as existing


tanks. Furthermore, 100% of the Star�ame C in a tank can be used, which is in contrast to other gases


where a large percentage of the gas is left in the tank at lower pressure. Other tests and videos online


also show zero noticeable soot or particulate matter.


Perhaps most importantly though, Star�ame C is available and supported with service right now today


at Praxair shops around all of both US and Canada in cylinder size from 5lb tiny tanks to 10,000 gallon


external bulk tanks.


(pic credit Petrogen)


It’s not just Praxair though, Petrogen for example has perhaps the most impressive cutting gas


product I have ever seen which is so powerful it works even when immersed in mud or underwater.


Unsurprisingly Petrogen’s customer list includes everyone from FEMA to DLA to Lockhead Martin



http://www.petrogen.com/customers.html#industry
5/22/2018 MagneGas (MNGA): Insider Riches, Paid Promotion - Pump Stopper


https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 26/45


(NYSE:LMT). Check out this unreal video of Petrogen’s technology cutting through a ~16 inch block of


steel like its butter while available to end users at a fuel cost -91% cheaper than acetyelene.


It seems clear to me that MNGA has no hope of competing against companies like Praxair let alone


when Praxair is selling an obviously superior product. For lower volume customers are those requiring


the highest of cutting power there are many niche players like Petrogen who o�er unebelivably


powerful cutting tools for sale with fuel prices a tiny fraction of Magnegas’s as well.


I will highlight here again that Praxair is a global cutting gas juggernaut with tens of thousands of


employees aware of every innovation in the cutting gas indstury as it happens. Magnegas has been


touted since at least 1998 and Praxair surely is aware of this inferior product. When EFTI was failing in


2001 timeframe Praxair could have easily swooped in and bought the whole business for pennies and,


quite tellingly, Praxair passed entirely on any part of it.


Independent Magengas Tests: Slow and Expensive as Propane
Prices Further Decline -64%


Given MNGA has been a repeated failure that large cutting gas companies seem to have passed on


while MagneGas has failed to generate material revenue, I think the data MagneGas presents is beyond


suspect. This is why it is important to read the details when companies like MNGA put out press


releases. Just because some subcontractor is onsite at a military base does not mean that the whole


military is onboard. In 2014 the Navy themselves recently tested MangeGas and after their extensive


test they chose propane instead. It is crucial to note that in any test, if the people running the test are


trying to produce a certain output they can simply tweak the inputs until they get whatever results


they want. This navy test is one of the only true independent and unbiased tests done with MagneGas


that is publicly available so I present that to you here for your own research.


The Magnegas “Alternative Fuel” is compared below to old school propane, showing it to be far more


expensive and simultaneously much slower:

In the Navy’s words:


“it was determined that the alternative fuel did not signi�cantly produce less


opacity compared to propane. Propane was also superior in cutting speed and

5/22/2018 MagneGas (MNGA): Insider Riches, Paid Promotion - Pump Stopper


https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 27/45


If you read further you will �nd the navy’s calculations showed Magnegas material per shift was nearly


300% higher than the propane test group as the Magnegas cost itself was nearly 400% higher than the


propane which didn’t even come close to o�setting any claimed oxygen savings.





(credit Navy “alternative gas” test of Magnegas)


Furthermore the Navy stated Magnegas needs to be stored in its own separate locker and cannot be


stored near Propane. Since every metal working shop in the nation is likely to have propane on hand


we can see this logistical inconvenience is also likely a key reason why the revenue has never scaled for


Magnegas. The Navy also further discussed that being hostage to a gas that has only one vendor is also


not something they liked (page 41). The results were so conclusive that the Navy didn’t even want to


waste their time trying the extra full tanks of Magnegas they had received for free and instead elected


to just return it to MNGA full.


Furthermore, the Navy’s comments on the contents of Magnegas show ingredients which are nothing


special at all and appear virtually identical to me to the syngas which Santelli and Earth�rst touted as


far back as 1999:


“The alternative fuel cylinder is a 210 standard cubic feet (scf). The composition of the gas is hydrogen


(55 – 65%), nitrogen (30 – 35%), acetylene (3 – 5%), methane (2 – 4%), trace gases (.5 – 1%), and


water vapor (1000 – 2000 ppm).”


fuel e�ciency” “Based on the Navy’s results, the alternative fuel will not be
included in the toolbox of di�erent approaches to recycle ships”

Even more concerning, since this independent test was run showing Magnegas to be too expensive


relative to propane and not viable, propane and acetylene feedstock prices have fallen in price


dramatically with the collapse in the oil/gas markets. Acetylene, propane and syn/nat gas are all down


in price dramatically. See this price of propane for example, which has decreased in price by -69% just


since 2/2014:

Or Acetylene which is produced from Natural Gas and as a byproduct of petroleum processing, we see


ethylene and nat gas prices have both imploded as well, rendering MagneGas even more expensive


relative to proven options customers are already comfortable with and using:

Or nat gas itself, from which many NGLs are produced:


(nat gas price chart)


The jury is out and MagneGas is not competitive which is why revenue has never ramped and why


MNGA does not break out their revenue generated from selling MagneGas exclusively but instead


lumps it in with other welding product supplies sold from their tiny, acquired ESSI business. Why does


MNGA never disclose exactly how much revenue they derive directly from MagneGas sales? How come


their “LOI” and “MOU” and partnership press releases are always sparse on revenue numbers?


MGNA Utility Claims are Absurd and Worthless Too


First of all the coal power plant business is a dying one that is rapidly going away, to be replaced with


nat gas power plants (nat gas prices at generational lows from shale revolution) and also replaced by


cleaner alternatives. Selling into this market at this stage is like selling buggy whips. Second of all, the


concept of the oxygen blown gasi�ers having been around and in use since at least 1987 starting with


the Conocco Philipe E-gas gasi�er developed by DOW and used at the Louisiana Gasi�cation


Technology site from 1987-1995.

This concept of oxygen blown or syn gas injected power plants is something the large power plant


manufacturers have been selling for years. Here are more schematics on a Hitachi setup that also


claims to reduce emissions dramatically.

Secondly, Magnegas has already failed in this market and, judging by constant delays and issues here,


their feedstock apparently does not seem to me to have enough consistency or the high level quality


control required by power plant producers like GE and Siemens. If you think GE is going to let some


vegetable oil derived gas made by a questionable penny stock wipeout team in a FL warehouse be


injected into their $1b+ power plants without voiding service contracts and �nancing agreements then


I think you are clearly delusional.


Secondly, the composition of Magnegas appears virtually identical to most syn-gases and even if there


is some unique bene�t, this gas could and would easily be recreated by Air Products (NYSE:APD),


Airgas (NYSE:ARG) or any number of other specialty gas/chemical companies. In fact APD and the gas


industry have already looked at many waste to gas solutions and have already chosen their partners,


APD for example has been partnered with Westinghouse derived Alter NRG since at least 2009 which


apparently had an estimated $100M+ of R&D invested into it, which makes MNGA’s barely $1m of


cumulative R&D even more laughable.


MNGA Investment Thesis Moot Point as MNGA Core Patents
Rolling O� Anyway


One of the unfortunate side e�ects of these “rerun wipeouts” is even if MNGA had anything valuable


(nope) it doesn’t even matter because their core patents roll o� soon anyway and they already shared


their IP with China years ago. As you can see below the core patents MNGA claims start rolling o� and


become worthless over the next 3-5 years. Considering MNGA is a tiny speculative venture now with


minimal revenue, any future upside is based on their multiyear claims of future success.


(click to enlarge)


(chart built by me from MNGA’s SEC �lings)


Considering even the faintest of hopes for MNGA shareholders is based on far o� future upside, the


fact their foundational patents roll o� so soon renders any upside discussion for MNGA a moot point.


Given MNGA invests almost nothing into R&D, this is not surprising to me.

I think the only way MNGA has not gone bankrupt and vaporized is due to the poor retail investors who


don’t know any better and pump their hard earned money into this worthless stock. Then the warrant


holders convert their warrants or the company does in�ated and dilutive capital raises and sell into


these retail “mom and pop” investors. After which, the money ends up in the MNGA co�ers to be paid


to insiders and family members. I believe at some point this promotional pattern will fail, MNGA will


not be able to fund itself, and will swiftly go bankrupt where everyone will promptly forget this mess


as it joins the corpse of EFTI with countless other defunct penny stock nobody cares about.


MNGA’s Auditor Recently Resigned, Was Then Suspended by the
SEC: Are MNGA Financials Reliable?


One of the worst aspects of the MNGA story to me is that, given these auditor issues and MNGA


insider’s apparent repeated failure to �le their SEC form 4 �lings on time, it is unclear if we can even


rely on the company’s �nancials.


From what I can tell, going back to at least 2008, MNGA has used the services of Drake, Klein,


Messineo (DKM) or related entities, including predecessor entities to what appears to have ultimately


become DKM, CPA. Just days ago DKM, CPA and several of the audit partners involved with auditing


MNGA’s historical �nancials, was suspended by the SEC for “Bad Auditing”. From at least 2008,


MNGA’s 10-K lists Randall Drake, CPA as the company’s auditor, then in the 2011 MNGA 10-K, the


�rm is now listed as Drake & Klein, CPAs which, starting in 2012, the �rm signs MNGA’s 10-K as DKM,


CPA


Quoting from the SEC press release:


Washington D.C., Dec. 10, 2015 –


The Securities and Exchange Commission today suspended �ve accountants and


two audit �rms from practicing or appearing before the SEC after they violated


key rules that are designed to preserve the integrity of the �nancial reporting


system.


According to the SEC’s orders instituting settled administrative proceedings, the


accountants and �rms at various times performed de�cient audits of public


companies, jeopardized the independence of other audits, and falsi�ed and


backdated audit documents among other misconduct.


“Auditors must follow the professional standards and avoid con�icts of interest


when they opine on the �nancial information reported by public companies,” said


Paul G. Levenson, Director of the SEC’s Boston Regional O�ce. “These

https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/ 33/45


The SEC suspension press release does not give details on the speci�c company audits that were


identi�ed as being bad. However, DKM, CPA abruptly resigned as MNGA’s auditor in mid-2015 after


over 8 years with MNGA. Are the two issues related? It seems extremely odd that MNGA’s auditors


would abandon ship after such a long-tenured relationship while MNGA insiders aggressively sell


their stock and craft so many related party transactions.


Furthermore, the DKM, CPA suspension (Messineo, the “M” in DKM, was barred for life from auditing


on behalf of public companies) appears to be broad and deep in scope. We can see according to Google


Maps that DKM Certi�ed Public Accountants appears to be a small and local accounting �rm based


conveniently close to company operations in Clearwater, FL in between a sports bar and Mexican grill.


Google shows what appears to me to be an un�nished building in a strip mall. According to Google, the


pictures were taken May 2015.


Was any serious work ever done here? Do You Trust MNGA’s
�nancials?

Source: Google Maps


In my view, this is not an adequate place of business for an accounting �rm but what’s even more


concerning to me is MagneGas paid a mere $55,500 in audit fees in 2014. This number is frighteningly


low given the company’s global operations and host of related party transactions, in my opinion. In


fact, I can’t ever recall seeing any public company with global operations have audit fees anywhere


near this low. According to a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, DKM only had 8 employees


accountants and their �rms showed complete disregard for the basic rules of
their profession. As a result, they are now barred from working on any SEC-


related matters.“

su�ciently audit 41 issuers?


That same report found several audit de�ciencies of such signi�cance among DKM audits “that it


appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued each audit report, had not obtained


su�cient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion on the issuer’s �nance statements.” I have


looked at several PCAOB reports and this is by far the worst one I have seen.


Messineo (the “M” in DKM) was also apparently the public accountant for Thunder Energies

Are the multiple connections between the Santillis, DKM, and Pollack all just a big coincidence? Is it a


coincidence that many of the stocks these people have been involved with have basically gone to $0?


How do these people keep ending up in the same place together?!


Given the SEC bar’d auditors, MNGA insider’s apparent repeated failure to �le SEC form4’s on time,


near delisting from �oundering stock price and failing to hold timely shareholder meetings, I


recommend extreme caution when viewing MNGA’s �nancials as it does not seem to me that MNGA


has e�ective internal controls in my view.


MNGA Management Response:


Repeated calls to MNGA management and investor relations were made without response or answer. I


believe MNGA shareholders deserve to be held accountable to their shareholders and any management


team that does not make themselves directly and personally accessible at all times to their investors is


a huge red �ag. I look forward to MNGA insiders providing a full and comprehensive response to all of


the damning research exposed here today as well as how it is possibly fair for the Santilli gang to have


apparently granted themselves complete dictatorial control voting control over this public shell. Given


the shocking evidence shares in this report I recommend you immediately call MNGA management


directly and ask them to explain all of this right away as blanket and unfounded statements from their


outside IR team is just not su�cient at this point. Shareholders deserve direct and open


communication with this management team, at the very least.


MNGA Fair Value: -92.9% Downside in “Best Case” Scenario,
Wipeout Re-Run Occurring Now


One of the side e�ects from questionable paid stock promotion and questionable partnership


announcements from MNGA is that MNGA’s valuation is clearly impossible based on any optimistic


scenario you can craft. Even in MGNA’s wildest upside dreams, MGNA stock is STILL impossibly


overvalued at the current $120m valuation.


One important valuation point to �rst make is MNGA seems to me to conveniently exclude a full 16.1m


additional shares of warrants and options when they display their diluted share count on their income


statement. This has the interesting side e�ect of understating the market cap that Google and Yahoo �nance


shows to retail shareholders.

(credit MNGA latest 10q)


Since MNGA loses money hand over �st, I don’t see how excluding these is fair. I have made the


appropriate estimated adjustment for this enormous wave of warrants and options in my own


valuation which brings the fully diluted share count up from the last press release to 61.09m, which


based on the stock price of $1.98 means MNGA market cap is temporarily near the highest it has ever


been, before the previous MNGA stock price collapse.


As we can see below, generously assuming all of MNGA’s R&D spending has created value (100% R&D


success rate) and assuming MNGA will not burn through anymore cash (MGNA lost -$2.215 in the last


quarter) calculated fair value for MNGA of $0.14 per share. Note that on a market cap basis this is not


far o� from where MNGA stock was recently at the end of 2013.

(chart and analysis created by me with my own estimates)


If we take some of the other unviable companies that MNGA longs have used as peers for MNGA we


again see that MNGA stock is -87.14% overvalued, which I believe is also optimistic since I believe


these two peer companies, while superior to MNGA given less nepotism enrichment and no insider


iron-�st voting control, are still intrinsically worthless.


This is just another rerun of the last time MNGA temporarily was in�ated to an obviously


unsustainable valuation, and subsequently had a violent -93.8% collapse. Interestingly, this -92.90%


loss for MNGA stock is actually not even as bad as many of the shareholder disasters this wipeout team


has been involved in. I expect this new MNGA collapse that is occurring to be similar to the last one,


which simultaneously lines up with the fair value per share MNGA has of $0.14 per share. Given we


know MNGA insiders and Carla Santilli have been aggressively selling MNGA stock since at least $0.82


per share.

Action

As you can see above, MNGA stock chart has already broken down technically and pulled back hard o�


of the latest intraday high stock price of ~$2.35 (where presumably the warrant holders were


apparently exercising and selling the stock aggressively). As the paid stock promotion fades and


investors realize what is truly going on here I expect MNGA stock to continue imploding back below its


pre-promotion price on its way to $0.14 per share.

MNGA Conclusion: “DON’T FALL FOR IT.”


I believe MNGA stock is collapsing now as paid stock promotion fades. Even if you ignore 30+ pages of


MNGA red �ags above, there is STILL -92.90% immediate downside in a “best case” scenario based on


valuation alone even if MNGA is valued similar to obviously superior peers. More likely I think MNGA


stock will go much lower on its eventual way to $0 given its increasing irrelevance from negligent


R&D, worthless technology and partnership claims along with abusive insider enrichment. MSDS and


Navy data shows “MagneGas!” seems to contain nothing unique anyway and even in the o� chance


people ever use this gas I see nothing stopping Airgas or Air Products from simply producing the same


gas themselves and selling it without MNGA. With MNGA stock breaking down now o� recent highs


and paid stock promotion fading, the end for MNGA seems near.


MNGA was recently a $0.44 stock and now with a much larger share count as partnerships apparently


crumbling, I expect the stock to go much lower on its long term path to bankruptcy and $0, like


predecessor and Santilli company EFTI. Not that I expect this to impact the Santillis and MNGA


insiders though as I expect they will get paid another $14.1m with huge stock grants while racing


Ferraris until shareholders pull the plug and the doors are �nally closed for good.


Given all the red �ags, questionable people involved, self-enriching nepotism and complete control


seized from public shareholders and given to the Santilli family, even if you wanted to speculate in tiny


long shot industrial gas companies you can �nd something better to invest in than MNGA trading at


114x revenue.


DON’T FALL FOR IT.
