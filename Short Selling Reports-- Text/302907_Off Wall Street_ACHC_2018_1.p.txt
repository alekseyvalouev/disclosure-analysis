Concept: 
1. A U.S. psychiatric hospital building boom underway is leading to increased competition for 
the most profitable managed care and Medicare patients. As a result, ACHC’s managed care and 
Medicare revenue is declining, as are its US margins.   
2. Regulatory changes beginning in July 2016 opened ACHC’s US acute inpatient psychiatric 
hospitals (27% of 2017 revenue) to adult Medicaid patients. Medicaid revenue growth has 
masked declining managed care and Medicare revenue, but Medicaid growth is likely to slow as 
regulatory changes lap and as more hospitals open. 
3. Growth in ACHC’s UK behavioral health business (36% of 2017 revenue) is slow, and 
threatened by NHS funding shortfalls and economic instability from Brexit. 
4. Staff shortages in the US and the UK are driving up costs.  Increased competition for qualified 
personnel and limits on immigration in both the US and UK could further pressure margins. 
 
Summary: Acadia Healthcare (ACHC) owns and operates US and UK behavioral 
health facilities.  In 2017, 27% of revenue came from US acute inpatient 
psychiatric hospitals, 15% was from US residential addiction/eating disorder 
treatment facilities, 10% was from US medication-assisted and abstinence-based 
outpatient addiction treatment centers, 10% was from US adolescent residential 
treatment facilities, and 36% came from UK behavioral health facilities. 
 
 ACHC operates 585 behavioral health facilities in 40 US states, Puerto Rico, 
and throughout the UK.  It began operations in 2005. Former employees of 
Psychiatric Solutions, including the former CEO, the EVP Finance, the COO, the 
Chief Accounting Officer, and the General Counsel of Psychiatric Solutions joined 
ACHC In February 2011.  Psychiatric Solutions was bought by Universal Health 
Services in November 2010.  We wrote a successful recommendation to sell 
Psychiatric Solutions (PSYS) shares in July 2008. During this management’s 
tenure at PSYS, there was a DOJ investigation into its executive compensation 
practices, and there were safety violations in multiple facilities that resulted in 
states halting admissions, and there was poor financial performance. In November 
2011, Acadia merged with a publicly traded behavioral health provider, PHC, a 
move that allowed Acadia to go public without enduring the harsh light of an IPO 
roadshow. 
 


From 2011 through mid-2016, ACHC levered up to make a series of 
behavioral health acquisitions.  In the US, it acquired addiction treatment facilities, 
including Bain Capital’s CRC Health in February 2015 for $1.3B (11.3x forward 
EBITDA), which included the assumption of $970M in CRC debt and the issuance 
of $365M in ACHC stock.  Bain sold all of its ACHC shares by August 2017.  In 
the UK, it acquired numerous facilities, including Advent’s Priory Group (UK) in 
February 2016 for $2.2B (11.2x trailing EBITDA).  Acquisitions abruptly stopped 
in June 2016, with only one small acquisition in Scotland ($21M) in November 
2017.  Since mid-2016, growth has come from adding beds to existing facilities in
3 


the US and UK and from US de novo acute psychiatric hospitals, sometimes as 
joint ventures with local hospitals.   


 
At present, the company has $3.1B in debt, and its current Net 


Debt/EBITDA is 5.1x.  About 55% of debt is senior secured loans with floating 
interest rates of LIBOR plus 2.5% (totaling about 5.3% at present), while the 
remaining 45% of debt is at fixed interest rate debt at a blended 5.9%.  The 
company has about $500M of availability under its revolving credit facility, which 
it has promised to deploy for acquisitions since early 2017.  Its earliest term loan of 
$150M is due in 2021, with another $300M due in 2022 and $650M due in 2023. 


 
ACHC’s growth strategy has been to grow its US freestanding psychiatric 


hospital segment by adding beds to existing facilities and opening de novo 
hospitals, sometimes as JVs with acute care hospitals.  A fundamental change in 
US Medicaid reimbursement policy occurred in July 2016 that we estimate 
increased the population eligible for admission in psychiatric hospitals like 
ACHC’s by 19.8M people, or 14%.  This change was touted as a huge opportunity 
by ACHC and by its competitor, UHS, who both predicted accelerating US 
revenue growth and a significant number of new joint ventures with hospital 
partners to build freestanding hospitals to meet increased demand. 


 
Of course, other players also recognized the new opportunity created by the 


change in reimbursement. Indeed, as we describe below in detail, the 
reimbursement change is creating a significant increase in the number of total 
acute inpatient psychiatric beds available in the US.  Multiple players have rushed 
to build new beds, prompting a boom in construction of new freestanding acute 
inpatient psychiatric hospitals.  Few of these are JVs with ACHC.  HCA is 
building its own psychiatric hospitals, not-for-profits are choosing private equity-
backed partners, and some psychiatrists are working with healthcare real estate 
investors to build independent psychiatric hospitals to which they can direct the 
most lucrative referrals.   


 
At the same time, acute care hospitals are shifting the mix of patients in their 


psychiatric units, and some are adding new beds to these units. Acute psychiatric 
patient referrals most commonly come from hospital emergency rooms.  Since 
freestanding psychiatric hospitals can now accept Medicaid managed care patients, 
hospitals appear to be using their referral power to send these patients out, freeing 
their own beds for more profitable commercial managed care and Medicare 
patients.  If a hospital’s own acute facility is full, we think it is more likely to send 
commercially insured patients to the newest facilities in its area, which may have 
relationships with its top psychiatrists.  As a result, older freestanding facilities, 
such as many owned by ACHC, are then left with a higher mix of less profitable 
Medicaid managed care patients.
4 


 
The impact of these changes seems evident in ACHC’s reported revenue by 


payor.  In 1H18, managed care revenue (30% of US revenue) declined -1.4% y-y, 
while Medicare revenue (14% of US revenue) declined -1.9% y-y.  In contrast, 
Medicaid revenue (46% of US revenue) increased 13% y-y in 1H18.   US EBITDA 
growth is decelerating, and US EBITDA margin declined 51 bp y-y in 1H18.  
 
 The large number of new beds being added in the US acute psychiatric 
market requires staffing by psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, and other healthcare 
workers.  Psychiatrists are generally not employed by ACHC, and as independent 
contractors they can follow the patients (and the money) to newer facilities with 
better patient mix and reimbursement.  Nursing and other healthcare staff shortages 
are driving up costs and slowing the addition of new staffed beds.  To keep costs 
under control, it appears that ACHC may be increasingly understaffing its 
facilities.  Since the beginning of 2018, serious problems at ACHC facilities have 
been reported by local media outlets in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and 
Florida.   We are reminded that similar quality problems arose for Psychiatric 
Solutions, culminating in extensive exposés by the Los Angeles Times and 
ProPublica in November 2008. 
 
 Competition is also increasing for the company’s outpatient and residential 
addiction treatment centers.  Newer medication-assisted therapy (MAT) start-ups 
are locating new facilities near ACHC’s existing centers, many of which were 
originally methadone clinics. For example, private equity backed CleanSlate 
Centers is taking advantage of increased public acceptance of opioid addiction as a 
disease to place its centers in desirable locations such as office buildings or on or 
near medical campuses.  The older centers ACHC acquired from Bain Capital are 
often in undesirable parts of the same towns, remnants of a time when no one 
wanted to see or live near a methadone clinic and its unsavory customers.  
 


ACHC’s residential addiction treatment centers also face increasing 
competition, as evidenced by recent crackdowns on rehab patient brokering by 
Google and state regulators.  Moreover, increased acceptance of MAT outpatient 
therapy may reduce the number of patients who seek much more expensive, often 
ineffective residential addiction treatment in ACHC’s facilities. 


 
ACHC’s UK business has faced challenges since the February 2016 


acquisition of Priory Group.  Antitrust concerns forced divestments of higher 
margin facilities at a loss of $175M. The NHS, which funds most of the care 
provided by ACHC in the UK, appears to be cutting funding for behavioral health, 
and shortages of nurses and other healthcare workers are intensifying, driving up 
labor costs.  UK constant currency revenue growth was 4.5% y-y in 1H18, while
5 


EBITDA declined 130 bp y-y.  Total constant currency UK EBITDA was flat y-y 
in 1H18. 


 
The “street” expects $3.04B in revenue in 2018 and $3.22B in 2019, with 


EBITDA of $635M and $682M, and EPS of $2.53 and $2.76, respectively.   We 
model $3.05B in revenue in 2018 and $3.13B in 2019, with EBITDA of $624M 
and $621M, and EPS of $2.42 and $2.21, respectively.  Our $25.80 future fair 
value estimate is based on an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.7x our 2019 EBITDA of 
$621M, a premium to UHS (8.5x) and HCA (8.6x).

Background: 
 
 ACHC was founded in 2005 by private equity firm Waud Capital Partners. It 
became a public company after its November 2011 merger with publicly traded 
PHC.  Waud exited its ACHC investment in 2017.  In the US, ACHC operates 211 
facilities, including about 37 acute inpatient hospitals, 42 US residential recovery 
centers (addiction/eating disorders), 117 comprehensive treatment centers 
(outpatient addiction facilities), and 13 residential treatment centers for 
children/adolescents.  In the UK, it operates 373 facilities, ranging from acute 
psychiatric hospitals to long-term care homes for children, adults, and the elderly.  
The revenue mix for 2017 by type of facility is presented on the table below.

 ACHC’s US markets are very fragmented.  Its single largest competitor in 
the freestanding behavioral health facility market Universal Health Services
6 


(UHS), which operates 213 behavioral health facilities in the US, and 110 in the 
UK.  An underappreciated class of competitors in the US market is psychiatric 
units in US acute care hospitals.  As shown on the table below, data from the 
National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors suggests that at the 
end of 2014, 48% of acute psychiatric inpatients were being treated in acute care 
hospital psychiatric units, more than the 39% who were being treated in private 
psychiatric hospitals.  Acute hospitals also treat an unknown number of psychiatric 
patients in “scatter beds” in their general wards.

ACHC’s payor mix varies significantly by type of facility. Until recently, 


services delivered in its US acute inpatient facilities were reimbursed only by 
commercial insurance and Medicare.  Similarly, its US residential recovery 
services are paid for almost entirely by commercial insurance and self-pay by 
patients and their families.  Its outpatient addiction services are paid by a mix of 
commercial insurance, Medicaid, and self-pay, while its residential treatment 
centers for children/adolescents are paid primarily by Medicaid.  In the UK, the 
NHS and other public sources pay for most services.  Across all US facilities, in 
2017 32% of US revenue came from commercial payors, 16% came from 
Medicare, 44% came from Medicaid, and 9% came from self-pay (net of doubtful 
accounts).  The US payor mix is shifting away from higher margin 
commercial/Medicare/self-pay towards Medicaid, for reasons we discuss below. 
 


Under CMS rules established with the creation of Medicaid in 1965, 
Medicaid funds could not be used to treat adult Medicaid patients (aged 19-64) in 
acute inpatient psychiatric facilities with more than 16 psychiatric beds.  CMS 
defines these facilities as Institutions of Mental Disease (IMDs), which were to be 
funded directly by the states (i.e. state asylums).  Adult Medicaid patients were 
therefore typically treated in hospital EDs until a bed could be found in small 
hospital psychiatric units, or in “scatter beds” in hospitals without dedicated 
psychiatric unites, or at state mental hospitals with acute care facilities.  ACHC’s
7 


freestanding psychiatric hospitals, which usually have 80 or more beds, could not 
be reimbursed for treating Medicaid patients, and so did not admit them.  


 
CMS’ policy benefited ACHC in two ways.  First, it was a boon to its 


margins, since its acute psychiatric hospitals admitted only more profitable 
commercially-insured and Medicare patients.  Second, it restrained competition, 
since acute care hospitals could not have more than 16 beds psychiatric beds 
without risking being defined as an IMD and losing reimbursement for psychiatric 
services to Medicaid patients.  An exception was academic hospitals in urban 
areas, which often have large psychiatric units that are paid for with federal 
funding provided to hospitals that serve large numbers of indigent patients. 
  


In July 2016, CMS changed the rule, allowing Medicaid managed care 
programs to pay for up to 15 days per month of acute inpatient psychiatric care and 
substance abuse disorders (SUDs) in acute psychiatric facilities with more than 16 
beds.  Medicaid fee-for-service patients still cannot be treated in these facilities, 
but more than 67% of adults on Medicaid are enrolled in Medicaid managed care.  
As shown on the table below, we estimate this rule change increased the number of 
patients aged 19-64 eligible to be admitted to these facilities from 140.5M before 
the change to 160.3M after the change, a 14% increase.

 The potential of this new market was not lost on ACHC’s competitors.  
Since April 2016, there has been a dramatic increase in the construction of new 40-
8 


100 bed freestanding psychiatric hospitals across the US.  These facilities are 
backed by private equity, real estate investors, or by hospitals themselves.   There 
are also significant expansions of existing facilities, both freestanding and those 
within acute care hospitals.  Moreover, acute care hospitals appear to be keeping 
more, higher paying commercially insured and Medicare patients in their own 
beds, and referring Medicaid patients to ACHC’s facilities, pulling down ACHC 
US margins. 
 
 As we discuss below, ACHC faces significant challenges to its near term 
growth.  The US acute inpatient segment is facing increased competition and 
patient mix shifts, growth is slowing in its residential recovery segment, and 
competition is intensifying for its CTC segment.  Its UK segment is being hurt by 
NHS budget cuts.  Wages in both the US and in the UK are rising.  Growth from 
additional sizable acquisitions may be thwarted by its already high debt and rising 
interest rates.  As shown on the table below, we think these challenges should lead 
to lower revenue, EBITDA, and EPS than the “street” expects.

Discussion: 


 
1. A recent boom in construction of freestanding psychiatric hospitals is creating 


more competition for ACHC. 
 


When CMS changed the rules and allowed Medicaid managed care patients 
access to freestanding psychiatric hospitals, ACHC predicted acute care hospitals 
would want to partner with ACHC in JVs to take advantage of the opportunity.  In 
December 2016, the CEO said there were 12 ongoing discussions for JVs with 
large nonprofit systems.  The number jumped to 16 discussions in February 2017, 
and to 20 in April 2017.  Despite the optimism, more than two years after the 
change, only six JVs have opened or are in development.  JVs with Erlanger (TN)
9 


and Ochsner (LA) have opened, while those with Tower Health (PA) and Mount 
Carmel (OH) are under construction. Two more have been announced and are in 
early development (St. Thomas, University of Miami).   


 
Our research suggests that after an initial surge in activity in 2017, hospitals 


are no longer choosing to partner with ACHC, UHS, or with other behavioral 
health operators such as SUN Behavioral Health and US Healthvest.  As shown 
below, we found two such deals announced in 2015, four in 2016, eight in 2017, 
but only one so far in 2018.

Since mid-2016, acute care hospitals appear much more likely to expand 


their existing units or even build their own freestanding psychiatric hospitals.  This 
makes sense, because these hospital operators do not need outside management 
expertise.  By expanding independently, hospitals do not have to share the 
economics or pay management fees.  Our search for announced behavioral health 
expansions by acute care hospitals came up with just one expansion announcement 
in 2015 and two in 2016.  In 2017, however, we found 13 announcements, 
followed by 17 thus far in 2018. We think this list is far from comprehensive, 
because many expansions may not warrant a press release or local news coverage.

expanding their freestanding psychiatric hospitals, further adding to supply and 
competition for the best paying patients.  Our search for announced behavioral 
health de novos and expansions by behavioral health operators came up with one 
de novo announcement in 2014, six in 2015, six in 2016, eight in 2017, and eight 
so far in 2018.  Again, we think this list is far from comprehensive.  Many 
additional projects may be under development.

A particularly active player is US Healthvest, backed by Polaris, Oak 


HC/FT, and F-Prime, with five announced de novos since July 2016.  Signature 
Healthcare (Aurora) signed a sale-leaseback deal with Care Capital Properties in 
April 2017, and has two announced de novos since July 2016, as does Welsh 
Carson’s Springstone.  PE-backed SUN Behavioral has one. 
 
2. Acute care hospitals are keeping more profitable managed care/Medicare, 


sending Medicaid patients to ACHC, shifting the payor mix. 
 


Acute psychiatric patient referrals most commonly come from hospital 
emergency rooms.  These patients are a danger to themselves or others, and so 
cannot be turned away.  Prior to 2016, the only way for hospitals to get these 
patients out of their emergency rooms was to admit them to their own small 
psychiatric units or their general ward “scatter beds,” or wait until a bed opened in 
a state hospital acute care unit.  Now, hospitals are using their referral power to 
quickly send Medicaid managed care patients to freestanding psychiatric hospitals 
such as those run by ACHC, and they are keeping more profitable commercially 
insured and Medicare patients.  UHS has blamed this dynamic for the increase it 
has seen in Medicaid revenue and flat commercial insurance and Medicare revenue 
it has seen for the past few quarters. 


 
ACHC management has denied that this dynamic is impacting ACHC, 


saying instead that Medicaid revenue is increasing due to higher revenue from its 
outpatient addiction treatment centers, which are receiving increased state funding.   
“Street” analysts have not pressed management on its earnings calls, perhaps 
because the company does not report revenue by payor in its earnings releases, and 
does so only in its SEC filings.
12 


As shown on the tables below, ACHC’s Medicaid revenue has increased by 
12%-14% y-y for the past three quarters.  This is very unlikely to be from 
outpatient addiction treatment centers (CTCs), especially since the company has 
added only 10 new CTCs since 2015.  Moreover, the increase in Medicaid revenue 
coincides with slowing growth followed by declines in commercial and Medicare 
revenue from 4Q17 to 2Q18.  We think ACHC is experiencing the same patient 
mix shift phenomenon that UHS is being more upfront about.

ACHC seems likely to lose even more commercially insured patients as 


competitors open new facilities in its markets.  If a hospital’s own acute facility is 
full, we think it is more likely to send commercially insured patients to the newest 
facilities in its area, rather than to ACHC’s older, tired facilities.  Moreover, new 
facilities may have relationships with the area’s top psychiatrists, who can 
influence referrals.  This could leave ACHC with even more Medicaid patients, 
and therefore less for more well off patients, perhaps, in the end, making ACHC’s 
older facilities into facilities primarily for the underprivileged.   


 
3. ACHC’s US EBITDA margins are under pressure. 


 
The shift in payor mix toward Medicaid has been accompanied by slowing 


US segment EBITDA growth and an accelerating decline in ACHC’s US segment
13 


EBITDA margins.  As shown in the table below, US segment EBITDA increased 
only 1.3% y-y in 2Q18 versus an 8.2% y-y increase in 2Q17 and a 4.3% y-y 
increase in 1Q18.  US segment EBITDA margins fell -82 bp y-y in 2Q18 versus a 
26 bp y-y increase in 2Q17 and a -18 bp y-y decline in 1Q18.

4. Shortages of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, and other healthcare workers are 


driving up US wage costs 
 
The rapid expansion of US acute inpatient psychiatric beds, combined with 


tougher immigration laws and low unemployment, have created staffing shortages 
for acute psychiatric facilities like ACHC’s.  ACHC has acknowledged as much on 
its earnings calls, but claims it can keep costs under control.  It has blamed higher 
wage costs primarily on issues in the UK, which we discuss below.  Competitor 
UHS has attributed labor shortages in its US behavioral health business to the 
economic recovery, since nurses and health technicians are finding more pleasant 
and better paid work elsewhere. We think wage pressures are likely to intensify in 
the US, as the facilities under development we identified in Tables 5-7 look for 
experienced staff. 


 
5. Recent incidents at ACHC facilities suggest ACHC may be cutting staffing to 


dangerous levels. 
 


Unfortunately for ACHC’s patients, the company may already be working 
with reduced staffing levels due to shortages and/or to save costs.  We have 
identified reported safety incidents at five ACHC facilities in five different states 
just since the beginning of 2018.  We provide links to media reports of these 
incidents below.  In Ohio, the situation was bad enough that OhioHealth, OSU, 
Netcare and Mount Carmel (an ACHC JV partner) halted referrals to ACHC’s 
Ohio Hospital for Psychiatry in May 2018.  This followed the publication of a 
scathing report (http://www.disabilityrightsohio.org/dro_report_problems_at_ohp) by 
Disability Rights Ohio, detailing problems at the hospital.

6.  Increasing competition for medication-assisted treatment patients (MAT) limits 


growth, and threatens the residential addiction center business. 
 
ACHC has about 117 outpatient addiction treatment centers that it calls 


comprehensive treatment centers (CTCs).  It bought 88 of them in 2015 with its 
acquisitions of CRC Health and QAM.  It acquired another 19 in November 2015 
in its Discovery House acquisition.   Since then it has added only 10 more. 


 
In contrast, PE backed start-ups are rapidly adding centers.  For example, 


CleanSlate Centers has grown from 23 centers in 2017 to 45 centers in August 
2018.  By the end of 2018, it expects to have 65 centers.  In May 2018, the
15 


company raised $25M in a private round led by HealthQuest Capital and Granite 
Growth Partners.  Another start up is MedMark Treatment centers, backed by 
Webster Capital, that has 167 centers in 26 states. 


 
In Massachusetts, CleanSlate has opened facilities in some of the same 


towns as ACHC’s facilities.  For example, in Springfield, MA, CleanSlate’s 
facility at 1985 Main Street is less than a mile from ACHC’s CTC facility at 2257 
Main Street.  CleanSlate locations seem much more desirable than ACHC’s, which 
began life as methadone clinics serving patients that no one wanted to live near or 
see.  Now that opioid addiction is recognized as a disease of the upper and middle 
classes, and medication treatment options include more accepted alternatives like 
Suboxone and Vivitrol, CleanSlate is able to locate its facilities in office 
complexes with ample parking in safe locations.  We think patients, who can 
choose where they receive treatment, are likely voting with their feet and moving 
to CleanSlate. 


 
 We think medication assisted treatment (MAT) with Suboxone and Vivitrol 
represents an emerging threat to ACHC’s residential recovery business.  As 
patients become more educated about the dismal outcomes of 30-day addiction 
programs such as those offered by ACHC, they are more likely to try long term 
treatment with medication.  This is likely to be a preferred option for insurers, as 
well, since MAT can be much less expensive than residential treatment. 
 
 ACHC’s residential recovery centers also face competition from many start-
ups and some unscrupulous providers, as shown by recent crackdowns on patient 
brokering by Google and through Congressional investigations.   We have no 
reason to think that ACHC engages in such practices, but it may be caught in the 
crossfire if insurers crackdown on reimbursement for these services. 
 
7.  Same facility patient day growth has slowed, suggesting US occupancy rates 


may come under pressure. 
 
Management grows same facility patient days by adding beds to existing 


facilities.  It says it carefully manages these additions, waiting until occupancy 
rates are consistently exceeding 80% and it is turning away patients, so it knows it 
can fill the added capacity.  This has kept margins high.  With so much new 
capacity entering the market, however, ACHC may be faced with lower occupancy 
rates and lower margins. 


 
Slowing growth in same facility patient days suggests recent occupancy 


rates are not strong enough to justify significant new bed additions.  As shown 
below, same facility patient days grew only 2% in 1H18, down from about 6% in
16 


1H17.  If same facility patient days turn negative in future quarters, it would 
suggest occupancy rates are declining.

8. NHS funding for behavioral health in the UK is under pressure, keeping 


ACHC’s UK growth in low single digits 
 
ACHC’s UK business has faced challenges since its February 2016 


acquisition of Priory Group.  UK antitrust officials forced ACHC to divest 21 of its 
UK facilities due to overlap with UK facilities that ACHC acquired in 2014.  The 
sale, completed in November 2016, was booked at a loss of $175M.  The divested 
facilities had higher EBITDA margins than the facilities ACHC was allowed to 
keep, so the divestment was a drag on UK and total EBITDA margins.    


 
ACHC is also dealing with the repercussions of the Brexit vote in June 2016, 


which has lowered the value of the GBP and the profits it can bring back to the US.  
It has also exacerbated belt tightening by the NHS, which funds most of the care 
provided by ACHC in the UK.  As shown on the tables below, so far in 2018, the 
total number of people in NHS England’s system receiving early intervention in 
psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, and a disturbed relationship with reality) is 
declining by 8%-10% y-y.  Waiting lists are growing at a worrying 10%-11% y-y.

 Once the Priory acquisition lapped in February 2016, UK constant currency 
revenue growth was about 3% y-y for the remaining quarters in 2017.  The first 
half has seen bump up to 4.2% y-y in 1Q18 and 4.6% y-y in 2Q18, in part because 
of an acquisition in Scotland in November 2017 for $21M.  Management also says 
it is repurposing beds in some of its facilities to meet areas of stronger demand, 
which may be contributing to revenue.  We are modeling slightly better 5% y-y 
growth in the UK for 2019.

The new revenue does not appear to be boosting EBITDA, however.   In 
2Q18, UK segment constant currency EBITDA declined 1.8% y-y versus a 3% y-y 
increase in 1Q18.  UK segment EBITDA margin declined -140 bp y-y in 2Q18 to 
19.1% versus a -21 bp decline in 1Q18.  We think margins should continue to 
decline in 2019 to 19.8% for the full year, a 30 bp y-y decline.  
 
9.  Labor shortages caused by Brexit and mandatory NHS wage increases adopted 


in May 2018 are pressuring UK margins  
 


As shown on the table below, the Nurse and Midwifery Council reports that 
the number of mental health nurses registered in the UK has been declining since 
at least 2015, with declines accelerating in 2017 post Brexit.  


 
Table 14:  Mental Health Nurses Registered in the UK, March 2015-March 2018

Source:  https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/new-nmc-figures-continue-to-highlight-major-concern-as-
more-eu-nurses-leave-the-uk/ 


 
The declines are due at least in part to EU nurses across all disciplines 


leaving the UK.  From April 2017-March 2018, net immigration to the UK of 
nurses from the EU was -3,157 compared to +3,301 in April 2016-March 2017 and 
+7,408 in April 2015-March 2016. 


 
In response to union demands and persistent staff shortages, in May 2018 the 


UK government agreed to increase wages for NHS staff.  The lowest paid workers 
will see an 11% y-y increase in 2018, while the average increase for all workers 
(excluding physicians and senior administrators) will be about 6.5% over three 
years (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5861360/nhs-pay-rise-scale-staff-theresa-may-2018/).
18 


 
ACHC management has downplayed the impact of the pay raise on its UK 


business, saying it has always paid more than mandated by NHS.  We think it is 
likely the company will have to maintain the difference versus competitors to keep 
its staff. 
 
 Wage pressures appear to be pressuring ACHC’s EBITDA growth and 
margins.  In 2Q18, UK segment constant currency EBITDA decline 1.8% y-y 
versus a 3% y-y increase in 1Q18. UK segment EBITDA margin declined 140 bp 
y-y in 2Q18 to 19.1% versus a -21 bp decline in 1Q18.  


 
10.   Most of ACHC’s debt carries variable rate interest. 
 


At present, the company has $3.1B in debt, and its current Net 
Debt/EBITDA is 5.1x.  About 55% of debt is senior secured loans with floating 
interest rates of LIBOR plus 2.5% (totaling about 5.3% at present), while the 
remaining 45% of debt is at fixed interest rate debt at a blended 5.9%.  The 
company has about $500M of availability under its revolving credit facility, which 
it has promised to deploy for acquisitions since early 2017.  Its earliest term loan of 
$150M is due in 2021, with another $300M due in 2022 and $650M due in 2023. 


 
On its 2Q18 call, ACHC lowered its expected 2018 EPS range from $2.58-


$2.62 to $2.52-$2.56, citing higher interest rates and FX pressure from a declining 
pound.  Its 2Q18 EPS guidance assumes a 1.30 GBP/USD rate versus 1.35 in 1Q18 
and 1.30 today. 
 
11.  DSO is rising, especially for US Medicaid revenue (42 2Q17, 49 2Q18). 
 


ACHC’s SEC filings report A/R aging by payor type, allowing us to 
calculate DSO for each payor.  In 1Q18, to comply with ASC 606, the company 
began reporting revenue by payor net of doubtful accounts, rather than gross.  We 
think nearly all doubtful accounts are related to its self-pay and other revenue, so 
we calculate DSO using US/UK Self Pay and other revenue net of the entire 
provision for doubtful accounts. 
 
 As shown on the table below, DSO for Commercial, Medicare, and NHS 
have been fairly stable, but Medicaid DSO have increased from 43 and 42 in 1Q17 
and 2Q17 to 50 and 49 days in 1Q18 and 2Q18, respectively.  Total DSO increased 
from 56 in 1Q17 and 2Q17 to 63 and 62 in 1Q18 and 2Q18, respectively.  We 
wonder if Medicaid managed care plans are denying claims or pushing back on 
length of stay in acute inpatient facilities.

12.   Recent results and guidance 
 


ACHC reported 2Q18 revenue of $765.7M, below the $768M expected.  
EBITDA of $165.0M was slightly below expectations of $165.8M.  EPS of $0.70 
was in line with consensus. 


 
The company lowered its full year expectations on the 2Q18 earnings call, 


blaming higher interest rates and a declining British pound.  Total 2018 revenue 
guidance was lowered from $3.04B-$3.08B to $3.02B-$3.06B, and 2018 EPS was 
lowered from $2.58-$2.62 to $2.52-$2.56.  Interest expense guidance for 2018 
increased from $180M to $186M.  The tax rate is expected to be 16% for the 
remainder of 2018.  
 
13.  Financial assumptions 
 


ACHC provides a number of metrics on its quarterly calls, including US and 
UK same facility and total patient days, admissions, length of stay (LOS) and 
revenue per patient day.  These metrics seem to be of limited value in 
understanding ACHC’s business.  They are blended values for ACHC’s many 
different types of facilities, which have very different pricing, LOS, and revenue 
per day. 


 
We model ACHC’s US revenue by payor.  We expect US commercial 


insurance revenue to continue to decline, as more patients stay in psychiatric units 
of acute care hospitals, or are referred to newer facilities.  We model a 1.4% y-y 
decline in 2018, and a 2.0% y-y decline in 2019.   For similar reasons, we expect 
Medicare revenue to continue to decline, and model a 2.5% decline in 2018 and 
2.7% decline in 2019. 


 
We expect growth in Medicaid revenue to decelerate, as the surge in newly 


available Medicaid managed care patients is absorbed, and competition intensifies.  
Note that while the reimbursement change became effective in July 2016, its full 
effect was not in place until July 2017, since individual states had to approve the
20 


change, and ACHC has to contract with Medicaid managed care plans.  We expect 
Medicaid revenue to grow 12.4% y-y in 2018 and 5.0% y-y in 2019. 


 
We model total US revenue growth of 4.5% y-y in 2018 and 1.4% y-y in 


2019, versus “street” expectations of 5.7% growth in 2018 and 5.6% growth in 
2019.  We model UK revenue growth of 12.7% (aided by 4%-5% appreciation in 
the British pound) in 2018 and 5.0% in 2019, versus “street” expectations of 10.3% 
growth in 2018 and 5.7% growth in 2019. 


 
We expect lower US occupancy rates and rising wage costs in both the US 


and UK to lower EBITDA margins.  We project US segment EBITDA margin will 
fall 55 bp in 2018 to 25.7%, and a further 99 bp in 2019 to 24.7%.  We project UK 
segment EBITDA margin will fall 50 bp in 2018 to 18.8%, and a further 30 bp in 
2019 to 18.5%. 


 
We project corporate/other overhead of $80M in 2018, below the company’s 


guidance on its 4Q17 call of $90M, but in line with its current run rate.  We 
estimate $78M in corporate/other overhead in 2019.  Our total EBITDA margin 
estimate is 20.5% for 2018 and 19.8% for 2019 versus the “street” expectation of 
20.9% and 21.2%. 
 
14.  Valuation 
 


ACHC shares currently trade at an EV/2019 EBITDA of 9.3x.  Since it 
stopped levering up in mid-2016, shares have traded between 6.9x and 10.6x 
forward EBITDA.  Its closest peer, UHS, trades at 8.5x, while HCA trades at 8.6x.    


 
ACHC’s multiple should compress, as investors realize the supply of acute 


care psychiatric beds in the US is rapidly increasing, and hospitals are holding on 
to the most profitable patients.  We think even experienced operators like ACHC’s 
management will find it difficult to overcome competitive supply issues and 
hospital referral patterns that are now out of its control. 
 


The “street” expects $3.04B in revenue in 2018 and $3.22B in 2019, with 
EBITDA of $635M and $682M, and EPS of $2.53 and $2.76, respectively.   We 
model $3.05B in revenue in 2018 and $3.13B in 2019, with EBITDA of $624M 
and $621M, and EPS of $2.42 and $2.21, respectively.  Our $25.80 future fair 
value estimate is based on an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.7x our 2019 EBITDA of 
$627.4M, still a premium to UHS (8.5x) and HCA (8.6x). 
 
15.  Risks
21 


Risks to achieving our target price include changes in reimbursement, 
including Congressional or CMS actions allowing allow fee-for-service Medicaid 
patients to be admitted to ACHC’s freestanding psychiatric hospitals.  Bills to 
make this change are periodically introduced in the House and Senate, but no 
action has occurred to date.  In the UK, NHS may allocate more funding of mental 
health services. 


 
ACHC could make another acquisition with its $500M revolver, as it has 


been promising to do for some time.  Further UK acquisitions appear out of the 
question due to antitrust issues.  In the US, we suspect ACHC management is 
aware of the increasing psychiatric bed capacity in hospitals and freestanding units, 
and is not willing to pay for assets that are likely to face the same challenges as it 
sees in the rest of its business.
