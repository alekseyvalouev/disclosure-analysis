DAVIDs TEA: A Toxic Brew Of Sweet Promises Overpowered By Bitter
Reality

Summary


A Canadian retailer with ambitious plans to take the U.S. market by storm, DTEA
has adopted the same kind of strategy that almost bankrupted its co-founder's first
company.


With its new Canadian stores cannibalizing sales at its older locations, DTEA has
decided to bet its future on a risky U.S. expansion plan that could easily backfire.


Despite the weak performance of its U.S. stores to date, DTEA wants to open
hundreds of new locations in “Class A” shopping malls all over the country.


That goal seems wildly optimistic, however, since a rival tea retailer – owned by the
formidable Starbucks beverage chain – has already entered most of the country's
high-end shopping malls.


Given the challenges that DTEA faces, company insiders might feel tempted to start
unloading mountains of stock once a temporary “lockup” period expires just a few
short weeks from now.


DAVIDs TEA (NASDAQ: DTEA) needs to wake up and smell the coffee. After exploding
onto the Nasdaq as an overheated high flier - and promptly burning the investors who had
just swallowed its story - DTEA should feel lucky if it can even sleep at all.


A Canadian retail chain that recently went public with a celebrated (if misguided) plan to
take the U.S. market by storm, DTEA has lost half of the lofty valuation that it achieved
just before the company issued its first quarterly report and blindsided the market with its
ugly financial results. At this point, DTEA owes the public a whole lot more than a simple
apology. If DTEA even hopes to redeem itself, the company needs to somehow prove that
its growth strategy actually makes good business sense.


With so much evidence pointing in the opposite direction, however, DTEA could find that
argument difficult to win (or even to defend). Not that the company seems particularly
eager to debate the merits of its case right now. Blaming a so-called "quiet period" for its

silence (the same excuse that the company provided a reporter barely a week AFTER it
had just released its quarterly results), DTEA declined an invitation to answer questions
for this story.


Who knows? Maybe DTEA decided to buy itself some extra time after realizing that it still
needed to finish its homework. The company might as well save itself the trouble at this
point. By the time that it reaches the end of this extensive report - or even the crucial
section that undermines the centerpiece of its mall-based U.S. expansion plan - DTEA
should feel nervous enough to think twice about betting its future on a risky growth
strategy that seems like such a terrible idea.


Take a look at some of the most obvious warning signs that the company has somehow
managed to overlook or (even worse) chosen to ignore.


* Trouble at home: DTEA obviously decided to take a big chance on the U.S. market for
a reason. By now, DTEA has opened so many stores in its home country of Canada that it
needed to look elsewhere for growth. Shortly after its IPO, in fact, DTEA suddenly
revealed that - with its newly opened stores now stealing business away from its more
established locations - same-store traffic in Canada had declined for the first time in its
entire history.


"With 1Q15 traffic turning negative in Canada, management sees future SSS growth
in the region driven by ticket gains, with a decline in ticket potentially putting into
question DTEA's long-term low-mid single-digit SSS targets," JP Morgan cautioned
when it initiated coverage of DTEA with a lukewarm neutral rating in spite of the
generous underwriting fees that it had just collected for taking the company public.
"Management has attributed traffic declines to cannibalization from new stores …
Looking ahead, management sees this cannibalization to traffic continuing, with
forward-looking SSS in Canada driven primarily by higher ticket (AND) traffic flat to
down over time."


* Sticker shock: DTEA has relied on a handy - if ultimately unsustainable - trick to
prevent its overall same-store sales from sliding into negative territory, too. While same-
store traffic has remained essentially flat for the past six quarters in a row, its skimpy
disclosures show, DTEA has tried to make up for those stagnant crowds by collecting
more and more from the customers who do wander into its high-end retail stores. If not for
the helpful boost provided by the steady rise in its average ticket price, DTEA would have
seen its same-store sales inch up by less than 1% in 2014 and actually slide during the
first half of the current year

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3672616-davids-tea-toxic-brew-sweet-promises-overpowered-bitter-reality 3/16


No wonder DTEA seems reluctant to disclose the crucial traffic and ticket metrics that
most retailers normally share as a matter of routine. As illustrated by the chart below
(pieced together with the help of figures grudgingly supplied by DTEA only after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly intervened), the company has plenty to
hide.


Time Period FY 2013 FY 2014 1Q 2015 2Q 2015


Ticket Growth 13.0% 10.2% 7.2% 6.9%


Traffic Growth 4.2% 0.9% - 0.8% 0.0%


SSS Growth 17.8% 11.1% 6.3% 6.9%


* Ticket and traffic growth figures based upon disclosures supplied by DTEA in its
regulatory filings, press releases and quarterly conference calls.


* Weak U.S. results: When DTEA decided to shift its focus from Canada to the U.S. -
where it tends to spend more on its stores and receive far less in return - the company
basically elected to sacrifice margins for growth and hope for the best. While its Canadian
stores generate close to $1 million in revenue, on average, its U.S. stores muster barely
half of that amount. Far less of that revenue drops to the bottom line, too. Since 2011,
when DTEA first entered the U.S. market, the company has seen its gross margins
steadily decline from 57% to less than 50% after opening just 27 of the 300 U.S. locations
that it ultimately hopes to operate in spite of the heavy toll on its financial results.

* Calculations based upon figures supplied in DTEA filings and/or analyst models


"Our future growth depends, to a considerable extent, on our expansion efforts
outside of Canada into the United States," DTEA explained in the registration
statement that it filed shortly before the company went public. "In connection with our
initial expansion efforts in the United States, we have experienced longer projected
payback periods for our new stores. Although we are currently targeting cash-on-
cash paybacks of approximately three years in the United States (compared to two
years in Canada), we have not yet achieved this in any of our U.S. stores" to date.


Still waiting for DTEA to produce some tangible evidence that it can achieve its lofty goals,
Goldman Sachs has chosen to remain on the sidelines (along with fellow underwriter
JPMorgan) even after collecting lucrative investment banking fees from the company.


"Given the large DTEA opportunity depends on the U.S., U.S. expansion risk may
warrant discounting the valuation and growth potential," Goldman Sachs explained
when it initiated coverage of the company with a tepid neutral rating of its own.
"Several U.S. stores have been performing below plan, given higher costs and lower
initial sales productivity… While management says they feel comfortable re-
accelerating growth based off of learnings, we note learnings are vague aside from
keeping costs down and ensuring traffic is sufficient."


* LIMITED MALL SPACE: For some reason that it has never bothered to fully explain,
DTEA seems to think that it can still make a big splash in the U.S. by opening hundreds of
wildly successful stores in "Class A" shopping malls all over the country. Good luck with
that. While DTEA may want to start selling its pricey merchandise in those high-end
shopping malls, since they tend to attract large crowds of the affluent Christmas
shoppers who account for so much of its business, the company should have come
up with that idea a whole lot sooner. At this point, a formidable competitor - owned by
one of the savviest real estate players in the entire retail industry - has effectively beaten
DTEA to the punch. A rival chain purchased by Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) a few

years ago, Teavana, has already established a presence in more than 200 of the
estimated 265 high-end (Class A+, Class A and even Bloomingdale-anchored Class
B) malls located in this country. Moreover, Starbucks sounds very committed to further
expanding Teavana's impressive turf


"Teavana-branded beverages ((are)) the fastest-growing product segment inside
Starbucks," the company has proclaimed. "We see tea growing faster and being an
even larger business (in the future). We're going to continue to go after tea very, very
aggressively."


Keep in mind that Starbucks could have established an even bigger head start at this point
by sticking with its original plan to open even more Teavana locations - further limiting the
number of high-end shopping malls that DTEA could enter without competition - if the
company actually felt confident that it could bank on plenty of customer demand. Stuck
with the leftovers, DTEA now faces a handful of options (none of them particularly good):
the company can follow Teavana into the high-end malls that it already occupies and try to
capture a decent share of the business that a single tea retailer might otherwise enjoy on
its own; it can rush into the high-end malls that Teavana has yet to enter and hope that, by
cautiously remaining on the sidelines, Starbucks has messed up for a rare change; or the
company can just come to its senses and try to come up with a realistic business plan.


* Insider sales: DTEA insiders stand to make a bundle, whether the company ever makes
it in the U.S. or not. Currently restricted from selling a mountain of stock that has lost a big
chunk of its original value, DTEA insiders will soon face a tempting opportunity to start
cashing in their shares when a so-called "lockup" period expires - suddenly freeing three-
quarters of the company's outstanding shares for sale - just a few short weeks from now.
Some of those lucky insiders have already jumped at the chance to strike it rich, in fact,
and walked away from the company's recent IPO as multimillionaires. Even the former
CEO and COO, sent packing with nice severance packages the previous year, managed
to hit seven-figure jackpots.


DTEA Co-Founder David Segal tied for the biggest prize of all, pocketing more than $13
million in exchange for a full third of his stake in the company that actually carries his
name. His elderly cousin and fellow Co-Founder Herschel Segal pocketed millions, too,
and still emerged from the IPO with so much leftover stock to sell that he effectively owns
more than half of the entire company. If the older Segal decides to follow up by selling
even a relatively modest portion of his gigantic stake in DTEA - currently worth a

whopping $180 million even after losing almost half of its value in recent month - Mr. Segal
could walk away with a staggering fortune that makes his first payout seem almost like
pocket change.


Confessions of a DTEA Co-Founder: Previous U.S. expansion "biggest business
mistake" - ever


For the 84-year-old industry veteran, that temptation could prove especially difficult to
resist. As Mr. Segal must surely realize, DTEA has chosen to bet its future on the same
kind of growth strategy that almost bankrupted his first company. By the time that DTEA
opened its doors back in 2008, Mr. Segal had already tried to expand another Canadian
retail chain into the U.S. market - with miserable results - and spent years lamenting that
decision as "the biggest business mistake" of his entire career.


Mr. Segal "used the proceeds from the (IPO) to finance what turned out to be a disastrous
U.S. expansion," The Toronto Star reminded the public decades after his Le Chateau
clothing chain - once popular in Canada but now hanging by a thread - first entered the
country. "Closing most of the U.S. stores cost him millions… In hindsight, he feels he didn't
know the market, wasn't living there and hadn't worked in it. (Still), he wasn't the first - or
last - Canadian to take a bath on the U.S. market."


After following in the footsteps of its co-founder's original chain - led for the past decade
by yet another member of the company's incestuous board - DTEA can only blame itself if
it winds up on that growing list of casualties. With so many successful Canadian retailers
struggling to make a name for themselves in the challenging U.S. market over the years,
DTEA probably should have paid a little more attention to the painful lesson that its co-
founder already learned (at least once) the hard way.


Full CEO Bio: Complete with forgotten scandals, hidden bankruptcies and all


DTEA better hope that history doesn't keep on repeating itself. After all, the company has
decided to roll the dice on both a dangerous growth strategy and a relatively new leader
with a history of failure.


The last time that DTEA Chief Executive Officer Sylvain Toutant got a chance to run the
show, he found himself embroiled in a major government scandal. As the top executive of
the Soceite des Alcools du Quebec (SAQ), a government-owned liquor monopoly, Toutant
ran into serious trouble when the media exposed a controversial price-fixing scheme that
had cost the public millions of dollars under his watch. That discovery ignited widespread
public outrage - along with calls for Toutant to resign - and prompted a major government

investigation that ultimately blamed a pair of SAQ vice presidents (dismissed with
generous severance packages) for initiating the scheme but also faulted their boss for
neglecting his duties and exercising poor oversight.


"It's time for the head of Quebec's Societe des Alcools to explain what he knew, and
when, about inflated SAQ retail prices," The Montreal Gazette demanded as the
controversy unfolded. "The latest bombshell in the executive suite of the SAQ was
the revelation that President Sylvain Toutant knew - as early as last December
(when the scandal first erupted) - that two now-departed SAQ vice presidents were
plotting to price certain products imported from Europe at artificially high levels. This
suggests Toutant knew in detail, right from the beginning, all about the whole sorry
effort."


His reputation badly damaged by the scandals that rocked his unpopular presidency,
Toutant resigned from his cushy appointment at the SAQ back in 2007 and spent the next
seven years answering to bosses before DTEA finally placed him in charge once again.


By then, more than a full decade had passed since Toutant last served as the actual chief
executive of a publicly traded company. Hired as the turnaround CEO of Les Boutiques
San Francisco, a high-end clothing chain that had dug itself into a gigantic hole, Toutant
confidently vowed to transform the bleeding company into "the best (Canadian) retailer" in
the fashion industry. Just a few short months after Toutant took over as its leader,
however, the struggling retail chain wound up filing for bankruptcy protection instead.
Ready to throw in the towel less than two weeks later, Toutant suddenly declared that "the
business's present situation requires another kind of expertise" and - with his next
appointment (at the SAQ) still nine months away - promptly washed his hands of the entire
mess.


By the time that DTEA went public earlier this year, its CEO had scrubbed the dirty stains
left by those back-to-back failures from his professional record. Despite the leadership
roles that Toutant played at both the scandalized liquor monopoly and the bankrupted
clothing chain, his official corporate bio never mentions that he even worked at either one
of those places at all. Unlike its SEC filings, however, the non-offering prospectus that
DTEA filed in Canada discloses a pesky detail that Toutant might have understandably
preferred to conceal: Together with DTEA Chairman Pierre Michaud, the CEO presided
over a mysterious company that filed for bankruptcy just a few months before he took over
as the newly appointed leader of the retail chain.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3672616-davids-tea-toxic-brew-sweet-promises-overpowered-bitter-reality 8/16


Incestuous Boardroom: Stacked with relatives, weakened by death of a crucial
independent


In a series of striking regulatory disclosures, DTEA also exposed the remarkably
incestuous make-up of the company's board: "Our co-founder and one of our directors,
Herschel Segal, is the father of Sarah Segal, who is also currently one of our directors,"
DTEA confessed. Plus, "Herschel Segal and David Segal, our other co-founder and an
executive officer, are second cousins. Mr. Toutant, our president and chief executive
officer, is married to a niece of Mr. Michaud, our chairman" of the board.


With so many relatives packed into its boardroom, DTEA failed to meet the minimum
standards required of most companies even before one of its independent directors
recently died. Instead of filling a majority of its board seats with independent directors, as
the Nasdaq typically demands, DTEA went public with just half of its 10 directors classified
as independent (and somehow managed to include its boardroom chairman in that select
group). Following the recent death of Thomas Stemberg - the managing partner of a
venture capital firm that controlled a 15% stake in DTEA when its leader passed away -
the company's independent directors now account for a clear minority of the members
sitting on its heavily conflicted board.


DTEA first welcomed Stemberg to its boardroom back in the spring of 2012, records show,
when his venture capital firm (Highland Capital Partners) supplied the growing tea chain
with a $10 million cash infusion in exchange for a minority stake in the company. By
selling a quarter of its stock when DTEA went public earlier this year, Highland managed
to recoup its entire investment in the company and even collect a fairly attractive return.
Currently parked on another $50 million worth of stock that it can start selling in a matter
of weeks, Highland may feel reluctant to maintain such a large position in DTEA now that
it can no longer count on its dedicated boardroom representative to provide the company
with some much-needed oversight.


After all, DTEA may have just lost the boardroom director that the company could least
afford to spare. With his firm placing such a big bet on the young retail chain, Stemberg
seemed determined to protect that investment by at least trying to keep the company in
line.


DTEA certainly made one notable change soon after Stemberg arrived on the scene. Back
when DTEA originally invited Stemberg into its cozy boardroom - dominated by three
different members of the Segal family at the time - the company actually relied on the 27-
year-old daughter of its then-Chairman Herschel Segal to serve as its president. Armed

with little more than valuable family connections, young Sarah Segal had by then spent 16
months presiding over the retail chain - even overseeing its early expansion into the U.S.
market - even though she lacked any formal educational training and/or professional
experience in the business field.


"Sarah spent a few years working for environmental causes with the United Nations
in Beijing," Women's Wear Daily reported around the first-year anniversary of her
presidency. "And (she) credits her time there for giving her a 'more traditional tea
education and background'" than others on the executive team.


Talk about a flimsy resume. While her family connections may have proven helpful enough
to preserve her seat on the board - where she continues to serve, alongside her father
and cousin, to this very day - Ms. Segal stepped down as president less than six months
after Stemberg entered the picture.


Token U.S. Headquarters: Only two named executives, both hired from struggling
chains


DTEA must have felt pressured to take another step in the right direction, too. As soon as
Stemberg accepted a seat on its board, DTEA agreed to establish a second headquarters
in the U.S. (where it operated only two locations at the time) before the company moved
forward with a major expansion into the country. By the time that DTEA went public three
years later, however, only two of its named executives actually worked in the U.S., while
the rest of its senior management team remained comfortably at home instead.


Neither one of those lonely U.S. executives resembles a miracle worker, either. Hired by
DTEA as recently damaged goods, both of those executives found a welcome home at the
company - placed in charge of the finance and real estate departments - after serving in
similar capacities at larger publicly traded chains that ran into serious trouble.


DTEA Chief Financial Officer Luis Borgen previously filled the same position (for the first
time ever) at DaVita Healthcare (NYSE:DVA), a big dialysis chain hit with a staggering
government penalty for a long-running kickback scheme that allegedly continued
throughout his entire tenure at the company. With Borgen in charge of its books, DTEA
has made some rather costly mistakes of its own. Less than two weeks after DTEA went
public with a "material weakness" that had already forced the company to restate its
financial results, The Globe and Mail noted at the time, the company stunned the market
with a gigantic loss resulting from the same kind of liability that it had miscalculated in the
past.

The other U.S. executive, hired by DTEA last year to oversee new store development and
since elevated to head of the real estate department, has already helped one retail chain
pursue a misguided expansion plan that turned into a notorious disaster. Prior to
assuming his current position, records show, Edmund Noonan "served in increasing roles
of responsibility" at Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) during a six-year career that began
with a rapid growth spurt and ended with a desperate attempt to reverse the ensuing
damage. By the time that Noonan vacated his post as vice president of real estate at the
once-popular clothing chain last fall, Abercrombie had long since shifted its focus away
from rapidly expanding its presence in both the U.S. and Canada to aggressively shrinking
the size of the damaged retail chain instead.


High-Pressure Sales = Burned-out Staff: 'This is not the DAVIDs TEA I signed up
for… '


Before DTEA rushes to open hundreds of new locations, the company should do itself a
favor and listen to some of the burned-out employees who work at its existing stores.
Under more pressure than ever to hit lofty sales targets during the crucial holiday quarter -
when DTEA generates almost half of its revenue and nearly all of its EBIT (earnings
before interest and taxes) - many of those employees seem convinced that the company
has taken a serious turn for the worse and hopelessly lost its way.


"Ever since we went public, product quality has (in my opinion) gone down, customer
service has plummeted, and the way the staff are treated has become horrible," one
DTEA employee declared just a few weeks ago. "This is not the DavidsTea I signed
up for. I get it: You're responsible to the stock market and stockholders for ever-
increasing profit now, but everyone - from your staff to your customers - is feeling the
effect."


By the time that DTEA raised a bunch of money to finance its ambitious expansion plan,
some of its early fans had already thrown in the towel and effectively given up on the
company.

DTEA "was probably good when there were only a few locations," one former
employee proclaimed months before the company raised a bunch of money to
dramatically expand the size of the chain. "You sound like you had a nice, small-
family feel when you first began and had lots of support for your employees and
stores. Now, you have tons of stores, no support and no dedicated employees …


"You totally don't have it together when it comes to managing your locations," the
former employee concluded in the end. "And obviously, you don't realize how much
money you lose from that" as a result.

time to study DTEA on the long side.

@Melissa these are all very "soft" negatives and you can surely dig up similar stories on every company in the world.
Heck, if you apply your talent to say Warren Buffett you can come up with something perhaps full of big adjectives like
"incestous board" etc. From your style of writing I wonder if you have had success in fiction writing? No pun intended.


That said, and I am long DTEA, you did make me reach for options to protect my position over the lockup expiration.
Unfortunately there are no options listed on DTEA!

Why are the negatives "soft"? The board does seem filled with insiders, and if that's the case, where's the
checks and balances corps need?

That, and the huge lockup period that's ending in a few weeks should be a concern. For all we know though, if
options are available, whatever shares the owners wanted to sell, have already been sold in a matter of
speaking, via puts. Nevermind, I just checked. No options. I just checked (wondering if there's a large open
put position.)


*btw, Berkshire has both Decker and Bill Gates on it's board. Hardly insidious.

they are soft because it is hardly a crime to want to expand one's business in US. Are there risks to the
strategy? of course there are as any strategy.


11 Nov 2015, 11:35 AM


upatnite2
Yes, there are risks, as with any strategy, and we have to figure out the best way for our dollars to bring back
more dollars. 
With DTEA, *if* they can add additional stores here in the US, great! Can they though? That's an unknown,
and at a market cap of 335M, is it worth the risk? 
To your credit, I do wish this article was more balanced, with showing the positives as well (such as, Teavana
and DTEA are different enough, that both should be able to coincide inside malls.) 
Between DTEA and SBUX, I'll take SBUX  
Good luck to you!

DTEA IS A GREAT SHORT!


My Target is $5

climbthemtns
With such a tiny float, DTEA has been a great short term/swing trade. What amount are we talking about in terms of
the lock-up?


12 Nov 2015, 02:29 PM


Melissa Davis, Contributor
Author’s reply »  A lot! According to the filings, DTEA insiders and major holders control 18.56 million shares of stock
that they can start selling once they lockup period expires three weeks from now. To put that figure into perspective,
that's 77% of all the shares issued by the company!

I think the timing of this article being just before the lock-up period is an indication the author is simply trying to put
momentum behind her short bet around the lock-up event. The fact that the author took the time to only respond to
the question regarding the lock-up period is further evidence of her agenda.


For the real DTEA investors here, continue to focus on the product, which is really what sets this company apart from
the rest. Before Starbucks, coffee shops had been around forever. It was the products that Starbucks offered that
made it different. At the time, it was new and innovative, nobody had drank double frappuccinos before, coffee was
new again. DTEA is accomplishing the same thing wth tea, there is nothing else like it in the marketplace. Certainly
not "Teavana," which is a completely different experience/product. Just walk into the two stores and you will notice
this instantly.


Do not forget that Starbucks had a slow start. It takes awhile for the public to accept that a product they have known
all their lives, like coffee or tea, has actually changed for the better.


Melissa, when you're ready to cover your short after the lock-up be sure to send your shares this way. I've already
bought and I'll be adding to and holding this one for the long haul.

David's Tea had no problem establishing presence near Teavana locations in Canada and completely stealing their
business. They've built a very strong brand, but it is a fair point that some of the original appeal (small number of
stores, attentive/enthusiastic staff, concentration on customer experience, etc.) has been lost in the rushed
expansion.


A good example is their recent website redesign which took a very user-friendly experience (old design was clean,
simple and fast-loading) into a usability / user experience nightmare. As someone who does UX / Web Development
for a living, I can pretty much guarantee they did not do proper user testing on it and rushed the development.

I like the differing opinion on the company as it forces me to reassess my bullish conviction on the company. I like its
products and have made a point of seeing as many stores as I can. I speak to the employees to better understand the
business. Why do I like it?  
1 - good products, returning customers, growing business 
2 - cheap valuation as measured by low market cap relative to sales, assets, projected ebitda 
3 - aligned owners who hold 53% of company.  
Why does this thing continue to fall? In my opinion it is little communication (which the author identified) but more
importantly, a transitionary shareholder base. Historically the company was financed with convertibles which have
been selling as they are not long term equity investors. My approach is patience and buy as it falls. The first results
were heavily influenced by convertible liabilities - this too will pass. Stock got a nice boost when they reported Q2 and
nothing has changed since then but t is down 30+%. That's enough for now from my end :)

DAVIDsTEA – DTEA – Far Too Optimistic in a Very Crowded Space


http://bit.ly/1OwN65g

Wine Trader
Aktien-Boersen, 
I suppose you'd think that shorting Peet's Coffee would be a good idea too since, "It competes directly with
Starbucks...which already has a stronghold on the U.S. market and a seemingly endless supply of resources
and cash to do its business with?"  
I suppose you may want to short anyone else that attempts to participate in the coffee or tea business,
because of Starbucks. This is about all I could extrapolate from the article you've posted above for reasons to
short the company. There are no fundamentals, valuation analysis or technical analysis presented in your
article.  
You may for a moment want to consider the value of consumer choice. And the fact that many businesses
can successfully compete within the same space and both enjoy success and profits. Haven't you noticed
there's more than one car on the road? That website looks like it's run by Sesame Street...

So where are the insider sales? The stock price has steadily moved up roughly 30% in December, despite expiry of
the lockup period on Dec 2 and presumed tax-loss selling heading into the end of the year.

I am stunned by the vitriol in some of the dissenting comments of this thread. The past year sure made you guys
speechless. I thought the article is rather insightful, especially with hindsight. But merit of the article aside, the way in
which these dissenters argued was utterly juvenile.
