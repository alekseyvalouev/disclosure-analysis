Globalstar: Wireless Industry Presents United Front Against TLPS,
Putting Globalstar In Danger
Jun. 16, 2015 9:00 AM ET44 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


Today's public panel discussion brings together GOOG, MSFT, and more in the fight
against TLPS.


A wide range of wireless stakeholders now recognizes TLPS as bad technology and
bad policy.


As opposition to TLPS grows, the risk of an FCC rejection has become very real.


Today a who's who of important and influential stakeholders in the wireless industry are
coming together publicly to voice their opposition to Globalstar's (NYSEMKT:GSAT)
proposed Terrestrial Low Power Service (TLPS) - a concept once touted by Globalstar as
the only solution to a dire Wi-Fi spectrum crisis but now increasingly recognized by a
broad and growing range of observers as bad technology and bad public policy.


Details for the event are available here.


Even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),
rivals in businesses like search, have joined forces to highlight TLPS's shortcomings - not
just the interference risks it poses to other users of the 2.4GHz band but the ugly
precedent it would set in granting a single private party de facto control over public
spectrum. Today's event, organized by Microsoft and the non-profit Open Technology
Institute and hosted at Microsoft's Innovation & Policy Center in Washington, D.C., will
include the following experts:


From Google, Dr. Andrew Clegg, the spectrum engineering lead spearheading several
of the company's wireless initiatives;
From Microsoft, Michael Daum, technology policy strategist;
From the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association - a strong and respected
advocate for rural broadband access - Vice President Alex Phillips (a member of the
FCC's Consumer Advisory Committee);
From the Wi-Fi Alliance, the key Wi-Fi industry group, Russell Fox, counsel;
From the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, the leading trade
group for cable companies, Paul Caritj, counsel; and

From the Open Technology Institute, a non-profit think tank focused on "freedom and
justice in the digital age," Michael Calabrese, a member of the U.S. Department of
Commerce's Spectrum Management Advisory Committee and former member of the
president's spectrum reform working group in 2011-12.


Each of these participants has voiced concern about Globalstar's TLPS proposal in FCC
filings. Google's filing is available here and Microsoft's here. WISPA's latest filing is here;
the Wi-Fi Alliance's latest filing is here and NCTA's is here.


The Open Technology Institute has filed criticism here, here and here.


The opposition to TLPS does not fall along conventional partisan or factional lines. While
groups like the Open Technology Institute and the cable industry were at loggerheads over
net neutrality, they agree on the problems with TLPS. Likewise, the predominantly rural-
focused members of WISPA have historically had a strong ally in Ajit Pai, one of the
Republican FCC commissioners, while unlicensed interest groups including the Wi-Fi
Alliance have often benefited from the support of Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the
Democratic commissioners; yet they all see eye to eye on TLPS. Globalstar, by contrast,
has no strong allies, in keeping with its failure to offer any meaningful benefit to the public.
It simply wants special regulatory treatment in a last-gasp bid to keep its failed business
afloat, and the wireless community is increasingly seeing its self-interested spin for what it
is.


Since making our Globalstar short position public, we have always maintained that the
stock is worthless even if the FCC authorizes TLPS. Thus, we did not fear the possibility
of a near-term approval. But given how intense the opposition to TLPS has grown - and
how stubbornly Globalstar has refused to offer even a hint of a compromise - we now
consider a flat rejection of TLPS a very real possibility. Without the benefit of post-approval
hype over TLPS, it will be hard to prolong Globalstar's survival much longer.


Globalstar supporters once contended that Google, Microsoft, and big cable companies
were among the most likely bidders in what they dreamed would be a frenzied private
auction of Globalstar's spectrum; now that all three have put TLPS's very existence in
serious jeopardy with their strong opposition, that narrative - always, in truth, ridiculous - is
shattered beyond repair. While some shareholders console themselves with the fantasy
that all this opposition must mean that TLPS is somehow a "threat" to the tech giants and
thus very valuable, the reality is that a paid, exclusive Wi-Fi channel would have no effect
on anyone's business model unless its deployment got far enough to cause harmful
interference. Otherwise, how exactly would an exclusive Wi-Fi channel reduce Google or

Microsoft's profits? Indeed, if TLPS were anything like what Globalstar's hype portrays it to
be - a massive boost to Wi-Fi capacity and the cure to a devastating "congestion"
epidemic - then all of these organizations would be eager to support it. The fact that they
are not further discredits Globalstar's case. The efforts of the Wi-Fi Alliance, WISPA,
Google, Microsoft, and others have nothing to do with fears of competition - in the case of
a nonprofit group like the Open Technology Institute, the very concept is meaningless -
and everything to do with the long-term downsides of sacrificing public spectrum to private
entities in exchange for nothing of value.


We hope that today's event will draw more attention to the true nature of TLPS and further
demonstrate how out of touch and isolated Globalstar really is.

but not too long ago you said TLPS won't work. Now it's bad policy? You guys are a joke. You have changed your
tune numerous times. First it can't work..then it won't work then it causes interference.. then it's bad policy. The facts
are TLPS works..causes no interference as suggested and is great policy. You posted this pice as soon as GSAT
popped up 8%..you guys should be sued.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We've never changed our tune. What you seem to perceive as a changing tune is just an
expanding list of severe problems with TLPS. A paid, exclusive Wi-Fi channel is not commercially viable in a
world with more than 20 free ones. Furthermore, many modern LTE-enabled mobile devices like cell phones
contain coexistence filters that will degrade any TLPS transmissions. And yes, TLPS is bad policy, which is no
coincidence. Rational policy-making requires that the benefits of the policy outweigh the costs. TLPS has no
meaningful benefits but does have costs: it will interfere with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BAS (assuming it's ever
actually deployed), and it sets a bad precedent for future spectrum policy. Just because we discuss a new
topic doesn't mean we've abandoned our previous arguments. To the contrary, we stand by them completely.

If a paid Wi-Fi channel is not viable, why then are both Google and Microsoft about to go that route combining
licensed and unlicensed spectrum? 
The panel was about private or public. Didn't you guys know that Google and Microsoft are about todo that? 
In my opinion you all got pimped by them.

Author’s reply »  TLPS isn't a "competing technology." It's a paid, exclusive 2.4GHz Wi-Fi channel. If such a
channel added a lot of value to a Wi-Fi network, then people and firms who operate Wi-Fi networks would be
eager to get their hands on it, and people and firms who benefit from internet access more broadly (like
Google) would welcome it. But this is not what one observes. You're also ignoring the fact that corporations

Institute and Public Knowledge? They have never been shy about opposing what they view as anti-
competitive business practices, yet here they are lining up against TLPS. Your narrative -- that TLPS
opponents are only motivated by a desire to keep down a competitor -- doesn't fit the facts.

Per the event website: 
"The FCC has sought comments on Globalstar’s proposed Terrestrial Low Power Service (TLPS) and hosted
demonstration testing. How would Globalstar’s service impact existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other users in this band?
What are the public interest benefits of the proposed TLPS service? Are there alternatives to allow more robust public
use of the 2.4 GHz band?


Join Microsoft and New America’s Open Technology Institute for a panel discussion among diverse stakeholders that
explores the pros and cons of the satellite company’s proposed use of the band and the potential impact on existing
unlicensed uses."


FYI, the FCC has hosted demonstration testing and concluded that TLPS does not produce significant interference.


I am anxious to hear the opinions of this group of "diverse stakeholders". I am sure the pros of GSAT's proposed use
of the band will be fully explored. I believe every presenter has already filed ExPartes or Comments with the FCC
recommending denial. So now they are getting together to commiserate over the TLPS' approval because the FCC is
done listening to them, thats why they are meeting amongst themselves instead of meeting with the decision makers
at the FCC.


P.S. I love how you have a link to your disclaimer instead of including it in the article. Much less likely to breed that
way.

Author’s reply »  Your claim that "the FCC has...concluded that TLPS does not produce significant
interference" is, of course, totally false. The FCC has expressed no opinion about GSAT's demonstration, and
many parties, including Google and the Wi-Fi Alliance, have raised serious questions about it.


If all the panelists wanted to do was commiserate and TLPS was a fait accompli, why would they bother to
host a public event?

believe that having a network of hot spots is incredibly valuable, yet no one attributes billions upon billions of
value to Microsoft, Boingo, or Comcast. All TLPS has to offer is an additional exclusive channel that a Wi-Fi
network might use (provided there were any client devices to use it), so its value consists entirely in
(allegedly) increasing the value of something like Microsoft Wi-Fi. The fact that Microsoft evidently has no
interest in getting the underlying hot-spot owners to use TLPS speaks volumes for TLPS's pointlessness and
irrelevance.

First off not everybody is against TLPS, a point blank misleading statement that Kerrisdale is saying on Seeking
Alpha. How about Amazon and Apple? I don't see them at the conference. As a matter of fact Amazon has been the
biggest tester of TLPS. Also, they claim that Microsoft and Google believe it sets bad policy to grant a whole band to
just one company. This coming from Microsoft and Google the kings of monopolies. He also failed to mention how
Microsoft is planning of using the same business model as Globalstar in the Wi-Fi usage. Also, he failed to mention
how Microsoft plans to charge on that usage. You know the same charging that Crammer said would never work on
Mad Money when he had the Globalstar CEO on. But I guess it is okay to not to mention those facts in this article.


16 Jun 2015, 11:12 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  It shouldn't be necessary to point out that a) we didn't say "everybody is against TLPS"
(although that's closer to true than its negation is) and b) just because Apple and Amazon aren't on the panel
doesn't mean they love TLPS. (We weren't on the panel either.) While Amazon was rumored to have tested
TLPS in some capacity back in 2013, the fact that there's been no indication that Amazon is interested since
then is not exactly a positive sign for GSAT.


Side note: are Microsoft and Google really "the kings of monopolies"? If you don't like Microsoft Excel, you
can use Google Sheets; if you don't like Google Search, you can use Bing...


It's not clear how if at all Microsoft will charge for Microsoft Wi-Fi, and Globalstar has never really articulated a
business model for TLPS. All it brings to the table with TLPS is a channel. It has no locations to install APs,
no expertise in Wi-Fi deployment, and precious little cash to fund any build-out. Meanwhile, cable companies
already have millions of APs, but no one thinks this adds billions of dollars of value to the cable companies,
and cable companies generally don't explicitly charge their customers for access. The business case for
TLPS stubbornly continues not to exist.

Let's see, you said the whole industry is against TLPS? Funny thing I have not seen anything from Amazon or Apple
or are you choosing not to mention the fact that Amazon has been testing TLPS for over a year now. Also, you say it
is not good policy for Globalstar to have sole use of that band but it is okay for Microsoft to continue to have
monopolies themselves. It is also okay that Microsoft has the same business plan as Globalstar on Wi-Fi usage that
they will charge. Remember, the same charge plan that Crammer mocked the CEO of Globalstar about. You are a
sorry excuse for a hedge fund. I really hope the SEC comes after you guys.

TLPS is potentially a gamechanger for the availability of wi-fi. The FCC should weigh this against the importance of
possible interference on Microsoft's X-box network. The question then becomes: is a greater availability of internet
through TLPS more important to us then the intereference on a gaming platform? Answer should be easy

Author’s reply »  TLPS is not a game changer for the availability of Wi-Fi or anything else. How could it be?
It's just a paid channel that a Wi-Fi network might conceivably use. Its impact on Wi-Fi capacity would be
trivial at best. The pain experienced by Xbox users suffering from adjacent-channel interference may not be
large in magnitude or moral importance, but it does in fact outweigh the nonexistent benefits of TLPS.

Being short, you should give a rats AZZ about interference as you seem to tout that the business plan of paid
wifi won't work. If it won't work from a business point of view, then you should be in support knowing it will fail,
right?


Why anyone is hanging their hat onto whether from a business practically TLPS will work, is not the FCC
concern nor should it be yours.But then again your short.


I'd be a cheerleader for approval if from a business point of view it is a complete failure and be short as you
are claiming.

whassup,


What you wrote makes little sense. The short thesis is pretty straightforward:


1) TLPS shouldn't be approved (for various reasons) 
2) Even if it is, commercial success is unlikely


 
In #1, the stock could go to basically zero in a day. In #2 it might take quarters or possibly years before it dies
a slow death.


Better for a short to be a zero now rather than a zero in 2 years, right?


Mathematically, $3 to zero, $10 to zero, or $0.10 to zero is the same return: a 100% loss.

Dissapointed that the opposition of EIBASS, on behalf of Part 74 TV BAS stations, a LICENSED service that trumps
Part 15 anything and is co-primary with MSS, not mentioned. Terrestrial MSS will be obligated to protect TV BAS,
which is co-channel, not adjacent channel.

Author’s reply »  Since EIBASS wasn't represented on the panel we didn't see the opportunity to mention it,
although we did just refer to BAS licensees in one of our replies above. How GSAT intends to protect co-

If what you say is true, why aren't Google and Microsoft ignoring TLPS now?

Kyle Soucy
If they can ignore TLPS after approval then why have they been filing ex parte's and putting on anti-TLPS round table
discussions? Seems to me that if they could simply ignore it then they would already be doing so.

Author addresses TLPS, but doesn’t mention ADB-S, ignoring the elephant in the room.


“The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee highlights certification reform and ADS-B implementation in its
recommended $16 billion Fiscal Year 2016 budget for the FAA. Similar to the House, the Senate would furnish far less
for the FAA’s facilities and equipment than the White House sought, but would match FY2015’s $2.6 billion.”


The extra $13 billion will put at least an extra $10 billion in GSAT’s pocket.

This is ON TOP of NASA’s exclusive contract with GSAT.


FAA and NASA contract amounts will be on top of Lockheed Martin’s contract amount with GSAT.


All the TLPS, MSS, RAN that GSAT spoke about in their earnings conference call is just cash flow while the really
massive profits are coming from worldwide ADS-B, and the USA is behind the rest of the world in implementing ADS-
B. Sure…. FAA has a 2020 deadline. Sure…. But the FAA is going to implement for commercial airlines beginning in
2016, assuming this Bill is passed into law.

Specific details of the NASA Award 
I searched the internet to try and learn the dollar value of the NASA Award to Globalstar. I could not find the dollar
value of the award, but the name and phone number of the Procurement Specialist at NASA is supplied. In case a
bold Analyst wishes to place the telephone call. I’d bet the reply would be something like, “Do you have a need to
know?” Followed by something about clearance levels…. In any event, below is the Request For Proposal and what is
relevant is that Globalstar is the sole qualified vendor and specifically delineated in the Specification. So, what follows
is an excerpt from the Specification, then the link, then another link to the US Patent (Held by ADS-B Technologies),
first the Diagram, then the Written Patent itself. Last link is to another relevant link for C-band airport studies, which I
could not find specifically referencing either Globalstar or ADS-B Technologies, and was pulling me off task, because I
wanted the dollar value to see what the contract was going to do for GSAT’s revenues. Which I never found. But, the
data certainly legitimizes the true extent of the relationship between the parties. Ongoing relationship. And thus, when
it becomes commercialized, both ADS-B Technologies and Globalstar will have a “moat” and no other vendor will ever
be written into the spec. Once again, this is for a new system to replace radar plus radio, which can be ineffective in
foul weather or beyond physical distance constraints, which makes ADS-B Technologies and Globalstar a safer
alternative. Probably, radar plus radio will serve as back-up systems, collecting dust in air traffic control rooms.


NASA/LARC has a requirement for an ADS-B Link Augmentation System (ALAS), a prototype system used to provide
two-way voice and data communications via the Globalstar Satellite Communications System and is built by ADS-B
Technologies. This procurement will include technical support for the installation, operation, maintenance, modification
and training for the ALAS system. 
NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from ADS-B Technologies, LLC. The ADS-B Technologies ALAS system is
a proprietary system developed by ADS-B Technologies in conjunction with Globalstar Inc., the owner and operator of
the Globalstar low earth orbit satellite communications system. The ALAS system uses the Globalstar system which
NASA Langley has already invested in with multiple ground based and aircraft systems. The ALAS system is the only
compatible system with and complementary to the existing Globalstar voice, data, and subscription services that
NASA Langley has previously purchased. ADS-B Technologies has a cooperative agreement with Globalstar for the
development of equipment and services using the Globalstar communications system. ADS-B Technologies
possesses the required technical knowledge, the proprietary hardware and proprietary software that no other vendor
has.

>>The extra $13 billion will put at least an extra $10 billion in GSAT’s pocket.<<


Please explain your analyis behind $10 billion.


28 Aug 2015, 09:53 AM


U3
$13B - $4.5B + $1.5B = $10B 
WSJ says $4.5B for control tower equipment, perhaps $1.5B spent in 2014, since WSJ article, leaves $10B. 
Just a 30 second analysis. For a better analysis, look at GSAT's current charges for satellite phone, roughly $1 a
minute.  
Boeing did a study of aircraft crashes and one statistic was 50.9M hours of commercial flight time annually worldwide. 
50.9 X 60 minutes per hour = 3.0B minutes per year. 
Add private aircraft and Department of Defense aircraft flights and you get maybe 5.0B minutes per year. 
OK, so maybe GSAT only gets $5B a year. Maybe just $1B or $2B a year. From ADS-B alone. Then add in all other
civilian, non-government revenues.  
http://tinyurl.com/ows...


I didn't see any better revenue analysis anywhere else. Have you? Whether it is $1B or $10B, this is a lot more than
this SA article seems to suggest. And it didn't mention ADS-B, at all. It only mentioned TLPS, and missed the
elephant in the room, didn't it? ADS-B is what will make GSAT have impressive EPS, starting in 2016. ADS-B has a
2020 deadline, which is the end of the FAA's 5 year grace period, leading me to conclude that 2016 is the beginning
of ADS-B implementation. Right?


For a lot more links, like to the Boeing 50.9 hours number, I already posted them and you can find them in this
Seeking Alpha article's Comments section.  
http://seekingalpha.co...


I only have a small position in GSAT and do a little research now and then. For fun.


Have any GSAT research to share?

The FY2016 FAA Budget included Amtrak and other items, so there is no $10B for GSAT. So, my GSAT
shares don't go to $100 per share, this year anyway, anymore than Kerrisdale Capital Management's GSAT
share go to $0.00 this year. Or any year, for either of us. I'll stick with my original forecast of at least $1B
annual revenues and $1.00 EPS, but bump up my original projected date by a few years. Original estimates
as disclosed in the SA article referenced above.


I learned that the 5 year grace period was extended to 2025, but the deadline is 2020, the grace period being
that if the ADS-B isn't fully functional in the aircraft, the aircraft would be denied airport take-off authority.


Furthermore, UPS has been one of the first to enthusiastically embrace, adopt and use ADS-B, using it now,
in fact. This ADS-B has been building momentum for many years. So, it should ramp up revenues for GSAT.
I'd think.


All these links for legislation are writing about pending legislation which has not been passed yet, but which
specifically identifies and funds ADS-B, "NextGen," the replacement for ground based radar plus radio air
traffic control. NextGen and ADS-B being GPS, satellite based, and with the NASA award specifying only
GSAT, then presumptively GSAT the only fully qualified and specified FAA Approved satellite vendor.


NASA did not disclose the contract amount. An investor must work to estimate the valuations, and potential
revenues and profits and choose whether to go long or short, with opinions on both sides of the investment in
GSAT. Obviously. They know my theory, I know their theory. Better to be aware. But admittedly, not $10B for
GSAT. Which is why we all do our own homework. Right?


28 Aug 2015, 04:51 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Yes, $16B is the entire budget for the FAA, up less than 2% vs. the prior year.

I'd also point out that ADS-B Technologies is a puny company in Alaska with an estimated 5-9 employees and
revenue less than $1 million:

GSAT has over $600 million in debt and burns cash. I'd say a zero is definitely a possibility.

Reading the Senate Bill in the light most favorable to a GSAT short position, the language “However, the bill does
provide $184.6 million for ADS-B implementation, recognizing it is the foundation of the NextGen air traffic
management program,” leads me to believe that the FAA 2016 Budget specifically provides a minimum of $184.6
million for GSAT NextGen ADS-B services. 
Let me run through the numbers. $185 million for FAA. $185 million for NASA. $33 million for VFR Private Pilots, Rule
23. Pan Africa plus firefighters and trucking SPOT contracts, $50 million. Total, $453 million 2016 cash flow. NEW
cash flow, on top of existing $90 million annual 2015 cash flow.


Even if ADS-B Technologies only had one retired employee, they still own the ADS-B Patent, so your comment is
irrelevant, sir. Furthermore, I saw absolutely no analysis on your part. You offered no research. So, this leads me to
believe that you are “just guessing,” whereas, I have provided specific facts with references to verifiable sources,
including government websites.


Senate Bill:


The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee highlights certification reform and ADS-B implementation in its
recommended $16 billion Fiscal Year 2016 budget for the FAA. The committee, which cleared the bill for full Senate
consideration on June 25, is recommending a FY2016 FAA budget that is $175 million more than requested from the
White House and nearly $300 million more than last year's. Similar to the House, the Senate would furnish far less for
the FAA’s facilities and equipment than the White House sought, but would match FY2015’s $2.6 billion. 
However, the bill does provide $184.6 million for ADS-B implementation, recognizing it is the foundation of the
NextGen air traffic management program. The Appropriations Committee also stressed that the FAA’s certification
system “must include a fuller utilization of organizational designation authorization, more effective safety oversight,
better workforce training and meaningful performance metrics.” The committee asked for a report on improvements in
the FAA’s certification effort and further urged the FAA to issue the Part 23 rewrite this summer, saying, “A failure to
act would cede international leadership to other regulatory authorities.” http://tinyurl.com/phb...


While the committee has not yet released full details of the bill, it has said that it will provide the FAA with $294 million
more than in fiscal 2015 and $175 million more than the White House request. The bill backs the contract tower
program and rejects increases in passenger facility charge. http://tinyurl.com/p7y...

NASA has worked with NASA for many years and gave GSAT the contract to develop satellite internet:


NASA awarded a contract to satellite-communications provider Globalstar to develop an Internet protocol that would
make a network easy to transport and would allow users to stay connected from multiple platforms on land, at sea or
in the air.  
“We’re really demonstrating how to maintain connectivity across mobile platforms,” said Pete Vrotsos, the project
manager at NASA Glenn.


“We’re trying to see if we can use mobile IP for more robust applications, especially in the aeronautical field, including
civil aviation and the FAA,” he said. “We’re trying, as much as we can, to use the investments that the commercial
industry has made in the infrastructure of the country,” Vrotsos said.


“The initial goals of the demonstrations were reached, but there’s still some work that needs to be done, because we
have to make this happen seamlessly. As a user, you don’t want to notice, nor are you concerned with, how the
network connection is getting through. You just want to maintain it,” said Vrotsos.


NASA is using Globalstar’s multiple channel modem (8 channels), which is roughly the equivalent to a 56K home-PC
modem. “They can transmit with Globalstar normally, but with mobile IP, you are always in the firewall, when you’re
getting into the Internet. You’re bringing the Internet along with you,” Jeffery said.


The mobile IP program is part of a broader effort to gain a larger share of the government’s satellite-communications
market. In the defense sector, Globastar is seeking to challenge Iridium Satellite LLC, which has a low-earth orbiting
constellation of 66 operational LEO satellites and 14 in-orbit spares.


Estimate of Private aircraft VFR revenues, in addition to NASA plus FAA ADS-B contracts.


2020 GSAT Revenues for Private aircraft VFR Visual Flight Rules. 225,000 private aircraft and 700,000 private pilots

billion people in Africa, and although low per capita, they have 1.65% market penetration for high speed internet),
CANADA’s GSAT spec’d RFP, US Forest Service GSAT spec’d RFP, and on and on. Although these tiny contract may
only add up to $50 million or so, that is another $0.57 EPS added.

On page 103 of this lengthy DOT FY 2015 Budget, it looks like GSAT may be entitled to receive $190 million from the
NASA contract award. This is tricky stuff and I will leave it to the reader to do his own interpretation of what GSAT is
going to receive under the NASA contract. Page 122 describes what is in Table 4, line 2A19, Data Communications in
Support of NextGen, which sounds like GSAT, but the break-out of the detail does not look like GSAT, because it
involves development, whereas page 103 refers to subscription services, which sounds a lot like GSAT’s satellite data
communications services. So, do your own homework here, folks. While scrolling in the PDF file page 122 is almost
exactly in the middle and refers to the DOT Budget page numbering.


In other words, you may have to hire a lawyer to give an expert opinion about what this DOT FY2015 Budget is saying
and it is really for you to interpret what GSAT may be receiving in revenues under this budget. Look at it like this. 50.9
million hours a year of commercial aircraft flights, each year, well that is a lot of satellite data transmission, and GSAT
got that contract, had and has been working with NASA and the FAA for a number of years to develop this NextGen
technology which will replace air traffic controllers having to use radar plus radio to direct commercial and civilian
aviators. A lot of data, a lot of satellite time, a lot of responsibility. And a lot of serious investors with long term money
invested in this and other GSAT business line offerings. So, it sounds about right.


$190 million or $147 million? Really hard to tell. Will it all hit in 2H2015 for GSAT? Hard to tell.


According to Table 4 in the DOT Budget for FY 2015, GSAT will be receiving $147 million for ADS-B. Or at least, that
is how I read and interpret this information. Of course, I can be wrong. But, it is presented for your review and
analysis.


The $147,340,000 GSAT contract awarded by NASA was covered in the FY2015 DOT Budget, with the link provided
below. For your ease of use, the PDF file is long, but the very last page is where you will find Table 4.


There are 12 of the last 12 pages of the PDF file that address NextGen. Separate money is budgeted for equipment,
installation, training, voice, weather, etc. All details are in the Table. More information in narrative form is provided in
the 11 pages preceeding Table 4.


The line to look at is:


2A19 Data Communications in Support of NextGen $147,340,000
