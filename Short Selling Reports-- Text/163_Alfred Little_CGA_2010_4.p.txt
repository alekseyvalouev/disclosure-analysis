China Green Agriculture: Why This Chinese Class Action Lawsuit Is
Different Than the Rest
Oct. 18, 2010 3:34 PM ET32 comments
by: Alfred Little


On Friday a highly regarded law firm, Saxena White P.A., announced it has commenced a
class action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders of China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA), by
filing a detailed 46 page complaint (available for downloading here) with the US District
Court of Nevada. What makes this lawsuit stand out from previous cases is that it is
supported by much stronger evidence (see the table below) resulting in some very serious
allegations made by an experienced team of lawyers (Saxena White’s partners came from
Milberg Weiss, the nation’s first and formerly largest class action outfit that won over $45
billion for defrauded shareholders over its 30 year history; including $7.2 billion from
Enron). Since leaving Milberg, Saxena White attorneys have won large settlements over
the past several years, most notably $53.3 million from Sirva, Inc. and $34.4 million from
Cablevision Systems.


I will now summarize the major findings laid out in great detail in Saxena White’s complaint
along with CGA management’s explanations:


1. Value Added Tax (VAT) Paid. According to its press release dated September 13,
2010 (available here), CGA management stated that during the two-year period ending
June 2010, it made VAT payments totaling approximately $9.4 million to the Chinese
State Administration of Taxation (SAT). However, SAT records Saxena White cites in
its lawsuit clearly show miniscule VAT payments made over this period totaling less
than $100,000 (a copy of the records and the due diligence report prepared by IFRA is
available for download here). CGA management’s explanation to date simply
describes these records as “incomplete.” Despite the falling stock price, analyst
downgrades and resignation of their IR firm CGA management has not produced any
evidence to counter this claim. Intelligent investors must assume at this point that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/230668-china-green-agriculture-why-this-chinese-class-action-lawsuit-is-different-than-the-rest 2/14


these were phantom payments and over $9 million in company funds are plainly
missing.


2. Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Paid. In this same press release, CGA management
stated it paid “RMB 14,466,731.61 (approximately $2.1 million) in March 2009 for the
CIT incurred for calendar 2008” and “RMB21,040,562.21 (approximately $3.1 million)
in March 2010 for the CIT incurred for calendar 2009.” First of all, this statement that
corporate tax was paid in March of the year following its accrual is inconsistent with
Chinese tax regulation requiring quarterly pre-payment of CIT. More importantly,
IFRA’s due diligence report included the official SAT record, which showed no income
taxes paid by CGA. Management once again has produced no evidence to the
contrary. Therefore investors can only conclude that another $5.2 million is
unaccounted for.


3. Greenhouse Land Purchase. On September 25, 2009, at the depths of the global
financial crisis, CGA management stated the company paid approximately $10.8
million to purchase 88 acres of rural farmland in Shaanxi Province (an economically
less developed Province in Western China). Detailed records obtain by IFRA (available
here) from multiple government sources (including the deed tax paid on the
transaction) all clearly show that the actual price paid was only $2.7 million.
Management responded to the evidence by claiming that the $8.1 million difference
was paid to an undisclosed state-owned company they identify as the “seller” of the
land, despite no public record of this payment and existence of the aforementioned
“seller”. Once again, management failed to offer any proof of this payment and
investors must add another $8.1 to the growing pile of unaccounted money.


4. Gufeng Acquisition. On July 2, 2010, CGA management closed the acquisition of
Beijing Gufeng Chemical Products Co., Ltd., ("Gufeng"), for a total consideration, cash
plus stock, of $31.8 million plus a commitment to fund another $14.7 million toward
Gufeng’s working capital needs. Gufeng’s selling shareholder, in return, promised the
company would make at least $10.6 million net income in the 12 months following the
sale or else give back some of the CGA shares paid. This acquisition makes no
financial sense for CGA shareholders. Gufeng was historically unprofitable, poorly
managed, with production lines that CGA plans to replace and upgrade at significant
cost to produce an entirely different type of organic fertilizer that CGA must then find a
market for. IFRA calculated the replacement cost of Gufeng’s plant at less than half the
price CGA paid. The $10.6 million net income “guarantee” is completely unobtainable.
CGA significantly overpaid untold millions for Gufeng. Investors should consider at
least $10 million in wasted money. Combined with the missing tax and land payments
mentioned above there is over $32 million unaccounted for.

By comparison, the following table shows that other Chinese securities class action suits
filed in the last three months are based on much less evidence:

So what happens next? CGA management has been dodging the issues for over two
months now, leaving me little reason to believe they can ever explain these discrepancies.
Even CGA’s former highly paid and well-regarded IR firm quit out of frustration over
management’s inability to address the issues. Will a court date force CGA management to
defend themselves or will they just “go dark” and stop reporting to their investors as in the
case of China Expert Tech (OTC:CXTI)? In that case investors will lose everything and the
lawyers get nothing. Alternatively and more likely, CGA management will fight the charges
but still lose, resulting in a mess of earnings restatements and eventual financial
settlement with the plaintiffs. To prevent further loss, shareholders should band together to
insist that CGA’s Board appoint a controller to make sure the company’s cash and other
assets are secure.


Thankfully the analyst community got CGA right. They have more or less been
consistently cautious in their research reports thus protecting their clients in a way they
rarely do. This time those suffering loss are mainly the “quant” funds and others who
never performed any real due diligence or read my prior articles on Seeking Alpha.

I'm an idiot when it comes to investing but trying to learn. Still don't know how to evaluate a stock correctly but
I read things on the net by people who sound like they know and then maybe buy some stocks with the little
money I have saved.vie gotten kinda lucky except when it comes to CGA. Baught some at 7 dollars when I
first started getting into the stock market and it shot up to around 18 a share so I fell in love with the stock
buying more when it pulled back. Now I have all my savings in it and I want to get out but will have to sell at a
big loss. I would prefer to hold on till it goes up some day but your scaring me.two questions. 
1. Seems like as soon as the class action lawsuit was announced the stock went up. why. 
2.how will I be affected if CGA looses. Will I get something?Wouldn't it cause the stock to go down more
making my losses even greater if I hold onto my shares?

I have a question? How many of these Chinese stocks are you short? All of them because you seem to
publish follow up articles a day after the scam artists at Muddy Waters shorts the stock and posts fraudulent
articles claiming fraud. Then the kicker, you say a reputable firm? Never heard of them but they look like
ambulance chasers to me so i wouldn't call them reputable. I mean cmon. Those are just the bottom of the
bottom feeders. I think i would like a real investigator and author to investigate your ties with Muddy Waters
and these short attacks on institutions that have not been found to have conducted business in an
unprofessional manor such as yourself. Its only a matter of time. People like yourself don't know when to stop
until your behind bars.

Good morning from Europe Alfred;


I have a question, however not related to your article. 
Do you have, or somebody else, a idea of what is going on with CHIO - China INSOnline? 
I was checking all over and drew a blank.

On September 24, Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action lawsuit has been
commenced in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of purchasers of the
securities of China Green.


Who is Brower?


Brower was a former partner of Milberg LLP from 2005 to 2006. In June 2006, he left Milberg and hooked up with
class-action attorney Charles Piven to form Brower Piven. Brower works in New York and Piven in Baltimore.


Who is Milberg LLP?


In May 2006 and September 2007 the plaintiffs' class action firm -- in an incarnation known as Milberg Weiss Bershad
& Schulman, LLP -- and several of its partners were indicted on federal charges for an alleged decades-long
conspiracy pursuant to which serial plaintiffs were paid kickbacks to file securities fraud suits against publicly-traded
companies. Some heavy-weight former partners, including Mel Weiss and Bill Lerach, pleaded guilty and were
imprisoned for their roles in the scheme, and the firm -- once dubbed the "meanest law firm" in America -- avoided
prosecution by paying a $75 million fine and hiring a compliance monitor.


Another former Milberg partner, Paul D. Young, who worked on the firm's lawsuit against Tyco which settled for over
$3 billion, was sued by New York City in November 2006 for alleged criminal nuisance involving the operation of El
Mirage, a gay S&M sex club, out of the basement of a property he owned as reported by Roger Parloff for Fortune
Magazine.

CO Attorney Gary Lozow Gets Public Censure For Role In Milberg Weiss Kickback Scheme


In Denver, CO "veteran criminal defense attorney Gary Lozow of Isaacson Rosenbaum has stipulated to a public
censure issued by the disciplinary office of the Colorado Supreme Court for acting as an intermediary in law firm
Milberg Weiss' plaintiff kickback scheme" as reported by Matt Masich for Law Week Colorado.

Speaking on the intregity of the remaining partners at the firm -- now practicing by the moniker Milberg LLP -- partner
Ariana Tadler previously stated: "The lawyers that stayed were not implicated or involved in the indictment, and we
are going to work just as aggressively as we always have to do the best for our clients." And yet notwithstanding their
innocence the question still begged is whether some of those remaining partners had suspicions about the scheme
prior to the indictment and what, if any, steps they took to address the problem. Indeed, Bill Lerach recently said that
his conduct was an "industry practice." After all, what did everyone think was happening when the same individuals
repeatedly were serving as plaintiffs in dozens of lawsuits? In 1995, Congress enacted the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act specifically for the purpose of curbing the abuses for which Milberg Weiss and several of its
partners were indicted, and surely this legislation raised a red flag even among the innocents at the firm.

Milberg LLP has made the news a couple of times in recent weeks. U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr.
sanctioned the firm and its co-counsel pursuant to Rule 11 with a public reprimand after allegations from two
"confidential sources" in a lawsuit against Sony Corporation subsequently were not supported by the witnesses'
deposition testimony, and U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman rebuked the firm in a ruling on its request for
additional attorneys' fees in the securities fraud case In re Nortel Networks Corp. Securities Litigation because of,
among other issues, improper staffing.

sorry you did not like the report. it is important for those who own imergent to understand that it is not a software
company but rather it is a marketing company that appeals to those who are in desperate need of money. this goes to
the credibility of the whole business. In the instance, it is important for people to see how imergent really gets their
customer and how they are not the innocent company the present themselves to be to wall st.

The conclusion is quite obvious:


A group of barred lawyers and corrupted bankers, together with short sellers, ambushed a basket of Chinese small
cap stocks by creating false rumors, fears, and panics.


These so-called lawsuits will serve as a deterrant for the serious investors to step in buying the stocks.


Any retail or institution investors who were scared to sell are simply fools/

These lawyers are the scum of the earth....glorified fire engine chasers doing so in the "interest of shareholders" but in
the end..... 99% of the benefits go to the attorneys. The Board of Directors insurance is the "pot of gold" and all they
have to do is "choke" the company until management says "uncle". After a job well done, it's off to another company
... found through searching stock charts and corporate news. What a business ! Scamsville !!!! in the end most
shareholders recover barely enough to cover the cost of a postage stamp when there is a recovery while the
attorneys make millions of $$$. It's simply legal "blackmail".


Since the trial attorneys have "bought" Obama through their benevolent political contributions, it is too much to ask for
Congress to control these wolves in sheep's clothing. That will never happen !


As I look at Mr. LIttle's picture, I can't help thinking I've seen that photo at one time or another at the post office. The
way he gloats about his crooked friends with admiration, I can't help but think that this is a person I would not trust
with a $1 of mine ! Beware of people "trying to protect" you !

Lawyers are out of bloody control. It is all about money, nothing else. The PPS goes down there must be a conspiracy
so let's sue. Let's do what the Brits do and the losing side pays. In the US there is no such thing as frivolous law suit.
Their day in court is their day at the money trough. Of course any meaningful legal reform is stopped because many

I'm a lawyer and have done securities work. Let me give you a bit of insight into what's going on here:


-A made-up "consulting" firm named IRFA is created from air in 2009 and releases exactly one report, on CGA. It
makes a variety of allegations which are difficult to either confirm or deny given the byzantine nature of Chinese tax
law. A guy named Alfred Little, with no apparent expertise in Chinese tax law, writes a few articles purporting to
analyze and support these attacks. 
-CGA's stock price drops.  
-A law firm comes along and sees easy pickings: they can simply summarize the IRFA report, adding no new
"evidence" or dilligence, and file a complaint. They have no plaintiffs and very little chance of ever seeing the inside of
a courtroom, but they take a shot, as they often do, because if you take enough shots in the dark, one of them will hit
something.  
-Alfred Little cites the lawsuit as a basis for selling the stock. Alfred Little is not a lawyer and appears blissfully
ignorant as to the "pedigree" of Milberg Weiss, a firm the federal government nearly obliterated for--wait for it--paying
plaintiffs to join made-up lawsuits.


Listen, law firms like this file hundreds of suits a year. Most of them never even find a plaintiff, much less get a hearing
in court. Those that do find their way to court take years to resolve and are generally unsuccessful. That's the reality
of securities law, something Mr. Little knows less than zero about.

Not invested in CGA myself... but that in and of itself is pretty damning evidence if true. Sounds like the SEC
should begin investigating Lawyers in addition to Financiers. This is a sad day for America.

Don't believe CGA is actually a fraud. Check out the photos from a recent investor visit below.

Seeking Alpha cohort: 
The personal attacks and barbs against Mr Little should stop, what benefit are they to the investing public? I may
disagree with what Mr Little says but there is no reason to attack him personally.


Discredit his ideas by presenting evidence or reasoned arguments to disprove his allegations but kindly refrain from
insinuation and personal affronts.


Let´s work together to keep this site worthy of our time.

I have no position in CGA either way. It is interesting to note that all the comments slamming the author and the
attorneys are long on ad hominems yet NONE of them address the substance of the issues raised in the article. Nor
has the management of the company issued a rebuttal. Anyone have any actual FACTS contrary to the author's
claims?

FACTS: 
1. CGA has never been investigated by actual authorities for wrongdoing 
2. CGA executives have never been investigated by actual authorities for wrongdoing 
3. CGA management stated on the conf call that there are no problems with their finances and all is on the up
and up 
4. CGA hired a better/new IR firm and CGA terminated the old one (not the other way around) 
5. CGA has only been targeted by: (a) scummy A. Little, (b) scummy plaintiff attorneys, and (c) short sellers 
6. The fact is, if this fraud was so "obvious" as Little makes it out to be, then the DOJ, SEC, NYSE and
Chinese authorities would be investigating it...BUT THEY ARE NOT

New users are coming out of the woodworks to attack an author who states he has "no position". And, their only
defense is to attack the author not to refute the evidence. All these chinascams are guilty of fudging numbers to a
certain extent I believe and I wouldn't touch but a couple out of the whole lot, long or short.

Chinascam days are going to come to an end hopefully. I would suspect(or hope actually) the U.S. Government to
come down with some sort of regulation on these seemingly unregulated companies from China in the near future.

I have an example here: One trash borrowed the money from other people many times and he never return. Today he
begs to borrow some money from you and request you to trust him. Do you trust him? Certainly not due to his bad
credit. Another trash said, " yes, he may have a bad credit but can you prove his dishonest this time. If not, you have
to trust him because of no proof.


Same thing: the trash lied many times and had no credit. Today he say something and aks you to trust him. Trust
him? Cetainly not for me!!

Mr Little has some very serious accusations.  
Is mr Alfred Little trustworthy? Or he lies?

Well, Little's article was sooo believable until I read replies. I am now sure that he is a fraud and should be
investigated. One reason I believe that: HE HAS YET TO RESPOND!!! 
On the other hand, I would guess that maybe a few explainations might be in order for the company he talks about.

Α thought: What is the "background" of 
Mr. Little?  
He says he worked at SAB Consultants in the period 1994 - 2004.  
I did some google in SAB Consultants, I found nothing.  
So mr Little probably lies because if SAB Consultants existed, where are its internet traces? Why I can not find
anything on Google? 
Furthermore, why mr Little who is so well informed, has so little comments in Seeking Alpha? 
He maintains various and serious topics and accusations for CGA, which noone can control by distance, for their
truth. Let's say me: Can I control if mr Little's claims are real? No. 
But whatever he mention is bad for CGA's reputation. CGA as I knew, besides mr Littl'e accusations, was a very
strong company in its sector and has an outstanding outlook.  
So all these makes me believe that mr Little's attempt, is an attempt 
of degrading speculation. Yes, the Company has not respond enough "strong" yet. But what can do? I imagine that if
all these are just lies, it will prove soon. 
I will not sell my CGA stocks, because I think are valuable!

So mr Little, if you really exist, give us some more data for the company you worked (SAB Consultants). How can I
google it and find it???  
If you are trustworthy, you have to answer this. Or else, you are a common speculative calumnious.

I think the Chinese need to use independent auditors to browse their books and then report, well I guess no difference
should be for any small cap co. but oh well trust on the chinese is hard to come by.
