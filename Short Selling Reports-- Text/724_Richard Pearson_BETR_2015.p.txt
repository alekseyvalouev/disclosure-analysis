Amplify Brands: A Busted IPO And A No-Brainer Short
Sep. 24, 2015 9:40 AM ET24 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


IPOâ€™d at $18 with 100% of shares coming from insiders cashing out (company
received no proceeds).


Stock fell immediately and has now fallen by 33%.


Company is saddled with debt and has no cash to conduct acquisitions.


IPO was rushed out due to rapidly falling growth rates and margins.


At least 30-40% further downside.


Company overview


Amplify Brands (NYSE:BETR) is the maker of Skinny Pop popcorn. Skinny Pop is not
intended to be a weight loss item. The term "skinny" simply refers to the fact that it is
simpler, using fewer ingredients. (This article provides a side-by-side comparison of
Skinny Pop vs. key popcorn competitors).


Until April 2015, Skinny Pop was the company's only product. In April, the company
acquired Paqui Tortillas and at that time changed its name to Amplify Brands. However,
given that the acquisition price was a mere $12 million, it is still the case that Amplify
"Brands" is still largely just a one-product company - popcorn.


Amplify came public at a price of $18 in August valuing the popcorn company at over $1.5
billion in enterprise value. But the stock immediately traded down and now trades for
around $12.00, down 33% from the IPO price.


Key statistics are as follows:


Market cap: $900 million


Cash: $17 million


Total debt: $198 million


LTM Rev: $151 million

Background


The IPO of Amplify Brands is proof positive that on Wall Street, anything is possible.


The typical justification for an IPO is that a growth company needs capital to expand. The
IPO brings in that capital, often at a discount to fair value. The share price pops. The
company uses the fresh capital to expand. The share price continues to rise based on
stronger prospects. Voila. Everyone is happy. Capitalism works.


But with the IPO of Amplify Brands, we can see that sometimes a sneaker can slip
through the cracks and the IPO market can just act as a dumping ground for private equity
firms who need to unload one of their portfolio companies as quickly as possible.


TA Associates purchased a 74% stake in Skinny Pop in August of 2014 for just $320
million. Within 8 months (April 2015), the company had already hired Goldman Sachs to
sell the stake to a bidder. However, when no bidder materialized, TA needed an
alternative.


Skinny Pop has taken on nearly $200 million in debt and ended up paying dividends to
shareholders (i.e. including TA Associates) of $80 million. In April, just as TA was
attempting to sell the company, Skinny Pop then acquired a tiny tortilla chip maker for $12
million and changed its name to "Amplify Brands." Now, as a seemingly diversified snack
maker, the company filed for an IPO with Goldman as the underwriter.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3530596-amplify-brands-busted-ipo-brainer-short 3/13


The most unusual feature of this offering was that in the IPO, fully 100% of the shares
being offered to the public came from selling shareholders. This means that none of the
proceeds raised are going to the company. In fact, 82% of the shares came straight from
TA.


Clearly, this should be a tough sell. After all, if the insiders are all looking to cash out and
the company doesn't derive any benefit from the IPO, then why should anyone buy it?


There are a few key elements required in order to make such a transaction happen.
Especially when dealing with lofty multiples such as Amplify.


First requirement: the appearance of growth prospects


First off, there needs to be the appearance that there are still substantial growth prospects
ahead for the company. It is plain to see that Skinny Pop has already experienced a surge
in growth. In past years, the company was experiencing triple-digit growth as it expanded
from a presence of just a few thousand stores to its current level of nearly 50,000 stores.
But by now, Skinny Pop has already penetrated the largest grocers and convenience
stores in the country. This includes Sams Club, Costco (NASDAQ:COST), 7 Eleven, Wal-
Mart (NYSE:WMT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Target (NYSE:TGT).


It is therefore not surprising that growth has declined dramatically, as shown below:


Meanwhile, operating margins have also been cut in half.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3530596-amplify-brands-busted-ipo-brainer-short 4/13


These slowing growth rates and falling margins would normally create a major problem for
the IPO.


At an IPO price of $18, Skinny Pop would be coming public with an enterprise value of
over $1.5 billion. That is more than 50% larger than the size of the entire addressable
market for ready-to-eat popcorn in the US (according to Amplify's own IPO prospectus). It
is also a valuation of more than 10x 2014 revenues! So there needed to be something
else to the story.


As a result, in April 2015 (just when TA was trying to find a buyer for Skinny Pop), the
company acquired Paqui Tortillas. The acquisition price was just $12 million, but it served
a much greater purpose.


Skinny Pop could now be marketed to investors as a diversified snack company and the
size of the popcorn market would not be a limiting factor. As a result of this tiny
acquisition, Skinny Pop changed its name to "Amplify Brands" just shortly before the IPO.


Second requirement: selecting the right underwriter


IPOs are supposedly priced for to provide initial buyers with a pop in share price. That is
the way IPOs are supposed to work. But with Amplify, we can see that the stock traded
straight down from the very beginning and has continued to trade off by more than 30%.


Investors were clearly not buying the "diversified snack company" line. Nor were they
buying the hyper growth story.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3530596-amplify-brands-busted-ipo-brainer-short 5/13


The question then becomes "if this IPO was so bad, how did it get completed in the first
place."


The fact is that Goldman Sachs brings many very attractive IPO deals to market. If you
play 10 of these deals, you will probably end up making decent money in seven of them.
And in perhaps three of them you will hit some serious home runs. It is worth losing some
money on the occasional bad deal in order to maintain a relationship for future home runs.


As a result, when Goldman launches a "favor deal" like this one, there are no shortage of
investors who will buy a small slug as a favor to Goldman. They then hold for a brief
period and start quietly unloading while they can. This is exactly why the deal never traded
up and exactly why the stock is now down by 30%.


Competition


The bull case on Amplify rests on the assumption that Skinny Pop will be so popular that it
will literally take over the salty snack market and will be the number one Ready-to-Eat
popcorn maker.


But we can already see that there are dozens of competitors out there with a product that
is nearly identical. These products are sold in the same retail outlets and at similar prices
as Skinny Pop.


A list of these competitors can be found on the GoodGuide and it runs 15 pages long with
197 products!

Evaluating Amplify at a price of $12

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3530596-amplify-brands-busted-ipo-brainer-short 7/13


TA Associates paid $320 million for their 74% stake, valuing the company at $430 million.
That equates to a price of around $5.73 per share for TA.


But it is clear that even at $5.73, TA overpaid substantially. We can see from the above
charts that TA acquired Skinny Pop when growth was still clocking in at 160%. Operating
margins had just declined from 47% to 20% for the first time.


Now we can see that sales growth has plunged to just 33% from 160%, while operating
margins have failed to recover.


At a price of $12.00, Amplify has an enterprise value of around $1.1 billion. That equates
to a whopping 7.3x LTM sales. Amplify is clearly being priced for hyper growth.


To put this in perspective, when TA acquired its stake in the company one year ago, it did
so at a multiple of just 4.5x sales. Since that time, the company has taken on additional
debt while growth has slowed and margins have fallen.


Despite the lofty multiple for Amplify, growth is now expected to fall even further.


On August 31st, the managers and co-managers on the IPO all initiated coverage on the
stock. Not surprisingly, 4 out of 5 of them initiated with a price target of exactly $18 (the
same as the IPO price).


But it is interesting to note that co-bookrunner Credit Suisse initiated with a target price of
just $13.00. The key reason for the low price target is that Credit Suisse feels that the only
way to justify a higher valuation is to attribute value to acquisitions that have not yet
happened. Credit Suisse also assumes that the rate of growth on sales will be
slowing to just 20% by 2018.


Cash, debt and future acquisitions


Because Amplify did not receive any proceeds in the IPO, we are now looking at a $900
million market cap company, which has just $13 million in cash against nearly $200 million
in debt.


Again for perspective, Amplify has $10 million in debt coming due within 12 months and
an additional $14 million in consideration due to founders within 12 months, totaling $24
million against its $13 million in cash.


Credit Suisse has estimated that EBITDA for 2015 will come in at $72.2 million. That puts
Amplify at an EV/EBITDA of more than 15x. This means that Amplify is going to face
limitations on how much it can further borrow.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3530596-amplify-brands-busted-ipo-brainer-short 8/13


What all of this means is that Amplify is saddled with debt and has limited cash with which
to conduct acquisitions to achieve required growth.


Conclusion


TA Associates still owns 58% of Amplify. And we have already seen that TA has been in a
rush to sell its stake as quickly as possible. It was only 8 months after the stake was
acquired that TA began shopping it via Goldman Sachs.


TA paid just $5.73 per share for its stake in Amplify. But that is now largely irrelevant. With
the proceeds from the IPO along with its share of $80 million in special dividends, TA has
already received back 100% of its original investment in Amplify. Anything sold from here
on out is pure profit for TA.


As a result, TA's 58% stake in Amplify creates a massive overhang on the stock.


More importantly, we can see from the post IPO trading that the initial IPO buyers have
been slowly bleeding out stock. This was clearly a favor deal for Goldman Sachs, such
that buyers are simply looking to get out of their positions and (hopefully!) lose as little
money as possible.


This steady stream of sellers also creates significant downward pressure on the stock.


When TA acquired its stake at $5.73, Skinny Pop was still posting growth at around 160%
y-o-y. That is largely what justified the premium multiple for the company at the time. But
now growth has plunged to just 30%. This is why TA was in such a rush to sell the
company after just 8 months. (A normal PE holding period would be around 3-7 years.)


As a result, it is tough to say where Amplify will ultimately settle down. But with the
abundance of sellers and little chance of meeting growth estimates, we should see at least
30-40% downside from current prices.

The Opportunist, Contributor
First of all you should have a natural skepticism when you see a stock move from 18 to 12 and an admitted
short coming out w his thesis of why it will go lower. If he truly believed in that he would have come out near
the iPo when the stock was materially higher. None of the points made are realities in any way. That growth
slows off a larger base is something not known? Really? Growth is still high and the competition he speaks of
was there and will continue to be because the space is growing rapidly. They are just getting ready to roll out
paqui and the st is extremely conservative in the uptake assumptions despite the distribution potential of Betr
w a good product. He also suggests there is a cash problem. This is a huge free cashflow generator and can
pay down the debt, should they choose, or roll it into other products or both. The penetration in the U.S.

Market is just over half w zero international presence and there is plenty of room for growth. The suggestion
that ta was cashing out is also a distortion. They have left a huge slug on rather than cash out because it is a
representation of their confidence in the growth ahead. He also goes on to suggest they will have trouble
meeting growth targets! Really, that's interesting because by my math I'm thinking they will blow them away
as the st is conservative in the expansion assumptions, international partner, and paqui uptake in the future.
Not to mention adjacent product expansion like new flavors and such. I would take the other side of nearly
every one of his conclusions. After a 1/3rd drop in the stock, to congratulate him on offering a thought process
purposefully skewed to his interests is off in my opinion. Time will tell. I guarantee you this author will not stay
short this stock for a true belief that it will return to private equity valuations. The iPo and stock market blew
up as these guys came public. Pure and simple. This co is not guilty of mis executing. They came public at a
bad time. Look at what happened with Annie's. Originally one product then used the brand and financial
strength to expand. Similar takeout valuation would make this stock worth 28-30 right now.

Renmycat!
thanks for your thoughts. i would say that richard is putting his butt on the line by coming out at this time after
it has fallen so much.  
as we dont know when richard shorted this (not sure what the stock price was at time of lock-up) we dont
know how far it must fall. agree that it was a fantastic opportunity at $18 share, but now may not be so good..
but richard thinks it will fall another 30-40%, time will tell. his track record is decent. im gonna stay away from
this one!

1. Did the COMPANY benefit from the IPO? Did the IPO provide it with funds to invest in the business? If not,
why IPO (besides the obvious goal of shifting risk to the buying public)?


2. TA's slug is house money.


3. My main objection to Richard's thesis is the $12M taco brand could take off and be worth much more. Is it
already present in all the markets in which the popcorn is present? If not, they may be able to roll it out over
12-18 months and show a nice return for the investment, maybe even enough to make another acquisition.


But #3 is a complete unknown and makes this speculative at best, and overpriced, so I'm still congratulating
Richard for identifying the mismatched risk/reward.

As a consumer not an investor of foods.


I wouldn't waste my money on this shit when there are cheaper alternatives.


12 Nov 2015, 03:56 PM

Just from a consumer point of view.


Would you pay $4 for popcorn? 
I would not as a consumer when I can get microwavable popcorn for $2 and it won't get stale.


I'm not losing weight eating this and if I'm eating junk food well probably wouldn't buying popcorn when there
are more tastier things to eat.


I would say this stock sits in mediocrity unless you're a wall street millionaire who can afford to eat luxury
popcorn.


Good for you though if you can because the average consumer cannot.


also looks like right now they are entering price wars with other snack foods. Also bad move low entry barriers
to switch to alternatives.

It's fair, he's entitled to it. I had pointed out some things that were deleted. I'm for free speech of anything,
including my responses (which I admit are my biases). It seems as if there are real limits to that here but your
point is well taken. I'm on the other side of this trade and annoyed at the games being played by a short. He's
entitled to his opinion. I say don't limit anything and let the chips fall where they may.

Another good writeup, Pearson. Thank you.


This company is in one of the new office developments downtown. Why they need to be in one of the most expensive
office leases in the city, I'm not sure. Poor use of capital.


The Paqui tortillas are...tortillas. No different than any other store bought option, at least in Texas. And I'm really not
sure how widely you can distribute "fresh" tortillas. Seems like a regional thing. Doesn't appear they're even
advertising them on the website. The new Paqui chips, however, are catching on. People bring them into the office at
least once a week. They're not great, but they're different and have good branding. People buy them because the
flavors are unique. I'm not shorting because even though it might be a crap company, this segment might post insane
growth, guidance, etc that will send it higher, albeit temporarily.

Already the authors' contention that betr will miss has proven to be wrong. Further, given the move to international
mkts, better store placement w more skus, and early positive feedback from paqui pre sales for q1 rollout (along w
very low expectations by the st) makes for no brainer beats as far as the eye can see.

Any thoughts on how to think about the BDBD deal in context of BETR?


24 Nov 2015, 06:45 PM


Thomasy
I screened for similar food stocks on Finviz and found that BETR is the most expensive of all the 19 in its group in
terms of p/s at 6 and p/b at 60! You might think its earnings and growth are so good that it deserves this premium but
IBD gives it a 74 eps rating wheras WWAV gets a 94 but only trades at around 2x sales and 6x book value. Am I
missing something? Whats so great about a certain type of ready to eat popcorn and an also ran corn chip so they
can pretend they are diversified? who is buying this junk

Thanks for the article. Can you please comment on the recent insider buying? Looks strange at those valuations,
especially if your "favor deal IPO" thesis is correct.

thanks Michael that's a great question and I wish I had an answer for you. Are they just trying to drive prices
