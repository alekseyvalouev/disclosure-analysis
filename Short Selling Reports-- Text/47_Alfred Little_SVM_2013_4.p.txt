Silvercorp Management Misled Investors With A False Cash Flow
Forecast And Delayed Negative News

After A*L exposed SVM’s false operating cash flow forecast, SVM management
subsequently removed the 5 presentations cited and linked in A*L’s report from its investor
websites. Fortunately, A*L archived copies of these 5 false and misleading presentations
and uploaded them for investors and regulators to view at the following links:

I am blowing the whistle today on Silvercorp Metals Inc. (NYSE: SVM) for misleading
investors by publishing and repeatedly promoting a patently false fiscal 2013 operating
cash flow forecast of $160 million, an increase of 42% over 2012. SVM management
published and touted this forecast despite only generating $43 million in operating cash
flow in the first half of fiscal 2013, a decrease of 38% from 2012. Furthermore, I will show
that SVM management selectively disclosed lower operating cash flow guidance in
presentations to one group of investors, while continuing to show the higher cash flow
forecast to all other investors. Then in early 2013 SVM management staged a series of
positive announcements to boost the stock price while delaying disclosure of negative
developments including a write-down, project delay and sharply reduced production
guidance.

1) SVM management misled investors by publishing and promoting a false $160
million fiscal 2013 operating cash flow forecast


SVM management first presented its $160 million 2013 operating cash flow forecast over
halfway through the 2013 fiscal year as part of a corporate presentation entitled
"European Roadshow October 2012" (linked above).


As you will see below, a simple analysis of SVM's production guidance, metals prices, and
fiscal 2013 first half performance proves beyond any doubt that SVM management had to
have known that its cash flow forecast was false and impossible to achieve.


Below is a copy of page 16 of the presentation in which SVM's management forecast
operating cash flow would increase 42% from $113 million in fiscal 2012 to $160 million in
fiscal 2013:


(Note: SVM added the red box highlighting in the original presentation)


However, such a huge growth in operating cash flow is all but impossible when you
consider SVM's fiscal 2013 declining production forecast, copied below from page 15 of
the same presentation:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1228901-silvercorp-management-misled-investors-with-a-false-cash-flow-forecast-and-delayed-negative-news 3/40


According to the chart, SVM forecast silver equivalent production would decline from 6.1
million ounces in fiscal 2012 to 5.9 million ounces in fiscal 2013. Growing operating cash
flow by 42% while production is declining is all but impossible, without an enormous
increase in silver prices.


However, SVM management's forecast assumed lower silver prices, as I highlighted at the
top of its forecast below:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/2/647781_13619244830535_1.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1228901-silvercorp-management-misled-investors-with-a-false-cash-flow-forecast-and-delayed-negative-news 4/40


The $30 per ounce silver price assumption SVM management used in its operating cash
flow forecast is much lower than the $35.88 per ounce average silver price SVM enjoyed
in fiscal 2012, as found on page 3 of its 2012 MD&A (filed here). Given lower production
and lower silver prices, dramatically higher operating cash flow is impossible.


The final nail in the coffin for SVM's deceitful cash flow forecast is the fact that
management first presented it over halfway through the 2013 fiscal year during which
operating cash flow had already sharply declined. SVM's actual reported operating cash
flow for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2013 was only $19.3 million and $23.9
million, respectively. First half 2013 operating cash flow totaled only $43.2 million, a
decline of 38% from fiscal 2012.


In summary, SVM management issued a $160 million operating cash flow forecast
for fiscal 2013, an increase of 42% from fiscal 2012, despite:


1. Issuing declining production guidance for fiscal 2013
2. Assuming declining silver prices from $35.88 to $30
3. Having achieved only $43.2 million in operating cash flow in the first half of


fiscal 2013, a decline of 38% from 2012.


I conclude that SVM management's $160 million fiscal 2013 operating cash flow
forecast was therefore intentionally false and misleading.


Question: Were the Wall Street analysts that follow SVM deceived by management's
forecast?


Answer: No. At the time of SVM management's false $160 million forecast, both BMO
and Raymond James analysts forecast fiscal 2013 operating cash flow of only a little over
$80 million, half of management's guidance.


Once again it was the small investors who trusted management who were cheated.
SVM management responsible for the fabricated forecast should be held
accountable by securities regulators.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1228901-silvercorp-management-misled-investors-with-a-false-cash-flow-forecast-and-delayed-negative-news 5/40


If SVM management asserts that the false forecast was merely a "typo" then securities
regulators should wisely ask why SVM management repeatedly touted the same glaring
"typo" over two months on roadshows and at investment conferences as shown below
(click the links above at the beginning of this article to view the actual presentations):


Investors lured into buying SVM stock based on these presentations made during
this period were damaged as a result of SVM's continued stock price decline as
SVM's actual reported operating cash flow continued to fall far short of
management's intentionally false and misleading forecast.


2) SVM management selectively disclosed a lower operating cash flow forecast to
Global Hunter clients


On January 15 and 16, 2013 (9.5 months into the fiscal year), SVM management
selectively disclosed a lower $127 million operating cash flow forecast, privately, in
roadshow presentations (linked at the beginning of the article) to Global Hunter Securities'
analysts and clients.


All other SVM investors were left in the dark by SVM management's selective
disclosure. Following this negative disclosure SVM stock traded sharply lower as shown
in the following chart:


A copy of slide 16 from SVM's private presentation to Global Hunter showing the lower
$127 million operating cash flow forecast appears below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1228901-silvercorp-management-misled-investors-with-a-false-cash-flow-forecast-and-delayed-negative-news 6/40


Note: On this revised slide SVM management also provided a more inclusive history of its
CapEx expenditures, including plant and equipment purchases as well as acquisitions as
part of CapEx. Notice how the operating cash flow is often entirely offset by the capital
investments, meaning that investors will have to wait for future cash flows (that
management has clearly exaggerated) to generate any real free cash flow.


3) In early 2013 SVM management staged a series of positive announcements to
boost the stock price while delaying disclosure of negative news


In January 2013, faced with a stock price trading at three-year lows, CEO Rui Feng
bought a token number of shares and began publishing a series of positive press releases
beginning 1/25/13 in a desperate and calculated effort to manipulate the stock price higher
as shown below:


1/21/13 - SVM Chairman and CEO Rui Feng purchased 30,000 shares


1/25/13 - Silvercorp: Open Letter from Chairman


1/28/13 - SVM Audit Committee Chairman Robert Gayton purchased 4,500 shares


1/28/13 - Silvercorp Announces New Management Appointments to Its Operations in

(Note: Investors who question whether the insider purchases by Rui Feng and Robert
Gayton are legal, occurring prior to SVM's share buyback announcement might be
disappointed to learn that such purchases, under Canadian law, may be permissible)


By late January 2013, prior to the positive PR blitz, SVM management was certainly
aware of the following very materially negative developments (not disclosed until the
2/13/13 earnings release):


1. A write down of $9.6 million of its investment in New Pacific Metals (TSX: NUX)
after NUX stock price became depressed, at least in part, from its lack of progress
developing its shuttered Tagish Lake Gold subsidiary, that in December 2012 pled
guilty to mine safety violations and ignored a stop work order related to deficient
equipment. Sentencing is expected later this month. As Director, CEO, and President
of Tagish Lake Gold, Rui Feng should certainly know that mine safety is critical to
keeping mines operating. In China, for example, mines that conceal deadly accidents
can be shut down or even expropriated by the government.


2. A very disappointing downwardly revised fiscal 2014 silver production forecast
of 6.7 million ounces (approximately 7.8 million silver equivalent ounces, according
to SVM's latest investor presentation). This marks a 20% decline from SVM's previous
9.7 million ounce (silver equivalent) fiscal 2014 production forecast. This also marks
the 2nd year in a row in which SVM has dramatically lowered its original production
guidance.


3. Commercial production from the GC Project was delayed another six months, for
a total of one year in cumulative delays since the pre-feasibility study published in
January 2012 valued the project at $73.7 million. The economics of the GC Project
continue to favor the seller of the project, an entity controlled by a relative of CEO Rui
Feng identified only as "J. Feng." The seller received a total consideration of $60
million from SVM having only paid in $4 million capital to the company (most of that
only six months prior to the sale of the company). Nearly five years later, the GC
project has yet to generate any revenues.


4. Third quarter operating cash flow of $27.8 million, down 12% from 2012. Nine
month operating cash flow totaled only $71 million, down 29% from 2012 and not
even beginning to approach the $160 million full year forecast.

Comments (88)


SVM's fourth quarter ending 3/31/13 is always its weakest, due to a 28 day shutdown
management claims to suffer during every Chinese New Year celebration. By my
estimate, SVM can reasonably only generate around another $15 million in
operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the fiscal year total to around $86
million, a far cry from the $127 million SVM management privately disclosed to
Global Hunter clients and an even further cry from the $160 million SVM
management touted to all other SVM investors.


Confronting SVM management over false cash flow forecasts and potential Reg-FD
securities law violations is impossible, as I discovered during SVM's second quarter
conference call and again during SVM's third quarter conference call. SVM management
simply pretends there are no investors in the Q&A queue and ends each call
without taking questions from the public.


4) Cover Up? SVM management quietly removed its false operating cash flow
forecast from the most recent presentation


On 2/25/13 SVM management uploaded its latest investor presentation (given to BMO
clients at an investment conference). In the revised presentation, SVM management
entirely removed the false and misleading $160 million cash flow forecast. However,
simply removing the lie does not change the reality that for three months SVM
management intentionally touted a false and misleading cash flow forecast to investors.


Conclusion


SVM hit a low of $3.60 following the latest earnings report and lowered guidance.
Securities regulators should take action to review all the facts and hold SVM management
accountable for luring investors with an intentionally false and misleading cash flow
forecast and a series of positive press releases timed to precede the disclosure of very
materially negative news.


Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned (as of 2/26/13), but may initiate a
short position in SVM over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses
my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship
with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Author’s reply »  Let's see how quickly SVM removes the false presentations from its website and slideshare site.

state_of_affairs
The decline in the share price certainly has to do with the downward revisions of production and operating
cash flow. But to allege willful deception is a totally different matter. Since I am home away from work, I can
finally respond to your article more completely.


As I pointed out in my other post, the European Roadshow presentation was fairly transparent in its financial
figures. Furthermore, the results from 2013-Q1 and 2013-Q2 were readily available to all concerned. So the
evidence in your article, including your reference to the BMO and Raymond James analysts, totally
undermines the point you are trying to make. An investor could easily double-check the figures. If Silvercorp’s
management wanted to deceive investors, they would not be as brazenly stupid as provide all of the
incriminating evidence.


When I got home, I wanted to see if management relied on a historical basis to project its 2013E value for
operating cash flow. For me, understanding the motive was important. If a historical basis could be confirmed,
your smoking gun has done nothing more than fire a blank.


From Slide 5, the 2013E production estimates are:


[1] Silver – 5,520,000 oz. 
[2] Gold – 8300 oz. 
[3] Lead/Zinc – 85,700,000 lbs.


From Slide 16, the BMO estimates for long-term metal prices are:


[1] Silver – $30/oz. 
[2] Gold – $1700/oz. 
[3] Lead – $1.00/lb. 
[4] Zinc – $1.20/lb.


Let’s assume a conservative aggregate price of $1.00/lb. for lead and zinc production. Then the individual
metal revenues are:


[1] Silver – $165,600,000 
[2] Gold – $14,110,000 
[3] Lead/Zinc – $85,700,000


Summing up the individual revenues [1] + [2] + [3] = $265,410,000.


Revenues are obviously not the same as operating cash flow. The calculation of operating cash flow (OCF)
can be tedious, but a simple “gut check” can be completed using operating income (http://bit.ly/UOprV9) from
the annual reports. So with a little help from SEC’s Edgar:

5/18/2018 Silvercorp Management Misled Investors With A False Cash Flow Forecast And Delayed Negative News - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (NYSE:…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1228901-silvercorp-management-misled-investors-with-a-false-cash-flow-forecast-and-delayed-negative-news 10/40


2010A – [A] Revenue: $107.164M, [B] Operating Income: $61.320M, [B]/[A] = 0.57221 
2011A – [A] Revenue: $167.327M, [B] Operating Income: $100.440M, [B]/[A] = 0.60026 
2012A – [A] Revenue: $ 237.962M, [B] Operating Income: $141.734, [B]/[A] = 0.59562 
2013E – [A] Revenue: $265.410M, [B] Operating Income: TBD, [B]/[A] = See Below


The simple “gut check” is the ratio of revenues to operating income, [B]/[A]. For the three prior fiscal years,
this ratio ranged from 0.57221 – 0.60026. So utilizing the historical [B]/[A] range:


2013E – [A] Revenue: $265.410M, [B] Operating Income: $151.870M-$159.315M, [B]/[A] = 0.57221-0.60026


Operating cash flow (OCF) can be calculated from operating income (http://bit.ly/UOprV9) by adding interest
and taxes. But since this analysis is “gut check”, the following approximation gives:


2010A – OI: $61.320M, OCF: $65, OCF/OI = 1.06001 
2011A – OI: $100.440M, OCF: $113M, OCF/OI = 1.12505 
2012A – OI: $141.734, OCF: $128.3M, OCF/OI = 1.10471


Note that operating cash flow is clearly higher than operating income for all three years. So using the
historical OCF/OI range:


[1] Lower limit = $151.870M * 1.06001 = $160.984M 
[2] Upper limit = $159.315M * 1.12505 = $179.237M


The actual statistical average based on the 3 values from [B]/[A] and the 3 values from OCF/OI (i.e., 9 total
values) is $171.532M. So therefore:


2013E – Revenue: $265.410M, Operating Income: $151.870M-$159.315M with <OI> = $156.423, Operating
Cash Flow: $160.984M-$179.237M with <OCF> = $171.532M


So what does this mean?


My analysis suggests that someone used a historical basis to project the 2013E number (i.e., $160M on Slide
16 versus $161M - $179M here). This approach is especially sloppy in light of the obvious results from 2013-
Q1 and 2013-Q2 which show notably reduced quarterly cash flows. But these were available at the time of
the presentation and could readily have been used to question the 2013E value. So as I have already stated,
I don’t think deception was the motivation.

Author’s reply »  State-of-affairs - You forgot that SVM reports revenues net of smelting costs, recovery, and
VAT. If you look it up in their 8/2/12 earnings release (and updated guidance) you will see that they only
realized around $23/oz silver and $1260 per oz/gold and $0.80 per pound lead.


I made the following revenue estimate from SVM's August 2nd Guidance:


 
Product Production1 Realized ASP2 Estimated Revenue 
Silver (oz) 5,500,000 $23 $126,500,000

Lead & Zinc (lb) 85,000,000 $0.80 $68,000,000 
Gold (oz) 8,300 $1,260 $10,458,000 
TOTAL $204,958,000


1Production guidance according to SVM 8/2/12 Press Release 
2Realized ASP is net of VAT, smelter charges and recovery, according to SVM 8/2/12 Press Release


From $205M in sales, I estimate around $85 million in operating cash flow based on Q1 margins. BMO and
Raymond James estimates were also in this range.


However, SVM management up until 2/25/13 kept touting $160 million in projected operating cash flow to
investors.


Someone with finance experience can immediately see that SVM's forecast was false (I believe intentionally
false).


Most small investors, however, are not able to make their own estimates. Even you, who seem reasonably
sophisticated, didn't realize that SVM reports revenues net of smelter cost and VAT.


Therefore SVM management absolutely must be held accountable for their lies (or gross negligence if you
want to call it that)

Mr. Little, (Jon Carnes) -- Regarding your article on SVM's misleading cash flow statements, you need to
know that many of us who have written replies to this commentary, within your Seeking Alpha article and in
support of your position, are having our comments stricken as "Reported Abuse". There appears to be an
organized effort of some sort to silence your side of the commentary and isolate your position.

Funny, I can see people in support of the blogs comments.


28 Feb 2013, 11:08 AM


ryu
must be held accountable when you were not held accountable for your misleading statements?


seriously AL and RRRichmond. please. 
we could have told you that.


our estimates are also in line with yours anyway. 
237 would be 2012 revenue and we know 2013 revenue would be less than that by at least 20 million
estimated


the cash flow would be around 113 million for 2012 did anyone think 2013 being lower priced silver would
generate higher than 2012 cash flow? of course not you would still have to be a TOTAL idiot to not see that.

the estimates though were based on BMO estimates GO SUE BMO then AL/JON idiot supporters.


Why I dont see you screaming at them yet? I think AL/Jon is paid to do his pieces for svm in all essence.


so did you calculate the difference in prices vs the market prices for the production yet? or will you not do any
work again?


where is your quality assurance. You are still a failure as an analyst, when you dont even look at disclaimers


ps rrrichmond both sides get reported many times as well its goes without saying. it is not just you dont think
you are special.


even we post on AL blog yes I posted there as well he blocked me as well. so what is your point at least
report abuse still your message is out as it does nothing. 
while moderators can shut you out

that he does not like I tried it with different handles and he blocked the ones that are extremely revealing and
damaging to him while letting the neutral ones go through.


shows transparency? 
note: there were no insults in there but objective questions

ps  
here is some data on lead zinc prices for 2012


prices were .9 average lead price for 2012


zinc = again .88 average price for 2012 
silver = 28-29 average price for 2012 
gold = 1600 average price for 2012.


thus that accounts for more than 20-30 million cash right there. 
and then there was a few % hit from the power outages from china government clamping down.


leading to their new 127 forecast.


but I would add there may still be some accounting errors as they are using 31.74 as the base price of the
forecast which is not good for that chart.


PS even your slides presented now are outdated. ps maybe you should use MS Paint to circle the important
data pointing out the information YOU LEFT OUT.

It really is rather funny.


I hate you if you say something I don't want to hear.


Never mind the truth, facts or a reasonable educated guess.


Tell me what I want to hear !


P.S. In addition to declining production


costs of production generally increase substantially 
as time goes by, the "easy stuff" is usually obtained first 
it simply and generally gets harder and harder to get at 
more and more product through time (whether oil silver 
gold or anything else). I think we shall soon see costs 
of production perhaps underestimated.

Paullev, I believe I disagree with more of your statements than any comment I've ever read........ but I DO
believe you bought SVM for a long term hold. I bought SVM a while back and thought the ups and downs
were too "regular" to be "normal". I wrote a comment on an SVM article in August, if anyone is interested. All
that being said, I wish you the best of luck!


As for "Alfred Little ........ He does seem gung ho on his chastising of AVM but perhaps he has reasons we

i dont have much time for this jon as I am posting while working unlike you whom do not do real work.


but here is a wiki of what cash flows are: 
Description Amount ($) totals ($) 
Cash flow from operations +10 
Sales (paid in cash) +30 
Materials -10 
Labor -10 
Cash flow from financing +40 
Incoming loan +50 
Loan repayment -5 
Taxes -5 
Cash flow from investments -10 
Purchased capital -10 
Total +40


I will type up more later on.


yes I think you dont know what cash flows mean.


ps no one here actually believes svm had 160 cash flow. 
but we do believe they had the revenue and they mixed it up with the cash flow.


but then again you didnt say anything from the start which btw was so obvious anyway. but you think we dont know?


You think we are dumb dont you?

Author’s reply »  SVM defines operating cash flow themselves, Ryu. The historical figures come straight out
of their statement of cash flows. Management simply lied about the forecast, tricking investors last Fall into
buying their declining stock.


27 Feb 2013, 12:53 PM


ryu
fine then alfred go read my disclaimer of the cash flow look at the disclaimers section and compare them.


I found your main mistake already after spending some time on it looking at the slides you are citing.


again you are playing around with nothing I told you to read them carefully before and you did not again.


Jon I suggest you fire the person whom told you to use the slides 
read it carefully as they are projections of the future and what they are based on.


if you don't see them you are not looking hard enough or you didn't look at them yourself.


Whomever gave you the information needs to be fired.  
They didn't read carefully.


You and your group are operating on bad information again.


Do not say you do not know I told you already.


BMO has lower forecasts thus the cash flow projection naturally goes down.


I also assume the cash flow are revenue - expenses the new guy making the slides in 2012 for fiscal 2013
must not know the way svm does it though. if you have been reading you would understand.


but anyway. you did not calculate the lower estimate prices by the BMO in the disclaimer section.


note the LT added projection meaning long term projection of lead and zinc respectively 1.25, 1.20 and also
lower 24 dollar silver projection.


compared to their BMO estimates of 28 dollar silver projection and higher zinc + lead prices.


you actually didn't read that part?

alfred/Jon why are you saying this when you do it yourself?


The data is based on a bank's estimates namely BMO that was written clearly in there.


and now they are using BMO revised data.


SO what you are really saying is BMO bank lied not SVM then.


Shall your group ask hedgefunds to SHORT BMO then?


You said yourself your data is based off of other people data and if their data is no good then your data is no
good either.


So does that make you a lier too?


If that is the case 99% of wall street needs to go to jail right here right now. Because all of them are doing this
exact thing as basing their assumptions on each other and almost all of them are CLUELESS.


so question what would you have based your data on then eh? 
for me I would have taken the average of all analyst data of course that is if you want to work hard to gather
the data.


most people are lazy. ahem (your group and 90% of society).


so you admit the disclaimer PROVES your article no good then I thank you for admitting as such.


You heard it Hedgefunds. 
(that are playing with HFT the disclaimer proved the article no good)


AGAIN I WILL SAY this AGAIN.


read the data in it's entirety 
ANALYSTS are EXPECTED to do at least that much.


Whomever did the research/gave you the info FIRE HIM/HER NOW.

I am a bit baffled here. How can you deliberately mislead on a forecast projection? You may use assumptions that are
optimistic but again they are assumptions. I look at prevailing conditions and past performance when making my stock
assessments. I always laugh at analyst who come on tv and say by the end of the year this stock or commodity will be
x dollars. I do think this AL has raise valid questions in the past but now I think he is bordering on the ridiculous in his
quest to short this stock.


27 Feb 2013, 12:18 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Management knew their forecast was untrue, therefore they lied. A realistic estimate was
around $80-$90 million. $100 million could considered "optimistic" in that it would require a 10% higher silver
price. $160 million was a brazen lie. Many investors bought stock and lost money because of this lie.

not only did management knew it was untrue but BMO knew that 1.55 was untrue as did everyone that predict
2k gold by now.


or those that said 50 dollar silver by now.


also those that predicted 1300 gold and 20 dollar silver are also liers. 
you all knew.


but you are all liers. oh lord Alfred Little.


I always take the future prospects with a grain of salt if you put things into perspective.


ps many other companies do so as well. shall we say embellish. 
but most of us already know that.


if anything a responsible investor would have already known there was something wrong with the forecast
being so high considering silver + lead prices were lower.


and if you read the disclaimer you would have known why as it was based on BMO analyst forecasts basically
your group forecasting.


because it was based on your industry. I should blame you guys for making BS statements more so than
others.


like an appraiser saying this house is worth 1 million dollars in 1 year compared to 500k the house down the
block because the rate of growth of houses is 100% for that year they think. and in 2 years it is worth 2 million
dollars like really?


we all knew BMO estimates were not likely. unless you think we are the type that listens to the appraiser.
really? do you?


fact we did all the caclucations already. and even gave you it and told management that the future prospects
are a bit off.


actually you made me look again and note it down to give data to you now.


Can you admit already you didnt even READ THE DISCLAIMER?

Author’s reply »  Hi Christopher, In your article recommending SVM on 12/28 you quoted their $160 million
operating cash flow forecast:


"Production is forecast to increase 64.4% as production is projected to increase from 5.9 million ounces of
silver in fiscal year 2013 to 9.7 million ounces of silver for 2014. Operating cash flow is forecast to increase
55% or $88 million from $160 million to $248 million while capital expenditures are forecast to drop 54% or
$41 million from $90 million in fiscal year 2013 to $49 million in 2014. Analyst estimates call for an increase of
earnings to $0.55 for 2014."

I think you and your readers among the victims of management's lies.


full disclosure: I am not short SVM.


27 Feb 2013, 03:48 PM


ryu
actually I thought svm made the mistake and did it as revenue.


note if all goes correctly at 30 dollar silver 1 dollar lead and zinc 
and also gold at 1600-1700


then it would be revenues of 340-390 million 
and then after tax and smelting revenue of 240-280 million


the cash flow is after operation expenses thus they need to discount the expenses as well.


other expenses besides production cost.


240-280 revenue to deal with other expenses shall we say.


there is 25% corporate tax. 
and expansion  
240mil-90mil projected expenses/expansion expenses is about 150 million


25% of 150 = 112.5 left over as worse case scenerio. 
but there are likely other expenses as well.


note 240 is worse case scenerio it is likely 260 as the mean. 
260-90 = 170 * 25% =

127.5million left over. after taxes. 
hmm I wonder if they are calculating before taxes operations cashflow. as it is too close to my calculations.


someone should ask if svm did it before corp tax or after corp tax. 
the newbie of the charts may have did it by accident for before corp tax. 
======================... 
9.7 million silver eq was thought to be including base metals otherwise most people would not estimate 9.7
silv eq.


if it was gold+ silver it is in fact 7.8 like no duh the question was if 9.7 had base metals as well as my
calculations give me very close to 9.7 silver eq if you count base metals spill over after expenses


base spill over+ silver+ gold = 9.7 silver eq oz


gold + silver = 7.7-7.8 silver eq oz


base + silver + gold without base spill over = 11-12 million oz.


27 Feb 2013, 04:23 PM


ryu
I need to do an edit though the revenue this year should be around 200-220 million instead that would be
somewhat close to projections for 2013 there is 1 more q left over.


anyway I am only saying how they got the 160 or 127 cash flows. 
someone there probably should do it step by step and I think they made the mistake from before.


the real cash flow so far is about 71 for 3 q  
who here thinks the cash flow can go to 160 raise thier hands... yeah figured right?


the last q will likely not give 1.2 such prices for lead and zinc thus the cash flow should be discounted to the
estimated values ahem now. 
future projections are just that future projections based on other data. it doesn't mean it is true but it means in
the better case scenerios.

The author needs some support and commentary here. True investors are not "suicidal" in choosing their
realities. They demand (and expect) clear and accountable statements at all times from the companies they
invest in. Several of the loudest commenters on this topic have all their comments directed in support of SVM
and aggressively attacking its critics. I find it unlikely that such passion would be displayed over only one
stock in an investor's portfolio.


To hide behind the excuse that SVM's critics simply do not understand Chinese customs and business
practices is disingenuous to the millions of international entrepreneurs that do understand and play by the
rules of global commerce. Ethical management of any culture does not resort to tactics of arrest and
incarceration in stifling commentary and legitimate speech. Please review:


http://bit.ly/OmHAXv


Could SVM be a profitable, legitimate mining operation, if management had intended it to be? This earlier
Seeking Alpha article by Mr. Gefert answers that question.


http://seekingalpha.co...


Most revealing is the question of the origin and authorship of the SGX mine analysis.This in and of itself
would make SVM uninvestible. Add in the "faux" auction of 5% of of the Henan Found mine and only a fool
would invest in such untrustworthy management.


I am further disturbed by the position taken by Christopher Davis, who I often read on these pages. it clearly
appears that Mr. Davis has proven Mr. Little's ascertions for him. The exagerated cash flow was evidently
taken as fact enough so that it was utrilized by Mr. Davis in his Seeking Alpha article. If such an experienced
and prolific investor/writer as Mr. Davis was misled by SVM management's materials, it is reasonable to
expect that other, less sophisticates, were also fooled. I do believe that was Mr. Little's original point. Chris,
we all make mistakes, but I for one would like to hear your accountability here.


I thank you Mr Carnes, for your work and writings as "Alfred Long." Your efforts to shed light and truth on what
appears to be a darkly sinister corporation is appreciated by this small investor. I would have had no chance
in making an informed investment in this unusual corporation.

state_of_affairs
Jon Carnes (i.e., "Alfred Little"):


Your article comes up short with one glaring oversight: If Silvercorp had actually wanted to deceive investors, they
would not have left easily-seen, readily-comprehendible evidence right in front of the very noses of the people they
were trying to (allegedly) deceive. In fact, the presentation is reasonably transparent regarding the figures and
assumptions behind the $160M cash flow estimate. The discrepancy between the two is so glaringly obvious, my first
inclination is to think Silvercorp had a problem with the spreadsheet they used to generate the estimate, not an
attempt to deceive investors.


What I believe you have actually uncovered is an embarrassing and sloppy oversight on the part of executive
management. Granted, this development is not positive for the company, but it is hardly equivalent to the deception
you are alleging. Not to mention, we are talking about an estimate here. Future projections do not come with
guarantees – which is why all investors should do their own due diligence. Management easily provided enough
transparency in their figure for an investor to double-check the estimate.


And now for some personal criticism: 
Contrary to the self-righteous whistle-blower you are trying to portray, you come across as a cocky, arrogant prick
trying to point out something that I can discover on my own. Do you think that we as investors are so stupid that we
need you to point out something this obvious? The fact that analysts from both BMO and Raymond James questioned
the figure immediately after its presentation is proof in point. Equally important, this entire issue is old news –
something you are trying to whip up to create an impression of fraud.


Of greater concern to small investors should be your motivation for publishing this article. Contrary to your implied
(bogus) concern about small investors, you are publishing on Seeking Alpha to try and exploit small investors for your
own personal gain. You are a known short-seller who has made millions manipulating securities using sensationalist
Internet articles like these. Many do nothing more than raise dubious allegations like you have done here. Your
method of operation is whip up fear, uncertainty, and doubt in shareholders to incite them to sell. You could care less
about the financial losses they incur during the process. In fact, aren’t you currently under investigation by law
enforcement and securities regulators for engaging in securities fraud yourself?


And I hardly buy your disclosure of: “No position as of 2/26/13. I may initiate a new short position in SVM at any time.”
It’s more likely that you have an arrangement to be compensated *by others* from gains *they* make using short
positions set up prior to your article. So let me give you some advice: You and your cohorts need to move on from

now seriously whom thought the cash flows were going to jump up 40%-50% when silver was lower than the previous
years please raise your hand and I have a bridge to sell you.


there was obviously a mistake on the chart the ones that made the longer term chart anyway. some of us brought it to
their attention and they have been fixing their forecast chart. 
======================... 
no NEED for you JON to do anything at all btw.


why you didnt say anything from the start about the cash flow from the first thing? are you dumb or dense?


I was assuming that svm made a mistake with the revenue and operations cash flow instead they may have
subtracted the expense with revenue and they put them up there of course tried to send the email to them about it.


but is too late as you now are parading like a lunatic about nothing for some reason or another even though it was
obvious.


no need for svm to retract the slides as well. 
just issue a statement that the slides are being corrected as they have done already.  
======================...


Also may I add? the slides from before didn't specify if they were using gold + base metals spill over + real silver itself.


now this time they specified only gold + silver was used. 
======================...


revenue - expenses to get their cash flow so they made that mistake.


which btw was obvious.


I was in based on the ore itself it would be in fact.

about 240-280 million revenue after vat tax and smelting costs


and before smelting and vat tax it would be a revenue of 340-390 million.


ahem that is exactly where analysts projected.


SVM didnt mislead anything except presenting wrong slides.


sure really 15-20 million cash flow per q reported totaling  
about 50-60 million cash.


would suddenly jump to 100 million cash? 
unless svm gets a 100 million wind fall from suing jon carnes and his related parties like Anthion management  
(his employer for this case I assume) svm wont get 160 million.


you are all stupid if you think that way.


ps gc mines brings in about 80 million revnue for the coming year. 
how is it not worth 70 million so you say?  
at 30 bucks it gives 22 million  
and then the base metals brings in about 23-24 million


that is about 45-46 million revenue. initial buy cost was 50-70 million which you said the mine was worthless I may
add.


so lets say the profit margin is about 25% after taxes smelting and corporate taxes then for that mine 
then you get 11.25 million per year in real net income increasing the eps of the company by 6-7 pennies per year.


the mine paid was 50-70 million meaning the p/e itself is going to be about 4.44-6.22 for that mine alone.


do the calculations since you are a pro analyst I assume we do not need to give you the prices of the commodities
correct?

Unfortunately, SVM management did not listen to you and "fix" the forecast, as you requested. They just
removed it. How many people were misled and lost money because of this?

At the end of the first half of fiscal 2013, with operating cash flow as reported DOWN 38%, management repeatedly
mistakenly touted to investors that operating cash flow for the full year would be UP 42%?


No one is buying that argument. Certainly not the SEC or NYSE.


27 Feb 2013, 12:59 PM


55mph
this is ludicrous. in the same way the court has given you free speech protection, even in light of your
glaringly obvious conflicts of interest, SVM's forecasts are educated opinions that have absolutely no implied
guarantees.


what a waste of time!!


If SVM intentionally lied about stated revenue, that would be another story. Projections?? laughable.


28 Feb 2013, 01:12 PM


ryu
also I just read the fine print look at the lead and zinc.


there are different calculations under there


this is the 9/2012 slide


*Price Assumption: F2013-F2015 Operating Cash Flows are forecast based on BMO Long-term Metal Prices ( 
Silver: Y2013 - $30/oz, Y2014 $30/oz, Y2015 $28/oz;  
Gold: Y2013 -$1,700/oz, Y2014 $1,500/oz, Y2015 $1,400/oz;  
Lead: Y2013 - $1.00/lb, Y2014 $1.55/lb, Y2015 $1.55/lb;  
Zinc: Y2013 - $1.20/lb, Y2014 $1.50/lb, 2015 $1.50/lb.


is zinc 1.2 lb? I ask that question obvious answer is NO.


and how much of the production of zinc does svm do? 15-20 million for lead it is higher 1.00-1.10 right now which they
mine about 60 million -70 million and next year 80 million.


then look at the new slides what is the assumption of prices? 
did you ask them what prices are they assuming that they are?


no there is no assumption. 
we can assume the prices are estimated to be 2012 prices then as it is within their disclaimer 
they said what


lead: 2012 0.94 cents 
LT: long term if you are dumb: 1.25 cents


zinc: 2012 0.90 cents 
LT: long term if you are dumb: 1.20 cents

Also look at this they predict long term silver from BMO 
silver: 30 bucks 2012 
LT: silver is 24 bucks?


also 3 quarters have passed for fiscal 2013  
do you think lead and zinc will go to 1.20? 
I doubt it 2-3 years from now maybe.


you are not reading the fine print like professionals should are you not?


ps svm profits are about 30-40% are base metals and 50-55% or so silver and 5%-10% gold.


now do you think base metals would affect all the miners cash flow of course man. even ag exk hl etc. 
silver is a by product by and large.


and svm making silver look worse due to BMO projecting lower silver prices.


do you think cash flow will increase as svm is using lower numbers?

Author’s reply »  Ryu, are you saying that the private presentation SVM made to Global Hunter in January,
that shows a lower cash flow forecast, somehow clears management's culpability here?


27 Feb 2013, 03:55 PM


ryu
it was made to come to light now wasn't it?


also I did some cacluations already regarding revenue + the cost.


+ the taxes


those bring me closer to the real operations cash flow actually exactly as expected.


260 mil * -90 million operations expenses = 170


170*25% corporate taxes = 127.5 million cash flow left over.


ahem.... this just made my forecast even more certain. its only 1 q left over they cant expect 1.5 prices for
lead and zinc now can they?


if you want to argue scream and yell at BMO then for lowering the forecasts.


analysts do so all the time. 
ahem cough HL CDE sudden lower forecasts by 25% recently


other miners like exk ag svm paas only 10% lower... yeah really fair?

well he is arguing they are pumping their own stock for hitting good grades and saving them for later when
market conditions want more gold/silver.


I guess telling good news is manipulative because they cant use their own bad news to manipulate as well as
it could be.


namely they wanna manipulate thus dont want others to do the same because it conflicts with them.


so what they do is buy out all the news agencies or make more and more stories covering entire pages to
block off any other information.


basically a spammer that wont let you read the real information 
aka the noise of the market.


that is how wall street operates they will pump and dump or short and distort with the help of the media to suit

it is very predictable.

I believe operating cash flow was overestimated for 2013 because they were assuming lower cash costs than they
actually realized. If you look at chart 5 of that first European Roadshow presentation you can see how cash margin
per ounce of silver had been increasing over the past several years because of lower cash costs, and presumably
they expected this trend to continue, which is how you could have gotten an increase in income and thus cash flow
with a decline in production.


Unfortunately, cash costs actually ended up going up and thus of course cash flow went down, as stated in the last
earnings call:


"our consolidated total and the tax costs per ounce of silver was a $1.62 and a negative $0.72 respectively.
Compared to negative $2.57 and a negative $4.64 ounce of silver respectively in the same quarter last year, the
increase in total and tax cost for ounce of silver was because of higher production costs and a decrease in by-
products metal credit."

IMO you guys are all using miners as short hedge against the market while you are all long the market.


as such if there is A GENERAL market crash it would sap leverage from you all and in fact be a benefit for miners in
general.


I wonder if my theory rings true as it is generally true for 90% of the time so far these few months.


very interesting examining the wall street criminal minds that is your industry.


lets just say the profit margin is actually about 30%? 260 after the vat taxes + smelting


that should be about .45 cents meaning a p/e of less than 10 right now about 8.888


if the before vat tax and smelting was used then it would be 340-390 * 30% then


.6-.68 or so. then but I doubt that. the taxes will lower it. normally miners go for 20-30 p/e like hl cde are extremely
high right now.


cde would be better than hl though if they remain consistent then 30 cents per q if possible will yield 16 p/e or so.


same deal with all miners right now.


because of your bankster friends everyone is shorting the mining industry to the dirt right now.

Cash and Equivalents declined by $18 mm in 3Q12. With $69 mm in cash remaining, additional cost overruns/delays
and/or additional weakness in operating cash flow could become a problem.

My, my..... I've never seen such hype! What's all the fuss? If you want to buy Silvercorp Metals (SVM), buy it! If not,
don't. I owned it for a while but decided it wasn't a good investment. If someone thinks otherwise, that's o.k. with me. I
believe there are a number of better silver mining companies out there. If you have time, look at the two-year
comparisons between SVM and First Majestic (AG), Endeavour (EXK), Fortuna Silver Mines (SFM) and Coeur
d'Alene (CDE):

Of course, the last two years haven't been great for silver mines but this gives some comparisons every mine investor
should be aware of. For what it's worth, I sold my last silver mining stock (AG) when it dropped to $20. Will I be
getting back in? Sure! Will I buy AG again? Yes! Will I buy SVM again? Not in this lifetime!

operating cash flow would grow 42% when in fact it has fallen 29% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2013.

Estimates are for .25-.26 EPS this fiscal the last time I checked.


The lowest estimate for fiscal 2014 is .32 EPS with a average of .50EPS


I expect SVM to end fiscal 2014 between .40-.50 share, that's with the updated forecast. What say you?

heard Henan Found mine managers saying that the JV partner keeps all the profits and SVM gets nothing. So
I am skeptical of everything and wise investors always should be. Beyond that, I have no clue what level of
profit SVM really generates.


Keep in mind that all my experience in China shows that ANYTHING is possible. The most profitable
business I saw was Puda Coal. They also raised over $100M from investors (at $12 per share) and then I
discovered and blew the whistle on the chairman who had secretly transferred ownership of the operating
subsidiary mines to himself. Poof, all value vanished. PUDA is at 5 cents today. SEC charged the chairman

provide more accurate estimates. (However, I also recommended a firm experienced in China, with mandarin
speaking geologists managing the project. AMC Vancouver office has neither, as far as I can tell.)
Nevertheless I was pleased to see that AMC found 1) 79% (60 million ounce) decline in the Inferred silver
resource,  
2) 46% (55 million ounce) decline in total silver resource.


I never challenged Proven resources or even mentioned the word in my reports. Looking at the measured and
indicated resource of the SGX mine, they went up by a combined 5 million ounces. Compared to the 60
million ounce decline in the inferred resource, this is nothing. A few people keep acting like the huge 60
million ounce decline in the Inferred resource doesn't warrant concern. I strongly disagree and I believe it
borders on fraud. How did some changes in calculation from 2011 to 2012 make 79% of the resource
disappear? Unless the 2011 figures were exaggerated.

Wow! Talk about hypocrisy. When you published your first report on Silvercorp Metals, you used a website
(alfredlittle.com) registered in Sweden with no listed owner. Precisely where was your securities license,
office, or employees? Without those, why should anyone have trusted you? You didn’t even have the guts to
identify yourself. It took a court-ordered discovery process to track through all of your aliases and shell
companies to learn that information. If you insist on high standards for others, we are entitled to the same for
you. After all, both you and BK were making assessments of financial importance regarding Silvercorp.


So what about those high standards? Unfortunately, you don’t have much credibility here. In that September
2011 report, you used rock samples to claim that grades from Silvercorp’s Ying mine were lower than the
Silvercorp claimed. The only problem was that those rock samples were – to quote your report directly – “ore
that had fallen off the trucks, littering the road along the route from the ferry dock to the mills”. Translation:
You could not confirm that the rocks came from veins in the mine (i.e., not discards), but you decided to
present them as representative anyway.


In a due-diligence of your work, Metal Augmentor had the following to say based on pictures of the rocks you
so confidently provided:

Charlatan Exposed: Silvercorp’s Shorts 
http://bit.ly/oJ5ftc


“Wow, what can we say! What an impressive pile of random rocks that probably did not fall off an ore truck!
Many of them are clearly weathered with smooth edges or showing signs of air exposure (oxidation of iron
sulfides) and as such they do not appear to be the product of very recent mining activity. Our guess would be
these rocks are larger fragments from the fill material that was used to construct an all-weather road capable
of supporting heavy truck traffic. The rocks could have come from the mine as well — perhaps barren or low
grade development material — but they do not appear to be representative of high-grade veins (or even
medium-grade ones) . . . Here is how ore might look like at various grades coming out of a silver-base metal
vein (these are from my personal collection and also have some iron staining that would not appear as
extensively discolored on freshly mined rock) . . . Notice a few things. One, the material tends to be angular
since it was literally blasted out of whole rock by explosive force. Two, it doesn’t have rounded edges from
weathering. Three, it has clear vein textures (bands of different colors) instead of typical rock composition.
Four, there is some sparkly stuff representing sulfides (these rocks are high grade overall but there are also
lower grade portions). Five, oxidation is in spots and bands confirming this to be vein material. All in all, we’d
estimate that 75% or more of the rocks in the IFRA “sample” photograph did not “fall off a truck” that was
transporting freshly-blasted ore from the SGX mine to the mill.”


In essence, you were exposed for publishing a misleading report so you could capitalize on an open short
position(s). Metal Augmentor goes on in their report to discredit a number of your other claims, too. So after
that, why do you think that anyone should believe anything you say about Silvercorp?


As for the estimated operating cash flow number, you are making a mountain out of a mole hill. Your
argument of willful deception remains unproven. As I said earlier, if Silvercorp’s management wanted to
deceive investors, they would not be as brazenly stupid as provide all of the incriminating evidence on the
investors’ behalf (e.g., audit SEC quarterly filings). Nobody believes this nonsense.

That "other information" is audited. In fact, it is the audited information from the 2013 Q1 and Q2 SEC filings
that Jon (aka Alfred Little) uses to discredit the $160M estimate for 2013 operating cash flow. Any idiot could
do that, which is why this article is such an embarassment for management (and should be). But it is also
strong evidence that misleading investors was not management's intent. If management wanted to hide things
from investors, they wouldn't provide such obvious, incriminating evidence.


As for the possibility of other inaccuracies, I doubt it. The auditor (KPMG) is reputable. More importantly, if
there were other inaccuracies, Jon would have screamed his fingers off to bring them to your attention. If this
is all he has . . . <yawn>.

Canadian company like Silvercorp Metals. Also, the CEO of PUDA was Chinese versus a Canadian like Silvercorp.
Trying to say Silvercorp is the next PUDA is a massive stretch given the audits and evidence SVM has brought to
clear their name.

Regarding unsubstantiated rumors, I've heard that you're under investigation by the S.E.C., but does that make it
true?

Auditor's Report (Aud. Name & Aud. Op.) UQ UQ UQ UQ


======================... 
that is the cash flow for HL. only 69 million for the 2012 year. 
previous was understandable because of lawsuit 171 write down. 
and also this year was lucky friday closed. but still 69 million cash flow only?


I was expecting 90 million at least because 2009 cash flows were at 197 million. 
and prices of silver are higher now. admittingly the net income of HL is something to be desired 14 million only... well
you get the picutre. lucky friday only does 2 million oz per year anyway of silver.


there are lots of other costs involved in HL. why don't you find a cash flow forecast for HL. 
======================... 
this is why I dont like cash flow forecasts in general as you dont know what expenses pop up and are not exactly
reliable anyway. 
rather I would look at production vs revenue. but to look at real health of course you need to look at cash flow to see
where the expenses are.


i estimate svm will be spending about 100 million on cash flow expenses cap exp+plant+ eq +acquisitions and such.


for hl I estimate the cash flow may increase back to 80-90 million after lucky friday comes back online. not much at all
but it should give hl at least 16-18 cents per year if silver remains at these levels.


considering they only made .03 adjusted eps after all those derivatives they used in hl instance.


and yes I really want to look at HL cash flow prediction and other miners for that matter.

Be careful. He'll start writing that HL is a fraud too. Not kidding.


03 Mar 2013, 03:25 AM


ryu
this is why I suspect they didnt update their charts until recently for the year.


if you can provide us with all the old charts for comparison it would be ideal btw.


just comparing the recent ones is not enough. since you seem to have every single piece of data on svm so you say
you do please do.


then we can nitpick it to death and find what went wrong with the forecast.

Income from operations 29,469 35,021 66,859 121,229 
-=====================... 
here is the data from the sales and expenses side. 
what do you think.


lower net income of course. 
where are the expenses and also why so much lower sales?


here is another hint maybe because of such low silver prices for an extended period of time 
they would rather sit and do less than actually mine the stuff for below cost of production.


remember price of silver was below 30 dollars for quite a while. I dont know about you but I would rather do less then
when the profit margins are falling.


Why try harder when the reward is so much less? 
notice prices of silver went up and svm mined 1500 oz of silver instead of 1200 and 1300 earlier from q1 and q2.


they always had the capacity to mine 1500+ anyway if prices warrant them to do more. 1500+ = about 6+ million in
real silver. 
adding gold it would be likely 6.5-7 million if they wanted to.


but prices of silver were below the expected rate of return after all.

ryu
look at this part


Sales $ 58,717 $ 61,876 $ 148,475 $ 193,650 
Cost ofsales 12 21,241 18,326 56,681 46,820 
Gross profit 37,476 43,550 91,794 146,830


cost of sales increased by 10 million for more work done. 
selling about the same amount of ore though. while getting less profit for it. due to lower silver prices.


and also news flash to AL/JON the prices of silver were averaged to be about 28-29 dollars for most of the months
and only maybe 1 q they had it above 30 dollars 35 dollars was a 1-2 week duration.


really that is your analyst opinion? 
I told you to look at the metal charts.


01 Mar 2013, 04:46 AM


ryu
the left out data of expenses would have lowered net income thus lower the cash flow.


the cap expend + plant + acq we know will exceed 90 million expense accounted for now at the least.


will that not be counted? hmm?

Author’s reply »  One year later, who was right?


The 2012 AMC technical report totally contradicted the previous 2011 BK technical report on SVM's key SGX mine
(74% of historical sales) and found substantially lower resources:


1) 79% (60 million ounce) decline in the Inferred silver resource,  
2) 46% (55 million ounce) decline in total silver resource

Thank you JNG85. All the links you provided where very informative. Anyone interested in investing in SVM
should read them all.

Others, more knowledgable about mining grades and resources rebutted your conclusions thoroughly.
Doesn't surprise me that you left out that information so that others could not read it. Fortunately, JNG85 has
provided the link below.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Others, either less knowledgable about mining grades or more biased to support their
investment theses published various pieces in support of SVM in 2011 when the stock was $7-$10. In 2012
SVM reduced the key SGX resource by 55 million ounces and blamed its declining grades on failures of
management brought on by "distractions" from... short sellers! When that flimsy excuse failed to work,
management changed the way they reported results and changed the mining method. More excuses. Stock
still in the dumps.

Guess who gets hurt in these typical class actions? The same people who were hurt if allegations are proven true,
officers and maybe company fined while shorts move in and get burned when good news comes out with no time to
cover while a few like I am dive in long at low prices w/less risk and clean house. Someone has to make money and it
might as well be me JMO.


I'll be adding shares this week and on AKS and AMD as well for investment and or trades.


Good luck all.

Just recently I made my very first stock purchase....lol.... SVM, a lot of drama... the price is low. I have no real clue
what Im doing yet .... maybe they are a little dirty, maybe they arent... Im just hoping all this BS helps me make
enough to pay off my RV ..... any other stocks that have been publicly beat up and down in price I can purchase for
the same rate???? Im sure Mr Little knows what he's doing its just his agenda that is in question.... depending on how
things play out, I could make bank just following the companies he writes about..... if he's right, he just pointed out a
real discrepancy that probably wont happen again by SVM, If he's dead wrong and did this for short selling .... shame
on you, but thanks to all this I think I just got one hell of a deal on SVM stock. Again, I have no clue what Im doing yet,
Ill be depending on you guys and USAA to learn.... I live below my means and buying physical and learning to invest
gives me better odds than playing Keno. Thanks to all for posting so I can read and learn.
