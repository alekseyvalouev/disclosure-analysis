Riot Blockchain: This Crypto Clown Car
Continues Hurtling Toward The Abyss

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT)), which had detailed a broad array of red �ags relating


to the company’s sudden name change and business pivot from a medical device company, its


3  metamorphosis within the span of a year.


Since that original piece, a slew of new information has come out, much of it having been


released on Fridays after the market close. Given that these releases have occurred during


periods of relative market inactivity, we believe the timing may have mitigated the impact of


negative developments.


Share Registration Could Create Near-Term Selling
Pressure


Per an S-3 �led on Friday


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000010/riot_s3.htm) after


the close, the company is registering 3,292,226 shares of common stock and common stock


issuable upon warrant exercise. The implication of this �ling is that investors who had


purchased shares in the recent private placement o�ering


(https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/21/riot-blockchain-


announces-37-million-private-placement) will be free to trade them once the statement


is declared e�ective


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000747/riot_8k.htm). We


believe this could create near to mid-term selling pressure, especially if the investors take a cue


from the company’s own CEO who recently sold o� a signi�cant portion of his shares


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000114036117047827/xslF345X03/doc1.x


ml).


The number of shares being registered is meaningful. Per the �ling, as of January 4 , the


company had 11,622,112 shares of common stock outstanding. The 1,646,113 common shares


being registered represent over 14% of the outstanding common shares. The registration of


1,646,113 warrants issuable into shares of common stock at a $40 strike price also could create


additional selling pressure. Note that the company has 1,458,001 preferred shares convertible


into common issued and outstanding as well.


The Company Dismissed its Auditor


According to an 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000008/riot_8k-

LLP (headquartered in Calgary Canada) was engaged on January 5 . Based on the S-3 


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000010/riot_s3.htm)�led


Friday after the close, we see that the company had used a di�erent audit �rm, GHP Horwath,


P.C., until January 13, 2017. The S-3 notes that the partners and employees of GHP joined


another independent registered public accounting �rm, likely in relation to its acquisition by


Crowe Horwath LLP (https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2016/10/18/denvers-crowe-


ghp-horwath-acquired-by-8th-largest.html).


We �nd the frequent shu�ing of auditors to be a red �ag that warrants investor caution. Given


that Riot has had 3 auditors within the span of a year, we have little faith in their �nancial


controls.


New Audit Sheds More Light on the Company’s
Bizarre Approach to Purchasing (And Overpaying
for) Cryptomining Assets


Readers of our earlier piece (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131031-riot-blockchain-sudden-


business-pivot-suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend) may recall that we had


uncovered oddities in relation to the company’s transaction to acquire cryptomining


equipment. For example, rather than purchasing the equipment directly from


the manufacturer’s website (https://shop.bitmain.com/) or from a supplier, Riot chose instead


to acquire a 2-week-old corporate entity called Kairos Global Technology (“Kairos”) that held the


cryptomining equipment. Our belief was and continues to be that Riot signi�cantly overpaid for


these assets, and new information not only corroborates those initial conclusions but also


raises additional questions.


An audit of Kairos


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000009/ex99x1.htm) was


�led as an amended 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000009/0001079973-18-


000009-index.htm) and was also released Friday after the close. It con�rmed that Kairos had


purchased its equipment for $2,089,679, which was close to our earlier estimate of $1.9 million.


The “excess purchase price over acquired assets


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000009/ex99x2.htm)” of


Kairos was recorded as $8,637,545, con�rming that net of cash the company paid more than 4x


for equipment from the entity that existed for only about 2 weeks.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
While the above corroborated much of our initial analysis, one item turned up in the audit that


we did not expect. We had mistakenly assumed that Kairos (i) purchased the cryptomining


equipment directly from the manufacturer; then (ii) Riot dramatically overpaid for the


equipment by purchasing Kairos at a premium. Instead, in the “Related Party Transactions”


section of the Kairos audit, we found this:


During the period, the Company [Kairos] purchased equipment of $2,089,679 from a


company controlled by the president of the Company.


In other words, Kairos actually purchased the mining equipment from a yet another entity (a


related party one) before ultimately being acquired by Riot.


After all, why buy cryptomining equipment directly from the manufacturer’s website


(https://shop.bitmain.com/) or from a supplier when you can dramatically overpay for it by


simply purchasing it through a 2-week-old entity that purchased it from a di�erent related


party entity that purchased it from (presumably) the manufacturer or a supplier?


Conclusion


We believe Riot is on a collision course with the annals of history. Despite this, given the


company’s recent $37 million (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riot-blockchain-


announces-37-million-private-placement-300573173.html) private placement, we fully expect


there to be more forthcoming announcements of purchases of varying amounts of


cryptomining equipment or token investments in blockchain-related assets. Investors recently


have responded feverishly to such press releases, so we expect the stock will have continued


future volatility. We therefore are hedged and are positioned for a bumpy ride along the way.


Best of luck to all.
