Blair Levinsky Short High Liner Foods: Sohn Canada
Presentation


We're posting up notes from the Sohn Canada Investment Conference 2015


(Capitalize For Kids.)Â  Next up is Blair Levinsky from Waratah Capital


Advisors who pitched a short of High Liner Foods. 





Blair Levinsky's Capitalize For Kids Presentation 








-Â Â Â  Questions: 


oÂ Â Â  What is the situation? 


oÂ Â Â  Why does it exist? 


oÂ Â Â  How is it going to change? 





-Â Â Â  Crowding in non-resource equities 


-Â Â Â  Hot IPO market, expensive food companies 


-Â Â Â  Short High Liner Foods (TSE:HLF) 


-Â Â Â  Customers such as Walmart, McDonalds for seafood 


-Â Â Â  Have seen growth in sales and EBITDA yet volumes have declined 13 quarters


in a row, margins have compressed. 


-Â Â Â  Attempting to bail themselves out of the mess through acquiring companies with


debt. 


-Â Â Â  Now they are overlevered and have bad businesses to run 


-Â Â Â  Through analysis of the cash flow statement it looks like realized incremental


EBITDA/Capex+acqusitions+NWC inv. Between 2011 and 2014 imply average


acquisition price of 13.3x multiple which is very high for industry 


-Â Â Â  High Liner claims to have a 30% pay out ratio but have averaged -$40MM in


FCF for the last 5 years but have been increasing the dividend payout for the large


family shareholder who likes dividends 


-Â Â Â  Current earnings are $71MM (without adjustments), have told the street they


will see $150MM in EBITDA in 2016, difficult to manage given lack of balance


sheet flexibility and inability to drive cost cuts

Replying to @BongCapital and 2 others
Think these channels just make a self-
reinforcing cycle. See something you 
want, canâ€™t have it, want it more. 
Dopamine hit. Could be interesting 
experiment to see ultra high-end try 
something like invitation-only access for 
clients.
