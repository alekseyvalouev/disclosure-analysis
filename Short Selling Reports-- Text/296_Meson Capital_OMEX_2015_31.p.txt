Odyssey Gives Up Control For Distressed Loan, Significantly Dilutes
Potential Upside

by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


Friday afternoon, OMEX announced a dilutive distressed loan to Minera del Norte
(MINOSA), a Mexican iron and coal company that will give them control of the
Company.


MINOSA received a call option to purchase all of OMEX’s Oceanica stake for
$40mm which it could exercise tomorrow if it wanted.


The loan is distributed monthly to fund OMEX’s cash burn BUT MINOSA can
determine to not proceed to at its SOLE DISCRETION if it does not like Oceanica.


Is OMEX abandoning the shipwreck business entirely with this deal as well as HMS
Victory’s recent failure? Will OMEX be the next Chatham Rock Phosphate?


Though this deal prevents imminent bankruptcy, it carries a heavy cost and severely
limits any upside for current shareholders even in the best case scenarios for
Oceanica.


On Friday afternoon, a classic time to release bad news when investors are off for the
weekend, Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) posted a press release and 8-K
with documents for a complex deal that gives up control of the company while severely
diluting potential upside to existing shareholders. Though the deal still requires
shareholder approval - given that many shareholders were looking for a homerun for the
risk they take with OMEX stock, they may be upset with how little they are receiving for
handing over the majority of their upside to a new investor with no history with the
company. Management seems to have taken the easy way out rather than truly "going for
it" to create value for their current shareholders. Will shareholders demand appraisal rights
to get their full value they believe in?


It is a complex deal and we hope to help investors understand the true implications of this
deal as we believe the press release issued Friday was highly misleading. We include
direct quotes from the legal documents filed by OMEX to the SEC.


The purchase agreement begins:

WHEREAS, the Company has informed the Investor that without the Loans and the
Contemplated Transactions, it would be subject to financial distress;


Deal Process Steps


1) March 11 - June 30: The $14.75mm loan and loan closings (March 11: $2mm; March
15: $6mm; Apr 30: $3mm; May 31: $2mm; June 30: $1.75mm) - This fully encumbers
OMEX's Oceanica 54mm shares.


2) Before 150 days: The "Preliminary Transactions," which include giving MINOSA
majority of the board and a 6-1 reverse share split.


3) The "Initial Closing" occurring on the later of 150 days from March 11 or 3 days after
the conditions are met. This provides OMEX with 35mm shares of convertible (at $1/sh)
preferred 8% interest equity delivered (the first $14.75mm to repay the loan)


4) The "Subsequent Closings" occurring March 1, 2016; Sept, 2016; March 2017; March
2018 which provide more convertible (at $1/sh) preferred 8% interest equity.


5) At any point in the future at MINOSA's option, if OMEX stock trades above $1.26, they
can purchase an additional 86.7mm convertible preferred shares at $0.50/sh creating
enormous dilution per share.


The most important thing to understand about this process is in the purchase agreement
section 6.2(I) - This gives MINOSA the UNILATERAL ability to not proceed while
apparently still maintaining its full lien on the 54mm Oceanica shares. On the other hand,
OMEX does not appear to have any ability to force MINOSA to provide any additional
capital if the need arises.


Section 6.2. Investor Conditions. The obligation of Investor to consummate the
Initial Closing is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Investor in its sole
discretion) of the following conditions:


Don Diego Consent. The Investor shall, in its Sole Discretion, be satisfied with the
viability of the Don Diego Project (including, but not limited to, the status of the
application for and the terms of all necessary Permits related to the Don Diego
Project).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3003186-odyssey-gives-up-control-for-distressed-loan-significantly-dilutes-potential-upside 3/22


MINOSA designed themselves an escape hatch for each step of the way in section 6.2 of
the purchase agreement


Step 1: March 11 - June 30: The $14.75mm loan at 8%


As reported in OMEX's press release - the deal is to provide $14.75mm in 8% loans to
Odyssey between March 11 ($2mm already closed) and June 30 in order to fund OMEX's
ongoing cash burn and presumably refinance the roughly $8mm of debt due in May 2015
due to Fifth Third tied to proceeds from the SS Central America that still has not been
monetized.


Given OMEX's historical cash burn and upcoming debt payments due, this loan appears
to be enough to fund the company through approximately July IF a) they lower their cash
burn to only $1.5mm/month and b) repay the $8mm Fifth Third loan in May. However,
unless they lower cash burn further (i.e. terminating employees?) or somehow extend the
Fifth Third May loan, it seems like additional capital will be required before the September
"Initial Closing" which provides the dilutive preferred equity that converts effectively at
$1/share.


The $14.75mm loan fully encumbers all of OMEX's 54mm Oceanica shares


According to the Pledge Agreement for this loan - if OMEX fails on its obligations - it loses
its entire Oceanica stake.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3003186-odyssey-gives-up-control-for-distressed-loan-significantly-dilutes-potential-upside 4/22


PLEDGE AGREEMENT, dated as of March 11, 2015 (this "Agreement"), between
MINERA DEL NORTE, S.A. DE C.V., a Mexican societe anonime (hereinafter
referred to as "PLEDGEE"), ODYSSEY MARINE ENTERPRISES LTD., a
corporation existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas,
(hereinafter referred to as "ODYSSEY" or "PLEDGOR"), and OCEANICA
RESOURCES, S. DE R.L., a sociedad de responsabilidad limitada existing under
the laws of the Republic of Panama (hereinafter referred to as "OCEANICA").


…


SECTION 12. Termination. This agreement can be terminated at any time by
PLEDGEE constituting sufficient cause for PLEDGEE to demand full and immediate
payment, regardless of the duration of the agreement, for any of the following:


(A) Any delays in the payment of any of the Obligations.


(B) If PLEDGEE deems PLEDGOR's financial condition has deteriorated up to a
point where PLEDGOR is not capable of paying its Obligations to PLEDGEE or any
other creditor.


(C) The installment of any bankruptcy proceedings, insolvency, attachments or
creditor's meetings against the PLEDGOR.


(E) If PLEDGOR does not abide by any and all obligations under this contract.


Section 12 is the most interesting in that it appears that MINOSA can again unilaterally
deem that OMEX's financial condition has deteriorated and can accelerate the pledge
which effectively gives them full ownership of OMEX's Oceanica 54mm shares.
Interestingly, in section 14 Remedies Upon Default - there does not appear to be any
ability to cure a default. So OMEX again is in an extremely weak negotiating position here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3003186-odyssey-gives-up-control-for-distressed-loan-significantly-dilutes-potential-upside 5/22


This deal puts OMEX in an extremely weak negotiating position going forward


MINOSA Can take ALL of OMEX's Oceanica Stake for $40mm tomorrow if it wants


As part of the initial loan transaction for $14.75mm, MINOSA receives a call option to
purchase ALL 54 million of OMEX's Oceanica shares for $40 million. At any time in the
next year as long as before the "initial closing" (in 150+ days) they can exercise this. If
OMEX's stake in Oceanica were worth more than $40mm, why would it give away an
option to completely exit Oceanica for this valuation?


The Right. Subject to Section 6.1 hereof, during the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the date that is one year from the date hereof (the "Expiration
Date"), Purchaser shall have the right to purchase from Holder, and Holder shall be
obligated to sell to Purchaser, the Subject Shares in exchange for the Option
Consideration (the "Right"); provided, however, if the Initial Closing (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) has occurred, then Purchaser may not exercise the Right
unless and until any of the conditions to a Subsequent Closing (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) are not satisfied (whether or not the date of determination is a
Subsequent Closing Date). In consideration of the granting of the Right, on the date
hereof, Purchaser shall pay to Holder $1.00.


Step 2: By September or so - "Preliminary Transactions" - Is OMEX exiting the
treasure hunting business?


From the purchase agreement:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3003186-odyssey-gives-up-control-for-distressed-loan-significantly-dilutes-potential-upside 6/22


Section 1.4. Preliminary Transactions. Prior to the consummation of the Initial
Closing, the Company shall undertake the following transactions (the "Preliminary
Transactions"):


file, or cause to be filed, the Articles Amendment with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada providing for, among other things: a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the
Common Stock, upon which every six shares of issued and outstanding Common
Stock shall be automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of
Common Stock, without any change in the par value per share; and (ii) classifying
the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") into three different
classes, with the entire Board of Directors being elected at the Stockholder Meeting,
and thereafter, with one Class subject to election in each year, with Class I being
subject to election in 2016; and


include in the Proxy Statement designees of Investor, reasonably acceptable to the
Board of Directors (the "Investor Designees"), for election as the Class III Directors
and as a majority of the Class II Directors (and in the aggregate constituting a
majority of the Board of Directors).


OMEX is giving up full control of the board for this deal. What does that mean for the
future of the treasure hunting business and the Odyssey Explorer? Why would a Mexican
iron and coal miner (MINOSA) want to pursue historical shipwrecks that have never been
profitable investments? How much will OMEX have to lower costs under this new
leadership resulting in employee headcount reductions?


Understanding the dilution "Initial Closing" and "Subsequent Closings"


Management has repeatedly talked about how they will not raise equity or dilute existing
shareholders and have numerous "non-dilutive" transactions they can perform. This
transaction is as dilutive as we could have ever conceived, contemplating (if approved by
shareholders) issuing 188 Million new shares for an average price of $0.77 in addition to
the current 90 million (up from 86 million just 3 mos ago). This dilutes existing
shareholders to a mere 31% of the company! More alarmingly, these preferred shares that
will constitute 69% of the capital structure appear to be perpetual with an 8%
compounding liquidation preference which creates a continuously growing strain on the
publicly listed common shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3003186-odyssey-gives-up-control-for-distressed-loan-significantly-dilutes-potential-upside 7/22


While the majority of shareholders still have to approve the deal, this appears to handcuff
the Company from future actions and even in the (unlikely) event that Oceanica
materializes into a valuable project, that value will not materially accrue to common
shareholders.


Upside is severely capped with this deal even if short and long term hurdles are
overcome


Even if Oceanica overcomes the numerous impossible hurdles to become a viable
commercial project and in, say 3 years is valued at $500 million, the upside is limited.


Hypothetical extreme example: Oceanica worth $500 million in 3 years:


$500 million * 54% OMEX stake in project = $270mm


90mm + 188mm new shares = 278mm shares


=$0.97/share value


Note, we maintain that Oceanica is clearly worth $0 and has yet to even clear a SINGLE
hurdle towards becoming an economic project - the first issue being environmental
approval.


Oceanica Environmental Approval Faces New Challenges


In fact, just in recent weeks there has been an additional unexpected hurdle introduced to
the Oceanica project in Mexico. On March 4, it was reported that the project is located in
an area that SEMARNAT has earmarked as an environmentally protected zone for
endangered marine life, notably turtles. Shortly after this on March 13, it was reported that
a local politician has taken up the cause to assist the fishing coops to protect themselves
from the threats posed by the project.

Management grants MAKO 4,000,000 shares for no apparent consideration

The single most shocking thing about this deal that has already been finalized is the
disclosure that there has been an unexpected 4,000,000 shares of dilution. From the 8-K:


Termination of Mako Option Agreements


Mako Resources, LLC and OME are parties to two Unit Option Agreements (the
"Mako Option Agreements"), which were extended in December 2014, pursuant to
which Mako currently has the right to purchase an aggregate of six million of the
shares of Oceanica from OME. On March 11, 2015, Mako, OME, and the Company
entered into a termination agreement (the "Termination Agreement") pursuant to
which the Mako Option Agreements were terminated immediately prior to the
execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement by the parties thereto. In
consideration of the termination, the Company agreed to issue and deliver 4,000,000
shares of Common Stock to Mako.


Facts:


1) Mako's options originally expired Dec 2013 where only $2.5mm were exercised bringing
in a small amount of cash.


2) OMEX extended, for no consideration, those options while increasing the strike price to
Dec 2014.


3) Without disclosing anything to shareholders until now, the options expired Dec 31, 2014
without having been exercised.


4) OMEX - again for NO consideration - extended the options to Mako, presumably so
OMEX could continue to claim it as a "potential non-dilutive source of liquidity."


5) In order to consummate the deal with MINOSA, OMEX had to purchase the option for
4,000,000 shares that it has just granted for FREE to Mako months before!


Why did Mako just receive such a sweetheart deal at the expense of more dilution for
current shareholders?


Is this OMEX's Exit from the Shipwreck business?


The HMS Victory is back in limbo or worse for OMEX after the decision March 5th (still not
announced to shareholders by OMEX) that the MOD has reversed OMEX's permission to
begin work on the site. Will this apparent extra scrutiny result in OMEX paying the UK
government its $4.9mm shortfall from the Gairsoppa project? Why would a Mexican iron

and coal mining company want to invest its capital in treasure hunting ventures? Surely
with them controlling the board of OMEX after this deal, they would eliminate this part of
the business?


From a stock market perspective, OMEX is the only "pure play" treasure hunting /
shipwreck company on the market for those investors looking for such "exposure."
However - its transition into a focused junior mining company is considerably less unique
and not exactly a hot space lately. The only other pure-play undersea mining company
Chatham Rock just declined 90% after failing to receive environmental approval. The
junior mining space more broadly has suffered awful returns - JUNR a broad junior mining
ETF has declined roughly 70% in the last 2 years.


Is OMEX going to just become yet another junior mining stock?


Questions for conference call at 10am EST March 16, 2015


1) What happens now with the HMS Victory that the MOD reversed its decision in
November?


2) Is OMEX exiting the treasure hunting business?


3) The Odyssey Explorer does not appear to have moved for months on AIS - has the
crew been furloughed in order to save money?


4) Will Mark Gordon remain CEO under the new board controlled by MINOSA?


5) When is the next deadline with SEMARNAT for Oceanica?


6) Why has OMEX taken so many precautions in preparation for shareholder lawsuits
arising from this deal?

7) Why was there no quote from MINOSA in the press release Friday for this deal where
they will be taking control of OMEX?


8) Is the $10mm "Marketing Loan" from Monaco Financial LLC now in default because of
the HMS Victory rescinding of permission?


9) Are Monaco Financial's marketing rights granted to it as part of the $10mm loan
impaired by the Feb 3rd court ruling that overturned Ira Kane and reinstated CGMG's
marketing rights to the SS Central America?


10) What happened to the "non-dilutive" financing options that the CFO mentioned on the
last conference call?

It is possible that there is large short term upside due to short covering before the reverse split. Which should make
shorting very expensive?


16 Mar 2015, 09:53 AM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Actually the reverse split will be excellent for shorts as it will lower margin requirements.


16 Mar 2015, 10:18 AM


bulldog2014
Everything, post split, comes out in the wash more or less. Yes, once it reverse splits, it lowers margin
requirements; on the other hand, there are fewer shares to lend (the pref shares will not be trading), the
bid/ask spread will likely be wider, hence the transaction costs will be greater. All in all, I don't think the
reverse split makes much difference. All that matters is that a company moves forward operationally and
financially, post split (or pre split or at any time for that matter!)

There always has been, and continues to be, millions of shares that one can purchase short in OMEX.  
The lack of shares to lend short is typical blind approach used by the pumpers as a reason for a short
squeeze.


Currently, the only support is a potential for the 50 cent calls. As the Oceanica lynchpin continues to languish,
so will that support.


Currently, OMEX has been for years, and continues to be, a long squeeze.

I've not been active in this stock for a while, but I'm here to say good bye. The OMEX saga is now end game.


There were no real winners. The company essentially sold the store to continue as a going concern. Meson is correct
that there is now little upside to the stock, but conversely there's little downside either (reverse split keeps them on the
Nasdaq, deal with MINOSA keeps them out of bankruptcy, but loss of control and eroded value of Oceanica).


The company will not go out with a bang, nor will they will tear back with the ever purported short squeeze. The short
covering will be orderly, and some have already started......note the short interest is now down in the 17M share
range.

This saga has been like a bad TV show that scrapped and clawed and made it into it's second season, and is now
airing a boring conclusion to move on into re-runs. Sure there have been some die hard fans made along the way
(rather than trekkies, we can call them omexies).


The shorts really didn't make much money, and longs and traders on the dips only made a few shekels here and there
along the way, and some on both sides lost money.


Regardless of what little money I made (and it was so little it really isn't worth mentioning), the important take-away is
that we have wasted 2 years of our lives watching this saga play out ......... and that's two years that I can't get back.


I used to have fun watching OMEX and all the exciting things they were trying to do (and in some cases succeeded).
But it's not fun anymore. All we saw was a fight on the schoolyard between a short bully and a kid who was trying sell
kool aide on the corner. The short Bully beat him up, and a bigger more financially secure kid bought his kool aide
stand and said, I own the kool aide stand now, but you can continue to work for me.......you don't have to worry about
the short bully any more. I watched the fight wanting to see an exciting Rocky and Apollo Creed event, and frankly, it
just left me wanting.


Friends, this fight is over, and it just was not worth wasting the time to watch anymore. There is no money left for
shorts to make if they haven't already made it, and the company has a long way to go to give long investors any
alpha.


With that said.......Keep Seeking Alpha (Elsewhere)......Shipb... 1 signing off!!

You can say there were no winners but with the stock down more than 80% since Meson exposed it, I think
it's pretty clear Ryan Morris won and you lost. If I lost as badly as you did I would probably also want to sweep
it under the rug and say no one won, but the math doesn't lie. Be a man and admit that you got owned.

The short sellers ran this company into the ground in an open example of the damage they can cause. But
now bankruptcy is no longer a consideration. So while the shorts have nice paper profits, there is still that little
problem of covering. The reason for the 6-1 reverse split is to keep the company listed on NASDAQ. This
says MINOSA plans to operate it as a separate entity. It doesn't bother me to have a partner with deep
pockets. If MINOSA says the stock is worth $1 per share, why sell here?

I personally can't wait for the split. I think it will increase liquidity and make the stock much easier to short. A
$50 million market overvalues this company by at least $50 million but it's hard to short a $0.56 (52 week
low!) stock in size. When the pps is 6x bigger it will be time to back up the truck for the short.


... no, make that two trucks.

Why do you feel BK is no longer a consideration? All of the financing is predicated on Oceanica approval.
What happens to this entire deal if it is rejected?


Currently, they were given $2M up front, that is a month of operations expenses. What about the short term
debt, and the $7M 5th 3rd loan due in May? If the approval for Oceanica has not happened by May, how will
the 5th 3rd loan be paid? Note in the conditions that the deal is void if there are legal proceedings?


The reverse split you talk about, why is that required if the Company is doing so well, or is expected to do
something to bring the shareprice up?

Brilliant investment strategy. Double the shares and split it by 6.


 
What you dont seem to comprehend is that the deal did not provide any value. It provided some cash, but
absolutely nothing in the operation changed. Nothing was added except shareholder dilution.


Its a paper move, nothing more. Little to no value, doesnt matter how many times you divide it or multiply it, it
remains little to no value.

Ikarus,


I have always been careful investing in this stock. I knew the risks. I didn't make much money, only a few thousand
dollars, which I was hoping to make more. But no loss. I hold no animosity toward Meson, or anyone else who invests
in speculative stocks. I made a lot of money on it in 2007, when they brought up the Black Swan treasure. I sold my
holding then on a 4 bagger. But there is no argument that Meson holds the title (at least in this timeframe). You can't
argue the fact that the stock price dropped because of OMEX's bad metrics.


I don't cry over spilled milk. As an investor, I just move on. OMEX's day in the sun may come again one day, but it
won't be soon, so I'll go where other more timely opportunities lie.


Ship.......Really signing off this time

Nothing has changed. The Victory is everything. If these shorts don't cover before the Victory yields its half-billion in
300-year-old gold coins, the upside will still be double-digits.

You "maintain that Oceanica is clearly worth $0" yet insinuate that they gave up too much by agreeing to a one year
call option for "only" $40M?

They were given another $6 million today fwiw.


16 Mar 2015, 06:19 PM


26922203
You allude to them being 'given' monies, that does not surprise me that you think they simply are given
money. 
Where is the foundation for your remark?  
They were provided with $2M LOAN on closing, and are scheduled, per the agreement, to get an additional
$4M LOAN on March 31.


Where is 5th 3rd?

a reverse split reduces the liquidity and widens the bid/ask bid. Wait until you see the increase in your borrow cost.

This company has entered a death spiral. Even though, bankruptcy before the summer has been avoided, it doesn't
change the endgame for this company. Any short covering rally should be used to sell your position. Even if Oceania
could grow into its valuation over the next few years, OMEX shareholders won't be able to participate in the upside
due to dilution. But if OMEX continues to burn through its cash - which is the most likely scenario - it will lose its
ownership of Oceania and will collapse as the shipwreck business won't be able to sustain itself. From a risk-reward
perspective, it is clearly a heads-I-win-very-little and tails-I-lose-everything scenario.

Or you could phrase it as: 
It is clearly a heads-I-win-very-little and tails-I-lose-everything (which is very little at 50 cents) scenario.

It depends on your average purchase price. If you're long, you could still have a 100% capital loss, which is
considerable if you recently bought the stock. Regardless, there is no reason to hold on to it.


17 Mar 2015, 06:10 AM


ikarus
100% loss of "almost nothing" is still 100% loss.


I don't know what it is about people who own this stock, it's like they are willfully delusional. Or maybe they
work for the company. I'm sure many here will be believers all the way to zero and then blame the shorts
when their investment evaporates.

Brinker still has 12.8M shares at around $2.50, bet they are so happy with their pref share offering. 
How about Monaco, look how they got trashed.


I see little ability to pay the $7M owed to 5th 3rd in May. That will trigger the rest.


Again, by Friday, the 50 cent strike price may not be something to look forward to.

DeBeers has underwater mines. Last i checked they were on this planet.


17 Mar 2015, 09:31 PM


26922203
DeBeers is beach mining, not underwater.


You ended up Monday in disbelief because with all of the blind pumping, you do not have the ability to see that this is
still the same old Odyssey, and even more in debt. 
Did you realize that there are 2 new subsidiaries created for this financing, and that the financing is through one of
them? The monies did not go to Odyssey Marine Exploration, but to Odyssey Marine Enterprises. There is also now
Odyssey Marine Holdings to deal with. 
The financing is all based on SEMARNAT approval of Oceanica, AND Odyssey remaining VIABLE. My definition of
viable is not living from loan to loan, with the shareprice at 52 week lows. It is very likely that the 50 cent strike price
will not be attractive by the end of this week. 
The $2M up front isnt even a month worth of expenses, and the $14+M loan doesn't cover short term debt and loans,
let alone business operations. 
As noted from the 10-K, they sold off the conservation lab, and it appears that $300K was their only revenue.


Will the shareholders actually vote to split the stock and hold the Directors harmless against lawsuits (and the
Company actually pay their legal fees if they are sued)? That is inconceivable that the Directors would even try to re-
write the bylaws to protect themselves from their decisions, at shareholder expense.


It is unlikely that the Central America will be monetized in 2015. Appellate Court decision is but one of the issues.
Thompson is back, and that brings back to life some of the legal activities. 
The Victory is a liability, where they will spend money and time working for a day rate. They spent months on that site
and there was no indication of anything but cannon and a few trinkets. Odyssey still refuses to provide the
documentation that is the foundation of their 'research', and now, as we have seen from the questions asked as part
of the judicial review, the ability to sell artifacts will never be approved. 
Commodity wrecks. I found it laughable for Gordon to even bother to mention that. For 3 years now, he has claimed to
be working these wrecks, and really, German blockade runners? 
The icing was the SMS deposits, and bringing up Neptune. I see no indication that Company is viable, nor that there
is any expertise in locating or mining SMS deposits. There are real companies in this business with robotic deep sea
recovery machines already in operation, there is little need for an ex-cable layer with a vacuum attached.

If news are so bad, ¿how come shorts are rushing to cover? See volume


18 Mar 2015, 12:35 PM


Mayflower Capital Partners
Because some short sellers have been short from much higher levels. If you have been short when the stock was $3,
it might not be worth waiting for the potential $0.55 decline in terms of additional return. It is a different story for a
short seller who recently entered the position. So far, short covering rallies have been sold into by regular
shareholders. And longs who count on a major short covering rally to make them whole, could be severely
dissapointed, as most companies, ranging from Radioshack to Walter Energy, that were about to collapse had high
short interest until the bitter end.


18 Mar 2015, 12:46 PM


Bill Houseman, Contributor
It seems the shorts were correct that OMEX was running low on cash. But they vastly underestimated the value of
Oceanica. I'm sure the entry of a stable Mexican company was a great surprise to everyone. Management has sold
them the company and it was the right thing to do. It remains to be seen how ownership will eventually be structured,
but there are lots of potential advantages to US stockholders, and none for the shorts. Bankruptcy is off the table now.
The development of Oceanica is underway. Also, now there is time for SSCA to be monetized and HMS Victory to be
salvaged.

As the Central America monetization slips off into the sunset, virtually everyone realizes that they will not cover
expenses and associated loans based on the recovery. The Victory may be recovered, but it will be a loss leader with
the slim chance of being paid a day rate. Nothing will be allowed to be sold. Lingfeld stated it, Odyssey is working pro-
bono for archaeological reasons. You should believe him. 
There are a few issues, such as the potential to repay the UK Govt the $4.9M, and the 5th 3rd loan that is due, both of
which, could bring all of this down hard.


In reality, with the aged ship and equipment, combined with a lack of realization of profit from treasure hunting,
Oceanica WAS all they had left.


The value of Oceanica has now been set. Given the hefty pricetag in terms of loss of control, and the $100M
valuation, wouldn't even you agree that it has been grossly overvalued?

I doubt Bill could ever admit he's been wrong. After all, he is the guy who kept telling everyone "the floor is in
at $2.00." I'm not sure he even understands basic math (you can't if you are long this stock at any price).


19 Mar 2015, 05:35 PM

Ik 
I admit I was wrong about the stock price levelling off at $2. I underestimated the effectiveness of the negative
campaign by the shorts against the company. I just did not think anyone would believe it.


It will be instructive watching the shorts trying to exit their position now. Stock is up 30% in the past three
days. You guys surely better get out before Penelope takes OMEX private.

RM this is a direct quote from your summary:


"MINOSA received a call option to purchase all of OMEX’s Oceanica stake for $40mm which it could exercise
tomorrow if it wanted."


If they could for that price they would. That option is operative only if the shareholders reject the Reverse Split. An
apology would be in order which you won't provide. R ya riding yr bike in Canada now?

Shareholders do not have to vote on the reverse split.


"A company’s board of directors may declare a reverse stock split without shareholder approval. Although the SEC
has authority over a broad range of corporate activity, state corporate law and a company’s articles of incorporation
and by-laws govern reverse stock splits."


Shareholders are voting on changing the bylaws to indemnify management from shareholder lawsuits, and to vote on
the deal, not a stock split.

Clarification to my comment on the reverse split. While it does not have to be voted on, it is part of the proxy as it is a
condition to close the investment.


From the Form of Voting Agreement:


"B. A condition to closing the Investment is the amendment of the Company’s existing Articles of Incorporation to (i)
effect a 1-for-6 reverse stock split, (ii) adjust the Company’s authorized capitalization, (iii) establish a classified board
of directors, and (iv) reflect such other amendments as may be necessary to consummate the Investment (the
“Charter Amendments”)."
