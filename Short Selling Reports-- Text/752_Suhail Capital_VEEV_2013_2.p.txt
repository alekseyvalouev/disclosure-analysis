Our Favorite Misleading, Factually Inaccurate, And Utterly Illogical
Statements From Veeva's Underwriters' Initiation Reports

"Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it." - George Costanza


Our journey into the land of believing......


(Note that we spared the co-lead underwriters here as their contributions are covered in
our report).


"We believe that there are more than 450,000 pharmaceutical sales reps worldwide
that could benefit from using their products. Additionally, we think most
pharmaceutical companies spend $5,000-10,000 per year on front-office software for
its sales reps. Adjusting down for emerging markets, we are assuming the low end
of the ASP range to get an average ASP of $5,000 per rep, per year. Multiplying this
by 450,000 sales reps, that works out to approximately $2.0-2.5 billion in available
software spend. This applies only to the company's CRM products and does not
factor in any content management or MDM."- Wells Fargo, Veeva, pg10


Verdict: Extremely Poor Assumption/Grossly Negligent


Cegedim's (OTC:CGMJF) 140k Life Sciences CRM users at $5,000 per seat would work
out to $700 million in CRM revenue. They did about $250 million in CRM revenue over the
past twelve months. Veeva's (NYSE:VEEV) estimated avg Q2 crm user count by our
calculation was 110k. Q2 Sub revenues of $34 million annualized and divided by the
average rep count works out to $1236 annual asp per seat. If all professional services
revenue are included, we were able to get to $1800. Note that the only way to get close to
this wildly inaccurate $5k ASP number is if we use Cegedim's entire CRM/SD division
revenue number of $657 million. A $10k asp would mean $800 plus a seat per month. Are
we writing science fiction here or sell-side research? Better question, is there a difference
between the two anymore?


"Cegedim generated greater than $550 million in revenue in 2012." -Wells Fargo,
pg21


Verdict: Bizzaro

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1877221-our-favorite-misleading-factually-inaccurate-and-utterly-illogical-statements-from-veevas-underwriters-initiation-reports


Cegedim is a public company. The company's 2012 revenues are on its corporate
website, Bloomberg, Factset, and countless other financial information providers. The
exact figure for 2012 is $1.23 billion. Would I say Apple did more than $70 billion over the
last year when I know it did $170 billion? Would we say Ted Williams hit over the Mendoza
line in 1941, when he batted .406? This number is off by 55%. The entire paragraph
preceding it was cut and pasted from Cegedim's website 'about' section. This was clearly
the only sentence added by the research analyst. We simply could make absolutely no
sense out of it. We only highlight it here because it is just another example of
carelessness and/or incompetence. If this analyst had no time to pull the correct numbers
from the website, do you think he or anyone else at his firm actually bothered calling
around to have detailed conversations with management teams regarding their
assumptions? Well, we already know the answer to that question because we had the
necessary conversations.


"Roughly half of the CRM addressable opportunity is derived from full penetration of
base subscription fees, and the balance is the development and maturation of 15-20
other add-on applications, which could double monthly ASPs."-Canaccord Genuity,
Veeva, pg 10


Verdict:Factually Inaccurate and Illogical


Canaccord dubbed this as its 'conservative' bottoms-up estimate for how it got to $2 billion
CRM TAM. On a 450k global rep count, this works out to a base ASP of $2200 per year.
At the audited 403k count we used, it works out to $2500 (btw - Veeva's own internal
estimates as disclosed to the underwriters, thank you Stifel, put the rep count at 400k). As
we have shown, Veeva is likely at a base closer to $1200. Since their disclosure to the
SEC states they recognized no Veeva Approved Email revenue in the six months ended
July 31, 2013, you can view Irep, which we deem as their core functionality versus an 'add
on', as nearly every customer opts for it on top of core crm(ie. white labeled
salesforce.com), as that base solution/flagship product. Again we have math on Veeva
that is off by 50% and supported by comparable Cegedim analysis. Due to the fact that
Cegedim and Veeva control 66% of the total LS CRM seats, we are extremely confident in
our analysis. We also 'believe' that LS industry trends with respect to layoffs and patent
expirations strongly contradict any assumption regarding pricing power in crm, let alone
doubling asp's.

"We fundamentally believe Veeva offers a noticeable advantage in terms of both cost
savings and functionality versus its key competitors, and we believe these factors will
continue to sustain the company's growth for the next several years." Stifel, Veeva, pg 3


Followed by this three pages later:


"We believe the transformational nature of Veeva's CRM solution is not accurately
captured within market assessments that fail to incorporate the growth and revenue
potential of solutions such as iRep and Approved Email. These relatively new
features are pushing the annual subscription dollars per sales representative past
the levels that Siebel and Cegedim have historically seen."Stifel, pg 6


Verdict: Direct Contradiction and Factually Inaccurate


If Veeva is cheaper than its competitors how is it realizing annual revenue per seat that
exceeds what it has historically seen? Is Stifel making an on-premise comparison which
has no subscription revenue and is license/maintenance revenue, isn't that really
misleading? Cegedim's average sub dollar per seat is higher. We repeat, as per Veeva's
disclosure to the SEC, Veeva Approved Email recognized no revenue in the six months
ended July 31, 2013. If no revenue was recognized, shouldn't Stifel have used the future
tense with regards to its revenue impact?


"Although we believe the company has had some successes, we mostly view
Cegedim as a "number three" vendor within the marketplace, given its continued
insistence on a legacy selling and delivery model, as well as its lack of muscle
compared to Oracle." Stifel, Veeva, pg27


Verdict:Factually Inaccurate


Has had some success? Cegedim owns 36% global crm ls market share and the
undisputed leading global HCP database. On Demand, single or multi-tenant, is 70%+ of
CRM. Reading such shoddy analysis/research when you conduct extensive work on
something simply makes you think you are delusional.

"Veeva's offerings not only replace the software market, but also the hardware and
ser- vices used to support those software offerings. So, Veeva's opportunity could be
1x to 2x its software TAM. All TAM estimates are based on the company's current
market of life sciences companies, but Veeva could expand further into adjacent
markets, such as medical equipment and medical devices."Pacific Crest, Veeva, pg
10


Verdict: Factually Inaccurate and Unbelievably Stupid


The on-premise infrastructure/services being displaced by moving to the cloud are hosted
in 3rd party data centers and provided by platform providers like Salesforce.com's
(NYSE:CRM) Force.com platform as well as Chatter functionality. A SAAS can provide
software at a 40% discount to on premise because these scale players (PAAS and IAAS)
have driven down the cost of infrastructure. This is a cost of goods sold for Veeva and not
a revenue opportunity. Furthermore, SAAS substitution eliminates multiple dollars in
legacy IT spend, thus the overall pie shrinks as SAAS share grows. Also, Veeva is
precluded by contract with their platform CRM provider, Salesforce.com, from expanding
into the medical device market or even selling their software to the non-pharma sales
divisions of life sciences companies.


We hope you enjoyed this brief journey into the land of make believe. Suffice to say, we
believe these initiations should all be suspended and some actual 'research' performed
here before anything else is published on the name.


Disclosure: I am short VEEV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

In my opinion, the VEEV-covering analysts from Wells Fargo, Stifel, Canaccord, Pacific Crest, etc. have at the very
least exhibited utter incompetency. Perhaps more likely, these sell-side analysts and their superiors have perpetrated
outright fraud on investors who participated in the i.p.o. and following the offering. If I had a long position in VEEV, I'd
be more than a little pissed off right now.


I believe that the SEC needs to get involved with this mess asap. What a textbook example of why the average
individual and small RIA does not and SHOULD NOT trust Wall Street.

It is nothing more than wall street distribution. The way these firms sell it now... is outright fraud. The SEC will
sometimes fine and slap wrists, but where does that money go ?  
Look at the Facebook IPO.... that is where the General investing public is....at a huge disadvantage and an outlet
(distribution)  
for the hedgers and mutual funds. This market is about to crash .. 
how soon I just don't know but I think we are looking at a 9500 area.

Ummm. The sell side is oblivious. Whoda thunk. I used to work there and I agree with you completely. But that is not a
great reason to short a stock. But go ahead and vent if it makes you feel better. Cheers.

Great Research on VEEV. I saw that SUHAIL CAPITAL is regarded highly on VEEV Yahoo Message Board. Your
firm's name has come up numerous times in the last day and I cannot help but agree with all the accolades directed
toward SUHAIL CAPITAL. A month long research, 16 pages, very impressive!:)

It does seem very odd that the company's own projections for the 4thQ show essentially zero bottomline growth and a
very small amount of top line growth QoQ.


That rate of growth would be woefully insufficient to maintain the company's current valuation in our opinion...


06 Dec 2013, 09:51 AM


Han So Low
It doesn't seem very odd when you consider that they provided the numbers for YoY, not QoQ. They did give the
typical "seasonality" explanation for no QoQ growth which makes me suspicious.


Veeva is providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 as follows:  
• Total revenues between $57 and $58 million, an increase of 43% to 46% on a year-over-year basis. This implies full
fiscal year revenues of approximately $204 to $205 million representing annual growth of 58% to 59%.

Canaccord? Stifel? Does anyone even pay attention to these clowns? Actually I suppose you could say that for all of
em. Can't wait til the crash and then they get sued and we'll see the behind the scenes emails showing what they
really thought of these POS companies

"We are just up 35% on cegedim, 20% on veev, 25% on crm, and 30% on cnqr."

Aren't writers supposed to disclose their positions? Suhail states that he is long on CRM and CGMJF. In the articles
linked below, he writes about CRM and CGMJF but only disclosed his short position: VEEV.
