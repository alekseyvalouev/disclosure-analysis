ParkerVision Still Tremendously Overvalued

Summary


ParkerVision's loss of JMOL on infringement an enormous blow.


ParkerVision stock now essentially worthless.


$0.25 per share price target based on option value.


On June 20th, Judge Dalton issued an order on the Post Trial Motions in the ParkerVision
(NASDAQ:PRKR) vs. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) hearing. As part of these post trial
motions, he GRANTED Qualcomm's motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL) for a
new trial regarding non-infringement. In doing so, Judge Dalton stripped ParkerVision of
the jury award and royalty rate they had been awarded. While this devastating news
caused a precipitous drop in ParkerVision's stock, we believe that the stock is still
tremendously overvalued.


At last night's closing price of $1.85 and 98.5 million shares outstanding, ParkerVision
carries a market capitalization of $182 million. While this is significantly less than
ParkerVision's prior market capitalization of approximately $500 million, there is now
nothing to support the current market capitalization. The company produces no revenue
and despite hiring 3LP over 18 months ago to work on licensing deals, none have been
signed. Furthermore, the likelihood of a licensing deal being signed is now extremely low
because ParkerVision just lost whatever leverage they may have had in negotiations as a
result of Judge Dalton tossing the first case and the IPRs being filed.


We believe that the only reason ParkerVision stock still trades above $1 is a large
fundamental misunderstanding by shareholders. This misunderstanding is highlighted in
ParkerVision's press release when they state:


While we are pleased that the court upheld the jury's decision that the patents are
valid, we are obviously disappointed with the District Court's ruling that judgment be
entered for Qualcomm on non-infringement.

To be clear, the Judge did NOT find the patents valid. He simply found insufficient
evidence to find them invalid. If you read the IPRs that were filed by Mike Farmwald and
RPX and discussed within this SeekingAlpha article (HERE), you will quickly realize that
the validity of these patents is highly questionable given the vast amount of prior art that
an expert in the field of RF found. The large amount of prior art should lead to the PTAB
determining that the patents are invalid. Even if the patents are ultimately found to be
valid, we see no value in a valid patent that no one infringes, which is the current status
following the JMOL from Judge Dalton.


Shareholders seem to view the lawsuit against Qualcomm and HTC (OTC:HTCCY) as
another source of potential value. The first thing worth noting about this lawsuit is that
ParkerVision has not served Qualcomm or HTC yet. There are two ways that we know this
lawsuit has not been served. First, when we look at the first lawsuit, there is a certificate of
service, but there is no certificate on the second lawsuit. Second, neither Qualcomm nor
HTC have responded. Qualcomm and HTC need to respond to a lawsuit in 21 days, but
that 21 days starts from the day they are served, so the lack of a response means that
they have not been served. Even if Qualcomm and HTC do eventually get served, this
new lawsuit is years away from being tried as Qualcomm and HTC will likely file IPRs
against these patents. Keep in mind that ParkerVision is now filing a lawsuit on their
second string patents. They would clearly use their best patents on the first case, so the
patents in this new lawsuit were not even worth asserting in the first case. If Qualcomm
wins the IPRs it is likely to file, then the lawsuit will be dismissed. Furthermore,
ParkerVision will find it difficult to use the inflammatory emails from Qualcomm in the
second lawsuit, because ParkerVision previously said these emails were about the energy
sampling patents. It will now be impractical and lacking in credibility to claim the emails
are about different patents. We find it hard to believe that a judge will allow this.


Bulls also seem to be misunderstanding the fact that an appeal could be devastating to
ParkerVision. If ParkerVision appeals, Qualcomm gets to cross appeal. Therefore, it is
possible ParkerVision ends up worse on appeal. This is because the Federal Circuit could
find the patents invalid on appeal, especially with the IPRs in process. The Federal Circuit
could also decide to toss the Markman. Therefore, an appeal is not a one-sided event
where ParkerVision can only emerge victorious. In fact, ParkerVision risks losing a lot on
an appeal.


The only thing that may be certain about the future for ParkerVision shareholders is that
they will face further dilution. ParkerVision ended last quarter with $25.3 million in cash.
They currently burn about $4 million in cash a quarter, but the cash burn is likely to rise as

they appeal the first lawsuit, fight the IPRs, and defend themselves in the MaxTak lawsuit.
The cash burn will further increase if ParkerVision ever serves Qualcomm and HTC to
begin the second lawsuit. This means that ParkerVision has only a few more quarters
before they need to raise capital again.


There is simply nothing concrete about ParkerVision that can justify a market cap of $182
million. In fact, we thought the stock was only worth a little over $200 million if Judge
Dalton had found for ParkerVision in these JMOLs and ParkerVision won the appeals.
Given this ruling from Judge Dalton, we believe ParkerVision stock should be valued at no
more than $0.25 per share, which represents the option value that something good might
happen in the future or that other gullible investors might be found. We cannot use normal
valuation metrics such as revenue, earnings or EBITDA, or revenue because ParkerVision
either has none or it is a negative. Therefore, the best we can do is estimate what hope is
worth. Unfortunately, ParkerVision has never delivered on this hope in their over 20 years
as a publicly traded company.

Great succinct summary of where things sit. I wasn't sure why PRKR isn't below $1 already but a quick read of the
Yahoo message board provided some insight...

Author’s reply »  Quoth the Raven and I disagreed on CLSN, but we appear to agree on PRKR. My guess is
that we're both interested in controversial stocks because being right on them allows for large profits. FWIW,
CLSN has been a complete dog since I began publishing on it.

I certainly hope you're right about the CAFC invalidating the patents.


I'm still proceeding on the recently filed IPR petitions - yesterday's ruling hasn't affected my desire to invalidate the
PRKR patents. It's not very likely that the PTAB would invalidate them before the CAFC could reach a decision on the
upcoming ParkerVision appeal - 18 months for the PTAB decision on the IPRs vs. probably 12-15 months for an
appeal to the CAFC.


I agree this it is *far* more likely that ParkerVision ends up worse off from the appeal than that they win.

Does anyone feel Kevin Rivette has a chance to bring $$$$ to PRKR prior to appeal process being finalized.
My guess is no but wondering if anyone has an opinion.


24 Jun 2014, 11:18 AM


Mike Farmwald, Contributor
No one will license ParkerVision "technology" until there is finality on both the CAFC appeal and the IPRs.


Why bother, unless the cost is zero (or less than zero, e.g. ParkerVision is paying Via Telcomm quite a lot to
remain a "customer"?)


The threat of a lawsuit against another (non-Qualcomm) party is pretty empty, as it would almost surely be
stayed pending the results of the IPRs, and would likely result in the filing of additional IPRs.


ParkerVision has no ability to materially assist other companies, no technology to offer that is not already well
known, and the existing patents are, almost surely, invalid. ParkerVision have proven repeatedly that they are
incapable of doing worthwhile chip design.


D2D is a very old idea (and the patents are invalid), and D2P simply doesn't work.


There is no reason to want to work with ParkerVision (unless PRKR pays you!)

Great points Mike. Either you or Alpha Exposure also made another great point recently that deserves to be
highlighted - we have seen how Parkervision treats companies that engage in good faith negotiations - it
comes back years later and sues them. That alone may make potential licensees of PRKR's 200 or so (so far
utterly commercially useless) patents very wary of even taking a meeting.


Great to see your work continue to be vindicated on this file.

If one is a PRKR follower things indeed look a lot worse. I was surprised that the Judge overturned the jury's verdict
but he did so about the best that I can see happening is a new trial. As to the IPR's those are probably all smoke as
Farmwald and Qualcomm didn't think the judge would overturn the verdict either.

Mike Farmwald, Contributor
> As to the IPR's those are probably all smoke


You might want to actually read the filed IPRs.


I assure they are not smoke. I believe they have a *very* high likelihood of invalidating all of the asserted
claims.

Paul: I think there is a perception out there among shareholders that because these IPRs were filed by Mike,
they should be overlooked. This is a very dangerous attitude to take. Mike did not write the IPRs, an expert in
RF did. This expert in RF was able to find substantial prior art that jumps off the page if your read the IPRs.
Finally, its important to note that Mike filed these not by himself but in conjunction with RPX. I think
shareholders have the perception that these IPRs are something Mike did on his own and wrote on his own
when that is far from the truth.

Great points silence_twain. People unfamiliar with RPX should really check them out - kind of like the
Goldman Sachs of the patent world (in a good way, not a clients-are-muppets way).

A jury found in PRKR Favor. PRKR will definitely appeal the judges opinion. In the mean time shorts are buying calls
and covering stock and screaming to stockholders to sell their stock. The shorts made a killing. PRKR will be a good
speculation, but I am keeping it small for now.

Sorry I don't use margin. When everyone is selling someone has to buy. I'm happy to provide a liquidity

I second Justin here, with this recent setback and all the negative publicity the shorts are having a field day
now. But I think its going to go back up. I am selling 50 contracts of the $2 cash secured July put for a .49
premium , if I get assigned I will turn around and sell the $2 covered call.


I am also buying 100 contracts of the January 2015 $5 call for $.10


I am long this one , lets see what the future brings :)

Just for fun I plotted PRKR's share count against the Fed's balance sheet. Nearly perfect correlation:

I expect a divergence soon though, as the Fed's QE winds down and no PRKR share count taper in sight.

DSS, VRNG, and PRKR are all garbage companies and stocks. All they do is go around and sue people. These co's
are made up of a bunch of fat cat lawyers wearing expensive suits. The market has figured these companies out and
so has the average investor. No one is interested in these co's anymore. Just look at their lackluster stock prices. Too
many good co's out there with actual products and services to invest in, than to invest in co's like these three. Have a
good day everyone.

Thank you to the author for his/her valuable contribution as a reliable contraindicator.


I learned a lesson about the stock market a few years ago, it's a big secret on Wall Street, but I'll let you in on it. When
going long, buy low and sell high. When going short, sell high and buy low.


Releasing an article advocating going short after a stock has just lost 80%+ of its value on a panic sell-off did provide
for some comic relief.
