Why I'm Again Short Lumber Liquidators
Mar. 9, 2016 1:55 PM ET101 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


After being very publicly short Lumber Liquidators’ stock for 26 months, during which
it fell by nearly 90%, I exited the position in December. At the time, I had no
expectation of shorting the stock again, yet in the past week I reestablished a
meaningful (~4%) short position in the stock.


Yesterday, I gave a 48-slide presentation explaining the reasons why. I believe the
odds of very bad outcomes for Lumber Liquidators and its stock have risen
materially based on new information in six areas.


Most importantly, my best source tells me that the recent cancer scare associated
with the toxic, formaldehyde-laden Chinese-made laminate flooring that Lumber
Liquidators sold for years is having a devastating impact on the business.


The company was already in a precarious situation, so I question whether it can
withstand this new blow. I now believe that there is at least a 50% chance that
Lumber Liquidators eventually goes bankrupt.


The most likely scenario for the stock, I believe, is that it drops to ~$8 after Q1
earnings late next month, when I expect the company to acknowledge that its
business has weakened further; then, I think the stock will continue to fall over the
course of the year as the business remains crippled, and approaches zero within a
year.


If you have information that either confirms or is contrary to mine, I’d love to hear
from you at WTilson@kasecapital.com.


Overview


In a 48-slide presentation at an investment conference yesterday, I revealed why I'm once
again short the stock of Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL). While it may seem odd to
reestablish this position at a lower (i.e., less attractive) price than when I covered, I
changed my mind because I have new information that leads me to believe that the odds
of very bad outcomes for Lumber Liquidators and its stock have risen materially based on
new information in six areas:

1) Widespread media coverage of the CDC's error and increased cancer risk appears to
be having a severe impact on the business


2) The cancer risk is likely significantly greater than even the CDC's revised estimate,
which could result in further damaging publicity and increased liabilities


3) A "Prop 65" trial has just begun that LL is likely to lose, resulting in further adverse
publicity


4) Likelihood of even larger legal and regulatory liabilities


5) Operating performance of the business in Q4 was much worse than I expected - and I
think meaningful improvement is unlikely for quite some time (if ever)


6) Lack of confidence in company leadership


Below I summarize the highlights. For those interested in the details, here is further
information:

Background


From late 2013 through last December, Lumber Liquidators was one of my most
successful investments in my 17-plus year investing career. During this 26-month period,
when it was my largest short position, the stock crashed from $115 at the time I first went
public with my short thesis at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in November 2013 to
around $14 when I covered.


I'm proud of the role I played in bringing to light the company's misdeeds, namely sourcing
and selling illegally harvested hardwood and toxic formaldehyde-drenched laminate
flooring. What happened to Lumber Liquidators (being the subject of a devastating 60
Minutes story, followed by well over 100 lawsuits and a half dozen investigations by
various regulators - and, of course, the collapse of its share price) has, I believe, not only

led the company, but the entire industry, to adopt more stringent compliance measures.
I'm especially proud of this recent story: A Hedge Fund Manager Helped Save Siberian
Tigers. Here's an excerpt:


But the best thing about this case is that it will slow the rate of deforestation in the
critical habitat of the Russian Far East. So next time you see a wild Siberian tiger in
a photo or on television, spare a kind thought - unlikely as it may sound - for a hedge
fund manager. Tilson has moved on to other stocks. But I'm betting that this case will
keep both him and Zhou on the lookout for bad environmental practices as one more
clue to stocks worth shorting.


Why I Covered


I published an article in December explaining why I was exiting my short position. Here's
the summary:


In the past week, I've received information that leads me to believe that senior
management of Lumber Liquidators wasn't aware that the company was selling
Chinese-made laminate that had high levels of formaldehyde.
If this information is correct, then the company was sloppy and naïve, but not evil.
If there are no "smoking gun" documents/emails, then the doomsday scenario for the
company (and the stock) is less likely, so I covered my short position today.


I continue to believe that Lumber Liquidators' senior management was unaware of the
toxic laminate and thus no longer believes this company is evil, plus the stock is now a bit
lower. In addition, the company had $6.7 million of net cash and $67.2 million available on
its line of credit at the end of Q4, and, under normal circumstances, this is a nicely
profitable business.


Nevertheless, I believe the stock is a great short today because I now believe that there is
at least a 50% chance that Lumber Liquidators eventually goes bankrupt for the following
reasons:


1) I think operating losses and cash burn will remain severely negative (in the range of
Q4's -$20-$30 million per quarter) for the foreseeable future - and could even get worse


2) It will likely be very difficult and expensive to settle the regulatory issues (Consumer
Product Safety Commission, CA Air Resources Board, etc.) as well as class action (multi-
district litigation), securities fraud, and Prop 65 cases, especially in light of the CDC

recently tripling its exposure and cancer risk estimate, as well as the fact that more than
one million Americans may have been exposed to Lumber Liquidators' Chinese- made
laminate since 2010


3) Lumber Liquidators' liability insurers have all denied coverage for the formaldehyde
claims under the pollution exclusion in the insurance policies, forcing the company to pay
its enormous legal fees out of pocket


More Than One Million Americans May Have Been Exposed to Lumber Liquidators'
Chinese-Made Laminate Between 2010 and May 7, 2015


It's hard to know when Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate first became toxic
(maybe it always was?), but forced to guess, let's go with 2010. If so, I estimate that
Lumber Liquidators sold this product to ~400,000 households, thereby exposing over one
million Americans, as this table shows:


Assumptions/estimates:


LL finally suspended sales of Chinese-made laminate on May 7, 2015
For 2012 and 2013, laminate sales and percent from China are estimates
Average Ticket (Laminate) is an estimate based on 80% of the total ticket (laminate is
cheaper than engineered and solid hardwoods)
People exposed is customers x 2.54 residents per household (US Census)
January - May 7, 2015 assumes that sales continued at 2014 levels in January and
February and then fell by half after the 60 Minutes story aired on March 1, 2015


In other words, this isn't a small problem - it's a huge one.


Severe Impact of Recent Publicity About a Cancer Scare


I now believe that Lumber Liquidators' sales will not recover in the first half of the year,
possibly longer, due to a recent well-publicized cancer scare that, according to my
sources, has had a hugely deleterious impact on Lumber Liquidators - possibly even
exceeding what happened in the aftermath of the initial 60 Minutes story a year ago.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3956950-short-lumber-liquidators 5/32


As we've seen over the past year, adverse publicity linking a Lumber Liquidators' product
to formaldehyde has severely damaged the business - but, let's be honest, while exposure
to this chemical sounds sort of scary, most people don't know much about it. And to the
extent they do, the primary symptoms - irritation of the eyes, nose and throat - don't sound
like cause for alarm. But everyone knows about - and is rightly terrified of - cancer. Thus, a
Lumber Liquidators' product (even one it no longer sells) becoming very publicly
associated with increased cancer risk could be a mortal blow to the company.


Here's how it happened:


Last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the results of
the Consumer Product Safety Commission's tests of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made
laminate flooring, and it was mostly good news for the company. Though it found elevated
levels of formaldehyde, in its conclusions the CDC seemed to be trying to downplay the
risks and calm homeowners. While acknowledging that "The amount of formaldehyde
released could cause health symptoms in some people," the media focused on this line:
"The added cancer risk from exposure to formaldehyde released from the floorboards is
small."


Importantly (and, I believe, wrongly - see below), the CDC assured homeowners that if
their flooring is more than two years old, the formaldehyde had likely "off-gassed" down to
a normal level: "Several studies have shown that formaldehyde levels return to normal
levels about 2 years after formaldehyde-emitting products are installed in a home."


The CDC calculated that "the cancer risk from the off-gassing floorboards is 2 [to 9]
additional cases of cancer per 100,000 people exposed" [20-90 per million] and reassured
homeowners: "To put those numbers in perspective, the American Cancer Society
(www.cancer.org) estimates that for people living in the United States, one in two men and
one in three women will develop cancer from all causes."


In its recommendations, the CDC suggested that homeowners should see a doctor if they
have symptoms related to indoor air quality and take steps to reduce the concentration of
formaldehyde in the air (increase ventilation, lower temperature and humidity, cease
smoking indoors, etc.).


But the CDC pooh-poohed the idea of widespread air testing ("Generally residents do not
need to consider testing the air in their homes, especially if the flooring was installed more
than two years ago.") or replacing any flooring:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3956950-short-lumber-liquidators 6/32


Residents should consider the following before removing this type of laminate
flooring from their homes:


If the flooring was installed more than 2 years ago, the levels of formaldehyde
have most likely returned to what is normally found in homes - so there is
probably no reason to remove it.
Removing laminate flooring may release more formaldehyde into the home.
Some new flooring may also release formaldehyde.
Consult a certified professional (such as a CIH or REHS/RS) before taking any
action to remove the flooring.


The media coverage of the report was minimal and, in general, quite favorable: the cancer
risk is de minimis and most homeowners don't have to test the air much less replace the
flooring. Not surprisingly, the stock rose ~20% in the next few days.


But it turns out that the CDC made a major computational error: its analysts calculated the
formaldehyde concentration in the test room based on a ceiling height of eight meters
instead of eight feet!


60 Minutes learned of the CDC's mistake and on Sunday, February 21st, Anderson
Cooper gave the following update (which you can watch here):



http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/lumber-liquidators-update-2
5/23/2018 Why I'm Again Short Lumber Liquidators - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3956950-short-lumber-liquidators 7/32


After our story aired last March, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, working
with the Centers for Disease Control, launched a study of that laminate flooring. This
month, the government published its findings. They showed the flooring gave off
enough formaldehyde to irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and could trigger
breathing problems. It also increased cancer risk by a small amount.


After the report was published, 60 Minutes was alerted to the possibility that
government scientists made a major mathematical mistake in their report. We sent
the report to scientists at several universities and discovered the government forget
to convert feet to meters in some calculations.


That error means that all the predicted formaldehyde levels from Lumber Liquidators'
flooring are 3.3 times higher than government scientists calculated, which can
amount to more than 18 times higher levels of formaldehyde than those in a normal
home and triple the cancer risk to a level that's considered unacceptable by national
and international health agencies.


(Here are screenshots of the scary, rising-bar graphics in the background as Cooper
read the last paragraph:)


The Centers for Disease Control has admitted its mistake and issued a correction.


The Consumer Product Safety Commission is continuing its investigation and told us
it's working to provide more specific answers to homeowners about the safety
concerns.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3956950-short-lumber-liquidators 8/32


The key words here are "triple the cancer risk to a level that's considered unacceptable by
national and international health agencies" and, on the chart, "Additional cancer risk."


The CDC issued a press release admitting its error and tripling its formaldehyde exposure
and cancer risk estimates:


CDC/ATSDR was notified February 13 of an error in its report released February 10,
2016, about the possible health effects from exposure to formaldehyde emitted from
select laminate flooring samples. Health risks of people who have the laminate
flooring are being revised to reflect greater exposure to formaldehyde, which could
cause eye, nose, and throat irritation for anyone. The estimated risk of cancer
associated with exposure to the flooring increased.


The CDC/ATSDR indoor air model used an incorrect value for ceiling height. As a
result, the health risks were calculated using airborne concentration estimates about
3 times lower than they should have been... After correcting the measurement in the
model, CDC/ATSDR is revising the possible health effects... The estimated risk of
cancer is 6-30 cases per 100,000 people [60-300 per million].


In the days after the 60 Minutes' story and the CDC's correction, there was a media frenzy,
including stories on every major evening news program, and unlike the first round of
(limited) publicity, the focus was on the increased cancer risk. Not surprisingly, the next
day the stock dropped 20% to around $11.


Keep in mind that this is anecdotal, but my best source (an industry veteran whose
information and anecdotes are derived not from anyone at Lumber Liquidators itself, but
from installers and others who have had interactions with the company), whose
information is consistently accurate, tells me that this wave of publicity has had a hugely
deleterious impact on Lumber Liquidators, possibly even exceeding what happened in the
aftermath of the initial 60 Minutes story a year ago. The impact is in three primary areas:


1) Sales are down because customers are avoiding Lumber Liquidators.


2) Customers with Lumber Liquidators' flooring are returning it (if not yet installed) or
demanding that it be removed.


3) Lumber Liquidators' employees are demoralized and looking to leave.


Here are some anecdotes that he shared with me:


From Stores

5/23/2018 Why I'm Again Short Lumber Liquidators - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3956950-short-lumber-liquidators 9/32


A store manager on the east coast said that sales in January and February were the
two worst months in the history of the store - and then things got worse! He said the
week after the 60 Minutes update and resulting cancer scare was the "worst
experience of his life." In the first two days of March the store actually had negative
revenue due to returns.
At another store, the incoming phone calls were so intense and frequent that the store
manager unplugged it and threw it in the warehouse.
On Tuesday, February 23rd (two days after the 60 Minutes update aired), one store
had a long line of people returning product - a total of $10,000-$11,000 just that
morning.
Last week, the store manager of a competitor, whose store is directly across the street
from a Lumber Liquidators' store, looked over a half dozen times during the day and on
at least two occasions saw trucks pulling in with product but leaving with nothing (i.e.,
returns). At least one customer came into the competitor's store that day saying he had
cancelled his order with Lumber Liquidators and just wanted something "non-toxic!"
The competitor says this is now a regular occurrence.


From Customers


My source has heard multiple stories of Lumber Liquidators' customers who are so
desperate to get this "crap" out of their homes to protect the health of themselves and
their families that they're paying for removal themselves, even though they doubt that
they'll get a refund or any reasonable remedy from Lumber Liquidators. They just don't
want a carcinogenic floor.
A customer showed up absolutely livid because she felt that the Lumber Liquidators'
store manager had deceived her when he told her in January that the laminate floor
she had purchased had been discontinued. She later learned that it had been pulled
because it was toxic. The manager recounted this story to an installer and confessed,
"You know what, she's right. I lied to her. I feel so bad. I can't keep doing this."
A customer showed up with documentation showing that he had bought a floor from
Lumber Liquidators in 2011-12, and last year his dog died from some strange cancer.
Now he says he "knows what happened!"


If these anecdotes are at all representative of what's happening across Lumber
Liquidators' entire store base (which I think is likely the case), then the company is in big,
big trouble.


Five More Pieces of New Information

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3956950-short-lumber-liquidators 10/32


In the rest of my presentation, I detailed the five additional pieces of new information that,
along with the cancer scare discussed above, led me to reestablish my short position in
Lumber Liquidators. Here's a summary of each:


The cancer risk is likely significantly greater than even the CDC's revised estimate, which
could result in further damaging publicity and increased liabilities


I believe that the CDC's report, even after adjusting it to increase formaldehyde levels by
3.3x, significantly understates the actual amount of formaldehyde that homeowners are
exposed to, for two reasons:


1) The CDC did two types of tests, small chamber and large chamber, and appeared to
weight them equally. However, I believe that the large chamber test, which showed ~6x
higher formaldehyde levels, is far more realistic and therefore that these results should be
used to calculate risks of adverse health effects.


2) The CDC assured homeowners that if their flooring is more than two years old, the
formaldehyde had likely off-gassed down to a normal level. However, I believe this
statement is incorrect; my analysis of the research regarding how quickly formaldehyde
off-gasses leads me to believe that elevated (and dangerous) levels of formaldehyde
persist for far longer than two years - and thus the cancer risk is 12-26 times greater than
the CDC's revised estimate.


A "Prop 65" trial has just begun that LL is likely to lose, resulting in further adverse
publicity


Proposition 65 is a California law requires businesses to notify Californians about
significant amounts of chemicals in the products they purchase, in their homes or
workplaces, or that are released into the environment. Formaldehyde is one of ~800
chemicals covered by the law.


Global Community Monitor, a California-based environmental organization, and Sunshine
Park LLC, an entity formed by one or more anonymous hedge funds, have filed a Prop 65
lawsuit against Lumber Liquidators (I have had no contact with GCM nor the hedge
fund(s) and don't know who they are). I have posted the opposing trial briefs here and
here.


GSM is asking for the following damages: a recall of the toxic flooring, reimbursement of
attorney's fee, and a penalty of $2,500/day per violation (subject to a one-year statute of
limitations). I estimate that Lumber Liquidators sold Chinese-made laminate to ~80,000

customers nationwide per year. If California was 12% of the total, that's 9,600 customers.
At $2,500 each, that's $24 million/day or $8.8 billion over one year!


Alexander Robertson of Robertson & Associates, a lawyer who is very familiar with this
case, told me that he expects Lumber Liquidators will lose this trial and, even before the
damages phase starts, the headlines will be that a judge has determined that the
company's laminates were toxic. This additional adverse publicity will likely further impact
sales to new customers and cause even more panic among prior Lumber Liquidators'
customers, who will demand refunds and replacement flooring.


Likelihood of even larger legal and regulatory liabilities


Lumber Liquidators settled Lacey Act violations (related to illegally harvested hardwoods)
with the Department of Justice last October for $13.2 million. But the company has yet to
reach settlements with any of the regulators or lawyers related to formaldehyde - and the
CDC recently tripling the exposure level and cancer risk by 3.3x will make undoubtedly
make settlements that much more difficult and expensive to achieve.


The amounts at stake here could make the cost of the Lacey Act settlement look like
chump change - and if the CDC revises the risk upward again, as I believe it should, then
all bets are off.


Operating performance of the business in Q4 was much worse than I expected - and I
think meaningful improvement is unlikely for quite some time (if ever)


Lumber Liquidators' operations are performing even more poorly than I thought they would
when I covered this position a couple of months ago - and I can see no signs of a
turnaround.


Same-store sales worsened in Q4 to -17.2%, gross margin remained depressed, and
overhead (SG&A) costs remained elevated, resulting in an operating loss of more than
$30 million. And, unlike Q1-Q3 2015, when inventory reductions led to $15 million of
positive free cash flow despite $51.4 million of operating losses, in Q4 free cash flow was
-$28 million. Now that inventory has been right-sized, I expect operating income and free
cash flow to track each other fairly closely going forward.


Turning to the balance sheet, as of the end of Q4 (12/31/15), the company had $67.2
million available on its line of credit and $6.7 million in net cash, but both are declining
rapidly: net cash fell sharply from $33.8 million at the end of Q3 to $6.7 million at the end
of Q4 - and is likely negative now. (On the Q4 conference call on 2/29/16, CFO Greg

Whirley said: "During the first quarter of 2016, we borrowed an additional $10 million
against our asset-based revolving credit facility to fund additional inventory purchases in
advance of the higher volume spring flooring season.")


Thus, the onus is now on the company to turn things around because if sales and margins
remain depressed, it could soon be in big trouble. I don't lightly throw out the possibility of
Lumber Liquidators going bankrupt, but simple math tells me this is not only possible but
likely within a year if the company keeps posting quarterly losses in the $30 million range.


Lack of confidence in company leadership


Pretty much the entire board and the current CEO, John Presley, presided over Lumber
Liquidators when, over an extended period, it purchased and imported illegally harvested
hardwoods and toxic laminate, thereby bringing the company to its knees - yet these are
the people who are supposed to fix the mess they're responsible for???


If they had confidence in their ability to turn things around, why aren't they buying stock?
There hasn't been one insider purchase in the past year.


John Presley, who's been on Lumber Liquidators' board since 2006 and was chairman of
the audit committee in recent years, has no retail experience - his entire career has been
in banking - and, according to two of my sources, he's not getting the job done:


Multiple store managers say that their sales plan (on which each manager's bonus is
based) has been increased to 2014 levels, so few stores have any chance of hitting
their goal. In one region, with over 20 stores, only a few hit plan in February
This has further demoralized store managers, who are increasingly seeking
employment elsewhere
LL's supply chain, price articulation strategy, product selection and quality are all areas
of severe neglect and concern
Both merchandising and operations are in need of an upgrade


My conclusion is that the board needs to find a new CEO - and shareholders need to
replace most of the board - before it's too late.


PS - I no longer read the message boards for the articles I publish because the attacks
from anonymous trolls cause me too much agita. I do, however, want to hear thoughtful
comments and questions so I invite my readers to communicate with me via Seeking
Alpha messaging and I will post my answers on the message board.

If they can say it succinctly and explain it well in about a minute, then they really understand what they are doing. You
test for a few details and then good to go.


If it takes them half an hour to arrive at a conclusion, then they don't know what they are doing and they're still figuring
it out. There's no need to test this it's just true.


This article fails the 'I know what I'm doing' test.

Ross Perot's "Giant sucking sound" to explain how NAFTA worked.


Mr. Tilson is reaching the point he could short anything. 
Short a stock on Monday. 
Announce he is short on Tuesday. 
Close the short on Wednesday, profiting from the news he was short.

Mako,


Assuming your comment was directed at me then my point has nothing to do with my ability to read.


There is deep underlying logic. You can't synthesize for others something that you yourself haven't
understood in the first place.


The article says that LL has disgruntled staff and the bogey has been raised before they get paid making
things worse.

It also says that if LL do nothing about costs and the non recurring costs (sic) continue and the bad press for
the tenth time is more impactful than it was for the first nine times then in about a year they will or won't run
out of money.


He also expresses a belief that the CDC is understating health risks that they themselves explicitly state they
are erring on the side of caution on ie overstating.

Oh! Well, why didn't you say so. The CDC "themselves explicitly state they are erring on the side of caution."


Of course they do, you unshrewd person. Just like the FDA always assures everyone that the food they eat is
safe, never explaining whether their later decision to outright ban pesticides that used to be directly applied to
crops might, just possibly, result from a somewhat changed analysis of the safety risks.


I'm betting you aren't involved in risk analysis and don't know a whole lot about how different government
agencies determine what is and what is not an acceptable risk. Notwithstanding that, you obviously think you
do, which pretty much confirms the suspicions I had about the quality of your analysis based on your earlier
comment.

Whitney, I believe this is harassment toward LL. CARB and the EPA has never proved formaldehyde as a carcinogen
and modeled it's conclusion on the precautionary principle. If LL would allow me and my experts to help, the outcome

another feeding frenzy by unscrupulous lawyers that we commonly see going after a company for their financial gain.

It is quite clear that Whitney Tilson is running around yelling cancer as much as possible when all of the tests
run by the Cpsc and CDC have shown no real cancer risk even after erring on the side of caution.  
Tilson would like to sensationalize the story for another run by trying to scare off future consumers (even
though LL dumped the Chinese laminate) and he hopes to scare past consumers - in spite of the fact that
operating a cell phone daily poses a greater health risk than the flooring, which had less formaldehyde
content than a nail salon. 
Whitney Tilson has established a number of trades on the thesis that he can scare investors of companies
whose products have traces of formaldehyde as he has unsuccessfully done with Wayfair. Whitney Tilson's
formaldehyde trades are overplayed and try to fear monger among consumers on this totally overblown risk
will be a huge mistake for him as the company will effect a turnaround - with or without an acquirer. 
Whitney Tilson is sitting on a cancerous portfolio with exposure to Perishing Square and it's own highly toxic
and alpha-killing portfolio , additional shorts of Herbalife, and what shows a total absence of investment
acumen here with this recycled short of LL.

"When Google had its IPO in 2004, Tilson famously said in 2004 Motley Fool article, "Google with the same market
cap of McDonald's (a stock I own)?! HA! I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be highly
disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to that."[7] Note:
Since then (as of 10/18/13) Google has gone on to give its investors over a 1050% return."

The following is from today's CWRUObserver-Unbiased Financial News


For the full year, 12 Wall Street analysts forecast this company (LL) would deliver earnings of $-0.44 per share, with a
high estimate of $-0.11 and a low estimate of $-0.98. It had reported earnings per share of $-0.44 in the
corresponding quarter of the previous year. Revenue for the period is expected to total nearly $965.71M versus
978.78M in the preceding year.


The analysts project the company to maintain annual growth of around 30 percent over the next five years as
compared to an average growth rate of 13.11 percent expected for its competitors in the same industry.

Quoting Mr Tilson:  
"It's hard to know when Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate first became toxic (maybe it always was?), but
forced to guess, let's go with 2010. If so, I estimate that Lumber Liquidators sold this product to ~400,000 households,
thereby exposing over one million Americans"


What agency has determined that LL's Chinese laminate was toxic? 
"Maybe it always was?" (toxic) According to who? Mr. Tilson?


Regarding exposure to toxic laminate, Mr Tilson makes up a data range and assigns EVERY sale of Chinese laminate
(made by LL) into his "thesis". This is irresponsible (and sloppy) research.


Sidebar: There are five factories in China producing laminate. Mr Tilson has not mentioned that Lowes and Floor &
Decor are each facing class action suits for selling Chinese laminate. Is he callling their laminate flooring toxic, as
well? It's ironic that Mr Tilson plugged Floor & Decor in his 132 page PPT presentation.


Whitney Tilson continues tilting at windmills.

Formaldehyde has been used in the timber industry for years universally as a preservative against insects that attacks

floor producers and LL only shows fear mongering and using this as a tool for your own ends in shorting the stock. It
may not work.

Mr Tilson 
I respect your analysis ,even though it is obviously self serving. 
I also think that it is going to be difficult to directly link any cancers to LL flooring issues. 
IMOP the two real risks that LL faces are litigation and reputation risk. 
The first can probably be funded from their current balance sheet and out of future profits and cash flow. Prop 65 is an
additional issue that needs more detailed explanation 
Reputation risk seems to be a larger problem ,especially in light of the disappointing financial results from the last
quarter .If what you describe is true and is also widespread system wide,then their business has continued to
deteriorate and the possibility of Chapter 11 becomes more real. 
I suggest to both bulls and bears that they visit some LL stores in their area and observe for themselves the amount
of customer and truck traffic going in and out of these stores.


13 Mar 2016, 11:59 AM


Jason Robideaux
If the public is scared of LL it is mainly because of false statements made about them by 60 Minutes. In measuring the
flooring's formaldehyde emissions, 60 Minutes used deconstructive testing, which all testing labs and agencies admit
does not provide accurate results. The CDC found most of the LL flooring they tested well within CARB limits. Once
the CDC issues its final report, 60 Minutes will be forced to retract its claims the flooring was offgassing up to 20 times
the legal limit for formaldehyde, a ridiculous allegation that is unsubstantiated when proper tests are performed. A 60
Minutes correction will help rehabilitate the company's reputation and promote higher sales. Then 60 Minutes, and
hopefully yourself as well, will be on the hook for tens of millions in damages claims as a result of the knowingly
making inaccurate allegations against the company that scared the public into believing the flooring was dangerous.


17 Mar 2016, 04:20 AM


HeadyChick
Unbeknownst to most people, 60 Minutes played a shell game w/the lab report findings in their segment. The
numbers they quoted as 20% higher were from deconstruction testing.


Emission chamber tests of laminate (intact) results were not nearly as alarming. Note they did not quote ANY
ppm results:


"The second test the labs did was the CDPH (California Department of Public Health test) 01350 test, which
measures the concentration of formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical
home. The highest-emitting Lumber Liquidators sample that the labs tested emitted a concentration of

"polluted indoor conditions." (From a later statement, "More on tests used to investigate Lumber Liquidators")

Watch the original March 2015 segment again and see for yourself how they presented the data. There was
no "context" in how product is tested nor was LL given an opportunity to present their side of the story. It was
"gotcha" story telling / editing. They came to the conclusion and built the story around that conclusion.


Oops they did it again in their March 2016 update (3 TIMES MORE LIKELY).


ZERO context.

60 Minutes will not issue a retraction. They dug in too deep, and any hopes for a fair response from them
were long lost after their latest 'update' to announce that the CDC changed their findings from not dangerous,
to not dangerous. I believe that they characterized this as "CDC error means cancer risk from Lumber
Liquidators is triple what was originally reported".


When was it that 60 Minutes relieved the public's anxiety over that original CDC report again?


Fortunately 60 Minutes is far from having the same influence that they once had, and there will be many other
outlets that should be happy to report on the final CDC report. They didn't put an explosive in a GM truck gas
tank, like Dateline did, but anyone with an even rudimentary understanding of the facts surrounding the
allegations against Lumber Liquidators would be hard pressed to find much difference in this blatant smear
piece.

im surprised by this investment for one sime reason: we are talking about product LL no longer sells.


therefore, the thesis is the the reputational damage will be enough to bankrupt the company, although they apparently
have changed they ways.


i think that might be a stretch.

Bankrupt might be a stretch although I have seen it mentioned in consumer complaints. Many are still waiting months
for test kits, credits from returns (not even related to the formaldehyde issue), and customer service giving them the
runaround after several calls, some have even been hung up on. They may have stopped selling the product but poor
management still prevails!

Patrick Industries PATK makes LL look like amateur team when it comes to the formaldehyde issue and the Lacey
Act. Plus duty evasion. They started the FEMA trailer issue and the whole formaldehyde issue by remarking crates
back in 2005 and before to save money and help them compete with Adorn, Inc. Adorns head is now CEO of PATK. I
know, I was part of that scheme as a witness for 20 years. LL got into trouble not on purpose but rather they didn't
know any better.

I'm guessing LL goes to $14 and then Whitney comes out with an article that says he is now "75% sure" LL will go

But Whitney, your LL position had a tiny impact on your fund performance. And your long-term track record is worse
than the market. I think you underestimate the company's ability to recover from this cancer thing. The odds of getting
cancer from this now-discontinued LL product is minuscule, and a year from now, the company's sales will be up
sharply and in recovery mode. I suggest you cover your short, you've made your money, the worst is over.


22 Mar 2016, 02:14 PM

According to the National Cancer Institute, the annual rate of cancer is 454 per 100,000 people. The discontinued LL
laminate cancer risk is at most, 30 per 100,000. So the rate of getting cancer from this discontinued laminate is 7% of
the overall risk, or 0.0003 vs general risk of 0.005. The headlines screaming about "triple the cancer risk" is wildly
misleading.


Any sales weakness in the near term will be short-lived, especially the public understands this product isn't sold any
more, and comes back to reality. Chinese laminate was maybe 10% of their sales. I'll be like Whitney and pull a

probability out of my butt: there's an 80% probability LL will fully recover from this within a year and not go bankrupt.
Maybe Whitney will get lucky and the stock will drop to $8 or less. Whitney, you have a terrible investing track record.
I expect you to return to CNBC and talk down LL again. Is this the best you can do?

Since Whitney Tilson does worse than an unmanaged index of stocks, he's essentially worthless as a money
manager. He must have friends at CNBC, you know, that financial entertainment channel, because I can see no other
reason to let him share his worthless opinions with the world. And whenever he or other "professionals" appear on
CNBC to talk their book, or prognosticate about the future, there's NEVER a disclaimer below their talking heads
telling us "this person is wrong 80% of the time", or "correct 50% of the time". I suggest Tilson be ignored because his
track record proves he's a terrible hedge fund manager.

How many floors they have to replace?


Every person that has a floor from LL that recently got cancer is going to claim it was from the floor.


I do not see how they survive, if you have an idea please post how.

Oh Jesus, cover already.


To date, there have been ZERO cases of even alleged cancer, and a brief reading of the final CDC report will
tell you why that will be the final number.

If Tilson was bigger than he is, you'd see people buy just to push him against his trade like Icahn and Loeb
did to Ackman on HLF.

"I now believe that Lumber Liquidators' sales will not recover in the first half of the year, possibly longer, due to a
recent well-publicized cancer scare that, according to my sources, has had a hugely deleterious impact on Lumber
Liquidators."


So, this isn't insider trading?

Don't 100,000 people have to stay indoors 24/7/365 for two years for 30 of them to get cancer?


23 Mar 2016, 08:08 PM


User 316261
No. It's nowhere near that serious.


Look here's what they would have to do.


- Use a time machine to go back to when the product was still on sale 
AND 
- Carefully select items with the absolute highest reading 
AND 
- Put them in a new well insulated house (a drafty old house won't do) 
AND 
- Move it to a parallel universe where offgassing doesn't reduce with time 
AND 
- Close all the windows and doors 
AND 
- Stay inside it all day every day for two years straight


Doing every one of these successfully will increase their lifetime risk of getting cancer by up to 0.000006%. (I
double checked the zero's).


I think the most difficult steps are probably the time machine and the parallel universe.

Whitney, just as you correctly perceived more downside in your earlier short, you are now incorrectly seeing more
downside. I am guessing it's because you come from a wealthier world where consumers can freely and easily switch
brands based on quality without price as the primary factor. But for more and more of American families, there is
increasingly lack of economic ability to trade up. As long as the potential harmful effects are marginal or semi-
controllable by opening windows and ventilating floors, as the CDC suggested would reduce risk and likely risk lasting
around two years mostly, and the risk not so much when compared with pumping gas or smoking, then there will
always be a strong core market for us less wealthy folks... We have not the economic liberty you do, and if you drive
LL out of business, you are doing us a disservice. The cost benefit analysis for many is not the same as yours. You
drive a highly safety ranked SUV or Mercedes? We cannot. You eat high priced organic groceries? We cannot. You
drink freshest bottled water? We cannot. I hope you see my point.

If you force the world to dispose of smallest compact cars which are clearly not as safe as a Lincoln SUV, and then
only high priced SUVs remain for sale, what have you done?

I would like to hear from 1 Bull that he/she has recently  
1. Purchased $LL products for installation in their home  
2. recommended LL products to a friend or loved one.


02 Apr 2016, 05:13 PM


Jacob Scott
Wouldn't say, I'm a bull, I just think nearly everything Whitney Tilson was spouting seems self-serving,
exaggerated or outright dishonest.


I wouldn't attempt to trade the stock because I think the reputation hit LL has taken is as real as if they were
knowingly causing cancer even if that isn't true. They also have real margin problems to go along with that.


Replaced the floors in my house with bamboo from LL maybe a year and a half ago and have no issue with
them at all.


I'd tell anyone to sample against whatever other flooring place for quality and price and if the quality appears
the same to you, I wouldn't worry about any health risk.

If you are worried about little old formaldehyde, you should do a quick search for radon. A lot more people have that in
their homes.


"Radon exposure is the second-leading environmental cause of lung cancer death, after tobacco smoke (Copes 2007;
EPA 2009a), and the leading cause of lung cancer death for nonsmokers (EPA 2009b)."

So technically speaking the lows are in. Unfortunately for Whitney this trade is only getting worse. The sad truth for all
the warren Buffett fans is value investing works on the long side as you can wait until proven right. Ignoring the
technicals in the short side is deadly and will cause loses.


My only question is when will Whitney cover and will he write an article to key us know? Probably not

Technical Trader, I recently watched a movie from 2009 called Pelham 123 which in some ways is similar to the
activities of Tilson in manipulating the market for self gain. Tilson caused by using non-factual information knowing
this would cause a slide in LL's stock price by using an emotional environmental and health issue for self financial
gain. Do you think this is a crime?
