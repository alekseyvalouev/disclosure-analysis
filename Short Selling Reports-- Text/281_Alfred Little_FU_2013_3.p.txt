FAB: Where Are Your Beijing Media Kiosks?
Dec. 9, 2013 5:04 PM ET78 comments
by: Alfred Little


As noted in my original report, FAB Universal (NYSEMKT:FU) claims to have 16,820
media kiosks in China according to its Q3 2013 earnings press release. Furthermore, in its
6/1/12 proxy FAB claimed that 3,954 of its media kiosks were located in Beijing. I
challenged FAB to disclose the locations of its Beijing media kiosks so that investors could
independently verify them. In almost four weeks since I published my report, FAB has
failed to publish the kiosk locations. In the absence of a list from FAB:


My investigators found a total of only 20 FAB media kiosks in Beijing. 16 of these
kiosks were deployed in FAB's flagship SoShow store.
FAB's Chinese website lists 13 FAB store locations. 7 of these stores appear to be
nonexistent or out of business. The flagship Joy City store has been shut down for
"remodeling." 4 smaller FAB stores had only 1 kiosk each.
Using Chinese Internet searches my investigators found an additional 17 possible FAB
media kiosk locations. However, none of these locations had any FAB kiosks.
FAB's Chinese website customer support hotline staff were unable to provide my
investigators with any additional locations.


As ridiculous as it sounds, I could only locate 20 out of approximately 4,000 media kiosks
FAB claims to have in Beijing. I certainly believe that there must be more than 20,
however, the difficulty finding these media kiosks indicates that the true total is certainly a
small fraction of the 4,000 that FAB claimed. I urge anyone aware of any locations that I
missed to let me know, so that I can promptly update this report.


Details:


The most logical place to commence a search for FAB's media kiosks is FAB's own
Chinese website (fab.com.cn). However, FAB's Chinese website has no media kiosk
locator (a major red flag). Instead, FAB's website simply presents a list of 13 FAB store
locations, including the flagship SoShow and Joy City stores. A screenshot of the list of
store locations from FAB's website appears below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1886851-fab-where-are-your-beijing-media-kiosks 2/24


My investigators recorded their visits to each of the 13 locations. 7 of the 13 locations no
longer existed and had no media kiosks. The Joy City store is still closed for "remodeling."


FAB's flagship SoShow store has an eye-popping 16 media kiosks on display. Considering
the SoShow store's basement location and lack of customer traffic, the main purpose of
these kiosks appears to be to fool investors. FAB's remaining 4 small stores had only 1
kiosk each.


By comparison, Redbox (NASDAQ:OUTR) generally deploys no more than two kiosks to
serve the thousands of daily customers at a typical Walmart Superstore. Check it out for
yourself by inserting your ZIP code into Redbox's kiosk locator. Real companies with real
customers, like Redbox, readily publish and update their kiosk locations. FAB does not.


The following table summarizes my findings:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1886851-fab-where-are-your-beijing-media-kiosks 3/24


Extending the search beyond FAB's Chinese website, my investigators conducted
Chinese Internet searches to locate and then recorded visits to an additional 17 possible
FAB media kiosk locations. None of these visits turned up any additional media kiosks.


My investigators also called FAB's customer service hotline (a cell-phone number) on its
Chinese website (shown below) to find additional Beijing media kiosk locations. The
support staff explained that he was unsure of any locations beyond the 13 disclosed on
the FAB's website. He promised to confer with his colleagues and then call my
investigators back. His eventual response was simply to advise my investigators, via a text
message, to visit FAB's SoShow store.


So where are FAB's 4,000 Beijing media kiosks? FAB so far refuses to say. In FAB's Q3
2013 earnings conference call, held on 11/14/13, CEO Chris Spencer made the excuse
that it takes time to translate the locations:


"Many of you have asked for a map or a list of the exact locations of our 16,820
kiosks as well as full listings of our content offerings. We will be populating our
website with more information as it's translated although it's taking time to complete
the translation. We expect to have this available as quickly as possible."


The "translation" excuse fails to explain why 7 of the 13 store locations from FAB's
Chinese website do not even exist. I believe FAB's delay in publishing a list of media kiosk
locations is quite simply because most of the kiosks do not exist.


Unfortunately, FAB's U.S. management and independent directors appear to be doing
nothing to protect investors. I offered to meet with CEO Chris Spencer, Jim Rogers, and
the other independent directors to show them all my evidence. None have accepted my

offer. FAB's auditor, Friedman LLP, has also not accepted my offer to meet to review the
evidence. It appears that all these "gatekeepers" are content to let FAB's Chairman
Hongcheng Zhang take as much time as he needs to try to cover up his fraud.


Conclusion:


I continue to challenge FAB to publish a detailed list of locations to allow investors to visit
and confirm the existence of FAB's vast purported network of media kiosks. I am
absolutely convinced that FAB's media kiosk count is fabricated and I believe that
Chairman Zhang Hongcheng is actively covering up this fraud as best as he can. Zhang,
like other Chinese fraudsters, will probably never be held accountable. But it's high time
we hold FAB's U.S. management, auditor, and independent directors responsible for
failing to protect investors.

am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company

Why do you compare FAB to rebox when they are completely different business models? Rebox owns the units,
whereas FAB grants licenses to individuals (over 9K who have the right to move them around as they see fit). Paying
a few kids in China to run around and look for Kiosks proves nothing. FAB already stated they don't know the exact
location of all their Kiosks....thanks for confirming what they already stated. Let's wait for FAB's reply before placing
judgement.

Alfred,


I thought the kiosks generally were serviced via Internet connections. At least I have read that before.


I guess kiosks may be serviced also locally, but I'm guessing that would be an expensive endeavor. That said,
I think we all are at best interpreting what we've read or heard for the most part. For remote connections,
location would not be so important.


That said, I agree, it's time to see a list of the kiosks from FU. I am assuming, however, that the 2012 Beijing
listed 4000 kiosks may no longer be so accurate... it may be that the FU business model works better a tier or
two down from Beijing.


And, yes, I think in a week or so, we will find out if there is any fraud or not...

Not to state the obvious but:


1) Funny how you started commenting JUST AFTER this FU debacle.


2) Counter this point: Redbox publishes its kiosk locations so that customers can FIND the kiosks to USE
them. Why wouldn't FAB do so as well? That in itself is a red flag. I'm a potential customer. I go to the website
and find the nearest kiosk so I can give FAB business.... but all 4,000 kiosk locations are a secret? Go fish.....


3) Alfred, you rock and thanks for the research. Investors appreciate it. And potential investors - you probably
saved them some $. Maybe even potential kiosk 'investors' in China....

Lucky,


I want to pay you a compliment.


I have read all your FU-related posts and have enjoyed your commitment to getting to the truth, your astute
observations, and your entertaining comments.


I don't mind saying this FU halt has me going crazy with anxiety as I am long a fair number of FU shares.


Hopefully, this halt will be at end soon, and we'll know what is what when FU and/or the NYSE reports back.
Like you, this bond situation, especially, has concerned me, and left me perplexed, as to what really
happened and why. I have spent 5-10 hours reading up on WFOE, VIE, etc. to try to understand what may
have happened, assuming FAB Media did issue a bond, but I gained few useful insights.


I appreciate the articles by GEO Investing and Alfred Little... but I understand for them this is business... and
creating hysteria and performing cloaked persuasion is their mind game... one need only look at their word
choices to be reminded of this.

I agree that FAB's business model "works better" outside of Beijing, but only because it would make it easier
for FAB to conceal the fact the business is a fraud.

I Purchased FU in early August of this year for mid $4. Their story seemed rather appealing.


I watched the SP explode to a high of $11.48 on September 26, and, on that same day, I read the article by
Investor RockieK: Fab Universal – Fabulous Not So Much (http://seekingalpha.co...), which outlined much of
what Jon has written here.


After researching what RockieK wrote, and watching the SP quickly move back down, I decided that where
there is smoke, there may be fire, and sold my position in early October for mid $6.


If the allegations prove false, I may move back in, but it just seemed prudent to get out before what may
happen, actually seems to have happened.


Good luck.

Their response was predictable.


1) bond: oops sorry. We won't do this again. 
2) Kiosk: so many, hard to count. And how does one define kiosk 
3) Min guarantee. We wouldn't write that down now would we? We might promise it, wink nod. But let's not
put that in the contracts. 
4) Pirated content: We cannot police every kiosk owner. 
5) Cash: non issue.

10 Dec 2013, 12:23 PM


SurprisedGuy
The accusation of a minimum guarantee on licensed kiosks makes no sense to me. I have doubted this claim
since I first heard it. Why would FU do that? Offer up stock? Who does that? How many times have you made
an investment and been guaranteed a minimum return... while your maximum return was open? Most likely,
some investigator is trying to overachieve or get more hours. This is more likely than the allegation. :)

Since China has many more "mom & pop" stores than the US, and a higher savings rate, a kiosk could be as few as
10 DVD's or as many as several hundred; or a "kiosk" could be like lottery sales in the US where the store rents a
machine capable of printing lottery tickets and disbursing money based on a winning ticket. If the store doesn't have
enough traffic they won't make money. So, these "mom & pop" stores' traffic defines volume (sales) and Fab also
relies on these "mom & pop" stores for verbal advertising. So, the definition of a kiosk could be quite variable. In a
mall, or just a small addition to a store?

Alfred's investagators are kids he pays maybe 500 dollars for a month's worth of running around looking at FAB's
listed stores only. They are about as sophisticated as my tennis shoes (my old ones, not my hi-tech new ones).
Anyone that would invest based upon their discoveries get what they deserve...."bullet proof" my butt. 
FAB's response today was about the best one could expect...if they are long. I was thinking my angle was right on the
bond, but I guess FAB decided to just restate and be done with that argument. 
As for looking for Kiosks locations like Rebox....where do you search, on the internet that doesn't work or is super
slow? That's the whole idea behind the business model. Put them in busy locations and let customers discover them.
That's the plan. 
In any event, the Kiosks agument will be dead soon enough when the locations are posted. FAB openning themselves
to a third party pretty investigation and the cash being verified pretty much put closure on the total fraud line also. 
The irony of this whole situation is all the shorts have done is make FAB a stronger company going forward. A year

FAB will divest the kiosk business before they will ever publish a list of 3,954 locations in Beijing. Also,
consider why FAB today claimed precisely 3,954 locations AS OF 9/30/13. They disclosed the exact same
number as of the 6/1/12 Proxy. Isn't it odd that the count hasn't changed in almost 1 1/2 years?


11 Dec 2013, 12:15 AM


Lucky?
Alfred, 
Have you ever owned, run, or managed a company or even deposited money in a third world country? If you did you'd
know they still produce paper trails for everything. It's like the dark ages. I just deposited 5K into the local back
(traveling around Asia playing golf) and they gave me a hand written receipt. I guarantee you that list you seek is
divided up between about 30 handwritten journals covering 5 years. Now throw in the fact some are being constantly
moved or sold I seriously doubt even FAB knows an exact number. But during last Q's C.C. Spencer offered this up: "I
don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but it was approaching 16,000 and then again we sell them they are not
always activated immediately and so forth so we get the information. It's important to understand that we don't
actually own the kiosks, the kiosks are owned by the licensees, they purchase them directly from one of five
manufacturers that we have designated or approved. And so we get the reports from the manufacturers and then we
determine between sales, as well as activation. So I think the number that we reported today is the number we are
very confident in." 
Remember, FAB has always stated the Kiosks are designed for tier two cities where the internet is either non existant
or just plain slow, so one should not expect an explosion of Kiosks in Beijing. 
The bottom line for me is if Zhang was really selling a fraud business he would have bailed with the 16M in bond
money. Why not? He had access to it and the collateral was worthless anyway (according to you). Yet he voluntarily
gave it all up: "The confirmation confirmed the cash proceeds from the bond offering were in the bank account. The
bond proceeds were transferred to a FAB Universal operating account on November 22, 2013." So from Zhang's
hands to shareholder's hands. That's not usually the way frauds works, is it? Did you notice FAB also pulled the 13M
deposit on the building they had a deposit on? While no one ever brought it up, other than the bond that was the
biggest concern I had. Clearly Zhang picked out that building and pre-negotiated the price. Both signs of trouble. It
was a smart move by FAB's BOD to pull out, at least until the events surrounding the bond become more clear. And
as for your first statement, the fact FAB just announced they are opening up their books for a third party review kind of
makes it moot, don't you think?

Author’s reply »  Lucky,


1) There are certainly paper trails in China. The difficulty is determining which trails you can trust. Chinese bank
balance confirmation reports, for example, have been easily manipulated by crooked companies. I have no
confidence in them.


2) Chris Spencer's vague comments about FAB's franchised kiosk business do not reflect the reality. In Beijing, at
least, FAB's franchisees are merely investors in the kiosks. FAB controls everything: purchase, location selection,
deployment, content, maintenance, membership, payments, etc. The Beijing franchisees have no responsibility other
than to pay a single lump sum up front franchise fee to FAB, and then to wait patiently for a positive investment return
from what appears for all practical purposes to be a ponzi scheme.


11 Dec 2013, 09:33 AM


SurprisedGuy
In what way is FU licensing like a Ponzi scheme? That is a serious accusation. If I were to a similar
accusation against the shorts, it would be censored by SA editors. Yet you can make an unfounded
accusation. Keep in mind that I have heard from Chinese of what they call a pyramid arrangement. That is
simply building in a hierarchy of sales channels, from the first person involved to the last. That's the way
business often works legally here in U.S. That is not the same as a Ponzi scheme.


11 Dec 2013, 05:01 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Ultimately whether the Chinese kiosk business is a ponzi scheme or not depends on
whether the kiosks generate revenues and eventually profits from retail customers and advertisers. At 13c per
movie, profits from retail customers is impossible. I am also totally doubtful whether the advertising can ever
cover the costs (retail space, equipment, content licensing, internet connection, overhead). So I do believe it
is likely to turn out to be a Ponzi scheme, where the franchisees only hope of earning a positive return is from
selling back their kiosks to FAB for guaranteed minimum returns on their investments, payable in cash or FU
stock. FAB can only afford to payout those guaranteed minimums if they sign up more franchisees or issue
more shares.

A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or
new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the
operation. The perpetuation of the high returns requires an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors
to sustain the scheme.


In a nutshell, = FAB's selling of Kiosks in China. Next question please....

"A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing capital or
new capital paid by new investors" (Source: Wikipedia).


I don't read in your response that FAB's kiosk licensees have any resemblance to a Ponzi scheme. I'm sure
you remember from the FAB literature that kiosk licensees earn money by assigned percentages from three
sources: 1) advertising; 2) downloads; and 3) memberships. That's it! There is no payment to licensees
(investors) from existing capital or new capital. There is no Ponzi scheme. You'd be better off contending that
FAB licensees have made poor investments, but by definition there is no evidence to support a Ponzi
scheme.


As well, I don't buy into your accusation about the guaranteed minimum returns on investments, and FAB's
recent statement based on an examination of over 12,000 licenses supports me. You can discount the recent
FAB review. Nonetheless, a guaranteed minimum payment to kiosk licensees is right up there in likelihood
with the tooth fairy... life... and especially business just does not work like that.


Why would FAB offer guaranteed minimum returns? It makes no sense. Such a potential cost on the FAB side
would be unsupportable, and why should kiosk investors take on no risk?


My advice is to retract the accusation about the Ponzi scheme and the guaranteed minimum returns. It
sounds sensational but is based only on your speculation. Your own theories, sensible business practices,
and FAB's evidence sources do not support whatsoever the idea of a Ponzi scheme or minimum returns with
the kiosks.


Live long and prosper...

Author’s reply »  Surprisedguy,


The minimum guaranteed return promised to Franchisees is a fact. FAB promotes this in its franchised kiosks
sales brochure and FAB's Director of Franchisee Sales even sent my investigators a scanned copy of her
own franchisee side-agreement promising a minimum return on her investment. Remember, she is not only
the sales director, she is a franchisee too! I will publish her contract shortly. I would point out that the minimum
guaranteed return is memorialized in a side-agreement, typical in China. Like FAB's secret bond offering, the
minimum guarantee return side agreement was certainly hidden from FAB's US management and
independent directors.

Alfred,


You probably noted the following quote from the recent FAB PR release:


"FAB maintains that it has never entered into any agreement with an agent or licensee for a minimum return
guarantee or stock payment by the Company. Any communication to the contrary was unauthorized and is
unenforceable."

I believe FAB until the hired independent third party review report says different. I'm glad you will publish that
agreement, so the independent reviewer can include that in his/her analysis.


I will be interested to see what your agreement says. Hopefully, you will translate it. The truth is that
agreement, if authentic, means very little because it's hard to imagine a side agreement of any value if it is not
mentioned in the main agreement. It sounds to me as if there is something rotten in Denmark, and China
too... and I don't mean FAB. As a FU stock long person, some things cause me fear... snakes, spiders, and
undisclosed bonds... :) but a loose cannon of an employee and an allegation of minimum guaranteed return
does not phase me. Yawn! The idea that you can take one copy of an agreement and generalize it to a
population of many agents is a stretch. You can say what you want here. However, my thoughts are controlled
by the SA editors. Hopefully, this reply to your post will make it to light of day for reading.


Live long and prosper...

Author’s reply »  The side agreement is indeed referenced in the operating agreement. I don't believe FAB
franchisee sales director is a "loose cannon." She was very thorough, providing brochures, term sheet,
sample operating and franchising agreements, as well as her own executed agreements.

SurprisedGuy
Alfred,


If the side agreement is referenced in the operating agreement, then the side agreement IS part of the
operating agreement. FAB said in the recent PR release that it had internally gone through 75% of the
agreements (12,000k of 16,000k) and not seen any notice of minimum language), and this is to be verified by
an independent third party. Plus FAB said in the PR release, any such language would be unauthorized and
unenforceable. Perhaps an overzealous sales person added such language? Who knows... My money is on
the FAB explanation.


I don't mean to seriously say the FAB franchisee sales director is a loose cannon, but I have my doubts that a
decent employee would be providing all those documents without unusual motivations and circumstances.You
do not refer to her as a former FAB franchisee sales director, but her unprofessional sharing of materials is
grounds for dismissal in my book (assuming your story is true).


In my mind, FAB has covered this satisfactorily in its recent press release. Such "side" documents were not
authorized and are unenforceable. A money tree may has well been referred to in the documents...

Author’s reply »  The franchisee sales director wasn't violating any company policies. We approached her as
a potential franchisee, interesting in FAB's franchised media kiosks business opportunity. She very clearly
explained the minimum guaranteed return to us and then she provided us with copies of:


1) Sales Brochure - that promised a minimum guaranteed return on investment payable in cash or shares of
FU at a 20% discount to market. 
2) Franchisee agreement - that did not mention the promises of the sales brochure. The franchisee
agreements is supposedly what the Board is reviewing. 
3) Operating agreement - that references the side agreement and also guarantees the investor's investment. 
4) Side Agreement - that sets forth the minimum guaranteed return on investment, payable in cash or FU
stock at a 20% discount to market.

SurprisedGuy
Alfred,


Below, after my quick analysis, is a quote from your Face of Piracy article recently posted in SA. I try in this
post to make sense of the licensee side agreement terms reported by you, but it's tough given the language
and the incredible return on investment offered licensees. It starts out OK. #1 is simple enough... this is the
amount of licensee investment. However, I think there is a translation problem with #2. Did you mean FAB
promises the franchisee, or is the franchisee required to promise FAB, as you have it? With #3, it's unclear
how the sharing would take place, as this is not stipulated. Did you mean 50/50? As for #4, that is a big range
(1 1/2 to 5 - which is it?). Yes, it sounds generous, but how does that work? But #5 offers the really sweet
deal. Even though the profits the first two years have not yet paid off the original investment (only 60k profits
earned of the original 80k investment), per the list, FAB will buy the kiosk back for 200k to 500k RMB (which
is it?), so a minimum of a 150% profit margin in addition to the 75% profit from the operating profits the first
two years? And that's the minimum... the maximum of 500k would be over a 600% return (I calculate) within 2
years... in addition to the operating profit, and plus the minimum asset value of another 60,000k RMB. Talk
about a money tree! #7 is kind of the worst case scenario, only a 12.5% return for the 2-year period. How rare
sure things are... but here they are. Guaranteed high profits.... ?


How can this licensee side agreement be taken seriously when FAB has recently said in its PR Release that it
has entered in to no minimum agreements?


If this side agreement you discuss is not a fake, then who ever issued the agreement (FAB, FAB-related
company, etc.) would be obligated to pay outrageous rates to the kiosk licensees and people would be
standing in line the length of China to get in on this deal. Something is not right here...


In its recent PR release, FAB has denied any knowledge of a minimum agreement and will have an
independent reviewer verify that. So the origins of the "agreement" remain a mystery, but if it's legit, count me
in! Unfortunately, sure things are few and far between in life...


Quoted Alfred Little article follows with reported FAB licensee side agreement terms:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1886851-fab-where-are-your-beijing-media-kiosks 14/24


"The director of franchisee sales presented my investigator with this franchisee sales brochure that included a
basic term sheet that makes the following points: 
1. Franchisee shall invest 80,000 RMB per kiosk. 
2. Franchisee promises to achieve 20,000 RMB and 40,000 RMB profit targets in the first and second years,
respectively. 
3. FAB and the franchisee share any profit above these profit targets. 
4. FAB promises to buy back the kiosks at 1.5 to 5 times the accumulated profits over the first 2 years plus a
guaranteed minimum asset value. 
5. In the base case where the kiosk achieves the minimum profit target, FAB would buy it back for 200,000 -
500,000 RMB, using either cash or "free-trading" shares in "FU" 
6. In the event that profit targets are not met, FAB agrees to buy back each kiosk for 1.5 to 2 times the
guaranteed minimum asset value of 60,000 RMB. 
7. Using the lower multiple: 1.5 x 60,000 RMB = 90,000 RMB guaranteed minimum return of the 80,000
original investment per kiosk."

SurprisedGuy
Alfred,


This additional detail is helpful.


What I don't understand is this... As far as I know, the Franchisee Agreement is just that... the only legal
documentation of the agreement between the franchisee and FAB. I see your point that the Side Agreement
is mentioned in the Operating Agreement, but why is there a need for the Operating Agreement when there is
the Franchisee Agreement?


Is the Operating Agreement mentioned in the Franchisee Agreement? If not, I would tend to not give much
value to the other two agreements. These extra documents confuse the agreement.


The fact that FAB only reviewed in its internal review the Franchisee Agreement (and puts their finding open
to independent review) seems to point to the fact that the Operating Agreement is NOT referred to in the
Franchisee Agreement. That really makes these other two agreements highly questionable, and would be red
flags to any kiosk investors.


My best guess at this point, assuming your documents are authentic and true, is that the Sales Manager you
went through had created those extra documents to pump up sales. After all, why make a sweet deal sweeter
than it has to be. That side agreement you report is pure sugar. It sounds personally formulated, and not from
a business.


That said, let's see how this plays out... Two things are clearly true: 1) clearly these extra agreements do not
seem needed or right; and 2) the terms on the extra agreements are so overly advantageous (see my other
post) that if they were generally known would be the talk of China as an available money tree.


Live long and prosper....

FAB's explanation on the kiosks is a joke.


As stated in their filings under FAB franchise program: "the franchisor (FAB Culture) is responsible for the complete
set-up of each FAB outlet from the location selection to construction or conversion, remodeling and equipment
installation."


So FAB itself was responsible for everything from location selection to construction to installation of the kiosks?!?!?!?
Yet they can only verify that licenses have been sold?!?! Come on...

I'm not sure which some of you guys like more, being short or making up conspiracy theories. 
First off, I hear the argument one more time that FAB can't possibly be legit because you can't make money selling
movies for .13 cents I think I'll throw up. Spencer told Alfred directly FAB did not generate much revenue from movie
sales, end of story. Here is brief explanation of what a Kiosks can do: "Kiosks/Licensing - Out Intelligent Media Kiosks,

payments for utility bills, and credit card bills. " 
As for FAB being responsible for every aspect of every Kiosks, try digging a little deeper. FAB digital has been
licensing Kiosks since 2008, the franchise/license agreements you quote are since the acquisition (2012). The way I
read it is some of those original Kiosks were used just for lottery sales, and did not resemble the newer ones (heck,
even the ones now used in their main stores are being phased out). I have not read anywhere, nor has FAB stated,
that they were involved in the placement of the original Kiosks (at least 12K of them). So give FAB some time to figure
this out. My thinking is the same as always....follow the cash. If it's legit, then the business is legit. As for faking cash,
I understand how Longtop Financial pulled it off, bribing local bankers, but that trick only works one time. Surely FAB
knows this and has verified where all the cash is....and used the main office not some branch to check. In any event,
they must be certain or why open it up to the third party just to be blown apart? Also why would a Chinese company
pay 2.5M per year in to advertise on Kiosks that don't exist? The company name is on a FAB PR, pretty easy to track.
Give them a call. Let me know what you find out. 
As for the Ponzi scheme angle, give it a rest. First the Kiosks are fake, then if they're not fake the cash is fake. And if
the cash is not fake then it must be a Ponzi scheme? Is this the new short argument? Wonder what the next angle will
be when the third party checks the license agreements and discovers there is no guarantee on the buyback. 
For shorts sake, let's hope FAB is too stupid to announce just before it starts trading again that their BOD has
authorized a 10M dollar buyback of their shares.

does FAB need to publish a list of the kiosk locations, in Chinese, because English addresses wouldn't be

real. They are not.

FAB is not legit b/c you cannot make $ selling movies for $0.13 USD per movie. It's not even scaleable -
you're asking each customer to bring in a USB drive to copy the movie over? China has the internet - do it
that way.

other kiosks designed for non-media purposes such as lotto, ATM/bill-pay, travel, donation, etc. Maybe the
"other" style kiosks are not networked and managed by FAB, so that FAB will claim they therefore have no
idea where they are located.


12 Dec 2013, 12:47 PM


SurprisedGuy
Alfred,


I'm surprised you keep counting kiosks. :) FAB's recent PR release made it clear that FAB sells licenses for
kiosks, not kiosks (licensees buy the kiosks straight from the manufacturer). Not all kiosk licenses have a
deployed kiosk at this point in time. FAB's PR release did say though that the 2,xxxx (don't know exact
number) Beijing kiosks that you are interested are "deployed." Where, I don't know. I do agree with you that
FAB may not publish the list of locations. Clearly, publishing locations is not part of FAB's business plan. If
they do publish locations, it will be to make investors happy.

As best I remember the FAB publicly available literature, the Chinese company that services the kiosks is
NOT FAB. While this company may be fully or partially owned by some of the same people as FAB, it is
independent, and this design has the advantage of greatly reducing FAB operating expenses and associated
operating risks. I know you understand this as well as I do, so I am unsure why you keep saying that FAB is
servicing the kiosks, when it is not. Oh, saying this makes you short-money by allowing you to chip away at
investors' trust in FAB. OK, I see... :)

an undisclosed related party. FAB's Proxy filing with the SEC states:


“FAB licensing program is a merchant program that binds the FAB and each small investor or vendor. Under
this program and associated contract, both licensor and lincensee take their joint-business obligations as
follows:


1. The licensee pays for FAB Kiosk and other equipment and fixtures while the licensor (FAB Media) is
responsible for the complete set-up of each FAB outlet from the location selection to construction or
conversion, remodeling and equipment installation. 
2. All FAB outlets will be owned by the licensee, but supervised by a designated management company –

"...run the kiosks through 40 individual registered agents who are responsible for signing up licensees,
deploying the kiosks, and reporting the number of installed kiosks."


I think this is what FAB meant in its recent PR release that short traders lack a fundamental

I'm traveling in Asia and my internet connection is slow...but for gosh sakes, do your own research. Somewhere on

400 colleges and universities’ library teachers attend from all over China and experience FAB Library System
Intelligent Kiosks specifically designed for the university library to provide teachers, students and publishers with an

one tailored for the location and customers it serves.  
"The Media Kiosk technology is a proprietary platform with seven types of digital media kiosks. In addition to
expansion through the sale of franchises and membership cards, FAB was recently chosen to develop and deploy
specialized Intelligent Media Kiosks to create Wisdom City, the model for future intelligent urban design. This will
include Media Kiosks for Healthcare, Community Service, Commercial Super Chains and Libraries. The combination
of entertainment and digital media does represent an “iTunes in a Box” model for media distribution to mobile devices.
Management believes that replicating this model and expanding into other emerging markets worldwide provides the
basis for on-going growth of revenue and income for FAB Universal Corp." 
As I said, my internet is slow and I'm tried of sitting in the hotel waiting for the page to load instead of out playing golf.
If only one of FAB's Kiosks was nearby I could provide you with the "lottery" link, but it's not so you'll have to find that
one on your own. 
As for your kids conversation with FAB's "franchise director" and glossy brochure, stop relying on your kids riding
around on motor bikes with zero level of sophistication for your research. According to FAB's PR they sell Kiosks
licenses through 40 (count them, FORTY) INDEPENTDENT agents. So the one your kids talked to fired up her
printing press and added a little spice to pad her sales. Big news there! If they had any brains they'd ask her how her
individually owned Kiosks was doing. How much did make, how was she paid, is her territory exclusive, how often is
her site updated, does she personally place pirated content on her Kiosks, if she did would FAB know or even care?
But alas, you sent the kids out on the town and all they came back with was a glossy brochure! 
If you want to stay busy call that company (China Cultural Company...or something like that) that just signed a 2.5M
five year advertising deal for the Kiosks you claim don't exist and explain to them your conspiracy theory. I'm sure
they'll demand their money back. 
My thinking is always track the cash, and go backwards. If it's not there, then why? I'm long NQ for the same reason. 
Perhaps Mr. Rogers is right here and you are wrong. Is that possible? 
As a side note, I'm thinking about opening a chain of Pasta Restaurants over here. I'm thinking there's big money to
be made on Pasta in Asia. What do you think?

store? What the heck does that mean? She has an office in located somewhere in the store? I seriously doubt it, more
likely she met your kids there after a phone call. How is it that FAB states they use 40 "independent" agents to sell
licenses, yet this chick, according to you is the head of sales? And this is the girl that is going to guarantee you 500%
plus return on your money. Come on, no one with money to invest is that stupid. How did she respond to that
comment? But wait, you're kids didn't actually engage her in a two way conversation, they just reported what she
stated. 
I get the fact you need to come up with an angle to explain the cash...otherwise the logic follows if the cash is legit so
is the business. The ponzi scheme angle is nice attempt to explain the cash. I get it, it's not much, but you have throw
something out there or you're about to lose a lot of money when this opens for trading.

Very interesting. What fraction of Beijing did you search? If there really were 16,000 kiosks, how many would you
have expected to find using your method?

Author’s reply »  I expected FAB's website customer support hotline would be able to provide more than just
the 5 locations (with 20 kiosks). They could not. I also expected an internet search would turn up thousands
of kiosks, but it turned up 17 possible locations that had no kiosks. Those kiosks simply do not exist

Hmmmmmm
pls give us an update on the status of the FAB fraud case.

Author’s reply »  NYSE has been incredibly slow to delist FAB. I still expect it to be delisted any day.

In your honest opinion why has it not been de-listed? This is one of the strangest cases I have ever seen.The
stock has not traded since November 2013.

Author’s reply »  Frankly, I believe that the exchanges want to seem "fair" to Chinese companies and give
them the maximum possible amount of time to respond to fraud allegations. But most people agree that giving
FAB 8 months after it admitted secretly issuing bonds in China is a ridiculous amount of time. The "patience"
of the exchange is probably due to the tremendous desire by the exchanges to attract gigantic lucrative new
Chinese IPOs like Alibaba. Being "soft" of fraud makes the U.S. exchanges a much more desirable venue for
Chinese companies. It is completely unfair to investors, both long and short.

Hmmmmmm
Since you have experience investigating Chinese cases such as this, can you give any thoughts about investing in
Alibaba.


Reports I have read say the structure is very hard to follow, thus lending itself to fraud.

Author’s reply »  BABA should not implode in the foreseeable future. Any potential fraud there (and I am not
saying there is any) would be easily concealed and protected by their powerful Chinese government
connections for years to come.

Hmmmmmm
In these types of cases who will be charged? the officers, the directors? everyone who worked at FAB Universal must
have known the scope and depth of this scam.


Your reports leave little doubt, this was a scam.


It seems there was an effort to deceive; the accounting firm was dismissed, then the company hires a firm to conduct
an "independent investigation" 
One of the directors bought a 10K of shares


Do you follow up on these cases that you have uncovered? what happens to the CEO and others who must have
known and been involved?

Author’s reply »  The Chinese perpetrators have never been punished in any way (maybe they lose their right
to travel to the US?). U.S. officers and directors have faced some minor consequences. Hopefully FAB's U.S.
management and directors will be held accountable.
