Sep. 1, 2010 9:06 AM ET70 comments | Includes: China-Bi…


Yesterday and throughout the night, I hired private investigators and other
Shanghai residents to visit certain of the "stores" at the addresses provided by
the company yesterday. These investigators were told to (i) visit the locations
at the specified addresses, (ii) identify whether the addresses refer to
standalone stores, (iii) take photos from outside the locations, (iv) enter the
stores and request to see the company's nutritional supplements products,
(v) to the extent possible, take photos of the locations of the company's
products and (vi) write a brief account of each location in terms of what they
saw. 
 
I will publish an initial account from one of these Shanghai residents below,
who visited three of the addresses provided by the company. I have disclosed
his name and email address to Seeking Alpha's editors for independent
verification. I will publish additional accounts as they come in. 
 
But first, I want to address a note that came out from Robert Hsu last night
responding to the post by Citron Research. I have little regard for the
recommendations of and diligence performed by Robert Hsu. He wrote a
similar piece on Orient Paper after Muddy Waters LLC published its initial
report on ONP. Subsequent to his report, the leading business newspaper of
China, 21st Century Business Herald, wrote a separate front-page article
documenting Orient Paper's fraud, and adding additional relevant points
indicating that Orient Paper is falsifying its SEC financial statements. We also
found out that Orient Paper's top supplier is an empty shell owned by the
company's CEO, and that as of June 2009, it somehow had acquired 2m
shares of ONP, or about 4% of the company's outstanding shares.

Ample evidence has come out demonstrating that Orient Paper is a fraud, and
Robert Hsu's note did a disservice to investors subscribing to his newsletter. I
see the same poor level of diligence in his latest note on China-Biotics.  
 
In particular, I'm concerned with his following unfounded comment, which,
based on preliminary indications from our private investigators, will be
demonstrated to be patently false by the end of the week. 
 
"This morning, the short seller continues to accuse that some of the stores
listed on CHBT website are actually hotels or supermarkets. Actually,
according to our source in Shanghai, CHBT places some stores in
supermarkets or hotels, similar to how we sometimes see McDonald's in a
Walmart or a Burger King in a shopping mall." 
 
That's just not true, Mr. Hsu. Not only does the company not own standalone
stores at many of its disclosed locations, which is clearly what its SEC filings
imply, but it doesn't even own stores-within-a-store at many of the locations.  
 
I will begin the day with the following account that I received last night from
one of the Shanghai residents who investigated several of the stores for us. I
have disclosed his name and contact information to Seeking Alpha editors.  
 
"I went to visit three locations so far. Mostly in Yangpu District and what I can
confirm is there arent any retail outlets present for CHBT. There could be shelf
space in the supermarket but that's a very different matter. Specifically, 102
Zhongyuan Road, Yangpu District and 1750 Changyang Road, Yangpu District
are two super markets operated under the brand name Oushang. 
 
The supermarkets do have separate stores inside them that sells clothes, food,
even nutritional products. I personally walked around those two stores
thoroughly and could find no signs of CHBT stores. The one on Changyang
Road is right by home so I frequent there all the time. While I could not find
the Shining stores, I was able to find a store that's called Natural Elements, a
direct brand name under Shanghai Jiaoda Onlly Corp. I had a phone
conversation with one of the managers and am pretty sure the store has
nothing to do with CHBT. Also btw, after talking with the sales clerk, she said

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/90918-chbt-store-verification-results-start-rolling-in 3/39


they on average make 30-50k RMB on a monthly basis for revenue, that
translates into 4-6k USD a month. Noted, that's a retail space not shelf space.
The places I went are much more of a prime location with significant traffic
flow and tons of ppl walking in the mall. I would really expect places in
Baoshan and others to have much less flow therefore less revenue. So now
you count on a quarterly basis, this store can generate maybe 15k, you need
100 of these to generate 1.5mil...the reported 25mil number, you would be
looking at 1800 retail outlets in a city like Shanghai. That roughly illustrates on
a scale's perspective, their operation through retail distribution is very much
unlikely to build up revenues. 
 
Its a lot harder for me to prove the nonexistence of a retail store in a huge
shopping mall of course other than putting my name behind this. But I think
it's helpful to look at things from a scale's perspective. Even if they do have
the 100 retail stores they claim to have, their revenue numbers are still
unlikely at least from the conversations I had with the sales reps. In any case,
I'm completely convinced that this company is a complete hoax. I took some
photos but those are of the other brand name stores that are apparently
unrelated, so I don't think it would be of any value for you guys. But i think
you can upload it and cite the numbers I quoted you guys as a comp to
illustrate the point. 
 
Also I'd like to point out for you guys the severe lack of seasonality in these
numbers. In China, most of the sales of these types of products happens right
around the Chinese new year when people go around to visit relatives. The
sales should really account for a huge percentage of the annual sales just
because thats when people actually buy that kind of stuff to give out as gifts.
To have a roughly flat sales in the first and second quarter is simply telling,
you will never see that if the reporting is regular. 
 
Again, given the difficulty of proving the nonexistence of a store, I think
focusing on the ability of revenue generation will prove to be fruitful. Like I
said, even if all the stores are real, which they are not, you still cannot be
selling at that levels. To get credible verification however, you will need to get
data from various supermarkets and see what volume of its products are
actually being sold...but again, i cannot imagine a tiny shelf space in a
supermarket or pharmacy can reasonably outsell a separate store inside."

summary after meeting the management,
seeing the plant, and visiting the stores?


You do know these stores are only 8% of
their revenues.... and you seem to focus
on just that... again fishy business.


Also... nice of you to throw a comment on
ONP which has nothing to do with this

As for the stores being only 8% of
revenue, I'm just addressing this 8% of
revenue now. We'll get to other
evidence that the company is a fraud
over time. I published compelling
evidence yesterday that CHBT is
fabricating its numbers per the SEC-AIC
comparison yesterday.


The ONP reference was to Robert Hsu's
memo. He's doing a disservice to you
because he's not doing sufficient
diligence. His comment about the stores
is an outright lie. Our investigators
visited over 30 stores yesterday. We'll
be publishing the results once they're
ready. He should have sent
investigators to the stores prior to
publishing his memo.

On the other hand you can send

Agreed, his purpose for posting these
blogs is to try to profit from his short
positions by continually distorting the
truth. Then, he tries to through something
in his blogs about his other shorts so that
they appear on the other pages and if get
published, sometimes show up as an
article on the others. I do not know much
about CHBT so I cannot comment on the
specifics of the claims, but CCA continually
follows suit after a random attack article
comes out on a company.


Also, if you look back on CCA's blogs and
articles he states several times how ONP's
AIC documents do not match the SEC
filings and he has copies to prove it and he
uses the AIC documents as proof of fraud.
The thing is that ONP's AIC and SEC

documents do match and that is why he
will not bring up this issue with ONP
anymore. Then in his latest article, he tries
to discredit the office that ONP's AIC
documents come from. At the same time,
he created an article on ONP's top supplier
Xushui County Dongfang Trading Company
Limited and used their AIC filings, but I
believe they come out of the same region.


Then CCA wants to act as if ONP's top
supplier does not exist yet in the
document he provided for 2007(which is
another topic), it shows the supplier with
over $21 million in payables and over $28
million in total assets, but because he
cannot access their info for 2008 and 2009
he wants to state they are a shell. Where
did the $28 million in assets go? They
obviously still exist and the auditor verfies
their top customer.


He continually states distorted facts and
points of view to benefit himself and scare
others. It is a joke and hopefully others
are catching on to his and some of the
other shorts games.

So you argue that they would need 1800
retail stores to generate the 25 million in

take into account that only 7.8% of that

"stores", the company means shelf

The fact that the only place you and Citron
can find to base your short attack on is
what type of retail 'store' is really a 'store'
for a company that is winding down its 8%
retail segment is a strong argument for
CHBT. I mean this is it? Such a weak
attack actually makes CHBT look stronger.

Author’s reply »  That's not true. Citron
mentioned numerous other reasons in
his article. I spent a long article and a

CHBT is a fraud. I'll get to other
evidence in the future.

That said, saying that 8% of the
revenue doesn't matter is silly. If 8% of
the company is a fraud, that's not the
best of signs for what the other 92% of
the company is.


Personally, I believe that CHBT is a
complete hoax. It's not even like CMFO,
which actually sells some product and
showed $7m of revenue in its AIC
filings. We're seeing less than $1m of
revenue. Believe it or not, I don't think
anyone's buying their probiotics shining
essence nutritional supplements.


They're trying to build a bulk additives
business to put together a more
sensible real business. But they used
fabricated numbers from an extremely
tiny nutritional supplements business to
raise the money to build their bulk
additives facility.

You source states: "after talking with the
sales clerk, she said they on average make
30-50k RMB on a monthly basis for
revenue, that translates into 4-6k USD a
month." That actually translates into
$4,400 to $7,360 per month.


In the latest 10-Q, management states
that their retail outlets were 13% of retail
sales. Retail sales were 60% of overall
sales in Q1. Overall sales in Q1 were $24.9
million. Therefore, retail sales were $14.96
million. Of the retail sales number, 13%
came from outlet stores, for a total of
$1.945 million in sales. There were 103
outlets at the end of June 30, which
translates into $18,882 in sales per outlet
during the quarter. If you take $18,882

and divide by 3 to get it a monthly basis,
you get $6,294 in monthly sales per
outlet, which is in the range of $4,400 to

realized that retail outlet stores only
represented 7.8% of overall sales.

I'll get to the other 92% of sales. Right

its claim that it owns more than 100

I mean, come on, this is getting absurd.
You're defending a company that says it

I don't know how someone can say
'hey, the fact that 8% of their sales are

You may want to improve your detective

you publish your blog/articles. The whole
"investigation" seem to be very rushed,
primitive, and not convincing at all. You do
not have to publish anything in such a
rushed manner. Unless, your goal is not
the truth but the time to cover your short.


1) CHBT use the word sales "outlet" in
their filings. Being traveled into China
before, I mentally translated the word
"outlet" into a counter or designated shelf
within a store, which to me makes more
sense from business model perspective.
Why do you/Citron kept suggesting that
the company uses stand-alone stores, and
the discredited the company then you can
not find them. Retail space in Shanghai is
very expensive. CHBT is a small
manufacture and even huge manufacturers
in China do not own retail stores. 
2) Have you translated CHBT's
name/brand into proper Chinese? CHBT, or
even Shining are US English. When you
talk to your Shanghai "investigators", what
procedures do you take to prevent "lost in
translations"? 
3). Have your "investigators" ever tried to
call the company when they could not find

You hit the nail on the head. OUTLETS
are not stores. Period. CHBT's 10-Q and
10-K never say stores. The outlets can
be stores, but they can also be stand
alone counters within a department or
grocery store. I worked for a large
retailer and the Cigarette companies
actually rented (paid a lot of money) an
area of the store to show off their
product. Of course it was locked and we
had the key to get the cig cartons.
Many companies pay for counter space
at big retail department stores.

Yes, I did receive an email from CCA.
He shared with me a quote that he said
he received from a competitor. Of
course, the quote was anonymous. I do
not believe the quote as it made no
sense to me. However, if CCA wants to
provide me with a name and phone
number, I will be happy to follow-up
with any competitor to CHBT.

The detective reported he could not find a
store within a store in some supermarkets.
He did not look to see if the store was a
distribution outlet by checking for stock on
the shelf.


did not check the shelves for stock.


couldnt disprove the the existence in malls
either since your detective would "have to
disclose his identity".


So do you count those mall disrtibution
outlets as fraud since it is hard to prove
their non existence also?


Good job!!!

The "PI" checked 3 supermarkets for mini

Do you count those "unable to disprove

My guess there is a language issue here .
The stores do vary in nature and are
probably all serviced and some owned
without middlemen thus considered as
direct outlets.

Seems that the longs are practicing
revisionist history. CHBT has represented
the sales channel frequently as being
made up of stand alone retail outlets.


2007 10-K......We opened our first store in
Shanghai in March 2006, and plan to open
additional Shining stores in Beijing,
Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shenyang,
Harbin and Heilongjiang. We intend to
open over 300 stores over the next two
years. At the end of March 2007, we had
opened a total of nine stores in 
Shanghai.


2008 10-K ....sale of our products to the
other metropolitan cities in China through
a combination of the traditional 
distribution channels and dedicated
Shining stores. From March 2006, when
we opened our first store in Shanghai, 
we have a total of 60 stores as of March

Jason "The Evader" Nevader...."Given the

You will also notice that the link Jason had

looks like CHBT pulled the list of stores
from the web site. Now we can't even find
the store in their imagination.


The retail outlets do not exist. They never

years was a complete fabrication. They

Value Bulldog, Contributor
It is truly stunning that people seem to be
satisfied with possible retail shelf space
instead of an actual store. The company's
disclosures clearly differentiate between
retail shelf space (sold through
distributors) and company-run outlets
(where they sell directly to end users).


From the company's most recent 10-K:


"We have historically reached consumers
by selling our products to large
distributors, who then sell them through
their networks to supermarkets,
hypermarkets, such as Wal-Mart, and drug
stores, where they are purchased by
consumers. As of March 31, 2010, we had
111 Shining branded outlets in Shanghai
and 12 other major cities in China where
we sell our products directly to the end
users. We believe owning distribution
channels and having direct access to the
end users will become a significant entry
barrier in the future."


01 Sep 2010, 03:38 PM


Sedric
When you don't use middlemen it is a a
direct sale store. In retailing a direct store
is one where the company buys from the
manufacture shipped directly to them not
a wholesaler or cooperative . When
Kellogg's sells directly to Safeway ships to
Safeway that is a direct store sale. When a
small grocer buys a case of cornflakes
from Certified Grocers of California , a
huge cooperative for small grocers that is
not a direct sale by Kellogg. That is the
jargon of the trade. I think language is a
barrier used in a short attack. The issue is
a distribution shelf for product, not its
name.

I am wrong about the list of stores/...I

Right underneath the full color picture of
what CHBT describes as a "retail outlet" . I
was taken with the doors on the front of
the space and large street signs. The
display window has a very large smiley
picture of (I am sure) healthy users. I kept
looking but I can't seem to find the
shelving. I am easily confused but why
would they show a picture of a 400-500
square foot storefront location if they
really meant that an "outlet" was 3
shelves?

Just a few more thoughts here regarding
this subject and nomenclature. I have a
business minor in Food Marketing
Management from USC some years ago as
well as a degree in accounting.


I do think we have a trade language and
communication barrier that is baring us to
understand some of the raised concerns.


Concerning retail outlets. You may not be
aware that many isles in an Albertsons
food store is rented to another retailer. It
is not known publicly to the average
shopper. All he sees in buying non foods
items at Albertsons is the same UPC tag on
the shelf from which he or she grabs. That
is not a sale to Albertsons but the tenet
accurately recorded by the scanner at the
check stand.

To the company who rents that space that
is a direct retail outlet. What matters to
owners is how many stores are we in and
how are sales?


As to branded products General Mills is
concerned with market penetration of
Cheerios- the percent of available outlets
that carry its 
branded product Cheerios and its percent
of total sales in the Cereal category.
General mills may sell unbranded also such
as Cosco round oats, a fictional example.
CHBT may be selling unbranded products
under private label . If so CHBT should
exclude those sales from branded sales
stores. I have no idea if the do any private
label products for retailers.


I think the distinction here, which really
doesn't matter, as regards to total sales, is
CHBTis distinguishing sales made thru
distributors or brokers and retail accounts
they service directly without broker or
wholesaler taking a piece of the action. It
appears that this activity takes many
forms ,from some small storefronts to
displays or shelf space in supermarkets
etc. If they have special retail placement
spots they probably pay rent for the
premiere merchandising opportunity like
many products do in American stores. You
dont think Coke gets the end display cap
for no consideration to the store owner do
you.


Market channels will change daily, some go
up or down, but in the end, to the product
manufacturer how many outlets are open
and the volume of the sales per outlet
matter. I will take 5 good bulk customers
or a few dozen Walmarts over whatever
direct outlet sales CHBT currently realizes.
With wholesalers and bulk sales why

All good information but CHBT never
described anything even vaguely
resembling your scenario. The
underlying issue is that CHBT lied about
the existence of stores. It is a very
pained contortion to now speculate that
they were talking about anything other
than stand alone store front dedicated
retail outlets. They use exactly that
language in describing what they
operated. They prersent a full color
picture on their web site with the tag
"Retail Outlet" It is only now that the
apologists see how obscure they can be
to somehow make the previous CHBT
claims fit the newly revealed reality.


They are lying. They don't have the
revenue. They don't have the money.

In the second picture they clearly

makes it transparently clear that they
are making arrangements with the

The description of the retail sales model
has changed from the 2007 plan noted
by Special K above to a new one
described by CHBT itself in its more
recent SEC filings. The strategy has
changed focus to relying on distributors
and bulk customers. It does not claim
to have 103 unique branded Company
owned storefronts.. It claims 103
branded outlets. To me it says in 103
places you can shop where we have
"Shining" branded products on display
and that we manage this product
channel. My background doesn't imply
to me they own 103 stores on July 30
2010. I recognize it is a distinction
others may readily not pick up on. But
CHBT does not claim to own 103 stores.


If there are better methods to distribute
product I hope they get out of this
smaller channel and focus management
on the growth areas.

from a CHBT presentation. Does your
flexible mind believe that these stores
have morphed into outlets and no

matter”). Now that is a real thorough

01 Sep 2010, 06:22 PM


Sedric
During the 2006 time period to 2010 my
guess is they could have a 100% turnover
of outlets as they developed an operating
strategy from ground zero. I hope some of
these early outlets are what we know as
Kiosks.. For example,they could have
owned/ rented 175 stores, tents, kiosks at
one time and now own 20 directly and had
,on July 30, 83 other retail outlets selling
the Shining brand in one form or another
that they were responsible for, not a
distributor. We don't know from the public
data. We know one "PI " is having trouble
finding them and doesn't bother to check
the stores he visits for a shelf space
channel check. Hiring a food broker to to
the channel check would be more accurate
as they know how to find product in
stores. That Is what they do for a living.


I think we should rely on current claims as
to operations today ,not those as to a
location location in 2006-2007. I don't
think anyone is going to PI what outlets
existed in 2007.


Someone should go look at the tax
collection records. That should clear up
any doubts. Just don't go send that PI will
you.

replace them with shelves in somebody

You seem to forget the reason for this
exercise. CHBT responds to Citron's
charge that they have no stores by
posting a list of 100 addresses.
Someone (CCA) is having people go to
each of those locations and take
pictures. You are rhetorically excusing
CHBT for whatever is found.


Granted the size of the revenue is not
crucial but the misleading presentation
of the retail operation hints very
strongly that the bulk sales are equally
misrepresented.


The ultimate issue is whether the sales
occured or not and it is clear to me that
CHBT does not sell the product they
claim. Retail or wholesale.

different direction of focus or better
opportunity.Remember HP selling off HP

better?. HP test equipment was the

JP Morgan is closing its proprietary

20 % after 6 months. Guess why? To
make more money elsewhere. Learning.
I think they are smart to do so.


The best outcome is good volume sales
without the management hassles of a

they have been heading for some time.

How about an admission that an
itinerary (the basic itinerary is out there
for anyone that can read English)
doesn't take 17 days to complete?


Best of luck working at re/max.

MM,


you have no shame and are a fraud.
Your complete disregard to my serious
and honest reply is proof of that.


I will never ever again reply to your
posts or consider them . It is my error
that I took you seriously in the first
place.


And Seeking Alpha should ban you, and
others like you, from this blog that to
the best of my knowledge tries to
promote rational and meaningful
exchange between its participants.

So I guess ur talking about the
conference call?


R they going to conference call every
investor who has questions?


Grayling has already called me and
emailed me twice. I see no need to
have a conference call with the Grayling
guy who identified himself as Snow
White.


Soooo, go ruffle someone elses feathers
cause you have no effect on me. Got

No response from mmonday. Not even

Way to call him out and reveal his lies.


I do suppose more lies may come, but
when a liar speaks, he speaks lies.

A poster on a yahoo finance board says she
called these two stores and they verified that
they do stock Shining brand probiotics.

If someone else would verify the phone #s
posted in the thread and make a call to verify
her post it would be nice. Perhaps also getting
some clarification on whether it is an outlet or
not would also be nice.

The 2 locations are associated with the
Auchun Grocery Store company 
translate.google.com/t...|en&tbb=1&ie=g...


It would appear that they have numerous
independent vendors using this same
address and I would assume they rent
space inside the store. CHBT is not among
the sub-tenants listed. The sub-tenant list
identifies several of the companies as
having numerous outlets (obviously not all
at this address) so the usefullness is
somewhat limited.


If you are long and a supporter this will
certainly qualify as an outlet. If you aren't
adequately forgiving of how "store" is

defined this is trivial shelf space inadequate
to generate any significant sales.


The second location is not as helpful in
suggesting subtenants. It does confirm that
it is also a Auchun grocery. The phone
number that was used to confirm the CHBT
sales was not a store. It appears to be the
main office for the regional? operation.

How do you know what is sufficient store
space to generate meaningful revenue?


For years the most lucrative revenue
generating piece of real estate in the US
supermarket was that 6 inch wide space on
the shelf that stocked Hidden Valley Ranch
Dressing in the foil pouch *you mix your
own" stuff. That little space- highest
revenue in the store per foot. Lots of high
dollar sales in a small space.


As you say it is not really the issue of
nomenclature- it is the sales that is the
bottom line.


The "what is an outlet / store" is a red
herring. I could care less if it was a pair of
sawhorses and a sheet of plywood that
constitutes an outlet. I am interested in
branded products that gross big revenues
per sale growing in demand.

If the 10-Ks, press releases, company
presentations, full color location shots, and
star analysts had reflected a 6 inch display
case next to the lettuce that would be fine.
They didn't. They explicitly said stores not

shelves. The 10-K identifies several
hundred "retail" employees (who are very
hard to fit on the shelf next to the
dressing)


In the final analysis the volume will be the
test. In the mean time I can tell when
someone is pissing on my boots and
claiming it is rain. These guys told the
world they had stores and now the
apologists scramble away from the clear
meaning of that word. Store morphs to
counter to shelf to 6 inch tray. Soon your
interpretation of store will include modified
Chiclettes machines. CHBT could have
easily and accurately described whatever in
the hell they have and saved you major
effort in salad dressing up the fibs.


I still don't know what they consider an
outlet? Apparently its anything you want it
to be.


Are we to expect this same type of
discussion over semantics when it turns out
there are no bulk sales contracts? And no
customers. "Bulk is any size I care to define
after the fact" "Sales don't have to be paid
for, just sold." "Customers don't have to
actually buy from us, they just have to buy.
They are potential customers"

The right way to solve this issue is to
determine if approximately 1100 outlets
can sell, on average about $1000 of
wholesale priced product per week. That's
not semantics, that is how it works at the
bottom line. As I said any venue works for
me. Waldo you seem the one to have the
semantics problem inferring outlets should
be stores.Seems you missed that in the

financials statements. Whoops! Just trying
to help you along here.


How they bean count employees to is
interesting. Doesn't change the bottom
line .Do they use project accounting? Do
they allocate all labor but for R@D and
wholesale to the stores? Good question.
Ask it at the Visit day. Write to them. Why
did they add the new employees this year?
To dress up a fraud or do they just park
more cars in the lot each day.

Maybe we need to get an early start on
the next round.


What is a distributor?


It seems that all the "outlets" in these
grocery stores should have been
originated by distributors. The 28 hard
working distributors are getting cut out
of the retail chain. It seems that we will
now witness 28 distributors morph into
outlets. Or is the other way around. An
outlet is a distributor so the 110 outlets
includes all of the 28 distributors?


Since the topic is predictably next, do
you want to speculate on why CHBT is
in direct competition with the large
distributors who generate 80+ of the
business? How keen is the large
distributor (selling to Wal-Mart no less)
going to be when he discovers CHBT
has created outlets/stores/shelves/6
inch racks in one of the local grocery
chains, Auchun?


Back when CHBT had stand alone
stores/outlets with the highly trained
retail staff of hundreds it was plausible
that distributors would handle the multi

thousand retail locations. Kind of like
Sysco. The industry used to say that
Sysco wore out a truck every day just
getting Hidden Valley dressing to the 6
inch shelves.


If CHBT is already in the grocery stores
what are the 28 distributors doing all
day long? Maybe they are limited to
selling to bulk customers. Or ag
customers. Or Hidden Valley.


Don't distributors normally handle retail
outlets like Auchun?

Distribution in China is still very
fragmented. There are many trading
companies here engaged in the
business of buying goods wholesale
from manufacturers and selling them
through retail outlets. I'm thinking
about starting one myself. The
difference is obvious... either CHBT
oversees distribution to points of sale,
or it sells to other companies that
oversee distribution to points of sale.
It's not that hard to understand. What
do the distributors do all day? transport
goods from the factory to various
locations throughout the surrounding
provinces.
