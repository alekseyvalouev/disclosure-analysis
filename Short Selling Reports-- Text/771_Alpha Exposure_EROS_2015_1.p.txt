Unlike The Name, Investors Should Not Love EROS

Summary


Due to aggressive accounting practices, EROS' reported earnings are significantly
overstating the economic reality of its business model.


EROS' subsidiary financials reveal a lack of free cash flow and raise many questions
about the company’s accounting.


The company has enriched its controlling family at the expense of shareholders
through a series of related-party transactions.


Eros Now is poorly positioned to win the battle for streaming media in India and
appears to have made meaningful misstatements to investors.


Based on the company's persistent negative free cash flow and growing debt and
share count, we believe the stock is worthless.


Eros International PLC (NYSE:EROS) ("Eros PLC") is a leading distributor of Indian
language films. The company also operates a nascent streaming business known as Eros
Now. While the company claims it has grown revenue and operating income, its consistent
lack of free cash flow tells a different story. Digging into the company's foreign subsidiaries
and accounting policies reveals that the reported numbers are a mirage and that the
company has misled investors about its financial results and financial health. Finally, we
believe the company has lied to investors about the content available on Eros Now and its
user metrics. Our research suggests Eros Now is late to enter the streaming market,
which already has numerous competitors. The competitive position of Eros Now is only
likely to worsen once Netflix launches. We believe EROS is most likely worthless or worth
only a small fraction of its current market value, and our analysis shows that:


1. Due to aggressive accounting practices, EROS' reported earnings are
significantly overstating the economic reality of its business model. 80% of its
COGS and 57% of its total operating expenses are the amortization of its film library.
EROS' accounting policy for amortization is more aggressive than its U.S. peers
despite the fact that piracy more meaningfully impairs the longer-term value of the
company's assets. Also, we believe that EROS' policy is counter to the matching
principle; there is very little revenue earned from these assets beyond the year of

theatrical release. We think economic profits are significantly lower than reported
profits.


2. EROS' subsidiary financials reveal a lack of free cash flow and raise many
questions about the company's accounting. More than 100% of the revenue
growth, representing about one third of total revenue now, is being earned in the
United Arab Emirates. In addition, while the British Virgin Islands, Singaporean, and
Mauritian subsidiaries show significant revenue growth, the growth in accounts
receivable reveals that the company generates no cash despite its reported
profitability. Furthermore, the company appears to be capitalizing costs. There has
been a rapid and unexplained increased in capex in the last year. The company has
only been able to stay afloat by issuing stock and taking on debt. This is not
sustainable.


3. The company enriches its family management team through related-party
transactions and by appointing numerous family members to management
positions. We believe a tangled web of inter-related companies has enabled related-
party transactions and high salaries for family members. In order to fund the related-
party transactions, the company has repeatedly raised equity. Put simply, the
controlling family is enriching itself at the expense of shareholders.


4. EROS has numerous warning signs of poor financial controls, such as
employing a tiny auditor for its most important subsidiaries. An auditor consisting
of what appears to be only a few people with no visible website and a Gmail email
address has been auditing at least 9 subsidiaries in places as disparate as Mumbai,
BVI, Mauritius, Singapore, and the Isle of Man. It recently quit as the auditor for at
least one subsidiary. Furthermore, EROS already had its NYSE admission delayed
one and a half years due financial reporting and control issues. In addition, the CFO of
Eros PLC resigned May 2015 and the CFO of Eros International Media Ltd ("EIML")
resigned November 2014.


5. Eros Now is losing the battle for streaming movies in India and its position will
only get worse because Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) plans to launch in India. The bull
case regarding EROS revolves around the concept that Eros Now will be the Netflix of
India. We think this is a pipe dream due to well-funded competitors, an abundance of
available low-cost pirated content, and a poor broadband infrastructure. In reality, there
are already other streaming services that are more popular than Eros Now, and Netflix
is coming to India soon. Eros Now has misrepresented key facts to investors, is
already losing the battle for relevance to competing sites, and lacks the brand,
financial resources, and technical expertise to compete with Netflix.

Conclusion: We believe that EROS is mostly accounting fiction and that both its revenues
and profits have been vastly overstated. The growth in accounts receivable indicates that
the company has been unable to collect its reported revenue and aggressive accounting
policies have flattered the company's reported profits, which would be much lower if the
company had kept its prior accounting policies in place.


EROS' Aggressive Accounting: Film Costs


The profitability for EROS depends on how much revenue can be generated from a given
film relative to the cost EROS incurs to gain control of that content. According to the
Accounting Standards Codification for Film Entertainment (ASC 926), an entity should
amortize the capitalized film costs on an individual-film-forecast-computation method. The
costs should be amortized at the same ratio as the current-period actual revenue to the
expected ultimate revenue. Ideally, the amortization results in a constant yield at the
individual film level. If there is a negative change to the expected ultimate revenue, a
write-down of the unamortized asset should occur immediately.


Accordingly, all U.S. peers disclose a breakdown of the asset in terms of Released Films,
Films in Production, Films in Development, and Product Inventory. Once a film is released,
the company begins to amortize the asset. The companies typically provide clear
guidance as to their planned amortization. For example, DreamWorks (NASDAQ:DWA)
anticipates amortizing 50% of its Released Films asset during the first 12 months, and
83% over the following 3 years. MGM Studios (OTC:MGMB) anticipates amortizing 85%
of its Released Film asset over the first 3 years. Twenty-First Century Fox
(NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) anticipates amortizing 64% of its Released Film asset
during the first 12 months, and 90% over the next 3 years.


During the first year, EROS claims that it amortizes 50% of high-budgeted films' costs and
40% of medium- and low-budgeted films' costs. In contrast to U.S. peers, EROS amortizes
the portion of its film costs that are not amortized in the first year over a nine-year period
(from years 2-10). By stretching out the amortization period from three years to nine years,
EROS is able to significantly reduce the expenses it flows through its income statement. It
also inflates the assets and equity line items on its balance sheet. Interestingly, the
company changed its amortization policy in fiscal 2010 to be more aggressive and to show
higher earnings. At the time, there was no explanation given for the decision to adopt such
an aggressive new accounting policy. Prior to fiscal 2010, after the year of a film's release,
the remaining capitalized film content costs were amortized evenly over a maximum of
four years (Source, see Page 55 of 20-F/A, section: Intangible Assets).

It is important to consider the differences between the US film industry and the Indian film
industry when determining the amortization policy that is most appropriate for EROS.
Notably, pirated content is ubiquitous in India, which significantly shortens the life cycle of
films when compared to films in the US. In India, it takes as little as 12 weeks after a film
is released in theaters for high-quality black-market copies to become widely available. As
a result, very few parties will pay a significant amount of money for rights to a title 6-8
months post-release, much less years later. This means that a film production company
needs to amortize its film development costs quickly in order to accurately reflect the value
of a film on its balance sheet. It also means that a company like EROS should have an
amortization policy that is even more front-loaded than a typical US company. Even the
company's pre-2010 policy of amortizing the remaining balance after year one over four
years may have been too aggressive because revenues after year one are often
insignificant.


The following table shows that EROS has consistently overstated its operating profit by
more than 60% once we apply its historic amortization policy from 2009 and before.


Note: Transfer to film and content rights for 2007 and 2008 are not available in the
financials. Assumes $90 million in 2007 and $95 million in 2008.

Under the pre-2010 amortization policy, Diluted EPS for fiscal-year 2015 would have been
14.4 cents, 80% lower than reported.


The company's amortization of intangible assets is not just aggressive when it comes to
amortization periods, but it also appears that the company may not be taking write-downs
when it produces films that fail commercially. The following chart shows the box-office
verdict of the major Bollywood releases of late 2014 and early 2015 (Source). EROS
produced two of the "flops" (Shamitabh and Action Jackson), which are defined as movies
losing more than 50% of the initial investment. EROS also produced one of the "losers"
(Tevar), which is defined as a film that has losses less than 50% of the initial investment.
Despite producing what are almost certainly money-losing films, EROS has never
disclosed or quantified any impairment charges related to movies that failed in the box
office. This appears to be consistent with the company's pattern of under-expensing
amortization.

EROS' Aggressive Accounting: Negative Free Cash Flow, Ballooning Accounts
Receivable & Subsidiary Financials


The company's trade and other receivables have been mushrooming. From 6/30/14 to
6/30/15, EROS booked revenue of $289 million. Over that same period, trade and other
receivables increased $93 million. In other words, 32% of EROS' booked revenue wasn't
actually received in cash. Days sales outstanding now stand at 403 days, which is an
increase of 145 days from its level on 6/30/2014. As a result of the company's inability to
collect receivables and its high capital investment, free cash flow has been negative for
the past four years and fiscal-year 2016 looks to be no different.

We have also examined the financials of many of EROS' subsidiaries. Interestingly, $41
million, or 45% of the company's trade and other receivables growth during fiscal-year
2015, was derived from three subsidiaries. Further, the receivables that were overdue for
a period exceeding 6 months grew by $56 million at these three subsidiaries. The three
largest subsidiaries show significant receivable increases in the most recent fiscal year,
including those overdue for a period exceeding 6 months. Copsale Limited's other current
liabilities (advances from customer) increased from ₹0 at fiscal year 2014 to over ₹4.7
billion at fiscal year 2015 (Source). The auditor of these three subsidiaries, Anil Jagetiya &
Co., recently resigned from auditing Eros Digital Private Ltd. It is unclear if it is still the
auditor of these three subsidiaries or if it resigned from them as well. As can be seen in
the tables below, the accounts receivable balances have been rapidly increasing and, in
some cases, the growth in accounts receivable from one year to the next has actually
increased by more than the total revenue recorded. This should be an accounting
impossibility.

Copsale Limited's trade receivables increased nearly ₹2 billion, which represents
approximately 65% of the revenue booked during the period. A new account, other current
liabilities (advances from customer), was created this year and increased from ₹0 on
3/31/2014 to over ₹4.7 billion on 3/31/2015. A new account for inventory also appeared on
the balance sheet in 2015. This new ₹1.35 billion asset has also flowed onto Copsale's
income statement, greatly reducing its expenses and increasing its profitability.


Digicine's trade receivables increased ₹412 million, which represents approximately 83%
of revenue booked during the period (Source). The majority of this increase came from
receivables overdue for a period exceeding 6 months. On Digicine's income statement,
amortization of film rights fell 67%, despite an increase in revenue from the sale of film
rights. Also, a new line item, film rights cost, appeared this year containing ₹208 million.
Taken together, purchase/operating expenses fell 20% despite the 9% increase in total
revenue.

Ayngaran International Mauritius Limited's trade receivables increased ₹302 million, which
represents approximately 120% of revenue booked during the period, an accounting
impossibility (Source). The majority of this increase came from receivables overdue for a
period exceeding 6 months. Ayngaran International Mauritius Limited's income statement
also shows that it went from (₹63) million in losses for fiscal year 2014 to ₹48 million in
profits for fiscal-year 2015. In addition, Ayngaran's revenue growth occurred despite
consistent employee reductions. Headcount stood at 43 on 12/31/2011 and now stands at
21 as of fiscal year ending 2015. We find it implausible that a company grew its revenue
by 16x while cutting its staff by 51%.


Finally, EROS has shifted much of its revenue recognition to EROS Holdings FZ LLC and
its subsidiary EROS Digital FZ LLC, both of which are incorporated in the United Arab
Emirates (see the corporate organization chart below). Revenue generated within the
United Arab Emirates based on the customer's location was $103.8 million in fiscal-year
2015 vs. $46.6 million in fiscal-year 2014, or growth of $58.2 million. Over that same time
period, total revenue grew $48.7 million from $235.5 million to $284.2 million. The

company's explanation is tax planning, but we find it difficult to believe that more than
100% of the company's revenue growth took place with customers located in the UAE. In
addition, this does not make sense because we know that the company's revenue
increased by $26.9 million in just the Copsale, Digicine, and the various Ayngaran
subsidiaries, as discussed above (Sources here, here, here, and here). Hence, we can
say that 175% of the company's growth took place in subsidiaries located in non-core
locales such as Singapore, the UAE, the BVI, and the Isle of Man. We believe that there
are almost certainly at least some revenue overstatements here, as an auditor like Anil
Jagetiya & Co. (as explained below) is ill-equipped to handle companies in these locales.


In addition to the likely revenue overstatements, the company also appears to be
capitalizing costs. A detailed analysis of the company's recent capital expenditures shows
a sudden gap between what investors should expect and the reported capex. Per EROS'

disclosure, "High budget" films are $7 million and up, "Medium budget" films cost between
$1 million and $7 million, and "Low budget" films are less than $1 million. Based on these
disclosures as well as disclosures regarding the number of films made in each category,
we compared the company's reported capex with what its guidance implies. This
comparison is in the chart below:


As can be seen, capital expenditures closely matched what is implied by the company's
disclosed costs per film until fiscal-year 2015. However, in 2015, there is a substantial
increase in capex without any explanation. We spoke with management to better
understand the $100 million jump in capital spending despite no significant change in the
number of films produced. We specifically asked why the capital spending in fiscal-year
2013 was $90 million less than it was in fiscal-year 2015 despite producing 12 additional
films in fiscal-year 2013, including the same number of high budget films and an additional
medium budget film. We were unable to get an answer. We believe the two most likely
answers are either that the company has begun to capitalize additional expenses in order
to flatter profitability or that the company has engaged in additional undisclosed related-
party transactions to enrich insiders, similar to those described below.


EROS has enriched its family management team through related-party transactions and
by appointing family members to management posts


We have created the following "family-tree" for EROS to show how the Lulla family
controls all aspects of the company and enriches itself at the expense of minority
shareholders:

EROS is a third-generation family company. Arjan was the founder and appears to be the
patriarch of the family while many other family members are also employees, such as
Rishika Lulla Singh, his 28 year-old granddaughter, Board Member, and CEO of Eros
Digital and Eros Now. Due to this dynamic, there are many transactions that are not done
at arm's-length and insider compensation is generous. In fact, personnel costs have
increased from $12 million in 2013 to $34 million in 2015, a staggering 68% CAGR.
What's more astonishing is that the vast majority of this increase has been paid directly to
key management as its compensation has more than quadrupled (109% CAGR) as
compared to the modest $4 million increase for non-management.

To make matters worse, EROS has been consistently issuing stock to pay for its cash
shortfalls. During fiscal-year 2015, EROS issued 8.5 million of shares on eight separate
occasions. The share count excluding Class B stock grew 36% from 23.5 million to 33.0
million. So while Adjusted EBITDA grew 26.0% in fiscal-year 2015, Adjusted EBITDA per
share grew only 4.5%. Further, on an unadjusted basis, EBITDA actually decreased 1.3%
on a per share basis. In addition, the Founders Group has been consistently selling its
shares. As of March 2015, the Founders Group owned 46.7% of EROS, representing
virtually only Class B ownership stock. Three years earlier, its ownership was 69.8%.


In addition to the outright cash payments that management has received, there have also
been numerous related-party transactions:


- Next Gen Films: EROS filings state that Next Gen Films is an entity owned by the
husband of Puja Rajani, sister of Kishore Lulla. Based on our review of documents, Viki
Rajani transferred his ownership stake to his mother. Viki now owns 1% and Rajkumari
Rajani owns 99% (Source).


EROS purchased film rights of $23.5 million, $22.2 million, and $23.6 million during fiscal-
year 2015, fiscal-year 2014, and fiscal-year 2013, respectively, from Next Gen Films.
These acquisitions represented 9%, 14%, and 13% of total film right investments during
those years. EROS also has provided performance guarantees to a bank amounting to

$32.5 million in fiscal-year 2015 and $26.3 million in fiscal-year 2014 in connection with
funding commitments under film co-production agreements with Next Gen that mature
over the next 24 months.


Interestingly, Next Gen has produced very few films, and the vast majority of them have
been box office failures. Despite these failures, there appear to have been no impairments
taken to EROS' film rights (Source).


- B4U: In April 2008, EROS PLC exercised a call option granted on June 27, 2006, to
acquire Acacia Investments Ltd. from a family trust, in which Kishore Lulla and Sunil Lulla
were shareholders, for $10.8 million. Acacia Investments is a holding company that owns
24% of LMB Holdings Ltd., which operates two entertainment channels, B4U Music and
B4U Movies.


There are two points of significance related to B4U. First, B4U has been a commercial
failure. Fifteen years ago, investors put more than $100 million in to launch the business.
Kishore had initially planned that by 2005 B4U would have 1.5 million paid subscribers
and generate $110 million in profits. At the 2008 transaction price of $10.8 million for 24%
of the company, B4U was therefore valued at just $45 million, less than half of the cash
invested to build it. During fiscal year 2011, B4U only generated $2.5 million in net income
and had $28.7 million in net assets. In addition, B4U's profitability may have been

overstated because EROS had been known to license its film rights to B4U at a cost and
these transactions were not viewed as arm's length by third parties (Sources here, here,
and here).


Acacia Investments is now held on the balance sheet at a value of $16.8 million and is
considered an available-for-sale financial asset, meaning that EROS has not taken a
write-down even though B4U significantly underperformed its business plan. The
income/loss from this business is considered "other income/loss" as EROS considers itself
a passive investor in the company. However, Jyoti Deshpande, CEO of EROS, was part of
the core team that founded B4U TV. We don't see how it is appropriate for EROS to
consider itself a passive investor in B4U when its CEO was one of the founders of B4U.


- Drishti Creations: In 2011 and 2012, EROS licensed a large portion of its satellite TV
syndication rights to Drishti, which accounted for $37.9 million (23.0%) and $24.4 million
(11.8%) of its revenue during fiscal-year 2011 and fiscal-year 2012, respectively. The son
of Mr. Sadhwani, one of EROS' executive officers, served as a director of Drishti between
May 5, 2011, and October 21, 2011.


Interestingly, the revenue EROS reported from Drishti was greater than the revenue that
Drishti reported of $20.1 million in 2011 and $21.5 million in 2012, and zero profits. The
following is an excerpt from Drishti's financial statements which shows revenue of 1,056.4
million INR, which translates to $21.5 million based on the exchange rate at that point in
time (Source).


It is also not clear how $21 million went unaccounted for (the difference between the
revenue that EROS reported of $62.3 million and the revenue Drishti reported of $41.6
million).

- During fiscal-year 2011, EROS entered into transactions with special purpose entities
that were incorporated to produce films within the UK. Andrew Heffernan, CFO, was a
director of these special purpose entities. These entities included Illuminati Films Ltd.,
Vijay Galani Movies Ltd., and Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment Ltd.


- Mr. Sadhwani is the beneficial owner of Victoria Landmark Global Holdings Ltd. Victoria
Landmark received $1.6 million for consultancy services during fiscal-year 2011 from
Ganges Green Energy. Ganges Green is owned by an entity that indirectly owns 66% of
Beech Investments, of which Kishore Lulla and Sunil Lulla are potential beneficiaries.


EROS' Auditor For Many Of Its Most Important Subsidiaries Appears Woefully
Under-Qualified


Anil Jagetiya & Co. is the auditor of Eros Digital Private Ltd, Copsale Limited (BVI),
Ayngaran International Limited (Isle of Man), Ayngaran International UK Limited, Ayngaran
International Mauritius Limited, Digicine PTE Limited (Singapore), EROS Animation
Private Limited, EM Publishing Private Limited, and EyeQube Studios Private Limited.
Based on a recent phone call with Anil, we believe his firm is woefully under-qualified to
serve as the auditor for EROS' important international subsidiaries.


Anil Jagetiya is located in Mumbai (LinkedIn). It is possible to search The Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India using his 6-digit Membership Number (114991). He is also
associated with SJ Corporate Pvt. Ltd (Zauba Profile). Information is scarce on both Anil
Jagetiya & Co. and SJ Corporate Pvt. Ltd. We have been able to find only two other
employees associated with Anil Jagetiya & Co., Mamta Doshi and Abhishek Singhvi (Bayt
and LinkedIn).


We believe Anil Jagetiya & Co. is a tiny company consisting of only a few people. We
were unable to find a website for the company, and we would note that the firm appears to
operate from a personal Gmail account (see below). As a point of reference, the firm does
not appear on the list of the top 20 Certified Accounting firms in India (Source). The 20th
ranked company on this list, Khanna & Annadhanam, does not have any international
offices, has only 12 Chartered Accountants and consists of 83 total employees, 16 of
which serve administrative roles (Source). We question whether even Khanna &
Annadhanam is qualified to audit far-flung subsidiaries in locales such as the Isle of Man,
the UAE, Singapore, and the BVI, and we sincerely doubt the ability of Anil Jagetiya & Co.
to properly audit entities all over the world.

Anil Jagetiya & Co. resigned on May 28, 2015, as auditor for Eros Digital Private Ltd.
because it claimed "we are not in a position to devote our time to the affairs of the
Company." We have not found separate resignation letters for its other engagements with
EROS. Given the convoluted structure, numerous foreign subsidiaries and accounting
irregularities at EROS, we are not surprised that a small audit firm was unable to devote
the time to EROS.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 18/43


Furthermore, with the large inconsistencies in the financial statements, we would not be
surprised if Anil Jagetiya just wanted to disassociate himself from EROS.


Our concerns about the company’s financial reporting are only reinforced by its
experience listing on the NYSE. In March 2012, the shareholders of Eros PLC approved a
resolution to cancel its AIM admission in favor of a NYSE listing. However, just months
later these plans were delayed on June 8th, 2012. Eros PLC didn’t list until November 13,
2013 (Source). A member of the management team disclosed to us during a meeting that
its admission to the NYSE was delayed due to financial reporting and control issues. In
addition, the CFO of Eros PLC and CFO of EIML both departed within 7 months of each
other. Kamal Kumar Jain, the CFO of EIML, resigned from his office on November 30,
2014. Andrew Heffernan served his notice to resign from his Group CFO position in June
2015.


EROS is unlikely to ever be the Netflix of India


For some investors, EROS has provided a great growth story based on Eros Now and the
potential to reach 1.2 billion people in India. We believe Eros Now faces significant
headwinds from Internet access availability, piracy, and competition, all of which we
discuss below. A careful analysis of these impediments to success suggests to us that
Eros Now has poor prospects. In addition, we have identified a number of inconsistencies
which suggest that investors have been misled regarding Eros Now.


Streaming video is not the first extension from traditional movie distribution that EROS has
touted. During 2012, EROS planned on acquiring the 76% of B4U Television that it didn't
already own. At the time, the purpose of the acquisition was to provide EROS with a
captive outlet for its film library to be distributed via television. That plan changed in
February 2013 when EROS partnered with HBO Asia to distribute its movies via two new
premium advertising-free movie channels through Dish TV and Airtel Digital TV. Sell-side
firms were modeling $30 million in profits by fiscal year 2018 based on 5% penetration, or
9 million subscribers with an ARPU of $1.58/month. In an IDBI Capital report from May 21,
2014, it wrote that HBO will be "A game changer in the long term." As of 2Q15, EROS
stated that the collaboration is generating no revenue. In the fiscal-year 2015 20-F filing,
there is no mention of HBO at all.


EROS discloses revenue broken down as Theatrical, Television Syndication, and Digital &
Ancillary. Digital is defined as revenue that is sourced from Internet protocol television,
video on demand, Internet channels, and Eros Now. Given the hype, we would expect the

revenue from this source to be increasing. Surprisingly, 1Q16 ended June 2015 saw a
42% decline year over year and a 66% decline quarter over quarter. The company gave
no explanation.


We believe limited Internet access will be a headwind to all streaming video providers in
India. According to a recently published report by the Internet and Mobile Association of
India (IAMAI), Internet users in India have grown by 17% during the first 6 months of 2015,
with 52 million new users. However, the vast majority of this increase is coming from low-
cost cell phones and basic data services. There are a total of just 20 million wired Internet
connections in India.


Including wireless Internet connections, the total internet connections are just over 300
million total users. According to IAMAI, as of December 2014, there are only 65-70 million
3G subscribers and video access on mobile devices is driven by 3G adoption. However,
this is primarily short-format mobile video such as music videos and 30 minute shows, not
full-length movies, because mobile phone users have limited data plans that are not
suitable for watching full-length movies. Also, 44% of smartphone users do not watch
mobile video due to poor network speeds. The percentage of broadband connections
above speeds of 4Mbs is estimated at less than 7% in India.


The following table provides numerical support. Mobile phones are being used mainly to
watch short video clips, and only 14% of smartphone users use their phone to watch full-
length movies (Source).

With broadband access both scarce and expensive in India, people have historically
turned to pirated movies for widespread access to films. Pirated movies are widely
available for less than $1 from street vendors in India while a film is still playing in the
theaters. They are also available at many Indian stores in North America and the UK for
as little as $2. People can also watch movies for free on streaming sites like
bwcinema.com and einthusian.com. Our research also reveals that 12-15 weeks after
theatrical release, high-quality DVDs become available. Until broadband connections
become both more prevalent and lower cost, it is difficult for us to see why broadband
streaming will gain widespread popularity.


The following quote from an MD at NGC Network India and Fox International Channels
summarizes our view on the interplay between low-cost content and high-cost broadband:


"The biggest challenge for digital is monetization. Nobody is talking about the
elephant in the room. Everybody talks about digital. For example 1GB of data costs
around Rs500 ($7.69). In 1GB data, you will get about three hours of content. This
content if you had to buy, you would probably buy it for less than Rs10. So the
distribution method is costing you Rs500 and your content is only costing you Rs10.
Most broadcasters are struggling with this imbalance. They are giving their content
at affordable prices to consumers, but the method the customer can use to
download that content or view it on digital is proving to be phenomenally expensive
and does not make it affordable to watch a lot of videos in the long run. So until this
cost of data consumption comes down to more affordable levels, there is no digital
video play in the country."

EROS is not alone in the battle for streaming video subscribers. Star India is an Indian
media and entertainment conglomerate owned by 21st Century Fox. hotstar is Star India's
mobile application for digital media. It was launched on February 1, 2015, and has already
overtaken Eros Now, which claims to have launched in 2012. hotstar's acceptance and
use has been driven by its cost-free content and a technology solution for bandwidth and
content discovery. hotstar.com is ranked #150 in India based on Alexa traffic ranks,
compared to ErosNow.com at #2,549 (Source).


Another larger competitor is dittotv.com (#1,728 on Alexa), owned by Zee TV. Zee TV has
disclosed that it had 3.2 million paid subscribers, and 1.75m unpaid subscribers, of which
about 20,000 were from outside of India. Zee's subscriber numbers in light of its higher
traffic make Eros Now's subscriber numbers look quite dubious. Zee launched Ditto in
2012, and has not yet broken even on its $5 million initial investment despite the fact that
it has a paid subscriber business model. Ditto is very direct in explaining the challenges of
monetizing this distribution channel. First, the cost of acquiring a subscriber and keeping a
customer active is very high. Second, it is very difficult to collect payment. Ditto is currently
selling prepaid cards and virtual cards at stores where Internet services or devices are
sold. It uses distribution and payment collection solution providers like Oxigen as well as
the mobile telco operators. Ditto appears to be trying to partner with every company that a
customer is likely to have a billing relationship with. Ditto is also offering a cash-on delivery
model where a Ditto prepaid card is delivered to the door-step in exchange for payment
(Source).

Other existing competitors include but are not limited to: Sony Liv, Box TV, Big Flix,
Hungama, and Spuul. There are rumors that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to invest $5
billion in India, with plans to include instant video services. Netflix is also planning on
entering the Indian market in 2016 (Source).


Of course, no discussion of EROS would be complete without a discussion of inexplicable
and contradictory claims from the company. Beyond the inflated subscriber numbers,
EROS' oft-quoted 3,000+ library is in stark contrast to its 1,162 films on Eros Now
(Source). Furthermore, EIML on its website states it has "aggregated rights to over 1,100
films in our library, plus an additional 700 films for which we hold digital rights only" and
quotes 2,000+ films in its most recent annual report, but EROS PLC claims a 3,000+ film
library. It's difficult to reconcile these disparate claims.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 23/43


We are quite concerned by the obvious exaggerations put forth by management regarding
facts that are easily confirmed. For example, in an August 18, 2015 article by the
Economic Times Jyoti Deshpande, CEO of Eros International, is quoted as saying "We
have already notched up 26.5 million registered users worldwide since our soft launch 18
months ago (in February 2014)" (Source). This statement implies Eros Now launched in
February 2014 and is in direct contradiction to Eros India's repeated assertions that Eros
Now was launched August 2012. The August 2012 start date was stated in both the fiscal-
year 2013 and fiscal-year 2014 annual reports of EIML.


Similarly interesting, is the supposed acceleration in the growth of subscribers despite no
corresponding increase in marketing spending. As of March 2014, Eros Now only had
2.3M free subscribers on the Eros Now YouTube channel. This relationship began in
2007, and as discussed later, YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a very
popular app in India. However, investors are also supposed to believe that in March 2014,
19 months post the "soft" launch, Eros Now had 14M subscribers (and 19M subscribers
as of March 2015) (Source). Between March 2015 and June 2015, EROS claims it added
5 million subscribers. Somehow that was accomplished with lower advertising spend year
over year. Between June 2015 and October 2015, EROS claims it added another 3.5
million subscribers. We are awaiting the financials to see if there was any correlation with
a pick-up in marketing spending.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 24/43


We also believe YouTube data calls the Eros Now subscriber numbers into question. As of
March 2015, YouTube has 60 million users in India. Per alexa.com, India is the source of
9.5% of all visitors to youtube.com and youtube.com has a global rank of #3 in terms of
traffic. It is inconceivable to us that Eros Now could have half the number of users in India
as YouTube yet its Alexa rank is thousands of spots below YouTube's rank. It is also not
clear to us why a population that is happy with an advertising model rather than a
subscription model would not be fully content relying on YouTube nearly exclusively for its
video content. Our research has indicated that YouTube has more than 700 Indian movies
available for download, including EROS movies.


Valuation


We believe that the company's persistent negative free cash flow, financial statements that
make no sense, and growing debt levels and share counts make the stock most likely
worthless. In the event that investors wish to rely on the company's financial statements (a
mistake, we believe), then we would point out that fiscal-year 2015 EPS under the
company's prior amortization policy was only $0.144. Even if the company could grow that
to $0.20 this year (39% EPS growth) and achieve a growth company multiple of 25x EPS,
the stock would still be worth only $5.00 per share. We believe that even $5.00 per share
is much too high because it assumes that the company's financial statements can be
trusted. We believe otherwise.


Conclusion


As a testament to its namesake, we believe EROS has infatuated investors with its story,
blind to the ugly truth. Underneath the convoluted structure and reported earnings, EROS
is a company that burns cash and continuously issues stock. We think the main
benefactor has been the Lulla family. The promise of Eros Now, which has been pumped
to the investing community during 16 events over the past five months, is a myth (Source).
Internet access, piracy, and competition in India will prevent Eros Now from meaningfully
contributing to EROS' already non-existent cash flow. The lack of future prospects,
absence of current cash flow, and concerns about accounting lead us to believe EROS is
most likely worthless.

Arjan Lulla founded the film acquisition company, now known as Eros International Media
Ltd. ("EIML"), in 1977. A partnership was formed under the name of Jupiter Enterprises in
1981 which included Arjan, as well as Kishore Lulla (Arjan's son) and Bhagibhai Lulla. In
1994, that company was incorporated as Rahima International Private Limited, and in
1999, EIML acquired the business. During 2008, the company was converted to a public
limited company. The name was changed to EIML in 2009 and listed on the Bombay
Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India in June 2010. The business
originally involved the purchase of Indian content for exploitation in international markets.
However, our sources have indicated that the company is reputed to have been involved
with pirating its own content and selling it within India.


Eros PLC was incorporated in the Isle of Man in 2006 and was admitted for trading on the
Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. At that time, Eros PLC
owned EIML, but we have been unable to find any documentation of the purchase.
Unfortunately, regulatory filings on the AIM exchange are not as well maintained as they
are in the U.S. by the SEC.


On December 19, 2009, Eros PLC, EIML, and all involved subsidiaries entered into a
relationship agreement. Under the agreement, EIML purchases Indian film rights, exploits
the content within India, Nepal and Bhutan, and then licenses the international rights to
Eros PLC for an upfront fee equal to 30% of the production costs plus pre-approved
distribution expenses with an additional mark-up of 30%, or 39% of EIML's upfront costs.
Additionally, Eros PLC pays Eros International Media (via its Eros Worldwide Dubai
subsidiary) 30% of the gross proceeds it receives from exploiting the content
internationally. This agreement expired on February13, 2014, but was extended for an
additional two year term. With the basis of the whole business model up for renegotiation
in less than four months, we are surprised that there has been no discussion of this topic
either by the company or the sell side.


In April 2012, the shareholders of Eros PLC approved a resolution to cancel its admission
on AIM following its listing on the NYSE. However, due to financial reporting and control
issues, its admission to the NYSE was delayed until November 2013. EROS has a dual
share class structure with Class A shares having 1 vote and Class B shares having 10
votes. Class B is entirely owned by the Founders Group: Beech Investment Limited,
Olympus Foundation, Arjan Lulla, Kishore Lulla and Vijay Ahuja. As of March 2015, 53%
of the shares are publicly traded, with insiders holding the balance.

Comments (44)


If this isn't complicated enough, it is important to understand the organizational structure
and related parties. Eros PLC is at the top of the organizational chart. Eros Network Ltd.
was incorporated in the UK June 2006, and appears to be the subsidiary responsible for
all international distribution. Eros International Ltd. was also incorporated in the UK June
2006, and it is not clear why this layer exists. Eros Worldwide FZ was incorporated in UAE
June 2006, and owns the subsidiaries responsible for acquisition of content and
distribution within India. Eros International PTE and Belvedere Holdings PTE were both
incorporated during 2010 in Singapore. We have been unable to ascertain what these
companies do. Acacia Investments Holding was incorporated in 2008 in Isle of Man, and
is the holding company for a 24% ownership stake in L.M.B. Holdings, which operates
B4U Music and B4U Movies.

Here is an excerpt from FORBES article: Bollywood is firmly on top of the pile with 1,602 in 2012 alone. The
U.S. churned out 476 films that year while the Chinese managed 745. In the same year, Hollywood sold 1.36
billion tickets compared to Bollywood’s whopping 2.6 billion. Indian films can’t match Hollywood in box office
revenue, however. U.S. films grossed nearly $10.8 billion in 2012 compared to India’s meager $1.6 billion. 
The reason that prices of tickets in bollywood is the reason for lesser revenue.

Financial analysts in India make $6,500 - $10,000 per year right now. Developed world Professionals with
similar titles make $40,000 - $Wall Street Money. 
There is simply a whole 'nother world in India right now. Wage growth trend is 10% annually so that will
compound into significantly larger wages for many portions of the population. I'm sure movie theatre prices
will increase along with that.

Only positive is that directors may come to regret their decision to move from UK to NY listing. SEC and US

The article is quite detailed and thorough, but the points you raised dont warrant a less than $5 valuation....


1.) Negative Free Cash Flow 
This is a small cap company operating in Asia that is growing, and, if you had investment experience in Asia, you
would realize that it's not an issue. A majority of companies fall under that category.


2.) Ballooning Accounts Receivable 
This I agree is a concern, but it's a prevalent problem across the entire Indian media industry due to how content

deals were structured due to digitization trends. Movie payers pay when the watch movies, content buyers pay over
time and thus, with an increase in digitization as a % of revenue, it's normal for accounts receivables to increase.


3.) Subsidiary Financials 
I think this is the most informative piece of your argument, and I agree this is a major governance issue, which I have
raised to the management before.


The key point you missed is that most of the revenues come from the film business, which is by far the most important
driver of the business, and Eros Now is just the cherry on top.


This company has distributed/produced 2 out of the 3 highest grossing films in India this year and the vast majority of
the highest grossing movies were produced within the past few years compared to many of the top 20 in America 
being decades old -- the industry is growing much faster than in America, which is important because you're applying
heuristics that are mainly applicable in mature markets.


As for Eros Now, everyone who has been following the stock knows that the ~30mn figure is mainly from their
Techzone acquisition and they mainly consist of one-off buyers of their content. It's deceptive, but the management
has been transparent about this and anyone who followed the stock more than a few months is aware of that. The
institutional investors who do their due diligence are excited about the prospects, because of digitization, which you
didnt mention at all and is the 2nd worst part about your article (1st being how little you glossed over the theater/film
business), since analog tvs will go offline unless people subscribe to a +150rs/month option available from digital
cable or DTH operators vs. the 50rs/month option from Eros Now.


Also, the reason why pirating was more prevalent before is because films were distributed via print vs digital now and
that has allowed movies to be released on a larger scale (and much faster than before), so the lag time between initial
release has come down from the nearly 6 month lag between tier-1 and tier-3 cities. Who doesnt want to watch a
movie after it is released?


Full disclosure, I am long the stock, so I am biased as you are. I only raise these points because it seems like your
manipulating the opinions of others with misinformation. It's late now, but I just want to say that you should do more
due diligence on the company before writing such a scathing piece.

Having worked with Grant Thornton over 20 years who happens to be their auditors, there is very little foundational
information in supporting the authors negative report. It seems the author's objective is too subjective and speculative
to warrant the attention he is receiving. The amortization write-off is dictated by their accountants. The portfolio's
intrinsic value similar to other genre catalogs is a strong asset that has inherent cash flows built into the model.

fmarone, if you cannot seriously see all the red flags (with their sources) then you should know why Grant
Thornton appreciated you for 20 years as an employee!


The authors did a truly great job in forensic accounting and I am amazed by the depth and breadth of the
analysis. The time and effort in creating such a report must have been enormous.


Great job.

Great theoretical reporting but as Jhopsk has rightly mentioned, missing out on the material theatrical revenues which
bring in hard cash to the company. The article conveniently misses out the new movie releases financial piece and
this year has seen some heady successes like Bajrangi Bhaijaan etc.  
Moreover with catalogue revenues generating in excess of 20% of the total revenues, doesn't it bring a good tail for
amortization to be as conservative.  
Also as mentioned by fmarone, the overall audit responsibility is with Grant Thornton and when such a pedigree is
involved, foundational information cannot be compromised as in this report.  
Great educative report though influenced by the authors shorting shades.

There is no smoke without fire. Unfortunately those still long on this stock have yet to learn this lesson. The
12 month low on Friday is NOT a buying opportunity, and the report authors valuation of $5 is conservative.
Others have said the shares could be worthless because of the bond situation. I expect this to dip below $10
next week and reach the $5 level (or possibly lower) within 30 days.

CharlesAngoff
"However, our sources have indicated that the company is reputed to have been involved with pirating its own content
and selling it within India."


So there's a good bit of hedging, obfuscation, and ambiguity in these sorts of statements the author employs since
"our sources" isn't specified (presumably someone on the street or a short-seller) and with the use of "reputed" you
have a double-hedge as this "source" him/herself only claims that the company has a reputation of such-and-such
without herself laying such accusations directly. Etc. It's good legal policy to not claim anything explicitly that can't be
defended in court.


"The lack of future prospects, absence of current cash flow, and concerns about accounting lead us to believe EROS
is most likely worthless." Mere opinions. And this one seems way over the top as perhaps Indians pirate the movies
and don't do a lot of streaming but the diaspora in the US, Canada, UK, Malaysia, etc. seem to be paying good
money for Ero's content. There's no mention of these subscribers.


Also there's no disclosure of any position (long or short) that could materially impact the author's opinions. Are we
safe in assuming that he/she is selling Eros short?

Talking of Grant Thornton, another client of theirs, Globo Plc is also under investigation for fraudulent accounting,
inflated revenue etc and the trading in the company suspended in the LSE. 
This is an excellent report. On amortisation , if the policy is to amortise over 10 years ( first year 50%) assuming
reasonable level of revenue stream over such period, then the revenue from older films should be more than 40% of
the current year revenue. But it is not so.

The amortization schedule in the article is way too generous. It is my opinion that for INDIAN movies you
should go with a minimum of 70% for the first year (declining balance). First, piracy has a significant effect,
second the indian movie industry produces more than FOUR movies a day! Good luck watching re-runs.


* I modeled the numbers on 70, 13, 9, 4, 2 and a residual value of 2% and came with a best case scenario of
an impairment of 370 million.  
* Also, good luck collecting overdue bills of 6 months in India.  
* The Auditor reminds me of Madoff's mini audit firm handling billions. 
* The latest financials state "we would need approximately $96.4 million over the next year, to meet our
principal and interest payments"


However, I do disagree that the company is worthless, but it is much less than today.


P. S. I am hoping for a big upward bounce on Monday


01 Nov 2015, 06:06 AM


Netwall, Contributor
This is an extremely well researched article. Kudos for that.


Being an avid watcher of Indian movies, I would caution you however, that viewing films is almost a religion in Indian
society including equally the Expats. It is a well known fact that poor public in India can skip rent payment but they will
use the money to watch a newly released film. It is unlike Hollywood, where people watch movies for entertainment
purposes only. Over there, Bollywood has become sort of platform where film makers make movies not only for
entertainment but also passing along religious dogmas, political beliefs etc. The block buster movie that author
highlighted above (PK) did not become popular for its "entertaining" content but it contains some debatable messages
on Hindu/Muslim religion and also politics. That's why it become popular.


Anyway, my point is that even if this company has made some accounting errors, we cannot deem this company to be
worthless. Indian cinema is so much ingrained into population of Indian descent that I personally know people who
would stand in lines to go watch newly released movies, and word of mouth spreads like fire. Some people I know will
go and watch the same movie again on cinema again. So there are some headwinds for this company in the short
run, but in the long run, it will correct its course and will continue to make money, because people of Indian descent
cannot live without bollywood.

Yes, you are right. It is worthwhile to mention that EROS co-produces/distributes more than twice of
bollywood movies. And the regional actors are sometimes worshipped as gods. People would stand for hours
in queues to watch for a big ticket movie. I the regional cinema industry is even bigger than bollywood.

In your article you have mentioned of EROS NOW 27 times. But you are missing the fact that core business of EROS
is still movie distribution in cinemas through various channels. And its core business is expected to grow at CAGR of
11%.


Piracy does not has that much effect on movie collections in theatre as can be seen by fact that Indian cinemas sold
nearly 2.7 billion tickets in 2013 – a figure which seems exorbitant, when considered that the next four markets in the
ranking (North America, China, Mexico and South Korea) do not reach this amount collectively. Source:
http://bit.ly/1MrDBAm


You should not miss the fact that pirated version of regional movies, which constitute about 2/3rd of the total movie
releases of EROS, are not easily available on the internet. And as far your this statment ’’ People can also watch
movies for free on streaming sites like bwcinema.com and einthusian.com ’’ is concerned, I would like to inform you
that ’’bwcinema.com’’ didn’t opened on my computer(believe me, we don’t use VPN for watching movies) and
’’einthusian.com’’ contained no such links to pirated movies. I have uploaded screenshots for both the websites. 
Bwcinema.com - http://imgur.com/IC30URO 
Einthusian.com - http://imgur.com/AGThhgE


It is also worthwhile noting that pirated movies available on the streets are of poor quality and many people who have
not seen the movie in theaters (especially the older people) will wait for broadcast of movie on cable TV.


The reason why people will use EROS NOW is because they will get to watch the movie in better quality even before
cable TV and that too for free. EROS expect majority of its EROS NOW subscribers to use the platform for free,

EROS will use advertisement to monetize free content, which Indians do not mind.


With the launch of NETFLIX EROS is only going to be at advantage since it has catalog of about 2,000 films which
will be used by the NETFLIX on its platform. And thereby benefiting EROS.


Plus i am very skeptical about the success of NETFLIX in Indian market as there are many bottlenecks like: 
1. Cable TV and Direct satellite broadcast is very cheap in India at about 4/5 dollars a month and you get access to
hundreds of channels. To use Netflix people will have to pay for subscription as well as for the high speed internet
which seems like a bad deal. 
2. Almost all the TV shows on Netflix can be downloaded through torrents on the same day of their release.  
3. Only 8% of total internet subscribers have access to high speed internet. Users of high-speed fiber broadband is
even lower. Although government is working on providing high-speed fiber broadband, no concrete step has been
taken in that direction. And even after the launch of 4G, situation will not improve since data plans are way to
expensive for people to afford online streaming on the go.

Determing whether Eros is a valueless or valuable company

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 35/43


A. Let’s acknowledge a few key items AlphaExposure conveniently chose to ignore.


I. AlphaExposure conveniently neglects to mention that Eros produced Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the Biggest Blockbuster of
2015 and 2nd Highest Grossing Bollywood Film Ever at $92 Million in Gross Revenues


http://bit.ly/1WromCy


Bajrangi Bhaijaan – an all time Indian hit – a record gross of Rs 600 crores – that’s $92 million 
Costs: 
Cost of production – Rs 55 crore, Cost of marketing – Rs 20 crore. Total: Rs 75 crore 
Income: 
India theatrical box office: Rs 311 crores as of Aug 11th 
Distributor’s take: Rs 139 crore 
Overseas theatrical box office: Rs 167 crores 
Distributor’s take: Rs 83 crores 
Music, Digital and ancillary: Rs 15 cr 
Satellite: Rs 50 cr 
Total Recovery: Rs 139 + 83 + 15 + 50: 287 crores – 75 crores = Rs 212 crores / $32 Mil. 
ROI 212/ 75 = 283% 
II. AE conveniently neglects to mention that Eros also produced the 2nd Biggest Blockbuster of 2015 : Tanu Weds
Manu II, an instant Comedy Classic


Tanu Weds Manu II is a comedy classic with huge re-run potential 
Cost: 30 crores 
Income: 150 crores 
In addition, Badlapur and NH10 were two additional hits during the year and Eros had a fantastic year.


Badlapur – Rs 24 cr in 1st weekend – grossed $7.6 million 
NH 10 – a surprise hit that grossed $4.8 million 
III. AlphaEx further neglects to mention Eros is releasing Bajirao Mastaani – another likely blockbuster in the 4th
Quarter 2015, creating the possibility of another $25 Million+ Blockbuster


Let’s acknowledge Eros has knocked it out of the park this year.


Eros has a strong movie pipeline with superstars and a track record of huge success. This is the positioning that
NetFlix wants to move into but is nowhere near doing so. Eros has the expertise and relationships to collaborate,
produce, market and distribute in India and globally.


IV. Eros Uses a Risk Mitigating, Profit Sharing model with Actors & Directors, creating Motivated Partners and Huge
Hits


When Eros wins, it wins big. When it loses, it loses small. The essence of smart investing.


Eros enters into agreements with directors and actors to share profits on a 50/50 to 90/10 basis depending on the
actor / directors popularity / pull. Baajiaro Mastaani has a budget of only 100 crores as a result of profit sharing deals.
So it’s almost guaranteed to be a great return for all parties.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 36/43


Eros’ revenues and business model are plainly confirmed by box office receipts and confirmations provided by
counterparties. There’s over $100 Million in Revenues and great Profit Margins.


V. ErosNow, the streaming venture, in any conservative analysis, can frankly be valued at Zero.


Eros does not want to become NetFlix. So let’s forget about number of subscribers, pricing, subscriptions. Eros is a
$150 Million dollar Exclusive Content Production House right now. Any revenues from ErosNow are incremental.


I have no idea why Alphaexposure is fixated on ErosNow. He needs a reason to bash Eros I would presume. True,
management has been hyping itself as the Bollywood Netflix but that’s not really the case. Eros is a $200 Million
production, distribution powerhouse with a large library of exclusive content and the ability to produce successful
Bollywood Blockbusters.


ErosNow is a business with a zero valuation right now.


NetFlix recently stated they are moving into the content business. Eros is already in the content business, owning a
major content library comprising 2,000 plus films. Why is alphaexposure obsessed about ErosNow streaming? Eros is
a movie producer, distributor and content aggregator, with plans to add streaming to the mix but no dependence on
streaming revenues.


VI. Eros has grown Net Gross Revenues from $1.38 Million in 2008 to $112 Million in 2015 YTD


These Aren’t Accounting Tricks, It’s Box Office Receipts


This data is from the website listed below that tracks gross box office collections

B. Let’s look at Alphaexposure’s claims, item by item:


I. AlphaExposure Claim: “Due to aggressive accounting practices, EROS’ reported earnings are significantly
overstating the economic reality of its business model.”


First, the business reality is that Eros has grossed over $100 Million this year from a very modest start of $1.3M in
2008. The timing of accounting cash flows and accruals has no impact on the actual dollars earned, so what we’re
disputing is the aggressiveness of the amortization cycle.


Alphaexposure says “EROS’ accounting policy for amortization is more aggressive than its U.S. peers despite the fact
that piracy more meaningfully impairs the longer term value of EROS’ assets”.


Eros may use an “aggressive” policy with respect to other studios, but is within the norms of accounting standards
and not in violation of them. AlphaExp offers no substantiation or proof of violation of accounting norms.


AlphaExposure’s claim is that Eros spreads its amortization over 9 years and in so doing reduces it’s expenses. His
assertion of using a 3 year amortization is not reasonable. Due to a dearth of original content, many movies –
especially hit movies – continue to be aired on Indian channels for years to come, way beyond the 3 years that
AlphaEx expects. Indians love their movies, and love to watch them.


There are also many cinema halls that air historical releases at discount prices. The common man can only afford to
watch these movies. An amortization where 50% is done in year 1 and 50% over the remaining eight years is more

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 37/43


reasonable than a 3 year amortization cycle. AlphaExposure’s claim is debatable.


India is a vast country with 1.2 billion consumers, 90% of which love movies. The possibilities for continual licensing
revenues are endless.


Second, despite what AlphaExposure may believe, legitimate DVD rentals do occur in India. Not all content is pirated
and legitimate dvd rental businesses do exist.


We can confidently state that AlphaExposure’s assertion that Eros is overstating its operating profit is purely his
opinion on his interpretation of accounting standards and Eros is within norms to do so.


Second, AE’s assertion that EPS should be discounted as a result should be rejected outright.


II. AlphaExposure Claim: “EROS subsidiary financials reveal a lack of free cash flow and raise many questions about
the company’s accounting.”


Alphaexposure claims that 100% of the revenue growth is coming out of the Middle East.


Let’s assume he’s right and invert his claim.


IF UAE revenues are fictitious then how does one explain that India revenues are down year over year?


How can a company produce two of the biggest blockbusters of all time and 4 major hits this year, but show NO
revenue growth in India?


Doing business in India is complex and full of regulatory hurdles. Dubai is a vastly more attractive domain to conduct
business in.


Alphaview states: “the British Virgin Islands, Singaporean, and Mauritian subsidiaries show significant revenue
growth”


Mauritius is a very, very popular entity that is used by hundreds of Foreign Institutional Investors to avoid onerous tax
structures in India. It’s a commonly accepted practice to route investments into India out of Mauritius. Ditto B.V.I,
Singapore.


http://bit.ly/1WromCB – Avoiding double taxation, Mauritius is a channel used by foreign investors to invest in India.


Just because Alphaview does not understand business practices relating to India does not mean that they are illegal.


III. AlphaExposure Claim: “EROS enriches its family management team through related party transactions and by
appointing numerous family members to management positions.”


I would attribute this again to a cultural difference. In India, trust is an absolutely paramount issue. Promoters trust
their family and relatives first. That the business performs should be an investor’s concern. Businesses are handed
over from generation to generation.


If AE can prove that nepotism has led to a decrease in shareholder wealth, he should provide proof.


There’s nothing illegal here.


IV. AlphaExposure Claim: “EROS has numerous warning signs of poor financial controls, such as employing a tiny
auditor for its most important subsidiaries.”

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 38/43


Eros International is audited by the very reputed firm of Grant Thornton, a U.S. company that is probably one of the
10 largest auditors in the U.S. It ranks right up there with the Big Accounting Firms and has a solid track record.


Grant Thornton was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their audit service. They’ve signed off.


It’s pretty convenient to pick on the smaller auditor. But again, it’s an opinion that because the guy has a gmail
address, he’s not competent? AlphaEx just issues opinions, accusations, claims and questions. He thinks things don’t
look accurate. Where’s any proof?


The size of the flows he disputes when converted to dollars amount to much smaller amounts in the range of a few
million dollars and the reasonable thing would be to give the company a chance to clarify.


V. AlphaExposure Claim: “ErosNow is losing the battle for streaming movies in India and its position will only get
worse because Netflix plans to launch in India.”


Again, Alphaexposure gives absolutely no proof that this will be the case. Any rational investor would believe that a
company with the control over content will carve a solid niche for itself and a company with access to relationships will
eventually engineer exclusive arrangements. Eros says it has, with the exception of Star, which owns HotStar.


So we’re supposed to believe the opinion of an anonymous poster who’s probably never visited India, does not
understand how business is done in India.


Finally, just because NetFlix will launch in India does not mean it’ll succeed. Just look up the case of Walmart. It’s
launched in India over 5 years ago and it’s done nothing. It would depend on expertise, content, relationships,
resources and execution.


I. With major blockbusters, Eros’ Revenues in 2015 have accelerated rapidly, with a corresponding rise in
Receivables


With revenues tripling from CY 2014 to CY 2015, it would be a logical extension to expect receivables to increase.


Now if we are to believe Alphaexposure, then there is an issue with huge growth in UAE. What about no growth in
revenues in India. Doesn’t that seem strange that a company is releasing blockbusters and showing no growth in
India revenues? Wouldn’t it be plausible that the revenues are being booked in the UAE for tax haven purposes as
Eros International is a foreign entity.


Generally, a foreign institutional investor investing in India would show growth in Mauritius revenues.


MNCs today domicile where it makes sense for profit maximization. To suggest that no other MNC is involved in
similar practices is naive at best and a hack job at worst.


Alphaview conveniently forgets to mention that Eros has produced major blockbusters: Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Tanu Weds
Manu II, NH10 and Badlapur, which would be 4 of the top 6 biggest hits in 2015.


Alphaview uses what ever facts that suit his hypothesis and makes lots of allegations without proof.


We agree that Eros may never be NetFlix. We think Eros is actually a content producer, distributor and aggregator, a
far more valuable business model.


Whether ErosNow succeeds or not is pointless. Alphaview does not understand this simple fact that Eros’ model is far
better than being a simple streamer of music.

Some accounting issues have been raised. It would appear logical to wait for management to exit their quiet period
and respond. However this is a concerted bear attack intended for personal gain.


Eros Worldwide FZ was incorporated in UAE June 2006, and owns the subsidiaries responsible for acquisition of
content and distribution within India. So wouldn’t it be logical to expect to see a significant rise in UAE revenues?


II. Some of Alphaexposure’s accusations range from 7 years ago to 5 years ago


“Prior to fiscal 2010, after the year of a film’s release, the remaining capitalized film content costs were amortized
evenly over a maximum of four years” 
“Dhrishti Creations: In 2011 and 2012, EROS licensed a large portion of its satellite TV syndication rights to Dhrishti,” 
“In April 2008, EROS PLC exercised a call option granted on June 27, 2006 to acquire Acacia Investments Ltd from a
family trust. EROS has not taken a write down even though B4U significantly underperformed its business plan.” 
Just throw everything up, and hope it’s gonna stick.


III. Eros is solidly positive on an Operating Cash Flow basis


As far as capex is concerned, we believe the results speak for themselves. Eros is moving into the big leagues and
producing blockbusters and generating large profits.


We can think of another firm that’s done very well for investors that constantly invested in itself and its business :
Amazon.

IV. The Number of Indian Cinemas Is Growing Leaps & Bounds – It’s an Enormous Market and Eros Is a Leader


Now that we’ve gone over each one of Alphaview’s accusations, and not found a single shred of actual proof that
Eros has acted illegally in any manner, let’s go over the potential of Eros.


V. The average Net Revenue Gross Per Film Is Growing Exponentially Over the Past 5 Years


5 years ago, Bollywood insiders used to be happy with a Rs 10 Crore grossing film. Then the number went to Rs 25
Crores. In 2013, the magic number started hitting Rs 100 Crores. In 2015, we’ve started hitting Rs 500 – 600 Crore!


Eros, in 2015, is the dominant producer, distributor and content owner of Bollywood, partnering with the Khans.


India is a growing country and there isn’t a lot to do here in the form of entertainment. Movies are religion. The quality
of Indian cinema has improved by leaps and bounds and going to the cinema has become an enjoyable experience.


In 2016, we fully expect that a movie will gross Rs 1,000 Crore. Bollywood is targeting ever expanding markets.


India’s poor and middle class are passionate about movies and because the quality of movies is improving constantly,
Bollywood is in its prime.


Eros is better positioned to ride this wave than any production house. Eros has the expertise and now, the track
record to produce Blockbusters.


VI. Global interest in Bollywood is growing


Bollywood’s producing fresh, enjoyable fare and moviegoers are responding worldwide. With 1/4th the world’s
population watching Indian movies, that’s a very large market and growing.

So Should Eros Be Declared Worthless Just Because an Anonymous Guy Without Facts and No Proof Thinks So?


$100 million earned in Bajrangi Bhaijaan must have been fabricated? The 2nd largest grossing film ever.


Grant Thornton is clueless and has abdicated its responsibility despite earning millions in fees, but AlphaExposure got
it right.


Superstars are willing to let Eros be their studio production house when they could easily produce movies
themselves?


Eros has managed to convince Bollywood Actors to not get paid somehow?


Is $200 Million in Revenues a myth, India’s box office collections reporting fabricated, news reports fabricated?


Eros is more like Disney than Netflix. It’s a play on the growth of Indian movies. Eros produced 1 movie in 2008.
Today it produces 65 – 70. Eros works on business models that minimize the upfront risk. So you’re looking at a few
movies that will be grand slam home runs, and a few that will lose 25% of the investment at worst.


Isn’t that the PE model that has been used very successfully by Kleiner Perkins and others?


When did negative free cash flow become a call for bankruptcy. If so, then shouldn’t Amazon have been dead a long
time ago? Eros is strongly positive cash flow on an operating basis.


On the balance sheet, there’s been no meaningful increase in current liabilities, while an increase in receivables
would appear to be an expected outcome if a company is generating strong revenue growth.


Long term debt has grown 30% over 2 years, but one would argue that $237 million in debt for a company that will
generate potentially $150 million in Operating Profits next year is not a cause for concern.


Alphaexposure attacks Eros on a growing content library. Again, assertions and accusations, but no actual facts.


Alphaexposure attacks Eros on transactions that occurred in 2011. Throw everything and the kitchen sink and hope a
lot of it will scare most investors and let him rake in profits on his short positions.


B4U occurred in 2008. Dhristi in 2011.


Let’s review AlphaEx’s key assertions:


Claim: “Due to aggressive accounting practices, EROS’ reported earnings are significantly overstating the economic
reality of its business model” 
There’s no evidence that Eros is involved in any illegal accounting practices. The economic reality of its business
model is that revenues have grown 90 fold from $1.4 million in movie production to $150 million plus this calendar
year. The company has a clear expertise and success track record, working with superstars and producing all time
record breaking blockbusters.


Claim: “EROS subsidiary financials reveal a lack of free cash flow and raise many questions about the company’s
accounting” 
A lack of free cash flow does not a worthless company make. Already addressed. Nothing to add. It’s an absolutely
moronic statement.


EROS has enriched its controlling family at the expense of shareholders through a series of related party transactions 
Possibly, though again, no actual evidence has been provided.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-love-eros 41/43


Claim: “ErosNow is poorly positioned to win the battle for streaming media in India and appears to have made
meaningful misstatements to investors” 
ErosNow is meaningless today in terms of a conservative investor’s valuation model. It is a zero. Any success on
ErosNow is gravy. The real value of Eros lies in content production, distribution, marketing, an exclusive content
library, a track record for blockbuster success, an eye for producing superhits, relationships, experience. It would
appear most Hollywood studios would kill for this kind of talent.


Claim: “Based on the company’s persistent negative free cash flow and growing debt and share count, we believe the
stock is worthless” 
Persistent negative free cash flow = worthless? Is Amazon worthless? Are firms funded by venture capitalists
worthless? That’s an asinine, moronic and idiotic assertion. It’s an attempt by a vicious bear to spread fear.


Nor is debt growing alarmingly. Debt has risen 30% in 2 years, but Revenues are up and Eros is positioned for $100
million in revenues. Operating margins are extremely healthy.


Consider whether AlphaExposure provides a single shred of proof in their accusations? Most tellingly, they avoid
mentioning that Eros just producted the 2nd largest grossing film in the history of Bollywood cinema and a host of
other facts.


A reasoned analysis would have acknowledged the huge positives this company enjoys.


A coterie of shorts has engineered a panic. Panic induces flight or fight. Most investors get overwhelmed by the length
of AlphaExpense’s post and capitulate. Capitulate into selling. Fear often produces the wrong emotional response.


You can sell now and watch as these shorts book their profits while you’ll have exited a dominant company with a
huge loss due to a concerted and vicious attack.

I find the discourse on this topic thoughtful on both side of the argument.

CharlesAngoff
I only found one side thoughtful. The other side doesn't seem to understand the company they're shorting and
I hope they're feeling the squeeze. I suggest they liquidate their positions before EROS begins trading again
somewhere near its fair market value. Me personally, I'm looking to pick up more shares as long as the
opportunity lasts.

I must question how much market manipulation is occurring here. There have been some great responses here,
elsewhere on the internet, and by Eros management themselves to these unsubstantiated claims made in this article
and elsewhere. But more importantly, I really believe there's an attempt to manipulate the market going on here. Just
to lay out a timeline:

October 20th: Market Farce, an anonymous Twitter account whose first Tweet was on October 10th of 2015, posts the
first Tweet, questioning the user count of Eros Now, using App Annie. Worth noting, 120/157 total actual Tweets (so
excluding re-tweets) by this user involve Eros.


October 30th: "Alpha Exposure" posts this article, reiterating many of the same claims that @Market_Farce laid out.
Let's also note that this is during Eros International's quiet period (2Q16 results are to be announced mid-November).


November 2nd: Eros addresses all the concerns, along with an independent review by one of the largest law firms in
the world (Skadden Arps, which was ranked by Vault as the third most prestigious law firm in the United States). See
the response here: http://bit.ly/1Pm4Zqh


November 6th: Glaucus Research's Soren Aandahl (who has prior used social media to push the firm's shorts) gives
a presentation at the "Invest for Kids" conference in Chicago, pitching Eros as a short (http://bit.ly/1Pm4Zqj),
reiterating almost the exact claims made by Market Farce and Alpha Exposure.


November 9th: This event is profiled in Barron's and Eros is picked as a short by Soren. While the short thesis is not
fleshed out in this short article, it is prominently displayed under Barrron's index, with the title: "Baidu, Bollywood, and
Beyond" (with Bollywood referring to the short pitch on Eros International)


Now, my question is this: who are all these players? Are Market Farce, Alpha Exposure, and Soren Aandahl three
independent short sellers who happened to come to the same hypotheses and make the same claims against the
same small Indian company, underfollowed in the investment community?


Or is there maybe the possibility that there is a relation between all these players and some obvious market
manipulation is occurring and someone is profiting directly off it?


Here's a great Bloomberg article on such trends: Anonymous Analysts Are Wreaking Havoc in the Asian Markets
(http://bloom.bg/1Pm4Zqm)


Now I'm not a mouthpiece for Eros or a professional investor. I'm just someone who has followed the Eros
International story for a while now. I have invested some of my own personal account (and retirement) in the stock
because I believe in the story and in this management team. I fundamentally believe this stock will work, but it's
painful to watch my investment get hit so hard because of what I believe may be market manipulation by a short seller
who is abusing social media for his own gain.


These are just my personal thoughts that I am sharing. I welcome open debate.

You have penned the thoughts running in the minds of many investors. The similarity in the views of the
shorts at different junctures on a small stock (as you have so rightly observed) seem so close to each other
that one would be inclined to believe its a synchronized orchestration with the purpose of creating panic to
achieve their financial goals by the same entity (or person). As the string of tweets are forced in, achieving its
purpose of creating panic, the elaborate article here makes for widespread acceptance, as the viewers have
already been made to think along the darkest of lines on the subject. The height of disbelief is total when the
readers are not raising any objections to the absence of mention of Grant Thornton (the statutory auditor) by

the author and the freaking mention of some immaterial subsidiary auditor. Why did the author not ask the
same questions to Grant Thornton is a question which never arose due to the psychological fear that has
been generated. Similarly a lot of material issues have been given a convenient overlook and in the fear that
has been generated tend to go unnoticed. Hope there is justice at both ends and if a right picture were to
emerge as opposite to the views expressed here, serious action is invoked for a deterrence of such
orchestrations. I too come with a lot of belief on a management which is in an endeavor to bring in
transparency in an industry which lacked it in the olden times. Moreover it is embracing the new disruptive
world in the best possible fashion. I too believe the digital future is quite bright and the company has the
wherewithal to make the maximum of this first mover advantage which will be significantly beneficial to the
shareholders.

Some of the calculations by the author does not make sense. Looks like the Author does not know that the
Inflation Index from 2011 to 2015 is almost 50% higher. That means the expenditure is going to Increase
every year. Also High budget films are $7 million and above, that does not mean the avg is necessarily $10
million. It could have cost them $20 million/movie. Look at the recent movies and they spend a lot for movies
these days in India. Also Author might not have been to the Movie theatres in India. Its not like USA. Indian
theatres have capacity of 500-1000 and it will be house full. Author might be right on some of the points, but
some calculations way off. lol

Superb Analysis. A Web of Carefully Created Accounting Systems to Benefit the Management. Using India's
Weak/lack of Disciplined Chartered Accountants, Varied Companies are Able to Manipulate Accounting to Suit
Themselves, and Use it Bolster Share Prices, and TRADE BOTH WAYS, AND Make Massive Pickings, at the
Expense of the Small Investors. Inability of Regulatory Authorites to Enforce Strict Disclosure Norms is Aiding
Crafty/Sauvy Managments, who use the MEDIA ENTIRELY TO THIER BENEFIT, AND RIG UP SCRIPS OF THIER
OWN COMPANIES. Hats off for Seeking Alpha for Indepth Coverage and BRINGING OUT THE TRUTH. THIS WILL
BECOME STRONG EYE OPENERS FOR OTHER COMPANIES IN INDIA, AND ACT AS DETERRENT FOR
FRAUDULANT ACTS.  
Hoping to see Coverage on More Indian Companies. Warm Regards.

hey Uttkarsh, I read your views on EROS and found it interesting. I have just invested a big sum in EROS (Indian
entity) recently. Would love to hear your views.
