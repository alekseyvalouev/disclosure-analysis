Anavex: Rebounding With The Help Of A Glorified Stock Promoter
Who Just Fooled The Bulls Again
Jan. 7, 2016 1:49 PM ET402 comments
by: Melissa Davis


Summary


Anavex has staged another impressive rally with the help of a popular biotech
“analyst” who just tried to verify his credentials by producing a rather suspicious
medical degree.


Hoping to reassure Anavex bulls who regard him as a medical expert, Dr. Kanak
Kanti De tried to verify his credentials with a diploma that looks like an obvious
forgery.


According to that diploma, De graduated from medical school long before the vice
chancellor who signed that document ever served in that capacity.


With the SEC already pestering the company about possible stock manipulation,
Anavex can hardly afford to attract even more government scrutiny.


Caught in a no-win situation that could easily grow even worse, Anavex looks
destined to lose most (if not all) of its recent gains regardless of its next move.


Don't be surprised if Anavex (NASDAQ: AVXL) suddenly tries to distance itself from a so-
called doctor who currently ranks as one of its most popular fans. Given the threat
presented by the new regulatory investigation that it just disclosed, Anavex should feel a
little worried about all of THE FAVORABLE COVERAGE THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM
DR. KANAK KANTI DE- especially now that he has chosen to pull a daring stunt that
could set off fresh alarms and lead to even more government scrutiny.


Talk about a reckless move. Confronted with damaging evidence about his professional
background - including his leadership role at a glorified stock-promotion firm that
described him as a retired educator who actually earned his doctorate in English - De
responded with a desperate attempt to preserve his image as a medical expert by
producing a diploma that looks an awful lot like a blatant forgery.


In his rush to reassure the public, De must have somehow managed to overlook a critical
detail that proved revealing enough to help expose the pesky truth.

Although De supposedly graduated from the University of Calcutta with a bachelor of
medicine and surgery in the summer of 1976, the name of the vice chancellor who signed
"his" diploma bears no resemblance to the name of the vice chancellor who actually filled
the position at that time. Rather, that signature belongs to the man who served as vice
chancellor some 20 years later, when he signed another diploma that - other than the
name of the recipient and the date of graduation - looks downright identical to the medical
degree that De has now tried to claim as his own.


Want proof? Go ahead and check out the striking similarities between those two
documents right now. Even the blemishes that appear on the sides of the pages and just
above the vice chancellor's signatures look exactly the same.

Kinda hard to blame a perfect match on sheer coincidence. A professional document
examiner noticed so many similarities between the two degrees that he said that one of
them HAS to be a copy of the other based upon (among other things) the following:


1. The marks on both the left hand side and the right-hand side of the margins are
identical and perfectly aligned.


2. The mark on the top, right hand side of both degrees matches perfectly.


3. The University of Calcutta seal has smudging on it at the 2 o'clock position on both
documents.


4. The "5" in 1975 and 1995 both match perfectly. (It seems unlikely that the same person
would have entered those dates 20 years apart.)


5. The full stops after 1975 and 1995 are in exactly the same spot.


6. The full stops after 1975 and 1995 are in exactly the same spot at the end of both
documents.


7. Both documents have the same day and month recorded for the date that the document
was signed.


8. Both documents have the same day and month recorded for the day that the student
was "admitted to the degree."


Another detail caught the eye of a local source in India: The University of Calcutta
normally holds its graduation ceremonies on Saturdays. While the graduation date that
appears on the newer diploma did fall on a Saturday, the graduation date recorded on the
diploma that De produced fell on a Tuesday instead.


A university spokesperson has confirmed this much already: The University of Calcutta
has no record that De graduated from the school during the year that appears on "his"
medical degree. The diploma that De has presented cannot possibly belong to him - or
anyone who graduated in the 1970s, for that matter - since the signature belongs to the
wrong vice chancellor and the format of the degrees looked different back then. If De had
simply misplaced his degree, he could have easily secured a replacement from the
university for a nominal fee.


Ready for a little more incriminating evidence? As it turns out, The Medical Council of
India maintains a helpful database that allows the public to search for any doctor who has
ever registered with a state medical council anywhere in the country. Plug in

"Mukhopadhyay, Mallinath" - the name of the doctor who earned the degree that looks just
like the one that De supposedly holds - for example, and his record, including the details
reflected on his diploma, automatically shows right up on the screen. Try "De, Kanak Kanti
(or any variation of that name), however, and nothing turns up at all.


Only a message stating "no record found according to your search condition" appears on
the screen instead. Here. See for yourself.

No wonder De tried so hard to change the subject when asked to keep his promise by
producing an even fancier medical degree.


"If you want to see my degrees, become a subscriber and email me and I will be
obligated to show you my degrees," he declared earlier this week. "Anyway, I am in
Europe, and I don't carry around my degrees in a bag so it will have to wait. I had a
soft copy of the MBBS degree (the one signed by the vice chancellor who filled that
post long after De supposedly received that diploma) because another publication
wanted to see it a few months ago."


Oh well. So much for the M.D. that De promised to supply, "if necessary," too. While that
medical degree sure would come in handy at the moment, De can probably forget about
even trying to fool the public by pulling the same kind of trick all over again.


At this point, in fact, De should feel lucky if he manages to survive the likely fallout from
this self-inflicted destruction with any followers left at all. After violating the trust of his loyal
subscribers (not to mention the even larger crowd of investors who read his bullish articles
on popular websites like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool), De can only blame himself
for any future punishment that he happens to endure.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3796626-anavex-rebounding-help-glorified-stock-promoter-just-fooled-bulls 8/95


By lying about something as basic as his professional credentials, De practically invited
the public to start doubting his every word. At this point, he owes the loyal followers who
rushed to his defense a whole lot more than a simple apology.


* Author's Note: When the University of Calcutta reopens next week, I will ask the registrar
to search for any record that De ever attended and/or graduated from the university at all.
Once I obtain that information, I pledge to follow up by sharing what I have learned -
regardless of the nature of those findings. Granted, based upon the evidence that I have
managed to uncover on my own, I feel 99.9% certain that De never graduated from the
University of Calcutta with any sort of medical degree.


On a final note, I want to make sure that De's followers know that I DID contact him more
than a full week before I ever published my original Anavex report. As a matter of fact, I
reached out to him using the very Seeking Alpha messaging system that he has since
described as "foolproof." In the message that I sent to him, captured in the screen shot
below, I asked De whether he had ever received any sort of compensation from ANYONE
- not just Anavex itself - for his bullish coverage of the company. To this day, I'm still
waiting for some kind of a response.

well, there is no science yet..rehashed patent dumped by big pharma for pennies after spending millions.
Horrible one sided ph1 trial... questionable management and researchers on staff...questions regarding
promotional pumps...management has clear history of being part of pump and dump schemes i the past...
muscarenic acetocholine treatment shown 6 years ago to be ineffective. Only difference with avxl is they are
adding aricept.


How do u expect a company tht spent 2.1 million on research last year to overtake big pharmas who are
spending billions every year on AD research?The ceo was paid 1.5 million...


Do urself a favor and research companies (billion dollar big pharma) and their attempt at an AD cure or
treatment in last 10 yrs. The graveyard is littered with promising biotechs who failed miserably in their
attmepts at finding acure or treatment for AD

Why wud she be sued? Just the same way u guys are allowed to enjoy share price increases from PR and
bullish articles, short sellers are allowed to do the same. If anything, the promotion pumpers shuold be sued
and they are being sued by a plethora of firms...


SEC investigation u guy somehow spun into a positive.


She has literally just shown u a forged medical degree from one of the biggest cheerleaders, yet u guys
completely and totally disregard it.


Share price has dropped from almost 15 to below 5.


What will happen is this company will drag u guys along for a few years..dilute the hell of shareholders with
offerings... u will hold on because u are locked in price wise until it gets delisted or files for bankruptcy.


If by a miracle they do get a drug approved it will be years before tht happens but i wouldnt bet on it...

Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
I will respond only once, and then move over to my work of writing my digest and doing my work.


I have been accused of taking money from Anavex. That is libel. If this author or SA continues to post that without
proof, it may be subject of a lawsuit. My only issue is I am not in the US, but I will figure out a way.


Anybody that still wants my digest can email me at kanak2k3@yahoo.co.in and register on drkkd.com.


Final note, I - this person here - has the degree posted here. I took advantage of SA's anonymity option because I do
not want to lose my current job as a practising doctor (MBBS, DGO, Onco-gyno specialty).


I have never taken money from Anavex. Recant that statement, or face litigation in the US.


07 Jan 2016, 02:05 PM


Ian Bezek, Marketplace Contributor
I'm more confused now than before. Are you KKD or the other named doctor or a 3rd party? If you wanted to
be anonymous, why use a real sounding name and claim it was a doctor rather than just KKD Research or
whatever?


Again Melissa, thank for digging. Interesting story you've uncovered.


07 Jan 2016, 02:17 PM


cochiseuofm
Good luck with the lawsuit as, unless I missed something, the author never directly accuses you of accepting
money. She took a screenshot of an unanswered PM asking if you had been compensated and ripped apart a
clearly forged diploma you provided (which you also did not address in your reply at all).


If you wanted to give your opinion anonymously, it would have been pretty easy to just say you were using a
fake name and doing so.

Agree with Ian and something I forgot to leave out in my post. Your explanation makes zero sense, if you
intended to remain anonymous why pretend like Dr Kanak is a real doctor? And if you are someone
anonymous, why are you threatening a lawsuit for libel which would indicate this damages your personal
reputation. How could it do that if you are anonymous?


07 Jan 2016, 02:22 PM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
It would have been easy to resolve this dispute privately. SA allows anonymity, but I never lied about my
credentials. More importantly, I never took money from Anavex - Christopher Missling will ultimately be
subpoenaed and will say so. At that point, this will probably be libel.


As to you, Ian, your dislike for this company has gone beyond any decency expected from a fellow
contributor. Now you say you are confused. What is confusing about my statement - I DID NOT TAKE
MONEY FROM ANAVEX.


07 Jan 2016, 02:26 PM


Bart van Velzen, Contributor
So.. did you post a forged diploma, or did you not post a forged diploma?


07 Jan 2016, 02:29 PM


cochiseuofm
Let me make this simple.


1. Did you provide the diploma shown above?


2. Did you forge the diploma as accused?


3. Are you now saying you did so to maintain your anonymity and that under another name you have these
same credentials?


All yes and no questions, elaborate if you'd like.


Note I am not asking you about accepting money from AVXL. I do think you provided false credentials for
whatever reason based on the evidence given by the author.


07 Jan 2016, 02:33 PM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
I am a practising physician, with an MBBS and a DGO degree, onco-gyno specialty. SA allows anonymity, so I
used that option. If people knew I was working part time as a freelance medical writer even if for fun, I would
lose my job.


SA never consulted me before publishing that original libellous article. I NEVER TOOK MONEY FROM
ANAVEX.


That allegation is libel.

The only thing I violated was SA's own strange anonymity law. They need to know my name, I did not give
them that. I was afraid - as it turns out, rightly so - that they won't respect my anonymity if forced.


Read my articles. I am an oncologist.

BTW, the owner of that original name knows nothing about all this nonsense.

Is it possible to get a yes or no response? Your explanations are confusing...it sounds like you are saying yes
to all three of my questions which fine, no problem. I just don't understand why you went through the
rigmarole to provide a fake one in the first place. It makes zero sense to do so.


07 Jan 2016, 02:47 PM


John Zhang, Marketplace Contributor
Wait, so you're saying your real name is not Kanak Kanti De, and that you in fact produced a forged
document, the original variant of which you obtained from a man without his consent or permission?


07 Jan 2016, 02:56 PM


BuyersStrikeWP
Most touts do not get their money directly from the company. The crims are smart enough to avoid that. Most
of these shills and touts get their money from third parties as has been explained at length by Adam
Feuerstein, Rick Pearson, SIRF Online, and many more.


The fact remains, paid promotion of any kind is a sure sign of a scam. Wake up!


07 Jan 2016, 03:02 PM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
I will say this clearly - I was blindsided by the original article getting published without SA or this author ever
contacting me. The article was libel in so far as the money issue, and wrong in the other respects - a wrong
that could have been righted easily and privately.


Yet this SHORT article was published on 30 Dec, when I was in Europe and the best editors in SA were on
holiday.


I panicked.


I thought I would have to disclose my identity and lose my job.


But even though I may have violated the letter, I do have the MBBS and the post grad.


What I did not violate is - I never took money from a company and promote it to my readers.

That is the lie we are losing track of because of the credential issue.


Some of you will understand, some won't. For those that do, I will continue to publish my digest on my
website.


As you can probably understand, I really don't need the money. This is interesting work, and all I wanted was
to do it while protecting my identity and my job.


So, to answer your questions:


1. yes


2. not sure. it is my degree. me, this author. and my anonymous (pen name).


3. yes

So then your whole biography is wrong? Supposedly you are a retired physician.

Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
My biography is my work. SA allows me to be anonymous. Authors create pen names all the time, even fake
biographies. It protects - in my case - my dayjob and livelihood.


But to say that I was paid by AVXL is libel, slander - and a plain lie.


I urge the CEO of AVXL to clearly say so in a press release. Funnily, I never even corresponded with him
directly. When would I propose he pay me money so I can promote his company?

Ok, you've made the claim you did not take money from Anavex. It sounds like you're parsing something here
because you have not categorically denied taking money to promote AVXL.

Hilarious.


He claims that he is anonymous, so Kanak Kanti De is not his real name, and yet he publishes his degree
with that fake name.


That alone is enough to indict his integrity and credibility, even if every other claim that he makes is 110%
correct and truthful.

Author’s reply »  KKD (or should I refer to you as MM or maybe even some other name instead?), I can't
recant that statement, because I never made it. I did, however, send you a message asking whether you had
ever received any sort of compensation -- from anyone, not just Anavex itself -- for your favorable coverage of
the company. You never bothered to answer that question. In fact, you claimed that I never even contacted
you at all. We both know that is not the truth. Now, you're trying to claim that you chose to publish your work
under a fictitious name because you felt worried about losing your current job as a practicing doctor. How can
you lose your job if you already retired? In case you have forgotten, you describe yourself as a "retired
medical practitioner" in your Seeking Alpha profile. According to your LinkedIn page, however, you actually
hold a Ph.D. in philosophy. (It lists no other educational degrees.) IndoGenic never mentioned anything about
a medical degree when you served as its chairman, either. Rather, that firm described you as a retired
principal with a Ph.D. in English instead. So what am I supposed to believe? For all of those conflicting
reports to be true, you would need to hold two medical degrees and two Ph.D.s, and currently practice
medicine after retiring from lengthy careers in both the medical and the educational fields. How on earth could
one person find enough time to complete four time-consuming degrees, enjoy two very different careers --
and then go on to become a stock "analyst" who writes all sorts of bullish reports about obscure
biotechnology companies? Wow. Tell me that makes sense.

@Melissa - My guess is the Ph.D. is in SEO/Marketing. Some good research and investigation here. I don't
see how it constitutes libel, but for him to serve you he would have to use his real name. That might be the
final piece you were looking for


07 Jan 2016, 04:21 PM


Whattaworld
We need your real name (and to verify your real ID after all this) to see it on the Medical Counsel of India's
database, but that may cause a problem for you professionally. You have your issues but investors have their
own valid issues. You need to decide to restore your credibility, or stop writing on SA. I hope you chose the
former.

Odd you should say that. SA won't reveal the identity of Mako Research to the defendant (Cellceutix
Corporation) or to the court where the Rosen Law Firm filed a shareholder lawsuit using the allegedly false
claims made Mako Research in the SA article "Cellceutix: Empty Office, Unviable 'Science', Misleading
Disclosures, 96% Downside" as the basis for the suit.


Many points made in the article by Mako Research are demonstrably false, including claims that Brilacidin
doesn't work against bacteria types that it wasn't even designed to treat.

Dr. De, this response from Melissa requires your clarification concerning your different careers and being
retired or not for you to keep your credibility intact. I hope you have a good explanation.


Melissa, all of this has nothing to do with 2-73 working or not. Your problem is not even admitting that it might
work and that this can only be proven through properly conducted trials which weighs heavily on your
credibility. You're just talking your book. Dr. De at least left readers with that caveat.


Are you being paid by Lincoln Park Capital or any other person or entity that would benefit from a lower stock
price besides yourself?


Respectfully, Robert Dunn

This is riveting to me. I noticed the same thing Ian. If kanak kante de is a pseudonym, why present a false
diploma to reinforce its authenticity?


I also find it interesting that the threat of a libel suit centers only on the issue of payment from Anavex but
doesn't mention the claim of false credentials.


When this came to press, I wondered aloud and to the editors how it could be allowed to go to print. Now, I'm
thinking that the editors must be somewhat convinced that Melissa Davis' claims are correct concerning
qualifications. If that's the case, this contributor should not be allowed to contribute future content.


I hope this is all a misunderstanding.


07 Jan 2016, 10:36 PM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
"How could it do that if you are anonymous?"


cochiseuofm, this too is a good point. I'm ever amused by Yahoo message board posters who threaten
lawsuits while hiding behind anonymous handles. There's also the issue of "clean hands" in a civil suit for
defamation. Being right about not accepting paments from Anavex but wrong about credentials, or worse,
creating an entire false persona makes any claim a non-starter.


07 Jan 2016, 11:28 PM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
That's evasive Kanak. You chose not to answer a set of simple yes or no questions and regardless of who
you are, you apparently aren't kanak kante de.


So sad...


07 Jan 2016, 11:32 PM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
varan, that is true. In fact, I would urge the author formerly known as Kanak Kante De to issue a very public
apology to Seeking Alpha, each one of his followers, his paid subscribers, and to Melissa Davis.


I do know that the real identity of an anonymous author must now be given to Seeking Alpha. Could it be that
Kanak has been cashing checks from SA under a false name? I hope not.

I once made a comment in one of Kanak's articles in response to his claim that he offered "unbiased biotech
research" that each of us is biased in our own way as a function of our own humanity - culture, nurture,
ethnicity, class etc;. He angrily denied what was to me a simple statement of truth and not a personal attack. I
now see that his response was rooted in the shame that will always stick to those who seek to weave a web
of lies.

From Kanak Kante De's profile found here: http://bit.ly/1OhTVX7


"My name is Dr Kanak Kanti De, MBBS, MD, PhD, retired medical practitioner, cancer survivor, healthcare
sector investor, over 30 years' experience in the sector both in India and the United States."


And today: "I am a practising physician, with an MBBS and a DGO degree, onco-gyno specialty."

Hmmmm,... I use a 'pen name' and the anonymity option as well,.... but haven't ever figured that I should

isn't fake. And am happy to provide my actual information & and abbreviated CV to interested parties.

08 Jan 2016, 11:07 AM


mochajava76
Oh come on, now. If someone (for this example, not Kanak) makes a claim of "unbiased biotech research",
one would not naturally parse the "unbiased" to mean the epistemological sense you stated. One would
interpret "unbiased" in a natural way. So your screed would probably get a reaction. To infer that reaction
indicates guilt of committing a pump and dump is wrong.


The questions of Kanak's credentials are real. I get that. But contrary to many posts, he did say he did not get
compensated for these, and not just from Anavex. On 1/7 at 3:03 he stated "What I did not violate is - I never
took money from a company and promote it to my readers."


I interpret the "a company" to not refer just to Anavex, but also including a 3rd party, as he did not state "that"
company or "annavex". Now, you can question the validity of this, but don't state that he didn't answer that
question.


08 Jan 2016, 11:37 AM


mochajava76
OK, you are a certified Grammar Nazi, with a philosophical background.


http://bit.ly/1n8bEZF


"In the main varieties of English from outside North America, practice is the noun, and practise is the verb.
For instance, we would say that a doctor with a private practice practises privately. There is no such
distinction in American English"


So if you infer that he is lying because he spells it "practising", you are stoooopid. BTW, non-Americans spell
many common words differently.


Really, there are enough real questions about all this without you reading tea leaves and bringing up so called
spelling errors to indicate further guilt

He literally committed a felony if that is not his diploma. It's arguably still a felony but the ethics are different if

09 Jan 2016, 05:31 AM


Arrow Loop Research, Marketplace Contributor
Scrying Biotech,


The author of the article clearly represents speculation as fact respecting the stock promoting. That is to say
that she does not in fact know that Kanak stock promoted. I believe she made a serious error and would
encourage her to hedge her assertions as opinions rather than fact, and apologize to Kanak for the mistake.
Kanak may have a valid claim of libel, in my view, if it is shown that the author made a false and defamatory
statement that was published by a third party - i.e., that Kanak does not actually stock promote as accused.
That is my brief interpretation of the elements. Maybe some lawyers could provide input on this; I am, after all,
only a law student.


In summary, it doesn't matter whether Kanak may or may not have falsified credentials. The author made a
clear choice to implicate Kanak in a stock promoting scheme, and if it is found that Kanak did not stock
promote as accused, you can for sure bet that this author will find herself in deep trouble if Kanak pursues a
case against her. Needless to say, Libel is punished severely. In my view, this author took a very serious

gamble in submitting such an article, when it could have easily been resolved in a private manner in

11 Jan 2016, 04:13 PM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
LCP,


Like you, I never found a shred of evidence amongst the pound of innuendo to support the stock promotion
claim. In fact, having read one of the articles KKD referenced, I found it to be balanced.


As for libel claims, those would be complicated by his changing biography even within this article. He'd have
done much better to have simply not responded altogether except with a lawsuit. I suppose that's why
attorneys tell their clients to remain silent.


11 Jan 2016, 08:18 PM


Mukticat
Amazing or just silly how often people throw around the 'libel threat'? For all the hyperventilating how often
has anyone seen any author anywhere get sued for libel? Like never.


It's a red herring that leads a lot of commentators to wasting a lot of time (see above).


Of course in the case of KKD he almost certainly was getting compensated to promote AVXL so there'd be no
case anyway.


11 Jan 2016, 09:16 PM


Arrow Loop Research, Marketplace Contributor
I agree, and by the way, I have always admired your work on SA.


I find the attacks on this author disturbing, as the most prominent claim presented in the above article is about
his supposed stock promotion scheme, for which there is no concrete evidence. As I stated, I am appalled
that SA has endorsed this article by publishing it on its platform, one that I thought was supposed to give
actionable investment advice rather than facilitate comprehensive ad hominem attacks against proven
authors. With these articles, it seems SA has lost progress by centering the attention of both contributors and
readers on an author who has produced stellar research in the past. I don't see any comments here directed
at refuting the author's research on this particular stock, which is especially concerning to me.


12 Jan 2016, 12:27 AM


Arrow Loop Research, Marketplace Contributor
I don't know why you think the libel threat is frivolous. In my brief study of the law, I have examined many
cases involving claims of libel for which corresponding relief was very substantial relative to other causes of
action. If I was in a similar circumstance, I would most certainly consult an attorney and possibly file suit
against the above author.

WalkTheTalk, Contributor
I knew that he, KKD, is an impostor as medical Doctor years ago after I read his firs couple of articles. The
approaches that he analyzed the data and conclusions that he made are naive not only in our medical
research but also in biotech investment. I questioned him about his degree but he refused to reply.


The more he explained, the more lies he tried to cover.


Thank you, Melissa. You have done a great job to expose this stock promoter or liar. I always skip through
many promotional articles in SA but it was pleasure for me to come across to read your article.


22 Mar 2016, 12:50 PM


Zaphod15
Holy, when did this happen. I stopped looking at AVXL after reading the religious responses to an excellent
critique article last summer, and stopped reading DDKs takes when it was obvious he wasnt partial due to
how he presented the opportunity (anyone familiar with medical/alzheimers knows how difficult it is and the
odds).


This however, is a super interesting turn of events. Great stuff on here and excellent work Melissa.


15 Apr 2016, 05:34 PM


Zaphod15
BS. That is the lamest excuse I've ever heard. Sorry this is a dead thread but too interesting. All his words are
convoluted and carefully chosen, hes still weaving the lie.


15 Apr 2016, 05:45 PM


Zaphod15
Nothing wrong with that. However if it is with an attempt to misstate your expertise and advise investors thats
just plain fraud. It takes any weight out from behind his opinion.


For example, I stopped reading any of his work after wondering why the heck a physician would so vastly
over state the effects and likelihood of their medication working when any medical specialist or neurobiologist
knows otherwise.


15 Apr 2016, 05:47 PM


Zaphod15
Highly unlikely. Too many layers of lies, this person will never follow through with litigation and subject them
self to a discovery process. It most certainly does matter they falsified credentials because the next obvious
questions would be to what end? Even if there is any libel it would likely end his case outright. That would be
suicide for their case. Her article is highly likely from a probability standpoint to not only be correct but to
never have anything but idle threats tossed its way.

If you understand Biotech, they are all Trials and experiments. Given the trials, there is an abundance of
science and that is what Billions of Dollars are spent towards through many companies. The sample size may
be small, but the science and efficacy are undeniable. Curing AD is just an experiment at this point, but AVXL
and many others are utilizing science and results to bring improvements and attempt to create a new SOC.
Next time, read the articles that show science, efficacy, patient results, rather than just a hit piece that does
not refute anything that caused this stock to rise.

It is reversing the unfolding of proteins vs removing the amyloid plaque buildup that is most intriguing. Couple
Anavex 2-73 with Aricept to remove the amyloid plaque simultaneously makes sense.


A compelling gamble at these prices. Shorts, keep up the bashing and pressure so we can continue to buy at
these prices. We will know the viability of Anavex 2-73 sooner than later.


You may be right in a penny stock or wrong in a stock with $15-20 Billion market cap.

She has an extremely self-promoting profile. She also doesn't list her education or expertise to be such a "stellar"
researcher and pundit. Just what are HER qualifications? Curiouser and curiouser.


07 Jan 2016, 02:08 PM


MAYHAWK
To be honest, doing a bit of forensic analysis on the two documents does show such similarities that I would
have a question of authenticity were I questioning a witness in court. Of course, this also begs the question of
how she just happened to find the exact degree which may or may not have been used.


This doesn't, however, address the legitimacy of Anavex as a biotech company nor the validity of the science
behind 2-73.

There is a difference between taking a pen name / alias and making up details to that alias's background to
add to your credibility. I don't think anyone has an issue with the former.

With no checks made by SA on the factual basis of biography content, I wouldn't know. How do you know that
anyone is using their real name or not? This is the internet after all. As for the diploma, I think he rushed to
defend himself after the first attack article and made a decision he probably now wishes he hadn't.


07 Jan 2016, 04:02 PM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
No James, I did the right thing. I saved my day job in India from some nonsense about some company I had
never even heard of a year ago and never took money from.


I only feel sorry that the shorts used this to down that company. I hope they will come out with a press release
that they never paid me.


If there is any good in my work, it will last. If not, it won't. What people think of my work is important to me, not
someone who wants to destroy a possible (1% chance?) cure for Alzheimer's because they want to make a
few dollars shorting a stock.


07 Jan 2016, 04:12 PM


cochiseuofm
I'm sorry...the right thing would have been to never forge a diploma and lie in the first place which was always
an option. For what it is worth, I have found your articles well-written and interesting reads, it didn't really
matter to me what credentials you had. I'm sure others felt the same way. But I really don't like when people
lie for no reason and then say they did the right thing.

"Dr." De: Shorting a stock does literally nothing to the company itself. If they can successfully cure

So James Burke why are you so adamant that this article by Melissa should not have seen the light of day? I
realize you're very bullish on AVXL which undoubtedly colors your opinion but honestly do you not think it
important to know the bona fides of SA contributors?


It's one thing to claim as in your case that you're a 'private investor in speculative stocks' where frankly that
isn't going to unduly influence a lot of readers but what if you claimed you were a practicing oncologist?

Wouldn't that be highly deceptive? Now what if that person were short writing bearish articles on AVXL and
holding themselves forth as some kind of expert? You longs - pardon the expression - would be foaming at
the mouth.


And in fact there is some foaming but it's directed at Melissa for exposing this fraud(!!)


Not only is this highly hypocritical but it's betrays an emotional over-attachment to a stock, to a thesis, to the
point where you crowd out non-confirming negative news and just close your eyes. It also happens to be a
really really bad way to invest.


But with 20 Likes you're in good company with those who rummage under every desk desperately trying to
find any kind of dirt on Adam Feuerstein, Jean Fonteneau, Dr Kline and others, to discredit them yet despise
it when it turns out the only one perpetuating a fraud is AVXL's most outspoken bull.

Although the article contains little analysis of the company in question, Ms. Davis does bring up some very valid and
incisive points on Dr. De's credibility. Am I the only one feeling disturbed that a prominent author in SeekingAlpha
*APPEARS* to have dubious credentials? Nothing against the author personally, but I think SA and Dr. De need to
clarify this matter in an extended response. It's the responsible course of action for PRO users and others paying for
access to Dr. De's Premium Service.


07 Jan 2016, 02:39 PM


MAYHAWK
So, it would appear that Dr. De used the anonymity of contributors allowed by SA to alter his own diploma to preserve
his main livelihood and his identity. Use of nom de plumes is a common practice by contributors so why, in this
instance, is it the subject of so much speculation? I think when the SEC investigation and its circumstances and
targets come to light, there will be a LOT of shorts scurrying for cover, JF, AF and MD included.

Ray Shizzo
LMAO, how could she not contemplate anonymity prior to publishing this? In reality, he does not have to answer your
request at all. Sometimes we get too caught up in our emotions to think about the basics..... SA has been around for
quite a while, this is a well known perk when writing for SA. Melissa, you are trying so hard to bring Anavex down and
it is obvious that you only needed the compensation from these "articles" (if you want to call them that) you write. Why
else would you tag Anavex and then only write about another author on SA that wrote about them? For the record, I
have been following this company since Missling was appointed as CEO, and had a long position prior to the RS and
sold near the ATH.


First of all, anyone making their investment decisions based solely on SA articles is a fool. Anyone with common
sense would have only raised their eyebrows at either Dr. De's or Melissa's articles. It is unusual to get a good
unbiased opinion that covers the meat and potatoes of a biotech company.


Secondly, we all know why people write articles regarding volatile, controversial, publicly traded companies, and it is
not because you guys "really want to protect other investors," it is simply for the compensation you receive based on
the number of clicks you get from the "cult-like" following.


Lastly, I sincerely hope that if in fact you are wrong about Dr. De's credentials (as I suspect you are), that you are
justly reprimanded for doing so.


07 Jan 2016, 02:43 PM


cochiseuofm
So you find nothing wrong with a guy claiming he is a certain doctor, asking for people to subscribe to his

anonymous so I'm using a fake name from the beginning. There are plenty of people on SA who do not

remain anonymous so it is not unreasonable to think someone might be using their own name.


07 Jan 2016, 02:50 PM


Ray Shizzo
Of course I do, it's ludicrous.


07 Jan 2016, 03:25 PM


SludgeReports
Feel the need to chime in here, no one writes SA articles for the click money. Only someone living in a
cardboard box can make a continued living from the clicks. That being said, some authors have engaged with
highly volatile stocks and pumped out stories that I'd estimate a livable wage for the year. However, those
authors also putter out quickly. It's hard work pumping out enough articles for that many clicks, even when the
articles are blatantly lacking in content.


So I doubt Melissa needs the click money.


08 Jan 2016, 06:02 AM


Ray Shizzo
I honestly wish that SA would put a 'views' count on this page, I bet it is a lot more than you think. I believe
initially the compensation is $35 then $10 for every thousand views.


08 Jan 2016, 11:10 AM


Jean Fonteneau, Contributor
Not a very useful article... nevertheless this Anavex story has many ridiculous aspects to it, but now really taking on a
comical turn.


(That said no idea why one would need to remain anonymous to report on biotech and at the same time pretend that

Sorry to bust your bubble Melissa. If one loses a degree and has to get a duplicate, it would be signed by the same
person at the present time of issuance. I know this first hand because it happened to a colleague of mine who was
from India. Therefore all your allegations are incorrect. Moreover, the duplicate is stamped on the back of the newly
issued degree/diploma/certifi...


Therefore there is NO doubt in my mind that the same person signed the documents because one is the original 1995
and the other one is a duplicate 1975....obviously signed by the same registrar, having the same punctuation marks
and stamp smudges.


Can't believe you are this dumb and couldn't figure it out. Do some real research next time.


07 Jan 2016, 03:00 PM


Michael Bachmann, Contributor
That's not what KKD said. He himself admitted to forging the document with someone else's diploma without
that person's consent.


07 Jan 2016, 03:08 PM


cochiseuofm
Except if you read Dr. Kanak's responses above he seems to admit to forging the diploma to maintain his
anonymity. So maybe she did her research just fine?


07 Jan 2016, 03:10 PM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
Sorry to burst your bubble docgastro, but the first way to detect a forged signature is to compare it to the
authentic signature. Are they too much alike? If so, it's a forgery. In this particular instance, it's an exact copy.


Now the question becomes: was it a stamped signature? If so, there'd be a noticeable discrepancy in
articulation resulting in non-alignment, tone, contrast or smudging issues. Again, it's an exact copy.


All we can say for certain at this point is that the contributor claiming to be Kanak Kante De is not Kanak
Kante De and this certificate is not authentic.


Oh, and one other thing. I can safely surmise the Seeking Alpha is now busily reimbursing the subscription
fees tied to the 2 services this "anonymous" author has provided within the MarketPlace environment. Though
likely not a lot of money, there is a material loss to Seeking Alpha that this contributor should make right.


Because the "anonymous contributor" apparently lives abroad, I doubt Seeking Alpha will attempt to recoup
those losses. And though the damage to the credibility of Seeking Alpha and the Marketplace is real, I doubt it
rises to a level requiring litigation to resolve.


This will likely end with the "anonymous author" forging a new "anonymous" identity and starting the whole
process all over again.

Grayson Hooper, Contributor
If Melissa's article is true, it is good journalism -- muckraking definitely has its place. She has presented evidence to
substantiate her claim, now it is up to the writer known as Dr. De to refute it.


Assuming that this can be thought of as a case of public concern: If Dr. De can prove, without any doubt, that the
claims are false, then Dr. De could probably sue for libel. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff, and it is difficult to
prove. This precedent was set by the Supreme Court Case of Philadelphia Newspaper v. Hepps in 1986. An
alternative route of action would be to sue for Defamation by Implication, in which a defendant juxtaposes facts to
imply a negative connection between them.


Any additional thoughts?


07 Jan 2016, 03:03 PM


crewdog
Open - Shut case. "De" has admitted to the forgery. Melissa's defense is the truth. "De" on the other hand
should be the one lawyering-up since I wouldn't be surprised if the SEC doesn't look into this as part of their
current AVXL investigation.

Not sure that the SEC has any leverage on a third party post if there is not a money trail between AVXL and
Dr. De. Moreover, even if Anavex is paying promoters, as long as the promoters told the truth there is nothing
inherently illegal with that, either.

I think part of what happens here is ex-U.S. authors feel out of the reach of regulatory authorities and buffered
from civil suits by companies, investors and even from their contractor - Seeking Alpha. For certain, they're
less likely to be held accountable.


Additionally, after dividing my average article payment by the average number of hours needed to write it, I
get somewhere between 5 an $7 per hour. Someone authoring from the Philippines, for instance, and
spending the same amount of time doing it, would get about 50-$70 per hour. That's a considerably more
motivating proposition.


08 Jan 2016, 01:27 AM


barn find
This is getting funny.... No disrespect to Dr. KKD, but he has almost zero to do with AVXL, and most longs I know
thought he was actually a "soft basher" when he first wrote on avxl... I think he was actually asked to have a look at
the co by a retail investor initially and he responded with his report... Your apparent lack of ability to see his
significance with AVXL, and now focus on him as a negative factor... is actually somewhat comical... and either point
to poor journalism or the article is somehow intended to being used as a tool in some kind of market trading activity...


07 Jan 2016, 03:04 PM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
That is the irony here.


Initially, people told me I was bashing AVXL. Now they are saying I was paid to promote it.


In all that, my anonymity and my job was in danger because SA allowed this to be published without clarifying
with me.


I do not trust them to keep my identity confidential, not now.


Hence I refused to disclose my name, and they stopped my contribution as of now.


However, read my articles and read those of any biotech author who does not have a bio background.


Do I sound like I graduated with a pol sci degree?


I am sorry to my readers for the trouble, but my intention was only to protect my job and my identity, and I
never - in spirit- did anything wrong.


I also never took money from Anavex - in fact, I was very thorough with the company, as a doctor without a
cogsci background trying to understand an AD company would be.

I have read your work, and I find it to be well written and factually accurate from a scientific standpoint. From
what I can tell, you're a good man with honorable objectives, and your level of education is accurately
reflected in your writing. However, with all due respect, I do wish you had disclosed writing under a
pseudonym.


07 Jan 2016, 03:18 PM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
You are quite correct, in retrospect, I should probably have. But SA would not let me write without learning my
real name. As I can see now from how this article was allowed to be published without asking me for
clarifications, my job would be at stake if I had given them that.


My body of work is not a lie. That's all i can while I ask my readers' forgiveness for the (white?) lie.


But bottomline, the attack on AVXL is just like this - flank attack.


I still remember asking that Kline person to come to a debate with Prof Maurice. It never happened. He said
he could not do that because of the killings in France.


07 Jan 2016, 03:52 PM


SlapAndTickle
One question....Did you really interview Dr. Missling? If so, and you have a contact with him, the best thing to
do is to simply ask him to politely make a public statement that AVXL has never hired or paid a promoter on
SA or any other site.


07 Jan 2016, 04:51 PM


DrADKline
I stated that I did not wish to continue one particular discussion because, understandably, there were, at the
time, real world concerns of more pressing importance than Anavex.


Prof. Maurice, as I'm sure you are aware, is the co-founder and CSO at the pre-clinical CRO Amylgen, in
Montpellier, France (http://bit.ly/1YQg2xd). This CRO has principally served Anavex's needs but will likely
have many further projects in the future. It appears to be a professionally run operation, with award-winning
staff, and I had (and have), no desire to involve them further in what is fast becoming a debacle. Preclinical
Alzheimer's rodent data has a very poor record of predictivity of efficacy in man. If this (as I believe) proves to
be the case in this instance, it will not necessarily be a reflection on the CRO. It would, however, be
somewhat indicative of a number of missing preclinical de-risking studies that Anavex have failed to source
from other qualified providers.


Many people following this story (myself included) have concerns over the proposed mechanism of action of
Anavex 2-73, and the claims of potential efficacy made off the back of the Ph2a trial design. These concerns
will not be validated, or otherwise, by debate, but by data. Such data will not come from an uncontrolled trial.
Like it or not, it's perfectly possible for patients on donepezil to see limited decline even over extended

UK. I worked briefly for AstraZeneca, and then for close to a decade, for Eisai - specifically on Alzheimer's
disease. I am no longer active in scientific research having changed jobs, and country of residence, for
personal reasons on my own volition. I have not been paid in any form for any scientific opinion I have ever
offered on Seeking Alpha of any form of social media. I have never been a consultant (paid or otherwise) for
The Street, or any other financial, medical or pharmaceutical web site. If, however, anyone politely asks me
for an honest opinion, I will generally provide it.

Speaking as an anonymous contributor, I'd have to agree with Grayson. Your writing is of high quality and it is
appears that you have a strong scientific background (although I do not have the scientific background to
properly evaluate that).


However, it was a mistake not to disclose that you were writing under a pseudonym. As well, if I am reading
your comments accurately, it appears that you represented that Kanak Kanti De was your real name to
Seeking Alpha as well... If you didn't trust SA to protect your anonymity, you probably should have just not
written here rather than be untruthful about your name to them.

It is HIGHLY unusual to see companies, or their associated service providers, indirectly releasing any form of
information relevant to ongoing trials through a contributor on Seeking Alpha - particularly when that
contributor is unassociated with any recognised journalistic organisation. I've never seen it previously. I can
also guarantee you won't be seeing it from Anavex, Amylan or Prof. Macfarlane again.


The reasons for that should be fairly obvious. There is a complex system of ethics governing clinical trial
practice (i.e. ICH GCP) which companies do their best to stay within. Effective control of information release is
an important part of that. This particular episode demonstrates exactly why.


I certainly have no problem with people writing under pseudonyms on any platform. It's their right to express
their opinions, just as I express my own. The one episode I have specific issues with is the public release of
patient testimonials via this particular contributor's account. The trial is ongoing, open-label and hence subject

to placebo effect which could damage the data integrity. I thought it particularly poor judgement on the part of
the study PI to allow it to happen.


The one question I would have for the contributor working under the pseudonym of Kanak Kanti De is this -
was he completely clear with Assoc. Prof. Macfarlane on his status before securing those patient
testimonials? Otherwise he may have put the PI in an extremely difficult position with Australian regulators
(http://bit.ly/1Pi1gVz).

manuscripts on compounds in clinical trials, the executives at biotechs with doctorates expounding on the

Dr. Kline, it would be my contention that the subjects were already taking Donepezil for an extended period
and 2-73 was added. There was a baseline already established prior to starting subjects on 2-73.


Therefore there is absolutely preliminary efficacy that may be able to be attributed to 2-73. I concede the next
phase will have to verify these results before getting to excited about its prospects.


This is the first presentation from you where I've finally seen a concession from you implying no one knows
yet if this compound has a chance of working instead of an outright denial of any viability or consideration.
Thanks, I appreciate that.


As Scrying Biotech said, "this is an experiment". Just as any early stage compounds are. Anyone building it
into more isn't being honest. The only statement from Anavex concerning this was cautiously optimistic, a
long way from a slam dunk.


Lane Simonian has written some compelling arguments in the SA forum that I would like to hear your take on
if you can find some time.


Respectfully, Robert Dunn


08 Jan 2016, 09:01 PM


Jean Fonteneau, Contributor
Excellent points DrADKline. It always seemed clear to me that KKD was provided some special access to
some company data and some trial data which sounds like a potential violation of Reg FD and trial protocol.  
It seems quite strange that any company would give access to a fictitious person and why...


(I have seen in this thread that KKD says he was never in contact with Mr Missling yet he published an
interview with Mr Missling, that's a bit confusing... Also was he in contact with the company and Prof.
MacFarlane using his real identity or a fake identity?)


Anavex already didn't need this to clearly appear as a company trying to portray itself as something other
than what it is, but this (especially next to the "Anavex may actually cure Alzheimer" title, still baffled that
anyone would make such a claim out of the blue at such an early stage and given history) adds another layer
of misrepresentation.


09 Jan 2016, 02:43 AM


DrADKline
rkd1961 - I have never stated that the drug cannot work. I appreciate, however, that I use SA infrequently and
much of the relevant discussion has occurred elsewhere.


My main contentions are: 
- Given the known properties of Anavex 2-73, the proposed mechanism of action (dual sigma/muscarinic
receptor agonism) does not sufficiently predicate efficacy in man.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3796626-anavex-rebounding-help-glorified-stock-promoter-just-fooled-bulls 41/95


- The very positive spin (http://bit.ly/1HG8xfe) put by Anavex on open-label, 5 week trial data from a tiny study
cohort was completely unwarranted.


With regards to the second point above, I have already put up a reasonably detailed summary of the
contrarian view supported by appropriate references (http://bit.ly/1nZlw2A), which I am happy to discuss. In
summary, however, it is perfectly possible for the existing data to be explained by a combination of donepezil
and placebo effects - regardless of the fact that participants were taking donepezil for at least three months
before the trial. If Anavex supporters wish to turn the debate to science, then by all means take that analysis
(and supporting references) apart scientifically.


With regards to my concerns over mechanism of action these would be better explained in a single blog post.
If it would be helpful to have a contrarian view on that, and the preclinical studies, I'll try and find the time to
do so.


Finally, although it seems to be an obsession here, it would be better if posters did not try to involve Anavex,
or their service providers, in public debates on their data on this (or any social-media) forum. That has already
been damaging enough to the company, and, given the release of PI-supplied patient testimonials via a
contributor account which has now been cancelled due to violation of SA policies, may yet prove furtherly
problematic for that particular trial PI.

to have when evaluating this company(or any for that matter) as an investment.

Unless SA takes quick and swift action, it will be forever marred with this episode as a safe place for such people as
Dr. De who has himself provided enough evidence for his lack of credibility and honesty ("1. Kanak Kant De is not my
real name, 2. Here is my diploma in the name of Kanak Kanti De"). Whether Davis is credible or not is completely
irrelevant for this conclusion.

Does anyone else notice the glaring absence of comments by Davis? She slings the mud and then leaves others to

07 Jan 2016, 03:29 PM


The Lawman, Contributor
I agree with some of the previous comments that whether you did or did not post a falsified medical degree has
nothing to do with the science that underlies AVXL's drugs. If Anavex 2-73 shows any effectiveness in treating
Alzheimer's, epilepsy, or any other related disorders, the company will be highly successful, and its share price will
rise exponentially. If 2-73 does not work, Anavex will likely fail, or languish as a penny stock, unless any of its other
drugs prove to be safe and effective.


That being said, I believe it is incumbent upon you, as a contributor of articles on AVXL, to address the author's
contention that you posted a bogus medical degree in one of these articles. In the absence of proof that this medical
degree is authentic, or some plausible explanation is offered as to why you posted a bogus degree, accompanied by
proof that you do, in fact, have a medical degree, it is my opinion that you will lose all of your credibility as a legitimate
biopharma commentator, and whatever you write will be disbelieved or disregarded.


In that I have found a number of your articles to be well-written and informative, I truly hope you will be able to clear
your name in the manner suggested.


Best of luck to you.

I was under the impression that the SEC was investigating ANAVEX, not because of the principals at the
company, but rather because of stock manipulation by shorts and their cohorts?


If am not mistaking, none of the principals at ANAVEX have traded their stocks. So what's your point? In fact,
many longs have called on an SEC investigation because the stock was being manipulated by shorts.


As for the class action lawsuit, I hope they can provide sound evidence of any wrong doing! Any law firm can
file a class action lawsuit. Gives them visibility! Good luck finding plaintiffs that actually have a credible case!
Worse case scenario, this type of lawsuits will help bring to light the real culprits.

My point @jamb. It should be obvious. There are too many red flags for a wise investment in Anavex,

considerable sum.

The Lawman, Contributor
I think what you are saying, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that you took your actual medical degree, and
replaced your real name with your per name, Kanak Kanti De, in order to protect your anonymity. That would have
been perfectly fine if you had simply disclosed that this is what your were doing. However, by withholding that
information, and implying this was a medical degree issued to you, in what you led your readers to believe was your
real name, you opened yourself up to an attack upon your credibility that Ms. Davis exploited.


Ms. Davis now goes on to challenge your claim that you needed to protect your anonymity because this would effect
your current employment by pointing out that you have described yourself in other publications as being retired. If so,
Ms. Davis asks, why did you need to write under a pen name? I think it would be helpful to respond to this contention,
as well as to Ms. Davis' claim that you posted a bogus medical degree.


We are a very forgiving nation, and most people can accept a mistake having been made when the truth is revealed,
and true contrition is shown. If you did what Ms. Davis suggests, you should clearly explain what you did, and why,
show contrition for this apparent deception, and ask for forgiveness for having made a bad decision, which appears to
have been made without any malicious intent.

compelling, regardless of the rest of the company's current situation. De has pointed this out in a way that's logical
and even restrained.


This present article has nothing to do with Anavex so much as it is a personal attack made public and given an air of
success because Dr. De has gone to such lengths to maintain his anonymity.


At the end of the day, I still have respect for Dr. De, but I can't say the same for the author of this article. This title is
just irresponsible. Glorified stock promoter? The title itself is a blatant insult to a top biotech contributor here.


That stuff like this gets published is probably why I hear about increasing negative sentiment towards Seeking Alpha
and that should be a bothersome problem for the community as a whole.


Dr. De, I've found your articles well-written and researched and I'd say your medical/scientific knowledge is of a
breadth and depth that allows for thorough and accurate analysis of many different biotech companies. I think the
community would be disadvantaged were you to stop writing here. I like the science a lot more than the shallow
gossipy nonsense in the present article.

Seriously now, who believes (hook line and sinker) any SA author anyways? I also doubt anyone would put any faith
in any "offshore" credentials listed of any SA author, and likely also very little faith even in American credentials, as it
is very much a buyer beware type of situation on SA with pump and dumps and distort articles common, and relying
on credentials would be very risky IMO ... I am not saying its good to fake credentials, but the fact that the author is
focusing on this, is another funny aspect of this article ..... who is the Mr. Adams that she works for again? This article
completely discredits both articles the author has written on AVXL...

I'm far from convinced that he used his own diploma in this forgery. Why would he bother to change the dates?
Seems particularly convenient that this diploma happened to also be available for download from the web. He claims
to be an oncologist yet the real owner of this diploma, Dr. Mollinath Mukherjee, has his own webpage
(http://bit.ly/1PMOtxf) and lists all his qualifications and degrees, yet oncology is strangely absent. Hmmmm 
Regardless, the ball is in his court now to restore any credibility he may have left. If he is Dr. MM I don't think he
needs to worry about anonymity anymore ... that train has already left the station.

Avanex clearly has some very good science behind their investigational drug. The company is a speculative

complete.

Um, people, you do realize Kanak De has nothing to do with Anavex, don't you? Whether he is a medical doctor,
President Obama in disguise, or a circus clown has nothing to do with Anavex. And why does this article talk about
Anavex anyway? Kanak De has been writing for SA broadly across the entire biotech spectrum for quite a long time. I
enjoy his articles and his perspective, but that is all it is, his perspective. Obviously just another disgusting smear
campaign against a promising biotech so the Martin Shkrelis of the world (who, by the way, used to use SA articles to
write all sorts of nonsense against companies he was shorting(Davis is 'short only') can rape the stock market. Hope

Quite an entertaining read of the comments on this story. I have no idea what Anavex does and really don't care. But I
am amazed at the number of people coming to the defense of an author that lied about his credentials and forged a
diploma using what he now says is an alias. Reminds me of Madoff (not that this is a Ponzi scheme). He thought he
was caught many times but just lied some more and somehow everyone kept on believing because they didn't want a
good thing to end.

All this accusation to bring down the share price of Anavex. The company has posted good preliminary phase 2

Dr. De's misrepresentation of his credentials is damaging to his credibility, but Ms. Davis cleverly infers that he was
paid by and/or affiliated with AVXL to promote the company. Ms. Davis, do you have any corroborating evidence to
support your inference? Dr. De stated emphatically three times in the comments section that he was not paid by
AVXL.


Remember, SA is a collection house of OPINION pieces wtitten by various authors. Why doesn't Ms. Davis critique
Jean or Adam's opinion pieces? They are laden with innuendo, distortions and irrelevant facts from years ago. These
opinion pieces have been dissected and refuted, yet continue to be cited by Ms. Davis as fact. Interestingly, none of
these authors accepted offers to debate the merits of the science.


So AF and JF opinion pieces get a "free pass" from Ms. Davis because they reinforce the theme of her opinion
pieces. In all the negative articles, the science was merely a side note with emphasis on smearing and discrediting
the company and scientific community involved.


Though these are just opinion pieces, Dr. De's credibility should be called into question. Likewise, Ms. Davis and
Adam's credibility should be called into question too. The premis here is Dr. De is "pumping" for his own agenda, one
must ask, is Ms. Davis et al bashing for their own agenda? Here is some reading material to help round out the
credibility debate.


http://bit.ly/zcz1QE (Does Dr. De have a Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) have website
dedicated to him?)


http://bit.ly/1lU4Hmp


http://bit.ly/17S25QU (scroll past Hunter Adams association with the Gambino crime family, and a little more than half
way down, you'll see Ms. Davis' activity)


A fair question to ask; do Dr. De's actions make him less credible than Ms. Davis, AF, FJ, Martin Shkrlei etc?


This perceived witch hunt is nothing but a distraction to the key question at hand. Does the science work? Ms. Davis,
do you have any insight to offer on this seemingly most important question?

reasoning..IF all these people could so easily ignore Anavex, why aren't they? They all say none of them have any
position, than what is their interest? Protecting the shareholder by driving the price of the stock down? Anavex must
really have something special to have this many sharks in the water. Can't wait for the FDA and AVXL to disclose their

attract even more government scrutiny"


The SEC has not indicated who the target of the investigation is. SEC and all investigative agencies cast a wide net in
gathering information that may help with their investigations. You imply here they are going after AVXL when you do
not know that. Do you have or know of source documents that state AVXL is the target? A press release by an
ambulance chaser law firm is not the SEC. If so please post it. Are you being intentionally deceptive or you are being
very shoddy in your research?

Kanak De has nothing to do with Anavex. It makes no difference whether he is a medical doctor, a clown, or Luke
Skywalker. He writes a morning column across the entire biotech sphere, with an occasional article on various
companies. Anavex, especially since Dr. Missling has been running the ship, is a very promising biotech that, with any
luck, could bring new relief to loved ones suffering from Alzheimer's across the planet.


Ms. Davis and her cohorts are obvious stock manipulators, just like the early days of Shkreli (who also published
these exact type of trashy pieces on SA while shorting). Rest assured that, even if Ms. Davis is not shorting directly,
her cohorts are. Anyone who doesn't see that is blind.

Playing With Fire
Did anyone here so concerned with a contributors identity ever Google or otherwise research the name "Dr. Kanak
Kanti De" in your DD? What good is having a pen name for anonymity if you say it is so? Most of us have user names
we weren't born with and we don't disclose it...it's a traditional privacy precaution. As for the certificate, if you earned it
and it's yours, are you really forging it to scribble your pen name in? who cares if it was 1975 or 1995. I prefer the
more updated education anyway. Claiming you're retired is part of hiding your true identity (I never slander ISIS or
Obama on social media without doctoring my name and location).


I agree with those who say we should never rely upon an Internet persona to be true or give us stock buying advice.
He could be Dr. Kuntakinte for all I care. I vetted him by the content of his product and didn't delude myself that I
could 100% trust a internet stranger's opinion. He said he's An Industry Outsider and that is true enough.


07 Jan 2016, 11:17 PM

There's more to the AVXL story then what we are seeing.


The attacks are relentless on the stock and the company's past is what they are using. The lawsuits that we are
seeing scream ambulance chaser to me. In the end the only thing that will tell if AVXL is a good investment or not is
the science.


The speculating, pumpers and bashers both, have made this company toxic in so many ways. The twitter comments
from some people are outlandish, and at the same time it makes me wonder why some of the people that "claim" to
have no financial interest in Anavex are the ones that have attacked it relentlessly.


Personally, I am invested, small in nature to many but enough that this company has my attention. If the stock goes to
zero I will still keep a roof over my, food in my stomach, and clothes on my back. If it goes up to it's potential maybe I'll
take the family on a nice trip. Either way I'm in this till the end, and the pumpers and bashers can waste their time, I
actually find it a little entertaining in some ways.


As for this article, Dr. De, in my opinion, brought good information to the site. I also believe that he/she has come
clean in regard to writing under a pen name. Was the article justified? Eh, who knows. Should it have used Anavex in
the title? Probably not, because Dr. De stands on his or her own merits, and as far as I can tell not paid to promote
the company.

out of all the stocks Dr. De wrote about, why did you choose ONLY Anavex to relate to the issue, Melissa?


If his credibility is questionable, then his analysis regarding ALL of the companies he writes about should be
questioned and not only Anavex which you clearly include in the title and bullet points. Is the objective of this article
Dr. De or Anavex?

Jail time for doctor De! AVXL seems to be just a pump. And now I am a bagholder with 500 shares. Hopefully the
company won't go bankrupt.

If you see 5.50 sell. LPC is allowed to buy at previous days low (or average of 3 previous days lows, their
choice) and dump like crazy with no holding period. It could get back to 6 but it's going to zero at some point.

Factually incorrect. "LPC is allowed to buy at previous days low (or average of 3 previous days lows, their
choice)"


AVXL solely determines if/when LPC buys shares.


08 Jan 2016, 09:13 AM


Mukticat
Actually you're wrong inforthelonghaul (but so is skwirrlmaster) . . . until the SEC approves the S-3
registration application AVXL is not going to be able to sell LPC anything. They applied on Oct. 26th, 2015,
and they still haven't gotten approved. That alone is very odd.


http://1.usa.gov/1PPKr8K


And btw skwirrl is right LPC does get to buy at an average price below the previous days' trading prices
whenever AVXL decides to put shares to them.

SEC investigating ANAVEX, not because of the principals at the company, but rather because of stock manipulation
by shorts and their cohorts many on SA. 
SA should be shut down. Too much drama,getting like Facebook!

Scrying Biotech, Contributor
victory711,


SA should not be shut down. It's my go-to source for opinion on biotechnology stocks where the thoughts of
an investor/author are given as much consideration as those of a corporate executive or sell-side analyst.


I do think that the platform needs to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. I say this only
because the editors of Seeking Alpha have told me time and again in response to my concerns that they don't
want to play the role of regulator.


Were Seeking Alpha to be shut down, it would be the greatest loss to the retail investment community that I
could possibly think of.

Probably the lamest and most unintelligent comment here. You think ppl shouldn't buy the stock based on this
article?? Haha wow. Basher, pumper, short or long, no one should base trades and/or investments on this
well researched but totally irrelevant paper which doesn't even attempt to discuss the company. You and
many others are obviously the many cronies that follow the advise and reporting of MD, AF and JF, who not
only don't touch what matters here, the science, but even if they wanted to talk science have zero credentials
in doing so. And plainly, can't. The sharks are in avxl waters for a reason. If a small company like avxl were
take the SOC in the AD market, are you kidding me? BP is behind all this BS. It's disgusting, unethical and
reality. So good, please base your "investment" on pieces like this. You are just a follower, incapable of DD.
Dr. De, I appreciate your writing, regardless of your pen name and credentials. After all, AF has a poli sci
major, and apparently those credentials do what for his analysis of companies? This is ridiculous, and a total
waste of my time. Melissa, you have alterior motives, clearly. SA ought to be ashamed of themselves for
allowing a personal attack to be posted here. So now what, I want a personal attack written on MD! Who's up
for it

A few closing thoughts on the contributor formerly known as Kanak Kanti De.


I do believe this person when he states: "I have never taken money from Anavex." That said, I find it interesting that
he is imploring the CEO of Anavex to verify this claim almost as if it's his obligation to do so. Were I the contributor
formerly known as Kanak Kanti De, I'd be more concerned that the CEO of Anavex was miffed by being associated
within this ideational imbroglio.


I don't believe the contributor formerly known as Kanak Kanti De is a practicing physician. I say this for reasons
having little to do with the forged diploma or his stated claim in his bio that he is a retired physician. What I want
people to do, is to read the comments section of this article http://seekingalpha.co... published on September 11,
2015. Once there, you'll find the following statement.


"I write about GERN and GILD more because that gets me the largest audience for this piece that takes me 5 hours
or more every day to write."


The piece referred to by the contributor formerly known as Kanak Kanti De is the daily Premarket Biotech Digest
which I enjoyed reading from time to time (especially if a stock I owned was mentioned). This statement, however,
raises two important questions.


1. Would a practicing physician have more than 5 hours daily to devote to writing on Seeking Alpha?


2. If indeed a practicing doctor, why would that person be concerned about contouring the content of the piece to
garner the most page views?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3796626-anavex-rebounding-help-glorified-stock-promoter-just-fooled-bulls 61/95


On the basis of time and remuneration alone, I find it difficult to believe that the contributor formerly known as Kanak
Kanti De is a practicing physician. Retired? Perhaps. Though I'd bet against that as well.


Interestingly, the Premarket Biotech Digest daily made the most viewed article thread on the home page of Seeking
Alpha. Though not published as Pro content, $35 plus page views likely made for an average take in excess of $100.
Even if we stick to that low end, the contributor formerly known as Kanak Kanti De likely made in excess of $2,200 per
month on that missive alone. While not earth shattering, it compares nicely to the average monthly salary in India as
of $479 a month. You can find that here: http://bit.ly/1n7K4M6


In fact, it's quite lucrative even when compared to the average salary of a doctor in India of $8,008 yearly which you
can find here: http://bit.ly/1n7K4M7


So was the contributor formerly known as Kanak Kanti De traveling in Europe when he heard of this news with a copy
of his diploma conveniently tucked in his pocket as claimed? Possibly. His income from Seeking Alpha was the envy
of most every practicing physician in India by a factor of at least 3:1 and traveling the world was a privilege made
possible to him through his association with Seeking Alpha.


It's far more likely though, that the contributor formerly known as Kanak Kanti De was at home by his computer when
he first saw Melissa's piece and entered into a state detectives describe as "full tilt boogey mode" in which the shock
of an event causes one to make a series of escalating mistakes to cover up what has now been disclosed. Losing the
income of an elite in his home country is a devastation few of us could comprehend in the U.S. unless Seeking Alpha
was paying us 3x what the average physician makes here, or $521k annually (based on $173,860 as found here:
http://bit.ly/1n7K4M8 ).


Always be well...

I will submit the basic premise of SA is akin to that of open-source software: the more eyes on means a qualitatively
better end result. The validity of this premise is subject to much debate with this thread being a great example. I like
reading the variety of SA opinions some of which I follow, some I am left trying to see "how they got there" but when
the sun goes down I am still the one who clicks the submit button when I initiate a trade.

George how could you kick kanti off and leave Melissa on. is her article any better? If you asked me that was
a personal attack and that should not be allowed. can you answer why you would let this go? Will you now be
forced to go back into all the contributing writers to seeking Alpha and make sure everything that they have
put out there is accurate 100%. If not will they be kicked off as well. I think you're creating an environment
here that allows people to put up false info and not do good fact checking

George, my name is not Kanak Kanti De. I feel lucky not having shared my real identity with you, because the way
that first article was published was unprofessional and a betrayal.


To readers that like my hard work, my honest biotech analysis, my website is drkkd.com and my work is available
there.


Apart from that, George, I wish you all the best.


08 Jan 2016, 10:40 AM


Michael Bachmann, Contributor
Unprofessional why? Because you got caught? You haven't denied any of the allegations and, in fact,
confessed to one of them.


She never alleged you got paid by Anavex, she said you worked for a firm that does stock promotion. Is that
part true as well? Why haven't you stated, in these words, "I or my company have never been compensated
by Anavex for my writing."


08 Jan 2016, 10:51 AM


Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
I have stated it so many times I lost count. Here, I am stating it again: I never got paid to write about AVXL by
anybody except SeekingAlpha. That accusation was slander. Having published it without asking me at least
once, SA participated in slander. Everything else I have done so far over the New Year holiday when I was on
my vacation, is a knee jerk reaction to a major betrayal.


You are a contributor and you have to eulogize SA. I like SA too - they are still providing me an opportunity to
defend myself here.


I just asked one thing - they should have given me an opportunity to defend myself before publishing a major
accusation on the last day of 2015.

some of what has happened is wrong?


Now consider how that article got published. I am constantly in touch with SA and I never knew about it.


How can I trust them with my day job, my livelihood, and my family's future by disclosing my identity to them?
I did everything I could without giving that up - my work speaks for my education and expertise.

I have read your statement (http://bit.ly/1VQeFtp), indicating that you are the legitimate bearer of the second,

avoid a breach of '6. UNETHICAL ACTS: 6.1 Advertising' of the MCI Code of Ethics Regulations, 2002
(http://bit.ly/1VQ1Fnn) you have disregarded B. Duties and responsibilities of the Physician in general: 1.1
Character of Physician. I find it somewhat surprising that, at this stage of proceedings, you continue to refer
readers to your subscription site.


08 Jan 2016, 11:15 AM


Michael Bachmann, Contributor
Ok I believe you. However, you never actually stated that before. If you were being very careful, legally,
stating "I have not gotten paid by Anavex to write about their company" could be true even if your firm was
being paid to promote them. And no one has stated it as a fact just asked you if it was true.


About the last part, no one cares if you were writing anonymously. What people care about is pretending that
you weren't writing anonymously and making up a fake persona. You went to the extent of literally forging a
medical degree. That is a felony.

I think the statement that the people are looking for is 'For the articles wrote, I have never received any direct
payment from the company or payment to me via third parties (either recipients or payees or both).'
Surprisingly, even after so many iterations Dr. De, who apparently can use English very effectively in his
articles, has not made such a statement.


That will settle the issue of payments. However, he cannot now retract the admission of the forgery, no matter
what his motivations for it were. Whether that is criminal or not does not matter. It sure clearly justifies the
action that SA has taken, and his protests are nonsensical.


He seems to be a very naive poseur, as a person more sophisticated in such matter would not garble his
responses so much as he has done in so many responses.

I certainly agree. This article does not help SA, and it certainly does not help investors and readers, in my
view. Why did SA publish this type of article, yet reject so many others (including many of my own) that at
least provide investors with actionable investment ideas? This article is completely valueless; the only thing it
has done is malign the character of a Seeking Alpha contributor. This was not just an average contributor, but
was one who was producing important articles that provided substantial value to those who read them,
including me time and time again. I am appalled by the fact that Seeking Alpha editors even considered this
piece, let alone published it. For all this talk about attempting to become the world's leading platform for
financial discourse, this is certainly not the way to start on that goal.

The Critical Investor, Marketplace Contributor
To me you can consider yourself lucky still being a Marketplace contributor, after having many articles
rejected. Marketplace contributors do represent above average quality, and the authors I know don't have
their articles rejected at all.


Luckily LCP isn't presenting the majority of Marketplace contributors if any at all with his view, who are quite
happy to see KKD banned from publishing again, as he was a complete disgrace to the community. Maybe
you should reconsider your Marketplace contributorship as well, as you don't seem to be able to align your
interests with those of us Marketplace contributors and Seekingalpha as a whole.


12 Jan 2016, 06:30 AM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
Is this the above average quality you speak of: http://bit.ly/1OfzLyk?


Furthermore, are you, The Critical Investor, taking it upon yourself to speak for the "majority of Marketplace
contributors"? How magnanimous of you sir. We're all truly impressed.


And finally, while I too supported his banning I couldn't possibly describe myself as "happy" about it. What a
strange adjective to describe your feelings. And just for my own edification, what exactly are the interests LCP
is supposed to be aligning himself with?

Arrow Loop Research, Marketplace Contributor
Unlike you, I care when someone who has contributed substantially on this platform is maliciously targeted by
an author who has no experience writing quality articles on Seeking Alpha. He may have falsified his
credentials, which was undeniably a mistake, but that does not excuse what has happened to him here, by
you and by many other contributors.


As far as my contribution goes, I have had many articles rejected in the last few months because I have
focused on technicals to time my option strategies. As you know, Seeking Alpha is not very interested in that
approach (yet ironically it is interested in the approach employed in the above article, which literally
accomplishes nothing along the lines of providing actionable investment information). Moreover, I have
focused on insider activity and upcoming catalysts to inform readers about stocks that many have not heard
about. I have had my fair share of losers, but many of my options strategies and other investment ideas have
done me, my investment group, and subscribers to my research very well.


I am puzzled by your open hostility to me. I suspect that you are simply jealous of him in light of his past
success as a marketplace author. I have read your content and I don't see much quality in it, sorry to say. You
focus on an industry that has been declining for over 4 years. How pitiful.

Of all the SA contributors I've read - and there's been dozens and dozens - KKD always came across as exceptionally

Calling Dr. De a "glorified stock promoter" - really? Has the author even read Dr. De's articles that reference AVXL,
including the interview with CEO Missling where Dr. De questions the potential legal issues regarding the company's
patents? Hardly the act of a "glorified stock promoter".


Now, if you are looking for a "glorified SELF-promoter", read Melissa Davis' SA bio. Doesn't get much thicker than
that.

Lobbing a few softballs at your interviewee makes it look like you're asking tough questions when you're not.

I do NOT understand how a doctor could be fired from his"day" job while writing articles and doing research on his
own personal time and I am deeply disappointed that a forged document was published,that was a major mistake. 
Some of the denials are not adding up or make sense.I admit that I am confused about how a person could be retired
and yet be a practicing physician,but have found his contributions to SA helpful in the past. 
I have never been bullish about AVXL and actually am very skeptical about the prospects of their AD drug ever being
approved. 
I believe a thorough investigation by SA about what in the world is actually going on here is warranted. 
What a mess:(

Thank you, Melissa, for an engaging expose.


There are a couple of things that get unavoidably attached to something like this situation.


It is clear that Kanak Kanti De falsified his credentials as he displayed them - he changed the name of the degree
recipient to his own "fake" name, and changed the date on which the degree was conferred. That much is
indisputable. Further, it is apparently clear that no one by the name of Kanak Kanti De ever received a degree from
the University of Calcutta. KKD has, in essence and in fact, lied about his identity, and is announcing his use of a
pseudonym only to "protect" himself from discovery.


The claim that he is using a pen name, and is writing anonymously, is a difficult thing to prove, since it places the
onus of proof on Seeking Alpha. If KKD is, in fact, an anonymous author, SA could not reveal his real name to the
general public without undercutting their policy of supporting contributor anonymity - and their policy has been
supported in court, if I am not mistaken. However, SA would know whether KKD was a pen-name, since they do
require anonymous authors to identify themselves to SA. That KKD has been banned from SA indicates that - indeed
- something fishy has occurred, and it is not a simple matter of KKD having written under a pseudonym (if, in fact, he
was).

KKD can say just about anything he wants about SA and there is little SA can do about it as long as KKD does not
attribute wrong-doing to SA.


There is a saying: "oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive."


Once you lie, your credibility is totally shot. Anyone who would believe anything said by a person who has lied risks
being victimized by further lies. Of course KKD can disavow having received payoffs - we already "know" that he is a
liar, so disavowing any wrong-doing would be expected. One may not have any direct means of establishing whatever
may be the "truth," but that is irrelevant - what is relevant is that KKD is a proven liar, so he is not acceptable as a
source of any claim to veracity.


Once a liar, always a liar ... without independent verification.


As for AVXL, its status has been brought to question. They have been the beneficiary of the acclaims of a - confessed
- liar. This does not mean that AVXL is guilty of any wrongdoing. That would require independent verification.
However, since a substantial weight behind their claims comes from an admitted liar, it is incumbent upon AVXL to be
fully forthcoming with all relevant and appropriate material to back up any claims they may have made about their
research. Whatever KKD may have lied about can be determined by qualified researchers who look at and critically
assess the research AVXL has done.


Melissa has promised to update her findings as she digs deeper.


KKD is, for all intents and purposes, fully discredited as a source of information.


AVXL now must essentially "put up or shut up" with respect to its research. I would avoid buying into the company
until its research has been thoroughly documented and critiqued. If I held shares (I don't), I might hold onto them, but

Joseph -


To claim AVXL has been a beneficiary of Dr. De's "acclaims", you must also acknowledge AVXL has been hurt
by Melissa Davis' innuendo-laced articles, no? By the way, Dr. De has not always been complimentary if you
read his AVXL articles, raising concerns about patent protection, and he clearly stated that he sold to get his
initial investment back. What do you suspect the motivation of Melissa Davis is to write her two AVXL articles?
Investigative stock reporting?


You state Dr. De has provided a "substantial weight" behind the company's claims. What company claims are
you referring to? Trial results are trial results. They are what they are, the merits of which are open to debate
which they certainly have been debated on SA and elsewhere. The company owes no response on the
matter.

SA would need to clarify exactly why Dr. De was dropped as a contributor, but I don't believe there's anything
"fishy" about it. I believe Dr. De was banned from SA as a contributor because he falsified his real identity
information which SA requires, and supposedly verifies, for contributors. He can remain a user on SA since
there is no such verification performed for non-contributors.


08 Jan 2016, 04:17 PM


Joseph P. Porter, Contributor
James, you explicitly state why anything KKD says cannot be believed - HE FALSIFIED HIS IDENTITY TO
S.A.!!


There is a limited amount that SA can do to confirm someone's identity, and it is a very simple matter to
create an "identity" that would satisfy most attempts at confirmation. (How much information do you have to
give to charge something at Amazon? A credit card, an email address and a mailing address. That's all. It's
also not much.)


If Davis' article is erroneous, it would be a simple matter to show where she is wrong. If the company is
concerned about their sterling reputation they could easily refute her accusations by simply providing all
relevant information. If she is being libelous, certainly the company could seek relief. That they have not yet
done either raises some interesting questions.


Most importantly, it is possible to show that KKD has explicitly and admittedly lied. I have yet to see anything
about Davis' version of the facts being proved to be - in fact - erroneous. Her critics at most are upset that she
has identified KKD as possibly being a fraud, and AVXL as having serious issues. That's too bad ... if KKD's
readers like that he is a liar, and still respect him, that speaks more to their personality than to Davis'; if
investors are willing to give money to AVXL despite the questions Davis raises, that's their business.


Why would investors raise a stink about Davis's assertions and observations, but refrain from expecting that
AVXL to show that it is above board and a legitimate medical research company?

You don't have to give any identification to SA...at all. Haven't you seen the numerous Anonymous articles?


And parallel to that, how many articles are written under pen names? Many. So he invented a biography and
attached a diploma to go with that.


The issue is what, exactly? Deception? Because being anonymous is so truthful?


08 Jan 2016, 07:35 PM


Joseph P. Porter, Contributor
Reigns -


SA does allow contributors to publish anonymously, but they are required to divulge their real identity to SA,
which does check them out, and requires some valid reason for maintaining anonymity.

By the way, I have gone on the record with SA (and other contributors, much to their chagrin) as opposing
anonymous authorship. Some people do believe that they have a legitimate reason for staying anonymous,
but I am who I say I am.

I have done my DD and have no concerns regarding the legitimacy of the company. It is surely a speculative
investment, as are any biotech companies with no revenues.


I'll ask again: 
- What do you suspect the motivation of Melissa Davis is to write her two AVXL articles? She claims no
position. 
- You state Dr. De has provided a "substantial weight" behind the company's claims. What specific company
claims are you referring to?

You do realize they take some years to complete? Pretty smug post concerning Anavex. Keep trying.

Just One Lab Nerd, Contributor
Joseph - there are legitimate reasons to want to be anonymous here. But you are certainly entitled to your
opinion to the contrary. It is a legitimate debate IMO.


Write here under a pseudonym myself as I actively work to keep my day job (which I am happy to discuss
offline - within reason - and which I have disclosed to SA) out of conflict with what I research for my own
personal investment interest.


But it is - indeed - a fine ethical line.


08 Jan 2016, 11:25 PM


Joseph P. Porter, Contributor
James,


I have no suspicions.


I do not know Davis, but she is, apparently, an investigative reporter by profession. This is the sort of thing IRs
do - and do very well, if they know what they're doing. She presents her case exceptionally well, draws her
lines clearly, substantiates everything and avoids making unwarranted assertions. I admire her presentation.

For people of her profession, the job is its own "reward." She reveals the truth (or what she can establish of
it), and the only way to refute her is to provide absolute, factually verifiable, evidence. Accuracy is crucial to
her - any slip-ups and she's toast.


Talk about "suspicions" or implications about ulterior motives are diversions and accomplish nothing. One
either proves what she says is false, or one accepts it as true and moves on, or one ignores it and - if she is
correct - suffers the consequences of one's ignorance and poor judgment.


That's the ineluctable thing about facts: they are there, and no one can do a thing about them. People might
try to hide them or ignore them, but the truth is the truth, and facts are facts. De can say or do anything he
wants, but it has already been firmly established that he is a liar, and THAT taints anything and everything
he's ever said or claims to have done.


Questioning Davis' motives have nothing to do with the matter. If an investor wants to discount what she has
written, they have few alternatives: prove she is wrong!


She asserts that - essentially - the leaders of AVXL tend to be shady, odious, characters with strong ties to
past market misdeeds. Should be easy to establish whether she's right.


To me, finding out that the people who are running a company have a history with pump-and-dumps is a
major red flag, and would stop me from investing right there.


It would not be a concern with a company like Pfizer, but "Irving's Stem Sell Kancer Resurch Labertorees"
maybe needs a look-see.


Is the founder an established scientist? Yes?? Hokay! Is he a guy with a history of pump-and-dump? Whoa!


How many established researchers are on the board/C-suite? None? Hmmmmmm - I'll pass. About 1/3 to
1/2? Hokay! 
How many have been associated with questionable activities in the past? A number of them??? I think not.


How many research universities is it associated with? None? University of Phoenix? University of Ibi, Nigeria?
MMMmmmmmm. Johns Hopkins? Harvard Med.? University of Minnesota? Okay!!


Taking a look at it, Melissa Davis has done a lot of DD for investors. Either her work is disproved, or it
convinces me I don't want to invest in the company.

KKD has already explicitly stated that he has presented fraudulent documentation, that he has presented
qualifications as his own when they were not. Further, he claims that he signed on as an anonymous
contributor to SA when, apparently, he actually presented himself to SA as "Kanak Kanti De," an individual he
now claims not to be.

Agamemnus, Contributor
@Joseph P. Porter: I agree with your initial statement. I asked Anavex twice to fully release their individual
patient data so we can run our own analysis, with no reply. Anavex's unproven and proven promotion (see
their video Wide World of Stocks) has made them suspect, and they continue to release partial data over and
over. Anavex are masters at using "weasel words" in their PR. It is such an easy task to provide the raw data,
yet they don't do it.


It is simply not possible to defend Anavex, however much I would have wanted their drug to work.

This, along with the first piece, was absolutely terrific research. Bravo Melissa. The internet allows people to hide

about a medical degree. After all you have uncovered, I agree with your 99.9%. Hell, I'd call it 100% certain. It is a
shame that so many were fooled.

This entire article is simply a text book case of a Red Herring.


e.g., You're all chasing his personal information, rather than addressing and refuting his analysis.


He is right or wrong about the company here in question based definitively on the logic and content behind the
analysis--and has nothing to do with credentials.

Usually I agree that the bio does not matter, and the analysis stands or falls on its own, but in this case there

They of course do not change the content.


They change the value of the content depending on the egregiousness of the actions of the author, which
damage his credibility and the readers' view of his honesty, that surface after the publication of the content.
Unless all content is falsifiable, and contains just facts which can be verified to be false or true independently.
SA articles typically contain more than bare facts.

Varan,


Please explain how the "value of the content" is changed? I don't think it is.


If someone gives me a dollar, and says, "I also counterfeit money, but here is my analysis showing you that
the dollar I gave you is real," then how does that analysis go from good to bad, or bad to good based on the
person being an admitted counterfeiter?

Yes, but beliefs do not create truth. The analysis is what it is. It's either valid, or it is not.

The simply answer is that his analysis stands until refuted, regardless of anything else. Otherwise, we'll never
know if it is valid or not.


On the face value comment, that's exactly my point--you either take things prima facia, or you do the analysis.
If you don't do the analysis, you are spinning your wheels.

However, there have been refutations and counterarguments from a scientific side multiple times. It's not as

This person, KKD, is accurately representing his credentials as a doctor but is using a fake name, a name of
someone else who actually exists? Is this right? A name that's so extremely rare that someone can type it into a
Google search and find all types of interesting things attributed to that name. Then that certain someone who
uncovered it all can claim that she is an outstanding reporter and gain hundreds of followers in days because of this
"groundbreaking" 5 minutes of Google search "reporting".


Ok, I can understand if you're not going to take a Seeking Alpha profile seriously, you can call yourself as you wish.
But if you are trying to build a business and gain serious credibility in the serious world of investing, how stupid to do
you have to to use a name like "Kanak Kanti De" and claim it's your own? If you're going to fake a name, why not use
Bob Smith, or Amit Singh in this case? A name which is so common that no one will know what to attribute to whom
online.


I understand that people are saying "who cares, the Dr. has real credentials and the analysis is apt". I get that line of
reasoning. Except if someone is as foolish and gullible enough to use an obscure name to misrepresent themselves
to the Seeking Alpha editors and community and expect to not eventually get caught and have it blow up on them,
how good could their research possibly be? If one shows poor judgement in this case, is it not a risk he also might
show poor judgement in analyzing AVXL and other speculative biotech stocks?


09 Jan 2016, 02:39 AM


Chuck Hardesty
Read through most of the comments here but only skimmed the ad hominem attack on DR. De. Some overall
thoughts:


1) SA was originally an “investors helping other investors” site but has sought to monetize its subscriber base in other
ways in recent years. The main standard for articles is that the standard is a very low bar. Financial Institutions must
deal with compliance / regulatory (SEC FINRA…) issues associated with the release of security recommendations
that aren’t present on SA. Many of the Research analysts that I have known have a CFA designation, an MBA /
Doctorate and often deep industry experience (i.e. they previously worked in the energy field and now cover energy
stocks). Many Analysts are prevented from owning the stocks they cover. Here it is kind of the Wild West.


2) The range of posters on SA range from Financial industry professionals, Industry Experts, Portfolio Managers to
the opposite end of the spectrum. I often wonder how some of the articles get past the editors as some are just
wrong. For instance, I have seen articles panning certain securities based on EPS when the standard metric for that
industry is cash flow. Caveat Emptor.


3) I’d put Dr. De in the category of hobbyist investor. Even if he was a doctor, he wasn’t a clinical researcher and his
expertise was in a different field from AVXL. So even if his credentials are in fact what he states, you were not getting
professional level advise. He may be an astute investor and some of them are better at picking stocks / predicting the
future than so called experts.


4) If what Dr. De says is true regarding his current employer in India, then he violated his terms of employment with
his “day job”. Many firms have such rules in place in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest. This to me is more
disturbing than using a pseudonym.


In reality, the Dr. De / M. Davis brouhaha is more symptomatic of other underlying issues. SA is a good for folks who
have the ability and background to discriminate but I pity the average do-it-yourself Joe.

"...Caveat emptor..." says it all. I personally don't place a high premium on advanced degrees as there are a
variety of "institutions" out there with less than rigorous standards for the credential, essentially paper mills.


Those who bill themselves as "investigators" also seem to characterize themselves as short-term investors. If
they can get a large enough dog-pile on a stock they can make some money off of what they write.

That isn't fortunate for a patient with progressive AD or PD, or for his/her family members.


When people like you, this author, and others bash a stock for personal gain, you forget that behind a
company and a drug lies the hopes of millions of suffering people - in this case, AD/PD patients and their
families.


I once saw a patient, an old lady, dignified, intelligent, with a sense of humor - get destroyed by cancer. Her
dignity was gone when she couldn't get up from the bed to use the bathroom. She didn't smile for 3 months

You lie, and are an admitted liar. That automatically disqualifies you from saying anything meaningful without
documented proof.


As for AVXL, any drug that is at only phase I is as much as a decade away from being approved for use. I am
checking with the FDA to see what the status is of their drug candidates.


But, if I were to have cancer, I would want treatment today, not in 10 years. And I would want a drug from a
reputable company.

It is you that is the liar. AVXL is not in Phase 1. I suspect you are also jealous of Kanak's much larger
readership.

Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
Joseph Porter, I have been overwhelmed by words of support from 100s of my readers, who should have
been the worst affected by my "lie" of forging my own degree onto another name to protect my identity.


On the other hand, I have been attacked by dozens of contributors here, who have little reason to be directly
affected by my investment advice.


I have to agree to what the comment below says - this is sheer and shameless jealousy.


In 6 months, me, a completely unknown person, became the most popular marketplace author, with two
separate services, glowing reviews, a popular service.


You people, on the other hand, have achieved little except muckraking in all your years plying your trade here
on SeekingAlpha.


A similar response once happened with another popular contributor. I respect that contributor because he
knows what he is talking about. Yet other contributors hounded him and almost threw him out of SA.


But the point is moot. What is important here is that, whoever I am, I am knowledgeable, smart, honest with
my research, and therefore people find my work useful.

Nobody finds you useful, especially now that you try to discuss a company about which -and about biotech -
you know nothing.


Finally, in all this, we forget the basic truth about investing - going long is honorable, shorting a stock by
manipulating its price is dishonorable.

I guess sometimes one has to be completely naked in public in front of a million people and be shameless if
that is what is needed to save one's livelihood.


By the way, even leaving aside the self confessed forgery - which is a huge and unjustified oversight - the
tipranks page http://bit.ly/1RBg72d justifies neither the unmitigated temerity of the man nor the high praise
that many followers have for him and his analyses.


To say all this is not to be a moralist or to make a personal attack, but just to make a pragmatic judgment of
the value that he offers, which is obviously not much, as evidenced by the record and not by the testimonials
of the die-hard followers.

Kanak Kanti De, Contributor
That's one way to escape a direct question as to your biotech expertise.


My readers know I have the highest honor and integrity. When I write about Anavex, I question its CEO, its
scientific founder, its PI (the principal investigator), I do thorough DD and buy the stock myself before
recommending it.


You, on the other hand, are jealous of my success and therefore say nasty things to someone you do not
even know.


Indeed it is probably senseless for you to discuss biotech with me. You probably wouldn't understand much of
what I would be saying.

dwd -


Simple application of Kantian ethics informs one that KKD cannot be trusted - after all, he is an acknowledged
forger and liar, meaning that he advocates giving false information when it is to his advantage to do so. (His
own admission, there, so it's not a guess.)


By extension, any statement he makes on his own behalf, or on behalf of anyone with respect to whom he
might have an interest, can be reasonably suspected of being a falsehood.


But then, I should think someone with a background in philosophy (to the extent that they would brag about it
in their bio) would already be aware of that.


As for calling KKD a liar, he has himself admitted that he is. I am simply acknowledging his admission. It is he
who has degraded the discussion.

Joseph P. Porter, Contributor
I stand by my earlier statement that Anavex identifies its lead candidate as a phase I drug on its own website.
However, after further researching the drug, I note that it is claimed, in its fuller discussion, that the drug is in
Phase 2.


My bad for taking the website at its word.


I am digging deeper into the research record, however. Much of the company's work is performed by way of
computer simulation. There is good simulation software out there, but it does not constitute human trials.
Perhaps I will be able to present my findings in the near future.

"On the other hand, I have been attacked by dozens of contributors here, who have little reason to be directly
affected by my investment advice. 
I have to agree to what the comment below says - this is sheer and shameless jealousy."


Kanak, we all on SA have to deal with bashers or people who otherwise trying to demean our credibility.
When someone is caught in deceit as you have been, it makes the entire community look bad. Thankfully I
barely dabble in spec biotech so it hasn't impacted me that much, but your actions very likely negatively
impact similar research writers to yourself. They are simply trying to earn a living, and do so the right way.
That's not jealousy, that's justified anger.


Let's take a more serious and deadly example:


It's like a police officer caught for beating or killing an unarmed man belonging to a certain community. He
might have a decorated career, and might have helped many over his life. But what he did tarnishes people's
view of cops and the good cops who try to make inroads into these communities have their efforts wasted, or
may even be a victim of retaliation themselves. Those officers have every right to be angry over the first cop
who did the abuse. That anger is real and justified, not due to some jealousy of the cops successful career.


Contributors teaming up against you are merely trying to expunge and disassociate from the shamed outcast.
It may be a bit of bandwagon jumping, holier than thou attitude or schadenfreude too, but people are going to
do what they can to save their own credibility.

If you cannot tell scams from legit companies, you really should not be investing, and you certainly should not
be CHARGING people for your advice.


And yes, AVXL is an OBVIOUS scam.

definition. Legitimate companies do not pay for promotion. Ever. Period.

I am not the least bit jealous about your "achievements", nor ar other authors as far as I know. Most likely
none are fully income dependent on it either like you seem to do, measured by the huge amount of online
time you must have spent on it. It should be impossible to handle a normal day job next to it.


Furthermore your remarks regarding other respected authors in here, combined with your idiotic statements
about you being smart, but nevertheless trying to fraud your way out using a very dumb, unique and easy to
research "real identity" name (it shows the dd ability of your thousands of followers btw, not having
researched you even once), show your real character. I really do hope Seekingalpha management is
considering banning you altogether from the platform, as even mere comments of you are repulsive.

Pay no attention to the Junior High theatrics of the kid who has been caught. We have all seen this drama
before.


What are more astonishing are oh so confident assertions of the readers who continue to insist that the
articles be judged in complete isolation from the confessed fraud, and the author of this article be excoriated
for the exposure.


Amazing indeed.


Just a cautionary tale for the retail investors who get most of their information here on SA. The operating
hypothesis should be that most contributors have an axe to grind (fraudulent or not), and the decisions made
on the basis of these articles should be made with great caution and diligence.

Does anyone else find the title misleading? AVXL never rebounded after KKD'S articles in November!


After checking KKD's profile, they wrote 5 articles on AVXL in November (9th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 16th). After looking at
AVXL daily chart, I realized that the stock NEVER rebounded the day KKD's article was published nor the day after. In
fact AVXL stock price declined both the day of and the day after each one of KKD's articles.and now is BELOW the
close price of when KKD's first article in November was published.

To the contributor formerly known as Dr. Kanak Kanti De:


Let me begin by saying that God is with you in this trying time. Having gone through difficult passages in my own life, I
can fully appreciate some of the more painful feelings of loss and betrayal you're experiencing in these moments. I
know that for you, authoring on this site has been an important source of pride and accomplishment. It's true that your
rise in popularity over a short period of time is not only admirable, but and a reflection of your considerable skills.


Additionally, I found the manner in which Seeking Alpha has handled these allegations to be counter to its many
encouragements of contributors to be collegial one to the other. That's why when the first article was published, you'll
find only comments of protest from me. Not only that, I contacted the editors privately expressing my concerns -
especially as regards the one-sided nature of Melissa's first Anavex article which, like many other notorious short

pieces, has no semblance of balance that biotech editor Mike Taylor expressed a liking for upon his arrival here. I was
essentially given a "no comment" response.


I can also tell you that this isn't the first time that I've protested the activities of certain contributors on this platform. In
fact, I haven't submitted an article for publication recently because I'm considering, once again, leaving the platform. I
have tangible and lasting concerns that Seeking Alpha is being misused in one other way. Hedge fund
operator/contributors are being allowed to author content on micro-cap stocks while taking out large material positions
in those stocks. Not only that, they're working in concert with each other to reinforce each other's ideation by leaving
supportive comments on each other's articles. While this may not be unlawful, it's certainly manipulative and
unethical.


Having said all that, you've been exposed in this last article because you chose to respond to the first article with
deception. It's a deception that goes considerably beyond your false diploma. Your biographies here on Seeking
Alpha and elsewhere reveal profound inconsistencies regarding whether or not you're a retired or practicing
physician, whether you have a medical degree, degrees, or non-medical degrees all of which lead to the inevitable
conclusion that you're not who you say you are.


Being someone who is completely honest about who I am - a full-time bus driver, a part-time amateur blogger/investor
who happens to do an added layer of due diligence in the form of tarot card readings on stocks, I find deception to be
intolerable. Furthermore, while I don't think you're alone in pretending to be something you're not on this platform, as
a contributor accepting subscription fees, I think it's imperative that you fully disclose all relevant aspects of your life
and background in a manner that is above reproach.


I'm quite certain that I'm one of the most unique contributors on this platform, not only because I'm forthcoming about
who I am, but because I really don't care what others think of me. Quite frankly, while I do appreciate the affirmations
readers often give me, I don't encourage people who read my articles to do anything but think for themselves. In fact,
I don't like the word "follower" in that it connotes that I'm somehow their "leader" which I'm not.


As for being "jealous" of you, it's an inappropriate descriptor to convey your intended meaning. Envious is more to the
point. While I am envious of your non-U.S. citizenship in a country where your Seeking Alpha income likely made you
wealthy compared to your fellow countrymen, and envious of the time you have to devote to what has been a full-time
endeavor for you, while being nothing more than an avocation for me, I can assure you this isn't what prompted my
commentary here.


You were considered a "Premium Contributor" not because your work was superior to other contributors, and certainly
not based upon the merits of your picks http://bit.ly/1RBg72d which I felt were marginal at best, but because you
volunteered to be part of the Marketplace, an option any contributor can elect to exercise. This is yet another problem
I have with the platform. I not only find the insights that I give to readers on biotech stocks to be more useful, but my
record http://bit.ly/1Nwnzey stands as testimony to the value of my work on a comparative basis.


I do hope you weather the storm ahead as I wish no will on any human being. Drawing closer to the truth of your life,
and to the source of our joy and destiny, would help you immeasurably in that process.


Your brother,


Michael Webb

Michael Webb, what does tarot say about AVXL?


10 Jan 2016, 08:25 PM


Scrying Biotech, Contributor
shilpa,


I appreciate your inquiry and though I would like to accommodate your request a reading takes about 4 hours
to perform. Consequently, some time ago, I stopped doing them reflexively. That said, you can see many of
those online at my website http://bit.ly/1OlpcaJ and on YouTube http://bit.ly/1fpLDxY. That Acasti example is
notable because I predicted a decimation of the stock in the immediate aftermath of a positive Phase-2 trial
readout. The Sunshine Heart reading is notable because it preceded my awareness of slow trial enrollment in
their U.S. registration study which led to my short thesis addressing this issue on Seeking Alpha a month or
so later. Please notice the balance of my short-article on SSH that you can see here: http://seekingalpha.co....


I also want to emphasize that these readings for me are an experiment in truth and only an additional layer of
analysis that has helped me to look at an equity with greater clarity.

time bio contributor somewhere and make 10x his present salary doing it full-time? With computers,he would
not even need to leave his native country...just a question... 
I was a "follower" and enjoyed most of Dr.Whateverhisnameis's articles,but can no longer do so after the
unethical cover-up attempt and untruthful biographical background. Being anonymous and honest is one
thing,anonymous and untruthful another.Sad.

crichardt, I believe the author formerly known as KKD was likely working as a full-time blogger. 5 hours plus
on the dailey Premarket Biotech Digest suggests that this assertion is/was true.


11 Jan 2016, 08:21 PM


The Critical Investor, Marketplace Contributor
Why bother, he just lied about everything and apparently couldn't stand serious criticism which is a red flag in
itself as no analyst is always right (as KKD very frequently wasn't either considering his track record).

"Dr De" gives a new reason for maintaining his anonymity:


"While I stand by my opinions and research with my reputation as a provider of this service, I choose to remain

I do not want any harm to myself."

When you start off using false pretense and unethical behavior at the offset of a business endeavour ,it
doesn't matter how honest you are while in business,the business is still a fraud. 
I did enjoy reading Dr.Whateverhisnameis's articles,but I will absolutely not follow him anymore,let alone
follow to India or pay for a service built on fraudulent groundwork. 
However I wish Dr.Whateverhisnameis good luck,I hope he can straighten this out,or at least carry on in some
capacity being a doctor? and biotech writer somewhere in this wonderful wide world.

don't know. Are they hedge funds, some foreign based, on the back end of these articles? Are they made
privy to article content prior to publication? A "Seeking Alpha Pro Membership" ensures that they are where
Pro articles are concerned. That's a selling point - the 24-hour advance view. Become a member and you get
that. It's also true of Marketplace membership at least insofar as individual writers are concerned. Whether
this speculation extends beyond this advantage to collusion or surreptitious activities I don't know.


The fact that the person once know as KKD has become paranoid from having gone through this terrible
experience doesn't surprise me. And I've tried my best to empathize with his predicament. That said, KKD set
himself up for this attack. Had he remained silent following the publication of that first article, contacted an
attorney and filed suit instead of reinforcing his charade with more deception, he might be feeling differently
now. He also would likely be still be furnishing content for this site which I know was important to him.


The greater truth involved is that we'll never know what this unseen force is. Were I a man of wealth, and not
a struggling bus driver, I might devote resources to investigating these matters in the hope of uncovering
possible wrongdoing. Sadly, or perhaps even fortunately, I'm not.

Furthermore, I'm not prepared to go beyond articulating the musings of my imagination to make accusations
without proof. I can't and won't say as others do that Adam Feuerstein is a part of some secret biotech
shorting cabal because, for the most part, I don't believe it. I shared AF's skepticism regarding MannKind
Corp and don't believe anything he wrote was necessarily designed to damage the stock. One thing's for
certain, no one has offered proof of that. The same can be said of Northwest Bio. I share his perceptions that
management there is curiously unprofessional at the very least and, quite possibly, not acting in the best
interest of shareholders. I'm not sure DCVAX-L is as useless as he thinks it to be, but the Phase 2/3 trial is
such a mess that getting the compound approved for commercialization will be next to impossible even with
good results.


Also, isn't there a case to be made that those encouraging a long position in an equity that fails do as much
damage to investors as those who drive a stock's value down with a short article? How many investors now
wish they had given equal weight to the skeptical arguments of Looking For Diogenes on MannKind as they
did to George Rho's effusive praise?


Though I take solace in having written articles critical of stocks that I originally saw value in, even as I held
them, and my awareness had changed, I still feel terrible about my initial enthusiasm for Cyclacel
Pharmaceuticals, Regado Biosciences and, perhaps, even NovaBay. Many writers, however, continue to say
positive things about an equity even as they see the ship taking on water and near sinking. Is that as harmful?
I personally think it might be.


In the greater context of an individual's freedom to decide for themselves it probably isn't. Just as Melissa's
article isn't, per se, harmful to Anavex. But, nonetheless, blogging is powerful. Writer's invariably influence
their readers and, vis-à-vis, the market itself. Let's hope each of us is aware of this power and act responsibly
in its use.


So yes, I'm aware that Melissa has a connection to the Street. Many financial bloggers, and former financial
bloggers, and even editors of Seeking Alpha have their roots there. They probably have friends in the SEC as
well. Who knows? We can walk this all the way to the end of the pier and fall off if we choose to, but that
doesn't help us to become better retail investors, now does it?


Consequently, it's optimal for me, and for all of us I think, to try to focus on the things that we can control while
simultaneously giving up the rest to God. In the end, I satisfy myself in this unwavering truth: everyone will get
exactly what they deserve. Short-term profit is almost always the source of long-term pain. It's just not
immediately apparent while the chips are being stacked.

Scrying -


If one looks closely enough at any SA writer (even me), one finds connections throughout the financial-
blogging world (I wrote for The Motley Fool for a while, as did - and still do - many SA writers, and I still keep
in touch with some associates through facebook and LinkedIn). The only reason I don't write for anyone but
SA right now is because I just don't write that much - I average 1 article every 2 weeks.

A network of "casual" acquaintances can look like a conspiracy if one wants to work at it, but that doesn't
necessarily make it so. Unfortunately, we are driven to find causes for things that occur, and the more
"impressive" the event, the greater the need for an "impressive" cause. Humans are hard-wired to make
causal connections, and intellect and imagination play a great role in enabling us to see complex causes ...
even where they don't exist.


Taking everything at face value is a good start for finding causes, and using Occam's Razor to slough off
anything that isn't absolutely necessary as part of an explanation, is the best way to start.


Neither Davis nor KKD need to be the byproducts of sinister conspiracies - just victims of their own internal
drives to achieve whatever it is they believe they are doing. It shouldn't matter how they came to do what they
did - the facts of what they did speak for themselves.


And I agree - people typically get what they deserve. In the end. Although that end may take a while.

Scrying Biotech,


Why do you think "Dr De" has become paranoid? I don't see the reason for that. He seems very resilient in
setting up his website, describing his services, outlining a new identity, and coming up with a new reason why
he has to remain anonymous.


And could "Dr De" have sued SA? I'm guessing that a person may have to disclose his actual name to bring a
lawsuit, or at least the real identity would be revealed in court/deposition, and "Dr De" definitely doesn't want
to do that. Can a person sue under a fake identity?


Really like how you write.


Cheers

SB does tarot cards as a lark,layer of DD to see if their is any rhyme or reason to Wall Street...imo,he is
making some type of chart or graph of his trades,with or w/o the tarot cards being in favor and will come to a
totally unscientific conclusion of some kind and publish it in some type of article someday.I do not believe he
does it as his primary source of trade information,rather as a somewhat comical check of what happens to his
trades after readings. 
The other guy is a confessed fraud that has lost my support and readership. I wish him well,but if his new
service continues to be based on the same fraud,I am sorry for anyone who will continue to pay for it. 
I am so lucky to live in the greatest country in the world where I can make that free choice w/o worrying about
someone breaking down my door if they disagree with it.

crichardt13,


Though I've learned to avoid disparaging remarks from those who can't appreciate my honesty and have no
understanding of my process, I always appreciate the few individuals who come to my defense even if that
rests solely in my constitutionally protected right to do so. You sir, are a true patriot and I thank you.


I had not thought, prior to this time, to chart the performance of equities following readings and present the
results. It's an interesting idea that I'll give some thought to. And since most all of my readings with conviction
are on YouTube (conviction = consistent with logical assessment) that could easily be done.

Interestingly, in my most recent published thaumaturgical analysis, I suggested, prior to the release of briefing
documents, that Biomarin's Kyndrisa would be routed at adcomm; that the PDUFA date would be postponed;
that the stock would not trade down in December as Adam Feuerstein said it would; that Biomarin would
receive a CRL in Q1 2016; that management would move from calm, cool and collected to highly critical of
FDA; and that the stock would trade down in this quarter. Excepting management's disposition (which will
erode soon enough) all these things have come to pass.


Question to anyone reading: who does that? How can that be done?


Note, though I formed an investment thesis on Sarepta in part because of a Kyndrisa fail, I haven't done a
Thaumaturgical analysis of Sarepta. I don't know how that event will play out. Additionally, I won't affront my
guides by reading as a means of self-enrichment or to place a bet. I do it for informational purposes only.


I practice Tarot, and have for the past 30 years, as a form of meditation, personal enlightenment and
connection to Source. Utilizing this process to examine the value of biotech equities was done, as you say, on
a lark. Now, however, it is much more. It should also be noted that I've never taken a dime from anyone for a
reading though many have offered thousands. I might do so in the future, however, as the totality of my
analysis is second to none.


Thank you again for being you.

I can't wait for the results from the on going SEC investigation. I believe it will shed light on how stocks can be easily
pumped and dumped by paid promoters.

Well, here we are at about 1 1/2 mo after this article and most of its discussion comments were written. AVXL seems
to be hanging on by its fingernails as what seems like dozens of law firms have started or hope to start law suits
alleging stock price manipulation.

This article and all of its discussion aside, there has for at least for the two years or so I've checked in on AVXL
always been something that didn't seem entirely legitimate about this company. Largely, I think It had to do with the
company's all too frequent attempts to publish tiny or trivial press releases seemingly hoping to pump up the price.
Then an article for pay in Jan '16 appeared promoting AVXL pretty much confirmed my negative suspicions. Wish it
wasn't just pump and dump crap but at this point looks AVXL is just another addition to this growing pile.

I am more curious about those who have felt compelled to sound an alarm here. They are getting some kind of payoff
for doing so and I can't help but believe they are likely short on AVXL. Any downward movement helps their position.

Melissa? I hope you made a good amount of money off of this article. Again I like how Seeking alpha platform allows
bearish and bullish points of view, I think it's great. The problem? Too many with an agenda.


If you believe Anavex will fail, great then post data/results and analyze said results. Prove that the data is weak.
Instead articles like these are written but hold no merit to the science. Please explain this then?


"Caught in a no-win situation that could easily grow even worse, Anavex looks destined to lose most (if not all) of its
recent gains regardless of its next move."


That's what you posted. If the drug doesn't work then why did the trial done in New Zealand just report that patients
are able to perform activities again such as:


Play Sports 
Paint  
Family time


This isn't my words, this is coming straight from the trial patients themselves and news media.


http://bit.ly/1r8SLI6


Again I like authors that take the bearish side of the trade, but next time please provide biotech analysis of said data. I
think people should read Seeking Alpha and then base their investment decision on their own. As you can see it is
