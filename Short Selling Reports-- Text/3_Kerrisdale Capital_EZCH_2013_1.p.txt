EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) 
 Competitive Threats, Customer Defections and an Unsustainable Valuation 





We believe that shares of EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) are highly overvalued. EZCH shares 
currently trade at $23.97, implying an egregious 7.5x 2013E EV/Revenue and a 32.5x GAAP P/E, 
surprising multiples for a business that has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to grow. As we 
frequently see in mispriced businesses, a high-level sector story – in this case, the need for greater 
bandwidth on capacity constrained carrier networks – has steered investors into an overpriced stock 
with many idiosyncratic risks. We believe that investors are not properly assessing the competitive risks 
posed to EZchip’s business or the limits of the addressable market, especially in light of EZCH’s 
astronomical valuation.  
 
Before 2012, EZCH was fortunate enough to have little outside competition in high-speed network 
processors. But since the start of last year, two well-funded industry leaders have mounted attacks into 
EZchip’s core Network Processing Unit (NPU) business. To begin with, Marvell Technologies (MRVL) 
began to compete for NPU market share following their January 2012 acquisition of EZchip’s then-
largest competitor, Sweden-based Xelerated. Given EZCH’s reliance on Marvell as a conduit in the 
foundry relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), the new arrangement appears conflicted. The 
dynamics are akin to Coca-Cola (KO) relying on Pepsi (PEP) for the manufacturing of Coke syrup. 
 
But the most substantial competitive risk to EZCH, in our opinion, is the entry of Broadcom (BRCM) into 
the high-speed network processor market. Through its acquisition of NetLogic in 2011, high-end 
semiconductors have become a strategic priority for BRCM. In April 2012, Broadcom introduced a full-
duplex 100Gb (i.e. 200Gb/s) NPU, pitting EZchip’s upcoming NP-5 in direct competition with an industry 
leader. While EZchip touts its 200Gb/s headline figure for the NP-5, the chip is merely a full-duplex 
(two-way) 100Gb/s device, giving it the exact same bandwidth as Broadcom’s chip. Another critique of 
BRCM’s NPU is that it lacks an integrated “TCAM” (Ternary Content Addressable Memory). This 
argument overlooks the fact that Broadcom can add TCAM and other functionality as an expansion. But 
most troublingly for EZCH’s investors, Broadcom now produces each of the individual components of 
the line card (TCAM, NPU, multi-core processor, etc.), allowing them to write software that transcends 
across individual components. This might allow BRCM to optimize the efficiency of the various 
hardware inputs and constitute a strong selling point versus EZCH’s NP-5.  
 
But even if one believes that the BRCM component is somehow inferior, credible alternate vendors in 
the marketplace could drive down NPU pricing. This issue is overlooked by many analysts who instead 
rely on EZCH management for guidance. In their Q4 2012 presentation, EZCH tells investors that it 
expects a 40% increase in unit pricing between 2012 and 2016. Not only is this assumption inconsistent 
with the entry of Broadcom and Marvell, it's contradictory to the very nature of Moore’s Law, where 
more computational power is delivered at ever decreasing costs over time. NPU pricing is also limited 
by a constant threat of NPU replacement by in-house designs from the likes of Cisco, Huawei, ZTE, 
and other router manufacturers. Just over three years ago, Juniper decided to replace all of its EZCH 
chips with in-house designs on future router designs. EZCH shares fell 14% immediately after the 2009 
announcement. Huawei may have made a similar decision as they’ve delayed all EZCH orders as of Q4 
2012. Management speculates that Huawei is using an in-house solution for at least a portion of their 
NPU demand, but they admit to having almost no visibility into this key customer account (EZCH Q4 
2012 Call). A business that lacks pricing power should earn a commodity-like multiple, not the 
stratospheric valuation premium that EZCH currently boasts.

Foreseeing the threat in their core NPU market, EZCH has rushed to publically announce a shift 
towards the data center market. EZCH’s L4-L7 next-generation processor (“NPS”), if successful, won’t 
generate meaningful revenues until 2016+ (Sept 5th NPS Call). But that hasn’t stopped some investors 
from glowingly referring to the NPS as a ‘game changer.’ Unfortunately for the EZCH bulls, a privately-
held Intel spinout named Netronome already produces a 200Gb/s flow processor with L2-L7 
functionality that has won widespread industry praise. And as one of only a handful of outside partners 
with access to Intel’s semiconductor foundries, Netronome’s chips can be produced at the 22nm scale 
and below. Compare this to EZCH, whose next-generation NP-5 will only be produced at the 28nm 
scale with Taiwan Semiconductor. 
 
Lastly, we believe that Wall Street research analysts are twisting forward EPS, and by association, 
overstating their EZCH price targets. Through the use of a non-GAAP technique that excludes stock-
based compensation (“SBC”), we believe that the $1.13 2013E consensus EPS is inflated by about 
35%. Wall Street analysts have no logical grounding for excluding these costs. Given EZchip’s meager 
revenue stream in relation to its $690m market capitalization, its history of unfulfilled promises, the 
rapidly emerging competitive threats from Broadcom and Marvell, and EZCH’s technological 
disadvantages in the data center market, we believe that EZCH’s share price is poised for a sharp 
correction. Like many other technology hardware manufacturers dependent on a single customer for 
much of their revenue, EZCH’s stock is one design loss away from falling by as much as 45%.

I.  Summary of Red Flags  
 
We believe that EZchip is significantly overvalued for the following reasons: 
 


 Broadcom’s 200Gb/s Network Processor Should Pressure EZCH’s NP-5 Market 
Share and Price Point. EZCH has historically benefited from its cushy position as the 
leader in a duopoly market with Xelerated (now Marvell). But that dynamic changed 
drastically this year when Broadcom announced its entry into the market in mid-2012 via 
the BCM 88030 network processor. According to recent management comments, 
Broadcom expects to enter production and have customers in 2013, some of which 
could be poached from EZCH (BRCM 2012 Analyst Day). EZchip has told investors that 
“we believe that substantially all NP-4 customers will select the NP-5,” but that sounds 
more like wishful thinking than fact to us (EZCH Q4 2012 Call). While EZchip touts its 
200Gb/s headline figure for the NP-5, the chip is actually a full-duplex (two-way) 
100Gb/s device. This is precisely the same speed as Broadcom’s BCM 88030, a full-
duplex 100Gb/s processor. The confusing nomenclature may be misleading some 
investors to brush off the risks from Broadcom. Broadcom began a push into more 
complex processors in late 2011 with its acquisition of NetLogic. This has allowed 
Broadcom to design all of the individual components of the router line card (NPU, TCAM, 
multi-core processor, etc.). Broadcom’s CEO explained the benefits of this integrated 
supplier approach, saying: “We're able to make the products work better together, so we 
can optimize our switches to work with the network processors…it's our goal to design 
[products] as a platform to bring significant advantage to customers who purchase all of 
them together” (BRCM Q2 2012 Call). A single publicly announced customer loss to 
BRCM could spell disaster for EZCH shares. 
 


 Marvell Technologies, the Sole Supplier for EZCH’s NP-4 and NP-5, has Recently 
Become a Direct Competitor. In order to guarantee manufacturing capacity, Cisco 
appears to have demanded that EZCH use a larger company as a conduit between itself 
and EZCH’s semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Marvell, as 
“the sole supplier of our NP-4 and NP-5” (EZCH’s 2011 20-F), serves this function by 
employing its buying power to move its orders to the front of the queue. But the 
arrangement has grown increasingly conflicted following Marvell’s purchase of 
Xelerated, a small NPU startup, in January 2012. Xelerated had launched a 50Gb/s full-
duplex processor (100Gb/s) in August 2010 and was EZchip’s chief competitor at the 
time. We would expect Marvell to support the Xelerated team with much-needed capital 
to potentially push forward a next-generation chip to compete with EZCH’s NP-5.  





 EZchip’s NPS Chip Appears Fundamentally Handicapped Versus the Privately-
Held Netronome. Investors who refer to the NPS chip as a ‘game-changer’ are severely 
underestimating Netronome, a privately-held Intel spinout run by an accomplished 
Caltech graduate. Netronome recently made its presence known by directly challenging 
EZCH at a Linley Tech Conference. A review of the conference illustrates the similarities 
between the two companies, stating that the NPS “will take EZchip beyond its 
switch/router roots and into a wider venue that looks more like, well, like Netronome's 
business”. Netronome had previously introduced its 200Gb/s L2-L7 chip (called NFP-
6xxx) back in June 2012. And notably, as only one of a handful of Intel fabrication 
customers (others include Archronix and Tabula), Netronome should hold a long-term 
technological advantage versus EZchip. Intel’s best-in-class foundry has allowed

Netronome to create its NFP-6xxx at the 22nm scale, and future designs may be made 
on Intel’s 14nm scale. On the other hand, EZCH’s foundry provider, Taiwan 
Semiconductor, will fabricate the supposedly next-generation NP-5 at only a 28nm scale. 
A smaller manufacturing scale can increase energy efficiency and add to bandwidth 
capacity. As a private company, Netronome has been under-covered by equity analysts 
and we believe that EZCH investors are underestimating the risks imposed by this 
formidable competitor. The significance of the Intel foundry relationship may be 
confirmed as Cisco is rumored to be near announcing a billion dollar foundry deal with 
Intel to produce its own silicon chips. If this were the case, it would prove that Cisco 
clearly values Intel’s 22nm-scale technology. 





 Consensus EPS Estimates use Non-GAAP Measures that Inflate EPS (and Analyst 
Price Targets) by Roughly 35%. To boost their lackluster earnings figures, EZCH 
management guides investors using non-GAAP reporting figures that exclude stock-
based compensation (“SBC”). While this tactic is frequently used by technology 
companies, disciplined investors and analysts shouldn’t be fooled. Since public 
shareholders of EZCH stock didn’t receive their stock for free, then how can stock be 
gifted to EZchip’s employees without expense? Of the research reports we’ve read, Felt 
& Company, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, Brean Capital, and Oppenheimer all follow 
management’s non-GAAP EPS to build their price targets. EZchip gifted its employees 
about $11m in stock options over the last twelve months (EZCH 20F, 6K), translating to 
a decrease in EZCH’s non-GAAP EPS by about $0.39/share. This calculation has a very 
material impact on the price targets for a company which earns as little as EZchip does. 
For example, Felt & Co reaches a strong buy conclusion and a $35 target price by using 
a 22.5x P/E multiple on 2014 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 (February 14


th
 report). If we 


removed $0.39 of stock-based comp expense from Felt’s figures, their same valuation 
multiple yields a target price of only $26. Because of this widely perpetuated 
miscalculation, it is a mistake for the investor community to be guided by forward 
multiples on Yahoo Finance or other sites that rely on these inflated non-GAAP EPS 
figures. 
 


 Given What’s Been Discussed Above, We Believe that Shares are Overvalued by 
as Much as 45%. Based on the forthcoming competitive risks from Broadcom and 
Marvell, EZCH’s extensive track record of overstating growth potential, a relative lack of 
pricing power, and a weak backdrop in carrier spending, we believe that EZCH stock 
should now trade at a valuation multiple more in line with the broader semiconductor 
market. Peers demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth, unlike EZCH, generally 
trade between 10 and 15x 2013 P/E. After deducting our estimated SBC of $0.39/share 
from the Street’s non-GAAP EPS estimate of $1.13, we valued EZCH based on our 
adjusted 2013 EPS estimate of $0.74. With the addition of 25% of EZCH's cash balance, 
a generous 2013 P/E multiple range of 15 – 20x leads to a valuation range of $12.50 - 
$16, or a 32% - 48% discount to the current trading price. We also don’t believe that 
management’s 3x revenue target by 2016 is realistic, and instead have used Gartner 
industry projections and our own assumptions to reach a ‘bull-case’ 2016 revenue target 
of $85m. At a 35% - 40% EBITDA margin and a 6x - 8x multiple, this translates into a 
price target of $14 - $17, still a 29% - 43% discount to the current price.

II. Company Overview 
 
EZchip designs high-speed Ethernet Network Processors (“NPUs”) used by the telecom 
industry to increase bandwidth in the aging ethernet networks used for phone, data, and voice 
services. EZchip’s processors are used in high-speed network routers sold by Cisco, ZTE, 
Juniper Network, and other hardware businesses that then sell routers directly to businesses 
like AT&T and Verizon. The Carrier Ethernet network can be divided into three domains: i) the 
Access network that connects individual traffic flows (“the last mile”); ii) the Edge (or “Metro”) 
network that aggregates traffic within an urban area, and finally; iii) the Core network, which 
routes and processes all data requests to the proper channels. Access NPUs tend to have lower 
bandwidth requirements (1Gb/s-20Gb/s) than Edge NPUs (20Gb/s+). EZCH’s routers are 
designed for the “Edge” of the network. Edge routers aggregate the incoming data streams from 
individual access routers and direct them to the Core. As one moves closer to the Core, router 
processing needs become increasingly complex. Because of this, better-capitalized router 
manufacturers such as Cisco and Juniper produce their Core routers using in-house NPUs that 
have computing power beyond that of EZCH’s chips. These in-house Core chips are commonly 
called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). In order to save costs and overhead, 
some of these router companies outsource the simpler Access and Edge chip design to smaller 
companies like EZchip. Competitors in the high-speed NPU market include Marvell 
Technologies, Broadcom, and in-house chip design teams that decide against sourcing NPUs 
from an outside provider.  
 
As a fabless semiconductor business, EZCH is reliant on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
to manufacture its finished processors. TSM, which produces $17bn in annual revenue, 
probably views EZCH ($55m 2012 revenue) as a footnote on its customer list. Because of this, 
Cisco uses Marvell Technologies (a much larger TSM customer) as a conduit for its EZCH 
orders to ensure that its outsourced chips get priority at TSM’s foundries (EZCH 2011 20-F).

EZchip currently boasts an enviable valuation of 9.6x 2012A revenue, 37.8x 2012A EBITDA, 
and 44.4x 2012 GAAP P/E. At valuation multiples as high as these, it’s not surprising that many 
cling to the belief that EZchip’s best days are yet to come. As with many overvalued stocks that 
we’ve encountered, management directs investor attention to an outsized addressable market 
opportunity in order to distract investors from disappointments in its underlying business. The 
EZCH bull case relies on its ability to achieve dominant market share of its 2016 “Total 
Serviceable Market” of $800m, consisting of a $400m NPU opportunity and a $400m data 
center opportunity (Q4 2012 investor presentation). Management further encourages the 
investor frenzy by leading investors to believe that revenue will grow 2.8x-3.7x by 2016 from the 
2012 figure of $54.7m. This forecast was recently reduced from a revenue multiplier of 4x-5x, as 
had been used in the Q3 2012 investor presentation. Considering that EZCH’s management 
has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, we caution investors against any of this 
forward guidance at face value. Those who believed management’s promises of growth have 
been sorely disappointed time and time again. EZCH’s revenue shrank from $63.5m in 2011 to 
$54.7m in 2012, hardly the type of momentum one would expect from a business with an almost 
10x 2012A revenue multiple.

III. Looming Competitive Threats  


Industry Leaders are Encroaching on EZCH’s Core Market 


EZchip has historically been fortunate enough to have just one significant competitor in high-
speed NPUs, the privately-funded Xelerated. But last year, the competitive landscape drastically 
changed. To begin with, Marvell Technologies acquired the Swedish-based Xelerated on 
January 4


th
, 2012. At the time, Xelerated was the only company producing a 100Gb/s NPU 


aside from EZchip. Marvell will now compete in the 100Gb/s NPU segment directly with EZchip 
while remaining EZCH’s only manufacturing partner. This newly antagonistic relationship with 
Marvell leaves EZCH in a precarious situation since the majority of EZCH’s foundry orders at 
Taiwan Semiconductor are run through Marvell. Should the Edge processor market eventually 
become large enough, Marvell may decide its share of NPU revenues are more important than 
the royalties it collects serving as a manufacturing conduit for EZCH.

In addition to Marvell, we believe the biggest near-term competitive threat to EZchip is 
Broadcom. Broadcom began to vastly expand its product portfolio in September 2011 when it 
acquired the multi-core and high-performance processor maker NetLogic for $3.7bn. This 
marked the start of Broadcom’s foray into NPU design using the engineering talent brought in 
from NetLogic. By providing all components in a network line card (NPU, multi-core processor, 
TCAM, etc.), Broadcom intends to bundle its solutions, which could eliminate the need for 
individual component providers like EZchip. Broadcom’s newly expanded product platform is 
shown below: 
 


 
Source: BRCM December 6

, 2012 Analyst Day. 


 
Broadcom officially announced the BCM 88030 high-speed network processor, a full-duplex 
100Gb/s (effectively 200Gb/s), in April 2012. EZCH’s share price fell 9% on the announcement, 
but little has been made of the announcement since. Broadcom, on the other hand, appears 
extremely excited about its new market opportunity. At its 2012 analyst day on December 6


th
, 


Broadcom gave an update on the progress it has made: 
 


“Another example of a product that expands our [addressable market] is 100 gig network 
processor that we that we introduced earlier this year. And by the way, you should be 
seeing all these products in production, right, with customers in 2013. So again, this is a 
product that's -- it that 100 gigabits of full duplex processing. Our nearest competitor's 
product about 40 gig, if you look at it as an apples-to-apples comparison, and again, this 
is a product that very well-positioned for further penetration into the traditional network 
processor market in EDGE routers primarily, as well as in some core router applications, 
as well as packet transport applications.”

th
, 2012 Analyst Day. 


 
EZCH has only recently begun to acknowledge the competitive threat posed by Broadcom, and 
even now does so ever so slightly. After adopting a very defensive tone when asked about the 
competition on its Q4 2012 earnings call, EZchip brushed off the concern by stating that, “we 
don’t see much of them [BRCM and Marvell] in edge routers” (EZCH Q4 2012 Call). Just three 
months before, on the Q3 2012 earnings call, EZCH’s CEO stated that, “We said all along that 
we feel that with NP-4 and NP-5 we kind of securing our market and our customers and we 
don’t feel that we really have competition there…We feel that with NP-5, the chances for us to 
secure all the 5 large customers are pretty high” (EZCH Q3 2012 Call). Since management’s 
comments are generally taken as absolute truth by EZCH analysts, the Street is not currently 
modeling for the pricing and market share effects of a Broadcom entry. We believe that this is a 
gross mistake and will lead to EZCH (once again) missing its projections in the near future. 
 


 
Further Competition Could Emerge if Market Opportunity Grows 
 
Besides the head-to-head competition from Marvell and Broadcom, there are at least half a 
dozen general purpose processor companies that have the potential to expand into high-speed 
NPUs. These potentially incremental competitors include LSI (LSI) and PMC-Sierra (PMCS), 
both of which already produce low-speed NPUs. For instance, PMC-Sierra is already the #1 
manufacturer of lower-speed mobile backhaul network processors. Should the high-speed 
market grow in size, these companies would should the resources and in-house capability to 
quickly enter EZCH’s market.

In-house Chip Design Concerns: The Juniper and Huawei Case Studies 
 
While outside competitive threats are hardly discussed by management, EZchip management 
acknowledges the potential for router customers to bring NPU design in-house, previously 
mentioning that “the competition comes from in-house, from our customers that has always 
been our concern in edge routing and that continues to be our concern” (EZCH Q3 Call). 
Juniper Networks, once EZCH’s largest customer, was the first major vendor to abandon EZchip 
in 2009. Juniper first began selling routers embedded with the NP-2 processor in 2007 and 
accounted for as much as 55% of EZCH revenue in 2008. But then, in an attempt to compete 
more effectively with Cisco, Juniper announced a manufacturing contract with IBM that allowed 
it to bring NPU chip design in-house. This October 29, 2009 announcement was a major body 
blow to EZchip’s long-term business viability as it removed a top-tier router vendor from the 
customer list. Yet somehow, EZCH shares only fell 7% from $12.84 to $11.97 on the date of the 
announcement. Normally, when a company loses its largest customer, the market reaction is 
much more negative. But EZCH’s investors seem to repeatedly put a mystical faith in the future 
of this business.  
 
Investors were once again blindsided on February 13, 2013 when EZchip announced on its Q4 
2012 call that Huawei had not yet placed production orders, leading management to believe that 
Huawei was substituting in-house designs for EZCH chips. Management’s conclusion that 
Huawei is developing an in-house solution is “currently a mere speculation” (EZCH Q4 2012 
Call) since EZCH apparently doesn’t maintain an open dialogue with Huawei. While EZchip 
remains optimistic that they’ll only be replaced in the “lower end,” management’s lack of insight 
into a key customer account betrays a much broader concern, the lack of intimacy between 
EZchip and its key customers. We saw this dynamic at work in our previous work on MLNX. If a 
business with only a handful of customers cannot maintain a clear grasp of the strategic 
intentions of a major customer, it’s equally unlikely to correctly predict its revenue stream years 
into the future. 
 
The EZchip congregation may be slowly losing its faith as EZCH shares fell over 20% after the 
Q4 2012 call. The Juniper and Huawei examples remind us that EZCH’s designs are perpetually

at risk of replacement. Going forward, investors should remember that Cisco is unlikely to ever 
pay EZchip hundreds of millions of dollars for something it might be able to do itself. 
 


EZCH’s Naivety to Competitive Risks is Consistent with a History of 
Disappointing Results 
 


Bullish research reports and investor write-ups on EZCH typically argue that EZCH’s premium 
valuation is warranted by a steady revenue stream from past and future design wins. Because 
EZCH’s customers, such as Cisco and ZTE, generally stick with a single NPU manufacturer for 
each router model, once a design is won it tends to be sticky for the lifetime of that product 
cycle. But empirical evidence suggests that EZCH’s quarterly revenue is actually highly volatile, 
quite the opposite of a steady income stream. This is the result of EZCH’s over-reliance on 
telecom carrier expenditures, which is an extraordinarily difficult market to forecast.

With such unpredictable end-market demand, it would be hard for any company to have good 
visibility on near-term results. But this hasn’t stopped EZCH from bullishly proselytizing to its 
investors. As the inconsistency between the quotes below and EZCH’s underlying financial 
results shows, EZCH’s growth promises have proved false time and time again.

“We expect our main growth drivers for 2012 will be the ramp up of our new NP-4 customers 
and the recovery in… carriers' capital expenditure. We believe this will result in year-over-year 
growth in 2012.” – Q1 2012 Earnings Call 
 
Given management’s track record of over-promising and under-delivering, we believe that 
investors should be highly skeptical of EZCH’s commentary going forward.  
 





IV. Tepid End-Market Demand has Forced Risky Change in 
Strategy 


December Gartner Report Lowered Expectations for the Carrier Capex Market 


 
Gartner, the well-regarded research institution, released a Q4 2012 update to its Carrier 
Network forecasts that portends a bleak future for traditional wireline spending. Gartner now 
predicts that network infrastructure spending will decline 6.6% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to 
“weaker demand and aggressive price competition.” Making matters worse for EZCH, global 
telecom players such as AT&T, Verizon, China Telecom, and Vodafone are increasingly 
focused on mobile networks and backhaul as opposed to wireline installations. While EZCH 
does sell into the wireless market, it appears from the exchange below that mobile backhaul 
accounts for less than 10% of EZCH’s business.  
 
<Q - Paul McWilliams>: Okay. End market-wise, what percentage of your NP sales are driven 
by carrier, is that 100%, 90%? 
<A - Dror Israel>: About 90%. 
<Q - Paul McWilliams>: Okay. With the balance coming from enterprise? 
<A - Dror Israel>: Not only enterprise, but let's say more access, kind of boxes, and wireless 
backhaul and these kind of... 
<A - Eli Fruchter>: But it's also, Paul, it's also some enterprise. It's things like load balancing, 
which we see, some security boxes where our chips will be used as accelerators for [ph] Intel 
CPUs (45:23) or multi-cores. And so it's really very, very many different applications I would say 
that will make the remaining 10%. 
Source: EZCH Q2 2012 Call 
 
If the comments on mobile backhaul indicate that a substantial portion of EZCH’s business is 
driven by core wireline routing, then recent spending patterns from AT&T and Verizon should be 
concerning. Wireline capex as a percentage of total spending has collapsed from around 60% in 
2009 to around 40% today. EZCH attributes much of its recent weakness to this trend: “There is 
short-term problem…it depends on…the carrier CapEx and service providers spending 
especially wireline… and this is the main reason for the decline in expected revenues” (EZCH 
Q2 2012 Call).

Poor Prospects in Carrier Ethernet have forced a Shift to the Data Center 
 
The telecom infrastructure market is not nearly as exciting as it once was. Between these end-
market headwinds and EZCH’s inability to drive NPU growth, it’s quickly apparent why investors 
are growing wary of the EZCH story. These fears first materialized on EZCH’s Q2 2012 call 
when management announced Q3 revenue guidance of $8m-10m, a ~40% sequential decline 
from the previous quarter. Spooked investors sent EZCH shares down 25% after the call. EZCH 
must have felt compelled to reassure these jittery investors as it rushed to pre-announce plans 
for a research-stage product just three weeks after the Q2 call. On August 28


th
, EZchip pre-


announced that it was going to unveil a new product line on September 5
th
. By the time 


September 5
th
 finally arrived, EZCH shares had already recovered more than half of their 


original loss. EZchip even hosted an analyst call to announce its new project, dubbed the “NPS” 
(Network Processor for Smart Networks). We believe that this early announcement was a tacit 
admission that EZchip foresees continued market weakness and mounting competitive 
pressures in Carrier Ethernet.  
 
EZchip “does not have customer commitments” for the NPS but said that it expects to “see 
design wins for the NPS in the first half of next year [2013]” while conceding that “it’s too early to 
talk about target numbers” (EZCH Sept 5


th
 NPS Call). This project has caused a ramp in R&D 


spending, up from $4.1m in Q3 2011 to $5.2m in Q3 2012 and Q4 2012. Since EZCH has said 
that the NPS won’t meaningfully contribute to revenue until 2016, this growing R&D expense on 
an unproven technology should be a headwind on earnings for years to come.  





 
EZchip’s NPS Technology is Fundamentally Disadvantaged 
 
Whereas EZchip’s series of NP processors are optimized for carrier networks, the NPS will be 
designed for the data centers. EZchip claims that the advanced ‘L2-L7’ architecture adds $400m 
to EZCH’s total serviceable market, doubling its overall market opportunity by 2016. Because

this opportunity stretches so far into the future and includes a myriad of unknowns, we would 
warn investors against even considering adding it into EZCH’s valuation until definitive customer 
agreements assigned.  But since the stock market loves a good story, we’ll address our 
immediate concerns.  
 
The most direct potential competitor comes in the form of an underfollowed, privately-owned 
business named Netronome. Netronome is a spinout from Intel that focuses solely on high-end 
network processors. Netronome has already designed a 200Gb/s chip (NFP-6xxx) for the data 
center, putting it well ahead of EZCH’s NPS. The Linley Group also believes that the flexibility of 
the chip makes it a competitor to EZchip’s NP-5 for the next-generation network processing 
market. The Intel spinout is run by Howard Bubb, a Caltech-educated electrical engineer who 
previously held senior positions at Intel, and the venture is funded by blue-chip investors such 
as Tudor, Top Technology Ventures, and DFJ Esprit. Within the next year or so, we think that 
Netronome could announce a next-generation chip that matches the theoretical bandwidth of 
EZCH’s NPS chip, putting pressure on EZCH’s share price. Beside the potential trouble for 
EZCH’s NPS chip, Netronome also aspires to move into EZchip’s core L2-L3 Carrier Ethernet 
market. The Chief Router Architect at ZTE, a major EZCH customer, recently praised 
Netronome’s NFP chip:  
 


“Netronome has once again delivered on its strengths; flow-aware processing and large 
scale integration of programmable resources. The flexible, ultra high speed interfaces, 
processing cores and network specific hardware accelerators provided by NFP-6xxx 
family of products allow it to be positioned in both the line cards as well as service cards 
of next generation routers. NFP-6xxx along with prepackaged networking software 
closely aligns with our vision for our router family of products” - Ye Zhining, Chief 
Architect Router Products, ZTE. 


 
Aside from these glowing reviews, we believe that Netronome holds an important manufacturing 
edge over EZchip. Netronome’s NFP-6xxx chips are built by Intel using a 22-nanometer 
manufacturing scale. EZchip, on the other hand, is reliant on a TSM foundry that is consistently 
a generation behind Intel. On the September 5


th
 NPS call, EZCH said it plans to “use 28 


nanometer for [the NPS]” (EZCH Sept 5
th
 NPS Call). EZCH’s NP-4 currently engages TSM’s 


55nm scale while the NP-5 will also employ TSM’s 28nm manufacturing process. Smaller 
manufacturing architecture can translate directly into better speed, power use, and efficiency 
metrics. But by the time of EZchip’s potential NPS release, Intel’s fabrication facilities will have 
already moved to 14nm and beyond.

Beyond the direct threat from Netronome, the data center market is already occupied by heavy 
hitters such as Cavium (CAVM) (see Cavium Octeon III Sizzles at 100Gbps), PMC-Sierra, and 
LSI. These well-capitalized competitors will most certainly fight to protect their share of the L4-
L7 chip market and will move into higher-speed chips should market demand warrant.  





V.  Unsustainable Valuation by Any Measure 
 
The semiconductor industry, as a group, tends to trade at a relatively modest valuation multiple 
given the industry’s reliance on product cycles and the commoditization of many parts of the 
business. Competitive advantages disappear overnight and customers can leave within a single 
product cycle. But when a misunderstood company becomes the flavor-of-the-month, valuation 
metrics can quickly get out of hand.  Such has been the case for EZchip’s 40x+ 2012 P/E 
multiple.

(1) EZCH EPS adjusted to include $0.39/share of annual stock-based comp expense


     CAVM 2013E P/E is 100x+ after including $0.76/share of SBC  
 
Given the uncertainty of EZCH’s growth, the company’s tendency to over-exaggerate product 
ramps, the loss of a key customer account to in-house designs, and the entry of Broadcom and 
Marvell into the NPU space, we’d argue that EZCH no longer deserves a premium valuation to 
the industry. We also believe that EZCH’s mispricing exists because most of the Street’s 
analysts exclude EZCH’s mounting stock-based compensation (“SBC”) expense from EPS, 
thereby inflating earnings by 30%+. Over the last twelve months, EZCH spent $11.2m on stock 
grants (or $0.39/diluted share). While this might be a minor footnote for a largecap organization, 
it’s a very major line item for EZCH. By excluding SBC, the analysts are effectively reducing 
EZCH operating expenses by the same amount, leading to embellished valuation multiples. 
After netting out this $0.39/share of SBC to analysts’ 2013E EPS estimates, we reach a GAAP 
earnings estimate of $0.74/share. With the addition of 25% of EZCH’s cash balance, an above 
average industry P/E multiple of 15x produces an $12.50 price target and a generous 20x P/E 
would led to a $16 price target, or a 32% - 48% discount to the current trading price.  
 
EZCH bulls might reject this valuation argument by instead citing management’s target of 3x 
revenue growth between 2012 and 2016. To construct its target, EZCH cites April 2012 
research from Infonetics and its own internal sources. Gartner, a very well-regarded technology 
research firm, published more recent thoughts on the market in December 2012, predicting that 
the Edge Router and Switch market will grow by only 3.6% in 2013 and 11.3% in 2014. While 
this might be exciting if EZCH were trading at 10x P/E, these are hardly awe-inspiring numbers 
for a high-flying growth stock.  
 
EZCH further constructs its long-term 3x revenue growth target by assuming that its average 
selling price (“ASP”) increases by 40% and the EZCH’s edge router market penetration 
increases from 30% to 40%, resulting in an additional 30% - 70% revenue boost (Q4 2012 
Investor Presentation). We take issue with both of these assumptions. As Moore’s Law helps 
explain, customers will demand higher performance at a lower cost over time. Even the high-
end chip titan Intel (INTC) posted flat year-over-year growth in 2012. EZCH clearly isn’t immune 
to this dynamic since revenue fell between 2010 and 2012 even though the next-generation NP-
4 began ramping in 2H 2011 (EZCH Q1 2011 Call). For these reasons, we’d only credit EZCH

with an inflationary-driven ASP growth of 3%/year. We also believe that any end-market 
replacement of ASICs by NPUs will be overshadowed by market share losses to Broadcom, 
Marvell, and other potential competitors, leading us to believe that EZCH’s end-market share 
will remain flat. By combining these two assumptions with Gartner’s end-market growth of 44%

At a 35%-40% GAAP EBITDA margin, the high-end of the historical trend, the 2016 revenue 
target of $85m would result in only $30 - $34m of EBITDA. A liberally high 6x-8x forward 
multiple results in an enterprise value of $179m - $272m. After adding the current cash balance 
of $168m plus $50m for the interim cash generation, we can then infer a market capitalization 
target of $400m - $490m, or about $14 - $17/share.

The Problem with Neglecting EZCH’s Stock-based Compensation Expense 
 
Warren Buffet, among others, has repeatedly attempted to educate investors on the lunacy of 
treating SBC as a non-expense. In the chart below, we’ve shown how large of an impact stock 
expense has had on EZCH’s results:

EZCH’s Customer Concentration Makes it Susceptible to a Sudden Correction 
 
Without a doubt, Cisco has been the savior of EZCH’s stock price over the past year. The router 
vendor has represented between 37% to 49% of EZCH’s revenue over the past four quarters 
and an even greater percentage of gross profits given the royalty arrangement. While investors 
have hitherto overlooked the competitive shifts brooding in the NPU market, they would stand at 
attention if EZCH lost a major customer. Should Cisco, or any of EZchip’s other major 
customers, award an NPU contract to Broadcom in 2013, EZCH shares could experience a fate 
similar to that of many other overly concentrated hardware suppliers. A recent example in the 
technology sector is Audience (ADNC), a maker of audio processors for smart phones. Like 
EZchip, Audience was heavily reliant on a single customer, in this case Apple, which 
represented 55% of Audience’s Q2 2012 revenue. After it was announced that Apple would use 
in-house audio processors in the iPhone 5, Audience shares experienced a one-day fall of over 
60%. The chart below helps illustrate the risks involved in heavily concentrated technology 
suppliers.

VI. Conclusion 
 
EZCH was able to prevent a share price collapse despite its terrible 2012 results by diverting 
attention to the research-stage NPS chip. Never mind that the NPS product is 4+ years away 
from contributing meaningfully to revenue and that the underfollowed Intel spinout Netronome 
has a sustainable manufacturing edge. But with this trump card now played, EZCH investors 
and analysts have now begun to examine the looming competitive threats from Broadcom, 
Marvell, and in-house chip design teams. Huawei’s apparent decision to select in-house designs 
over EZCH puts another crack in management’s long-term revenue growth projections, which 
on further study appear to be built on little more than wishful thinking. It’s not hard to imagine a 
scenario where Broadcom’s 200Gb/s NPU wins at least one or two customers away from EZCH 
and confidence in the stock quickly collapses. Moreover, continued weakness in the wireline 
capex market should keep organic growth muted through 2013. As stated by EZCH’s CEO on 
the Q3 earnings call, “The revenue ramp of these customers will depend on the success of their 
new NP-4 platforms in the market, which in turn is driven by the CapEx levels of the carriers” 
(Q3 Earnings Call). These very basic end-market and competitive concerns lead us to believe 
that EZCH’s sky-high 32.5x 2013E P/E is simply unsustainable.
