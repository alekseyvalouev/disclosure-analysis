Implications Of Organovo Lawsuit
Aug. 1, 2013 9:35 AM ET91 comments
by: Richard Pearson


I last wrote about Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) on July 24th. Since my last
article, there have been several new developments, which further reinforce the short
thesis on the stock. The stock has continued to fall as expected.


First, the S3 registration statement for up to $100 million of new shares and/or warrants
has now become effective. Some individuals had previously taken comfort that no offering
would be impending because the S3 was not yet effective. It is now the case that
Organovo is free to issue up to $100 million of equity securities at any time.


Second, I have uncovered an undisclosed legal action against Organovo by their own
investment banker, Spencer Trask Ventures ("STV"). The initial arbitration filing was
submitted on June 27th, when STV demanded compensation, which is now valued at
around $28 million. Under the terms of the original Placement Agency Agreement,
Organovo had agreed to binding arbitration. However, on June 28th, Organovo filed in
New York Civil Supreme Court to attempt to fight the arbitration.


There have now been a flurry of arguments and counter arguments in New York Civil
Supreme Court during the months of June and July.


One issue is that this may prove to be a significant financial issue for Organovo. But as a
totally separate issue, this is already a significant disclosure problem for Organovo
investors.


None of this has been disclosed to investors, including in the S3 registration statement,
which just became effective a few days ago.


Preliminary points


Before getting into these issues, there are a few preliminary points that deserve to be
made.


Following my article, Seeking Alpha contributor Jason Napodano wrote a forceful rebuttal
to my article. It was his 4th bullish article on Organovo in less than 1 year.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593382-implications-of-organovo-lawsuit 2/32


In his article, Mr. Napodano makes it clear that the points in my article are either entirely
irrelevant or else downright inaccurate. The author supports these statements with a mix
of facts, opinions and anonymous postings from a Yahoo message board.


There are now three main issues, which investors need to resolve for themselves.


1. How much (if any) of the 32 million share overhang is currently depressing the share
price?


2. How much (if any) equity is Organovo likely to issue under the recent S3 registration
statement?


3. How much (if any) revenue is Organovo likely to generate in the next 1, 5 and 10
years?


Clearly, I disagree with Mr. Napodano on each of these points.


A substantial overhang pressing on the share price from the 32 million shares from 2012
is evidenced by the fact that Organovo still filed a subsequent prospectus on these
shares. Once the overhang is fully removed, there will not be additional prospectuses.


Organovo is likely to complete a very large financing under the $100 million S3 sooner
rather than later. It has been less than one year since the company deliberately reduced
the exercise price of the existing $1.00 warrants to just 80 cents in order to get money in
the door at that price. We can also see from the STV lawsuit that Organovo tried to
incentivize STV to exercise by reducing the strike price to just 60 cents. This means that
Organovo was attempting to issue new shares at a price of just 60 cents as recently as
February / March.


For revenue, Organovo may have some prospects with liver cell modules at sometime in
2014. But we have been given no indication of the certainty or the amounts, which may be
involved. The key point here is that the hype surrounding Organovo is in connection with
the 3D printing of human organs. Not even the most bullish authors expect to see
manufactured human organ revenues any time in the foreseeable future. Instead, we will
continue to see small amounts of revenue from grants and research collaborations.
Historically these have typically been in the range of six figure amounts.


In the meantime, we can see that Organovo has been successful in two areas:


- selling stock to investors at $1.00 (or below)


- elevating its share price to above $6.00

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593382-implications-of-organovo-lawsuit 3/32


The company has recently been sporting a fully diluted market cap of nearly half a billion
dollars, despite the following financial metrics:


- lifetime revenues of just a few million dollars (coming from grants and research)


- non cash assets (including all intellectual property) of less than $2 million


Metrics like these do not justify a market cap anywhere near half a billion dollars.


A very small but vocal minority of readers continues to post their emotional comments
below these articles. However, a much larger (and silent) majority chooses to express
their views by selling their stock rather than typing up rabid comments.


Prior to my article, the stock was hitting $7.70 in pre-market trading. Following my article
the stock fell to $6.50.


It is now the case that all investors have the benefit of full information from these various
articles and comments and the share price continues to slide rather than recover any lost
ground. Following his article on Organovo, Mr. Napodano left a subsequent comment
stating that he believes that "fair value" for the stock is around $4.00-5.00 - an additional
decline of as much as 20% from the current level. In the near term, I would agree with this
statement, which is why I continue to be short the stock. Although any potential equity
offering could potentially push the share price even lower.


An undisclosed legal action


In its past financings, Organovo used the services of Spencer Trask Ventures for raising
what now totals roughly $28 million in proceeds from stock and warrants. As of March,
Organovo had $15 million in cash remaining.


The lead individual involved was Adam K Stern, a Managing Director with STV. Mr. Stern
also became a Director of Organovo.


According to the terms of the Private Placement Agreement, Organovo would pay to STV
a cash fee equal to 10% of the proceeds along with "agent warrants" ($1.00 strike price, 5-
year maturity) equal to 20% of the stock issuable to investors. There was also an 18-
month "tail" provision allowing for additional fees to be payable to STV based on
subsequent capital raises. A key point of contention in the current lawsuit is that it was
agreed that STV would be appointed as an exclusive Warrant Solicitation Agent at least
20 days prior to any notice of redemption. Organovo agreed to not contact any of the
investors introduced on STV's proprietary investor list.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593382-implications-of-organovo-lawsuit 4/32


In 2012, Organovo Director Stern left Spencer Trask and went to Aegis Capital. Shortly
thereafter, the arbitration suit states that Organovo began the warrant solicitation to raise
new money from STV customers. But instead of using (or even notifying) STV, Organovo
used Mr. Stern's new firm, Aegis.


In total, Organovo raised $14.8 million through the warrant exercises. In fact, Organovo
lowered the exercise price on warrants to just 80 cents in order to raise new money at that
level.


STV did not find out about any of this until it became public information through Organovo
filings.


STV and Organovo are now in a protracted legal battle in which STV is demanding the
disgorgement (and payment) of $14.8 million along with $1.3 million in cash fees and the
issuance of 2.9 million warrants owed. The warrants alone would currently be worth
around $12 million. Total consideration is therefore now in the area of $28 million.


During 2013, and after the warrant transactions conducted via Aegis, Organovo and STV
began negotiating a Warrant Agreement, which would arrange for payment of
compensation to STV. A second draft of the Warrant Agreement was also provided.


On March 1st, Spencer Trask's attorneys sent an email to Organovo CEO Keith Murphy
rescinding the proposed agreement. A copy of the rescind email can be found here.


Following the rescinding, Organovo still sent small payments to STV, however these
payments totaled just $115,000, instead of the much larger sum demanded by STV.


Section 13 of the Placement Agency Agreement states (in ALL CAPS) that any "dispute,
claim or controversy" which arises with respect to this agreement will be submitted to
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") in the State of New York.


STV filed for arbitration on June 27th.


The next day, on June 28th, Organovo filed to fight the move for arbitration, stating that
the Warrant Solicitation Agreement voided both the compensation earned by STV as well
as the need for arbitration.


As is often the case, many dirty secrets get spilled out in lawsuits. Organovo reveals that it
had already agreed to pay to STV $23 million in exchange for helping Organovo raise just
$15 million in proceeds. The need to pay such a fee is staggering in and of itself.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593382-implications-of-organovo-lawsuit 5/32


The lawsuits also reveal that Organovo was willing to lower the strike price on STV's
warrants to just 60 cents, in order to raise equity at that level. This was not in the distant
past. This was in February / March.


Both of these facts speak loudly to the fact that Organovo has always been eager to issue
equity at just about any price, no matter how low. The company has virtually no non-cash
assets and continues to generate only minimal and non-commercial revenues. So getting
money at any price may well be the best strategy.


But it also reconfirms my suspicion that if the company is eager to issue substantial equity
for just pennies, then it will likely be a very large issuer of equity with the price sitting at
just over $5.00. A normal discount for an equity offering like this would be around 20%,
meaning that an offering would likely take place at around $4.00. One would also expect
heavy warrant coverage once again. The stock price would then react accordingly.


Investors now need to ask themselves two very important questions:


First, how much of the $28 million in demanded compensation will Organovo end
up paying to Spencer Trask ?


Second, why are investors hearing about a potential $28 million legal liability from
me, rather than from Organovo in an 8K or S3 legal disclosure ?


Reverse mergers in perspective


Commercializing a new product or service in the real world is an arduous and time-
consuming task. Successes are rare and often take decades to make themselves evident.


Reverse merger stock promotions, in sharp contrast, are far easier. It is very simple to
achieve 8 and 9 figure fortunes in the space of just a year or two.


Step one is to acquire the busted shell of a defunct company. Step two is to complete a
reverse merger and inject some token amount of assets. Step three is to change the
name. Step four is to heavily promote the story.


A few years ago, when China was hot, it was possible to create $500 million dollars by
simply creating a reverse merger with the "China" in the name. Hundreds of these
companies were uplisted to the NYSE and NASDAQ. Before that, when solar was hot,
there were numerous half billion-dollar companies created just by having some hint of a
5/22/2018 Implications Of Organovo Lawsuit - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593382-implications-of-organovo-lawsuit 6/32


solar business. Prior to that adding ".com" to a company's name would often create similar
valuations for reverse mergers. But in the end, when these companies failed to produce
profits, we saw them ultimately plunge to the pennies.


As noted in "Get Rich or Die Tryin'," there are two kinds of investors in these promotions.
The "Get Rich" crowd gets in early at very low prices.


It is important to note that the Get Rich crowd has no intention of waiting for the product
to be an ultimate commercial success. Instead, they cash out when the promotion of the
stock and the story hits a peak.


Many authors (such as Mr. Napodano) have clearly expressed their views that the early
investors in Organovo have already sold their stock - well before any commercial
success is even close. They had no intention of waiting around for real world success
because they were simply playing a stock promotion - not a product.


I agree that these investors will sell well before commercialization. But I also believe that
they would be smart enough to wait for the price and liquidity, which is provided by the
uplisting. This is why I believe that they are selling now.


Early investors cannot sell unless someone else is doing the buying. Likewise, investors
who buy these stocks should be aware that every time they buy, it is the result of someone
else being eager to sell. This is where the Die Tryin' crowd comes in.


It is well known that institutions tend to steer clear of reverse merger promotions. As a
result, reverse mergers rely heavily on promotion to retail investors.


For example, Organovo has made ample use of a service called
RetailInvestorConferences.com.


Retail investors can often take comfort from various sources of "validation" which may not
be appropriate.


For example, some investors believe that an uplisting to the NASDAQ or the NYSE is
reflective of some sort of judgment on the investment merits of a stock. This is quite
clearly not the case.


In recent years, there were hundreds of Chinese reverse mergers which uplisted to the
NYSE and the NASDAQ. It was ultimately uncovered that many of these companies were
empty shell frauds with virtually no assets or employees. Most of these companies were

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1593382-implications-of-organovo-lawsuit 7/32


delisted to the pink sheets just as quickly. Taking any confidence from the uplisting was
clearly a mistake.


The only point I am trying to make is that an uplisting will improve liquidity, but does not
have any implication for the investment merits of a company. Note: I am not making any
suggestion that Organovo is a fraud.


Likewise, many investors assume that obtaining a research grant is also validation of the
long-term potential of a company. Sometimes this can be the case. But we can also see
that the list of non-productive research grants is very long and very large.


Examples include a $3 million federal grant to study the game World of Warcraft and a
$2.6 million program to teach Chinese prostitutes to drink responsibly.


My point is not to suggest that Organovo's grants are without merit. Instead, my point is to
suggest that obtaining a few million in grant money is a very common occurrence for many
creative ventures in the US.


So far, Organovo has not achieved any meaningful degree of commercial success. But the
stock promotion has been extremely successful.


Despite minimal assets and revenues, the company has been able to briefly exceed half a
billion dollars in market cap. The recent rise briefly put the value of CEO Keith Murphy's
stock at nearly $40 million in a very short time since coming public.


Fortunes like this often take decades to achieve when one is dependent upon the actual
commercial success of a product. But with reverse merger stocks, they often take just a
year or two.


Ultimately, Organovo may end up being the reverse merger that transforms the nature of
medicine as we know it. If so, it will end up being worth many billions of dollars.


On the other hand, if Organovo fails, someone will come along, acquire the defunct shell
and start over with a new billion-dollar reverse merger idea. The name will be changed
and so on.


Fortunately we are all able to come to our own investment conclusions with respect to
these divergent potential outcomes and we are all able to act accordingly.


I am short Organovo.

Obviously a short seller trying to scare others into selling. If that is not his goal why is he doing this ??

The question isn't his motivations, the correct question is 'should you be scared?'


I think he's answered that amply well . . . YES!


I sometimes wonder if Pearson isn't running his own little NSA operation since he seems to see things before
they happen. And so, yes, just as he predicted as soon as the market closed today ONVO announced they
would be launching a secondary offering. The question now with the stock having given up all today's gains
as soon as the news came out is . . . at what discount to market? Pearson posits a 20% discount and that
strikes me based on other offerings I've seen to be just about right.


So imagine what the market will do when an offering at 4.25 gets announced? Check out what happened to
RSOL recently when they did the same. The stock was trading in the 4.50 range, the offering was in the high
2's and the stock immediately cratered. The same is going to happen to ONVO though perhaps a tad less
extreme.


Please don't listen to the shorts though! The best way to learn good trading lessons is through making
mistakes . . . if you're able to learn from them. So go ahead keep buying or holding ONVO and try to learn
from your losses. Or else do nothing and get chewed up and spit out by the market.

Motivations, 'should you be scared?'...ahh the frothing begins


Careful, you are pretty close to testimony there! 
Launching of the secondary is not unknown, not a prediction.  
After hours news releases gives people time to filter, but panic if you must. 
20% seems high, more like 7.5%. It is a development company so high side acceptable.


Don't care about RSOL, not the same. Tad less extreme, solar and all.

the company is doing to give me a haircut. I bailed and am happy I'm not holding (yet another) potentially
great company about to crater in the short term.

an investing strategy with a longer time perspective is better for me... you will do what works (or does not

One thing you learn about being in business: stay in business long enough and you will eventually be sued at least
once. Organovo has tremendous potential which cannot be denied. If even a small portion of this potential is realized,
your short thesis will be blown out of the water.

There will always be lawsuits. That doesn't change my opinion one bit about Organovo. Successful implantation of
printable organs may be a decade or more away, but they can still print them and test drugs on them outside of the
human body eliminating the need to test drugs on humans and animals. This alone is a reason to be long on ONVO.

The lawsuit was hidden from everyone, exchanges included - not that they would have cared one whit. You all
seem to believe the exchanges are really worried about sullying their own reputation by listing shady
companies. You clearly do not understand capitalism Wall St style. New listings bring new money which is
exactly what the shareholders of the exchanges demand.


Don't cry to them Argentina when you lose your butt.

"For revenue, Organovo may have some prospects with liver cell modules at sometime in 2014. But we have been
given no indication of the certainty or the amounts, which may be involved."


Organovo is not focussing just on liver cell modules...They are focussed on generating wide array of tissues
representing many organ systems. The fact that they are able to make a complex liver tissue model gives further
confidence on their technology.


Also, considering the amount of money spent by companies on RnD, if Organovo will get even 1% of it, the short term
revenues from Pfizer alone will be in millions of dollars... Look at the below numbers and as we know that Pfizer is
already working with ONVO, I think we are almost there to get some real $$...The potential here is huge and it's not
even speculative...ONVO has the technology and we know companies like Pfizer are already testing/using it.... $5 is
freakkinn low for this stock with hundreds of millions in revenues comin up... GO ONVO!!!

Mr Peason has a way with words that do not reflect that actual nature of events. The law suit notes that STV wanted
more than the 40% distcount on warrents than Organovo was willing to offer so STV threaten to sue.

http://bit.ly/17VUfGi (please read #2).


In addition the S-3 was posted on Organovo's website July 17th the day after they announce Richard Heymen as a
new director to the company. He has sold his own company to Johnson & Johnson for $1 Billion. He has company
buyout experience.


In terms of the over hang as noted by Mr Peason I simply do not think this statement makes sense. First-off, these 32
million shares were not unlocked in April 2013 through the Form 424B3 noted above. They were unlocked back on
June 13, 2012 through the filing of a Form S-1 Registration Statement. Keep in mind, as found in the company's most
recent Form 10-K/T, on May 1, 2013 the number of outstanding shares totaled 64.7 million. Subtracting the 32.0
million the author thinks became unlocked in April, and another 23.7 million we know were unlocked in February 2013
(under Rule 144) following the one-year anniversary of the reverse merger, that leaves only 9.0 million shares
available for trading in 2012. All this information can be found in the Form 8-K outlining the reverse merger back in
February 2012.


From July 2012 to February 2013, Organovo traded some 95 million shares. It's ridiculous to think that 9.0 million
shares and warrants, many in the hands of insiders, created 95 million shares of trading volume over those eight
months. To me, it is obvious that the 32 million shares Mr. Pearson is concerned will be dumped on the market over
the next few weeks has already been traded, over-and-over, dating back to the June 13, 2012 Form S-1 filing. There
is no 32 million share overhang waiting to be sold in my opinion. 
One final note, between July 8th and July 24th, Organovo traded 62.4 million shares. That's almost the entire
outstanding share count in 13 trading days


With regard to making money in the near term the Life Sciences market is a $40B market that currently relys on two
dimensional petre dishes to conduct drug discovery. Organovo's 3D application for liver toxicity would be a better
representation of actual human tissue in essense a "game changer".


A 1% penetration of this market would be $400M in revenue, current company revenue is $1.2 i.e. a 400 X increase
would impact the stock price significantly.


It is true that within a week of announcing there uplisitng ONVO share price was up from $3.92 (07/09/2013) to $8.50
more than a %100 increase for just an uplisting I can see how that might invited shorters to short the stock.


With regards to the business fundemental Organovo is the only company in the WORLD who is in BIO-PRINTING.
There is no competition. With Pfizer due to report back in the coming months it's exciting times.

Well done. By systematically refuting each point of this "article" with actual facts instead of speculation and
innuendo (as Mr. Pearson has done), it has become clear to anybody paying attention that Mr. Pearson is at
best tragically uninformed, and at worst a shill for larger short positions.

Yes we should pity the misguided longs who listened to Mr. Pearson's first article 'red hot but set to drop' and
got out of ONVO. They only were able to sell their ONVO shares in the $7 range. The smarty-pants types - of
which you must be one - paid it no mind and now enjoy underwater shares at 5.00.


You've really put Pearson in his place.

Good to see ya back Dick. Thought maybe since no response to the comments on your previous article, something
might have happened to you.


I guess I'll start my rabid comments off with this from the IR of Organovo. It's from the article you quote, and
addresses some of your statements.


On May 17, 2013, at 11:56 AM, "Ir organovo" <ir@organovo.com> wrote:


Dear Sir,


We have not reviewed the comment you refer to on that article, and do not plan to cross check it with our outgoing
statements. However, we have reviewed the article itself. Our comments on the article would be as follows:


No new shares are created or announced in the April 4, 2013 filing 
Our filing of April 4, 2013 reflects not new shares but the resale of shares by investors who participated in private
financings in 2012 as it clearly states. Before these investors can resell their shares, the SEC requires that the shares
be registered or otherwise qualify for an exemption from the registration requirement. Organovo sold these shares
and warrants in February and March, 2012, and first filed an S-1 to register these shares for resale in July, 2012. The
filing on April 4, 2013 serves to update that filing to incorporate additional information subsequently filed with the SEC,
such as our audited financial statements for fiscal 2012. But in short, no new shares are created or announced in the
April 4, 2013 filing – it describes the resale of existing shares, and shares underlying existing warrants. Please see
the March 26, 2013 filing for additional information. As there is no sale of shares, there is clearly also no insider
selling described in this filing.


Shares from April 4, 2013 filing were available for resale as of July 2012 
As you know, we completed a series of private placements in February and March 2012 in connection with our merger
to become a publicly traded company. Our agreement with the investors participating in those private placements
requires us to register their shares for resale on a Form S-1 and to keep the registration statement effective for at
least one full year. We filed a registration statement in April 2013 in order to keep the resale registration statement
effective, as required by that agreement. Under the SEC’s rules, we were required to file an updated registration

statement to include the report of our audited financial statements for fiscal 2012. As a result, our registration
statement filed in April 2013 does not reflect the registration of new shares, but is a refresh of the registration
statement we initially filed in July 2012 as required by our contract with the private placement investors. These shares
have been available for resale since July 2012 and it seems irresponsible to create a fear that this would have sudden
impact in mid-2013. We have previously stated that these shares likely did have the impact seen on the stock in July
2012, because only 6M shares previous to that were avaiable for public trading. The law of supply and demand was
at work then, but to suggest that suddenly after nearly a year these 32M shares would start trading betrays ignorance
of what the April 4 filing was, ignorance that may have resulted from not reading and understanding our March 26
filing. Organovo's stock traded over 40M shares in January alone - a substantial portion that month and every day
from July until then would have to have been from the 32M pool, because the only other shares available at that time
were the original 6M.


Dilution comment by Mr. Murphy in Retail Investor Conference Presentation  
Mr. Murphy certainly did not state that the company’s future “dilution could potentially be 2x - 3x.” Mr. Murphy stated
that if Organovo chose to pursue future fundraising, it would do so only when the potential return to shareholders
through spending additional capital made sense. The Board and management develop a business plan focused on
building long-term value for stockholders. As part of this plan, the Board and management decide to pursue certain
development opportunities which require capital expenditures. We need to have available capital to support our
business plan, and with a platform technology, additional spending in promising new areas may unlock tremendous
value.  
Mr. Murphy stated that one way for investors to view it was that a small amount of dilution in return for increasing cash
on hand to 2 to 3 times current levels could be seen to be potentially beneficial. An example with simple math can
expand on that: if Organovo wished to approximately double its previously described cash on hand, by raising $15M
gross at the May 14 closing stock price, that would require sale of 3M shares, or 4% dilution (relative to the current
fully diluted shares of 75M). Organovo being able to double its R&D spending capability with a very small amount of
dilution may be attractive to investors as an overall proposition – it certainly would be to the institutions participating in
any such raise!


There were other errors in the article, which Organovo reserves the right to address in the future. Organovo
encourages skepticism both internally and externally, and thinks that probing discussions make both our investors and
our business stronger. However, on occasion the number of errors in any particular piece can rise to an unacceptable
level, which we believe they did in this case. 
Best regards, 
Organovo IR

That's right!


'I've begun to cover ONVO just as I covered KNDI at 4.50 and didn't try to ride that one all the way back to
3.50 whence it came from. I also recently covered UNXL in the 13's following its crash from the 30's. Likewise
I'm willing to accord some gain to ONVO's uplisting meaning it will probably bottom in the 4.50 range too for
now. So I'm beginning to cover and after today I'm down to -85,000 shares which fortunately I was able to get
from a broker that doesn't charge interest on borrows (otherwise you're forking over the equivalent of 50% a
year, about 4% a month, just to hold the position though it hardly matters if the stock is dropping 45% in a
matter of days).'

I am constantly amazed at the number of people who get upset by some one's opinion about a stock.


Looks like some one like that would avoid SA like the plague, but they seem to actually enjoy it.


Really people, these articles don't move the price. They are, after all, just opinions.


It is the buyers and sellers who move the price of the stock. I can guarantee that two different people can read
the same article, and come to totally conflicting conclusions about it.


It looks like winter may be here before I consider purchasing ONVO.

Brightclouds - could you explain how this article could account for the late selloff today? It came out in the

that investors ignored the story until word appears to have leaked late in the day that the company would be
filing a secondary once the market closed. Which they did. What does this have to do with Pearson?

Concerning the PR, coming out on a day when the stock is surging, is a ridiculous statement. We have known

Mr pearson, Thanks for a great article you were in the right track all along, I do regret being long in this stock
before I had a chance to read your articles, my question is where do you think the stock will go from here?
Will the extra cash make the stock fundamentals more appealing to existing and new investors? Would it be
worthwhile to short the stock at $5 if perhaps the recent price plunge from $8 to $5 was discounting the news
that just came out today after the close?


02 Aug 2013, 12:33 AM

'See you at $4.'


That wasn't long! We're already down to 4.90 in the pre-market. I can promise the longs one thing; if it stays
down here or goes lower it's going to trigger another avalanche of forced margin selling just like took out the
attempted recovery on Weds. Watch for 1 pm which is when brokers typically begin shoving shares out the
door for those customers who can't bring themselves to pull the trigger - and they're a lot!


Prediction: dcmorris will continue making plaintive arguments for why this is all so unreasonable people.

The company has set the base for what they consider the current value, $4.50. But understand, this was
easily known and the shorts now will cover as this is also their peak. This has become risky for them below
this base, and being crafty beasts, won't risk it lower.


No more wounded pleadings as you say, only reality. Since you are implacable in your pontificating, I'm going
to break my rules and set my long position, in less than 46 posts.

This is how I have traded this stock. Listen to all information and filter it with your own comfort level, and

Further realities, Organovo has only offered 40mil of the known S-3, so this scenario should repeat itself in
the future. Sorry to ruin your next opportunity for presaging. I am still waiting on a response on the false

11mil shares traded today, 2mil more than the secondary offering that will be complete on 8/7. Understand
what that means. The company has provided a floor of valuation that is reasonable for today and tomorrow is
coming. Organovo has paid its debt to Wall Street and now has the cash it needs, and its not for admin
expenses. Do your due diligence and remember why you are here. Peace

It is disturbing to me that people get angry about "Reporting".


The more information we have, the better investors we will be. The better decisions we will make, and there is no
such thing as "Bad" news. News, is just news. only tilted people consider information bad.


If there is something afoul going on in a company in which I happen to be a partial owner of, I want to know about this
specifics of this, and I want to know it fast, as possible. The magnitude of which, I can decide, if I wish to stay and buy
more, or just hold, or sell some, or dump entirely, or in some extremely rare cases....seek justice.


Short Sellers ought not be insulted by the investing public, the way they have been lately. Guys like Bill Ackman, tend
to work work significantly harder than your average long investor, Because winning on the Short side is about 10
times harder.


So please try to show these guys a little respect.

Sameer, I think a company like Organovo should be bought on the dips. I only have a small position right now,
700 shares, but I am going to buy more on the dips. Then I am going to hold tight for the long ride. Organovo
has great potential and with no competition because of their patent exclusivity. ONVO was recently uplisted
from OTC to the NYSE and once institutional and mutual funds start buying in, the price will start to take off.
Like Amazon.com was to online retail, I believe Organovo will be to the bioprinting world.

Maybe you ought to wait to see some evidence of institutional buying first. Stocks uplist to the majors all the
time and stay ignored by the smart money.

I almost wonder if the offering anouncement was hastily rushed out ahead of schedule to anounce the litigation
matter. If you read through it 424B5 filing you will seem them discuss the legal matter with STV there. 
As Mr. Pearson said - it was not written anywhere else. I was hoping to jump in on the secondary...but now I am
concerned with this company's protocol and practices.


01 Aug 2013, 07:03 PM


Mukticat
I'm wondering the very same thing. The initial S-3 filed on 7/26 made no mention of the lawsuit and now after
Richard's article they do? Is it really possible they got caught trying to hide this and had to pull a quick
correction??


Whatever it is it's not nearly the only reason to be concerned with their protocols.


01 Aug 2013, 07:48 PM


Mukticat
After the way the company cut the legs out from all of the investors who believed in them and were willing to pay as
much as $8.50 a share perhaps Mr. Pearson should write another article explaining how just as KNDI 'punked their
investors' by hyping the stock through spurious social media outfits (stock promoters) and got their equity raise the
stock was abandoned and left to tank, ONVO's just done the same thing.

Your quotes:


1) "I am constantly amazed at the number of people who get upset by some one's opinion about a stock.


Looks like some one like that would avoid SA like the plague, but they seem to actually enjoy it.


Really people, these articles don't move the price. They are, after all, just opinions".


Experienced investors can distinguish between opinion and fact. 
This statement from this article is fact: 
{100 million of new shares and/or warrants has now become effective}.


That is an example of what readers react to. The following stock offering gave it credence. And it's these very facts
that move share price. And these facts are started in SA articles. 
Which means these articles DO move PPS.


2nd quote: "It is the buyers and sellers who move the price of the stock. I can guarantee that two different people can
read the same article, and come to totally conflicting conclusions about it".


The problem with bullish/bearish pieces for readers is taking the time to try and detect what separates opinion from
fact. Seeking Alpha strongly supports their platform...to the point of bragging about it inn their editor's notes when
certain stocks take off as a direct result of public reaction and/or awareness.


The line between truth and perception of truth is a rather fuzzy one at times, and it is often characterized by
deception. This given article credibly refutes SA author Napodano's bullish thesis. Napodano is a paid pumper for
Zachs and PropThink. This doesn't mean he hasn't presented facts of his own. But the term 'consider the source' is
applicable.


Your referring to SA articles as being opinion-based tells me you don't (always) recognize where this fuzzy line is
drawn. And you have plenty of company. It's good to keep in mind that as long as SA supports a platform where
deception is prevalent, this "line" will continue to shrink.


03 Aug 2013, 03:48 AM

Rick Berger, I disagree. These SA articles may be part of the reason for investors making the decisions that
they do, but they are not moving the price all by themselves. I would venture to say that most of the ONVO

sellers and buyers have never even heard of SA.


As for the fuzzy line between truth and perception of truth, you might ask Pontius Pilate about that, I am more
interested in results.


Too many people view the investment arena, (more properly, the speculative arena), as a contest of
intelligence and morality. I view it as a game with a simple score keeping mechanism. Did I make or lose on
this position?


For example, I did OK with my ONVO speculation, a little bit over 50% profit after being long a few weeks.
This is not an indication of my intelligence. I was long, but this is not an indication of my morality. If I had been
really smart, I would have waited until it passed $8 and would have shorted immediately after selling. Long or
short is no indication of morality, the name of the game is to buy low and sell high, the order in which you do
that is unimportant.


03 Aug 2013, 11:23 AM


Rick Berger
One note: I'm not saying this article caused the SIGNIFICANT spike. The stock offering did, but the article warned of
upcoming dilution.


There are countless articles that have directly affected stock price, and IMO this piece would have negatively affected
PPS with or without the stock offering, just not to such a significant degree.

I will repeat myself if necessary. If I was sure I could get some shares on the secondary and then short it down to 4.50
would I not do this?

The answer to this question is yes. One of the elements I place in my scan as I peruse for alpha is the investor base.

Watch it bub! I was that retail fool. Bought 3000 at $4.80 and at closing bought 1000 shares at $4.5673. Paid about
$4.745 for the total of 4000 shares and given the opportunity I plan to dollar cost average to bring down my cost. My
point is that at times you race to catch a race car. Onvo will soon soar. It is a winner and has caught the imagination
and hope of big pockets and PHARMA. It is not a scam, more of a rocket type ride. If it is a submarine I will put on my
scuba gear and ride it out. I do think that facts and the companies SEC fillings show ONVO will soon soar and
manifest signs of being a winner around this time next year.

have never even heard of SA."


You'd be amazed how many retail investors follow and invest from SA articles. (IMO, many of them are tired of low
interest rates on conventional, no-risk investments and have decided to take charge of their own investments, using
on-line brokerage firms to avoid the cost of paying banks and brokers. They have extremely limited knowledge of the
inner workings of the market place and are thus susceptible to slanted articles). These articles definitely have an
affect on short term share price. And I have plenty of proof from copied posts, articles and immediate market reaction.


The reason I've collected them began when many of my posts had been deleted while those from others, which have
included "bannable wording/tone" have not been. I have brought it to the attention of the managing editor recently.


In addition, he and I had a discussion regarding the SA bearish/bullish platform. This was before the 'editor notes'
began, as I was about to show a direct correlation to stock price reaction, almost DOWN TO THE MINUTES when
given articles were published. To my surprise, the 'editor notes' started appearing. Here's an example of some SA
editor notes:

There's many, many more. They advocate their impact, which amazes me because it can be construed as market
manipulation in many cases. But it's been allowed to continue, so more power to those who benefit.


As for what it takes to be successful in the market place, inside information is what separates the rich from the

patience is the most intricate element.

Richard Pearson " since dirty little secrets get spilled out"


Since we have only heard your rendition of STV's position, I thought it appropriate to post Organovo's perspective,
from them:


Spencer Trask Matter.  
On June 28, 2013, we filed a lawsuit for declaratory relief in the Supreme Court for the State of New York (case #
652305/2013) against Spencer Trask Ventures, Inc. (“STV”) in connection with a Warrant Solicitation Agency
Agreement (the “WSAA”) that we entered into with STV in February 2013. In this action, we are seeking a declaration
that the WSAA remains a valid and enforceable agreement. Over the course of several weeks in February 2013,
Organovo and STV, through their respective attorneys, negotiated the WSAA pursuant to which we engaged STV as
our warrant solicitation agent in connection with our efforts to solicit the exercise of outstanding Organovo warrants
during the first quarter of 2013. STV’s President signed the WSAA on behalf of STV, and our CEO executed the
agreement on behalf of Organovo. Spencer Trask provided services to us pursuant to the WSAA, and we have paid
STV for those services.


Our dispute with Spencer Trask arose in March 2013 after we approached Spencer Trask about exercising their
outstanding warrants to help the Company qualify for uplisting its common stock on the NYSE MKT. Previously,
Spencer Trask had not asserted any claims for additional compensation as a result of the warrant tender offer we
completed in December 2012. In March 2013, we received two demand letters from STV, and a demand for
arbitration notice in June 2013. In the first demand letter, STV alleges that it is entitled to compensation (including a
cash fee and warrants to purchase common stock) as a result of the warrant tender offer we completed in December
2012 and as a result of the warrant redemption we completed in March 2013. In the second letter, STV alleges it is
entitled to damages because we allegedly violated confidentiality provisions in the Placement Agency Agreement (the
“PAA”) we had previously entered into with STV in December 2012 in connection with the private placement
financings we completed in February and March 2012 (the “Private Placements”), by contacting the warrant holders
who participated in the warrant tender offer. In response, on June 28, 2013, we filed a lawsuit for declaratory relief in
the Supreme Court for the State of New York against STV. Our tender offer was made to warrant holders of record
relating to warrants already owned by them and whose identity was public information via a Registration Statement on
Form S-1 we were required to file to register the resale of the shares underlying their warrants. For these and other
reasons, including applicability of the WSAA, we believe STV is not entitled to compensation under the PAA and there
was no violation of confidentiality. To our knowledge, STV has not filed its arbitration demand with the arbitrator.


We believe that the assertions made against us by STV are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously
defend against the claims made by STV, including any arbitration matter filed by STV. We have not established a loss
contingency accrual for these claims because any potential liability is not probable or estimable.

The latest share count is 75,000,000 and the marketcap is nearly HALF A BILLION. The only thing they're lacking is
about half a billion in revenues for all this to begin to make sense.


But when you have a neat story the sky's the limit and what could go wrong?


09 Aug 2013, 06:26 PM


dcmorris
Why you here...did your employer send you back to speak for him again? Just like a writer with an agenda to send his
dog, but I'm still waiting on him to answer the misinformation in his articles. A correction is warranted.


Your opportunistic event is over and no new event to short on the horizon, so one could only assume that you didn't
cover your 'slightly larger' position. Your wolf crying warnings need work, no product sales and what could go wrong
are rather sophomoric now and are low hanging fruit. Do better or go home.


It's sad that you defend the existence of Organovo and the secondary offering that gave them 43.3mil in operating
cash, as boogie men under the bed. You truly don't understand this development stage company and its potential to
make profits. The market says the company is worth a sp of $5.57(342.3mil cap to be exact) +19% in the last 5 days
since the secondary offering, and that is fact.  
The market believes the potential and has valued it accordingly.


For those that care to know the 'neat story':


"Our primary efforts continue to be focused in research and development, progressing toward commercial launch of
our first product, expanding the applications of our platform technology, and improving the capabilities of our 3D
bioprinter. The results from this work, first publicly released in April, foreshadow many more good things to come. Our
3D Liver project, the first project launched internally with the financing from going public last year, has returned results
that are truly spectacular. We plan to leverage the power of these results to the fullest. Our intention is to launch a 3D
Liver product in 2014 that will allow researchers in biology laboratories to access the power of the tissue that we’re
building in a setting that can improve drug development efficiency and better predict drug toxicity"


11 Aug 2013, 03:13 PM


Mukticat
Clearly math isn't your strong suit if you can't figure out how to multiply the share count times the stock price
to arrive at a marketcap.


'We are authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2013, there were an
aggregate of 72,589,375 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis.'


Add to this 9M shares just printed and the total is 81.5M shares times 5.50 equals $450M. But hey they might
pick up a couple of hundred thousand in sales from the liver thing . . . if it ever works, and it gets approved,
and it gets adopted by labs.


Meanwhile,


'For the three months ended June 30, 2013, total revenues of approximately $0.1 million were $0.2 million or
67% below the approximately $0.3 in revenues for the same period in 2012. Collaborative research revenues

for the three months ended June 30, 2013 of approximately $0.1 million decreased $0.2 million or 67% from
the same period of prior year of approximately $0.3 million in revenues.'


Man that's just exceptional! To the moon Alice!


11 Aug 2013, 06:57 PM


where_are_the_customers_yachts?
Mukticat, I realize I am new to this board, but that aside, you and I disagree on a basic and fundamental issue
here. You state that ONVO "might pick up a couple of hundred thousand from the liver thing" ... ok, your
estimate. Based upon the idea that a functional liver tissue (rather than two dimensional petri dish liver cells)
which can more readily detect problems with drugs, thus allowing drug companies to halt drug testing much
earlier (and much cheaper) in the drug development cycle will allow for testing of more drugs, thus allowing
for a greater number of drugs to make it to clinical trials at a cheaper price per drug, and thus a greater
chance of developing an effective medication that will be approved, it is my opinion that ONVO is in a position
to be able to earn significantly more than "a couple of hundred thousand". The R&D costs for a new drug are
huge in large part because so very many new drugs do not even make it into the clinical trial stage and the
functional liver tissue that can assist in terminating research into non-successful drugs at an earlier stage will
be an important thing to reduce the number of dollars that are spent on research into drugs that will never be
fully developed. The cost savings will be remarkable and ONVO will be in a position to be rewarded for that.


Secondly, the approval issue is a bit of a red herring at this point in time. IF the liver tissue can be shown to
function in a manner more closely resembling or actually equivalently with actual liver tissue and survive long
enough to allow for drug testing, the drug development companies will be all over this. It is not an issue of
approval, as it is the drug that will be approved, and not on the basis of the testing using the ONVO liver
tissue to help determine whether or not a drug is further developed to the point of clinical trials. The ONVO
liver tissue is only one step in the development process of the drug, and it will be used as an elimination
factor, not an approval factor - for the drug.


Now, if you would like to talk about approval for bioprinted organs for implantation, that is another issue. The
amount that ONVO "might pick up" will be substantially more than the amount from functioning liver tissue ..
and in my opinion, substantially more than "a couple of hundred thousand".


Absolutely ONVO is currently trading on some factual basis and a lot of hype and blue sky. There is going to
be a lot of volatility, allowing for traders to jump in and out. Good luck! I do not spend that much time glued to
the computer, nor do I believe that I will be able to get the inside info in a timely manner to allow me to
effectively trade the short term bumps and dips. As a long term focus, ONVO is certainly a stock with a
potential to explode on the basis of positive developments. It could happen, and then again, it wont be the
first time I placed some money into a stock with a long term story that did.. or did not work out. Just like some
of the sudden breaks (up or down) can work against one with a short term time frame.


Good luck to you in your market timing, and I hope for the best in my longer term vision for ONVO

Market Cuts Both Ways, Contributor
Since the article was posted on August 1, ONVO has risen around 23%. Richard you truly timed your advice to
perhaps the most inopportune time imaginable. Why again are you listed as 4 on Short Ideas? Maybe betting against
your advice is regularly the best strategy? Obviously I am not keen on people who spin information on this forum to
drive the market to their own ends.

And maybe if you wouldn't cherrypick your articles for their dates you would see that when Pearson's earlier July 24th
article on ONVO was published the stock was trading at 7.25. Most shorts - myself included - covered on the collapse
to 4.50. That qualifies this as another great short idea from Pearson.

... the bioprinting industry seems to be sending the message printing functional organ is years if not decades away.


While keeping cells nourished is yet to become easy, already achieved success of keeping cells alive and stacked up
(they naturally bind) into layers suggests the bioprinting industry will first achieve profitability before reaching the
ultimate goal of printing organs to save lives.


Fat tissues, thin layer of skin tissues, cartridge are less of an issue on keeping cells nourished (compared to liver).
Cosmetic industry is a billion dollar industry and that's another potential source of income.

An interesting question is, why would a company this size go on to get listed? Does the company only want to ride the
wave created by DDD and SSYS to get more temporary liquidity?


Looking at DDD's 1999-2013 price chart, stock price oscillated between slight loss and 200% gain till late 2010 when
it surged, DDD now sits at 1800% gain. HLF 2005-2013 chart tells a similar story: price moved between 0% and
250% gain, now at 950% gain.Given the US demographic trend, ONVO would be the perfect choice for high
speculation. $3-4 could be $100 15 years later.
