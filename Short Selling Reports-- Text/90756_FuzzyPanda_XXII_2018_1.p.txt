XXII


Reverse merger into mining shell; headquarters is located at a dentist office.


Negative gross margins - so revenue growth equals increased losses.


Rampant paid stock promotion (including free stock for buying cartons of
cigarettes).


"Technology" viewed as worthless by Major Tobacco + all companies, but XXII has
a low nicotine product. Low nicotine tobacco has been around since the 1930s!


Sea of red flags + consistent exaggeration about technology.

22nd Century is a negative gross margin business operated out of a dentist office that
went public via a reverse merger. It is now pushed by bankers tied to numerous stock
promotions and is audited by a firm better associated with nanocaps. Most of XXII's
+200% stock performance (from 170 million to 460 million market cap) since the July
28th FDA announcement on lowering nicotine standards is attributable to the rampant
press releases (42 in 2017) and paid stock promotion hyping commoditized technology
that sophisticated industry partners have deemed worthless and walked away from.
With a long history of previous hyped product failures, we believe XXII has 75%
downside to where it currently trades. Our valuation is mostly attributable to cash on the
balance sheet which we believe will be squandered by a management team reported for
"corporate governance concerns" by the recently departed CEO (himself the recipient of
SEC and FTC sanctions).


The company has spun the narrative that "22nd Century is the only company in the
world capable of growing tobacco with non-addictive levels of nicotine" - (Source). We
will show you this is far from the truth and prove to you that this is likely nothing more
than another paid stock promotion that will crumble under shareholder dilution.


Our analysis of 22nd Century will focus on three realities that you won't find in its press
releases.


Dismantling the hype of 22nd Century's "Technology" -1.
In reality XXII is the only tobacco company that can't publicly market and sell a low
nicotine tobacco product in the USA right now.

.


Removing nicotine from tobacco is not new or novel; in fact it was first discovered
in the 1930s! Multiple major tobacco companies have 2-5 times more patents than
XXII in the low-nicotine space (XXII has <1% of the patents).

British American Tobacco (BTI) (BAT) put a nail in XXII's coffin by deciding that
XXII patent portfolio isn't even worth $3 million!

.


The only two product hopes for XXII have already FAILED: Brand A cigarettes
FAILED in December 2016 to get their FDA Modified Risk Tobacco Product
(MRTP) designation; and X-22 FAILED phase IIb trials back in 2012. Neither
product even currently has new applications/research studies pending.


5
.


XXII's Horrible Fundamentals - Great businesses are not usually reverse mergers
of OTC mining companies run out of dentist office that give away free stock with
every pack of cigarettes sold - it turns out XXII is not an exception to this rule.


6.


NEGATIVE GROSS MARGINS - 22nd Century generates $0.93 of revenue for
every $1.00 of product costs…a terrible business model.


7

LESS than 2% of the company's revenue comes from low nicotine tobacco (and
that revenue is declining!).

Where does the revenue come from then? - 98.5% of revenue from selling the
highest nicotine cigarettes in the USA (Red Sun) and third-party normal cigars and
cigarettes.

The Technology - Cutting through the 22nd Century Smoke Screen


Patent Portfolio Evaluation - 22nd Century has Less than 1% of the
Patents!


. Bankers (Chardan), investor relations (IRTH), and auditors (Freed Maxick) all
have a very checkered past where investors have gotten fleeced.


1
9
.


The bull case that 22nd Century sells to investors that if/when the FDA lowers nicotine
standards that only it can produce low nicotine tobacco. This is the false premise touted
via paid promotions and press releases at the core of the 200+% run-up (Examples
here, here (free login required), and here).


The facts in this article will prove the bull case to be false.


The first nicotine reduction patents were granted in the 1930s! So nicotine reduction is
by no means a new technology. Nicotine Free Tobacco was actually created in 1931 by
the Austrian government and in 1933 a patent was granted for reducing nicotine content
of tobacco to Hall Tobacco Chemical Co.


In fact, researchers have been breeding and growing low-nicotine tobacco since the
1940s! (WD Valleau paper on Breeding Low-Nicotine Tobacco - published 1948). So
much for the idea that every tobacco company will be forced to buy from XXII.

So How Much is 22nd Century's Patent Portfolio Worth?


If somehow you still think that low nicotine cigarettes are a novel idea that only XXII can
produce, we suggest you check out the Google patent database for "reduced nicotine
cigarettes" (search here). There are 6,366 relevant patents. The most relevant
assignees are RJ Reynolds (5.7% of patents), Philip Morris (PM) (2.2%), BAT (1.1%),
Duke (1.1%), and finally in a distant fifth is North Carolina State (0.9%) (XXII licenses
most of its patents from NCSU).


LESS than $3 MILLION!


Independent major tobacco company British American Tobacco let its partnership with
XXII expire when it would only cost $3 million in license fees over the next two years to
have exclusivity over the commercialization of XXII's patent portfolio. The smartest
tobacco investors in the world just decided that XXII's "tech" is worth less than a $3m
call option.

Why is this important?

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1347858/000114420417013462/v458211_10k.htm
BAT is the perfect insider. It has been a partner with XXII for four years. It should have
followed all the progress of the "technology" and patents from a first-hand perspective. It
also set four separate major milestones with XXII and so far it has seen ZERO of four
milestones be achieved in the four-year period. BAT has firsthand knowledge of all the
research studies, insight into the whole technological landscape, regulatory
environment, etc. and had already invested $7m into a development partnership with
XXII. It probably decided that it wasn't worth throwing good money after bad and that the
call option wasn't worth it. This happened after the FDA low-nicotine announcement too.


$3 million would have been a pittance for BAT too. It spent >$170 million on R&D in
2016 alone (along with Reynolds which it recently acquired).


The importance of the BAT deal is shown in the analysis by 22nd Century's sole
banker/sell-side analyst at Chardan. Its own analysis valued the BAT potential royalty
stream at $1.00 per share. Oops, now that is worth $0.


Independent tobacco industry expert David Sweanor sums up the situation better than
we could in this article:


But it looks like a company (BAT) that understands the tobacco market perhaps better
than any other entity on the planet sees little likelihood of, or viability in, measures to
force nicotine levels in cigarettes to a non-psychoactive level... As for 22nd Century,
he said, "It sounds more like a groom abandoned at the altar turning to the
wedding guests and announcing that this is a great development as he is now
available to anyone there looking for a date."


- David Sweanor


It's helpful to revisit the promotional press releases from 2013 when the partnership with
BAT was first announced to get context. Then the CEO's commentary was:


This partnership with British American Tobacco, which sells product in approximately
180 countries, represents 22nd Century's greatest growth milestone to date and an
important step in the development of 22nd Century's next generation tobacco
products. BAT has always been our first choice as a partner, stated Joseph
Pandolfino, 22nd Century's Founder and Chief Executive Officer.

Evaluating the Technology - Can Anyone Else Make Reduced Tobacco
Cigarettes?


In BAT's words:


"We have notified (22nd Century) that we will be bringing this agreement to an end as
we believe we have more beneficial options available to us going forward."


Yes, there are lots of competitors already selling products.


What 22nd Century management doesn't want you to know is that not only can other
competitors make cigarettes that have 0.1mg or less of nicotine, but competitors have
actually been doing so since the 1980s!


In 1984, there were 159 cigarette brands that met that low nicotine standard
according to this NY Times article.


We suggest investors read this article by Dr. Robert Proctor, a Stanford Professor, to
better understand FDA's proposal - FDA's new plan to reduce the nicotine in cigarettes
to sub-addictive levels could be a game-changer. Essentially it says:


Eliminating nicotine from tobacco is easy.


Philip Morris tried to do it in the '80s and '90s but people smoked less.


Nicotine levels could easily be reduced to 0.1% or 0.2%.


The FDA proposal while a good one might take a long time to implement, "FDA
describes it as a multi-year plan."


In fact, if you want to go out and buy low nicotine cigarettes today. Here is a list of the
most popular brands with low tar or nicotine. You'll find a lot of familiar names, but there
is one very key one missing - 22nd Century.


Camel One (0.1mg nicotine - owned by Reynolds American - now BAT)


Click & Roll by Lucky Strike (0.5mg nicotine - owned BAT)


Davidoff One (0.1mg nicotine & 1mg tar - Imperial Tobacco (OTCQX:IMBBY))


Dunhill Fine Cut (0.1mg nicotine & 1mg tar - BAT)

FAILED Products that 22nd Century is still hyping.


Marlboro Filter Plus One (0.1mg nicotine & 1mg tar - Altria (MO))


Pall Mall Super Slims Silver 100s (0.1mg nicotine & 1mg tar - R.J. Reynolds)


Winston White (0.1mg nicotine & 1mg tar - Imperial Tobacco & Japan Tobacco
(OTCPK:JAPAY))


Now 100s (0.05mg nicotine - R.J. Reynolds)


Cambridge Filters (0.05mg nicotine - Philip Morris)


Why is 22nd Century not on the list? 22nd Century does not even have commercially
available low nicotine cigarettes in the US. The only customer for its Spectrum low
nicotine cigarettes has been as a sub-contractor for RTI International which in turn has a
contract with the government (National Institute on Drug Abuse).


The saddest part is that the two hopes for 22nd Century future revenue are Brand A
Cigarettes and X-22, and both have already failed. Brand A's MRTP application was
withdrawn after one year with the FDA in December 2016 and X-22 failed Phase II-B
clinical trials back in 2012.


Brand A


Brand A is a low nicotine cigarette with 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes.


The hype to investors is the idea that XXII can get Modified Risk Tobacco Product
(MRTP) designation. Then somehow that designation (despite having no known brand)
will help it gain a significant portion of the tobacco market.


Unfortunately, 22nd Century has already attempted to get a MRTP designation and it
failed. The company was forced to withdraw its application (2016 10-K - pg 8):

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/30/47539163-15173092013728_origin.png
In fact, 22nd Century currently does not have any MRTP applications under scientific
review. See FDA list here.


This week an FDA panel voted against Philip Morris's iQOS system receiving MRTP
status (link). This heat not burn system reportedly exposed consumers to lower levels of
harmful chemicals, and they did not receive MRTP status. 22nd Century's Brand A
cigarettes have just as much tar and cancerogen substance as normal cigarettes, only
less nicotine. So if a product that has less chemicals just got denied, does XXII have
any chance? We think not. But again this is moot point since it doesn't even have MRTP
application under scientific review.


X-22: (prescription low nicotine cigarettes to stop smoking)


During the summer, 22nd Century restarted the narrative around its X-22 product (Press
Release). The company even highlights the fact that it had a "productive meeting" with
the FDA to try to re-ignite investors' hopes. What it conveniently omitted and is hoping
that investors have forgotten is that this very same product has already failed Phase II-B
clinical trials, and that happened five years ago!

A Fundamental Disaster! - Some Important Questions for Every Investor
to Answer.


Does the business have good margins & do they improve as the company scales?


NO!


22nd Century manages to have NEGATIVE gross margins. For every $0.93 of revenue it
generates, it has $1.00 of product costs and that is before the company factors in
SG&A, marketing, research & development. This type of business model is destined to
fail. The company is currently burning >$12 million in cash a year and has no product,
licensing agreements, or other fundamental way to stop the bleeding.


Are "Low Nicotine Cigarettes" a major source of revenue?


NO!


If you only read XXII 42 press releases you would think that its Spectrum (Brand A) Low
Nicotine Cigarettes have been a huge growth driver, but in fact they are a meaningless
source of revenue (1.5%).


Have sales of "Low Nicotine Cigarettes" been increasing?


NO! The sales of Spectrum cigarettes declined in 2017
So where are the actual revenues?


Spectrum cigarettes have made up less than 3% of revenue since 2015 and both
Spectrum revenue and sticks ordered per year has been constantly declining since
2011.


(Sources for charts - SEC Filings - 2012-2016 10-Ks, Q3-17 10-Q)


The majority of revenue comes from three sources:


Red Sun Cigarettes (The Highest Nicotine Cigarette on the Market)


Magic Cigarettes in Europe



https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001347858&type=10-k&dateb=&owner=exclude&count=40

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1347858/000114420417057726/tv477854_10q.htm
Private Label Normal Cigarettes & Cigars


That's right, 98% of the revenue actually come from Red Sun and Private Label
cigarettes & cigars (We assume Magic sales are de minimis since the company focused
all marketing & sales efforts on Red Sun since 2015 - pg 11 of 2016, 10-K). Magic
cigarettes were also listed for false advertising in the 2000 FTC consent order listed
earlier.


The most interesting fact about Red Sun is that it claims to be the HIGHEST Nicotine
Cigarette on the US Market.


Don't believe us. Below is Red Sun's advertising previously captured from its own
website.


Red Sun - "America's Highest Nicotine Tobacco!"


& "Nicotine, More is Better"

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/30/47539163-1517309202255941_origin.png
XXII History - Red Flags Galore - Why we believe investors should doubt
everything 22nd Century Management says!


To XXII's management's credit, in November 2017, it recently decided to close down the
Red Sun brand since it was would not be in line with any future FDA mandate. However,
we suspect this was the only positive gross margin product in its portfolio. Thus, future
gross margins should be even worse. Also, 22nd Century decided to announce that it
was closing down the Red Sun Brand and that those sales will be going away after
market close the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Seems like for once it was trying to
bury a press release.


Private Label - Continuing with 22nd Century's fundamental disaster, the private label
cigarette and cigar deal is a horrible deal. 22nd Century agreed to produce cigarettes
and cigars for Smoker Friendly International for break-even/negative gross margins (in
22nd Century words "just enough to cover overhead costs") in exchange for getting
distribution for Red Sun Cigarettes (Extreme Nicotine Cigarettes) in Smoker Friendly
Locations (press release here).


So in exchange for distribution for Red Sun (a brand it recently shuttered) 22nd Century
has agreed to give away cigarettes and cigars for cost/below cost. No wonder revenue
has finally started growing for it. It is giving cigarettes and cigars away for below cost.

Reverse Merger - 22nd Century came public in 2011 the way that all great short
opportunities enter the public markets - by reverse merging with a mining company
(Touchstone Mining Ltd. in 2011 - Pg 4; 2016-10K). This in and of itself doesn't mean
that 22nd Century is horrible investment and a great short opportunity, but we have
never found a reverse merger into a mining company that isn't.


Former CEO & Founder, Joe Pandolfino, was charged with share price
manipulation by the SEC! The SEC charged former CEO and 22nd Century Founder
Joseph Pandolfino, Jr. in 1992 with share price manipulation and Joseph agreed to
disgorge his profits and never mail anonymous letters with false information to pump
stocks again.


Washington Post Story summarizing SEC case against Joe Pandolfino.


FTC Complaint and Consent Order Against Joe Pandolfino & Alternative
Cigarettes (related party to 22nd Century that transferred assets to 22nd Century) FOR
FALSE ADVERTISING!


The 2000 FTC complaint is regarding advertising for its cigarette brands with false
statements purporting that its cigarettes were healthier for you…any of this starting to
sound familiar.

Free Stock Giveaway & Paid Stock Promotion:


Concerns over Corporate Governance - Joe Pandolfino, the founder who was
charged by SEC with share price manipulation and has an FTC violation is concerned
about the company's corporate governance! He raised these concerns in his lawsuit
(Pandolfino vs. 22nd Century NYSCEF: Index No 802706/2015).


XXII treats its stock as though it's the free toy in a Cracker Jack box.


A new red flag indicator to us is a company being so desperate for sales that it actually
gave away shares of stock for sales. In XXII's case, it gave away $3 of free stock for
the purchase of cartons of cigarettes. Investors should note that it was diluting investors
to increase sales of its Red Sun Product which has HIGHER nicotine than any other
cigarette. As a reminder, the Red Sun slogan is "Extremely Nicotine"

Partial list of the Paid Stock Promotions:


"2015 Trade Partners Program - We will issue you stock in our publicly traded
company… ABSOLUTELY FREE!"


"For each & every carton of RED SUN you buy in 2015, you will earn $3.00 worth of
XXII Stock!"


Paid stock promotion is commonplace in penny stocks similar to XXII and is a great
indicator of good short candidates. Why? We believe legitimate companies do not
pay stock promoters!
Stock promotion messages publically captured regarding XXII are available on
StockPromoters.com here and on HotStocked.com here.


Headquartered in a dentist office - If SEC violations, FTC consent orders against false
advertising, and paid stock promotions have not already made you sell shares in XXII,
we suggest that investors take a visit to the headquarters of this $500m company.


Taking a trip on Google maps to XXII's headquarters at 9530 Main Street in Clarence,
New York, you won't find what you expect for the HQ of a half a billion company that
claims it has a technological advantage over the whole tobacco industry.


Instead you find a small office shared with a local dentist! Dr. Carmine Tiso DDS,
and ironically, the dentist is the only profitable business at this address.

Insiders & Major Institutional Shareholders Selling!


The Dentist's office website confirms that the dentist office is still at the same address as
XXII's headquarters.


XXII has a low institutional ownership to begin with <25%, but when a large institutional
holders, Empery Asset Management, which recently held ~13% of the company (in
stock and warrants) sells 99.9% of its common stock (according to this filing and
Bloomberg) and files to liquidate an additional 91.5% of its warrants (see prospectus) it's
a strong sell signal investors should pay attention to. It's a sign to run, not walk away,
from a stock.


The company recently filed for institutional investors that had just invested in June 2017
to sell 11,293,211 shares (Prospectus is here). The soonest they could sell was six
months after the deal, and they did exactly that (sell almost everything!).

Who is looking out for shareholders?


Joseph Pandolfino, the company's founder, former CEO, and formerly charged stock
manipulator by the SEC, is even selling stock.


A recent updated 13D filing from July 24, 2017, has him selling 682,828 shares of
common stock in the open market for total proceeds of approximately $1,186,000 and at
an average price per share of approximately $1.74. So as recent as three months ago,
the person who knows the company best was selling at prices >50% below today's.


The VP of R&D, Michael Moynihan, is also taking advantage of the hyped stock price to
sell:


Selling 29.5k shares on 7/31/17 (link)


Selling 50k shares on 9/29/17 (link)


Red Flag - Involvement of Chardan Capital Markets (bankers), IRTH
Communications (investor relations) & Freed Maxick (an unknown auditor):



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/1/47539163-15174770561498606_origin.png

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1347858/000114036117036994/xslF345X03/doc1.xml
Companies can often be judged by the quality of the firms they hire. In this case, XXII
has chosen third-rate investment bankers (Chardan), an IR firm associated with paid
stock promotions (IRTH Communications) and an unknown auditor, Freed Maxick
(median market cap of public company they audit is $30m). In our opinion, three brands
you will only associate with if there are no better options available.


Chardan's claim to fame is having been one the main facilitator for bringing a multitude
of now delisted Chinese reverse mergers and SPACs public. If this is news to you,
below is a partial list of its past SPAC/RTO failures. Or check out its Nasdaq consent
letter for violating market making rules.


Performance of some past Chardan deals:


SEED (-95%)


APWR (Delisted, -100%)


FUQI (Delisted, -100%)


CABLF (Delisted, -100%)


DJSP (-99.99%)



https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/marketregulation/NASDAQ/DisciplinaryActions/CHDN_NQ_2015.pdf
LIWA (-99.99%)


AAMA (Delisted, -100%)


KGJI (-85%)


CAVO (Delisted, -100%)


CBBD (-99.99%)


CNWHF (-99.99%)


SGOC (-96%)


You will quickly see a common pattern of all Chardan Capital Markets' deals. The
company spikes on promotional press releases, crashes by 75-90% to either be delisted
or trade at <$10m mkt cap.


XXII has hired IRTH Communications as its investor relations. IRTH's recent claim to
fame is due to two of its clients receiving inquiries from OTC Markets regarding stock
promotion. Just last week IRTH client Wheaton Income (OTCQX:CBWTF) declared in its
response to an OTC stock promotion inquiry that IRTH was running stock promotions
without its knowledge and which included "potentially exaggerated or misleading
statements contained in the materials" (link to statement).


"After due inquiry the Company believes the promotional material to have been
distributed by IRTH Communications, LLC ('IRTH'), an independent third-party
investor relations and consulting firm, without the consent or knowledge of the
Company."


Another IRTH client MassRoots (OTCPK:MSRT) also received an OTC stock promotion
inquiry in July 2017 (link). From the MassRoots case, we can see that IRTH utilized
Sunrise Media as an intermediary to mask direct payments to third parties like Small
Cap IR which directly promoted the stock. Unsurprisingly, both Sunrise Media and Small
Cap IR have been extensively involved in XXII paid stock promotions too (see paid
promo chart above).

Extreme Dilution:


Hiring a completely unknown auditor is always a big red flag. So of course XXII has
made sure to sign one up - Freed Maxick CPAs. We had never heard of Freed Maxick
(before digging deep into XXII) but not surprisingly Freed Maxick Battaglia (predecessor
company) was sued for assisting a company Student Finance Corp. (SFC) in conspiring
to conceal its bad loans (Royal Indemnity Co. vs. Freed Maxick & Battaglia, et al -
Delaware C.A. No. 05-165-JJF).


But to Freed Maxick's credit, it was still able to point out material weaknesses in 22nd
Century's internal controls in the 2015 10-K.


22nd Century clearly is not in the business of making profits or cash flow, but its seven-
year history shows it is outstanding at issuing new shares and warrants at very dilutive
prices. The share count has exploded by >6x since its reverse merger from ~20 million
shares to now 123 million (134m including warrants). Investors should note that all of
the sales over the last year have taken place at prices significantly lower than today's
price today too.


Below are examples (Pg 12 and 13 of 10-Q) of recent sweat-heart deals that it has
given only to institutional investors. Oh, and these are the same institutional investors
that recently registered to sell all their shares in XXII in December of 2017.


Feb. 2016 - 5 million shares $1.10 per share with 50% warrant coverage at $1.21


July 2016 - 6.2m shares at $0.81 with 7m warrants at $1.00

Valuation:


Oct. 2016 - 8.5m shares sold for $1.34 with 50% warrant coverage at $1.45


June 2017 - 7m shares at $1.00 per share with 60% warrant coverage at $1.45


Oct. 2017 - 20.6m shares at $2.625 (25% below the previous day closing price)


Even if investors apply the incredibly generous 3x sales that American Spirit got when
Reynolds initially bought it; a $2.9 million valuation for the patent portfolio that BAT
wouldn't pay $3m for, book value for the Anandia Hemp investment (growing THC free
Hemp - another failed product), we come up with a price estimate of $0.82 or 76%
downside to the current price.

XXII is a misleading story stock. XXII has capitalized FDA's desire to regulate the
nicotine requirements in tobacco to pretend that it is the only company that can do this.
In reality, it is the only tobacco company that currently cannot market and sell a low
nicotine cigarette. Technology to remove nicotine from cigarettes has been around since
the 1930s, so everyone has it. The story of 22nd century is a misleading story
predicated on false information and hope for products that are not only unlikely to be
approved but have actually already been denied by the FDA for MRTP status or have
failed Phase II-b studies!


Instead it is a story of how a retail investor can lose his life savings by trusting paid stock
promoters, third-rate bankers and auditors, and a management team that is touting
failed products. This is what happens when you buy into a reverse-merger that is run out
of an office space shared with a dentist.


XXII is only good at selling three things:


Hype


Private label cigarettes and cigars at negative gross margins


And its own stock (normally with lots of free warrants)


We are Short XXII. It has > 75% downside.
