USEC Inc. - Stock Price Disconnected From Reality
Jul. 2, 2014 11:09 AM ET31 comments
by: The Emperor Has No Clothes


Summary


USU’s stock is up from $3.03 on June 30, 2014 to $11.11 per share – a gain of more
than 250% with no change in fundamentals.


There has been no news – in fact the company declined to comment on any market
activity – something I believe is unfair to any buyers of the stock.


Most value of the reorganized entity is expected to accrue to convertible note
holders.


USU is in the midst of a chapter 11 bankruptcy which will be tied up by the end of
September.


Post reorganization, with convertible note holders taking the lion's share of value,
equity holders will be left with less than 5% of the current trading value of the stock.


Introduction | Up more than 250% on no news


USEC Inc. (NYSE:USU) popped up on my radar today. As background, I have limited prior
understanding of the uranium space or of USU the company, but I do have some
knowledge of how bankruptcies work. In such cases, debt holders more often than not
walk away with the lion's share of the value that remains. Based on simple math, with
holders of equity retaining less than 5% of the company in a proposed plan, the drop in
share price is unavoidable.


The stock is up more than 250% on news released over the weekend whereby USU will
receive an additional $2.5 million of funds through its ACTDO agreement. From some
quick work, USU needs an incremental $4 billion to complete its critical American
Centrifuge Project and as such, $2.5 million does little to assist with this project. When
considering the company's upcoming bankruptcy, $2.5 million moves the needle very little
in context of refinancing the $530 million of bonds outstanding. It is my view that the
recent appreciation in the stock is backed by misplaced excitement and that the stock will
revert to fundamental valuation in no time. Other than this, nothing has changed with the
stock or the company in the past few days.

From my read, the completion of the bankruptcy based on latest filings should happen
within two to three months. I note that there is a disclosure statement hearing on Monday,
which is a key step in the bankruptcy process. In my opinion, USU equity holders are
going to see their stock plummet 95% and this checks out based on simple math that I
provide below.


USEC Inc. | A quick background


USU "supplies low enriched uranium to commercial utilities for use in nuclear reactors
worldwide. Low enriched uranium is a key component of the fuel used by nuclear power
plants to generate electricity." Most of the work conducted is done for the US Department
of Energy. The key upside with USU circles around the American Centrifuge Project
("ACP") which "is an advanced US gas centrifuge uranium enrichment technology for
fueling commercial nuclear power plants in the United States and around the world." This
project is expected to cost $9 billion over the course of its life ($5 billion of sunk costs plus
$4 billion which is needed to push the project through completion) USU has entered
bankruptcy due to its inability to repay or refinance its current outstanding bonds of $530
million and its inability to push forward the ACP or fund its completion.


The company first hinted at a bankruptcy almost 2 years ago on November 1, 2012
"We've indicated that we expect to pursue discussions with several key stakeholders
regarding ways to improve the capital structure. Currently, we're working with advisors and
developing options for a possible restructuring of our balance sheet and how to address
our very key liabilities."


Significant Indebtedness put the company into bankruptcy


With $530 million of outstanding debt that has been defaulted on, the company entered a
formal chapter 11 bankruptcy process on March 5, 2014. Its bonds are currently trading at
28 cents on the dollar.


As is detailed in its announcement of a definitive agreement on March 5, 2014, in the best
case "holders of the Company's common stock will receive, on a pro rata basis, 5% of the
New Common Stock, subject to dilution on account of a new management incentive plan."
Receiving 5% of reorganized equity compares with 79% of the new equity to be received
by holders of the convertible notes. Based on current trading value of $54 million ($11.11
per share at 4.9 million shares outstanding), the implied valuation of the company is
roughly $1.1 billion ($54 million / 5%). I also note that the convertible notes' trading value
has not changed in the last few days.

This link provides a detailed overview of the plan in a disclosure statement, which is slated
to be approved by the bankruptcy court this coming Monday, July 7, 2014.


Equity holders to be left with almost nothing


As previously noted with a bankruptcy, the debt holders will end up owning most of the
company. As such, holders of the debentures will attain $200 million in new notes along
with 79% of the reorganized equity.


I stumbled across this article, which does a great job of laying out the math on what equity
holders will be left with. To start, it provides a succinct illustration of the distribution of
value post reorganization:


Next, it lays out the math, which suggests that as of February 22, 2014, equity's remaining
fundamental valuation is $0.59 / share. Here is the updated math based on my
calculations:

This effectively says if the current bond pricing is an indication of the value of the company
that implies that the new enterprise value will be $148 million ($530 million x 28 cents on
the dollar). If the new bonds trade at 60 cents on the dollar, which I deem to be low, that
would leave $36 million of value for the entire amount of the new equity ($148 million less
60 cents multiplied by $200 million new bonds divided by 79%). If current equity holders
are going to get 5% of this, that will leave them with a 97% loss on their current
investment ($2 million is what they will receive which is 5% of the $36 million and the
current equity is valued at 4.9 million shares multiplied by $11.11/share meaning $54M).


Timeline | Bankruptcy in the next two to three months


The disclosure statement hearing will take place on July 7, 2014. The voting period will
open up five days after that and be open for 30 days. Confirmation is often imminent after
this point but can take up to a week or two. This is all aligned with management guidance
of a bankruptcy by the end of summer or by September 18, 2014. Recall that the bonds
are due on October 1, 2014.


Conclusion | Irrational


With bankruptcy expected to be all but sewn up by the time the $530 million bonds are
due on October 1, 2014, the drop in equity value is expected in short order.


So essentially the value attributable to the common stock will be all but eliminated
in the next 2-3 months. It is unfortunate that the company has not made a clear
statement about this and retail shareholders and others, have bought stock in the
company (with 20 million shares traded), and stand to lose a significant amount of
money.

Before you short it: 
How many of the outstanding float is already borrowed to short? 
What is the RATE you are paying to short it? 
Some of the most popular shorts you can pay 50% - 80% p.a.!!! Which means that you have to be
ABSOLUTELY right both on price AND on time, AND keep your fingers crossed that the short will not be
called... 
I.e.: Shorting is not a theoretical mouse click. There are rascally cats at the other side who would gladly take
your money if you don't know what you are doing. 
This stock is rising most probably NOT because of insane day-traders, but because careless short sellers
shorted it, are now paying 80% interest, and so rush to cover-- only to find that no stock is available... 
It had happened once before to this stock-- but short-sellers' memories are apparently short...

Take a look at the May operating report filed with the bankruptcy court. It shows that the non-filing subsidiaries earned
$8.1 million during May. Consider what that might mean in the context of the Company's long-term strategy.


Usec has invested billions in the American Centrifuge Project, most of which has been expensed. At $10 per share for
the common, or roughly a market capitalization of $50 million, the share price may or may not be disconnected from
reality.


Disclosure: I own none of the common shares at this time, though I do own some of the Company's debt.

The government will not let USEC fail. It is truly too important to fail. Just think of it as another government-sponsored
corporation like FNMA, FRE, GM, GE, GS, JPM, WFC, C, BCS, DB, CS, or BAC. It may forever 'restructure' but the
government will ensure that it keeps tickin'. Unlike the above GSEs, Bernanke & now Yellen won't print for USEC and
buy its debt for $1 per $0.001, or manufacture opaque 'swaps', but the government will backstop it.

Wally, maybe you better buy the bonds, even if you can't short the common.


03 Jul 2014, 08:42 AM


Blu H
Well if equity is truly "worthless", then current common wouldn't be getting 5% in the new equity structure
now, would it? There would be no claim for current common at all in the new structure, unless equity does
have value. Problem here is that you all have it wrong - it isn't the common shares that are mispriced, it is the
bonds. They are worth a lot more than they are trading. You are all doing your analysis off the trading values
of the debt, and the debt is massively mispriced and undervalued.

Let's see...this up to the eyeballs in debt uranium company teetering on the edge of BK just added roughly $40M in
market cap because of $2.5M in new funding. No other news outside of that.


Coincidentally there was a similar PUMP & DUMP in July 2013 where it went from the $3's to over $29 then back to
the $3's.


02 Jul 2014, 09:52 PM


Blu H
Another comment which shows a lack of understanding. The additional funding is important, because it plays
into the ability of the company to obtain additional funding and better terms going forward. The whole point of
the debt to equity swap is not to try to redivide existing value, it is to create value by stabilizing the company
and thereby obtaining significant additional funding to get things moving again. That funding will not come
until the capital structure is sorted out. So to the extent that the company can get additional funding and the
company has a viable capital structure reorg in place, then this is news, it is good, and it makes current
common shares much more valuable.

I don't think $2.5 million in funding is anything worth bragging about for a billion dollar project

"No other news outside of that."


Maybe you should go back and read the May operating report more carefully?


How did those non-filing subs do during the month?


03 Jul 2014, 08:46 AM


Acacia Capital Management, Contributor
Regardless of the performance in the May MOR, there is a massive implied value differential between the bonds and
the stock. The author's conclusion is correct, but it's too hard to short this stock and it is prone to massive squeezes.
Look at the squeeze that occurred after the reverse stock split.

"Massive Implied Value Differential"


Your presumption assumes the market is efficient and that the data upon which you are relying has accounted
for every fact driving the market's pricing of the common stock and bonds. Could you please elaborate or
clarify? Thanks.


14 Jul 2014, 01:39 PM


Blu H
The author's conclusion is incorrect. His analysis is erroneous. His basing of an "implied reorg value of equity"
on the differential in bond values is in error. There is a disconnect here because it is the traded bond prices
which are mispriced, NOT the traded common shares value.


14 Jul 2014, 06:00 PM


EconoAlpha
I agree with you, in part, about prices. Pricing for bonds AND common stock have ongoing deviated from
natural price because of lag in timeliness of information and transparency. Perhaps many of the posters,
especially those that tried to short, overlooked or are oblivious to the very important information about this
stock that is available to the public but is likely NOT going to be found on an investment forum. This apple
does not have another apple to which it can be compared. Within this apple is an orange.


On that note, at least we can continue to agree USU is going through changes and observe market behavior.

Indeed, this is a unique time for the company's share price. However, shorting USU appears to be a fundamentally
awful idea after my review of this special situation. I am LONG on the many actionable return factors. Apparently
these 'sellers' of 'short ideas' have discarded and/or overlooked the opportunity that others have been able to identify.


Disclosure: I am long and overweight on USU.

Valuemonster
Very sloppy analysis. I also believe VERY incorrect on an enterprise value basis? Where is your line item for
optionality on uranium and POTENTIAL for future profitability? Obviously Given that you are short (& properly disclose
it) says a lot. 20M shares is the reverse-split total. Coming out of bankruptcy, 5% of an enterprise value (minus
adjusted debt) of $100M seems awefully low, and that would put the new equity at 2x your most pessimistic scenario.
Seems to me the market is not valuing the BENEFITS of a bankruptcy -- relatively clean balance sheet, the potential
that fracking may not be all it is cracked up to be, Germany for all its bluster rejecting fracking and still relying on
nuclear energy, Japan starting to turn things around and re-fire their plants, et. al. I have made decent coin on many
uranium producers. I think the market is UNDER-valuing USU below $5, but that is what markets are for........We will
all know shortly. Long and stong USU at prices under $5. Great luck to all.............

VOA: Japanese Nuclear Plant Gets Preliminary Approval to Restart


Japan’s nuclear regulator says two reactors at a nuclear power plant shut down in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear
plant meltdown three years ago are safe enough to switch back on.


Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority has approved safety upgrades at Kyushu Electric Power's Sendai power plant,
located on the southern tip of Japan's Kyushu island. The plant would become the first of Japan's nuclear plants to
restart under stricter standards.


Regulators say the plant is now capable of avoiding severe meltdowns like that of the Fukushima plant following an
earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Final approval to put the Sendai plant back into operation, if granted, will come only
after a 30-day public comment period ending in mid-August.


Japan switched off its nuclear reactors for maintenance after the Fukushima accident that crippled the plant and
exposed the surrounding area to radiation. Since then, Japanese citizens have faced higher energy prices as the
nation switched its dependence to fossil fuels. The change also caused trade deficits with Japan's energy partners.
