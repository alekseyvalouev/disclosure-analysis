Oct. 30, 2013 1:22 PM ET6 comments | Includes: Web.com…


IMPORTANT NOTE - IT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT WE MADE AN
ERROR ON THE A/R and ALLOWANCE ANALYSIS BY FAILING TO CATCH A NOTE
DISCLOSED IN THE 10Q. WE DID INDEED MISS THE DISCLOSURE AND HAVE
REMOVED THE SEGMENT FROM OUR BLOG. WE APOLOGIZE FOR FAILING TO
SEE THE NOTE IN WEB.COM'S 10Q. THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK
CORRECTING OUR MISTAKE.


(BEFORE READING ANY OF OUR OPINIONS BELOW, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO
DO YOUR OWN WORK TO EITHER VERIFY, OR PERHAPS DISAGREE, WITH OUR
ANALYSIS PRESENTED BELOW):


We believe that investors in Web.com (WWWW), as well as the promotional
analysts that have blindly endorsed Web.com's financial presentations, will
soon have no excuse other than negligence for continuing to support the story.
We believe that Web.com has misrepresented its growth rate, profitability, and
business momentum by using creative financial engineering and liberal pro-
forma reporting. We dissect several balance sheet items suggesting Web.com
is a stagnant business, and possibly even in decline. We look at insider sales
that inexplicably occurred less than 48 hours before a large convert offering
was announced. Further, we examine its new Feet-on-the-Street model, which
appears to be an imitation of ReachLocal's (NASDAQ:RLOC) model, producing
ARPU improvements with minimal economic benefit. Illustrating Web.com's
challenges, we discuss the Facebook page of its local Houston market, which
appears to be running well behind management's targets and lists client wins

whose websites do not appear to be registered or designed by Web.com. And
finally, we will debunk the argument that Web.com has produced meaningful
economic cash flow from operations.


Until very recently, Web.com has managed to escape intense scrutiny. Its short
interest, net of arbed convert shares is negligible, while 10 of the 12 analysts
that cover it rate the stock a buy. In recent weeks, two articles appeared in
Seeking Alpha that did a commendable job highlighting some of the financial
shenanigans and engineered earnings reports that have become a staple in the
Web.com investment case. Any Web.com investor should read the two
articles/reports to better understand the nature of the Web.com promote.
They can be found here:

promotion-story-ever-told


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1732372-web-com-no-spider-will-save-this-
web


The reports were insightful, so we will not be regurgitating the topics
discussed in those articles. Instead, we will focus on several facets of the
Web.com story that have yet to be exposed. Based on the work we present
herein, we believe the Board of Directors, has ample evidence to investigate
how Web.com has been reporting adjusted earnings. Other balance sheet
metrics are completely incongruous with a growing company, but have been
masked by convoluted pro-forma reporting. The legacy Website Pros has
managed to morph into Web.com (through the roll-up of Register.com and
Network Solutions) receiving universal investor adoration. We believe that is
about to change.


Assuming our analysis proves correct, Web.com may soon find itself in a
regulatory pickle, with a stock price that is extremely overvalued. Applying a
generous free cash flow multiple inline with other slow growth TMT stocks, we
believe fair value is approximately $6.00 per share, or 80% lower than where
WWWW currently trades.


Deferred Revenue - Distorting the company's growth and profitability

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/2361592-web-com-group-wwww-no-witty-title-needed-with-business-inconsistencies


After Web.com acquired Register.com, it began to report pro-forma revenue
that added back a fair value adjustment to deferred revenues. Since the
Network Solutions acquisition, Web.com's adjusted financial statements have
been dominated by the extraordinary levels of 100% margin deferred revenue
add-backs. We will not spend a lot of time on the distortions the fair value
adjustments have caused (the Seeking Alpha articles do a fine job on this
topic), but a few paragraphs on the deferred revenue adjustments are
necessary.


Both Network Solutions and Register.com offered multi-year pre-payment
options to domain purchasers. GAAP accounting stipulates that a deferred
revenue liability is credited (cash debited) to reflect these pre-payments. The
deferred revenue balance translates into income statement revenue ratably
over the life of the pre-payment (amortized). When Web.com bought these
two businesses, it was required to adjust the deferred balances under
purchase accounting to reflect the fair value of the acquired deferred revenue.
As such, the acquired deferred revenue balance was adjusted lower when the
acquisitions closed. Web.com believes that adding back the deferred revenue
that was previously written down "helps management and investors better
understand revenue trends."[3]


To be clear, presenting fair value adjustments to deferred revenue is not
unique to Web.com. Many serial acquirers that rely on a roll-up strategy use
this technique. However, in the most recently completed fiscal year, Web.com
used twelve total adjustments to bridge its GAAP results to its pro-forma
tables. The most impactful adjustment has been adding back previously
written down deferred revenue, which has created a fictitious profitability
profile. Over the last eight quarters, the cumulative fair value adjustment to
deferred revenues has been $132.9 million. During that same period, Web.com
reported cumulative Non-GAAP Net Income of $151.5 million. Simply put,
using the adjusted results that management puts forth results in 88% of
Adjusted Net Income being attributable to cashless deferred revenue add-
backs from bookings that occurred at Network Solutions and Register.com
prior to being acquired. It is also worth noting Web.com adds back its tax
accruals, which means the adjusted net income is also an untaxed figure.

Deferred Expenses: The zero growth proof is in this pudding


We believe that Web.com is not growing. It is our belief, based on a plethora of
public filings, that Web.com may actually be experiencing declining organic
revenue. It is our opinion that management launched Feet-on-the-Street to
generate grossed-up revenue with very little associated margin to mask
declining organic revenue (more on this later). One very telling metric yet to
be discussed by analysts, bloggers, or especially Web.com management is that
prepaid registry expenses imply Web.com is not growing.


As discussed briefly in the last section, when Web.com receives an annual or
multi-year pre-payment, there is a deferred revenue liability created on the
balance sheet to reflect revenue that will be recognized in future quarters. The
cash is paid up-front and is reflected on the asset side of the ledger as "Cash
and cash equivalents." As the description implies, the deferred revenue liability
later flows through the income statement as revenue. However, there is also a
deferred cost asset called "prepaid registry fees." These prepaid fees represent
upfront cash paid by Web.com to third party registries.


Web.com is not a registry. Instead when they sell a domain, Web.com must
pay a registry like VeriSign a registration fee. Simplistically, Web.com could be
viewed as a middleman. VeriSign is the registry for .com and charged
approximately $7.85 for each .com registration in 2012. Further, ICANN
charges an $0.18 fee for each .com domain name registered in the generic top
level domain (gTLD) that falls within its purview.[4] These registration fees are
accounted for by Web.com in a similar manner to the deferred revenues.
Web.com pays the registry (like VeriSign) when it registers a domain. If the
domain is pre-paid for multiple periods, then a deferred asset is created (debit
"prepaid registry fees") to reflect the Web.com cash out (credit "cash"). The
deferred asset is then amortized ratably against the deferred revenues.

ww-2013331x10q.htm


The accounting is straight forward. For example, on January 1, assume
Customer XYZ buys a domain from Web.com for $20 and prepays for a full
year. Web.com subsequently pays the registry (VeriSign) $16 for the full year
up-front as well (these numbers are purely to illustrate the accounting). In this
example, Web.com would recognize $5 of revenue in Q1 and defer $15 of the
revenue (liability) to be recognized ratably. Web.com would also recognize $4
of costs to VeriSign, and defer $12 of costs (asset) to be recognized ratably
(matched against the deferred revenues). The $15 of deferred revenue would
be recognized ratably, as would the $12 of deferred costs, over the proceeding
three quarters.


Looking at the trend in deferred expenses, it appears Web.com has
misrepresented its growth rate through creative accounting, while the actual
organic growth rate of its domain registration business is zero. Web.com
discloses its customer counts each quarter as well as its ARPU. These figures
suggest a healthy grow rate. Its balance sheet does not support that story.
Deferred expenses, which again "primarily consist of prepaid domain name
registry fees that are paid in full at the time a domain name is registered",
have actually declined year-over-year for the last three quarters. IF WEB.COM
WERE ACTUALLY GROWING, THEN ITS PAYMENTS TO REGISTRIES (LIKE
VERISIGN) WOULD ALSO BE GROWING. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. As can be
seen below, the total deferred expenses have been declining. In the table
below, we included the deferred expenses of Demand Media to illustrate the
growth in its registrar business.

Demand Media owns eNom, which is the largest domain name wholesaler.
Unlike Web.com, Demand Media's deferred costs have consistently been
increasing year-over-year. Demand Media uses an accounting treatment for
prepayments that is identical to Web.com. We also checked with Tucows, a
smaller domain registrar, and found similar language in its 10K.[5] Below is
Demand Media's disclosure from its 10K.


Source - Demand Media 10K (2012)


Another disconnect is the inexplicable flat-line of Web.com's deferred costs
from Q4'11 to Q1'12, and Q4'12 to Q1'13. In January 2012, VeriSign raised
the .com domain price by 7%, from $7.34 to $7.85.[6] The .net domain price
was raised by 10% from $4.65 to $5.11. As can be seen from the previous
table, Demand Media's QoQ deferred expenses increased by 13% in Q1'12,
which was primarily attributable to the VeriSign price hike. Unlike Demand
Media, Web.com's deferred expenses only rose QoQ by 1% in Q1'12 despite
the 7% and 10% price hikes from VeriSign. Demand Media actually discussed
the price hikes in its 10K, highlighting the renewal rate changes set for 2013.


In terms of the extended registry agreement between ICANN and VeriSign that
was approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce on November 30, 2012,
VeriSign will continue as the exclusive registry for the .com gTLD through
November 30, 2018. The terms of the extension set a maximum price, with
certain exceptions, for registry services for each calendar year beginning
January 1, 2013 up to the smaller of the preceding year's maximum price or
the highest price charged during the preceding year, multiplied by 1.07


Demand Media's deferred expenses increased sequentially in Q1'13 by another
7%, while Web.com's deferred expenses actually declined. We have been
unable to find a logical explanation for this decline other than Web.com is not
growing. One potential explanation we explored was that large purchase
accounting adjustments could have been made when the acquisition of
Network Solutions closed. But the public filings make it clear this is not the
case. On page 23 of its third quarter 2011 10Q, Web.com disclosed a pro

forma consolidated condensed balance sheet.[7] This balance sheet clearly
disclosed that approximately 50% of deferred revenues were "lost" via
purchase accounting. Whereas the adjustments to prepaid registry fees were
negligible (the minor adjustments reflect future cost increases as required by
GAAP accounting). As such, the potential excuse related to carrying prepaid
fees at a higher market value is not applicable.

If Web.com were growing its core business, then the fees paid to VeriSign
would also be growing. This is not the case as evidenced by flat-to-declining
prepaid expenses, supporting our belief that Web.com's minimal "adjusted"
growth actually comes from accounting gimmicks.


Insider Sales - Potential violation of insider trading laws & lack of
Board oversight


It is also deeply concerning that Web.com's CEO and CFO sold substantial
percentages of their individual holdings hours before the $225M convert
offering was announced. On 8/6/13 and 8/7/13, Web.com's CEO sold 250,000
shares, representing 23% of his holdings. Not to be outdone, Web.com's CFO
also sold 100,000 shares, representing 31% of his holdings on 8/6/13 and
8/7/13.

Just one day following massive sales by its CEO and CFO, Web.com announced
a $225 million convert offering that caused the stock price to decline as much
as 8.5% at its lows.[8] We expect management and the Board to argue the
sales were part of a 10b5-1 plan. And of course these plans are intended to
protect management teams by allowing them to sell stock according to a pre-
established program, even during blackout windows. According to the Form 4
filings, Web.com's executive stock sales did occur under a 10b5 plan. However,
the fine print of the 10b5 plans for Mr. Brown (NYSE:CEO) and Mr. Carney

(NASDAQ:CFO) disclose that these plans were established on 6/7/13 (CEO)
and 6/13/13 (CFO). As such, the plans were established several weeks before
Web.com's quarter ended, around the time the quiet period would have
officially commenced. If the Board of Directors, or either the CEO or CFO, had
knowledge of the pending convertible issuance when the 10b-5 plans were
established, then the sales would represent poor judgment at best and insider
trading at worst. According to JD Supra Law News[9] and the SEC[10] (MNPI
stands for material non-public information):


Even if trading under a Rule 10b5-1 plan is set to begin after a specified point
in the future (e.g., 30 days from adoption), the plan will not protect against
potential liability if the insider is in possession of MNPI at the time the plan
is adopted - even if the MNPI will have become public before the
insider trades under the plan. (emphasis ours)


Feet-on-the-Street (FOTS) - Grossed up Revenue and the optics of
ARPU


Web.com management has adeptly shifted its story from synergies, to cross-
selling, to financial engineering, and now to ARPU increases. We believe the
future driver of ARPU increases carries minimal economic value and is simply a
function of low margin revenue being added to the business model. In 2012,
Web.com began to emphasize its FOTS roll-out, which consisted of staffing
eight initial cities with local sales people to sell small businesses Web.com
services. According to its 10K, "the sales initiative is focused on selling the
Leads by Web.com products and services."[11]


Management's optimism about its FOTS opportunity has been so contagious
that the sellside has focused much of its new bullish outlook on the future
success of this supposed novel offering. In fact, on its Q2'13 earnings call, the
majority of the Q&A was an exercise of analysts progressively getting more
excited than the next in their projections. The exuberance was not lost on
Web.com, with the CFO, Mr. Carney, refusing to back one excited analyst off of
his $40 million forecast for FOTS revenue in 2014[12]:


Nameless Sellside Analyst (buy rated): "Kevin, based on this Feet on the
Street, if you do a quick math and kind of the numbers you are giving out, I
am getting to like a $40 million annualized revenue number for 2014. Is that
generally in the ballpark?"

Kevin M. Carney: Okay. So I think on the Feet on the Street, I mean, I think
that - I can't comment, really, in terms of sort of breaking down revenue
contributions for the year. But I think the other things that you commented on
are accurate.


While the company has been very evasive quantifying the actual economics of
its launched cities, we believe that the primary driver for the strategy is to
simply deliver pass-through media campaigns that lead to chunky ARPU, yet
minimal profitability. Said another way, Web.com simply becomes an agent for
an SMB's marketing spend, which permits Web.com to run the campaign
spend through its income statement as revenue even though its economic
capture is a small mark-up on that revenue. But don't take our word for it, just
look at ReachLocal, a company widely considered to be one of the largest
existing FOTS models.


ReachLocal has been targeting local SMB's for years with direct sales people
that create advertising campaigns. These "feet-on-the-street" sales people are
referred to by ReachLocal as IMCs, or Internet Marketing Consultants. At the
end of 2012, ReachLocal had 824 IMCs in 60 markets. A closer look at
ReachLocal's business would appear to make it interchangeable with
Web.com's newest talking point - even down to its name. In ReachLocal's 2012
10K, the company states (emphasis ours), "We deliver these solutions to SMBs
through a combination of our proprietary platform, the RL Platform, and our
direct, "feet-on-the-street" sales force of Internet Marketing Consultants,
or IMCs." But the similarities of this comp to Web.com don't stop there, other
business model highlights for ReachLocal include[13]:


· We use our RL Platform to create advertising campaigns for SMBs to target
potential customers in their geographic area


· In 2010, we expanded the RL Platform to include ReachCast, our full-service
Web presence and social media solution, and in September 2012, we launched
ReachRetargeting, a ReachDisplay product targeting local consumers who have
recently searched for an SMB's business keywords as well as those who have
recently visited their website


· Empowered by the RL Platform, our IMCs, which are based in or near the
cities in which our clients operate, establish a direct consultative relationship
with our clients and provide our solutions to achieve their marketing objectives

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/2361592-web-com-group-wwww-no-witty-title-needed-with-business-inconsistencies


· We combine advanced, publisher-agnostic technology and an experienced,
digitally sophisticated direct sales force to provide SMBs with a single, easy to
use and cost-effective solution to acquire, maintain and retain customers using
digital media. Our target market is SMBs that spend at least $5,000 per year
on advertising.


· In our experience, our Direct Local clients, a substantial majority of which we
calculate spend from $500 to $4,000 per month, require face-to-face
interaction that is consistent with the way the SMB has historically purchased
offline media.


Compare the model descriptions below for ReachConvert with the description
of Leads by Web.com, which Web.com disclosed in its 10K is the primary
selling objective of its FOTS sales force. See some similarities?


· ReachConvert is a SaaS product that helps businesses manage their leads
and convert more of them into customers. ReachConvert notifies the business
of new leads in real time via text message, email or the ReachLocal mobile
app, so that the business can follow up within minutes.


· Leads by Web.com Leads by Web.com researches relevant keywords in the
customer's industry to create ads designed to bring traffic to the website.
When prospects search for a service, they are driven to a lead generation site
to request a quote, and then leads are delivered to the subscriber's computer
or phone for follow up.[14]


ReachLocal is publicly traded and should serve as an obvious comparison for
the FOTS opportunity at Web.com. However, almost all of the twelve analysts
that cover Web.com fail to even reference ReachLocal as a comp. Why? For
starters, there are 8 analysts that cover ReachLocal, all but one of whom is an
Internet analyst. Of these eight analysts, only one, Gene Munster at Piper
Jaffray, covers both ReachLocal and Web.com. JP Morgan actually covers both
stocks, but their Internet analyst covers ReachLocal, and for some inexplicable
reason a software analyst follows Web.com. But perhaps the more appropriate
reason is that the comparison reflects very poorly on Web.com. In 2012,
ReachLocal did $455 million of revenue, while Web.com generated $491
million. However, ReachLocal trades with a paltry EV/sales multiple of 0.6x,
while Web.com has managed to command a SAAS-like EV/sales multiple of
5/19/2018 Web.com Group (WWWW): No Witty Title Needed With Business Inconsistencies - Copperfield Research | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/2361592-web-com-group-wwww-no-witty-title-needed-with-business-inconsistencies


4.7x. Clearly, it is easier to compare Web.com to a different genre of
companies despite the obvious similarities between the two (on Web.com's
new focus area).


Aside from avoiding the obvious ReachLocal comparison for its FOTS
opportunity, we believe that the ARPU benefits are severely misunderstood.
Given the significantly higher ARPU that accompanies grossing-up an SMB's
online advertising budget, we believe the ARPU "story" is not only misleading,
but somewhat irrelevant when considering minimal margin benefit. However,
as we have highlighted, management has gone to great lengths to emphasize
the ARPU metric, despite the meaningless nature of the improvement. Mr.
Carney declared on the last earnings call, "We were pleased with our ARPU
performance during the quarter and expect ARPU to show continued sequential
growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, as the incremental marketing
investments we made in the first half of the year begin to fully impact the
business." Below we illustrate how easy it will be for Web.com to move the
ARPU needle with only a miniscule number of FOTS clients. If the salesforce
can simply add 2 new customers per month, based on the other metrics
management provided on its Q2'13 earnings call, we believe Web.com can
grow ARPU by 1.3% for a long time by simply growing its FOTS clients by just
0.02%.[15]

Finally, we would encourage any investor interested in the Web.com story and
its FOTS initiative to peruse the Facebook page of Web.com's Feet-on-the-
Street Houston market -


https://www.facebook.com/WebHouston


It currently lists client wins, which appear to be running well below the 5 -7
that management has outlined. Further, several of the listed client wins did not
even have websites registered, or even designed, by Web.com. If the Houston
market is representative of the other 15 cities, we believe the FOTS story may
be just that… a story.


The Myth - "But the Cash Flows"


The majority of the sellside analysts that cover Web.com are wildly bullish.
Currently twelve analysts follow Web.com, of which ten have buy ratings and
only two have hold ratings. Most of these analysts argue Web.com is cheap on
the basis of earnings, EBITDA, or cash flow. Any intellectually honest analyst
should immediately point out that Web.com's adjusted earnings are bogus. As
we illustrated on page 6, over the last eight quarters, 88% of Web.com's
"earnings" have come from non-cash adjustments to deferred revenue. This
adjustment is 100% margin. Further, Web.com does not include a tax rate in
its adjusted earnings. Nonetheless, if analysts actually included the net debt in
the "P", the untaxed P/E would still be over 20x based on a stock price of $30.
Using EBITDA is also a farce due to the 100% margin add-back of the deferred
revenues.


Cash flow would typically be a metric suitable for valuing a no-growth business
like Web.com. However, Web.com's operating cash flow is extremely
misleading. Very simply, Web.com's cash flows are nothing more than a
fractional return on the dilution and leverage that were utilized to buy those
cash flows in the first place. Think of it as paying one dollar to get twenty-five
cents.


Web.com spent approximately $730 million in 2010 and 2011 to buy
Register.com and Network Solutions. The purchases were financed with $535
million of cash AND issuing 18 million shares of dilutive equity. In both
transactions, the sellers were comprised of private equity groups that are not

exactly considered stupid sellers. What has been the economic benefit to
Web.com from spending $730 million? Based on the operating cash flow (prior
to capex) from 2010 through the first six months of 2013, Web.com has
generated $153 million of operating cash flow compare to the $730 million
purchase price.


Source - Company filings


As the table above clearly illustrates, $535 million dollars has been spent, in
addition to $189 million of equity, to buy two businesses that have thus far
only generated $153 million of operating cash flow. To convey the degree of
equity dilution, it is worth pointing out there were 26.6 million shares
outstanding in early 2010, prior to Web.com's first acquisition.[16] Based on
the company's full year 2013 guidance, the share count will have doubled to
53.2 million shares in a little over three years.


But don't expect a balanced perspective from the sellside - the conflicts are far
too great. Web.com has come to the equity and credit markets with nearly $1
billion of transactions in the last four years (including secondary offerings).
The most recent term debt refinancing (creating financially engineered "EPS
upside" for Q3'13) was another huge windfall for underwriters. It is no
coincidence that the majority of the underwriters for the debt deal also have
equity analysts that love Web.com's stock, including Citi (buy rating), Wells
Fargo (buy rating), JP Morgan (buy rating), and SunTrust (buy). To their credit,
the two other underwriters are not on the bandwagon (DB has a hold rating,
while Goldman Sachs has not launched coverage). We undoubtedly expect a
vehement defense from certain sellside analysts, after talking to the company
of course.


We do not believe that Web.com is going to zero. Assuming our suspicions
outlined above are correct, Web.com may find itself in some trouble, but the
businesses will not go away and the company should be able to service its
debt under most scenarios. We do however believe the stock is 80%
overvalued. Using Web.com's 2013 guided free cash flow, we believe an

argument could be made the enterprise should be valued at a respectable 10%
free cash flow yield (where other low growth TMT/Internet companies
currently trade). This would value the enterprise at $1 billion, and adjusting
for approximately $691 of net debt, the fair value of the stock would be
approximately $6.00 per share.

On page 7 of the company's 10Q for June
2013, they plainly state in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements under
the header Reclassifications:


"An immaterial correction of an error
related to the 2011 acquisition of Network
Solutions has been reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2012. Goodwill, current
deferred tax assets and the current portion
of deferred revenue have been adjusted
accordingly. In addition, the prior years
reserve for credit card refunds of $1.2mil
has been reclassified from accounts
receivable to accrued expenses."


They include a chart with previously
reported and reclassified amounts.


The fact that you claim this is
"undisclosed" and "devoid of any
explanation or disclosure that we can find"
leads me to believe you either did little
real work for this hatchet job or simply
expected no one to question your piece.
The SEC should be looking at your
practices NOT Web.com's

How does your mistake (missing June 10Q
disclosure) alter the projections?

I agree with dbetten.. Additionally.
Web.com is not pure domain registrar.
They don't just sell domains, they build
websites and do web site hosting. You can
add customers without adding expenses.
So looking for rise in domain
Registration/Renewal expenses is wrong
way in looking for customer attrition or
acquisition.  
Try again harder. and as dbetten mention,
do more research

Tauranga48
The point is that for the domain
registrar part, you can't add revenue
without corresponding costs, and
similarly deferred revenues should
march in lockstep with deferred costs.
The fact they don't is a big red flag. As
you say "try again harder, do more
research".

Hey bro just a quick comment on your
valuation calc. FCF is to the equity, so
when you're using FCF yield you're valuing
the equity tranche and not the whole
company. i.e. 10% FCF yield = 10x P/FCF
<> 10x EV/FCF.


If you really wanted to stretch you could
make some argument based on Modigliani
Miller where you get EV/UFCF plus a tax
shield etc from the add'l leverage, but I
digress.


Also the deferred revenue/cashflow
confusion is pretty easy to identify. Where
has the cash gone? To pay down debt -
adjust the balance sheet items (which are
net of OID) to face and see the decline in
leverage over time.


Also FYI - General Atlantic (the private
equity company that sold network
solutions to web.com) initially bought
network solutions from another private
equity firm, so I also wouldn't attach too
much to the argument that if a PE firm
sells to you then you = screwed.
