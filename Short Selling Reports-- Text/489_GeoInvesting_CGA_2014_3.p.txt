China Green Agriculture Chairman's Fulmination, Accusations Of
Terrorism, And Another 'Sell' Rating
Oct. 22, 2014 10:15 AM ET63 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


CGA's response to our original report has consisted of blanket denials and
potentially staged investor days, completely devoid of primary source evidence to
disprove our thesis.


After CGA excluded its only analyst from attending its investor days, the analyst cut
her rating to "Sell" from "Buy."


The company's latest shareholder letter, which does not seriously address a single
one of our claims, is a desperate rant against short selling "terrorists" subject to
"prosecution" by Chinese police.


We offer concrete evidence to dispute CGA's claim that we published our report in
reaction to the company's dividend announcement.


We continue providing our evidence to regulators, as we have in the past.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


For those of you that are unfamiliar with the China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA) story,
we recently published two reports that challenged the legitimacy of the company's
business. Long a subject of controversy, we believe CGA to be materially misrepresenting
its business to U.S. investors.


In our first report dated October 1, 2014, we offered 344 days of time-lapse surveillance of
the company's high-margin Jinong factory, combined with current and former employee
interviews. The culmination of this evidence strongly suggested that "something is rotten"
in CGA's fertilizer production numbers. In addition, we also questioned the company's
monstrous $113 million marketing-related deferred assets that are currently being rapidly
amortized and expensed from the company's balance sheet into thin air.


In our second report out just last week, we started to ask serious questions about the
26,175 branded retail stores CGA claims to have. Namely, where are they? Do they even
exist?

Since we notified CGA that we were interested in discussing matters with them on
September 30, the company has issued a total of 9 press releases in the last 22 days.


CGA's latest press release was issued mid-day last Friday, in the form of a shareholder
letter from CEO Li Tao. You can view the letter in its entirety here. We think the absurdity
of the letter speaks for itself. In between repeatedly challenging our on-the-ground
research techniques, Li Tao calls us names like "terrorists," "bogus liars," and "saboteurs,"
without refuting any of the substance of our reports.


We encourage everyone to read the letter in its entirety and then ask themselves, "Are
these the musings of someone that I would want as my public company CEO?"


Meanwhile, the only analyst following CGA apparently has already asked herself this
question and immediately cut her rating to "sell" on Monday, after being excluded from
attending CGA's "Investor Days":


Our attempts to register for the event were not acknowledged. We are aware of
others that attempted to attend the event, but were also unable to register. Indeed,
prior to the investor event announcement, we had made numerous attempts to
contact the Company by e-mail and telephone. None of our messages were
answered. We asked a senior executive of another public China company to contact
China Green Agriculture with a reference for Crystal Equity Research and we
presented the Company's legal representation in the U.S. with details of our
questions. None of these overtures were acknowledged, despite the U.S. attorney's
assurances that our questions would be answered.


The analyst appears to now share our negative view of CGA's highly doubtful $113 million
investment in marketing-related deferred assets:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2582215-china-green-agriculture-chairmans-fulmination-accusations-of-terrorism-and-another-sell-rating 3/22


The appearance of misconduct casts a different light on other corporate actions,
namely the significant investment in a marketing program that has required over
$100 million dollars in cash investment over the past three years. Granted the
number of participating retail store has increased dramatically to over 26,000 at the
end of the last fiscal year. Yet the expenditure is significant on a per store basis
given costs of signage and displays in China. If the investment leads to higher sales
in the long term, then it is easily justified. However, the lack of transparency around
the program and the change in accounting treatment now look deceptive. The
marketing program is organized in such a way that it could be easily compromised
by fraudulent retailers or unethical employees.


Given that it appears the Company's legal representation may be complicit in
management's efforts to avoid investor scrutiny, we also have less confidence in the
Company's financial reports. The reclassification of the marketing program assets
from PP&E to deferred revenue was overlooked previously as an understandable
mistake. Now we have concerns that the auditor could be more a conspirator as
well. That casts new doubt on the integrity of the financial reports


CGA Chairman Li Tao's shareholder letter makes an extraordinary amount of
unsubstantiated and defamatory claims (i.e. that we faked our video footage, and that
we're engaging in criminal espionage). We want to immediately address the one key issue
he raises squarely on the head: CGA claims that we published our report as a
reaction to the company declaring a dividend that same morning. The reality is just
the opposite.


CGA's press release from Friday states:


Certain short sellers published an article on October 1, 2014, that falsely alleged us
of misrepresenting results of our operations and our sales. We have carefully
analyzed that article and found it contains numerous factual misstatements. The
article was a malicious attack to our Company's operations and business model with
largely distorted and inaccurate information. Certain presentations in the article were
obtained by the short sellers via criminal means, such as corporate espionage and
sabotage. The law enforcement in China had already taken the case and is currently
prosecuting against this espionage crime.

The truth about this claim is that we had been trying to get in touch with CGA's
management and IR for weeks leading up to the release of this report. We attempted to
reach CGA through several methods, without once receiving a response from the
company. Days before we were to release our first report on CGA, we decided again in
good faith to reach out to the company and see if they could address some of our
questions. This is a step that both long investors and short sellers absolutely do not have
to undertake, but one that we often do, in order to affirm our findings prior to publishing
our reports. If you notice our recent reports on 22nd Century Group, Inc.(OTC:XXII) and
Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. (OTCQB:SBOTF), we spoke to IR or management in both
cases. We truly believe that getting the company's side of the story is a worthwhile task,
as sometimes public filings and press releases can be misinterpreted or management may
offer an alternative explanation of events.


After our attempts to reach CGA's management received no response, we decided to
make one last attempt by contacting one of the company's long-time investors, to see if he
could convince management to talk to us. Management assured this investor that they
would speak to us, but we never heard back from the company.


Here is a consolidated timeline of what happened, with the corresponding e-mail proof
below:


9/29/14 mid-business day - Not being able to get in touch with CGA, we reach out to
a long-time investor via phone.
9/30/14 early business day - The investor sends a copy of an e-mail (copied below)
sent to CGA management asking them to get in touch with us.
9/30/14 rest of business day - No response from CGA management.
Late night 9/30/14 - We are eventually guaranteed (by the investor) a phone
conversation with CGA management the next morning, 10/1/14.
10/1/14 morning - We do not hear back from CGA, and instead are blindsided by the
company's dual press releases announcing a dividend and business update. The
investor sends another e-mail (copied below) to CGA management scolding them for
not reaching out to us.
10/1/14 late morning - Certain that management has no intention of speaking with us,
we publish our first report.


The investor sent the following e-mail to CGA CFO Ken Ren on September 30, 2014 (a
day before our first report was released):

Ken,


This is very important.


I had a discussion with Dan Davis [sic] of GeoInvesting.


Dan is both a long and a short investor. Unlike many of the short sellers, Dan really
does his homework. He is a very, very smart guy. When he says something, he is
almost always correct.


I believe Dan has a negative view of some of the things going on at CGA. Many of
his questions are similar to the ones that I asked you when we had our call.


I think it is very very important for you and Li Tao to reach out to Dan IMMEDIATELY.
When I say immediately, I do not mean next week. I mean ASAP. STAT-- today or
tomorrow. I know this is a holiday week in China, but I do not believe you have a
week to wait.


I have no specific knowledge of what Dan is planning to do. I do not know if he is
planning to write a report or if he does, what his position would be. However, you do
not want to take the chance that a short report on CGA would come out. As you
know, once a short report comes out it costs a company a lot of money to defend it
and to defend the lawsuits that normally follow.


I also believe it is important that Li Tao is involved in the call. Some of the questions
that Dan has can only be answered by Li Tao.


As I said, I do not have any specific knowledge of what Dan is thinking. I do,
however, know that Dan is someone you want as a friend- or at least as a neutral
bystander. He is not someone you want as an opponent. I say this because Dan
always backs up his work with serious research.


I recommend strongly that you and Li Tao reach out to Dan. Dan told me he tried to
reach you and you have not returned his calls. I think this is a mistake.


If you two would like me to be on the call with Dan, I am happy to do so. However, I
think it is important that you contact Dan as soon as possible and ask Li Tao to join
the conversation.


Here is a copy of the above e-mail, which you can click to enlarge:

The investor then told us that Ken Ren had agreed to a call the next morning (October 1)
with CGA management. We had agreed internally to wait to publish our report until after
we had spoken to management, and taken time (days if necessary) to make any
necessary changes to the report incorporating the findings from our conversation with
management.


We waited all morning on October 1 for any correspondence from management. Instead,
CGA issued a PR announcing a very unusual dividend, not payable for over 4 months (a
clear bid to "squeeze the shorts"), alongside another PR with a typically vague CGA
business update. We justly interpreted the two press releases as a rejection of our
invitation to speak. Only then did we decide to proceed with the publication of our first
report, with haste, as we wanted to alert investors as soon as possible to the
misrepresentations we had uncovered over the course of a year investigating CGA.


After CGA failed to contact us, the investor CC'd us on the following email to CGA:

Ken,


I am very upset that you have not called Dan. You have embarrassed me and made
me lose a lot of face.


As I told you, I believe Dan is a very serious and disciplined investor. He has a very
good record as both a long and a short investor. He does his homework and is
always willing to listen to answers from companies.


I see that you have decided to pay a dividend. I think that is excellent. However, I
think you have to talk to people who are investors in your company, even if you think
they are or could be short sellers.


I am still urging you to reach out to Dan. This will benefit you in two ways. First, it
may help to solve some of the problems. Second, it may help you to understand the
issues that are upsetting some investors.


Please reach out to Dan.


Here is a copy of that e-mail, which you can click to enlarge:


After the investor had a chance to read our first report, here is his e-mail to us:

Obviously, the dishonesty in CGA's recent shareholder letter speaks for itself. We could
dismantle the other claims listed therein, but we feel our time is better served alerting the
U.S. regulatory authorities to these events.


Being a public company in the U.S. is a privilege. CGA management's false transparency
with investors speaks for itself, and is not how legitimate companies deal with
shareholders. Rather than welcome the inquiry of a short seller, which seasoned CEOs
running legitimate businesses have done in the past, CGA has instead taken the ad
hominem route. Could you imagine the CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company
(NYSE:SMG) or Potash Corp. (POT) signing off on a shareholder letter calling short
sellers "terrorists" or claiming that the police are "prosecuting" researchers who took
pictures of their factories or spoke to their employees? If Chinese police are really
investigating our work, we're happy to share it with them, just as we're providing our
research to the SEC and other regulatory agencies.


We continue to be short CGA.

Another article that smells like sheer desperation. The 10/29 x-dividend date is rapidly approaching and will obviously
be a painful payout day for the shorts....tic tok tic tok tic tok


22 Oct 2014, 10:20 AM


Keubiko, Contributor
Yes, that 10 cent payout on a $2.32 stock that will have 10 cents per share left on the balance sheet, and
curiously isn't payable until 2015, will surely scare away "desperate shorts" that think this is a zero.


22 Oct 2014, 10:24 AM


jortiz
A dividend that has already been announced is nearly instantaneously factored in to the price. If a stock
announces they are giving x dollars per share in one year, then the stock price jumps x, minus the risk free
interest rate which is, effectively, zero. Unless people don't really think its going to happen...which would be
sad.

i'm tempted to buy 100 shares to see what happens but i have to say the short argument has started to convince me.
I don't see any evidence of insider buying. I don't see any evidence that the management is responding credibly to the
complaints. what i see from cga is emotional responses that are becoming shrill. that's not how business is supposed
to work.

GEO is lying again. Dividend announcement was 2 hours earlier. Easy to proof.


>>Could you imagine the CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) or Potash Corp.<< will provide a lsit of
all shops which are selling there products ?


>>calling short sellers "terrorists"<<


That is exactly what you are doing. Selling short and spreading lies, that is your business. Who are, which person ?

released

They're waiting till next quarter to start paying it.... not uncommon at all. Also, the X-Div date is in a week.... its not like
that doesn't matter. They can't just announce a dividend and pay it the next day.. though you would like the "longs" to
think that is what should happen don't you?

Also, in the last "email" from "long time CGA investor" - he says that the decision to pay out a dividend was decided
long before the geo article... they just pushed up the announcement - probably to reject short allegations. That is why
there is a longer time gap then even probably management had anticipated.

Really Gentlemen? Did you see the extensive video the Geo team recorded? Management seems not interested in
talking to anyone with a question or two including the covering analyst. Did any long investors find anywhere close to
26,000+ distribution points? Unprofessional management resort to name calling now. Very risky. 
Disclosure- I was long until Geo first report, all my investment funds in a retirement account so I cannot short. (or I
would this one.)

What CGA explained poorly is the following in their letter to the shareholders: "To fulfill the shipping requirement in
production process, we used various means of transportation such as vehicles, railroad trains, air cargo carriers, third
parties, and pipelines to move raw materials, inventories, finished goods, as well as supply of parts and logistics from
one location to another."


It is somehow not realistic to transport fertilizers with a pipeline and Geo did not film any railroad trains in their video
surveillance. I also don't think that they have an airport on their fabric area for air cargo carriers either. So this is
poorly explained and the goods have to leave the factory somehow.


On the other hand, Tao Li (CEO) purchased a total of 829,896 shares of the common stock from the company with an
over $2 million investment of his personal wealth accumulatively since 2012. 
If this is a fraud, the insider buying of the CEO makes no sense. As this is not the first attack by a short seller, I can
also understand their reactions.

That is extremely naive.


A) How do you know he even cut the check? Per the Form 4:


"On October 1, 2014, the reporting person subscribed 496,445 shares of common stock through a private
placement from China Green Agriculture, Inc., at a purchase price of $2.25 per share, for an aggregate
purchase price of $1,117,000."


Why wouldn't he purchase shares in the open market through a registered broker?


Why dilute fellow shareholder/victims with a buy from treasury at "low" prices?


They have a June Fiscal Year so the earliest an auditor would even look at this is late 2015.


 
B) Even if he did cut the check:


He owns 8.7M shares worth nearly $20M. Who knows where other shares are.


What is a million or two if a fraudster thinks he can unload the rest from actual or other accounts.


 
C) Even if he did cut the check, how do you know where the funds came from? Were they borrowed against
shares the counterparty shorted, and so on.


 
The key point is, when it comes to fraud, you can't just accept something on face value just because it
appears on your screen or on a piece of paper.


Defrauding westerners is a national sport in China.


The reality is this company has done little to nothing to even address the allegations raised by the author.


Caveat emptor.

I am more concerned about the date of the announcement of the stock subscription of the CEO. It is the same
date when Geo published their first report. I don't think that this is a coincident.


Further, another writer, Chris Wu who visited the company, did conclude that CGA is a fraud some years ago.
Check his pictures: http://seekingalpha.co...


In addition, they did not have any arguments against the allegations of Geo.


My conclusion: Most likely their revenue is overstated (just check the pictures) and they produce much less. I
guess this is a fraudulent company.

Hi, 
Chris Wu's accusation where all cleared by the SEC investigation during 2011. 
The major part in his accusation is about Yuxing, or greengarden the Green house project. There is so much
evidence available about this, that there is no doubt left. 
Yuxing is also a major supplier for :http://bit.ly/1wV3Rh1

I'd like to know if this is actually insider buying or some free option executes. Shares outstanding on
gurufocus are steadily rising. 2013 reads 27.8M. 2014 reads 31.4M. Trailing twelve months reads 34.8M as of
today.


I'd love to purchase stock if the company is legitimate. But I can't invest if there is a shadow of a doubt. Take
a tip from Warren Buffett ~ There are thousands of securities out there. You just need to be right about one.


Even though, I'm still curious and will prod a little further.

"shadow of a doubt" are lifted. Company made a payment of dividend in January, and promised more
dividends during the last conference call. 
One of the CEO's private owned startups received a 500 million US$ subsidary. http://bit.ly/15LGvmq 
These will help CGA, because it is a win win situation. The Sister (Jane Bai) will buy food from farmer and
pay 10% more money if farmers use CGA green fertilizers. I have doubt in the intelligence of US investors. In
China they give white collar criminals a shoot in the neck.

This is not a clear case at all. A rational approach could therfore be the following: Keep the stock and wait until the
shorts have to buy back CGA stocks on the market. This could increase the stock price of CGA. You can still sell the
stock after the price increase.

An excellent job of alerting investors to a sham company. Those who remain invested in the company now have only
themselves to blame when the axe falls. You have done them a favor if only they can recognize it in time.

MBollar99- I agree with most of your comments until you said:  
"Keep the stock and wait until the shorts have to buy back CGA stocks on the market. This could increase the stock
price of CGA. You can still sell the stock after the price increase" 
I cannot agree with this advice, more shorts can drive the price lower and GEO team article(s) could initiate a SEC or
other investigation possible sending CGA to much lower levels or zero.


23 Oct 2014, 04:23 PM


Michu
You are probably right. If an investor is convinced that this is a fraud, he should better sell immediately (I
actually did after the first Geo report). Consider also that the auditor Kabani of CGA is not a very well-known
company. According to barrons, Kabani audited Bodisen Biotech, one of the earliest China blowups.

Thanks Geoteam, I feel so relieved I sold that position after your first report! I still relishes following that story unfold.


M. Tao Li actually sorts of address the claims, but in a vague, implausible and misleading way. Take that for instance: 
"To fulfill the shipping requirement in the production process, we used various means of transportation such as
vehicles, railroad trains, air cargo carriers, third parties, and pipelines to move raw materials, inventories, finished
goods, as well as supply of parts and logistics from one location to another." 
As MBoller99 notes, it is unlikely that they use pipelines, trains or planes to ship their fertilizers out. Even more
misleading is the talk about third parties. Basically the argument goes like this: 
- Not enough trucks went out of the warehouse to carry out the fertilizers you claim. 
- That is wrong. Some of these trucks belong to other companies and we use planes to get spare parts for our
machines. 
Yeah, that makes sense now...


It is a fascinating contrast to look at the exchange. The cautious hard fact based analysis of Geoteam versus the
emotional response of CGA, based on greed (dividend), fear (terrorism, police investigation) and authority (auditor
said we are ok), while questioning the intent rather than the content of the attacks.


As to M. Li's vivid metaphors, my personal favorite quote goes to: "I don't and will never negotiate with terrorists".


Keep on the good work. I am considering shorting the company now. This is definitely not my usual investing strategy,
as I am more a long-term investor, but that is tempting.

Here's a little secret:


Assets - Liabilities = Equity


If Assets (e.g. cash) go down, equity goes down by the same amount.


If they want to pay out cash and start stressing their balance sheet so much the better.

Here's a little secret:


Assets - Liabilities = Equity- Bullshitmoney=Net Tangible Assets


CGA Marketcapitalisation is 63 Million Net Assets 314 Million


They pay out 2 million Dollar Dividend


What a great problem. They have still 311 Million Dollar Net Assets


IBM has a Market Cap of 161 Billion and Net Assets of minus 20 Billion


You should worry of all your ill rotten US companies instead of assulting a healthy chinese growthh stock with
excellent management. CGA has a CEO that has built and start the companies, People like him can be trusted. For
TAO Li it is a question of Honor, not only Money. 
He told us last quarter, that this is the time to reward loyal shareholders. 
I think we will se a surprise in January. Good Luck to all longs.

based on the growth of the company and cash on hand I think the January dividend will be raised to anywhere
between .12 and .14 cents

i expect a dividend plan, with quarterly dividends. They stated in the last release that Gufeng has new possibilty to
finance Growth with Sini. Hopefully this release cash for Dividends. 
CGA can be the stock to own, in 2015. I will buy more at the end of the month.

I've been informed that the last dividend was not a special dividend but rather a regular dividend in which case I'm
anticipating the next one will be announced sometime around the first week of January.

I think this stock is very risky. Management never provided any evidence, why the video surveillance is not accurate.
So the best assumption is to assume that the financials are fake and that the many actions of this company are
suspicious.  
Finally, this company was set-up with a Reverse Merger (RM) and Chinese Reverse Mergers have a very bad track
record.


16 Jan 2015, 04:18 PM

>>Finally, this company was set-up with a Reverse Merger (RM) and Chinese Reverse Mergers have a very bad track

This is not true. As you should know that CRM has a for better surveival rates as US RM.

True, but the survival rate of Reverse Mergers (U.S. and Chinese) overall is bad.


Another paper shows a quite different outcome: 
(The Market for "Lemons". A Study of Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism for Chinese Firms Listed in the
US):


- Chinese IPO default rates, 3 years after listing: 5% (US IPOs: 13%) 
- Chinese Reverse Merger (RM) default rates, 3 years after listing: 30%

So my conclusion is that it is better to invest in Chinese IPOs and avoid all RMs. 
I guess that fraudsters preferred the much easier way to get listed, which is through a Reverse Merger.


18 Jan 2015, 02:56 PM

>>Chinese IPOs and avoid all RMs<< 
Yes, under normal ciircumstances you are right, but CGA is far beyond 3, or 5 years. In 8 days they are a
grown up company and paying Dividend.

I am still unhappy with CGA's IR but in my history i had made exoirience with both kind of IR. And i beleave
CGA will convinc with facts on next earnings release. Good luck

What I admit is that this stock, if it is not a fraud, is now very, very cheap. Such valuations are very rare on earth, the

Currently, it seem that fraud risks are already well priced in the stock value.  
I think that the stock price of CGA is mostly influenced by the general performance of Chinese micro caps (which had
a bad time in the last year) and not so much by the individual risks of the company.


04 Feb 2015, 04:13 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
>>Currently, it seem that fraud risks are already well priced in the stock value. <<


Frauds have a very good chance of going to zero. I would say the risk is well priced in around zero.


04 Feb 2015, 04:17 PM


Michu
True, fraudulent companies usually go to cero.


However, CGA certainly has business operations. The question is, if these operations are as big as they claim. I really
don't know that. The dividends are no real proof because on absolute numbers, the dividends are not significant. On
the other hand, CGA is in business for more than 5 years and has survived the attacks by short sellers.

do you know that CEO Tao Li received a large subsidy for his privat owned green food shop. Jane Bai(LH900) has
contracts with more than 200 farmers, these farmers have to use CGA's green fertilizer. I think CGA will benefit throug

I'm currently not buying or have the wish to sell. J. Capital told us that CGA is a complete fraud and that there
is no business. I have seen in chinese press that the Company has real business. I have talked to a former
employee who went for studying to the states, and i have talked to competitors in China.
