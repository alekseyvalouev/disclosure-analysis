NEPI Rockcastle – Horsing around in the Stable 
Irreconcilable international earnings,  enriching management through M&A, hoodwinking 


investors through misleading analysis  via rejection of independent investigation . 


NEPI Rockcastle (JSE:NRP) is a JSE-listed entity holding one of the largest real-estate investment portfolios in 


Eastern Europe. Viceroy’s investigations have uncovered numerous inconsistencies within NEPI Rockcastle’s 


financial reporting and major links to an established financial fraud: 


▪ Local filings for NEPI’s Romanian subsidiaries suggest company figures are massively overstated for at least 


the past 3 years. Romania is NEPI’s largest geographical income segment in which consolidated 2017 group 


accounts show net profit before tax of EUR 284.87m (2016: EUR 221.90m). Local income statements show 


these companies operate at losses of over >EUR 40m (2016: >EUR 50m) for the same period. 


▪ Viceroy believe corporate or tax-effective structure or transfer pricing does not adequately explain the 


substantial differences in Romanian earnings generation as NEPI’s reported income tax expenses in Romania 


also do not match local filings. Given the criminal implications of misrepresenting tax numbers to the 


Romanian tax office, we assume NEPI chose to instead mislead its shareholders. 


▪ NEPI’s recent acquisition of Rockcastle was immediately followed by a massive write-down of subsidiary 


loans reflecting uncollectable debt from SPVs. When taken together with the purchase premium for the 


business of almost 80%, it is clear that the only winners in the Rockcastle acquisition were Resilient Stable 


insiders. 


▪ NEPI’s former chairman Corneliu-Dan Pascariu was involved in Romanian real-estate venture CEEIF, funded 


by the Peregrine Financial fraud perpetrated by Russell Wasendorf Sr. NEPI purchased Romanian assets 


from CEEIF before the Peregrine Financial fraud came to light. Court filings establish that CEEIF and several 


subsidiary development & holding companies were utilized by Wasendorf Sr. to embezzle cash.  


▪ Despite having financial recourse for beneficial ownership of ~11% of CEEIF’s purported book value of >EUR 


60m, Peregrine’s Receiver, Michael M. Eidelman, had no interest in pursuing these recoveries. Eidelman’s 


investigations alleged CEEIF was insolvent, did not discount asset values to CEEIF’s pro-rata minor stakes, 


hid assets and liabilities from its balance sheet, and had no audited financial statements. Given Pascariu’s 


involvement as a major shareholder and financier through Unicredit, at which he was chairman at the time, 


it would have to have been extremely neglectful to not detect this activity. 


▪ NEPI shareholders issued a written request on 8 August 2018 for an independent investigation into potential 


trading of associated companies, suspicious capital raising activity and property transactions. NEPI rejected 


demands for an independent investigation, instead establishing a subcommittee of its own members to 


investigate themselves, and their predecessors. 


▪ Even without considering the above points, NEPI is fundamentally overpriced when compared with peers.  


Based on our analysis, we see a significant downside to NEPI’s share price driven by an unwarranted 


overvaluation and the likelihood of substantially lower-than-reported earnings. Were NEPI to trade in-line with 


peers we believe shareholders would face an 25% downside, however, given the suspected extent of financial 


misrepresentation, we believe the company’s shares are worth substantially less. 


We believe stakeholders should reinforce their demands for an independent forensic investigation into the 


company’s operations and veracity of its financial consolidation and tax compliance. Until such time, Viceroy 


believe NEPI carries a high investment risk.  


For more research into the Resilient Stable, readers should refer to the leaked internal memo by 36One Asset 


Management which we believe was published around the end of 2017. Viceroy have hosted an embedded Scibd 


link to this report on our website. Viceroy have no business relationship with 36One Asset Management and 


have never discussed NEPI Rockcastle with them.

1. Stonewalled: the investor letter 
In September of 2018 a collection of asset managers wrote to the members of the “Resilient stable” consisting 


of NEPI Rockcastle PLC, Resilient REIT Limited, Fortress REIT Limited and Greenbay Properties Limited1. These 


shareholders demanded an independent investigation by one of the big-four auditing firms into allegations of 


misconduct including share price manipulation and insider dealing. 


On September 3, 2018 NEPI Rockcastle issued its rebuttal saying it had set up its own subcommittee to conduct 


a probe consisting of its board chair, audit chair, CEO and CFO.  


 
Figure 1 Rockcastle defies calls for neutral investigation – Business Day2 


This subcommittee plans to investigate the alleged existence malfeasance possibly within its own members, or 


their predecessors. We believe this half-measure is indicative that the company has something to hide.  


2. The Romania portfolio 
NEPI Rockcastle’s operations are fairly straightforward at face value. Each NEPI Rockcastle property (or small 


portfolio of related properties) is managed by a Single-Purpose Vehicle (SPV). SPV’s are financed by loans (in 


some circumstances we have also found equity injections) from NEPI Rockcastle holding companies, which in 


turn are financed by both the listed parent entity and external debt. These holding companies are not necessarily 


domiciled in the same country as the SPV and finance the operations of several countries.  


Romania is the largest and most profitable geographical segment in NEPI’s portfolio. Operations in the country 


accounted for 57% of the company’s retail and office sector revenue in 2017.  


Local filings for NEPI’s Romanian subsidiaries obtained by Viceroy Research suggest company earnings figures 


are massively overstated for at least the past 3 years. Consolidated 2017 group accounts show net profit before 


tax of EUR 284.9m (2016: EUR 221.9m). Local income statements show that NEPI’s Romanian subsidiaries 


operated at combined losses of over EUR 41m (2016: >EUR 50m loss) over the same period.

2.1. How REITs are typically structured 
Seasoned REIT investors will know that it is preferable for income to accrue at the ultimate holding company 


level and not at the SPV level for tax minimization purposes, as holding companies are typically domiciled in low-


tax/no-tax jurisdictions. For those not familiar with a REIT structure, below is a sample capital flow you will see 


in most international REITs: 


1. SPV’s purchase/develop income-generating assets through debt funding from parent holding company. 


2. The vast majority of income generated from SPV’s makes its way back to the parent company through 


interest payments on debt issued to buy/develop/maintain income-generating assets. This is referred 


to as transfer pricing. 


3. The parent company is domiciled in an income-tax haven: for NEPI this is the Isle of Man. 


The purpose of establishing this type of structure is obviously to minimize tax. Naturally, most geographies 


attempt to plug this tax “loophole” by implementing regulations (i.e. the arm’s length lending principle) which 


essentially force SPV’s to recognize at least some taxable profits locally. 


At the end of the day, revenues, expenses and taxes incurred in local subsidiaries should reconcile back to the 


ultimate holding company. Viceroy’s review of NEPI’s local Romanian accounts show this is not the case with 


NEPI. 


As part of our due diligence process, Viceroy has obtained local filings of NEPI’s individual Romanian entities 


from 2014 to 2017. At a high level, these filings suggest that: 


▪ NEPI’s Romanian segment generated EUR >40m in losses in 2017 (2016: >EUR 50m) – a EUR 325m (2016: 


EUR 278m) difference to NEPI’s reported figures. Our research suggests this is inclusive of EUR 66m (2016: 


EUR 103m) of non-cash, property revaluation gains implying the cash loss is much greater. 


▪ A rudimentary balance sheet analysis of local Romanian filings suggests NEPI generated EUR 276m (2016: 


EUR 177m) of NPAT locally. The only way this could consolidate with year-on-year local Income Statement 


losses is through EUR 317m (2016: EUR 233m) of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), which is not 


reasonable as property revaluations are recorded in the Income Statement. Many of the local balance 


sheets assets also do not even reconcile (i.e. assets do not equal the sum of liabilities and equity).  


▪ NEPI’s 2017 annual report recognizes EUR 36.71m of tax in Romania. For taxes to be recognized and paid in 


Romania, subsidiaries would have to operate at a profit. In reality, local Romanian filings suggest that NEPI 


subsidiaries collectively recognized only EUR 1.66m (2016: EUR 2.44m) in local taxes on significant earnings 


losses. 


▪ Viceroy have obtained every filing for every Romanian subsidiary from 2014 through to 2017, with the 


exception of NEPI Fifteen Real-estate Administration SRL, which we could not locate within the Romanian 


companies register. Further, Viceroy have been able to consolidate fixed asset values and revenues of local 


filings to that of NEPI’s consolidated financial report notes. These figures are verified by NEPI’s independent 


valuers. Expenses and earnings are not.  


▪ Internal consolidations between these local entities could not explain the extent of these losses.  


Our analysis of revenue and earnings reported in local Romanian filings suggest NEPI’s 


reported performance has been adulterated.

2.2. A summary of NEPI subsidiary filings in Romania 
Local income statement filings of NEPI’s subsidiaries in Romania show this portfolio generated a pre-tax loss of 


EUR ~53m in 2017 (2016: EUR 77m), contrary to the EUR 221m profit claimed by NEPI to shareholders. Below 


is a table showing the aggregated financials of NEPI’s Romanian subsidiaries.

To avoid double-counting local holding companies, we have also isolated the SPV’s that hold income-generating 


assets as detailed in NEPI’s reported schedule of properties, annexed in their annual reports: 


 
Figure 5 Viceroy analysis of Romanian filings 


This figure, that we believe is more accurate, results in a pre-tax loss of EUR ~41m in 2017 (2016: EUR ~58m), 


EUR ~326m less than reported by NEPI for the period. 


Filings for these companies are publicly available through Romania’s Ministry of Public Finance’s website at: 


http://www.mfinante.gov.ro/pjuridice.html  


Viceroy has consulted with REIT specialists and have worked to disprove legitimate and illegitimate explanations 


for this discrepancy. We present these below. 


The inconsistencies highlighted in our analysis suggests earnings in Romania have been 


fabricated at either the consolidated or local level.

2.4. Consolidating local balance sheets 
An analysis of NEPI’s local subsidiaries’ balance sheets shows these losses cannot be consolidated year-on-year. 


The applicable raw data will be attached to this report for review, however we have summarized these findings 


for the purpose for brevity: 


 
Figure 6 Viceroy analysis of NEPI subsidiaries’ balance sheets 


Where local income statements suggest the Romanian segment recorded a EUR 41m (2016: EUR 58m) loss, the 


same entities’ balance sheets indicate a EUR 276m (2016: EUR 177m) profit.  


Consider the following: 


▪ While we have accounted for additional paid-up capital in our calculation, we have not considered dividends 


that may have been paid to the immediate holding companies. The inclusion of any dividends would 


increase the implied NPAT at the local subsidiary level. 


▪ The only way this can possibly consolidate to the same entities’ income statements is through a massive 


“other comprehensive income” item, which can only substantially consist of: 


o Revaluation of assets – note that only operating or held-for-sale assets can be revalued here. For 


instance, the value of NEPI’s regional office (if owned by the Company) could be appreciated as 


other comprehensive income. Investment property (which is substantially all NEPI’s fixed asset 


base) must be revalued on the Income Statement. 


o FOREX – not applicable at local operation level. 


These discrepancies add another layer of complexity to those we have identified in NEPI’s accounts. We have 


been unable to reconcile the balance sheets and income statements year-on-year at the local level. 


Further, there are several entities in which the balance sheet does not reconcile at all3, where total assets do 


not equal the sum of total liabilities and equity for several years. 


Viceroy perceive these substantial accounting discrepancies as a major red flag and 


reinforce our belief that these earnings have been adulterated.

2.5. Lack of local filings not valid argument for profit discrepancy 
We believe one of the criticisms we will receive is that we have missed subsidiaries in Romania, thus reflecting 


a below-reported figure for earnings locally. 


NEPI discloses each of its subsidiaries in its annual report. We have collected filings for every single Romanian 


subsidiary listed, except for NEPI Fifteen Real-estate Administration SRL, which we were unable to find within 


the Romanian National Trade Register.  


 
Figure 7 Investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017 


NEPI’s Dutch subsidiary NE Property Cooperatief’s debt prospectuses also outlines the corporate structure in 


Romania: 


 
Figure 8 Summarized holding structure – NE Property Cooperatief Notes Issue dated 15 Nov 20174 


The image is somewhat pixelated, so we note that the Romanian entities are grouped on the bottom left and 


captioned with “Management Company” and “Property Owning Company”.  


There does not appear to be any other Romanian holding companies in the structure which we have overlooked, 


which is consistent with the asset holding structure as described in NEPI’s annual report. 


Further, the fixed asset value of property-holding entities in local filings (Figure 9 below) matches that of NEPI’s 


annual report disclosures to a reasonable margin of error. The value of these properties had been assessed by 


third parties (in this case Cushman & Wakefield) relatively recently5. For avoidance of doubt, Viceroy does not 


believe these properties are fictitious – we simply do not believe NEPI’s P&L accurately reflects the earnings 


generated from these properties per local filings.

Figure 9 Viceroy Analysis 


Using estimates of investment property fair value movements in Romania, Viceroy believe we believe we have 


reconciled locally reported revenues against operating revenues as disclosed by NEPI in its schedule of 


properties. Note that these investment property figures would also have been independently verified in a 


property valuation, whereas earnings are typically not tested. 


  
Figure 10 Viceroy Analysis 


We have therefore assumed that property revaluations are inclusive in local filing revenues. If this is not the 


case, this situation is made even more obscure as it suggests: 


1. Both revenues and expenses indicated in local filings would far exceed those reported by the 


Company and fluctuate excessively year-on-year. This is not realistic in a REIT – rent yields are 


reasonably consistent and well-documented; 


2. Local asset bases are growing on capex, which is not the case given suggested cash flows; and/or 


3. Property revaluation is recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, which is not IFRS compliant.

2.6. Transfer pricing does not explain these profit discrepancies 
We believe the possibility of earnings being moved offshore prior to closing accounts is also not viable.  


If the primary business activity of Holding companies was to issue debt and collect interest, we should see 


significant earnings power within “Holding” subsidiary segments from interest income, and significantly lower 


net profit before tax within operating geographies.  


This is not the case. If the EUR ~326m earnings shortfall within local Romanian accounts were transfer priced to 


holding company lenders, this would have made significant positive impact on the NEPI’s “Holding” segment 


profit before tax figures, and negative impact on Romanian profit before tax.  


 
Figures 11 Geographical breakdown of revenue – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017 


We accordingly expected that the large profit before tax disclosed by NEPI in Romania implies that tax is 


subsequently paid on this profit. NEPI also discloses in its annual report that it does indeed pays tax on profits 


in Romania, and thus Romanian entities must make a profit. There are no profits at the local level according to 


local filings. 


 
Figure 12 Tax rate reconciliation – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017
Viceroy Research Group 11 viceroyresearch.org 


At this point, it is worth noting that local Romanian filings show NEPI entities have recorded substantially less in 


tax expenses than reported by NEPI in Figure 12 above. NEPI appears to have recorded unrealized gains in its 


local P&L filings, so the exclusion of deferred tax would not be IFRS compliant. 


   
Figure 13 Viceroy analysis 


Further, local filings suggest that losses and CAPEX in Romania have been floated by paid-up capital (i.e. issuing 


extra shares), alongside issuing debt. This is not consistent with the transfer pricing model. 


In our opinion this is inexplicable and inconsistent with NEPI’s policy on transfer pricing and taxes in foreign 


jurisdictions: 


 
Figure 14 Tax Policy – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017 


For further reference and completeness, we have annexed our entire raw data set of Romanian subsidiary filings 


to this report. 


Viceroy believe with a high level of conviction that NEPI’s segment reports have been 


fabricated either in its consolidated group accounts or within local Romanian filings. 


The latter would constitute tax fraud. 


This is not unrealistic given the way in which NEPI pays out its dividends – mostly via scrip. The consolidated 


group does not need cash at the listed entity level to meet its relatively low ~5% dividend yield, given >70% was 


paid out in shares in 2017. At face value, it indeed seems that the group’s investments have been primarily 


funded through raising equity (which for early shareholders is largely favorable), leaving the group cash-heavy 


at the end of periods and again demanding a large book premium on unutilized capital. 


We anticipate that the Resilient Stable will no doubt respond to this report by raising the company’s dividends. 


This would be pretty straightforward with a >70% scrip uptake.

2.7. Improper Romanian consolidation by Viceroy not feasible explanation for profit 


discrepancies 
Another criticism we believe this analysis will attract is that our analysis does not properly account for intra-


company transactions within Romanian subsidiaries.  


This is valid in the sense our figures will not be 100% accurate, however the extraordinary EUR ~326m difference 


between NEPI’s reported Romanian profits and the results we have collected from local filings is simply not 


explainable by improper consolidation within Romanian entities. 


2.8. Auditor spread 
NEPI’s auditors, PwC, are a global firm with the capacity to reduce audit risk by overseeing all of NEPI’s subsidiary 


audits. This is not the case. We note that within the Romanian portfolio alone, local filings suggest the use of at 


least 4 audit firms in Romania, including a single-office local auditor for one of NEPI’s local holding companies 


and for Valcea Shopping City. 


More concerning is the fact that only 8 of the Romanian SPVs have listed auditors in their registry documents. 


Many local SPV’s do not have listed auditors at all. Limited filings Viceroy have obtained from other geographies 


indicate an even greater spread of auditors reviewing NEPI’s operations. A sample list is as follows: 


▪ PricewaterhouseCoopers Romania – 4 entities 


▪ Ernst & Young Romania – 1 entity 


▪ KPMG Romania – 1 entity 


▪ Focus Audit SRL Romania – 2 entities 


▪ PricewaterhouseCoopers – Czech Republic 


▪ VGD Audit – Czech Republic 


This list is in no way complete. We simply do not have the capacity to pull more records (we have reviewed 


hundreds). 


Curiously, if we group all 8 local Romanian SPVs that have listed auditors, earnings results are more in line with 


what we would expect for a REIT, with 4 to 5 of the 8 SPVs showing profits before tax over the last 3 years.  


According to local filings, only ~7 of the 45 SPVs are profitable in any year in aggregate.  


While it suggests that NEPI only audits its more profitable SPVs, this would be premature given the small sample 


size of entities with listed auditors. Nonetheless, this circumstance does not inspire confidence and we believe 


this is a major risk that should be investigated further by an independent third party.
Viceroy Research Group 13 viceroyresearch.org 


2.9. Ballooning receivables balance 
Local filings also show extremely high receivables balances at NEPI’s Romanian SPV’s.  


  
Figure 15 Analysis of NEPI’s Romanian Portfolio – Receivable days analysis 


REIT investors would know that almost three months of outstanding rent receivables are not commonplace and 


are indicative of poorly managed accounting departments and/or industry downturn. 


These receivables are not limited to service-producing entities which may include inter-group transactions, but 


a number of office buildings, malls and warehouses. For instance, Ramnicu Valcea Shopping City SRL has over 


1,800 receivable days and is a regional shopping center. 


2.10. Key takeaways on consolidation 
There is a glaring inconsistency between NEPI’s segment reporting and local financial filings in Romania, which 


Viceroy believe stems from overblown reported expenses and, perhaps consequentially, under-recognized tax. 


It would be a stretch to say this portfolio is massively loss-making. The fact of the matter is that as far as 


investments go, retail real-estate assets are reasonably stable and generally profitable. Our main issue is the 


lack of consistency within earnings. The major discrepancies between reported vs. actual on-the-ground 


accounts, the lack of consolidation between filings year-on-year, and the lack of any reasonable explanation for 


these inconsistencies leads us to believe NEPI has adulterated its accounts. 


It's worth noting at this stage that the accounts of NEPI’s Dutch holding company, NE Property Cooperatief, do 


consolidate with the ultimate parent company. Therefore, we can isolate this issue exactly between the 


Romanian entities and the Dutch holding company, it should not take an external auditor long to find glaring 


inconsistencies in these accounts. 


Audit 101 is centered around understanding how to minimize audit risk, such as man-made mistakes. The best 


way to minimize these risks is to conduct the audit yourself. Viceroy perceive the vast spread of auditors across 


NEPI’s SPVs, even within a geography, as a major red flag as inter-firm communications allow significant room 


for error. 


Viceroy believe it is possible that earnings or cash have been smoothed, washed or otherwise mistreated 


through a third party or off-balance sheet entity. We believe it would be prudent for shareholders to demand 


the appointment of an independent forensic accountant to investigate this matter, specifically the cash trail. 


Lastly, we have performed only preliminary assessments of NEPI’s other geographies’ accounts. At this stage, 


we have found SPV’s in Czech Republic displaying certain similarities to those of Romanian SPV’s. We are in the 


process of obtaining financial statements for other geographies, however simply to not have the resources to 


conduct a full investigation given the limited transparency of certain jurisdictions.

3. The Rockcastle Acquisition 
NEPI announced the acquisition (quasi-merger) of Rockcastle Global Real-Estate Company Limited (“Rockcastle”) 


on December 14, 2016 for consideration of EUR 2.3b. The goodwill on the transaction amounted to a massive 


EUR 886m – a 62% premium to book value for a REIT! 


 
Figure 16 Business Combinations and Significant Asset Deals – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017 


This EUR 886m premium was written off in its entirety within 6 months of the acquisition. 


 
Figure 17 Income statement – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017   


Note that the parent company’s accounts show this write-off was attributed to impairment of investments in, 


and loans to subsidiaries.  


 
Figure 18 Impairment – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017  


It’s fair to assume this impairment, which represents 27% of total loans to Rockcastle subsidiaries, appears to 


be representative of a largely non-performing internal loan book and is consistent with the problems which NEPI 


appear to have in Romania.
Viceroy Research Group 15 viceroyresearch.org 


3.1. Beyond face value – the massive Rockcastle rip-off 
NEPI holders were left holding the bag as a result of NEPI’s acquisition of Rockcastle – plain and simple. 


As if a 62% premium to book value (for a REIT!) was not excessive, Viceroy’s analysis of the fine-print will show 


that the premium was actually closer to 80%. 


Note that a large portion of Rockcastle’s book value was made up of listed security investments (equities and 


derivatives, such that the gross exposure is much greater than the value). These financial instruments were 


quoted as being “highly liquid”, and thus determining a fair value is quite straightforward – a market value is 


used.  


 
Figure 19 Business combinations and significant asset deals – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017 


The problem with this is that because these financial instruments already trade in public markets, the fair value 


is already inclusive of any applicable premium or discount, and any book value premium should not apply to 


their value. 


To find the adjusted goodwill, we revised the calculation to exclude the premium on these assets: 


 
Figure 20 Viceroy analysis on Rockcastle acquisition 


As an aside, the leaked 36One Asset Management analysis on the Resilient Stable highlighted that this issue was 


also applicable to Resilient and Fortress, given their cross-holding of shares, among many other issues. Viceroy 


highly recommend readers seek out this report as additional reading.

3.2. Enriching management 
Many insiders benefitted from NEPI’s excessively priced transaction. Resilient Properties was an 8.76% holder 


at time of sale. Fortress, another entity in the Resilient stable, was a 17.71% holder at the time of acquisition. 


Insiders including the CEO and CFO of Rockcastle owned another 2.43%. 


 
Figures 21 & 22 “Resilient Stable” ownership structure 


The goodwill associated with this extremely over-priced acquisition allowed insiders to gain an excessively large 


portion of NEPI at the detriment of NEPI holders, who had to bear Rockcastle-related losses manifested in the 


aforementioned write-offs in an extremely dilutive transaction: 


 
Figure 23 Business combinations and significant asset deals – NEPI Rockcastle Annual Report 2017
Viceroy Research Group 17 viceroyresearch.org 


It is also noteworthy that Rockcastle claimed US$55.6m in distributable earnings in the half year ending June 30, 


2017, right before the closing of the NEPI acquisition6.  


Rockcastle’s history prior to its acquisition is nothing short of miraculous: as of June 30, 2014, the company had 


EUR 0 in investment property and was largely invested in global real-estate securities. All investment property 


was acquired in a very short 1.5 years. 


 
Figure 24 Balance sheet – Rockcastle Annual Report 2015 


All of which begs the question as to why this subprime transaction was completed with 


such an excessive premium. 


3.3. Key Takeaways 
We believe it is prudent for NEPI investors to investigate this transaction further – Viceroy believe they have 


been hoodwinked. The excessive valuation given to Rockcastle’s property portfolio is unheard of.

4. Origins: Peregrine Financial & CEEIF 
NEPI was incorporated on July 23, 2007 and listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange on August 


22, 2007. Though not largely publicized by the company, NEPI’s original purpose has to do with an obscure 


company by the name of Central and Eastern European Investment Fund (“CEEIF”), a Cyprus incorporated entity 


with financial ties to fraudulent US entity Peregrine Financial Group. 


In NEPI’s 2008 annual report the company mentioned it had acquired a portfolio of Romanian properties from 


Oceanis International BV. 


 
Figure 25 Further acquisitions – NEPI Annual Report 20087 


Dutch filings show that Oceanis International BV’s parent company is “CEEIF Central and Eastern Euro”: 


 
Figure 26 Oceanis International BV drimble.nl profile8 


…formerly known as CEEIF Central and Eastern European Investment Fund. 


 
Figure 27 CEEIF Central and Eastern European Investment Limited opencorporates.com profile9 


NEPI’s 2008 purchase of the Raiffeisen portfolio was not the only transaction between the company and the 


CEEIF group of entities. In 2010, NEPI purchased a 33,000m2 property from Central and Eastern European Real-


estate Shareholdings BV (CEERES) and Oceanis International BV for EUR 14.9m.  


                                                                 
7 These properties, originally referred to as the Raiffeisen portfolio and later the “regional office portfolio” are currently held 
for sale. Based on 2017 valuation reports conducted by Cushman Wakefield prior to the NEPI Rockcastle merger, the majority 
are as yet unsold.

CEERES is another CEEIF subsidiary: 


 
Figure 29 Central and Eastern European Real-estate Shareholdings BV drimble.nl profile10 


While not known about publicly at the time of these transactions, CEEIF was partially funded through 


fraudulently obtained funds embezzled from US commodity futures business, Peregrine Financial Group, by its 


CEO and owner Russell Wasendorf Sr. 


 
Figure 30 US CFTC v. Peregrine Financial Group & Russell R. Wasendorf Sr.11 


Readers should be aware of the Peregrine Financial Group fraud, which resulted Peregrine’s July 2012 closure 


after being placed under investigation for a US$200m shortfall in customer funds12. Peregrine’s chief executive, 


Russell R. Wasendorf Sr., was arrested and charged for several offences regarding the CFTC. 


Filing’s by Wasendorf Sr.’s receiver Michael M. Eidelman show that Wasendorf Sr. held an undivided beneficial 


interest in Price Nominees Limited, which in turn held 11.3% of CEEIF.

Wasendorf Sr. also made and received payments to and from CEEIF: ostensibly investments and returns on such 


which are listed below. Note that some of these investments are direct from Peregrine Financial Group accounts! 


 
Figure 32 Viceroy Analysis 


Filings from the Wasendorf proceedings as well as another case dispute between CEEIF’s founders show that 


the business was funded through a combination of inappropriately obtained funds and high-interest loans.

UniCredit Tiriac Bank was also a creditor of CEEIF, having supplied further funds for investment in property: 


 
Figure 38 US CFTC v. Peregrine Financial Group & Russell R. Wasendorf Sr. 


Upon discussions with lenders, the Receivers administering Peregrine asked for relief from obtaining further 


value from CEEIF, which they considered was “insolvent”, despite concluding that loans made to CEEIF were 


embezzled directly from Peregrine. 


Further, CEEIF’s finances were in such a state that Recievers had serious concerns regarding the integrity of 


CEEIF’s calculations. 


 
Figures 39, 40 & 41 US CFTC v. Peregrine Financial Group & Wasendorf Sr.
Viceroy Research Group 23 viceroyresearch.org 


Given the extent of Pascariu’s involvement in CEEIF, it is unrealistic for stakeholders to assume Pascariu was 


unaware of the fraudulent matter in which the company was funded. There were only a handful of 


shareholders involved in the business, and the bank at which Pascariu was Chairman was a lender to the business 


despite receivers later expressing “serious concerns about the integrity of CEEIF’s calculations” and its unaudited 


financial accounts.  


Viceroy believe the sale of Romanian assets by CEEIF to NEPI was a deliberate and conscious method of trying 


to limit future liabilities by divesting and distributing asset values as fast as possible. 


NEPI investors are further reminded that the sale of these assets occurred at the bottom of a Romanian property 


cycle. Why else would these transactions have taken place? 


5. Resignation of Corneliu Dan Pascariu 
NEPI Rockcastle chairman Pascariu announced his retirement and that he would not stand for re-election at the 


AGM on July 12, 2018. 


 
Figure 42 NEPI Rockcastle changes to the board of directors16 


This is curious because Pascariu had only recently put himself up for re-election on April 30, 2018 and was 


previously ratified as Chairman after the Rockcastle acquisition in mid-2017.

6. Fundamentally overpriced 
It would be remiss to exclude a valuation of NEPI within this report, however it is worth noting that this valuation 


is independent of the evidence presented in this report. Given the potential extent of financial 


misrepresentation, any valuation should be taken with a grain of salt.  


Given the potentially vast misrepresentations in NEPI’s financial accounts, we believe a 


valuation based on reported figures would not even represent a baseline downside. 


If NEPI were to trade in line with peers, Viceroy believe its shares should trade between 13%-25% lower based 


on price-to-book and dividend yield respectively.  


Assuming NEPI Rockcastle’s financials were indeed clean – which does not appear to be the case – the company 


trades at sales, earnings, book and dividend multiples vastly exceeding its competitors.

Finding comparable REITs to NEPI is a difficult process given the geographical spread of their properties. We 


believe the closest comparable entities are Echo Polska (Echo) and Globe Trade Centre (GTC), which manage 


portfolios substantially contained within Eastern Europe. NEPI trades at a price/book premium to both Echo and 


GTC. Echo is expected to pay substantially larger dividends of 9.27% (32% higher). 


In comparison with all major South African listed REITs above: 


▪ NEPI trades at an average price/book premium of 15% 


▪ NEPI is expected to deliver the lowest dividend yield of all South African peers, 24% below average 


▪ NEPI trades at the highest sales ratios (with the exception of outlier Fortress). 


In comparison with ‘safer’ European REIT’s, NEPI Rockcastle trades at the highest end on sales and earnings and 


at a large book/value premium. 


This is made more obscure given the majority of NEPI’s dividends are paid out in scrip. In 


reality, the cash distribution (by consequence of poor cash generation) to NEPI 


shareholders is minimal.

Were NEPI to trade in-line with peers we believe shareholders would face a 25% downside, however we are 


unable to quantify a target price given the suspected extent of financial misrepresentation and accordingly 


believe the company’s shares are worth substantially less. 


6.1. Compounding premiums 
This is without taking into account the compounding premium problem with REIT’s, which was explored 


extremely thoroughly in 36One’s research into several south African REITs:  


“The true attraction of mortgage trusts lies in their ability to generate capital gains for their 


shareholders by selling additional shares at a premium over book value. If a trust with a book value of $10 and a 


12% return on equity doubles its equity by selling additional shares at $20, the book value jumps to $13.33 and 


per share earnings go from $1.20 to $1.60. 


Investors are willing to pay a premium because of the high yield and the expectation of per-share 


earnings growth. The higher the premium, the easier it is for the trust to fulfill this expectation. The process is a 


self-reinforcing one. Once it gets under way, the trust can show a steady growth in per-share earnings despite 


the fact that it distributes practically all its earnings as dividends. Investors who participate in the process early 


enough can enjoy the compound benefits of a high return on equity, a rising book value, and a rising premium 


over book value.” 


- The case for mortgage trusts, George Soros 


The process described above leads to REIT’s trading at a premium, which is not in itself a problem. However, 


when shares in REIT 1 are held by REIT 2 any buyer of shares in REIT 2 is now paying the premium twice: once 


for the share of REIT 2 and again for the inflation of REIT 2’s book by the premium of REIT 1’s shares. This is again 


compounded when a group of REITs own sizable shares in each other  


The practical upshot of the above exploit is that investors who get in early in the timeline can make outsized 


gains. This was clearly in play with NEPI Rockcastle which sits at the bottom of the Fortress/Resilient REIT 


network. 


The above-mentioned phenomena of REIT’s generation of capital gains is only limited by regulatory oversight 


and the willingness of a market to buy newly issued shares. Normally investors are willing to pay a moderate 


price premium in exchange for decent yields however we believe the REIT space in South Africa to be so heavily 


manipulated that no legitimate buyers remain.

7. Conclusion 
Based on our research we believe NEPI Rockcastle’s investors are largely in the dark regarding the true nature 


and performance of the company’s operations. The company has failed to keep up its end of the bargain, with 


filings bearing no resemblance or relationship to local filings for its Romanian Portfolio.   


Viceroy believes NEPI Rockcastle carries significant risks for the following reasons: 


1. The discrepancy between the company’s accounts and local filings; 


2. The manner and outcome of the Rockcastle acquisition, and;  


3. The company’s involvement with entities associated with fraud in the case of CEEIF and leadership by 


similarly involved individuals (Pascariu). 


Further, we are uncertain as to whether the issues with NEPI’s Romanian operations are present in any other 


geographies. Our investigations into this remain ongoing. We recommend investors remain cautious regarding 


the company until: 


1. A review of the company and its operations is conducted by a fully independent third-party; 


2. The company provides investors provided a full historical reconciliation of local accounts to company 


filings; 


3. The company continues to provide reconciliation of local accounts to company filings. 


Were NEPI to trade in-line with peers we believe shareholders would face a 25% downside, however we are 


unable to quantify a target price given the suspected extent of financial misrepresentation and accordingly 


believe the company’s shares are worth substantially less.
