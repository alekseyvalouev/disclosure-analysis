The Bell Tolls For Deer Consumer Products
Oct. 10, 2012 8:37 PM ET48 comments
by: Alfred Little


On 10/9/12, Deer Consumer Products (DEER - Halted since 8/13/12) filed an 8-K (here)
disclosing that on 10/2/12 NASDAQ made a strongly worded determination to delist DEER
for the following reasons:


1. DEER made "false and misleading disclosures regarding the operational status of its
manufacturing facilities in Yangjiang, China";


2. DEER failed "to provide complete responses to NASDAQ Staff's questions regarding
the Company's customers, suppliers and shipping providers"; and


3. DEER's "involvement in a scheme to illicitly transfer corporate funds to a group of
stockbrokers through a bogus consulting contract."


Regarding the first reason, NASDAQ's assertion that DEER lied about the operational
status of its Yangjiang manufacturing facilities affirms my findings in a Seeking Alpha
Editor's Pick article I published (here) on 8/14/12 which concluded that DEER's old factory
was completely idle and its new factory was operating at less than 5% of capacity.


Regarding the second reason, I believe NASDAQ's questions concerning DEER's
customers relate to previous allegations that DEER exaggerated its sales. I recently
engaged a team of market researchers to conduct random channel checks of the retail
sales of DEER's largest reported customer, Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Limited.
Based on the results of these visits to Gome flagship and other major market stores I
concluded that DEER's sales to Gome are substantially lower than reported in its SEC
filings. The following is a summary of the findings:


1. All 24 Gome stores interviewed reported declining sales, averaging well under 10 units
per week.


2. 6 Gome stores reported a lack of product supply from DEER, which is consistent with
my findings that DEER's factories are idled.


3. 14 stores attributed the weak sales to a lack of brand recognition.
4. 8 stores felt DEER does not care about its business with Gome and provides no retail


support.
5. 5 stores complained that DEER refused to pay sales commissions as promised.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/917371-the-bell-tolls-for-deer-consumer-products 2/12


Regarding NASDAQ's third reason for the delisting, financial investigative journalist Roddy
Boyd first broke the story in December of 2011 (here) of DEER's illicit transfer of corporate
funds to pump its stock in 2010 and Bill Singer of Forbes in February of 2012 reported on
FINRA's settlement of the matter (here). DEER's stock price history shows that buyers
tried very hard to keep the stock above $11 for four months prior and one week after my
original report in March of 2011.


Another clue is that NASDAQ's delisting decision came one day after DEER's Audit
Committee Chairman submitted his resignation (see 8-K here). Despite DEER's claim that
the resignation was not due to any dispute with the company, the timing certainly raises
suspicions.


I conclude that NASDAQ was not a moment too soon to delist DEER, putting an end to
DEER's long history of false and misleading disclosures to its investors that I first exposed
over one and a half years ago. I am preparing to file a whistleblower report to the SEC
showing how DEER's management, directors, promoters, auditor, and lawyers should all
be held accountable for investor losses.


Many investors rightfully question why it took regulators so long to take action against
DEER. I believe there are several reasons. First of all, DEER categorically denied my
allegations and commenced a costly and aggressive legal campaign to silence my
opinion. DEER then engaged its Wall Street analysts to visit and defend the company.
None of this worked as DEER's stock price sunk lower and lower, after DEER failed to
refute each new allegation.


DEER received a major boost from Silvercorp Metals (NYSE:SVM) CEO Rui Feng's fight
against a "conspiracy" of short sellers. On 9/19/11 SVM announced (here) that, "We look
forward to co-operating with Deer and all other victims of Alfred Little." The next day The
Globe and Mail reported (here) that SVM was "teaming" with DEER to fight short sellers
and quoted Rui Feng stating: "Our lawyers are now working with Deer's lawyers to launch
a lawsuit together to subpoena these people behind the scenes." [Emphasis added]


Who are the so-called "victims" of "conspiring" short sellers that DEER and SVM teamed
against and swore to avenge? In light of NASDAQ's decision to delist DEER for lying
about the operational status of its factories, failing to provide complete responses about its
customers, and illicitly transferring corporate funds to a group of stockbrokers, the only
true victims are the investors victimized by companies such as DEER. The only real
conspiracy was conducted by DEER and SVM to silence their critics; critics who once
again have proven to be correct.

Disclosure: I am short SVM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Thanks for this great article. I had purchased shares of DEER this past Spring. I did not know what had happened
until I read your article on August 14th which included the investigators pictures of the on site facility (empty as could
be). Investing in Chinese companies does have it's drawbacks......

C'mon Mr. Carnes you are really stretching it by trying to make out that SVM is in any way associated with DEER's
issues. Mr. Feng's statement was made in the "heat" of the short and distort "letters" you guys put out in August and
Sept 2011. There are NO COURT documents showing that SVM and DEER worked together. You have backtracked
on most of your issues with SVM, you should be clear about this one as well.


11 Oct 2012, 04:00 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Rui Feng says a lot of nonsense in the "heat" of the moment as you suggest. For example,
in response to The Globe and Mail's allegation that Silvercorp paid for a Chinese police investigation to
silence its critics, Rui Feng stated:


“These are bad people for me. They are my enemy. I am raped. I tell police. Right? The police sometimes do
contact me and with us. We are victims. We are big taxpayers in the Luoyang County,” Mr. Feng said in a
telephone interview from Beijing.

Author’s reply »  I am confident I am right about SVM. Aside, I do not think its fair for short sellers to be
punished in any way for being wrong. Analysts who are wrong year after year are never published. They are
just consider inept. You should only be punished for lying and acting maliciously.


I've been right on every stock I wrote about. Even if I were wrong on 1, out of over a dozen, there should be
no punishment unless I lied and made stuff up, which as I told The Globe and Mail would be Stupid because it
would ruin my track record I spent the last 3 years building.

My god you smell of desperation, sickening but true..


 
Casey Research's posted a comment yesterday: Bottom Line: SVM holders should RELAX! They give no
credence to these latest lawsuits. One has to wonder exactly WHY short sellers (if that's what they are) are
pushing these suits that have, for the most part, already been discredited. Nevertheless, fear is a powerful
motivator, and you may be able to buy at ridiculously low prices if this negative hype catches fire. For my
money, tho', the prices are good enough to make substantial buys right now.


Anyway, here's what Casey's Research's team had to say about it:


"The lawsuit is largely based on past allegations from the short sellers, and names Silvercorp and three
senior executives, including CEO Rui Feng. It claims the company overstated their financial results from the
Ying mine, causing investors to buy the stock at “artificially inflated and distorted” prices.


A few points. We’ve commented extensively on these allegations before, including Jeff Clark’s site visit to
Ying within a month of them surfacing in 2011, and found they had no merit. We’ll note that all analysts that
were on site came to the same conclusion, and an independent audit from KPMG, a highly respected auditing
firm, found no discrepancies. The only additional charge in the lawsuit is that the company reportedly
influenced Chinese authorities to arrest and harass researchers working for the short-sellers, including

funding a police investigation, and then tried to cover it up. There appears to be nothing that hasn’t already
been made public and subsequently rejected by most reputable analysts.


Keep in mind that management did lower the grade and the Resource at Ying last year. Part of this was the
result of a new mining plan; with some of the veins trending deeper, an adjustment was necessary. But the
lower grade – which is still high relative to other silver mines and very profitable – is permanent, and in the
eyes of some could justify the short sellers' accusations. Many of these allegations, however, show either a
misunderstanding of mining issues or came from short sellers themselves. Bottom line, we give no credence
to the lawsuit itself.


The primary negative is that this could be a drag on the stock. Some investors could get scared off and sell,
and we'll point out that SVM has fallen 10.7% in the three days since the lawsuit was announced. We don’t
know how low the stock could fall, but it could be significant if this gets a lot of press and begins feeding on
itself. Further, we don’t know how long this process could drag out; obviously the longer it goes, the longer
our shares could be impacted.


CHANGE IN RECOMMENDATION: HOLD. Since it’s unknown how much and for how long this could affect
the stock, the prudent thing to do is to place it on hold. It’s possible this could end up being a great buying
opportunity – or the beginning of another long and torturous process. Given the uncertainty, we recommend
no more buying until this gets sorted out and the winds for the company shift.


Those who recently bought at $5 should not panic and sell. The company continues operating at full capacity,
paying dividends (one of the highest among primary silver producers), and will begin seeing cash flow from
the big new GC mine by Q2."

WHAT IS THE OTHER "PART" of the explanation that Casey never mentions? It's the fact that the
management dramatically CUT the Resource of the SGX mine at the core of my allegations.

I don't know the DEER story and you may be right here.  
But what about SVM? After taking a hit it has bottomed in May, July and August and risen +37%, now giving up some
with general metals weakness. Have there been new developments there to account for their stock appreciation?


11 Oct 2012, 10:40 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  SVM stock tracks SLV almost trade for trade. Unlike SCEI or DEER, I have never called
SVM a fraud (search all my old reports to confirm that). I raised a long list of red flags that SVM management
never adequately addressed. Instead, SVM teamed with DEER and SCEI to shut down my research
organization. The Globe and Mail found that SVM paid for the investigation and arrest of my researchers in
China. All that accomplished for SVM was "revenge". It also convinced me that SVM is hiding something Big.
I believe The truth will soon come out. SVM is a time bomb.

First off - you keep spouting about the Globe and Mail. The globe and Mail is just a shill and reports what it thinks is a
story INCLUDING your initial "$1.3 billion Fraud on SVM" as well as R Feng's replies etc....


Second - the China researcher thing: I have read and re read the story about your guys. It sounds like they indeed
were on the wrong side of Chinese authorities. The same thing could happen (if not worse) in Mexico, Peru, Africa.
Stuff happens all the time in business - ask Walmart. Ask Apple. I do hope your guys are safe - they would be cactus
fertilizer if they tried that stuff in some counties.


Third back to SVM - So you now say SVM is not a fraud, but you are short and you think SVM is a "time bomb" why?
production? grades? accounting?

Mr. Carnes: I respect your work on the frauds and Chinese RTO's but I think you picked the wrong Company with
SVM. SVM is a Canadian business invested in China - they climbed up the hard slow way.


11 Oct 2012, 11:50 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Bowmac,


I had nothing to do with the "1.3 billion Fraud" article. That was another short seller unrelated to me. I had no
knowledge of that report prior to when SVM publicized it. I have not, to date, used the word fraud to describe
SVM. However, as I said I am much more suspicious of SVM today than a year ago.


If SVM indeed paid for the Chinese police to investigate and arrest my researchers, then SVM stock is a time
bomb. SVM would then be a Canadian business that violated FCPA, CFPO and RICO laws. Rui Feng would
have to resign and then this company comes undone.

It's your arrested employees word about SVM paying for the Chinese investigation. The little proof that has
been provided could very well be forged or manipulated.

Guilt by association...hmmmm. Have you really run out of ways to attack SVM.?  
Your findings on SVM have been proven false again and again and yet you persist in attacking them. Your local
hoodlu..errr, market researchers have failed to find any evidence against SVM and yet you keep on trying. I have got
to admire your tenacity which appears to be unfortunately counterbalanced by a complete lack of ethics. How is your
short trade against SVM doing by the way?

OK fine, I will take you for your word that you did not say SVM is a Fraud. As for SVM's future - we shall see. I am
long SVM and think the company is undervalued. You are short and have your opinion.


Q2 will come out in the next 3 weeks - the market will expect a better number than Q1, that is for sure.


Good luck to all.

for Q2. Offsetting this is the fact Silver prices have rebounded (killing my short). Expenses and capex will
continue to be very high.

I recently had the privilege of meeting ‘Alfred’ and his family for a meal near his home. I’m a seasoned China
analyst/investor and was intrigued to learn about his experience.


Our conversations were privileged so I’m not going to ‘spill beans’ as it were, but will make a couple of points for
readers on this board:


1. Holding a long positioning SVM is extremely foolish, in my view. If one is bullish on precious metals, buy the metal,
or a basket of other miners. These are better options. ‘Alfred’ has done real work on getting to know this company and
has, to date, only disclosed a small portion of the evidence against SVM management in online forums. Keep in mind
a member of his team remains in the custody of a corrupted police force, and others have be assaulted, threatened,
and continue to be followed by sanctioned thugs.


2. Rui Feng’s wisest and most responsible move at this point is to resign, before that option is taken from him. In fact
if he wants to hurt the shorts that is his best move. At this point, by not launching an independent investigation and/or
demanding Feng’s resignation, SVM’s board has become complicit with criminal activity, in my view. Ugly, ugly, ugly
…

why did deer pay out $3,000,000 in dividends if they are a fraud? 
will deer issue 3rd quarter earnings on November 9.? 
deer appointed a new director and issued an 8k immediately. doesn't this mean something? 
isn't deer going through a lot of trouble for nothing? 
what say you? 
ps: why would they have 2 plants with a third one being built? 
boy none of this adds up.

I know you are busy but I would like your expert opinion to my previous questions on deer. 
why pay dividend ? why build new plants? why file a 8k and name new director if they didn't care to be listed? 
new question. are they (deer) working to answer questions to maintain there listing? 
as always, thank you for your hard work and expertise.your insight would be appreciated.

Author’s reply »  DEER paid a dividend in the past (out of money raised from investors) no doubt to prop up
their stock price. As their business has declined, they stopped paying dividends. STALOFF was the only US
based director. Now there is legally no one investors can pursue.

DEER : thank you for your reply. it makes sense. 
If it is true, they have no debt, wont a sale of plant and equipment allow some money to go back to stock holders
when the company is sold. Annalist have visited the plant and they were building product and selling it. The machines
and equipment were in place. 
what say you? 
thank you for your valued input.

Author’s reply »  Most Chinese companies fail to disclose large bank loans, the proceeds of which are often invested
in real estate or other pet projects. DEER's assets may turn out to be heavily encumbered. Furthermore, with the
delisting why should DEER do anything to benefit U.S. shareholders? Few other Chinese companies ever have.

Mr. Carnes, how many aliases do you have? I would like to see the list. I know some of them from the Silvercorp
lawsuit, but I suspect others and at least one other as a Seeking Alpha contributor.

I saw a profile for Alfred Little on another website that said that you have over 35 years of experience in investing. Mr.
Carnes, you must have started at a early age because I think that you are 40-41 years old. Am I wrong or do you just
exaggerate everything? I see that you dissolved your companies in Las Vegas so that the USA has no legal
jurisdiction over your so called reports. How's that tax haven island nation working out?

"Monkey King" is another one of his names. He (Monkey King) wrote his one and only post 6 weeks ago in 14
Octobre to praise and defend Alfred Short Little.

I was mistaken. he was born in 1973 so he is 39 years old. It looks like he may have overstated all his
accomplishments. Phi Beta Kappa? It seems that the Alfred Little website has stated his experience of 35
plus years for the life of the site; so he must have been hired by Deloitte? at birth. I wonder if he ever worked
at Deloitte.


I think that he is small potatoes in the financial mafia organization. Is he still working for Muddy Waters? I
think that he would be considered lower to mid management in any reputable organization. He's just a hit man
in the financial mafia. And maybe the organizations fall guy to take the heat? It seems that he may have
fronted several shell company organizations. Maybe even utilizes a non-profit charity to launder tax free
money. Anyway, he took his assets to Dominica, a island nation tax haven.

Alfred - I wish I had read your articles before buying DEER. Quick question for you - do you happen to have a sense
as to when the stock will actually be de-listed so that I can get rid of it? Thanks!

Author’s reply »  Unfortunately I have no idea of the delisting timing. The delisting has certainly taken longer
than most. DEER is extremely litigious, so no doubt NASDAQ is trying to be professional about delisting this
fraud to avoid setting off another frivolous lawsuit.

Stock is trading today at 40 cents, in case anyone cares. If management loved the company so much, why don't they
buy it?

Trading at $0.007/share last time I checked....if you can sell it.
