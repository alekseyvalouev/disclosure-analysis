FAB Universal: Glaring Contradictions In Its 2013 10-K
Jul. 11, 2014 5:17 PM ET58 comments
by: Alfred Little


Summary


On July 16th, 2014, FAB Universal (FU) will make an oral appeal to the NYSE’s April
28th, 2014 delisting decision.


Presumably FAB will try to explain how its secret $16.3 million Chinese bond offering
was not a sufficiently bad corporate governance-lapse to merit a delisting.


FAB will also have to explain how its decision to downgrade its auditor somehow
made sense given its admitted lack of internal control over its Chinese subsidiaries.


In today’s report, I analyze and expose contradictions in FAB’s new description of its
media kiosk business and question why FAB’s former auditor was unable to perform
cash balance confirmations.


On July 16th, 2014, FAB Universal (NYSEMKT:FU) will make an oral appeal to the
NYSE's April 28th, 2014, delisting decision. Presumably, FAB will try to explain how its
secret $16.3 million Chinese bond offering was not a sufficiently bad corporate
governance-lapse to merit a delisting. FAB will also have to explain how its decision to
downgrade its auditor somehow made sense given its admitted lack of internal control
over its Chinese subsidiaries. On top of all this, FAB will have to convince the NYSE that
its contradictory disclosures in its belatedly filed 2013 10-K finally paint a true picture of
FAB's Chinese business. In today's report, I analyze and expose contradictions in FAB's
new description of its media kiosk business and question why FAB's former auditor was
unable to perform cash balance confirmations


Is FAB a Provider and Operator of Media Kiosks or a Seller of Technology
Licenses?


In Note 1 to FAB's 2012 audited financials in its 2012 10-K FAB described its core Chinese
business as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 2/29


"[FAB]'s products and services are primarily distributed through its flagship stores,
wholesale services, proprietary 'FAB' kiosks, and online virtual stores. FAB kiosks,
located in high-traffic areas of office buildings, shopping malls, retail stores and
airports, are self-service terminals that provide a range of entertainment and
consumer applications."


"FAB Media was incorporated as a private enterprise in the PRC in April 2008 with a
registered capital of RMB 1 million. FAB Media is primarily engaged in operating and
providing proprietary multimedia kiosks for music downloads, information exchange
and advertising." (Page 49)


FAB claimed to be responsible for the placement and location of the media kiosks, which
FAB refers to as "our Kiosks" in the following risk factor related to FAB's business
disclosed in the 2012 10-K:


"Our failure to maintain existing relationships or obtain new relationships that
allow us to place our Kiosks in desirable locations would harm our business
and prospects."


"Our ability to generate revenues from Kiosks depends largely upon our ability to
provide licensees networks of Kiosks in desirable locations throughout major urban
areas in China. This, in turn, requires that we develop and maintain business
relationships with real estate developers, landlords, property managers,
hypermarkets, retailers, and other businesses and locations in which we are
provided space for our facilities. If we fail to maintain our relationships with landlords
and property managers, or if a significant number of our existing Kiosks placement
agreements are terminated or not renewed or if we fail to maintain our relationship
with our location provider, licensees may find our networks unattractive and may not
renew agreement after the termination of five years agreement, which would cause
our revenues to decline and our business and prospects to deteriorate." (Page 13)


Recall that in my December 9th, 2013 report, I announced that I was only able to locate 20
of the 3,954 media kiosks FAB claimed to have installed in Beijing alone. All FAB had to
do was publish a detailed list of its Beijing media kiosk locations. FAB did not do this and I
believe FAB could not do this because the kiosks simply do not exist.


So rather than simply publishing the locations of the media kiosks, FAB revised its entire
business model in its delinquently filed 2013 10-K (filed June 27th, 2014). FAB removed
all the previous references to the number of media kiosks installed or deployed in China.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 3/29


Instead, FAB now states that the kiosk business merely involves the sale of "FAB brand
licenses:"


"FAB has grown its business through its licensing and regional agent programs and
has sold 17,944 brand licenses, which allows the licensees to use FAB's brand on
the kiosks."


"FAB generates revenues from the sale of FAB Brand licenses, as well as
advertising, and FAB membership card sales." (Page 32)


This seems to be a bold act of recanting the previously disclosed business model (in every
single public announcement related to Wizzard's acquisition of FAB up until now) and
recasting it in a new, albeit equally dubious direction. The first hint of this change in
business description appeared in FAB's December 10th, 2013 announcement that its
Board of Directors had taken the time to review thousands of "licenses to operate kiosks."
In this same press release, FAB also reiterated that 3,954 media kiosks had been
deployed in Beijing. With the absence of any mention of deployments in the new 10-K,
FAB has taken an unconvincing but decisive step toward being able to disavow any
knowledge of the location of the kiosks. The bottom line is that "FAB brand licenses" for
kiosks that FAB cannot prove exist are simply meaningless. Where are the kiosks?


Turning back to FAB's historical filings, let's not forget that FAB in fact described its media
kiosk licensing program in great detail in the June 1st, 2012 Proxy, which again showed
that FAB was in complete control of the location and operation of all the media kiosks:


"FAB licensing program is a merchant program that binds the FAB and each small
investor or vendor. Under this program and associated contract, both licensor and
licensee take their joint-business obligations as follows:


1. The licensee pays for FAB Kiosk and other equipment and fixtures while the
licensor (FAB Media) is responsible for the complete set-up of each FAB outlet
from the location selection to construction or conversion, remodeling and
equipment installation.


2. All FAB outlets will be owned by the licensee, but supervised by a designated
management company - Beijing Huzhong Culture Co., Ltd ("Huzhong Culture") in
accordance with FAB's distinctive business formats.


3. FAB kiosks are linked to the server station through the internet to remain
updated. Such maintenances are operated by Huzhong Culture." (Page 35)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 4/29


The 2012 10-K also confirmed that the media kiosks are networked:


"The content is contained on internal hard drives within each terminal thereby
eliminating bandwidth download problems associated with the internet and providing
content owners with a secure closed system for digital file protection and accurate
transparent accounting. The terminals are updated and monitored via web-linked
electronic communications." (Page 29)


Based on these and other 2012 disclosures in its SEC filings, FAB explicitly portrayed as
fact that it owns and/or operates a vast network of thousands of media kiosks. FAB's
licensees invested in thousands of the media kiosks, which were located in places FAB
selected, built out, and maintained. FAB (via a related party known as Huzhong)
supervised the media kiosks in operation, and the media kiosks were networked to a
central server.


However, in its delinquently filed 2013 10-K, FAB makes no mention of the kiosks being
"networked" to a central server and even removes all mention of FAB's provision of
"desirable locations" for kiosk placements "throughout major urban areas of China," as it
repeatedly stated in the past filings and public announcements.


Further, FAB makes a deceitful attempt to "backdate" the 2013 10-K business description
changes to 2010:


"Prior to 2010, the Company's business model consisted of brand licensing and
agreements that allowed for the purchase and operation of kiosks under the FAB
brand. After 2010, the Company only sold license agreements which were outside of
Beijing." (Page 3)


FAB's purported 2010 change to its business model is contradicted by my research that
found that as recently as late 2013, FAB's Beijing kiosk franchising sales office was still
offering media kiosks to Chinese investors on a turnkey basis - whereby FAB was
responsible for placing and operating the kiosks and guaranteed franchisees a positive
return on their investments.


FAB also suspiciously discloses in the 2013 10-K that only "some kiosks" have media
download capabilities:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 5/29


"The Kiosks provide a variety of functions, and some provide multiple functions. The
great majority of the kiosks generate revenue from the sale of advertising. Some
kiosks are ATM style terminals where consumers can download content directly to
their cell phones, memory sticks or other mobile storage devices. Others provide
directions or other services or offer coupons or other goods for sale." (Page 3)


Contrast the 2013 10-K statement with FAB's June 1st, 2012 proxy that described the
standard kiosk as having media download capabilities:


"The standard FAB kiosks have the following features:


· The user can review and select a variety of licensed music, movies, mobile phone
ringtones and games from a touch screen.


· The user can stream the selected content or titles to different kinds of portable
devices, such as, MP3, MP4, memory cards, hard disks, flash disks, mobile
phones." (Page 35)


FAB's new claim that only "some kiosks" are media kiosks indicates to me that the true
number of media kiosks in Beijing is not much more than the 20 I found in my
investigation. This further explains FAB's reluctance to disclose the media kiosk locations.


The Auditor Downgrade - Why Did Management Not Let Friedman Verify $100
Million Purported Cash Balance?


Through April 30th, 2014, the date of FAB's dismissal of its auditor (Friedman):


"(A) due to the time requirements placed on management because of an internal
investigation (the "Internal Investigation") being conducted by an outside
independent consulting firm at the same time as the audit, Company personnel were
not readily available to assist Friedman in completion of certain audit procedures, (B)
certain requests for additional documentation and procedures were not complied
with, and (C) Friedman was unwilling to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements prior to the completion of the Internal Investigation and prior to
the confirmation of bank balances at certain depository institutions in China,…"


From this disclosure, it is apparent that as of April 30th, 2014, Friedman had not verified
FAB's December 31st, 2013 bank balances of $99,077,811. The excuse that FAB's
management personnel were unavailable to assist Friedman to verify bank balances is

simply absurd and insulting to U.S. investors and regulators.


Conclusion


FAB has been given a full 8 months to disclose the locations of the media kiosks. Instead,
FAB tossed aside the facts in its previous disclosures and overhauled its entire business
description to focus on "FAB Brand licenses" that make the existence of the actual kiosks
completely unverifiable. FAB further called its financials into question by downgrading its
auditor, during a period of intense scrutiny of FAB's failed internal controls, and would not
assist its former auditor to verify nearly $100 million of purported bank balances.


Outlook


I continue to fully expect that FAB will be delisted immediately following the appeal hearing
after which I will cover my short on the OTC exchange. Delisted Chinese companies
typically have market capitalizations of well under $20 million, implying an OTC trading
price target of less than $1 per share. If FAB's stock is somehow allowed to continue its
NYSE listing, I will short more shares and of course continue my investigation to further
expose the truth about FAB.

I appreciate the analysis, but I'm not quite clear what the article is supposed to achieve.


The stock traded a grand total of 100 shares today, which is a rare busy day for it. It seems it hasn't traded a single
share for months until today.


What exactly are we supposed to do with the knowledge you have bestowed on us? I'm not even talking about
liquidity here; there is no bid to pick up any shares we wish to sell. Perhaps you can create a market by offering to buy
back some of the shares you are short, allowing others to initiate their own short position.

Lucky?
This is just a rehash of the Carnes Scam (FAB is a fraud because it's Kiosks are unverified and those that exist are
loaded with pirated content). The entire argument was always bogus (10K Kiosks existed before the 2012 proxy and
the you can't assume just because one selected Kiosk had pirated material they all do).


But the Carnes Scam was never intended to have legs (who would believe the story about the "chick with the
business card" for more then one day?), it was a short term attack on a Chinese stock that just made a dramatic jump
from 3 to 10 over a a few short weeks.


It had the desired effect, the share price tanked to around 5 on the initial release of the Carnes Scam. But the then the
shorts discovered the "secret" bond and the short term game plan was tossed out the window.


No short really believed the Carnes Scam, and it was never designed to have legs. But the discovery of the bond
changed everything. It was the "smoking gun" to prove FAB was in fact a complete fraud. Why else would FAB cover
up a 16M dollar bond? Clearly this was the nest egg that was funding the fraud. With it all the pieces came together.


Armed with that knowledge the short piled on FAB regardless of the share price....and why not? It was going to be
delisted and trade on the pink sheets for pennies on the dollar as soon as the NYSE was presented with proof of the

bond.....just like all the other Chinese frauds.


Shares short exploded from around 200K pre Carnes Scam to over 3M as those that fell for the initial Carnes Scam
were now joined by the bond crowd.


Then the shorts broke the news of the bond and demanded the NYSE halt it's trading and subject it to delisting
proceedings.


To make a long story short (no pun intended), 8 months have passed since FAB was halted and company went dark.
In the meantime FAB announces they had hired an outside firm to investigate them (standard procedure these days)
while the NYSE began the process of delisting them (as the shorts demanded, but not for the bond but because they
were late with their SEC filings...on 10K).


Then something interesting happened no short expected. FAB filed their 10K out of the blue after being dark for 8
months. Not only did they file, but the explosion in revenue and earnings that initially moved the share price from 3 to
10 in the first place was not only on going but accelerating. The FAB that was halted had 20M cash in the bank but
the FAB of the new 10K had 100M and was growing revenues north of 50%. This was the shorts worse nightmare.


They expected FAB to stay dark and eventually get delisted, not come out with both guns blazing. Turns out the bond
they saw as their "golden ticked" just turned into their worst nightmare.


So here we are. This article is Carnes first shot at FAB hoping/praying he can create enough doubt to get clear of this
trade without going broke...because he knows FAB will not only keep their listing after this hearing but probably begin
trading shortly thereafter.


I encourage all day traders to stay tuned to this channel, because once it starts trading there will be a mad rush of
shorts for the exits. All those that shorted with impunity (believing the bond was their golden ticked) are now stuck in a
stock with over 5 dollars a shares in cash trading at a P/E of one with a 50% growth rate.

Author’s reply »  So Lucky, do you have any idea where the 3,954 media kiosks are in Beijing, or how many
of those are actually media kiosks, now that FAB disclosed that only "some" are media kiosks? Any idea why
FAB won't disclose the locations?


12 Jul 2014, 10:49 PM


Lucky?
All we know for sure is that about 10K (out of 16K total) of the Kiosks existed prior to the 2012 Proxy. Digging
into FAB's website it's clear most of those were ATM type machines, no where near the level of sophistication
of post 2012 ones. FAB is guilty of misleading investors (whether intentional or not I'm not sure) that they are
were the same. The new 10K filing is an attempt to become more transparent. I think it's legitimate for you do
criticize FAB for misleading investors in the first place, but then hypocritical of you to follow that up by also
being critical of their attempts to remedy their errors.


As for the number of Kiosks in Beijing, FAB addressed that directly in their last PR prior to shutting down all
communication (other then SEC filings):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 9/29


"As of September 30, 2013, 16,820 licenses have been sold, of which 3,954 have been issued for the
placement of kiosks in Beijing; all of the 3,954 kiosks in Beijing have been deployed. As part of its preliminary
review, the Board has examined data concerning the licenses to operate kiosks entered into by the Company
as of September 30, 2013, and has re-verified 12,866 licenses. Verification of the remaining licenses will
continue until all licenses have been reviewed. "


As for why FAB won't disclose their locations the answer is they haven't released any news, period, other
than SEC filings in the last 8 months. IMO when FAB does open the PR gates the list of Kiosks will be
released....probably with the release of the Loeb report. To say they have not done so in 8 months is true, but
at the same time they've had a plethora of good news they kept to themselves also (see the 10K for plenty of
examples....including the 100M in cash) in that time. 
I also think FAB may have inadvertently laid the ground work for future attacks by shorts. Both FAB and NQ
were pretty much accused of being frauds at the same time. NQ continued trading and continued to issue
PR's updating their business. FAB was halted, and shut down all communications with shareholders. NQ
shareholders have faced a wild ride over the last 8 months (down from 25 to 7, back up to 21, now back down
to 4) forcing many long term holders to sell just from exhaustion. FAB shareholders have complained, as have
the shorts, of FAB's halt but almost everyone expected it be banished to the pink sheets as a fraud in the end.
After all, I know of no Chinese company halted for this long with a story that ended up good for shareholders.
Yet this is exactly what appears to be happening with FAB. Out of no where they produce an "unqualified"
10K (making NQ jealous) with spectacular numbers (even better than those that drove the share price from 3
to 10 in the first place.


So maybe this is the new game plan for Chinese companies accused of fraud. It certainly makes your job far
more difficult. It traps longs, sure, but it also traps shorts for a long period of time giving the company almost
unlimited time to reply. In the end shareholders are happy because the business continues to operate just fine
in the background (meaning shareholders really are not missing out long term on their gains).


I wonder if NQ management had it to do over again if they would pull a FAB?

to recharacterize the kiosk business despite all other press releases to date. I'm a long holder that is stuck in this POS
but it annoys me that people like lucky and others commenting are in such denial about what is going on that they are
the ones that allow these companies to piss all over US law.

"•Presumably FAB will try to explain how its secret $16.3 million Chinese bond offering was not a sufficiently bad
corporate governance-lapse to merit a delisting."


No they won't. It makes for a good story, but the hearing has nothing to do with the bond. FAB had previously restated
Q2 and Q3 to account for the bond. That's old news. The hearing is about this:


"On April 3, 2014, FAB Universal Corp. (the "Company"), received a notice (the "Notice") from the NYSE MKT LLC
("NYSE MKT"), indicating that the Company is no longer in compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE
MKT's Company Guide due to the Company's inability to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2013 (the "Annual Report") with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (the "SEC")."


FAB, out of the blue and to the utter dismay of the shorts, recently filed their 10K. That's why this hit piece showed up.
FAB is going to stay listed and start trading again soon.


"•FAB will also have to explain how its decision to downgrade its auditor somehow made sense given its admitted lack
of internal control over its Chinese subsidiaries. "


No they won't. FAB's new auditor, KCCW, is a registered member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB), just like their old one and just like the NYSE requires.


The reason for the switch? Glad you asked. In April FAB was stuck in a corner. Their current auditor (Friedman) made
it clear they would not offer up an unqualified opinion letter or start work on the 10K prior to the completion of the
ongoing forensic audit FAB hired Loeb and Loeb to complete. Without that letter or a completed 10K FAB was going
to be kicked off the NYSE on July 16th....no if's and's or but's. Friedman stood firm as you posted above ("Friedman
was unwilling to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements PRIOR to the completion of the Internal
Investigation) leaving FAB with a choice. Either accept being kicked off the NYSE or hire a new auditor (there is no
rule, law or even consensus that stated the 10K could not be completed prior to the completion of the internal
investigation, it was simply Friedman's call). FAB choose to switch auditors and take a chance at staying listed. The
results of their switch paid off. While an "unqualified" opinion letter would have sufficed, instead FAB is going to their
hearing with a completed "unqualified" 10K (making NQ extremely jealous and the shorts very nervous...especially
after seeing the numbers in the 10K....5 dollars a share in cash, 1 dollar a share in earnings and a 50% revenue
growth rate).


As for this:


"Conclusion


FAB has been given a full 8 months to disclose the locations of the media kiosks. Instead, FAB tossed aside the facts
in its previous disclosures and overhauled its entire business description to focus on "FAB Brand licenses" that make
the existence of the actual kiosks completely unverifiable. "


Other then material SEC filings (like the delisting notice) FAB has been completely dark about everything (including
very positive business developments) while everyone awaited the completion of the internal investigation. Also,
clearly FAB's business model changed in 2012 but the filings did not completely detail that (leaving an opening for the
shorts). The new 10K clearly spells out just how FAB has operated since 2012. It was always disingenuous (and still
is) for the shorts to compare the 10K Kiosks that existed prior to 2012 and try to hold them to the same standard as
the 6K that were produced after.

Author’s reply »  Lucky, I don't buy any of these excuses. FAB's auditor downgrade was precisely the
opposite of what a real company would do. It was just a desperate attempt to keep the fraud alive a little
longer.

Al,


Apple asked politely some time ago. What would a "real company" do in this audit decision situation? The
answer to this question will help us understand what you mean by a glaring contradiction. So far the only
glaring contradiction I see is what you "report" and what is really true.

Author’s reply »  A real company with a wildly profitable kiosk business, free of pirated content, 1) would have
published the kiosk locations on its website, years ago, 2) would not suddenly stop selling wildly profitable
kiosks after a short seller challenged their existence, 3) would not secretly issue high interest bonds when the

Al,


You do not answer the question posed but choose to extend your accusations, albeit feebly. Only in your #5
do you even touch on the audit decision question posed, and only in vague generalities. Your #1 is your your
old vain wish argument that FAB should respond to you. It's FAB's business, not yours. Your #2 is a
misstatement. We have no indication that FAB (licenses for) kiosk sales have stopped, though it's possible,
and for any number of reasons separate from your accusations. Your #3 is pure speculation, what you
specialize in. Your #4 again is your wish, when the corporate standard is an internal investigation with

assume if you were FAB or another company you would have followed a similar course of action as FAB, not
the actions from the short seller deceitful wish playbook you cite. It must be nice to get a stock position like
FAB and then drive its price down with your ramblings, I mean, reports. How's that working for you in the SVM

Hi,


I closely follow Chinese media and Internet stocks. That is my specialty. I have followed FAB for some time and think
this stock is ready for a breakout upward. I own a few shares but plan to buy more when trading resumes, if the FAB
independent investigation and 2014 Q1 earnings report look good, and FAB stays on the NYSE, as I expect it will.


Having read recently the FAB 10-K and all previous FAB filings, I am of the opinion that Mr. Carnes has tried in this
“report” to support his large short position, while unfairly slamming FAB. This hit piece gets started with the title. There
are few if any contradictions in the FAB 2013 10-K, and certainly no glaring contradictions.


This Carnes hit piece revolves around the citing of critical contradictions to earlier FAB filings. But Carnes’ statements
are themselves suspect.


Carnes writes:


“This (emphasis on FAB brand licensing) seems to be a bold act of recanting the previously disclosed business model
… and recasting it in a new, albeit equally dubious direction.”


But how so? How is this really new? For instance, the FAB 2013 Q1 10-Q states this “new” direction, and many of the
2013 filings and related PRs, as well. 
Yet in this “report”, Carnes says the “first hint” of this change in business description appeared in FAB’s December
20th, 2013 announcement. No, this is definitely not true. What? Come again… See the FAB 2013 Q1 10-Q as one of
many prior filing and PR examples of this direction.


This is a key point in understanding why this “report” by Carnes is flawed and is characterized more by wish than fact.
In this “report”, Carnes goes on to say his research in Fall 2013 counters FAB’s assertion in the 2013 10-K that that
prior to 2010 FAB’s business model consisted of brand licensing under the FAB brand. Carnes proceeds to present
quotes from FAB that demonstrated that Carnes does not understand the full set of FAB filings and PRs. FAB has put
out PRs delineating the types of kiosks that FAB develops and licenses. Anyone who knows FAB knows that media
kiosks are only one type of kiosks that FAB develops and licenses. Carnes seems in his “report” to not to understand

well FAB. This is disappointing because it makes Carnes’ attacks look as if they are ill-informed and self-gain is the
end game, not truthful analysis.


In the end, Carnes’ “report” is flawed for several reasons. In addition to the reasons I have already cited, it is
fundamentally flawed for this “report” to assert that there is something wrong with FAB’s 2013 10-K just because it
does not include language used in a previous 10-K or because a new business model is presented or an old business
model is described in more detail. There are no glaring contradictions.


Last of all, Carnes is unfair and inappropriate to attack the auditor change by FAB only based on conjecture. FAB
changed auditors to improve its prospects. Is this unethical or reason for the vicious attacks Carnes makes against
FAB’s 10-K and new auditor.


Carnes should not be allowed to recklessly sling around adjectives and adverbs that are not based on facts. Traders
are cautioned to inform themselves before trading to ensure their actions are based on good information.

My Reply:


To address your point, I must first reiterate that your entire article is seriously flawed because you never
define and describe the "glaring contradictions." So it's unclear what you mean by "new". The truth is nothing
is significantly new in the FAB business model other than some of the language, certainly not the business
model itself.


At a key juncture in your "report", you start the sentence with "This seems..." and refer to a couple of FAB
quotes as your only means of definition and description. This is a major structural flaw in your "report." You
never elaborate on the contradictions you see, and I see none.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 14/29


To address your question to me that you don't see any indication in the 2013 Q1 10-Q that all FAB sells are
Brand licenses, let me say the following. FAB does not say anywhere, including in this 2013 Q1 10Q or the
2013 !0K filing, that all FAB sells are Brand licenses. It would be foolish to say this, even if it were true (which
it was not), as it would paint FAB into a box (why limit the scope of operations?). FAB has always developed
and provided a variety of kiosk types for licensing, other than media kiosks or 5C Entertainment kiosks, and
this is widely documented in FAB filings and PRs.


You also ask for documentation in the 2013 Q1 10Q that the majority of its kiosks are anything other than
media kiosks or that FAB is not engaged in the operation of the media kiosks. To my knowledge, FAB has
never provided a percent breakdown of what percent are media kiosks and what percent are not. This would
not make much sense either as the terms kiosk and media kiosk are subject to overlap. A better term for such
analysis would be 5C Entertainment Kiosk.


The bottom line is that you have wrongly sought to characterize FAB's recent 2013 10K as containing glaring
contradictions when the business model presented in the 10K is not "new" but "old", going back to the start of
2013, as I document, and probably considerably further back to 2010 as FAB maintains.


Note in your follow-up post's question to me that you use an end quote with "FAB Media". Of course, that's
not the same as FAB Universal, and is only one part of the FAB whole.


In support of my original point, here are a couple of quotes from the 2013 Q1 10Q:


"The Digital Media Services segment licenses its multi-year programs for our FAB brand and business
model."


"FAB has quickly grown its nationwide business network through its license and regional agent programs."

Alfred quoted from the 10-Q: 
"FAB kiosks, located in high-traffic areas of office buildings, shopping malls, retail stores and airports, are self-
service terminals that provide a range of entertainment and consumer applications."


That seems pretty specific to me. If there were different kinds of kiosks, then this sentence would've started
with: "some of" or "the majority of". But there has been no indication by the company that there are other
kinds of kiosks.


"FAB has always developed and provided a variety of kiosk types for licensing, other than media kiosks or 5C
Entertainment kiosks, and this is widely documented in FAB filings and PRs."


You provide no proof of this, Older, whereas Alfred has provided his proof.

The stock has been halted for how many months now? Why couldn't the company simply list the addresses of
all 3954 kiosks and end the debate right there?


14 Jul 2014, 12:30 AM


Olderbutwiser
Adam,


I'm not sure what you mean in your first paragraph. Per my proof and FAB's filings and PRs, there are many
different types of FAB kiosks. That's one of several reasons this "report" from Carnes is flawed.


In regard to your second paragraph, FAB is limited in the information that it can put out when the stock is
halted. Secondly, in my opinion, FAB has no reason to disclose kiosk locations in reaction to Carnes' pseudo-
investigations. Most likely the FAB-referred-to 3954 kiosks are not kiosks for which a public listing makes any
sense. I agree with FAB's actions. Why let an outsider short trader drive internal company policies? For me
there is no debate on these kiosks, just unreasonable, self-centered demands. When FAB publishes kiosk
locations is up to FAB.


14 Jul 2014, 03:58 AM


Adam Gefvert, CFA, Contributor
What I mean, is you said the quote only pertained to "entertainment" kiosks. I said that in addition to the word
"entertainment" the quote also mentions "consumer applications" which would probably include the other
types of kiosks that you mention in your reply.


The stock lost 70% of its value, and has been halted for many months. It isn't just Carnes that has a problem
with the company. FAB is past the point of being self righteous and "sticking to its guns". It has no power here
and should do everything it can to convince the public that it isn't a fraud. Explaining exactly where all the
kiosks are would be one of the easiest, most logical steps.

Adam,


I agree with your assertion that FAB...


"should do everything it can to convince the public that it isn't a fraud."


I think that is the whole purpose of the internal investigation by Loeb and Loeb. I expect that investigation to
put forward results soon and FAB to follow with its rationales and related information.


I will be surprised if an address of all kiosks is a part of this coming information burst because FAB will have
the internal report to back its legitimacy and will only publish addresses that make business sense, such as
the ones posted under http://www.fabgou.com for Beijing.


FAB is not a Redbox, far from it. We can assume FAB knows which kiosks it makes sense to get out to the
public.

Carnes your comments on changing auditors are complete b.s. Given that FAB's auditor would not issue an opinion
prior to the completion of the Loeb investigation, the Company's decision was actually quite bold and decisive. One of
the most positive developments to date in this sorry saga. Referring to your comment above what would a "real
company" have done in your opinion ?


13 Jul 2014, 06:17 PM


Olderbutwiser
Mr. Carnes,


In your "report", you wrote:


"FAB's purported 2010 change to its business model is contradicted by my research that found that as recently as late
2013, FAB's Beijing kiosk franchising sales office was still offering media kiosks to Chinese investors on a turnkey
basis - whereby FAB was responsible for placing and operating the kiosks and guaranteed franchisees a positive
return on their investments."


I fail to see how your main contention is true. The FAB business model that you say is contradicted is simply that FAB
licenses the majority of its entertainment kiosks. Let's skip over whether this began in 2010, as FAB says, or 2012 as
the 2012 Proxy documents or the start of 2013 as the 2013 Q1 10Q documents. I'm guessing FAB has the needed
documentation for 2010.


Whenever the date, it is clear from FAB filings and PRs that FAB's entertainment kiosk business used a licensing
business model in the timeframe of interest. You say in another place in the "report" FAB had "complete control" over
the kiosk implementation and operation but any reader knows complete control is an ideal and not a reality. I
challenge you to name me any thing in the world over which complete control can be exercised. A close reading of
FAB's filings shows and your 2013 Fall articles show that FAB was not directly involved in kiosk implementation and
operations, so you have misstated this information. It appears that your "report" is a rhetorical tactic to pin the blame
on FAB, and this is deceitful.


If in fact your "investigators" were offered turnkey kiosks, this in no way indicates that FAB's business model was not
built on a licencing model. Quite the contrary, a reading of all your Fall 2013 reports only affirms this.


Therefore it is unclear to me what you are trying to accomplish in this new "report, other than to save your own neck.
Anyone who read your previous reports and has any critical thinking capability, I assume, would say the same thing. If

These comments are hilarious. To see who you are dealing with... "Lucky?" is "joebigbuck" on the Yahoo Message
Board and olderbutwiser is "truthwantsout" plus many more aliases there.


They have been delusional and in denial since day 1. Lucky? (joebigbuck) calls the whole situation "The Carnes
Scam" hundreds of times on Yahoo when the truth is that the day before the first A*L report it traded for $5.46 and
dropped to $5.25 after the report was released. It actually rose back to $5.29 in the 4 days before the Geoinvesting
report outlining the bond issuance. Carnes was responsible for less than 4% of the drop, but since he has his own
allegations there is a role reversal by the delusional and the manipulators to associate the FU transgressions with
Carnes.


You can attempt to shoot the messenger all you want, but motives do not change facts. The astute investor will verify
what they can regardless of who presents the information and regardless of what their motives or agenda are. What it
all boils down to is FAB Universal has PROVEN transgressions while successfully defending against ZERO
allegations.


A watered-down 10-K where they walked-back past disclosures does not eliminate the previous violations... it merely
reinforces them. If they could refute the allegations, they would have been eager to do so and reaffirm past guidance.


A T1 halt lasting for 8 months is an abuse of its intended purpose for the dissemination of news. The fact they can't
provide requested information in 8 months is a per se confirmation they do not have what it takes to be listed on a
regulated exchange. To take investor's money hostage so management can limit their exposure to lawsuits is, in my
opinion, yet another actionable offense and a clear violation of their fiduciary duty to SHAREHOLDERS. The NYSE is
complicit in this farce. Resume trading or delist them.

I'm curious why FAB requires "Short Term Bank Loans" given their huge stash of cash. Between Q3-2013 and Q4-
2014, these short term bank loans increased from ~$1.8 million (restated) to ~$6.3 million.


The 10-K says that, "Short-term bank loans are primarily used for working capital needs." However, given that
company has so much cash, it would seem to be folly to borrow money without putting it work. (Just like the $16
million of long-term debt, money that was borrowed and not yet put to work). It seems folly to borrow money at 7.8%
(which is the rate on the bulk of the short-term borrowings) or 11% (Long Term bond payable) only to leave that cash
sitting in a savings account. If FAB were really shareholder friendly, they'd be using their cash (~$60 million as of Q3-
2013 & ~$100 million at Q4-2013) to fund working capital needs rather than borrowing at 7.8% - 11%.


What I find interesting with the bulk of the short term debt issued in Q4, is that the Chinese banks that issued the
loans, required a guarantee not from the company, but from FAB's major shareholder (See 10-K Quote below).

It also appears that FAB has problems paying back its debts on time. From the most recent 10-K:


1) FAB Digital Short Term bank loan for $1.5 million from China Merchants Bank: Issued 4/25/2012 due 4/25/2013.
"Fully repaid on May 31, 2013". (Over a month late)


2) Fab Digital One year term loan from Bank of Communications (NYSEARCA:BCM) for $8,000 (eight thousand):
issued 9/23/2012, due October 10, 2013. "The loan was fully repaid on October 31, 2013". (3 weeks late)


3) FAB Digital One year term loan with BCM for $1.6 million: issued March 25, 2013 due March 28, 2014. "Fully
repaid on April 2, 2014". (a few days late)


4) They did pay one debt on time. FAB Universal $573,750 borrowed from Primate Rate Finance On October 1, 2012,
for an 18 month loan due January 1, 2014. Final payment was made prior to 1/1/2014.


------------------- 
I find it strange that all 3 of the paid off short term notes for FAB Media, were paid slightly late. And I find it comical
that they needed to borrow RMB 50,000 ($8,000) on September 23, 2012.

All of these loans when they supposedly have cash are troubling enough, but my question is why the money
for the building prepayment was never returned yet. We knew in December of 2013 that they had decided
against it and had requested the deposit be returned. Who pays millions of dollars because you are
considering a purchase? Why wasn't this money placed in escrow where they had assurances it would be
returned if they decided not to follow through on the purchase? Yet another instance of management clearly
not acting in an appropriate fiduciary manner to the shareholders.


What I think needs to be addressed is who actually received this down payment and was it a related party
(individual or business) to Zhang. It certainly wasn't returned prior to the 10-K release or would have been
declared as a subsequent event for such a large amount of money. Over half a year since the request and it
hasn't been returned? That is beyond troubling.

Wolfriver,


Thanks for confirming that FAB is maintaining adequate liquidity during these tough credit days in China and
confirming FAB is on top of its lines of credit and loan closeouts. In China there was a great escalation in loan
late payments in 2013. It's a known phenomenon. In China a loan is not termed substandard until late at least
91 days, and no FAB loan payment was that late. Less than 91 days late and the bank has considerable
flexibility to treat the loan as normal or special mention. Your suggestion of efficient capital use without loans
is admirable for the U.S., but probably would cause your growing organization liquidity problems in China and
get you fired. So my recommendation is to read up more on credit practices in China before you try to slam
FAB's loan payment performance down... because you may just be pumping the stock without trying. That
said, impressive arithmetic analysis.

Olderbutwiser,


you bring up a valid point. Almost 40% of loans in China are paid 1 day - 90 days after the "due date".


But one interesting comment that was just shared by FAB in its Q1-2014 10-Q filing was:


"Operations are funded through the leverage of financial institutions with short-term bank loans."


I believe this is the first time the company, that purportedly generates copious amounts of cash, has admitted
to funding operations with short term bank loans. In the past, the company said short term borrowings were "
primarily used for working capital needs" (2013 10-K).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 22/29


I hear you're the guy over on the Yahoo message board that everyone badmouths for language abuse and for hording
water, rations, and silver. So I gather you like to look for red flags (and nuclear blasts on the horizon). Well, I think we
can agree on one thing. Though you may want to keep an eye on when FAB gets that building prepayment back, the
prepayment situation is in fine shape per accounting and auditing principles at present. So please keep an eye on this
situation and alert us in 6 months or so if this prepayment is not received by FAB. I did not read so closely the 10-K to
see if that large building prepayment will be added to the approximate audited $100M in cash on-hand, or if that
prepayment amount is already included. In either case, the more you talk about money, the better FAB looks...


14 Jul 2014, 07:22 PM


Lucky?
"All of these loans when they supposedly have cash are troubling enough, but my question is why the money for the
building prepayment was never returned yet. We knew in December of 2013 that they had decided against it and had
requested the deposit be returned."


Isn't it enough that you lie in nearly every post over on Yahoo, do you really need to continue that practice over here?


FAB stated in the last PR dated Dec. 10th, 2013 that they had decided this:


"As part of its review, the Board of Directors has asked that $17.8 million in prepayments for the setup of additional
FAB flagship stores be returned to the Company in light of its decision to accelerate the transition to digital distribution
channels. These are cash payments that FAB has made to third parties to assist the Company in opening multiple
retail flagship stores throughout China."


Then last week the 2013 10K comes out and we found out FAB told exactly the truth....as all 17.8M was returned.


From FAB's 2013 10K:


"The prepaid payments are used for new FAB flagship stores opening in other locations and real estate purchasing.
The decrease in prepayments for setting up flagship stores is due to the REFUND from eleven third-parties in the
amount of RMB 110 million (approximately $17.8 million) in 2013. "


Many speculated that money never existed, or would never be returned. Turned out it did exist and was returned.


If you were referring to the Longyuan building, it was never even announced until last week in the 10K that they had
decided not to go ahead with the purchase.


"On January 7, 2014, the Board of Directors decided not to purchase the Longyuan building, and the Company
started the process for the return of the deposit. The deposit has not been returned and we are currently in
negotiations with the owner of the building as to the amount of the compensation to be paid per the terms of the
agreement of Intent for Property Transfer."


But why anyone would question the return of the Longyuan deposit after they just received 17M in deposits from their
flagship stores is beyond me.


But here is the big mystery. Why has FAB decided to lease such a large office space in Hollywood?


"On January 23, 2014, FAB Entertainment Corporation, a subsidiary of DGC, entered into a 63 month agreement to
lease office space located at 10100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. The company paid a security

deposit of $309,312, and the monthly rent will be $25,776. The lease is guaranteed by FAB Universal Corp."


Since FAB has still not started releasing business PR's it's a mystery what their plans are. But one thing is clear.....in
the 8 months FAB has been halted they've been very busy behind the scenes.

"If you were referring to the Longyuan building, it was never even announced until last week in the 10K that
they had decided not to go ahead with the purchase."


Wrong again, Joe. We knew at least as early as January 21, 2014 with the amended 10-Qs for Q2 and Q3:


Note 17 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
On January 7, 2014, the Board of Directors decided not to purchase the Longyuan building, and the Company
has started the process for the return of the deposit.


I thought we knew in December, but I don't see that reference offhand. It was discussed many times on
Yahoo. How can you say it was just announced last week?


What about that building deposit? Page 12 of latest 10-Q:


"We are currently in negotiations with the owner of the building as to the amount of the compensation to be
paid per the terms of the agreement of Intent for Property Transfer."


Over half a year after requesting the return of the deposit, they still have to "negotiate" for it? Why wasn't this
money placed in escrow? We need to know who has this money and what the relation is to Zhang.


ZERO new kiosk licenses for the first quarter. 
Revenue dropped from $22M to $14M year over year. 
Comprehensive LOSS for the quarter.


I'm satisfied they are current. Let the trading begin! You keep forgetting the confirmation of the bond offering
isn't even priced in yet as they were still "VEHEMENTLY DENYING" its existence when they were halted.


15 Jul 2014, 07:44 PM


Lucky?
"I thought we knew in December, but I don't see that reference offhand."


Before you stated it was OK to lie as long as somewhere in the past you were truthful about the matter.


Now it's OK to lie as long as it's inadvertent?


You got lots of rules about lying.


Which one does this fit under?


"Comprehensive LOSS for the quarter"


"Net income available to common stockholders decreased to $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, as
compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2013."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2311375-fab-universal-glaring-contradictions-in-its-2013-10-k 24/29


With today's filing FAB is now completely current with the SEC filings.


It's also clear FAB intentionally is moving away from their low margin business (retail, wholesale) and moving into
their high margin one (digital). It was the only way profits could be so similar even with a 50% drop in revenue (all in
retail and wholesale). It's also clear FAB is making this transition very rapidly, which their large stockpile of cash (over
100M) is giving them flexibility to do.


I expect this rapid transition to continue into Q2. What I don't know is why the heck they are making such a large
investment in Hollywood and why shut down the license business for one quarter (or beginning of a trend)? Do they
want that money all to themselves and to cut out the franchises? FAB's working capital is up about 500% in the last 9
months, I guess they have the cash to go that way now if they so feel the need.

FAB has been close to a fraud since the days of WZE. Look at this history of this company, it speaks volumes about
the managers....


The china connection was a way for the inept managers to leverage the business. They could barely control their own
little backyard business prior to the "merger" and now are dealing with a very shrewd Chinese partner which they
cannot control.


This is a clear case of the dumb kid in school getting the keys to car and taking it on a joy ride....


Investors are in the back seat getting fisted....

Since somebody other than the board of directors and the audit committee approved the change of FAB's auditors to
KCCW, I decided to check out KCCW's website. I find it interesting that KCCW's "management profile" page states
that Edward Wu, Thomas Chang, Michael Lin, and Calvin Kwan are all members of California Society of CPAs.
However, according to the calcpa.org website which lets you search for their members by accounting firm, only
Chingtang Chang, CPA is both a member of the California Society of CPAs and KCCW.Another website
(CPAverify.org) shows that (1) Edward Wu is not listed in the database. (2) Thomas Chang's CPA certification is
cancelled. (3) Michael Lin (three Michael Lin's are "Active/Clear", and two are inactive. And Michael Lin's linkedin

Wolfriver,


Such database searches are often inaccurate for any number of reasons. Bottom line these databases are
not considered a reliable search method. I'm not sure what you're trying to insinuate. But I'm getting tired of
reading posts like yours based on 15 minutes of web searching and the statement of insinuations as if you
have discovered something significant. I don't think for a moment that KCCW would misstate the credentials
of its staff. You are barking up the wrong trees but too lazy to climb the trees and do some robust searching.


20 Jul 2014, 09:47 PM


wolfriver
Thanks for your comment Olderbutwiser. I did include some weaknesses (i.e. databases could be lacking) in
my comment that was based on my "15 minute web search". I'm also still waiting to see if you were able to
find out from a "15 minute web search" of your own what FAB my have meant in their most recent 10-Q when
they said:</p> 
"Operations are funded through the leverage of financial institutions with short-term bank loans."</p>


I believe that means that operations (i.e. operating expenses) are SG&A and do not include COGS. However
elsewhere in FAB's 10-Qs and 10-k it says short term borrowings are used for working capital (which is likely
inventory which should be COGS.). I realize that all money is fungible, and at best the phrase "Operations are
funded through leverage" could mean nothing. But at worst, it could mean that for some mysterious reason
this company that is flush with cash needs to short-term loans (which are guaranteed by somebody other than
the company) to pay for SG&A.


 
One final thing about FAB's engagement of KCCW.


It may be a good thing Fab Universal selected KCCW as their accountants. Because given FAB's 10-K risk
factor that their stock may be a "Penny Stock" under SEC regulations (which means trading less than
$5/share), and the fact that KCCW's other clients mostly appear to be penny stocks it could be a good fit.

Wolfriver,


I'm not sure exactly what that sentence means from the FAB 10Q about operations leveraging financial
institutions with short-term bank loans. My interpretation is that the strategic partnerships with various banks
are being used to FAB's advantage. As far as the KCCW list of clients you listed, thanks for showing how
KCCW has considerable related good recent public company experience. I don't expect FAB to get delisted
from the NYSE, but you never know. Myself, I tend to think that KCCW is a good and reputable company.

Hmmmmmm
It seems that the company had all of the features present in the typical pyramid scheme. 
see Mr. Ackman's presentation on HLF. (the rise was due to a short squeeze)


The give away is that the more obscure the structure etc. etc. , the more irregular the accounting practices ....the
more you know you must be seeing a complete fraud.


23 Jul 2014, 04:52 AM


Olderbutwiser
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...


Interesting point you make. But I am surprised you would cite Mr. Ackman's "short trade" pyramid presentation
yesterday against Herbalife as an example against FAB. The stock price of Herbalife went UP (not a short trader goal)
yesterday over 25% AFTER this presentation, so the market clearly thought Mr. Ackman's pyramid accusations were
contrived and faulty. Plus FAB's 2013 finances have been audited in its 2013 10-K. Remember, business itself is built
on a pyramid concept. Only various "pyramid" aspects are improper or illegal, not all of them. FAB is not a fraud at all,
and this is largely proven with the 10-K, and, I am assuming, documented in the coming internal investigation report.


23 Jul 2014, 08:06 AM


Hmmmmmm
Of course HLF went up; Ackman expected it would. The company is trying to prop up the stock. Ackman will show
evidence for this as well. 
You must know the dynamics of a "short squeeze".


The point is clear as day. Jim Chanos cites the fact that accounting irregularities are rampant in most Chinese
companies. Where ever you see obscurant accounting and other "irregularities" then you must suspect that you are
dealing with fraud.


Alfred should be commended for his work uncovering this glaring example of fraud.

With all due respect, you are talking nonsense. You wrote:


"Of course HLF went up; Ackman expected it would. The company is trying to prop up the stock."


This is absolutely not true at all. Ackman is trying to make the stock price go down. He has $1B invested in a short
trade position on HLF. When HLF goes up, he loses more money.


And you say the following in your post:


"Alfred should be commended for his work uncovering this glaring example of fraud."


Wrong again... Alfred is a second-rate short trader on FAB and this last article is ill-conceived and presented.
Somehow I am not surprised that you did not notice... :)


FAB is not a fraud. If you want to see a glaring example of fraud, search on the web the British Columbia Securities
Commission (BCSC) SVM fraud charges against Jon Richard Carnes (aka Alfred Little) in the Vancouver hearing
coming up in August and November/December 2014. The SEC was involved in the evidence gathering, along with the
BCSC.


24 Jul 2014, 08:07 AM


Hmmmmmm
see: Ackman on Herbalife’s Rally: ‘You Can Only Prop Up a Stock For So Long’,


http://on.mktw.net/1z7...


The company is buying back its stock as a defense; the SEC will also examine the timing of the buy backs.


Speaking of timing: FAB has had plenty of time to present its case and prove that there was no misunderstandings
about the existence of the Kiosks, and the bond offering. What exactly is the big hold-up?


So what is the explanation for these glaring "irregularities".


Three cheers for Alfred.


Jim Chanos would not have any of this, nor would Ackman

Alfred, what's your opinion on Fab's Chinese website (fab.com.cn)?


Now it looks like it is under construction. But according to the way back machine prior to the stock being halted it

There is a simple answer. i also read Chinese but that does not really help with your question. What was
previously on http://www.fab.com.cn is on "Share", or the http://www.fabgou.com website, FAB's e-commerce
portal. The fab.com.cn website and even the corporate blogs were mothballed a month ago or so, I am
assuming per internal consultant recommendations and preparation for the NYSE hearing, etc. Maybe Alfred
has other opinions...

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Older is right about the website. But Fabgou.com looks like another fraud. Scroll to the very
bottom and try to click the 4 buttons, which supposedly should link to FAB's various ecommerce business
license/registrations. The buttons don't work. Compare the function of the same buttons on the JD.com

I see what you mean about the 4 buttons on the FAB site. 3 of the buttons (all but far left one) work on the jd.com site
and none of the 4 work on the FAB site. However, I don't see this is evidence of fraud. I don't think for a moment that
FAB's site is a clone of JD's site. But even if it were, that would be commonplace enough. If you read FAB filings, they
have the needed licenses/registrations. JD is a partner. I don't know all the details, but you are slinging the phrase
"looks like another fraud" much too freely for some one who really has no idea. I don't think http://www.fabgou.com
(Share) is a fraud. I've watched it develop over a year, and what exactly is a fraud website anyway and what fraud is
FAB making?
