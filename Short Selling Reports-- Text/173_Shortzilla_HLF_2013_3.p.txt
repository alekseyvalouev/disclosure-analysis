Herbalife's Lieberman Report: Smoke And Mirrors
Jan. 7, 2013 12:35 PM ET44 comments
by: NA Account


Herbalife CEO Michael Johnson made a guest appearance on CNBC following the news
that Bill Ackman had accused Herbalife of running a pyramid scheme. I'm sure that
Johnson and his lawyers wish they could erase the interview from the internet archives.
Johnson, like he has numerous times in the past, made several serious misstatements
about Herbalife's business. The most important revolves around Lieberman Research
Worldwide, a market research firm, which was only hired by Herbalife early in 2012.


By this point we know that Herbalife has no system to track retail sales, nor do they have
any idea what amount of retail sales actually exist. So, in an effort to help silence the
critics, Herbalife hired Lieberman to help figure out who exactly is buying the product.
Note that Herbalife has been in business for 30+ years. As we noted in our first report, as
a mandate to a court order in 1986 in California, they are required to have a system which
accurately records retail sales. They don't. So, instead of putting some sort of
documentation system in place, they figured that hiring a market research consultant
would be the best alternative.


First let's get back to that CNBC interview for a moment. This exchange between Johnson
and CNBC anchor Kate Kelly will give us a backdrop:


JOHNSON: We have millions of customers. Millions upon millions of customers.
Lieberman research was hired by us to go out and verify and validate that. We've
been validating that for the past two quarters. We will continue to do that. That's
never been a problem. None with FTC none with anyone. Our customers are
sometimes called a distributor that's the only confusion that we have. And they are
distributors because they get a discount on our products.


KELLY: Can you give us a percentage figure though Mr. Johnson as to what
percentage of your sales are outside that distribution network?


JOHNSON: 90%


KELLY: So the vast majority?


JOHNSON: Absolutely

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1098271-herbalifes-lieberman-report-smoke-and-mirrors 2/16


Johnson or anyone at Herbalife for that matter have never been able to answer that
previous question with any sort of precision but Johnson somehow, someway finally had
the answer. 90%. And he said it with such authority. "Absolutely."


We wondered where this magical 90% number came from. Did he make it up? Was
Herbalife somehow now recording the actual end purchasers of product?


But we then remembered the Q3 quarterly conference call in which Johnson discussed
Lieberman research and some of their work:


JOHNSON: As we discussed last quarter, we've engaged Lieberman Research to
conduct consumer research over the next 3 years. This quarter's results were very
similar to those of the second quarter. Approximately 5% of U.S. households
reported having purchased Herbalife product in the past 3 months, which translates
into more than 5.5 million households. Those consumers who purchased Herbalife
product, more than 90% were outside our distribution network. According to
Lieberman Research, the consumers' intent to repurchase was very strong, with 2/3
of those having purchased Herbalife product in the past 3 months, indicating that
they would definitely repurchase Herbalife products.


We should note that the total US population is roughly 314 million with roughly 115 million
households. On average there are about 3 individuals per household. We wondered why
Herbalife used the term "households"; instead of individuals. The answer was clear. If
Herbalife had properly identified those who purchased a single product during the 3
months preceding the survey as individuals, it would expose the fact that 98.2% of the
total population of the US did not even purchase a single product from Herbalife in the 3
months preceding the survey.


Note that Herbalife states that '5% of US Households reported having purchased Herbalife
Product…' which we should point out is singular 'product' and not 'products'. This equates
to 5.5 million households according to Herbalife. And the singular 'product' usage is
important, because no information is given to us about the remaining 10% purchases of
distributors. The distributor purchases are obviously much larger in nature, and therefore
their volume likely dwarfs the 90% non-distributor purchases.


Herbalife has admitted that it supplied the questions to Lieberman, (which is a standard
practice) to use in connection with the "households" that "purchased product" (singular not
plural) in the preceding three months.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1098271-herbalifes-lieberman-report-smoke-and-mirrors 3/16


How did Lieberman find the individuals (or households) that purchased a product from
Herbalife in the 3 months preceding the survey?


Some of Lieberman's options:


1. Calling the entire population of the US, which is 314 million, (at least those with listed
phone numbers)?


2. Using telephone directories that list a phone number for each US address (household);
then, call each of the 115 million phone numbers.


3. Send a survey, via US mail or likely email to the 314 million people that comprise the
US population; or to each of the 115 million households.


We did a search for some of Lieberman's past work to get an idea of how their sampling
works.


In a 2009 survey completed for Charles Schwab entitled 'Young Adults & Money Survey',
Lieberman concluded that 52% of young adults between the ages of 23 and 28 consider
"making better choices about managing money" the single most important issue for
individual Americans to act on today.


In the footnotes of the article Lieberman notes that they polled 1,252 young adults
between the ages of 23 and 28 'using Real-Time Sampling (RTS), a marketing research
technique in which respondents were recruited in real-time from a network of hundreds of
prescreened websites.'


While we couldn't find an exact total for the number of people age 23-28 in the US, our
estimate is at roughly 30 million (give or take a few million). Regardless of the exact
number, Lieberman concluded- based on a sampling of .004% of this segment that the
majority of these young adults believed they should be making better choices about
managing money.


We don't have the exact number of people surveyed in the Herbalife/Lieberman report
(since it was never revealed to the public), yet we can make an educated guess that the
methods used in the two surveys are the same.


Except for one major difference; In the case of Herbalife, they are attempting to specify
with conviction a precise percentage of product sold to an end consumer, as opposed to
the Schwab survey, which is only attempting to get a group's pulse on a financial topic.
While there might be some evidence that sampling a tiny fraction of a subset of the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1098271-herbalifes-lieberman-report-smoke-and-mirrors 4/16


population and extrapolating that number can produce decisive results for a very
subjective question, I find it hard to believe that utilizing the same process can produce
valuable results for a company trying to determine how much product it sells to retail
customers.


We don't know for certain (since it was never revealed to the public) but Herbalife may
have provided Lieberman with the name and contact information of the individuals
Herbalife wanted included in the survey.


Is it possible that Herbalife sent Lieberman the contact information of individuals who are
not also distributors?


Here's our tongue in cheek version of how it might have gone down:


Johnson: "Hey investors and regulators are really breathing down our necks about
this whole retail sales thing. Can you send out some surveys and figure out who our
customers are?"


Lieberman Worldwide: "Sure! What sort of questions do you want to ask?"


Johnson: "Well seems the only thing that people care about are sales outside of our
distribution network. So let's ask people if they have ever purchased a product and if
they are a distributor. I'd like to figure out the percentage of non-distributors that
have purchased product from us."


Lieberman Worldwide: "Ok, well we could email some folks, but that might take a
while."


Johnson: "Yeah well I need results immediately. If not they might shut this whole
thing down. How about I send you the emails from our database and you can just
send them the survey?"


Lieberman Worldwide: "Sounds great!"


We expect that the Herbalife Presentation on January 10th will rely heavily on the
Lieberman report, especially since Michael Johnson is now using the '90%' number as the
Holy Grail.


What we also know is that Herbalife will never reveal the exact methods or the number of
people surveyed by Lieberman.

Smoke and Mirrors. Conceal and Conquer. Herbalife's game plan for the past 30 years.
Don't be fooled on January 10th. Take the Lieberman report for what it is worth; a survey.
It might be reliable to find out if distributors like the new 'dulche de leche' shake but it is
not something that should be relied upon to prove that Herbalife is actually selling
products to end consumers.


Disclosure: I am short HLF. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

"What we also know is that Herbalife will never reveal the exact methods or the number of people surveyed by
Lieberman."


This might come out sooner or later in response to any FTC or SEC proceedings. And if it is less than robust, that
"90%" crack might exactly be the statement that sends Johnson into the clink.

Really??? The "short" creatures are crawling out of the swamps and sewers -- just the same ole b/s being re-hashed
over and over again about MLM sales models -- what do you say about HLF's outstanding record on Free Cash
Flow??


A measure of financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow
(FCF) represents the cash that a company is able to generate after laying out the money required to maintain or
expand its asset base. Free cash flow is important because it allows a company to pursue opportunities that enhance
shareholder value. Without cash, it's tough to develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce
debt.

Is the Company actively participating in retail sales outside the network? If so, they directly undermine the foundation
of their business. At a distributor level you earn a 25% markup up on all retail sales and the supervisory level a 50%
markup. Individual distributors are not required to maintain any records of their own sales, and have little
accountability to corporate after their wholesale purchases.


07 Jan 2013, 01:17 PM


fahaln
This is actually not a fact. Being a distributor, I am required to keep accurate records of all sales. This is
required by Herbalife, and they can ask for me to verify my sales at any time.

I agree that HLF business model is controversial.


How ever I think there's a great opportunity for short term profits on the long side with the stock at this price level.
Unless Johnson totally screws up the investor day parade, i see this stock slowly creeping up to at least a 45 dollar
level if not their previous 50+ . Pretty risky but still looks like less risk then the short side.

Certainly the issue that you highlight will be front & center on 01/10 and I agree that HLF cannot "have it both ways"
with Johnson claiming in one venue that he has no idea about the level of retail sales and in another interview that
retail sales are "absolutely" 90%. The very idea that a 'consumer products company' cannot instantly provide these
numbers is somewhat laughable.


Johnson will need something more than the Lieberman survey if he hopes to buttress market confidence in HLF
equity on Thursday. But --looking at his "facts" presentation-- I don't think Ackman is overly concerned with  the  the
regulatory & legal debate over the level of HLF retail sales; what Ackman seems to have discovered are the metrics
that indicate that the HLF MLM scheme is moving toward an endpoint at which it will fail of its own weight (see his
charts showing the country by country drop off in sales). Ackman seems to believe that even in the base world of
MLM, HLF does not return enough to 99% of participants to allow its scheme to continue much longer.


Will HLF fall off a cliff next week or next month? Who knows ... but Ackman has raised some good questions about
the HLF marketing scheme that will be difficult to rebutt; moreover,  Ackman has plenty of firepower for the support of
his short position and he is --by reputation--  a very patient man....

HLF is no more a pyramid scheme than Amway, Visalus, or any other MLM.


HLF may consider sales to their distributors as ‘retail’?


The MLM marketing strategy in the weightloss sector has been successful in gaining market share. Former industry
leaders such as Nutrisystems have really felt the pain over the last several years. NTRI has continuously reduced
margins just to stay competitive.


Although HLF has one of the most effective products lines in the industry and one of the highest payouts for
distributors, their domestic business has continued to slide as consumers often jump to the newest offer. This
manufactured hype surrounding HLF is only temporary.

It's a valid point BrentRShelton. I think Herbalife is a pyramid scheme. But one of the major reasons why I
think Ackman may fall on his face with this position is MLM companies have been using this model for
decades and to attack Herbalife's business model comes close to attacking the entire MLM industry. That's a
lot of money, a lot of jobs, and a lot of attorneys to be going to war with.

Why does anybody care WHO is buying the product as long as it is sold and paid for? If I like their products (and I
have no experience with them by the way) should the company not offer me the 25% discount I can get by setting me
up as a distributor? The product is still sold and the cash is still recorded and the profit is still booked, regardless of
whether or not I have any ambition to become a "super duper 12 star general regional institutionalized distributor".
Publicly traded companies are valued based on the bottom line and quarterly performance regardless of the public's
opinion of the ethics (or not) of their business model.


Multilevel marketing has been proven to benefit anyone who DECIDES it benefits them and has been upheld as an
allowable business model (see Amway and Herbalife) for many years regardless of the opinion(s) of the naysayers.


And speaking of the naysayers, how ethical is it for someone who has developed a reputation for correctly calling out
irregularities in the public markets to utilize his/her "reputation" to short a stock then ruin it for profit, especially when
the "facts" presented may or may not have any bearing on the profitability of the business model, which, after all, is
the deciding factor in the stock's value?

In answer to your question: If the sales are not to retail end users, it means that all or substantially all of HLF
'revenue' is based not on demand for their products but on the marketing scheme of recruiting ever more
'distributors'. At some point you run out people who can be gulled into spending $3 or $4 thousand dollars for
a zero (or near zero) return and HLF revenue dries up. Simple concept but if you want more detail see
Ackman's report.


The stock valuation metrics for HLF are under question because of the dubious HLF marketing scheme used
to generate those metrics, not some dark conspiracy of short sellers to "ruin" a "good "company. The market
decides all bets --long or short-- so it seems laughably  naive to question the "ethics" of the process. Your
opinion that the veracity & ethics of a business model --to say nothing of the truthfulness of financial &
regulatory representations-- should not control the value of an equity also seems foolish and misguided.
"Public opinion" counts too ... especially when, like HLF, your business model depends on a ready supply of
suckers ... LOL.

I wonder why Coke hasn't run out of customers for their products in over 120years? You would have thought
they would be saturated by now with the huge subliminal customer recruiting campaign they have run called
advertising. Guess not...


Wonder how many Apple customers will continue to be "gulled" into overpaying for their products.


It costs $75.00 to become a distributor (or discount customer take your pick) not $3-4,000.00. About 1/2 of
one month of cable/internet access.


Your last line was really the only piece of evidence that was needed to refute your argument. If you truly
believe Ackman's data that HLF is targeting only the financially challenged in our society, then believing they
are all "suckers" tells me all I need to know about you.

Coke? Coke is your analogy for HLF's business model? Coke --a company that can account for every lieter,
ounce & dollar of its retail sales & any other metric you can mention-- is analogous to Herbalife?? I've seen
some fanciful defenses 'by comparison' of HLF's business model (COSTCO seems to be an idiotic favorite)
but "Coke" is such a far fetched screwball analogy that I'm prompted to urge you to exercise caution in your
financial affairs: You too may be at risk for the Herbalife scheme! LOL. Or Apple? AAPL??? OMG ... LMAO....
Perhaps you ALREADY ARE an HLF 'distributor'!


And don't repeat that nonsense about the $75 cost of a distributorship ... check your facts, the actual loss
suffered by about 95% of HLF's so-called 'distributors' (before they drop out) is $3 - $4 thousand.

I am not an HLF distributor nor have I ever been...However, the fact that you hold them is such low regard
speaks loudly as to your opinion about your fellow humans and thus gives context to your arguments.


Perhaps the low income folks should buy a McDonald's franchise..or perhaps put their money in a hedgefund!
Maybe then they will measure up to your standards!


And yes Coke is a consumer products company..and the point had to do with saturation not tracking of
sales....Maybe I stated the fact at too low of an educational level for you to pick up my meaning?


And Apple is a consumer products company and sells high price goods...(To Poor people too! OMG!). This
point had to do with premium pricing..which again I apparently did not make clear.


And lastly...I stated that it was $75.00 to become a distributor or discount customer which is indeed a fact.
The actual 95% fact you are talking about is distributors that "make less than zero" which of course counts the
product they self-consume which is not really a cost now...is it.. LOL OMG LMAO. Go back to Haaaavaaad

@ Highwater - You are obnoxious, wrong and I think you are a short seller or work for them.


I pay Costco and Sams Club annual membership fees so I can get a discount. I am a "Business" member of
both (like a Distributor) but like 90% of their customers I buy for my personal use, not to re-sell. No one calls
them pyramids or scams. Do they track whether I consume or sell what I buy? Of course not. You short
sellers will say anything to try to scare people. You have NO credibility.


Are you saying that "poor people" are losing $3,000 to $4,000? That is a LIE and defies common sense - if
they had $3,000 to lose they wouldn't be poor and poor people can't borrow $3,000. IF that were true, I
guarantee there would have been more than 40 complaints with the FTC last year about HLF. Also, they have
a 12 month buy back guarantee.


Ackman claimed that 95% of HLF's revenue is from fees paid by distributors. 95% of $3.9 Billion is $3.7 B.
Assume that distributors paid $100 each in fees to HLF ($100 is a lot of money in many countries). That
would mean 37 million people paid $100 during a 12 month period. That = 12% of the US population and is
more people than are in the 25 largest US cities. How likely is that?


Pyramid Schemes don't have $3.9 Billion of TTM revenues, offer a one year buyback , stay in business for 30
years, and buy their own stock at market prices.


I am long HLF and think it will be $45 by Jan. 12.

There seems to be a good deal of attention paid to the question of retail sales. One of the problems with this
approach, which I try to deal with in the attached article, is whether 'retail sales' are even a legal element of a pyramid
scheme. They aren't an element of many state laws and earlier FTC cases limited a 'retail sales' exemption only to
'consummated' sales, i.e. override type commissions on existing orders to persons managing a sales staff.


The other main problem with the retail sales defense is just how does a company document retail sales when all it has
are records of wholesale transactions. Aside from problems with studies such as the one discussed here, what
standards does an enforcement agency such as the FTC apply if it is considering whether a company is a pyramid or
not. Does it accept the study? Is it legally obliged to prove an absence of retail sales - where could it get this
information? Exactly what percentage of retail sales, assuming one could get accurate information, makes a company
otherwise using illegal pyramid sales procedures all of a sudden legal? Would 70% be legal and 69% illegal? Do retail
sales include sales to distributors for their own use and how is this proven?


My point is that retail sales shouldn't even be a legal element when considering a pyramid scheme. The FTC has not
done its job in clarifying this matter and a lot of companies are doing quite well in the fog, which has existed ever
since the FTC's Amway decision over 30 years ago.

How many distributors did Ackman "survey" to come up with his information? You point to Lieberman and I bet they
did a much more thorough analysis than Ackman. He says they spent a full year analyzing this thing. So where in his
presentation does he say, "We called 1000 distributors and we found that ..." That isn't in the presentation because
they either didn't do that work or they did and the results didn't help their case. 
He further points to sales online of product to demonstrate a "true" price which is lower than the 25% discounted price
when the amount of sales online is extremely small and thus not at all representative. 
HLF is shady but it sure seems that Ackman's presentation has its own issues. He is no knight in shining armor. 
It will be a very interesting battle to watch but Ackman has the weaker hand here given the cost of his borrow and the
number of different ways that the company and longs can try to squeeze him.

The ignorance with which all these "experts" report is staggering. There are actually Experts in the Direct Sales MLM
model that the media could access. 
An example of ignorance. HFL sells direct to its distributors. They in turn sell to their customers..Maybe they have
none, maybe one...some I personally know have hundreds. HFL has no access to these customers. They pay cash to
the HFL distributor. There is no practical way for HFL to track them or communicate with them. 
People become distributors in an MLM company for one of three reasons: 1. To get the distributor discount for their
own personal consumption of the product. 2. To be able to sell a little bit of it or even maybe a lot of it. ( I have some
distributors that sell thousands worth a month online and direct to consumers at full suggested retail. I own a MLM
competitor to HFL). 3. To build a network of 1s, 2s, and 3s and earn the overrides on their total sales. 
Many people initially intend to build a network and then find out how hard it is and revert to a 1 or 2 or quit entirely. 
Of course someone that builds a network of distributors who in total sell hundreds of thousands or millions of products
earn more than someone selling a few hundred...that does not mean they are paid for "recruiting". That is actually
illegal. They are paid for THE SALES of those they recruit and the resulting network. 
HFLs net sales are those for which they actually receive cash from their distributors. Their "retail" sales are the retail
value of all product sold regardless of the actual price. 
HFL is far from a pyramid scheme. You might look to the stock markets in our country for one or more of those. HFL is
a 32 year old tax paying, 5000 job creating, wealth building health company that has grown through every adversity
and cheap shot thrown at it. 
Ackman and the rest of the shorters are just Jackals feeding on the cache of Lions

Hi, I am long the HLF stock and I have been sitting on the board of a MLM company for the last 3 years as
representative of a bulge bracked investment firm.


1. True. the 90% is most probably wrong. But what does it matter? Most so called distributors are customers who buy
at a discount. Only a very small fraction are distributors who want to build a sustainable business. What is the real
question here? that there are no buyers/consumers of the products? if this is true, how do you explain net sales (NOT
retail sales of $20bn between 2002 - 2011 (and product sales of $11.1bn) since 2007: was this all dumped into the
sink?). How do you explain that direct selling companies exist since a long period of time: Avon ($8bn sales) since
1886, Amway ($7.8bn sales) since 1959, HLF ($3.5bn sales) since 1980, Vorwerk ($2.2bn sales) since 1883,
Tupperware ($1.7bn sales) since 1946 - they dont advertise but its a huge established industry even if it is not visible
to everyone (especially those well off with time and money to invest in shares...). How do you explain where dividends
and share buy-backs are coming from (I am still waiting to see how all the issues on accounting will impact EBITDA
and cash)?


2. I like the "evidence" brough forward from some random 2009 Lieberman study that apparently had some issues in
methodology. I however feel that concluding from datapoint N = 1 there that the Lieberman research (that might or
might not be) presented will be wrong or biased is a most dubious. Unclear to me how this would go down in statistics
101.


3. "Shut this whole thing down". What are the odds? What internationail business (80% of HLF) can the FTC shut
down? Even if, which share price does this imply? How long will it take? What about cigarette, guns, and other
harmful industries?


the only short thesis that works is to create panik in the media and therefore in the markets. From my experience in
MLM, these businesses show great resilience (also with respect to outside attacks). Hence, good luck with the short
thesis.

Good day


Just consult the distributors for the name of there customer base and the problem is solved.


If Herbalife has to count customers then all of the retail company's selling Toothpast, Margarine ect must also start
doing so.


Doesn't it sounds outrageous

I have been a Herbalife distributor for 23 years. The statement that 90% of Herbalife product sales goes to
"customers outside distribution network"... Perhaps Santa Clause and Easter Bunny are real too?


In all my 23 years as a distributor I have never had more than 10 customers a month, the fact is that the vast majority
of the products the distributors buy are consumed by them self.


You can consume easily $1,000 worth of products or even $1,500 worth of products yourself a month, just so you can
qualify to earn royalties from your down-line distributors.


"Those consumers who purchased Herbalife product, more than 90% were outside our distribution network"
statement, perhaps that also include all the products sold on the black market in unopened countries like UAE or
Dubai?


Here are some websites where you can buy products in unopened markets: http://bit.ly/WHwRot

What Ackman has exposed is just the tip of an iceberg, in my opinion a MLM company should not be a publicly listed
company, as there are too much covering up going on in the background..

Can anyone trust a professional short seller to tell the truth? Isn't it in their best interest to lie? To me, they are much
worse than anyone engaged in MLM and I think they will say anything to scare people and cause the price of the
stock they have shorted to drop.


I pay Costco and Sams Club annual membership fees so I can get a discount. I am a "Business" member of both (like
a Distributor) but like 90% of their customers I buy for my personal use, not to re-sell. No one calls them pyramids or
scams. Do they track whether I consume or sell what I buy? Of course not. The short sellers will say anything to try to
scare people. They are only out for themselves.


There were only 40 complaints with the FTC last year about HLF which isn't many for a large consumer products
company and they have a 12 month buy back guarantee so if someone wants to get out they can.


Ackman claimed that 95% of HLF's revenue is from fees paid by distributors. 95% of $3.9 Billion is $3.7 B. Assume
that distributors paid $100 each in fees to HLF ($100 is a lot of money in many countries). That would mean 37 million
people paid $100 during a 12 month period. That = 12% of the US population and is more people than are in the 25
largest US cities. How likely is that?


Pyramid Schemes don't have $3.9 Billion of TTM revenues, offer a one year buyback , stay in business for 30 years,
and buy their own stock at market prices.

Ackman has been called the PT Barnum of the hedge fund industry - Barnum said there is a sucker born every
minute. He is ridiculously self-serving yet he tries to convince suckers he is a do gooder. "I have a 20 million share
short position but I am only doing this because I am a patriot and trying to help the little guy."


I am long HLF and think it will be $45 by Jan. 12.

Read Confidence Game and see that even after 5 years of making presentation after presentation to insurance
commissions, Congressional Hearing, FTC, etc. etc. the credibility of a short-seller is minimized by government
agencies. While hAckman was absolute right on MBIA, nobody cared until the MBS market blew up. He laid it all out
for everybody and was ignored.


HLF will have made tons of money for long investors either short term (if there is an LBO, which I expect shortly) or
long term over the next few years as they use their enormous cash flow to buy back stock before the FTC twitches
once ;>>)

Forget about the LBO. Now, that Loeb and Icahn (reportedly)have considerable long stakes in the stock, you
would have to do such an LBO at much higher prices. They won't sell it to you much below $55-$60. That, in
turn, would mean that you must take on about $6bn in debt. Now, which bank will be willing to lend that
amount? Against what collateral? expected cash flows may be all fine, but as a senior loan officer at a big
bank you need good collateral in order to justify making such a big loan. HLF has little tangible book value,
almost zero liquidation value - so forget about any major bank giving you said loan. some venture capital
firms might - but they sure will demand pretty high interest rates to compensate for the risk. just say 7%
(which would still be low). that would kill the company's entire FCF just for interest payments. 
Ackman may be wrong with his conclusion( even though he is certainly right with most of his allegations). But
he definitely is not dumb. When you short 20% of a public company you do carefully evaluate what financial
defense that company may be able to build up.

The shorts here are getting nasty... 
Time to face reality. you followed an idiot who invested in Borders and JC Penny. 
There are so many better sources for investment ideas.

That would actually go themselves to a couple of Borders/JCP before spending $B's of investors money on finished
businesses


time to cut your losses and stop this hopeless nagging over here. 
The real squeeze is still ahead. When Hackman gets squeezed is when it will get really ugly... a rush to cover 30+%
of the float... yaicks


I know I will not be selling my long position for at least 6 months, OK maybe sell @ $70


17 Jan 2013, 06:52 AM


SeattleGoldMiner
I am laughing....All of this talk about what % distributors make, who is buying the product etc. is 100% meaningless
for Ackman, Loeb etc...Just like the noise about other stocks unless their accounting is phony. But if they have the
cash they say and if they record the sales they have then unless they are selling marijuana in North Carolina, they are
fine.
