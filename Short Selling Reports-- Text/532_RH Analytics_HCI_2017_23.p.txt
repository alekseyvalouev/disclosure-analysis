Irma's Projected Landfall:  Who Is The Most Exposed Of All?
Sep. 7, 2017 11:36 AM ET34 comments
by: RH Analytics


Summary


Irma is currently forecast to make landfall in South Florida.


All Florida insurers have high exposure in the catastrophe prone Tri-county area.


HCI and UVE have the highest exposure of the Florida domestics.


The latest forecasts are for Irma to make landfall Sunday morning as a CAT 4 or CAT 5
hurricane in Miami-Dade county. The exposure of the Florida domestics varies in both
quantity and quality of exposure. HCI Group (NYSE:HCI) and Universal Insurance
Holdings (NYSEMKT:UVE) have the highest exposure in the projected area of
landfall.


The table below shows the insurers exposure to the Tri-county area, which is Miami-Dade,
Broward and Palm Beach counties. They are heavily populated with coastal building and
the most hurricane prone areas in the state.


1Q17 Tri-county Exposure


Source: FLOIR.


The percentages shown are the company's percentage of policies and percentage of total
insured value in the zone. 39% of HCI's policies and 40.1% of the company's total insured
value is located in the Tri-county area.

TIV/Policies is a very rough measure of value of the structures insured. Generally, we
would like to see higher value structures, as it suggests newer, higher quality structures.
Not surprisingly, UVE and HCI have the lowest values. In our view, this is indicative of
older, lower value insured structures. We have shown this in previous research regarding
an HCI wind-only takeout where 84% of the Tri-county structures were built prior to 1989
and 32% prior to 1959. Older low-value structures are more vulnerable to be
damaged during hurricanes.


HCI and UVE have the highest exposures to Tri-county policies and insured value. It is not
only quantity, but quality as well that sets the two insurers apart. In our view, the low
TIV/policies number indicates that they are insuring older, low-value structures - precisely
the types of home that suffer most from catastrophic events.


There is still uncertainty in Irma's forecast. However, if the storm makes landfall in the Tri-
county area, it is reasonable to expect that both HCI and UVE will suffer proportionally
greater losses than the other insurers.


Disclosure: I am/we are short HCI, UVE.

You didn't address re-insurance. As a result, your analysis is baseless and therefore without value.

But, but, but, that's how shorts make their $$$, by only telling part of the story and profiting by the subsequent
FUD ( Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt). The traders can go short, I'll go long and come back in 3 years or less and
we'll see who has double digit annualized gains.

Agree. The author obviously does not understand the Insurance market and total exposure .

The author may understand reinsurance but completely neglected to mention it in this article, perhaps
because he's short. Regardless the reason, it effectively makes the article deceptive and worthless.


UVE put out a press release yesterday indicating their maximum exposure to claims was $35M. The rest is
covered by reinsurance, up to $2.65B.


07 Sep 2017, 01:53 PM

But their total insured liability in Florida is $185 billion. I own the stock. I'd like to think they've offset enough
risk but I'm afraid $2.5B isn't enough. Please enlighten me because I admittedly know very little about this.


07 Sep 2017, 08:56 PM

$139.7B for Florida


07 Sep 2017, 09:41 PM

Yes, you are correct. But even that figure would seem to exceed their reinsurance buffer. What then?


07 Sep 2017, 10:57 PM


admiralonline
Take it from the float and investments. Yes not a buy in my book. I think its more than $2.5 Reinsurance risk
here

I'm not following you. What do you mean by take it from the float and nvestments?

So if they use up the $2.5B and have other losses those losses come out of the premiums paid and other
investments they have. With $400M in equity that doesn't leave enough to me.

"Read his piece from two years ago. He understands reinsurance: "


Really? 
At the time of his writing (UVE share price at $16), I asked myself when did he open his short? 
If it was above $20 I would have covered at that time (with a 30% plus on a short in only a few days), if he
opened it at 16 bucks, I would have said he's a little bit late to the party.  
Which turned out to be true.

On Miami, Hurricane would not probably be so strong than anticipated : http://bit.ly/2xdyhoL


Probably no more than 64KT (119/KMH)


07 Sep 2017, 12:30 PM


tzac22
So expected drop from 150 KTS to 64KTS over the next 5 days? Any idea what Harvey was when it hit
landfall?


07 Sep 2017, 01:22 PM


RedFalcon
Harvey was 50, as in 50 inches of rain. Different type of storm with different type of damage.

Right, rain causes more damages than wind !


Irma is around 10 inches average.

I think UVE has further to fall up until the aftermath of Irma and possibly even into their next earnings release.
Intriguing time to consider a long position, but I don't want to jump in too early.

UVE press release ahead of IRMA -


As publicly disclosed at the time, UPCIC has a net retention of $35 million per catastrophe event for losses incurred,
in all states, up to a first event loss of $2.65 billion. In addition, under an excess catastrophe contract specifically
covering risks located outside the state of Florida and intended to further reduce UPCIC's $35 million net retention,
UPCIC has obtained catastrophe coverage of $30 million in excess of $5 million covering certain loss occurrences,
including hurricanes, in states outside of Florida.

So with $185B in total coverage, where does that leave them?


07 Sep 2017, 08:58 PM

quick question where did you get 185B. sorry just observing not buying or selling


07 Sep 2017, 09:09 PM

When 2010 catastroph occured with almost the same magnitude, UVE never reimbursed 139B usd.


Total amount insured is completely not the amount clients will receive.

As for if Florida insurers are financially ready to handle a storm like Irma, investors expressed skepticism as stocks for
Florida domestic companies suffered losses all week. Heritage Property & Casualty Insurance Co.’s stocks hit record
lows on Tuesday and closed down 17.0 percent, prompting its CEO and Chairman Bruce Lucas to release a
statement reassuring that the company is well capitalized to handle the losses from a major storm like Irma. The
homeowners insurance company had over 236,000 policies in force in Florida as of March 31, 2017. 
“With the approach of Hurricane Irma, it’s important to remember that our current year’s program reduced our
windstorm retention by half from $40 million to only $20 million for the first catastrophic event. We have approximately
$1.75 billion of first event reinsurance in Florida. To put this amount in perspective, Hurricane Andrew, a powerful
category 5 hurricane that struck southeast Florida, is estimated to produce a gross loss on our portfolio of $813.1
million. 
“Furthermore, our reinsurance models provide that even after enduring a Hurricane Andrew loss, Heritage will only
have exhausted approximately 30 percent of its catastrophe reinsurance,” Lucas said. 
Florida-based Universal Insurance Holdings, which had more than 584,000 policies in force in the state as of March

“We have a tremendous balance sheet, we have a close to 300-page disaster-recovery plan that we began to

As of now, it looks like WEST coast of Florida will bear the brunt of Irma. Which insurers have the most exposure to
the west coast of Florida? How would the above table look like for the west coast of Florida?


08 Sep 2017, 06:10 PM


Deep value strict investor
I don't know but west coast will be relatively save according to NHS projections.


09 Sep 2017, 02:46 AM


Deep value strict investor
Last NHS projections changed and west coast is no more safe than east at the present time.
