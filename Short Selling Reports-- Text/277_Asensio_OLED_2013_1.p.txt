Goldman has substantial clean up job do to on
their Universal Display report from yesterday.


Posted on September 6, 2013 by asensio.com


We attribute yesterday’s trading in Universal Display Corporation


(NASDAQ: OLED) to a report put out by Brian Lee at Goldman Sachs,


who suggested that UDC may raise its FY13 guidance based on new


Samsung product launches.  But this is completely out of line with


statements that UDC management made to investors and to Mr. Lee


himself during UDC’s last quarterly earnings call on August 8.


UDC claimed they didn’t know what specific products their


materials were being used for.  They didn’t know whether green


emitter and host materials sales would remain at the current pace. 


They didn’t know what the ratio of red vs. green emitter or emitter


vs. host sales would be going forward.  They didn’t know if the


second quarter sales represented a non-recurring inventory


buildup.  And they couldn’t give a specific explanation as to why


red emitter sales have dramatically failed to keep pace with


Samsung’s unit sales of products that purportedly use UDC


materials, while green emitter have supposedly ramped up.


Mr. Lee’s note yesterday relied on undisclosed “channel checks.”


Channel checks normally mean calls to distributors and retailers to


discuss inventory levels, sales and pricing, Mr. Lee doesn’t explain


why a distributor would know about minute details of no


significance to them, much less does he explain how they would


know more than UDC itself.


Even as many other sell-side analysts have vacillated in their


recommendations on UDC shares, Goldman, which managed UDC’s


secondary offering, has remained unwaveringly bullish on UDC. 


We believe that UDC management’s inability to give a clear view of


their business is enough to undermine hypothetical estimates from


undisclosed third parties regarding Samsung material purchases.

And this should be evident from management’s statements below,


with what we see as a constant reiteration of ‘we don’t know.’


Here are some excerpts from UDC’s second quarter earnings


conference call, emphasis added:


<Q – Brian K. Lee>… it does sound like visibility has improved. You
mentioned specifically the first phone to use both red and green has


been the driver of growth this quarter, and it’s been now for three


and a half months. Can you provide any color on the second half,


how many other devices you might be expecting to use both red


and green?


<A – Sidney D. Rosenblatt>: Well, it’s difficult for us to talk for our


customer. We believe that Samsung Display Corporation, our


customer, will continue to buy these materials for their devices. We


don’t really have visibility into what the end product is that


Samsung Electronics puts them in. But we right now based upon, as


I said, discussions with our customer, we’re comfortable at the top


end.


<Q – Susie Min>: …how we should be thinking about the mix
between red and green going forward… just given if utilization
yields is improving for some of your customers, how that might


impact the way we should think about the mix of your material


sales?


<A – Steven V. Abramson>: Well, it’s still very early stage and for red


– for green for commercial production, our


product mix is shifting. We continue to change as – it continues to


change as we add new materials, and it’s – even


though we’ve seen – they’ve been using red for about four years, so


we’ve pretty much have seen the efficiencies


through – in red. They’re at the early – they’re at the beginning of


the ramp in terms of efficiencies for green. We really don’t know. As


we’ve said, it’s only been a few months that we’ve been selling it.


We probably will have a better feel for what the efficiency ramp is


over the next two quarters. Whether they continue – whether the


efficiency ramp is steep or not steep, we really don’t know. They are


different materials; they’re deposited differently; they have


different results. So I don’t think you can take from one and


translate it directly to the other.


<A – Sidney D. Rosenblatt>: I think your question is what’s the ratio


between green and green host materials?…And it is still a little bit
early for us to predict in terms of what the specific ratio is. I mean,


you can see, in terms of dollars, green emitters were higher dollars


than the host materials. And the host

materials, as you’re well aware, that we do sell them to Nippon


Steel Chemical who then sells it to – they actually do


some – they blend it with some of their materials, and they sell it to


Samsung themselves. So, the ratio has been a little bit it fluctuates


and I think we’ll probably have to have at least two more quarters


of high volume manufacturing, including red and green, before I


could really give you an answer to that question.


 


<Q – John F. Bright>: But inventory in generally related and your


hesitancy to get more aggressive on your guidance is probably


because they’re picking up, they’re building their inventory and you


don’t want to get ahead of them on forecasts.


<A – Steven V. Abramson>: They could be buying materials for their


pipeline too, or we just don’t know.


And here is what UDC told Mr. Lee before the second quarter


earnings call:


Brian K. Lee…There’s been a lot of speculation about the green
materials being featured prominently in next flagship Galaxy phone


for Samsung. To the extent that you can, can you give us any kind of


commentary around your visibility there?


Sidney D. Rosenblatt All I really can do is quote Rob Stone from


Cowen, who in his report last week talked about Galaxy IV having


UDC’s green material in it because he said that it was stated to have


– be 25% more power efficient. There was a report out that was


from Duksan Hi-Metal that talked about it….
