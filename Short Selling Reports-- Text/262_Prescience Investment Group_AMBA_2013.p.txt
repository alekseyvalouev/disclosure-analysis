Ambarella: Channel Checks Point To Earnings Miss, Significant
Downside
Aug. 26, 2013 7:25 AM ET46 comments
by: Prescience Investment Group


We believe Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA) will miss the Street's FQ3'14 consensus
estimates, resulting in downward revisions to FY'14 and FY'15 estimates. Our channel
checks with Ambarella's largest customer Chicony, checks within AMBA's supply chain,
and conversations with various analysts indicate that AMBA's fastest growing business
segment, selling SoCs to be embedded in GoPro wearable cameras, has significantly
weakened.


Based on conversations with the sell-side, current Street estimates for 20% QoQ revenue
growth in FQ3'14 are based on extrapolation of FQ3'13 results; FQ3'13 was a boom time
for AMBA on the back of a successful GoPro Hero3 product launch. Revenue from GoPro
wearable camera SoCs have grown from 4% to 42% of AMBA's consolidated sales in the
year spanning FQ1'13 to FQ1'14. Our research, however, indicates that growth in Hero3
sales is currently dwindling and that a GoPro Hero3 refresh cycle will not take place in
2H'2013. While we do expect AMBA's non-GoPro revenue to grow, it is unlikely to provide
the kind of growth needed to offset the potential revenue shortfall from the GoPro-related
business. Against the backdrop of AMBA's non-GoPro revenue having grown between
-25% and +19% QoQ (and actually declining sequentially in three out of the four quarters),
current Street estimates appear unachievable.


While AMBA is well positioned in several growing markets, and we like its business for the
long term, it has a customer concentration issue. Once a top- or bottom-line miss occurs,
fears surrounding the opacity of its end markets, its high customer concentration and the
elevated risk of end product cycle delay are likely to reemerge, with the company's
multiple contracting toward levels last seen at its 2012 IPO, or 10x EPS.


AMBA currently trades at LTM and forward P/E multiples of 22x and 14x. We believe the
stock has an intrinsic worth of $11.40 per share, or 12x our FY15 EPS estimate, indicating
25% downside from current levels.


Business Overview


We began analyzing AMBA as a potential long because we believe it to have an attractive
competitive position as a fabless semiconductor manufacturer serving high-growth, niche
end markets. The company was founded in 2004 by a group of industry veterans with

extensive experience building video processing and encoding semiconductors. It is a
leading developer of low-power, high-definition video compression and image processing
semiconductors. The company's products are used in a variety of high definition cameras,
including security IP-cameras, wearable sports cameras, and automotive video recorders.
Ambarella technology is also used in television broadcasting infrastructure systems with
video content encoded and transmitted to audiences around the world.


Although the company does not provide a revenue breakdown of sales into its various end
markets, the chart below contains our estimates of its FQ1'14 (fiscal quarter ending in
April 30, 2013) revenue split based on data from past earnings calls and company filings.


AMBA's wearable camera segment is its largest revenue contributor, making up 42% of
consolidated revenue. Almost all of this revenue is generated from the sale of chips
embedded into wearable cameras produced by private company GoPro. GoPro camera
sales have more than doubled every year since debuting in 2004, and its units are
estimated to have accounted for 21.5% of digital camcorder shipments nationwide in the
first half of 2012. GoPro's current Hero3 sports camera line was launched in November
2012, and the current flagship model Hero3 Black Edition is powered by AMBA's A7 SoC.

AMBA's primary customer Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd. is the original design
manufacturer, or ODM, for GoPro's cameras. Chicony buys AMBA's chips and assembles
them into GoPro's cameras.


In the figures below, we estimate the amount of AMBA revenue that is the direct result of
GoPro Hero3 camera sales (based off AMBA's sales to ODM Chicony), and observe a
strong and steady ramp over the past five quarters. AMBA's GoPro-related revenue grew
from 4% to 42% of consolidated sales in the year spanning FQ1'13 to FQ1'14.

While revenue contribution from GoPro Hero3-related sales has exhibited rapid growth,
non-GoPro Hero3 revenue has been relatively stagnant. In fact, non-GoPro related
revenue declined sequentially in three out of the four most recent quarters and grew
between -25% to +19% QoQ. In its strongest showing (FQ3'13), this revenue stream grew
18% sequentially.


Channel Checks Indicate GoPro Camera Sales Growth in Decline, AMBA to Miss
Street Estimates


Based on our channel checks, we believe that while AMBA has the potential to meet the
Street's FQ2'14 consensus estimates, it will miss on FQ3'14 (fiscal quarter ending October
31, 2013) and FY'2014 (fiscal year ending January 31, 2014) estimates. FQ2'14
consensus estimate assumes AMBA's revenue will come in at the midpoint of
management guidance, implying QoQ revenue growth of 6% to $35.9 million. Street
expectations for FQ3'14 (quarter ending October 31, 2013) - for which AMBA has not
issued guidance - assume 20% QoQ revenue growth; we believe this expectation is
unachievable and that downward revisions to sell-side estimates will follow AMBA's
issuance of FQ3'14 guidance when it reports FQ2'14 results.


Our conversations with sell-side analysts indicate they've based their FQ3'14 estimates on
simple extrapolations of previous results, but based on AMBA's very limited history this
would seem misguided. Their estimates are grounded on the following assumptions:


1. Steady year-over-year growth rate
2. Strong seasonality, especially for the wearable camera segment
3. Extrapolation of management's qualitative comments


Given AMBA's high concentration of Chicony / GoPro Hero3-related revenue, it is critical
GoPro sales continue to grow rapidly for AMBA to meet the FQ3'14 target (20% QoQ
revenue growth); based on our channel checks, this is not happening.


Our call with GoPro ODM Chicony last week raises serious concerns regarding GoPro
Hero3's sales momentum; it has slowed substantially. According to Chicony, its revenue
from GoPro Hero3 peaked in CQ1'13. In CQ2'13, the GoPro revenue was down at least



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/8/330007_13775146398126_rId11.png
5/22/2018 Ambarella: Channel Checks Point To Earnings Miss, Significant Downside - Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1656392-ambarella-channel-checks-point-to-earnings-miss-significant-downside 5/15


20% QoQ, and in CQ3'13 GoPro revenue will be down again QoQ. Chicony attributes the
sequential decline to 1) a strong product launch in Q4'12 and 2) lack of product refresh for
2013. The same data point was echoed by Citi's Chicony analyst who attended Chicony's
analyst meeting Tuesday two weeks ago. At the meeting, the company guided for almost
no contribution from GoPro in 2H'2013.


A possible explanation for Chicony's declining GoPro revenue is that the next GoPro
product will be manufactured by another ODM, such as Foxconn, which owns 9% stake of
GoPro. Chicony, however, denies this, citing that the firmware it developed for Hero3 is not
easily duplicable and stating that it does not believe it has lost GoPro's business to
another ODM.


Regardless of which company is chosen to manufacture the next generation of GoPro
camera, Chicony's guidance implies that GoPro's Hero3 refresh cycle will not take place in
2H'2013, and that it has instead likely been pushed out to 2014. Citi's Chicony analyst has
affirmed that no new GoPro product has been defined, corroborating this view. AMBA
management's comments also indicate this to be the case. It is widely speculated that
AMBA's next generation A9 SoC is the logical choice to power the next generation
flagship GoPro camera. However, according to AMBA CEO Fermi Wang on the recent
FQ1'14 earnings call, the A9 chip will not make it into end market products until next year:
Upon being asked about the status of the A9 silicon, he responded that, "[t]hat is targeting
more on the sports camera side. And we do have design wins that we're working on.
Again, I think that those products will not come out until early next year." Further, our
conversations with sources in Ambarella's supply chain indicate that the A9 SoC is
currently in trial, but not yet in full production.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1656392-ambarella-channel-checks-point-to-earnings-miss-significant-downside 6/15


Accordingly, if we assume AMBA's GoPro Hero3 revenue remains flat in FQ3'14 (rather
than assuming the 20% decline as suggested by Chicony), AMBA will need to grow its
non-Chicony revenue by 33% QoQ in order to meet consensus revenue estimates. While
we do expect non-Chicony revenue to grow, it is unlikely to provide the kind of growth
necessary to offset the potential revenue shortfall from the GoPro-related business.
Against the backdrop of AMBA's non-Chicony revenue having grown between -25% and
+19% QoQ (and again, actually declining sequentially in three out of the four quarters),
current Street estimates appear unachievable.


We Believe AMBA Shares have 25% Downside from Current Levels


We believe investors are likely to soon develop a greater appreciation of the lack of
predictability in AMBA's quarterly growth patterns. While AMBA's three camera markets
are generally growing, it is difficult to estimate the quarterly growth patterns with a great
deal of accuracy. AMBA's wearable camera end market is currently dominated by
business with private company GoPro, which neither discloses its sales numbers nor
offers clues as to the timing of new product launches. AMBA's IP camera end market is
fragmented, and concrete data pertaining to this market is hard to come by, as we
discovered in conducting primary research: Even though data from third party market
research firms and key vendors are directionally consistent, they vary by a large margin.
AMBA's automobile camera end market, an Asian and Russian phenomenon, is equally
difficult to track; the manufacturers' landscape is similar to that for white-label
smartphones in China, in that there are just too many small vendors to track.


We believe that due to concerns regarding AMBA's unpredictable growth profile, investors
valued the company at a modest 10x forward P/E multiple at its IPO. Since then, the
company has beaten consensus estimates in three consecutive quarters, and the equity
was subsequently bid up to reach a recent high of 18x EPS. We believe forgotten
concerns could soon be remembered. While AMBA is well positioned in several growing
markets, and we like its business, it has a customer concentration issue. Once a top- or

bottom-line miss occurs, fears surrounding the opacity of its end markets, its high
customer concentration and the high risk of end product cycle delay are likely to
reemerge, and the company's multiple is likely to contract toward levels last seen at its
IPO.


We believe AMBA is set to miss earnings expectations. The Street currently expects the
company's top line to grow at 5% and 20% QoQ in FQ2'14 and FQ3'14, respectively. The
data points we have gathered indicate investors will be disappointed. We expect
downward revisions of FY'14 and FY'15 estimates to follow, and believe the company can
generate EPS of $0.80 and $0.95 in FY'14 and FY'15, respectively (vs. current consensus
estimates of $0.85 and $1.10). We believe the stock has an intrinsic worth of $11.40 per
share, or 12x our FY15 EPS estimate, indicating 25% downside from current levels.

On your Feb. 1 attack on AVG when it was at $12.83 citing Google's competition will drive down AVG to $8.5 to %10.
And, it did not happen at all. At three weeks, AVG came out earning and the stock zoom up to $16+ and now traded
at $21-$22.


How accurate your prediction will lead us to this new one? It seems you have AMBA's sell information already, that I

"Based on our channel checks, we believe that while AMBA has the potential to meet the Street's FQ2'14 consensus
estimates, it will miss on FQ3'14 (fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2013) and FY'2014 (fiscal year ending January 31,
2014) estimates."


I believe there's an error here. What you are trying to say is they will meet the July number (fiscal 2Q), but miss the
October number on the forward guide (fiscal 3Q), right?


You have the "3Q" part right above, but incorrectly call that the July quarter.

Regarded Solutions, Contributor
this would appear to be quite self serving, since GoPro is a smaller part of AMBA overall business. You neglect to cite
the rapid growth of security and auto segments which actually were main drivers for the ovrall growth.


nor do you refer to the 4k arena in which AMBA has the best of breed technology and far outpaces any other.


have you even heard of LOOQSIE (spelling), inc?


are you attempting to cover your short position before the 9/5 conference call that might drive the stock even higher
than recent highs?


note the previous comments from june:


"We are very pleased with our progress in the first fiscal quarter, with total revenue up 31% over the first quarter of
last year and with the successful addition of new customers in key markets," said Fermi Wang, President and CEO of
Ambarella. "During the quarter, we made excellent progress in the IP security camera market with new design wins at
both professional and consumer IP-camera customers. We also saw especially strong revenue growth in the
wearable sports camera category, led by market leader GoPro. In the automotive camera after-market, we continued
to grow revenue while successfully expanding our customer base."


Please go back and check AMBA overall business and do some research in the other core areas aside from the
business of one of their customers.


you just might want to cover that short position of yours, sooner, than later.

If you read the companies last 10Q you'll see that Chicony (customer B, a direct ODM customer mentioned below)
represented only 7% of sales. 
"The customers representing 10% or more of revenue and accounts receivable were customer A, a logistic provider,
and customer B, a direct ODM customer, that combined accounted for approximately 82% of total revenue for the
three months ended April 30, 2013. The customer representing 10% or more of revenue and accounts receivable for
the three months ended April 30, 2012 was only customer A, a logistic provider, which accounted for approximately
75% of total revenue."

Ashraf: I read many of yours and believe you a lot. But, you can not deny there are many others using the

I believe that articles on SA should be used as a starting point for research - not as end-all, be-all
recommendations.


Look at it this way - if you believe that the author is wrong, then this is a good buying opportunity given the
recent sell-off, since at the end of the day, earnings make-or-break a stock. If the author turns out to be right,
then there can be money made being short.

I've spent some time researching this company and thought this was a well written article.


Readers should understand that "Regarded Solutions" is incorrect in his assessment of AMBA's revenues. Not only is
he wrong, but he belittles the author's analysis in a condescending way when in fact he is the one who should be
researching more diligently.


It's a fact that AMBA's growth this year is being driven by the retail sales of the Gopro Hero 3. It's a wonderful product
that is probably the number one complement to smartphones right now. But if your channel checks indicate demand
weakness, then likely inventory has built up and company won't derive anymore growth revenue. It's interesting
because management in the CC said hero 3 demand should be just fine during holiday season of 2013.


Not sure who to believe but it seems weird Chicony would just flat out reveal that demand is weak.

BoboTheDog
Some problems with this analysis


1) Despite Chicony's claims, it's reasonable to assume that Terry Guo (Foxconn) didn't spend $200MM investing in
GoPro and take a seat on the board without some assurance that Foxconn would get a good bit of GoPro's business.


2) GoPro is a consumer product. So it is perfectly reasonable to assume seasonality (Christmas) would lead to a
bigger Q3.


3) In FY '13 revenues were up 28% from q2-q3. So 20% for FY '14 certainly doesn't sound like a stretch.


4) Ambarella announced the A9 in *January* and said it was "available now" (presumably in demo/development
quantities). It should be in production by now.


5) Hero 2/3 were announced in late fall 2011/12. If Hero 4 follows this pattern AMBA's Q3 could be huge.

Oops Eaid! AMBA beat and provided upside guidance. It has five markets, some stronger than others but none off the
cliff as you suggest. The stock has rebounded 15 percent since this article and is up 9.5 percent more tonight for a
total gain of nearly 26 percent in 9 trading days!

Thank you author for giving me better entry points for the stock.

Now his comment was a doozie. Don't know who he checked with, but when I saw this report, I checked others. They
even beat the others marks, which called for consensus basically. I think I'm gonna rely on other reports for AMBA.

Shame on me for assuming that there is any rationality or efficiency whatsoever in the price movement of stocks like
AMBA. I was naïve enough to think that the huge price drop a couple of weeks ago had something to do with reality.

what a tremendously awesome fade.


Solid beat, stock up big AH.


This article, best case, was simply to use a cover to get out of the position. The info couldn't be any more wrong.

This article led a lot of people into selling AMBA, shortly after publication. After dipping, the stock has been red hot.
Publications of new results surpassed expectations. So: either this article was a blatant attempt to cover up a short
position or wide of the mark. Either way, it drove investors to sell their AMBA-stock with losses.


That certainly puts a nasty stain on how much belief you should put into Seeking Alpha, or at least any future
publications by mr. Asbahi.

I like how this article was a Seeking Alpha's Editors Pick, and it couldn't have been more wrong. But it did afford me
the opportunity to purchase AMBA at a much lower price than it should have been. 
Thank you

Eiad, you analysis was plainly wrong, sad to see that some seemed to believe your story. 
AMBA is far more diversified. 
GoPro has more than one ODM and moved a large line away from Chicony. 
Other AMBA markets are growing faster than sportscam (wearable, IP Cam, CardDV). 
Do your homework next time. Actually, I don't think you can use simple channel analysis for AMBA.

So much for missing the FQ3'14....(chuckle). I get a kick out of going back and reading these old short articles. The
author must feel rather silly at best, considering they beat by 8 cents and the stock is now 10 pts higher since the
article was written.....lol

Bahaa, this should be nominated for worst SA article of 2013, though it did allow me to buy AMBA at $13.34.
What a great article!

Just wanted to write a followup to my post on this article. Take a look at AMBA now, and the reasons it went up 100%
in s6 months. The reason the people here did not see it, is because they didn't understand the technology and its true
potential value to the industry. Now that Google is on board, the ascent will continue. I recommend buying all dips in
this stock. I did sell it at 32 into the runup , but was able to just buy some back below 29 on Friday. It may go back in
the 25 range where I will definitely load up full again. This will be a BIG winner this year.

as of Jan 17, 2014, +122.7%. Eiad did pick the bottom on Aug. 26 - to buy the stock. Listening to his
recommendations sounds like an excellent way to lose money.
