Important Questions Investors Should Ask
Universal Display


Posted on September 17, 2013 by asensio.com


Last week Oppenheimer criticized our initial research report on


Universal Display Corporation (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) that


discussed the devastating findings of a filing at the European Patent


Office (“EPO”). The Oppenheimer analyst stated that the 60+ pages


of filed scientific analysis we referred to “is no different than what


we’ve read in [UDC’s] 10-Q.” Our initial response to Oppenheimer


can be read here.


Today UDC management presented at the Oppenheimer Emerging


Innovations Conference. A webcast of the conference is available


here.


UDC has aggressively sought orders from the U. S. Securities &


Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to prevent analyst and investors


from understanding the most crucial terms of its agreements with


Samsung. Later this week asensio.com will be launching a data


room to present analysis of UDC’s use of SEC CT orders to investors.


Below we are providing questions that show the public disclosures


necessary for investors to assess the credibility of UDC


management’s representations. These questions deal with matters


that are central to our research on UDC and that UDC has avoided


addressing openly with investors.


• Where is the physical basis UDC relies on to justify its claims that


the company “owns” phosphorescent OLED? Specifically, what


experimentation underlies the publication of any results that UDC


uses to support this claim that the company has called a “dramatic


breakthrough?”


• Specifically, who funded the cost and conducted the above


referred to experiments, where were the experiments conducted,

and where were they first published?


• UDC has sought and obtained orders from the SEC allowing


confidential treatment for the redacted portions of the August 2011


supply and licensing agreements with Samsung. The redaction


removed the key terms of the Samsung agreements that analysts


and investors must have to properly evaluate the validity of the


company’s claim that it “owns” phosphorescent OLED. This


redaction essentially destroys the ability of investors to assess the


impact of an adverse patent ruling, especially in the EP-238 case in


November. Is UDC willing to provide investors with all existing


language in its Samsung agreement necessary to for analysts and


investors to evaluate its claims?


• UDC does not disclose the pricing, quantity and timing of its red


emitter material sales to Samsung. UDC’s reported quarterly sales of


red emitter have not reconciled with unit sales of Samsung


products containing red emitter material. In fact, UDC sales of red


emitter material have declined over the past year even as


Samsung’s sales of Galaxy phones have ramped up. UDC’s


explanations of these results lack sufficient factual disclosures to


allow analysts and investors to evaluate their validity, especially


given that UDC’s has prevented analyst and investors from


reviewing its contract with Samsung that governs the reported


results.
