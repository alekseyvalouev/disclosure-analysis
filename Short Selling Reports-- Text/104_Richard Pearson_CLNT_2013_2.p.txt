Market's Epic Mistake Causes Cleantech To Triple
May 28, 2013 8:32 AM ET45 comments
by: Richard Pearson


(Editors' Note: This article covers a micro-cap stock. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


Last Monday, shares of Cleantech Solutions (CLNT) were trading as low as $3.42. By
Thursday the shares had more than tripled to a high of $10.85. The stock, which normally
trades around 60,000 shares per day, traded an astonishing 22 million shares over the
course of last week.


The timing of this surge was very fortuitous for Cleantech, coming shortly after the
company filed an S3 registration statement for a planned equity offering. Cleantech hopes
to raise up to $5 million.


Without the surge in price and volume, any such offering would have been utterly
impossible for the company, which had previously been worth only $9 million in its entirety.
For those who are interested, the details of this S3 are somewhat unusual, and will be
explained in detail below.


The spark for this wild ride was a single press release from Cleantech which noted that
Cleantech had become a "certified supplier" to both Sinopec and CNPC. Sinopec and
CNPC are China's gargantuan oil companies which are responsible for many billions in
equipment orders every year.


Yet by Friday, the stock had already retreated 30% from the high, to close at $7.68.


As I will show below, the market made an epic misjudgment in sending the share price
higher. The result of this is that the share price will likely find itself right back in the $3-4
range in very short order. If Cleantech hopes to take advantage of this surge to raise its $5
million, it had better do so very quickly.


It is certainly the case that many who played this press release did not understand its
meaning. It is also certainly the case that many day traders simply didn't care because
they were only in the trade for a quick pop, which was virtually guaranteed.


Cleantech has repeatedly fallen below the $1.00 mark, making it subject to delisting from
the NASDAQ. As a result, the company has conducted two reverse splits (a 1:3 and a
1:10). The result of these two reverse splits is that Cleantech now has only 2.67 million

shares outstanding. When any spark of good news or hype comes out, the limited supply
of shares virtually guarantees a sharp move upwards. In the past, day traders have caught
on to this and have been quick to make a fast flip trade off of any positive headlines in
Cleantech.


Cleantech's press release made reference to having "received the necessary third party
certifications". What is not mentioned is that these certifications came from Beijing New
Century Certification Co. (北京新世纪认证有限公司) (aka "BCC"). I have confirmed this
both with Cleantech and with BCC.


BCC's website (in English and Chinese) can be found at www.bcc.com.cn. BCC has
issued over 24,000 such certificates to various Chinese entities. For Cleantech,
certification simply meant creating a sample product which conformed to the right size,
shape and forging processing, and delivering it for inspection. Then they paid the
appropriate fee and went through the appropriate documentation requirements and voila,
they could call themselves a "certified supplier".


In short, such certifications do not mean all that much. This is especially true in China,
where similar certifications are almost always obtained by companies for use as marketing
tools. I have often visited various companies in China who have entire walls where similar
designations from local governments and certifying bodies are prominently displayed for
foreign visitors to gaze upon. Many of these companies have secured their wall full of
designations while being engaged in virtually no commercial activity.


For those who wish to confirm certification of an entity, BCC includes a search box on the
Chinese portion of its website, found here. Inside the box labeled "Certificate Number" (证
书号), individuals can verify all details of certification. Many Chinese companies will post
their certificates on their website, such that obtaining the certificate number is very
straightforward. However, when I asked Cleantech for their number, they stated
(somewhat paradoxically) that "from our laywer's view it's not that appropriate to send the
certificate to any individual. We will issue this on our website for all the investers (sic) to
see in the very near future".


So until that time arrives, we will just have to wait.


As noted above, the details of the recent S3 registration statement are worth focusing on.
Within the Plan of Distribution, it is disclosed that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1463951-markets-epic-mistake-causes-cleantech-to-triple 3/20


we may enter into a continuous offering program equity distribution agreement with a
broker-dealer, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from
time to time through a broker-dealer as our sales agent.


If we enter into such a program, sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be
made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on such securities market or
exchange on which our common stock is then traded, at market prices, block
transactions and such other transactions as agreed upon by us and the broker-
dealer.


Under the terms of such a program, we also may sell shares of common stock to
the broker-dealer, as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the
time of sale.


What this means is that "from time to time", Cleantech can simply sell shares to a broker,
who then acts as a principal. The broker can then re-sell the shares to clients in the
market. Ideally the broker could do this entire trade after receiving buy orders for
Cleantech shares at a far higher price. This is far different than a standard offering where
a company retains an investment bank to conduct a single, large offering. With the
Cleantech style of offering, a company can make use of surges in price and volume to
bleed shares into the market without any notice.


The S3 was dated as of April 24th, 2013. On that date, the last closing price had been
$3.58 and the 5 day average volume was 84,000 shares. Assuming a 20% discount (due
to size and illiquidity), a normal offering price would have been set at $2.86. Raising $5
million would therefore require 65% of all outstanding shares to be issued. It would also
require a full month's worth of trading volume to be issued. In short, such a transaction
would be essentially impossible.


But with the surge in price and volume, and with the ability to issue stock "from time to
time" to broker dealers, such a trade would appear far more achievable for Cleantech. So
again, the timing of the share price spike is very fortuitous indeed.


This is not the first dubious transaction for Cleantech.


The last time I wrote about Cleantech was in November of 2012. Author "Biotech
Breakthroughs" had written a pump piece on the stock, boldly stating that the stock should
be trading at $19.00, up more than 5x from its then-level of around $3.50. The stock
immediately jumped by as much as 36% on huge volume.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1463951-markets-epic-mistake-causes-cleantech-to-triple 4/20


Biotech Breakthroughs has written on precisely 3 Chinese small cap companies. In each
case he predicted stratospheric share price rises on these tiny, illiquid Chinese stocks.
And in each case the stock soared for a few days, but then retreated. I have personally
visited each of these 3 companies in China, and in each case I felt I had more than
adequate basis to suspect varying degrees of fraudulent activity. I have contacted Biotech
Breakthroughs, but I have never received a response.


When I wrote about Cleantech, I noted that during my two day visit, I observed only a tiny
handful of employees engaged in no meaningful productive activity. I also noted the
extremely troubling history of its auditor, Sherb and Co. As I noted, with the exception of
Cleantech, 100% of the clients which Sherb signed off on have either been delisted
outright due to fraud or have traded down to the pennies once the market caught on. Were
it not for the reverse splits, Cleantech would be trading in the pennies as well. A complete
list of Sherb's Chinese audit clients (and their fates) can be found in my original article.


Despite the aggressive and direct nature of my article and a 30% drop in the stock,
Cleantech issued no response to it. Instead, about 2 weeks later, Cleantech issued a very
different press release noting that


Cleantech Solutions Management Purchase 157,966 Company Shares


As would be expected for a tiny float company, the share price again soared by nearly
50% on millions of shares of volume. What the market missed was the fact that this
purchase was conducted solely by the Chairman and his wife. More importantly, the
transaction was not an open market purchase, but instead was a new issue of shares by
Cleantech to the Chairman and his wife at a price of just $3.88. This amounts to over 6%
of the entire company being purchased in a private (off market) transaction by insiders. It
is also important to note that this large insider transaction was conducted without
shareholder approval.


The share price quickly hit a high of $5.50 on December 4th, but once it settled down, it
retreated to the $3-4 range. The stock ended the year at $3.97.


During that time, Geoinvesting conducted its own visit to Cleantech and briefly took a
positive view. They noted that, in contrast to my visit, Cleantech had upped its operations
and there was enough activity for their firm to take a short-term long position.


Yet in April, Geoinvesting requested further follow-up from Cleantech including:


Independent verification of cash accounts;

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1463951-markets-epic-mistake-causes-cleantech-to-triple 5/20


Independent verification SAIC/SAT filings;
Independent video coverage of manufacturing operations;


Geoinvesting notes that Cleantech could not comply with this request for independent
verification.


Geo's April 26th report also cites a history of high CFO turnover, raises concern over the
S3 and raises concern regarding auditor Sherb.


In contrast to their initial support, Geoinvesting ultimately came to the conclusion that


Given these developments, we cannot further validate CLNT's operations.


Geoinvesting states that it can no longer support a long position in shares of Cleantech.


So is Cleantech a fraud or not ?


Various market participants, such as Geoinvesting and myself, can only put forth their best
efforts at conducting due diligence and do their best to arrive at the correct conclusion.
However, none of us are the final arbiters as to the presence or absence of fraud.


However it is worth noting that the market as a whole certainly views Cleantech as a
fraudulent company.


In the filings that it reports to the United States SEC, Cleantech claims that it earned a net
income of nearly $6 million in 2012 on revenues of $56 million. Yet the market cap of the
entire company (prior to the recent press release) stood at just $9 million. This means that
Cleantech trades on a PE ratio of just 1.5x. In short, investors as a whole simply do not
believe that the financial results (as reported to the SEC) are real.


There are numerous reasons why investors doubt the legitimacy of Cleantech's results.
The wave of China frauds (including by numerous clients of Sherb and Co) which hit the
US has resulted in suspicion falling upon all Chinese reverse mergers where results
appear to be "too good to be true".


Shortly after my article in November, Cleantech's CFO, Wanfen Xu, resigned. In her place,
the company appointed Adam Wasserman. Mr. Wasserman was the 3rd CFO to serve at
Cleantech during a two year period (which is what gave rise to the CFO concern
expressed by Geoinvesting). Mr. Wasserman had previously served as Cleantech's "vice
president of financial reporting".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1463951-markets-epic-mistake-causes-cleantech-to-triple 6/20


Mr. Wasserman's bio at Marketwatch shows that right now he is concurrently acting as a
senior management figure for no less than 6 small US and Chinese companies including:


CFO at Sanborn Resources
CFO at Yew Bio-Pharm
CFO at Oriental Dragon Corp
CFO at Westergaard.com
CFO CFO at Cleantech Solutions
CEO at Oncall Inc.


Again, he currently is fulfilling all of those management duties at the same time. Typically
each and every one of those roles would comprise a full time job for any one individual. So
it is difficult to imagine how much attention Mr. Wasserman is devoting to Cleantech in
China.


At the rather young age of 48, Mr. Wasserman's resume also includes a very, very
extensive list of small companies for which he has acted as a senior management figure,
including:


CFO at Lotus Pharmaceutical (Chinese reverse merger)
CFO at Gold Horse International (Chinese reverse merger)
CFO at Pershing Gold Corp
CFO at Bohai Pharmaceuticals (Chinese reverse merger)
CFO at Staffing 360 Degrees
CFO at CD International
CFO at Transax International
CFO at Relationserve Media
CFO at Colmena Corp
CFO at Explorations Group
CFO at Genesis Pharmaceuticals
CFO at Cenuco
CFO at Options Media Group
CFO S.E. Asia Trading Co.
CFO Speedhaul Inc.


None of these are necessarily very lucrative roles. For example, at Cleantech Mr.
Wasserman is only paid a base salary of $52,000. But when holding 5 or more
simultaneous CFO roles, the compensation will no doubt add up.

5/22/2018 Market's Epic Mistake Causes Cleantech To Triple - Sharing Economy International Inc. (NASDAQ:SEII) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1463951-markets-epic-mistake-causes-cleantech-to-triple 7/20


As of its most recent 10K filing, Cleantech disclosed the following regarding its ineffective
internal controls designed to prevent fraud:


Management conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under
the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer.


Based on that evaluation, Mr. Wu and Mr. Wasserman concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2012.


In the case of Cleantech, its financial statements themselves (as audited by Sherb) raise
numerous red flags. As of the September quarter (prior to the Chairman's cash injection),
Cleantech reported just $960,000 in cash. Yet it has a receivables balance of over $10
million. It has also reported "prepaid expenses" of $1.7 million.


So investors are left to wonder why a company with almost no cash on hand is advancing
millions of dollars to both its customers (the receivables) as well as to its suppliers
(prepaid expenses).


A company's cash balance is the easiest item within the financial statements to verify. As
a result, investors are aware that companies who commit fraud are forever in need of
accounts which let them state large and growing revenues, but which do not require them
to prove the existence of cash. This is why Geoinvesting requested to verify the
company's cash balance. Yet Cleantech refused this request.


Separately, Cleantech disclosed that:


Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.


The Company did not incur any research and development expense in 2012 and
2011.


This is a glaring red flag to any investor who wonders how Cleantech could possibly have
entirely transformed its very high tech business 4 times in the past 3 years.


Cleantech went from being a high tech windmill component manufacturer, to a high tech
solar component manufacturer, to that of a "high and low temperature dyeing and finishing
machinery for the textile industry", and now (in just the past week) to suddenly being a
supplier of precision components to China's largest oil companies.

Even if the company had been spending millions in R&D, each of these transitions would
have been formidable accomplishments. And yet Cleantech has spent precisely nothing
on R&D for the past 3 years.


The margins are yet another cause for suspicion. It is well known that Chinese
manufacturers of solar and wind power components have nearly competed each other out
of business. Many of these companies are now selling at gross margins which are close to
(or even below) zero. Yet Cleantech continues to report massive gross margins of around
23%. A comparison with any of the other major Chinese suppliers would suggest that such
a competitive feat is quite literally impossible. This is especially true for such a small
company which operates without any meaningful economies of scale. Cleantech reported
that 55.8% of its revenues came from forged rolled rings and components (including to the
wind power industry) while 44.2% of its revenues came from dyeing and finishing
equipment.


Conclusion


Cleantech Solutions has been repeatedly pumped as a "multi-bagger" stock by various
parties over the past year. The ultra-low float of just 2.67 million shares means that any
spark of news or hype can send the stock soaring within hours. Yet in each case the stock
has quickly retreated back to the $3-4 range where it sits on low volume.


The latest "news" regarding Cleantech's certification by BCC was just the latest in the
series on non-events for Cleantech. The fact that this explosive surge occurred
immediately after the filing of an S3 registration statement to raise (a much needed) $5
million should speak for itself.


The market has been pricing this tiny cap Chinese reverse merger as a fraud for years.


While day traders are quick to play the "news driven" pop in the low float stock, it is clear
that there are an abundance of red flags which will keep sensible longer term investors
from owning the stock, even for just a few days.


Cleantech remains as a Chinese reverse merger with a very part-time, absentee US CFO
and a set of entirely nonsensical financial statements.


In all likelihood this stock will fall right back to the $3-4 range within the next week or so,
as it has done in the past. This represents a drop of around 50% from the last traded
share price.

Another bear article by SA so that they benefit with their shorts, and people fall for this time and again. CLNT is worth

The GeoTeam, Marketplace Contributor
As many of our Geo followers are aware we published an article about CLNT (http://seekingalpha.co...) noting what
we found to be a promising development. We observed CLNT operations for some time last fall and came away with
what believed was a busy ongoing operation. However, since our article we have asked management to allow us
more complete access to their operation so we can further substantiate financials and margins. The long and short of
it is the same old song and dance we get from many China based companies in that management offered to “send
us” any documentation (the same documentation sent to CLNT’s auditor) we asked for, but would not allow us


• any direct access to the facilities, 
• to take any video, or  
• give us permission to retrieve SAIC and SAT documents for ourselves.


I don’t think we can be any clearer than we were in our follow-up blog post stating:


[“As we continue to call for a cleansing of the ChinaHybrid space, we as investors have exercised our right not to
invest. In doing so, we have helped to create what could be a fantastic value opportunity if management teams begin
to trust that our true motives are to help them gain investor confidence. It is time that we collectively let these
companies know that if they want our money, certain conditions MUST be met:


• Complete transparency with an openness to independent review; 
• Quality management that cares about investors; 
• Quality advisors: Law Firms, Auditors, IR, and Investment Bankers who have not been tainted over and over again
with fraud associations.


This does not seem like so much to ask for, but we are still looking for that one company.”]


This disappointment alone is enough to keep us from holding a long position in CLNT, but the events of the past
couple of weeks are even more troubling. As stated in Rick’s article it seems there is a very real possibility the CLNT
stock is being manipulated during a time when the company is trying to raise money. It matters little to us if
management is or is not part of stock manipulation activities. What does matter is that it in our view it’s apparently
happening. At this point we view any investment in CLNT as highly speculative. Ultimately, we prefer more certainty in
the investments we make.

Shorts epic mistake-should have been the headline- Pearson from his last article was a big short at 4.50$- you had
about 10% of the float that was short. The company had filed a shelf offering weeks early so you probably had even
more shorts shorting in front of that. That news was nothing but caused a rally which got even more day trading shorts
involved at 6-7$- every rally on Chinese small caps like CLNT has been shorted big and usually works. This time for
whatever reason they over shorted it and imploded 9-10$ range then the company stock fell back after short
implosion to 6$ level- The company did nothing wrong and it was day trading shorts who imploded - no different from
qihu or solar stocks or even tsla-.

The general purpose of this article is to send it out to thousands of people so that when the stock slides, the author
can be in it for the short. It's the same M.O. that they always use, such as the "short" article by Sarah Tyler:  
http://seekingalpha.co...


In this article she declares her short, as if that absolves her of any wrongdoing, and sends the article to the masses,
which in turn, like zombies, short the stock and she makes money. See how it works?

except that Rick has been bearish on CLNT since forever.. so its not as if your above post is the case.

In April, Geoinvesting requested further follow-up from Cleantech including:


Independent verification of cash accounts; 
Independent verification SAIC/SAT filings; 
Independent video coverage of manufacturing operations;


For investors it would be a perfect situation if they would apply to this request, but I don't think they will. It's like asking
an American company such as Monsanto to open their kitchen. Investors would also be rejected to make video
material etc.

Rick and Geo are trusted observers and have quite a lot of experience in the China space, so I don't doubt their

I am still having worthless shares in Lotus Pharmaceuticals. The company which the new CFO of $CLNT was

The problem with most US-listed China small caps is the lack of transparency and corporate governance.

and "Chinese small caps- big squeeze on here. Ccme, rino, chbt, cski, onp- My favorite dgw because of their cash
position ."


CHBT, CCME, DGW and RINO were all delisted due to fraud despite the claimed "cash balances" etc.


Your comments come across as being persistently naive or downright suspect.

What is curious about this company is why they feel that there may be a need to raise further equity capital via their
S3 statement when their debt to equity ratio (ie gearing) is approximately only 3%.


With that huge amount of apparently spare leverage, and with the business being so apparently profitable (gross
margins of around 20% - 24%), it should not be that difficult to obtain bank loans instead of diluting shareholder
ownership.


One might argue that part of the reason is because the company "owns" very little in the way of land use rights (most
of it is either allocated or contributed land use rights, instead of granted land use rights), however instead it does have
a significant portfolio of buildings and equipment (valued at @ $61m) that could be used as security for loans instead.
This assumes that these assets are really worth the value stated, that the company really holds proper and full legal
title to them, and they have not already been used for pledges in undeclared loan guarantees.


Also curious is why the company's annual income expense equates to an annual interest rate of around 13%, when
the company's presented loans in its filings are stated at interest rates of between 6.72% -7.35%. Interest rates of
13% are more common for unsecured loans or loans taken out in the grey market of the shadow banking sector. Or
the company's intra-period debt levels are much higher than its stated end period debt.


The red flag possibilities that could explain these observations do make me concerned about this company.

Geo Investing is a money making Business, not a financial authority  
It sells these kind of reports to investors. 
CLNT should not give them money worth information such as clients & suppliers, that eventually could lead to
competition and harm the company's bottom line.  
CLNT DONT hide anything, it works in a high earnings Chinese market which is hard for investors to get used to. 
To all you shorts out there: Stop confusing everyone. 
Take your earning and Go Long. 


12 Jun 2013, 12:25 PM


Renmycat!
hahaha.. you really think so?!i hope you lose all your money being long.  
why wouldnt CLNT give some info or at least respond to a request by Geoinvesting? ever heard of
ransparency in financial markets? it is needed and absolutely necessary..


you continue to buy shares, get this price up so i can short more. 
stop being naive.

The basic idea of shorting a stock that's worth 14M is ridiculous. The mini-market next to my house is worth
more 
If you think its a fraud then just stay away don't short it.99% of the times stocks don't just go high for no
reason, Its simply a good oppertionity for institutional to grab a long position. 
You can grab a look at google finance and see that 11% of shares are hold by institutional owners:

Renmycat!
if i think its a fraud and going closer to zero, then why wouldn't i short it? your comment to "stay away" makes
no sense.


idea of shorting is not ridiculous when its market cap is closer to zero in my opinion.  
i can close a short position if and when the stock moves up, same as you can close your long if it falls to
protect capital.

Check out the "NOTICE OF EFFECTIVENESS" sec filing which means the company's S3 has been reviewed
by the Commission and this notice marks the successful completion of this review process.


You can find the S3 report(that will provide much more needed information and prove that the company is not
a fraud) by following this link:

An S3 statement and its Notice of Effectiveness only proves that the filing process has been completed within
compliance. It certainly does not prove that a company isn't a fraud.


For example, the financial data is simply taken from previous 10K and 10Q filings, and the auditors have only
given consent to this information being referenced.


Moreover, the statement from the company's S3 registration lawyer includes the sentence:


"As to any facts material to our opinion, we have made no independent investigation of such facts and have
relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance proper, upon certificates of public officials and officers or

other representatives of the Company."


Which means the lawyers have not independently verified the infornation it received.


As I mentioned in an earlier post, the question people should be asking is why this company needs to raise
$5m extra equity related capital when it only has 3% gearing. The latest balance sheet shows total assets of
some $93m, which includes some $61m of property and equipment that it could easily use as security for
bank debt instead of diluting the shareholder base. That is a huge amount of apparent spare leverage.


The company also has some $7m worth of equipment for sale, which could  raise further cash. This is in
addition to the company apparently generating some $10m per year operating cash flow.


All these sources of cash, and yet instead the company wants to tap shareholders for more money. Very
strange.


The company is also very unspecific about the use of the $5m proceeds:


"We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities under this prospectus for general corporate
purposes, including expanding our products, and for general working capital purposes. We may also use a
portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses and products that are complementary to our
own, although we have no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of
the date of this prospectus."


In other words, no plans for major acquisitions that could justify an extra $5m being raised in addition to all
those alternative sources of cash.


The main issue is not whether some investors can or should be short of the stock. Instead it is whether
investors should invest in the stock or just walk away if there are these types of red flags.

Dear nemesisjudge, 
I respect your comment and I understand the conflicts you find while considering taking a long CLNT. 
As a Chinese company it operates in a Chinese business environment. 
Its different.Its got Chinese regulation to deal with,Chinese customers& suppliers while its got to deal with
western PR. 
This is where the conflict occurs.


Western Investors must understand the company is forced to do business the Chinese way and not the way
that we are used to. Im not saying Its a better way but its the only way to surrvie as a Chinese entity.


In times where the US economy goes down, companies that operate within the BRIC and work closly to the
goverment got a huge potential reporting outstanding business results .


We as investors must realize that there is a different way of doing business.


I recommend taking a course in Chinese marketing and financing.

The trend of marking Chinese companies as frauds opens up this huge opportunity investing long in CLNT
as the mkt cap drop down significantly.


16 Jun 2013, 11:44 AM


Renmycat!
mikiamit, 
i respect that you are trying to prove why CLNT is a valid company, but in the end you have to realize the
numerous frauds in small cap chinese stocks in the past few year is making investors uneasy about getting
in/staying in.  
I saw CLNT triple in price based on "news", which Richard Pearson brings to my attention why he thinks is
false (this article), i respect his work, his on the ground due diligence. 
Also geoinvesting has asked the company to provide transparency, the company wont, so they walked away...
this is the kind of "stuff" that investors need the company to do/provide, especially in this small cap chinese
space.  
I will short this stock again when the price goes up, maybe establish a long position waiting for a bounce, and
in no way ever will i be a "holder", eventually i will forget about this company as it goes nowhere.  
there are much better undervalued chinese companies to "park" your cash in, three favourites would be XIN,
ACTS, and SPU (2 of these three pay cash dividends while you wait)


16 Jun 2013, 03:19 PM


nemesisjudge
Dear mikiamit, 
I have considerably more experience and training than you in Chinese equities, business, marketing and
financing, and it is precisely because of that experience that I am concerned about some of the company's
red flags.


If he company's audited filings really are as presented, then it will not have problems obtaining loans from
PRC banks even as a non-SOE, particularly in a manufacturing related sector.


While there are cultural differences with the way business is done in China, this is not an acceptable excuse
to cross the line when there are clear rules for a US listing. If a company does not wish to abide by rules
designed to help protect investors, then it should not list on that stock exchange. There are good reasons why
these rules exist.


RINO argued that booking revenue from contracts that were not even signed was a way business is done in
China. Sino Forest claimed ownership of assets that it did not have legal title to. Puda Coal sold shareholder
assets without their knowledge or consent. ChinaCast Education had huge amounts of undeclared loan
guarantees which they will now have to honor. The list goes on and on. If you think that these things are all ok
just because that's they way business is done in China, then I recommend you study the consequences of
such actions on these companies' share price.

The companies that you have mentioned are a complete fraud. 
I have never mentioned otherwise.


As investors we should examine each company separately.  
Cleantech just now got approvals for new patents.The patents were issued by the state intellectual propety
office of the people's republic of china("SIPO").That process takes 6 months and as probably as you know
requires a great deal of money.  
If CLNT is indeed a fraud why should they spend that money&efforts? How do they obtain the necessary
knowledge to issue a new patent? You and I both know there is much cheaper ways to create false events. 
The importance of such patents in the chinese market is huge. Copying is everywhere. These are all green
flags that CLNT is not a fraud.


16 Jun 2013, 09:57 PM


nemesisjudge
Here are some very well known company frauds that also had Chinese patents issued to them:


RINO International: "We own three patents in the PRC covering our waste water treatment technology." (Last
known audited 10K filing)


Douyuan Global Water: "Currently, we hold eight Chinese patents, two of which are for inventions, five are for
utility models and one is for design." (Last known audited 20F filing).


China Biotics: "As of March 31, 2011, we currently had three patents in total, one for production process, one
for packaging design, and one for packing equipment design." China Biotics also specifically mentions SIPO
and gives the patent numbers. (Last known 10K filing).


Again, I could go on and on.


Therefore you cannot say that patents are proof that a company is not a fraud or that it is not engaged in
some form of fraudulant activity..


What surprises me is that if you have so much experience in China business, then you would know that
Chinese patents are not proof that there is no fraud in a company.


17 Jun 2013, 05:28 AM


tonica2229
Its an indicator that the company is making smart business decision, not anything else.


Some how you choose to ignore all the positive actions&events announced by the company. Try to imagine
what will happen if the government would adapt the new technique the CLNT invented, Its a market of billions
of dollars that would be reinvented by a single company.


Issuing Chinese patents takes time & money- You mark it as a red flag(due to other Chinese fraud companies
that had patents), I call it a great and necessary business decision considering the copying tradition in
china.

No mikiamit, you said that Chinese patents are proof that a company is not a fraud. But I showed very
unequivocally that there are companies with Chinese patents that are frauds.Therefore you cannot say
Chinese patents are proof that a company is not a fraud. 


 
My poin t is incredibly obvious and simple to understand. It is a mystery to me, and no doubt a mystery to
other readers, why you have difficulty in understanding this if you are as qualified and as experienced as you
say you are.

instant credibility. The last Chinese company he took a stake in (ADY) rose from $3.60 to $9.30 in two weeks. Now
going private at $7.40


I bought shares today at $4.54 upon finding out about Alfred's entry into CLNT.
