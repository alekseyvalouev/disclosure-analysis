Last week, we issued a report (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/) that presented


extensive evidence of a litany of material false statements made by Nikola’s Founder and


Executive Chairman, Trevor Milton.


We included 53 questions at the end of our report that we believe shareholders deserve


answers to. The company promised a full point-by-point rebuttal, but then only responded


(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nikola-sets-the-record-straight-on-false-and-


misleading-short-seller-report-301129952.html) to 10 of our questions.


Of those 10 responses, the company debunked nothing. Instead it either con�rmed or


sidestepped virtually everything we wrote about, and in some cases raised new unanswered


questions.


Nikola Failed to Address 43 of our 53 Questions. Of Those It
Touched On, It Largely Con�rmed Our Findings or Raised
New Questions


We View Nikola’s Response As a Tacit
Admission of Securities Fraud

Nikola Admitted That Its Deceptive “Nikola One in Motion”
Video Was, In Fact, Video of The Semi-Truck Simply Rolling
Down A Hill.


The Company Says It Never Claimed the Truck Was
Powering Itself, Despite Deceptive Editing and Claims That
it Had “1,000 HP” With “Sports Performance”


In our report, we explained how the company released a video


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8&feature=youtu.be) called “Nikola One in


Motion”, which made it seem that its Nikola One semi-truck was traveling under its own power


at a high rate of speed. Angles in the video were edited to make it appear as though the semi


was moving on a roadway that was �at, or even uphill.


In Monday’s response, the company acknowledged that its vehicle was not functioning under


its own power, and instead, was apparently simply showcasing the power of gravity. It claimed


that using the term “in motion” dispelled the deceptive nature of the video.


We disagree. Beyond common sense, the company referred to the Nikola One as “the 1,000


HP, zero-emission Nikola One semi-truck” in the description of its video. Obviously, the truck


can’t have 1,000 horsepower or even 1 horsepower if it doesn’t power itself.


On January 25, 2018, Nikola posted the same video (https://www.facebook.com/watch/?


v=2039262762955714) to its corporate Facebook page.


Underneath the video are a series of comments that were answered by Nikola’s veri�ed


corporate Facebook account.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8&feature=youtu.be

https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2039262762955714
In response to inquiries about the video, the company con�rmed the Nikola One had “over


1,000 HP” and “over 2,000 ft. lbs. of torque” and can handle a “7% grade, no problem”. Readers


would have likely interpreted this as an ability to climb up a 7% grade hill, not roll down a very


steep hill.


The company also told one person: “…wait until you drive it. Feels like a luxury car with


sports performance.”


Given the public statements Nikola was making at the time, we view the company’s new


admission that the Nikola One was not powered on its own in the video as a tacit admission of


securities fraud.


Nikola Claims the Nikola One Semi Was Not A “Pusher”
Because It Was Designed To Move Under Its Own Power
Train. It Then Admits the Truck Didn’t Ever Move Using Its
Own Power Train.


Reminder: Nikola and Trevor Referred to The Nikola One
As “Fully Functional”, “Fully Built”, “A Real Truck” And
“Not A Pusher” At Least 6 Times Between October 2016 and
December 2016
As we wrote, in December 2016, the company falsely claimed at Nikola World, on video


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbXqiSYDhrA&t=34s), that the Nikola One “fully functions


and works…this is a real truck—this is not a pusher.” It later admitted


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-


capability-of-his-debut-truck) that it was NOT fully functional to Bloomberg.


Nikola’s response yesterday completely failed to address Trevor’s false statements claiming


that the truck “fully functions and works”.


Instead, the heavily-lawyered language clumsily attempted to rede�ne the term “pusher”,


suggesting that because Nikola hoped its non-functional vehicle would work someday, that it


therefore wasn’t a pusher at the time.


We appreciate that Nikola’s new law �rm, Kirkland & Ellis, tried to do their best with what they


had to work with. However, Trevor later helpfully de�ned the term “pusher” on video


(https://youtu.be/4-J7H_XmmWg?t=32) while emphatically denying that the truck �t his own


de�nition:


“This isn’t just a pusher like a lot of vehicles that they unveil [that] are just


vehicles that don’t actually function. This is a fully functioning vehicle which is


really incredible.”


With that de�nition in mind, we o�er a reminder that Nikola and Trevor reassured investors


that the Nikola One semi worked at least 6 times:


Nikola called (https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/787831262727680000?s=20) the


truck “functioning” and “fully built” on Twitter on October 16, 2016.


At the December 1, 2016 launch event, Trevor says (https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?


t=1050): “This thing fully functions and works, which is really incredible.”


He also said “We will have a chain on the seats to prevent people from coming and just


for the safety. I don’t want someone to end up doing something and driving this truck o�


the stage.”


Later at the same event, he insisted (https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=wLidTCqAAtY&feature=youtu.be&t=2343) 3 times that the truck was real, stating “know


it’s real”, “you’re going to see this is a real truck” and “this is not a pusher”.


Trevor again (https://youtu.be/4-J7H_XmmWg?t=32) said, in a video dated December 2,


2016: “this isn’t just a pusher” and “this is a fully functioning vehicle”



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbXqiSYDhrA&t=34s

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-capability-of-his-debut-truck

https://youtu.be/4-J7H_XmmWg?t=32
Given Nikola’s admission that the truck seen in the video was not fully functioning, the above


were all clearly statements that misled investors. In other words, these were outright lies.


Our Report: Former Employees Told Us No Further Work
Continued On The Nikola One A�er 2016 Even Though The
Company Was Still Publicly Claiming In 2018 That the
Nikola One Would Soon be Ready


Referring to the “Nikola One in Motion” video, a company tweet in June 2018 stated that “pre-


production units (would) hit �eets in 2019 for testing” which was false. Former employees told


us that no further work continued on the Nikola One after the 2016 demonstration.


Note that a former employee indicated to us that work on the Nikola One was abandoned


immediately after the initial reveal, in December 2016.
Yesterday, Nikola stated that “it ultimately decided not to invest additional resources into


completing the process to make the Nikola One drive on its own propulsion”, seemingly


validating our �ndings.


Nikola’s decision to ultimately halt investment is not the issue; the company’s failure to


acknowledge that it had halted investment while telling investors work continued is the


problem, and represents another clear case of making knowingly misleading statements.


Our Report: Nikola And Trevor Hyped A Letter of Intent to
Acquire Battery Technology Company ZapGo. The Tech
Turned Out To Be Vaporware. A�er Nikola Realized This,
They Continued To Hype It Anyway


Nikola’s Response: It Wasn’t ZapGo We Were Hyping. The
Game Changing Battery Tech is Part of a Secret R&D
Agreement We Can’t Provide Any Details On. Also, We Are
Using GM’s Battery Technology for Some Reason


In our report, we pointed out that Nikola had introduced the Nikola battery “prototype cell” and


called it “game changing battery technology” in November 2019. Trevor Milton also hyped it as


technology that would make “diesel trucks obsolete for good” on Twitter on November 18,


2019.


The company originally called it “game-changing” and “the biggest advancement we have seen


in the battery world.” In Nikola’s response from yesterday, however, the technology is now only


described as “potential battery technology advancements”.


Our report noted that the letter of intent (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7n7d2R3HaSss53)


with ZapGo was signed within 2 days of a tweet teasing


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1189338143926956033?s=20) the press release on the


battery technology. The press release then referenced the Letter of Intent, stating:


“Nikola entered into a letter of intent to acquire a world-class battery engineering


team.”



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7n7d2R3HaSss53

https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1189338143926956033?s=20
ZapGo was later accused by Nikola (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd) of


fraud, false representations, and failure to disclose that its President had been indicted for tax


fraud.


Nikola’s own lawsuit indicated that it was made aware of these issues on December 5, 2019,


and we noted that Trevor continued to hype the company’s battery technology into February


2020.


Nikola formally terminated the agreement


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rSzikFMNdDevxU) on February 26, 2020 and appears not to


have publicly discussed the situation since, until yesterday.


Now, Nikola has responded that Trevor’s statements regarding the company’s battery


technology were related to “an ongoing con�dential R&D partnership with a leading academic


institution”.


It goes without saying that funding academic research is not the same thing as acquiring a


team of engineers, as the original “game changing” announcement indicated.


The newly referenced academic partnership appears to have been �rst talked about in August


2020 in this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=heHZYqlLRdE&feature=youtu.be&t=3222&ab_channel=TeslaJoy) YouTube video, where


Milton says about Nikola’s battery technology: “It’s tied to a university that had developed the


technology. And we essentially ended up licensing all of it and helping them fund it all the way


through.”


We asked Nikola to provide dated agreements and documents that support that the supposed


secret partnership had been ongoing prior to the company’s mid-November 2019 press release.


We asked:


“Which university were you working with on the battery technology, how much did you


fund them with, and exactly what have you developed in conjunction with them thus


far? Will you post the agreement for all to see?”



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rSzikFMNdDevxU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heHZYqlLRdE&feature=youtu.be&t=3222&ab_channel=TeslaJoy
Instead we are met with more vague answers. The company’s response provided no details


about the con�dential R&D relationship that supposedly involves advanced battery technology,


and no indication of when it began. 


Our Report: Trevor Claimed to Have Reduced the Cost of
Hydrogen By 81% Relative To Peers And Was Producing
1,000 kg of Hydrogen Per Day At Nikola’s Headquarters


Nikola’s Response Con�rmed That None of this Happened:
“Nikola Continues to Believe that its Planned Hydrogen
Station Network…Will Provide Key Competitive
Advantages.”


At Nikola World in December 2019 Trevor claimed on video (https://youtu.be/AkS5C3Zm7mA?


t=3038) that Nikola was producing 1,000 kilograms of hydrogen a day on site at his Phoenix


headquarters:


“In America we’ve already got the largest hydrogen station in the western


hemisphere at our headquarters. Can produce over 1,000 kilograms a day on


site.”


Subsequent to Nikola World, Trevor reiterated in several public interviews that he achieved


signi�cant breakthroughs in hydrogen production.


In an August 2020 interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbrgQj4xlbk) with Fox


Business News, when asked about the company’s hydrogen, Trevor says:


“We saw an opportunity to bring the cost of hydrogen down going zero-emission and


putting it on parity with diesel, and it’s the �rst time in history that’s been able to be


done, so it went from about $16/kg and we are down now below $4/kg.


In another interview on July 17, 2020, on the TeslaCharts podcast, Trevor claimed Nikola has


been able to “chop the cost of hydrogen from $16/kg down to – we’re down below $3/kg on our


hydrogen now.”[1] (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#_ftn1) [11:34

https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-trevor-milton?play=true
Trevor’s claims followed a years-long pattern of hyping Nikola’s non-existent hydrogen


network, including this comment from 2018 in response to the Facebook video


(https://www.facebook.com/1739715679577092/videos/2039262762955714/?


__so__=channel_tab&__rv__=playlists_card) of its “Nikola One In Motion”, publicly assuring


readers that the company had 8 hydrogen stations “going up right now”:


As acknowledged by the company’s statement Monday, it has no hydrogen network, and


simply hopes to have one in the future. This once again strikes us as a tacit admission of


securities fraud.


Our Report: Trevor Milton Falsely Claimed In 2020 That
Five Nikola Tre Trucks Were “Coming O� The Assembly
Line Right Now”


Bloomberg Corroborates: The Assembly Line Isn’t
Finished


Nikola’s Response Tacks A Year and A Half Onto Trevor’s
Publicly Disclosed “Right Now” Achievement, Saying It
Doesn’t Expect the Tre Until Q4 2021


Our research highlighted statements made by Trevor in July 2020 that 5 Nikola Tre trucks were


coming o� an assembly line in Germany. We showed in our report that none of the trucks had


been completed and that the assembly line itself had not been completed.



https://www.facebook.com/1739715679577092/videos/2039262762955714/?__so__=channel_tab&__rv__=playlists_card
Bloomberg has since con�rmed our work, writing


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-12/nikola-s-history-of-discrepancies-has-


been-hiding-in-plain-sight):


“Those statements were a mischaracterization of Nikola and Iveco’s progress in


Ulm, according to two people familiar with the matter. The assembly line is still


under construction and not yet operational or building prototypes, the people


said. There are prototypes being built by hand in a workshop, one of the people said.”


On Friday, in response to our report, Trevor tweeted pictures


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1304432858937741313?s=20) of un�nished Nikola Tre


trucks in a work area that is clearly not an assembly line.


In its response on Monday morning, Nikola stated:


“�ve trucks are currently being built and commissioned in Ulm, Germany, and are pre-


production builds”


This con�rmed our original report, including comments quoted by a Bosch spokesman,


indicating the trucks were still not completed and had not rolled o� an assembly line in July.


Nikola then stated that it expects the Tre to be “ready for production and available to


customers by the fourth quarter of 2021.”


We view this, once again, as an admission that Trevor’s statement to investors in July was


patently false. Not only were completed trucks not rolling o� an assembly line, but an assembly


line hadn’t even been constructed. The trucks remain uncompleted.


Our Report: Nikola’s Order Book Is Flu�, Including A ~�3.5
Billion Order From A Company With Only �1.3 Million In
Cash


Nikola’s Response: We Have an Order From A Di�erent
Company, That We Hope To Begin Deliveries On In Three
Years



https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-12/nikola-s-history-of-discrepancies-has-been-hiding-in-plain-sight

https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1304432858937741313?s=20
In our report we pointed out that the company’s order book appeared to be �lled with �u�,


including non-committal orders and orders where potential customers like Anheuser Busch


have multiple ‘outs’.


We showed that U.S. Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations, representing


~$3.5 billion in orders, yet U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on hand last quarter.


Monday morning, the company failed to address the issue and simply reiterated that it had an


order from another company, Republic Services, that it hopes to begin deliveries on three years


from now.


We view this as an admission that the company’s order book was, in fact, �lled with �u�.


Our Report: The Company’s Unveiling of Its NZT O�-Road
Vehicle Deceptively Presented a Mock-Up As if It Was
Market-Ready. Following the “Unveiling” the Project Was
Then Outsourced for Redesign.


Nikola Responded By Re-Wording Our Statements Then
Declaring The Reworded Statements to be False


In our report, we described the ‘unveiling (https://youtu.be/2Dc8J3iSLw4?t=1435)’ of the


company’s NZT o�-road vehicle at Nikola World in 2019. At the event, Trevor described the


product as a fait accompli of its design team, saying it “rivals some of the best automotive


engineering in the world”.


We reported that the model was actually not completed, and that weeks later, Nikola scrapped


the design and quietly outsourced the redesign to a company called Stellar Strategy.


In response, Nikola reworded our statements regarding the company’s NZT o�-road vehicle in


order to claim those pretend statements were false.


Nikola inaccurately stated that we claimed the NZT “program” was scrapped after the Nikola


World 2019 event. In fact, we clearly stated that the program continued, but that the design


was outsourced to a third party called Stellar Strategy LLC.



https://youtu.be/2Dc8J3iSLw4?t=1435
Nikola failed to refute our point that it presented (yet again) a non-functional “mock-up” of the


NZT at Nikola World. We believe this represents a tacit admission that it’s NZT “reveal” was a


farce.


The company also failed to mention Stellar Strategy in its rebuttal despite our speci�c question


asking about the relationship, which we believe underscores its inability to design and innovate


internally.


Our Report: Why Would Trevor Appoint His Brother As
“Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure” Given
He Had No Apparent Experience in Hydrogen Technology?


Nikola’s Response: Travis Milton Ran A Construction
Business
In our report, we noted that Trevor Milton appointed his younger brother Travis to a position


that required scienti�c expertise. We asked:


“Why did you appoint your brother (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-milton-


4b968153/) Travis as “Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure”? What


experience does he have in hydrogen research and production?”


We further asked:


“What would you say are Travis’ key contributions to Nikola’s alleged breakthrough


advancements in hydrogen production?”


The company responded on Monday by claiming that Travis is quali�ed for this high-level


scienti�c position because he previously worked in construction:


“Travis Milton previously owned and operated his own construction company


preparing him for hydrogen station infrastructure and buildouts.”


When faced with the same question, in a since-deleted Instagram rant addressing the question


(we have a copy), Trevor stated:


“Why do you give a shit? Go start your own company—hire your own employees!”


Our questions to the company concerned Travis’ contributions to Nikola’s claimed hydrogen


breakthroughs, and his experience with the signi�cant technical and scienti�c challenges of


hydrogen production, storage and delivery.  Those questions remain completely unanswered.


Our Report: Trevor Claimed On Video That Nikola’s
Inverters Were Developed In House And That OEMs Were
Asking To Use Them. In The Same Video He Is Showcasing
An Inverter Manufactured By Cascadia With Masking Tape
Covering Its Label.



https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-milton-4b968153/
Nikola’s Response: Admits This is True, Then De�ects by
Vaguely Stating That the Company Has Been “Working on
Its Own Inverters For Quite Some Time”


In our report, we pointed out that Trevor, on video (https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=1770),


claimed that Nikola made its own inverters in-house, along with all the e-axle design and other


key components.


In the same video, Trevor shows o� an inverter that we discovered is actually manufactured by


Cascadia, with a piece of masking tape on the label that concealed who really made it.


The company once again admitted the claims in our report to be true, and walked back its


claims that these inverters were Nikola’s proprietary intellectual property by vaguely stating


that it is “working on” its own inverter:


“Nikola has been designing, engineering and working on its own inverters for quite


some time.”


The company’s CEO, Mark Russell, further walked back the company’s claims to have vast


proprietary technology when pressed by reporters from the Financial Times on Friday:


“Asked about Mr. Milton’s claim to have all the ‘core’ technology for its vehicles, Mr.


Russell described the company as an ‘integrator’, stitching together the many


elements of its vehicles from a complex supply chain.”


Russell’s admission clearly corroborates our own �ndings, and directly contradicts Trevor’s


repeated claims of Nikola having vast proprietary intellectual property.


The company’s response on Monday morning declared that “at no time did Nikola state that


the inverter on the prototype truck shown in the video was the Company’s.”  But of course it


ignores the fact that there is video proof, narrated by Milton (https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=7C2LDmkEmP0&ab_channel=NikolaMotorCompany) himself:



https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=1770

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2LDmkEmP0&ab_channel=NikolaMotorCompany
“We do all the e-axle design in house. All the gears, the gear reductions. The thermal


the cooling. Even the controls that go with it. And, also, the inverters as well. All


inverters on the Nikola truck are probably some of the most advanced software


systems that I know of anywhere in the automotive world. Why do I know that?


It’s because other OEMs are asking us to use it.”


Why would OEMs be asking to use an inverter that hadn’t even been developed? Furthermore,


Trevor actually points to the supposed “in-house” inverter in question in the video:


Pictured: Trevor Milton’s �nger, while he narrates a


“Behind the Scenes” video


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=7C2LDmkEmP0&ab_channel=NikolaMotorCompany)


, pointing at a Cascadia Inverter with masking tape


over its label, about 15 minutes before proclaiming


Nikola makes all its own inverters.


Once again, the company admitted our �ndings were correct.


Now, rather than defending its previous false claims to have developed revolutionary


proprietary technology for use in its vehicles and prototypes, Nikola now vaguely claims to be


working on it.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2LDmkEmP0&ab_channel=NikolaMotorCompany
Our Report Presented Evidence That Trevor Misled
Potential Investors in a Predecessor Entity by In�ating a
�16 Million Deal with Trucking Company Swi� Into a �300
Million Deal.


Nikola Claims the Deal Could Have Been �250 Million With
Options.


Swi� Didn’t Exercise Those Options And, Instead, Sued
dHybrid Over Misrepresentations With its Original �16
Million Deal.


In our report, we pointed out one of Trevor Milton’s early business ventures, called dHybrid,


closed on a $16 million contract with Swift Transportation before being sued by Swift over


allegations of providing it with trucks that didn’t work and of misappropriating capital for


personal use.


Nikola writes o� this portion of our report by inexplicably claiming that the agreement “has no


connection with or association to Nikola.” This ignores the fact that Trevor Milton was dHybrid’s


founder, as well as Nikola’s founder, former CEO, major shareholder and current Executive


Chairman.


Nikola also points out that that Swift Transportation had options to make future purchases


from dHybrid for $250 million.


We showed a slide from an investor presentation claiming the contract to be $300 million, a


clear in�ation, by the company’s own standard:
In reality, nowhere near $250 million changed hands, however. Swift sued dHybrid after an


investment of about $2 million, alleging that the dHybrid trucks didn’t work and that o�cers of


dHybrid misappropriated capital for personal use.


Nikola Failed to Address 43 of Our 53 Questions


Their Silence on These Questions Speak Volumes


At the bottom of our original report, we o�ered Nikola 53 questions it could answer to clear the


air for investors, the market and its stakeholders alike. Instead of answering them, Nikola only


touched on 10 of them.


Despite claiming to have found “dozens” of inaccuracies with our report, Nikola’s response


essentially validated all of the issues we raised. Below are the questions Nikola did not even


attempt to address:


1. Before suddenly pivoting to fuel cells, you claimed (https://www.ccjdigital.com/electric-truck-


company-says-more-than-7000-have-been-pre-ordered/) that your Compressed Natural Gas


(CNG) technology was “10-15 years ahead of any other OEM in fuel e�ciencies, MPG, and


emissions”. Why did you suddenly abandon this supposedly revolutionary technology rather


than sell it for billions of dollars?


Nikola’s response: NONE



https://www.ccjdigital.com/electric-truck-company-says-more-than-7000-have-been-pre-ordered/
2. You claimed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9J8jizLI2s&feature=youtu.be&t=603) that


Nikola’s headquarters has 3.5 MW of solar panels on the roof, yet later media reports


(https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/06/30/see-inside-nikolas-new-75phoenix-


headquarters.html) and pictures of the roof show they don’t exist. Where did they go?


Nikola’s response: NONE


3. You claimed


(https://web.archive.org/web/20160701211732/https:/nikolamotor.com/one) Nikola owned its


own natural gas wells, then re-a�rmed


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920002309/a2241198zs-


4a.htm) that you “still have them” when later asked what happened to them. Can you provide


any documentation proving Nikola owns/owned natural gas wells?


Nikola’s response: NONE


4. In 2018 you were sued (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3QyB36jP4g9nYN) by your former


CFO. What were the allegations in the complaint, which is now sealed?


Nikola’s response: NONE


5. What OEMs have asked to use “your” inverters in their products, as Trevor claimed on video?


Nikola’s response: NONE


6. You appointed your brother (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-milton-4b968153/) Travis as


“Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure”.        What experience does he have in


hydrogen research and production?”


Nikola’s response: NONE


7. What would you say are Travis’ key contributions to Nikola’s alleged breakthrough


advancements in hydrogen production?


Nikola’s response: NONE

https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-milton-4b968153/
8. After the Bloomberg piece, you claimed on Twitter


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273350775998017536?s=20) that there was a


table with truck gears and components sitting in front of the audience for all to see. The


event was extensively documented—can you present evidence that such a table existed in


plain view for the entire audience?


Nikola’s response: NONE


9. Do you think a table with gears sitting somewhere would in any way invalidate your claims


at the time that the truck “fully functions” when it was later shown that it didn’t?


Nikola’s response: NONE


10. After lambasting Bloomberg’s reporter publicly


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273350775998017536?s=20), calling him a


“deceiver” and saying he should be �red, you then promised the full audio of the


interview with Bloomberg would be released. Why haven’t you released it yet?


Nikola’s response: NONE


11. Do you think it’s wise to threaten to sue journalists for getting a story totally correct?


Nikola’s response: NONE


12. In August 2016, you claimed (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-


achieves-zero-emissions-29) “Nikola has engineered the holy grail of the trucking


industry”, pivoting to hydrogen from natural gas. Now that you have acknowledged the


Nikola One wasn’t fully “engineered” at the time of the statement or the December show,


do you wish to retract this press release in full?


Nikola’s response: NONE


13. Did the Nikola One truck have hydrogen turbines or Brayton CNG turbines at the time of


the demonstration in December? Was the fueling system hydrogen or CNG?


Nikola’s response: NONE

https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-29
14. Why did you say just two weeks before Nikola’s sudden “pivot” to hydrogen


(https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-


29) that “CNG is the way to go” on Twitter


(https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/756692103632031744?s=20) if you were


imminently planning to announce a switch?


Nikola’s response: NONE


15. Did you have an artist come in and stencil “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric” on


the side of the Nikola One despite the truck having natural gas components installed?


Nikola’s response: NONE


16. Do you still consider the Nikola One to have been “fully functioning” despite needing to


snake an electricity cord up through the stage in order to power the otherwise completely


non-working vehicle?


Nikola’s response: NONE


17. Which Nikola employees knew about the “plan” for the Nikola One in Motion video and


which ones participated in creating it? Did those include Kevin Lynk, your Chief Engineer?


Nikola’s response: NONE


18. At the time, did you think pre-production units of the Nikola One would just magically


produce themselves?


Nikola’s response: NONE


19. According to you, Nikola designs most things in-house. Did you outsource the redesign of


the NZT to Stellar Strategy?


Nikola’s response: NONE


20. In October 2019, you teased


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1189338143926956033?s=20) a major battery


breakthrough 2 days before signing a letter of intent with ZapGo. You then announced


that you had revolutionized the battery industry, before realizing that it was vaporware

and ultimately suing the company (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd).


Why didn’t you correct the press release or update your investors on the status of the


deal, which had fallen apart?


Nikola’s response: NONE


21. In December 2019 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd), Jason Roycht,


your VP of Technology Development, realized that ZapGo’s President had been indicted


for fraud (https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/04/18/man-conned-his-nasa-


funded-lab-into-paying-trips-see-prostitutes-escorts-feds-say/). He raised alarms about


the company’s relationship with Porsche, which he determined was overstated. Why did


you hype the battery tech in February on Twitter


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1227078692095975424?s=20) despite already


knowing of all these issues?


Nikola’s response: NONE


22. You formally terminated (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rSzikFMNdDevxU) the


agreement for the apparent “game changing battery technology” from ZapGo on February


26 , 2020. It is now 6+ months later. Have you ever publicly acknowledged that this major


deal fell apart?


Nikola’s response: NONE (until yesterday, apparently.)


23. In August 2020 when speci�cally questioned about the deal


(https://youtu.be/heHZYqlLRdE?t=3222) by a Tesla fan, why didn’t you take the


opportunity to let people know that it had fallen through?


Nikola’s response: NONE


24. You claimed in an interview to have succeeded at cutting the cost of hydrogen by ~81%


from peers, stating “we’re down below $3/kg on our hydrogen now”. How much hydrogen


has Nikola produced at this price, if any?


Nikola’s response: NONE


25. At Nikola World 2019 you claimed on video (https://youtu.be/AkS5C3Zm7mA?t=3038) to


be producing 1,000 kg of hydrogen per day at your headquarters. When pressed by a


reporter, you later admitted (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-trevor-milton-

trackingId=nIXxnt4u0GFFIunPZCD9Uw%3D%3D) that you produce no hydrogen. Did you


lie about producing hydrogen on camera to the entire audience at Nikola World?


Nikola’s response: NONE


26. Why did you post a video (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283425947199221761?


s=20) saying the Nikola Two had gone from 0-60mph in under 5 seconds when anyone


with a stopwatch can see that it took at least 10 seconds?


Nikola’s response: NONE


27. Following the 0-60 video you promised


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283429144970158080?s=20) to post a


professional version of the video, saying it was just being edited. But you never did. Why?


Does the Nikola Two have as much power as you’ve claimed it has?


Nikola’s response: NONE


28. In the TeslaCharts podcast (https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-


trevor-milton) at the 40:20 minute mark you said regarding hydrogen stations: “we’re


gobbling up the best locations right now“. Yet your latest quarterly report


(https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128920000012/nkla-


20200630.htm) showed no real estate assets aside from your current headquarters.


Where exactly are these locations that you have been “gobbling up”? How many have you


purchased already?


Nikola’s response: NONE


29. What is the hold up with your Coolidge facility construction? Have plans been submitted


yet (https://www.pinalcentral.com/coolidge_examiner/news/nikola-corp-announces-

30. Why do you spend so much time on social media �ghting your “haters” and threatening


former employees with litigation over NDA enforcement? Don’t you have a factory to build


and products to produce?


Nikola’s response: NONE


31. Did you have your service personnel traverse the country to conceal potentially fatal


defects with dHybrid’s product to close the deal with Worthington, as alleged by one of your


former employees on recorded audio?


Nikola’s response: NONE


32. What was the rationale for Worthington’s later impairment


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/108516/000119312515271107/d943911d10k.h

(https://s24.q4cdn.com/947644764/�les/transcript/2016-Q3-WOR-Transcript.pdf)?


Nikola’s response: NONE


33. In May 2015, you represented in a legally binding contract


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CPnFrrz696Ia4W) with EVdrive to have “new and


valuable proprietary turbine technology”. Months later, emails showed you were in


discussions with Brayton to purchase their turbines. Did you have any “new and valuable


turbine technology” at the time you represented having it?


Nikola’s response: NONE


34. If so, what was it, and why did you then need to buy turbine technology from Brayton?


Nikola’s response: NONE


35. When you sold your St. George Security & Alarms company in an $300,000 deal, your


business partner, who said he had a 50/50 deal with you, only received ~$100,000,


according to him. Did you get more than him despite having a 50/50 arrangement?

36. The buyer of the alarm business said you misled him and that customer contracts and


other deals fell through post-sale. What happened?


Nikola’s response: NONE


37. How much did you make when you sold the alarm business a second time? How much of


those proceeds did your apparent “50/50” business partner receive?


Nikola’s response: NONE


38. You claimed (https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenli1/2020/05/18/nikola-motor-company-


trevor-milton-2020/#de8228490f63) that uPillar.com had 80 million monthly active users


and that you had beat Amazon (https://youtu.be/oaP0SL3-WKM?t=110) to the shopping


cart, despite launching in 2009. A former employee called the 80 million number “absurd”,


and media articles at the time describe the page views far lower. What evidence can you


show that you had that number of page views?


Nikola’s response: NONE


39. Do you realize the internet shopping cart was invented 15 years earlier, in 1994

Nikola’s response: NONE


40. Swift �led a lawsuit against your company dHybrid in mid-2012


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3J5amtkGnucK6c), alleging, among other things, that


you had used its investment for personal use. Can you produce bank records showing


how you used dHybrid funds? Did you divert funds to uPillar.com?


Nikola’s response: NONE


41. Did you claim to sPower that you had �nished the dHybrid system and then misrepresent


its results to them, as alleged in their lawsuit

Yeah. I was thinking the same thing when I saw Elon’s Falcon Heavy booster rockets (he is the


chief engineer at SpaceX) landing on the pad at Kennedy Space Center in 2018. I think that


every time the booster rockets land on a barge in the middle of the ocean. I think that every


time I drive my Tesla to the store. I was thinking that when I watched the crew Dragon bring


Bob and Doug to the ISS, and then bring them home safely. I think that every time my car gets


an update to the latest and greatest features while it is sitting in my driveway. I think that every


time I look at my Tesla phone app to see where my husband is with my car. I think that when I


no longer have to go to the gas station but can pop into a Supercharger for 20 minutes and get


175 miles of range. I think that when I watch Sandy Monroe talk about the amazing engineering


and improvements on my Tesla. I think that as I read about the battery installation in Australia


saving hundreds of millions of dollars. I think that all the time…..What a fraud.

I can’t say I know, but from the digging I’ve been doing it de�nitely sounds like a woman. Some


sex scandal, probably cheated on his wife or something. Probably materially irrelevant to his


continued business, just devastating personally


Again, I don’t know, I’m just usually pretty good at sni�ng out bull****


sacrecoeur says:


September 19, 2020 at 10:15 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/#comment-39044)


@D.C. + @A Vieira – Please stop pushing conspiracy theories, and concentrate on real


arguments presented in this forum instead. Robb was a mentally disturbed young man who


resorted to extortion, was reported to Feds by Milton, and later committed suicide. Neither


police, nor Robb’s family, raised any questions regarding possible foul play. Milton’s 2013


tweets related to Las Vegas sex escapades, which probably served as the base for extortion,


only prove that he is an immoral, narcissistic sleazebag. The rest is not up to us to speculate.

If it is true then the odd stu� is that he blames others, shows no remorse, may have made


strange sexual suggestions to someone who was a candidate invitee to his birthday party with


Epstein implications. ‘Solving The Money Problem’ then linked the scandal to a clip of Trevor


Milton describing the level of loyalty that he would want. Check the YouTube site to draw your


own conclusions.

Hilarious. They could not address a single point raised by Hindenburg, so they had to resort to


debunking Facebook comments? Milton’s so-called o�cial response was the exercise in


semantics.

Ex-Oligarch says:

The reddit link you cite does not “fact check” or even address the points in the Hindenburg


report, except to con�rm that Trevor Milton’s brother has no hydrogen expertise, that the


company is not developing many of its own components as proprietary technology, and of


course that the Nikola One ad was fake.


What’s more, a number of the “fact checks” supporting links in the reddit article are to


statements by Milton himself. Hindenburg is alleging that Milton’s statements were fraudulent.


Linking to more statements by Milton instead of veri�able data is not going to convince anyone,


and is itself misleading.

Lots of questions here. Many are good. Some are, well, more rhetorical in nature. I would like


to see this list of 43 reduced to the 10x most important and damning ones.


IMO, “Why do you spend so much time on social media �ghting your “haters” and threatening


former employees with litigation over NDA enforcement? Don’t you have a factory to build and


products to produce?” is not a real question. If I had nothing to hide, I would ignore this


question. Questions should be content based and speci�c.


“At the time, did you think pre-production units of the Nikola One would just magically produce


themselves?” That’s literally not even a question. It’s rhetorical. Don’t ask rhetorical questions.


“Do you think it’s wise to threaten to sue journalists for getting a story totally correct?” Also not


a real question.


Again, boil this down to a top 10. Great work though. I hope investors understand what is

Beautiful… I believe you have enough info for part 2.


You should go into the new Nikola factory “Groundbreaking debacle”. Where they had a huge


media event and said they were breaking ground “today”. When the City of Coolidge, AZ didn’t


even approve thier permits yet. In fact they haven’t even applied for permits yet. When called


out on the lack of progress by several independendent journalists, they sent one or 2 dozers


out to push dirt around for 2 weeks. To give the illusion of progress.

What about the jet-ski video. It is sure made to look as if they have a jet-ski, they trailer it to the


water, put a women with life-jacket on it like she is getting ready to ride. The later they show it


lighting up and peacefully sitting near their campsite. How did it get to the campsite? In the


campsite section of the video, it looks like an electric cord in the sand to power the lights.


Bottom line, is this another pusher, hill roller, that they what ‘paddled’ to the camp? Certainly


the impression is a teaser of a running jet-ski.

This Hindenburg “report” is a complete farce. Hindenburg is continuing to push the narrative


that the truck was rolled down a hill in promotional video, while simultaneously ignoring the


fact that newer versions of the truck have been seen on camera driving under their own power.


Their argument is completely irrelevant and based on a distortion of reality. Their argument’s


fundamental premise is that Nikola has lied in the past, therefore the present isn’t real.


However, that isn’t the case. The trucks do power themselves and they are powered. Why is



https://leprent.com/2020/09/15/electric-truck-maker-nikolas-shares-fall-as-sec-reportedly-examines-short-sellers-fraud-claims/
that not presented in Hindenburg’s report? Omission of facts is a distortion of truth


Hindenburg.


Because Hindenburg refuses to be honest about these simple facts, I �nd it very di�cult to


believe the remaining portions of their argument. It’s a shame what short sellers are trying to


do to a company that is only trying to advance technology and improve our world. Hindenburg


should be ashamed of their actions. In the end, Nikola will remain.

You should actually read the report. Miltons own employees said they haven’t built any new


trucks since 2016.

@Austin Lange – are you kidding me??? Yesterday was the past – does that mean if Trevor


Milton lied yesterday you give him a free pass? That fact is the “Present” isn’t real if it is all built


on lies! And how do YOU know that the trucks are powered? Have you been to their


headquarters in Arizona or to Olm, Germany to view the trucks under power? I doubt it. Trevor


put out a fake video about their truck “in motion” and ADMITTED that it was not powered.


Trevor even sent a picture of partially built trucks in Olm – NOT fully built trucks under “power”.


Your response to Hindenburg is short-sighted at best and utterly moronic at worse.

Okay Austiin, perhaps you can explain the 3.5megawatts of solar panels? The ‘green’ hydrogen


they say they have been producing for sometime. The battery tech they own that is 2x as good


as Teslas and is going to disrupt diesel trucks and the battery industry? And on and on and on.



http://cnbc.com/
Really, show me one press video, interview, youtube, twitter with Trevor that doesn’t contain


lies.


That is a big problem when you are promoting a company that is raising money, going IPO (well


reverse merger). Battery tech alone would be worth billions, after all Trevor said Nikola is NOT


a Truck company they are an Energy Company that happens to make trucks.

As in Jim Chanos’ July interview with the London Financial Times ‘ We are in the golden age of


fraud’ see https://www.ft.com/content/ccb46309-bba4-4fb7-b3fa-ecb17ea0e9cf


(https://www.ft.com/content/ccb46309-bba4-4fb7-b3fa-ecb17ea0e9cf)). Chanos maintains his


short position on Tesla.


Hindenburg should be congratulated in exposing another corporate ‘con job’ hiding in plain


sight.


Whether the SEC will do anything about Nikola remains to be seen as Harry Markopolos had to


wait 8 years before Bernie Mado� was �nally exposed – despite years of warnings from Harry


to the SEC (starting in 2000 until Mado� was �nally arrested in 2008), when, as Warren Bu�et


noted about the e�ects of the 2008 credit crunch, ‘Only when the tide goes out do you discover


who’s been swimming naked’.


Meantime, please keep up the great work Hindenburg!

i broke this open by asking NKLA on IG and Trev on Twitter if they had permits both in advance


of groundbreaking ceremony and on same day and they avoided that question but did state


construction was begining that day 07/23.

I know Trevor. If he says he has 400 employees don’t believe it. In his mind there is a very gray


region between truth and lie. There are very good reasons he’s being investigated.


He can continue to blame others for exposing his lies but it doesn’t change his unscrupulous


past. He’s the one that put his employees in a precarious position. The truth hurts.

Did you forward this article to GM?


I am curious if you have asked GM, if during their due diligence, they came across the


multitude of fraudulent statements as you have. How could they have missed such easily


obtainable information, and in light of this information, do they plan on continuing a business


relationship with such a fraudster. I know it must be pretty embarrassing for such a Company


as GM to admit they were duped.


Thanks for such great research

Trevor is nothing but a great salesman, with the gift of gab!! This guy is obviously a pathological


liar, who has lied so much he actually believes his own bullshit!! I’ve seen most of his interviews


on CNBC and he’s very convincing which is scary. I think he wants to believe everything he says,


but he has a false reality with the truth.

Did Nikola have permits to roll a prototype vehicle down a public road? Did they violate any


tra�c laws in doing so, or endanger the �lm crew and ‘driver’ violating OSHA rules.

In 2014 Walmart debuts futuristic semi. Collaboration with Peterbilt. Elizabeth Freitham was


the Senior Director of supply chain sustainability for Walmart. Heavily involved in alternative


fuels and trucking. In 2016 she was one of �eet owner magazines outstanding women in


trucking.


Today Ms Freitham is the head of business development for Nikola Motor.


The Nikola semi bears an uncanny resemblance to the Walmart Prototype.


Coincidence I’m sure.

Any institutional investor who invested in NKLA should be sued by their clients.


Even a mediocre amount of due diligence would show that Nikola is smoke and mirrors; no


products, no IP, no experienced sta�, No customers, no deliveries, etc.


The Director of hydrogen infrastructure development for Nikola is Trevor’s brother…who has


experience as a residential contractor.


Any fund who invested other people’s money in NKLA, a company whose hydrogen director has


that background, should have their pants sued o� by their clients.

ZapGo in the UK has a 20,000 sq ft o�ce with ‘no people’ in it near Harwell (actually there are


at least two people in the o�ce).


At Christmas drinks the wall displays showed industrial power tools but no vehicles. Their


carbon nanotube super caps are not suitable for long range trucks. Vaguely possible that they


might be useful for shortrange city robotaxis needing very fast charge times.


Your ZapGo may be some remote o�ce.

been a game changer in the truck manufacturing and the trucking industry. I have invested


over $2500.00 in the stock based on what Nikola has presented to be true about the truck. If


this is true, then we need to do a class action lawsuit to recover the money we invested

time so you could make lots of money. What you have done to the shareholders that


purchased shared last Thursday is somewhat a con job (hindenburg). Your company has also


taken advantage of unprofessional investors even if what you did is legal. I believe SEC should


ban you and other professional short sellers from pro�ting from these circumstances involving


investors that are the ones losing their money. Not all investors are rich.

If Nikola is for real, you could have held on to your shares as it someday will go higher than


what you purchased at. If Nikola is a fraud, you could have lost it all when the stock crash to


zero irrespective of Hindenburg’s involvement. You sold in the middle, which means you


believe it is a fraud, so you made money by not holding until the stock hits zero. What does the


timing of Hindenbergy’s release have to do with any of this? If you were only holding to eek out


a bit of gains from the GM announcement and then sell for a pro�t then you were speculating,


not investing. Speculators have no moral high ground to point the �nger at a short seller.


Whether you are rich or not is irrelevant.

Consider this:


June 03, 2020:


– Nikola and VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. Announce Closing of Business Combination


– The combined company’s shares to continue to be listed on Nasdaq under new ticker symbol


“NKLA”


– Nikola raises more than $700 million


– Nikola adds Stephen Girsky, current CEO of VectoIQ and former Vice Chairman of General


Motors Corporation, to its Board of Directors


~September 10, 2020


– Under the deal, Nikola will pay GM up to $700 million to cover the cost of building


manufacturing capacity for Nikola’s Badger truck.


Is this all a GM’s operation to defraud investors to get some cash and maybe build


manufacturing facilities for free?

Why? Because you lost some money? Isn’t that what the market is all about? Two words. Due


diligence. You bought stock in a fraud that had been underway for years.

lol the ones losing money are the short sellers. Feel the squeeze going on the stock is not


falling like short seller s had hoped and funny thing is while you fools drive it down I buy more


shares and then lock them up so you cannot borrow them to short with. So I keep adding and


betting Hindenburg research will lose their ass in their shorting of NKLA.

Thank you for pushing on this. I have been skeptical to Nikola for over a year now, and I think


“big buzwords” have in�ated the market capitalization of the company. This is a potential


disaster in the making if statements cannot be veri�ed – a problem you now have shed some


light on. Hopefully the truth will be revealed.

Well done! Not only tacit admission but in my view, Milton’s statements if accurately


represented, and I have no reason to believe they are not, is *con�rmation* of securities fraud.


Layers of deception, videos crafted carefully to mislead, mealy mouthed responses scream


CON in progress. They certainly had your con�dence didn’t they Kate? The stock market isn’t for


amateurs madame. Hindenburg did a fair amount of due diligence before acting and had every


right to sell into a rally – they deserve every penny they took in. If Nicola does everything Trevor


claims and the stock price goes to the moon they’re on the hook to buy those shares back no


matter how high it goes, so it serves them well to become informed – you should fell lucky


they’re telling you anything! -especially before it goes to zero and you lose your entire


investment. After all the BS emanating from Milton it would be hazardous to your �nancial well


being to imagine he can pull it all together and make it happen. Nothing wrong here that a


lengthy jail term wouldn’t �x..

I am guessing that the Chief Engineer might come under tremendous pressure to assist the


prosecution. A little chat with the Authorities to point out that the Nuremburg defence never


excuses you if you help another person do bad things.


Of course there could be an innocent explanation and then you would not be too embarrassed


to talk about what was done.
If Hindenburg’s allegations are true then there is potential for enormous real-world harm to


people who may have been unwise to invest.

So Hindenbrug Research along with Citron put 2 hit job articles (actually fabricated stories


made up of lies) out but prior to doing so there is a huge amount of short shares purchased.


Yea nothing like a short selling road map to show the real intention of 2 so called research


�rms aka shorting �rms looking to manipulate a stock for their person $$ gain.


https://�ntel.io/ss/us/nkla (https://�ntel.io/ss/us/nkla) this link gives everyone an idea of what


the short sellers where up to prior to the 2 press releases. Numbers don’t lie. Prior to the


release of the �rst article from 9/8 to 9/10 article release date over 62 Million short shares were


purchased. Then prior to 9/15 second article release on 9/11 (Fri) and 9/14 & 9/15 over 65


Million short shares were purchased. so Hindenburg Research made a killing on the �rst press


release because the stock


Market Date Short Volume Total Volume Short Volume Ratio


2020-09-17 4,940,532 24,412,811 20.24

2020-09-03 2,039,785 10,455,257 19.51


and look at the volume prior to the days leading up to both articles being release compare that


to the volume over time from August 18th to Sept 17th. Notice that up until 2 days before the


�rst article release the volume of trading was at the most 13+ million shares. Then take a look



https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/nikola-NKLA/historical/more-historical-data

https://fintel.io/ss/us/nkla
at Sept 8th through 16th having higher than normal volumes. You want to still claim there was


no intentional manipulataion of NKLA stock taking place. Again Numbers do not lie. Here is a


link to the Jun 22nd to Sep 17th data.


You look at that data and tell me you don’t see a pattern from Sept 8th to Sept 14th you cannot


see a huge spike in the volume compared to June, July and August trading. The volume goes


way out of proportion on the 2 days leading up to the �rst fake article released and again 2


days before the Hindenburg Research response to Nikola’s (NKLA) response. Yea no


manipulation to short a stock for monetary gain not taking place here LOL. This is a damn road


map showing that Hindenburg Research and short sellers knew what was about to be released


so they started borrowing shares to short the hell out of them 2 days prior to the start of the


NKLA stock manipulation articles and that is exactly what took place. Funny thing is the 9/11


and 9/14 purchase in anticipation of the 9/15 article causing even more stock decline back �red


the stock never dropped on 9/15 or there after so shorts sellers were left losing money on over


65 Million shares they shorted on 9/11 & 9/14. Got to love the fact that NKLA investors caught


on the Hindenburg Research attempt to manipulate the stock and did not buy Hindenburg


Research second article. Oh and it also brought out the Ambulance chasing Law �rms that want


to represent share holders who lost over $100,000 or $200,000 in value of their NKLA stock and


that would mean they won’t represent the little guy.. they will represent mainly the Short


Sellers who lost their ass on the second article attempt to manipulate this stock. As for me I


bought my shares at $12.03 and I have not lost money I am still green and plan to hold all my


shares and add more while this �asco of a failed Stock manipulation goes on.

@RedwingII…Keep holding those shares Ahab and your “White Whale” will lose you your

CARES (except you). Hindenburg (the Short Seller) was been completely honest about what they


do. If Nikola and your boy, Trevor Milton, weren’t complete liars, then your investment would


be increasing! But now the buzzards are circulating the soon-to-be dead carcass of Nikola.

If Hindenburg make an honest pro�t from shorting a fraud then they contribute to an honest


e�cient market. And in this case less harm would have arisen if this had happened earlier.

they weren’t pro�ting from the article. They are SHORT SELLERS who do research on

squeeze short-sellers vs. Milton’s fake & outsourced products, stock pumping, and securities


fraud? I am no fan of Musk or short sellers (sorry, Nathan!), yet there is a mountain of

My life is too short to waste much time on those Elon lists – a quick scan does not show


anything special or new. I have been following Andrej Karpathy and his fellow travellers closely


and I admire the technical details very much. Most of the engineers that I know hear the same


story about the distribution of possible outcomes but . The juvenile 420 comment was not an


attempt to pump the stock and that seemed pretty obvious at the time.


Similarly when he tweets ‘Aliens built the pyramids obv’.


To avoid these types of controversy he would need a large PR team. I don’t want him to do that.

The company is suspect BUT so is a short seller site that pro�ts o� writing negative stories


about growth companies.

@Lenny Sherman…..Really Lenny???? Ever hear of investigative journalism? So what if they


pro�t from their reports? They are uncovering dirty companies and their lies and they deserve


to be compensated for their work. And “growth companies”??? Nikola has been exposed as a


fraud – how is that a growth company.


I can’t tell if you’re hard headed or just plain stupid. Either way, Grow up!!

Can you give yourself an identity, please?


I can take you seriously if you don’t show up in your own website.

I don’t know Nicola nor do I know anything about investment. Uncovering wrongdoing in


companies and making the world a better place is a very laudable purpose, and Nat, you’ve


always been good at gathering information and God knows I came to appreciate you so much


for this and for many other things. It’s great that you can make money with all this and God


forbid that it ever changes but, please, really, it is hard for me to see how you have lost the


objectivity and impartiality that was so yours and, for what? Just to earn money? You cannot


alter the information at will. This is not OK. I don’t want to see you become everything that you



http://cnbc.com/
once hated so much and it hurts me that on your way you are taking advantage of so many


other people. I still respect you and want to talk about it again. I hope you read this and answer


my calls or any of my emails (A. P. dT.), Because I don’t know how to contact you. May God


bless you, may God bless yours!

J.P. Morgan’s Paul Coster : Rating Nikola stock “outperform” with a $41 price target, Coster


thinks investors should take that bite.


This year to $150 million in revenues (and still no earnings) next year to… $300 million in


revenues (and — you guessed it, no earnings) in 2021 to… suddenly jump ahead and record


$10 billion in sales and $1.6 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and


amortization (EBITDA) six years later.


In 6 years? For $41 dollars or higher??
