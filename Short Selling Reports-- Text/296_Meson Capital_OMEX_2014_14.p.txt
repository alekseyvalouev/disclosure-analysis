SSCA Inventory Unsealed: Confirms Disappointing Salvage, Meson's
Estimates
Jul. 17, 2014 3:31 PM ET111 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


SS Central America inventory matches Meson estimates posted July 10: ~5,000oz
gold total, ~70/30 ingots/coins. ONLY ~150 1oz coins found in last month of work.


Fifth Third credit line borrowing capacity should max out at $7mm unrestricted cash
now, confirms Meson estimates made July 10.


Project now appears incrementally unprofitable for further salvage, seems unlikely
Odyssey Explorer will revisit the site.


Appears OMEXs only hope of surviving August is Oceanica’s roadshow but EIA still
not filed and environmental opposition in Mexico is extremely strong due to
undisclosed overlapping fishing concessions.


The court has just unsealed the inventory of Odyssey Marine Exploration
(NASDAQ:OMEX)'s latest SS Central America inventories. Some news sources have just
recently picked up on this but are not reporting the precise numbers found in the
documents. As usual, we are bringing you transparency before the company itself, as the
results confirm a recovery well below OMEX's stated expectations of 80k+ oz of gold,
coming in at 5,000oz.


As a refresher there have been 4 salvage trips: April 15 ("2 hour dive"); May 8-13; May 19-
June 12, and the most recent June 19-July 15 (which does not yet have a status report
except what we reported July 10: only a few small containers. All of these containers
would easily fit into the trunk of a small vehicle)


The key court documents:


1) Status Report For April 15-May 15


2) Inventory Sheet for April 15-May 15


3) Status Report May 15-June 19


4) Inventory Sheet for May 15-June 19

5) Inventory Sheet for June 19-July 15 (JUST FILED TODAY: only salvaged ~200 Double
Eagles total)


Summarizing the findings


As we know from the documents, gold was $20/oz when the ship sank so the "face value"
reported in dollars can be used to calculate the total oz of gold. We also know that the
Fifth Third credit line allows borrowing $2,000/oz for double eagle coins (1oz) and ½ the
appraised value of ingots (we will conservatively also estimate these at the same value as
coins so $2,000/oz for borrowing against those). After the first $5mm borrowings, the
collateral requirements double to $1,000/oz borrowing capacity.


Note there are numerous other non-gold artifacts but the gold is all that can be borrowed
against on the credit line. Given that these artifacts will not be sold for a very long time
and the trustee does not have to worry about rapid cash burn to pay executives that
OMEX does, they will likely take their time to sell them in an orderly way to maximize
profits to the estate, perhaps over the course of 2 years, but who knows.


The point is the only source of cash for OMEX is the borrowing against these on the credit
line. We believe Fifth Third has made a grave error lending against these assets as they
are not within OMEX's control to liquidate, but that is their issue, not shareholders…


Based on the new data (in green) we can confirm our estimates posted July 10th of an
extra $2.7mm unrestricted cash availability vs May 15th on the credit line. If cash burn is
still at $3mm/month then cash should hit zero (with liabilities at $18.5mm in the first week
of August, about 2-3 weeks from today).


As you can see from the data, the total salvage per day of searching has been on a
steady decline, which makes sense as treasure is not a renewable resource. We further
believe that this latest trip was likely to be unprofitable given the initial indications that the
salvage was minimal and it is likely the Odyssey Explorer will not revisit the site as the
expenses (estimated $60k/day all in - vs $100k/day cash burn at the company overall) will
not be covered.

Oceanica is now apparently on a roadshow - last and only hope to have cash for
OMEX past August


Thanks to Green River, as usual, sharing his nonpublic information that he likely received
from OMEX, it seems Oceanica is in the middle of a roadshow to raise money.

Source: Green River Asset Comment July 9


As we previously discussed on July 8th, Oceanica still has not filed its EIA and any cash
raised will likely simply be funneled out to pay OMEX compensation at the parent
company.


In fact, we have learned quite a bit more about Oceanica as people in Mexico reach out to
us to share the chaos that is happening with the project. We will share more on this in the
near future but the project appears to be completely unraveling and has hit a wall of
environmental resistance. In fact, it appears that OMEX didn't even have the proper
permits to perform the drilling core samples!


A sample of the powerful environmental resistance in the local Mexican media (which of
course has not been disclosed by OMEX):

Author’s reply »  The only inventory that can be borrowed against are the ingots and gold coins, I went through all 60
pages of inventory to total up the value of each and it is in the first table image. They have salvaged 70k face value of
ingots in 43 gold bars, see the table. There do not appear to be any ingots salvaged in the last month's 6 pages of
inventory.

Have you contacted the company and asked them how much has been drawn on the line of credit? I don't think they
are close to maxing it out yet.


Your estimate of $60k per day for this operation is not what the company said in the conference call. They said it
would cost about $1 million per month and they were planning 4 to 5 months to complete things. So that sounds like
only $4 to $5 million in costs.


The 1450 double eagle gold coins could average out to about $9000 per coin so that is $13 million dollars. The 9000
dimes may be worth a million, the other gold up to $6 million or more. That is $20 million right there so far.


$20 million recovered and they have probably spent $3 million so far with a few months left. Yes most of the projected
gold is still down there but I doubt they stop operations now.


As of today it already looks profitable.

Guys,


I have done a preliminary look at the inventory sheets just up to 15 June and I can tell you there are alot of
numismatically rare coins, bars, private mint coins, etc that far exceed gold value or even small multiples of gold
value. I'm going to work on the value of the inventory sheets which only show what they brought up in may and thru
15 June. As long Omex and Jame point out, they have brought up much more in the last month, but will not be able to
value that until we see the inventories. I'll post the rarer coin/bar highlights after I finish my valuation. The conservator
letter says he values the inventory as of 15 June at $25M. I believe he is being very conservative. And it also appears
that there was much more after 15 June. I'll let everyone know soon.

I noticed they have recovered 30 of my favorite coin, the $3 gold piece. The Red Book shows they began
minting them in 1855 in San Fran. The 1855-S is valued at $95,000 in MS-63 condition. The 1856-S goes for
$32,500, and the 1857-S for $75,000 at this grade. Say ten of each date and it's $2 mil right there.


 
They only minted dimes in SF one year before the sinking. An 1856-S dime is valued at $15,000 each in MS-
63, and 9000 dimes have been recovered!!! If all are 1856-S, the calculator says $135 mil !!! Of course, this
may flood the market and lower prices, as only 70,000 were minted.


 
I don't think borrowing money will be an OMEX problem.

I am hopeful that all that read this know that even you know the metric of recovery oz per day is nonsense. When one
first arrives at a recovery site the first and easiest thing to do is pick up everything laying on the surface. Hence, if
there are items just sitting there exposed they are retrieved. After that the long process of removing the sand and
ocean floor matter that has buried the boat to gain access to the hull where presumably more cargo will reside. High
value items like the pursers safe for example. So anyone that did not expect the rate of recovery to slow has no idea
about the process. But I suspect you know this and are merely working your spin.


You also well know that a company road show is not material non public knowledge so it is truly poor form to attempt
to label Green River as acting in any sort of out of bounds manner when he mentioned that Oceanica was on a road
show. You yourself disclosed the road show efforts or Neptune but I am fairly certain you did not get that from OMEX
or Neptune so perhaps you should not speculate where GR got his information. That is nothing more than a cheap
shot.

CAVEAT LECTOR


This write-up and conclusion is ridiculous. Is there no management of the quality of articles posted here??


There's a sworn statement to the court that what was recovered by June 12th had a value of at least $25 million (and
that would have been conservative). There is more that has been brought up since then, including many very rare
coins, and information that items have only been salvaged from 15% of the boat (the stern area).


Clearly a fortune has been recovered already and there is obviously a lot left to be recovered.


This author previously claimed OMEX would be bankrupt on July 16th, which didn't happen. Now the facts of the
recovery are ignored, more unsubstantiated claims made (such as "it is likely the Odyssey Explorer will not revisit the

Go to ebay and search for SS Central America $20 double eagles. You can see what the retail cost per coin currently
is. Quality of the coin matters of course. The receiver wants to liquidate the recovered coins as soon as possible, the
idea that they will wait is ludicrous. They don't want to risk a collapse in the gold or coin market. Coin dealers need
quality inventory and the recovered treasure will be sold very quickly.

If Meson is so sure that OMEX will go bankrupt, then what is the purpose of this PR campaign? Take your position
and let the market work itself out. Purposefully distorting the truth by publishing these "op-eds" and setting up a
website to dominate the available news about OMEX is not responsible or ethical. Meson should let the market
determine the outcome of their short position on OMEX instead of trying to distort the market with these half-truths.
Seeking Alpha should not provide Meson with a soapbox to stand on and spew misinformation for the purpose of
distorting OMEX valuation.

But there is one thing that I want to make everyone aware of regarding Meson's insistence that Odyssey Marine will
run out of money soon.


There is an oft used practice between salvage companies and dealers who buy the salvaged products called "pre-
monetization". Essentially what this is, is that a dealer will go to the salvor and provide money (with terms) so that
when the salvor brings up the material from the salvage site (however long that takes), the dealer has already pre-
paid for the salvaged items he wants. Though OMEX management has other options to raise capital, this is another
option which I believe has happened, based on discussions with some significant players in the coin dealer and
collector community. Meson's argument here is primarily that the CA recovery does not matter, because OMEX will
run out of money and have no way to complete the salvage and/or wait to take possession of their assets for
monetization. Based on dealers high desire to be first in line to buy the new CA gold collectibles which they already
have buyers for, I feel confident that OMEX now has more cash to keep them solvent and working. Of course,
everyday that goes by without the drum beaten bankruptcy filing, only adds more credibility to OMEX's ability to
continue as a going concern.


Now that we can put that behind us, I will be posting the important information about the real numismatic value of the
current CA inventory, soon. It's a rather large job, but hope to have it done later today.


18 Jul 2014, 11:48 AM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  How would they be able to get a 'pre-monetization' when: 
1) They do not control the inventory, the receiver does and  
2) The assets are already fully borrowed against and proceeds pledged first to pay down the Fifth Third loan?


18 Jul 2014, 02:32 PM


Rory Duncan
1) How do you know that the receiver isn't interested in a rapid monetization? Doesn't the Receiver have
multiple parties who are anxious to get paid? Aren't the markets for SS CA gold already established to
facilitate rapid monetization? Why do you think it would take multiple years for monetization when SS CA gold
has been monetized very rapidly in the past?


2) Can you provide accurate data to back up your contention that "assets are already fully borrowed against"?
Do you think that the wholesale value of the salvage might vary from the bank's conservative value
allowance? Most analysts believe the salvage value currently stands at over $30mn and that OMEX is due
$18mn+ of that value. Are you implying that they've already borrowed $18mn? If so, does that alter your
projection of bankruptcy at last Wednesday?

Ryan, you so aggressively ask for answers to questions from OMEX management (without actually calling
them to ask those questions) but then won't answer questions from those who read your articles. This
behavior seems somewhat hypocritical to your readers.


Above you noted that "As usual, we are bringing you transparency before the company itself, as the results
confirm a recovery well below OMEX's stated expectations of 80k+ oz of gold, coming in at 5,000oz." Are you
able to provide a reference to the statement OMEX made about expecting 80k oz of gold? If not, what does
this say about your self-righteous claim to transparency?


"The point is the only source of cash for OMEX is the borrowing against these on the credit line." Are you
certain of this? Or could another arrangement be made that would be collateralized by the same but behind
the bank claim? Is it not possible that with a secure claim to approximately $18-$20mn in value, OMEX might
find an alternate method of monetizing this value beyond what the bank is offering?


"As you can see from the data, the total salvage per day of searching has been on a steady decline, which
makes sense as treasure is not a renewable resource." Your statement implies a level of knowledge superior
to that of Ira Kane, Bob Evans, and OMEX with respect to the remaining treasure amongst the wreckage of
the SS CA. Where do you come by this superior knowledge? In your deep sea salvage experience have you
always found the bulk of the treasure up front? Has there never been a case where you've done methodical
clean-up work before finding additional salvage items?


You've characterized OMEX's salvage as "disappointing" in your title. Yet your stated expectations for the
salvage indicated, at best, "a very small amount of random passenger coinage or gold dust." Most sources
estimate the current value of salvage to be $30-$35mn. It seems somewhat far-fetched for an analyst who
was expecting a "very small" salvage to characterize a $30-$35mn salvage (with the possibility of more) as
disappointing at any stage of that salvage mission, doesn't it?


Can you provide proof that Oceanica was not permitted to extract core samples from their license? The article
that you've cited doesn't seem to indicate this. In fact, the article says "Federal Attorney for Environmental
Protection (Profepa) found no traces or evidence that, on the coast opposite the town of Comondú , Oceanic
Explorations, S. de RL de CV, undertake activities marine mining."


Readers deserve answers, Ryan!

I will choose my words very carefully, as my posts seem to be deleted by the administrator. Every time.


This author, Ryan Morris, has predicted the demise of OMEX at least 2wice, working from memory only, I think 3rice.
The most recent was from last week wherein he predicted "Mandatory bankruptcy...by July 16." That did not happen.
He has not responded to many requests which were conveniently deleted by the moderator.

This is funny, I am "under moderation" so my last 2 posts haven't appeared here, my previous 2 were removed by the
moderator. Mr Morris' items remain. If you are following OMEX you know there are issues with Mr Morris. That person
appears to invent "facts" as needed, relies on sources who are always nameless and anonymous, thereby being
unverifiable, and contrary to the news.


I didn't predict bankruptcy. Mr Morris did. Twice for sure and I think 3 times. He said, (must I find it for you?)
"mandatory bankruptcy July 16...".


Every time I try to call him on it my posts are removed. That speaks volumes for "Seeking Alpha". Now, I've not name
called here, or anything close. Let's see how long THIS POST lasts. I disagree with Mr Morris. Is that cause to
remove my posts?

All,


I've completed my own independent valuation of the currently available SSCA inventory. I encourage you to read my
entire post, because there are many, many caveats and personally imposed restrictions on my evaluation that will
affect the final valuation. I placed these restrictions to make my evaluation as conservative as possible.


Top line summary:


The Odyssey Marine expert gave his opinion of the estimated value of the May-June 15th inventory valued at $25M
dollars. My evaluation was very close to his. My estimate is $24M dollars. But both of our estimates seems to have
been made with similarly imposed restrictions. That is the only way that both he and I would come up with an almost

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320975-ssca-inventory-unsealed-confirms-disappointing-salvage-mesons-estimates 14/37


exact evaluation. My real numismatic value estimate for the current SSCA inventory is between $35M - $37M dollars.
To understand the significant difference, I will explain the restrictions that I imposed on the valuation, and how it
causes the $24M-$25M valuation to be artificially low.


Restrictions:


It is a given that you must place certain restrictions on yourself and your evaluation if you cannot physically examine
the items. Obviously, I can't, and even Odysseys expert (who can examine them) would have been hampered in his
evaluation because final grading of silver and gold coins can only be done after they have been conserved. So here
are the caveats and restrictions:


1. I assumed only coins dated 1856 and 1857 would be in Uncirculated grades. For valuation purposes, I always
assumed the uncirculated mint state grade would be the lowest at MS60, hence resulting in an extremely
conservative valuation since some percentage of the uncirculated coins will grade higher, perhaps as high as MS65 or
MS66. From MS63 to MS66, valuations tend to double, triple or quadruple depending on the coin type and
denomination.


2. For coins dated 1850 -1855, I assumed a circulated grade Almost Uncirculated (NYSE:AU). For Coins dated before
1850, I assumed a circulated grade of very fine or extra fine (VF-XF).


3. I did not assign any value to the silver coins because silver is affected by seawater. A milky haze forms on the
surface of the coin and cannot be removed through conservation. However, these coins do have value, and some of
the dates that were specified are quite rare. Some examples-----there are multiples of 1857-S and 1856-S Half
Dollars. There were multiples of 1856-S and 1855-S Quarters. All of these coins have extremely low mintages and if
they were not seawater damaged would be worth $5K - $20K dollars each. There were also almost 6000 dimes dating
from the 1840's and 1850's. I assigned no value to any of the silver because of the seawater damage. However,
OMEX has marketed similar coins from the SS Republic as "shipwreck affect" coins and sold them for $500 - $1000
each. So they have value, but not reflected in my valuation.


4. I assigned no value to the foreign coins, jewelry, ceramics, personal items, or anything else that was not a gold coin
or gold assay bar, or other gold private mint items. These have value but are not reflected in my 24M valuation.


5. The detailed inventory showed (to the numismatically trained eye) that there were many rare coins and coins which
do not come on the market often. These included coins such as $3 gold princesses, $2 1/2 and $5 dollar gold coins
minted at Charlotte and Dahlonega (C and D mint marks), private mint $20 dollars coins from Wass Molitor, Kellog
and Humbert, and others. There are too many rare dates and items to mention here, but a few examples are-----
several 1857-S $3 gold princesses. These would probably be uncirculated and this is an exceedingly rare coin.
Depending on mint state grade these could auction from anywhere between $80K - $250K each. $20 dollar California
private mint coins are also very rare. Many of these can command $25k - $80K dollars each or more. C and D mint
gold coins depending on rarity and condition can also command $20K -$50K dollars each. All of these coins and
others I chose to assign values in ranges between $4000 to $10,000 dollars each. There is little doubt that they (and
the many other rarities not mentioned here) could be worth 10 times the values I assigned.


6. There were about 50 private mint assay bars from K&H, Justh & Hunter and Hy. Hentsch in varying sizes from 13
oz bars to 319 oz bars. These are all very rare and sought after by dealers and numismatists. I assigned a token
value of 2 times spot gold value to these bars. It is more realistic that many of them will sell at auction or to private
collectors for between 4X to 15X spot gold value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320975-ssca-inventory-unsealed-confirms-disappointing-salvage-mesons-estimates 15/37


7. I did not assign any provenance value to the fact that these artifacts are from the SS Central America. Undoubtedly,
some of these coins, bars, and gold nuggets will command some premium over non-provenance numismatic
collectible coins and artifacts of the same type.


8. And finally, there have been comments from the on site team members, conservator, etc, who have said that some
of the coins and rarities they believe are "finest known" examples. I have no way to know which ones or how many
they are talking about, so no additional value is reflected in my $24M estimate. However, finest know examples,
especially of rare coins and numismatic artifacts can command extremely high prices as "condition rarites" As a
general example, you can have a common $20 gold liberty coin in MS63 that sells for $4000 dollars. The same coin
as a condition rarity in MS67 or MS68 might sell for $30,000 dollars. And if any of the coins are true rarities and they
are also finest known, prices can hike up to $250K - $500K.


So bottom like, in my opinion, the current inventory is worth $35M -$37M dollars.


Since most everyone is certain that there are still more gold and artifacts to be recovered, the Central America project
should be profitable to Odyssey Marine.


When the next inventory list comes out in July, I will provide another valuation to share with SA reader.


As a disclaimer, the valuations I have posted here are my own opinions and are not based on site-seen examination
of the actual coins and artifacts. The actual valuation could be higher or lower than my opinion of $35M-$37M dollars
due to information I have provided in my valuation restrictions cited above.


And to re-iterate from my earlier comments, It is my opinion that OMEX has worked out arrangements to acquire cash
to continue their recovery efforts, unfortunately, I cannot answer Mr. Morris's questions about what those
arrangements might be because I am not privy to that information from OMEX management, nor are any other
investors. Their cash on hand will be reported in their SEC filing in August, and we will find out then, what type of
arrangements they have made, how much they have been able to borrow on their 5th/3rd credit facility, and any other
sources.

Thanks so much for your work, Ship!


One question. When you speak of value are you referring to what coin dealers would pay or what the retail
public would pay?


As an aside, according to an cnbc news snippet awhile back coins were second among collectable categories
in 2013 value appreciation at 8% (rare cars first that year).

I looked thru the inventory reports and any coin collector would be like a kid in a candy store if he could see these
coins first hand. I count about 960 of the $20 Double Eagles, most dated 1957, and virtually all with an "S" mint mark.
The Red Book shows coins in MS-63 condition dated 1855-S, 1856-S and 1857-S being worth $21,500, $16750, and
$9000 respectively. There is a note saying a 1857-S in MS-67 condition sold for $138,000 in 2012. These recovered
1857-S coins have to be in great condition simply because they were in circulation for such a short period, or maybe
not at all. But I will defer to Ship for more accurate estimates.


Why would anyone ship 9000 dimes from SF to NYC? The logical answer is that they were minted in SF, and not
needed in that area. MS-63 dimes of that date/mark are valued at $9000. If these are uncirculated and a better grade,
who knows the price?


A mystery is why anyone would ship Chilean coins to NYC?


This news will be in all the numismatic magazines soon. Ought to help the stock price.


19 Jul 2014, 12:07 PM

There was no 1857 S dime.


There were 1856 S dimes, though. 70,000 struck.

Perhaps a Chilean citizen(s) joined the ship at Panama or Havana. Not everyone aboard was necessarily
coming from California. Commerce was also N/S and Chile is on the West coast so this ship seems as
sensible as any other as a way for a Chilean to get to NYC or USA.

Thank you for your efforts and honest opinion on the inventory. This certainly helps those of us with little rare coin
experience to understand the variables and complexity of making an accurate estimate. I also appreciate staying on
the conservative side of things and understand your dilemma imposed by the restrictions you mention.


I agree that more items will be brought up over the next two months and will only add to the amazing amount of
history recovered by TT and now the RLP/Odyssey.

Papa, on your question, the values are RETAIL.....what collectors are typically willing to pay based on current pricing
in the Coin Dealer Newsletter/Gray Sheet.


Bill, on your comments. One, be careful using the redbook for value estimates. Those estimates are set forth a year
before the redbook actually hits the market, so the prices are usually artificially high in the redbook. Also, on the
dimes, I would agree with you on values and condition except if you read my caveat #3, you will see that silver coins
become damaged in seawater. Collectors don't like to buy damaged coins. If those dimes were original, no seawater
corrosion, I would have estimated the value of the dimes at least at $6M dollars. But, we can't change what they are.
My guess is that whatever OMEX gets of the silver coins, they will do what they did with the republic half
dollars.......get them slabbed without a grade and call them "shipwreck affect" coins from the SSCA. They will
probably charge $1000 each for them, which numismatically is about 10 times their real value as seawater damaged
coins. But they do sell slowly. Some people buy them to have an artifact from the historical shipwreck. Of course, the
landscape on that could change if you are right and most are 1857-S Uncirculated dimes. They would still have the
seawater damage, but the uncirculated detail of the coins might make them worth a bit more, even to dealers and
collectors.....

Ship - Need some professional info, and you have become my "go to guy".


How does sea water affect US gold coins? They are 0.9 gold and 0.1 copper. Does sea water corrode the
copper content, even if it is an alloy? Will the coin's surface be marked?


Does a certificate of authenticity saying that it has been submerged 160 years increase or decrease a coin's
value, compared to one kept dry?


I presume the coins will all be conserved, or "cleaned", to remove coral, scale, etc. What tools are used to do
this? You think that is done on the ship, or after they are sold?


What would cause a "cluster" of numerous coins?


What is done to conserve silver coins? The guy who will conserve 9000 dimes will have steady employment. 
Thanks much!

Since the author suggests that OMEX may not survive August, is he committed to retaining his (and his company's)
short positions in OMEX and not recommending investors cover any short positions in OMEX through August?


19 Jul 2014, 04:48 PM


donb68
What you are referring to, in investment parlance, is a "short squeeze." When a number of short sellers all try to
"cover" their short at the same time, that does indeed drive the stock up.


Our approach when shorting is therefore to avoid in general stocks that already have a fairly hefty amount of existing
short sales. We try to set ourselves up so we'll never get squeezed.


I'll point out that short squeezes can be the result of better than expected earnings or some other fundamental
aspects of a company's operation. They can also be the result of direct manipulation. That is, profit-seeking
individuals with large amounts of cash at their disposal can look on a large short position in a stock as an invitation to
start buying, driving up the share prices, thus forcing short-sellers to cover. This in turn drives up the price, and before
you know it, the share price has soared!

The ship will probably continue salvage ops into October. If it costs $1 mil per month, or $33,000 per day, recovery of
only four $20 Double eagles will pay for one day. Anyone who has owned a boat knows they burn money even tied to
a dock. At least income is possible when on site.


Now for pure speculation - - -


Notice on the sonar image that the two boilers are maybe 50' off to the side? To get there, they must have fallen out of
the ship as it was sinking. Perhaps it rolled on its side and the heavy boilers became detached and crashed thru the
side. For our purposes, it gets them out of the way.


It was earlier noted that the orlop deck is the lowest deck on a ship. This would be where the boilers and coal bins
were, as well as any heavy cargo (like 15 tons of Army gold) in order to keep the ship's center of gravity low. Salvage
efforts to date have concentrated on the stern, where the Capt cabin and probably Purser's station were located.
Mention was made that coal was found in the stern area, which might indicate the coal bins were placed between the
boilers and the stern. I have not seen a ship's plan, which would show that. However, you would not stow cargo in an
area frequented by the crew. So the cargo stowage area is toward the bow, forward of the boilers and side-wheels?


Once the stern has been picked clean, the forward cargo area may be next for exploration. Bulk gold, due to its
density, would have been loaded first, and would be on the bottom of the cargo area. In any event, there should be
many artifacts and maybe valuables which passengers did not want to keep in their cabins.


RbobSA noted above that the Chilean coins could have belonged to Chilean citizens traveling to NYC, which is likely,
and the coins possibly quite rare.

shipbuilder1
Bill,


On your questions above, I'll try to keep answers reasonable short and succinct.


On gold vs. Silver seawater exposure, over significant periods of time, seawater will begin to infiltrate the surface of
the metal in silver. This causes a milky haze on the surface of the coin. This may happen also with gold but if so, it

takes alot longer. For example, the gold coins that were recovered from the Republic were conserved to original
condition. When they were submitted for third party grading using John Albanese at the time, the coins showed no
seawater damage and they were authenticated and graded as original. It's important to note that most of the
reputable third party grading companies will not assign a coin any grade, if it is damaged, abusively cleaned or shows
other signs of impairment. The fact the Republic gold coins were assigned a grade through Albanese's group (NGC)
tells us that the conservation of the coins completely removed any concretions, scaling and brought the coins back to
their original status, with no metal degradation and no visible evidence that the coins were subjected to any harsh
environment. The only reputable grading company that will assign a grade to impaired coins is ANAC. ANACS is a
good grading company, and the way they handle that is to give the coin a technical grade based on wear, and then
describe the damage....ie:Cleaned, Whizzed, Obverse Dig, Artificially Toned, etc.


Also, in the case of grading and encapsulating these coins, the plastic slabs will carry additional information which
provides the provenance that they are from the shipwreck of the SS Central America. This type of provenance
generally increases the market value of the coin. As I mentioned in another comment post, OMEX will probably
market and sell at least some percentage of these coins direct to the public to maximize profit, rather than wholesaling
through dealer networks.


The coins will definitely be "Conserved", NOT CLEANED. OMEX and the receiver will be responsible for getting their
own coins conserved and prepared for sale. Since OMEX has already retained a new conservation company, the
receiver may contract with OMEX to have his coins conserved along with the ones that will belong to OMEX. This
conservation effort will not take place at sea. When the coins are finally released from the Marshall's custody, if OMEX
does them all, they will be conserved by OMEX's conservator at the conservators facility. I do not know if the receiver
will wait to allow the conservation process to occur until the recovery project is finished, or if he will allow start of the
conservation to occur in increments as coins and artifacts are brought up.


As for conservation methods, you are probably better off doing web searches to find out what types there are. Real
Coin Conservators do not "Clean" coins. They conserve them back to their original condition if possible. One method
is an electrolytic bath. The coins are placed in the bath and electricity flows through the bath to reverse the processes
that have scaled the coins with concretions, scaling, etc. The process can take a few weeks. There are other
conservation processes for coins that you can read about on the web. I don't know which ones the conseravtor will
use in this case. The conservation has to be done before the coins are sold so that they can be exactly identified,
graded, slabbed, etc.


As for the silver coins, they will be conserved as best as possible, but will not be able to be fully conseved. The
surface of the silver coins will remain impaired by the seawater infiltration which causes the milky haze. What will
happen is that OMEX will have them slabbed as shipwreck affect coins. Except for ANACS, none of the other
reputable grading companies will assign a grade. But they will authenticate them and put a provemnance statement
on the slab stating it's from the SSCA shipwreck. If OMEX goes with ANACS, they will assign a technical grade (if
Mint state, it will only say Uncirculated based on no wear, and will not give a MS number grade, and will site
"Seawater Damage" or something to that effect. OMEX will probably market them direct to the public and let it take
whatever time (years) that it takes to sell them, because they will set the prices very high, as they did with the
Republic Silver Coins.


On your last question about what causes clusters of coins, this happens for coins on the ocean floor that are clustered
together and have been exposed to sealife biological deposits and metal deterioration concretions. For example, if a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320975-ssca-inventory-unsealed-confirms-disappointing-salvage-mesons-estimates 21/37


small cluster of coins is sitting on the ocean floor in contact with a bronze cannon, the deteriorating bronze will flow a
metal concretion onto the coins and essentially fuse them together. Same with sealife biological deposits. that's what
causes the clusters fused together.


Hope this answers your questions.

"MESON GETTING OUT"..(SO OBVIOUS) - My best guess for this latest post by Meson is that they used it to flush
out any last remaining weak hands in OMEX and get out - chances are they made a small profit..Anyone left long at
this point is surely confident and not planning to sell. Meson knows that given the recent fall in the price, from here the
main risk is on the upside and any positive news will spike the price and destroy all their profits of the past 8
months..and make the entire trade not worth it anymore (they would lose major face with their own investors).


Meson's "burn rate analysis" which suggests the company is forced into bankruptcy during an on-going operation -
due to banks limiting credit lines, despite valued recoveries above $20m - is just - (Silly). No bank would do that since
they would be hurting themselves..In these scenarios banks get internal approvals for credit line increases (just ask all
the real estate developers that were long past loan covenants over the past 10yrs - this is still normal operating
procedure). And - the banks could be held liable for tortuous interference if they are a senior lender and knowingly put
a business at risk without just cause...(Not gonna happen here - sorry but nice try Meson)


Meson claims the Receiver will take years to liquidate - which is also silly - as gold coins are an established market
with buoyant liquidity (quicker transactions than real estate) and probably the main reason the banks gave OMEX

credit against these assets in the first place. I can not think of a single excuse or reason why the receiver would (wait /
sit on) take more than 60 days to liquidate gold coins - not a single reason. In fact - the mandate of any receiver is to
maximize value in the shortest timeframe - so the idea the receiver would have multiple dealer buyers or even direct
interest from collectors and "wait" - puts the receiver in a negligence position and creates a non-action liability and
opens the receiver up to potential negligence legal claims (sorry Meson - Not gonna happen).


With OMEX market cap down at only $120m - Meson's risk /reward ratio is now much much worse than when it was a
$300m market cap (he made his easy money) and given the price action of the past few months has turned up he is
definitely heading for the exits...So obvious..

Here is Meson's Q1 shareholder letter - Mr. Morris has recently restructured his firm over the past year as it is no
longer Meson Capital Partners -now just Meson Capital.


http://bit.ly/1p4sQsv


Its an interesting read - note Meson was down in Q1 - and its clear from a chart of OMEX he would have made good
profits in Q2 - and surely he does not wish to risk a big drawdown in Q3 and Q4 with a poor analysis and give back all
his Q2 Profits if OMEX recent SS CA salvage prove worthwhile.


Additionally he compares OMEX to the odds of a winning lottery ticket being left in the street and somehow uses this
analogy to come up with a 1 in a trillion chance of success?? (crazy logic) Don't think his statistics professor would be
too impressed with this analogy as it is clearly idiotic. MR. Morris -the probability of shipwrecked treasure being worth
significant value (because others did not find it or recovery it) like an old lottery ticket in the street no one bothers to
pick up - is not 1 in a trillion and any of your investors that read such a statement should be worried about your own
business logic skills (Warren Buffet your esteemed idol, never made his fortune shorting stocks - you should stick to
finding overlooked deep value longs)..


I am certain you can find much better risk/reward activist short positions than OMEX given its current low
valuations..Remember the old saying, bulls make money, bears make money (well done to you in Q2) - pigs get
slaughtered..hoping OMEX goes bust and you make profits on your short from 1.25 down to 0.25 is piggish - and you
risk getting slaughtered when the stock spikes back to $2.50 or higher..kinda obvious.

MRPINK4092, thanks for that. I found it hilarious. Ryan Morris lacks the creds or brains to make any of his ideas
work. How many times does he think he can get away offering analysis that is counter to the news? He seems to think
he can "pull the wool" over us all, forever. I'm betting against him. He who was asked off the board of LEI, etc. 
I bought into Omex, gradually, after reading his (proven totally inaccurate) hit piece last Nov. My take was that it was
an angry spew and Mr Morris had no credibility. My opinion hasn't changed. He brags about being short! And will
"donate his profits to charity?" He is between a rock and a hard spot. Look at the articles he's posted compared to the
news. He CAN DEDUCT HIS LOSSES. That is more likely to happen, IMHO. Which charity, Ryan Morris? Name one!
Who is going to benefit from R Morris shorting this?

MRPINK/Randy,


I agree with your analysis. I like OMEX's chances here and am waiting for the next inventory sheet to be made public.
If that sheet shows more gold and artifacts recovered to pile onto the the first inventory already released, you are
going to see investors pile into this stock and the shorts will begin to head for the hills. I have seen speculators pile
into OMEX before, and I think that we just need to see one more decent inventory sheet come out that shows the
"ship of gold" was the real deal and is still laden with treasure which OMEX will recover every last coin and bar on the
site.


Ultimately, Meson made a strategic mistake when they started their short campaign.......that mistake was
underestimating OMEX management and their ability to attract profitable salvage work, because they really are that
good at what they do. Meson got caught with their pants down when OMEX and the CA receiver announced that
OMEX was awarded the recovery contract for the Central America. Since they committed so heavily to a short
position before that news, they have had no choice but to print op-ed pieces to try and tell everyone that the CA will
not be profitable for OMEX, that Oceanica is worthless, that OMEX is on the verge of bankruptcy, regardless of what
the real and published facts are. They are sitting on a tinder box and one more CA inventory sheet, or one more piece
of good news from OMEX will blow the lid off and the short squeeze will begin.

Rbob, you're not exactly going out on a limb predicting a non-response from Ryan. He has consistently disappeared
whenever the questions get tough.


Here's another question for Ryan Morris that others have asked before but to which he has refused response: you
have previously stated, "I, Ryan Morris, pledge to donate personal OMEX short sale profits to charity." Since Meson's
gain last year was 100% due to your short position in OMEX, you would have earned a performance fee at Meson.
This would certainly qualify as personal profits derived from selling OMEX short. Can you share with everyone
whether or not you donated these profits to a charity, and also share with us the amount and the charity (if more than
one, a complete list would be helpful.)


If you cannot provide this information, your readers will assume the worst. Thank you for the clarification.

I asked this same question when he made the original statement that he would donate to charity and SA took

The main reason this company found less coins last month was they focused on the stern section where there were
no passenger cabins. They also had to go through a lot of overburden to start the main excavation going forward.


As the excavation progresses forward they will start to hit the passenger area cabins and that is where you would
expect to see the passenger gold.


The cabin passengers are just forward of the stern so they may be finding quality gold now, and once you move
forward of midships you hit all the steerage passenger areas.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320975-ssca-inventory-unsealed-confirms-disappointing-salvage-mesons-estimates 25/37


There were 102 first cabin passengers, 48 second cabin passengers, and 326 steerage passengers for a total of 476
passengers. All of those areas still have to be excavated.


Of the gold found so far, it has been close to the estimates given by the company. They claimed about $93,000 was
left in commercial gold and that is close to what they recovered in the stern area. So far they have found about
$120,000 worth without going through the passenger areas.


Now they will be doing that, and we will see what the passengers left behind. But it is way too early to declare
anything other than they found the rest of the commercial gold as reported and still have to start the main passenger
gold excavations.


Some of the passengers prior to leaving for this trip took withdrawals out of the main bank in gold and those were
recorded so they do have an idea on what a few of the passengers carried. Many I would guess they don't so that is
the mystery of what remains.

Meson/Rick Morris,


Thanks for the latest inventory sheet. On the surface the raw number of $20 gold pieces only looks "ho-hum", until
you dig into the numismatic quality. Of those <150 $20 gold coins, 32 of them are very rare private minted Kellog and
Company, Moffat and Co, Wass Mollitor, and US gov't US Assay Office (USAO) coins.........not to make a pun, but
those coins are worth their weight in gold (really potentially each of those could be worth 3, 4, or 5 times the value of
their SF mint 1857-S counterparts. So, thanks again. I'll analyze the list and post my value estimate for that soon, for
all who are interested.

Pequod,


Your numbers are all good. I did my own due diligence on the remaining potential gold on the CA some months ago
and posted it in the comments of another SA article. I found the mint records that showed what passengers of the CA
had been paid by the SF mint just days before they departed on their trip to the CA. My conservative estimate was
(between left over commercial gold and passenger gold) that there was $260K (1857 specie and gold bars) that was
likely left on the CA after the Tommy T recovery. I still hold to that, which means you are correct in your
comments........Omex has only recovered about half what is still left, and they will pick the site clean. And of course,
depending on which side of the fence you are on, there's the army gold bars too. I've done a lot of research there, and
I feel that they might actually be there. But even if not, I'm still seeing a recovery of about $80M dollars (todays
dollars) which if OMEX is entitled to roughly $45M, they will be good to go.

Shortsqueeze.com shows 24 mil shares of OMEX sold short, out of a 70 mil share "float", or 34%. This is up 1 mil
from June 1. Either the short sellers actually believe the company is going bankrupt, or they are now on the defensive
and are adding shorts in order to hold down the share price. There is no way they can all cover and exit in a few days,
they have trapped themselves. They have to be very nervous and making doctors' appointments to check for ulcers.
This is a potentially explosive situation! Significant recoveries from CA, Army gold, permission to salvage HMS
Victory, a new shipwreck, even higher gold prices, any one could be the trigger.


There are only about 90 days left for CA salvage work this year, and we can probably subtract 10 days for two
hurricane escapes. Excavating individual cabins will be tedious, slow work, and may preclude completion this year.
But if fruitful, another salvage operation there in the future may be warranted.


OMEX mentioned possible salvage ops in the southern hemisphere which is needed for better ship utilization. Ocean
salvaging just cannot be done subject to winter winds.

All,


I valued the short inventory list that Rick Morris provided, and used the same restrictions again. Essentially only
assigned values for the gold. No silver, no foreign coins, no jewelry, etc. The interesting thing was that there were 32
USAO, Moffat, Wass Mollitor and Kellog private mint $10 and $20 coins. Some of those coins (especially the Moffat
and Wass Mollitor $10 coins) could be worth $150,000 each, or more, depending on grade. Again, I was very
conservative, valuing the private mint coins likely at half their actual value, and the $20 1857-S coins at $5K each.
Based on those metrics I came up with a value estimate of $1.7M dollars. My higher, more realistic value estimate
would be somewhere in the $2.5M dollar range.


Bill------on your question about the US Assay Office Coins, the US Mint established it's own Assay Office in California
after the gold rush, to compete with the private assayers who were conducting business there at the time. It was
separate from the SF branch mint where official US gold coins were minted. Part of this was because there were alot
of unscrupulous assayers who were prone to cheat the public. So the US mint set up their own assay office operation
to give confidence to people who wanted their gold assayed and coined.

Well,


No one said that deep treasure ship salvage was easy or quick. My understanding is that they spent much of the last
month moving coal and debris to clear the next area for excavation and recovery. We'll see what the next inventory
holds. On the spending, you know the old saying....."you gotta spend money to make money". I think there are going
to be good months and bad months to this salvage effort. The last 30 days was definitely a bad month.


I'm curious on your thoughts to a question......what monetary figure of total recovered assets would you consider this
to be an economical recovery wothwhile for OMEX?


23 Jul 2014, 01:00 PM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I believe Greg Stemm said it would cost them $10mm in an interview we quoted back in the
original SSCA article in April or so. However they have overhead costs and the company is burning
$3mm/month all in and does not have any other projects they are working on (other than Oceanica which I
believe is dead - see most recent article) so if it takes 6 mos of work * $3mm/month they'd need to salvage
~$40mm just to break even I am guessing. The problem is that they won't get ~$18mm (max I think) or
whatever their share ends up being for quite a long time - there are many other claims on the court and it has
proven highly complex - I didn't even see the CADG risk coming. It seems like there are even more risks than
I am aware of and am obviously looking for them...


23 Jul 2014, 01:44 PM


RbobSA
Mr. Morris, please identify another claim before the court. It is my understanding that the matter was settled in
RLP's favor, period and OMEX is their 'employee' or agent. Other claimants have had 2 decades and more to
present their claims, indeed that was much of what stymied Mr Thompson. I find your assertion that "... there
are many other claims on the court ..." to be without merit.


I'm also fairly astounded that you claim "I didn't even see the CADG risk coming." Coming from you, an
alleged expert on OMEX, that is cause for pause.


Finally, I ask again, which charity will you endow when? Thanks in advance for your reply.

Meson/Rick Morris,


The question on conservation work is a good one. Most of it can be done in an electrolytic bath with large numbers of
coins in the bath at one time. Depending on how well the EB works, there might be additional conservation techniques
applied on a coin by coin basis after the bath. The Bath process is slow......can take a few weeks to a month, but large
amounts of coins and bars get done in the same timeframe in the Bath.


In reading the letters to the court, it appears that the Conservation Group that OMEX contracted to is being used as
the Alternate custodian for the CA coins, bars and artifacts. I would think (but don't know for sure) that the conservator
may be conserving the materials they receive as they get them. But, if that's not happening and everything waits to be
conserved until most or all is brought up, the conservation process could take a month or 2. Then the coins have to be
slabbed and attributed. That number of coins may take another few months or more to slab and attribute. But,
understand that this is mostly speculation on my part. I do not know what conservation and attribution approach that
OMEX and the receiver will decide upon. I also do not know if the receiver and OMEX will use different
sales/disposition strategies. In the past, in order to maximize numismatic value and provenance value, OMEX has
marketed the coins at higher prices direct to the collector market through their marketing contractor. They have gotten
insanely high prices for some of the numismatic material they have sold.......much more than I would have been
willing to pay......but someone was paying it. Of course this approach takes time and I do not know how OMEX will
monetize their CA material. The receive may only be interested in shot gunning his material to a large dealer at
wholesale prices to liquidate quickly. But I don't know if OMEX management will want to do that. They will likely
determine what is the most efficient sales or marketing method for the different types of material they have and do a
mixture of disposition methods.....I just don't know.

My guess is that Omex will sell some at Auction, sell some direct wholesale to dealers, and sell some via their
marketing strategy. That way, some of the material will be monetized rather quickly as they likely will need a decent
cash infusion, but still leaving some to market and maximize profit.

holding OMEX stock. If the price goes significantly lower than now (1.28) I will buy more if it looks like the company

That is a little less than a ringing endorsement of investing in Omex. What in Ryan's non-objectivity is causing
you to waiver? Are we seeing a volte face here. Is it the fisherman or the fear that Omex won't be able to go
to their lender to amend the terms to reflect the fact that a lot of the other denominations of coins are good
security too. Lenders are in the business to lend when their money is not at risk. I also think they
(NASDAQ:OMEX) are also trying to Show the Victory foundation that they are more than opportunistic
Treasure Hunters or Deep Net Bottom trawler fishermen- but more that they are able to and do proper t
archeology. That is my view and I will be buying more shares today rather than wait until Ryan has ceased

Don't misunderstand me. I still hold a significant amount of OMEX stock. And I think they are going to pull through and
continue as a going concern. BUT....I can't control investor panic when they see the balance sheet in the 10Q filing
and see that OMEX only has a million or 2 million dollars in cash to operate with. Did you happen to see what
happened to the stock when they filed that info in their last filing in May? The stock price cratered because too many
investors only see the numbers......they don't see managements ability to improvise and to keep on top of their
financing requirements. i have great faith in OMEX, but I think the stock is going to take a hit on weak cash position in
early August and I would rather buy in at the lower price, than speculate now, especially since I'm already speculating
holding about 15 thousand shares.


And you also have to understand that we are not talking about a blue chip company here. Omex always has been and
always will be a speculative play. Ringing endorsements are not warranted. The play is all about managing to make
some money and maybe, just maybe getting lucky and being on the good side of spectacular treasure haul.. That's
why I did not liquidate my entire holding this summer. I still believe in the Army gold scenario, as well as Oceanica and
the Victory.


I'm not here to convince you to invest, but for those of us who chose to invest in this company, it helps to read and
learn all the current information we can about what is going on, so that we can adjust our investments in the company
accordingly. As Bill H has said prior, this stock is alot of fun. That doesn't mean it's safe or easy.


I'm in a rather unique position since I was on the good side of the OMEX trade when they brought up the Black Swan
treasure. Even though it was ultimately a failure, the stock Quadrupled to 9 bucks a share and I made a $100K. I'm
just playing with some of the profits.


Good Luck.

take every edge I can get. You have to do the same thing investing in OMEX. That's why the information here is so
important.


Even still, sometimes we take breaks from the SA forum to get rejuvinated. One thing I'll tell you......I'm always honest.
I tell it like I see it. Many times I say I might be wrong too, so that people who read my posts don't take my word as
gospel.......because God knows it's not. I've made my share of mistakes.


I might be wrong about the upcoming 10Q. If so, I will have missed a buying opportunity. I've taken that into account
and my stock holdings are positioned accordingly, based on my investing strategy and my risk tolerance. But
ultimately, each of us has to make our own decisions. You can call it living with the consequences. I learned a long
time ago that if I was not willing to live with the consequences, I don't invest or speculate.


Just remember, none of us are investing in stocks for "fun". We want to make money. If I had 10 million dollars, you
wouldn't know me because I would have no reason to have any money in stocks and would never read SA. I would be
doing what I love.......coin collecting and running a small town coin shop. I would not care if I was making 2% in a
money market fund. That said, I've always been of the mindset not to get greedy. There have been times when I've
sold out of OMEX and only made 200 bucks. But it's better than losing a thousand. And it's like the casino, then I can
come back and play another day, instead of risking the mortgage payment.


So have fun, be careful, and take profits even if it's only a little bit.


Take care.

Bill H,


No, I don't run a coin shop now. I did back in the late 1980's, but got out of the business to take the job I have now as
a defense contractor.......pays more money. Eventually, as I get closer to retirement I will either open another coin
shop or work for a small local coin shop. I really like being around coins and collectors.

Cliff,


I did a lot of due diligence on how much 1857 value gold might still have been on the CA (Before we started getting
the actual inventories that OMEX is really bringing up). If you read my comment posts from a few months ago, you will
see that I said I believed that, conservatively, there could be about $260,000 of 1857 value gold left on the CA. Now,
fast forward to late July and OMEX has recovered about $100,000 to $125,000 of 1857 specie and value. Army gold
aside, I am still holding to my estimate of $260,000, which means that OMEX has only recovered about half so far.


The real question will be, how hard will it be to find and bring up the rest.....like Papa lamented a few months ago, "it
might be an EIEIO recovery.....here a coin, there a coin, everywhere a coin-coin". That could get time consuming.
Right now, I'm estimating that 2014 value already recovered is close to $40M in real numismatic value. If they bring
up as much again over the next months, they will be doing OK. The recovery will be on par with the Gairsoppa, which
helped them greatly. Assuming that success, the stock price at 1.30 per share is cheap.

I was thinking of your DD and estimates when I was guessing what could still be in the hull or debris field. An

greatly." How widely scattered of what remains will be a key factor. Look at the fact that they recovered almost 3 Kg of
nuggets/dust from sluicing and panning the sediment around where the commercial gold was found.


From what I can read, the debris field has yet to be worked with the exception of the safe. I do not believe it is the
Purser's safe and it got me wondering how many of the staterooms may have been furnished with its own safe, or
how many safes may have been on board. It seems like I read somewhere the CA had carried about one-fifth of all
the gold sent from California to the east so it wasn't their first rodeo and we don't know what accommodations may
have been in place for passengers to safeguard their gold. Obviously from passenger stories we know that many
chose to carry gold on their person.

Lot 143 Sale 9562 —  
GOLD RUSH TREASURES FROM THE SS CENTRAL AMERICA  
14 December 2000  
Spink America


Large group of fused silver coins, 17 pieces. Visible pieces include 1830 Half Dollar, 1848 Half Dollar, an 1853 Arrows
Quarter and other coins. (Total: 17 pieces). One of the most fascinating and spectacular lots in the present sale,
offering a unique glimpse into the common pocket change of 1850s San Francisco. 
Roughly 135 mm x 32 mm with silver-gray mingling with shades of green. The casual viewer may discern at least two
Bust Halves, three Liberty Seated Halves, and an 1853 With Arrows quarter. 
The rest of the pieces, those in the middle of this accretion or unidentifiable due to erosion, are undoubtedly half
dollars (or four reales?) from their diameters. Just how these coins found their way into this nicely aligned but not
perfectly stacked position is fodder for debate, though original storage in a money belt or small sack seems likely. Of
the highest interest and historical value, an incredible grouping that would find its best home in an exhibit where it
could be viewed by the public-might we suggest the Smithsonian Institution, the American Numismatic Association, or
the American Numismatic Society? Of course, virtually any museum within the state of California would find it of
commanding interest and importance as well. A very exciting offering!  
It brought $11, 500 (est. $2000-4000 )and no one seems to giving any value for the silver and check out the values
obtained in 2000 for the Ingots when gold was a lot less.

Taste,


Your observations were my point exactly when I placed my restrictions on my value estimates last week and the week
before. I believe my estimates and the OMEX conservators estimates are WAY LOW because you simply cannot
value or anticipate collector enthusiasum for a lot of these unique items that are tied to the historical wreck itself. Your
Spink example was a perfect example of silver coins being sold for far in excess of their numismatic value because
they are unique to the CA shipwreck. As seawater damaged coins, without the provenance, those fused silver coins
would have only been worth a few thousand dollars, as Spink's initial auction estimate indicates. Yet they got $11,500.

I also believe that the gold bars (private mint assay bars) will command anywhere from 5X spot gold price to 20X spot
gold price. I'm not pulling those numbers out of my hat. There were a lot of private mint assay bars from the first
Tommy T recovery that commanded those multiples. I firmly believe that my value estimates and the estimates of the
OMEX conservator are "Ultra Low".


Cliff.......I agree with your assessment too. Since the CA was involved in a lot of gold shipment transfers during that
time for almost 5 years, it is very plausible that they learned lessons and did special outfitting with special
accommodations in passenger rooms for folks who wanted to keep their valuables in safe keeping, but close by in
their control with easy access. This happens all the time today when you travel.....safes in your hotel room or cruise
ship cabin......they got the idea from many years ago, like back in the 1800's.

I must be missing the ball. I did not hear any news or updates from OMEX today. Where did you get the statement

provide an operational update? let me know. I seem to be news deprived, or maybe I just don't know where to look.

He was Fox news. Didn't really say much that was new, but did mention the safe and that they thought it was the
Captain's. I'm guessing because they think the packet of papers tied by the twine were SSCA passenger tickets. I
don't know what the protocol would have been for collecting and keeping tickets during a 1857 voyage.

Just in case anyone missed the conference call, Gordon said that there have been more significant recoveries of gold
and artifacts from the CA over the last few weeks in August, which I could carefully interpret as more along the
quantity of the May/June recoveries. He stated the inventory sheets for that will posted in the next few weeks, which is
reeasonable since OE has been on the site for almost a month since July 20. They have to come back to port for re-
supply and will off-load treasure at that time......probably in the next week.......keep checking vessel finder.


Obviously, no bankruptcy is coming, given their 5.7M cash position and new loan facility over and above fifth third,
plus other revenue sources that management discussed.


The next three months should be happy months for all of us who held through the tenuous and uncertain times. I still
hold by my earlier statement that 2014 is the "real summer of opportunity" for Odyssey, and I am going to tightly hold
every share I own. Buying any dips will be the order of the day.

"“Subsequent to the quarter, Odyssey entered into a binding letter of intent for a long-term marketing
agreement and new funding vehicle that is non-dilutive to Odyssey shareholders and provides $10 million to
the company. The agreement provides for an immediate payment of $5 million upon closing and up to an
additional $5 million based on benchmarks that the company expects to achieve in the third and fourth
quarters of 2014.”


"In addition to this new funding facility, we are pursuing other cash inflow options such as monetizing a stake
in our subsidiary Oceanica, collection of receivables, and monetization of the SS Central America cargo,"
stated Philip Devine, Odyssey's CFO. "In parallel to these cash inflows, management expects to reduce the
company's operating cash needs by at least one third by the end of the year."

Hi Ship, Papa et al,


I think this is a terrific read and flies in the face of Meson Capital's dour predictions.


Oceanica is a project that to my mind, is going to happen and now that OMEX has sufficient cash to see it through the
labyrinth of the Mexican environmental approval process, I'm going to buy a few more shares at this low price. OMEX
was so smart to delay the request for authorization and get input from the various affected groups. It's the long but
surest road.

Meson/Rick Morris,


I suppose I should close the loop on your earlier question about my post concerning "pre-monitization" which you
asked me about 6 weeks ago.......you asked "how can they pre-monetize when they do not control the inventory and
the assets are already collateralized to fifth third". I advised you at that time that I could not know the details since
OMEX would not release that type of information until the quarterly report and conference call.


Well, regardless of what we call it, it became clear in the q filing and conference call on Monday evening that Odyssey
management did in fact strike a pre-monetization deal with a major marketing firm who they described as having
extensive experience in the selling of collectible coins and artifacts. The deal was $5M dollars up front to OMEX and
an additional $5M when certain additional recovery milestones are met. It seems obvious to me now that the coin
show talk and speculation by floor dealers in May and June that, other large dealers were trying to get first dibs on the
CA coins and assay bars, was in fact true. The large coin dealers are really nothing more than large numismatic
marketing firms who have extensive experience in selling coins and other numismatic material to collectors, investors
and other dealers.


So, that is how OMEX management smartly went about "pre-monetizing" the CA coins and Assay bars that they do
not control and are already collateralized to fifth third. They didn't call it pre-monetization, but effectively, that's what
the marketing firm deal was. the Marketing firm is obviously willing to take on a level of risk to have the right to market
and sell the CA assets to their clients, because you are correct that the assets are collateralized to fifth third and the
marketing firm knows that. However, the collateral coins and bars still belong to Odyssey Marine. All OMEX has to do
is pay back the fifth third loan which is against their collateral, and then OMEX regains their CA gold coins/gold bars
collateral so that the coin dealer marketing firm can sell the material at it's true market value, which is substantially
more than the collateral value of $2K per coin and 75% estimated value per gold bar.


I just wanted to fully and accurately answer your question, now that OMEX has legally shared all of their quarterly
financial information according to SEC regulations.
