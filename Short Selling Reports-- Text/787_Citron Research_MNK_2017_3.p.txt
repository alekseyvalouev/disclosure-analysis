for Mallinckrodt … The FDA has just
disclosed information that could lead
to criminal prosecution of Mallinckrodt
executives. Three weeks ago, Express
Scripts, the PBM whose subsidiaries
are responsible for executing the
entire delivery chain for Mallinckrodt’s
Acthar, made a group of damning
statements: that Acthar was an old
drug, grossly overpriced, with very
limited patient need, and was being
used for label indications for which
there was no clinical evidence.


THIS JUST GOT MUCH MORE
SERIOUS THAN PROFITS


THIS WEEK THE FDA
RELEASED THE UPDATED
ADVERSE EVENT
DATABASE (FAERS) WITH
COMPLETE 2016 DATA.


Citron has spent a week extracting
the �les and created a database for
analysis. This is the �rst time this
information is public. This new data
reports sharply increasing numbers
of deaths and hospitalizations
associated with use of Acthar which
are unprecedented over its history.
During the periods covered, Acthar is
showing single digit increases in unit
volumes, while Adverse Events are
being posted in excess 277% CAGR
for the period 2012 through 2016.

Questions and Answers on
FDA’s Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS)


These statistics are startling, considering Pulitzer Prize winning journalist
Gretchen Morgenson �rst introduced Wall Street to the negative FAERS
data on Acthar in 2014 – long before the major jump in adverse events.

WHY THIS COULD NOW BECOME A CRIMINAL
MATTER


Citron believes the reason for the increase in adverse events is the
company’s aggressive expansion of Acthar into new indications, where it
has not conducted clinical trials in order to prove its safety for those
conditions. This explanation is not just idle speculation. A recent Qui Tam
Lawsuit, �led by Barry Franks, former sales manager of Auto-Immune and
Rare Disease Division of Mallinckrodt. The following statements are
excerpts from the lawsuit, and point directly to the cause behind the

increase in deaths and hospitalizations. Franks, a seasoned and
experienced pharma sales professional, was expected to deliver sales
results that were not supported by lawful drug sales practices. These
excerpts from the full suit provide investors a chilling picture of how the
company’s policies directed sales reps to push Acthar beyond its label
conditions.


33. “However, the reason for the “explosive growth” of other
Rheumatology sales teams at that point in time was due, in part,
to MALLINCKRODT requesting that its representative promote the
Acthar drug in an illegal, o�-label manner.”


35. “Franks was clear that he would not engage in illegal activities
to increase sales”… Despite this, and being advised that
employees were told by compliance to not to “put anything in
writing” …


37. “A similar push and acknowledgement that to keep his job,
Franks essentially had to push in o�-label areas…”


40. “Franks is informed and believes that there were illegal sales
practices being committed in other regions…”


42. Franks was also aware of other compliance related issues at
MALLINCKRODT, which Franks is informed and believes and
thereon alleges that these issues include but are not limited to:
potentially insurance/Medicare fraud related to the re�lls as
noted above, HIPAA violations where four or eight week
prescriptions were provided where there was no patient visit …
This was done to “game the system” and potentially commit
insurance/Medicare fraud.)

A NOTE TO MALLINCKRODT:


Before you respond:


These are not the statistics of some short seller or journalist who you
dispute in Press Releases. This is not even the opinion of your PBM. This is

the FDA. This is not the time to issue some nonsense PR, this is the time to
call your lawyers. Remember, the FAERS database is voluntary — it might
actually understate the harm you are doing to your o�-label patients. Note:
Remember Mallinckrodt claims it does not de�nitively know the active
ingredient of this expensive and potentially dangerous drug. As stated on
their own website:


Note: Remember Mallinckrodt claims it does not de�nitively know the

“While the exact way that Acthar works in the body is
unknown, further studies are being conducted.”

So while they have taken billions of dollars from
Medicare… they do not even have a scienti�c grasp on the
safety pro�le, let alone e�cacy, while they knowingly
HARM patients who as their sales team pushes the
medication beyond the core indications.
How have they done this? Through unscrupulous doctors!


As Mallinckrodt has become more and more aggressive expanding marketing
into untested indications, these are the type of doctors that have become
associated with Acthar.


According to the FDA, the TOP #1 prescriber of Acthar was Dr. David Mandel.


Dr. Mandel was charged criminally with importing misbranded drugs by the
DOJ


Worse, read here that top prescriber Dr. Sean Orr was misdiagnosing people
with Multiple Sclerosis just so he could prescribe Acthar.

A NOTE TO MALLINCKRODT:


Please Do not respond with your standard line that:


“HP Acthar Gel makes a signi�cant di�erence in
the lives of thousands of very sick patients” and is
‘responsibly priced”


Then why did the nation’s most pre-eminent formulary manager just state
the exact opposite?


Enter Imprimis, who, through its spino� Eton Pharmaceuticals, just announced it
will be launching a competitor to Acthar, while enlisting the former CEO of
Questcor to join its Board of Directors and advise on its’ launch of an Acthar
competitor.


Eton plans on charging 40% less for its product than Mallinckrodt’s price.


When Imprimis did this to Mylan and the EpiPen, Mylan immediately created a
generic version at half the price of the branded EpiPen. Imprimis executed a
similar strategy with Turing Pharma, through the launch of a generic costing
1/750th of Turing’s price, immediately forcing Turing to reduce its drug’s price.


Lower priced alternatives to Acthar will enable patients to be treated with a
product that has a direct �led safety pro�le with the FDA, and will create a
disincentive for bad medicine to be practiced for the sake of greed.


More importantly, by being able to focus on people who can really bene�t by
Acthar and not be forced by the burden of a multi billion debt load, Eton will be
able to penetrate and dominate the only market that Acthar Gel has a place in
and not further hurt its patient base.

CONCLUSION
The most expensive drug on the Medicare dashboard is:


Untested,


Over Prescribed


Inferior to Competition


… and now Dangerous


The FDA has told you, their former employees have told you, and we now wait
for the Department of Justice.


It is time for Congress or Express Scripts to act responsibly and stop this billion
dollar charade before more people are hurt.
