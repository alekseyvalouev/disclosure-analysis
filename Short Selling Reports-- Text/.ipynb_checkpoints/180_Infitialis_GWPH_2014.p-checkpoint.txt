GW Pharmaceuticals: High As A Kite And Too Close To The Sun

by: Infitialis


Investors in industries deemed popular or in vogue by the general public have a
propensity to engage in folly often resulting in the manifestation of valuation bubbles for
the pioneering companies. As the great Charles Mackay wrote in 1841: "Men, it has been
well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover
their senses slowly, and one by one." Nearly 200 years later, these words are still relevant
as even nowadays men find it difficult to act against the herd while the herd goes mad.


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in an effort to identify bubbles
before they implode. In this report, we will be exposing folly on the scale of our prior
expos√©s on NASDAQ listed firms such as The Tile Shop and Mellanox and prior fraud
report on Medical Marijuana Inc. (OTCPK:MJNA). Purportedly operating in the same
sector as MJNA, GW Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:GWPH) appears massively over-
valued and presents a clear and present risk to long investors.


1. Marijuana Hype Overplayed: GW Pharmaceuticals will derive no benefit from the
nascent retail marijuana market opportunity in Colorado, Washington, and other
legalizing states.


2. Corrupted Research: The purported "research literature" regarding marijuana plant-
derived cannabidiol (CBD) use in pediatric treatment-resistant epilepsy seems
especially dubious because GW Pharmaceuticals has corrupted the objectivity of the
authors by being their financial backers; it has failed to disclose this critical fact in SEC
filings or investor materials.


3. Limited Intellectual Property & Pricing Power: Because GW Pharmaceuticals' main
products are natural plant-derived extracts, they cannot be patented and there are
basically no barriers to other firms extracting and selling the same biologicals. For
example, just because orange juice is demonstrated to provide a health benefit doesn't
mean that a company can earn outsized returns by selling concentrated Vitamin C.


4. Ridiculous Market Valuation: As of yesterday's close of $57.44/ADS, GW
Pharmaceuticals is currently trading at a market capitalization of $1,098.5m, for a
shocking valuation of 19.6x LTM revenue and 18.5x P/B despite barely being break-
even on an operating cash flow basis since its reverse-merger formation in 2001.


5. Backdoor Listing onto NASDAQ: After completing a reverse-merger listing in 2001 to
the London AIM exchange (equivalent to U.S. OTC market listing), GW

Pharmaceuticals listed its American Depository Shares (ADS) on the NASDAQ on
05/01/13 as an "emerging growth company" under the relaxed regulatory requirements
of the JOBS Act at only $8.90/ADS.


6. Massive Shareholder Dilution: GW Pharmaceuticals has been a serial issuer of equity,
massively diluting its common shareholders since its listing without significant
technological advancement or technology monetization. For example, GW
Pharmaceuticals sold a 5.8% stake in the Company for $11.2mm in 2009 ($193mm
implied enterprise valuation) to a private equity firm with a history of backing some
rather dubious biotech offerings.


7. Egregious Insider Compensation: Annual management compensation has generally
exceeded annual operating income since the reverse-merger formation in 2001.
Moreover, while public shareholders have been significantly diluted over GW
Pharmaceuticals' history as a public company, management and insider compensation
has increased 205.9%.


8. Preposterous Sell-Side Analyst Cheerleading: Underwriters of GW Pharmaceuticals'
numerous equity market issuances have been relentless cheerleaders of the "story"
since the single digit listing of the ADS last summer. As the ADS price has rocketed up
545% over the last 9 months since listing on the NASDAQ, the sell-side analysts have
continually raised their price targets as prior estimates were blown through and utilized
"goal-seek" financial models to justify their current estimates. Utilizing more realistic
valuation assumptions, GW Pharmaceuticals' intrinsic value appears to be in the teens
per ADS even in the unlikely upside case the proposed Epidiolex epilepsy treatment is
a blockbusters success.


Long investors in GW Pharmaceuticals should immediately consider reducing the position
as public dissemination of these significant concerns will likely lead to a massive
correction in the Company's share price. Speculative investors should consider a short
position in GW Pharmaceuticals as it appears massively overvalued on a fundamental
basis at 19.6x LTM revenue and 18.5x P/B and the additional issues uncovered in this
report will likely accelerate a significant pricing correction.


GW Pharmaceuticals Introduction


Founded in 1998 by current Chairman Dr. Geoffrey Guy to monetize a product portfolio of
cannabinoid prescription medicines to meet patient needs under medical supervision, GW
Pharmaceuticals has purportedly assembled a large in-house team with extensive
experience in developing cannabinoids, medicines containing controlled substances, as
well as plant-based prescription pharmaceutical products.

GW's lead product, Sativex is now approved or recommended for approval in 24 minor
countries, such as Norway, Israel, and Austria. It is indicated as a treatment for symptom
improvement in patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS)
that have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication. GW has now
entered into five separate licensing agreements for Sativex with Bayer HealthCare in the
UK and Canada; Almirall in Europe and Mexico; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in the
United States; Novartis in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia; and Neopharm in Israel. Over
the ~10-year history of Sativex production, GW has generally been operating at a cash
flow loss due to limited sales of the product and expensive ongoing operating costs for the
corporate entity.


GW's other products, Epidiolex and the GWP4200x derivatives are seen by many long
investors as providing upside opportunities and are currently beginning Phase III and II
programs, respectively, for the potential treatment of Dravet Syndrome, a form of epilepsy
particularly resistant to traditional pharmaceutical treatment regimes, and other ailments.


Marijuana Hype Overplayed


GW Pharmaceuticals' sole business model is the monetization of a product portfolio of
cannabinoid prescription medicines to meet patient needs under direct medical
supervision. The Company will derive no benefit from the nascent retail marijuana market
opportunity in Colorado, Washington, and other legalizing states. As an analogy, after the
repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the businesses that prospered were the ex-bootlegger
brewers such as Anheuser-Busch, not a pharmaceutical firm that was attempting to study
the medical benefits of a daily glass of wine in the prevention of cardiac disease.


Next, it is important to understand that medical research into potential uses of marijuana-
derived cannabidiols has been ongoing for hundreds of years and has yet to be
successfully monetized on a pharmaceutical scale. This makes it even harder to believe
that a UK reverse-merger pharmaceutical company with a limited scientific track record
will be able to successfully develop and monetize novel uses of marijuana. Simply put,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2034243-gw-pharmaceuticals-high-as-a-kite-and-too-close-to-the-sun 4/39


GW Pharmaceuticals' research efforts show nothing new or special to warrant such a
premium market valuation. For example, in 1842, Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, a
Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College of Calcutta, published a paper describing
the uses of marijuana to reduce infantile convulsions, hydrophobia, masseter spasm, and
other afflictions. More recently, there have been four limited control independent trials to
study the use of marijuana plant-derived cannabidiol for the treatment of drug-resistant
epilepsy.


Notably, the two most recent controlled independent trials to study the use of marijuana
plant-derived cannabidiol for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy showed NO
difference in treatment efficacy between the CBD and placebo (sugar-pill) patients.
Moreover, in the Ames trial, several of the CBD-treated patients suffered from adverse
drowsiness (being stoned) that would prevent them from functioning normally on a daily
basis, which further calls into question the viability of this purported potential treatment
option. Finally, Dr. Orrin Devinksy, Chairman of the NYU Epilepsy Center and leader in the
study of cannabidiols, recently wrote an Op-ed in the NY Times that cautioned about the
risk of serious psychiatric disorders and long-term cognitive problems associated with
marijuana treatments in children.


Corrupted Research and Pseudo-Science


The purported "research literature" regarding marijuana plant-derived cannabidiol use in
pediatric treatment-resistant epilepsy touted by the Company seems especially dubious
because GW Pharmaceuticals funded the researcher, yet failed to disclose its financial
interest in the study in its SEC filings or investor materials. Unlike previous placebo-
controlled trials, the recent December 2013 article in The Journal of Epilepsy and
Behavior was solely a 19-patient survey of parents belonging to a Facebook group
dedicated to sharing information about the cannabidiol-enriched cannabis artisanal
treatments for their child's seizures. Simply put, it is hard to imagine a purported research

project constructing a more biased self-selected sample set (with a complete lack of
placebo control group). Even worse, buried in the Acknowledgements section on the last
page of the journal, it is disclosed that Dr. Catherine Jacobson, the corresponding author
for the article, is actually funded by GW Pharmaceuticals, which presents a massive
conflict of interest, and the disclosure fails to mention GW's sole business is the
production of marijuana plant-derived cannabidiols. It is shocking investors have been
hoodwinked by such flimsy pseudo-science regarding Epidiolex's potential.


Limited Intellectual Property Results in No Pricing Power


Because GW Pharmaceuticals' main products are derived from a natural plant extract, it
cannot patent its products and there are basically no barriers to other firms extracting and
selling the same biologicals. For example, just because orange juice is demonstrated to
provide health a benefit doesn't mean that a company can earn outsized returns by selling
concentrated Vitamin C. For a CBD-based treatment regimen such as Epidiolex, all which
is required for production is low-THC variety marijuana, developed via traditional
horticultural crossbreeding, and some simple drying, crushing, and centrifugal separation
equipment.


Setting aside the current lack of robust scientific evidence that marijuana plant-derived
cannabidiols are actually an effective alternative cure for pediatric treatment-resistant
epilepsy (or better than a placebo treatment), if the products are ever developed for
commercial treatments (no earlier than 2018 as per most sell-side analysts), it appears
GW Pharmaceuticals will have limited pricing power because of the complete lack of

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2034243-gw-pharmaceuticals-high-as-a-kite-and-too-close-to-the-sun 6/39


barriers to entry in the sector. In the unlikely event that Epidiolex successfully completes a
Phase III trial by 2018 and launches for prescription usage, numerous other generic
producers could promptly start selling the same biologicals and undercutting GW's pricing.
In addition, a variety of other biotechnology firms, such as Cara Therapeutics, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CARA) have filed for intellectual property protection of their purported
cannabinoid breakthroughs, so GW Pharmaceuticals' may be accused of infringing on
other firms' intellectual property as it attempts to distribute Sativex and Epidiolex in the
United States.


As Dr. Sanjay Gupta discussed in the recent "Weed" special report on CNN, some parents
are utilizing a variety of non-approved and non-standardized "artisanal" CBD preparations
to purportedly control their children's drug resistant seizures, despite a lack of robust
scientific evidence these treatments are more efficient than a placebo and without fully
understanding the risks of serious psychiatric disorders and long-term cognitive problems
associated with marijuana treatments in children. For example, Ms. Paige Figi, a
housewife with no prior scientific background, currently artisanally produces marijuana-
derived CBD extract for her daughter Charlotte at a cost of less than $800/month.
Shockingly, the current product production competition for a $1bn market capitalization
pharmaceutical company is a hippy housewife working out of her kitchen in Colorado.


With cost control and corresponding changes in treatment reimbursements as the mantra
of the healthcare industry after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, it seems
exceedingly difficult to believe GW Pharmaceuticals will ever be able to charge >$70k per
patient for CBD-derived Epidiolex and capture prescriptions for >9k patients in the United
States and a similar number abroad as currently estimated by sell-side equity analysts.

This financial model by an underwriter of GW Pharmaceutical's prolific equity market
issuances seems to be a prime example of "goal-seek" financial modeling where a sell-
side financial analyst is forced to enter more and more ridiculous assumptions into excel in
an attempt to justify the current market price of the Company's ADS. For example, Infitialis
challenges this sell-side analyst to rationalize their forecast for a massive increase in the
Epidiolex retail price from $40/k per patient per year in 2018 to $76k just four years later in
2022. In the unlikely event Epidiolex completes a successful Phase III trial, it seems likely
United Health, CIGNA, and WellPoint would do everything in their oligopolistic power to
avoid paying for marijuana prescriptions at this price point.


Ridiculous Market Valuation


Even accepting the preposterous sell-side financial model assumptions presented on the
previous page at face value, GW Pharmaceuticals currently trades at a rich 2.2x FY2020
revenue potential and is expected to be EBITDA negative through at least 2017, and this
excludes significant continued shareholder dilution that would occur between now and
2020 and the substantial risk that the Epidiolex Phase III trial will not produce statistically
significant proof of the efficacy of the treatment, especially relative to placebo treatments,
which have an effective cost of $0.00/patient. As of yesterday's close of $57.44/ADS, GW
Pharmaceuticals is currently trading at a market capitalization of $1,098.5mm, for a
shocking valuation of 19.6x LTM revenue and 18.5x P/B despite barely being break-even

on an operating cash flow basis since its reverse-merger formation in 2001. Moreover, the
Company's market valuation has increased 545% since listing of the ADS on the
NASDAQ just 9 months ago.


Additionally, even summing up all the potential milestone payments from commercial
partnership agreements for Sativex, it is only ~$330mm in cumulative total, before further
research and development costs, corporate costs, taxes, and with significant time delay
and execution risk. It is shocking that GW's current market capitalization is more than 3x
these potential milestone payments.


Backdoor Listing onto NASDAQ


Because it would have never passed the due-diligence process of a traditional IPO
process underwritten by a respectable underwriter, GW Pharmaceuticals listed on the
Alternative Investment Market ("AIM") in London in 2001 via a reverse-merger with an
existing shell company. The AIM market is analogous to the OTC market in the United
States because it allows smaller companies to float shares with a "more flexible"
regulatory system than the main London Stock Exchange market. Specifically, the AIM
has reduced disclosure requirements relative to main LSE market, has no requirements
for capitalization or shares issued, and an option for issuers to exempt out of regulatory
requirements by simply notifying the exchange why it has declined to comply. In March

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2034243-gw-pharmaceuticals-high-as-a-kite-and-too-close-to-the-sun 9/39


2007, U.S. SEC regulator Mr. Roel Campos expressed concerns regarding AIM's rules for
share trading and stated "I'm concerned that 30% of issuers that list on AIM are gone in a
year. That feels like a casino to me and I believe that investors will treat it as such." In
addition, AIM has been critiqued for allowing the listing of abject frauds on its exchange,
such as the USD$750mm collapse of Langbar International, which was subsequently
found to possess none of the assets declared at original listing.


After completing its 2001 reverse-merger AIM listing, GW Pharmaceuticals listed its
American Depository Shares on the NASDAQ exchange on 05/01/13 as an "emerging
growth company" under the relaxed regulatory requirements of the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act") at only $8.90/ADS. The irony of a UK
weed company selling equity to its former colonists under a regulatory framework
designed to increase domestic employment would be a humorous anecdote if it did not
present such a clear and present danger to investors. Since completing its ADS listing,
GW benefited as investors bid up its limited float and then the Company raised an
additional $101.1mm on 01/14/14 at $36.00/ADS, despite already having $58.5m in cash
as of 12/31/13.


Massive Shareholder Dilution


GW Pharmaceuticals has been a serial issuer of equity, massively diluting its common
shareholders without significant technological advancement since its reverse-merger
listing on the London AIM exchange in 2001. In addition to secondary offerings, GW
Pharmaceuticals has generously distributed stock options, warrants, and other equity-
linked compensation to insiders since going public to the dilutive determinant of public
investors.


As a result of these multiple equity issuances since GW Pharmaceuticals' reverse-merger
listing on the London AIM exchange in 2001, common shares outstanding have increased
139.8% despite limited scientific advancement and de minimis monetization of the existing

product portfolio. This poor capital planning has been highly dilutive to existing
shareholders and illustrates the management team's history of poor capital allocation
decisions.


In 2009, after several years of Sativex sales and with basically the same product portfolio
as currently under development, GW Pharmaceuticals sold a 5.8% stake in the Company
for $11.2mm for an implied enterprise valuation of $193mm to Great Point Partners, LLC,
a U.S. private equity firm, in an equity and warrants transaction structured by the infamous
underwriters at Rodman & Renshaw, LLC. First, Great Point Partners, LLC appears to
have a history of backing some rather dubious biotech offerings, such as Biodel, Inc.
(BIOD), which went from near triple digits to single digits in less than 18 months from its
IPO in 2007. Great Point Partners had Board of Directors representation in Biodel and
owned 13.7% of the shares outstanding prior to the firm's public offering. Next, Rodman &
Renshaw, LLC, the underwriter of the transaction, filed for liquidation on 09/12/12
following the collapse of a disturbing number of its issuer clients under allegations of
accounting irregularities, embezzlement, and fraud. It appears quite curious that Rodman
& Renshaw's only AIM underwritten offering was for GW Pharmaceuticals.


More recently, on 01/16/14, Great Point elected to exercise 50% of the warrants issued to
the firm in August 2009 for a strike of 0.1p each. The exercise of these warrants further
diluted common shareholders by 1,888,480 new ordinary shares and came at a
significantly higher valuation than that which Great Point Partners had originally bought in.
Finally, Great Point Partners, LLC now has August of this year to exercise its remaining
outstanding warrants for the issuance of an additional 1,888,480 new ordinary shares for a

strike of 0.1p each. Based on Great Point Partners' prior presciently timed moves of
selling out at the top, this seems to be further indication that GW Pharmaceuticals' market
valuation has reached its apex.


Egregious Executive Compensation


GW Pharmaceuticals' annual management compensation has generally exceeded annual
operating income since its reverse-merger formation in 2001. Despite producing Sativex
for ~10 years, GW Pharmaceuticals has consistently been free cash flow negative and
continued to accrue operating income losses. Finally, while public shareholders have been
diluted 139.8% over GW Pharmaceuticals' history as a public company, management and
insider compensation has increased 205.9% during the same period.

Preposterous Sell-Side Analyst Cheerleading


Underwriters of GW Pharmaceuticals' numerous equity market issuances have been
relentless cheerleaders of the "story" since the single digit listing of the ADS last summer.
As the ADS price has rocketed up 545% over the last 9 months, the sell-side analysts
have continually raised their price targets as prior estimates were blown through and
utilized "goal-seek" financial models to justify their current estimates.


For any pharmaceutical company at this stage of its development and with such a limited
product portfolio and revenue potential, it is difficult to imagine it having a market cap of
greater than $100mm. However, "reefer madness" and a lack of understanding regarding
the business model seems to have compelled the equity markets to bid up GW
Pharmaceuticals to a significant multiple of its intrinsic value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2034243-gw-pharmaceuticals-high-as-a-kite-and-too-close-to-the-sun 13/39


Unlike the preposterous sell-side estimates presented above, utilizing more realistic
valuation assumptions for GW Pharmaceuticals implies an intrinsic value in the teens
even in the unlikely upside case the proposed Epidiolex epilepsy treatment is a
blockbusters success. For example, a base case scenario at a 12% discount rate and
utilizing the 19.1mm ADS currently outstanding under the treasury stock method for
options/warrants/etc, GW Pharmaceuticals' intrinsic value is $14.75/ADS with a 50%
probability of Epidiolex successfully being monetized by 2018.


In a bullish upside scenario with full credit for the Epidiolex revenue potential in 2018, the
Company's intrinsic value is only $19.75/ADS. Conversely, under a bearish scenario
where Epidiolex is not successfully monetized, GW Pharmaceuticals' other potential
products in the development pipeline only represent $9.74/ADS of intrinsic value and only

a slight premium to the recent May listing on NASDAQ at $8.90/ADS. Because of GW
Pharmaceuticals' history of cash burn and poor allocation of capital funded by continued
shareholder dilution, there seems to be significant downside between the current ADS
market price and their fundamental intrinsic value.

I posted above. On their Japanese partner Otsuka, who cares? Epidiolex became much more realistic after
things changed. They were granted Orphan status. The author seems to not understand the patents the
company possess and the research that they have done. This is a fantastic company that is years ahead of
its competition with two different tracks on Phase 3 for a novel drug and a rich pipeline. What more can ask
for? Profits??? They will come...

@ Alan,


The chart looks good. I did not read this article. Anything new with GWPH? Mark?


21 Feb 2014, 06:09 PM 


sa_member_756157
Shesh, I agree with you Alan. Something must be wrong..


Actually I couldn't read this article because as a 'report' it was tainted by the 'author's' admission that he
shorted the stock. 
What kind of recommendation can that be other than "hey help me out I am short this stock that's rising but
would like to make money when it goes down!".


As I've said. Beyond that it reads like an exercise in 'what else can we find that seems negative?' and it
doesn't include recent changes or directions in media.


To simply make the claim that these stocks are 'hyped' is too easy. Investors don't want to lose opportunity.
We didn't buy anything expensive in this new sector. Too risky for us anyway. Also its a difficult time for us
generally..

I feel for those (no I don't) who go short GWPH and can't see the massive upside potential. One of the best ideas of
this year IMO.


20 Feb 2014, 11:11 AM 


fascettofe
I disagree with your probabilities of success and with your market size/potential sales estimates. Those are
conservative at best. You can really tell you are short on the stock and have an interest in seeing GWPH fall. Also,
you are judging the stock of a biotech on intrinsic value. Obviously, in biotech and in a new industry dealing with new
products base on cannabinoids, whose total potential benefits we are only beginning to learn and understand, other
factors come to play. Herd mentality does not always have a bad connotation. Sometimes the masses learn all at
once about what is good and feel/experience at once what is desired.

pschkqitzsough
Exactly, every few paragraphs I'm thinking wow I need to address this in comments, but it just kept going and
going with absurd off base points. He talks about it coming from a plant and hard to patent, yet the delivery
system is the main patent which is genius by the way. Also the patent is the ratio of THC to CBD and putting
through clinical trials to prove their products work mean many patients will use this over the raw plant,
especially considering it will likely be easier to get through insurance rather than paying hundreds an ounce
and is much more discreet than smoking or vaporizing could likely be used in public if necessary without
issue.

The author is so implying that Bayer, Otsuka, Almirall and Novartis (no more no less!!!!) didn't realize that this was all
a scam and that "cannabinoids are as good (are as useless, judging by his comments on placebo) as orange juice".

newmedman
Nice article. Way off base, but a good read. You really should look into GW's patent family before you claim that a
company like CARA somehow has a leg up in the IP department...


The flawed research claims are beyond preposterous.


What happens if the DEA reclassifies cannabis extracts, takes them off the street and puts them in the hands of the
Pharmaceutical companies as a schedule 2 narcotic? Would people risk arrest just to make their own medication that
they can get at a pharmacy?


Oh yeah, you should also look into how these formulations are achieved. It takes a hell of a lot more than crushing up
some weed and throwing it into a centrifuge as you stated. 
Perhaps you can read one of GW's many patents on this process sometime. I know I learned a lot...


I dearly hope that you missed your chance to cover on that dip to 52 today....


There might still be time to join Citron in his MDBX short that isn't going so well either..

Where do I begin? I am a paraplegic, with severe spasticity from atrophy. I know people with m.s., and to say that pot
or other marijuana based derivatives don't won't or can't help with this crippling syndrome is ignorant. I'm unclear as
to how you came to the conclusion that the proprietary formulas for the medications this company is creating cannot
be patented, yet there are many companies which have produced medicines from opium poppies, oxycontin,
dilauded, roxycontin, loretab etc, which certainly have been patented! Then you have to realize, these guys are most
likely going to be the first ones through the gate with synthetic cannabinoids. My next point fascettofe has already
touched on, what they sold a stake of the company for in 2009 and what it's worth now are two different things! Do
you think you could valuate lifelock, or google today by what the stock went for in 2009? Huh? Ummmm, no. As a
matter of fact, you can't put a valuation on any of the "pot" companies using classic fundamental analysis because it's
not about where they are, or where they've been, but where they're going. examples; twitter, facebook, tesla, amazon,
etc,etc, 
I don't want to hear. " that's a different sector" because, what does that have to do with a mouse farting on a piece of
cheese in china? The investor sentiment is the same, we believe in the future of these companies. I want to own 1000
shares of every "pot" company and I don't care if three quarters of them go bust. I'll get rich on the quarter that don't.
Drug dealers have been getting rich for years, do you think that people are going to stop buying it all of a sudden? it's
the same price it was when it was illegal. Open your eyes man.

I disagree with the author on many points and see a bright future for this company. I think the biggest flaw of the
author's argument is the stated inability for GW to patent products from plant extracts. My research has determined
that the author is very wrong on this and he probably would not have even written this if he realized the truth. I'm
continuing to research this today.


http://bit.ly/1dSkaUV


Also, just google "patents from plant extracts"


20 Feb 2014, 12:43 PM 


pschkqitzsough
Most medicines are derived from plants.. Opiates are from the poppy plant Oxycontin is actually synthetic
heroin. It is the chemical make-up of heroin created in a lab into pill form.


The author is missing many main points Most importantly, Sativex is coming to the US this year and is being
approved in new countries consistently. Past sales will be irrelevant with millions of new customers opening
up, many would choose this over the plant itself especially for use with insurance etc.


20 Feb 2014, 09:54 PM 


ecceromani
Just had to reply that your comment about Oxycontin being synthetic heroin is complete bunk. They are
related in that they are both opioids but Oxycontin is oxycodone and heroin is diacetylmorphine - look at
diagrams of their structures and you will see differences. They are both semi-synthetic compounds derived
from opium but each from different alkaloids (oxycodone from thebaine and diacetylmorphine from heroin).

Did you know that Otsuka paid for the development of Epidiolex for the six years ended 30th June 2013 for which it
had joint ownership rights with GWPH. At the end of that period Otsuka decided not to continue to fund any further
research on GEPH's non sativex drugs and in Sept 2013 gave back their half share of the rights to GWPH for nothing,
zero, nada. 5 months on and the value of what they gave back is $1b. Did Otsuka make a huge mistake or have US
investors been sold a pup. You decide. But also bear in mind that Otsuka knows way more about GWPH than
anybody. They are the US Sativex licensees after all.

Just as so many people clearly missed the boat regarding the value of cannabidiol and CBDV in epilepsy, many seem
to be making the same mistake once again with their failure to see cannabinoids potential in other therapeutic areas
such as glioma, psychiatry, diabetes, and inflamation disorders. I predict it will be those indications in the pipeline that
will suprise to the upside in a dramatic way just like the epilepsy data already has. The author failed to value the
pipeline. There will be loads of clinical results hitting the news over the next year and beyond which should have
shorts covering in fear.


The markets that the pipeline targets are massive and there is massive demand demand for SAFE alternatives to our
current rx meds that often have awful side effects. Even if cannabis based medicines aren't the most efficacious, they
will likely have the best side effect profile.


Any company wishing to capitalize off GW's r&d efforts over the last 15 years by producing a "generic" will be in for a
rude awaking when they discover they will need to conduct all the same clinical trials GW did or wait until their patents

Medicinal opioids such as Tramadol are a billion dollar industry. They will be replaced by non addictive CBD. Its as
simple as that.


20 Feb 2014, 03:29 PM

Tramadol is a weak analgesic, and would not be missed by patients if it disappeared. We physicians
prescribe it mainly for our own convenience, in that it is not a controlled substance.


My question to bazmanblue is this: can you cite any references to clinical studies in which the purported
analgesic properties of CBD are quantified, or compared head-to-head with a true opioid analgesic?

Dean Chaykowski, Contributor
or better yet some actual counters to the arguments made in the article


20 Feb 2014, 05:19 PM 


remix20
Kuala, no problemo! The largest flaw in the author's reasoning as I see it:


"GW Pharmaceuticals' main products are derived from a natural plant extract, it cannot patent its products and there
are basically no barriers to other firms extracting and selling the same biologicals."


My link would not work here but look into GW's currently applied for patents as well as already existing drugs based
on MJ such as Sativex and Marinol.


Secondly, he severely underestimates the value of what I believe continued scientific research will reveal to be
significant medical benefits to be derived from the cannabis plant.


Final note: The US Gov't already holds a patent on medicinal qualities of CBD's although I cannot comment on how
this will affect other developed drugs. I can tell you that it makes the current schedule 1 status of marijuana an
astounding hypocrisy!

20 Feb 2014, 05:56 PM 


Dean Chaykowski, Contributor
Good point on the patents! I was thinking he was making a good point on that score while reading his
analysis.


To your second point, I agree as well. Although I'm going to also add that a whole lot of people that use the
illegal drug like what it does for them too, without much research that has been sadly missing.

Let's start with GWPH does have a patent, several in fact. Then there is the fact that when Cannabis was legal
worldwide 70+ years ago, companies like Merck had a whole plant medicinal extract of Cannabis
(tincture:Water/alcohol based) that was for sale mainly pre-penicillin late 1800's along side all those that could grow or
acquire cannabis on their own. I could go on and on but suffice to say this is what GW Pharma discovered and it says
on their web page: "Evidence emerged that the endocannibinoid system when transiently activated restores
homeostasis." Translation: it is the endocannibinoid system that regulates whole body processes. We can interact
with and temporarily activate the endocannbinoids in our bodies when we have inflammation, i.e. illnesses like
arthritis, heart conditions, cancer,...and endocannbinoids control endocrine functions, skeletal, cerebral, nervous,
respiratory, and can be activated by way of ingesting or inhaling cannabis. GWPH is making endocannibinoids drugs
out of the whole plant by scientifically extracting and then making it for medicinal use....virtually the same product as
was available 100 years ago...but here is the key difference. They have mapped out the endocannabinoid system and
how the different receptors react to different cannabinoids such as THC , CBD, CBDV, and many more. So GW
Pharma has the science of the proper ratios to make cannabis drugs that specifically target ailments based on the
endocannibinoid needed to help regulate the body to normal. Who do you think the majority of modern day
parents/patients are going to go to or use to properly treat their ailment that could even be life threatening? A pharma
co like GWP, who through a doctor is going to prescribe the exact medicine needed per ailment? Or are they going to
trust some random guy on the corner,dispensary or someone without true exacting and precise science that may or
may not have consistent product unlike GWP which does and is scientifically proven and has FDA approval? His
motivation for the article is money, as he admits he is shorting. My motivation is money, but it is truly secondary to this
fact: GWPH has the potential to truly revolutionize the entire pharmaceutical industry with safe, non toxic
endocannabinoid medications that will usurp at least 50% of the entire pharmaceutical market. This next ten to twenty
years expect to see an entire upheaval in the pharma industry to plant based drugs that have been around for
thousands of years and now we are using native remedies and old school medicine combined with modern day
science as it is going to be a win win for us all. It is very timely considering all the negative press about the toxic and
serious side affects of pharmaceuticals. GW Pharma, short and long term is a good investment, but not just for your
and my bottom line, not just for the almighty dollar, but for the good of all humanity moving forward and that is fact not
hype or spin.

The NYT op-ed piece was directed towards federal deregulation of MJ for lab study purposes. The progress to date
shows positive results in CBD /neuro applications. This attack on the stock run-up rings of regret by someome who

20 Feb 2014, 08:27 PM 


Pentech
Gasbag82 - no not a secret at all - but equally not spelled out to American investors either. GWP (the English
company) did a deal with Otsuka in June 2007 whereby Otsuka funded pretty much all of GWP's non Sativex R&D for
3 years, which of course included Epidiolex. In return for paying out all the R&D monies Otsuka got 50% of the
ongoing rights on all products resulting from the work. In June 2010 the deal was renewed for another 3 years on the
same terms. In June 2013 Otsuka said that they did not wish to renew the deal again and under the terms of the deal
had 3 months to agree with GWP who would get what and for how much. In September 2013 Otsuka returned all
rights to GWP for nothing. All public information readily available in the British company accounts and statements.
When GWP then floated off on Nasdaq this story was kept pretty quiet, which is why people like you don't know that
Otsuka thought that Epidiolex wasn't worth anything. Suddenly a doctor in SF says that 2 kids using Epidiolex have
had a 90% reduction in fits and the company is worth $1b.


Well some may say that a company whose Sativex, 3 years after launch, sells less than $2m per quarter because it's
efficacy is highly questionable - nothing should be taken for granted.

Well, unless I can see something in writing from a reputable source, I have to conclude it's hearsay. Even if
true, there is nothing to prevent a mistake by Otsuka, or a bit of subterfuge by GW in dealings with Otsuka. I
find it difficult to believe though, that Otsuka would discard rights to Epidiolex, which is CBD, for no
consideration whatsoever. Why on earth would they do such a thing when research shows CBD to be an
effective nervous system anti inflammatory? If they did what you claim, someone in Tokyo will be given his
sword for the Seppuku should Epidiolex prove effective.

From Bloomberg 19 July 2013 
"Diabetes, though, is just one of many diseases that GW is taking aim at. It‚Äôs developing a pot-based medication to
treat inflammation in ulcerative colitis, and is working with Otsuka Pharmaceutical (4578:JP) of Japan on a drug that
could treat epilepsy. The company also is carrying out further studies on the MS drug Sativex that could lead to its use
for treating pain in cancer patients."


Under the research agreement in June 2010 Otsuka only had to pay GW $12m over 3 years. So in June 2013 they
could have continued the agreement for presumably a similar sum and kept their half share of the rights to Epidiolex.
They chose not to even though the promising results from Reading University had been published. Looks like a big
mistake on their part - or maybe not.

From GWP website


London, UK; 13 September 2012 GW pharmaceuticals (LSE:GWP ‚ÄúGW‚Äù) is pleased to note the University of
Reading‚Äôs press release, reproduced below, announcing the publication in the peer-reviewed journal The British
Journal of Pharmacology (1) of promising data from studies on cannabidivarin (CBDV), a largely ignored natural
compound found in cannabis that could lead to better treatments for epilepsy. This work was funded by, and
performed in collaboration with, GW and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Otsuka). Further commentary on this paper
can also be found in New Scientist (2).


In July 2007 GW and Otsuka signed a global cannabinoid research collaboration that currently runs to the end of June
2013. Under this agreement, GW and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals research a range of GW cannabinoids as potential
new drug candidates in the field of Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders and oncology.


Dr Stephen Wright, R&D director at GW Pharmaceuticals said: ‚ÄúThese results further underscore the potential of
naturally-derived cannabinoids as medicines to treat a broad range of diseases. GW has established a track record of
discovering and commercialising such compounds with Sativex¬Æ now on the market for treating spasticity associated
with multiple sclerosis and in late stage development for the treatment of cancer pain. Our research into CBDV has
consistently produced highly promising results demonstrating its potential as a novel anticonvulsant and GW hopes
during 2013 to advance CBDV into human clinical trials.‚Äù

GWP CEO 9 July 2013  
"The Otsuka research agreement did indeed expire on 30 June. The agreement provides for a period of 3 months for
further discussions about next steps. From this point forward, GW holds exclusive worldwide rights to products
developed under the collaboration, unless agreed otherwise. If there is any new information in due course, we will of
course issue a further announcement."


Question to CEO 22 October 2013 
"The Epilepsy drug that has caused all the recent excitement seems to have stemmed from the Otsuka research so
they returned the rights to you on a drug that a few months later has everyone excited with the one analyst saying it's
the most promising drug he's ever seen and values the ADRs at $65. Clearly Otsuka must have taken a somewhat
different view. Any thoughts as to why Otsuka let it go?"


Answer from CEO 23 October 2013 
"Re Otsuka, I can offer little insight into their decision making process but we are obviously pleased to have full
ownership of such an exciting programme." 


21 Feb 2014, 05:14 PM 


gasbag82
Thank you for your considerable efforts. This certainly gives me something to think about. 
" So in June 2013 they could have continued the agreement for presumably a similar sum and kept their half
share of the rights to Epidiolex." 
We don't know (presumably) what GW was asking for to renew the agreement. Maybe that is the issue. I
frankly have no idea how these agreements are written. Otsuka is already committed to a $220 million or so
milestone payment if Sativex is approved for cancer pain. It's possible they are risk averse and viewed
Epidiolex as having a poor risk reward ratio. If Epidiolex is only used for intractable pediatric epilepsy, it will
have a very small market. Of course the real value is in having ANY cannabis based drug FDA approved and
in use - never mind for kids! All the legal barriers will be removed - unless Obama hasn't already issued the
necessary orders to the DOJ long before.  
So I do thank you for educating me (and presumably others) to this issue. I didn't really need another reason
to fret though. I think GWPH is what my late father would refer to as "a rank speculation".

Dr Raphael Mechoulam, who you mentioned in your article in a far outdated study from almost 40 years ago, is
quoted is Jack Herer's book claiming that in 20 years Cannabis will replace 50% of pharmaceutical market drugs with
Cannabinoids based drugs. Although the US military chemical weapons program first isolated and synthesized the
THC molecule nearly 15 years prior, Mechoulam first isolated/discovered the THC molecule in 1964. He currently
works for GW Pharma.

Gasbag - the struggles on efficacy that GW have had with Sativex don't fill me with optimism for the prospects for
cancer pain. Not many people are enthused with the efficacy for MS spasticity (hence the poor sales in the three
years since launch) and they failed in the phase 3 neuropathic pain trial and the phase 2 cancer pain trial, even
though GW/Otsuka elected to continue with three phase 3 cancer pain trials. They failed on MS spasticity originally
but after they devised a further trial that virtually guaranteed success they managed to get it approved. I note that the
third cancer pain trial has been devised on a similar basis but whether the FDA will be quite as impressed as their
European counterparts with a self-devised trial if they fail on the first two is open to question. Lots of questions eh!?


23 Feb 2014, 09:30 AM 


gasbag82
My perspective is different than yours. 1st, select cannabinoid formulations ARE efficacious for a number of
indications, largely a result of the anti inflammatory effect. As I live in Colorado, I have personal experience
with MS patients and cancer patients using cannabis. The truly professional dispensaries here are all offering
a lab tested 1:1 ratio (THC/CBD) strain of cannabis. The demand is great and it is often unavailable. "Stoners"
do not buy it (not much "high" to it). I have talked to the owners of the dispensaries and they all know of
Sativex. There is a 1:20 ratio strain (originally named R4) that has a long wait list. It is only available for
children with severe epilepsy. Maybe all these patients are wrong and the bureaucrats are right. Could be a
mass placebo effect. The irony is thick. Low people in high places continue to spew lies and erect obstacles
to this harmless gift from nature, while encouraging the development of various poisons with little or no value.
Lawsuits follow. The FDA and DEA have delayed and obstructed all efforts to allow use of cannabis for any

I buy from MJNA (realscientifichempoil). It is insanely expensive but its the highest quality and highest
concentration of CBD I could find. It is made specifically from a rich CBD strain of hemp plant and has
extremely small amounts of THC in it which is why it is legal. I was wary at first, but my mother swears by it.
She stopped taking all pain and nausea medication and is taking CBD oil in pill form twice a day. I don't know
how long this will last but so far about 6 weeks she has been going great. One of the reasons I really like
GWPH is because I know this stuff works wonders, but I am very weary about the patent issue and how you
can basically just grow this stuff yourself or get generic versions from other companies. Definitely making me
think twice about investing.

Pentech, can you share where you found the info regarding the trials and stages? Cannabis is second to none in
terms of neuropathic pain relief, actually pain in general, but that's another debate...if Sativex is failing for neuro pain
then the formulation is weak and or the wrong ratios, not because Cannabis is weak at mitigating neuropathic pain.

London Stock Exchange, not a dealer network. As for dilution, it doesn't matter if you're currently sitting on gains
approaching 300%, as some of us are. GW is a brilliant example of biotechnology; the extraction processes are
advanced chem eng at its best; the marketing and PR are excellent; and judges I know love it for moving medical
marijuana into the regulated sector, especially as you can't get high from either Sativex or Epidiolex, a major point
with the latter, where the main market is among stricken children.

i have never viewed GWPH as a MJ stock - more a Biotech. I've been long since $8.


The number of country approvals keeps increasing - though the article is biased as it calls them 'minor countries ' -
and omits to say the UK, Canada, Australia, Spain, Italy, Germany are actually G7 Nations.


Submissions are awaiting approval in France and Ireland which pretty much ties up the EU - a market bigger than the
US.


I think short this stock at your peril - each quarter brings positive data results, increased approvals, new distribution
deals and wider product ranges, and the last cash raise at $36 hardly touched the stock price.

Yes, seems like they made a big mistake, on the other hand they still have rights on Sativex, right? But if Morgan

outlook for trial results which come out this year. I think advanced cancer pain is the one with the biggest
opportunity/market. It's just beautiful to invest in a company which might cure a lot of diseases with a "plant-based"

I am in chemistry in college currently...yes at 52. I have also researched thc and its molecular structure and took that
knowledge and researched GW's website and others in regards to the science of Cannabis and the molecules it has,
primarily THC and CBD. Science fact. THC and the way it works in terms of consuming the whole plant, binds to
neuro receptors and not only protects them and the brain as a whole, but it actually repairs damaged neurons. Think
NFL....Cannabis, even smoking does NOT harm the undeveloped brain. It cannot. Why? How can a molecule that
repairs brain damage and protects neurons from inflammation be detrimental to the developing brain? You already
have the answer in the factual statement that is actual science. It repairs and protects. So youth even smoking...non
issue. And where am I going with this? When GWP comes out with their cannibinoid drug that does in fact kill brain
cancer, already proven by science, how much is the stock worth then? And yes CAnnabis kills ALL cancers, because
of its mode of mechanism of the THC molecule. A CUre for cancer SO again...how much is something like that worth?

"Evidence emerged that the endocannbinoid system, when transiently activated restores homeostasis". Translation: it
regulates the body to normal. Bob Marley most likely smoked cannabis, didn't eat. Smoking is medicine with only a
10% benefit of treating after the fact, while the majority of benefit of the plant is as a preventative. Although Smoking,
eating, inhaling, etc. all have benefits...like... Cannabis mitigates Anandamide degradation. It also creates new grey
matter in the brain as well as protects neurons. It was used for women in labor throughout history with great success
and NO detriment to child or mother. Also research Roots daughters. A female physician from the US did a govt
funded study in Jamaica. She studied Rasta communities side by side in with non Cannabis consuming communities.
The results showed a 3% higher IQ for babies born to women who consume, smoke, eat cannabis daily all day while
pregnant. The results were also monitored later in childhood development. It showed the children were overall
healthier and better able to adapt to society and the community among other positive results. I also thoroughly
researched Merck's Medica Materia a book, pre penicillin, for physicians on every physicians desk from 1898 and it
alone gives an amazing tale of what Cannabis was safely and effectively used for 100 years ago. I did look all of this
up on the net, but I went a step further, because today with the net we have a lot of BS along with a lot of skeptics. So
I did what I had done as a child of 8 when I rode my bike half mile away to the library to see if UFO's were real. One
pic of a garbage can lid tied to a wire and....trust me I am way more cynical than most will EVER be. :) So I have seen
the actual books, like the original Merck's Medica Materia from 1898 at my college library at Western Oregon
University and many more books at libraries in person. AM I a doctor NO. I do not have any degree, but I was and still
am in many ways far ahead of Sanjay Gupta, Neuroscientist of Indian Origin who, if he researched just a small part of
his ancestry, would have learned the Gupta named was instrumental in Medicine in India, particularly Ayurvedic and
Cannabis applications which were empirically studied for centuries and documented. I knew 3 years ago that
Cannabis is healthy, even smoking,because of what it is actually doing. Sanjay Gupta found out two years later? Here
is what maybe the greatest contradiction even after all I have claimed. IMO there is a lot of placebo taking place with
Cannabis use, but there is also a world of benefit gained by consuming it mostly before but even after being ill. As far
as Cannabis curing all cancers...it is true but your statement about Bob Marley is a generalization that doesn't show
causation and here is why. Smoking has minimal benefits especially to areas further away from the head. Bob Marley
had melanoma, the most aggressive and lethal type of cancer and it was first noticed on his toe. I wouldn't be
surprised if his doctors told him to stop smoking, but it wouldn't have mattered. He would to have to have THC applied
directly to the area, the skin...taken it in high concentrations orally to mitigate the Metastasis in the blood...even then
without the science we have today it would have been tough to cure him of it. What I am trying to get my head around
is how did some scientists at universities who have doctorates in chem and bio didn't put two and two together. How
did they not or do they not take a relatively simple molecule and structure like THC and not make the connection to
what it does in terms of human bio chemistry. There are many who must know what THC does on a molecular level,
the bonds it forms with the amide...amand AMIDE or at least they do now, including Gupta. And we are correlating
organic chemistry to bio chemistry in my chemistry courses. Oh, by the way I have a landscape business and have
gotten poison oak on several occasions. One time I took some fresh cannabis leaf and salve and rubbed it on the
rash. The itch got worse for ten minutes then mitagated. The next day the rash and itch were gone. That had never
happened before when I had poison oak and in some cases the rash was so bad I had to take steroids. Some
ailments can be placeboed away....an obvious rash from poison oak cannot. I was able to repeat the above several
times in the past two years. Wait...many will be shocked what Cannabis can actually do.

I actually applaud the author for his work against the herd. There is so much cheerleading going on its hard to analyze
risk. However, as an investment decision, the author should have known that without short-term financial deadlines to
fulfill, it was foolish to short the herd, when there is such a coupling between stock price, demand, and what is
occurring in the world. Maybe as a long term strategy it would be fine, but short term I feel it shows an (expensive)
misunderstanding of social dynamics.


However just because you are short does not give you the logical license to make a case against cannabinoid
receptors in general. While "In My Opinion" is thrown around these days so often, it does NOT allow one to declare
what nature does. If you have ever been high, you will be immediately aware that cannabinoids have a variety of
strong and so-far unexplained effects on the body. Your skin can feel very warm and comfortable, food may taste
unbelievable, you might get anxious, or you might feel serene, your skin can feel like its burning, your allergies might
flare up, you might get thirsty, you can get cold.


These are an extraordinary number of effects, and what is more bizarre is that different strains are associated with a
different set of these feelings. This clearly indicates that cannabinoid receptors are


1) Associated with neurons in the brain 
2) Associated with neurons throughout the entire peripheral nervous system 
2) Associated with inflammatory response and the immune system


While some of these effects are medically relevant to different conditions, patients are having a difficult time reliably
selecting which effects they want while removing the ones they don't. This represents a multi-billion dollar market
inefficiency in the medical marijuana market, caused primarily by un-controlled breeding, measurement of
cannabinoids, and tracking of genetics. GWPH's promise lies in correcting this inefficiency. Since any novel mixture of
naturally occuring substances can be patented, the question is really "does GWPH have the smarts, technology, and
equipment to intelligently select these mixtures?"

jortiz, exactly, that is why even as a grower and consumer of cannabis I am invested in GWPH. They have the
exacting science behind it to more precisely target specific receptors per cannabinoid applied in the form they derive.

""Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their
senses slowly, and one by one." Nearly 200 years later, these words are still relevant as even nowadays men find it
difficult to act against the herd while the herd goes mad."


When I first read this I might have assumed that the article was related to a treatment for BSE in cattle.


Apparently not. I think this quotation is very patronising. As far as I can see the herd has done a lot better research
than the writer. There are a number of assertions in the article which are factually incorrect [e.g. on the patents] or
written in a selective & tendentious style. What purpose is served by such "infotantment"? I appreciate that if the
author acted very swiftly he would have made a quick buck when the shares briefly touched US$52 - but the author
has done no favours to those who went short & stayed short - nor to his own reputation for doing proper research. As
they say, once bitten twice shy. Could take a long time before Infitialis rebuilds any following imo

A further comment on the "herd" stuff. Great to be a contrarian - so long as you are right. If not then nothing worse
than getting trampled by the herd.

Well glad I didn't go short on this, yikes. SeekingAlpha can't beat the banks even if SA is right. You could make similar
arguments against EGLT, but pretty soon all the bulges will be covering it and that'll sky-rocket too, it already is
creeping up

WEED2 documentary on CNN last night demonstrated the political movement to remove MJ from schedule 1 list
(Congressman Kennedy). Once the feds clear the decks, GWPH research will be full speed ahead towards FDA
approvals. Dr. Devinsky and his NYU team should be permitted to broaden the scope of their testing , once given
access to raw materials needed to formulate proper dosages.

GW also announced that the Intellectual Property Office in the United Kingdom has granted a patent for the use of
CBDV in the treatment of epilepsy, patent number GB2479153B. The subject patent covers the use of CBDV alone or
in combination with standard anti-epileptic drugs or in combination with other cannabinoids, and provides an
exclusivity period until 30 March 2030. This same patent is currently in prosecution with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office.

In the end, it's about earnings. I was long from about 62 to 78, and now short. The hype is/was intoxicating, but the
reality is earnings. Everyone needs to forget about the promises, and focus on reality.

I have bought and sold this stock as GWP in the UK many times since the first IPO in 2001. I last sold on the way up
a month ago and now have no position. Infitialis was right - IMHO this is about hype with no real substance. The
current pattern is just repeating what happened in the UK in 2001 following the original IPO on the AIM market. The
stock rose dramatically driven by huge interest surrounding this 'legal cannabis' product and its apparent potential to
around 200+ pence. It then progressively declined to sub 30p in 2009 as the commercialisation failed to deliver
serious revenue except through licensing income. With the NASDAQ listing the hype has started again and the stock
has risen in the last 7 months from 50p to a peak of 416p with GWPH following along. As reality sets in once again we
now have a fall of 35% in two weeks . The current valuation makes no sense to me at all and I am staying clear until
there is some stability and real evidence of commercial progress.

Anyone have price targets for when the drop will be over? Thinking 35-40$ would be a nice entry? Really like this
stock but don't want to try and catch a falling knife.

I tried to catch this falling knife at $62 like a week ago...I have no idea how deep this pullback is gonna be.

currently testing $48 floor, GWPH being dragged down with the rest of the sector (excepting MNTR). The story of this
company hasn't changed, it is perceived as a BIO on the Naz, if you think it gets FDA nod, looks to be an entry level
here... 
subject to change as market conditions fluctuate, of course.

Infitialis - great research and article. Hope you have the deep pockets or structured your trade to wait this through! Or
took your profits already. Any comment on the follow-on offering at the end of this month? To be honest, my
background is not in finance so I'm working to understand the structuring of it. The ~1.2 million american depository
shares being offered by the company on NASDAQ will have what overall dilutive effect, given that each ADS is 12
common shares on the LSE? Just 8%? Or is it less, given that it trades on two exchanges? Anyone? 
Might play up the momentum on this with a vertical call. The media hype is hysterical. Cramer is touting a new cancer
drug, when what he means is a new pain medication facing serious regulatory headwinds.

check the patent that GW Pharma filed for brain cancer a few months back ( Dec 2013 I think). I know Sativex
is the cancer pain drug, but check this out, a clip from the GW website:


Glioma


Numerous reports state that cannabinoids inhibit the viability of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivoi,ii via
apoptosis or programmed cell death, and may also affect angiogenesis. One research group has established
that the antiproliferative effects of CBD in multiple glioma cell lines was caused by a dramatic decrease in
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. This could be blocked by antagonism of the CB2 receptor and the effect
correlated with the rate of cell death observed in the tumour linesiii. The group then went on to demonstrate
that CBD also had the capability of preventing migration of tumour cells and therefore the ability for the
cancer to metastasize. This effect could not be blocked by antagonists of either CB1 or CB2 receptors
demonstrating that it is a non-CB receptor dependant mechanismiv.

The insiders selling a large chunk of their holdings at nearly 20% below current market price is kind of
concerning....especially before the approval of anything by the FDA. If they were so confident, they would wait to sell.


24 Jun 2014, 03:53 AM 


Stephan Botzki, Contributor
I was thinking about that too. But after those trial results I can't sell. Maybe they just want to sell at a fix price
instead of making a trading plan. Now they get paid all at once.


24 Jun 2014, 12:15 PM 


TheScottMarket, Contributor
Ended up not being 20% below, original release said $77 I thought, and it ended up at $86 or so right? So not as bad
as originally stated. I wonder if SAC kept their short open?


27 Jun 2014, 02:29 AM 


Stephan Botzki, Contributor
Yes $86, they did put the last trading price in the first prospect, but at the same time said that the price may
vary and that the buyer of the shares has to choose in a timeframe of about 2 weeks if I remember correctly.  
Any information who bought those 1.7mio shares?? Much be confident to buy sucha huge amount on $86

I had a position in TRTC last week and sold this week after I checked the 2013 results. Shame on me I just
made a quick overview last weeek but got out +-0 on it. They issue way too many convertibles, warrants and
prefered stocks. This dilutes the stock more and more and management said by itself that it is questionable if
the company can ever earn money and that they wont stay liquid if they cant issue more dept in form of

stay long on my GWPH/GWP which is making more and more progressin trials and secondary offerings.

Bravo! As a physician, I have long held these marijuana-based therapies to be suspect - there appears to be a
political agenda biasing the results of the so-called research favoring the use of cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals.


Open-label studies, like those reported for Epidiolex, are worthless. In addition to a lack of randomization and no
blinding or placebo control, the seizure rates were determined by the observations of the desperate, untrained
parents. The American Academy of Neurology should be censured for allowing this phoney data to be presented at
their meeting. The Sativex studies conducted by GW Pharmaceuticals were also highly suspicious in their design. I
am not a professional investor - how do I bet against this company's stock? I have heard the term "shorting" used in
this context, and also the phrase "put options".

I bought this at ~$2 years ago and was patient. Sativex may not help cancer pain but Epidiolex has gotten
some good results, and the company is starting the double blind study that is needed for some very difficult
epilepsy syndromes.


The shorts may pile on and drive the price down but long term I think they have some very interesting
prospects. The analyst at Piper ( Schimmer ?, who is an MD) thinks that the cannabinoids may hold promise
for autism and the company has not even mentioned insomnia ( a 20 BILLION US opportunity) or anxiety.


Different perspectives are the reason we have art auctions and stock markets. Good regards.

I appreciated his technical instructions, but his closing salutation of "rotsa ruck!" seemed to hold some kind of
cryptic meaning. The problem with capitalizing on the collapse of a bubble is predicting the timing. If the
epilepsy drug performs well under strict double-blinded placebo-controlled and randomized conditions, then it
probably is the real thing. The problem for this stock is described well in this article: one cannot defend a
patent on this medication. "Rotsa ruck", indeed!
