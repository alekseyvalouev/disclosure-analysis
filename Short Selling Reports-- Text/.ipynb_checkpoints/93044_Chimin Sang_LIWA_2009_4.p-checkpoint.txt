8/9/22, 7:29 AM Motley Fool as Contrarian Signal _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/179057-motley-fool-as-contrarian-signal?source=all_articles_title 2/11


In the universe of stocks I monitor, I inevitably hold negative opinions of some names.
Recently I observed an increasing number of positive headline news from Motley Fool
pumping these stocks. Nearly all the headline news employ very little detailed analysis,
but rely on some stock screens and/or "CAPS rating", a rating from a supposedly
145,000 member community.  


In my view, such a big community is not a guarantee of accuracy. Quite oppositely, no
stock market truth can be farther away from the aggregated view of such a 145,000
member community. Maybe we should use Motley Fool as a contrarian signal. 


In the past month, Motley Fool produced a jaw-dropping 10 headlines for Fuqi
International (OTCPK:FUQI), a Chinese jewelry manufacturer. During this period, the
stock went from $20 to $22 and then to $18 at the close of last Friday. I will not be a
buyer for Fuqi here. In the last earning report, Fuqi had an irregular item to boost
revenue and showed little progress in its expansion into the retail market. The stock was
reduced from $23 to $19 after its Nov 9 earning report. In my view, Fuqi now has the
famous 'first cockroach' problem. Behind the first cockroach you spot in your kitchen,
there is a happy family of cockroaches.  


Lihua International (LIWA) is another example. I wrote plenty on this company's
problems already. This company has an unusually short DSO, unusually high assets
turnover, and an unusual cash-on-delivery revenue collection practice. The company,
we understand from its books, may very well exist only on the books. But surely it is a
four star stock in the view of Motley Fool members. 95% of the 117 members who
expressed an opinion thought it would outperform the S&P. Why? They are looking at
the growth numbers, and the stock momentum. Someone will surely hold pretty flowers
when the music stops. Many investors deplore the greed of Wall Street, but it is their
very own greed that makes the greed of Wall Street ever possible. 


So much for Motley Fool today. I suggest my readers keep caution of Motley Fool's
recommendations. If your stock is loved by the mob, it is time to look elsewhere.  


Disclosure: No Position in FUQI, Short LIWA

nice call on FUQI....a tell there is that whole GAAP numbers looked fine for '09, FUQI was
solidly cash flow negative for the year.

Author's Reply But Bill, the switch to the retail model can explain the cash flow
negative. If you had bought into their retail business model, which seemed a bought
idea by the market last year, you would be fine with the negative cash flow. You
might feel uncomfortable with this out of you style, but I actually was okay with that. I
was blind for a while that I bought the retail story, until ODM completely disgusted
me. Relatively speaking the management is not too bad. In my view, they made silly
miscalculations of the situation, but they are not yet criminals.

Author's Reply 1. ODM is an irregular item; we have never heard this item before the last
earning call. 
2. Without ODM, the revenue is a miss 
3. If without ODM, the revenue is a beat, then ODM is a nice-to-have and a positive item.  
4. If revenue is a beat only with the addition of ODM, the ODM becomes a suspicious item,
a made-up to make the revenue expectation.  
5. To get a good picture of a firm, you have to remove the irregular item. When removing the
irregular item, we find this company a miss quarter.


The above logic is proven by the price action following the earning report.

Thank you, I wish I had heeded your advice. I have been severely chastised by the
market after the accounting fraud that was admitted to in preliminary 4Q earnings
yesterday, and now i have a paper loss that I am considering realizing before it gets
worse.

Please explain why you consider rising ODM to be the "first cockroach?" I certainly hope to
find a swarm of ODM deals at FUQI, ODM is higher margin than traditional wholesale.
Furthermore ODM is less risky because it frees FUQI from some of the risk that gold and
platinum prices might crater. If the buyer supplies the metal than FUQI has to stock less raw
material and is less exposed if precious metal prices go south. I can't think of a single
downside to ODM deals. If that's the "first cockroach" then let's spread honey all over the
place and turn out the lights, hopefully more will come out of hiding.

Dear Xie Xie,


I will say these comments reflect the fact that US investor community has not been well
communicated with operations and stories of some China companies.


Different angles of view should exist to let not only investors but also management to
understand views of the Street. Positive messages are nice but negative messages drive
improvement.

Chiming,


Your commentary is worse than the guy who pointed out the issues at CSKI, which went
from $12 to $20+. Thanks for creating a huge buying opportunity for me on LIWA, I really
appreciate it. I know what fraud is and this company's numbers are not a fraud.


Your proported work though is that of a fraud or a slanderer and you better hope there is
fraud at this company, which I doubt, or it will be your name and reputation labeled to this
stock as the man to tried speculate from a distance without doing his homework.


No doubt the attention will now be put to the numbers on this company. Let's see how they
play out in the coming quarters. My bet is this stock is much, much higher than now and I
am putting my money where my mouth is; not babbling about it. I understand accounting.
My first advice to this company is to step up to another auditor so no-money investing
'bloggers', like yourself, can't push around a company who is employing people and honestly
working.


Chiming, you have no idea how much this company had been vettted by the community and
your work here is JV at best. Your commentary on the Seeking Alpha site is an
embarrassment to their reputation.

Completely disagree with your "analysis" of Fuqi. Everyone seems to miss the fact that EPS
was still great compared to what analysts were projecting. Also, the fact that management
excludes ODM from it's calculations of future value, while still maintaining their projections,
shows that they have confidence Q4 will be different then Q3.


Futhermore, Fuqi is trading at a PE ratio much much lower than it's competitors, and has
some great fundamental characteristics of which include: 
*a great ROE of over 20% 
*great earnings growth. 
*and a cheap valuation


I think it'll be clear by the end of Q1 2010 that the mob mentality has pushed Fuqi down
much more than it should be.

The CAPS system has been up for several years now, and I have still never seen any
research on its predictive value. Since they obviously know its predictive value, and would
have an incentive to publish the knowledge if it were goood, I'm inclined to be cynical about
the (ominous) silence..... I'm also skeptical about my own CAPS account. I've almost always
had a rating over 95, but I'm pretty sure my picks have lost money. (I have the same ID
there as here, so feel free to check it). The rating system has the following problems, 1)
purely relative to the S&P, no measure of absolute return at all, and 2) time doesn't seem to
be a factor; how can you measure investment return without using time as a factor? The
rating is just based on accuracy and size of outperformance. It is also certainly tedious too
see them spamming Yahoo Finance incessantly. I would never subscribe to MF.

walking you through the process. Their major flaw, as many painfully know, was pushing
"buy and hold". Now it's basically the equivalent of spam when I'm scanning headlines on

Motley fool used to be one of my favorite sites. I learned a lot from those guys about
analyzing stocks. The fool ratio is a great way to find pitfalls in a company. There
discussions on Cash return, free cash flow, etc... were also great. The education portion of
the site is extremely week now versus 1999 -2002. Since the beginning I've noticed however
that when it comes to stock recommendations they rarely practice what they preach. They
preach value stock picking but they recommend almost entirely growth stocks. For a breif
period I got tired of doing my research and bought some of their newletter to help me make
picks. The picks I got from them didn't do well at all and really crushed my portfolio for a few
years. I completely ignore them now. I'd also say that there newletters basically amount to a
pep rally. There analysis is more of an extended sales pitch versus a real in depth analysis.
Their portfolios have only done well because a few outstanding picks. So you'd better buy
every single stock they recommend or you simply won't duplicate their results. I rarely go to
their site now. Pay or non pay articles are very week.

I've noticed this about them as well, but going way farther back - for me it was as far back as
the early 90's, when I had occasion to converse with one of the principles. I noticed a
distinct lack of interest in potential negatives, not something I would tolerate in an advisor,
financial or otherwise.
