Lumber Liquidators Is Evil
Mar. 23, 2015 8:50 AM ET246 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Lumber Liquidators is knowingly endangering the health and safety of its customers,
especially children, by continuing to sell toxic Chinese-made laminate.


The only word to describe this is evil.


Please sign a petition calling on the company to stop selling this laminate.


On its web site, it’s falsely assuring its customers that this laminate is “100% safe”.


The Chinese mills that are providing Lumber Liquidators with toxic laminate are very
open about it – and to get safe laminate only costs ~10-15% more.


As I've written in my five prior articles, I've believed for nearly a year that Lumber
Liquidators was selling its American customers hundreds of millions of square feet of
laminate flooring sourced in China that contained high levels of formaldehyde, a
dangerous chemical and known carcinogen - and that senior executives knew (or should
have known) this.


But until recently, I viewed this as run-of-the-mill bad behavior - the kind of thing I've seen
dozens (if not hundreds) of times in my dozen years of short selling. Maybe the board and
senior executives at Lumber Liquidators were foolish, naïve, and/or willfully ignorant
enough that they could plausibly claim not to know what was going on right under their
noses.


No longer. Their behavior since the 60 Minutes story aired on March 1st has led me to the
inescapable conclusion that Lumber Liquidators is evil.


No, I didn't check with my lawyer before publishing this and, yes, I'm sure he's cringing as
he reads it because it increases the odds that the company sues me for libel. But to be
libel "a claim must generally be false" - and my statement isn't, as there's simply no other
word than evil for a company that continues to sell a product that it now knows with
certainty is violating California Air Resources Board (CARB) standards and is threatening
the health and safety of its customers, especially children.

Here's what Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the world's leading experts on exposure to toxic
chemicals, said when 60 Minutes showed him test results regarding the formaldehyde
level in a typical home with Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate flooring:


I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky because it would
increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a person's lung function,
increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce symptoms in everyone but
children will be the people most likely to show symptoms at that sort of level.


Moving from the theoretical to the actual, here are some of the awful symptoms that have
been reported just in the last nine days on a single web site by Lumber Liquidators’
customers:


…our dogs have developed allergies and my youngest daughter who will be 4 in
August has been running fever like an off and on switch every few weeks she runs a
high fever for a couple of days then she's OK until the next episode. I'm not sure if this
has to do with the flooring. I'm almost speechless on one hand I want to rip the floor
out on the other we don't have the money to put flooring back in...So at this point I'm
not sure what to do.
I had head and chest congestion the whole time we were installing the floor. My friends
teased me that maybe I was allergic to the floor. I was at the doctors so many times
that he sent me to an allergist. Severe symptoms subsided when we finished putting
down the floor. But I still use an inhaler when I exercise.
My symptoms are burning eyes and nose and coughing up phlem at night. Also have
itchy skin. My two dogs also cough. I thought they had kennel cough, but now think it is
the flooring… Open your windows and air the place out frequently, especially before
bed. Then pray this gets settled soon as I read that the off gassing can last 10 years.
I was doing some reading of scientific papers on this formaldehyde effects, wondering
two things. 1. Could my tremors that I have had for the past few month be related to
this? Sadly, yes. It also cause neurological damage. 2. How long does outgasing go on
with a product like laminate flooring. Bad news again. It was estimated to be in the 10
year range.
…we have had boughts of sore throays, burning eyes and my son and I always have
stuffy, runny noses.
…the itching was so sever I literally had scratches all over my body - it was insane…
…my husband…has had MAJOR skin issues…
…our children and dogs and I have had multiple issues…
My husband has had major skin issues since installation (he installed it).

Price Slashing and Lies to Lure Customers to Buy Its Laminate 


Lumber Liquidators has a big problem: it has bloated inventory levels overall – $314
million as of the end of 2014, equal to six months of sales – and I estimate that at least
10% of this, or $31 million, is Chinese-made laminate, for which demand has surely
declined dramatically. As discussed earlier, rather than doing the right thing and halting
sales of this toxic product, the company is determined to keep selling it, so it’s adopted a
dual strategy. First, it’s slashed prices, with a focus on its laminate flooring, as you can see
by comparing the company’s home page 10 days ago vs. today (I’ve posted both here;
one can’t tell which laminates are Chinese-made, as Lumber Liquidators – surprise! –
doesn’t disclose this, but I suspect most are). Here are two screenshots of the laminate
sections of the current web page:

Lumber Liquidators’ second strategy to move its toxic laminate is to lie to its customers by
telling them “our laminate products, all of our products, are 100% safe.” As part of this, the
company has added the following in the past week to every page on its web site on which
laminate is sold (click here for one example):


It is unbelievably foolish of Lumber Liquidators to do this because it's provably false (CEO
Rob Lynch on the company's recent conference call admitted that "We know that [CARB's]
tests on some deconstructed samples have had elevated levels [of formaldehyde]…"), and
thus it dramatically increases the company's legal liability and reputational damage. So
why is Lumber Liquidators doing this? It can only be the result of pure desperation.
They're violating the first rule of holes: when you're in one, stop digging! But nooooo,
they're digging themselves deeper and deeper with reckless decisions like this. From the
perspective of a short seller, this management team is the gift that keeps on giving.


Chinese Mills Openly Sell Non-CARB-Compliant Laminate


With all the debate over testing methodologies/deconstruction, whether CARB will take
action, how much formaldehyde are Lumber Liquidators' customers actually being
exposed to, what harm has resulted, etc., I think the single most important thing in the 60
Minutes story is being overlooked: that at all three mills 60 Minutes' undercover
investigators visited:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3019166-lumber-liquidators-is-evil 9/60


Employees at the mills openly admitted that they use core boards with higher levels
of formaldehyde to make Lumber Liquidators laminates, saving the company 10-15
percent on the price. At all three mills they also admitted falsely labeling the
company's laminate flooring as CARB 2…


This is the elephant in the room. In light of this (and the company's lack of any sensible
alternative explanation), how can anyone doubt even for a moment that Lumber
Liquidators has been selling non-CARB 2-compliant laminate for quite some time - and,
shockingly, continues to sell it this very day!


Chinese mills producing non-CARB 2-compliant laminate shouldn't be a surprise to
anyone because the mills are completely open about it. In fact, someone who reached out
to me after the 60 Minutes story aired, who's very credible and knowledgeable about the
industry, shared with me an email he received from one of his suppliers (which happens to
be one of the mills shown on the 60 Minutes segment), in which the Vice President of the
mill offers to sell him laminate and gives two prices: one for safe laminate with
formaldehyde levels below the limit set by CARB and one for toxic laminate that doesn't
comply (for a lower price of course). Here is the key part of the email:


I think it will be good manner to solve this problem of the carb2 boards.


When u be here we can talk about it, ok?


Now customers need the carb2 need to add 0.5usd/Sqm.


Here's what really boggles my mind: this email was sent seven days after the 60 Minutes
story exposed that the mill was selling non-CARB 2-compliant laminate - they're not
ashamed of it; rather, they're perfectly open about it.


It's also powerful evidence that, while Lumber Liquidators can show lots of paperwork from
the Chinese mills and testing facilities attesting to CARB 2 compliance, the company in
fact knew exactly what it was buying in China - and, in turn, selling its customers.


Here's the extended excerpt from the 60 Minutes transcript:

Employees at the mills openly admitted that they use core boards with higher levels
of formaldehyde to make Lumber Liquidators laminates, saving the company 10-15
percent on the price. At all three mills they also admitted falsely labeling the
company's laminate flooring as CARB 2, meaning it meets California formaldehyde
emissions standards, and the new U.S. federal law.


At this factory, the general manager told investigators Lumber Liquidators is one of
their biggest customers.


[Manager: This is a best-seller for Lumber Liquidators.


Investigator: For Lumber Liquidators?


Manager: Yeah.


Investigator: How long have you been selling this?


Manager: From last year.


Investigator: Is this CARB 2?]


CARB 2 means it's compliant with California law. But listen to what the general
manager told us.


[Manager: No, no, no... I have to be honest with you. It's not CARB 2.


Investigator: Can I get CARB 2?


Manager: Yes, you can. It's just the price issue. We can make CARB 2 but it would
be very expensive.]


And that's the same thing the undercover team was told at all three mills they visited.


[Investigator: All this stuff here, Lumber Liquidators... All their labeling is CARB 2
right? But it's not CARB 2?


Employee: Not CARB 2.]


Conclusion


What Lumber Liquidators is doing is obvious, it's evil, and must stop immediately.

Nailed it Tom. I liked Tilson's articles up until now.


Any time you're calling another person or company "evil" is when you know you've gone too far. Stick to the
facts and present the evidence. Don't go calling people "evil". That's an absurd statement.

I don't like his modus operandi, or Ackman's of which it is the apprentice's copy.


I make a point of staying far away from anything subject to that kind of tactics, in either direction. I'm able to

Hi Tom,


Respectfully, the tipranks.com page for him is somewhat misleading, given that he made a few calls way
before 1 year ago (specifically GMCR and IOC).


But more importantly, it's a bit misleading to average readers/investors, by looking at selected 1-year record,
especially given these media pundit type investment managers can *reset* a lot more easily after dismal
performances, Mr. Tilson himself included: 
http://bit.ly/1C5V5Ac


After a year where he underperforms S&P by 26%, he has the luxury to restart a fund. Not very many of us
regular investors have that opportunity.

The issue has and remains whether or not the mill deliberately mislabeled product. This article is right in pointing that
out. It is the "smoking gun" and we need to see who's fingerprints are on it.


However, this needs to be vetted so we all can know the truth.


To call a company "evil" before all the facts are known is improper. Hyperbole is expected from passionate people, but
there is a point at which common decency should take hold.


I'm very interested in obtaining information that points to LLs guilt or innocence, but not the least bit interested in
reading about someone trying to make a case of good-vs-evil. Self-righteousness is just another form of evil.

Then, logic would follow that I'm the stove for calling the pan for calling the pot for calling the kettle.

I saw the 60 minute report. The 60 minute camera crew toured all three plants in China with a hidden camera.
The manager who gave the tour said on camera that none of the flooring made by the plant would be CARB
compliant because of cost. I would say that statement has been vetted by the fact that 60 minutes tested 31
samples at three labs of laminate floor sold by different LL around the country and only 1 of the 31 samples
was CARB compliant. The tests also revealed 100% of the flooring made in the US was CARB compliant
from LL, Home Depot and Lowes. Futhermore, 100% of the China made laminate flooring sold in Lowes and
Home Depot was CARB compliant. That is pretty definitive in my book.

LL is offering people free air tests to see if they have an actual problem. What more can you ask for? Are the air tests
deceptive? If not, then it seems like a reasonable solution. These frequent posts from Mr. Tilson seem a bit desperate.

Hi Barry,


......."...........What more can you ask for? Are the air tests deceptive?..."


1) One thing we could ask for is for LL to stop selling product until the issue is resolved.


2) There is no indication that the air tests are CARB2 compliant, nor do they address whether or not there was
deliberate mislabeling.


Personally, I don't see how am "idiot test" administered by a DIY'er is more informative than a test done by a CARB
certified lab, in an controlled environment by trained technicians.


Secondarily, why would any reasonable person accept the DIY'er test over the certified lab test? Unless, of course
they were trying an "end run" or self deception.


23 Mar 2015, 09:58 AM


Barry Robbins, Contributor
From what I gathered from an earlier SA article, it is impossible to take a finished product and return it to its
original state. The carb2 standards apply to the original product, so really any test applied to the finished
product is irrelevant. I think there is an obsession with the carb2 standards. - is LL guilty of injuring their
customers or violating a gov't standard? A lot of companies are violating gov't standards. I don't know of any
customer who can prove that they were injured by LL's flooring.

The test may be flawed (I don't know) but it is not irrelevant. At the least it is an indicator that is very effective
as a screening tool ... suggesting more in depth testing.


So ... questionable?...yes ... irrelevant ? ... no.

The standard for testing CARB flooring for enforcement is deconstructing the floor. The standard of 7PPM set
for CARB compliant was based on the testing method of deconstructing the floor. Frankly, an environmental
test would be less scientific since the air tests actually measures formaldehyde from everything in the room.
But lets assume the LL argument is valid that some formaldehyde can leach from the adhesive into the core.
If the flooring was 10,20 30 even 100PPM I could buy that argument. However, some of the LL laminate
flooring made in China had 2000PPM and samples were tested by three labs with the same results. The limit
for daily formaldehyde exposure from all sources such as installed construction materials in the home,
shampoo, wine etc is 750PPM. The expert on 60 minutes said 2000PPM is dangerous. The government
needs to seize all flooring made in China sold by LL and test it. It is the government's job to protect the public.
Tilson is doing a public service to push the government.

"When you burn materials such as natural gas, wood, gasoline or tobacco, formaldehyde gas is released.
Formaldehyde in small concentrations is a normal part of our environment. Outdoor air levels are usually
between 0.002 to 0.006 parts per million (ppm) in suburban areas."

Some drugs save lives at a therapeutic dose but a dose of warfin only 30% too high is toxic and can cause
death. In fact most drugs have a toxic dose and even a lethal dose. The point is low levels of formaldehyde is
not toxic but beyond a certain level is toxic. MORE importantly, the toxic level for children and infants would
be much lower and infants crawling on a floor that contains dangerously high levels of formaldehyde can
cause asthma. That can not be made right by simply replacing a floor. If Tilson believes that to be correct,
Tilson does not know with certainty that his statement about LL being evil is false. Also formaldehyde is fat
soluable and stored in the body. Most substances are water soluable and excreted by the kidneys. There are
reasons the government regulates this. The state of California is just quicker than the Federal Government
but the proposed federal standards are essentially the same as California's standards.

Hmm I thought you were done writing about LL...good luck proving those cases in court.


23 Mar 2015, 10:19 AM


Sami J. Karam, Contributor
It may take a long time to settle this case in court. LL can plead ignorance and claim that it was the Chinese supplier's
fault etc. The other point is that IF there is a significant future liability here, it may make more sense for the powers
that be to keep the company alive and to penalize its future cash flows, instead of driving it out of business and killing
those cash flows. I suppose there is a possible bankruptcy scenario that would please short sellers AND compensate
the alleged harmed customers, one in which the equity is wiped out but the company keeps operating and meeting its
liabilities.

I don't understand why LL doesn't end sale of its Chinese laminate, immediately.


It could likely find a foreign buyer of the remaining inventory, at a discount. Dump the stuff; end the
controversy. Then the only negative news is regarding past sales.

It seems vital to me that the controversy be ended quickly, reputation restored. As for the actual liability, I'm
doubtful formaldehyde is so dangerous. The controversy simply needs to be ended.

They believe that their laminated floor is safe so that is the main reason they still want to continue selling the
products.


23 Mar 2015, 12:32 PM


balert2
But LL is continuing to sell this arguably unhealthy flooring. The governments responsibility is not to ensure
compensation, but to protect the health of the public. I am sure the company has insurance to pay claims in
the event LL goes out of business. Insurance companies paid asbestos claims after bankruptcy of the
manufacturer.


24 Mar 2015, 06:56 PM

If they suddenly terminate the sale of the Chinese laminate in question, they're admitting guilt. Best thing to
do PR-wise is to switch to another, compliant, manufacturer and claim it's for economic reasons.


27 Mar 2015, 12:08 PM


balert2
Continuing with the present suppliers in China suggests complicity. They made a calculated error and now
they own it. They should VERY publicly discontinue this source for PR reasons once LL fails the CPSC
testing. If they just switch for "economic reasons" it looks like a continuing effort to avoid responsibility and
another attempt at being deceptive.

Just remember, it has been 4 weeks since this fiasco was started and neither CARB nor EPA nor OSHA have said
anything about the dangers that are posted daily. Why is it that none of these agencies are shutting LL down
immediately. Maybe, just maybe, there is no problem; and it does not come anywhere close to the doom and gloom
status that it has been elevated to. 
I think if any of the air tests that were sent out showed major formaldehyde emissions it would have been on U-tube
by now even if LL wanted to hide it. 
There should be a law against causing mass hysteria and I think this certainly will be an example of what not to do,
even if you think you are right. 
I wonder if the people that were over stressed unnecessarily can sue. I would like to see a class action lawsuit for
causing undue stress.


We can not be experts on everything, but the duty falls on the shoulders of the folks experts in their fields to know
when to calm or alarm the rest of us. So lets wait for the experts and not sound bites of 60 minutes or even LL's word.
So far the experts that everyone, including me, have researched have not said a thing.

I've visited a variety of sites in an attempt to learn where competitive laminates are sold. Without exception,
I'm seeing verification of "safety and CARB complinace". So it's not only LL that is making this claim since the
60 Minutes story broke. For giggles, how can we learn the % of laminates that are made in China? Does
Shaw manufacture in China? Does Pergo?


The formaldehyde testing issue is an 800 pound gorilla that the EPA will need to address THIS year before

You obviously did not see the 60 Minute report. 60 Minutes purchased flooring made in the US and China
from several Home Depot and Lowes around the country and sent them to be tested at three different labs
and 100% of the flooring sold by both had acceptable (i.e. were compliant with CARB) levels of formaldehyde
and many had zero levels of formaldehyde. 60 minutes really attempted to dot every I and cross every t. But
Anderson Cooper who did the report has not been on 60 Minutes since the report. I find that curious.

crushedbyoil
Sedric, you can find it in one of these articles.


What comes to mind quickly: Extended concentrations are carcinogenic. Trouble breathing, eyes watering.


A google search (for formaldehyde exposure in general):


"Among the acute effects of formaldehyde are irritations of the eyes, the nose, and the throat. When exposed
to the compound for an appreciable length of time, the throat may feel raw and sore. At the same time, the
eyes may begin to feel as if there is something grainy resting against each eyeball. Like the throat, the interior
area of the nose may begin to feel raw and somewhat sore. Coughing and some trouble breathing may also
be present until the individual is removed from the area where the formaldehyde is in use.


With chronic formaldehyde exposure, constant exposure can lead to the development of all the effects of
acute exposure, but go far beyond them. Along with irritation of the nose, eyes, and throat, the respiratory
system may be negatively impacted, leading to pain when attempting to breathe. If not treated in a timely

manner, the exposure can lead to the creation of lesions in the respiratory system and cause damage to the
lungs that may or may not be reversible.


People with a formaldehyde allergy are also likely to develop severe skin rashes when coming into contact
with the substance. The skin may appear burned, develop welts, or become dry and cracked, depending on
the severity of the allergic reaction. Prompt attention to the reaction must take place in order to prevent the
possibility of scarring.


There is also some evidence that constant formaldehyde exposure increases the chances of developing
certain forms of cancer."

Anyone concerned would only test the air to see if the inside air quality is presently safe. It doesn't have to
make sense; that's what many would do.


I'm long LL, but I'm not going to say I wouldn't test if buying a house. I wouldn't myself likely keep laminate
anyway. What I do and what the US government allows are two different things. I don't need a narrative that
promotes the stock. I don't see a reason for LL to crash, so I bought it. There's unlikely to be much liability
here. There's more risk of a short squeeze (more upward potential than down).

12-15% of LL's revenue is from laminating wood.


25 Mar 2015, 09:02 AM


balert2
But because the China made flooring has a higher profit margin, the laminate wood actually accounts for a
higher per cent of their profit. LL provided the revenue number for damage control purposes. But they did
acknowledge the average purchase cycle is 100 days so they were unable to give any forward guidance for
the quarter or the year.

Ha, so much for Whitney keeping a "lower profile".


23 Mar 2015, 11:52 AM


Wisdom's Reward, Contributor
Just an opinion here, but this article seems to indicate to me that Mr. Tilson might be getting too emotionally invested
in this situation. Investment management is first and foremost about achieving good returns, right? If that's our
primary goal, then we absolutely have to keep our emotions in check.


When investing turns into a personal crusade of right versus wrong, good versus evil, it is probably very easy to let
emotion drive the decision making process. For example, if I were simply trying to generate a good return, I might
consider covering my short here (I have no position and am only speculating about what I might do in Mr. Tilson's
shoes). If I believed I was on a mission from God (or if I were atheist, maybe just on a mission from my personal
conscience and convictions) to help protect the health of children by destroying LL, I probably would not stop until
they were "destroyed" - which may or may not be the right thing to do, and which may or may actually end up
happening. The way I see it, the problem has been thoroughly exposed, the market has reacted, and from here on
out, it is up to the courts and the regulatory bodies to decide LL's fate. No investor has been granted the authority nor
the responsibility of making the final judgment about LL's fate. The way I see it, the short seller's role and
responsibility in such a case is only to shine light on the problem. That has been thoroughly accomplished in this
case.


I know other commenters have already made points along this line, but I felt the need to weigh in. Human beings tend
to justify whatever is in their own self interest. LL's management is probably doing that to some degree (we all do it to
some degree - if I break the speed limit today I put other people's safety at risk because of my own selfishness - but
at what point should it be labeled as "evil"?). But, the author might be doing it to some degree as well in this situation.

He also might be making the mistake of letting emotion drive his investment decision at this point. He might not be.
Maybe he is right to continue this crusade. I don't know. But it's at least something for him to consider, I think. We
have to keep ourselves in check by constantly examining and re-examining our decisions, our motives,
responsibilities to clients versus other parties affected by our actions, the risks of our decisions versus the benefits,
etc.

EnerSavr, Contributor
Jonk, 
Maybe you should examine the paint on the walls, it had more formaldehyde in it than the flooring when it was used.
How about the kitchen cabinets, maybe even the floor of the house. Some contractors use particle board rather than
plywood. By the way do not use GAS in the house, make sure everything is electric. Also you might want to do a
destructive test on the oil tank in the house because that holds a lot of toxic chemicals that is very hazardous and
might harm you.


I think you get the point.


Good luck.

So, now you not only have rendered a verdict in the case, you've determined what evidence will be admitted.
Are you basing this on actual legal process or Judge Hatchett?


Fact is, the statement, itself, is meaningless, except that it demands further investigation. It is the record-
keeping that is the tell-all. If it corroborates the statement, then there will be no regulatory case, it's game
over.


As far as civil litigation, I'm not sure the regulatory decision has to be punitive for a win/settlement.

Hi Ken, 
My point is anything comes out from China is questionable, from products, labeling, testing and the same for

That is certainly a problem of expert witnesses used in court. 60 minutes used a hidden camera and then
went on tours of all the sources of laminate flooring sold by LL. The 60 minutes report included video from a

You are right. Lumber Liquidators is not the only supplier selling high density fiberboard core floorboards from

We are in the process of doing a deconstructive test on those floorboards. Using one of the same labs 60
Minutes used.


According to the 60 minutes story, they tested laminate floorboards from Home Depot and Lowe's and they
did meet the CARB 2 formaldehyde regulation for composite wood products. So not all suppliers are sourcing
these toxic boards.

Next, anyone can sue anyone ... but to prevail takes a little more. There is nothing Tilson had done that

But, I do think he should have talked to his attorneys before this article.


His opening salvo is less cautious and, in my opinion, defamatory.....


"•Lumber Liquidators is knowingly endangering the health and safety of its customers, especially children, by
continuing to sell toxic Chinese-made laminate"


It is not clear that there is a health hazard and proving someone "knowingly" endangered others requires
quite a bit of proof.


LL only has to present reasonable arguments that they believed the CARB was not a representative test.
Whether factual or not, if it is their belief, they did not "knowingly" endanger anyone. They may have
"unknowingly" but not "knowingly".


Having read his previous articles, I think he messed up this time.


So, starting today, I think he's in trouble.

Tilson just restated the conclusion of the 60 Minute expert that said the flooring could be a health hazard if the
core tested at 2000 PPB and the limit should be 5 PPB (also stated .005 PPM) because the total daily
exposure from all sources should not exceed 750 PPB.

"Lumber Liquidators is knowingly endangering the health and safety of its customers, especially children, by
continuing to sell toxic Chinese-made laminate."


I starting seeing Lumbar Liquidator ads on TV a few years ago. I wondered why homeowners would install cheap and
unattractive laminate floors when hardwood floors are much more attractive and last longer.


Not only are the laminate floors sold by Lumber Liquidators extremely unattractive, but now there are claims that
these floors are toxic.


It must be a challenge for a company to advertise a product that is unattractive and toxic.


Lumber Liquidators stock performed extremely well for some time. Now the stock is under siege. Considering all of
the turmoil and controversy surrounding Lumber Liquidators, it would be wise to avoid this stock at this time.

Real floors look much better but laminate installation requires little skill or costly tools so it can be installed by
the homeowner. Laminate requires less maintenance and is more scratch resistant especially for larger dogs.
Real wood flooring develops gaps in dryer climate states like Nevada and looks bad over time so laminate is
the only choice if one desires a wood look.

Just watched it again: On Demand March 1 Episode 22. 60 minutes reported the HD & Lowes information
right before an environmental attorney 60 minutes hired as a consultant said the level (of formaldehyde) was
so high in some China made laminate flooring that one test lab thought their equipment was broken. 60
Minutes actually sent the same samples to three different labs and got the same results. In the first few
minutes of the report they also reported they sent laminate samples of flooring purchased at Lowes and
Home Deport that were made in China and the US and showed a graph that they all passed CARB
deconstruction tests but 30 of the 31 samples of laminate made in China and sold by LL failed the same tests
according to the graph and the report. 60 Minutes also reported they tested all the brands of US made
laminate flooring at LL and they all passed the same CARB compliant tests. I personally thought they dotted
all their i's and crossed all their t's.

results and said the levels were a health hazard.

Matt Brice, Contributor
Balert2--Here is the transcript--you are just wrong. 
You will see below, 60 minutes only tested LL product, 31 boxes and sent to 2 labs--the data is on their
website, Benchmark and HPVA. 
GCM--the class action attorneys did the other tests, but they won't release those results, so we can't verify
any of that...


Drury and Larson bought more than 150 boxes of laminate flooring at stores around California and sent them
to three certified labs for a series of tests. The results? While laminate flooring from Home Depot and Lowes
had acceptable levels of formaldehyde, as did Lumber Liquidators American-made laminates, every single
sample of Chinese-made laminate flooring from Lumber Liquidators failed to meet California formaldehyde
emissions standards. Many by a large margin.


 
Drury and Larson only had wood tested that was being sold in California. But we wondered if the Chinese-
made laminate flooring that Lumber Liquidators is selling nationwide also has high levels of formaldehyde. So
we went to stores in Virginia, Florida, Texas, Illinois and New York, and bought 31 boxes of it.


We sent the samples for testing at two certified labs. It turns out of the 31 samples of Chinese-made laminate
flooring, only one was compliant with formaldehyde emissions standards. Some were more than 13x over the
California limit. Both labs told us they had never seen formaldehyde levels that high.

-scratchy eyes  
-nosebleeds


The words "skin" and "rash" don't even show up in the above mentioned link.


Yet, 3 out of ten customer reports quoted in the article talk about skin irritation, 1 reports "multiple issues" and 1 talks

In the end the consumer demanding the lowest price no matter what is just as guilty. At least of stupidity. I've seen
thousands of dollars in overtime paid simply because an idiot in purchasing thought equipment ill suited to the
requirements of jobs was a better deal because it was cheaper. What did the consumer expect for 49 cents a square
foot when the other companies were at 2 to $3 a square foot? It goes as well for $LL. Did they really expect this junk
was good enough quality to sell in their stores and the other brands were just ripping them and consumers off? I only
feel bad for those who could only afford this garbage. Life isn't fair. Get over it $LL bulls.

Tests you administer yourself are nonsensical because the results will depend on innumerable variables that you can't
control. Say for instance you lock the doors and windows and otherwise seal a room with a recently installed laminate
and then after a month has passed you perform the air quality test. My bet is that will affect the results significantly as
will a hundred other factors. The company may claim that rooms are not used in this way but this is a nonsensical
argument. Rooms are used in all kinds of different ways and the risk is unacceptable.


Standardized tests are there for a reason and not to have company think they know better when they clearly do not.


Tilson is of course right. LL needs to stop selling this product immediately. Just my opinion.

to our flooring. Not to mention my 7 year old son has experienced 3-4 allergic reactions to something yet to be
identified. I know engineered flooring is different than laminate and so far engineered flooring has not been mentioned
as being unsafe in the press. I have no idea if my floor is contaminated. I have not had it tested. With that said, I wish
I would've listened to a friend who warned me about LL and their flooring before I bought it last June. After seeing the

60 minute piece, I know I would never buy another piece of flooring from LL. You all can argue and debate if stock is a
0 or a "value play" all you want. Bottom line is...LL's got caught being greedy. They cut corners and whether you
believe formaldehyde is dangerous or not, they lied to their customers. Their reputation, which was not that great
before 60 minutes ran their story, is ruined. Right now I'm living with the flooring in my house but I'm concerned as
anyone would be. I've also shorted the stock since the Monday after the story ran. Unless someone can give me a
solid reason otherwise , I will continue to ride my position all the way down. I can live with a few bumps in the road
along the way. This company is in deep deep trouble.

you bought their laminating and you shorted their stock, just make sure that your son is really sick from the

24 Mar 2015, 01:42 PM


crushedbyoil
It's easy to have the air tested. If your family is sick, you should probably get an LL test kit since they're
sending them out.


It's unlikely the flooring is currently outgassing though. The testing was deconstructive and only the Chinese-
made laminate failed. It's more of a potential threat. If it is outgassing, airing the house is an easy solution.


Chinese-made toys also have formaldehyde danger, btw. I buy nothing Chinese-made when I can help it. No
other country has such quality problems, yet it seems *most* toys are made in China.

Here's a copy of two of my SeekingAlpha posts from earlier this month on another thread mentioning the 60 Minutes
story. These posts mention a 16X9 documentary on 'illegal' Russian exports of lumber to China which is then shipped
to Canada and the USA. The links I provided are worth following...


"If this is a problem here in Canada, I wouldn't be surprised if it's not at least 10 times bigger in the States. Watch this
problem spread to all other companies that ship in lumber from abroad. I think mould and radon when I try to imagine
the financial insurance and home price implications of this issue. 60 Minutes just addressed California.


Read this article:


Think that new hardwood floor is made in Canada? Think again


"In one of Ander’s stores sits about 20,000 feet of flooring that purports to be made here. “I’ve got the box right here.
It says ‘solid hardwood flooring, Quebec, Canada,’” Ander said.


“There’s not a chance this isn’t from China — not even close,” he said. The wood itself is South Asian Walnut. ..."

couple years to get out of this one. Pity those that held a higher "faith" in importers.


That "faith" must now be pretty much destroyed. Lumber Liquidators staff were apparently shocked at the hidden
camera evidence shown by 60 Minutes - and were going to be inspecting those mills in China 'the next day'.


Well, well, well. Months appear to have passed and they are only now surprised. Hmm.


I lost some money on Sino-Forest a few years ago thinking that with it's Board full of former auditors and having a
great faith in the honest of people - that the Muddy Waters analysis was contrived. I was proven very wrong. Instead
the early bad news was just the tip of the crumbling iceberg and the apparent depth of the potential fraud at Sino-

Tilson would be entitled to discovery.

Hi simplevalue,


Regulators are aware that the longer they allow theses stories to spread the more irrevocable damage is
done to the retailer.


They are much quicker to announce "o.k" than to condemn.


I don't think any inference can be drawn from the delay, but I wouldn't go down your path.


23 Mar 2015, 05:59 PM


Matt Brice, Contributor
Reel Ken--I disagree with that statement, especially if you consider the various allegations of toxicity. No
regulator is going to knowingly "stand by" so irrevocable damage is done to the brand of the retailer--their
goal would be to get the toxic product off the shelf.


Each day that goes by, the short argument for toxic laminates becomes weaker. The only ones talking about
this issue are investors now, not the consumers. This is ironically the odd part about LL's PR strategy that has
actually worked well. Don't engage and people will move on--It isn't great for the stock in the short-term, but it
is good for their potential sales, and that's what investors should focus on.


Check out various searches on google trends. Everything is returning to normal....

Did Mr. Tilson go after the CEOs of the major US banks whose dishonesty nearly destroyed the US and global

allegedly toxic laminated wood flooring could ever do. To date, no one has successfully proven that their LL wood
flooring caused serious illness, no less death. Whereas the dishonestly of the nations' largest banks emotionally and
financially destroyed tens of thousands of lives.

In 2005 I purchased a new toy hauler RV that was apparently made with interior materials sourced from China. Not
knowing of the risks, to save money, I stayed in this trailer for an extended period of time starting in 2011. The long
story short is that even low to moderate levels of these compounds can destroy your lungs, especially when combined
with a CPAP machine...which resulted in hypersensitivity pneumonitis and traction fibrosis from the chronic lung
inflammation and COPD. It would have really helped if the doctors that I saw initially had clue about toxicology.

Wow! 
An investor with everything to gain, who has already won, is sticking the knife in further and pouring salt in the wound.
We must ask ourselves what is the danger of using non compliant CARB2 flooring? How many customers have
complained? Has anyone died? Are the government standards realistic, they only apply in CA and only since January
of 2011. How much formaldehyde was used in the past and why isn't there a push to remove all old flooring that is not
CARB2. Did you watch the 60 minutes video? Why were all the accusers hiding their faces? Why did they only ask
about LL don't they have other customers? Could 60 minutes be wrong in their taking the bait from Tilson and other
shorts? Evil? I'm a customer of LL and have been for many years although never laminate. This is a good company
that offers great prices and I will be shocked if they knowingly sold a dangerous product to their customers. I have not
heard or seen anything yet that would lead me to believe any customer is in danger unless you bought the stock prior
to the 60 minutes piece.

balert2
Tilson did write in an earlier post that he did not trade the stock after he contacted 60 minutes until it was
reported in the news that 60 minutes did a report on LL. That was Barry Minco's mistake about the accounting
irregularities he claimed, he traded Lennar stock with information before the information was public. I have
seen a lot of comments about Ackerman. I heard his interview on Bloomberg. Ackerman did not receive a
subpoena. Investigators he hired received subpoenas. If the investigators obtained unknown information on
Herbalife and then purchased stock based on that information, they may have violated securities law.
Ackerman is wise enough to hold a press conference, disclose everything he has discovered before trading
shares of Herbalife. Ackerman was very clear on Bloomberg that he was not the target of a government
investigation.


24 Mar 2015, 08:48 PM


balert2
I am not a lawyer but I believe that the burden of proof would be for LL to prove that 60 minutes KNEW the
gentleman from China made false statements. In a court of law 60 minutes is innocent until proven otherwise.
LL would have to find the guy and have him testify that something in the 60 minute broadcast that included
him was somehow intentionally false. Frankly the deconstruction tests confirm the man was, more likely than
not, telling the truth. I would not be surprised if the man from China was fired about the 60 minute report but I
do not know that to be a fact.


24 Mar 2015, 09:06 PM


nhsully88
But it doesn't seem to bother you that you and Tilson are condemning LL before a trial. 60 minutes is not
judge, jury and executioner, nor is the deconstructive test anything more than an indication that there could be
something wrong. The actual tests and responsibility rest with the mill and third party certifier.

I had a state Supreme Court justice that was a patient of mine and he would joke he liked to read the paper
just to see what happened in his court. Obviously he was implying newspapers with some frequency also get
it wrong. Watching the 60 minutes program was more like sitting on a jury than reading a newspaper. I realize
litigation may last longer than LL so any investor would be unwise to ignore the report. The 60 minutes report
was done very much like a court trial and 60 minutes also interviewed the founder and chairmen of the board
of LL before and after he was shown parts of the 60 minute report. The 60 minute report did report 60 Minutes
performed tests using the environmental testing method advocated by LL and the results were also so high a

Unfortunately 60 minutes did not talk about third party certifier responsibilities or talk to them while in China. A
TV show will look like what ever the producer wants it to if they know their audience and how to sway the
majority. 60 minutes did not have time to cover all issues and avenues, similar to the deconstructive test not
being a definitive go / no-go test....

The plant manager on hidden camera pretty much explained that the plant knowing manufactured the
laminate flooring for LL that essentially had no chance to meet CARB compliant standards because that
would add 15% to the cost. The plant knowingly mislabel the boxes. When the company viewed the video,
they said they would correct this immediately. I am waiting to view the 60 Minute follow up. I assume they will
visit the plants again. The testing methodology debate is more suited for court and government regulators.

I would like to see (if it is even possible) an analysis of all wood products sold globally by major home retailers (Ikea,
HD, Lowes) etc, etc. Max Vision pointed out how Ikea was protesting certain standards which implies they may be
¨guilty¨of similar things. This specific attention to LL is really only fair if this specific Chinese factory sells ¨bad
stuff¨ONLY to LL (at their direction) and no one else for the most part. If there is something bad with the wood from
this factory but it is sold to the majority or all of global retailers and not JUST LL then to me it seems similar to Tilson
et al is attacking a small vulnerable regional soda maker or craft brewer because their soda contains yellow dye No. 5
and whatever the beer equivalent is even though everyone else´s product contains the exact same thing. I am not
saying it makes it right (we don´t even know if there is anything wrong) but the shorts are specifically targeting a
smaller vulnerable company in the hopes of making money. Has Tilson done extensive testing on ALL Chinese or
otherwise made wood products sold at EVERY major home retailer in the world? I think his sharp attack on LL is only
fair if they are the only ones doing whatever he argues they are doing (which may or may not be the case). If this is
not the case then I do think this is stock manipulation, immoral and amounts to propaganda.

"Lumber Liquidators has a big problem: it has bloated inventory levels overall – $314 million as of the end of 2014,
equal to six months of sales"


How does this guy do math? LL had over $1B in sales last year?


23 Mar 2015, 09:19 PM


SeattleGoldMiner
Their cost of goods is running at around 60%. Thus $314mm of inventory represents around $525mm in
sales, which is approx. 6 months.

It is possible a disproportionate amount of sales occurs during the summer so there might be two quarters
that add up to that amount.

"The Chinese mills that are providing Lumber Liquidators with toxic laminate are very open about it – and to get safe
laminate only costs ~10-15% more. " - This could be their profit margin?!


Here in the Philippines they sell a very smelly, toxic, out-gassing plastic for cabinets to store clothes. It's cheaper than
non-smelling plastic, so people buy it and don't care. If you care, like I do, buy natural material cabinets like wood or
fibre, or buy a non-smelling plastic, which costs a bit more.

Only 38% of sales are laminate. Also they have a very good board. Dollar tree, advance auto parts and boston beer
execs on there. Should be some credible advice there.


Hard to call the bottom yet but LL has fallen over 75% from its highs. Typically a 75% fall has wiped out original
holders. They are gone. Selling is close to exhaustion. 
Slow shore expansion, cut some expenses, new pr campaign, in three yrs probably a double at least.

What I find interesting is that LL was singled out as "evil" incarnate. Makes for great personal indignation and short
selling. LL is neither the largest buyer of Chinese produced flooring and likely not the only one that is selling over-limit
VOC products. I expect LL will make changes so I see them as long. Don't forget the barbecuing literally produces
millions of times higher limits of toxic and carcinogenic emissions than does the flooring, unless of course you are
using the flooring in the barbecue.

Author’s reply »  On 3/13, LL’s founder and CEO, Tom Sullivan, concluded his disastrous CNBC interview
(http://cnb.cx/1DVfxqV) with a lame attempt to smear me by linking me to twice-convicted felon Barry Minkow. Others
on the message boards have done the same.


I have nothing to hide, so I’ll tell you the whole story: After Minkow finished serving 7½ years in prison for the ZZZZ
Best scam, he was doing great work uncovering frauds – he even got a letter of commendation from the FBI for
bringing something like 18 scams to their attention so they could shut them down.


He was also doing excellent, pioneering research on the multi-level marketing industry and set up a paid research
service for investors (this was ~10 years ago). I thought the industry was (and still is!) really scummy and had a short
position in Usana at the time, so I signed up for Minkow’s service for maybe a year, paid him a modest amount
($50k?), and he shared his research on the MLM industry with me. (I also liked the idea of a fraudster turned fraud-
catcher and wanted to support him; I thought – incorrectly, as later events showed – that he’d turned over a new leaf.)


Not much came of it and his research slowed to a trickle, so I stopped paying him and we lost contact.


I later found out that he conspired with someone who had a business dispute with Lennar, the homebuilder, and was
smearing Lennar on that person’s behalf to blackmail them into settling the dispute on favorable terms – a classic
short-and-distort campaign. Fortunately, Lennar sued him, showed what he was doing, and a judge sent him back to
prison in 2011 to serve a richly-deserved five-year sentence.


I had nothing to do with any of this, but Lumber Liquidators, in a sure sign of its increasing desperation, is trying to say
that I’m doing to them what Minkow tried to do to Lennar. This is, of course, absurd.


I am guilty of being a bad judge of character in this particular instance – but that’s all.

Dear Mr. Tilson,


I never looked into your former business with Barry Minkow until the publication of this article, so maybe it
was indeed a poor showing of Tom Sullivan's interview skills/media savviness, though to your disadvantage
this time, as you posted the CNBC link again.


However, even if we completely ignore the law case between Mr. Minkow and Lennar, it'd seem hugely
misleading to simply paint the $50K you gave Mr. Minkow as "research". As a quick google search on Minkow
and Usana indicated the outcome was significantly more nefarious: 
http://bit.ly/1DVBrKI


Most investors don't pay for research that comes with attack ads: 
http://for.tn/1DVBpCv


And finally, the categorization of Minkow's "research slowed" was also disingenuous, as the case between
him and Usana ended in a settlement while Mr. Minkow agreed to retracting all previous attacks, cease
trading on Usana, in exchange of undisclosed amount of payment: 
http://bit.ly/1DVBpCA


That seemed, IMHO, Usana paying to stop his black-mailing. This is drastically different from your post which
made it sound like you just paid $50K for an expensive PDF report.


This tactic, I'd think, would contribute negatively to your reputation. Thank you for your response on this issue
nonetheless.

If one is guilty of at least one count of a crime and know prosecutors can prove it, lawyers might explain it is
better to sign a plea agreement because there is a deduction/reduction to the federal sentencing guidelines.
People sign plea agreements all day long with facts they don't agree are correct but do so because they are
more concerned about the length of sentence. Because Minkow had a prior conviction, the sentencing
guidelines required additional months.

Nevertheless, Minkow made his bed and he can sleep in it. Mr Tilson has never been accused of participating
in anything illegal from what I can find. I remember seeing a report about Minkow on 20/20 or similar program
about his 18 commendations from the FBI and it really looked like he turned his life around. This is the
country of second chances and Minkow looked like he deserved it. Minkow was convicted with 10 other
people in the ZZZZbest fraud, and was the youngest participant at 20 years old. Unfortunately, sometimes
prisons are like college for criminals.

“I value what you do and it is not always easy to be facing off an evil doing company or entity.


What is puzzling to me is that why California CARB regulatory agency has not stepped forward to put an end to the
mis-labeling practices of LL or other companies doing the same?


Is there anything that we can do to help?”


Dear Ray,


Thanks for your question. I’m not surprised that CARB hasn’t taken any action yet. My experience with most
regulatory agencies is that they take FOREVER to take action, even in the most obvious cases of wrongdoing. In
fairness, it can take time to document everything, to ensure that whatever action they take will hold up in court when
the company inevitably countersues/appeals.


I think there’s a lot of scrutiny/pressure on CARB (and other regulatory agencies like the Consumer Product Safety
Commission), however, so I’d be surprised if there isn’t meaningful action in the next month or two.

I replied:


Dear Ken,


Thanks for your questions. To the first one, in addition to a half dozen or so regulatory agencies looking into Lumber
Liquidators, there are nearly a dozen lawsuits against the company (here’s a list: http://bit.ly/1HyQCY8). Most (if not
all) of these entities will likely get all of LL’s emails, have the board and management give depositions under oath,
etc., so I have little doubt that the truth will come out.


I’ve talked to many knowledgeable people, observed the company’s behavior, and applied common sense – all of
which has led me to the conclusion that I’ve published in a number of articles: that they knew they were buying (and
selling to their customers) non-CARB-compliant laminate.


To your second question (“Is there any indication of what tests the mill used to certify the product ... was it
deconstructive?”), the initial tests the company relied on (the only required tests) were of the medium-density
fiberboard (MDF) before it was processed into laminate by the Chinese factories. There’s obviously no issue of
deconstruction here. Then, the company tested the finished product and, contrary to CARB’s clear guidance, didn’t
deconstruct the laminate (i.e., sand off the outer layer). I discuss this at length in three prior articles:


1) Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB (http://seekingalpha.co...);  
2) Lumber Liquidators' Campaign Of Distraction And Deception (http://seekingalpha.co...); and 
3) Explaining Lumber Liquidators' Reckless Strategy And Rebutting Its Claims About Deconstructive Testing
(http://seekingalpha.co...).


Best regards,


Whitney

If you base your case with the test method, then I see LL has no issue here. It is very clear by now that CARB
does not require the manufacture to use the deconstructive testing. I believe Ken think so too!


25 Mar 2015, 03:22 PM


balert2
In a nutshell, CARB compliant means the core was tested for acceptable levels of formaldehyde before the 4
additional layers like the printed top were added. That makes clear only the core and not the whole floor is
tested at the factory so no deconstruction (sanding the top off to expose the core) is necessary. LL's argument
is formaldehyde leeches from the other layers from the adhesive between the layers into the core and could
make a passing core exceed the allowable levels of formaldehyde. That could be true. The CARB compliant
level is 7 PPB (aka .007 PPM) so a little over I can buy LL's argument. But some of the flooring contained
2000 PPB. There is no reasonable way the core was CARB compliant before it was assembled. For the
record, Congress did pass a law in 2010 adopting the CARB standards for all 50 states but the law does not
go into effect until later this year. If LL does not sell all that China made laminate flooring quickly, they may
need to ship it out of the country to sell unless it is cheaper to burn it.

CARB only applies to the core. The core is tested the same way at the factory except the top layers does not
need to be sanded off (deconstructed) because they have not been added yet. If a product says it is CARB
compliant (a manufacturing standard); that means it will pass the enforcement test of deconstructing to test
the core. The CPSC is not concerned about the manufacturing standard, just if the flooring passes the
environmental test. Other government agencies like the FTC may more likely than not require a
deconstruction test.

Actually the EPA hasn't issued the Final Rule so a date has not been established for implementation of
CARB2 as yet.


What is the U.S. Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act? 
With the industry’s cooperation, the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act was signed
into law in 2010, establishing a framework for the regulation of emissions from composite wood products at
the national level, based on the California ATCM. The industry continues to urge EPA to quickly finalize its
draft national standard in a way that is consistent with the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood
Products Act and CARB’s ATCM regulations. Implementing CARB’s regulations on a national level will create
consistent – and stringent – emissions standards for all composite wood products manufactured in North
America or shipped into and sold in the U.S.

"There is no reasonable way the core was CARB compliant before it was assembled." If that is the case, then
the third party certifier was responsible to discover these manufacturing defects a and either require the mill
to correct or de-certify the mill. If you read the ARB requirements, you will find that the California approved
third party certifiers have that responsibility.

Help me understand this comment more please:


"I had nothing to do with any of this, but Lumber Liquidators, in a sure sign of its increasing desperation, is trying to
say that I’m doing to them what Minkow tried to do to Lennar. This is, of course, absurd."


What exactly is the difference between what minkow did and the tremendous media campaign of negativity your are
doing to LL. Every person has their own system and tendencies but isn't it factual you have written many negative
articles on LL, got 60 mins involved, gone on TV? If you think there is wrong doing, report it to the regulators and wait
for the system to work.


What I don't get is, if you have what you think is a good short idea; you write an article in SA or other venue etc. I
don't get the never ending campaign. How much time do you plan to devote to LL over the next several years?


Thank you.

Wow! This is rather self-serving, particularly by someone informed enough to know that the company he is
condemning sources their flooring from the same producers as those he is not...


Sure highlight a current case, but please do not pretend this isn't an industry-wide / regulation issue (as opposed to
an 'evil' business empire).


I hope you have your sights on all the 'evil' car manufacturers who continue to pollute the air we breathe, lol. Gimme a

If it comes out that other retailers sold the same or similar product (or worse) then I think this campaign is nothing
short of manipulation for the sole purpose of making money off a smaller more vulnerable operator. I doubt this could
be successfully prosecuted as illegal but I do think it is highly immoral.


For all we know other retailers could be selling 100x the amount of product with this supposed ¨defect¨ in products
apart from flooring. Think about all the chemicals in pressure treated wood, cabinets, particle board or the many wood
based products found in home and garden retailers.

If Tilson was truly interested in helping the public then, after discovering his results at LL, he would have done
exhaustive testing on almost ALL wood products in the major retailers like HD and then go after them since surely
they serve a much broader market and have many more customers. This would be the best ¨bang for the buck¨ in
helping the public. This ,however, would not be great for making money as a short since these major retailers are
mega caps, have much stronger defenses and more secure market positions.


Is it Tilson´s claim that LL is literally the only retailer in ¨violation¨with respect to wood products?


24 Mar 2015, 07:40 PM


balert2
The 60 minute report was they tested laminate flooring products from the 3 national retailers; almost all of the
samples failed the deconstruction tests but all of the samples from Home Depot and Lowes that were tested
passed the same test. You are probably correct that some local or regional retailers sell flooring that is
similarly mislabeled. The ball is now in the government regulators court. Will they take it to the basket or foul
out?

Per LL's 3 quarter 10q, Global Community Monitor was in a lawsuit w LL filed around July 23rd, 2014 in regards to
formaldehyde issues. GCM (Denny Lawson)was the group tearing out their floors on 60 minutes video aired March
2014. My question is why is GCM waiting until the 60 minutes video( almost a year later)to tear out all the flooring if
they knew about formaldehyde issues almost a year ago? I'm confused by Denny Lawson's timing if he was so
concerned for his well being.

To Tilson: ... you write "I've applied common sense" .... does that apply to the fact that you only tested 0.000003% of
their products? ... the sample set that 60 mins used is a joke.

Here is summary of the meeting in San Francisco

The CPSC chairman said the group's product testing will try to mimic how the product is used in the home. That has
been a subject of debate, as Lumber Liquidators has maintained that its critics are using an unrealistic test on its
flooring.

I hope some larger industry groups come out and help LL. It really makes no sense to be a public company in the
USA now unless you are at least a 20 bn company. All it takes is a motivated attacker who has the time, money and
power to cast doubt on your business and destroy your life's work. Only after the 20bn cutoff do the companies have
a large enough base to employ large legal and admin teams to tackle these issues.


No one can deny that tilson would not be attacking LL if it were private. This is bad news for public investors and great
news for private equity, VC firms and companies like Berkshire Hathaway.


25 Mar 2015, 11:49 AM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Please, LL is still a nearly $1B company that spent $13.6M on legal fees last year even before all this started,
whereas Tilson runs a (relatively) tiny $100M hedge fund.


Who do you think has a better legal team? Maybe the better question is who has the better legal claim, a
company that probably knowingly sold noncompliant products or someone that merely pointed it out (although
then probably went too far by calling them "evil").

I have no doubt after LL is exonerated because they passed the regulations, Tilson will then campaign for a change in

25 Mar 2015, 03:49 PM


balert2
You should start to have some doubt in your prediction. The law already was changed in 2010, adopting the
CARB standard but does not go into effect until later this year. The legislation calls for the regulators to write
the rules on how the testing will be performed. I assume (5 years later) the testing issue has probably been
addressed. CARB compliant is a manufacturing standard and the deconstruction test is an enforcement
assessment. The environmental test is a safety agency compliance test. They both have a place. The CPSC
will not do the same test being sent to LL customers. The CPSC will open a box and place the bundle in a
chamber and measure the level of formaldehyde. Flooring that has not been installed emits a higher level of
formaldehyde so installers are suppose to wear masks. This is not the victory investors think they have.

I think you really should read Max Vision's 2 articles before you comment more. Even if you don't agree with

I understand it's human nature to be frustrated and become more vocal when your holdings doesn't move the
way you want, and I've done the same when LL was down, but we can all at least try to be as informed as
possible.


It seems to me that many of your last comments were on aspects that had been discussed and disproved, by
many more critical minds that don't have positions on LL, or even bears. To revisit these topics with only non-
factual statements seem like a waste of social resources.

@ericlee06 Some Rules of investing wisdom from Benjamin Graham, Buffett and Munger,


- The stock doesn't know you own it. 
- You are neither right nor wrong if the market agree or disagree with you... 
- You can make a lot of money invest in great companies, they are not many. 
- We do not acquire ability to clear 7 footer but know how to avoid it


$LL is too far away from great companies and it looks like they "might be" knowingly poisoning their
customers. If you check the history, there are people hold Enron stock till the last day.

The housing market is improving and dollar rising. If LL is buying from China the increase in cost for the product to be
CARB-2 certified will be mitigated by the rise of dollar vs. yuan. I think a large activists investor will buy shares, take a
board seat and stabilize the image and bring them into compliance with safety standards. This will drive shorts out
and the price up.

I clicked publish by accident before I finished my post. Tilson and Ackman talk about, more or less, an unfolding
negative death spiral. The problem is they themselves are trying to engineer the negative death spiral and profit
directly from it. They spend an incredible amount of time, energy and (sometimes) money to spread their thesis.


Apparently, since they disclose that they are short, in their minds it doesn´t matter what they say or do since they are
providing a public service. They feel so confident and righteous in their beliefs it does not matter what other facts or
viewpoints are presented or, perhaps more importantly, what information they don´t know, have not bothered to
investigate or can´t possibly even know.


It does not matter to what length they will go or what strategies will be employed to make their ¨truth¨ be heard and
believed. If they hear contrary view points they dig in even more. Instead of taking the advice of their investment idol
(can´t argue this choice) Buffett who talks about being patient and letting the sometimes erratic Mr. Market work in
your favor they have taken it upon themselves to create the market between now and something like a year or two
out. I think many of us have figured out an easier and more honest ways to make good returns.

While I respect Mr. Tilson's wish to spend his time on something else, there is the risk that his call for questions to be
directed at his inbox, as opposed to posting as public discussion may be perceived as a tactic to distract those who
disagree with him.


I inquired Mr. Tilson earlier (3/24), about his connection to the ongoing GCM/Sunshine Park LLC suit against LL. I've
given Mr. Tilson the courtesy of waiting a reasonable time for him to respond, which he never did. So here's my
question:


Dear Mr. Tilson,


I appreciate your effort of answering the questions that many of us have had.


Would you consider provide further transparency and give us some information about your connection to GCM, and
its joint plaintiff Sunshine Park LLC? Lumber Liquidators had claimed that GCM and Sunshine Park LLC are
motivated by short sellers, but Sunshine Park LLC had remained silent through the trial. Do you know anything about
who is behind this entity?


Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your answer. Sincerely,

Hi Paul,


I appreciate that LL can go up (or down) on most anything.


My looking at the announcement doesn't seem to be good or bad news for anyone .. yet.


Certainly it is good news in the respect that it will end a lot of confusion and make it uniform across the states.


But it does not seem to give anything , yet, that favors LL, or anyone else.


First, the EPA appears to be suggesting that stricter 3rd party certifier rules are on their way. If there is any
truth to the accusations of "cheating" by LL's factory, it should clean that up. But, there goes LL's margin. If
there is no "cheating" it helps. But then again, if there's no "cheating", everything will, in time, go LL's way,
anyway.


Second, incorporated by reference, is an application to the EPA to adopt CARB's guidelines as the standard.
Now, who knows if this will happen, but I would think that it would close the door on LLs wish list.


We won't really know much of anything until they actually enact something, but I cant see anything for LL to
rejoice over.

isolate those who seem to have an agenda from those who project honest opinions and evaluations. In the case of
LL, from prior knowledge of the founder and his principles, I am confident that nothing dishonest has been intended
and every effort has been and will be made to provide a safe and satisfactory product to customers. LL operates on a
