Bail From TrueCar Before This Lemon Gets Totaled

Summary


TrueCar is a low quality lead gen business that is poised to plummet – we see 85%
downside.


Business momentum has meaningfully decelerated since the company went public.


Mounting competitive forces will hinder TRUE’s ability to maintain pricing and
expand into new verticals.


The CEO was recently at a conference and provided investment/expense guidance
that potentially contradicts guidance from the earnings call and which suggests a
guide down may occur in 2015.


In our view, TrueCar management appears to be hyper-focused on supporting
TRUE’s stock price and their tone on the 4Q call was troubling.


Whenever we analyze and research companies, we always think it is important to give
credit where credit is due. That's why we'd like to start off this note by congratulating
TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE) for publishing 22 press releases since the beginning of 2015
(as of 3/1/15). This is no easy feat - there have been fewer than 40 trading days so far this
year, meaning that TrueCar has managed to provide investors with a press release every
2 trading days… what an incredible accomplishment!


Without these press releases, how else would investors know that "Owen Wilson's voice
[is] to be featured in TrueCar commercials," and that "TrueCar TV ads featuring Owen
Wilson as the 'voice' of the brand [are] now live." It must have been a slow news month
over at TrueCar if they had to press release on Owen Wilson's voice twice. Perhaps soon
the company will provide us with timely updates on what CEO Scott Painter ate for lunch
(we hope Chipotle, Yum!).


Sometimes we can't help but wonder if TRUE management thinks that TRUE's stock
value is based on a multiple of "press releases" rather than on a multiple of earnings. With
the stock sporting a $1.4B valuation despite generating $48M of GAAP net losses in 2014,
it certainly seems as if TRUE's valuation is grounded in nothing but hot air! Famed short

seller Jim Chanos was once quoted as saying "the biggest mistake people make is being
co-opted by management." So while we mention these press releases in jest, we are
always wary of companies that bombard investors with irrelevant information.


With almost a year of public company results under its belt, we thought it was a good time
to dissect, and analyze TrueCar's business model, financial results, and current business
momentum in detail.


Egregious valuation and aggressive addbacks


TrueCar currently sports an enterprise value of ~$1.4B, which puts the company at the
heroic valuation of ~7x 2014 revenue. The company generated 48M of GAAP net losses
in 2014, and managed to turn a whole $10M of "adjusted EBITDA." Examples of some
add backs that turned almost 50M of losses into 10M of "EBITDA" include a whopping
$29M of stock based compensation and $10M of "warrant expense."


TRUE's add back of warrant expense it pays to USAA struck us as being very aggressive.
In the absence of this add back, TRUE would not have even generated any "adjusted"
EBITDA in 2014. While we do not necessarily agree with the practice of adding back
employee stock-based compensation to earnings, we acknowledge that it has become
standard practice at most public firms today. However, last we checked, USAA is not an
employee of TrueCar. In fact, USAA is a "supplier" of TrueCar, sending leads TrueCar's
way, and in exchange receiving payment from TrueCar for generating those leads. So we
find TRUE's practice of adding back USAA warrant expense to be particularly aggressive
from an accounting perspective.


A simple analogy would be a lemonade maker saying - "sorry, even though I'm in the
business of buying lemons to make lemonade, I'm going to have to add back the cost of
lemons I buy… because… why not?" Perhaps this is why the CFO of TrueCar was
recently featured in a WSJ article about "tailored accounting at new IPOs" (by the way -
how press hungry do you have to be to voluntarily give a sound bite in an article with the
headline "Tailored Accounting at IPOs Raises Flags"?). We are somehow not surprised
the company did not issue a press release on that article.


Signs of momentum slowing in two simple charts:


While the sell side is quick to point to TRUE's revenue growth as a sign of health in its
business model, we see two glaring red flags that any growth investor should be laser
focused on.

First, despite a massive blitz of national TV advertising over the past year, unique visits to
TRUE's website dipped sequentially in 4Q for the first time since 2Q12. This was also
despite a very robust and healthy auto market in 4Q14 (auto sales were up mid-teens in
4Q14 y/y). This was a meaningful change from trend and cannot be explained away by a
weak market for autos. And the seasonality argument does not work either - 4Q13 saw
higher UVs than 3Q13 and TV ads had not even been blown out yet. We hope that the
company is not relying on the "voice" of Owen Wilson to fix this alarming trend.


TRUE Unique Visits

While management quickly dismissed this dip, claiming that the company focuses on the
quality of its website traffic and its conversion rates rather than on the number of visits to
its website, again we remind readers to avoid being co-opted by management. At this life
stage of the company and in a healthy and robust auto market, one would expect unique
visit growth to be humming along very nicely given all the investment TrueCar is making
into sales & marketing (the company spent $129M on S&M in 2014). If TrueCar was
really disrupting the way people buy autos and becoming a "way of life" for car
buyers as we are expected to believe, the unique visitation momentum would
certainly not be turning negatively sequentially after only 3 quarters as a public
company and in the middle of an incredibly robust auto sales cycle.

growth stagnates or inflects. Pandora's stock price has been hammered since its
engagement metrics began to show signs of slowing over the course of 2014. See below:

Second, we point readers to a key metric that has gone overlooked by sell side analysts
covering this stock. This metric is the unit growth (monetized leads) per franchise dealer.
Why is this metric relevant? Because ultimately, TrueCar gets paid by dealers. Despite
management throwing out hundreds of different TAM metrics that end with "Billion" or

"Trillion" and creating confusion around how TRUE actually makes money, let's keep
things simple and remember that the vast majority of TRUE revenues today come from
dealers.


So in order to grow revenues, TRUE needs to either add new dealers, or generate greater
volumes from its existing dealer network. Here, the TRUE growth trajectory tells a story of
a business that is rapidly losing momentum and running out of steam:


Source: Our analysis/estimates (using average of prior quarter/current quarter franchise
dealer count and unit count all derived from TRUE public filings)


TRUE has added roughly the same amount of franchise dealers each year (its franchise
dealer growth has been running in the mid to high-20%s growth range for several
quarters). So the trend in units per franchise dealer above cannot be explained away by
claiming that it takes time for new dealers to ramp volumes. Instead, the chart above can
be explained by two factors. Either the new franchise dealers TRUE is adding are far less
productive than its historical franchise dealer network suggesting it has already penetrated
its best dealers and incremental returns will suffer (i.e. it is expanding into lower traffic
dealers/lower quality dealers), or it is simply seeing a deceleration in terms of customer
usage of TrueCar certificates. Both points are strongly negative for TRUE as they point to
deterioration in the growth trajectory of the company.


Keep in mind that the top-line algorithm for TRUE growth is simply: growth in franchise
dealers plus growth in units per average franchise dealer plus growth in monetization.
TrueCar has been able to add dealers at a robust clip for the past several quarters, which
5/23/2018 Bail From TrueCar Before This Lemon Gets Totaled - TrueCar, Inc (NASDAQ:TRUE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2963216-bail-from-truecar-before-this-lemon-gets-totaled 6/30


meaningfully supported top-line growth.


And this "dealer growth trap" is what we believe will cause the great experiment
that is TrueCar to ultimately fail.


The "Dealer Growth Trap" in a Chart (Illustrative):


There is simply a functional limitation to how many dealers TrueCar can add to the
TrueCar network without making itself irrelevant within its network! Each incremental
dealer that comes onto the network reduces the value of the TrueCar network for the
existing dealers on the network. In a hypothetical world in which every dealer joined
TrueCar and competed by dropping prices, the advantage of being part of the TrueCar
network would diminish to zero and no dealer would ever be willing to pay $300 for
TrueCar's leads. The added fee for a lead would have no value in a world of perfect
competition. In this world, every dealer offers the same price, so consumers would be
indifferent between dealers and would simply go to their nearest dealer. In this
hypothetical world, dealers would obviously also hate TrueCar as TrueCar would
effectively force industry profits to zero.


Clearly, this state of the world cannot happen - the last time TrueCar threatened the
profitability of dealers, the company almost died. This speaks to how fragile this
business model is - a company that was left for dead back in 2012 is now sporting a
cool $1.4B valuation despite still being economically unproven. So TrueCar has to be
very careful at this juncture in managing its growth as it needs to continue to be relevant
within its existing dealer network.

With its units per dealer rapidly decelerating as we outline above (and actually inflecting
negatively in 4Q), the other levers TRUE can use to juice growth include boosting
monetization (and as we discuss below, this is very unlikely given TRUE is already a bad
deal for dealers in our opinion), or adding more dealers (the economic logic of this is
unsound as discussed above). The laws of economics are going to cause an abrupt
halt to TrueCar's revenue growth rates, which in turn will cause investors to
massively reevaluate the company's current valuation.


Today, TrueCar currently has ~8,500 franchise dealers, representing almost 30% of total
franchise dealers in the United States. We believe that TRUE management has generally
talked about getting to ~10,000 franchise dealers over the course of time, so we think they
are already coming up on their ceiling in terms of new dealer growth. Their commentary
on the 4Q14 earnings call said as much, with the CFO subtly acknowledging the laws of
economics by saying that "obviously as the network grows, the overall growth rate in the
network slows."


Management is trying to make the claim that all is well and healthy in terms of organic
growth trends within the existing dealer network, however the chart we laid out above
shows that units per average dealer has decelerated from ~56% y/y growth back in 3Q13
to only 12% y/y growth in 4Q14. Investors need to be very mindful of the underlying
volume growth at franchise dealers compared to overall top-line growth. In 4Q14, units per
dealer were up only 12% versus the transaction segment top-line grew 42%. Dealer count
grew 28% y/y in 4Q14 so drove the bulk (~70%) of the top line growth in the quarter.
Given the laws of economics we described above, top-line growth over time will rapidly
converge to the level of underlying franchise dealer unit growth. As of today, that is
running at 12% y/y, well shy of the >30% growth rates management has guided the Street
towards in 2015.


The chart below provides a summary of why TrueCar is potentially already a questionable
value proposition for any dealer. According to TrueCar itself, the average discount that a
TrueCar.com customer receives relative to MSRP is ~10-11%. The average customer
walking into a dealership pays around an 8% discount to MSRP (at this point in human
history, everyone knows to pay less than MSRP at a dealer - and if you didn't know that,
shame on you!). Therefore, the average TrueCar.com customer results in around $781 of
gross margin compression for a dealer. The TrueCar.com customer also results in a
charge of $299 that the dealer must pay to TrueCar for the lead. In other words, TrueCar
effectively adds $1,080 to dealer expenses based on our math.

It would take a massive increase in volumes (better inventory turns) or a massive
reduction in other costs to justify that type of margin compression. Keep in mind that a
dealer's gross profit per new car is often well below $1,000 per car - so the TRUE deal
already appears to be a potentially money losing venture for the dealer. TRUE
management claims that this $1,080 investment is a long run good deal for dealers, with
dealers having the opportunity to make this and more back over time by improving
inventory turns and cutting sales commissions to floor staff. We disagree. In our view, the
dealer is going to need to "make back" some of these losses elsewhere, and we worry
that this means consumers that think they are getting a great price are ending up losing
out on other sides of the deal (trade value, F&I, etc.).


We spoke with a number of dealers who told us that TrueCar leads end up being major
money losers for their businesses. Therefore, we question the value proposition for
dealers, and we certainly doubt that the company can continue to expand its network to
more dealers without facing pressure on the fees it charges. In other words - we see
pricing pressure on the horizon and at the very least, seriously question how the company
can drive monetization up further.


Perhaps this comment from a dealer helps illustrate the problems dealers are already
seeing with TrueCar:

The Value Proposition to Consumers


While not the focus of this research, we did want to point out that the TrueCar value
proposition to consumers is also dubious. This blogger put together a rather thoughtful
piece that talks about TrueCar and how it's pricing has evolved over time. In short, the
blogger shows that after TrueCar changed its pricing practices following dealer backlash,
deals to consumers are far less attractive than they used to be. Therefore, this blogger's
view (and we tend to agree) is that TrueCar ends up serving as a typical annoying lead

gen internet company - you provide your information, and suddenly you are bombarded
and harassed by dozens of calls and emails from dealers trying to sell you a car. We don't
know about you, but we absolutely despise when this happens!


In this regard, TrueCar's model today is really no different than any other lead gen
business model given that the pricing is not as compelling as it used to be. Just take a
quick trip to TrueCar.com and read the fine print at the bottom of the page - TrueCar.com
only offers a "Target Price" - which is not an advertised price but rather an "example of
what you can reasonably pay". Furthermore, the company claims on its website that
between April 1, 2014 and June 30, 2014, the annual estimate savings of MSRP
presented by TrueCar Certified Dealers to users of TrueCar was ~$3,221. For a company
that prides itself on its data & analytics abilities, we were wondering why that savings
figure is not more up to date and why that data is based on such a narrow window of time.
We are also wondering why it is buried at the bottom of the website. For a company that
believes "truth and transparency is a better business model," we would think that a key
metric such as average savings a customer can achieve would be prominently featured in
the middle of the landing page, rather than 3/4th down the page with a footnote caveat.

In our view, the value proposition to consumers is loose and obscure - the consumer does
not know what price she is paying before she goes into the showroom and has no
guarantee that the car she wants will even be there. These screen shots (which are
admittedly biased) help elucidate the aspect of the model described by the blogger:

Competitive Pressures Mounting


Competition to TrueCar is mounting rapidly. First of all, we saw that General Motors, a
powerhouse in the auto space, has already launched its own version of TrueCar for its
dealer network. The cost of GM's offering: FREE for dealers. We are surprised this
article did not make headlines. Maybe GM needs to hire TRUE's crack PR team to help
get more distribution of its major company events!


GM is doing this as a service to its dealerships. This is a no-brainer in our opinion. OEs
are very focused on keeping their dealer networks happy and healthy, and offering them a
free lead gen business is a great idea in our opinion. Furthermore, GM's launch of this
product also speaks to how low the barriers to entry in this space are. The GM report

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2963216-bail-from-truecar-before-this-lemon-gets-totaled 13/30


suggests that they were able to build this product in-house rapidly. The company has
already signed up 1,800 of their 4,300 dealers, and has already helped sell 15,000
vehicles within one year of launching. For context, TrueCar.com generated just over
230,000 vehicle sales this year. However, GM is just one OE in the context of dozens, so
its 15,000 1st year milestone is actually quite noteworthy. GM's ability to replicate TRUE's
business model speaks to the simplicity of TrueCar's technology, its lack of pricing power,
and the lack of any moat around its business. Not only that, but GM's product has better
conversion rates than any other 3rd party product. It seems like the real disruptor here is
GM!


GM said it worked with dealers to give them an alternative. Unlike the third-party
sites, Shop-Click-Drive resides on the dealer's Internet platform, and it is free for
them to use. The close rate for Shop-Click-Drive is higher too-30%, compared with
at best 22% at third party sites, according to Ms. Carney. So far, about 1,800 of GM's
4,300 dealers have agreed to participate in the program, she said. She declined to
discuss how the program's margins compare to those of traditional sales channels.
In its first year of operation, Shop-Click-Drive helped sell about 15,000 new vehicles.


On the used car vehicle side, TRUE has talked up potential for beta testing a trade
product this year and launching more fully in 2016. We note that venture capital interest in
this space has been incredibly robust, and we see the potential for near-term profits in this
space as being highly constrained as a result. Beepi, Carlypso, and Shift all raised
gigantic sums of money recently and have created a very challenging competitive
environment for TrueCar.


The Red Flags from the Earnings Call


We were struck by the tone on the 4Q14 call. Given TrueCar's trading multiple and our
experience in growth stocks that trade at sky-high valuations, we believe that the market
expected a sizeable revenue beat. In our opinion, management appeared aware of this
point, and struck a defensive tone on the recent earnings call. We think it is important to
not only analyze numbers, but to also analyze what management is saying, and
management's word choice. Here are some comments from the call that caught our
attention.


Painter Comments:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2963216-bail-from-truecar-before-this-lemon-gets-totaled 14/30


Our take: The GM article above seems to suggest otherwise


I want to be clear that management is extremely confident in our near-to medium-
term ability to precisely manage and forecast our business


Our take: In our experience, lead gen businesses are notoriously volatile and difficult to
forecast… let's be clear, this is the exact opposite of a contracted revenue business - even
their subscription products are very short-dated in nature.


Our results are very intentional…


Our take: Well we would certainly hope that they were not unintentional!


CFO Comments - Lots of Donts and Buts


Don't get too distracted with UV growth


Our take: In our experience, a CFO telling us what not to get distracted about is always a
red flag


Data revenues were slightly below some of the analyst models… but don't worry
about it


Our take: Again, telling investors what not to worry about is always a red flag.


Obviously, as the network grows, the overall growth rate in the network slows. But
that's okay…


Our take: when a growth company that trades on a revenue multiple on the hopes of one
day generating positive net income talks about slowing growth being "okay", we always
raise our eyebrows.


And perhaps our all-time favorite red flag from the earnings call - the classic "our guidance
is back-end loaded" comment. In our experience, these types of comments often point to
elusive growth that is based on the hope that weakening trends can be solved with a Hail
Mary pass in the final seconds of the game:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2963216-bail-from-truecar-before-this-lemon-gets-totaled 15/30


Note that we believe our revenue will be slightly more back-end loaded in 2015 than
in prior years


We worry that management is more concerned with how their performance metrics shook
out relative to "analyst models" instead of being concerned about how to generate
healthier levels of profitability at their young company. Ultimately, we think management
teams should first focus on being operators and business builders rather than
hitting refresh repeatedly on Yahoo Finance to see their latest real time stock price.


We think management would be well served to worry less about its stock price and more
about its business model. Therefore, we do not see Mr. Painter's recent stock purchase of
70k shares (which was of course press released) as a sign of health in this company.
Rather, we see this as a sign of Mr. Painter trying to instill confidence in a stock that is
setting up to be highly vulnerable this year. This is not the first time we have seen the
CEO of a new public company take a position in his stock only to be proven wrong a few
quarters later.


We find it highly irregular for a public company to put out a press release that "corrects"
analyst estimates. We wonder how much time management is spending "correcting" or
worrying about analyst estimates versus actually trying to drive profitability at TRUE:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2963216-bail-from-truecar-before-this-lemon-gets-totaled 17/30


We're also very unsure about whether the guidance management recently provided the
Street is realistic. We wonder whether management simply provided an in-line guide in
order to prevent further bleeding in its stock price. In January 2015, Mr. Painter is on the
record at the Automotive World Congress claiming the following:


TrueCar will invest $150 million in developing new products this year. The company
also plans to spend $100 million on consumer advertising this year to endorse the
app and its brand, Automotive News reported last week.


Management guided to $285M of revenue in 2015 at the midpoint, and ~$28M of adjusted
EBITDA, implying ~$257M of total expenses ex-D&A (285 - 28 = total expenses ex-D&A,
given interest and taxes are likely zero here). However, based on the comment above, it
appears that Painter has claimed TrueCar is going to spend $250M on just new product
development and consumer advertising this year - accounting for $250M of the total
$257M expense ex-D&A budget baked into TRUE guidance. In other words, that math
implies TrueCar has built in no other expenses - potentially ignoring
COGS/overhead/G&A/other pieces of sales & marketing beyond consumer advertising.
For readers who are interested, we note that Goldman Sachs published a research report
on 2/17/15 (a 4Q Preview note) in which it also flagged the potential for higher
investment/expenses as a result of Painter's conference comments.


We suppose some of the investment is going to come through capex rather than through
the P&L (this is a neat trick we have seen a few recent IPOs pull so that R&D spend
expense can flow through D&A and be "added back" to "adjusted" EBITDA). Nonetheless,
we think Painter may have contradicted his own guidance provided on the earnings call by
claiming he is going to spend $250M on R&D/consumer ads. We therefore wonder if a
massive guide down to earnings is on the horizon… based on TRUE's expense levels
described above, the company would be on track to neutralize any incremental revenue it
generates this year through increased spending. And if our thesis on revenue deceleration
is accurate, then the company's spending coupled with decelerating revenue could result
in very negative EBITDA levels this year.


We think it is always important to put these things in context by auditing management's
long-term track record of success. During our research, we came across a previous
Painter startup called CarsDirect.com. According to reports, the company raised $350M of
VC in 1998 with the purpose of "cutting out the middleman" and selling cars directly to
consumers. This article suggests that CarsDirect's business model involved purchasing
vehicles from dealers then selling them to consumers - an arrangement that this article

says "has built in disadvantages." According to reports, Painter resigned as CEO of the
company a year after raising the capital due to pressure from investors. He then went on
to start a company called Build-to-Order which, as the name implies, was an auto
manufacturing start-up that was going to design, build, and then sell custom order cars to
consumers through the internet. According to reports, that venture failed.


The LA Times article indicates that "Painter's greatest asset may be his knack for
salesmanship." Given the current valuation of TRUE versus its current earnings, we tend
to agree.


Summary


For the reasons outlined above, we think TRUE revenue is going to decelerate materially.
We also think TRUE is potentially setting up to spend far more this year than what it
initially told the Street in its guidance. We think this stock is poised to plummet.


An appropriate comp to TRUE is Bankrate (NYSE:RATE), a similar internet lead gen
business which currently trades at ~12x EBITDA. Given our uncertainty as to how much
EBITDA TRUE actually generates in 2015, we think the value of the company is
somewhere between $120M (10x FY14E EBITDA) and $360M (10x FY15E guidance
EBITDA). This values TRUE at around $1.50 - $4.50/share, representing ~85% downside
from current levels. The catalyst for re-rating is a material deceleration in TRUE top-line
growth that we expect will occur this year AND/OR a material downward revision to TRUE
earnings as a result of higher than expected expenses. A third catalyst we have not
explored in this report is a slowdown/inflection in US auto sales, which would also put
tremendous pressure on TRUE's volumes and pricing power.


As a result, we think TRUE is one of the most compelling short opportunities in the market
for 2015.

Thanks for the article Friendly Bear. 
Kind of reminded me of a similar SA story on TREE which continues to hold up well. 
Shorting can be a tough deal. 
Any idea why the founder recently bought 70K shares? 
Best of luck!

I don't recall ever reading a press release about a CEO buying stock prior to TRUE. I think it speaks to the
hype machine.


I do think it is worth noting that in the foot notes of the form 4 of the CEO foot note #2


2. Includes 1,409,332 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock pledged as collateral to secure a line of credit.


This is out of the 1,884,563 shares he is listed as owning, or 75% of his stock he has borrowed against.


Got to keep that stock up or possibly get a margin call?


Strange.

YES, it absolutely speaks to the hype machine. Does anyone anywhere know of a business ever run by Scott
Painter that made actual operating profit? Best I can tell Painter's specialty is stock plays based more on
sizzle than steak.


I'd feel better if there was evidence he had actually owned and operated a successful car dealership before
he set out to transform auto retail.

Thanks for the article. I believe your diluted share count is a bit low however. I have ~88MM fully diluted S/O, and a
current fully diluted market cap of $1.73B ($1.58B EV).


Also, in terms of nearer-term catalysts, we have 24.7M shares that just came unlocked in February and another
33.4M shares that come unlocked in 10 days (Mar 12). I believe the recent insider buying and press release touting it
are timed specifically to pump the stock ahead of a forthcoming secondary. We know from the buying/PR that Painter
& Upfront Ventures won't be sellers, but I'd assume other the other big investors (USAA, Capricorn, Anthem, Vulcan)
will be as they were in the November secondary. I'd note that Painter and Upfront were the only 5% holders to not sell
in November so hearing that they aren't sellers isn't exactly surprising new information. I believe we'll see a deal soon
once we're past March 12 in which the other 5% holders as well as some other execs sell. This obviously isn't a core
element to short thesis but does represent a very near term catalyst IMO.

The stakeholders writing their checks--the dealers--are economically motivated to see TRUE fail. Terrible sign for the
long term prospects of the company. The packaging may look nice and shiny, but at its core, TRUE is just another
lead gen business. These business models almost never live up to the hype, and with this promotional management
team, there sure is a lot of hype! More room to fall...

GOOD READ. REALLY. I like this statement the most:) "Sometimes we can't help but wonder if TRUE management
thinks that TRUE's stock value is based on a multiple of "press releases" rather than on a multiple of earnings." 
A lot of qualitative assessment for why TRUE Inc, is fundamentally weak and good candidate for sell short. 
In my post on TRUE Inc I reach the same conclusion even though I have started from bull case perspective, and even
then I did get a value estimate for the stock of 10$.

ANY dealer will meet or beat a TrueCar price. If a consumer registers with TC, BUT then goes to a NON
TrueCar dealer, that dealer can meet the TC price WITHOUT having to pay the $300. fee to TC.


How does it benefit a consumer to increase the cost to the dealer of the vehicle they buy?

It's like asking a customer to pay $200-$300 just to be told the 'best' price they can get. I agree that could help
them save money if they are not a savvy buyer, so one can make a case for TRUE's value. But there are far
less expensive ways to become informed of 'fair price' and just as simple as using TRUE's service, if not
easier.

Hey Michael, just curious, can you name a few? Might be looking at a car. Though I hate to lose so much on

I have used Edmunds.com in the past, combined with some simple negotiating skills with at least 2 dealers to
compare, with fairly good results for a new car. KBB.com for a used car. Both to make sure I was in the right
price range. I have not tried or compared these to TRUE.


Or my favorite last time for a newer used car was using an individual car dealer who took us to the biggest
local car auction, let us pick out 2-3 cars we liked (out of literally thousands), and then they bid on them up to
our max price, and charged us a fixed fee on top of the auction price (about $800 for a $14,000 car if I recall
correctly). The dealer then handled all the license, paperwork, etc., for us. I wanted to save the 'drive off the
lot' premium. 2012 Nissan Altima with only half warranty gone at the time for far lower than any local dealer
was offering it ($1,500 less than the lowest), even with the markup. The personal dealer was already going to
the auction for their own dealership, so little extra time for them. The $800 may seem lost, but remember we
were getting the car for the same price the local dealers get it at auction (or maximum $100 more since that is
the auction increment), plus the $800 markup, which any dealer would have charged far more markup. We
got a much larger selection (the same selection ALL the local dealers have) and we knew what fair price was.
It took about half a day, which I've never gotten out of a dealership without 4 hours of my time lost, only far
more frustrating at the dealership with limited options.

I have used TRUE just to see what prices are running nationally. There are no TC dealers in this area for Audi, BMW,
Mercedes, etc. Some of the alleged sales prices are just ridiculous. In one instance the alleged lowest sales price was
over $3k below invoice AND holdbacks. No one is getting this kind of price unless it is on a demo, in which case I
don't consider this to be a true "new" car even if it has never been titled to an individual. Not to mention I enjoy the
negotiations in buying a new car. It feels good to get what I consider to be a better than average deal. lol

Facebook was the 'disruptor' for old media.


TRUE might just be the 'disruptor' for car manufacturing and assembly not just car dealership.


Of course they are also trying many different types of disruptors such as 3D Printing for manufacturing few items of
parts instead of mass manufacturing specific parts of whole assemblies. There is also the aspiring 'disruptor' for
mobile phones and smartphones with users being able to assemble the parts they want like PCs of old - which was
the true disruptor for mainframes.


-------


If TRUE is as bad or worse than Facebook during the latter's IPO; then why not buy after it collapsed. The car
manufacturing and distribution industries is a huge and very old market being disrupted by TSLA and perhaps TRUE.
It's called 'Venture Capitalism' full of risks and potential great rewards too only that TRUE has already IPO'ed.

But that's the thing, people are getting those prices. I am the go to person in my area to shop for cars, I now send
people straight to Truecar. It costs nothing, and it's instant. People absolutely hate negotiating, and $1,500 off (at low)
is amazing to some people. Print it, take it in, sign it away. Instant $$ and time saver


03 Mar 2015, 05:27 PM


Marek
I do think the data are the same and allow dealers to achieve the price points they were going to
regardless...you just feel better because you think you gained something. The savings are virtually the same
regardless of pricing service you choose, they are getting the same data from the same ultimate source. The
gig is that you just think you are getting something extra...and that is due to good marketing, which can
change things in a jiffy. The real winner is the financier doing those 84 month loans to people with nearly no
equity and the lowest of the low credit quality buyers, and getting the consumer to take on that wonderfully
lucrative (for the seller) depreciation, instead of buying something already fairly depreciated. Works as long as
the advertising is effective, house of cards otherwise at staggeringly rich valuation. Can they keep the plates
spinning, that's the question, and also will they keep from diluting off with secondaries. Pretty rich here.

SOME people hate negotiating. But not enough to construct a vialbe business model around them. It has

I agree, I see no value proposition here, just because Jack got a deal last week doesn't mean I can get the same deal
this week. Anyway, every car vendor site has its own contact/bid mechanism now, car sites like Edmunds already did,
I've been using them for over 15 years! And the dealers are increasingly resistant to them anyway - they rolled over
like puppies when this started, around 1999! FWIW dealer bids are easy to get over the Internet and are much more
likely to be honored ... though you still will find many reasons to dicker, say about the value of your trade-in (or just
take that to CarMax for a better deal!).


This has looked to me like a pump and dump from the beginning, and I think the only reason this won't go to zero is if
they engineer a buyout/merge around two.

I think that part of the TRUE concept was also to aggregate and analyze customer profiles and sell this as useful
information to the dealers. This might have some small value but probably seemed a much better idea when TRUE
was conceived and begun, today it has largely been obsoleted by a plethora of "big data" analytic sources that track
anyone who even glances at a dealership or drives by too slowly.

Want to give me an apple analogy next? Find the one that worked vs the 1000 that didn't. There are at least 4

Great piece - I wanted to write this one up myself. I'm a hugely loyal USAA customer but I think they've missed here. I
used the service a few weeks back and it was just awful - an overwhelming number of calls and emails and, truthfully,
I wasn't exactly sure what the benefit was. I haven't had a chance to research the data the way you have but TRUE is
on the top of my short research list.

I'm a USAA member and I'm appalled at the crap they are allowing or the actual terms of their agreement with
TC. google dealer dropped in VA for not financing deals with USAA. Basically Honda offered better rates and
saved the buyer money. But based on terms of the lead agreement with USAA and TC they have some
number of deals that should be triggered via Usaa platform and financed there. what a scam. So USAA is
doing what for its member base? I think an investigation needs to be launched on this relationship.

Skimmed the article since I don't really care about the company. They have a great product though. I recently used
them to buy a new truck, and it was the most painless car buying experience I've ever encountered (and I've been
buying new vehicles fairly regularly for over 40 years). Oh, and naturally, a killer price to boot. The few people who
actually buy a car these days should use this product, and I recommend their service every chance I get. Contrary to
what seems to be the thrust of this article though, I see their problems in non-business areas. For one thing, we now
live in a "payment" nation, with the continued (and still growing) popularity of renting (leasing), and the advent of long
term car loans. In both of these instances, the consumer really doesn't care what the car cost (and many don't even
know), all they want to know is "what's the payment?". Regardless, as opposed to Ford (great company, "meh" toward
the product), True Car stands with a great product, and I'm ambivalent toward the company. I do hope they stick
around though.

You make some fair points, but much of your argument is flawed. You also skew the facts to support your argument.
Not unethical, just scummy. Allow me to refute. 1) You cut and paste an online comment from Tommy McClung of
CarWoo! TrueCar drove CarWoo out of business in July 2014 and Tommy joined TrueCar as VP of Product. Check
out his linkedin profile to verify this, which is public information. 2) You also quote a section of a jalponik article on
TrueCar. I urge readers to read the whole article themselves, and read the OTHER comments at the bottom, which
are more positive in tone and outnumber the negative ones. 3) Finally, you quote a review from the website
TrustPilot.com. Trustpilot only has 29 reviews of True on it and you present the only negative review. The better
resource is eKomi, b/c it has many, many more reviews and is more widely used among the population. It has 2,568
reviews of True, or 89x the number of reviews. eKomi averages the reviews and rates Truecar 4.3 out of 5 stars. I
think the service is a great one for consumers, and dealers naturally hate it in general b/c they are middlemen being
disrupted. However, the valuation and multiples at these levels is admittedly high. Long True.

The evidence is clear. There have been numerous attempts to overhaul the auto retail business by opportunists who
capitalize on eager investors to make money on the concept while the reality of it crashes and burns.


Common sense tells one that the more TC dealers there are, the less value there is for each one. Further, dealers are
learning how to sell against TrueCar dealers.


Strip ALG, Zag, and USAA out of TC and see what you have left.

RE: "I saved around $6,500 on a $30,000 dodge."


You saved $^500 on a $30K Dodge only compared to a complete neophyte. Since Dodges come with consumer
rebates advertised on TV, you would have to be a complete dolt to have not "saved" most, if not all of that money.

5/23/2018 Bail From TrueCar Before This Lemon Gets Totaled - TrueCar, Inc (NASDAQ:TRUE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2963216-bail-from-truecar-before-this-lemon-gets-totaled 29/30


1. Entered a fake email address and phone number so i wouldn't have 5 dealers calling and emailing me 30 times a
day.  
2. Looked at the high / low of prices on recent "transactions" who knows if they are real or not.  
3. Brought the car right at below the mid range identified on true car without printing out a coupon. Probably still
overpaid but who really knows.


Not sure how this website/lead generator makes money for anyone based on my experience. Found the exact same
information on edmunds.


If you think you are getting a "deal" by printing out a coupon and driving 100 miles to the nearest "participating dealer"
you should probably go long this stock.


I will stay short

Gosh, Oh My!
TRUE is spending big time on advertising right now.


This will be their savior or undoing.

I'm having a hard time understanding how this company makes money, at least on any sustainable basis. Can
someone explain how this company can make more money on a transaction than it costs them to serve it?

a non
Good article, I just wish you explained the business model at the beginning of the article

My understanding is that they spend $500. for each $300 commission. We'll see how long that is sustainable.

yeah ruggles seems the company is starting to build momentum with all the new deals so covered the short position.
who knows where this goes but someone does and is driving the stock higher.
