“Strong Sell” Summary 
 
We are confident than ONP is a fraud.  Its purpose is to raise and misappropriate tens of millions 
of dollars.  
 
We believe that most to all of the $31.5 million (net of commissions, fees, and discounts) ONP raised 
from October 2009 through April 2010 has been misappropriated.  This conclusion is based on our 
investigation of the values of the assets that ONP purports to have purchased with the funds it raised. 
 
We have determined that ONP has overstated its fiscal 2008 revenue by 27 times, and its fiscal 2009 
revenue by approximately 40 times.  Our determination is based on a review of public records in China, 
onsite due diligence at ONP’s production facility, and contacts with ONP’s purported 10 largest 
customers. 
 
ONP overstates the values of its assets by at least 10 times.  ONP’s 2008 audited PRC balance sheet 
shows total net assets worth less than half of what it claimed in its 2008 Form 10-K.  Our further due 
diligence, which included contacting suppliers of comparable assets, indicates that ONP’s PRC financial 
statements further overstate its fixed asset values by approximately five times.  Thus the total 
overstatement in the SEC filings is around 10 times.  We corroborated these conclusions by having an 
expert analyze photographs and video of ONP’s production equipment.  Our onsite due diligence and 
interview with Chairman Liu shows that ONP overstates its inventory values by millions of dollars.  
 
This report includes photographs of ONP’s production equipment and inventory.   
 
Despite inflating the value of its inventory by at least several times, ONP’s inventory turns are far fewer 
than it reports. Once armed with knowledge of the poor state of ONP’s production equipment and 
processes, a comparison of ONP’s claimed inventory turnover to those of China’s industry leaders lays 
bare the overstatements.   
 
ONP overstates its gross margin by at least several hundred basis points.  We received a quotation from 
ONP for product.  Then, using data of industry production costs in China, we concluded that it would be 
impossible for ONP to generate the margins that it claims.  Once armed with knowledge of the poor state 
of ONP’s production equipment and processes, a comparison of ONP’s claimed gross margins to those of 
China’s industry leaders further lays bare the overstatements.

Approximately $30 Million Has Been Misappropriated since October 2009 
 
Most – if not all – of the $31.5 million (net of commissions, fees, and discounts) that ONP raised between 
October 2009 and May 2010 has been misappropriated.  ONP purported to raise these funds to finance the 
purchases of two groups of assets: a) used digital photo paper coating equipment for $13.6 million,1 and b) 
one new corrugating medium production line for $27.8 million.2  In the best case scenario, ONP paid less 
than $5 million total for both sets of assets, thereby leaving over $25 million unaccounted for.  We 
believe it is more likely that there have not been (nor will there ever be) any such equipment purchases; 
and, thus almost the entire amount of money has been misappropriated. 
 
March / April 2010 Raise and the Corrugating Medium Production Line 
 
Between April 6, 2010 and April 14, 2010, ONP raised a net amount of $26.9 million from investors in a 
private placement.3  On April 12th, 2010, ONP announced that it had “entered into a definitive equipment 
purchase agreement” to purchase one corrugating medium paper production line with annual capacity of 
360,000 tons for approximately US$27.8 million.4  The purported seller is Henan Qinyang First Paper 
Machine Ltd. (“Qinyang”).5  This implies that the money raised will be used to fund the equipment 
purchase. 
 
Little – if any – of the money raised will be spent on an equipment purchase.  Further, to the extent that 
ONP purchases this production line, the annual capacity will be well below 360,000 tons. 
 
We spoke with the purported seller of the equipment, Qinyang, and four other Chinese papermaking 
equipment manufacturers.  Qinyang told us that its highest capacity 5.6 m corrugating medium production 
line (the type ONP purports to have purchased) produces only 150,000 tons per year and costs 
approximately $4.4 million.  This stands in stark contrast to ONP’s contention that it is purchasing a 
single line from Qinyang that will produce 360,000 tons per year for a total price of $27.8 million. 
 
None of the other four companies makes a 5.6 m corrugating medium line that can exceed 200,000 tons 
per year.  Moreover, each company – including Qinyang – stated that no Chinese manufacturer makes 
such a line with an annual capacity in excess of 200,000 tons.  Finally, none of these companies sold lines 
for prices above $7.3 million.  The following table shows the companies contacted, their URLs, and the 
rough prices of their highest capacity 5.6 m corrugating medium production lines.  (Note that Qinyang is 
included in the list.)

million).

Thus, either ONP is purchasing a line (at far lower capacity than claimed) and misappropriating most of 
the $26.9 million; or, ONP is not purchasing any line and misappropriating all of the $26.9 million. 
 
October 2009 Raise and Digital Photo Paper Assets 
 
In October 2009, ONP raised a net amount of $4.9 million,6 of which $4.6 million was to be used as a 
down payment to purchase two digital photo paper coating lines purportedly owned by He Bei Shuang 
Xing Paper Co. Ltd. (“Shuang Xing”) for $13.6 million.7  However, our due diligence shows that Shuang 
Xing’s tangible assets were worth no more than a few hundred thousand dollars.  (We would not be 
surprised if ONP did not acquire these assets at all.) 
 
According to its most recent business license, Shuang Xing had only been capitalized with equity totaling 
$439,000.89  Not coincidentally, Shuang Xing’s 2008 audited financial statements show that its fixed 
assets had a total gross value of $439,000.10  The same statements show that the depreciated value of the 
fixed assets at the end of 2008 was only $387,000.   
 
Because Shuang Xing has a longstanding close relationship with ONP, it may be complicit in the fraud.  
On January 1, 2003, Shuang Xing leased space at ONP’s administrative headquarters for ten years.11  
ONP’s 2009 Form 10-K states that Shuang Xing’s former assets are located at ONP’s administrative 
offices.12

ONP claims to have hired a professional appraisal company to value the assets it acquired from Shuang 
Xing in order to ensure that the transaction price was fair.13  The appraiser is located in Bao Ding City, He 
Bei province (where ONP is located).14  Even in the most developed Mainland Chinese cities (Beijing, 
Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen), accounting and appraisal firms have difficulty managing the 
conflict between pleasing their clients and maintaining standards.  As we discuss in ONP’s Financial 
Statements Overvalue Assets by Tens of Millions of Dollars, assuming that there actually was an appraisal, 
this would be at least the second instance in which ONP has obtained an inflated appraisal. 
 
Because Shuang Xing’s assets were worth only approximately $400,000, to the extent that ONP actually 
acquired assets from Shuang Xing, it would leave at least $4 million unaccounted for. 
 
ONP Overstated 2008 Revenue by 27x 
 
ONP overstated its 2008 revenue by approximately 27 times.  Put another way, ONP’s actual revenue of 
$2.4 million was only 3.7% of the amount it reported in its Form 10-K.15  
 
There is a smoking gun that proves ONP overstated its 2008 revenue by 27 times.  The audited 2008 PRC 
financial statements for He Bei Oriental Paper Co. Ltd. (“HBOP”, which is ONP’s China operating 
subsidiary) show revenue of only $2.4 million (RMB 16,320,687.26).16  (ONP claims in its SEC filings 
that HBOP generated net revenue of $65.2 million.17)  As we discuss in Our Theory as to Why ONP’s 
Auditors Have Missed the Fraud, while many companies in the PRC underreport profits, they do so by 
inflating expenses.  Because of the way that the tax reporting system works in China, we can conceive of 
no way that ONP would be able to understate its revenue for tax purposes by 96.3% or $62.8 million.  
(On a related note, ONP paid only $45,350 in PRC taxes in 2008,18 which is much less than the $2.9 
million it claims to have paid.19) 
 
ONP Overstated 2009 Revenue by approximately 40x 
 
We do not yet know the exact amount of ONP’s revenue overstatement for 2009; but, we believe that 
ONP’s actual revenue grew little – if at all – from $2.4 million. Our January 5, 2010 site visit showed that 
ONP is operating at roughly the same scale as it was in 2008.  It exhibited almost no truck traffic or 
logistics activity.  We saw no sign that ONP’s claimed 600 workers exist.  Given that ONP claimed 
$102.1 million in 2009 revenue,20 we believe that the overstatement is approximately 40 times actual 
revenue.   


                                                      
13 November 25, 2009 Form 8-K, Exhibit 10.1 is the purported asset purchase agreement (dated November 25, 2009) 
with Shuang Xing.  The purported asset purchase agreement claims that an appraisal firm (where ONP is located) 
valued the assets at RMB 103.6 million ($15.1 million).

The Truck Stops Here 
 
Based on ONP’s claimed production and sales volume, there would be at least 100 trucks in and out of 
the factory gate on a typical day.  There would be trucks lined up waiting to load finished product and 
ship out.  There would be a sizable logistical support operation, with workers and equipment moving 
around busily.  This would be even more so on the day we visited, January 5, 2010 (the roads had 
reopened 24 hours earlier after a major snowstorm).   
 
However, during our 90-minute visit, there was shockingly little activity.  There was only one truck lazily 
idling with a full bed.  (It was clear to us that the truck was there for show.)   
 
Based on ONP’s claimed volume, there would be approximately 30 to 40 trucks of finished product 
leaving the factory gate on a typical day.  During our visit, Chairman Liu told us that ONP’s production 
capacity was then at 250,000 tons per year.  He also said that ONP was then operating at eighty-five 
percent of capacity.  Chairman Liu told us that ONP runs each line twenty-four hours per day (three 
shifts), 365 days per year.  Chairman Liu also told us that ONP has no finished goods warehouse and 
keeps no finished goods inventory (this contradicts the financial statements – see ONP Has Overstated 
Inventory Values by Millions of Dollars).  Rather, he said that customers pick up the paper as it comes out 
of production.  Therefore, HBOP would be shipping out 582 tons of paper per day at the time of our visit.   
 
582 tons of paper is 831 rolls.  One roll of 110 gram brown paper weighs approximately 700 kg 
(approximately 1,500 lbs.).  A typical truck will hold 20 to 30 rolls in its bed.  (A video taken by a 
correspondent for TheStreet.com during our visit and available online – discussed further in ONP’s 
Production Lines are Worth Only Hundreds of Thousands – Not 45 Million Plus Dollars – shows the one 
truck present during our visit fully loaded with 23 rolls in its bed.)  If the average truck left ONP with 25 
rolls, there would be an average of 33 fully loaded trucks leaving per day. 
 
There should be two to three incoming trucks fully loaded with paper fiber for each finished goods truck 
leaving.  According to industry experts who viewed photos and video of HBOP’s raw material stock, 
HBOP likely wastes twelve to fifteen percent of its brown paper stock – called “old corrugated container” 
or “OCC” – in the production process due to eliminating rejects, plastics, staples, glass, leather, sand, and 
other contaminants.  Incoming paper fiber shipments also contain air and water, and are not packed as 
efficiently as finished product.  Therefore, there would be about 60 to 120 trucks of fiber entering ONP’s 
gates each day. 
 
There would be a number of other trucks coming into the factory delivering chemicals for the pulping 
process, food for the claimed 600 workers, coal, clay, and additives.  Therefore, there would be at least 
100 trucks into and out of ONP on a typical day.  The level of activity needed to support the logistics of a 
paper mill generating the revenue that ONP claims would be substantial.  This is even more so on January 
5, 2010. 
 
In contrast, we saw shockingly little activity at the factory.  There was one truck that was lazily idling 
inside the factory gates (shown in the aforementioned video).  We did not witness a line of trucks being 
loaded, as one would expect to see at a paper mill cranking out over 800 large rolls of paper per day.  Nor
Muddy Waters, LLC ONP June 28, 2010  Page 7 of 30 


did we see incoming trucks.  We did not see any signs of the logistics support operation such a factory 
would require.  Moreover, the road on which the factory is located is a small country road that likely 
could not support anywhere near the truck traffic that a paper mill producing over one hundred thousand 
tons annually would require. 
 
Workers’ Paradise 
 
ONP claims to have 600 workers.21  In reality, it either has a one million dollar contingent labor liability, 
or it does not have nearly the number of workers it claims.  We think the latter is the case.  During our site 
visit, we did not see nearly the level of activity that would imply ONP employs 600 workers.  The 
dormitories could conceivably fit 600 workers if crammed in, but the buildings were dilapidated (replete 
with broken windows despite the bitterly cold weather) and looked largely unused.  Interestingly, 
Chairman Liu admitted that few of ONP’s workers have written labor contracts.  It would be surprising 
for a U.S.-listed company in China to employ so many workers without labor contracts today.  
 
On January 1, 2008 a new labor law went into effect in China.  One of the more discussed provisions of 
the law is the penalty for employers who do not conclude written labor contracts with their employees.  
Under the law, the penalty is one-month back wages (in addition to the wages already paid) for each 
month a worker has worked without a written contract, subject to a maximum penalty of 11 months of 
wages.22  In addition, after one year without a written contract, the employees will be deemed to be 
working under “open term” contracts,23 which are generally the least favorable type of contract from the 
employer’s perspective. 
 
We believe that this portion of the law is fairly well enforced in many parts of China.  In light of the 
downsides, we do not understand why a sizable employer would refuse to have written contracts with so 
many employees.  If ONP really has this many employees without contracts, we estimate that there is a 
contingent liability of approximately one million dollars.  But most signs instead point to ONP having 
nowhere near 600 workers. 
 
ONP’s Claims About its Top 10 Customers Support Our Fraud Conclusion 
 
The companies that ONP claims are its top 10 customers are mostly obscure, and thus difficult to perform 
due diligence on.  Nonetheless, we confirmed that ONP’s claims with respect to the purchasing volume of 
two of its 2008 top 10 customers are false – by a large margin, if not entirely.  Based on our due diligence 
(results are shown infra in this section), we believe that all but one of ONP’s top 10 2009 customers are 
too small (if they even exist) to buy the amount of product that ONP claims they do.  That ONP replaced 
80% of its 2008 top 10 customers in 2009, while still growing its overall sales volume 62.5% would be 
almost miraculous if true.  (It would also strongly indicate that ONP churns and burns its customers.)

It should be understood how a customer’s volume of paper purchases relates to its own sales volume.  A 
basic principle of manufacturing is to diversify your supply base so that you are not reliant on one 
supplier.  (Switching suppliers in the event of quality or delivery problems is costly and difficult, and the 
carrying cost on an idle business is substantial.)  Moreover, if purchasing significant volumes from a 
given supplier for the first time, it is likely that a given customer would be somewhat conservative with 
the percentage of paper it orders from the new supplier.  (This would be even more so if the supplier’s 
operation does not inspire confidence, as is the case with ONP – see The Value of ONP’s Production 
Lines is Greatly Overstated.)  Including other inputs and gross margin, a previously existing customer 
purchasing two million dollars of paper from ONP would most likely be generating at least six million 
dollars in annual revenue.   
 
We confirmed with two of the 2008 top 10 customers that ONP’s purported sales amounts to them were 
false by at least a very large amount – if not entirely.  Neither Baoding Dadi Colour Printing Co. Ltd. 
(“Dadi”)24 nor China Lucky Offset Group Integrated Services Co. Ltd. (“Lucky”)25 generate sales volume 
for their own companies approaching the amounts that ONP claims each purchased from it in 2008.  Dadi 
told us that its annual revenue is less than $1.5 million (RMB 10 million).  Lucky told us that the most 
revenue it ever generated in its history is $1.3 million.  Yet ONP claims that in 2008, each respectively 
purchased paper worth $2.7 million and $2.2 million. 
 
In China, a printing, publishing, or paper trading company generating six million or more dollars per year 
in revenue would be relatively large.  A company that large would almost always have a website, staff 
available to answer phones during working hours, and would usually be somewhat open in responding to 
questions about its sales volume and company size.  (It is in a supplier’s interest to ensure that it is 
matched with the right size customer – a customer too small is not worth the supplier’s time, a customer 
too big would not place orders after on site due diligence reveals the supplier’s true size.)   
 
The next page contains a table showing the results of our attempts to conduct due diligence on ONP’s 
purported top 10 2009 customers.

Our due diligence on the purported customers supports our fraud thesis in that a) in two 2008 cases, we 
confirmed that the purported purchasers were literally too small to purchase the amounts claimed; and, b) 
we are comfortable that for nine of the purported 2009 top 10 purchasers, it would be implausible to 
purchase from ONP in the volumes that ONP claims they did.   
 
At a glance, ONP’s claimed lists of top 10 customers and purchase volumes for 2008 and 2009 are 
suspicious in and of themselves.  ONP’s 2009 top 10 customer list changed eight of 10 customers from 
2008, while keeping constant the minimum threshold to make the top 10 roughly constant ($2.1 million).  
This means one of two mutually exclusive possibilities is true: a) ONP churns and burns its customers and 
miraculously finds new ones to make up for the lost volume (plus 62.5%); or, b) that ONP is lying about 
its sales volumes to these customers (which is the possibility we believe).   
 
Below is the list of ONP’s purported top 10 customers for 2008 and 2009.26

Muddy Waters, LLC ONP June 28, 2010 Page 11 of 30 


In committing this aspect of its fraud, ONP could choose to list larger companies for which it would be 
possible to purchase the volumes ONP claims; however, larger companies would be easier to contact, and 
with some relationship building efforts, likely to disclose that ONP’s claims of purchase volume are false.  
By sticking to a changing list of small companies, ONP (in a typical Chinese fashion) creates more 
misdirection and more stones to overturn – not to mention that the proverbial stones (purchasers) are 
better hidden by virtue of their obscurity.  Fortunately, Muddy Waters Research has the ability to hunt for 
such pebbles. 
 
ONP Overvalues its Assets by At Least 10x 
 
We estimate that ONP has overstated its asset values by at least ten times.  ONP’s 2008 audited PRC 
balance sheet shows total net assets worth less than half of what it claimed in its 2008 Form 10-K.  
However, we believe that even the PRC balance sheet values are greatly overstated.  We estimate that the 
true value of ONP’s PP&E is not more than five million dollars, as compared to the $54.4 million in the 
most recent balance sheet. 27  If, as we suspect, ONP has only the two legacy production lines we were 
shown (see The Value of ONP’s Production Lines is Greatly Overstated), then its PP&E would be well 
less than five million dollars. 
 
ONP’s 2008 Form 10-K lists asset value that is more than twice what is listed its 2008 audited PRC tax 
return.  HBOP’s audited 2008 PRC financials show assets of $24.3 million (RMB 165,868,258.64),28 
which is 54.0% ($28.5 million) less than the $52.8 million shown in the balance sheet of ONP’s 2008 
Form 10-K.29 Therefore, according to the PRC filings, ONP’s 2008 Form 10-K has roughly doubled the 
value of its assets.   
 
However, we have found evidence that the PRC financial statements overstate (likely by at least $20 
million or two times) the value of ONP’s assets.  ONP was a tiny company with equity capital of only 
$512,000 (RMB 3.5 million) until 2003.30  In 2003, Chairman Liu and his brother, Xiaodong Liu, 
invested $10.5 million (RMB 71.5 million) in equity capital.31  The problem is that none of the investment 
was in the form of cash.  Rather, it was in the form of equipment, the values of which value were 
established by an “independent” appraiser.  (In 2009, ONP apparently found an “independent” appraiser 
that greatly overvalued the Shuang Xing assets by about 40x or $14.5 million – see Approximately $30 
Million Has Been Misappropriated Since October 2009.)   
 
We have established that the value of these contributed assets was overstated by millions of dollars.  We 
chose five of the higher priced items in the list of 21 pieces of equipment in the capital verification report 
(see FN 33), and called vendors to obtain quotations on comparable new equipment today.

31 HBOP March 27, 2003 capital verification report.  The capital verification report contains a detailed schedule of 
equipment contributed and assessed values.  These assessed values count as “registered capital” (the PRC term for 
equity capital).
Muddy Waters, LLC ONP June 28, 2010 Page 12 of 30 


The comparison between the values ONP provided in the capital verification report and the quotations we 
received is below.  Keep in mind that ONP’s equipment values were supposed to be as of 2003.  
(Moreover because we believe that the equipment dates from the mid-1990s at the newest, it was likely 
well used at the time of contribution.  However, the verification report did not specify whether the 
equipment was new or used.)  In contrast, we received quotes on brand new equipment at 2010 prices.  
Note two things about the below comparison: a) the prices are in RMB (not USD), and b) the quotations 
we received do not include shipping and assembly, which should not exceed 10% of the equipment cost.  
 


 
 
The foregoing sample makes clear that ONP’s asset values in its PRC financial statements are inflated by 
many millions of dollars – and likely by at least five times as of 2003.  Based on these overstatements, 
and the other evidence of fraud, we believe that it is reasonable to infer that ONP’s PP&E is worth no 
more than five million dollars.  If as we suspect, ONP only has the two legacy production lines we were 
shown, then the value of its PP&E would likely be well less than five million dollars. 
 
The Value of ONP’s Production Lines is Greatly Overstated 
 
We showed video and photos of ONP’s production equipment (infra in this section) to a salesperson for a 
large European paper manufacturing equipment producer.  He has been selling production lines into the 
China market for a number of years.  Based on the photos and video, he speculated that the two 
production lines we saw were probably only each worth “a few hundred thousand [US] dollars.”  If we 
are correct in our suspicion that ONP only has two production lines, one need look no further than the two 
production lines listed in the capital verification report (see ONP Overvalues its Assets by At Least 10x) to 
see that today the value of each line would be well under $1 million. 
 
We asked to see all of ONP’s production lines, but were only shown two (apparently there was a pressing 
need to have a two hour lunch).  The two lines that we saw were old, poorly maintained, and in some of 
the worst manufacturing workshops we have ever seen. There was steam and water throughout the 
workshop, which is anathema to paper products.   
 
As we walked along the second of the two lines we were shown, we believe we saw that the drive gears at 
the input end of the production line were not connected by any belts.  If our observation is correct, it 
would mean that no pulp was actually running into the machine; rather, the machine was merely looping 
finished product.  However, because we were rushed through the building, we could not corroborate what 
we think we observed.
Muddy Waters, LLC ONP June 28, 2010 Page 13 of 30 


Regardless of whether that second line was working or not, ONP’s operation struck as a late 20th century 
factory equivalent of a Potemkin village.  If ONP has other production lines – particularly if they are in 
better shape – it is odd that we did not see them.  In addition to our request to see all lines, at the time we 
visited, a Beijing-based correspondent from TheStreet.com was filming a video on ONP for 
TheStreet.com – links to the video are infra in this section.  (We were not previously aware that he would 
be there.)  One would expect ONP to put its best foot forward, and the foot we saw was poor. 
 
The video is available on TheStreet.com and YouTube at the below URLs.  (Three members of the 
Muddy Waters team are shown in the video, to which we did not consent.)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eS9E5vYhQ8 
 
The video prominently shows a dated slogan on the corrugating medium machine (the one that we think 
was not really working) – “求实进取” – which means “practical, aggressive, positive.”  Such slogans 
were commonly painted on machinery and buildings of government-owned companies.  We were unable 
to specifically date the slogan, but we believe that it went out of common usage in the early to mid-1990s. 
 
In its 10-K, ONP claims that its “main competitors” are Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings Ltd., Nine

Where the water comes from – extensive steam in the workshop. 





 
Even worse – the brown corrugating medium line that we suspect was not even producing anything.
Muddy Waters, LLC ONP June 28, 2010 Page 21 of 30 


The videos and pictures show that ONP’s pitch that “Orient Paper will focus on middle and high-end 
products and brands, stick with ‘excellent technology, superior quality and diversified products’”33 is 
untrue.  ONP’s machinery is obviously poor and incapable of producing high quality paper.  Most telling 
though is ONP’s indifference to water and steam in the workshops.  Once paper is exposed to water, it is 
never again level (essential for printing) or nearly as strong.  The preponderance of water in the 
workshops shows that ONP’s customers (to the extent they exist) are not in the market for good product; 
rather, their focus is on finding the lowest cost producer (as in one that cannot afford the basic equipment 
needed to clear steam).  Moreover, the open bed truck method of shipping finished product (shown in the 
TheStreet.com video and below on ONP’s website) exposes the paper to the elements.  Decent quality 
paper selling at the prices ONP claims would rarely be shipped this way.

ONP Has Overstated Inventory Values by Millions of Dollars 
 
The table below shows ONP’s claimed inventory breakdown as of December 31, 2009:34 
 


 
 
The most obvious problem in this table is that Chairman Liu told us categorically that ONP has no 
finished goods inventory because customers pick up finished product as it comes off of the lines (see 
ONP Overstated 2009 Revenue by Approximately 40x).  We did not see the approximately 2,000 tons of 
finished goods lying around that $605,719 would represent. 
 
The second issue is that while ONP has a substantial amount of recycled paper board (“OCC”) sitting 
outside, we are incredulous that it is worth anywhere close to $2.3 million.  OCC degrades if stored 
outside because it soaks in moisture.  It would be irresponsible at the least to store such valuable paper 
outside.  The photo on the following page shows one of our analysts climbing a heap of OCC.

Taken together, the following three photos show the entirety of ONP’s recycled white scrap paper 
inventory.  Again, if this is worth $1.7 million, the world is a much richer place than we knew.

ONP’s Claims of Inventory Turnover of 32.5x and 16.8x in 2008 and 2009 (Respectively)36 are 
Without Credibility when Compared to those of China’s Industry Leaders, which range from 4.3x 
to 7.7x.37 
 
The below table shows the 2009 inventory turnover statistics for ONP’s four publicly traded “main 
competitors.”  These companies – whether one takes ONP’s revenue numbers at face value or not – 
operate at a far larger scale than does ONP.  The photographs of the various companies’ operations 
strongly suggest that ONP’s “main competitors” are significantly more efficient operators than is ONP.  
Yet, ONP claims to turn over its inventory over 10 times more rapidly than do any of the companies 
below.  ONP likely makes this farcical statement because – as clear as it is that its inventory is worth 
nowhere near $6.9 million38 (see ONP Has Overstated Inventory Values by Millions of Dollars) – ONP 
would have even more trouble convincing visitors that its heaps of cardboard and shredded paper are 
worth around $15 million. 
 


 
 
ONP Overstates its Gross Profit Margin by Hundreds of Basis Points 
 
ONP claims that it generated gross margins of 19.3%,39 19.6%,40 and 18.3%41 in 2008, 2009, and Q1 2010, 
respectively.  ONP’s gross margin is almost certainly significantly lower than it reports. 
 
We engaged a trading company to call HBOP for a quote on corrugating medium (36.4% of revenue in 
Q1 2010,42 and 41.3% of revenue in 200943) in early February 2010.  HBOP quoted a price of $264 per 
ton (RMB 1,800 per ton), which is 13.2% lower than the $304 per ton ASP it claims to have generated on 
corrugating medium in Q1 2010.44  We obtained from a paper manufacturing industry vendor a database 
of Q1 2010 per ton production costs of various corrugating medium producers in China.  We removed the

names and cities of the plants, but the plants’ annual outputs (in finished metric tons) and per ton cost of 
production broken down into components in Q1 2010 (in USD) are shown below. 








The producers in this industry source’s database produce a higher quality product than does HBOP (see 
The Value of ONP’s Production Lines is Greatly Overstated), which would imply that they have a higher 
production cost.  On the other hand, ONP uses less efficient machinery than do most of these companies.  
(The industry source confirmed this after reviewing photos and video of ONP’s production equipment 
and process, and raw material warehousing.)  To generate a 19.3% gross margin at a price of $264 / ton, 
HBOP would have to produce at $213 / ton.  Based on the above production costs for other mills (albeit 
for higher quality products), we infer that it is unlikely to be earning such margin (lest there be any doubt 
about whether ONP is able to produce at a significantly lower price than the major players in the industry 
remaining, see again The Value of ONP’s Production Lines is Greatly Overstated).  We would not be 
surprised if ONP were merely brokering paper – particularly because as previously discussed we suspect 
that ONP’s corrugating medium line does not actually make anything.
Muddy Waters, LLC ONP June 28, 2010 Page 27 of 30 


To put ONP’s gross margin claims into even clearer perspective, the following table compares ONP’s 
claimed gross margin with that of its publicly traded “main competitors.”  Given the differences in 
equipment and processes, we find it inconceivable that ONP’s gross margin could compare so favorably 
to those of the industry leaders. 
 


 
 
Our Theory as to Why ONP’s Auditors Have Missed the Fraud 
 
We’d be remiss if we didn’t address the question of how the auditors could have missed such a large 
fraud.  For one, ONP’s 2007 financials were not audited, although they appear to be if one reads the 2007 
Form 10-K.  After ONP filed the 2007 Form 10-K, the auditor for the shell company into which HBOP 
“merged” (see ONP Has a History of Deceiving Shareholders) clarified that the unqualified opinion in the 
2007 Form 10-K incorrectly states that it audited HBOP.45  It is possible that the work of ONP’s 
subsequent auditors has been affected by this error in the unqualified opinion shown in the 2007 10-K. 
 
Regardless, the mismatch of accounting systems between China and the United States offers ways in 
which a Chinese company could deceive a US GAAP auditor.  Most Chinese accounting records center 
on official product / service purchase invoices (called “fa piao”).  Once a fa piao is created, it leaves a 
record of the transaction that is difficult to conceal because the local tax authorities keep a record of the 
blank fa piao that businesses order.  Fa piao would be used to evidence ONP’s sales to customers and 
purchases from its vendors.   
 
Most accounting shenanigans in China center on inflating expenses in order to decrease tax liability.  
Cheating companies may succeed in keeping a portion of their sales off the books by offering lower 
prices to customers who don’t request fa piao.  However, most B2B companies aren’t able to underreport 
revenue by too much because customers want fa piao in order to decrease their own tax liabilities.   
 
Fraudulent fa piao are available in China.  Such fa piao are effective in dealing with the PRC auditors and 
tax authorities, so it would not be surprising if a company used fraudulent fa piao to fool US GAAP 
auditors.  This is of course speculation, and we do not know exactly how ONP’s auditors were fooled.

ONP Has a History of Deceiving Shareholders in that it “Went Public” Without Disclosing for 20 
Months that it had No Ownership or Legal Control of its Purported PRC Operating Subsidiary 
 
ONP, the AMEX-listed company, has a U.S. subsidiary, Sheng De Holdings, Inc.46  Sheng De Holdings, 
Inc. in turn incorporated Bao Ding Sheng De Paper Co. Ltd. (“Sheng De”) in Bao Ding City, He Bei 
Province, the People’s Republic of China in June 2009.47  Outside of the purportedly acquired digital 
photo paper coating equipment (which Sheng De supposedly owns), all of ONP’s assets and business are 
contained within He Bei Oriental Paper Co. Ltd. (“HBOP”).48  HBOP is 93.26% owned by ONP’s largest 
shareholder / ONP’s chairman and CEO, Mr. Zhengyong Liu.  (Chairman Liu’s brother, Xiaodong Liu, 
owns 6.6% of HBOP, and another shareholder owns 0.13%.)49   
 
HBOP is the primary operating company for ONP.  Sheng De’s main purpose is to consolidate HBOP’s 
operations and assets into ONP because ONP has no ownership interest in HBOP.  This type of 
consolidation arrangement is called a “variable interest entity” (“VIE”), and came about in the wake of 
off-balance sheet accounting abuses at Enron and other companies. 
 
There are two points to make about ONP’s VIE structure.  First, the VIE did not exist until June 2009, so 
ONP was improperly consolidating HBOP’s (misstated) assets and operations prior to that time.  For over 
16 months after ONP “went public” via a reverse merger on October 30, 200750, ONP claimed that via its 
wholly owned subsidiary Dong Fang Zhi Ye Holding Ltd, ONP “owns all of the issued and outstanding 
stock of HBOP.”51  On May 15, 2009 ONP amended that statement to say that Chairman Liu and the 
other two shareholders of HBOP were holding the ownership “in trust” for ONP pursuant to a “trust 
agreement executed as of [October 29, 2007].”52  In other words, ONP was now saying that it had no 
actual ownership of HBOP because the shares remained with the original shareholders “in trust” for ONP 
– but governed by a trust agreement.  (Essentially ONP went public without going public.)  That 
description changed again 45 days later when on June 30, 2009, ONP wrote that the HBOP shares are 
only “deemed held in trust” by Chairman Liu et al.53  Apparently, there had been no formal trust 
instrument after all.  But now that Sheng De apparently has the right to 80% of HBOP’s net income, ONP 
is transparent about not having any ownership interest in HBOP54.   
 
However, and second, after reviewing the various agreements that purport to give control of HBOP to 
Sheng De,55 we see that the agreements are largely cosmetic.  It would effectively be up to Chairman Liu

to enforce such agreements against himself.  We feel that this conflict of interest is difficult for Chairman 
Liu to manage. 
 
Were ONP’s financial misstatements not so egregious, we would be quite troubled by ONP’s lack of 
forthrightness about the ownership and VIE issues with HBOP.  Although these issues are ancillary to 
ONP’s fraud, the creation of Sheng De and eventual disclosure that ONP has no ownership interest in 
HBOP tells us that the fraud has become more sophisticated over time.  The increase in sophistication is 
likely an attempt to stay a step ahead of investors who are better versed in the China environment. 
 
Our Methodology 
 
We initially approached ONP as a possible Strong Buy.  However, certain red flags quickly emerged that 
made us suspect that there was some level of graft occurring at ONP.  We accept that even many “well 
managed” companies in the China context often have some level of internal corruption, so we were 
willing to accept a thesis that there is a strong underlying business with some investor money being 
skimmed.  Once we commenced our in depth review of SEC filings though (we have read literally every 
SEC filing – including all exhibits – multiple times), we saw strong indications that the company was 
largely a fraud.   
 
Our on site due diligence confirmed our thesis that the company is nowhere near the scale that it claims to 
be.  On our visit, we saw a very small operation that appeared to be formerly government owned, and 
probably privatized for very little money.  More than anything, HBOP’s plant struck us as the late 20th 
century factory equivalent of a Potemkin village in that it is more for show than for production.   
 
Prior to visiting HBOP, we had requested, and received confirmation, that we would see all production 
lines and the digital photo paper production assets.  Instead, our visit only included a ninety-minute tour 
of an unknown portion of the legacy HBOP assets, a two-hour lunch, and an unproductive one hour 
meeting at an office building nowhere near HBOP’s production facility (but that we would later learn is 
supposedly next to the acquired – yet unseen – digital photo paper production lines).56   
 
HBOP claims to have six legacy paper production lines,57 but despite our prior agreement to see all lines, 
it showed us only two – one for medium-grade white writing paper and one for corrugating medium.  The 
equipment is clearly dated, and in our opinion is from the mid-1990s at newest.  
 
During the tour, once we demonstrated knowledge of production equipment and processes, the pace of the 
tour sped up considerably.  We were admonished to move along a number of times, and Chairman Liu 
appeared to call several managers to observe Sean Regan (our manufacturing expert) while he was 
lagging behind to closely inspect equipment.   
 
The medium-grade white writing paper production line was operating.  The second line we saw, for 
corrugating medium, may not have been actually producing paper.  Right after walking into the workshop,

Chairman Liu explained that the machine had just restarted after a production snag, thus it was running at 
a slower speed than usual.  As we walked along the line, we believe we saw that the drive gears at the 
input end of the production line were not connected by any belts.  If our observation is correct, it would 
mean that no pulp was actually running into the machine; rather, the machine was merely looping finished 
product.  However, because we were rushed through the building, we could not corroborate what we think 
we observed. 
 
Following our site visit, we bolstered our research in a number of ways, including by searching public 
records, conducting online research in Chinese, consulting with an industry expert, obtaining quotations 
and specifications on manufacturing equipment, obtaining quotations on product from HBOP itself, and 
speaking with purported customers of ONP.
