Global Sources: Major Concerns With One Of The Oldest China
Reverse Takeovers
Oct. 13, 2011 9:24 AM ET5 comments
by: Ben Axler


Global Sources Ltd. (Nasdaq: GSOL) is perhaps the original and oldest existing China
Reverse Takeover ("RTO") Company in the US stock market. In March 2000, Global
Sources exchanged 100% of its shares for a 95% stake in Fairchild (Bermuda) Ltd., a
subsidiary spun-off from the now bankrupt Fairchild Corp. Through this deal, Global
Sources obtained a public listing on the Nasdaq in order to provide liquidity to
shareholders and a venue for raising an additional source of funds for expansion.
A closer look at GSOL’s business model reveals indications of weakening fundamentals,
and significant customer dissatisfaction with online media services, which is the
company's largest and fastest growing revenue source. We also find a number of unusual
issues with its financial reporting including a lack of standardized reporting metrics,
voluntary changes in accounting standards from GAAP to IFRS, changes in auditors over
"fees," and multiple CFO and executive transitions. Furthermore, we believe the Company
has an unusual financial strategy, which has focused on misallocating significant capital to
real estate purchases, at the expense of internal investment to its core businesses.
Through our research, we are unable to explain or justify any of these financial actions,
and conclude the Company is not run for the benefit of public shareholders.
What does Global Sources do?
Global Sources is a business-to-business (“B2B”) media Company that provides
information and integrated marketing services to connect buyers and sellers for a range of
products, with a particular focus on the Greater China market. The Company’s revenue is
generated through one of three segments:
1. Print media – Publication and distribution of trade and product catalogues. Suppliers


pay for advertising in trade magazines to promote their companies’ products. Other
revenue is derived from buyers that subscribe to the trade publications and sourcing
research reports


2. Online media – Website allowing buyers to find product suppliers. Suppliers are
charged fees for the hosting and presentation of their products. Other revenues are
derived from banner advertising and distribution of a digital e-magazine


3. Trade shows and exhibitions – Organized shows to match buyers and suppliers.
Revenue is primarily from exhibit space rentals, but also from advertising and
sponsorship fees in show guides and other locations in and around event venues

GSOL claims more than 1 million active international buyers use the site from more than
240 countries and territories to connect with suppliers. In mainland China, the Company
has a network of more than 40 office locations (60 global locations) and a community of
nearly 3 million registered online users and magazine readers of its Chinese-language
media. GSOL delivers information on over 5.7 million products and more than 262,000
suppliers annually through 14 online marketplaces, 13 monthly print and 18 digital
magazines, over 90 sourcing research reports and 73 specialized trade shows a year
across nine cities.

GSOL’s Fundamentals are Weakening


If we take a closer look at each GSOL’s three revenue segments we can better
understand why the foundation for growth may be weakening. The table below shows the
revenue trend for each of the three segments.

In the Print Services segment, revenue has been declining for each of the past three
years, primarily from the secular shift occurring to online media advertising and the
intensely competitive pricing environment. For the six months ended 2011 compared with
2010, this segment’s revenue has declined by 23%. The trends are expected to continue
in this segment in the future.


Offsetting the decline in Print Services segment, Online Media Services revenue grew
25% for the six months ended 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of greater revenue
from hosting online websites and digital magazines. We estimate a long-term growth rate
for this segment at 10-15%.


The Exhibitions business was started in 2003 and after a period of rapid growth appears
to have matured relatively quickly having grown only 5% for the six months ended 2011,
compared with 2010. We estimate long-term growth may be constrained by the frequency
and type of shows that can be hosted in GSOL’s current markets.


The exhibition business is also competitive; the Company competes with others, including
Hong Kong Trade Development Company (HKTDC), which is government-subvented
statutory body and the largest trade show organizer in Hong Kong with deep financial
resources. The success in this segment has been historically heavily dependent upon
shows in China. Additional revenue growth will have to come from successfully entering
new markets such as India and U.S.


Taken as a whole, GSOL’s main pillar of growth rests on its ability to execute in the Online
Media Services segment. However, this is not without its challenges as the Company has
numerous competitors, some with significantly more resources such as Alibaba.com
(OTC:ALBCF) and also HKTDC. Other noteworthy competitors include HC International

(OTC:HCINF), ECVV.com as well as a variety of other competitors since barriers to entry
are low. Below is just a sample of a few companies offering B2B services online.


To assess GSOL’s relative position in the online space, we’ve looked at the page ranking
using public sources such as Alexa. The statistics indicate that GSOL is losing share to
strong rivals such as Alibaba and HC International. Both sites have been posting
increasing traffic rank and daily reach metrics over the past few years, while GSOL has
largely seen a stagnation of traffic.


It would certainly be easier to evaluate GSOL’s online business if it disclosed information
such as new customer additions, customer churn, revenue per average user, number of
paying members, customer acquisition costs, etc. However, GSOL is opaque on these
matters and does not report regular operating metrics for investors to evaluate its ongoing
performance.


Global Sources Not Immune to Problems Plaguing the Industry


Fraud has been a major issue facing the online providers of B2B trade services. The story
typically goes as follows. An unscrupulous supplier gains access to a trade website and



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HCINF

advertises a particular product and convinces a buyer to purchases the product. The seller
then either does not deliver the product or delivers a product not meeting the advertised
specifications or is of inferior quality. 
The problem has become so rampant that The Office of U.S. Trade Representative named
the online China B2B/B2C markets as a “Notorious Market,” (pdf) and called for more
action from local authorities to combat the issue. The industry leader Alibaba
(OTC:ALBCF) had to confront the issue headlong by issuing a statement that the
Company will visit the facilities of all paying members of its China Gold Supplier program
over the course of a year after more than 2,300 vendors used Alibaba’s website to defraud
buyers, and about 100 employees were responsible for letting sellers create bogus
storefronts. Alibaba’s Gold Supplier program for Chinese exporters fell by more than 4,200
in the quarter ended June to about 112,000, Alibaba said last month. In the previous three
months, the Company lost more than 4,800 Gold Supplier members.


B2B websites like Alibaba and GSOL advertise suppliers as “Gold” members or some
other form of internally developed ranking system. The fact remains that these rankings
appear to be nothing more than marketing gimmicks that the customers can pay for to
receive more favorable rankings or profile appearance on the B2B website. For example,
GSOL says on the website that it conducts “3 or more visits or calls to a supplier
company” and checks “business licenses” as part of the supplier verification process. As
we can all imagine and have witnessed in numerous cases, these protection measures
are easily circumvented by any motivated fraudster. Independent credit checks and
protections are listed as optional by GSOL suppliers.


When it comes to buying products on GSOL’s website, the mantra "buyer beware" cannot
be stressed more. The critics have certainly expressed their scathing opinions of the
protection measures the Company has used to combat fraudulent suppliers. A simple web
search reveals numerous customer complaints from bad experiences on GSOL’s website,
even from suppliers purported to be ranked highly.


“I had a bad experience getting connected by GlobalSources.com to a Chinese company
CATIC. The company CATIC had none of the capabilities listed on GlobalSources.com
who gave the top rating as a 'verified supplier.'"


One exceptionally dissatisfied customer even posted his own report of his customer
experience on the internet entitled “Global Sources: A Pirates Nest Covering Pirates”
(pdf).

The dissatisfaction with GSOL’s website is not limited to its inability to curtail cases of
fraud. The reviews on Alexa.com show a preponderance of 1 star ratings of the site, and
point to user dissatisfaction with the website’s functionality and pricing.


I have an account at this site for over a year. Customer service is relatively quick to
respond and professional. However, the user interface for sellers and manufacturers
trying to list their products and create categories is one of the worst designed I had
ever experienced and I've designed and created about three dozen web sites in my
career so far. Trying to remove a product is a nightmare. Their product creation tools
are simply very poorly designed. 


I used the website 2 years, but not enough buyers contact me. It's very expensive. I
will not use it.


Basically, Global Sources charges a lot and offers little. Look at the following 5 star
rating from a user about Global Sources. It is an exact copy of a marketing
statement and slogan by one of its competitors. Global Sources copied it!

Global Sources’ Unusual Financial Reporting


GSOL has the most unusual financial practices of all the companies we have looked at
over the years.  


For starters, let’s consider its recent change in accounting standard. The Company
adopted IFRS effective as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. For the
previous 10 years as a pubic company, GSOL reported under U.S. GAAP. The move
strikes us as unusual given that the adoption is completely voluntary. We’ve not seen any
companies recently undertake a voluntary switch of standards. Our research indicates
~8% of US listed Chinese companies with market capitalizations between $100m to $1bn
report under IFRS (Appendix 1). The time and cost involved with implementing the change
are not trivial and require an experienced and dedicated internal team of finance
professionals to properly oversee. The Company has not announced any external
management hires in the finance department, nor have there been additional disclosures
of the steps taken to oversee proper implementation.

What we have seen at the executive level, and at the CFO role in particular, at GSOL
does not inspire confidence. For starters, the Company has switched CFOs three times
since 2009. The long-time CFO Eddie Heng announced his retirement in 2009, and was
replaced by a company-outsider David Gillian. We raise a cautionary point that Mr. Gillian
then left the CFO position and the Company in less than 1 year to “pursue personal
business opportunities.” Eddie Heng returned for a brief interim period, and was then
replaced by another company insider, Connie Lai, who has had a short tenure of only 3
years at the Company. Given the revolving door at the CFO position, and somewhat
capricious change to IFRS, we have a skeptical posture toward the financial reporting.
The recent executive turnover has not been limited to just the CFO role. In the past few
months, the CEO, CIO, and COO have all been shuffled around, and 1 Board member
has resigned.

Why would GSOL consider a change to IFRS in the first place? The answer is not entirely
clear because the Company does not disclose the reason for the change. One thing we do
know is that IFRS accounting gives management more leeway in choosing accounting
methods than GAAP. GAAP is a more rules based and rigid accounting standard. GSOL’s
business is certainly international, which could be a motivating factor, but there are plenty
of international companies with US listings that conform to US GAAP, and would not
switch to IFRS unless it were mandatory in order to avoid the time, cost, and aggravation.
GSOL has plenty of U.S. shareholders too, so the accounting switch raises question
marks.
It’s also noteworthy that GSOL switched auditors not long ago in 2008 from Ernest and
Young to PWC. The reason cited was “cost.” Elevated audit fees can be a red flag of
problems to come for a company, say three recent academic studies that together warn
about increased chances of fraud, stock price declines or financial restatements.

See: Corporate audit fees up? Beware of trouble ahead 


GSOL’s reported audit fees doubled between 2006 and 2007, and again rose sharply from
2009 to 2010, even though the underlying business hardly changed. An even more
interesting observation is that GSOL’s fees for tax work were a paltry $2,000 in 2006,
2007, and 2009. For a mere $2,000 investment (yes two thousand dollars), GSOL has
received tax planning, and advice that has allowed it to pay an average effective tax rate
in the past 5 years of 3.22%. This is quite a striking accomplishment considering that
GSOL is the only company we can find incorporated in Bermuda, has 61 subsidiaries in
16 different jurisdictions, yet reports doing nearly 80% of its business in China. To analyze
just how remarkable the tax achievements are, we’ve also included our benchmarking
results in Appendix 1. The results certainly beg the question: If GSOL has identified a
great tax strategy to pay consistently low taxes, why hasn’t every other company
followed? 


Lastly, we note that the recent audit opinion was signed from PWC’s Singapore office,
which again raises eyebrows considering GSOL is the only Chinese listed company we
could identify that is audited from this location. PWC certainly has branch offices in China;
both of GSOL’s closest peers, Alibaba and HC international, are audited from the PWC
Hong Kong office.

Our concerns over GSOL financial reporting do not stop here. Turning our attention to the
presentation of the income statement, we have found something so unusual that we’ve
never seen in our entire investing career spanning decades. GSOL does not report any
information on its cost of sales directly related to revenue, and hence no presentation of
its consolidated gross profit. It is inconceivable to us that GSOL does not present costs
that are directly related to generating revenue for each of its reported revenue segments.
As a result, investors cannot easily ascertain the contribution margin from each of the
businesses.


Furthermore, the operating expenses lines are ambiguous and confusing. Take for
example the “community” expense line, which appears to be an amalgamation of
expenses related to each of the revenue segments. The Company’s description of
community expenses is noted below.

Community costs consist of the costs incurred for servicing our buyer community
and for marketing our products and services to the global buyer community.
Community costs also include costs relating to our trade magazine publishing
business and marketing inserts business, specifically printing, paper, bulk circulation,
magazine subscription promotions, promotions for our on-line services, customer
services costs and the event specific promotions costs incurred for promoting the
China Sourcing Fairs events and the technical conferences, exhibitions and
seminars to the buyer community. The event specific promotion costs incurred for
events are expensed during the event months in the year in which the expenses are
incurred. (Global Sources 20-F Annual Report)


We could drill down even further but won't belabor the main point: GSOL’s financial
reports should be viewed with extreme caution given the recent and unexplained
accounting standard change, high CFO turnover, change in auditors, and highly unusual
presentation of its income statement.
Global Sources’ Unusual Financial Strategy


GSOL’s financial strategy appears to indicate a tacit decision not to invest in the operating
business, but rather filter the cash flow out of the Company and into non-core assets. The
table below summarizes the Company’s sources and uses of operating cash flow over the
past five years.  


The one clear conclusion from this table is that GSOL has invested very little to grow the

core business via acquisitions or investment in capital expenditures, but rather views
share repurchases and property acquisitions as the most attractive return on its capital.


Two stock tenders were completed in 2008 and 2010. The first tender was for $50m at
$8.00/share and the second for $100m at $9.00/share. These prices serve as handy high
water marks for what GSOL’s stock may ever be worth.
The more fascinating observation is that GSOL has reported acquiring nearly $125m of
property acquisitions since 2004 and just recently announced the largest acquisition ever
of $51m for property in Shanghai to support “future growth.” The recent transaction is all
cash, and no bank financing was used in the transaction. Despite the materiality of this
transaction (representing over 20% of GSOL’s assets), none of the purchase and sale
contracts for this deal has been filed, or for any of the property transaction since 2004.


GSOL Announces Purchase of Shanghai Office 


According to the press release, the location is close to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport, a
regional transportation hub and metro stations. Additionally, we know that the location is in
Changning District and the Company paid RMB 326m for 6,668 square meters, which is
equivalent to 48,890 RMB per square meter, or $700 per square foot.

the west part of the city. Hongqiao Airport is on its west edge. Three city belt ways, the
Inner Loop, the Middle Loop and the Outer Loop, run through it and naturally further define
the land in Changning district based on its locations relative to the belt ways. Not
surprisingly, the land within the Inner Loop has the highest value and the land outside of
the Outer Loop is the cheapest. GSOL’s description of the real estate purchase puts the
most likely location outside the Outer Loop, where Hongqiao Airport is. The second likely
location is between the Outer Loop and the Middle Loop.
China’s real estate sales are no secret. Soufun.com a (NYSE:SFUN) keeps many real
estate records.

which is located within the Inner Loop, is offered at

RMB 45,000 per square meter, lower than the price paid by GSOL and in a much more
desirable location.


The information provided by the Company on the real estate transaction is not consistent
with our knowledge of the Shanghai real estate market and more information needs to be
disclosed by the Company.
A list of all of the property acquisitions has been provided in the table below


Given our foregoing discussion about GSOL’s business fundamentals, and observations
that its capital allocation does not favor internal investment, how can we be confident that
this property acquisition is truly to “support future growth?”


How can GSOL’s management actually defend paying peak prices for a property in
Shanghai when the business model is not one that even depends on owning real estate
as a core asset, and there are indications that property prices are beginning to decline?

After all, let’s recall that their three businesses are print and online advertising, as well as
organizing trade show exhibitions. The exhibitions are certainly not being held on these
commercial properties, and management even discloses that they incur venue rental
charges for hosting the conferences. Besides, the conferences are mostly held in
Shanghai, and globally at locations such as Miami, Dubai, and Johannesburg. Therefore,
we can rule out that the property is actually being used for legitimate purposes related to
the exhibition business. Does the Company need to own almost 300,000-square feet of

property to run a B2B website and trade publication business? We think the answer is
certainly no.
Let’s now examine the property question from a different perspective by looking at the
Company’s workforce. The table below summarizes GSOL’s historical employee
composition in the past three years.  


The two most striking observations are: 1) Almost 90% of the workforce is classified as
independent contractors with almost 70% of the workforce being independent sales staff
and; 2) Total headcount is still down by almost 450 people from the end of 2008 to 2010,
which again calls into question why GSOL would spend $51m on its recent property
purchase.
Who are these independent contractors? According to Company disclosures, GSOL uses
six main sales representative companies in mainland China, which are responsible for
approximately 71% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010. Sales
representatives are located in 60 cities worldwide, with 44 of these locations in Greater
China. So what has us concerned with all of this? First, it appears that the property
acquisitions have been concentrated in Shenzen, which accounts for over 65% of the real
estate square footage. This appears inconsistent with a globally dispersed sales force.
Secondly, we assume that having an outsourced sales force is designed to reduce fixed
costs and provide added labor flexibility. Therefore, owning real estate appears
inconsistent with this strategy vis-à-vis the alternative of leasing office space, which if
structured properly can allow a cheaper and more flexible solution.
Attempts to contact management for answers to the vexing financial reporting and more

Global Sources does not appear to be a business that is run for the benefit of public
shareholders. The financial strategies undertaken by the Company do not appear
transparent and serve the prospects of maximizing shareholder value. Furthermore, there
are indications that the underlying businesses are mature and facing significant
headwinds, which may explain the recent executive turnover. The Company has
determined that investing in Chinese real estate is in the best interest of shareholders,
despite the fact that their business model does not appear to justify it from multiple
perspectives. We are also concerned by its recent $51m acquisition of Shanghai property
at peak prices for no compelling reason. A complicated organizational structure and
opaque financial reporting adds further doubt in our minds over the reliability of the
financials. We arrive at a $2.50 price target, the midpoint of our range, by giving full credit
to the cash on the balance sheet, and discounting the value of the real estate, given our
concerns on the legitimacy of the transactions and the illiquidity. We apply a generous 2x
– 3x multiple to a through-a-cycle EBITDA to value the operating business, which we
deem to be low growth, operating in a highly competitive environment, and difficult to
evaluate due to limitations on financial disclosure.

LOL, I would love to know where to find such a premium office building in Hongqiao. Hongqiao is the west suburban
area. The land is much cheaper than downtown.

Google paid $650 per square foot for this Manhattan downtown building, cheaper than GSOL paid, even though they
paid a very expensive 5% cap rate!

You put in some work here, but the overall results are shoddy. Your claim that the company has not been friendly to
shareholders has no basis in fact. Both of the share repurchase transactions in 2008 and 2010 that you mention were
tender offers well in excess of the market price at the time and amounted to 150 million dollars. That doesn't sound
like a company that does not take care of its shareholders, nor does it sound like a company with financial concerns.


As for the business and accounting issues, a careful examination of the "evidence" you present does not pass the
sniff test.


1) You deride GSOL for changing auditors, but the fact is, according to your own data, their costs last year were still
significantly lower than those under Ernst and Young.


2) You attack the company for low customer satisfaction and present a ridiculous PDF as evidence?


3) The company is based in Bermuda and pays next to no taxes. So what?

Fact is that Global Sources has been a successful and profitable B2B business for 40 years. Former CEO, Merle
Hinrichs, who just retired, is a Nebraskan and was a the helm all or most of those years.


As for valuation, the market cap of the company is about 230 million - over 100 of which IS CASH. She earns about
25 million a year. Even discounting the real estate purchases to zero, you are looking at a company worth at closer to
12.50 a share than your target of 2.50: 35 million shares * 12.50 = $ 437.5 million market cap - 100 million cash = an
ex-cash PE of 13.5.


Full disclosure: I am long GSOL and look forward to you having to buy shares at a higher price.

Author’s reply »  Thanks for the feedback but perhaps you should stick to the facts.


1) Regarding the tenders: Yes I did point out in my research that they did purchase shares in 2008 and 2009 for $8
and $9 respectively. However, let's not forgot the Company issued equity a few years prior in 2005 at $13.50/share.


http://1.usa.gov/rfIOVh


Prior to issuing the stock, they reported north of $50m of cash on the balance sheet and were showing $20m/yr+ of
cash growing from operations. So why did they issue this stock in the first place? There is no evidence that anything
happened with the money they raised -- no acquisition or major capital investments. In other words, there was a
senseless equity raise from investors, only to return money through a tender 3 years later at a 40% discount to where
it was raised. Congratulations management.


2) Audit fees should not change materially unless the scope of the audit work has changed. Since GSOL's underlying
business did not change, so why would their auditor almost double the fee from 2006-2007? Likewise, the new auditor
has also started charging higher fees recently, and again GSOL's business mix has not changed. You should read this
article carefully and form your own conclusions: http://reut.rs/q2ezj0


3) The facts are the facts when it comes to the customer satisfaction reviews. If you can provide contrary evidence
from a neutral, 3rd-party site, please share it in this forum.


4) The tax matter is one of intrigue. Does it not strike you as odd that the tax rate has been steady and consistent for
numerous years, despite the international growth they are claiming? Tax rules change all the time, and because the
Company's org structure is so large and complicated, I find it inconceivable that tax changes in at least one of their
jurisdictions has not caused a material change in their effective rates. I always believe that if something "is too good to
be true," then it probably isn't.


4) As for valuation, the stock is at this price because a) the growth profile going forward will decline and not match
historical rates. The competitive landscape has changed dramatically, leaving this company far behind and b) all the
other concerns that have been addressed in the article. You can sensitize the valuation in the table above I provided.
The cash is $80m pro forma for the real estate purchase, not $100m as you indicated. To reach your target of
$12.50/share, you are telling me the real estate is worth 100-150% of cost, and the company should be valued at 10 -
14x EBITDA. I just don't see that as a realistic valuation. That's a peak valuation, and we are just not in this

environment going forward. The economic data is already showing that both China exports and real estate prices are
declining. A ball set in motion, rarely stops so quickly, so you should expect things to get worse, not better.


Good luck with owning the stock. I hope the next decade forward will treat you better than the last decade, which has
compounded losses over 25%.

Global Sources has no immediate motivation to reduce fraud through its site. Those outfits pay fees, after all. And for
a little higher price they can benefit from a higher rating.

Global Sources Scam


I have direct experience with GlobalSources.com and have proof in writing from senior executives in a series of
emails where GlobalSources.com admitted the "rating" system they call "verified supplier" is based entirely upon how
much money they collect from the supplier and nothing more.


I got ripped off by the company CATIC Shenzen Company whom I found through GolbalSources.com. CATIC is
supposed to be a "top rated" supplier as listed on GlobalSources.com.


After CATIC ripped me off for more than $500,000 USD (I have proof of this in writing from CATIC) accounting and
emails I contacted GlobalSources.com and finally they admitted they never "verified" CATIC's capabilities. They
simply sent a low level person to a little office only to collect money. There was no verification other than to be sure
the check did not bounce. CATIC simply paid for those 4 stars out of a possible 5 stars. (I know about the little office
because I visited that office when I was in China to try to get my money back).


Unlike what GlobalSources.com states on their website CATIC Shenzhen has no factories of their own, no research
and development, no quality control, etc.


Furthermore, GlobalSources.com is listed on NASDAQ (NASDAQ-GS: GSOL) but they are based in Bermuda to
avoid US taxes. These people are truly "Ugly Americans," who represent everything that is wrong in America in terms
of trade.


The person who admitted in writing the truth of this scam is:


Bernie Holmbraker 
General Manager, Client Service and Buyer Events, GlobalSources.com


It's hard to believe Global Sources can get away with this blatant SCAM


Also, you can't trust Alibaba either. The website is owned by the Chinese based in China.
