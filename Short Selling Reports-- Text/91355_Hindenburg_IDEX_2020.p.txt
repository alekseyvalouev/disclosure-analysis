Yesterday, we issued research


(https://twitter.com/HindenburgRes/status/1276168353061711873?s=20) on Ideanomics that


showed:


1. The company doctored images of its supposed electric vehicle sales operation (called the


“MEG” center) to make it seem as though the company owned/operated the facility.


2. That management and other vendors of the facility told us they had never heard of MEG


or Ideanomics.


Today’s response shows IDEX walking back some of its previous claims about its “MEG” center,


where it purportedly is selling EVs in Qingdao.


Prior to today, the company has repeatedly referred to its facility in numerous press releases


as a “1 million square feet EV hub”.


Ideanomics Walks Back 1m Sq Ft Claims
Today; Our Visit To IDEX’s “MEG” Facility
Shows Zero Company Presence


Published on June 26, 2020



https://twitter.com/HindenburgRes/status/1276168353061711873?s=20
For example, the company’s May 26 press release (https://investors.ideanomics.com/2020-05-


26-Ideanomics-MEG-EV-Center-in-Qingdao-Opens-for-Operations-and-Revenues-to-Begin-This-


Month) clearly says: “The MEG Center is a one million square foot EV expo center in


Qingdao, Shandong Province.”


But in the company’s press release today (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-


releases/ideanomics-clari�es-status-of-its-ev-hub-in-qingdao-301084330.html), IDEX backtracks


and says it is launching three phases of its MEG center that will eventually total one million


square feet. The �rst phase, it claims, occupies only 215,000 square feet.


But the company’s June 9 press release (https://investors.ideanomics.com/2020-06-09-Over-2-


100-Vehicles-Sold-at-Ideanomics-MEG-Center-in-May), issued as IDEX stock was pumping


higher, also says nothing about opening in three phases. Instead, it boasts “As a reminder,


the MEG Center in Qingdao began operations on May 1.”


The company’s May 26 press release (https://investors.ideanomics.com/2020-05-26-


Ideanomics-MEG-EV-Center-in-Qingdao-Opens-for-Operations-and-Revenues-to-Begin-This-


Month) follows up by saying: “The MEG Center in Qingdao now hosts a full suite of car dealer


services for new energy and used cars with a capacity of 18,000 vehicles onsite. It o�ers a one-


stop buying experience that includes �nancial services and onsite vehicle registration services.”


Further, in the company’s press release today (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-


releases/ideanomics-clari�es-status-of-its-ev-hub-in-qingdao-301084330.html) it posted an


aerial view of the supposed MEG Center.


That video was apparently pulled from this YouTube account which posted the video two


weeks ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx-uqvn5UOg


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx-uqvn5UOg)


The video is drone footage of the outside of the entire facility. We think the reason the


company isn’t posting video from INSIDE the facility is because such video shows they have


absolutely no presence on site whatsoever.


So in response, we are posting our video of the inside of the “MEG” center, which is


actually called the Qingdao Fidelity International Trade City (or 富达国际商贸城 in Chinese),
which shows only few cars for sale, and no sign of the company on site.

In short, we think the company has fabricated its supposed sales center, and altered images in


its press releases to make it seem that it operates the facility.


We continue to believe, as we stated yesterday, that the company is engaged in �agrant


securities fraud and that it’s stock will wind up in the pennies or halted by regulators.

Did u do research on Bruno wu’s history, about a now delisted stock at Hong Kong, at that time


he use the listed company to make many transaction with his own unlisted company, and


eventually get out from the game. It’s also happen at Ideanomics, FinTalk for example.

Wrong. Idex showed their proof and orders and dismissed this b.s. company’s claims. You’re an


idiot that listened and dumped your shares I bet. How could all the analysts be wrong who sit


in on these companies meetings and due their due diligence and it’s their job. This company


spreads false rumors to short stocks. Are you that dense you can’t see that. So what if he had a


company in Hong Kong have something happen to it… if that’s true I don’t buy it I searched, but


nonetheless you and this fraudulant J company are morons. I may thank these greedy J’s tho


b/c I bought tons at cheap so when I clean up after these idiots like you and the millenials on


Robinhood research b4 dumping, buy back I will be back to thank you idiots. Get a clue both of


you. And Hindenberg I hope you all die of Covid. And I see you are now going after GNUS. I


swear I will do the time for the crime I will commit against you if you post another pre proofed


false story to short a stock. You clowns. Get a life.

I think I read you correctly that you are talking to these Hindenburg clowns. I hope so otherwise


never mind but if so I am right there with you. They make these claims without allowing the


company to respond. And by the time IDEX did respond it was already buried. This “research


company” Hindenburg should go the way of it’s namesake and crash and all die. IDEX is legit


but since the Hberg J’s shorted it and tweeted it and it caught on all the millenials on


Robinhood and so forth dumped it so they needed it to crash and they made millions. This


hack company should be sued out the ass. Hindeburg you aholes should be ashamed and held


accountable. B/c when shorts get suspicious and lose b/c a stock goes up they thought was


going down they cry like little Dem babies and call Law �rms which NEVER pans out btw. But


you think it’s ok for you to do this??? Cost me thousands of $ and no one, esp a J company F’s


w/ my $. Go to hell you frauds. If I could get my hands on whoever typed that Tweet I swear I


will be glad to do my time for the crime I would do to you. F you up p@ssies. And again I hope


you all die of Covid. Hindenberg you have my email please contact me anytime I’d love to come


at you you punk bitches.

This is an obvious cash grab by short sellers. They do it to EVERY stock. It’s despicable they did


this b4 allowing the company to respond to claims. If u read their response after the fact Hi


denburg wasn’t even calling the right ppl. I just hate short sellers bc they need to be shady in


bull market n use shady tactics like this. So ur saying all analysts who sit in on these Co’s


meetings n look thru their �nancials are wrong but an unknown short seller tweet is right? Ok


good call.


If Wu had sed somthg undocumented like these fools the shorts wud b running to law �rms as


always. Well no one knows the real deal esp ppl like us so lets see how this pans out homie. I’m


independent btw so its not left or right my comment. But Dems hate Trump obviously n hence


a good market so wud stand to reason they have hand in scare tactic fake news bullshit just


like they do in non market matters. JMO. Or r we not allowed to do that anymore either.

Aahhh, the pain of the novice trader… This site reeks of it! But if you little Robinhood idiots


would commit yourselves to actually reading the various press releases from the P&D


companies (Ideanomics in this case), you would see that there is nothing worth buying here,


and, provided there is still outstanding shares left, short sell it as a concentrated portfolio


position.


You will note that the company responded to Hindenburg with “signed”sheets of paper (all of


which conveys a level of professionalism comparable to what’s expected of a high school


student trying to get out of detention), yet not one article explaining why half the lawyers in


lower Manhattan are still processing with their and the class’s legal action against the fraud o�


the company. Reading Ideametrics PRs and you’re greeted with an endless parade of lawsuits


against the company, none of which are being challenged by the company. That’s because


about 1/3rd of what the company is publishing in the PRs is true, with the remainder being


false.


Not a single lawsuit is being challenged in court, not is there any e�ort being made to


challenge. And these “business partners”? Nothing but single sheets of paper, each with a
description of less than a paragraph (!), Informally describing what vague business relationship


the business partners have with ideanomics that would give even a second-tier auditor a


coronary (or make him laugh too the point of hospitalization).

Novice trader huh? That’s the best u got? I am the one sed the Robinhood millennial morons r


ones who listen to idiots like you n Hi denburg. Novice trader… Not that I care what u sed i got


bored after 1st paragraph but I bought 1000s of shares ur fave fraud co. caused major dips to


yest n I made $15000 on IDEX today when it was UP 60%. So shove novice up ur ass u don’t


know me U clown. Im out anyway, I never sed IDEX was next Amazon or Anythg but the slimy


way u short dicks manipulate shit is disgusting n that was my beef. So thx again for ur lie n


fraud Hindenburg I cleared more today than u do pal in a quarter u short liar. Ur just salty ur


shorts got scorched today n everyday. U shorts keep thinking bear market coming back so all u


got is lie tweets from horrible research co’s. So I’m done w/ IDEX anyway. So have a nice life I’ll

Joe P, before letting the door slam you on your way out, can you please answer me this? Why


IDEX? Why acrappy, low-life of a penny stock that even in TD’s pro�le has then changing


corporate names three times? I mean there are two full exchanges full of great companies and


what does Joe P do? The dumbass buys a go nowhere (except down) stock like IDEX. I just don’t


get it! But, no, Joe, your not the only dysfunctional retard pulling the Robinhood slot machine


crank; with 100M trading average volume, there are a few others as well. But what is it that


inspires them (and you) to do it? You KNOW it’s a company run by lying corporate “o�cers”


(how the fuck do you dimwits rationalize the 1M sqare foot warehouse? What internal


mechanisms in that peanut you call a brain justify legitimacy in a company that so freely


exaggerates? I’d like to know not just for curiosity’s sake, but also so that I can �nd easier ways


to exploit you ppl). You KNOW every lawyer east of the Mississippi have their talons dug deep


in the company’s paultry cash reserves. You KNOW that Biden stands a better chance at


completing a coherent, logical sentence than this stock has at going up in price. YET YOU STILL


BUY! Why? The “CEO” knows from personal experience that taking your money is done with less


e�ort than taking candy from a baby (“a fool and his huge sums of money are soon parted… “),


And he is well protected from the many layers of beaureauocracy that go with international


commerce (therefore, he is laughing all the way to the WINS Financial bank with bag fulls of the


money from people like you). Yet there will, at the end of the day, be yet another Robinhood


novice, clicking on the “buy stock” tab at the end of the trading day. I just wanna know the


discordant psychology behind it all. After all, 1 + 1 = 3 seems to make more sense!
