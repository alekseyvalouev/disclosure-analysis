Rare Element Resources: Potential Short Opportunity
Oct. 21, 2010 5:06 AM ET105 comments
by: Shareholder Watchdog


We have witnessed a fair share of bubbles over the past 15 years: internet stocks,
housing, crude oil, and Chinese stocks. We have had some success in identifying
"bubbles" in individual stocks and warning the investment community about specific issues
(including HUSA at $20.35 see here and PCBC at $5.11 see here). Possibly the most
voracious bubble in recent memory is occurring with Rare Earth Element ("RE" or "RE
elements") stocks. We have done some work framing the opportunities and risks within
the RE elements space. After sifting through the hype, we believe there is tremendous risk
in RE stocks and highlight Rare Element Resources (AMEX: "REE" $12.74/ TSX: "REC")
as a potential short opportunity, or at least a stock investors should avoid.


Rare Element is a Canadian based company that owns the Bear Lodge mine located in
the northeastern corner of Wyoming. The stock price is up over 500% since early July and
over 65% in the past three days. With the euphoria of the strong move in RE element
stocks, speculators have bought first and asked questions later. We believe Rare Element
investors will wish they had done more diligence before piling into a company with a
potentially worthless plot of land. We believe Rare Element is a heavily promoted stock
with questionable management and massive risks to a business plan that under the
rosiest scenario will not be at full production until 2015 or 2016. By that time, we expect
the world could suffer from a glut of RE supplies. As a result, we believe current investors
face at least 70% downside from current levels.


Rare Earths - Not That Rare


"Rare earth elements" are 17 minerals on the periodic table. The elements are used in
various applications, typically in miniscule quantities. There is a reason many investors
had not heard of the RE elements since middle school science class. Simply, rare earth

elements represent a very small market. According to the USGS, a mere 124,000 tons of
RE were consumed worldwide representing a market size of LESS THAN $2 BILLION
(source: Reuters and USGS).


Over a year ago, stories began to appear about China's dominance in RE mining with
97% of the world's production and exploration efforts in South Africa, Brazil, Canada and
the United States (see this story dated September 2009 here). As with most hyped
spaces, this story has been recycled on a daily basis by news agencies, internet chat
rooms, and even company IR firms. Following the IPO of MolyCorp (NYSE: MCP) in July
and recent Chinese export quotas, RE element prices and stocks have skyrocketed.
China is now using its market clout in RE as a political statement, increasing export
quotas and withholding exports to Japan. The result has been a further spike in RE
element prices.


We believe elevated RE prices are a temporary phenomenon for two reasons. First, we
believe China will likely concede and begin exporting RE elements again as political
pressures mount. The Chinese have a history of flooding markets with a massive supply
of raw materials or end products, and could resume exporting and crush RE prices at any
time.


Second, the term "rare earth" is a misnomer. According to the USGS: "despite their name,
most rare earths are not particularly rare." The USGS estimates that the total worldwide
reserves of RE are 99 million tons, or 800 years of supply at current consumption rates.

China 36,000,000


United States 13,000,000


Soviet Union 19,000,000


Total Worldwide 99,000,000

In addition, most rare earth consumption takes place in China, which consumed 65% of
supply according to the USGS. Most of the goods produced in China with RE element
inputs actually end up as exports to the rest of the world (and these products are not

subject to any quotas). Japan consumes another 26% of supply, meaning these two
countries consume over 90% of worldwide supply. According to the USGS, the U.S.
imported less than 7,000 tons of RE in 2009 and actually exported a greater quantity than
it imported. (see here .pdf).


When MolyCorp's Mountain Pass mine is running in 2012, management has stated that
they expect to produce 20,000 tons of RE. This represents THREE TIMES the amount of
RE imported to the U.S. in 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that China's
Bayan Obo mine has more than 40 million tons of RE elements (see here), which is
enough to supply the world for over 300 years alone. Congress and the U.S. military have
also expressed concern for RE element needs for certain weapons. We estimate that the
demand by the U.S. military is likely less than 1,000 tons a year, and will easily be
addressed by Mountain Pass.

We expect the world to be awash in RE supply when/if Rare Element's Bear Lodge is
producing in 2015 or 2016. Currently, the worldwide demand for RE outside of China is a
meager 44,000 tons, and only 12,000 tons excluding Japan. While we view RE elements
as a growth market, we believe RE recycling and RE alternatives could mute market
growth. We reviewed plans for six public companies in the RE space, and combined,
they plan over 82,000 tons of production of RE per year [Lynas (OTCPK:LYSCF) (22k),
Arafura (20k), MCP (20k), Avalon (AVARF.PK) (5k), Quest Rare (5k), Rare Element
(10K)]. This represents almost two times the current demand outside of China and
excludes massive private projects in India, Brazil, South Africa, Australia and the US. One
estimate suggests that over a year ago there were 120 RE element mining projects
globally at various stages (see here). And this was BEFORE the recent spike in prices.
Given the massive expansion of worldwide RE mining, we expect the world to experience
a glut of RE elements by the time Rare Element's mine is up and running. As a result, we
believe it is a faulty assumption to extrapolate "bubble" pricing into future projections.


Red Flags at Bear Lodge


Turning our attention to the tiny Canadian speculative outfit, we could not help but find the
ticker amusing: REE. Sadly, we had immediate memories of the pain Internet.com created
near the top of the dot.com bubble. Rare Element currently has a market cap of over $400
million. Their latest financials show about $10 million of assets and zero revenues. They
had $5 million of cash on balance sheet at their last filing. According to their last 20-F,
Rare Element has two full-time employees and five part-time employees (see here).
This "exploration and development" company has spent less than $7,000.00 over the past
three years (see here). The management team has put out a steady stream of press
releases, but we have little doubt that these promotional releases will ultimately be
irrelevant for Rare Element until we are much closer to the middle of the decade.


The name of the property where Rare Element is conducting its RE element testing is
Bear Lodge, located in the northeast corner of Wyoming. Spartacus Capital, the
predecessor company to Rare Elements, acquired the Bear Lodge mine in 2002 for less
than $1 million. The company expects production of the plant to begin in 2015. According
the Rare Elements own documents, over the past 38 years, three highly sophisticated
mining companies, MolyCorp, Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL), and Duval Corporation, owned
and explored Bear Lodge for RE elements. After 44 drill holes, none these sophisticated
miners continued to drill, all choosing to abandon their efforts and eat the sunk costs. We
believe one of the reasons is the low ore grade of Bear Lodge. According to Rare
Element's investor presentation, Bear Lodge has an ore grade of 3.5%, less that half of

MolyCorp's Mountain Pass (8.2%) and a third of Lynas' Mount Weld (13.6%). Based on
our research (we ask readers to conduct their own research on this topic), this makes
Bear Lodge's prospects for successful operation extremely dependent on RE element
prices staying at existing levels. If our earlier assumption is correct (along with the
apparent conclusion of three highly sophisticated miners), and prices of RE elements
normalize, it will be uneconomical to mine Bear Lodge (assuming the asset even
possesses enough to participate in the future of this over supplied market). So while many
RE stocks have increased significantly on higher RE prices, most, including Rare
Elements, will never be in a position to take advantage of today's prices.


Given the abundance of RE elements worldwide, access to RE may not be that
problematic, but processing RE elements into usable raw materials is expensive, difficult
and environmentally destructive. In fact, Mountain Pass was originally shut down not only
due to a flood of cheap RE elements from China, but also for environmental concerns. To
justify Rare Element's lofty current market cap, we believe prices of RE not only need to
stay extremely high, but Rare Element must build processing capability. A Bryon
Securities report estimates this would cost Rare Elements $350 million. In addition, Rare
Elements would have to overcome significant permitting and environmental concerns,
along with significant start-up expenses. With two full employees, a tiny balance sheet,
and prospects for significant dilutive equity deals, common sense suggests something
does not pass the smell test.


We put little value on Rare Element's other projects: gold mining at Bear Lodge and Eden
Lake. Eden Lake is a property Rare Element acquired recently for less than $1 million.
Rare Element management also claims potential for gold mining. Earlier this year,
Newmont (NYSE: NEM) walked away from a JV they had with Rare Elements on this
property for a sum total of $27,000 worth of paid expenses (6/8/2010 filing outlines the
termination of their JV). Newmont will receive a net smelter royalty should anything be
found, but cut their losses on development and exploration (they spent almost $3 million in
development and refused to spend more). So Bear Lodge was basically given to them for
free by Freeport in exchange for a net smelter royalty, which they repurchased for a total
of $50,000 from Freeport and Newmont. Given the sophistication of Newmont, we believe
gold project offers little value.


Red Flags Around Management


The quality of a management team is extremely important for any small cap company. But
when your management bench is as small as Rare Element's, assessment of
management is vital. We found it curious that Rare Elements shares its address in their



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM
5/22/2018 Rare Element Resources: Potential Short Opportunity | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/231266-rare-element-resources-potential-short-opportunity 6/32


filings (325 Howe St., #410, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 1Z7) with at least
six other businesses (Pacific Opportunity Capital run by Chairman and CEO Donald
Ranta, CFO Mark T. Brown and Secretary Winnie Wong; Animas Resources [ANI.V];
Tenant Payment Systems; Avrupa Minerals LTD. [AVU.V] formerly Everclear Capital;
Cordova Industries; and Sutter Gold Mining Inc. [SGM.V].


Our concern was already elevated given the commingled nature of the office address, but
nothing could have prepared us for the shock of seeing management's bios and history.
Most management teams we talk to are consumed with running one company. We believe
it is a significant red flag that critical members of Rare Element's management team are
engaged with more than five companies currently. It is our understanding that Rare
Element's secretary Winnie Wong and CFO Mark T. Brown are principals of something
called Pacific Opportunity Capital LTD that shares office space with Rare Elements. Mark
T. Brown's bio in the 20-F lists 18 companies where he is the current or former CFO or
director. Almost all of these companies are Canadian-traded penny stocks. A simple
google news search reveals that Mark T. Brown has issued press releases for at least
three other companies in the past two weeks, including Pitchstone Exploration, Avrupa
Minerals and Tarsis.


Chairman and CEO Donald E. Ranta was previously with Greenstone Resources, a
mining play that is currently trading in the penny territory. Mr. Ranta is also on the board of
Avrupa Minerals, along with the CFO Mark T Brown and secretary Winnie Wong.
Secretary Winnie Wong was (until recently) also the secretary of Portal Resources
[PDO.V], an oil and gas penny stock. She is also the CFO for something called Avrupa
Minerals, currently trading in the 41 cent range in Canada. Then there’s Apoquindo
Minerals, of which she is also the corporate secretary, and there is Animas Resources
LTD [ANI.V] of which she is CFO (another 43 cent stock). She’s also been associated with
Fox Resources as their CFO, Deal Capital as President, and Mediterranean Minerals as
CFO.


Conclusion


One recent rational voice in RE elements is the CEO of Neo Materials [TSX: NEM],
Constantine Karayannopoulos. As a company with 85% market share in processing neo
powders, Karayannopoulos is heavily incentivized to promote RE elements. However, in
several recent presentations, he has expressed concerns around the bubble in RE
elements. By way of background, Neo Materials has exclusive access to mine heavy rare

earths at the Pitinga mine in Brazil, a fact investors have seemed to overlook when
comparing NEM's stock to other RE names. On September 15, 2010, Karayannopoulos
stated:


It's very, very dangerous for people to be committing hundreds of millions of dollars
to projects that will take another five years or more to see the light of day.


He went on to caution, as if he were specifically alluding to Rare Elements:


At the end of the day, rare earths are not that rare. Bubble economics aside, there
just isn't enough value in the ground to justify digging the stuff up and processing it.


While it is refreshing to hear a CEO talk candidly about the market, we believe
Karayannopoulos warning to investors has gone unnoticed.


We have recently begun our research on Rare Element Resources and are disturbed by
the red flags we have found. We believe momentum investors face significant risk in
speculating in shares at unjustifiable price levels. We view Rare Element's stock as the
definition of the greater fool's theory. When it breaks, there will not be one reasonable
investor to provide liquidity to the sellers on the way down. If RE element prices remain
high in five years, Bear Lodge could have some value. If we are correct and RE prices
drop given a glut in supply, the Bear Lodge mine could be worthless. We expect to report
back after conducting further due diligence.

substitution effects on demand put a cap on long-run prices. A sudden, unexpected shock to supply naturally
produces a price spike because everyone has to move along the short-run curves, but I agree with this post, that
basing a long-term investment plan on the hypothesis that the short-term price spike will hold up is highly risky.

One thing you don't seem to consider is the need for esp Japanese companies to get reliable long term sources for
REs. They will conclude longterm contracts with the miners - so a sudden flooding of the market by China won't
impact those miners that are able to secure such contracts. ImO this will be the miners that can start production within
the next 3-5 years.

I find my self on the side of the writer of this article, which suggests that rare earth elements are not that rare, if it is
true. especially when the share spiked this much in very short span of time without having production line in existance
to gain from the suplly glitch.

sorry, but the fact that a metal is called rare does not discount the fact that it is a rare commodity on a macro
perspective despite calls on this sector being labeled as a bubble. the trend of the world is changing yet the
infrastructure metals needed to underpin this new growth is fully underdeveloped-and the barriers to entry
meet so much environmental hurdles in addition to so many other challenges, it is not rational to discount the
rarity of this ferrous metal. Long term buy for foreseeable future despite erratic price movements due to its still
revived nacency.

Aren't rare earths rarer than gold and silver? If so then that to me means rare. Scientific American stated in an
interactive article about the world's resources that they expect silver and gold to be gone by 2029 and 2030.


So, if that is the case then they are rare earth elements. From what I have read the better concentration IE
%age like copper the easier it will be to extract them.


You can have a wide area and have to mine a heck of a lot of earth to get a decent amount. That will just
increase input costs.


From what I have seen even .5% to 2% are good finds.

not really rare
This is the first time I have seen a good factual article about rare earths. With the exception of Lanthanum and
Neodymium the commercial commercial demand for all of the other element is basically unknown (or only guessed)
and probably very very small. Think laboratory scale processing – not commercial scale.


China happens to have the largest known reserves because rare earths have been so uninteresting to exploration
companies that nobody bothered to look for it. By default they have a level of supply control, in effect, but only as long
as others – don’t pursue exploration elsewhere!


When Magnaquenchh (an 80's GM subsid) ran the business (before Neo Materials purchased it's patents) they used
to reduce prices every year to keep people out of the business. Most of Neo's assets were purchased from the
Chinese, they don’t mind digging it up and selling it but they didn’t want to do the refining.


No question that more rare (not really that rare) earths will found – but finding refiners to buy the output of these
supposed new mines will be much tougher.

rich enough to be mined economically is the trick. And finding a company that can mine, process, and bring

@EasyMike


I suggest you read a little more deeply on the subject. REO's are pretty easy to mine IF you have a
commercially viable deposit. You can go to Google Earth; put in "Mountain Pass California", and see real,
honest to god mine. It's a very small open pit mine; completely dwarfed in scale by the Kennecot copper
mine.


The refining process isn't technologically demanding either; it just requires a lot of water.


25 Oct 2010, 08:57 AM


EasyMike
I think we agree that Rare Earth Elements are not all that rare on a global measurement but finding a deposit
with high enough concentrations to mine commercially is why they command the price that they do. This price
has obviously skyrocketed recently and will make more deposits commercially viable to develop.


Maybe we disagree on what constitutes "easy to mine". The article linked below suggests that Rare Earth
mines need much more than "just a bunch of water" to extract the ore from the Earth. If you have evidence to
the contrary please share it as I'd rather have a more accurate world view than win an argument on the
internet.

REE partner Medallion Resources, (MLLOF.PK), ....(seekingalpha.com/symbo...) in Canada..., owns the 65% option
on the huge heavy rare earth area known as the Eden Lake Project . One of the two very big projects that Rare
Element Resources is developing alongside MLLOF.PK


The former CEO of REE, Dr. William Bird is the founder and CEO of MLLOF.PK


Dr. Bird is a renowned scientist, rare earth explorer and businessperson. He put REE on the map. One of the most
respected figures in the industry. A true legend.


Also, Dr. Bird has brought along with him the biggest names in rare earth science over to Medallion Resources.


More investors everyday are coming to the realization that Medallion Resources is a huge rare earth play. The stock
has just started to move up on volume. Some of it based on this news.


MLLOF.PK is a 10 to 12 dollar stock trading at .75 cents today.


In addition, it is a prime buyout candidate.

"By that time, we expect the world could suffer from a glut of RE supplies. As a result, we believe current investors
face at least 70% downside from current levels."


China said that rare earth supplies could run out in 20 years. Any commodity has a fixed supply. Unless better
methods of extraction are developed or more supply is found, commodity prices will continue to go up. So far, neither
has been achieved.

Ree is a 2 dollar stock that became a 12 dollar stock in two months, probably on buyout speculation. 
LYNAS will be first out with a fundamentally viable strategy for production and refined product, with a great tax deal
with the Malaysian government for the refining facility, and Mt. Weld is in Australia - a US ally. I bought some, it will be
a long time before it is in bubble territory.


Medallion Resources is a spec buy, I bought it for that purpose only, as it will be years before it produces anything,
though with some drilling and assays could show some upside. And buyout speculation.


REE has just shown what is possible - amazing upside with maximum hype. I enjoyed the article, though the notion of
shorting anything other than REE is something I would avoid, though REE is rolling over this morning in pre-market,
who knows what the market hype will bring, despite the very real concerns of the authors.

Why don't YOU call the SEC? What exactly are you going to tell them? That someone who has a negative
opinion on a stock (for excellent reasons - $350 mil market cap, no revenue, two full time employees and no
production for at least 4-5 years!!!) and discloses his position has written a non-paid article on an investment
Web Site? OH MY GOSH!


I'm sure you think those company issued press releases are the unvarnished truth. Good luck sucker. I just
doubled my money overnight with the Nov 12.5 puts, and I will gladly sell them to you when the share price
goes back to 8 or 9.

Yep thats PUMP and DUMP. It must be nice to short a ton of stock and write a big negative article and have
Yahoo finance post it like it was NEWS. The writer is a DUMP and PUMPER, with his little BS disclosure at
the bottom. 
SCAMMER


21 Oct 2010, 03:16 PM

Well if I did call them I woud tell them there is manipulation in the stock because the writer sold it short first
and then published a "News article" to capitialize on his investment. Your punk ass I guess was not smart
enough to pull it off though, you just got lucky. I don't even have a position in this stock, but in Medallion. Its a
spec. play on the rare earths. 
If the writer was legit he would publish the article and then short it. That would be called CREDIBLE

The author's claim that the annual turnover of REO's is $2B is based on old prices. If one looks at a basket price per
kg of ore at spot prices and extrapolates for the industry using Lynas' ore distribution of roughly $50/kg the present
annual turnover of the market is over $6B.


21 Oct 2010, 09:41 AM


Deepfryer999
"they plan over 82,000 tons of production of RE per year [Lynas (LYSCF.PK) (22k), Arafura (20k), MCP (20k), Avalon
(AVARF.PK) (5k), Quest Rare (5k), Rare Element (10K)]. This represents almost two times the current demand
outside of China..."


Maybe so, but current demand isn't what anyone cares about. Markets are forward-looking, and REE's are used in a
lot of high-tech industries like electric cars, LCD screens, and wind turbines. I think we will see increased demand for
REE's, and companies like Lynas Corp in particular could produce great returns going forward.


21 Oct 2010, 09:48 AM


Duude
Interesting to note while this SA blog seems to have triggered a short in REE, Molycorp (MCP) is at the same time
reacting to a favorable story from Bloomberg. I think Molycorp is just a setup for an even bigger short being they need
to come up with a very large capital infusion and have no operating income. Its likely the company will need to push
out another offering of stock when they think the timing is right.

I actually pay 'The Original Rare Earth Bug', James Dines to do research on these rare earths mines and advise me. 
Outstanding results!


21 Oct 2010, 10:25 AM


EasyMike
As do I IndidnaJohn!  
But the speed at which this stock jumped scared me out of it. I took my 170% profit last week and I'm calling it
good for a while on this one. Still in on a few other RE plays including Great Western Minerals which isn't
reccommended by Dines but is by Jack Lifton, a contributer here on SA and a guy who sounds like he knows
more about the RE industry than Dines does.


I recommend reading Lifton's work and contrasting a few of his ideas with Dines' if you're really interested in
this sector.

You do not have to take a lot of risk to invest in rare earth potential. Lynas will have an operating mine in 2011. Great
Western (at low end of prices) has 7 potential projects, but also has 2 operating companies that process rare earth
output from other miners. I passed on Avalon (even though price is increasing currently) and never seriously
considered REE.

I agree that RE stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves. But it is too simplistic to compare RE deposits on ore
grades. Other factors such as RE element content, metallurgical complexity, mining method, and upstream refining
products also need to be considered. Also, Bear Lodge is still being explored, so the grade is still not firmed up.


21 Oct 2010, 01:26 PM

Dear Shareholder Watchdog,


That is quite the misnomer. While I believe that REE's pricing has gone above what I would consider a "conservative"
value, I would repsectfully suggest that not only do you have no idea as to what you are talking about both with regard
to REE and the entire sector.


I do not have the time to even try to dissect this point by point, but you would think that you could at least have done
the minimal diligence. For example, REE's management team are some of the best in the industry and widely
respected. Notwithstanding your "hard charging" "research" that consisted of a Google search.


You might be fine shorting REE at these levels, sure, anything above $8 is above my comfort level as far as
conservative pricing goes. But then again you might get blown up and blown up hard. There are many good stories to
short, this is not one of them.


As I warned another author who boasted about being short MCP at $27, if you get your little move downward, be
ready to cover and close fast...

yetisoup23
Actually, I think the article was rather well researched. It contains lots of facts, along with the sources they
came from, unlike your comment. "you don't know what you're talking about" isn't much of a counter-
argument.


You say that proof of the author's ignorance is that there is no distiguishing between light and heavy rare
earth elements. But, as a geologist I can tell you that you are mistaken. "Light" REE's include scandium
through samarium, and the "heavy" REE's are the rest (europium through lutetium).


Nice try clown.


21 Oct 2010, 03:49 PM

To Yetisoup23: knowing names of light vs. heavy rare elements proves nothing.


22 Oct 2010, 05:19 AM


yetisoup23
You miss my point. The original poster said there was no distinguishing between light and heavy REEs, and
cited this "fact" as proof of the author's cluelessness about the industry. When, in fact, his fact is just plain
wrong.


This is a company with a $300m market cap, two full time employees, zero revenue, zero production (except
for copious press releases). If you think the stock is going up, buy it. Hopefully you have some capital gains
you can offset with the money you will lose.


22 Oct 2010, 08:22 AM

How dumb are you. I stated that the author did not distinguish between the two and the importance of each.

21 Oct 2010, 03:42 PM


findthelawyer
with all due respect, your calculations are really amateurish. Your calculation is based that world consumption will
remain at same level, which is not very scientific. With new technologies requiring more and more of these rare
elements whether for manufacturing process or end product, you cannot really base such complex demand on simple
flat demand over the years!


If you missed such a factor, then I find it hard to take your analysis seriously. Also remember that China and India with
almost 1/3 of the world population, will likely have a heavy demand for more finished goods as their standards of living
improve and rely more on domestic economic growth then exports, thereby limiting more exports to the West as their
demands increase just as well.


Plus I find it very interesting that you have shorted the shares and then decided to print this article online.


Not impressed.


21 Oct 2010, 05:43 PM


stockferret
A large portion of the articles here are written by people that have no position in the stock (with the gold evangelists
being the other notable exception). That sets this one apart and should warn anyone reading it that the credibility
factor should be questioned. This is only a well researched article to someone who has only the most basic
knowledge of REEs.


However, if you have a large enough following and the float is small enough you can certainly influence the stock. So
congrats on that. I'm sure we will be hearing from the author when he closes his position. Naturally, that will be after it
is closed and not before. No one wants to hurt their returns by being ethical.


In any case, there are many complicated factors that are driving the REE sector's story and this introductory level
article barely touches on them. I encourage anyone interested in the facts behind REEs to do their own research
starting with people who are actual experts in the field. Start with Rare Metal Blog or with Dudley Kingsnorth and work
your way from there.

Good research "Watch dog". I find it HYSTERICAL that there are those that seem to think that you are immoral for
shorting the stock and then writing a report with significant references that support your position yet are entirely
comfortable that those that go LONG are able to write REAMS of promotional material.....*shakes head*


In my 25 ears in the business I have been o both sides of this...owned junior stocks and ignored the well researched
warnings as well as been short on over hyped 'stories'


I'm not going to put my money either side on this one BUT.....I'd say this stock is in the middle of a classic stock
promotion. Don't know how high it goes...Don's know when it will break....just know that it will......good luck everyone
and remember the best way to make money is to not loose it.


Lets hope the "technicals" continue to look strong.

Good call. Every one recognizes REE as a bubble. But few dared to call to its face and short it. There are just too
many clueless dummies in the market place. You never know how long the rare earth fever will run and when does
the bubble burst.


I wish people realize that as China wages war on rare earth elements, China must be fully aware of something it does
NOT have, and it must need. Shouldn't China be stocking up what it painfully lacks first, before launching a resource
war on something it has plenty of?


That element, is the precious metal palladium. The mining plays, luckily, there are only two good palladium mining
play: SWC and PAL. Read the most recent news on palladium:

Mark Anthony, Contributor
I am not calling the rare earth metals a bubble. I am calling REE the stock a bubble. But I feel it's probably still
too pre-mature to short REE. It's getting too much media exposure right now. Normally a bubble takes a pretty
long time to be nurtured and there are lots of people jumping in too early to short it.

Great thing I was not quite convinced of teh REE short storytwo months ago. It might be truw that REE may
be over-valued. But who is counting. Premature short is dangerous.


I see no good short in today's market. Iam all longs on resource stocks, particularly palladium mining stock
SWC and PAL. I think people need to pay more attention of what's going on in the coal mining sector lately, as
the Australian port is flooded, causing a surge of coal price.

While I agree REE is a hype job, the number of employees is not important. PDLI has 7 employees and has a
market cap of over $800 million. No one calls it a scam. It has valuable patents and is runoff through whne the
patents expire. What matters is that REE doesn't have the assets to back its cap, a pure spec play on a mine
that cost $1 million. Hmm, why did it only cost a million?

IMHO you are right about REE and I appreciate your reporting. However, the argument that "Rare" does not apply to
"Rare Earths" really belongs to the theoretical realm. What counts is what deposits are proven, permitted, accessible,
have water (yes WATER that other "rare" resource), and are Economic... Profitable. ... and, of course who controls the
market is another issue. Who cares about USGS figures and conference room debates? Where Rare Earths are
concerned - we clearly have some interesting times ahead. Mahalo!

i agree with you. a lot of the commentators here are thinking very short term and thinking in terms of current
P/Es. This is a dynamic sector that is not a simple type of commodity. it has a lot of downstream ramifications.
not enough commentators here are thinking long term strategic importances of this sector and the actual
quantifiable supply.


22 Oct 2010, 04:42 AM


SerrCo, Contributor
Jeanny, your comments give the impression of someone who is new to investing and has never been burned
by a classic pump and dump.


Every successful pump and dump has a somewhat legitimate story behind it. With all the press and hype
surrounding rare earth metals, this stock was tailor made for mass mail pump and dump shops.


Its clear that you are long this stock. Having never been burned by a pump and dump, you really have to look
yourself in the mirror and ask if your desire for the stock to appreciate is biasing your judgement.


You have to be honest with yourself about what you know and what you don't.


There are plenty of analysts following Molycorp and the other legitimate RE companies, theres absolutely
none following REE. All REE owns is a property that has passed through the hands of numerous other
legitimate miners. Go to REE's website and look at their economic assessment of their project. Even
assuming a substantial increase in the price of REs, the NAV of the whole project is $280 million when
applying a 15% discount rate (appropriate for a speculative risky venture such as RE mining). They would
also need to raise an additional 70 million to finance the project, and with only ~$15 million on hand, the likely
route is a dilutive equity offering.


The RE story might be compelling, and certainly makes for great headlines, but that doesn't make any
valuation of REE acceptable. Consider this, Molycorp's CEO went on CNBC's Fast Money last night and
admitted that RE prices are now a bubble, and any business plans based on current prices is extremely
naive. Bubbles can form and be dramatic, I think your smart enough to realize that.


I hope you don't have a lot of money riding on REE, there are a lot more established companies which would
serve your savings much better.

I did just that, a couple weeks ago - I did as much DD on LYNAS as was available form the comfort of my
living room with a computer, and came to the simple conclusion that I needed to invest in this equity.
nevermind that (for some reason) I paid a higher commission.


The corporate website provides very clear info, and they can execute their business plan without a hitch - as I
appears to anyone


I am impressed by the trading in LYNAS, it seems to me a measured response, without wild swings. The
smart money is still buying, and the stock has climbed consistently. I will need info on institutional ownership
as i continue to hold it - though I see a nice long trend continueing.


I only have doubts about a name that sounds like "lyin'azzz"


Great plans, end execution looks like it can't fail.


As the old timers would say "Ther's gold in them thar' hills",


and it may be that the REE's as a commodity will find a larger market of interest in the coming years.
Nevermind the last months and days.

1. There is starting to be a global panic because of the control of the production by China. There are .pdfs out
by both the UK and US governments.


2. Emerging markets will also need REE just like they need any other natural resource. Heck just extra
demand from China and India alone will keep prices high.

Thanks for the comment rpontius! 
Went in long on MCP a few days ago, but only took a small profit before existing. China will not be unstrategic
as to cause worldwide panic over this minor commodity, because its own country would ultimately be affected.
It owns roughly 40% of the US debt... But they are definitely trying to incentivize other countries to start
developing their own resources because China wants to compete on the downstream products now, not on
the raw commodity. Happy trading~

I'd go long MCP before I'd do anything else.


Rare earth elements aren't actually that rare; they occur in the Earth's crust in levels comparable to Copper for the
more common REE's; none are more rare than Antimony - a farily common metal most commonly used to make lead
alloys harder.


MolyCorp owns the rights to the world's pre-eminent ore deposit at Mountain Pass, CA. This was the worlds only
source for REE's prior to the 1950's; the mine is already developed and there is ore processing on site.


The Mountain Pass deposit contains enough REE's to supply the entire world for more than 1000 years at current
consumption rates. Mining isn't difficult (it's an open pit mine, and quite small compared to typical mines), processing
the ores is low tech, basically, the REO's (rare earth oxides) are water soluble so the processing involves dissolving
the REO's in water, separating the foreign materials, then precipitating the REO's back out.


The MP mine was closed a number of years ago after repeated waste water spills from rupture pipes between the
refining operation and evaporation ponds a few miles away.


And there are RE deposits all over the world, thousands of them... There's a nice spread sheet you can download
from the USGS outlining them.


The reason the Chinese ore load and the Mountain Pass ore load are much more useful than the formation in
Wyoming is that the type of mineral in Wyoming carries much more radioactive contaminats than the other two; and
the average REO concentration in the Chinese and California deposits are MUCH higher - about 5% REO by weight
in China, and about 8% REO by weight in California.


It's hard to tell if MCP is overbought - they've only ben a NYSE ticker for a few months; but they've double in price
since the IPO.


MCP is currently processing ore mined before the mine was closed; the intend to re-open the mine within a year.


I'd be short Lynas and long MCP.

"ramifications for the military" 
www.bloomberg.com/news... 
"China’s control of the $1.2 billion market for rare-earth elements gives it “market power” over the U.S., the
Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in a report in April." 
Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week that it’s “urgently necessary” to boost European investment in eastern
Europe and Central Asia to counter expanding Chinese interest in rare minerals.

The substance of the negative comments on this article do little to refute the basis of the research. What I see in the
commentary is anger that is light on factual rebuttal. I agree with TraderMark on this one. Two employees. It certainly
looks like an operation that bought an abandoned property no one could find potential in and now are hyping it based
on all the hype rare earth is receiving. I thank the author for bringing this one to our attention. All of the arguments
about rare earth, correct or wrong have little to do with a company that doesn't produce any.

I note with interest the fact that TD Ameritrade as of this writing has no shares of REE available for shorting. Very
interesting given the fact that REE has traded over 7 million shares today. Note to all you REE bulls, your shares have
been loaned out.

With regards to RE being in a bubble, China is only following through on their stated policy - see "Rare-Earth Furor
Overlooks China's 2006 Industrial Policy Signal" link 
'www.bloomberg.com/news...'


In March 2010 the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS) published the following U.S. Army’s Foreign
Military Studies Office, Fort Leavenworth, KS study of the Rare Earth industry 'www.lynascorp.com/cont...'.


Has anyone else read this study ?


It begins by saying "China is faced with its own internal 
issues that, if not addressed, could soon stress the country's rare earth industry."


On page 21 it says "As far back as 1991, China’s State Council listed rare earth ore as a specially designated type of
ore for national-level protective extraction."


On page 22 it says "Prices fell due to oversupply on the international market and price wars among Chinese
suppliers, in particular smaller players. In 2008 and 2009, China began implementing regulations to place greater
controls on the rare earth industry." ... "The goal for controlling the rare earth industry in China is “to prevent over-
exploitation and blind competition, and to advance the effective protection and scientific, rational use of these superior
mineral resources."


On page 23 it says "New regulations to protect the environment 
China does not have pollutant discharge standards for the rare earth industry. Environmental issues behind the
mining of rare earth elements are a huge concern. The differences between Western mining efforts and those seen in
China today are staggering. Aware of the problem, the local government is reporting to be trying to find ways to
improve the situation."


On page 24 it says "China is able to operate its rare earth 
mines at one third the cost in part because of the country’s lax environmental standards. Additionally, efforts to clean
up China’s environment will require government funding and increased oversight, and would likely cost billions of
dollars."


The global economy has been obtaining these materials at rock bottom prices while their production has been at
enormous environmental expense due to carelessly discarding radioactive material and other materials extremely
hazardous to human health.


Barriers to entry for non-Chinese producers is that rare earth production is a time consuming and highly complex
while Chinese producers have been able to take shortcuts due to lax environmental regulation.

I agree that REE is overvalued. That is why I own Stans Energy. This is a rare earth company which purchased a past
producing mine in Kyrgyzstan. The mine had previously produced 80% of the soviet union's production until 1991
when it was placed on care and maintenance. Stans mine is not as large as Avalon's but it will be the first new mine in
production (late 2012). What I like about the stock is that not too many people know about it. 
I have a write up about the company on my blog at:

Kinda reminds me of 1999, wish I had gotten in early so I could be taking profits! (something I was too greedy to do

Living in Wyoming and being familiar with mine permitting processes, I would be shocked if this were online in 2015.
As near as I can tell, the project is located approximately 10 miles from a national monument (Devil's Tower) and is
located in a national forrest. I'm pretty sure there is going to be some permitting challenges to overcome.

risk then would be if the NI 43-101 found no mineable grades, and that we won' t know for a while. Until then, very
little risk of this going down to a couple of dollars. And the upshot? Fuggetabout it. China has admitted to running out
of the heavies in 15 yrs at current depletion and demand. Its probably worse than they admit, thats why they are
talking to all the others about off take aggreements, private placements and buyouts. REE and even more so ucore

REE seems to have a 'home court advantage' of being an American listed stock, while the far more realistic
investment Lynas Corp is a pink sheet listing for Americans. Lynas will come on line next year, along with Moly Corp.


Properties that are not in actual production and not within a year of production may well lose out as the shortage is
now, not 2-3 years from now.


Still, it has been said that a wind turbine uses a ton of rare earth magnets and we are currently in a position for wind
power to quickly expand. One of the delays for wind power was that national defense radars were confused by them
on shorelines. But now, holographic radar allows radar to work alongside wind farms.

has imposed restrictions on their export.  
The world’s top consumers of rare earths, especially Asian neighbor Japan, have rung the alarm bell in recent weeks,
accusing China of disrupting exports of the vital minerals — a charge Beijing has repeatedly denied. 
Shipments have nevertheless been disrupted, and a top official in Tokyo has warned that Japan’s stockpile could run
out by March. Japan and Vietnam are now set to sign a deal on joint development of rare earth reserves.


A commonly held view among officials in Beijing is that rare earth policies in the past were like “selling gold to
foreigners at the price of Chinese radishes,” Damien Ma, an analyst at Eurasia Group, wrote in a research note. 
Since 2006, China has cut export quotas on rare earths by 5 percent to 10 percent a year. Production has also been
slashed amid concerns that Chinese supplies could run out in 15 years. 
China’s Ministry of Commerce has said it reserves the right to slash rare earths exports again to “protect exhaustible
resources and sustainable development” in an industry that is notoriously chaotic, with illegal mining rampant, and
highly polluting.

"protect exhaustible resources"??? Are you KIDDING me?


At current production rates it would take HUNDREDS OF YEARS for the one mine currently in production to
play out.


The deposit several hundred mega-tons @ 5%+ REO concentration. Current annual worldwide consumption
of REO's is a couple hundred tons.

I see a lot of good arguments, pro and con, as to the strategic importance of rare earth elements. However this thread

Tells me all I needed to know. Quote from next to last paragraph of USGS report:


"Undiscovered resources are thought to be very large relative to expected demand."


IOTW, normal cost for REO's in the long term will be only slightly higher than mining and refining cost. Which
tells me that REO producers in developed economies (the US, Europe) will never be profitable, long term,
because of costs imposed by environmental controls.


Producers in Central Asia; Africa, SE Asia, and South America will be the ones who can make money on this
play. Sorry, REE. Sorry, Lynas.


And once another 3rd world producer is on line, sorry MCP.

"Producers in Central Asia; Africa, SE Asia, and South America will be the ones who can make money on this

Interesting idea. Lynas will be online, producing and selling rare earths in 2011.


When will all these "hypothetical producers" come online start stealing their business? 5 years from now? 10

Plain and simple, Rare Earths are a commodity play. And as with commodity plays, there are 3 positions - producers,
end-users, and speculator. But it far more complex than the usual commodity play.


Lynas is reportedly very well positioned and the leader with ready production and ore that is 3 times higher in quality
than REE. It is also twice as high as Moly. Sure, there are rare earths all over the world, but the concentration of an
ore deposit AND the size of the ore deposit will dictate who are the key players. Heavy rare earths may be more
expensive than the lighter ones, but the reality is that they are not in such high demand either - mostly for controller
rods in nuclear reactors. And materials for magnets may be the highest in demand, but the easiest to mine.


We are seeing new players jump in with a mining reports of limited worth. And we are seeing the 'also rans', such as
REE being (with 7 million USD invested) touted as good as a company roughly $300 million USD committed to
development AND processing.


At the end of the day, the current shortage of supply has been exposed in world-wide press, but the realistic
projections for demand are no where to be found.


To make matters worse, no where near all 17 of the rare earth elements have attractive market conditions, but the
mines must dig up and sort through the whole pile. Tons of junk have to be set aside with hopes that an eventual
market for it will come forth.

"This "exploration and development" company has spent less than $7,000.00 over the past three years..."


I canNOT find anything in the financial to support the above claim (As I read the documents, it seems at least 100
times that figure has been spent in the past 3 years), but the fact that REE is merely a mining property - not a
producing mine and not a refiner of REEs means that the climb in price is rather unwarrented. Also, one should
compare the assay reports of the quality of the ore and the drilling reports for the size of the deposit before jumping in
the bandwagon. It seems Lynas is much better positioned to deliver product and profit from it. But Lynas is a pink
sheet stock in the US - so it seems to be unpopular to Americans that rather buy these non-producing mining
properties over positioning with a future major player in global supply of Rare Earths.


Avalon has now announced that they have costed a refining plant at about $350 million and are beginning to plan. But
meanwhile Moly is producing and Lynas is months away from production (with the cash to pay for their refining plant).


Buying REE is like buying a beautiful piece of undeveloped property, but when you need a well, sewage, a road into
the property, and a telephone - more money will be required.


I bought REE on speculation on Friday for 10.50/share; after reading this article I dumped it today at 10.60/share. I
can sleep better with holding Lynas for the long haul.

Worthless? Doesn't seem worthless to me.


"In 1983, the U. S. Geological Survey released Professional Paper 1049D, entitled “Geology and Description of
Thorium and Rare-Earth Deposits in the Southern Bear Lodge Mountains, Northeastern Wyoming.” The report
concludes that the area contains “the largest deposit of disseminated rare-earth elements in North America.” Since
then, exploration by major companies has discovered several higher-grade rare-earth-bearing dikes, which add
significantly to the project’s potential. 
Between 1982 and 1991, FMC Corporation, Newmont Exploration, Inc, Hecla Mining Company, International Curator
Resources Ltd and Coca Mines, Inc explored the area for gold. Mineralization was discovered in the East and West
breccia deposits (now owned by Rare Element Resources) that Hecla estimated at 8.2 million short tons averaging

Long-Short Value, Contributor
Two points this story misses that make it's argument wrong:


1) Supply of Rare Earth Elements is not the issue, the processing capacity is the issue. There is plenty of Rare Earth
Element around the world, you probably have some in the ground around your home, but the problem is these
resources are very spread out and hard to capture all at one location as well as process (in this case usually refine
into a highly concentrated substance usable by industry)


2) The demand you describe is flat with no growth what so ever for the next 4-5 years. This is not the case the
demand of these resource will increase substantially as we build more electric and hybrid cars, as well as other
"Green" technology.

This however is a supply and demand glut. There is basically NO operational mines outside of China, the
supply source, and China is cutting back. Yes, rare earths are not that rare, but you can't make a mine
overnight. It takes years. So while new mines a forming, everybody is scrambling over the now limited rare
earth supply. And past demand cannot really calculate future demand, because we did not have as many
hybrid cars back then now did we have the iPad. And future demand for both is strong.
