Cardtronics: Aggressive Accounting And Secular Decline Drive 40-
70% Downside

Summary


Cardtronics, an owner and operator of ATMs, is a levered bet on paper currency
usage, which is in secular decline. Yet it trades at a rich valuation (26x 2014 EPS).


Aggressive depreciation accounting inflates reported earnings by 50-70%.
Cardtronics depreciates ATMs over ~9 years; peers use 5 years. ATM upkeep and
obsolescence are very real economic costs.


Serial acquisitions have boosted results, but returns are declining as new ATMs -
typically situated in locations with less foot traffic - have been far less profitable than
legacy ATMs.


7-Eleven is Cardtronics's largest customer (24% of revenue, ~40% of earnings). This
contract is at immense risk of being undercut by Seven Bank, a 7-Eleven sister
company.


Based on the valuations of comparables as well as our DCF analysis, we believe
CATM should trade at $9-$19, 40-70% below the current stock price.


We are short shares of Cardtronics (NASDAQ:CATM), the largest non-bank owner and
operator of ATMs, primarily in the US and UK.


To read about our findings, please view our slide presentation and full report.


CATM's core business is installing ATMs inside brick-and-mortar retailers like 7-Eleven
and CVS, where high foot traffic generates withdrawals that in turn generate surcharge
fees (paid by consumers) and interchange fees (paid by card-issuing banks). In addition,
banks sometimes pay CATM to put their brands on its devices or to offer surcharge-free
withdrawals to their customers.


Despite its exclusive focus on the secularly declining ATM market, CATM trades at the rich
valuation of a high-growth firm, with trailing and forward P/E ratios of 37x and 26x,
respectively, 53% higher than the S&P 500 median. Moreover, we believe that CATM has
inflated its earnings via aggressive accounting. It depreciates its ATMs over much longer

periods than its competitors do - more than eight years rather than five years - thereby
understating expenses. Applying a five-year average life to CATM's assets would have
reduced EPS in 2013 from $0.86 to just $0.19.


While CATM's press releases paint an optimistic picture of organic growth, its SEC filings
show that domestic same-store transaction growth has slowed markedly, from 3.8% in Q1
2012 to just 0.4% in Q1 2014. A recently released Federal Reserve study confirms that
total ATM withdrawals in the US are already declining. Essentially, CATM is a
concentrated bet on paper currency and retail foot traffic - stunningly at odds with the
direction in which the world is moving. CATM management has distracted investors from
these relentless secular trends through an aggressive roll-up strategy that has consumed
more than 100% of its free cash flow over the past three years. But diminishing returns
have pushed RoA from 8.9% in 2010 to 4.3% in 2013, and new ATMs have come on at
41% lower per-unit gross profitability than legacy ATMs.


Making matters worse, CATM also faces an existential threat as its largest merchant
relationship, 7-Eleven - which we estimate accounts for ~40% of its earnings - comes up
for renewal in 2017. A sister company of 7-Eleven's that operates all of the chain's ATMs
in Japan is rapidly expanding in the US and openly pursuing the contract. If it succeeds, it
would be catastrophic for CATM.


In light of its numerous risks, and based on comparable firms' far lower valuations along
with our DCF analysis, we believe that CATM's fair value is only $9-$19 per share, or 40-
70% below the current stock price.


I. Investment Highlights


Roll-up strategy yields declining returns on capital while organic growth
deteriorates. After a three-year hiatus, CATM has re-embarked on an acquisition
spree, gobbling up 13 companies in the last three years. From 2011 to 2013, CATM
spent more than 100% of its free cash flow on acquisitions. Meanwhile, "same-store"
transaction volume at its US ATMs has slowed drastically to 0.4%, net growth in ATMs
(excluding acquired units) turned negative in 2013, and average revenue per
withdrawal fell three years in a row. In its 2013 Q1 10-Q, management guided to a
"more normal range of 3-5%" same-store transaction growth. In reality, growth was
-1.0%, 2.7%, 1.7%, 1.7%, and 0.4% over the past five quarters, never even reaching
the low end of the range. CATM has deflected investors away from these weak organic
numbers by promoting its aggressive roll-up strategy. However, this strategy has
generated diminishing returns: CATM's return on invested capital dropped from 14.5%

in 2010 to 9.1% in 2013, and its return on assets fell from 8.9% to 4.3%, representing
declines of 37% and 52%.


Aggressive accounting overstates true earnings power. Despite the simplicity of its
business, CATM management and sell-side analysts focus on "adjusted" earnings
rather than GAAP. But the spread between GAAP and "adjusted" has grown wider with
every passing year: while adjusted EPS grew 93% from 2010 to 2013, GAAP EPS fell
10%, from $0.96 to $0.86, even after adding back a UK tax charge. "Adjusted"
numbers that exclude transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, and
amortization costs let management off the hook for the real costs of its M&A-driven
strategy. Furthermore, we believe that CATM's capital expenditures are dominated by
maintenance and replacement costs, not growth investments. Yet CATM appears to be
exaggerating its earnings by aggressively assuming long average lives for its ATMs. If
CATM assumed a five-year life, in line with its peers' accounting, then depreciation in
2013 would be $44 million higher, cutting GAAP EPS from $0.86 to just $0.19.
Reinforcing the case against CATM's inadequate depreciation are the facts that (1) it
consistently sells used machines for less than their carrying values, and (2) it
repeatedly underestimates near-term capital-expenditure requirements.


ATM usage is declining at an accelerating pace - a secular trend that is only
getting started. Though CATM management and sell-side analysts pour scorn on the
straw-man argument that cash will vanish overnight, the utility of ATMs need not go to
zero for CATM's value to be dramatically impaired. In the US, Federal Reserve data
confirm that declining ATM usage is already a reality, not some far-off forecast: cash
withdrawals grew at a 0.3% CAGR from 2003 to 2009 but fell at a 1.1% CAGR from
2009 to 2012. Given population growth, this implies that per-capita withdrawals have
been declining since at least 2003, and the decline is now accelerating. It's no wonder,
then, that independent ATM deployers, CATM's competitors, rate "declining
transactions" and "ATM saturation" as their top two concerns. Overseas trends are
similar: ATM withdrawals are declining in the eurozone, countries like Sweden and
Australia are increasingly becoming cashless, and groups like the Gates Foundation
are pushing for the rapid adoption of electronic payments in developing nations.
Despite CATM's valiant attempts to use M&A to paper over these trends, CATM is a
concentrated bet on paper currency and retail foot traffic. We view CATM's aggressive
shift toward M&A as a tacit admission that it faces secular decline in its existing
operations and hopes to escape the inevitable by paying up for growth.

Upcoming contract expiration puts largest customer - and 24% of revenue - at
risk. In 2007, CATM acquired 7-Eleven's US ATM fleet in a transformational deal that
made the convenience-store chain CATM's largest customer. Since then, however, the
Japanese ATM operator Seven Bank - almost 50% owned by 7-Eleven's Japanese
parent company, Seven & i Holdings - has entered the US market by outbidding CATM
on two acquisitions, with a clear long-term goal of replacing CATM as 7-Eleven's ATM
partner. Seven Bank already serves in this role in Japan. Given CATM's outsized
exposure to this single merchant, constituting 24% of its 2013 pro forma revenue and,
by our estimates, 40% of earnings, the loss of 7-Eleven would be devastating. Even if
CATM manages to extend the contract in 2017, the genie is out of the bottle: over the
long term, Seven & i wants to bring the ATM business back into the fold, and CATM is
at its mercy.


Premium valuation unwarranted given enormous near-term and long-term risk.
Adjusted for capital structure, CATM trades at a massive premium to DirectCash, its
leading Canadian competitor, as well as to firms like NCR and Deluxe that are similarly
exposed to the secular decline in paper-based payments (but are seeking to diversify
instead of doubling down like CATM). DirectCash trades at 8.2x EV/EBITA, while
CATM trades at a lofty 13.4x - 64% higher. Averaging together a wider peer group
suggests that CATM should be valued at 9.3xEV/EBITA, implying a share price of $19,
41% lower than the current price. From a longer-term perspective, our bottoms-up
DCF, which extrapolates CATM's profit drivers in a world with modestly declining per-
ATM transaction volumes, produces a fair value of just $9 per share, 72% below the
current stock price. Thus CATM's stock appears to price in many years of rapid growth
while completely neglecting the risks of deteriorating profitability, client attrition,
overstated earnings, and long-term obsolescence.


II. Situation Overview


Below is a snapshot of CATM's valuation metrics and a reconciliation from reported
earnings to management's "adjusted" earnings, as well as our estimates of the impact of
normalizing depreciation expense based on a shorter average ATM life.

Below is a five-year summary of CATM's financial results. Although revenue has increased
rapidly, driven by the total size of the ATM fleet, the vast majority of this growth has been
acquired. Organic growth in units (stemming, for example, from developing relationships
with new retailers) has been modest, same-store transaction growth has decelerated
sharply, and revenue per withdrawal has fallen for years.

analysis


Relative to other firms with large exposures to paper-based payment media, CATM is a
clear outlier on valuation. On an EV/EBITA basis - even without adjusting for CATM's
understated depreciation expense - it trades at a 64% premium to its closest comparable,
a Canada-based multinational ATM operator called DirectCash. Compared to other firms
like Brink's (an armored courier), Deluxe (a check printer), and NCR (an ATM
manufacturer), the results are similar, implying 41% downside to CATM's stock price.

While the comparable and DCF analyses above take CATM's current level of earnings as
their starting point, the company's heavy reliance on 7-Eleven renders that assumption
optimistic. The convenience-store chain generates 24% of CATM's revenue, and based on
information on ATM counts from 7-Eleven we estimate that its ATMs generate twice as

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 9/47


much revenue per unit as CATM's overall average. As a result of ATM-level fixed costs,
this means that 7-Eleven must generate a disproportionate amount of earnings relative to
revenue - approximately 40% of CATM's total, according to our calculations. Even if CATM
doesn't lose the contract entirely to 7-Eleven's sister firm Seven Bank (or another
competitor), the existence of a serious challenger gives 7-Eleven an excellent opportunity
to renegotiate the agreement on terms more adverse to CATM.


Another factor distorting CATM's current reported earnings is its aggressive approach to
accounting for depreciation. While other large ATM operators almost uniformly depreciate
their assets over a five-year average useful life, CATM appears to assume a much more
aggressive eight-to-nine-year schedule, giving an enormous boost to stated earnings. The
company's assumptions weren't always so aggressive: in 2006 it depreciated property and
equipment over "three to seven years," but by 2013 the time frame had quietly extended
to "three to ten years." With a host of technology and regulatory changes (along with
normal wear and tear) forcing ATM upgrades, replacement costs are very large and very
real, yet CATM is implying that its current fleet will last for a decade.


When analyzing CATM, we are reminded of the pay-phone industry. In the mid-1990s, pay
phones generated $7 billion in annual revenue, and premier operators like Davel
Communications were busy buying up smaller competitors. Even after it was clear that
mobile phones posed a major threat to the industry, management insisted that pay phones
were as important as ever. But all of Davel's major rivals went out of business, and Davel
itself saw its stock price decline from ~$30 in early 1998 to ~$0 by 2000. Even if the ATM
sector somehow avoids its fate, CATM is still overvalued; if it doesn't, investors will look
back with wonder at the price they were willing to pay for a firm like this.


III. Same-Store Transaction Growth Has Slowed Sharply and Surprised Management


Tucked away in its 10-Qs and 10-Ks - though not discussed in its earnings releases -
CATM discloses same-store year-over-year growth in transaction volumes at its domestic
ATMs. For CATM, same-store transaction growth is the highest-margin source of
incremental volume because, unlike installing new ATMs or buying competitors, it doesn't
require additional capital.


Unfortunately for CATM, same-store transaction growth has fallen sharply in recent
quarters, apparently taking management by surprise. Though the data points may not be
perfectly commensurable over time since CATM has altered its definition of "same store,"
the trend is clear: growth has slowed.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 10/47


In early 2012, CATM enjoyed very strong year-over-year same-store growth as a result of
unusually warm weather along with cash withdrawals funded by tax refunds loaded onto
H&R Block prepaid cards. (H&R Block had not used CATM's surcharge-free Allpoint
network in the prior year.) Furthermore, the leap day lengthened the first quarter. All of this
set up a difficult comparison for CATM in 1Q13, and, sure enough, same-store growth was
negative. Initially, in its 10-Q commentary, management attributed the decline in growth to
these temporary factors and stated confidently that "[i]n the second quarter and
throughout the remainder of 2013, we expect that [sic] our domestic same-store
transaction growth to resume to a more normal range of 3-5%" (emphasis added).


Note: missing quarterly values (2011 Q4, 2012 Q2, 2012 Q4, 2013 Q4) are interpolated
based on stated year-to-date figures.


Source: CATM 2010 Q1 - 2014 Q1 10-Qs, 2010-13 10-Ks, Kerrisdale analysis


Over the next three quarters, however, growth never reached even the low end of this
"more normal range," and for the year it averaged just 1.1%, by far the lowest full-year
result since CATM began disclosing the metric in 2010. In its second-quarter 10-Q
commentary, management quietly dropped any reference to a "more normal range,"
saying instead (emphasis added):


We expect that [sic] our domestic same-store transaction growth rate to remain
relatively consistent with our second quarter rate throughout the remainder of
2013.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 11/47


But this forecast too was wrong. Growth in the second quarter was 2.7%, but in the third
quarter and the second half it averaged just 1.7%. By the third quarter, management had
again silently moved the goalposts, projecting (accurately this time) that growth would
"remain relatively consistent with our third quarter rate during the fourth quarter of 2013"
without acknowledging that growth had repeatedly underperformed prior expectations.
Finally, in the 2013 10-K, management replaced its original talk of a "normal range of 3-
5%" growth - set forth just a few months earlier - with something vaguer and less
ambitious:


We expect to continue to see a moderate rate of increase in the number of cash
withdrawal transactions being conducted on our domestic ATMs.


Not only did management fail to acknowledge these serial disappointments but it also
provided no clear explanation for them. In all of the Qs and the 10-K, the company
blames, in part, "decreased consumer spending," but it's difficult to understand what this
could mean. In the aggregate, US consumer spending has increased, not decreased: real
personal consumption expenditures grew 2.0% in 2013. This excuse doesn't hold up to
scrutiny.


In the recently reported first quarter of 2014, same-store transaction growth slowed even
further to just 0.4%, which CATM blamed on "adverse weather conditions"
(notwithstanding what should have been an easy comp) and characterized as "still slightly
below where we believe the rate will be for the remainder of 2014." Gone is any reference
to lower consumer spending, but, whatever the rationalization, the trend remains weak.


Overall, CATM's surprise declines in same-store transaction growth, coupled with its
weakening organic unit growth and falling per-ATM gross profits, paint a picture of
deteriorating core fundamentals. Management has attempted to mask this deterioration by
engaging in an acquisition spree, eating up all of its free cash flow in the process, yet this
has in turn led to lower returns on capital. With these sorts of underlying trends, CATM
does not deserve its optimistic premium valuation.


IV. The ATM Sector is in Secular Decline


Given investor enthusiasm for the mega-trend of growth in non-cash payment methods -
as expressed in the valuation of companies like Square, Visa, and MasterCard - as well as
the ever rising importance of online commerce, it's surprising that analysts have
expressed so little skepticism about CATM's long-term prospects. After all, CATM's entire
raison d'être is supplying paper currency at brick-and-mortar merchant locations. But

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 12/47


management has successfully convinced investors that, in the words of a company white
paper, "its naysayers notwithstanding, cash remains as relevant today as it was half a
century ago." On its 1Q14 earnings call, CATM's CEO declared that "the prognosis for
cash is that it remains a dominant and very healthy player in the payment infrastructure for
many years to come."


This sunny outlook is wholly inconsistent with the facts, which depict an industry in the
early stages of a massive secular decline. Defiant, "common sense" claims about the
perennial appeal of paper currency remind us of another sector: independent pay-phone
operators. Like ATM operators, these companies aimed to install their devices in a wide
range of high-traffic retail locations, and some engaged in large-scale M&A to consolidate
the market. In 1996, US payphone calls generated $7 billion in annual revenue. By the
late '90s, doubts had cropped up about the long-term viability of the sector in a world of
mobile phones, but many experts dismissed such talk as scare-mongering (emphasis
added):


…the increasing use of cellular phone has prompted speculation over whether pay
phones will become obsolete. Robert D. Hill, chief executive of Davel [the leading
independent operator], pours water over that suggestion, noting that the growth of
pagers has actually spurred pay-phone use. (MarketWatch, 10/7/1997)


"There will always be the need for pay phones," said Fred Volt, an analyst with
the Yankee Group consulting firm. "If you don't believe me, go to an airport or a mall
and see how many people are on them." (Dow Jones, 11/2/1999)


Volt was right: pay phones haven't gone away, and many people still rely on them. But that
didn't stop the number of phones in the country from declining by 74% from its 1999 peak
to 2009, and it didn't stop Davel's stock price from going to zero:

Operators in the ATM industry are equally as optimistic, and the secular trends are
similarly foreboding.


US ATM Transactions Are Falling, and Operators Fear Worse to Come


According to the recently released 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study, US ATM
withdrawal transactions decreased at a 1.1% CAGR over the three-year period from 2009
to 2012. (Although withdrawal volume in dollars increased at a modest 1.2% pace - far
below the 4% growth rate of nominal GDP and nominal personal consumption
expenditures - what matters most for CATM is the number of transactions: surcharge and
interchange fees are primarily based on counts and not values.) Over the same period,
the U.S. population grew 0.8%, implying a 2%-per-year decline in per capita withdrawals.
Meanwhile, noncash payments, consisting of primarily credit- and debit-card transactions
that are the primary alternatives to cash increased at an almost 8% CAGR.

Notably, while withdrawals were already in decline on a per-capita basis from 2003 to
2009, the drop has accelerated over the past several years to the point where aggregate
withdrawal counts have now begun to decline. The ongoing weakness in CATM's same-
store transaction volumes indicates that, even with its high-traffic retailer relationships, it is
not immune from this broad industry trend.


To be sure, CATM's competitors are well-attuned to this ominously accelerating decline. In
a 2013 study conducted by the Government Accountability Office, the ATM operators
surveyed said that, over the past five years, ATM revenues have decreased, while costs
have risen. "The most frequently cited reason the operators gave for the decreased
revenues was declining transaction volumes," including both surcharged and non-
surcharged transactions (emphasis added). "Similarly," the study goes on, "of the ten
financial operators that addressed future revenue trends in our survey, seven indicated
they anticipate a decline, due primarily to fewer transactions" (emphasis added).


Similar sentiments are expressed in the 2014 U.S. Independent ATM Deployer Survey
sponsored by the industry association ATMIA and the consultancy Kahuna ATM Solutions.
When 92 deployers were asked the question, "What are your biggest non-
legislative/compliance/network fears, worries and concerns regarding the health of the
ATM industry?" the two most popular responses, and the two most likely to rank as the
number-one concern, were "Declining Transactions" and "ATM Saturation." ("Keeping
up with Changing Technology" was number three, further underscoring the ongoing
upward pressure on capex.) Concerns about declining volumes actually got worse since
the prior year's survey:

These smaller operators are confirming that what the Fed data says is correct:
transactions are falling at an accelerating rate. While CATM contends that cash is just as
relevant today as it was fifty years ago, consumer behavior is pointing in the opposite
direction, which will subject organic growth to severe and continuing pressure.


The Declining Relevance of Cash and ATMs Is a Global Phenomenon

Some CATM boosters might argue that the company's international expansion
opportunities will overshadow weakness in the domestic market. With the US contributing
87% of "adjusted" EBIT in 1Q14, however, it's clear that local trends will loom large.
Moreover, ATMs are becoming less important all across the world, not just in the US:


United Kingdom: According to the UK ATM network LINK, the total number of cash
withdrawals grew at a 0.2% CAGR over the past five years and declined by 0.5% in
2013.


Canada: According to the Canadian Bankers Association, the number of cash
withdrawals has declined every year since at least 2005, shrinking at a 3% CAGR.


Eurozone: According to the European Central Bank, while ATM cash withdrawals grew
almost 2% per year from 2008 to 2010, they have since declined at 0.4% per year
through 2012.


Sweden: With its efficient and technologically advanced retail payment system,
Sweden is among the most "cashless" nations in the world. A 2013 study by the
Swedish central bank notes that this shift has been relatively rapid. After rising every
year from 1950 to 2007, total cash in circulation has fallen every year since.
Meanwhile, "[t]he number of ATM withdrawals and the total value of withdrawals rose
until the start of the 2000s, but has declined over the past ten years. … The total value
of withdrawals fell by almost 30 percent between 2004 and 2011." Nor is this decline
slowing: the president of Bankomat AB, Sweden's leading ATM operator, said in
September 2013 that "the number of withdrawals at ATMs decreases by 6-8 percent
every year."


Japan: For Seven Bank, daily average transactions per ATM in its Japanese
operations were down 2% year-over-year for the nine months ended 12/31/13, the
latest in a string of weak numbers. Indeed, one motivation for the company's US
expansion may be the onset of weak same-store trends in its home market.


Australia: According to the Australian Payments Clearing Association, ATM
withdrawals declined by 5% in 2013 alone and were down 7% from their 2008 peak.
Meanwhile, credit- and debit-card transactions continue to grow steadily.


Even in emerging markets where data is scarcer and banking systems less developed,
cash is coming under fire from both the public and private sectors. For example, the
Better than Cash Alliance - funded by the Gates Foundation, the U.S. Agency for
International Development, Citigroup, Visa, and MasterCard, among others - is

pushing to accelerate the shift from paper and coins toward digital payments, arguing
that it will increase efficiency, transparency, and security.


Given this weak global backdrop, it's easy to sympathize with the owners of foreign ATM
operators who have sold their businesses to CATM in recent years: they get to cash out
before the secular woes facing the sector become too obvious. CATM, on the other hand,
has levered up to fund these purchases, effectively doubling down on a shrinking market.
The stark contrast between the story told by the data and the one set forth by CATM
management casts doubt on investors' rosy long-term outlook and the company's
premium valuation.


V. CATM's Roll-Up Strategy Has Consumed All of Its Cash Flow and Generated
Falling Returns


CATM has long been a serial acquirer: from 2001 to 2008, for example, it completed 16
acquisitions and increased the size of its ATM portfolio from 3,339 units to 33,755. For
almost three years, though, coinciding with the financial crisis, CATM halted its M&A and
focused on optimizing its existing business. But starting in 2011, it resumed its acquisition
spree, gobbling up another 13 firms. Since 2011, CATM has spent more than 100% of its
free cash flow on acquisitions and took on high-cost convertible and subordinated
leverage to fund the remainder.


In fact, analyzing as far as public data permits, CATM has almost never generated more
cash flow from operations than it has spent on capex and acquisitions. 2009 and 2010
(and, to a far lesser extent, 2012) were the exceptions; in every other year, CATM has
posted negative FCF net of acquisitions and has thus required an influx of external capital.

Source: CATM 2006-13 10-Ks, S-1 filed 3/10/04, Kerrisdale analysis


In principle, there is nothing inherently wrong with a business that, for a time, spends more
on acquisitions than it generates in free cash flow. Examining CATM's results, though, it's
clear that the resumption of M&A has led to steadily declining returns on capital, as shown
in the table below. CATM's return on assets, for example, has fallen from 9% in 2010 to
just 2% in 2013. While the low level in 2013 was partially driven by the impact of a tax-
related restructuring in the company's UK operations, ROA fell dramatically even when
adjusting for this item, from 9% to 4%. Looking at EBIT relative to average assets - a
measure of return on invested capital that abstracts from the business's changing mix of
debt and equity - confirms the sizable decline in profitability.

While CATM management and sell-side analysts prefer to focus on "adjusted" earnings
measures that exclude expenses like intangible-asset amortization, these metrics treat
acquisitions as if they are free and thus fail to address the crucial question of how much
earnings power the company has been able to generate per dollar invested, whether in
organic opportunities or in M&A. To get at this issue, we compute gross assets by adding
back accumulated depreciation, amortization, and goodwill impairment, thereby estimating
the total cumulative cash invested in the business. This permits an apples-to-apples
calculation using EBITDA, since depreciation and amortization are excluded consistently
from both numerator and denominator. But returns on capital computed in this fashion
follow a trend similar to that of the other measures, deteriorating year after year. Even if
we give CATM full credit for its "adjusted" EBITDA figure, the fact remains that the post-
2010 roll-up strategy has yielded diminishing marginal returns that are becoming ever-less
attractive on an absolute basis.


M&A Accounts for Almost 100% of Unit Growth, and Organic Growth Has Turned
Negative


To increase the size of its ATM fleet, CATM has two basic options:


Organic growth: sign up new merchant partners or install ATMs at new stores opened
up by existing partners
M&A: buy competing ATM operators


M&A is likely to be a less profitable source of growth: CATM must pay a control premium,
incur sizable acquisition-related expenses (over $15mm in 2013), and often compete with
other buyers. By contrast, putting an ATM in, say, a new Walgreens does cost money but
entails fewer frictions and should generate higher returns. Since 2011, we estimate that
93% of CATM's rapid increase in ATM units has come from acquisitions, not organic
growth:

We believe investors now face an especially precarious situation since organic ATM
growth turned slightly negative in 2013. While this was partially driven by the removal of
unprofitable machines in Mexico, organic growth was weak across the board, slowing
year-over-year in every geographic market:

Note: 2013 organic growth in Canada was -2 units.


Source: CATM 2013 Q4 earnings release, Kerrisdale analysis


CATM has clearly become more reliant on acquisitions to increase the size of its ATM
fleet. Yet this strategy has come at the price of weaker returns on capital. Management
may have judged that, given the gloomy outlook for organic growth, M&A is the only way
left to expand, but there is no reason for shareholders to reward this desperate strategy
with a premium valuation.


New and Acquired ATMs Are 41% Less Profitable than CATM's Legacy ATMs


Because CATM has acquired so many different companies over the last three years,
parsing its results is challenging. The company does provide operating metrics that
exclude the impact of recent acquisitions, but as time goes on, the chain breaks: investors
can observe the impact of 2013's acquisitions on 2013's results but not the impact of, say,
2011's acquisitions, which blend in with pre-existing assets. To assess the quality of
CATM's growth strategy, however, it is important to know how the profitability of its new
ATMs, added primarily via M&A, compares to the profitability of its "legacy" ATMs.


It's clear that overall unit profitability has declined significantly. In 2011, excluding the
impact of acquisitions, gross profit per ATM (excluding depreciation and amortization) was
$472 per month; by 2013 Q4, it had fallen 20% to $376 per month. Cash withdrawals per
ATM, a key driver of revenue and profits, had also declined by 5%. But if we make the
simplifying assumption that the legacy ATMs' operating metrics remained constant during
the period, thereby attributing all of the change to the added ATMs, the comparison is
even starker: new and acquired ATMs are on average 41% less profitable than CATM's
legacy ATMs.

Source: CATM 2011 Q4 and 2013 Q4 releases, Kerrisdale analysis


Of course, it's possible that the new and acquired ATMs are somewhat more profitable
than this analysis suggests, but since the aggregate numbers still have to tie out, that
would in turn imply that CATM's legacy ATMs are themselves becoming less profitable.
Either way, the implications for CATM's future earnings are ominous.


This result is not surprising given the realities of CATM's ATM footprint. CATM already has
relationships with many of the largest retailers in the US and UK and generates
incremental revenue from branding relationships with many of the largest banks. As a
result, it will be difficult to replicate the economics of its existing model since new units will
tend to be far less attractive than existing ones: rather than signing an account like Costco
or Target, it is stuck with marginal franchises like Tedeschi Food Shops (for which
competition from smaller ATM operators will also be fiercer). The figures above indicate
that this diminishing-returns effect has already begun to set in, and it should only get
worse as the company adds more and more low-profitability units.


VI. Aggressive Accounting Drives Overstated Earnings


Focus on "Adjusted" EPS Obscures Flatlining GAAP Earnings


Like many other highly acquisitive firms, CATM prefers to discuss "adjusted" earnings
rather than acknowledge recurring costs like intangible-asset amortization and acquisition-
related expenses. The discrepancy between GAAP and adjusted earnings has only gotten
wider over time: while adjusted earnings smoothly and steadily rise, actual GAAP earnings
oscillate around what is at best a flat trend. Though successive tax-related restructurings
in the UK are responsible for some of the volatility, the same pattern is clear even when
adjusting for these items.

Source: CATM 2012-13 10-Ks, Kerrisdale analysis


As GAAP and adjusted earnings have diverged - 2013 adjusted EPS of $1.93 was more
than double tax-adjusted GAAP EPS of $0.86, let alone actual reported GAAP EPS of
$0.52 - the sell side has been forced to zero on in the adjusted figures alone. Otherwise,
the valuation metrics would become too lofty to justify: on an adjusted basis, CATM trades
at a rich but plausible 16.6x trailing (2013) earnings, while on a GAAP basis (again
adjusting for the unusual tax charge) it trades at a staggering 37.4x. This is a shockingly
expensive price especially when considering that reported earnings, as documented
below, are themselves suspect.


We recognize that excluding amortization is a sensible practice if one is trying to
approximate current actual cash flow at the company. Free cash flow per share, for
instance, more closely approximates adjusted EPS than GAAP EPS. However, given that
we believe that ATMs are in secular decline, analysts ought to assign a low multiple to the
adjusted EPS or EBIT figures. If using GAAP EPS and EBIT, a higher valuation multiple
can be justified since amortization expense helps incorporate the real costs of a growth-
through-acquisition business model. What we disagree with is the practice of applying
market or above-market valuation multiples to adjusted EPS or EBIT figures that
conveniently exclude acquisition-related expenses such as amortization of intangible
assets.


Sadly for CATM shareholders, these "adjusted" numbers are not purely for external
consumption: according to the latest proxy statement, CATM's executive bonuses are
based primarily on growth in revenue, "adjusted" operating income, and "adjusted"

earnings per share. All of these measures can be increased simply by buying enough
companies, whether or not the underlying transactions are economically sound, since
management faces no penalty for tying up investor capital but gets to claim full credit for
all of the added revenues - as if they cost nothing. In effect, this compensation structure
incentivizes empire-building rather than true economic profitability.


CATM Is Depreciating Its Assets Too Slowly, Inflating Earnings by 50-70%


In some businesses, depreciation is more of an accounting entry than an economic reality,
and analysts rightly disregard it. But in the ATM industry, depreciation is quite real: moving
parts wear out, receipt printers jam, computing hardware becomes obsolete, and, on
occasion, thieves tie ATMs to their SUVs and try to yank them off their moorings.
Furthermore, while ATM technology may seem simple, a host of regulatory and
operational rule changes have compelled upgrades in recent years. As an industry journal
put it in a recent piece entitled "ATM Deployers Face 'Perfect Storm' of Obsolescence":


Independent ATM operators will soon have to upgrade, replace or abandon their
newly obsolete machines.


The nation's fleet of cash machines is becoming outmoded because of the upcoming
shift to EMV-chip cards, the decision to abandon a key Windows operating system,
and issues raised by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Payment Card
Industry data security standards.


But that "perfect storm" of adversity's nothing new for America's independent ATM
deployers.


…"If we go back to the last decade, we had Y2K, and then back to stasis. We had
triple DES [security] migration. Stasis. Then it was ADA upgrades. Stasis," [Rob]
Evans [director of industry marketing for an ATM manufacturer] says. "Now we're
looking at EMV and the double whammy of being able to support chip cards along
with, oh, by the way, if you are on a Windows XP platform, you might want to get off
of that because Microsoft is discontinuing the operating system."


But despite this long history of ATM obsolescence, CATM has adopted an unusually - and
increasingly - aggressive policy for depreciation accounting. While large peers, including
companies that CATM ultimately purchased, tend to depreciate their ATM equipment over
five years, CATM appears to assume useful lives that are 40-80% longer, leading to
overstated earnings. Meanwhile, actual capital expenditures have continually exceeded

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 24/47


both GAAP depreciation and the company's own initial guidance, and asset disposals
have consistently generated losses, further calling into question CATM's optimistic
accounting.


Strangely, CATM does not directly disclose the average useful life it assumes for its ATM
equipment. Instead, its latest 10-K provides a very wide range for property and equipment
as a whole (emphasis added):


Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.


Going back further in time, CATM previously didn't extend its depreciation as far out as ten
years. Originally, the range was much narrower (emphasis added):


2006: "three to seven years"
2007: "three to seven years"
2008: "three to seven years"
2009: "three to seven years"
2010: "three to eight years"
2011: "three to eight years"
2012: "three to ten years"
2013: "three to ten years"


This quiet yet substantial protraction of the depreciation schedule is readily visible in the
financial statements themselves. By comparing the gross carrying value of CATM's
property and equipment - i.e. the balance before accumulated depreciation - to the level of
annual depreciation expense, we can estimate the effective average life of these assets.
This calculation, admittedly somewhat imprecise, indicates that the change in 10-K
language documented above reflects a real shift: the assumed average life has increased
from ~7 years in 2010 to ~9 years based on 2014 guidance. Since "ATM equipment and
related costs" constitute 85% of CATM's property and equipment, CATM is implicitly
claiming that, despite the incoming wave of technological change, its machines will last
almost a decade.

The lack of a comparable publicly traded ATM operator in the US makes it difficult for
investors to realize just how aggressive CATM's accounting is. Below we compile the
available information on how a range of domestic and international competitors have
accounted for depreciation. Large players - including those that CATM has acquired -
uniformly assume a useful life of only five years for their ATMs, far shorter than what
CATM assumes. While a few smaller companies also had aggressive policies, the ATM-
weighted average assumed useful life is still just over five years:

Axcess 2012 10-K, CATM 8-K filed 10/3/11 (NYSEARCA:EDC)


What would CATM's earnings look like if it adopted a more realistic depreciation policy, in
line with its peers? Even though depreciation is not one of CATM's largest expenses, the
impact would still be enormous. We estimate that a five-year useful life for property and
equipment, consistent with the expectations of other ATM operators, would have reduced
2013 "adjusted" EPS by 34%, while 2014 "adjusted" EPS, based on CATM's guidance,
would drop by 42%. Looking at GAAP EPS instead of CATM's "adjusted" concept,
earnings would fall even more dramatically (even when adding back a tax-related charge
that skewed GAAP EPS last year): 75% in 2013 and 80% in 2014. Equivalently, EPS is
overstated by ~50-70%.

CATM's anomalous under-depreciation is not just a matter of accounting. Since ATM
depreciation is very economically meaningful, understating it makes the long-term
profitability of the business look much better than it really is. The rosy asset-life
expectations embedded in CATM's results are belied by the pessimism of the many large-
scale ATM operators surveyed in a recent study by the US Government Accountability
Office (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 27/47


…our survey results showed that 18 out of 25 financial institution operators
anticipate ATM costs will increase in the future. The main drivers cited for these
future increases are further investments in new and enhanced ATM terminals or
upgrades that will be needed in order to comply with new or enhanced industry wide
data security standards. The community bankers and one independent firm we
interviewed expressed similar views that ATM costs will continue to rise.


With these increased equipment costs lying ahead, CATM's accounting stands out as
especially aggressive. Because its assumptions are such outliers, just moving toward peer
levels would push reported earnings down dramatically.


CATM Has Consistently Underestimated Its Capital-Expenditure Requirements


Of course, it's always possible that CATM's ATM fleet really will defy the odds and outlast
its competitors'; management should naturally have a more accurate view of asset lives
than outside observers. However, CATM's track record for forecasting its capital
expenditures is weak, and the error is always in one direction, as shown in the graph
below: capex turns out to be higher than originally estimated. But reported depreciation
never rises enough to catch up.


Note: 2014 depreciation based on CATM guidance. Guidance based on mid-point of
stated range.

earnings releases, Kerrisdale analysis


In the first quarter of this year, the pattern has already appeared again: management's
original capex guidance was $95.0 to $100.0 million but is now $100.0 to $110.0 million,
attributed in part to "timing of contract renewals that may involve a hardware refresh." In
other words, merchant partners want CATM to replace outdated machines with more
advanced models on CATM's dime, implying more spending than originally projected.


This history of underestimated capex implies that CATM management has failed to
anticipate the cash costs of maintaining its ATM fleet, casting doubt on the validity of its
depreciation assumptions.


Routine Losses on Disposal Confirm Overmarked Assets


Another signal of CATM's under-depreciation is its history of asset disposals. From time to
time, when CATM prunes its portfolio of ATMs or ends its relationship with a merchant, it
gets rid of the used devices. If it were, on average, depreciating the devices accurately,
then gains and losses should roughly offset. But in reality, CATM has posted losses on
disposal every year, totaling $14mm from 2009 to 2013.


Source: CATM 2011-13 10-Ks


These losses again suggest that CATM is overestimating the value of its physical assets
by adopting an aggressive depreciation policy that substantially inflates its reported
earnings.


VII. CATM's Largest Customer and a Third of Its Profits Face a Severe Competitive
Threat


In addition to the chronic difficulties that CATM will endure from its weakening core
business model, dependence on M&A, and secular decline, it also faces a significant risk
over the next few years: the potential loss of its largest customer (7-Eleven) to an affiliated
firm called Seven Bank. Though the 7-Eleven brand was created in the US, the company
is now owned by a publicly traded Japanese firm called Seven & i Holdings Co., which in
turn owns 45.8% of Seven Bank, itself a publicly traded Japanese firm. Though technically

5/23/2018 Cardtronics: Aggressive Accounting And Secular Decline Drive 40-70% Downside - Cardtronics plc (NASDAQ:CATM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 29/47


a deposit-taking bank, Seven is primarily an ATM operator, with over 90% of its revenue
coming from ATM-related fees and, as of 12/31/13, 93% of its 19,065 Japanese ATMs
located in Seven & i group stores.


Established in 2001, Seven Bank was originally confined to Japan, but in September 2012
it entered the US market by buying a small operator called FCTI, characterizing the
acquisition as "an important first step for Seven Bank in effecting a full-scale entry into
ATM service markets overseas." Then, in August 2013, FCTI purchased out of bankruptcy
the ATM business of Global Axcess. (According to its court filings, Global Axcess's
bankruptcy came about precisely because "the contracts with [its] two largest merchants
were set to expire." The company was "able to renew the contracts but on term much less
favorable" than before. Then, it lost its third largest merchant to a competitor.) Today, via
FCTI, Seven Bank owns over 7,000 ATMs in the US.


Given the close relationship between 7-Eleven's Japanese parent and Seven Bank - even
the companies' logos are almost identical - the obvious question is whether Seven Bank
will seek to take over 7-Eleven's US ATMs from CATM, which has operated them since
2007. Since the contract expires on June 1, 2017 - only three years from now - and
accounted for 24% of pro forma (M&A-adjusted) 2013 revenue (source: CATM 2013 10-K)
this is, for CATM, a matter of increasingly pressing importance.


Seven Bank's management has not been particularly shy about its long-term intentions. In
November 2012, it said the following in a Q&A document attached to an earnings release
(emphasis added):


Q1 What possibility is there of Seven Bank installing ATMs in 7-Eleven stores in the
United States?


A1 A leading ATM operator in the United States has been installing ATMs in U.S. 7-
Eleven stores. Seven Bank will work hard to ensure that 7-Eleven and its
customers choose FCTI ATMs when this leading company negotiates a
contract extension with 7-Eleven. At the moment, that is all I can say about this
matter. As of today, no decision has been made.


In November 2013, it reiterated its interest in the US 7-Eleven opportunity:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 30/47


Q3 I believe that ATMs have already been installed at 7-Eleven stores in North
America, so how are you planning to differentiate Seven Bank ATM services from
your rivals'? Also, what expectations do consumers and owners of 7-Eleven stores in
America have of Seven Bank ATMs?


A3 What 7-Eleven stores in the United States want to see is a contribution in terms
of, for example, services which increase the number of customers coming into the
stores, and they also want a better revenue environment. We believe that the key to
differentiation lies in responding rigorously to such demands. We think it is also
necessary to prioritize two-way communication, so as to fully understand what the
other side wants. …


Seven Bank's latest annual report also emphasizes the importance of US expansion to its
strategic ambitions "over the next 10 years" (emphasis added):


First, we will study the operating methods of FCTI as our second business model,
and then we intend to roll out a wide-ranging scheme for further expansion.


Threatening as this sort of rhetoric may seem, sell-side analysts have downplayed the
importance of the Seven Bank threat, arguing that, with its much larger existing US ATM
network, CATM is in a strong position to outbid Seven in 2017 or even enter into an early
renewal. One analyst has argued that CATM has already put pressure on Seven's
economics:


CATM will not make Seven Bank's US expansion painless. We note that Seven
Bank has paid a mid-teens EBITDA multiple for both recent US ATM fleet
acquisitions (FCTI in September, 2012 and Global Axcess in September, 2013),
which is effectively double market rates. Our independent checks indicate that CATM
may have had a hand in bidding up the prices of these assets.


While this approach may enable CATM to beat back smaller players, we would argue that,
for an acquisition-driven company, causing transaction multiples to double is a dangerous
long-term strategy. To be sure, CATM may well win the 7-Eleven contract and extend the
relationship for another few years. Then again, given Seven Bank's avowed long-term
intentions and intimate relationship with 7-Eleven's parent, it's difficult to see how the state
of affairs won't impact Cardtronic's long-term profitability. If nothing else, Seven Bank's
presence in the US gives 7-Eleven a huge club to wield in future negotiations to tamp
down CATM's margins.

Though de-installing CATM's machines and replacing them with another provider's would
be disruptive to 7-Eleven, there is certainly precedent: after a long-running legal dispute
with CATM over proper revenue-sharing, Duane Reade (CATM's fifth-largest customer in
2008) terminated its contract with CATM, extracted a $1 million settlement from the
company, and spent five months replacing CATM's equipment with Chase's. Moreover, 7-
Eleven is not CATM's only concentration risk: CATM's other top-five merchants account for
another 17% of its pro forma revenue and also, on average, expire in three years. This
recurring risk of customer loss and less lucrative contract renewals only exacerbates the
fundamental problems with CATM's model.


7-Eleven ATMs Are Disproportionately Profitable, Compounding the Long-Term
Threat


CATM discloses that 7-Eleven accounts for 24% of its pro forma revenues but does not
estimate its contribution to profits. Based on the available data, we estimate that the 7-
Eleven fleet is likely to be much more profitable than CATM's typical ATMs, putting CATM
at risk of losing not just a quarter of its revenue but a third or more of its earnings.
According to 7-Eleven's store locator, there are 8,176 domestic stores with ATMs. This
represents just 12% of CATM's 1Q14 ATM count (excluding managed services) yet
generates approximately twice as much of CATM's total revenue, implying that 7-Eleven
ATMs produce about two times as much revenue as CATM's average.


Source: CATM 2013 10-K, 7-Eleven store locator, Kerrisdale analysis


While we lack the information to assess precisely the profit margin achieved on this far
higher revenue per ATM, we use management's own comments to estimate it. CATM has
indicated that "the majority of merchant commissions, vault cash rental expense, and
other costs of cash," constituting 69% of the total cost of ATM operating revenues, vary
with transaction volume. These line items constitute 46% of ATM operating revenues
(excluding managed services). If we apply this ratio to the revenues generated from 7-
Eleven and assume that the remainder of the costs are fixed, we estimate that 7-Eleven
constitutes 41% of CATM's adjusted EBITDA.

With such an enormous fraction of CATM's earnings power tied to a single relationship
that is so demonstrably at risk, it's foolhardy to pay a premium multiple on profits that
could decline by almost half in just a few years. This is even more true in light of the fact
that CATM's reported earnings appear to be artificially inflated by aggressive accounting.


VIII. Stretched Valuation Points to >50% Downside


Comparable-Company Multiples Are 30-40% Lower than CATM's


One factor that has enabled CATM to sustain a high valuation despite the host of
concerns identified above is the absence of close comparables in the US. However, there
is a similar publicly traded firm listed in Canada: DirectCash (TSX:DCI), which operates
more than 20,000 ATMs in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the UK.
Moreover, a number of US-listed firms, while not in precisely the same industry, face
similar business risks: outsized exposure to paper-based payment media, which they
often aim to overcome via deal-making. This group includes Brink's Company
(NYSE:BCO), an armored-car operator and ATM-maintenance provider; NCR
(NYSE:NCR), the leading ATM manufacturer; and Deluxe Corporation (NYSE:DLX), the
top supplier of paper checks.

To normalize for differing capital structures and business models, we focus on EV relative
to EBITA - i.e. EBIT plus intangible-asset amortization or, equivalently, EBITDA less
depreciation. As intuition would suggest, these stocks trade at relatively modest EV/EBITA
multiples, reflecting market concerns about their long-term prospects, notwithstanding
current rates of growth. CATM is a clear outlier, with an EV/EBITA multiple 44% higher
than its peer average and 64% higher than that of its closest comparable, DirectCash.
Applying these multiples to CATM would imply ~40% downside relative to the current
stock price. Note that these figures don't penalize CATM for its aggressively protracted
depreciation schedule. Nor do they account for the risk that the 7-Eleven relationship will
be lost.

2013 10-K, DLX 2013 10-K, NCR 2013 10-K, Kerrisdale analysis


This comparison shows that once investors begin to question long-term growth, multiples
can compress dramatically even before metrics like revenue start to decline visibly. Given
the underlying trends in CATM's business, including weak organic growth and declining
returns on capital, there is no reason for the company to trade at such a massive premium
to similarly challenged peers.


Adjusted for Normalized Depreciation, GAAP Earnings Power Indicates Sharply
Lower Price


Even if we give CATM credit for the non-cash (albeit recurring) nature of its amortization
expense, the company's guidance for 2014 earnings does not support its current lofty
stock price, especially when considering its understated depreciation expense. At the mid-

Below we show the values per share that result from applying a range of P/E multiples to
this level of EPS, adjusted to true up depreciation based on a range of assumed average

For useful lives of 5-7 years and P/E multiples of 10x-16x - below or in line with the market
average, as befits its weak secular outlook - CATM's fair value per share would be $8-$22,
32-76% below the current stock price. This simple analysis serves to reinforce the
conclusion that CATM is highly overvalued.


DCF Analysis with Modestly Declining Transaction Volumes Implies ~70%
Downside


Though comparison with related firms sheds some light on CATM's irrational
overvaluation, a full DCF analysis throws into relief just how much current shareholders
are implicitly relying on unachievable same-store transaction growth and stupendous

amounts of value-creating M&A to justify the current stock price. To illustrate the
importance of even an extremely modest but ongoing decline in per-ATM transaction
volume, we construct a DCF analysis with the following simple core assumptions:


Starting in 2015, withdrawals per ATM start declining by 1% per year.
Variable expenses, in line recent experience, constitute 46% of ATM operating revenue
(excluding managed services).
Economic depreciation is based on an average asset life of 5.5 years.
Organic ATM unit growth is 3% per year.
The tax rate is CATM's stated "long-term, cross-jurisdictional effective cash tax rate of
32%."


With these downright mild assumptions, CATM's equity value is massively lower than its
current stock price - by a stunning 72%:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2238023-cardtronics-aggressive-accounting-and-secular-decline-drive-40minus-70-percent-downside 37/47


This illustration reveals just how levered CATM's value is to transaction growth, along with
blue-sky dreams of endless large accretive acquisitions at bargain prices. In a world
where the US's payment system comes anywhere near the level of sophistication of
Sweden's, CATM investors cannot justify anything close to the current stock price. The
nearer-term risks surrounding the 7-Eleven contract only multiply the magnitude of the
overvaluation.


Future M&A Is Unlikely to Create Material Value


Some CATM boosters point to future acquisition opportunities as a source of upside,
apparently unperturbed by the trend of declining profitability that has coincided with the
company's latest round of deals. Based on our DCF analysis, however, CATM has been
paying more for ATMs via M&A than the long-term fundamentals would justify. For
example, in CATM's last major purchase, Cardpoint, it paid $153 million for a business
with 7,900 ATMs, or $19,367 per ATM. This valuation is roughly consistent with the
median of the transactions analyzed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in its "independent
expert's report" on DirectCash's acquisition of an Australian firm called Customer Limited.
PwC found that in past transactions the median enterprise value paid per ATM (a metric it
characterized as "an industry rule of thumb") was $20,900.


Yet if we adjust our DCF to set organic growth in ATM units to 0%, we find that the fair
value EV per ATM given CATM's business model is just ~$12,500, 35% lower than what
CATM paid for Cardpoint and 40% lower than the median price in past transactions. In
other words, the more acquisitions CATM does at these sorts of prices, the more value it
destroys, because it is paying more than the operations are worth. The long-term decline
in transaction volumes and the need to frequently replace and upgrade obsolete units
make M&A a drastically worse option economically than organic growth in units. Yet
organic growth is precisely where CATM has faltered over the past several years.


Even if we ignore the prospect of secularly declining ATM transactions and take for
granted CATM's inflated stock price, CATM is just not buying earnings cheaply enough to
generate a huge increase in economic value. As shown below, it purchased Cardpoint at
an EV/EBITA multiple of 8.5x. Even if it could draw down the rest of its $375mm revolving
credit facility to purchase additional businesses at this same multiple, and even if the
market (wrongly) valued the resulting incremental earnings at CATM's higher EV/EBITA
multiple of 13.4x, then it would only add about $4 per share to CATM's equity value.

We view this analysis as extremely generous. From a long-term perspective, these
acquired earnings streams are likely to shrink, not grow, which will impair both their
standalone fair value and the valuation that investors ultimately ascribe to CATM. What
matters fundamentally is not this sort of financial engineering - buying in the private
market for a low multiple and hoping to be valued in the public market at a high multiple -
but whether the businesses acquired are actually worth more than the purchase price. If
we adopt this more rational perspective, then CATM's M&A is likely value-destructive;
even if we don't, the total "value"-creation potential given CATM's existing financial
resources is still modest.


IX. Conclusion


CATM is a pure-play operator in a sector that faces decades of decline. By engaging in
serial acquisitions over the past three years, it has masked the deterioration of its

Through anomalously aggressive assumptions about the useful lives of its assets, it has
inflated its reported earnings by as much as 50-70%, while distracting analysts from the
true costs of an M&A driven growth strategy by honing in on "adjusted" non-GAAP
earnings. With domestic same-store transaction growth barely positive and industry data

pointing toward declining volumes across the planet, CATM would need to create
incredible value via M&A in order to come close to rationalizing the current stock price.
However, CATM is acquiring other ATM operators at healthy multiples from sellers that are
only too happy to unload businesses that are increasingly being made obsolete by
increased credit card usage, online payment systems and multiple other secular trends.
On these grounds, CATM has 40-70% downside without even considering the looming risk
that it will lose its largest merchant relationship, contributing more than 40% of current
earnings. Investors who believe that cash is as important now as it was 50 years ago are
welcome to hang on, but those with a more realistic outlook should get out before it's too
late.

Would you be concerned at all that the company could try to prop up the stock with a dividend that was, in reality,
overpaid, but would not appear so for a year or two? Simply by stopping the reinvestment and running the
depreciation game to the nth degree?

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Of course that is possible, but it would be tantamount to an admission that organic and
inorganic growth opportunities were no longer attractive, which would mark a sea change in how CATM
presents itself and how investors view it. A company in that situation typically trades for a far lower valuation -
- as we document in our report, firms like NCR and DLX are at substantial discounts to CATM, despite
reasonably good track records of paying out and deploying excess cash generated by core businesses that
face the risk of secular decline.

Excellent research and hypothesis!


Wrote a bear call spread ($30/$40) Dec14 to finance 3.3x puts at $25.


I only wish they had Jan16 options, so I could lever up deeper. Time is unfortunately a big factor here.


Best of luck, I think this is a SOLID short!


27 May 2014, 11:15 AM


The Sociology of Finance, Contributor
Excellent analysis, very informative. Out of curiosity, I took a quick glance at the balance sheet and it looks pretty
fragile: stockholders equity of $250M, but goodwill of $410M and other intangibles of $150M, probably mostly from the
rollup strategy. On top of that, $270M of equipment that is probably overvalued (if the thesis presented here is
correct). The company seems to have minimal slack if it runs into trouble.


So what I'm wondering is whether the convertible or sub debt is an even better short than the equity, because the
revolving credit line seems likely to eat up everything in the event of bankruptcy. I don't have access to fancy financial
info, so I don't even know if this is workable. KCM, thoughts?


27 May 2014, 11:44 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We agree that CATM's balance sheet is bloated, though, to be fair, debt relative to current
earnings is not especially high, and in our illustrative analysis of a slow-decline scenario, the debt outstanding
would still be covered, though the equity value would be greatly impaired. In a less favorable but still plausible
outcome (like a 6-8% perpetual decline), all bets are off, but we are not calling for that to happen in the near
term.

Yeah, that point of the analysis was maybe a bit stretched, but the point is that the earnings are expanded
AND the valuations are still extreme.

I don't think even a 10y straight line on ATMs would be inappropriate judging by the junk 7-11 has, but his
points are that the comps earnings are higher quality AND lower P/E trades.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  From 2011 to 2013, CATM's capex ("additions to property and equipment") totaled
$225.6mm. Meanwhile, depreciation expense totaled $170.3mm. So capex was 32% higher. You may be
looking at capex relative to depreciation *plus amortization*.


27 May 2014, 01:02 PM


Weighing Machine, Contributor
You are right. I was looking at D&A not just D. So if I adjusted EPS based on the average amount of under-
depreciation ($17 mn pa) and tax adjusted it, it would reduce EPS by $0.22 per share.

Nice analysis. Your assessment regarding the 7-Eleven contract looks correct. The terms are from 2007 and
regardless of whether or not they keep the contract, profitability will be substantially impaired as market terms today
are substantially below where they were at that time. They know this and have been trying to diversify through M&A
activity. It is clear that Seven Bank is looking to gain experience in the US in order to absorb the 7-Eleven portfolio in
2-3 years. The thing is they have had to go and upgrade all of the ATMs for ADA and there are no more opportunities
to put 6,000 ATMs to work.

Interesting analysis. Thank you for such detailed work. I'm curious if you looked at the stock on an EV/EBITDA
(instead of EV/EBITA) basis, and, if not, why not? While having a shorter depreciation life would hurt earnings,
wouldn't it be cash flow neutral? I agree the earning adjustments are noisy at best, so I have been more focused on
cash flow. I saw your DCF work, but, personally, I have a hard time with DCF assumptions of discount rates and
terminal growth rates. At 7.5X EBITDA, it's trading a point below its five-year average and just a half point below
Directcash (which has only a $271 million market cap). I agree it's certainly not a low risk stock, but it doesn't appear

expensive on more traditional cash flow metrics. You guys sure lit it up today! Again, nice analysis. Thank you for
taking the time and good luck on your call!


27 May 2014, 02:27 PM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We prefer using EBITA for comparison across business models (e.g. CATM relative to NCR,
Deluxe, etc.) because depreciation is a very important cost for an asset owner like CATM but far less so for
others facing analogous secular pressures. As a result, EV/EBITDA will always tend to paint an overly rosy
picture of a company like CATM on a relative basis. Ultimately, as you point out, it does come down to cash
flow. If CATM's actual replacement capex over time is more in line with the long average life it uses for
depreciation purposes, then the fact that its accounting is an outlier won't matter much, although it still tends
to raise one's eyebrows. But given all the challenges surrounding ATM upgrades today, and given the
company's track record of underestimating its own capex, we think that capex will continue to come in high
despite modest organic growth in ATM counts.


We're open to feedback on our DCF analysis and are acutely aware of the hazards of making long-term
forecasts, which is why we don't rely on the DCF as the only element in our valuation case. Still, we think it's
very important for investors to think carefully about the financial consequences of secular decline ahead of
time, because they can be counterintuitively large and can emerge very suddenly. That's why we like the
payphone analogy -- plenty of smart people knew that mobile phones were a threat to that industry but,
because the impact took a while to set in, they underestimated just how damaging they would be.

Lots of interesting statistics in this article, and along with it lots of speculation. Some of the points made might well be
true, and some I disagree with. But the point of this post is to make anyone who is thinking of going short along with
the author to think twice. Here's why:


1. TheStreetsweeper, which was short over 40K shares of QCOR in 2012, ran a 2 part 'investigative report' attacking
the company and its products. The report had the effect of cutting the stock price about in half, from about 40 to 20,
which is obviously what they wanted. Today? It closed at around 90. 
2. Bill Ackman also had slides and a report as part of his attack on HLF. That stock also crashed when he went on the
offensive, but it didn't last, and the heavily short Ackman got mauled badly on the upside. 
3. Jim Chanos has been short major oil companies since what, 2010. You can look at their charts and see how that
worked out since then. Not too well.


Ackman and Chanos are not stupid guys, although their choices sometimes make you wonder. But their track records,
and who they are, are largely public.

And the author of this article? We don't know anything about him. We don't know his name, because he doesn't tell
us. But here's a link to an article about the person who runs this company:


http://read.bi/1wiPjsr


Maybe he wrote it and maybe he didn't, but regardless he supports it. Personally, I wouldn't be in a hurry to align my
hard earned cash with some 32 year old guy who considers people who don't agree with him to be "delusional" or
"full-on retarded" (see the article)..


If you're going to go short, make sure you've got your stops in place. Chanos and Ackman have bigger pockets than
we do, and the guy who wrote this may already have covered.


Because if history is any guide, it's usually not about fact, it's about manipulation.

Trend,


Do you have anything valid to add to the discussion?


QCOR and HLF are completely different, independent, cases.


I wrote 'fear-mongering' coverage about ANGI last summer at $29 and DCIX last spring at $7, those stocks
are $10.60 and $2.72 now respectively. Therefore, by those data points alone, CATM is an obvious short!


That logic doesn't work so well, eh?

Oh man, you said it all right there. That's the stock market in a nutshell.


29 May 2014, 05:22 AM


trendwatcher100
The 'logic', as you call it, seems to be working quite well so far, and sooner than I had expected.


The stock has recovered from about 28 when this article was written, to about 35 today. The fear-mongering
effect seems to have worn off. And it looks to go up further, assuming the market itself doesn't reverse, which
would take everything down regardless.


Still short? :)

Author’s reply »  We are not particularly impressed by this small insider transaction, especially when put in
the context of other such trades. For instance, throughout 2012 and 2013, based on Form 4 filings with the
SEC, CATM's CEO sold 35,000 shares at prices near the current level (below $31), with a weighted-average
price of $29.23, and surrendered an additional 77,835 shares to cover tax liabilities, at a weighted-average
valuation of $25.97 (again, all below $31). Similarly, the company's CFO in 2012 and 2013 sold 237,974
shares at prices below $31, averaging $28.31, and surrendered another 35,655 shares at a weighted-average
valuation of $26.94. CATM's highest-ranking executives have been perfectly willing to part with shares at or
well below current prices.

Hello,


Thanks for the very interesting trade idea. I am just wondering about your earnings multiples when you say: "Despite
its exclusive focus on the secularly declining ATM market, CATM trades at the rich valuation of a high-growth firm,
with trailing and forward P/E ratios of 37x and 26x". I see FY 2014EPS of $2.25 from the company
(http://reut.rs/1psz2ze). This would put them at 13x P/E which is still too high in my opinion but am wondering how
you get 26x. Are you saying 26x based on 5 year depreciation or something? Thanks.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The 26x figure was based on our estimate of GAAP EPS using CATM's own guidance, not
the non-GAAP EPS that you correctly cite. As you'll see in the company's 1Q14 earnings release
(http://bit.ly/1nIedQJ), GAAP net income is forecast to be $53.6-55.8 million on 44.8 million weighted-average
diluted shares outstanding, for GAAP EPS of $1.20-$1.25. This is totally separate from the question of what
the right depreciation schedule is, and we're simply using CATM's own numbers, not making any controversial
assumptions. The numbers you're seeing are based on the company's non-GAAP "Adjusted Net Income"
figures, which incorporate an array of questionable add-backs, including stock-based compensation (a real
economic expense), non-cash interest expense (likewise real), and intangible amortization expense.
Regarding non-cash interest expense, the company is a high-yield debt issuer but, like other such firms,
issued convertible bonds with a low cash interest cost but a much higher economic cost because of
embedded optionality. GAAP accounting properly recognizes the economic cost, reflecting the fact that if
CATM were to refinance in normal non-convertible form, it would face a much higher cash interest rate in the
long term. Thus we do not view CATM's add-back as well-justified. There is a better case to be made for
intangible amortization, which is why we do adjust for that expense in our more detailed analysis under the
heading "Adjusted for Normalized Depreciation, GAAP Earnings Power Indicates Sharply Lower Price” (p. 36
of the PDF version of the report here: http://bit.ly/1nIedQP).

Other points of view:


Jefferies defends Cardtronics over Kerrisdale allegations 
Concerns recently raised about Cardtronics' (CATM) accounting practices and the growth of the number of ATMs it
manages are unfounded, research firm Jefferies wrote in a note to investors earlier today. WHAT'S NEW: Ramsey El-
Assal, an analyst at Jefferies, responded to negative claims about Cardtronics that were recently made by research
firm Kerrisdale Capital in a May 27 Seeking Alpha piece. Despite allegations regarding accounting practices related to
depreciation of the company's automated teller machines, there is nothing wrong with the company's depreciation
practices, El-Assal wrote. The analyst also disagreed with assertions that the number of ATMs managed by
Cardtronics is barely growing when acquisitions are excluded. In fact, the number of ATMs managed by the company
is growing even when acquisitions are excluded, the analyst believes. He kept a $41 price target and Buy rating on
the shares.


And:


Cardtronics initiated with an Outperform at Wells Fargo.

Does the Welch acquisition change your investment thesis on CATM? Management seems to have addressed the
depreciation life issue at recent investment conferences, and it seems that 7-Eleven as a percent of sales should
decline with the Welch acquisition. It appears management has enough debt facility to buy two more Welch's over the
coming years ahead of the 2017 7-Eleven contract renegotiation. Seems like CATM's management team is executing
well in this environment. I think they report next week. Are you staying short ahead of the call? Adding more to your
short position? Thanks again for all the work. Tough business obviously!

This is the summary I received regarding management's comments at a recent William Blair conference. I
was not in attendance. Hope this helps.


Management provided more information on the depreciation schedule of its ATMs. Management indicated
that about 48% of Cardtronics' ATMs are 0-3 years old, 23% are 4-7 years old, and 29% are over 7 years old.
Further, management estimates that the average depreciable life is 6.4 years (management estimates most
banks use 7 years).
