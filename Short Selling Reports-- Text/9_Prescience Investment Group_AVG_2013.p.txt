AVG: Feb 1st Google Policy Updates Threaten AVG's Growth Engine,
Signals Steep Downside
Jan. 31, 2013 1:51 PM ET30 comments
by: Prescience Investment Group


AVG Technologies' (NYSE:AVG) Platform business (i.e. the internet search product),
including its browser toolbar, has been its most successful program to monetize its
user base and has been AVG's primary growth engine, having grown from 8% of
sales in 2008 to 45% of sales in 2012. We believe this revenue stream is in jeopardy.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), AVG's primary search partner and currently the source of
substantially all of AVG's Platform-derived revenue, is on the verge of announcing an
update to its toolbar policy, something that has not been widely followed or discussed
by market participants. Furthermore, few, if any, analysts on the street appear to be
aware of the upcoming changes; if they are, they have decided not to publish or
update their models accordingly. We believe that current consensus revenue and profit
projections for AVG are severely inflated.
Imminent changes to Google's policies could dramatically lower the rate at which users
install the AVG toolbar and consent to its default search option, at least slowing, but
more likely severely reversing growth in AVG's Platform business.
The market appears to have misunderstood the significance of AVG's recent
partnership with Yahoo (YHOO), with the stock rallying close to 50% on the news. We
believe this partnership was formed in desperation and anticipation of imminent
Google toolbar policy updates. While AVG has added Yahoo as a backup monetization
partner, Yahoo's ability to generate revenue for its partners is far below Google's, and
if the day comes that it has to flex its reliance on Yahoo search, AVG's revenue will
likely contract in a major way.


We believe the equity is highly overvalued at current levels, with an intrinsic value
of $8.50-$10/share, 30-40% below current trading levels.


Introduction


In the past decade, Internet search engines became one of the main revenue sources for
software developers. The tremendous jump in search-engine advertising created a
revenue stream for many software companies using the profit-sharing model. This model
of directing users to search engines allowed many software developers to transition to a
freeware model and helped them to grow. AVG is one of these developers.

AVG produces a suite of software security products, some of which generate Subscription
Revenue and others that are distributed for free (i.e. freeware). AVG's hope is that its
users download the internet search-based products (AVG Secure Search) that it bundles
with its security products, so as to monetize its user base. In the event that an AVG user
uses AVG's secure search functionality and clicks on a Google or Yahoo ad or sponsored
link, the user generates money for that search engine, which is shared with AVG. AVG's
Platform-derived Revenue is revenue AVG earns from its contracts with search engine
providers.


Historically, AVG worked exclusively with one search engine provider at a time - either
Google or Yahoo. It had an exclusive revenue share agreement with Yahoo from February
2008 to November 2010, and in November 2010 switched to begin working exclusively
with Google. That contract expired in November 2012; in negotiating for a contract
renewal with Google in Q42012, AVG sought non-exclusivity, was granted it, executed the
new contract, and went on to engage in a second revenue-sharing agreement with Yahoo.


Subscription Revenue accounted for ~55% of 2012 sales. AVG's Platform business (i.e.
the internet search product), including its browser toolbar, has been its most successful
program to monetize its user base and has been AVG's growth engine, having grown
from 8% of sales in 2008 to 45% of sales in 2012.


The immense success of the Platform business can be attributed to a very high rate of
toolbar attachment to platform users; and, that, in hand, can be attributed to what seems
to be questionable business practices. As we will demonstrate in the sections that follow,
AVG appears relentlessly focused on growth, but at the expense of the user's experience.


AVG Toolbar and Default Search

Below is a screen shot taken from one step in the process of installing an AVG antivirus
program. It is a user's consent screen, which if clicked through hastily, enables AVG to
install its toolbar and Secure Search program on the user's PC.


Figure 2: Install Process


Note that all the features are "opt-out"; in other words, the boxes are already checked
such that the default is to install AVG Search. In many instances, AVG Security Toolbar is
often installed unexpectedly, as mentioned in this recent public rant on ZDnet.com. The
author states the following:

I recently installed a software (PowerISO) and without consent it installed AVG
toolbar and other software on my system which has completely modified my
computer without my knowledge.


My browser (Chrome) now goes to your AVG homepage and Google search has
also been replaced by AVG. The same is happening in Firefox and Internet Explorer.
This has caused me hours in productivity and unnecessary frustration. The same is
also happening after I uninstalled your toolbar (from inside Program and features)


I did NOT want this and modifying my computer like this is totally unacceptable. Your
call yourself a anti-virus company while in fact the behavior is exactly that of a mal-
ware which hijacks your browser and causes problems.


This is the type of software that sneaks onto users' computers because they hit the
"Next" button without reading. Some would argue that this is their fault, and while I
understand that point, it's still completely unacceptable to have checkboxes like this
one checked by default…. You had the audacity to change my settings in the first
place just because I was tricked into clicking a shady checkbox, why should I have
to read a FAQ and manually revert them after? Do you have no respect for your
user's time? I'm sure the programmer who wrote the program to change my settings
in the first place could definitely write a uninstaller to revert them too. But you would
not do that. It's a shame that of all the unscrupulous companies who would use such
ploys, an anti-virus company like AVG is doing it instead! I'm sorry but this is just too
fishy.


Even though the user's consent to install the AVG toolbar or default search is obtained
during the installation process (in the user clicking the 'next' button), thousands of
complaints litter the internet regarding AVG requiring the user to opt-out. It is thought of as
a questionable practice. Many users, either pressed for time or not having an
understanding of what they are truly installing, unwittingly click the "next" button to
complete the antivirus installation.


Although the uninstall seems easy enough, thousands more complaints litter the internet
complaining that default search has nested in their browsers and cannot be removed
(Google search "AVG Default Search" or visit RipOffReport). Furthermore, even when a
user goes to uninstall, AVG recommends that its default search remain on your system -
another opt-out! This is a last ditch effort to hold on to the user. But what for?

Why try to hold onto the user at this stage, when he/she is requesting an uninstall? When
searching a common key word such as "Kim Kardashian" you'll notice a key difference
between an AVG Search and a Google Search:


Figure 4: AVG Secure Search (isearch.avg.com)Figure 4: AVG Secure Search
(isearch.avg.com) 


AVG search has three sponsored ads at the top and three sponsored ads at the bottom of
the search results page, a total of six sponsored Ads. Typically, Google displays only two
or three sponsored ad listings, contained in a yellow, highlighted area.

Figure 5: AVG Secure Search results (note the three sponsored ads at top and three
at bottom)


AVG's sponsored links are not contained in a highlighted box, potentially a clever trick to
present sponsored ads as organic search results.


Based on a study conducted by Search Engine Watch, 53% of Organic Search clicks go to
the first link. Search engine users overwhelmingly click on organic search results on
Google and Bing by a margin of 94% to 6%. By presenting them in the manner Google
displays organic search results, AVG appears to be trying to dupe its users into clicking
into the sponsored links, for which it would be compensated.


Not Just a Checkbox: Opt-outs Have Reliable Effects on User Outcomes


AVG and others in the toolbar industry rely on users skipping over the pre-ticked
checkboxes to achieve their desired install rates. They do it because it works. After all, if
opt-ins snared users at rates similar to opt-out, why wouldn't they avoid the issue and
default to opt-in?

At nearly every opportunity, consumers will "opt-in" at rates far less than those at which
they "opt-out." This well-known behavioral phenomenon appears in many contexts and
has been the basis of consumer protection laws and FTC enforcement actions - from
overdraft fees to cell phone billing to online, post-transaction marketing. Opt-ins are the
legal default in many arenas for the purpose of consumer protection.


Further evidence of the importance of opt-in vs. opt-out in decision psychology is
observed in the following:


1. Email: It is well known in email marketing that "opt-out" lists perform far worse - in
terms of emails opened and quantity of unsubscribe requests received - as compared
with "opt-in" lists, as opt-out recipients never explicitly requested to receive the
messages. The gold standard in email is "double opt-in": First the user must request to
be subscribed to a list, and must later confirm his desire once more.


2. Banking: Despite aggressive promotion and, to some, misleading marketing
campaigns, only 33% of consumers opted in to overdraft protection once the Federal
Reserve began to require it.


3. Organ Donation: Even the most ethically fraught of decisions, such as whether to
donate your organs, is heavily influenced by the default choice, whether it is opt-out or
opt-in. Quoting an article published in Science Magazine, Dan Ariely, author of
Predictably Irrational, discussed what he called one of his favorite graphs in all of
social science:

AVG's rate of toolbar attachment to platform users is likely to crater if it is mandated to
make opt-in the default, as opposed to opt-out. If the company were confident that users
desired its toolbar and default search, it would happily default to opt-in, from opt-out, in
light of the damage to its brand equity that is resulting from thousands of documented user
complaints.


"Don't be Evil" - Google Toolbar Policy Update Coming on Feb 1


The slogan "Don't be evil" is ingrained in Google's DNA and is evident in the continuous
evolution of its policies and algorithms, a devotion to constantly improving the user
experience. It frequently updates its search services (e.g. Panda and Penguin updates),
policies, and AdSense products. Very recently on Google's Q4 earnings call, Nikesh
Arora, Senior Vice President, stated that during the fourth quarter of 2012 Google made
changes in policy and enforcement that improved CPCs and search quality:


These enforcements had the effect of reducing ad clicks on the sites of certain
AdSense for search partners. These policy updates are part of our ongoing work to
improve user experiences on Google and on site in terms of using Google Search.
Since these policies improve the experience of both users and advertisers, we firmly
believe they are good for our business in the long-term… we've always had a policy.
The policy has been that we want to make sure that whatever ads are presented in
whatever way our traffic is routed to ads, it is done in the best interest of the user
and we began to notice that they were sites and pages whereas we had too many
ads in a page, so it became more restrictive and updated our policies for better
enforcement and that has resulted in higher quality results for end users, it has
reduced in some cases the monetization that some of our partners are seeing
as a result of this enforcement and hence you are seeing the impact on the
numbers. We just announced this policy in the past quarter that we just went
through, so you are going to see the impact over the next few quarters. We've
also implemented more stringent policies around downloadable apps, and that's why
I think both those effects are going to stay with us for the year, but we think in the
long-term is the right answer for us, it's the right answer for users and it's right
answer for advertisers, so we think it's a good thing to do.


We should note that many companies have built their entire business models on
monetizing Google search results. Although Google's best intention is to improve the user
experience, sometimes this comes at the expense of its search or AdSense partners. One
such partner, Local.com (NASDAQ:LOCM), was significantly negatively impacted by the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147451-avg-feb-1st-google-policy-updates-threaten-avgs-growth-engine-signals-steep-downside 9/25


above-mentioned policy changes, as reported in a press release distributed on January
24, 2013; the company revised its fourth-quarter guidance to revenue of $20.9M, versus
prior guidance of $22-23m, and adjusted EPS of ($0.04), versus prior guidance of $0.00.
The reduction in second-half growth was attributed to "unexpected revenue per click
(RPC) declines from our main ad partner coupled with previously announced fourth-
quarter ad policy changes." Local.com was impacted significantly, and per Google, may be
impacted for the next several quarters.


Google policy changes can have nasty consequences for companies reliant on Google-
sourced revenue that get caught in the crosshairs. Given its seemingly questionable
business practices in getting users of its antivirus products to download the hard-to-get-
rid-of, revenue-generating AVG toolbar, might AVG be one of those companies?
Undoubtedly, yes. Might AVG's primary growth engine, its Platform search business, be
put to the test? Absolutely, yes.


Google is on the verge of announcing an update to its toolbar policy, something that has
not been widely followed or discussed. We first learned of this from a Bloomberg article
published on December 16, 2012. The article contends that Babylon and Perion
(NASDAQ:PERI), two Israeli companies whose businesses highly depend on monetization
of the Google Toolbar, would be negatively impacted by the impending policy update:


Calcalist reported today companies such as Babylon and Perion Network may see a
negative impact from Google's effort to keep companies from stealthily adding
options to users' toolbars when they download software."


We learned of the date of the toolbar policy change, February 1, 2013, in reading another
Bloomberg piece, in which Perion CEO Josef Mandelbaum stated, "Perion was asked to
make the changes, which come into force Feb. 1, to guarantee transparency." The Google
Toolbar policy change was even brought up during Yahoo's Q412 earnings conference call
by Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer & Co.:


…I want to ask about Google's pending Toolbar change. It would seem that's
probably a positive benefit to Yahoo! and Bing with respect to how the policies are
different. So can you comment if there's any expectation for a lift for that?


Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer rightly responded, "On the Toolbar change from Google, we'd
be remiss to offer comment on another company's product, so I'm not going to comment
further there." Piecing all the excerpts together, we know that the Google Toolbar policy

change is coming and that it will most likely reduce new installs, given that it will force
"transparency" and is designed to keep companies from "stealthily" adding toolbars; we
also know it will take effect on February 1, 2013.


Google's policy updates are aimed at increasing transparency for users that download
3rd-party software. Although it is not clear exactly what the rule changes will look like, we
do know they are intended to enrich the user experience. We also know that amongst the
biggest sources of user complaints are the dubious methods used by companies such as
AVG to ensure their default search and toolbar extensions get installed. Looking at the
Mozilla Firefox support site, many are labeling AVG's default search as malware. As
previously discussed, because they are all "opt-out" (i.e. users manually have to uncheck
the install boxes), and most users usually zoom through the installation process, scores of
them have unexpectedly installed unwanted toolbars and have had their internet browser's
homepage hijacked. And many users have documented their complaints that these
companies have made it incredibly challenging to remove the toolbars.


I got this AVG nightmare after installing Firefox . I wasted 4 hours of my life trying to
disable it. I did a regedit, and removed it from my system, and it still hijacked my
internet explorer. After countless hours, and support from the entire internet
community, i was able to disable it from hijacking my browser, but could not remove
it somehow, the avg search engine remove button is disabled.I can remove anything
but I can't remove the Avg search engine WTF??? any way to disable it, Go to
Control panel- internet options- manage add ons-select AVG search engine- right
click, disable it. if you can remove it, do It!!! THERE ARE SOME MANY FREE
ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE OUT THERE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD AVG, IT IS A
FREAKIN' VIRUS!!!!!! i also DELETED firefox, until they can figure out how to
manage their freakin' malware extensions.


Like Babylon and Perion's, AVG's growth ambitions are wholly dependent on its ability to
monetize the Google Toolbar. But in December 2012, AVG's stock price significantly
appreciated when it announced a search partnership agreement had been executed with
Yahoo. On the associated conference call, management stated that it simply looked at this
deal as "derisking revenue concentration" but that it wouldn't "necessarily add any
incremental revenue":

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147451-avg-feb-1st-google-policy-updates-threaten-avgs-growth-engine-signals-steep-downside 11/25


…the search diversification strategy allows us to diversify at a user level. It's not
necessarily tied to geos, meaning that I can have 2 or 3 providers within any given
geo. And so with that, it would mean that we would decide which search to distribute
to any given customer. Now it's important to note that we won't mix the search
results so that they get a mixed feed. They will either be, at this point in time, either a
Yahoo! customer … or a Google customer exclusively.


Since November 2010, AVG has used Google exclusively; and, it is widely recognized that
Google's payout ratio in search is second to none. In fact, AVG itself saw its revenue per
active platform user double when it switched from Yahoo to Google as its search partner
back in November 2010, jumping from $0.51 in 2010 to $0.94 in 2011 (AVG 20F,
12/31/2011, p.61). One expects a transition back to Yahoo to work similarly in reverse.


Second-sourcing an inferior Yahoo search product with lower monetization rates goes
against industry trends. AVG is preparing for Google toolbar policy changes, and we
believe it is desperate for a solution to what is likely to manifest itself as a steep dive in the
expected revenue growth rate. We believe a more correct market response to the
announcement of a deal with Yahoo is hard-selling, not bidding up, AVG stock, right when
the company's prospects are subject to greatest levels of uncertainty.


Google's policy updates are aimed at increasing transparency for users that download

What if the GOOG policy were to move to more consent based, opt-in versus "opt-
out"


If the GOOG policy updates mandate the toolbar companies adjust their methods of
obtaining user consent from opt-out to opt-in, AVG's new user installs would be
dramatically impacted and search traffic would fall precipitously. Further, if the internet
community regards these toolbars and "hijacked home pages" as malware, why would
anyone install them? Imagine, if an internet user is looking to download free AVG anti-
virus software, why would he or she want to install 3rd-party search tools? All browsers
including Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer have search already built into the address
bar. Why install a cumbersome 3rd-party search when there is no value-add? An opt-out
policy is likely to impact new user installs by at least 50%. This would have significant
impact on AVG (whose fastest growing segment is its search-related Platform business),
BBYL.IT (almost all its business is search) and PERI (more than 60% of sales from
search).


Perion's CEO has come out and said these policy updates won't impact the company.
However, AVG and BBYL.IT management have said nothing. Since the new GOOG policy
changes will be announced Feb 1, 2013, no one knows exactly what will. But we have
collected a great amount of data, and are confident in our assessment that the impact is
likely to be a big negative for these companies, especially given what we have assessed
throughout this report as questionable, user-damaging business practices - exactly what
Google intends to put a halt to. I revert to the example of LOCM, which although in the
display business, was hurt by the display ad policy update recently enforced by GOOG. I
am sure LOCM was given pre-warning by Google of the new policy changes coming down
the hatch prior to implementation (in fact, it revealed as much in its Q312 earnings

announcement and Q312 10Q, warning of changes by its key traffic and monetization
partner, Google). This would have given the company ample time to prepare etc, and yet
still, it missed guidance.


Eventually all of these companies will either bust or figure out a way to work with new
Google policies. But down the road, these policies are bound to get updated again, and
then these companies will be impacted again.


Regardless, we are in the now, and right now we know Google's desire for its partners is
to be more transparent (whether or not an "opt-out" model is rolled out) with the users of
its products, and from that perspective, whatever comes is highly likely to impact the
growth engines of many of these companies in the short-term.


AVG's Revenue Growth Expectations Warrant Reduction of 40%-50%


Should the upcoming policy changes materialize as we expect, there are two scenarios
that could play out for AVG:


1. Policy changes do take place, and AVG sticks with Google as a revenue partner, but
fewer downloaders install the toolbar as a result of the switch to opt-in.


2. Policy changes do take place, and AVG switches to Yahoo as a partner as a result.
Yahoo will then allow current practices (opt-out) to continue, and it will monetize each
search at rates 50% that of Google.


In either case, we expect both revenue and EBITDA are likely to fall short of consensus
estimates. Per Bloomberg, consensus estimates of 2013 sales and EBITDA are
approximately $403M and $117M, respectively. JPM projects that 2013 Platform Revenue
(revenue from search monetization) will be $195M. These figures do not take into account
the likely effects of the Feb 1, 2013, Google policy changes, and few of the analysts on
the street appear to be aware of the upcoming changes; if they are, have decided not to
publish or update their models. As noted above, Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer & Co.
raised the issue of these changes on the recent Q412 Yahoo earnings call, but,
unfortunately, he does not cover AVG.


We've derived our revenue projections for the two above scenarios using the below critical
assumptions:


(1) Quarterly churn rate for the current install base (installed prior to Feb 1, 2013): It
is true that, even with the new policy change, AVG can rely on the existing installed base
of users to maintain some portion of its platform revenue stream. Unfortunately, churn
rates in the toolbar industry are exceedingly high. Guy Malachi, Chief Geek at Conduit, a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147451-avg-feb-1st-google-policy-updates-threaten-avgs-growth-engine-signals-steep-downside 14/25


large privately-held toolbar vendor, estimated in an answer on Quora that the typical
lifespan of a toolbar is around two months on the low end to just over a year on the high
end. A toolbar lifespan of just over a year translates to roughly a 35%/quarter churn rate.
For conservatism, we'll assume a quarterly churn rate for existing customers of less than
15%.


(2) Quarterly churn rate for new users (installed after Feb 1, 2013): Because the new
Google Toolbar policies are more transparent and consent-based, users who specifically
opt-in to install the AVG Toolbar would more likely remain users longer. As a result, one
would expect lower churn as compared with today's installed base of opt-out users who
may have installed the toolbar unknowingly. We therefore apply a lower churn rate to new,
opt-in users. The model assumes a quarterly churn rate of less than 8% for these new
users going forward.


(3) Opt-in rate: The opt-in rate is measured as a percentage of the total new installs: the
fraction of the total users installing the software that also choose to install the toolbar. To
be conservative, we estimate an opt-in rate of 65%. In reality, this figure will likely be far
lower.


(4) Google monetization versus Yahoo: It is well known in the industry that Yahoo
generates significantly less revenue on average for its search traffic than does Google (we
have heard that Yahoo monetizes at ~50% less than Google, and perhaps worse in
international markets). There are a number of reasons for this, including a lower average
cost per click. The model assumes Yahoo monetizes at a rate that is 50% of what Google
achieves.


Using the above assumptions and running sensitivity analysis on the opt-in rate and
Yahoo's level of monetization (as compared with Google's), we estimate 2013 Platform-
derived revenue ($MM):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1147451-avg-feb-1st-google-policy-updates-threaten-avgs-growth-engine-signals-steep-downside 15/25


Scenarios A and B both yield a revenue projection substantially lower than JP Morgan's
forecast for 2013 platform revenue. The key drivers, unsurprisingly, are the change in opt-
in rates and the gap between Yahoo's and Google's monetization capability. For scenarios
A and B, the model predicts a range for 2013 revenue of between $36M and $75M,
respectively, again using conservative assumptions. At the low end (Scenario B), AVG
remains with Google as a search partner, but suffers reduced toolbar installs as the opt-in
rate could be closer to 25% (or less) due to new policy changes. At the high end (Scenario
A), if AVG decides to maintain its search traffic by switching to Yahoo as a search partner-
allowing it to maintain default install rates via opt-out vs. opt-in-its monetization rate could
decline ~50% compared with Google. At a 65% opt-in rate and monetization = 50% of
today's level, revenue hit $75M.


No matter whether the upper or lower bound seems more likely-be it $36M (opt-in =25%
and monetization = 100%) or $75M (opt-in = 65% and monetization = 50%) - the
company's platform revenue could significantly miss JPM's 2013 estimates, which we
assume are representative of the street's consensus. We suspect AVG management may
have conducted a similar scenario analysis and thus announced the surprising Yahoo
search partnership in Dec 2012.


JPM estimates that 2013 revenues for AVG's subscription and platform base business are
approximately $212M and $195M respectively for a total topline of $407M. We estimate
the 2013 revenue range between $248M and $287M. Current consensus 2013 EBITDA
margins = 29% and EV/EBITDA = 7.39x. Applying the consensus EBITDA margin and
multiple to our revenue projections results in an estimated EBITDA range of between
$71M and $83M, and enterprise value between $530M and $614M. Thus, the implied
market capitalization and target price would between $399M and $569M, or
$7.34/share and $10.28/share respectively.


The current share price is $14.65. Based on the Google policy change on Feb 1, 2013 and
coming browser changes (see appendix), we believe the shares should be trading
between $7.34 and $10.28. We encourage the reader to conduct his or her analysis. The
figures are summarized below.

Appendix 1: It's Not Just Opt-Out vs. Opt-in: AVG is Being Evicted from its Market
Opportunities


Beyond Google's forthcoming switch to potentially make users explicitly "opt-in" to
download associated toolbars, other browser and operating system changes might
similarly diminish install and retention rates.


A recent article in ZDNet lays out the coming changes. First, "[b]eginning with Internet
Explorer 9, new toolbars and other add-ons are disabled by default. You must specifically
enable them before they're active." Similarly, "Mozilla Firefox has a similar add-on
approval feature."


More worrisome for toolbar vendors, Chrome 25, released in beta on Jan 14, 2013, makes
several highly significant changes to how extensions can be installed/activated.


1. Previously, it had been possible for 3rd-party applications (like AVG) to silently install
extensions into Chrome on Windows using the registry. As Google's blog notes, "[T]his
feature has been widely abused by third parties to silently install extensions into
Chrome without proper acknowledgment from users." As a result, such silent installs
will now be disallowed.


2. New extensions installed by 3rd-party programs will be disabled by default.
Users now have to click on chrome menu, where they are presented with the option to

3. In addition, all extensions previously installed using external deployment options
will be automatically disabled. Chrome will show a one-time prompt to allow the re-
enabling of any of the extensions:

Given how complex it is today for users to remove AVG's toolbars (6-9 specific steps) vs.
a one-click uninstall, it's hard to imagine that these changes won't impact the rates at
which users install and keep the company's platform toolbars running.

AVG is one of the sleaziest of the internet's bottom-feeders. Their entire business model is based on deception and
trickery to (1) get users to install their trashware, and then (2) make it exceptionally difficult to remove. I speak from
experience, having once clicked through a "next" and found myself saddled with this piece of garbage. I'm a fairly
sophisticated user and I found it a major PITA to get rid of it.


They cannot go broke too soon in my estimation. Sorry for anyone who is invested in the company but, as a computer
user, I would cheer their demise and applaud Goggle's policy in hastening it.

About damn time Google flexed some muscle. How about doing in the Ask tool bar while they're at it?

I believe Chrome changes will affect all toolbars including Ask one, that is you will have to manually enable
them.


This is a great change, as I hate removing those toolbars from my friends and relatives computers.

Thank you for the well researched article. I have learned my lesson the hard (or maybe I should just say annoyed)
clicking thru 'freeware' too fast.


I suspect that alot of the users (maybe not AVG since it is security software) are also children who just click thru this
stuff to get to the game they want to play or program they want to use.

CNET rates the actual antivirus, which is not bad. But most people get the free version, so AVG doesn't
receive any money for it directly.

AVG does not fit into the world of Windows 7 and beyond. MS Security essentials does a much better job.


AVG is very difficult to remove and to do so, must be done with a registry editor in Windows desktop.

AVG is packaged with Windows 8. At end of trial it automatically converts to free version so users have an
additional level of protection. Those sleazes at MSFT are integrating mal-ware with their operating system!

Intel acquired McAfee (for over $7 billion) early in 2011. Probably overpaid.  
AVG's regulatory filings talk about how they are no longer receiving information on competitive plans. Longer
term one would sure think Intel would sell but it is a very small investment for them.

Interesting article. I don't understand your table though. If hypothetically Yahoo monetized at 100% of Google (no ill
effect there) and 95% of users opted in (vs. the assumption that 95% don't opt out today, once again no ill effect
there) shouldn't the platform revenue be $195M, or unchanged from the current estimate? The top left corner of your
table starts at -31%.


Also, it seems like the company will have to choose between lowering monetization with Yahoo, or adopting Google's
new policies, but not both.


05 Feb 2013, 07:26 PM

If you pay attention when you install anything free you should know, as Milton Freedman said, "there is no free lunch"
That should be a cue that you need to opt out of a few things. I felt like I was taking advantage of the company by
opting out, but I did it anyway. I haven't had a virus in years since I've had their product. I love it, and I've been
thinking of buying they're optimizing software. God knows Windows needs a good clean up from time to time. As for
buying the stock, could be a deal to buy, but I'm not eager to buy so close to the QES. I figure it could go either way.

As I expected, AVG's subscription revenue offset weakness in search and unlike what the bears expected, search
results are still growing. Moreover, the company specifically stated that revenue per search went UP in the Q which
implies that the deal they have with YHOO is comparable to GOOG. the company also increased FCF guidance for
the year. I believe the bears have now gotten their catalyst. they have seen what a full quarter of the google policy
change has done to the search business and it is nowhere near as bad as they thought it would be. Moreover, I think
part of the deceleration in search is temporary as the company had an email campaign in q1 to drive that part of the
business and will likely do another email campaign in q3. The company also likely promoted subscription products vs
search to users which is what you want them to be doing. again the deceleration in the Q was NOT revenue per
search but the number of searches, which is more in the company's control and related to what products it choses to
promote to its users. In summary, I still think the high short interest is unwarranted. the company is transitioning to a
more predictable subscription business and this transition will accelerate as mobile products start to get monetized
next year. the transition should result in a higher multiple. the only negative i see is that the revenue guidance
appears more back end loaded, but I also think that q3 revenue guidance is very conservative. The implied EBIT
margin guidance also appears very conservative relative to what they have been doing. The company has a history of
beating its guidance significantly and with a new CEO they probably even had an even higher incentive to make sure
expectations are set low. EPS at less 8x EV/FCF for a business that is still growing nicely, it is difficult to understand
what shorts are thinking. Would be interested to hear from bears on where I am wrong.
