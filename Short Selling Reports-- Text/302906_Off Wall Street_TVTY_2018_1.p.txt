Concept: 
1. Growth of SilverSneakers (82% of 2017 revenue) is slowing, primarily due to share losses to 
UNH’s pilot program, whose expansion should cause further SilverSneakers share loss.  
2. SilverSneakers competitors offer fitness centers higher reimbursement.  Fitness center 
managers are pressuring TVTY to increase payments per visit, which should impact margins.   
3. TVTY is trying to grow revenue per eligible member by increasing visits to fitness centers and 
adding programs such as walking tracked by FitBit.  These efforts should see little success.   
4. TVTY’s Prime Fitness program (15% of 2017 revenue) faces increasing competition from 
similar programs, and from low priced memberships offered by rapidly expanding PlanetFitness 
and other chains. 
 
Summary:  Tivity (TVTY), previously known as Healthways (HWAY), contracts 
with health plans to provide fitness center access, primarily to Medicare 
beneficiaries.  In 2017, 82% of revenue came from SilverSneakers (SS), a program 
for Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare Supplement members, who enroll at 
no additional cost for access to a network of 14,000 fitness locations.  These 
include chains (e.g., Planet Fitness), independent facilities, YMCAs, and adult 
daycare centers.  Some facilities also offer branded SS fitness classes.  Another 
15% of 2017 revenue came from Prime Fitness, an out-of-pocket fitness network 
program for commercial health plan members aged 18-64. The remaining 3% of 
2017 revenue came from its WholeHealth program, sold to health plans, that offers 
a network of chiropractic, acupuncture, and other alternative medicine services. 
 
 SilverSneakers (SS) has been in existence for over 25 years, first as part of 
Healthcare Dimensions, which merged in 2004 with Axia Health Management.  In 
October 2006, Axia was sold to disease management company Healthways for 
$450M.  By 2008, Healthways’ disease management business was deteriorating 
rapidly, as health plan customers chose to insource the work.  In February 2014, 
activist investor North Tide launched a proxy battle, won three board seats, and 
eventually succeeded in ousting the CEO.  A new CEO came onboard in July 2016 
and began to execute North Tide’s plan to focus on SS.  The population 
management business and Healthways brand name were transferred to privately-
held Sharecare.  The SS, Prime Fitness, and WholeHealth programs were retained 
by the company, which renamed itself Tivity Health.  
 


SS is available to about 61% of Medicare Advantage members, a market that 
is growing 8% y-y.  SS’ market dominance is threatened by the staged rollout of a 
competing fitness center network by its own customer, UnitedHealth, which, we 
estimate, generated 25% of SS revenue (or 20% of total revenue) in 2017.  This 
possibility should worry investors, since it seems a reminder of the fate of TVTY’s 
previous disease management business.  UnitedHealthcare (UNH), which has the 
#1 share in the MA market, launched its Optum Fitness Advantage network in two 
states in 2017 and in nine additional states in 2018.  Today, we estimate Optum 
Fitness has 9% of the total MA market.  Our research and discussions with industry
3 


observers suggest UNH is likely to roll out in another 11-14 states beginning 
January 1, 2019.  North Tide also seems to have seen the writing on the wall, since 
it began selling its 11% position in TVTY shares in 1Q17, and owned just 1.6% of 
shares by the time UNH announced its nine state rollout in November 2017.  North 
Tide now appears to be fully wound down, and its founder did not stand for 
reelection to TVTY’s board on May 24, 2018. 
 


We think this rollout is already impacting SS revenue growth, which slowed 
from 10% y-y in 2017 to 4% y-y in 1Q18.  The company blamed flu and cold 
weather for this slowdown, but as we discuss, there may be more to the story.  
Bulls expect a reacceleration to 8% y-y growth for the full year 2018, in line with 
growth of the overall MA market, as the company increases enrollment and visits 
by eligible members.  For 2019, bulls are modeling 8%-9% growth for SS, and do 
not appear to be including a further rollout for Optum Fitness in their estimates. 
 
 The senior fitness benefit market appears fully penetrated, meaning TVTY 
must take business from others to replace any lost UNH revenue.  This could prove 
difficult.  Humana (#2 MA share) already offers SS to nearly all of its plan 
members.  In January 2018, Aetna (#3 MA share) dropped Silver&Fit in some 
areas to become a national SS account.  This helped fill in some of the revenue lost 
from UNH’s nine state rollout, but it also means there is no large client to convert 
in 2019 to offset revenue lost from UNH’s likely continued Optum Fitness rollout.  
We expect SS revenue growth of 5.4% y-y in 2018 and just 1% y-y in 2019.   
 


The introduction of Optum Fitness is not only taking MA members from SS, 
it also threatens to increase the cost of SS visits.  TVTY pays fitness centers in its 
network about $3 for each member visit, capped at about eight visits per month 
($24).  Industry sources say that these rates have been static for many years.  
Fitness center owners are being offered rates of as high as $30-$32 per month by 
Optum Fitness and Silver&Fit, and are asking SS to increase reimbursement per 
visit.  Thus far, there has been little sign of cost pressure in TVTY’s gross margins, 
which were flat at 29% in 2016 and 2017, but we expect cost pressure to increase 
as Optum Fitness rolls out in more states.   


 
Longer term, SS faces challenges because there is no proof that offering the 


benefit actually lowers health plan costs.  As MA plans are squeezed by higher 
costs, they may look to shift dollars to spending that has been shown to lower 
costs.  Industry participants tell us that UNH/Optum, with its superior analytic 
capabilities and formidable operating leverage, may be able to win fitness network 
business away from SS.   We note that Optum already provides services used by 
non-UNH health plans, including utilization management and analytics services.

TVTY has tried a number of programs in an attempt to increase SS 
engagement, and thus revenue, from eligible members.  Our discussions with 
industry participants suggest success has been elusive.  For example, the 
company’s Flex program is supposed to allow SS members to engage in certified 
instructor-led classes outside of the fitness center.  Some of these classes are 
offered at adult daycare centers, which reach members that cannot make it to the 
gym.  While the program looks interesting on paper, industry participants tell us 
that execution has been very poor.  Sales managers are sometimes successful 
getting health plans on board with the concept, but observers say that management 
may not follow through with contracting for the site where it will be offered, or 
finding the instructors for the program. 
 
 TVTY will hold an investor day on June 1, 2018.  It has promised to discuss 
new programs to improve member engagement.  Many of these programs appear to 
be pilot stage.  Industry observers tell us that so many pilots are underway that it 
will be difficult to measure success, if any.  Even execution at the pilot stage 
appears to be a problem.  For example, a FitBit pilot, designed to reward members 
for steps completed, was reported to have been pitched to Humana (HUM) several 
months ago.  We were told that TVTY presenters were challenged to respond to 
HUM’s questions about how the program would work, and did not have an 
adequate analytics plan to measure success.  It will be interesting to learn if HUM 
or another plan has been willing to participate in a FitBit pilot. 
 
 TVTY’s Prime Fitness program (aka Fitness Your Way) was 15% of 2017 
revenue, and grew 22% y-y.  Revenue increased 19% y-y in 1Q18, but benefited 
from a 16% price increase for new members on 1/1/18 ($29 per month from $25 
prior).   Unlike SS, health plan members must pay for this benefit out-of-pocket. 
For $29 per month (with minimum 3 month commitment and a $29 enrollment fee 
that is often waived), Prime Fitness members get access to a network of 10,000 
fitness locations, primarily chains like Planet Fitness, LA Fitness, Curves, and 
Snap Fitness.  As with the SS network, TVTY pays these gyms on a per visit basis 
with a monthly cap.  We model double digit growth in line with the “street,” but, as 
we discuss below, competition in the segment is very high.  In addition, we note 
that in May 2018, TVTY is offering one month free in addition to a waived 
membership fee on its Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TivityHealthFitnessYourWay/).  
We do not see evidence of similar offers in 2017 or before.  Perhaps higher prices 
are hurting enrollment. 
   


On November 6, 2017, the day UNH announced the Optum Fitness 
expansion, TVTY shares declined 34% to $31.60. TVTY management released a 
statement that day maintaining the 2018 guidance it had offered on October 26, 
2017, saying that it had anticipated UNH’s change.  The fact that had not shared 
this important news with its investors prior to UNH’s announcement has of course
5 


triggered multiple shareholder lawsuits.  Since UNH’s announcement, shares have 
risen 22%, despite 1Q18 revenue of $149.9M, below consensus of $154.4M.  Bulls 
appear optimistic that the company can increase enrollments and visits by eligible 
SS members, both during the rest of 2018 and into 2019.  As mentioned above, the 
“street” does not appear to be modeling a further rollout of Optum Fitness 
Advantage. 
 
 The “street” expects $613.7M in revenue in 2018 and $672.6M in 2019, with 
EPS of $2.16 in 2018 and $2.43 in 2019.  We model $597.8M in revenue for 2018 
and $616.5M in 2019, with EPS of $2.03 in 2018 and $1.92 in 2019.  TVTY 
currently trades at 16x consensus 2019 EPS.  Our $27 future fair value estimate is 
based on a multiple of 14x our 2019 EPS of $1.92, below its current multiple of 
16x.  At our fair value price, TVTY’s EV/2019 EBITDA multiple would be 10.3x 
versus its current valuation of 11.3x consensus.  TVTY’s FCF yield at our fair 
value price would be 6.8%.

Background: 
 
 Tivity, based in Franklin, TN, was founded in in 1981 and went public in 
1991 as American Healthcorp.  It later changed its name to American Healthways, 
then to Healthways, and most recently to Tivity.  Today, it has about 475 
employees who maintain relationships with 63 health plan customers and with a 
network of 14,000 contracted fitness centers. We previously wrote about 
Healthways in 2006 (see OWS archives).  
 


SS invented the senior fitness benefit market when Healthcare Dimensions 
started offering the program over 25 years ago.  It gained market dominance in part 
by signing fitness centers to exclusivity agreements, blocking them from signing 
with competing networks.  These agreements often also had one year post-
termination non-compete clauses that also effectively blocked competing networks.  
That changed in June 2013, when TVTY settled anti-trust litigation brought by 
American Specialty Health.  TVTY agreed to end its exclusive contracting, 
opening the door to the expansion of Silver&Fit, and ultimately to UNH’s Optum 
Fitness Advantage.   


 
In 2016, TVTY tried to maintain some degree of exclusivity for its branded 


SS classes by asking fitness centers to block attendance by non-SS members.  The
6 


fitness centers, particularly YMCAs, rejected this move, with some dropping SS 
entirely.  Fitness centers now openly market SS classes as available to all 
members, and over 175 YMCAs around the country are offering classes called 
EnhanceFitness, which are very similar to SS classes.  In addition, Silver&Fit touts 
its program to health plans as giving members access to SS classes at a lower cost. 
 


Health plans offering SS to their members pay TVTY a per member per 
month (PMPM) fee for each eligible member or for each member receiving 
services per month, with some plans paying a combination of PMPM and member 
participation fees (e.g., fee per fitness center visit).  The company calls these 
“hybrid” customers, which is says accounted for 64% of eligible lives in 2018, up 
from 61% in 2016.  Contracts vary widely, and company disclosure is scant, 
making precise modeling difficult.  According to TVTY, only about 7% of SS 
eligible members are active users (6-7 visits per month), 14% are sporadic users, 
and 79% never use the benefit at all.  TVTY positions this as a great opportunity, 
since it can increase revenue if it gets those already eligible for SS to enroll and 
participate more frequently.   


 
TVTY pays participating fitness centers for each visit by a SS member. Most 


fitness center managers report that they receive about $3 per visit, with 
reimbursement capped at about eight visits ($24) per month.  Participating fitness 
locations include YMCAs, independent gyms, Parks & Recreation departments, 
and lower cost chains like Planet Fitness franchises (not available in all locations), 
LA fitness, and Anytime Fitness.  Notably, higher end chains like LifeTime Fitness 
(except some acquired locations that already had SS contracts) do not participate in 
SS.  Industry participants tell us that health plans would like these fitness centers to 
be included, but SS is not willing to adjust its payment structure to win contracts 
with these chains.  In some markets (e.g., Florida), TVTY also contracts with adult 
daycare centers and other locations to offer SS classes to seniors who may not be 
able to make it to a fitness center. 
 


Today, over 80% the 19.1M Americans enrolled in MA plans have access to 
SS or a competing fitness network.  We think this is full penetration, since the 
remaining 20% of MA enrollees are in smaller, lower quality plans that do not 
offer a fitness benefit.  Enrollment in MA plans is growing at about 8% y-y, higher 
than the 3%-4% growth of the Medicare population.  Market experts expect 
continued 8%-9% growth for several years, as more Medicare enrollees choose 
MA over Medicare Supplement insurance or no additional insurance at all.  Only 
about 25%-30% of the 14.1M Americans enrolled in Medicare Supplement 
(Medigap) insurance have access to SS or a competing network.  Unlike MA plans, 
Medigap plans do not receive quality bonuses from CMS to be used to pay for 
“extras” like fitness, dental/vision, or $0 copays. The Medigap enrollment 
population is growing about 3.5% y-y.
7 


 
TVTY has the largest share of the senior fitness benefit market, with about 


61% of MA members and 24% of Medigap members eligible to enroll in SS.  The 
second largest player is American Specialty Health’s Silver&Fit program, which 
we estimate has about 10% share.  Industry participants tell us that many smaller 
plans do not sign exclusively with SS or Silver&Fit, since offering both gives them 
more negotiating leverage. 


 
TVTY’s largest customers in 2017 were UNH and HUM, which together 


generated about 38% of total 2017 revenue, and about 44% of SS revenue. Based 
on MA enrollment data, we estimate UNH represented 25% of SS revenue in 2017, 
while HUM represented 19%.  Other important customers are Aetna (AET), 
Anthem, and independent Blue Cross Blue Shield plans.   


 
About 15% of 2017 revenue came from TVTY’s Prime Fitness program, a 


network of 10,000 fitness centers.  Health plans market this program to their 
members as a discounted gym membership.  Revenue for TVTY comes primarily 
from initiation and monthly membership fees paid directly by plan members with 
their credit cards.  WholeHealth (3% of 2017 revenue) offers a network of 
chiropractic and other alternative care specialists that offer discounted services, 
and also utilization management and accreditation services.  HUM appears to be 
the biggest customer of WholeHealth, with a dedicated 800 number for providers 
on its website.  Cigna also has an 800 number, but that is only for services in 
Washington state and Oregon.  


 
As we discuss below, we think it quite likely that UNH will further roll out 


its Optum Fitness Network in 2019, significantly impacting SS growth in 2019 and 
beyond.  Given that UNH appears to be SS’ largest customer, and that few MA 
plans exist that do not have SS or a competitor, it will be difficult for TVTY to 
replace this revenue.  Moreover, we think the more generous payments made to 
fitness centers by Optum Fitness and Silver&Fit will lead to demands for higher 
reimbursement for SS visits, pressuring TVTY’s margins.  As shown in the table 
below, we think these challenges will lead to lower revenue, EBITDA, and EPS 
than the “street” expects.

Discussion: 
 
1.  UNH seems likely to continue rolling out Optum Fitness Advantage in 2019 
 


TVTY’s 2018 10-K discloses the following about its relationship with UNH: 
 
“While we believe United Healthcare values the health benefits that SilverSneakers 
presents to its Medicare Advantage beneficiaries as well as the brand recognition of 
SilverSneakers among active seniors, United Healthcare may discontinue offering 
SilverSneakers to its Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in additional states in 2019 or 
2020 within contractual limitations and/or may offer multiple fitness benefits, including 
SilverSneakers.” 


 
 
TVTY management has not made any public prediction about the potential 


further rollout of Optum Fitness, but routinely discounts the threat, telling investors 
that the SS brand is so powerful that MA members will and actually have changed 
plans when it is not available.  Bulls seem to have bought into this line of thinking, 
with one commenting on TVTY’s 1Q18 call that there was “some evidence to 
suggest that perhaps they're not winning as market -- as much market share in the 
areas where they insource.” 


 
Our analysis indicates that UNH has rolled out Optum Fitness Advantage to 


about 34% of its total MA membership.  Given this level of commitment, it is 
difficult to imagine that UNH would not continue the rollout, absent some negative 
impact to enrollments.  As shown below, in the 11 states where Optum Fitness is
9 


the sole fitness offering for UNH MA members, UNH has either maintained or 
gained market share.  Its MA membership grew 13% y-y in these states, versus 8% 
y-y growth for the market overall.

 UNH’s success in gaining share in the Optum Fitness roll-out states mirrors 
the success it is seeing nationally, as well.   As shown below, UNH grew its total 
MA enrollment 13% y-y from April 2017 to 2018.  Only AET grew at a faster pace 
(20%), but off of a much lower base.   Thus, SS faces a dual problem.  Not only is 
it losing its largest SS customer, that customer is also the fastest growing MA

Numerous industry participants, including executives at fitness center 
chains, told us that they expect a further rollout of Optum Fitness in January 2019, 
with some mentioning rumors about an expansion into 11-14 more states.  In 2017, 
the chatter about the 2018 expansion began in the summer, when UNH began 
signing up fitness centers in new states, and insurance brokers began getting details
11 


about new plan structures.  We think this scenario is likely to repeat during the 
summer of 2018, with an announcement by UNH in October-November, 
coinciding with the 2019 Medicare Open Enrollment period (10/15/18-12/7/18).  
 
2.  Growth in SS eligible members is slowing, with the impact of UNH losses 
somewhat offset in 2018 by added AET members 
 
 Many MA and Medigap members are eligible for fitness benefits.  We 
estimate that about 80% of MA members are offered the benefit, versus about 
25%-30% of the Medigap population.  As shown in the tables below, the total 
potential market for SS grew about 6% y-y in 2018.  MA market consultant 
Gorman Health Group expects MA enrollment growth of 8%-9% in 2019 and 
2020, with slowing y-y growth of Medigap enrollment 
(https://www.gormanhealthgroup.com/blog/the-outlook-for-government-sponsored-health-programs-in-2018/).

 As shown in the table below, TVTY reported a 6.8% y-y increase in SS 
eligible lives in 2018, 80 bp faster than the growth of its addressable market.  
However, in both 2016 and 2017, the number of SS eligibles grew 320 bp faster 
than the addressable market.

Eligible member growth in 2018 has come from underlying growth in 


membership at existing accounts, and also from AET (#3 MA market share) 
converting from a regional to a national SS account.  With HUM and AET now 
fully penetrated, there do not appear to be any other large accounts TVTY can 
convert in 2019 to make up for losses from a further expansion of its Optum 
Fitness network. 


 
3.  Increased revenue per eligible SS revenue seems unlikely to be enough to offset 
losses from a further Optum Fitness network rollout 
 
 TVTY is trying to increase enrollment of eligible members and visits per 
enrolled member to grow SS revenue 8%-9% per year, above the growth in the 
number of eligible MA and Medigap members.  However, it does not provide 
investors with the metrics needed to determine how SS revenue generation might 
be changing (e.g., % of revenue from visits, % of revenue from PMPM). 
 


The table below illustrates how we estimate the impact of the Optum Fitness 
rollout in 2018 and beyond.  In our model, UNH’s spending increases, but an 
increasingly large part of the spending goes to its own Optum program and SS gets 
less and less of a percentage of the total spending pie. We assume UNH’s 2017 
senior fitness spend was $114M, nearly all of which went to SS.  In 2018, we 
expect this spend to increase 14% y-y (in line with 13% membership growth) to 
$130M, but 30% of this will be spent on its own Optum Fitness program, leaving 
$91M for SS.  We expect SS revenue at other customers to increase 14% y-y to 
$390M, so total 2018 SS revenue would be $481M, up 5% y-y.

In 2019, we assume UNH’s total senior fitness spend again increases by 


14% y-y (up more than the 8% growth of the underlying MA market due to market 
share gains) to $148M, but expect 66% of this to be spent on its own Optum 
Fitness network, leaving $49M for SS.  We generously assume SS revenue at other 
customers to increase 12% y-y to $437M, so total 2019 SS revenue would be 
$486M, up 1% y-y.  In 2020, SS growth improves to 4% y-y since the drag from 
UNH losses is nearly complete. 
 


The sensitivity analysis in the table below illustrates our estimate of the best, 
average, and worst case scenarios for the further rollout of Optum Fitness in 2019.  
In the best case for TVTY, SS retains 50% UNH’s Medicare fitness spend.  In this 
scenario, SS revenue would increase 6% y-y versus the 8% expected by the 
“street.”  The average case, 1% SS growth from UNH, is used in our estimates and 
the table above.  The worst case, only 20% of UNH Medicare fitness spend 
remaining with SS in 2019, would mean a 3% y-y decline in SS revenue.

4.  Recent 1Q18 SS shortfall may not be made up in 2Q18-4Q18 quarters 
 
 SS revenue grew just 4.3% y-y in 1Q18, below the 8% y-y growth expected.  
Total revenue in the quarter missed “street” expectations by $4.5M.  SS revenue 
growth was well below the 6.8% y-y growth in SS eligible lives in 2018.  Reported 
visits were up 5.8% y-y, suggesting fewer visits per eligible member.  However, 
since we do not know how eligibles are actually using SS, or how TVTY is 
compensated for these visits, it is difficult to know how lower visits might impact 
SS revenue. 
 
 Management blamed the miss on lower fitness center visits due to flu and 
cold weather.  This miss surprised the “street,” because management had given no 
hint that January and February were weak when it reaffirmed its 2018 guidance on 
its February 22 4Q17 earnings call.   This lack of transparency seems to repeat the 
pattern illustrated by the company’s silence on the Optum Fitness rollout until 
UNH’s November announcement.
14 


 
 There may be other reasons for the 1Q18 miss.  On January 9, 2018, TVTY 
announced a contract extension with HUM to provide SS through 2022.  The 
existing contract was set to expire in 2020, so it is curious that the companies 
would sign an extension two years early.  We wonder if HUM, knowing that 
TVTY was under pressure from UNH’s insourcing, negotiated a lower fee for SS 
in exchange for the extension.  AET, which had been offering SS in some areas 
and lower cost Silver&Fit in others, became a national SS customer in January 
2018. AET likely switched members from Silver&Fit to SS in exchange for a 
lower overall per member cost.  If these companies, and perhaps others, squeezed 
TVTY on SS pricing, revenue may remain below expectations for the rest of 2018. 
 
 TVTY did not disclose quarterly SS revenue in 2017, but we can estimate it 
based on other disclosed information.  As show in the table below, in 2017 there 
appeared to be little seasonality to SS revenue, with nearly 25% of revenue 
recognized each quarter.  However, industry participants report that senior gym 
visits mirror that in the general population:  Highest in January (New Year’s 
Resolutions) and March (getting ready for the beach), lowest in the summer, and 
then a bit higher October and November, before the holidays.  The lack of 
seasonality in SS revenue in 2017 suggests that the large majority of revenue was 
paid on a PMPM basis, with only a small kicker from increased visits in 1Q17.   
 
Table 10:  Seasonality of SS Revenue 


 
1Q17 2Q17 3Q17 4Q17 


Silver Sneakers Revenue 116.0 114.2 112.6 113.8 
% of Total 25.4% 25.0% 24.7% 24.9% 


 
 Management tells investors that “hybrid” customers, for whom it receives 
both PMPM and per visit revenue, account for 64% of eligible lives in 2018, up 
from 61% in 2016.  Even if TVTY is successful in increasing gym visits during the 
rest of 2018, we doubt that it would be enough to drive revenue growth from 4% y-
y in 1Q18 to the 10% y-y in 2Q18-4Q18 needed to meet “street” expectations. 
 
5.  TVTY has suffered from customer insourcing before 
 
 There is precedent for the insourcing of TVTY services that should worry 
bulls.  In 2008, the company (then known as Healthways), began to lose disease 
management customers.  One of the first to leave was Blue Cross Blue Shield of 
Minnesota in May 2008, followed by Cigna in October 2011.  Insurers said that 
insourcing disease management gave them more control over their members, and 
created more opportunities to collaborate with physicians.  Another reason for 
insourcing was HWAY’s inability to prove a positive ROI for disease management 
programs, at least at the prices it was charging.
15 


 
 UNH’s rollout of Optum Fitness may be driven by similar factors.  Using its 
prodigious analytic capabilities, Optum can combine member gym visit data and 
medical information to design outreach programs for at-risk populations.  Industry 
participants say this outreach may be directed at physicians, rather than patients, 
since providers are thought to be in the best position to influence individual patient 
outcomes.  For example, UNH could flag obese patients within a physician’s 
practice, and provide incentives to physicians who are successful in encouraging 
more frequent gym visits, which could ultimately result in weight loss and lower 
health costs.  If UNH can show a positive ROI for its Optum Fitness network, it 
may win business away from SS at other insurers, many of which are already using 
Optum’s pharmacy benefit and utilization management services. 
 
 Industry participants report that, as was the case for disease management, the 
lack of proof that SS actually reduces health care costs presents a real long-term 
risk for the program.  Today, plans will pay for SS without proof of a positive ROI 
because most pay for it with quality bonuses earned from CMS. These bonuses are 
paid to plans earning 4-5 quality stars from CMS based on effectiveness of 
delivery (e.g., percent of members receiving flu shots) and health outcomes.  These 
plans receive a 5% bonus payment per member that must be spent on “extras” such 
as low/$0 copays, dental/vision, or fitness programs.  In 2018, 73% of MA 
members were enrolled in plans rated 4-5 stars, which helps explain why about 
80% of MA members currently have access to a fitness program (SS, Optum 
Fitness, or Silver&Fit).  As MA costs increase, industry participants tell us it is 
likely plans will try to spend bonus dollars on extras that, unlike the SS program, 
are proven to actually reduce costs.  
 
6.  Gross margin compression seems likely as fitness centers seek SS visit 
reimbursement comparable to Optum Fitness and Silver&Fit 
 


Our interviews with fitness centers suggest that both Silver&Fit and Optum 
are offering much higher reimbursement for senior visits than that offered by 
Tivity for SS.  Instead of SS’ $3 per visit fee capped at 7-8 visits a month ($21-$24 
per month), Silver & Fit and Optum reimburse centers a set amount ($19-$32, 
depending on the center’s basic membership rate) if a member visits at least once a 
month.   At a Snap Fitness in Oregon, Optum pays $32 per month and Silver & Fit 
pays $30 per month, much better than this gym’s $2.85 per visit/$22.80 per month 
cap for SS.  TVTY says its average active member visits 6-7 times per month, but 
many visit just one or two times.  Thus, from the fitness center perspective, the 
Optum Fitness and Silver&Fit payment models offer more potential upside. 


 
Optum Fitness’ payment structure was so attractive to Planet Fitness (~$22 


per month for members visiting at least once a month) that it signed its first ever
16 


corporate agreement for a senior fitness benefit.  In contrast, SS is offered at Planet 
Fitness locations at the discretion of the franchisee. 
 


Industry participants report that fitness centers are increasingly pressuring 
TVTY to increase SS reimbursement to a level more in line with Optum and 
Silver&Fit.  These requests are even coming in the midst of fitness centers’ 2-5 
year SS contracts.  Some industry participants think that TVTY uses “creative” 
ways to increase payments to centers without changing payments per visit.  This 
might include making charitable donations to YMCAs, and funding other 
programing at fitness centers, costs that would probably show up in SG&A. 
 


Thus far, there has been little evidence of this pressure on TVTY’s gross 
margin, which has been flat at 29% in 2016 and 2017.  In addition to perhaps 
shifting some fitness center reimbursement costs to SG&A, TVTY has apparently 
dramatically reduced the number of staff supporting the fitness centers.  We have 
heard, for example, that the number of staff managing the fitness network (e.g., 
handling visit reporting, contracting, quality control) has declined from about 100 
in 2016 to just 35 today.  If this is correct, over a network of 14,000 locations, this 
means each support person has gone from supporting 140 locations to supporting 
400 locations.   
 
 We think the continued rollout of the Optum Fitness network, with its more 
generous reimbursement, could lead more fitness locations to look for higher 
reimbursement from TVTY.  Given the deep staffing cuts TVTY has already 
made, it may become increasingly difficult for TVTY to offset higher payments 
with cuts elsewhere.  TVTY may have to ramp staffing back up in order to 
compete more effectively with Silver&Fit, and perhaps even with Optum, should 
non-UNH health plans begin to consider a switch.  We expect EBITDA margins to 
decline from 23% in 2017 to 22% in 2018 and 21% in 2019. 
 
7.  New programs unlikely to be successful 
 
 With growth in the available SS market slowing and UNH insourcing 
members, TVTY is looking to capture more revenue per SS eligible member by 
increasing enrollment and participation.  On its 2Q17 call, management said that it 
had about 40 pilots underway in SS and Prime Fitness looking for ways to achieve 
this growth.  It promised to provide “definitive participation statistics” from the 
programs after 2Q18, and said it expected 10-12 of these pilots to be fully 
integrated into its programs in 2018 “not at a cost that’s going to erode margins.” 
 
 Industry participants think that by trying so many pilots at the same time, 
TVTY risks being unable to determine which, if any, are having a positive impact.  
There also seem to be significant execution issues with the pilots.  For example,
17 


the company pitched a pilot to HUM that uses FitBits to measure steps, which 
would allow TVTY to get paid for non-fitness center participation.  We were told 
the presentation fell flat when TVTY could not answer basic questions about how 
the impact of the program would be measured.  We also heard that another pilot 
might have even threatened SS members with suspension of their membership 
privileges unless they attended a minimum number of classes per month.   
 
 We may learn more about TVTY’s SS pilot programs from the company’s 
investor day, scheduled for June 1 in New York.  We think it is unlikely that these 
programs would work, if only because TVTY is attempting what seems to be a 
Sisyphean task.  As proved to be the case with disease management, we think it is 
unlikely that SS can change the behavior of the senior population in a meaningful 
way at a reasonable cost.  The root causes of American’s poor health are likely 
much more than a free gym membership can cure. 
 
8.  Prime Fitness faces significant competitive pressures 
 


Prime Fitness was 15% of revenue in 2017, and grew 22% y-y.  The 
program is marketed primarily through Blue Cross Blue Shield commercial health 
plans.  BCBS members who enroll for $29 per month get access to a network of 
fitness centers, primarily YMCAs and lower cost chains such as Anytime Fitness, 
LA Fitness, Planet Fitness, YouFit, Crunch Fitness, and Curves.  The program does 
not include popular higher cost gyms such as LifeTime Fitness and Equinox, or 
boutique yoga, cycling, rowing, cross fit, or other facilities. 


 
TVTY reported 19% y-y growth for Prime Fitness in 1Q18, but much of this 


growth appears to have come from a 16% y-y price increase ($25 per month to $29 
per month) for new members effective January 1, 2018.  The company announced 
to some health plans that it would take this increase in mid 2018, so growth in 
2H17 may have been driven in part by members joining ahead of the increase to 
lock in a lower payment.  The “street” models growth of 21% y-y 2018 and 18% y-
y in 2019.  We model growth of 19% y-y in 2018 and 13% y-y in 2019, which 
could prove generous if TVTY’s price increases drive potential customers to 
competitors. 


 
Prime Fitness faces competition from similar programs.  For example, 


American Specialty Health markets its Active & Fit Direct program, which costs 
members just $25 per month.  Other competing fitness networks are available, 
including GlobalFit and International Fitness Network, which offer discounted 
memberships.  In addition, Prime Fitness must compete with rapidly expanding 
chains within its own network.  For example, Planet Fitness offers access to its 
own network of 1,565 locations for just $21.99 a month.
18 


Many health plans offer fitness center fee reimbursement benefits that give 
members access to a much broader choice of facilities.  For example, UNH will 
reimburse members $20 per month for a gym membership if they go to the gym at 
least 12 times a month.  This means a member with a $10 per month Planet Fitness 
membership could actually make $120 per year for regular workouts.  Other plans 
offer three months of paid fitness center membership per year, regardless of the 
monthly cost.  Finally, the growth of other fitness network membership options 
such as ClassPass are competing directly with Prime Fitness for share of members’ 
wallets. 
 
9.  WholeHealth is small, slow growing 
 
 TVTY’s WholeHealth network generated about 3% of revenue in 2017, and 
seems to be growing in the low single digits.  Its website lists 800 numbers for 
Humana and Cigna, which appear to be its largest health plan customers.  The 
primarily purpose of the network is to provide discounted access for health plan 
customers to chiropractic, acupuncture, and other alternative medicine services.  
WholeHealth also offers health plans utilization management and credentialing 
services. 
 
 We model 3% y-y growth in 2018 and 2% y-y growth in 2019 versus the 
“street’s” expectation of 5% y-y growth in both years. 
 
10.  Sustainable FCF much lower than CFO less capex 
 
 Management says it expects in excess of $100M in FCF in 2018, which it 
appears to calculate as CFO less capex.  The company has significant NOLs that 
will be fully utilized in 2018, so we think it is more instructive to look at 
sustainable FCF (Net Income + Deprec/Amort – Capex). 
 


In 2017, sustainable FCF was $59M.  We model $84M in 2018 and $81M in 
2019.  Nearly all of the y-y cash flow growth in 2018 comes from one-time tax and 
interest expense benefits.  Lower corporate taxes (from 42% in 2017 to 27% in 
2018) add $12M to 2018 FCF, while lower interest expense (per company 
guidance) adds $7M.  


 
The interest expense benefit comes primarily from the full amortization in 


2Q18 of a $38.6M debt discount, saving the company about $2M in quarterly 
interest expense.   In June 2018, the company will repay a 1.5% $150M cash 
convertible senior note with an existing line of credit.  The company may be 
planning to use its cash flow to reduce the interest payments on this line of credit, 
which would be higher than the current 1.5%.
19 


11.  Recent results and guidance 
 
 TVTY reported 1Q18 revenue of $149.9M, lower than the $154.4M 
expected.  EPS of $0.49 was in line.  On its 4Q17 earnings call, management 
guided to 2018 revenue of $607M-$625M, EBITDA of $139M-$144M, and EPS 
of $2.12-$2.20.  It reaffirmed this guidance on its 1Q18 call, despite the top line 
miss.  The company does not provide quarterly guidance. 
 
 Management has also guided for 2018 $4M in depreciation expense, $8M in 
interest expense, a 27% tax rate, diluted shares outstanding of 43.5M-44.0M, free 
cash flow in excess of $100M (discussed above), and capex of $10M. 
 
12.  Financial assumptions 
 
SilverSneakers revenue:  Please see the detailed discussion of our assumptions in 
discussion point 3 above.  We model 5.4% SS growth in 2018 and 1% y-y growth 
in 2019, as the Optum Fitness rollout takes away more of UNH SS revenue.  
“Street” models assume about 8.5% y-y growth in 2018 and 8% growth in 2019. 
 
Prime Fitness revenue:  We assume 19% y-y growth in 2018 as the company 
benefits from increased enrollments and the 16% y-y price increase for new 
members it took on 1/1/18.  According to its Facebook page, this was the first price 
increase it took in five years. We assume it will not be able to increase prices 
further in 2019, so Prime Fitness growth will slow to 13% y-y.  The “street” 
assumes about 21% y-y growth in 2018 and 18% y-y growth in 2019. 
 
WholeHealth:   We assume revenue continues to grow slowly, up 3% y-y in 2018 
and up 2% y-y in 2019.  The “street” assumes about 5% y-y growth in both years. 
 
13.  Valuation 
 
 TVTY shares trade at 16x “street” 2019 EPS.  This is a discount to peers like 
HMSY (23x) and INOV (24x), likely due to investor uncertainty related to the 
UNH rollout.  
 
 We expect TVTY’s multiple to compress further if our assumption that the 
Optum Fitness network continues to roll out is confirmed.  Investors’ level of 
concern regarding TVTY’s future would increase. Our target of $27 is based on 
14x our 2019 EPS. At our fair value price of $27, TVTY’s EV/2019 EBITDA 
multiple would be 10.3x versus its current valuation of 11.3x consensus.  TVTY’s 
FCF yield at our fair value price of $27 would be 6.8%. 
 
14.  Risks
20 


 
 The primary risk to achieving our target price would be a decision by UNH 
to stop the expansion or to drop the Optum Fitness Network pilot.  Other risks 
include higher Medicare Advantage membership growth than we expect, or 
acquisitions of non-SS health plans by those using SS.  TVTY could be acquired 
by one of its health plan customers (e.g., HUM), or could merge with another 
company serving a similar client base (e.g., HMSY).
