Luckin Coffee: Fraud + Fundamentally Broken Business 
 


Executive Summary 
 
When Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ: LK) (“Luckin” or the “Company”) went public in May 2019, it was a fundamentally broken 
business that was attempting to instill the culture of drinking coffee into Chinese consumers through cut-throat discounts and free 
giveaway coffee. Right after its USD 645 million IPO, the Company had evolved into a fraud by fabricating financial and operating 
numbers starting in 3rd quarter 2019. It delivered a set of results that showcased a dramatic business inflection point and sent its 
stock price up over 160% in a little over 2 months. Not surprisingly, it wasted no time to successfully raise another USD 1.1 billion 
(including secondary placement) in January 2020. Luckin knows exactly what investors are looking for, how to position itself as a 
growth stock with a fantastic story, and what key metrics to manipulate to maximize investor confidence. This report consists of 
two parts: the fraud and the fundamentally broken business, where we separately demonstrate how Luckin faked its numbers 
and why its business model is inherently flawed.  
 
 


Part One: The Fraud 
 
Smoking Gun Evidence #1: Number of items per store per day was inflated by at least 69% in 2019 3Q and 88% in 2019 4Q, 
supported by 11,260 hours of store traffic video. We mobilized 92 full-time and 1,418 part-time staff on the ground to run 
surveillance and record store traffic for 981 store-days covering 100% of the operating hours. Store selection was based on 
distribution by city and location type, the same as Luckin’s total directly-operated store portfolio. 
 
Smoking Gun Evidence #2: Luckin’s “Items per order” has declined from 1.38 in 2019 2Q to 1.14 in 2019 4Q. 
 
Smoking Gun Evidence #3: We gathered 25,843 customer receipts and found that Luckin inflated its net selling price per item by 
at least RMB 1.23 or 12.3% to artificially sustain the business model. In the real case, the store level loss is high at 24.7%-28%. 
Excluding free products, actual selling price was 46% of listed price, instead of 55% claimed by management. 
 
Smoking Gun Evidence #4: Third party media tracking showed that Luckin overstated its 2019 3Q advertising expenses by over 
150%, especially its spending on Focus Media. It’s possible that Luckin recycled its overstated advertising expense back to inflate 
revenue and store-level profit. 
 
Smoking Gun Evidence #5: Luckin’s revenue contribution from “other products” was only about 6% in 2019 3Q, representing 
nearly 400% inflation, as shown by 25,843 customer receipts and its reported VAT numbers. 
 
Red Flag #1: Luckin’s management has cashed out on 49% of their stock holdings (or 24% of total shares outstanding) through 
stock pledges, exposing investors to the risk of margin call induced price plunges. 
 
Red Flag #2: CAR Inc (HKEX: 699 HK) (“CAR”) déjà vu: Luckin’s Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu and the same group of 
closely-connected private equity investors walked away with USD 1.6 billion from CAR while minority shareholders took heavy 
losses. 
 
Red Flag #3: Through acquisition of Borgward, Luckin’s Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu transferred RMB 137 million from 
UCAR (838006 CH) to his related party, Baiyin Wang. UCAR, Borgward, and Baiyin Wang are on the hook to pay BAIC-Foton 
Motors RMB 5.95 billion over the next 12 months. Now Baiyin Wang owns a recently founded coffee machine vendor located 
next door to Luckin’s Headquarter. 
 
Red Flag #4: Luckin recently raised USD 865 million through a follow-on offering and a convertible bond offering to develop its 
“unmanned retail” strategy, which is more likely a convenient way for management to siphon large amount of cash from the 
company. 
 
Red Flag #5: Luckin’s independent board member, Sean Shao, is/was on the board of some very questionable Chinese companies 
listed in the US that have incurred significant losses on their public investors. 
 
Red Flag #6: Luckin’s co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer, Fei Yang, was once sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for 
crime of illegal business operations when he was the co-founder and general manager of Beijing Koubei Interactive Marketing & 
Planning Co.,Ltd. (“iWOM”). Afterwards, iWOM became a related party with Beijing QWOM Technology Co., Ltd. (“QWOM”), 
which is now an affiliate of CAR and is doing related party transactions with Luckin.

Part Two: The Fundamentally Broken Business 
 
Business Model Flaw #1: Luckin’s proposition to target core functional coffee demand is wrong: China’s caffeine intake level of 
86mg/day per capita is comparable to other Asian countries already, with 95% of the intake from tea. The market of core 
functional coffee product in China is small and moderately growing in China. 
 
Business Model Flaw #2: Luckin’s customers are highly price sensitive and retention is driven by generous price promotion; 
Luckin’s attempt to decrease discount level (i.e. raise effective price) and increase same store sales at the same time is mission 
impossible. 
 
Business Model Flaw #3: Flawed unit economics that has no chance to see profit: Luckin’s broken business model is bound to 
collapse. 
 
Business Model Flaw #4: Luckin’s dream “to be part of everyone’s everyday life, starting with coffee” is unlikely to come true, 
as it lacks core competence in non-coffee products as well. Its “platform” is full of opportunist customers without brand loyalty. 
Its labor-light store model is only suitable for making “Generation 1.0” tea drinks that have been in the market for more than a 
decade, while leading fresh tea players have pioneered “Generation 3.0” products five years ago. 
 
Business Model Flaw #5: The franchise business of Luckin Tea is subject to high compliance risk as it’s not registered with 
relevant authority as required by law, because Luckin Tea launched its franchise business in September 2019 without having at 
least two directly-operated stores fully operational for at least 1 year.

Our offline tracking results of tracking 981 store-days from 2019 4Q showed 263 items per store per day only:  


 
Source: Luckin filings, offline footage tracking 


 
We mobilized 92 full-time and 1,418 part-time staff on the ground to run surveillance and successfully recorded store traffic for 
981 store-days covering 100% of the operating hours of 620 stores. Store selection methodology was based on distribution by 
city and location type, the same as Luckin’s 4,507 directly-operated stores reported to be open at the end of 2019. Luckin’s 4,507 
stores were in 53 cities, and we covered 38 cities – in which 96% of Luckin’s stores are located. The location type was decided by 
analyzing the detailed address of Luckin’s stores: we separated them into office, mall, school, residential, transportation, hotel and 
others. 
 
We counted the foot traffic of each store and recorded videos from store open to store close, averaging 11.5 hours per day. 
When we double check the foot traffic count and the videos recorded, we discard an entire day’s data if the video surveillance is 
missing more than 10 minutes of footage. Our success ratio was only 54%, and thus all the data presented for the successful ones 
are of 100% integrity. 
 
Below is a side-by-side comparison of the city, location type and store age of: 1) The overall Luckin directly-operated stores 
portfolio (we located 4,409 of them on Luckin’s APP as of Dec 31, 2019); 2) The 981 store-days that we successfully executed 
and presented in the data analysis; 3) The 851 store-days that we visited but failed to record an entire day’s video, reasons 
including execution failure - asked out by Luckin staff, equipment crash etc.  or quality control failure, mostly due to more than 10 
minutes of footage missing for an entire day. The failed store-days are not included in the data analysis.

Below is the full result of our 981 store-days. We have 11,260 hours of recorded store traffic data to back this up. Since there are 8 
internal surveillance cameras in each of Luckin’s stores covering it with no blind angle (Link), investors/auditors can ask the 
Company to provide surveillance videos and sample them randomly to check against reported order numbers.

For each of the 981 store-days we tracked, our staff usually sits in the store with a direct line of sight to the collection counter and 
counts the number of customers picking up Luckin products while recording the video. If a delivery order is picked up by 
delivery personnel, we count the number of Luckin paper bags picked up by the delivery personnel, knowing that each 
personnel can pick up more than one order at a time (one order could comprise more than one bag as well, so we might overcount 
the number of orders). Our result No. of customers picking up Luckin’s products + No. of Luckin paper bags picked up by 
delivery personnel is a good proxy for No. of orders per store per day. Multiplying the No. of orders by the items per order 1.14, 
we get the key metric to be verified – number of items per store per day.

Our tracking started from 2019 4Q. To compare the representativeness of our tracking period to Luckin’s 3Q results, we used 
Luckin APP’s DAU (Daily Active User) per store as a proxy of orders per store per day in the same period. DAU is from Quest 
Mobile; and although Luckin only reports quarterly store number, we got the weekly store number from articles published by 
Luckin’s WeChat Official Account (it publishes the list of new stores opened weekly). 
 
During our tracking period of 2019 4Q to Jan 2020, Luckin APP’s average DAU per store was 0.59K, and Luckin’s 2019 3Q and 
2019 4Q’s average DAU per store was 11% and 0% lower than that of our tracking period, respectively. Our tracking results 
have a low chance of understating Luckin’s daily sales volume per store of 2019 3Q and 2019 4Q.

Luckin has inflated its own APP online order volumes by average of 72%.  
 
As all orders are placed and paid online and picked up offline, when an order is placed, a three-digit pick-up number and a QR 
code will be generated to facilitate the in store pick up. Some may have observed that the three-digit pick-up number appears 
sequential within each store in a day and shared by both pick-up and delivery orders; and use it as a barometer to track the daily 
order volume of a store by placing orders at both opening and close time of the store. 
 


 
 
This method cannot be used if Luckin intentionally jumps and skips numbers during the day to purposely distort the tracking 
results. Here is an evidence of its notice to store managers to watch out for jumping pick-up numbers on Nov 23rd 2019.

We also have more than 10 video evidences recording real-time order jumping processes in store. Though we can’t publish the 
videos due to privacy reasons, we encourage investors to conduct the research themselves: Stay in a store for 0.5-1 hour and count 
the number of orders picked up by customers or delivery personnel. Place an order at the beginning and the end of the session and 
check the online pick-up number gap with the counted number of orders. Our hit ratio of catching order jumping is quite high. 
 
Luckin doesn’t necessarily have to jump orders to commit fraud – they can simply fabricate more orders in their financial records. 
However, here is the clever part: company management likely thought about the possibility that more and more investors and data 
firms were starting to track their order numbers themselves as part of the due diligence process, so “jumping orders” is a simple 
way to mislead investors. To understand the scale of the online order inflation, we randomly selected 151 offline tracking store-
days to track their online orders. We placed one order each at the beginning and the end of a store’s operating hour to get the 
online order count for the day. We found that for the same store on the same day the number of online orders inflated range 
from 34 to 232, with an average of 106 orders/day or 72% of offline order average.  
 


Starting from Nov. 23rd (this
Saturday), the pick-up number
rules will be changed.
Currently, the pick-up number
increases one by one (e.g. 271,
272, 273…). After upgrade, it
will increase randomly (e.g.
271, 273, 274…)
It’s normal to see skipped pick-
up numbers. Please inform the
store staff to prepare the orders
by sequence.

Smoking Gun Evidence #2: Luckin’s “Items per order” has declined from 1.38 in 2019 2Q to 1.14 in 2019 4Q 
 
From 2019 4Q, we gathered 25,843 customer receipts from 10,119 customers in 2,213 stores in 45 cities. The 25,843 receipts 
indicate 1.08 and 1.75 items per order for pick-ups and delivery orders respectively or blended 1.14 (99% confidence level). 
This marked a continuously downward trend of items per order from 1.74 in 2018 1Q to 1.14 in 2019 4Q.

This trend can be attributed to the decline of delivery order contribution, as people naturally tend to buy more items to meet the 
free shipping requirement. Through our store visits, we find that the majority pick-up customers only buy one freshly brewed 
drink, because in most cases, a coupon can only be applied to one of the items in the order, according to Luckin. Per company 
presentation and management communication, the percentage of delivery orders indeed declined from 61.7% in 2018 1Q to 12.8% 
in 2019 3Q and further to ~10% in early January.

Our receipts are collected from more than 10,000 customers in 2,213 stores in 45 cities – distributed in proportion to Luckin’s 
population in terms of city tier and store type (see below for benchmarking). From a statistical perspective, in order to achieve 
95% confidence interval with 2% margin of error on both ASP and items per order, we would require at most 5,000 receipts. We 
increased that five-fold and collected 25,843 receipts to ensure the quality of the data. Our confidence level has achieved 99% 
with 1% margin of error.

In addition, items per order is independent to store types or city tiers, as indicated below. Therefore, there’s zero impact on the result 
by simulating a perfect match to the population distribution. Note that for delivery orders, the customer cannot choose the delivery 
store, so the store distribution by type is only applicable to pick-up orders.

Randomly gathered 25,843 receipts from more than 10,000 customers
24 


Smoking Gun Evidence #3: We gathered 25,843 customer receipts and found that Luckin inflated its net selling price per 
item by at least RMB 1.23 or 12.3% to artificially sustain the business model. In the real case, the store level loss is high at 
24.7%-28%. Excluding free products, actual selling price was 46% of listed price, instead of 55% claimed by management. 
 
Luckin reported a net selling price2 of RMB 11.2 per item in 2019 3Q. On the earnings conference call on Nov. 13, 2019, Luckin’s 
CFO & CSO Reinout Schakel guided even higher price for 2019 4Q. However, our 25,843 receipts indicate net selling price of only 
RMB9.97, i.e. 12.3% inflation versus the reported case (99% confidence level and 1% margin of error statistically, meaning that we 
are 99% sure the price is in the range of RMB9.87-RMB10.07, 1% error.  
 


Actual vs. Reported Price Comparison – Including Free Product 
 


 
Source: Luckin Public Filings, 25,843 Luckin customer receipts, Coffee_Detective calculation 


 
 
Excluding free product, freshly brewed drinks and other products were sold at RMB 10.94 and RMB 9.16 respectively, indicating 
12.3% and 32% inflation versus the reported case. Excluding free product, actual selling price was 46% of listed price, instead of 
55% claimed by management.

Source: Luckin 2019 3Q earnings transcript 


 
2 Net selling price per item was calculated as total net revenue from products over the period divided by total items sold over the period

To clarify, we kept our ASP definition consistent with the Luckin’s own reporting metrics – net effective selling price, net of 
VAT, net of coupon.  Specifically for its “coffee wallet”, we posited that all coffee wallet purchases are counted at 67% of listed 
price i.e. 1) we don’t count any cups sold at “zero” price 2) even for the buy 10 get 10 free (i.e. only 50% of listed price) 
promotional campaigns in each of July, October, November months, we still count at 67% of listed price as the net effective 
selling price.  Therefore, we have a higher probability of overestimating ASP rather underestimating. Applying a perfectly match 
to Luckin’s store distribution, the difference in net selling price will be no more than 1%.

On the aforementioned earnings call, Luckin’s CFO Reinout Schakel circumvented the question on increasing promotion intensity. 
However, our receipts indicate that they even started to offer free drink coupons to existing users since 2019 4Q, vs. previously 
only offering free coupons to new users and users invited them. The percentage of free items is supposedly declining per company 
filings.

Luckin’s CFO Reinout Schakel said they continued to increase the number of people that are already paying the price that they want 
them to pay. Our receipts indicate the opposite – even in mature markets with more mature customers, the effective price was 
stagnant at RMB 10, excluding the free product. There’s no positive correlation between the net selling price per item and 
the operating months.

In the recent Citi conference in January, Luckin CFO Reinout Schakel mentioned that more than 63% of customers are paying 
RMB 15-16 per cup of coffee. In the 2019 3Q company presentation, they pointed out that 63% of items were sold at more 
than 50% of retail price. However, these are all too good to be true and contradict our receipts findings. Our receipts indicate 
only 28.7% of items were sold at more than 50% of listed price. In fact, the majority of items were sold at 28%-38% of 
listed price. i.e. Luckin’s core customers are still very price sensitive. Only 39.2% of customers paid a price higher than 
RMB 12 and only 18.9% were paying more than RMB 15 per cup of coffee.

Why does ASP matter?  If investors still remember Luckin’s own sensitivity analysis on store profitability during their 
presentations, they will find that ASP is the key factor for store level profitability. They pointed out, selling at RMB16 per item at 
400 items per store per day, the store level profitability can be as high as 28.4%. The lower end of ASP below RMB 12, which is 
closer to the real case, is somehow omitted in management’s analysis, representing a much more struggling profitability outlook. 
Under the real case, i.e. 263 items per store per day with net selling price of RMB 9.97, the store level LOSS is at 28.0%, 
based on management presentation. Note that all numbers are provided by management. Take one step back, we give the company 
some credits for achieving economy of scale through sending free coffees and take down the costs at 2019 2Q reported numbers, 
the store level loss is still as high as 24.7%. At current price level, they can only achieve store level profitability by selling 800

Smoking Gun Evidence #4: Third party media tracking showed that Luckin overstated its 2019 3Q advertising expenses 
by over 150%, especially its spending on Focus Media 
  
Luckin disclosed its quarterly advertising expenses before Mar 31 2019 in its IPO prospectus. After IPO, its advertising expenses 
can be calculated using the breakdown of new customer acquisition costs on its quarterly earnings release presenations.

Source: Luckin 2019 3Q Earnings Release Presentation 


 
The reported quarterly advertising expenses are summarized below: 


 
 
In 2019 2Q’s earnings call, the company disclosed for once that Focus Media accounted for RMB 140 million of the total RMB 
240 million + advertising expense in 2019 2Q (they only managed to explain RMB 154.5 million, or 64% of the total advertising 
spending RMB 242 million).  
 
The data tracked by CTR Market Research showed that Luckin overstated 2019 3Q advertising expenses by over 150%: 
2019 3Q CTR implied Focus Media spending was RMB 46 million, only 12% of Luckin’s reported advertising expense, a 
much lower level than previous quarters. Assuming Luckin spent a similar amount on non-Focus Media advertising expenses in 
2019 3Q, Luckin overstated its advertising expense by 158%.

CTR Market Research tracks actual advertising broadcasting of different brands on various media channels, including all the three 
major media channels of Focus Media: LCD display network (office building elevators), poster/digital frame network (residential 
building elevators), and movie theater network – accounting for 82%, 17% and 1% of Focus Media’s total revenue in first half of 
2019, respectively, based on Focus Media’s interim report 2019. 
 
Below are CTR’s monthly tracking results of Luckin’s advertising spending on Focus Media’s channels. Luckin’s spending was 
reduced to a minimum level from September to November 2019, but rebounded in December 2019.  
 


 
Source: CTR Market Research 


 
The dollar amount in CTR’s raw data is media list price, which could be significantly higher than the actual advertising spending. 
To calculate the conversion rate between list price and advertising spending, we calculated it between CTR’s tracking of total 
Focus Media broadcasted advertisements with Focus Media (002027 CH)’s reported revenue. Based on the data from 2019 1Q to 
3Q, Focus Media’s actual revenue is around 8% of CTR tracked media list price. 
 


 
Source: Focus Media filings, CTR Market Research 


 
According to its accounting policy listed in its financial reports, Focus Media’s advertising revenue is recognized “when the 
advertisement is broadcasted to the public”, which is the same time as CTR tracked advertising broadcasting, and the time when 
Luckin should book its advertising expense.

CTR also publishes on their website monthly, quarterly and annual report of largest advertisers based on their tracking. For May 
2019 (Link), for example, CTR noted that Luckin was the largest advertiser combining all the media channels it tracked, 
including traditional outdoor, TV, radio, and the three channels Focus Media used most. Note that Luckin spent 83% of its total 
tracked advertising budget on LCD display network, 12% on poster/digital frame network, and 5% on movie theater network in 
that month.

However, Luckin’s ranking in LCD Display and Poster/Digital Frame top advertisers fell quickly in June and July 2019, and 
even fell out of the top 10 starting from August 2019 (Link).  
 
For the easier use of investors, we draw out the ranking, year-on-year and month-on-month growth of Luckin’s spending ever 
reported in CTR reports.

So where did the money go? Clues might be found from the similar amounts of overstated store-level profit and 
advertising expenses. 
 
Luckin claimed to have achieved “store-level profitable” in 2019 3Q. Combining Smoking Gun Evidence 1 to 3, Luckin actually 
hided store-level loss into below-store level, instead of really surpassing the breakeven point at store level. 
 
The real case in Luckin’s store level results are sales volume of 263 items per store per day sold at an ASP of RMB 9.97. 
Comparing the real case and the reported case, Luckin overstated its store-level operating profit by RMB 397 million in 2019 
3Q. Coincidentally, the difference between Luckin’s reported advertising expense and its actual spending on Focus Media 
tracked by CTR is RMB 336 million, similar to the overstated store-level operating profit. Moreover, both misstatements 
became evident from 2019 3Q. It’s possible that Luckin channeled its overstated advertising expense back to conduct the fraud 
in revenue and store-level profit.

Smoking Gun Evidence #5: Luckin’s revenue contribution from “other products” was only about 6% in 2019 3Q, 
representing a nearly 400% inflation, as shown by 25,843 customer receipts and its reported VAT numbers.  
 
Luckin’s ambition is never a coffee company. Its mission is to be “everyone’s everyday life, starting with coffee!” That makes 
“other products”, i.e. non-freshly brewed drinks, e.g. light meals, juices, nuts, mugs etc. an important offering – its revenue 
contribution was reported increased from 7% in 2018 2Q to 23% in 2019 3Q, and item contribution increased from 6% to 22% 
correspondingly.

However, for the 981 store-days we tracked, only 2% of the pick-up orders were found containing non-freshly brewed products. 
The 25,843 receipts further indicate that 4.9% and 17.5% of items for pick-up and delivery orders were “other products”, blended 
6.2%, i.e. inflated by nearly 400%. Again, people naturally tend to buy more “other products” for delivery orders to meet free 
shipping requirement. But if the delivery order % decreased dramatically from 62% in 2018 2Q to almost 10% now, how come “% 
of revenue from other products” increased from 7% to 23% in the same period?

Source: Luckin 2019 3Q earnings presentation 


 
Luckin’s VAT rate in the latest Form F-1 Filing also supported our findings: According to State Tax Administration of the PRC, 
the VAT rates for selling goods and services are different. For providing services, e.g. selling freshly brewed products, or delivery, 
the VAT rates are both subject to 6%. For selling goods, e.g. selling packaged food and beverages, i.e. “other products” here in 
Luckin’s case, the VAT rate is 13% since April 2019 (or 16% previously). This was further confirmed by the VAT invoices we
34 


collected after shopping at Luckin (see samples below). With Luckin’s revenue breakdown, we can calculate a blended VAT rate 
and compare to company reporting.  
 
Weighted average on net revenue contribution % by product category, we find that the calculated VAT perfectly matched reported 
case in 2018 4Q, full year 2018 and 2019 1Q (refer to the line chart below), prior to IPO.  
 
However, for 2019 2-3Q, the gap widened abruptly and sharply – reported VAT rate was 6.5% while calculated was 7.6%. 
From another perspective, to reconcile with 6.5% VAT as reported, the revenue contribution from other products would be 
actually 7%, which is very close to the 6.2% derived from 25,843 receipts, compared to company reported 22%-23%.  
 
In that case, either the actual revenue contribution from “other products” was 6%-7% in 2019 3Q or Luckin was committing a  
tax evasion.

To confirm other products are subject to a 13% VAT rate, we made some purchases at Luckin and requested VAT records. It clearly 
shows 13% VAT rate for nuts, muffin, juice etc., and 6% for freshly brewed drinks and delivery fee. Anyone who wants this 
information can require the VAT records through Luckin’s APP after purchase.

Red Flag #1: Luckin’s management has cashed out on 49% of their stock holdings (or 24% of total shares outstanding) 
through stock pledges, exposing investors to the risk of margin call induced price plunges 
 
Luckin’s management stresses that they have never sold a single share of the Company; however, they have already 
cashed out through stock pledge financing. The number of shares pledged is almost half of their total stakes and is worth 
~$2.5 billion at current price. 
 
Stock pledge financing is a common approach for management to get funding without selling stakes directly which is often seen 
as a negative sign by investors. However, at the same time it is also considered as one of the key red flags in company due 
diligence given that significant amount of stock pledge could create a negative loop resulting in instances of share price collapse. 
Management can pledge their securities as collateral for loans from banks and brokerages. When pledged shares fall in value, 
lenders demand that borrowers post more cash or collateral. If they can’t cough up the money, lenders can sell shares to recoup 
what they are owed, further depressing stock prices and prompting additional demands for collateral. There are numerous cases of 
stock plunge driven by share pledge financing across Hong Kong and mainland China (please refer to articles below).

In the case of Luckin, its management collectively pledged almost half of their shares, as collateral for loans (61 million ADS), 
representing 24% of Luckin’s total shares, even more than the total amount of public offering Luckin did in May 2019 IPO and 
Jan 2020 placement (51 million ADS). According to Luckin’s prospectus issued on Jan 8, 2020, Company Chairman Charles 
Zhengyao Lu, CEO Jenny Zhiya Qian, and Sunying Wong, sister of Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu, all pledged 30%, 47% and 
100% of their shares owned respectively. Sunying Wong was not disclosed as the sister of Charles Zhengyao Lu in Luckin’s 
prospectus but such relationship was disclosed in 2018 Annual Report of UCAR (神州优车, 838006 CH, a NEEQ3 listed 
company related to Chairman Lu). Luckin’s management in total cashed out almost half of their stakes through stock pledge and 
left rest investors with significant risk of stock collapse. The stock pledge detail is summarized in below table (please also refer to 
the exact information from the prospectus at the end of the section).

Red Flag #2: CAR (699 HK) déjà vu: Charles Zhengyao Lu and the same group of closely-connected private equity

Before Luckin, Charles Zhengyao Lu founded a Chinese auto rental company called China Auto Rental (CAR, 神州租车) in 
2007. CAR filed for NASDAQ listing but failed in 2012. It was successfully listed in HKEX (stock code 699 HK) in 2014 after 
introducing strategic investment from Hertz (NYSE: HRI US). Shareholding structure of CAR (699 HK) was Lenovo 29%, 
Warburg Pincus 18%, Hertz 16% and Charles Zhengyao Lu 15%. Luckin’s major private equity investors Centurium Capital and

Joy Capital’s founding partners, Erhai Liu and David Hui Li, led Lenovo and Warburg Pincus’ investment in CAR (699 HK) 
respectively. 
 
There was a short period of “honeymoon” between CAR (699 HK) and capital market after IPO. Share price surged from HK$8.5 
at IPO to HK$20.0 in May, 2015 before Charles Zhengyao Lu started to cash out. Instead of directly selling in the market, he sold 
all his shares to UCAR Technology (优车科技), which is a subsidiary of UCAR (838006 CH). As you can see from the name, 
UCAR (838006 CH) is just another company controlled by Charles Zhengyao Lu: Lu and his concerted parties held close to 50% 
shares of UCAR (838006 CH) in 2016 and still 40% today. Charles Zhengyao Lu cashed out HKD 3.4 billion at HK$9.2/share. In 
addition, CAR’s (699 HK) other pre-IPO investors, such as Hertz, Lenovo and Warburg Pincus, also sold significant amount of 
their shares during the same time. From Jun, 2015 to Mar, 2016, Charles Zhengyao Lu and other pre-IPO investors cashed 
out USD 1.6 billion after dumping 42% of CAR’s (699 HK) total shares to the market in just 9 months. 


 
CAR (699 HK) insiders’ shareholding movement

Given such material share dumping by insiders, it is not surprising to see CAR’s (699 HK) share price to plunge from 
HK$20/share peak in Jun, 2015 to <HK$8/share since Jun, 2016.  Remember, CAR’s (699 HK) IPO offer price was 
HK$8.5/share back in Sep, 2014, which means all the public investors took the loss. As comparison, Lenovo, Warburg Pincus and 
Hertz made USD 1.84 billion (cash out & remaining shareholding) vs. USD 485 million original investment, thus have seen 380% 
return. Don’t forget Chairman Lu cashed out another USD 434 million (HKD 3.4 billion) at infinite net return due to his close-to-
zero holding cost.

CAR (699 HK) historical share price vs. insider selling (Sep, 2014 – Jun, 2016) 
 


 
Source: Bloomberg, company filings 


 
After IPO in Sep, 2014, CAR (699 HK) reported nicely growing trend of profitability (adjusted net profit +59% in 2015) in first 
few quarters. Its financials started to decline since 2016 2Q after insider cashing out: adjusted net profit declined by 8% in 2016 
and another 25% in 2017. As Charles Zhengyao Lu and other pre-IPO investors walked away with USD 1.6 billion (not to 
mention USD 0.7 billion worth of remaining shares), public investors were left holding the bag.

In Jan, 2017, GeoInvesting published a short-selling report on CAR (699 HK) highlighting its “skyrocketing related party 
transactions” with UCAR (838006 CH), “questionable depreciation method” and “gloomy business outlook”. Link to the full 
report: https://geoinvesting.com/car-inc-0699-hk-heading-toward-cliff/. Latest share price of CAR (699 HK) is HK$5.3/share, 
37% lower vs. IPO offer price and >70% below historical peak in 2015.  
 
The echoing patterns of CAR (699 HK) resonate when looking at Luckin’s recent share price performance. CAR’s (699 HK) share 
price went up from HK$8.5 to HK$20 in the first 9 months after IPO, we see the same share price movement in Luckin. Luckin’s 
insiders are also the same as CAR (699 HK). Luckin’s major private equity investors Centurium Capital and Joy Capital’s 
founding partners David Hui Li and Erhai Liu actually led Warburg Pincus’ and Lenovo’s investment in CAR (699 HK) a few 
years ago, thus are “old friends” of Charles Zhengyao Lu. CAR’s (699 HK) pre-IPO investors started to cash out on May 28th, 
2015 via secondary offerings, 8 months after IPO and 2 months after lock-up expiration. As comparison, Centurium Capital 
cashed out USD 232 million on Jan 8th, 2020 amid Luckin’s convertible bond and equity offerings, which also happens to be 8 
months after Luckin’s IPO and 2 months after lock-up expiration.

Note: share price performance rebase to IPO date 
 
We see the familiar “golden triangle” of Charles Zhengyao Lu, David Hui Li and Erhai Liu again in Luckin. Together they 
hold 46% of total shares of Luckin, which is currently worth USD 5.8 billion. Given that “golden triangle” cashed out USD 1.1 
billion from CAR (699 HK), what will happen to Luckin is self-explanatory.

Note: Luckin shareholding post follow-on and CB offering on January 8th, 2020 
 
 
 
Red Flag #3: Through acquisition of Borgward, Luckin’s Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu transferred RMB 137 million 
from UCAR (838006 CH) to his related party, Baiyin Wang. UCAR, Borgward, and Baiyin Wang are on the hook to pay 
BAIC-Foton Motors RMB 5.95 billion over the next 12 months. Now Baiyin Wang owns a recently founded coffee machine 
vendor located next door to Luckin’s Headquarter 
 
There is another transaction about Charles Zhengyao Lu that’s worth noting. The transaction can be summarized as below: an 
individual called Baiyin Wang acquired a company in Jan, 2019 at RMB 3.97 billion, sold to UCAR (838006 CH) at RMB 4.11 
billion in Mar, 2019 and made RMB137 million profit in just two months. More interestingly, Baiyin Wang is Charles Zhengyao 
Lu’s related party, thus Charles Zhengyao Lu effectively transferred RMB 137 million from UCAR’s (838006 CH) public 
shareholders to his related party. 
 
Founded in 1919, Borgward was once Top 4 German carmaker (the other three being Volkswagen, Benz and Opel) but went 
bankrupt in 1963. In 2014, BAIC-Foton Motors (北汽福田, 600166 CH) acquired 100% shares of Borgward (“Beijing Borgward 
Automobile Co., Ltd” 北京宝沃汽车有限公司) with EUR 5 million in 2014 and tried to re-introduce the legacy German auto 
brand into China market. After several years of unsuccessful operations, BAIC-Foton Motors announced plan to sell 67% shares 
of Borgward in Oct, 2018 via public listing in China Beijing Equity Exchange (“北京产权交易所”). On Jan 15th, 2019, BAIC-
Foton announced that the 67% shares of Borgward was sold to a company called “Changshengxingye” (“长盛兴业”，长盛兴业
（厦门）企业管理咨询有限公司) at RMB 3.97 billion. As shown in BAIC-Foton’s announcement dated on Jan 16th, 2019 
(600166 CH Filing No. 临 2019-003), “Changshengxingye” was a shell company founded in Dec 3rd, 2018 specifically for this 
transaction and controlling shareholder and legal person is Baiyin Wang.

On Mar 18th, 2019, UCAR (838006 CH), of which Charles Zhengyao Lu is largest and controlling shareholder, announced plan to 
acquire 67% shares of Beijing Borgward from “Changshengxingye” at RMB 4.11 billion, only two months after BAIC-Foton 
sold the same asset to “Changshengxingye”. Transaction details see UCAR (838006 CH) announcement (File No. 2019-34).

In other words, “Changshengxingye” made RMB 137 million profit in just two months by acquiring 67% of Borgward and 
quickly reselling to UCAR (838006 CH).  
 
In Dec 26th, 2018, 3 weeks before Changshengyingye’s acquisition of Borgward, UCAR (838006 CH) provided credit guarantee 
for BAIC-Foton’s RMB 2.4 billion shareholder loan to Beijing Borgward and explicitly said the guarantee was to “facilitate 
Changshengxingye’s acquisition of target assets (i.e. Beijing Borgward)”. In other words, UCAR (838006 CH) was not only 
aware of Changshengxingye’s intention to acquire Borgward in the first place, but also helped to facilitate such transaction by 
providing RMB 2.4 billion credit guarantee.

In short, UCAR (838006 CH) supported Changshengxingye to acquire Borgward and then overpaid RMB 137 million to 
Changshengxingye (controlled by Baiyin Wang) for the same asset after two months. It has been “public secret” that Baiyin Wang 
and Charles Zhengyao Lu maintain very close personal relationship (media article: 陆正耀『神州往事』：命中贵人刘二海，
与王百因是同窗 http://www.cheyun.com/content/25580). Baiyin Wang and Charles Zhengyao Lu were EMBA classmates from 
2006 to 2008 in National School of Development at Peking University (北京大学国家发展研究院). Baiyin Wang involved in a 
healthcare business after graduation and didn’t have any prior experience in automobile industry before acquiring Borgward. As a 
result, the “BAIC-Foton to Changshengyingye to UCAR” transaction structure seems to favor Charles Zhengyao Lu 
personally rather than UCAR’s (838006 CH) public shareholders, since it effectively transfers RMB 137 million cash from 
UCAR (838006 CH) to his undisclosed related party, Baiyin Wang.  
 
Furthermore, we see alarming signal that UCAR (838006 CH) may face material cash flow pressure after acquisition of 
Borgward. Regarding Changshengxingye’s acquisition of Borgward, payment to BAIC-Foton was due in full by Jan 15th, 2020. 
However, BAIC-Foton announced on Jan 18th, 2020 that RMB 1.48 billion payment was unpaid and overdue. In other words, 
Changshengxingye only paid RMB 2.49 billion to BAIC-Foton for acquisition of Borgward and effectively defaults on the 
rest RMB 1.48 billion payment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 


UCAR (838006 CH) provides no more than RMB 2.4 billion credit guarantee to BAIC-Foton’s 
shareholder loan to Borgward in order to facilitate Changshengxingye’s acquisition of the target

In addition, BAIC-Foton has another RMB 4.67 billion outstanding shareholder loan to Borgward, of which RMB 1.88 
billion will mature by Jul, 2020 and RMB 2.59 billion by Jan, 2021. RMB 2.4 billion of such shareholder loan is guaranteed by 
UCAR (838006 CH), as mentioned. Adding the RMB 1.48 billion overdue acquisition payment, Changshengxingye and 
Borgward are facing RMB 5.95 billion cash outflow in next 12 months, signaling significant cash flow pressure.  
 
Changshengxingye is an undisclosed related party of Charles Zhengyao Lu to bridge UCAR’s (838006 CH) acquisition of 
Borgward, thus its payment default and cash flow pressure trace back to UCAR (838006 CH). In 1H19 interim filings, UCAR 
(838006 CH) disclosed that Borgward was already transferred to the company on Jul 29th, 2019.

However, there is no further disclosure from UCAR (838006 CH) after this. UCAR (838006 CH) hasn’t published 2019 3Q 
financial report till now, despite almost 4 months after quarter end. As comparison, it published 2018 3Q report on Oct 31st, 
2018.  
 
In addition, UCAR (838006 CH) only has RMB 758 million cash balance on hand vs. RMB 2.6 billion total debt as of Jun 30th, 
2019 (i.e. net debt RMB 1.9 billion). The company also reported RMB 1.9 billion revenue, -49% Y/Y, and RMB 653 million net 
loss in 1H19, with only RMB 306 million operating cash inflow. While Borgward itself is a loss-making business (RMB 2.545 
billion net loss in 2018), UCAR (838006 CH) may need significant amount of external financing for the RMB 5.95 billion 
repayment to BAIC-Foton in next 12 months, not to mention support Borgward’s business development.

UCAR (838006 CH) currently is largest shareholder of CAR (699 HK) after Charles Zhengyao Lu’s cash-out in Mar, 2016. 
However, the company has pledged RMB 3.89 billion worth of CAR’s (699 HK) shares for financing, as shown in 1H19 interim 
report. UCAR (838006 CH) owns 631 million shares, or 29.77% of CAR’s (699 HK) total. Market value of such shares was HKD 
3.9 billion based on CAR’s (699 HK) HKD 6.18 share price on Jun 28th, 2019. In other words, UCAR (838006 CH) already 
pledged almost 100% of its shareholding in CAR (699 HK) in 1H19, echoing Red Flag #1.

Zhengzhe is not a standalone case. There is another company called Zhongcheng Century Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. 
(“Zhongcheng” 中成世纪供应链管理有限公司). The company was founded on Dec 3rd, 2019 while Baiyin Wang was briefly 
legal person on Dec 13th, 2019 (later transferred to Yanlin Liu). While Zhengzhe is located in next building of Luckin Xiamen, 
Zhongcheng is literally located in the same building and same unit as Luckin Xiamen Headquarter. It is not surprising that

In conclusion, Baiyin Wang set up multiple companies to supply coffee machine and food raw materials, which 
“coincidentally” locate next door to Luckin Headquarter. Investors should be cautious with respect to the potential dealings 
and the associated risks between these companies and Luckin. 
 
 
 
Red Flag #4: Luckin recently raised USD 865 million through a follow-on offering and a convertible bond offering to 
develop its “unmanned retail” strategy, which is more likely a convenient way for management to siphon large amount of 
cash from the company  
 
In early January 2020 and barely 8 months after going public, Luckin raised another USD 865 million net new capital despite 
having RMB 5.5 billion cash on balance sheet. According to the various investor meetings/calls, the company is aiming to 
install two types of “unmanned retail” machines, 10k Luckin coffee EXPRESS machines and 100k Luckin pop MINI machines by 
2021.

Essentially these products are vending machines. Management indicated that coffee EXPRESS costs RMB 120k each and pop 
MINI costs RMB 15k each. The plan is to direct Luckin’s online traffic to these vending machines and management is expecting 
even better profitability than its offline stores due to lower costs. Average selling price of the coffee is estimated to be at RMB 16 
per cup, cost per cup can be as low as RMB 6 per cup (assuming 80-100 cups sold a day) and the payback period is estimated to 
be at only 6 to 12 months.

These assumptions are way too optimistic. The existing stores are only selling at an average price of RMB 10.9 per cup according 
to our receipt evidence, it’s unfathomable why customers are willing to pay 47% more for a product a vending machine product. 
For the coffee EXPRESS to generate any meaningful volume, the product must be priced at a discount, not a significant premium. 
In addition, for a RMB 120k machine to have a 6 to 12 months pay-back, we calculate each machine needs to sell 122 to 220 cups 
of coffee per day with an average selling price of RMB 9 per cup.  
 
However, Luckin’s competitors have already installed plenty of coffee vending machines and ran into significant growth 
bottleneck despite selling coffee at a much cheaper price. According to the marketing material of YOUKAFFEE (“友咖啡”), an 
existing operator of coffee vending machines, it has installed 2k machines with 770 in Beijing, 230 in Shenzhen, 180 in 
Guangzhou, 120 in Shanghai and 120 in Tianjin. The average daily volume per machine per day was only 6.5 cups with average 
selling price of about RMB 8. The other two leading operators also average single digit cups per day with similar average selling 
price. The machines of these operators only cost RMB 20k-30k, much lower than Luckin. 
 
If coffee EXPRESS is going to be as successful as the management claims, Luckin’s competitors can simply set up a machine at 
the same location. Even worse, these vending machine competitors are already aiming to cannibalize Luckin’s offline stores. They 
plan to populate 20 vending machines surrounding each of Luckin’s high traffic store and attack the company’s customer base 
through low price competition.  
 
The broader “unmanned retail” market had also already seen waves of startups going bust over the past 2-3 years. It used to be a 
popular concept in China venture capital industry, but the actual performances of unmanned retail startups were quite poor. 
Unmanned retailers need to invest heavily in equipment and inventory and still rely on workers to complete product supply and 
machine cleaning/maintenance, so they are not necessarily cost-effective. Competition from existing convenient stores and limited 
SKU has pressured the traffic growth of unmanned retail sites. Even JD.com, the deep pocketed ecommerce giant with huge 
online traffic, pulled out from the unmanned retail container business at the end of 2018.

While enamored sell-side analysts are busy slapping an instantaneous US$13.2/ADS value creation based on the announcement of 
the “unmanned retail” aka vending machine strategy alone, we caution investors that this new business can be a perfect way 
for management to siphon large amount of cash from the company. As pointed out in Red Flag #3 above, Charles Zhengyao 
Lu previously transferred RMB 137 million out from UCAR Inc. through transacting with an undisclosed related party, Baiyin 
Wang. Baiyin Wang, on the other hand, now owns a coffee machine supplier that was just established in August 2019. 
Investors should pay attention to this “coincidence” and be extremely alert given the significant capital expenditure plan (RMB 
2.7 billion over the next 2 years) on coffee/vending machines and the much higher than market machine costs.

Credit Suisse Valuation of Luckin’s Unmanned Retail Business 


 
Source: Credit Suisse “Luckin Coffee Spinning up the flywheel” dated January 15th, 2020 


 
In Luckin’s “unmanned retail” strategy press conference, CEO Jenny Zhiya Qian mentioned that “there is no upper limit of 
vending machine expansion target this year, the more the better”5. The “unlimited” expansion plan of the coffee vending machine 
is the perfect way to move “unlimited” money from the company to 3rd party vendor. We would suggest E&Y to audit the 
machine supplier closely, especially check for connected party transactions. 
 
 
 
Red Flag #5: Luckin’s independent board member, Sean Shao, is/was on the board of some very questionable Chinese 
companies listed in the US that have incurred significant losses on their public investors 
 
According to Luckin’s prospectus, its independent board member, Sean Shao, has served on the board for multiple US-listed 
Chinese companies after working at Deloitte for a decade. We examined these companies in detail and found that out of the 18 
companies that Sean Shao has served on the board, 4 have been accused of being frauds (CHME, ADY, GRO and YONG) and 5 
were reverse mergers - which were infamous for generating droves of Chinese fraudulent companies back in 2011-2012.  
 


List of Companies Sean Shao Board Memberships and Senior Management Positions

SEC recently charged Agria Corporation (GRO) and Executive Chairman with fraud, where SEC identified multiple 
fraudulent activities between 2010 and 2013. Sean Shao, on the other hand, had been a long-standing independent director of 
Agria Corporation and served as the chairman of various board committees, including corporate governance, from 2008 
to 2017.

Sean Shao’s Involvement in Agria Corporation 


 
Source: Luckin F1 prospectus dated January 8th, 2020, page 148 


 
Almost all companies Sean Shao has been involved in have lost public investors significant amount of money. 9 out of these 
18 companies had lost more than 50% since being listed and 8 were near wipe-outs. On average, these stocks have lost 
66% value compared to their peak market capitalizations. We understand that business trends change, and stock price goes up 
and down, but to have such a long track record and such a high hit rate of being involved with poor performing companies is 
suspicious at the very least.  
 
China Biologic Products Holdings (CBPO) is the exception to the rule - however, it’s worth-noting that the company was also 
invested by David Hui Li first through Warburg Pincus and then again after he started his own PE fund Centurium Capital, which 
is leading a deal to take the company private. Centurium Capital is also the largest non-management shareholder of Luckin, 
currently with 18.1 million ADS (or 7.1% of the company) after selling down 5.5 million ADS in the company’s recent follow-on 
offering in January 2020. As indicated in Red Flag #2 above, David Hui Li also directed Warburg Pincus’s investment into 
Charles Zhengyao Lu’s last public company CAR (699 HK) and was CAR’s second largest shareholder (after Lenovo) at its IPO. 
It appears that the company’s management, key private investor, and independent board member have worked closely together for 
a long time.  
 
Another interesting datapoint is that 10 out of the 18 companies disclosed in their latest annual reports that their internal control 
was not effective, mostly due to material weakness.

Summary of Internal Control Effectiveness as Reported in Annual Reports

Red Flag #6: Luckin co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer, Fei Yang, was once sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment 
for crime of illegal business operations when he was the co-founder and general manager of Beijing Koubei Interactive 
Marketing & Planning Co.,Ltd. (“iWOM”). Afterwards, iWOM became a related party with Beijing QWOM Technology 
Co., Ltd. (“QWOM”), which is now an affiliate of CAR and is doing related party transactions with Luckin  
 
Fei Yang is the co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer of Luckin, who architected the user growth model. He was also the CMO 
of UCAR (838006 CH), an affiliate of Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu until the establishment of Luckin.  In 2013, as co-founder 
and general manager of iWOM (北京口碑互动营销策划有限公司), Fei Yang was caught and later sentenced to 18 months jail 
time6 as he was compensated to delete negative online reviews for his clients, an illegal business in China. According to the 
detailed reporting of CaiXin7, whitewash of negative reviews is a major business of iWOM. Under Fei Yang’s leadership, iWOM 
bribed owners or editors of online forums/websites to delete negative reviews related to his clients. It also offered services to post 
and popularize positive reviews for falsifying positive brand images. Depending on difficulties of each request, iWOM charged in 
a range of RMB 200-3,000. Fei Yang co-founded this business in Jul 2007 with only a few people and limited capital but in 6 
years time, it expanded into a several hundred people team with RMB 70 million revenue at 50%+ CAGR. On Oct 17, 2013, Fei 
Yang and iWOM was caught by police. Another fact for consideration is that Fei Yang was supposed to stay in jail until Apr 
16 2015 according to news8 but became UCAR’s CMO in Mar 2015, 1 months earlier than his release date.

Part Two: The Fundamentally Broken Business 
 


Before 3rd Quarter, 2019
67 


Business Model Flaw #1: Luckin’s proposition to target core functional coffee demand is wrong: China’s caffeine intake 
level of 86mg/day per capita is comparable to other Asian countries already, with 95% of the intake from tea. The market 
of core functional coffee product in China is small and moderately growing in China. 
 
Different from the market leader Starbucks, Luckin’s management only focuses on catering to functional demand of Chinese 
consumers, i.e. caffeine in-take, but fails to recognize that China is a “stubborn tea drinking” society - such caffeine needs 
have already been fulfilled by tea products. Luckin CEO Jenny Zhiya Qian indicated during Luckin 2019 Global Partners 
Conference11 that, coffee is a very healthy functional beverage to keep people awake and energized… Chinese young people have 
strong needs to drink coffee for caffeine intake… Luckin’s core value proposition is to offer a coffee product that’s more 
attractively priced, more easily accessible, with comparable quality, by eliminating the price premium in Starbucks’ business 
model. It is true that caffeine demand is real in China and coffee’s consumption level is still low compared to international peers. 
However, coffee’s functional demand is likely a niche market given Chinese consumers’ caffeine intake has already been 
met with tea.  
 
As shown in below chart, post joining WTO at the end of 2001, China witnessed accelerated growth in tea consumption per 
capita. Coffee consumption per capita also experienced decent growth but absolute level remains low.

(JP, South Korea, India and Taiwan). Tea consumption data is from FAO

World Bank 
 
Most crucially, tea represents 95%+ of caffeine intake in China on caffeine consumption per capita basis and China’s total 
caffeine consumption per capita at 86mg/day is comparable to Korea, a coffee caffeine dominated developed country in 
Asia. Taking 60% urbanization rate into account, the urban consumption per capita could have topped 140mg already, comparable 
to levels in Japan. Another “stubborn tea drinking” society, India, also shows a similar level. There is very limited room to create 
additional caffeine needs for coffee consumption.

Daily Caffeine (Coffee +Tea) Intake per capita per day 


 
Note: According to Caffeine informer, 1g of dry green tea contains 10-20mg caffeine (assuming 15mg). 1g of dry black tea 
contains caffeine 22-28mg (assuming 25mg). 12oz Cola contains 34mg caffeine. 15g coffee beans contains 150mg caffeine

Global coffee consumption per capita comparison across countries also indicates that coffee consumption per capita level is 
primarily driven by culture rather than economic development. China’s coffee bean consumption per capita is not only 
significantly behind developed countries such as Japan and Korea but also way lower than developing countries such as Vietnam, 
Indonesia and Laos. According to United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) data, global coffee consumption is mostly 
concentrated in Western countries and former colonies of Western countries – EU, the US and Brazil, representing 28%, 
16% and 14%, respectively. Within developing countries in Asia, more Westernized developing countries such as Vietnam 
(former colony of France) and Philippines (former colony of Spain and the US) have high coffee consumptions. By contrast, in the 
countries with strong tea cultures, such as China, India and Sri Lanka, the coffee consumptions are low.

Furthermore, it’s unlikely that coffee will play a greater role in Chinese consumers’ caffeine consumption in the future given that: 
 


• Overall coffee bean consumption growth has slowed down to 3-4% CAGR only in recent years: data from USDA and 
ICO shows that the growth of coffee consumption per capita in China has slowed down to only ~3-4% CAGR in 
recent years.

• Divergent store coverage and growth between freshly brewed tea vs. coffee: according to a report from Meituan (HKEX 


listed: 3690 HK, USD 72 billion market cap, the largest food delivery and local service platform in China), there are 
~410,000 freshly brewed tea stores in China, 4 times of the number of freshly brewed coffee stores by 2018 3Q. In 
terms of growth rate, the number of tea stores demonstrated a continuous growth trend while number of freshly brewed 
coffee stores declined from 121,000 stores by 2016 3Q to 105,000 stores by 2018 3Q. Hence, the coffee supply 
network coverage is not the issue, there is just not enough demand.

In contrast with Luckin, Starbucks China clearly knows that caffeine functional demand of coffee is not large enough. After doing 
business in China for 20 years, Starbucks understands that in most of Chinese consumers’ mind, “grabbing a coffee” means more 
than meeting the caffeine intake demand, but more importantly, finding a place to hang out. Chinese consumers often prefer sweet 
drinks such as flavored latte or Frappuccino over coffee. Coffee industry veterans in China summarized Chinese consumers’ 
demand for coffee shops into 5 categories per our research:  
 


A. Space: coffee shops offer space for meeting, work or relaxation, similar to the “3rd space” concept introduced by 
Starbucks – a place outside the home and work that people can gather and build a sense of community 


B. Style: stylish coffee shops, such as Starbucks, especially Starbucks Reserve, % Arabica or boutique coffee shops in the 
eyes of Chinese consumers. Starbucks not only has the most valuable coffee brand name in China, but it is also perceived 
as a premium brand in China, representing a lifestyle people are longing for 


C. Beverage: drinking coffee as beverage and can be replaced by tea or juices. This type of consumers often favors Mocha 
or flavored coffee with milk or syrup 


D. Functional use: people drink coffee for caffeine to stay awake for study or work; they often become addicted  
E. Coffee lover: the ones truly enjoy the tastes of a variety of coffees and normally hold high standard in the quality of 


coffee - this is the smallest portion of coffee consumers in China based on research

Starbucks China knows that the coffee shop business demand across categories A-C are way larger than category D, which Luckin 
focuses on. Therefore, Starbucks China is willing to pay high rent and renovation expenses for space and style. What Chinese 
consumers are happy to pay for essentially is a stylish place serving beverages/food for meetings or leisure, not for the coffee 
itself. Operations of Starbucks in China further prove this point: 
 


• Majority of consumption is not coffee: coffee only represents 40-45% of total sales (70%+ of Starbucks China’s sales 
comes from drinks and within drinks, coffee represents 59% of total drinks) according to Starbucks’s to disclosure on its 
China Investor Day. Mocha, Latte are the most popular ones within coffee. The functional ones such as 
Americano/expresso are the minority. The remainder of drinks are tea, Frappuccino and other beverages 


• Only 10% of Starbucks revenue is contributed by functional demand category D: Starbucks members contribute 50% of 
total revenue and functional users only represent 20% of members’ revenue based on industry research  


• Divergent revenue mix by time during the day in China vs. the US: the strongest functional needs are normally in the 
morning and breakfast represents 50%+ of revenue in the US. However, in China breakfast only represents 16% of 
Starbucks revenue (24% for lunch, 30% in the afternoon, 31% in the evening) according to disclosure on Starbucks’ 
China Investor Day 


• Shopping mall location dominated: coffee shops located in office buildings are more to fulfill functional use of working 
professionals while coffee shops located in shopping malls are more to fulfill space, style or leisure beverage needs. Per 
management disclosure, 70-80% of Starbucks China’s stores are in shopping malls and its office location stores are 
mostly in tier 1 cities core commercial areas such as CBD in Beijing or Lujiazui in Shanghai 


• Majority of customers choose to dine in: Luckin often claimed that 70% of Starbucks’ orders in China are take-out 
orders. Such data is biased. Per research, Starbucks counters normally set orders as take-out status by default and only 
when a customer demands a mug rather than a paper cup, the order would be switched to dine in. Paper cup usage is 
close to 70% indeed. However, paper cups are often used for dine-in purpose too. Take-out orders should only represent 
30-40% of total orders, and real take-out number should be even lower given the high occupancy rates of the stores

As the first mover in China, Starbucks has built the most extensive prime location store network, offering premium coffee 
experience across store decoration, services and product quality. Such consistent performance in the past 20 years empowers 
Starbucks to establish an unmatched premium brand with a unique business model – it secures lower than market rate 
rent with long term leases at prime locations and carves out spaces for consumers, charging “rent” by selling them 
premium priced coffee. In other words, Starbucks is a successful “coffee WeWork”. It’s not surprising that Starbucks is the only 
coffee chain achieving a decent profitability in China. All the competitors, including Costa Coffee, Pacific Coffee and Korean 
players, find it very difficult to replicate Starbucks’ success built on 20 years of brand value and accumulated store portfolio, and
71 


are struggling to turn profitable in China. On the other hand, Luckin chooses to completely go a different direction, and focuses on 
the coffee functional demand that happens to be only a niche market in China. 
 
In the table below, we list out the key differences in business model and culture between Starbucks and Luckin to help illustrate. 
 


 Starbucks Luckin 
Store level: customer 
experience 


Introduced the “expresso bar” experience to the US; 
Provide “3rd Space” for consumers, offering a 
combination of the best coffee, the best service and 
the best atmosphere  
 


Only focuses on coffee itself, deems 
store space and service as unnecessary 
Only emphasizes “good coffee” 


Store level: staff Staff is Starbucks’ the most important asset and core 
competency. The concept of a good coffee shop 
experience and the Starbucks brand are built upon the 
bond between “partners” and customers  
 


Luckin’s stores are purely production 
centers. Uses systems to reduce on-site 
staff involvement as much as possible  


Brand Empower Starbucks brand to be associated with 
“Knowledge”, “Experience” and “Culture” 
Make “Starbucks” a style.  
 


Minimize brand premium. 


Marketing  Marketing expense as percentage of revenue below 
1%; 
Product, service and value are the drivers of the brand 
 


Aggressive marketing campaign for new 
customers acquisition: celebrity brand 
representative, outdoor brand 
advertising and performance-based ads 
 


Store level: location Prime locations with strong traffic 
Location is the key for retail industry  
 


Relies on online traffic; stores located in 
non-prime locations to save rent 


Store level: fit-out Store image is an essential part of the brand image Simple fit-out to serve pick-up 
customers and delivery orders 
 


Promotions Price discount is a sales driver; premium pricing in 
most cases  
 


All about discounts and coupons 


Product R&D Marketing department oversees product R&D: 
consumer demand driven; 
Diversified product portfolios, catering to a wider 
customer base 
 


Supply chain department in charge of 
product R&D: top-down, cost-driven 
approach; simplifies product portfolio 


Views on expansion If expanding for the sake of scale is defined as 
success, it will eventually fail. 


Benchmarks on Starbucks’ # of stores in 
China. Deems scale as the prerequisite 
of a successful business model 
 


Views on franchising Refused franchise model in the brand-building stage; 
doesn’t want to lose the key connection to the 
customers: the store. 


New brand Luckin Tea runs franchise 
model; Luckin Coffee also started 
franchising in September 2019, less than 
2 years since establishment 
 


Non-core products Brand value would be jeopardized if every random 
product is labeled with Starbucks 


Starting to expand from cups to 
fashionable items

Business Model Flaw #2: Luckin’s customers are highly price sensitive and retention is driven by generous price 
promotion; Luckin’s attempt to decrease discount level (i.e. raise effective price) and increase same store sales at the same 
time is mission impossible

Market sizing aside, we do recognize Luckin’s success in giving away 20.5 million13 cups of coffee per month at zero or low price 
by burning significant amount of cash and opening 4.5k stores in 2 years. Through 2019 2Q, it had incurred RMB 2.9 billion net 
loss to amass 22.8 million cumulative transacting customers in just 6 quarters. It had perfected the art of user referral on Wechat: 
referring a new customer will generate a free cup for both the new AND the existing customers; sharing a link on Wechat moment 
or a Wechat group will generate 20 randomly formed discount coupons ranging from 82% off to 32% off for other customers to 
lucky draw. 
 
Chinese observers are so amazed by the persistently large and ever-present discounts, as well as Luckin’s unending appetite to 
expand and stomach more losses, that they are naming Luckin the “real badass nationalistic company”14, due to its business 
model of raising capital from foreign investors to subsidize Chinese consumers. 
 
Unfortunately, the free-coffee-plus-coupon-focused customer acquisition strategy results in a customer base that’s highly price 
sensitive. We demonstrate below that both retention rate and transaction value are driven by product discount level.  
 
Cohort analysis clearly demonstrates that 1). Luckin’s new customers had progressively lower retention rates and worse quality 
than the early adopters, and 2). retention rates across cohorts are driven by level of discount rather than customer vintage. Luckin 
divided its users into cohorts according to which month they first bought Luckin’s products and compared the retention rate of 
different cohorts, summarized in the chart15 below. 


 
Luckin retention rate by cohort (in month through lifecycle)

Luckin’s new customer retention rate universally drops to 35% or below by M1 (2nd month after becoming Luckin’s transacting 
customer), and M1 retention rate is usually one of the highest in the cohort’s lifecycle. Regardless of cohort vintage, over 2/3 of 
each cohort will stay inactive throughout the cohort’s lifecycle, meaning they were only attracted to Luckin by the free cup 
of coffee and did not come back. 
 
In terms of quarterly behavior, 2018 1Q cohort had relatively high quality, and their retention rate after one year of use was 
30%~35%. From 2018 2Q to 4Q, the quality of new users had been declining, and their retention rates range between 25%~30% or 
even 20%~25%. 2019 1Q and 2Q cohorts M1 retention rates recovered somewhat, but quickly plunge to 20%-25% or below within 
the first several months. 





 
13 Calculated using (the real case 263 items per store per day) X (65% coffee as reported for first half 2019) X (2019 4Q average number of 
stores 4.0k) X (30 days) = 20.5 million cups of coffee per month 
14 https://tech.sina.com.cn/csj/2019-05-22/doc-ihvhiqay0501098.shtml  
15 Only cohorts till May 2019 were included, because we have shown before that the company had started overstating numbers in 2019 3Q; June 
2019 cohort’s “M1” is July 2019 so it was excluded as well.

To conclude, Luckin routinely lost majority of its new customers after they consumed their first cup for free; its earliest 
customers are also its high-quality core customers, and as the number of customers grow, the % of non-core customers grew 
significantly. 
 
We then group the cohort behaviors by calendar month in the chart below to show how active all the cohorts are in a specific 
calendar month. The below chart clearly shows that aside from the 1st month after becoming a new customer, Luckin’s all cohorts 
had behaved the same way from calendar month to calendar month. 
 
The retention rate went down gradually in the first half of 2018 and hit the bottom in July-August 2018. From August 2018, the 
retention rates started to rebound through second half of 2018 to December. 2019 1Q retention rates stayed high (Feb 2019 was 
abnormally low because of Chinese New Year and Luckin targets office demand). 2019 2Q saw significant decline into June 
2019, when most cohorts recorded the lowest monthly retention rates since December 2018.

We derive its level of discounts16 from the company’s filings and presentations. It had increased the level of discounts throughout 
2018 to 2019 1Q but attempted to decrease the discount level in 2019 2Q, directly corresponds to the retention rate trend above. 
Thus, change of retention rate of each cohort was much more correlated to the level of discounts in each calendar month 
than the vintage of the cohort: the higher the discounts, the higher the retention, and vice versa.

Luckin also discloses transaction value (based on listed price instead of effective selling price) per customer cohort. We group the 
cohort behaviors by calendar month to see how transaction value of each cohort changes. The company’s customer cohort transaction 
value displays similar pattern to retention rate above. First, all cohorts had behaved the same way from calendar month to 
calendar month; secondly, while the cohorts move in the same direction, newer/more recent cohorts significantly underperform 


 
16 The company’s quarterly earnings material discloses average effective selling price and no. of items sold in quarter, both including free coffee 
items. We adjusted these numbers by excluding the number of free coffee (which is also disclosed by the company) to better gauge the price 
sensitivity of transacting customers.

older cohorts in the same month. Finally, transaction value, calculated on list price, grew sequentially from 2018 2Q to 3Q to 
4Q as company increased the level of discounts.

It’s worth-noting that 2019 2Q transaction values were higher sequentially, especially for the older cohort customers. This is partially 
due to a special 10-week promotion of “7 products to split a cash pool of RMB 5 million per week”. The promotion ran from March 
11th to May 19th, and on average about 150k customers achieved the 7 products purchased per week. The average monthly items 
purchased was only 4.5 items for each transacting customer in 2019 2Q (27.6 monthly items transacted, and 6.2 mm monthly 
transacting customers as disclosed by management). Another possible contributing factor is that Luckin launched a major new 
product category, Luckin Tea, in 2019 2Q, with trials in Beijing/Shanghai in April and nationwide-launch in May. Separately, we 
will discuss the positioning and competitiveness of the tea product in Flaw 4 later. 
 
The number of items purchased per month by Luckin’s existing transacting customers have decreased. 
 
Based on disclosed numbers, we also calculate the monthly average number of items purchased by existing customers, after 
excluding the number of items purchased by new customers. As indicated above, a large percentage of new customers are 
attracted to Luckin due to the free cup, after which they become inactive. As a result, we estimate that the number of items 
purchased by new transacting customers average around 2.3/month/transacting customer, much lower than the average in the next 
month and afterwards.

The percentage of new customers as total transacting customers decreases as Luckin scales, resulting in higher overall monthly 
average items purchased per transacting customer. If we exclude the impact of new customers, the number of items purchased per 
month by Luckin’s existing transacting customers had peaked in 2018 3Q at 6.2, and then steadily declined to 5.5 in 2019 2Q 
(2019 1Q was abnormally low due to Chinese New Year in February). 
 
The decrease in items purchased per transacting customer corresponds to the price discount table discussed above: the boost on 
customers’ spending from higher discount levels peaked in 3Q and 4Q 2018, when effective price quickly dropped from 63% of 
listed price in 2Q to 49% in 4Q. As the intensity of discount eased into 2019 2Q, Luckin customers are also purchasing less 
items per month.

Luckin items purchased per month by transacting customers: all vs existing (excluding new)

The receipts we have recently gathered for company’s fraud investigation serves as another evidence. Theoretically in cities 
where Luckin has been operating the longest, the brand should have accumulated more loyal customers who are willing to buy 
Luckin’s products with less discount (which is what the management has been aiming for and telling the investors about). In 
newer cities where Luckin needs to spend aggressively to “educate” consumers, the discount levels are higher. However, the 
actual receipts show minimal correlation between the level of discount and the city’s operating history.

It’s not surprising that Luckin’s customer base is benchmarking its spending primarily to the level of discount. In fact, the 
company has been laser-focused on using coupons/discounts as the main customer acquisition and operation strategy. Luckin 
customers are groomed from Day 1 to interact with Luckin through coupons/free coffee instead of 
people/style/service/culture.  They are trained to identify Luckin with discounts.  
 
First, no purchases are done without a coupon or a discount. Even the management publicly indicated that 67% should be the 
long-term discount rate for all products. Luckin has a plethora of coupons in both its APP and on Wechat: top-up coupons (buy 5 
get 10, buy 2 get 3, etc.), coupons generated from sharing links, half-off coupons in Wechat official accounts, coupons for 
customers not active for a week, coupons for customers not active for a month, and other non-coffee product coupons after 
purchasing coffee. Despite calling itself an internet company, Luckin’s APP is comparatively plain and simple; it doesn’t have any 
of the usual user engagement functions such as small games, sign-in awards, and flash sales etc. 
 
Secondly, to reduce operating cost, Luckin has adopted the strategy to minimize human participation from all angles, including 
service. Its coffee machines are fully automatic: barista just need to press a button to make coffee. Store level employees are not 
required or incentivized to interact with customers unless they have to. Orders are placed online, and pick-up can be done by 
customers themselves through QR codes.

Starbucks, on the other hand, indicates that its key assets are the baristas, as the connection built between the baristas and 
consumers is a core competitive advantage. It calls baristas “partners” and pays higher than industry average for both full-time and 
part-time employees. The company also strives to instill the company’s culture and philosophy into its “partners” and then 
through the partners onto its customers. 
 
Thirdly, Luckin’s store decoration is also minimal and modularized: it aims to satisfy delivery and pick-up demands with no/few 
seats. From our research, capital expenditure averages about RMB 450k per store, budgeting about RMB 1k-2k/sqm for store-
front fit-out versus standard F&B service industry at 4k-6k/sqm. Fit-out period takes only 3 days and store can be open 2 weeks 
from rental contract signing, versus Starbucks/Costa at 3 months. Because of the core strategy, Luckin needs to cut expenses to 
the bone and offers customers nothing more than the discounted products. 
 
Our consumer survey shows exactly that: existing and potential customers’ perception of the Luckin brand highly associates 
with low price. In fact, the top 3 impressions on Luckin are 1. the abundance of discount coupons, 2. cost effective, and 3. 
low price. The perception is stronger for current Luckin customers who plan to remain a customer. Quality, convenience, and 
association to white-collar all rank low on the other hand.

Worse still, Luckin pushes its coupon-centric operation model so far that it completes turns the table on its best customers: a 
normal, sensible business usually has a membership program to reward loyal customers, while Luckin’s “dynamic 
pricing” discriminates against them.  
 
Starbucks has 9.1 million active members and they contribute 50% of Starbucks revenue. Since December 2018, it’s free to 
register as a Starbucks member and get rated into three different levels according to accumulated consumption dollars. As shown 
below, the higher the level, the more benefits/coupons the member enjoys. The company uses the membership program to 
improve stickiness and promote loyalty.

Starbucks Membership Benefits

On the other hand, Luckin doesn’t have a membership program or point system. Customers don’t get anything extra from 
spending more or consuming more frequently. On the contrary, customers who consume less get bigger discounts. Luckin runs 
a user retention program that sends large discount coupons to customers that haven’t made a purchase for a week. The discounts 
get progressively larger up to 82% off if the customer hasn’t ordered for a month.  
 
This coupon structure also ties nicely with the high correlation between retention rate and the level of discount discussed above: 
active customers get smaller coupons. Luckin’s strategy is to use larger discounts to reactivate marginal consumers, while core 
customers do not enjoy any additional benefits. Management also frequently indicated that their strategy is to use large discounts 
to attract new customers, help them cultivate the habit of drinking coffee, and then increase the average selling price, i.e., price 
discriminate loyal customers. 


 
Combining all the above, the truth of Luckin’s business model is that discount level is the key driver for its price sensitive 
customers. When the company cranks up the discounts on its products, customers increase spending; when the company wants to 
“raise price” by decreasing discount levels, customers become less active and purchase less products.  
 
Furthermore, as its number of stores continue to grow fast, further increasing store penetration becomes dilutive for existing stores. 
By 2019 4Q, our investigation of the real business metrics indicates that even when the management further increases 
discount level (to 46% real case), number of items per store per day have started declining.

The new “unmanned retail” strategy serves as another potential problem for Luckin: management claims that coffee from its 
coffee EXPRESS has the same quality as the one sold in its physical stores, thus should be priced the same; however, this will 
draw attention to the fact that Luckin’s coffee is made by fully automatic machines, not by professional baristas. 
 
Coffee machines used in stores can be classified into three levels of automation. Costa and Pacific Coffee use semi-automatic 
machines which require on-site baristas to manually make espresso and steam milk. Starbucks and McCafé use semi-automatic 
machines with an automatic espresso function: expresso comes directly out of the machine, but baristas need to complete the 
process of steaming/texturing milk. Luckin, KFC and convenience stores such as Seven Eleven use fully automatic coffee 
machine: employees can make a latte by simply pressing a button.  
 
While KFC and convenience stores choose fully automatic machines because their on-site employees have many other things to 
do, Luckin also uses this type of machine because it can reduce labor costs and barista training to a minimum level. It only takes 
half a day for Luckin to train a new “barista”, while Starbucks would take two weeks training theirs. Luckin’s coffee machines are 
in line with KFC’s in terms of quality and capacity, but better than those used by convenience stores which sell coffee at even 
lower prices.  
 
From the customer’s perspective, coffee made by experienced baristas are considered premium: quality of coffee is higher, and the 
barista’s presence makes a difference in the customer’s mind. For example, in the customer survey above, Luckin customers do 
rank “professional coffee maker” high in their perception of Luckin coffee, likely because Luckin’s stores and employees are 
dedicated mainly to coffee making. However, emphasizing that Luckin’s unmanned machines make the same coffee works against 
its customers’ existing perception and its price premium over coffee from KFC or convenience stores.  
 
 
 
Business Model Flaw #3: Flawed unit economics that has no chance to see profit: Luckin’s broken business model is bound 
to collapse 
 
Before we move onto examining Luckin’s store-level unit economics next, it’s important to highlight that, amongst different 
verticals in the food and beverage (F&B) service industry, coffee is categorized as one with mature supply chain, standardized 
production, and relatively high gross margin. However, Starbucks is the only coffee retail chain that’s meaningfully profitable in 
China, which indicates that the key to profitability is not all about making and selling products, but more about finding a viable 
business model on the store level. 
 
There are three proven business models for freshly brewed drinks business in China: the third-space model (high ASP + big store, 
e.g. Starbucks), the convenience store model (low ASP with shared store, e.g. FamilyMart, KFC coffee), the bubble tea model 
(mid-to-low ASP + small store, e.g. tea franchises like Yidiandian, Coco). Each model is successful for different reasons. But 
Luckin is stuck in between. As comprehensively discussed in Flaw #1 and #2: on one hand, sales volume is capped by the limited 
end demand for coffee as a functional product; on the other hand, Luckin is not able to increase price and maintain sales volume 
simultaneously due to its highly price sensitive customer base. When we add rental costs and headquarter expenses (part of which 
is spent to acquire new customers) to the equation, it’s clear that Luckin cannot turn profitable on store-level and the losses 
become worse on corporate level.  
 
Luckin is incurring high operating losses on store-level, based on its real case sales volume and effective price.  
 
As an offline F&B service business, Luckin’s unit economics can be broken down into three factors: revenue, cost of sales, and 
store-level operating cost.  
 
Revenue: Revenue is determined by items sold per day and effective sales price (i.e. after discount). For illustration purposes, we 
use disclosed 2019 2Q numbers for number of items sold per store per day of 345 and effective cost per item of RMB 10.5 per 
item (net revenue divided by total items sold) to calculate the store’s net revenue of RMB 109k per month.  
 
Cost of sales: Raw material cost for Luckin’s freshly brewed drink is RMB 5.6 per item (same as 2019 2Q), which is 53.5% of the 
effective sales price. The blended gross margin is 46.5% on store level, which translates into RMB 50.6k gross profit per month. 
 
Store-level operating cost: Luckin’s store-level operating cost includes rental (RMB 15k per month), labor cost (RMB 3.0/item 
according to management presentation), utilities (RMB 5k per month) and depreciation of equipment and store decoration (RMB 
450k upfront investment that requires 3-5 years of payback). We calculate Luckin’s store-level operating cost to be RMB 61.1k 
per month, which has limited room to be significantly reduced further. 
 
Delivery subsidy: Luckin outsources delivery service to SF Express (顺丰). Since coffee delivery is very time-sensitive, SF’ 
delivery riders usually station on Luckin’s store, which results in higher cost. We estimate delivery cost to be RMB 9-10 (incl. 
VAT) per order. Moreover, Luckin offers free delivery (equivalent to RMB 9-10 delivery subsidy per order) for large orders (>
79 


RMB 55 per order in 13 cities, > RMB35 per order in other cities, based on listed prices, not on effective prices) and charges 
RMB 6 delivery fee for smaller orders (equivalent to RMB 3-4 delivery subsidy per order). As a result, Luckin effectively offers 
RMB 5 delivery subsidy per order.  
 
Management excludes delivery expenses/subsidies from store unit economics. However, delivery subsidy is directly resulted from 
selling and distributing products and can be attributed to each individual store. The company disclosed that in 2019 2Q, 19.8% of 
the total items were purchased through delivery. We calculate additional RMB 7.8k delivery subsidy per month per store, which 
further pressures store unit economics. 
 
On store level, Luckin’s RMB 50.6k gross profit is unable to cover RMB 61.1k operating cost and RMB 7.8k delivery 
subsidy, thus generates RMB 18.3k operating losses per month. More importantly, Luckin still cannot break even on store 
level on cash flow basis without considering depreciation. In other words, Luckin’s upfront investment on equipment and 
decoration will never be paid back as the opened store continues to burn cash on a monthly basis. 


 
Luckin’s store-level unit economics

As operating expenses are largely fixed and cost of raw material is proportional to revenue, daily items sold and effective 
prices after discount are the two key drivers for Luckin’s store unit economics.  
 
The below sensitivity table showcases how changes in the two drivers, daily items sold and effective price, impact Luckin’s store-
level operating margins and corresponding payback period (in months). In 2019 2Q, Luckin’s store is running at a negative 16.8% 
operating margin including the delivery subsidies. Meanwhile, EBITDA is still negative, i.e. the average store was operating on a 
negative cash flow basis. 
 
Luckin’s stores usually have a lease term of 3 years, which means that the payback period needs be within 36 months. In the 2019 
2Q case with 53% discount (effective price at 47% of listed price), daily items sold needs to reach 800 or above to meet this target.  
 
Luckin management has been articulating to investors that their long-term pricing strategy is not the “listed price” either, but “buy 
2 get 1 free”, i.e. 33% discount. Let’s generously assume this price target can be achieved in all products. In this case, a store needs 
to sell 200 items per day to have a 36-month payback period while increasing its average effective price by 43%, still the 
operating margin would only be 3%.

Luckin’s unit economics sensitivity analysis 


 
Source: Coffee_Detective Analysis 


 
Taking a step back, our research shows that there are three viable business models for freshly brewed drinks, and Luckin 
lacks the competitive advantage to develop into any one of them.  
 
In the F&B service industry, items sold per store and effective price are usually negatively correlated. Luckin’s competitors who 
succeeded have all found their own ways to strike a balance between volume and price. Their investments in new stores can 
generate reasonable ROI due to this balance, which is the foundation for the business model to be viable.  
 
“Third space”: Starbucks has built a premium brand in past 20 years in China and successfully offers the value proposition of a 
“third space” through selling coffee. As a result, it can price products at higher price and still achieve larger volume vs. competitors 
to achieve profitability. Although Luckin’s smaller store space enables cost savings on both upfront investment and daily operation, 
its store-level revenue and gross profit is only 17% and 11% of Starbucks by targeting the niche market of coffee’s functional 
demand. As mentioned in Business Model Flaw #1 and #2, the success of Starbucks’ “third space” model is contingent on strong 
brand value and rental negotiation power, other followers (such as Costa Coffee and Pacific Coffee) are still struggling to break 
even. It’s impossible for Luckin to replicate “third space” model given its different store design and brand positioning. 
 
“Convenience store” model: competitors like KFC and FamilyMart leverage on existing stores and staff to cross-sell coffee. As a 
result, KFC and FamilyMart only need to purchase the coffee machine and raw materials without any additional rental and labor 
cost. “Convenience store” model can achieve an ROI level similar to Starbucks despite much smaller sales volume. Luckin, on the 
other hand, is a dedicated coffee shop (although it tries hard to convince investors that it “uses coffee to generate traffic and then 
cross-sell them tea or snacks or bakery or everything else) and will continue to be viewed as such by its customers. 
 
Bubble tea shop: Yidiandian and Coco’s product pricing is comparable to Luckin’s. However, their target market of tea drinks is 
much larger than coffee in China. Being a top-tier tea drink shop can achieve very high sales volume per store. Luckin will find it 
hard to replicate, since it mainly serves the functional coffee market and caffeine demand has been largely satisfied through tea in 
China. Bubble tea shop’s gross margin is also structurally higher at >60%, which means Luckin might need to achieve an even 
higher sales volume per store to break even.

Store-level unit economics comparison of different business models 


 
Source: Company filings, Coffee_Detective research 


 
For Luckin’s store-level economics to work, Luckin needs to either increase both price and volume simultaneously or increase one 
of them while maintain the other one stable. However, capped by the market size and price-sensitive user base, it’s very difficult for 
Luckin to achieve either targets. The above table showcase how in 2019 3Q, Luckin had faked the increases in BOTH its items 
sold per day and price per item to achieve store level profitability. In reality, their store-level operating margin calculated 
from the real business metrics was likely negative 33% (inclusive of delivery subsidy).  
 
Luckin’s best bet is to follow the bubble tea model, with small stores and low product price: then its high sales volume per store 
per day is the necessary condition to store-level break-even. Unfortunately, the core issue would be the limited demand in China 
for coffee as a functional product, which is especially apparent when compared to the much bigger market for tea drinks in China. 
As a result, it’s extremely difficult for Luckin’s sales volume per store to match its bubble tea peers such as Yidiandian and Coco.  
 
Another restricting factor on volume is the fact that the majority of Luckin’s stores are located in office buildings, as it aims to 
satisfy functional demand. An office building in China typically contains ~2k people. The first requirement in Luckin’s own business 
development criteria is to position new stores in office buildings with >1.5k people. We can also verify this by looking at Luckin’s 
monthly transacting customers per store: the metric centers around 2k. It reached peak levels of ~2.6k in 2018 2Q (when there were 
not so many stores) and 2018 4Q (when there were deep discounts). In 2019, its monthly transacting customers per store trended 
down with its aggressive store expansion. Due to the geographic coverage of each store, there is substantial cannibalization if 
stores become too dense in a region, which further limits the sales volume can be achieved by each store.

Luckin monthly transacting customers per store 


 
Source: Company filings, Coffee_Detective analysis 


 
With the sales volume upside handicapped, can Luckin shift towards the Starbucks’ model to improve its pricing power? The answer 
is clearly a no, as Luckin’s customers are highly price-sensitive and lack royalty to its products and brand, and it cannot 
increase price without sacrificing sales volume significantly.  
 
The two inherent flaws in its business model have been pushing Luckin away from any of the viable paths to profitability. Luckin’s 
real case in 2019 3Q should have been unsurprisingly continued losses and no improvement in unit economics. However, as we 
have shown in the Smoking Gun Evidence segment above, management had started to commit fraud by faking an inflection point 
of its business model: miraculously, they are able to dramatically increase sales volume per store with less discounts in 2019 3Q 
reported case and 4Q guidance, and investors mistakenly bought their story thinking that the business has turned the corner to 
become viable. 
 
On top of the losses Luckin is racking up on store-level, its high and rising headquarter expenses also add insult to injury. 
Luckin incurs heavy customer acquisition cost (“CAC”) on the corporate level: over the past quarters, CAC per new customer 
mostly stayed ~RMB 50 and if we take its ~25% monthly retention (<35% in M1 and quickly decline to 20%-25%) into account, 
the CAC per monthly transacting customer is already ~RMB 200.  


 
Luckin customer acquisition cost 


 
Source: Luckin’s 2019 2Q earnings highlights 


 
Management targets a total of 10k stores by the end of 2021, which means it aims to open another 5.5k stores over the next 8 
quarters, or 688 new stores per quarter. We use the real case of 263 items sold per store per day to derive that its stores on average 
sell 7890 items per month. We have also derived in Business Model Flaw #2 that Luckin’s existing transacting customer buys on 
average 5.5 items per month. Thus, Luckin will need to acquire 1,435 monthly transacting customers for each new store. If 
the new store doesn’t cannibalize from the existing stores (which is aggressively optimistic as its store penetration in existing 
cities increases), we estimate that Luckin will need to spend RMB 287k per new store per quarter on customer acquisition 
expenses alone, which works out to be RMB197 million per quarter with 688 new stores.
83 


In terms of general and admin expenses, Luckin’s trailing 3 quarters’ run rate is about RMB 76k per store per quarter (average of 
RMB 228 million expenses divided by the average store count of 3,000). Therefore, additional general and admin expenses for 
688 new stores will cost the company another RMB 52.2 million per quarter. 
 
On the other hand, Luckin is currently far from store-level break-even. We calculate that it’s losing RMB 26k per store per month 
under the real case, or RMB 17.9 million per month for 688 new stores. Essentially under the current business model, everything 
else equal, Luckin’s expansion plan is losing its investors RMB 53.7 million more per quarter on the store level, and then 
another RMB 249.2 million more on the corporate level, totaling RMB 303 million more losses per quarter, just on the new 
stores alone! The more stores Luckin opens, the more money and faster Luckin investors will lose. 
 
 
 
Business Model Flaw #4: Luckin’s dream “to be part of everyone’s everyday life, starting with coffee” is unlikely to come 
true, as it lacks core competence in non-coffee products as well. Its “platform” is full of opportunist customers without 
brand loyalty. Its labor-light store model is only suitable for making “Generation 1.0” tea drinks that have been in the 
market for more than a decade, while leading fresh tea players have pioneered “Generation 3.0” products five years ago. 
 
Luckin Tea (小鹿茶): a generation 1.0 tea product benchmarking generation 3.0 competitors 
 
Luckin Tea is the most important non-coffee product for Luckin – there are differences in coffee vs tea customer base and 
consumption scenarios, thus theoretically Luckin Tea could help target and attract customers outside of its core coffee customers. 
Luckin started its Luckin Tea trial in Beijing and Shanghai in Apr 2019 and launched in nationwide stores in May 2019. In September 
2019, Luckin Tea was officially separated out as an independently operated brand and hired Xiao Zhan (肖战) as the brand 
ambassador.  
 
Compared to tea drinks, coffee is more functional and appropriate for more formal occasions such as business. Tea drink buyers, on 
the other hand, consume tea drinks for leisure and mostly care about the drink’s taste. While demand is not the limiting factor for 
the tea drink industry, the main challenges lie in supply chain management and in-store production. 
  
Coffee is a commodity with a standardized supply chain, while automatic coffee machines can greatly simplify coffee’s in-store 
production process; both factors are quite straight-forward. On the other hand, our research shows that tea drink, especially the 
“generation 3.0” product that Luckin Tea is benchmarking, is exactly the opposite, with much higher complexity in both supply 
chain and in-store production. 


 
Level of difficulty in various type of F&B categories

China’s tea drink industry has developed from generation 1.0 product (tea-powder brewed) to generation 2.0 product (tea leaves + 
creamer or milk), and then to generation 3.0 product (tea leaves + cheese milk topping + fresh fruits). Correspondingly, tea drink 
consumers have developed discerning taste on flavors. As can be seen in the top 10 tea drink brand below, products from generation 
2.0 and generation 3.0 currently co-exist in the market.

Top 10 China Tea Drinks Brands in 2019

• Generation 1.0: standardized product brewed from tea-powder. Major chains include Jieke Milk Tea (街客), Happy Lemon 


(快乐柠檬) and mom and pop shops. Product cost is low, but taste is also subpar.  
• Generation 2.0: bubble tea – pre-made tea (brewed from real tea leaves) with creamer/milk and bubble at order.  Major 


chains are Coco Milk Tea (Coco 都可) and Yidiandian (一点点), both Taiwanese brands 
o Currently Coco Milk Tea has 3,000+ stores while Yidiandian has 2,000+ stores. Both brands operate under the 


franchise model. This type of store has very limited store area (no seating)  
o Due to restriction on supply chain, these stores are limited to fruits with long shelf-life such as lemon, which is why 


they feature milk tea instead of fruit tea.  
o Mixue Bingcheng (蜜雪冰城) is another generation 2.0 chain; it targets lower tier cities with low priced products  


• Generation 3.0: tea drinks are made on the spot with real tea, cheese milk topping, and fresh fruits. Major chains include 
HEYTEA (喜茶), Nayuki (奈雪的茶) and Lele Tea (乐乐茶).  


o Generation 3.0 is another significant upgrade from 2.0, with much better raw materials and correspondingly product 
price also increases from RMB 10-15 to RMB ~30 


o In-store decoration of generation 3.0 brands are often more “instagramable”, and they also provide seats to better 
integrate the “3rd place” strategy like Starbucks 


o Due to the raw materials upgrade and increased requirement for handling & processing of fresh fruits, the cost of 
generation 3.0 products is higher both from material and labor perspectives 


 
Luckin Tea is benchmarking generation 3.0 tea drink and its product lineup mainly copies HeyTea, which has been one of the most 
popular tea drink brands in China. However, Luckin’s product R&D system as well as supply chain capabilities are based on 
Starbucks and designed for coffee products, which are fundamentally different from the generation 3.0 tea product. 
 
Coffee brands such as Starbucks and KFC mainly use pre-mixed powder for tea drink production: the flavors of tea and fruits mainly 
come from tea powder and jam. These drinks are cheaper and easier to produce and are supplemental to the main coffee products. 
Luckin has always been targeting an even simpler in-store production process than Starbucks to minimize the involvement of 
employees. While Starbucks would mix different raw material powders, Luckin requires suppliers to blend as much raw material 
powers as possible into a condensed paste, which then can easily be mixed with water on-site to produce tea drinks. 
 
Product development for the generation 3.0 tea drink is the opposite: HeyTea and Lele Tea prioritize better and fuller taste over 
efficiency/convenience. To ensure quality and flavor, raw products such as tea leaves, fresh fruits and toppings are often 
directly sourced and selected. Product managers would then go through repeated test and trial of different combinations of raw 
materials to achieve the optimal taste before promoting the product in-store. On-site production is very labor intensive, as the 
fresh fruits are often peeled on the spot, and the cheese milk topping is blended and whipped by hand. 
 
Luckin’s management made it clear that due to a large scale of 4,000+ stores and the pursuit of in-store efficiency, the company 
won’t be able to afford fresh fruits. Instead, it would only adopt NFC juice, jam, and frozen fruits as substitutes. Luckin’s cheese 
milk topping is also powder-made. Furthermore, no additional equipment is required for Luckin Tea products, which reinforces 
our view that Luckin’s tea drink is essentially generation 1.0 product. Luckin Tea can’t replicate HeyTea products given its 
R&D and supply chain model.

Below picture shows a series of Luckin Tea product: each drink’s texture appears even and balanced, indicating that it is blended 
from either NFC juice/jam; the bright color likely comes from artificial pigment. Limited fruits, mainly citrus with longer shelf-
life, are added likely for decorative purposes.  


 
Luckin Tea Series 


 
 
Starbuck Modern Mixology series launched in 2019 summer are similar to Luckin Tea above. The artificial coloring is quite apparent, 
and the fruits are also mainly citrus. Some of these drinks have even mixed in the coffee element. Based on our research, Starbucks’ 
own feedback is that they were on the right track to acquire younger customers with tea drink, but the products were not attractive 
to target consumers as they had hoped. 


 
Starbucks Modern Mixology Series 





The HeyTea products below have uneven texture with obvious layers of tea, fruits and cheese milk topping. The color is more 
natural, and there are more variety of fresh fruits. The quantity of fruits is also much bigger than Luckin/Starbucks to provide a fresh 
flavor instead of juice/jam. 


 
HeyTea products 





According to our research, Luckin Tea’s fruit tea products taste drastically different from generation 3.0 products they are 
trying to imitate. There is an obvious taste of jam and artificial flavoring but barely any flavor of tea. The only product with fruit 
pulp tastes like canned fruits. Customers also have limited choice on level of sweetness: most of the products could not be delivered 
as sugar-free (feedback from Luckin’s stores indicates that sugar had been pre-blended in tea powder and jam). The limited 
customization of products reflects on Luckin’s principal of standardizing and simplifying in-store operation. Yet it comes at the 
expense of customer experience. Based on Meituan’s milk tea delivery industry report, only 7% of customers would choose full 
sugar / high sugar while sugar-free is the top option when choosing milk tea products.  
 
To conclude, Luckin Tea is poorly positioned to compete in the tea drink market. It lacks product R&D, supply chain know-how, 
in-store production manpower to deliver high quality product. Luckin Tea is structurally not competitive with generation 3.0 
tea drink players.

Luckin Tea are priced at RMB 21, 24 and 27 before discount; after the standard 33% off, the price range is between 14 to 18, lower 
than HeyTea/Nayuki but still higher than generation 2.0 products from Coco/Yidiandian. The other brands do not use price discounts 
as a constant mark-down. Since taste is the key factor for tea drinks, and the consumption frequency is only once or twice a week, 
Luckin Tea likely will end up resorting to price competition with an inherently lower quality product.

Other products: low gross margin business that’s inherently disadvantaged 
 
In addition to freshly brewed drinks, Luckin also provides F&B products purchased from 3rd-party suppliers, including 5 types of 
NFC juices, 3 types of lunches (salad/noodles), 21 kinds of light meals (bread, desserts, sandwiches, etc.) and 20 kinds of snacks. 
We’ve divided Luckin’s 3rd-party products by their distribution requirement and shelf life. 
 
Lunches (salad/noodles) and light meals (sandwiches, rolls, etc.) are perishable food that require cold chain supply. They are priced 
at RMB 35-38 and RMB 13-24 originally. Luckin provides 34% discount for all lunches and light meals on its APP as well as 
various coupons to bring the effective price down further. According to our research, customers think Luckin’s lunches and light 
meals are mediocre. For example, Luckin’s salad has a big serving of veggies/fruits but little protein, and the taste is plain. Lunches 
and light meals also require daily cold chain supply, thus the location of the vendors as well as cold chain logistics can be restricting 
factors. Moreover, Luckin is quite conservative in perishable food inventory management. Thus, lunches and light meals are usually 
sold out by noon, which is quite uncommon in F&B industry. 
 
NFC juices, bakery products and desserts also require cold chain supply. Luckin’s NFC juices are OEM products supplied by Zero 
Fruit Farm (零度果坊). The original retail price of NFC juices is RMB 24. Post-discount price is slightly lower than the offline 
retail price of Zero Fruit Farm’s own products. Bakery products and desserts are listed at RMB 13-16 and RMB 25, but with have 
corresponding discounts. On-site staff needs to thaw bakery products before selling them because these products are also supplied 
through cold chain logistics. However, most of Luckin’s stores are not equipped with heating equipment so Luckin’s bakery 
products taste significantly worse than freshly baked/heated ones. Per our research, Luckin fits out its stores based on a 
“modularized” design to expedite its new-store deployment. Initially, Luckin didn’t take heating equipment into consideration, so 
there is little room for heating equipment in its existing stores. To our knowledge, Luckin’s product team doesn’t plan to add 
heating equipment either and customers can only heat food themselves. 
 
Snacks are easy to store and have no need for cold chain supply. Luckin’s snacks mainly target white-collar workers, and its number 
of SKUs is higher than that of Starbucks and Costa. The original price of Luckin’s snacks varies from RMB 13 to RMB 30, and the 
post-discount price would be RMB 9-20. Luckin’s snacks have no differentiation as they are existing products under 3rd-party 
suppliers’ own brands, which are available in all major retail channels. Customers cannot see the brands they are buying when 
ordering snacks in APP only to find out later that they are not Luckin branded. We’ve compared the prices of Luckin’s snacks and 
same products sold in other channels. Luckin’s post-discount prices are in line with the retail prices offered by offline 
convenience stores, but on Tmall/JD and the O2O food delivery platforms the same products are 25% and 15% cheaper.

According to the reported numbers, Luckin’s other F&B business has a lower ASP and a higher average COGS per item than 
its freshly brewed drinks business. Per our research, Luckin’s procurement costs for 3rd-party F&B products are already very low. 
The company has already known its suppliers’ costs and used a cost-plus method to negotiate on pricing. Therefore, Luckin’s 
suppliers’ margin should be relatively low and there is very limited room for further reduce procurement price.

Luckin’s other F&B business is not competitive and cannot generate new traffic for its offline stores. Luckin entirely depends on 
3rd-party in product supply and has poor R&D capability, so its products lack differentiation and competitiveness. Unlike coffee, 
Luckin doesn’t use a consistent brand in its other F&B business.  Lack of heating significantly worsens the taste of its bakery 
products and lunches (like noodles). 3rd-party snacks are widely available in other channels and often at a cheaper price, such as 
online ecommerce platforms and offline convenience stores. Compared to these competitors, Luckin is much worse positioned 
with a lot smaller scale, very limited product SKU, inferior supply chain/inventory management expertise. 
 
 
 
Business Model Flaw #5: The franchise business of Luckin Tea is subject to high compliance risk as it’s not registered with 
relevant authority as required by law, because Luckin Tea launched its franchise business in September 2019 without 
having at least two directly-operated stores fully operational for at least 1 year. 
 
According to China’s Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Franchises《商业特许经营管理条例》 , the term 
“commercial franchise” refers to such business operations by which an enterprise (“franchiser”) owning a registered trademark, 
enterprise mark, patent, know-how or any other business resource confers the said business resource to any other business operator 
(“franchisee”) by means of contract, and the franchisee undertakes business operations under the uniform business model as 
stipulated by the contract, and pay franchising fees to the franchiser17. 
 
Luckin Tea has clearly avoided associating with the franchise business model: it names its third-party operators “New Retail 
Partners”, and specifically emphasizes that it doesn’t charge a franchising fee. Instead, company requires the “New Retail Partners” 
to exclusively procure raw materials from Luckin and charges a share of gross profits after the store achieves gross profit breakeven18. 
 
However, the Higher People’s Court of Beijing had already provided judicial interpretation that charging any profit-sharing 
or any product mark-up already constitutes as franchising fee19. Therefore, whether the company calls it franchise model or 
not, Luckin Tea is trying to operate a business that, by regulation’s definition, is a commercial franchise.

Lukin’s Presentation on Luckin Tea’s “New Retail Partners” Model 


 
Source: “After 2 months, Luckin announced that Luckin Tea brand will be operated independently and introduced partnership 


model” https://new.qq.com/omn/TEC20190/TEC2019090300532000.html  
 


According to Administration of Commercial Franchises regulation no. 7, a qualified franchiser needs to own and operate at least 2 
direct stores for over 1 year20. Luckin Tea did not have any independent operating stores until October 2019 according to 
Luckin’s COO Liu Jian21. Therefore, Luckin Tea has not met China’s regulation requirement to qualify as a franchiser. 
 
Another evidence is that it also still needs to register with the relevant department of Ministry of Commerce within 15 days of 
signing its first franchisee agreement, according to regulation no. 822. However, we have searched the key words “Luckin Tea” 
and “Luckin” in both English and Chinese (“小鹿茶” and “瑞幸”) on Ministry of Commerce Commercial Franchises 
Information Registration System (http://txjy.syggs.mofcom.gov.cn/), and found no companies registered with these keywords.

The potential consequences of Luckin Tea’s violations of these regulations: violating regulation no. 7: commercial administrative 
department shall order the company’s correction, confiscate all illegal income, impose a fine of more than RMB 100k and less 
than 500k, and make an announcement on the violation23. Violating regulation no. 8: Competent Commercial Department shall 
order record procedure within specified time limit, a fine of more than RMB 10k and less than 50k shall be imposed; if no record 
has been made within the time limit, a fine of more than RMB 50k and less than 500k shall be imposed, and a public 
announcement on the violation shall be made24. Negative impact of not satisfying “lawful business operations” might far exceed 
the fine amount for a listed company.
