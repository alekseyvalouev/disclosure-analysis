The Short Case for Zalicus: Not Worth Its Market Cap
Jul. 6, 2011 5:59 AM ET44 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


The fair value of Zalicus (ZLCS) shares is about $0.50 to $1.00. Our fund is short Zalicus.


Calculating the fair value of Zalicus is relatively straightforward. There are two main
assets, Exalgo and Synavive.


Exalgo is a pain drug sold by Covidien (COV). The royalties due to Zalicus are run-rating
at approximately $1.5 million annually. The drug seems to have peaked in sales. Even
assuming it doubles and then peaks, the Exalgo royalties ($3m X 8x sales for a cost-free
royalty) are worth $24 million, or $0.25 per share. Exalgo isn't quite the flop a Nuedexta or
Bidil is, but for it to be a meaningful drug for Zalicus' meager royalty share, it will have to
do a lot more in revenue to move the needle for this minority owner.


Synavive is a maligned drug. In 2008, the Synavive "COMET-1" study for osteoarthritis
failed. How soon the market forgets. This combination of two generic drugs did not do any
better (amazingly, it did worse!) than its component drugs. Why should we expect a
different outcome from the SYNERGY study? The biological rationale for this drug
(formerly known as CRX-102) is flawed, and that was proven in COMET-1. I think Zalicus
management is taking this study on because they have nothing better to do. With
"SYNERGY", management gets to continue the farce that the company's market cap of
$250 million resembles those of other "promising phase 2 companies".


Synavive is the combination of prednisolone and dipyridamole. The company claims they
have a composition of matter patent on the combination of two extremely old drugs.
Someone should inform management that to win a composition of matter patent, they
should probably invent the compound in question first. Synavive won't work in SYNERGY.
This asset is worthless. It's worse than worthless--it will eat up $10 to $20 million in cash
as the SYNERGY study reads out in the next year.


I value the rest of the pipeline, including the interesting Nav ion channel drugs, with a
modest $0.25 value until they enter the clinic.


With 90% downside, ZLCS is a great short. I think the average investor forgets there is no
difference between a $2 stock and a $20 stock and a $200 stock and your expected
return. A smaller stock price is actually inversely correlated with performance.

Yesterday's stock move in Zalicus is noteworthy. The 3 research analysts covering the
stock, JMP Securities, Wedbush and Oppenheimer, have no interest in helping you make
money. They exist to support their "business model" of writing new secondary deals for
overvalued stocks like Zalicus. Zalicus' CEO made $2.5 million in 2010 according to
Bloomberg ($446,000 in salary). Zalicus claims no serious institutional shareholders. Don't
subsidize this CEO and this forgettable asset for the illusion of a "cheap" stock. Think in
market cap - not stock price. Is this company worth $250 million? Is it worth $500 million
or $100 million? If you can't follow this exercise, the market isn't for you. Consider a job
selling research at an investment bank.


Disclosure: My hedge fund and I are short ZLCS. We may change our positions at
anytime without updating Seeking Alpha.

just their ASSets) and you need to cover ASAP.

Martin,


Thank you for your article. Could you please explain your position on Synavive a bit further? If the Synergy trial is
identical (or simply as worthless as the COMET-1 trials) then why would Zalicus be working on it? Why would they
have taken out an $8M loan to test it? Wouldn't it be easier for them to either collaborate (lose the liability) or simply
move on and explain to investors that Prednisporin and other research is worth more?


Considering that almost none of the analysts have used Synavive as a major talking point for the value, we can
assume the failure of it would not be very significant to Mkt Cap/PPS.


So again, if it's "worse than worthless" as you present why are they starting a new trial?


I submit that perhaps this new formulation and trial setup is actually useful and has an edge that, if proven in P2B will
yield an interesting P3 trial set and potential drug.


06 Jul 2011, 09:10 AM


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for your comments. It's certainly not identical! It's a new disease (rheumatoid
arthritis). The new initiation highlights Synavive extensively.


"Prednisporin" (I hate calling it that) remains to be seen as effective and ZLCS only has a royalty. Maybe it will
go better than Exalgo...


I think management is wasting the money on Synavive because they aren't judging the competitive landscape
appropriately for a new RA drug and misunderstanding what they have in the way of a therapeutic index

different from the component drugs -- this is leading to a poor capital allocation decision.

- claim or have? Are you saying a publically traded company is lieing in press releases? I believe that is QUITE a
heavy accusation.


You claim that Oppenheimer, Wedbush, JMP have no nterest in making me money, but neither do you. They do
however, have the burden of actually being right so that people continue to follow their advice and they are paid for
their reports. You are "managing" a hedge fund with a sole purpose of profiting for YOUR clients. I would imagine
hardly anyone holding the stock right now are your clients, so it obviously would benefit you for the stock to drop so
you could put some of your fund into ZLCS and profit. This may not be the case, but saying that the other companies
have no desire for me to profit is poor transparency on your part considering the same can be said about you.


Worthless by what estimation? shoot me a copy of your pharma, bio, or chem degree and we can talk

Get real, man. were you around during the dot com bubble when all those "respected" analysts were pumping
worthless dreck to the moon? "Analysts" merely want to attract profitable financing business to their firms.

and this clown only wants to bash a stock a few percentage points so he can either hop on for a ride or he got
on the other side in the past week, took a beating and is looking for a quick rebound. I do my own DD, I dont
100% trust any analysts, but I would take their opinion over a guy with as poor analysis and as little
transparency as this guy.

Thanks -- Synavive is certainly a risky reason to invest. Having read through COMET-1 and looking at the changes I
agree it is not the most impressive piece of the ZLCS investment.


I think the value of Exalgo might prove to be higher than you currently estimate. Here is what Michael Murphy wrote of
the low royalties thus far:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/278121-the-short-case-for-zalicus-not-worth-its-market-cap 6/8


"Covidien expects Exalgo eventually to get $250 million to $300 million of the $6 billion long-acting opioid market.


However, as frequently happens with a new drug that is widely introduced, once the distributors have their initial
stock, sales fall off for a quarter or two as the sell-through builds. That is what happened in the September quarter,
when Zalicus reported only $0.15 million in Exalgo royalties, and will happen again in the December quarter, when I
am expecting only $0.4 million in royalties. Investors who do not understand how stocking and distribution work gave
the stock a drubbing, and gave us an amazing opportunity."


What are your thoughts?


06 Jul 2011, 09:20 AM


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I would not place any credence on a newsletter writer. Exalgo royalties to Zalicus are less
than half a million dollars a quarter. Unless you expect the drug to have a very uncommon launch curve, with
the second derivative going positive after time has elapsed (never happens), this asset is worthless.


Keep in mind Exalgo won't last forever either. The present value of all the royalties from here to expiry is likely
less than $20 million. Their share count is 100 million shares. So Exalgo is worth $0.20. The stock trades at
$2.63. Why would anyone be long?

With the current quarter now complete and earnings due in a month or so, please provide your estimate for Exalgo's
take, both with and without anticipated coupons.

Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Remember even the best investors/traders are only right slightly better than 50% of the time.
I am humble and certainly will be very publicly wrong on predicting the outcome of something eventually. With
a diversified portfolio, I'm prepared to bear that risk. What I worry about is those who aren't diversified and in
bad ideas like ZLCS. I don't think I'll be wrong on ZLCS. This price is a very poor risk/reward. Exalgo is dead
and the combinatorx strategy has failed repeatedly.

Thank you for sharing your views Martin. It has certainly upset quite a few people--remarkable indeed! They haven't
