Galbraith Warns Investors Of Bleak Outlook
For Whiting USA Trust I (WHX)
Highlights Reasons Galbraith Believes Whiting USA Trust I is Extremely Overvalued at
Current Price


Apr 30, 2013, 09:07 ET from Galbraith Global Investment Management, LP


NEW YORK, April 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Galbraith Global Investment Management, LP
("Galbraith"), issued a warning today to investors of Whiting USA Trust I ("the Trust" or "WHX")
(NYSE: WHX) that Galbraith believes WHX's current unit price is divorced from what it believes
is the inherent value of the Trust.  As a holder of a short position in WHX, Galbraith believes that
the market has failed up to now to recognize the fact that WHX expects to make only nine
more quarterly distributions, and to terminate in August 2015 with no residual value.


WHX was formed to acquire and hold a term net pro�ts interest ("NPI") in various oil and
natural gas properties for the bene�t of its unit holders. The NPI entitles WHX to receive 90% of
the net proceeds from the sale of a total of 9.11 million barrels of oil or oil equivalent ("MMBOE").
To date, WHX has distributed proceeds from 6.78 MMBOE, leaving 2.33 MMBOE available for
the Trust to distribute. WHX has no assets besides the NPI in the remaining 2.33 MMBOE. Once
the remaining 2.33 MMBOE have been produced and sold, WHX will terminate and have no
residual value.


WHX is currently expected to produce and sell the remaining 2.33 MMBOE by June 30, 2015,
and deliver returns to unit holders over 9 distribution periods. WHX has advised they expect
production yields to decline by approximately 10% annually for the remaining two years of the
Trust.  In addition, WHX has historically used derivatives contracts to hedge the price of oil and
gas.  The pro�ts from these contracts accounted for an average of 17% of the value of the
dividend over the last four quarters.   However, these derivative contracts expired in 2012 and
the dividend paid on 3/1/13 was the last one that will include these pro�ts (and the Trust will
have no future derivatives positions).   As a result of the declining production and the
expiration of the hedges, Galbraith expects that future distributions will be signi�cantly smaller
than last quarter's distribution.

For the above reasons, Galbraith has a short position in WHX and values the Trust's total future
distributions at no more than $4 per unit. Galbraith believes that at a current market valuation
of approximately $7 per unit, WHX is overvalued and, therefore, investors holding a long
position will lose a substantial portion of their investment.
