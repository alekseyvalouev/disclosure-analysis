After Factory Explosion, A Big Retail Pump On Neptune
Dec. 17, 2012 10:30 AM ET24 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Prior to November, Neptune Technologies (NASDAQ:NEPT) (NTB.TO) had been a
Quebec-based producer of "krill oil," a "neutraceutical" alternative to fish oil supplements
as an Omega 3 source. The company currently still has a market cap of $150 million and
typically trades over 200,000 shares per day and has liquid options in December, January
and February.


On November 8, a massive explosion ripped through Neptune's only production facility,
killing three people and sending 19 survivors to the hospital, some with critical injuries. In
all, this amounts to 20% of Neptune's workforce. The pictures and videos show that it was
a miracle that anyone was able to survive this horrific industrial disaster. All that remained
of the factory was a smoldering pile of twisted metal I beams and pulverized concrete.


Given that there was no longer even a factory for the employees to return to, Neptune was
then forced to terminate 70% of its employees. Ten people still remain employed on a full-
time basis and they have all agreed to 20% salary cuts.


Neptune has established a Special Victims Fund, which has been set up as a non-profit
organization that can accept donations from both companies and individuals. As of now, I
am not aware of a website that has been created or of any means of sending electronic
donations. However, paper checks can be sent by regular mail as follows:


Payable to: Fonds d'Entraide Neptune Technologies


Address: 545, Promenade du Centropolis, Laval, (Quebec ), H7T 0A3


Note: In the remainder of this article, I discuss the difficult realities faced by Neptune as a
company. I am painfully aware that management of Neptune is still recovering from a
horrendous tragedy and that it has its hands more than full at the moment. I direct
absolutely no criticism toward Neptune management, but I do direct very heavy
criticism toward the various parties who are aggressively and inappropriately
promoting this stock in light of the catastrophic impact that the disaster has had on
Neptune's ability to survive as a company.

5/22/2018 After Factory Explosion, A Big Retail Pump On Neptune - Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc (NASDAQ:NEPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 2/28


Despite Neptune's dire circumstances, a number of authors along with retail broker John
Thomas Financial, have portrayed it to retail investors as a compelling buy that is likely to
double or triple. This has spurred significant retail buying. The shares are currently 81%
held by retail investors.


After plunging to $2.10, shares of Neptune quickly rebounded to as high as $3.01. The
bullish articles have sought to minimize the impact of the fact that Neptune now has no
factory, no product, no revenue and only 10 employees. Instead they now suggest that
Neptune will go to $5.00-$7.00 on the back of prospects for its Acasti (ACPHF.OB)
subsidiary.


On Monday, Acasti released very early stage interim results for one of the Phase II clinical
study of its CapRe drug. The interim results were the first of two interim results to be
released on Phase II. The second study was delayed due to enrollment issues. So from
this point, there is still substantially more data that needs to be seen before clarity is
obtained on Phase II.


As expected, the CapRe product showed a good result in reduction of triglycerides, and as
expected the study will proceed. Neptune management has informed me that Phase III is
expected to be completed in 2015, such that potential revenue visibility is likely to become
more clear in late 2014.


However, two weeks ago, Acasti exercised a pre-payment option to Neptune, eliminating
the payment of royalties by Acasti to Neptune in exchange for giving Neptune greater
ownership of the subsidiary. Neptune will now own 61% of the subsidiary, but will no
longer be entitled to $700,000 per year in royalties.


The bulls are clearly quite misguided on Neptune, and are over playing the potential for
Acasti while downplaying the facts of the situation at Neptune. In fact it is much more likely
that the stock will end up trading at a slight premium to its $0.70 cash per share due to the
fact that it has no factory, no revenue, no product and only 10 employees.


The Acasti subsidiary may provide some additional premium over the $0.70 value by early
2014 as investors get additional visibility on the prospects for CapRe.


The share price last closed at $2.44.


The recent volatility in the stock has boosted the price of the call options, such that
selling those call options will yield 20%-30% as long as the stock stays flat or goes
down. This strategy is equally applicable to those who are currently long the stock

(as a hedge) as well as those who simply choose to take the opposite side of the
trade from John Thomas Financial.


During the course of my research, I have made it a point to have direct conversations with
each of the following parties: Neptune management, Lise Vaillancourt of Quebec's
Environment Ministry, Neptune's insurance provider AON Insurance (Quebec office), the
Canadian government's insurance regulator, and George Belesis (broker and co-founder
of John Thomas Financial)


The conclusions I have reached are summarized as follows:


With no near-term revenue prospects from either krill oil or Acasti, Neptune's ability to
survive as a company is highly questionable. The $150 million market cap company has
no factory, no product, no revenue and only 10 employees. Meaningful production will be
unable to begin until 2014, and even that is subject to a government investigation into the
explosion, which has already produced two non-compliance letters to Neptune.


Following a recent equity offering, which raised $31 million in proceeds, Neptune now has
$0.70 per share in cash and no revenue-producing assets remaining.


Meanwhile the current share price of Neptune remains at $2.44, which is just in line with
where it traded in early 2012, when Neptune was fully operational and growing revenue.


Even before the explosion, Neptune has never had a profitable year. Even as revenue
was increasing, losses continued to grow larger rather than decrease.


Under these circumstances, the only analytically defensible share price target for
the stock is at a slight premium to the $0.70 per share that it has in cash.


Any recommendation to buy Neptune shares at current levels is indefensible and
cannot be supported by analysis of the facts, the numbers or the circumstances.


Despite this clear reality, three recent bullish and promotional articles have come out since
the explosion and coincided with a significant bounce in Neptune's share price, which
briefly closed above $3.00. This can likely be attributed to the fact that Neptune is held
almost exclusively by retail investors.


These articles provided no useable data or company specific projections, yet offered
share price targets as high as $7.00, nearly triple from the current level of $2.44 and 40%
above Neptune's all-time high. Instead of providing analysis, optimism was expressed

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 4/28


toward the overall krill industry along with hopeful prospects for Neptune's Acasti
subsidiary. Management has stated that Acasti products are not expected to produce any
material revenue until 2015.


Neptune has also been heavily promoted by retail brokerage John Thomas Financial,
using mass cold calls touting the stock to unknown retail investors. As with the articles,
heavy focus is given to Acasti. In my own phone call with the co-founder of John Thomas I
was told that Neptune's share price was expected to rise by 45% within three months,
to pre-explosion levels, due to the fact that it had recently "doubled quarterly profits"
and that "nothing actually is going to be hitting the bottom line because basically they
have insurance to cover everything."


Ultimately, I was given a target of "way back over $5.00 per share,", so well more
than a double from current levels, within 6-8 months.


Neptune has never in its history generated a profit, and certainly not in two consecutive
quarters, so JTF was clearly mistaken. Neptune cannot even begin production until 2014.


In the month and a half since the explosion, Neptune has received no insurance monies
and its own documents discloses the risk that it will not be covered by insurance.


According to management, even interim plans for partnership agreements to outsource
some small production will require at least 6-12 months. So the notion that this stock will
rise 45% in three months, before exceeding $5.00 in 6-8 months is nothing short of
fantasy. When I asked for recommendations for other stocks beyond Neptune, the JTF co-
founder told me that he would only recommend two stocks as buys at present, Neptune
and controversial InterOil Corp (NYSE:IOC), based in Papua New Guinea. As shown
below, InterOil has been attacked from numerous angles as being a massive fraud and
the share price has recently fallen to near 3-year lows.


I have included a link to a verbatim (not paraphrased) transcript of this call along with
links to extensive online complaints from recipients of aggressive cold calls where they
were pitched controversial stocks by JTF brokers, including Neptune. I also include
employee reviews of JTF, which raise the term "boiler room" and which describe a firm
that gives brokers phones to dial while not even giving them computers for reading about
the stocks they pitch. I have also included details about the background of the founder of
JTF, including his involvement with drugs, an organized car theft ring and a history with
five highly troubled and sanctioned brokerages before founding his own brokerage. Many
of these details became public during his testimony in a New York murder trial in which
one his personal friends was convicted of killing three people.

I will also show that the longer-term prospects for Neptune are not much brighter than the
short-term prospects. Neptune has never generated a profit in its entire history, and its
planned expansion of capacity would result in Neptune single-handedly exceeding its
own estimate of total global demand for krill products by a wide margin. Neptune's
largest competitor, Aker BioMarine (OTC:AKKKF), has already tripled the sales of
Neptune, and the two are currently in a patent war trying to invalidate each others'
patents. Aker's production capacity alone is in line with Neptune's total estimate of
global demand for krill products. Aker also plans to double capacity.


Again, it is not my intention to criticize members of Neptune's management who are
clearly enduring extremely difficult times. Instead it is my intention to spotlight what I see
as an egregious promotion of the stock of a highly distressed company by parties who
demonstrate no concern for the dramatic losses facing the retail investors who are being
encouraged to buy the stock.


So again, my conclusion is that in contrast to the 100%-200% upside target being
promoted to retail investors, the real value of Neptune can clearly be demonstrated
as just a slight premium to the company's $0.70 per share in cash until such time as
the company has a factory, a product, some revenue and employees.

Part I - Details of the ongoing investigation into the explosion


This was not a small explosion. The tremendous explosion, which could be seen and
heard from kilometers away, quite literally destroyed everything including the machinery,
Neptune's inventory and the entire factory itself. An adjacent expansion facility. which had
been under construction, appears to have also sustained limited damage.

Two weeks after the blast, Radio Canada reported that Neptune had breached
environmental standards and that during the investigation of the blast, investigators had
found that the quantity of highly flammable acetone being stored was much higher than
what had been approved. Radio Canada went on to say that Lise Vaillancourt, a senior
official with Quebec's Environment Ministry was on the record as saying that notices of
non-compliance had already been sent to Neptune.


Radio Canada went on to say that Neptune's factory expansion project had been
conducted without authorization by the ministry and that despite the lack of authorization
Neptune had secured $3 million in funding from the Quebec government to fund it.


None of this is either final or resolved though. Neptune quickly responded that at the
time of the blast it felt that acetone levels were within regulations, but did also confirm a
notice of non-compliance from the Ministry, which pointed to the plant's equipment and
expansion.


Neptune did confirm that it had failed to adhere to equipment standards. But no comment
was provided regarding the unauthorized plant expansion or the $3 million funding.


In my conversation with management, I was told that there had been a misunderstanding
by the government and the investigators and that the excess acetone in question was
assumed to have been in tanks at the expansion plant, but that since this plant is not
operational they were empty at the time.


When I spoke to Lise Vaillancourt with the Environment Ministry she said that the Ministry
was not offering further public comments for the time being and would not confirm or
refute any of the statements made be either Radio Canada or by Neptune, nor would she
provide any updates to any statements previously made.


Neptune has advised that the investigation is still ongoing and until it is completed no
updates can be given as to the cause of the accident. I re-confirmed this with
management to see if there had been any further progress or clarity since that
announcement in November. I was informed that at this time there are no updates and
that no estimate of completion time can currently be given due to the fact that the
investigation is being conducted by the government and the investigators, which is
understandably beyond the control or influence of Neptune.


Part II - Assessment of prospects for any insurance payouts

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 7/28


Neptune has stated that it has both property insurance and business interruption
insurance, up to certain specified limits. However at the current time, Neptune is not
disclosing any of the terms or amounts related to these policies.


Neptune has further stated that the insurance proceeds would cover a portion of any
reconstruction, while bank loans would be needed to finance the remainder. Both the
insurance payout and the bank loans will depend on Neptune receiving a clean report
from the investigators.


When I spoke to management I was told that Neptune has not yet received any proceeds
from any insurance policies provided by Aon insurance and that the specific terms and
amounts of such coverage are currently not being disclosed. It has now been one and a
half months since the explosion and no insurance monies have been received.
However management is still hopeful that some insurance proceeds will be released
sometime soon.


All affected parties will no doubt be hoping for the best. However, the possibility that
Neptune will not receive insurance proceeds needs to be carefully considered. This has
been disclosed by Neptune in the equity prospectus as follows:


Lost sales or increased costs that the Company may experience during the
disruption of operations may not be recoverable under the Company's insurance
policies, and longer-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers


Part III - Elements and timing of the Strategic Action Plan


Three weeks after the explosion Neptune released a strategic action plan. Goals included
the following:


a) Resuming operations and certain levels of sales


b) Reconstructing a plant using the expansion facility


c) Pursuing partnerships for the outsourcing of production


d) Maintaining key customer relationships and market share


e) Continuing its product development and clinical trials


f) Defending its patents and intellectual property


g) Supporting the development of Acasti and NeuroBio

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 8/28


This is certainly an ambitious to-do list for the 10 remaining employees to undertake but it
is certainly an accurate list of what needs to be done.


In terms of timing, under the strategic action plan, Neptune will see no material revenue
for 6-12 months at a minimum, and in fact no material revenue for over one year is highly
likely. As for the cost, we can see clearly that Neptune plans to spend effectively all of the
proceeds from its equity offering at a time when it has no revenue.


a) resuming operations, sales and b) reconstructing an operational plant


Rebuilding a new factory is estimated to take 6-9 months. This will hopefully begin after
the investigation is completed and after the Canadian winter. As a result, it is expected
that that factory will be completed by 2014 at which time Neptune can begin to purchase
and process inventory. Any revenue would therefore be expected to begin in early-mid
2014. Revenue would need to start over from a low base, so I am assuming it could begin
at around $2 million per quarter, ramping up to as much as $5 million per quarter or
more by the end of 2014. Given that Neptune's best-ever quarter saw $8 million in
revenue, this estimate seems sensible.


So by the end of 2014, or perhaps early 2015, Neptune could realistically be back on par
with where it was during 2011 in terms of total revenue.


In terms of cost, the expansion facility had been budgeted at $21 million, so this can be
used as a rough estimate.


c) pursuing partnerships for the outsourcing of production


Identifying and securing new partners could potentially provide Neptune with an earlier
revenue stream. Management advised me that it is exploring a variety of options.
However, estimated time for this to happen was given as 6-12 months.


In looking at the prospect of outsourcing Neptune has disclosed in the action plan that
"Neptune's operations for the foreseeable future, particularly during an initial transition
period, are expected to yield significantly lower sales margins."


Given Neptune's historical lack of profitability even with higher margins, the logic
behind this strategy seems to be driven toward retaining customers and preventing a total
absence of Neptune's product during construction of the new factory. As a result, this
strategy is expected in incur significantly larger losses than in the past.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 9/28


Neptune still owns some amount of frozen krill, which had not been processed into
saleable inventory. Current potential partners are being evaluated in the U.S., China and
Australia and management advised me that it feels that shipping the frozen krill to these
locations for outsourced processing is an achievable prospect.


The reason for the large losses is that the outsourcers would need to make a profit and
then there would also be the cost of shipping the frozen krill to the U.S., China and/or
Australia.


Neptune also disclosed specifically that the rationale for identifying potential partners was
"both as an interim measure to ensure certain levels of production prior to its new plant
being fully operational and as a longer-term strategy to diversify sources and means of
production."


In light of the recent developments, the diversification is certainly sensible. As we have
now seen, when a company concentrates all of its production facilities and inventory
storage in a single location, it is painfully susceptible to a company wide shut down in the
event that the unexpected happens. This is all the more prudent when the production
process must make use of volatile and explosive chemicals such as acetone.


Neptune had already made investors aware of this risk factor, stating "The Company is
dependent on a single manufacturing facility" in the equity prospectus. Further detail is
provided saying:


If operations at the Company's manufacturing plant were to be disrupted as a result
of equipment failures, natural disasters, fires, accidents, work stoppages, power
outages or other reasons, the Company's business, financial condition and/or results
of operations could be materially adversely affected. Lost sales or increased costs
that the Company may experience during the disruption of operations may not be
recoverable under the Company's insurance policies, and longer-term business
disruptions could result in a loss of customers.


d) maintaining key customer relationships and market share


Maintaining customer relationships will be difficult with no product available but
presumably it can be facilitated through marketing spend. As part of the strategic action
plan, Neptune disclosed:

http://www.secinfo.com/d13XCc.p45k.d.htm
5/22/2018 After Factory Explosion, A Big Retail Pump On Neptune - Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc (NASDAQ:NEPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 10/28


Neptune believes that the proceeds of the [Equity] Offering can ultimately be
deployed, over a longer period of time than initially planned given the incident, in
substantially the same allocation as was disclosed.


In the prospectus, $9 million had been allocated for sales, marketing and inventory
purchases.


Determining market share for Neptune is a difficult task. When Neptune went out to raise
the $31 million via an equity offering, the prospectus included a 2012 study by Frost and
Sullivan, which stated that:


the krill oil market had global revenue of US$51.1 million in 2011, and is projected to
grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 16.4% between 2011 and
2016


Therefore the total global krill market in 2012 is estimated at $60 million according to
Neptune. In the same prospectus Neptune reiterated revenue guidance of $7-$8 million
per quarter, or roughly $30 million per year. So in reading the prospectus it is easy to
come to the conclusion that Neptune was capturing market share of 50% for the entire
global market of krill oil products


Yet as announced in the same prospectus, Neptune had planned to more than double its
production capacity by 2013, which would presumably mean that Neptune alone would
be capable of satisfying the entire world demand for all of the world's krill oil products. And
Neptune also disclosed that production capacity would triple by 2014, in which case its
production capacity would exceed global demand by a wide margin.


Competitor Aker BioMarine recently reported quarterly revenue of nearly $20 million (€
$14.65 million), which would equate to nearly $80 million per year, roughly triple that of
Neptune.


In its Q3 financial report, Aker also announced that it was roughly doubling its
production capacity of Superba Krill Oil 1000 MT. It also announced that it had recorded
a pre-tax profit that quarter of $7 million on revenue of $24 million for the quarter.


Other krill suppliers are also flooding the market with capacity, as noted in this 2012
article "Israeli krill player doubles capacity."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 11/28


The conclusion is that maintaining market share when it has no factory or product
will be difficult for Neptune. It will be all the more difficult given that its two largest
competitors are both doubling capacity and their capacity alone will quickly exceed
global demand for krill.


e) Continuing its product development and clinical trials


Funding ongoing clinical trials (such as CapRe) and other regulatory needs will continue
as planned according to the strategic action plan. The estimate disclosed is $3 million.


Moving past Phase II trials is generally a fairly straightforward process. A much higher
(and more expensive) hurdle will be getting full FDA approval upon completion of Phase
III. Management currently expects this to occur by 2015 at an undisclosed cost. Using
the already incurred cost of Phase II as a point of comparison, Phase III will likely cost
$10-$20 million.


On Monday, Neptune released the first of two interim results for one of the two Phase II
studies for CapRe. As would be expected for an Omega 3 product, CapRe was shown to
have a good result in reducing triglycerides and the study will continue as expected. The
second study was delayed pending further enrollment, but is also expected to ultimately
show a beneficial effect.


Neptune management has told me that the larger Phase III trial is expected to be
completed in 2015, such that any potential revenue prospects will become more visible in
2014.


Two weeks ago, Acasti exercised a pre-payment option to Neptune, eliminating the
payment of royalties by Acasti to Neptune in exchange for giving Neptune greater
ownership of the subsidiary. Neptune will now own 61% of the subsidiary, but will no
longer be entitled to $700,000 per year in royalties.


f) defending its patents and intellectual property


Offense and defense against patent infringement against Aker BioMarine will continue to
be both important and expensive, even while Neptune has no product to sell.


Aker is Neptune's larger competitor and currently brings in triple the revenue of Neptune.
Neptune has patented its krill process in the U.S. and has stated that "This implies that
competition will not be authorized to sell krill oil in the U.S. unless they reach an
agreement with Neptune."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 12/28


This statement was made in 2011, yet Aker has continued to sell in the U.S.


Aker has fought the U.S. patent claim, stating that similar results had been achieved prior
to Neptune's invented process such that Neptune actually invented nothing, and, "It
also alleged that the USPTO had not been informed of proceedings in the European
patent office 'in which Neptune's related European patent was ruled invalid.'"


In October 2012, Aker filed in the U.S. for a re-examination stating that Neptune's process
was "un-patentable" and again that Neptune had failed to submit all relevant information
to the U.S. Patent Office. Neptune quickly rejected this.


As a counter attack, Neptune filed a similar action against Aker in Australia, stating that
Aker's patent was "neither new nor inventive."


The point is that both sides are saying that the other is trying to patent something that
cannot be patented. This is simply a tactic for preventing one another from selling in major
markets.


Aker will no doubt seize upon Neptune's inability to produce in order to attempt to capture
Neptune's market share in the U.S.


Neptune has allocated $3 million of the proceeds from the recent equity offering for the
purposes including continuing the patent war.


g) Acasti and NeuroBio subsidiaries


According to the strategic action plan, both Acasti and NeuroBio will continue to be funded
with $8 million as planned and disclosed.


It is safe to say that from a value perspective, NeuroBio can be ignored by investors for
the medium term. NeuroBio is in the very early stages of exploring the use of krill in
treating various mental disorders, however nothing has advanced beyond pre-clinical
stages so nothing has even entered Phase I trials. Even if anything does ultimately work
out with NeuroBio, there is no prospect for any revenue from it for many years to come.
NeuroBio was partially spun off as a dividend to Neptune investors in September
2012.


Acasti on the other hand is currently progressing through two Phase II clinical trials for its
CapRe product. Acasti is also currently developing Onemia as a "medical food," which will
only be administered under the supervision of a physician and which is intended to serve

5/22/2018 After Factory Explosion, A Big Retail Pump On Neptune - Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc (NASDAQ:NEPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 13/28


as an Omega 3 dietary supplement. However, Onemia has generated just $10,000 of
lifetime revenue. Acasti also generated $116,000 in revenue by conducting contracted
research in fiscal 2012.


Acasti's other potential product is CaPre, which is designed as a medical treatment for
reducing high triglycerides and "bad cholesterol." As mentioned above, CaPre is currently
in Phase II trials. Management expects that Phase II will be completed in late 2013, and
then Phase III in 2015.


Despite the ongoing financial support being provided by Neptune, Acasti recently
exercised a royalty pre-payment option. However, this payment was made with stock
(warrants) such that Neptune will not receive any cash. This eliminates Acasti's obligation
to pay Neptune $700,000 per year in royalties. Neptune had an independent valuation
conducted, which concluded that the value of this non-cash transaction to Neptune was
$15 million, however this is based on the equity value of the ownership in the subsidiary,
not on any cash that would have otherwise been received.


Part IV - Promotional articles


In recent weeks Neptune hit a high of $3.01, higher than where it was in early 2012.
Even after dropping to $2.44 it is just in line with where it was in early 2012, when
Neptune was producing and selling its product and reporting record revenue and
growth. Looking back further, we can see than Neptune has traded as low as $1.08 in
2010, even when annual revenue were above $6 million.


The obvious question becomes: If Neptune's prospects are so grim then why is the
current share price on par with where it was when business was booming in early
20012?


After initially plunging to as low as $2.11 the share price rebounded to as high as $3.01.
This jump corresponded with a bullish investment article entitled:


"Neptune's Crisis Could Mean It's Time To Acquire This Speculative Equity."


The optimism here was pointed at the promising future for the krill industry in general
rather than at Neptune's specific prospects. The description of Neptune's situation clearly
contradicts the bullish title and draws the conclusion that it is time to sell rather than buy.
For example:

5/22/2018 After Factory Explosion, A Big Retail Pump On Neptune - Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc (NASDAQ:NEPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 14/28


Despite these promising trends, NEPT's near-term business is problematic. The
recent explosion effectively destroyed both its production facility and its warehouse
of product. Prior to the event, Neptune had already initiated construction plans to
double the company's production capacity by 2013. The company also indicated that
it had already received orders that nearly fully utilized production capacity. Now,
NEPT can neither meet those orders with new or prior production


Optimism was also expressed toward the CapRe product, despite the fact that Phase III
trials will not be completed until 2015. At that time the product may ultimately begin to
generate revenue according to management. This of course assumes that the product is
ultimately deemed safe and effective by the FDA.


There is nothing wrong with making a speculative bet on a company that has a single
product in Phase II trials. However that bet must be made within the context of the price of
the stock. At the current price, the author can only be assuming that Acasti is both a "sure
thing" and a "home run."


Acasti may or may not be worth something. The problem is that Neptune now owns over
60% of the subsidiary and the subsidiary is financially dependent upon Neptune for
survival. As a result, the Acasti stake can't be monetized unless Neptune chooses to
shop it around to strategic buyers. With no clarity on Phase II and no revenue prospects
for years, any strategic purchase would need to come at deep discount to any perceived
value that Acasti may have to Neptune.


The overall conclusion here is that the wisdom in "buying this speculative equity" is
entirely dependent upon the price. Even at a price of $1.50, Neptune would still be
substantially over valued, even in consideration of the prospects for Acasti as they are
currently understood.


Two other promotional articles came out following the explosion.


Applying The Venture Capital Model To Public Companies


Do You Have The Guts To Take On Cutting-Edge Biotech Like This VC?


The argument made is clearly puzzling. The author quotes an analyst with:

He initiated coverage on Neptune in August 2012 with a $7 target. The main
takeaway from his comment on Neptune following the explosion was very
encouraging from an investment standpoint. He ran a hypothetical worst-case
scenario, in which Neptune proves unable to produce product for a full year, and
found that this subtracted only $0.68/share from his net present value [NPV].


Once again we see a $7.00 target, which is 40% above Neptune's lifetime high share
price. Yet following the absolute destruction of the factory and the inventory and the
circumstance where "Neptune proves unable to produce product for a full year," the target
is reduced by just 10%, still 30% above its lifetime high, and nearly triple the current
level.


For starters, it would appear that the "VC model" needs to be substantially recalibrated.
After that, I would suggest that the author consider the merits of an old saying on Wall
Street, "Models don't buy stocks, people do."


V - John Thomas Financial - Blue Horseshoe Loves Neptune


In addition to the highly bullish articles that came out after the explosion, there has also
been a concentrated marketing effort by brokerage firm John Thomas Financial targeting
retail investors. In the text below I have included 15 links, which reveal extensive online
complaints from individuals who have received aggressive cold calls from JTF pitching
speculative stocks, including Neptune.


I have also included reviews from former employees where the term "boiler room" come
up often and which describe brokers who are given phones for making cold calls, but not
computers for learning about the stocks they pitch. These aren't my observations, these
are the observations that have been made in hundreds of online posts, which span the
course of several years, including in recent weeks.


I was curious to hear what sales pitch could possibly be given to retail investors when
recommending they buy the stock of a company in this condition, so I put in a call to JTF
to inquire about opening an account as well as the merits of Neptune stock.


I was put through to George Belesis, a senior broker who is a co-founder of JTF and
brother of well-known founder Anastasios "Tommy" Belesis.


For those who are interested, I have posted a verbatim (not paraphrased) transcription
of this call at moxreports.com.



http://www.johnthomasfinancial.com/

http://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/JTF-Transcript.pdf
5/22/2018 After Factory Explosion, A Big Retail Pump On Neptune - Neptune Technologies & Bioresources Inc (NASDAQ:NEPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 16/28


I expect that JTF adheres to the standard compliance procedure of recording all calls
between brokers and prospective clients, so the accuracy of the transcription should not
be the subject of any debate whatsoever.


Mr. Belesis chose to forego the traditional brokerage formalities of first inquiring about my
risk tolerance, investment experience, financial resources, employment status or
other details.


Instead he immediately suggested I buy shares of Neptune.


Among the various positives, I was told that Neptune had "doubled its profits in the last
quarter," which by definition means two consecutive profitable quarters.


Yet, Neptune has never shown a profit in its history and certainly not two in a row. And lest
there be any confusion, even revenue only increased by 33%, while the net loss
quadrupled.


I was also told that Neptune's share price was expected to more rise by 45% in the
next three months, back to the pre-explosion level of around $3.50.


Obviously this is a tall order for a company with no factory, no product, no revenue and
only 10 employees. The ongoing investigation, which could easily last more than three
months, would not seem to support these aggressive targets.


After rising 45%, I was told that JTF feels that Neptune will go to "way above $5.00,"
which leads me to the conclusion that perhaps JTF is also making use of the "Venture
Capital Model."


As for insurance, George informed me that "nothing actually is going to be hitting the
bottom line because basically they have insurance to cover everything."


I was initially confused about JTF's investment banking involvement with Neptune. I had
been familiar with several press releases such as here and here, which had stated
explicitly that JTF had acted as a co-manager in Neptune's equity offering deal.


Later I verified with Neptune management that JTF had originally been slated to be a co-
manager in the deal when it launched, but was removed before pricing due to some
underwriting issue with JTF, which was not clear. Instead, JTF received a flat fee of
$300,000 in connection with the offering, which was disclosed as follows:

the fee to John Thomas Financial, Inc. ("JTF") equal to US$300,000 as
compensation for financial advisory services provided in connection with an
investment banking agreement dated April 26, 2012 between the Company and
JTF;


My other concern was the possibility that JTF might actually own shares in Neptune while
simultaneously promoting it to retail investors. In this case George was less certain, telling
me:


Neptune ? I don't believe the company [JTF] does, I can find out for sure. But I, ah,
um, um, We don't typically do that. We don't make markets. We don't uh, We don't
have inventory, if that's what you're looking at.


For InterOil he was more certain, saying:


Oh, No No No No. We don't make markets. The firm doesn't own IOC, No.


For me, one investment idea from JTF simply wasn't enough so I asked if it was currently
recommending any other stocks. Mr. Belesis told me that aside from Neptune, he was
only recommending one other stock, which was that of InterOil .


For those who are not aware, InterOil is a controversial energy company that operates in
the remote area of Papua New Guinea. Similar to Neptune, Mr. Belesis was
recommending this stock to me because it has declined by roughly 50% and is now
sitting near 3-year lows.


InterOil has been the subject of numerous allegations of fraud and the involvement of
John Thomas with this stock has attracted considerable attention from vocal skeptics,
including:

In the online complaints that have been lodged against JTF, I also came across one
complaint where JTF had been recommending China Media Express (OTCPK:CCME)
as a $40.00 stock. China Media Express was the poster child for China fraud against
American investors and when it last traded in August, it fetched a price of just $0.02
(two cents).


For those with further interest in reading about JTF's involvement with other companies
where fraud issues became relevant, America West Resources and Amber Ready make
for a good starting point.


Please note, I am not making any suggestion of fraud at Neptune.


I found my conversation with John Thomas Financial to be amusing; however, it could
certainly be less amusing to someone who is not well informed and chose to buy a stock
that is purported to rise 45% in three months because "quarterly profit has doubled"
and because "they have insurance to cover everything".


Again, Neptune is held almost entirely by retail investors, who own 81% of the
outstanding shares.


JTF was founded in 2007 by Anastasios "Tommy" Belesis. Belesis gained some amount
of attention when he played the role of a bald, cigar smoking stock broker in Oliver Stone's
"Wall Street Two: Money Never Sleeps."


However Belesis' past seems deserving of a movie of its own. The New York Post ran an
article entitled "Shady Past for Wall Street Mr. Clean" in which it describes a triple murder
committed by a friend of Belesis and where Belesis was summoned to testify regarding his
knowledge of the situation. The murderer, Christian Tarantino, was later convicted of
killing Vincent Gargiulo, who happened to be the brother-in-law of Twisted Sister singer
Dee Snyder. During his testimony, Belesis revealed his own involvement with drugs well
as in an organized car theft ring.


Belesis was never charged for his involvement in these activities and he ended up
pursuing a career on Wall Street. However, the Post goes on to note that:


Belesis' troubles didn't end when he made to it Wall Street. His brokerage record is
marred by five customer disputes before he founded John Thomas Financial and
one termination in 2005 amid allegations, never proven, that he misrepresented his
identity to a customer.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 19/28


A FINRA Broker Check report for Belesis reveals the details of these customer complaints
(pages 10-20) including churning, suitability, common law fraud, breach of contract,
negligence, misrepresentation and excessive trading. The termination note says that
Belesis was terminated from SW Bach & Co. for "inaccurate representation of identity
to a customer" (page 20). Total damages sought by customers exceeded $1.2 million,
however upon settlement only $350,000 was ultimately awarded to customers. Belesis
has said that the misrepresentation of identity was never proven.


By comparison, JTF's (the firm) own FINRA Broker Check report, is far cleaner. Although
pages 16-27 do reveal a number of "disclosable events", most of these are related to
failure to disclose "handling fees" resulting in excessive commissions to customers,
typically of around $20,000 per customer. In only one case (page 27) was there a
customer complaint claiming fraud, churning and misrepresentation. This claim was
denied in 2012.


Two pages of JTF employee reviews can be found here. Other reviews can be easily
found online. The debate about JTF being a "boiler room" seems to come up with
regularity. It is specifically noted that JTF pitches companies without knowing much about
them, and without giving computers to the brokers, only telephones for making cold calls,
as in this picture. As always, online postings from current and former employees should
be taken with a grain of salt.


The cold calls from JTF originate from numerous different phone numbers. For those who
are interested, I included 15 links. Others can be found online. The story in most of the
complaints is the same: A JTF broker calls, pretending to know the intended recipient, and
then launches a high pressure sales pitch to buy stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1068051-after-factory-explosion-a-big-retail-pump-on-neptune 20/28


Following its recent equity offering, Neptune now has a total outstanding share count of 57
million, excluding warrants and options.


Yet in the 12 months to September 2012, Neptune issued an additional 7.5 million
shares via warrants and options, half of which have a strike price of $3.00 or less.
The table shows 53 different issuances of warrants and options within a 12-month
period, so on average more than once per week.


Normally I would simply provide a link to the prospectus, which shows this. However in
this case I think it is very instructive to see both the frequency and the size of these
issuances, so I am posting the combined table as an appendix for readers to see for
themselves.


So far I have seen no reference to the size or the impact of this overhang by any of the
bullish authors or by John Thomas Financial. In looking at the true market cap of Neptune,
these options mean that Neptune is currently valued roughly $20 million more than
investors currently realize, but only if the share price goes up just a bit more.


Conclusion


Neptune Technologies now has $0.70 per share in cash, but is planning to spend the
majority of it in the coming year in an attempt to resurrect its business. Neptune has
never generated a profit in its history and it currently has no factory, no product, no
revenue and just 10 full-time employees.


After one and a half months, the company has still received no insurance monies and
previous disclosure alerted investors to the fact that it may receive none.


Until the company receives and can provide clarity on its own survival prospects, the only
justifiable value for the shares is a slight premium to its current cash per share value of
$0.70.


The share price is currently being supported by buying, which has resulted from heavy
promotional efforts and astronomical share price targets made by authors and John
Thomas Financial who have either lacked any substantiation or who have cited facts
about Neptune that are outright wrong.


When the promotion-driven buying stops, the share price can be expected to quickly
find a level more reflective of its current value.

The recent volatility in the stock has caused a spike in the price of the call options
despite the low likelihood of any rise in the share price over the coming months and
investors who choose to sell call options can potentially realize a near-term profit of
20%-30% if the stock declines or even if the stock stays flat. At current option prices,
this strategy also avoids any losses as long as the share price stays below $3.00. For
this leg of the trade, these results apply to both long and short investors.

Some of the smartest guys on Wall Street have their money in this stock for a reason. Talk about kicking a company
when they're down simply so the hedge funds and shorters network can make more money. WOW! I'm loading up at
these levels. Thank you!

Good rebuttal Michael. The author provided dozens of key reasons why he believes the stock is crap and you
counter with hope and prayer since you realize you are going to lose big money on these failed trades.

Nice hit piece by a guy who only seems to write hit pieces and has no profile. I wonder if someone is paying him to
write these?


of course the author makes no mention of the efficacy data seen in today's Acasti release. I'd suggest you listen to the
words of more credible sources:


from today's ACASTI release:


Dr. Harlan Waksal, Executive Vice-President, Business and Scientific Affairs was quoted in the news release,

"We are pleased with the progress of our clinical efforts. Most notably, we are very satisfied with the significant impact
on triglycerides, even in this hard to treat population of patients in the lower strata of hypertriglyceridemia. Achieving
statistical significance with such a low number of patients and only after a short eight-week treatment period definitely
encourages us to push our strategy forward towards US clinical studies and validation during the upcoming year".


In response to this morning’s news release Hugh Cleland, Fund Manager at BluMont Capital, said the following:


“This is excellent data. In addition to showing the best trig reduction BY FAR in patients with high triglycerides relative
to the 3 competing fish oil drugs, it showed decreases in LDL, AND increases in HDL, something none of GSK,
Amarin nor Omthera showed with their drugs in patients with high triglycerides. It appears we not only have the "best-
in-class" fish oil drug, we have something special”.


“I believe we now have even more visibility on CaPre being a drug that should sell more than $1billion/year (like
GSK’s Lovaza), and could very well become a serious blockbuster (multiple billions/year)”.

More credible sources isn't this the same guy that went to jail for Imclone insider trading? I don't consider that
to credible do you?

The only blockbuster possessed by Neptune was the 20 megaton manufacturing plant in Quebec

Why do you say that this article is promotional: http://seekingalpha.co... If anything, it states in its title that NEPT is
speculative, and you quote the author's stating problems with the business. Also, they are not invested in it. I also do
not see any price target listed in the article. It seems to only state that a strong selloff could bring out a good buy
price.

The article leaves out the most important asset, intellectual properties and patents. The author values the company
based on cash on hand, if this was a common way of biotech valuation, most biotechs would be penny stock.

Good point. Amarin would love to have NEPT's patent portfolio, not to mention CaPre.

Perhaps a timeout anecdote from an honest consumer (me) may be warranted here among the Bulls and Bears of
Neptune---their krill oil product works marvelously, be assured!


As one who has tried other krill companies for my cholesterol issues with fair success, Neptune's krill results simply
blew them away with superior results. (I don't know why that is, but my doctor is amazed in overcoming her
skepticism).


The tragedy that's befallen the Neptune brand is heart wrenching indeed, but there's no way these fabulous healthy
pills of oily gold can merely vanquish from the marketplace. It's a good guess as they regain their footing, they'll be
back in a big way. In the meantime, I've horded a dozen large bottles of NKO while they're still available.

He shorts the stock and then writes a decidedly negative article about the company. How is this a good article? He
makes some valid points but implies much worse than the facts in evidence. There is NO evidence to suggest that the
positive research reports were written by anyone other than reputable analysts (try reading them). There is NO
evidence that the company will not receive insurance proceeds. He quotes the company's conservative boilerplate
language. That is a risk factor. Ever read a prospectus? And he gives NO value to 61% ownership in a biotech
company that just received generally positive interim results from its Phase II trials. The assertion that Acasti may not
have access to capital if and when it passes Phase II is simply wrong. Buyouts, joint partnerships and capital raises
are standard at that point in the process. Someone should investigate Mr Pearson for stock manipulation.

let's check the math 
$.70 in cash PLUS 
$1.75 in Acasti stock (48 million shares of Acasti trading at $2.20 with 60 million Neptune out) 
That comes to $2.45 with no value for anything else and the stock is trading at $1.63

Mark Q.
From the article below, it seems that about $.33 per share is expected for insurance,without taking into account
business disruption insurance. That would bring the value to $2.78 just taking into account the insurance, cash and
the market value of the Acasti stock as of yesterday (actually its a bit higher today) At that, the figures are still low
because Acasti is up a bit today. That figure still ignores the value of the patents, the business, the continuing income
stream during the shut down that is mentioned by the CEO in the article, the new plant this is almost completed, etc.,
etc


The figures of the author of this Seeking Alpha piece seem to be off by a wider margin than can be attributed to mere
blundering. This is so even as regards something so trivial as the difference between the 10 employees that the
author says the company still has,and the 50 that the C.E.O talks about in the article. I'd be interested in the author's
response.


(Reuters) - Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc (NTB.TO) (NEPT), a Canadian maker of nutritional
supplements whose plant was destroyed by fire in November, plans to resume significant production in six to nine
months, its chief financial officer said, rejecting an online article that said "meaningful" production would restart only in
2014.


Neptune's shares fell sharply for a second day on Tuesday following an article on investment website
seekingalpha.com that said meaningful production would not restart for more than a year. http://bit.ly/VQh0mY


An explosion and fire destroyed Neptune's plant in Sherbrooke, Quebec on November 8, killing three employees.


Neptune's shares, which fell about 26 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday in what brokers said was in
response to the article, were down another 8 percent on Tuesday.


Neptune harvests krill, or tiny deepwater crustaceans that resemble shrimp, and processes them to be used in
cosmetics and nutritional supplements as an alternative to vegetable oils.


Chief Financial Officer André Godin told Reuters on Tuesday that production would restart next year, with another
factory in Sherbrooke coming on line in about six months.


Godin said the destroyed plant was insured for about $20 million and that the money would be used to optimize the
existing facility, which had worked in conjuction with the factory that was leveled.


"We want to diversify the source of production in regard to manufacturing in the future and we are in negotiation with
several industrial partners to have production outside Canada," he added.


Godin also rejected the article's assertion that the company had no revenue and that it had only 10 employees.


"We will generate krill oil revenues in the interim period until our plant is back to production by tapping multiple
sources," he said, adding that the company still had about 50 employees after cutting 70 jobs in November.

The author just made 30% or more by doing a great job of scaring the 80% retail. His arguments aren't without merit,
but he is most definitely characterizing the worst of the information and according to management's information, some
of his information appears patently false (like the employee count of the company).


This is a guy who has written 14 articles, none of which I have yet to see on small biotechs. As a guy who comes from
a marketing background, I find it interesting his use of "bold" in this article - his article is guilty of promotion if you ask
me. I would not make these accusations if the man himself wasn't short the stock.


This company owns 61% of Acasti = $100M. It has $30M + in cash (the $.70 per share). According to the press
release today it's getting another $20M potentially in insurance (although it will be spent). And it's valuing the current
nutra business at nothing. The stock is essentially trading at below NAV now.


On some level we should thank the author. On another level, we should hope he's investigated, should it prove some
of his information was patently false and given the style of the article. I also find it interesting the timing of his article. I
think without a question he exploited the article for his own benefit.

Acasti (ACPHF) trades by appointment, has a book value of .17 per share, and a return on equity of -71.8%.
Both Acasti and Neptune will need to raise more funds. The recent filing of a securities fraud lawsuit against
Neptune may make it harder to sell new shares, whether or not the suit has merit. Neptune has stated that
the lawsuit is totally without merit.


APO.V, the Canadian symbol for Acasti, does trade more - 37,000 shares/day last 3 months. And NEPT holds
warrants for 6.75 million APO.V shares, currently at 2.22, to buy at 2.30. So there is time value in the
warrants. Plus NEPT already owns 57% of Acasti,more than 40 million shares (48 million according to
previous poster). So there is both a bull and a bear case in NEPT.


But trying to sell 48 million shares into a daily volume of 37,000 tells me NEPT can't just convert its stake in
Acasti into cash - even if there is a big drug trial success soon.

I love it when I get these calls as I did for NEPT when it was still above 4. Everything shorts better with JTF on it

I just read the short article and all the comments following it. And here we are 7-8 months later- production and
revenue underway- quarterly rev of $6 mil - but with larger losses- stock price recently hitting 4.20 and now back to
3.56 in a matter of days-- the roller coaster continues- the stock acts like it's going higher not lower. The Conf call on
the latest quarter seemed to support the notion that the company is making real progress in their manufacturing
partnerships and their sales efforts. I bought more stock today- am I crazy or setting up for the next run to $4.50 per
share?
