Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest,
Product Failure And Paid Stock Promotion

Summary


EKSO insider Adam Gottbetter jailed for fraud, while other EKSO individuals face
further allegations. SEC's FOIA shows EKSO facing (or faced?) law enforcement
investigation, where is EKSO's disclosure on this?


Boston Dynamics states "nothing to do with EKSO" and any work together
completed months ago, Lockhead states FORTIS "not an Ekso product" and
"independently designed" by LMT and Robrady.


Previously presented EKSO “Charter Clinics” now supporting competing products,
and stating competitor products are superior. Industry shift towards rental/lease
leaves under-capitalized EKSO in an impossible situation.


Huge global companies now competing with EKSO and demonstrably superior and
cheaper products. EKSO's founder left the company and founded competing
company with 1/3 the price and 1/2 the weight.


Accelerating cash burn, product failure and EKSO's financial architect jailed for fraud
as insiders register to sell stock with paid stock promotion make 35x sales and
~$200m valuation clearly unsustainable.


I believe EKSO is an offensive reverse-merger where insider and EKSO's financial
architect, responsible for temporarily dodging a 2013 EKSO bankruptcy, was recently
jailed for fraud. Furthermore, a SEC FOIA response received shows EKSO is facing, or
faced, a law enforcement investigation. I am shocked to find no EKSO disclosure, which
leaves investors in the dark about the extent of any potential issues or what is going on.

Industry research also shows EKSO is now nothing more than a "hype machine" with no
hope of commercial success. Multiple large global juggernauts have apparently displaced
EKSO at many of the company's past "Charter Clinics" as previous partners now tout
competitor's products as superior.


An analysis of all EKSO employees on LinkedIn show the company imploding internally as
key employees depart en-masse. Despite having just 69 full-time employees, in the past
few years, EKSO has churned through ~100 employees, with 2/3 of them not even lasting
past 1 year. Successful businesses about to rapidly grow sales do not have this kind of
attrition, leading me to believe EKSO's sales ramp is impossible.


With less than $6m of revenue and -$15m per year cash burn, EKSO will run out of cash
again in early 2016. EKSO's CEO Nathan Harding presided over near-bankruptcy in 2013
and was forced to stop paying approximately half of EKSO employees. The only
meaningful capital the company has been able to raise was done with partners now jailed
for fraud or charged with other violations. With those sketchy partners unavailable, when
EKSO's cash runs out in ~9 months, I expect the company's bankruptcy is likely. Given
everything above, EKSO's current ~$200m valuation, or >35x revenue, is clearly absurd
and I believe is only temporarily possible due to EKSO's >60% unsophisticated retail
shareholder base and EKSO's paid stock promotion. Supporting this view, EKSO insiders
have registered to sell stock.


I applaud any medical patients finding any relief from any offering anywhere, but from an
investor and financial standpoint EKSO is an obvious disaster that is imploding as we
speak. Generously valuing EKSO similar to peers shows imminent -84.51% downside with
more likely outcome of bankruptcy and total investor wipeout, similar to other Adam
Gottbetter deals and stocks using paid stock promotion (more below).


EKSO Insider and Financial Architect Adam Gottbetter Jailed for Fraud

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


Ironically named, Adam Gottbetter is the financial architect and creator of EKSO through
the reverse merger and financing which temporarily helped EKSO avoid bankruptcy in
2013 when EKSO ran out of cash and was forced to stop paying ~50% of its workforce.


Adam Gottbetter was an EKSO insider as we can see where he is listed as EKSO contact
person for this 11/2013 EKSO SEC filing. I believe that without Gottbetter, EKSO would
have clearly gone bankrupt in 2013 when EKSO basically ran out of money and had to
"pause" the company for nearly a year. Unfortunately for EKSO shareholders, Adam
Gottbetter recently pleads guilty to fraud and is serving time in jail, according to
thedeal.com:


"Investment bank Gottbetter Capital Markets LLC arranged at least 15 PIPEs from
2008 through May 2014, raising $96.1 million for companies including Ekso
Bionics Holdings Inc.……..The SEC action against Gottbetter included allegations
that he and others manipulated shares…"


Adam Gottbetter: Not Smiling Anymore…

You can find the SEC's press release here:


"The three rehearsed stories they would tell if ever questioned by law enforcement.
During one meeting in New York City, Gottbetter complained about the
difficulties of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the
only other way to make so much money so quickly."

Offensively, Adam seems to have used his gains to finance a lavish lifestyle, including a
$12.9 million Manhattan penthouse, complete with separate $1m living quarters for his
maid.


Gottbetter's playbook was simple: acting as attorney, he helped low-quality companies
with no hope of future success (like EKSO seems to be) go public via reverse-merger. His
firm Gottbetter Capital Markets provided necessary cash where Gottbetter would get a
piece of the action so he could, after promotional campaigns kicked in, dump his stock on
the market before it collapses worthlessly.


In an embarrassingly bad interview with disgraced stock tout Tobin Smith, Gottbetter took
the opportunity to promote Gran Tierra Energy (NYSEMKT:GTE) as one of the most
"successful deals he was ever involved in." Gran Tierra was later exposed by Barron's as
a hard glossy-mailer stock promotion campaign in which Gottbetter participated. Another
attorney in the Gran Tierra scandal was charged by the SEC for securities fraud and it
appears Gottbetter regularly partnered with individuals charged with penny stock
manipulation.


One of the broker dealers named alongside Gottbetter in the EKSO Form D is "EDI
Financial" which was recently censored by FINRA for allegedly making inappropriate
private placement investments while "Dinosaur Securities LLC" also participated with
Gottbetter and has also had many alleged disciplinary problems with FINRA. This
5/7/2014 S-1 filing shows EKSO insiders associated with Gottbetter registered to sell an
estimated 950,912 shares while on the other side of the trade (unsurprisingly) we find
62%+ of EKSO shares are held by unsophisticated retail investors. Does this seem fair to
you?


I believe it is obvious that EKSO management must know what is going on as the
company's CEO Nathan Harding co-signed SEC documents with Adam Gottbetter while
even a basic Google search shows numerous concerning allegations against Gottbetter
and associates going back to at least 2007. Why did Nathan Harding and EKSO willingly
choose to partner with Gottbetter, when they should have Knewbetter? Are these the kind
of people you should trust or give your hard-earned money to?


To decipher a pattern for EKSO, let's look at other Gottbetter deals:

EKSO Also Partnered with Opaleye's James Silverman, Who Faced Insider Trading
Charges


Shockingly, it's not just Gottbetter as James Silverman's Opaleye Management is EKSO's
second largest shareholder and has recently been attempting to sell EKSO stock.
Opaleye, previously known as "Risk Reward Capital", was apparently pursued for insider
trading by the Secretary of the State of Massachusetts who accused Silverman of using
an "expert network" to obtain inside information in a quest to improve dismal returns.


*Edit/update: I am told Silverman and Massachusettes settled their differences in an out-
of-court settlement


SEC filings show Silverman owns 10.9m shares of EKSO through Opaleye and Silverman
Insurance Partnership, making him one of EKSO's largest shareholders. In a March 25,
2015, securities registration, Silverman is listed as attempting to sell at least 2,000,000 (!!)
shares of EKSO stock which Silverman/Opaleye acquired in January 2014 directly, with
Gottbetter (from CapitalIQ):


"Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. announced a private placement on best efforts basis of
20,580,000 units at $1 per unit for gross proceeds of $20,580,000 on January 15,
2014. Each unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant.
Each warrant is exercisable at $2 per share for a period of five years. The
transaction included participation from Opaleye L.P, a fund managed by Opaleye
Management Inc., Montrose Capital Group, LLC, and other investors. Gottbetter
Capital Markets, LLC, acted as the exclusive placement agent for the best efforts
transaction and EDI Financial, Inc. acted as a sub-agent."


Interestingly, within months of Gottbetter's EKSO reverse merger, both Silverman and
Gottbetter filed to sell a large amount of stock in 5/2014. Curiously just prior to this, EKSO
stock "mysteriously" rallied dramatically for no apparent reason. Given charges of market
manipulation to people associated with EKSO, you can make your own speculations how
and why that happened. Regardless, we know one thing with certainty: EKSO insiders
were in a hurry to sell stock as EKSO worked with the SEC in an attempted acceleration
of its registration effective date:


Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc., hereby requests that the Securities and Exchange
Commission accelerate the effective date of the above-referenced Registration
Statement"

5/22/2018 Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest, Product Failure And Paid Stock Promotion - Ekso Bionics Holdings, In…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


EKSO's questionable insiders clearly missed that very brief "window" when EKSO stock
rallied as the original offering appears to have failed. Tellingly though, (see below),
insiders have once again filed to sell stock (at a much lower price) while EKSO stock has
more than doubled off the bottom, again for no apparent reason.


Unsurprisingly, Silverman and Gottbetter affiliates have again filed to sell a large amount
of EKSO stock in a March 2015 registration. Affiliates of Gottbetter also registered to sell
stock in this filing, although it's unclear what will happen to Gottbetter's EKSO stock now
that he's in jail, will it be dumped onto the market? If EKSO was such an amazing
opportunity why would insiders register to sell stock at $2 or lower?


SEC's FOIA Response: EKSO Subject of an Ongoing Law Enforcement
Investigation?


Given what we have seen above, I find this SEC FOIA response received last year to be
concerning.

We know FOIA 7(a) exemptions are used during active law enforcement investigations.
We also know, from the Gottbetter trial, that he received a lighter trial by supplying
additional information about his associates so we don't know how deep that investigation
is or who it may be targeting. Since EKSO has not disclosed any information about this, I
don't know what is going on exactly, but with EKSO's financial architect in jail sharing
information with federal authorities, along with all the other EKSO issues explained below,
I am very concerned.


The EKSO "HYPE MACHINE": Partnerships Overblown? and Paid Stock Promotion


Consistent with the Gottbetter playbook, EKSO claims vague "partnerships" with random
companies and uses paid stock promotion by the dubious offshore firm Edison whose
reports appear dressed up to look like real Wall Street research but fine print clarifies

seem to just be paid stock promotion:


(credit Edison "Research")


In this light I find interesting, EKSO's management consistently fails to disclose the
amount or extent of any partnership it gets while playing "fast and loose" with the facts.
For example, EKSO touts incessantly hype a Boston Dynamics relationship which
curiously had zero quotes from Boston Dynamics itself in the press release. It seems this
"partnership" was so important that it didn't even merit a single public statement by Boston
Dynamics.


Further research to Boston Dynamics resulted in the response "we have nothing to do with
that company" with an abrupt end to the conversation. A second email from Boston
Dynamics confirmed any relationship that ever existed ended months ago.


EKSO touts also repeatedly promote past work with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) but a
call to LMT confirmed FORTIS is "not an EKSO product" and "Fortis was independently
developed by Lockheed Martin with support from Robrady Design". Further research with
Robrady design also turns up zero mention of EKSO but instead states it was a Lockheed
Martin project which was apparently gone through "from the ground up". What is really
going on here? Until Lockheed Martin comes out with a public press release clarifying this,
I don't think any of us know what reality is.


Not that it even matters though as EKSO's SEC filings state after 2017 LMT will have
exclusive rights to the military market anyway, cutting EKSO off regardless, while there is
no hope of EKSO competing against a globally dominant manufacturing company like
LMT in any capacity. No wonder insiders want to cash out, who could blame them?


Lastly, on the Q4 call investors asked EKSO management for any color (at all?!) on the
latest claimed agreement with Ottobock. Unsurprisingly, EKSO management refused to
provide any color on the extent, financial terms or really anything at all and simply passed
over the question instead responding with vague and useless "validation" hype.

EKSO has also repeatedly fed investors false promises about its own future and
repeatedly missed its own goals. For instance, after originally saying EKSO would have a
home use personal product done by 2013, in this article EKSO stated in 2012 it would
have a personal mobility device by 2014. Then in this later article EKSO also stated again
and again it would have a personal EKSO in the market in 2014. Despite all this hype
about EKSO entering the home market, in EKSO SEC filings (where the consequences of
deception are much higher) EKSO states its "exploration of this potential market is in the
very early stages".


I believe this is likely because in the ReWalk (NASDAQ:RWLK) FDA disclosures we can
see that a consistent speed for 10m+ of 0.40 meters per second (a function of necessary
time to cross a street) as apparently critical. Unfortunately, the EKSO suit is just too weak
and clumsy to ever achieve this speed hurdle by the comfortable margin it seems is
necessary for FDA approval, effectively making FDA clearance for the home market an
impossibility for EKSO's suit.


The only financial details I can find on EKSO partnerships are that EKSO has generated
just ~$1m in total licensing revenue since inception, which is immaterial for a ~$200m
valued company. We also know if one customer is 10% of revenue, all public companies
are required by the SEC to disclose that. So if EKSO announces a partnership without
mention of financial terms and it is not disclosed in detail in SEC filings you can know that
it may be anywhere between $0 of revenue to 9.99% of revenue, which given EKSO's tiny
total revenue, is telling.


EKSO Technology Already Failing, With Superior Products and Global Juggernauts
Entering the Market


Claims EKSO has superior technology are not grounded in reality and are likely spread by
individuals who have not done extensive work talking to people who actually use products
in the market. Not only is EKSO years behind the curve but, now that a few small
companies have been "first man over the wall", large global juggernauts with superior
R&D teams and endless cash are entering the market with superior products. Even more
concerning, EKSO is attempting to spread its tiny R&D budget across multiple end
markets, making success against larger and more focused competitors impossible.


Obviously, if EKSO were such a promising company it would not have partnered with
jailed fraudster or almost gone bankrupt in 2013 or forced into a sketchy "last resort"
reverse merger with a strange penny stock shell. Any company, from Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to LMT, could have bought EKSO for pennies at

that point and (tellingly) they chose not to. I think EKSO was already behind the
technology curve back in 2013 due to financial stress. Once EKSO was forced to
effectively put the company on pause for nearly a year and stop paying employees, EKSO
effectively died forever at that point and, in this hyper competitive industry against better
funded global competitors, crushed any hope of future success.


With this in mind you should not find my following chart comparing the available
exoskeleton products surprising. This estimated chart was painstakingly built by talking to
multiple people in the industry and digging through countless presentations, and is
(unsurprisingly) not something you see in EKSO's paid "analyst reports".

I applaud anyone walking in these suits, but clearly RWLK technology is light years ahead
of EKSO's crude offering. We can see here RWLK technology has been capable of going
up and down stairs since at least 2011 and is the only suit approved for home use, having
been FDA approved almost a year ago now. This RWLK technology superiority is also
why RWLK was used by this inspirational patient to complete the London marathon as far
back as 2012.

Not only that but RWLK's product list price is $60k as far back as 2013, I don't need to
remind you this is nearly HALF of the price EKSO quotes for their device while RWLK's
device has ~125k different combinations of personal adjustments, making it far better
suited for individual ownership.


RWLK is clearly the leader in home use at the moment as its motors are the strongest and
the fastest walking speeds are clocked in this suit. Furthermore, RWLK uses Samina for
outsourced manufacturing which will allow it to scale while EKSO is trying to build its suits
itself in an old warehouse.


Most importantly, Parker Hannifin's (NYSE:PH) superior Indego product is coming to
market in a matter of months, and proves to be both vastly superior and years ahead of
anything else available. The lightweight modular design and financing options will allow it
to sweep the home market, while the balance sheet of Parker Hannifin and integrated FES
therapy will allow it to revolutionize the rehab market. Indego also had variable assist way
back in 2012, and RWLK has had partial assistance for a long time as well but EKSO
didn't announce this until 2013, with an egregious $20k cost!


For example, we can see below the Indego is thin enough to wear in a wheelchair
(GAME):

Indego also has no big bulky backpack to get in the way like the EKSO suit has.

Indego's FES functionality is even more revolutionary for the rehab market as Clare
Hartigan, MPT at Shepherd Center, elaborates:


"(Indego) Incorporating FES into gait is a huge advantage."


It's not just ReWalk and Indego though as there are literally dozens of companies out in
front of EKSO with superior products approved around the globe from Cyberdyne's HAL to
many others. Cyberdyne products have been tested in 200 rehab centers in Japan and
are in use both in Germany and the US already. Cyberdyne has sold over 350 units and is
just getting started where even the prototype was used to carry a paraplegic friend near
the top of Swiss Mountain Breithorn. While EKSO is controlled by buttons, Osurus literally
has skin implants that read your brain through your skin and nerve endings!

Meanwhile, Honda (NYSE:HMC) is already leasing 100 of its walking assistance
exoskeletons in Japan since 2013. With worker assistance devices in testing as well, and
devices already in trials in Chicago.


I could go on and on but you get the picture. The only positive thing I could find about
EKSO was that, due to its crude design and limited adjustments, in a rehab clinic setting it
is easy to get new patients into the suit fast because the adjustments are limited and
simple. Literally everything else is inferior from what I heard and can deduce. Once RWLK
rolls out variable assist and Indego rolls out with FES and other superior features and a
better sales team, there will be no reason for anyone to buy an EKSO suit.


Lastly, spinal cord injuries are already being cured with stem cells and that technology will
relentlessly improve in coming years. Owning EKSO is, in some ways, a bet against stem
cells and biotech innovation, which is not a bet any smart investor should make.

If you still honestly think EKSO is a technology leader just look at what Honda (Asimo
demo here) and Boston Dynamics' amazing Atlas humanoid robot are capable of. Then
watch EKSO's old, unimpressive technology and you will see why no company acquired
EKSO back in 2013 before it imploded the first time.


Previous EKSO "Charter Clinics" Now Support Competitors With Superior Products


As further evidence of EKSO failure, we see clinics EKSO previously stated were key
partners now endorsing competing products as superior. EKSO previously hyped on past
quarterly calls its top "Charter Centers" as key industry supporters, selecting who they felt
where the most important centers to work with to be supporters and champions for EKSO.

Unfortunately for EKSO, the majority of these centers are now endorsing competitor
products. Craig Hospital, CO for example was the clinic to take first delivery of the first
EKSO GT suit and was working with Berkeley Bionics and EKSO since at least 2011 but is
now a listed partner for Parker Hannifin with Indego.

We see Indego partners here, while Mount Sinai center uses RWLK for patients as does
Spaulding Rehab and TIRR Memorial. Furthermore, RWLK's multi-year head start means
RWLK is in 8 of the top 10 clinics in the US already.

Shepherd Center is widely regarded as the single best rehab center in America. It is one
of few centers to have used all three available exoskeletons and, tellingly, it is apparently
endorsing Indego, the Parker Hannifin product, as the best product available. Pardon the
long quote but this is an absolutely critical read:

"Shepherd Center has a world-class reputation in the field of rehabilitation and we
are proud they have chosen to support us in the commercialization of Indego,"
said Craig Maxwell, Vice President of Technology and Innovation for Parker.
"Shepherd Center is the only rehabilitation facility to have tested Indego and
the two other devices currently being marketed by other companies as
exoskeletons."


"We see distinct advantages in Indego, including its lightweight and modular
design that promotes independence," said Gary R. Ulicny, Ph.D, President and CEO
of Shepherd Center. "From a rehabilitation perspective, we applaud Indego's ability
to vary the degree of robotic assistance and the use of electrical stimulation
based on the user's level of function."


"the Center has concluded that Indego has the most promise as a device for both
rehabilitation and home use."


"Indego is the only robotic exoskeleton that can be worn by a person while in his or
her own wheelchair, as well as in a vehicle or even a restaurant booth," said Clare
Hartigan, a physical therapist at Shepherd Center who leads the clinical research.
"The device can be used for mobility on all surfaces, including stairs."


"We are impressed with how easy Indego is for people to use, as well as its
potential to provide compensatory gait for those with motor complete injuries, in
addition to its rehabilitative potential for those who are motor incomplete," Hartigan
said. "The level of independence Indego offers is unprecedented."


The most shocking aspect of all of this is that the Paker Hannifin Indego product hasn't
even been formally released to the market fully yet. It is hitting Europe this summer and
should be for sale in US shortly after. As this marketing effort and financing (or rental)
terms become formalized this momentum is only expected to increase, and will be
devastating for EKSO has inferior technology and who does not have the cash flow
necessary to support a rental/lease program.


EKSO Industrial Push: Thinly Veiled Desperation and Failure


I believe it is clear EKSO's pending failure in the rehab market and irrelevance in the
personal/home market are why EKSO is now desperately touting the industrial market.
Unfortunately, here EKSO is also irrelevant and years behind the curve while competing
with impossibly sophisticated and capitalized global manufacturing juggernauts.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


In this space it seems we are now seeing products from Panasonic, Boeing (NYSE:BA),
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), Honda, Daewoo and Cyberdyne, among many others entering
the able-bodied markets. EKSO has zero hope of success against companies like this.


Panasonic's "Powerloader" for example will be sold at $5k and take 30 seconds to put on.
Raytheon just spun out SARCOS, which just got jump started with serious board members
and VC backing with obviously superior products here, here and here while the military
has stated it is now building its own purpose build Navy device anyway. This whole shift is
behind the curve in my view anyway, as helping people hold heavy grinders misses the
true mega-trend of robotic manufacturing replacing humans entirely.


Note that EKSO didn't announce its own passive exoskeleton for construction until
12/2014. If the previously touted LMT relationship was going so well why would EKSO do
this? Why would EKSO now try to compete with its own partners? Do you honestly believe
tiny, underfunded EKSO can out-manufacture Honda, Panasonic, Boeing and Daewoo??


If I need to expand on this later I can, but this will obviously never be a viable business for
EKSO and, in my view, is clearly a desperate attempt to have something it can hype to
keep the stock from continuing its collapse.


As I look into my time machine I can predict how it seems the disastrous 2015 EKSO
movie will play out. I expect into Q4-2015 and especially Q1-2016 EKSO's business will
start to nose over bad and failure will be impossible to ignore. At that point, as cash burn
accelerates and EKSO becomes increasingly desperate, I believe we need to be wary of
increasingly promotional and worthless press releases about vague "partnerships" and
even tiny amounts of unprofitable commercial end market revenue. We know EKSO will
require cash to survive sometime in Q1 2016 which means it will likely attempt to raise
cash in Q4 2015. Since EKSO failed at this last time, I think it will fail again.


EKSO Previous "Go To Market" Strategy Failed and EKSO Facing Impossible Market
Dynamics


Even worse, there are tectonic shifts occurring right now in the exo skeleton market,
unrelated to technology, which will destroy EKSO.


Tellingly, this last quarter we saw EKSO announce it is shifting its sales strategy towards
renting suits. What EKSO investors are missing is this dynamic creates insurmountable
balance sheet and cash flow issues for EKSO while also demonstrating customers don't
see the value proposition that justifies an outright purchase.

The key issue is if a clinic rents or leases a suit, EKSO is forced to pay cash for the suit up
front and hold it in inventory or as an asset. Each one of these suits costs EKSO at least
$60k+ of cash up front and as EKSO's operating cash burn is also set to accelerate, will
pull forward EKSO's inevitable demise and cash requirement. This working capital
dynamic is absolutely critical, as I estimate every 15 suits EKSO tries to rent or lease will
require ~$1m of cash use off its balance sheet in addition to -$1.5m per month operating
cash burn.


Furthermore, no off balance sheet debt financing partner will finance this. EKSO's suits
are rapidly changing and its future value is impossible to ascertain. Furthermore, without
EKSO support and maintenance (which would disappear in bankruptcy) those suits are
essentially worthless, while EKSO lack of earnings or cash flow certainly cannot support
any level of debt.


This is A KEY ADVANTAGE Parker Hannifin has, which is Parker Hannifin can finance
suits off its own balance sheet nearly for free with the $2b+ cash Parker has on hand.
Furthermore, RWLK is a much more focused company with ~$40m in cash (nearly twice
the cash balance of EKSO). This means EKSO is the financially weakest player in the
market who is too underfunded to compete and left in an untenable position that cannot be
sustained, especially as increased industry competition begins to compress pricing and
drive revenue/asp declines.


All of this ignores the fact EKSO is trying to simultaneously work on the very different
military, commercial, rehab and individual/home markets all simultaneously. This is also
clearly impossible and spreading a very small and vulnerable company far too thin. Given
poor management quality at EKSO, I don't find this surprising, and given EKSO's previous
go to market strategy seems to have failed, I sense a repeating pattern set to occur.


EKSO Creator Left: Started A Competitor With Superior Products


Undisputed robotics genius Professor Kazerooni was the original founder of EKSO and
the one who seems responsible for its technology. He left EKSO and seems to have
founded a competing exoskeleton company called US Bionics which has a product
coming to market priced at just $15k while looking very effective, lightweight and thin
enough to be worn in a wheelchair which Japanese manufacturers apparently already
want.

Just to remind you, Kazerooni was the godfather of EKSO and I believe the one
responsible for essentially all of EKSO's foundational technology with over 40 patents to
his name personally. He built the Berkley Bionics lab from the ground up and put together
the team there so very telling I believe that his out and gunning for EKSO now.


If I was going to invest in anything in this space I would invest in US Bionics and genius
Kazerooni who, along with ReWalk and Vanderbuilt, are the only people in exo-bionics
with a track record of success. The people left in charge of EKSO are a mere shadow of
the original team and if EKSO was such an amazing opportunity with an atmosphere of
innovation why didn't Kazerooni stay and develop his products inside EKSO?


EKSO Imploding Internally, Employees Flee En-Masse As Cash Burn Accelerates


Management of companies burning through tens of millions of dollars and on the edge of
insolvency often blather unrealistic hype. What they often don't discuss is reality.


I believe EKSO's own employees show us that EKSO is imploding internally. Despite only
69 full time employees, I estimate that EKSO has churned through nearly 100 employees
in just the past few years. Of these employees we can see the average tenure is
estimated at just ~1.5 years!

(chart created by me with public Linkedin Profile info)


Key positions across all EKSO departments including head of sales, marketing,
engineering and operations have all experienced shocking levels of turnover with key
people leaving in droves. I don't see how a company in such turmoil could possibly be a
successful, happy work environment driving innovation or effective sales strategies.
EKSO's former VP of Marketing and COO recently both departed for competitor LIM
Innovations while Glenn Davis, a highly qualified senior executive from Siemens left
EKSO in less than a year.

How can you have a marketing ramp if the Vice President of Marketing, Vice President
America's, COO, and Director of EMEA all recently left as the company experiences
staggering turn over?


EKSO has had three CEOs just since 2010 as well, from Bruce Borup to Eythor Bender
and now Nathan Harding, who has the least management experience of any of them and
presided over partnerships with convicted fraudster Gottbetter as well as coming within an
inch of bankruptcy. I have less than zero faith in his competence and assume that is why
EKSO previously had outside CEOs.


It should be clear to others as well. In March of 2014, EKSO claimed it was at a "key point
of growth" even though it furloughed nearly 50% of its workforce in 2013 and then showed
virtually flat revenue growth throughout 2014 at less than $6 million of sales.


Also concerning, EKSO has told investors in its 10-K filing it plans to hire 15-20 more
employees in the next few months but if you look at the "Careers" section of the EKSO
website you will find zero sales positions listed and the page hasn't been updated properly
in awhile.


Furthermore, EKSO's current manufacturing capacity is tiny at best and I see no
production positions being hired for either? I estimate EKSO's current plant and employee
annual manufacturing capacity at just a handful of units per year anyway and, best I can
tell, EKSO has never clarified exactly what its current plant and staff annual manufacturing
capacity anyway? EKSO management have dodged this question anytime it has been
raised, which is a huge red flag in my view, and if I were them I would do what superior
peer company RWLK did and fire the entire manufacturing team and outsource production
immediately.


EKSO Conflicted Wall Street "Analyst" Models Are Mathematically Impossible


As we've seen with UNIS, NEON, ARNA, KEYW, IWSY and countless cash-burning
worthless disasters, the lowest quality Wall Street banks are often blinded by the greed of
banking fees. This typically results in what investors call a "Sell Side Promotion" where
impossible "estimates" are put forth by bottom tier Wall Street banks in a fight to see who
can be most bullish to curry favor from garbage company management teams and secure
capital raise fees.


I think EKSO is one of the worst examples of this I've seen. Let's take classic "bank"
Ladenburg for example and review the steaming garbage they try to pass off as a financial
model.

(credit Ladenburg)


Ignoring the apparently delusional sales estimates, hilariously, Ladenburg's price target
assumes zero dilution and completely misses the working capital and cash dynamics
explained above.


If EKSO were really going to sell suits on the level Ladenburg fantasizes about, we can
run some simple math and see that would require EKSO to raise $252m+ of capital just for
inventory and working capital needs! Given EKSO's lack of fraud partner and $185m
market cap, these cash needs are obviously impossible. Just factoring in the necessary
dilution alone and using Ladenburg's own price target results in a stock price below
today's price… doesn't Ladenburg understand basic math?


Another absurd thing I want to point out is Ladenburg are forecasting ASP will actually
INCREASE into infinity by +4%. As we have seen, competition is increasing dramatically
and EKSO is already overpriced relative to competitive offerings while the company itself
has stated it will try and reduce pricing in the future. As we all know, for technology
adoption to occur, prices decrease, and we are already seeing that literally right now in the
bionics markets.


No real investor is going to buy this garbage and I find it offensive.

(pic credit me)


EKSO previously had -$1.3m of monthly cash burn and is guiding to increased hiring while
none of its commentary includes the increasing cash use the new exoskeleton lease/rental
dynamic will require. In 2014 alone we see EKSO lost -$33.7m and, given the above
dynamics we understand now, we can be sure that number is set to increase. Since EKSO
only has ~$20m in cash, we can see its previous guidance of survival until q2 2016 is no
longer realistic and EKSO will be forced to try and raise more cash much sooner.


Meanwhile EKSO Insiders Pillaging The Company For Millions, Shareholders Get
Destroyed by Dilution


Now that we understand EKSO is a financial disaster, created by jailed fraudster
Gottbetter and with no hope of commercial success, what are EKSO insiders doing with
this worthless mess?


(chart built by me)


Note that insider compensation in 2014 is 300% higher than 2013 and total compensation
is nearly what EKSO total 2014 revenue was. How have EKSO insiders and jailed
financing partner afforded these egregious payments? By absolutely pillaging their
shareholders with an unbelievable amount of dilution.

(chart built by me)


This is a crippling and unsustainable path of shareholder destruction and given everything
we've seen here, I'm not surprised EKSO could only raise money with the help of a jailed
fraudster and alleged stock price manipulator.


EKSO Cash Burn Increasing, Bankruptcy Inevitable, RWLK Clearly A Superior
Choice for Speculation


If you must speculate on exoskeleton stocks, EKSO seems clearly the "worst of the
worst". RWLK is a "real company" with credible management, has more product revenue,
more market share, is already FDA approved in both home and clinic, has vastly superior
technology with a cheaper exo product and is also a cheaper stock given lower $150m
market cap with ~$40m in cash, nearly twice the cash EKSO has.


Furthermore, RWLK is covered by real banks like Barclays and Jefferies, which coupled
with a real product and real management means it is much better equipped to raise
capital. Compare this to EKSO which is intertwined with countless people facing fraud and
other allegations and is surrounded by "Banks" like Ladenburg and HC Wainwright.


RWLK has "real", sophisticated, institutional investors supporting the company like
Yaskawa Electric and Israel Healthcare while EKSO is largely owned by unsophisticated
retail investors and a guy jailed for fraud.


For all these reasons and more, I believe it is obvious why RWLK had a "real" IPO
supported by real banks while EKSO was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, with
workers furloughed, and forced into a sketchy backdoor reverse-merger while partnering
with a jailed fraudster.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


If you insist on speculating in small, longshot, bionics companies then RWLK is obviously
a better choice and the cheaper stock. If you prefer venture capital or private businesses
then US bionics created by the individual responsible for EKSO's original technology is far
more exciting with a much higher chance of success.


EKSO Management Non-Response:


Repeated attempts to contact EKSO management in order to clarify the serious issues
discusses went unanswered. Furthermore, there appears to be zero way for EKSO
stockholders to contact the company they own directly. I view this lack of transparency
and shareholder communication to be a huge red flag and urge all EKSO stockholders to
directly contact the management team that is in charge of THEIR company immediately.
Furthermore, I look forward to public clarification of the many issues at play here as I am
very concerned.


EKSO Valuation


EKSO's temporarily stretched valuation of 35x revenue is clearly unsustainable and
absurd. I believe this crazy valuation is only possible due to paid stock promotion and
confused retail investors. Note EKSO is a manufacturing, medical equipment company
which is attempting to produce mechanical equipment in a Richmond warehouse, which is
both capital intensive, working capital intensive and not scalable. This is not a software or
biotech company that will have huge margins and can grow overnight.


Even hyper growth medical equipment companies with extremely bullish futures are
typically valued at ~5x revenue. I think EKSO is clearly a financial disaster and likely to go
bankrupt, but in the interest of being optimistic let's assume EKSO is worth what high
quality, growing peer medical-equipment companies are valued at.

(chart built by me)


As you can see, even in a "best case" scenario EKSO stock has -84.53% downside right
now. However, I think there is a good chance EKSO's coming capital raise fails and EKSO
just goes bankrupt in less than 12 months, leaving the stock worthless.

CONCLUSION: EKSO Is Clearly Fundamentally Worthless and Imploding


Any medical patient finding relief or making progress is a brave individual who gets
nothing but respect from me and this research has nothing to do with any of you out there.
I want to see injured people walk freely more than anyone and some of the companies in
this space will make great strides in the future to help people.


This is why I find EKSO with its fraud partnership, paid stock promotion and unrealistic
hype to be offensive and distasteful - it is destroying capital at the expense of real
companies doing excellent work in the exo-bionics field, and that hurt's all of us. I believe it
is obvious now that a sketchy reverse-merger led by people jailed for fraud and facing
other allegations, who enrich themselves to the tune of millions, while spending minimal
cash on R&D, are not going to be the ones to cure the world's problems.


The kind of true institutional investors required to feed EKSO's $15-20m+ cash burn
needs are going to require more than misleading "partnership" press releases and paid
stock promotion. It will require real revenue and earnings, neither of which EKSO is
capable of generating. This is why EKSO was on "death's door" in 2013, why nobody
bought it outright when it almost disappeared and why EKSO has never successfully
raised large-scale capital aside from when it partnered with jailed fraudster Gottbetter.
Now that he is in prison and unable to finagle money from questionable investment firms

Comments (116)


while Opaleye is neck deep in EKSO stock and clearly looking to sell, I think EKSO will fail
to raise the necessary capital and cease to exist. Not that it matters to insiders though as I
imagine they will keep their millions in compensation and any stocks sale proceeds.


I can only speculate on whatever law enforcement investigation EKSO may be facing, and
believe EKSO employees show EKSO is imploding as we speak. Fair value indicates
minimum -84.51% immediate "best case" downside for EKSO stock and, as the industry
continues to move to a lease/rent model which EKSO can't afford while its technological
inferiority becomes increasingly apparent, the stock will likely be vaporized in 2016 by
bankruptcy, similar to what EKSO experienced in 2013 when it previously failed to raise
capital.

I think you've got a lot of good data in this article, however your average time you have for employees should be
modified. Either an asterisk stating this 1.5 average years includes temporary interns or to remove interns from your
calculations. Interns are by no means meant to come on as permanent employees and shouldn't be treated as such in
your calculations.

02 Jun 2015, 11:53 AM


exoskeletonreport
I think this article really shows how we need to have websites, forums and wikis that are dedicated to
exoskeletons, wearable robotics and power suits. The average investor and the public are not informed of
what exoskeletons can and can not do at the moment. Too many videos show users being strapped in a
power suit, tossing their wheel chair to the side and repeatedly stating how they can walk normally, but
without anyone stating current technological limitations.


The public and investors need to have easily accessible educational material that shows the history of
exoskeleton research, technological goals, capabilities, hurdles and limitations. The Pump Stopper exploits
the ignorance of Ekso's products, and especially how they compare with those of other companies, to create
fear and confusion.

accurate.

whoever the author of this article is should be shivering right about now hoping EKSO's legal time doesn't see this
article and files a defamation lawsuit. I mean the graphs are cute, but really there has been no legit tie to any current
management of EKSO tied to this Gottbetter guy. His data is 3-4yrs old and when was or is it a crime for employees to
leave a company to explore other opportunities?  
Would you not think that perhaps, H.J Wainwright would certainly have exposed something like this???What about
the wall streeter's over the past few months, predicting double digit growth???


I'm just an investor, but reading this crap something just doesn't mesh. True, the financials are not fantastic, but that is
the case for most micro caps such as EKSO. For whatever the reason, something moved the needle north on this

Kraken Tamer
When your stock takes a hit like this, it would almost compel the company to make a response as I am sure that they
have noticed the price drop. Having read the "SEC press release" quote in the complaint, I know the SEC quote was
not alleged to have been said relative to EKSO but rather relative to DYNA and/or HBPE (¶7 of May 26, 2015
complaint)(not defending Gottbetter, just indicating what is actually alleged) and that EKSO is not one of the three
stocks which is alleged to have been manipulated. I am also generally aware that if the government is looking into
ALL Gottbetter transactions, the FOIA disclaimer would be issued about anything being investigated even if the
investigation did not reveal anything amiss about that particular set of transactions. All that being said, it is clear that
there are very serious allegations of impropriety made by the SEC against Gottbetter and his alleged conspirators.
Going forward and attempting to analyze the viability of the stock, it would seem most interesting to check out the
issues raised about inaccurate reports of affiliations with alleged customers, the use of corporate funds, technical
superiority/inferiority of the product and whether the accounting firm used by EKSO has failed to report something that
should have been reported. Hopefully the company will immediately address Pump Stopper's critique (one would
hope as to all allegations, completely) as it raises a lot of questions that deserve legitimate, verifiable answers that
one can take to the bank (be they good or bad).

No mention of the three new patents that Ekso was just awarded.. I believe there is a lot of misrepresentation here.
The NAVY designed Fortis with an outside engineering firm, however EKSO owns the patent and should be collecting
royalties. This article seems irrational in its exuberance. I guess Ekso is a good target for the boiler room
manipulation. I bet everyone who announced they are selling are shills working for the short sellers who are making a

I commend the author, as he is helping to foster a more efficient stock market and a better functioning economy. I
hope he continues his good work. Unfortunately, The Pump Stopper and other like-minded individuals are playing on
a very unlevel playing field against the pumpers out there. Look at Adam Gottbetter, he only got got 1.5 years despite
causing tens of millions of dollars in economic damage. Look at Tobin Smith, he continues his pumping ways while
probably raking in millions per year, legally. What these individuals are essentially doing are creating ponzi schemes.
When a stock makes a round trip to where it came from before a pumper got involved, it can only enrich people at the
expense of others, which is what a ponzi scheme does. Short-sellers are the primary weapon against pumpers, but
they are limited by borrowing availability, the cost of borrowing, and the risk of having a margin call that can
completely wipe the short-seller out before the trade is profitable. The laws need to be rewritten and the penalties
need to be harsher to better deter the pumpers out there. Conflict of interest disclosures in fine print are not enough.
At a minimum, paid promoters with abysmal long-term return track records should have to provide large bold faced
disclaimers at the top of the home page of their websites or at the beginning of their newsletters indicating that you
are much more likely to lose money than make money if you follow their recommendations.

I don't see how you compare anything regarding stock manipulation to a Ponzi scheme. Although Madoff
used a Ponzi scheme, he didn't manipulate stocks.. he directly defrauded his investors. Whether pump or
dump, at less than 2 dollars a share this is not a highly pumped stock. As a matter of fact, its hard to find any
commentary on it outside of SA and perhaps a few other boiler room operations. I'm not saying SA is boiler
room outright, however it is obviously providing a home for this type of operation. Whether you think this is
good or bad, I would say that overall this author is not unbiased (obviously). He is not operating
independently either. It doesn't take a genius to see that this is market manipulation at its finest.. print an
article and organize a short sale. This is very transparent, it's criminal and I hope they get caught.


As for short selling, more regulation needs to be in place. There are brokerages outside of the US that allow
naked short selling, which means I can sell 9 million shares without needing to have them covered by the
brokerage house. This unbalanced type of transaction will cause markets to be manipulated. I just hope it
backfires.


Thank you for your opinion.

I do not think you understand what a Ponzi scheme is. Real profit is real profit, regardless of how ethically it's
made. I feel obligated to point out that detracting from a stock with wildly alarmist statements as the author of
this article has done is precisely the same thing a pumper does, but in reverse. Stating that "short-sellers are
the primary weapon against pumpers" suggests that you believe they are fighting on the "good" side of a
moral battle, which in my opinion is a ridiculous argument. I trade on both sides with one goal: profit. The fact
is, this was a meticulously crafted article of (from what I can tell) mostly circumstantial pieces of information.
As others have pointed out, the author has conveniently presented only small pieces of information that fit his
hardline message, and has used unnecessary (and in my opinion irresponsible) superlative language and
insinuation to drive his message home: Sell. Sell! SELL!!! Of course, the author is short in EKSO, and stands
to profit if his message is heeded, just as the pumper profits if investors are duped by his message. Lastly, as
Bronxstu (and others) have pointed out, an organized bear raid is in fact...well, securities fraud. But commend
the author anyway, he clearly put more effort into his agenda than I ever do.

Prior to this piece, the idea behind my investment in EKSO was that it was a PIONEER in the exoskeleton market,
which I guess is not really the case. Also, the fact that it was once associated with a lawyer who is now in jail + the
fact that it has very weak financials makes me not want to take too much unnecessary risk, especially that value in
this space can be found elsewhere!


02 Jun 2015, 02:07 PM


Bronxstu
Why do you guess that's not the case? I wish I had multiple aliases to argue against the 'hive' however there
isn't one PURE PLAY exoskeleton company out there with good financials. If there is, show me one. ReWalk
is certainly not faring any better from a revenue standpoint.


02 Jun 2015, 02:26 PM


cerebral_rage
For a self-purported "risk management professional", I would've expected you to have a look at EKSO's
financials before making an investment, lol. Maybe things are done differently in London.


02 Jun 2015, 02:36 PM


Amouna
As a risk management professional, I am also allowed to have a "small, speculative part of the portfolio"
positioned in a few companies as I am of the aggressive type. I also KNOW my limits after having been burnt
severely in the past.


When the thesis behind an investment changes, a wise thing to do is to enlarge the set of available
information (facts, not rumours), and act accordingly. No technique is perfect ;)


02 Jun 2015, 03:14 PM

Agreed that no technique is perfect. One very effective technique for making money is an organized bear raid.

Shorts are never obvious until it is. For the founder, main architect and person with IP to leave the firm to set up
competing firm also speaks volume about problems with EKSO. It may not be down right fraud but you gotta be nuts
to ignore all these allegations and be long the name. Excellent work Pump Stopper.


Money Map Press, fairly reputable investment newsletter service has been pounding the table on EKSO on the long
side. It would be interesting to get their take on this. Will revert if I ever get their response.

Having followed CBI all the way down to $32 from the high $70s (after what I consider to be a spurious and bogus
short attack), I think I'd rather lock in the profits I've already made and see where the dust settles. Nothing's for
certain, but I'm fairly confident I'll have a chance to pick up shares for less than I sold them for today, even if it does
turn out that this article is just another blatant attempt at market manipulation.

Strange he's such a fan of RWLK. Their revenues are less than EKSO and dropped precipitously last quarter 
Same cash burn rate. RWLK did float 50 million of stock so they have more cash but if their sales don't get out of free
fall they won't survive

Let's not forget the man who in the UK chose to have an EKSO suit as compensation from his court case.


Dale Messenger, who was left paralyzed with an L1 incomplete spinal cord injury after suffering a gunshot wound,
settled a long running case at the High Court in the United Kingdom. His damages settlement includes, among other
items, the purchase cost of an Ekso Bionics Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton, its replacement over the years, and related
utilization costs.


"During my case, many subjects were discussed and items of equipment reviewed including other, similar
exoskeletons. One such item was the Ekso and it proved to be more valuable than I could imagine, and in a league of
its own," said Dale. "The benefit I experience from the Ekso ranges from pain relief, improvements to my
bladder/bowel function and more recently an increase in my motor function and sensation."

Nice Try 123
Author is short, states right there in the disclaimer. The author repeatedly refers to Gottbetter who is a lawyer that took
the company public, not an insider and has nothing to do with the Company (not an officer, director or an employee).
Gottbetter's scheme to pump and dump had nothing to do with Ekso as stated in the SEC's release that the author
mentions (other companies).


The author refers to a factually incorrect claim that Ekso accelerated their registration statement to allow the insiders
to sell. If the author carefully reads the Company's SEC filings, they thoroughly disclose that Ekso has a contractual
obligation to file the registration statement. Moreover, the acceleration of the registration statement is a SEC
mandated procedure in order for the SEC to declare such registration statement effective. Moreover, as the Form 3s
filed on May 6, 2015 indicate, none of the insiders have sold, plus they have a 24-month lock-up (again all in Ekso's
SEC filings), meaning that they can not sell prior to the expiration of such period.


No allegations here, just a clear presentation of facts, unlike what the author did with his assumptions. I expect Ekso
to come out with a statement summarizing the same. I used the opportunity to add to my position. Would be great for
Pump Stopper to rebutt any of these facts? Good luck.

Kraken Tamer
This is an update to the prior post. These facts are all available in the Federal District Court as 2:14 cr 467 - JLL in
New Jersey. The John Doe (later identified as Gottbetter when the file was unsealed) criminal complaint was filed on
8/8/2014. The information charging Gottbetter was filed 9/3/2014 and he pled guilty that day. He was sentenced
5/26/2015 and the file was unsealed prior to the time. The charges involved stocks other than EKSO. The comment
about "robbing banks" was made on a taped phone call and was about HBPE. The last alleged activity occurred about
November of 2013. Apparently the FBI went to "talk" to Gottbetter about their concerns but the date is blacked out.
Logically, the date of the "discussion" preceded the discussions about Gottbetter "ratting out" his accomplices in
return for a reduced punishment referenced in the court file. The alleged activity was to obtain a large number of
shares in the companies to be pumped and then use the accomplices to run up the price. As best I can tell, EKSO
became available for trading on 1/16/14. This would suggest that any manipulation at the hands of Gottbetter was
during a window between 1/16 and the date of the "talk" (unless one assumes that Gottbetter continued on even
though he knew he was under investigation). If the impetus for the article was the conviction, then it does not seem
that the criminal record supports the implied suggestion of manipulation (does not exclude it but makes it unlikely).
None of this addresses the other issues referenced by the author about alleged employee defection, alleged lack of
support from customers etc. but it is interesting that none of the above, in a publicly available file, was mentioned by
the author.

FYI--- FAQ from EKSO


"This FAQ is intended to answer certain questions pertaining to Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (“Ekso Bionics” or the
“Company”). This information was last updated on June 3, 2015 and should be considered current only as of that
date. The Company does not undertake to update this information.


Is Ekso Bionics aware of an article published by SeekingAlpha in early June 2015 and its contents?


Ekso Bionics is aware of the article that was published by SeekingAlpha in early June 2015.


The Company believes that it was unfairly attacked and disparaged in an article posted anonymously by someone
who we are informed is a short seller who frequently attacks companies in this way. While the Company fully respects
the right of third parties to express their opinion regarding the Company, it takes issue where such expression is
published anonymously and laden with false, misleading and selective information and when, as the Company
believes is the case, such expression is intended to drive down the Company’s stock price. Based on the allegations
in the article, the Company believes that the author either purposefully ignored or failed to learn the true facts about
the Company, its products and the developments that have occurred since the Company became public in January
2014.


Is Ekso Bionics aware of the cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice
against Adam Gottbetter?


The Company is aware of the cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of
Justice against Adam Gottbetter. While Mr. Gottbetter represented the Company in the reverse merger completed in
early 2014, he is not currently affiliated with the Company in any way. Mr. Gottbetter has never been an employee,
officer or director of the Company and has not held any other insider position at the Company.


To date, the Company has not been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Department of
Justice regarding Mr. Gottbetter. The Company is not aware of any Securities and Exchange Commission or
Department of Justice investigation regarding the Company or transactions in its securities.


What is the Company’s policy regarding responding to commentary, speculations or opinions expressed in non-expert
forums or financial blogs?


It is the Company’s general policy not to respond to commentary, speculations or opinions expressed in non-expert
forums or financial blogs. The Company, therefore, currently does not intend to respond further to the misstatements
and selective information contained in the above-referenced SeekingAlpha article."

From the article linked above: "I learned that the company will be issuing a point-by-point rebuttal to The Pump
Stopper and that it will be posted on Ekso’s website as soon as possible. That way all interested parties – investors
and “The Pump Stopper” alike – will have access to it at the same time."


I'm not sure the response on Ekso's website qualifies as a "point-by-point rebuttal."


I'm of the opinion that the original article is most likely spurious, but also I think Ekso's going to have to do better than
this.


03 Jun 2015, 01:18 PM


pomps1
PumpStopper is the guy he is describing in the article! Read no further than the top where he states he is short the
shares. All this article does is make him money as he needs to "pump" his short with all of us to make his profit.
Pumping works both ways long and short. Many of the things he states Goldman, BofA and others do all day. He
won't take on a liquid company though. If you look at his track record he picks on small companies where he can
impact the sell volume with assumptions and weak references to things. That is how he makes his profit.


Half the companies in the bay area at this point could fall into his description. The fraud and other words he throws
around applies to other organizations not this one but he creates the impression they do, great Pump work.


Just another Pumper spreading rumors to make a buck.

It was almost immediately obvious to me that this article is bogus.


First is the 92.3% downside implying precise calculations of value; any estimate of future price would be lucky to be
within 10%, let alone .1%


Then there's the overall hyperbolic tone; the author obviously has an axe to grind.


Third, the ridiculous length.


If the author really cared about helping to alerting people, why not post info as it was available instead of a huge
dump all at once.


I added 10,000 sh to my position.


At least that will put a small dent in the losses I incurred when I was less seasoned.

Keith Fitz-Gerald just sent out a note to his Total Wealth subscribers on this post titled, "How to Handle a Short Attack
on a Stock You Own". It describes what is happening here and why we shouldn't panic and do what the author wants
us to, sell the stock down so he can close out his shorts for a good profit. Keith personally did a lot of research on
Ekso and has recommended it to his subscribers. A short excerpt from his extensive note follows FYI:


"I’ve studied Ekso carefully, reviewed competitive offerings carefully, visited headquarters and, talked extensively with
C-level executives, Ekso users, and even health care professionals.


To be very clear, I saw and still see tremendous potential ahead.


Short attacks like this are unfortunate and gut-wrenching. But they come… and they go.


“The Pump Stopper’s” allegations seem credible at first glance, but many of them don’t make sense if you stop and
think about them logically for a minute."


Bottom line: Don't panic, and instead buy the dip.

It’s laughable that people demand a response from Ekso. People who sold on fear and misinformation possibly
deserve to lose their money??? People need to learn to research before reacting.


Adam Gottbetter: Not an insider. Period.


Boston Dynamics: Author wants you to believe Ekso is overly hyping past projects. The anonymous author uses an
anonymous source from Boston Dynamics to try to dramatize his position. Do your own research. Ekso had a single
bullet point about Boston Dynamics in their Q1-15 presentation. If that’s hyping I’m not sure Ekso is doing it right.


Charter Centers: Let me get this straight, hospitals choose to test multiple brands of products?!?!? Say it ain’t so!!!
That’s just crazy! /sarcasm. Hospitals are to be commended for investing multiple products. I doubt the author even
took the time to investigate if Ekso has been adopted at any previous ReWalk locations. Of course, he didn’t.


HUGE GLOBAL COMPANIES: (Que sound effects of impending doom!) Did you stop to think that having Parker
Hannifin in the space is GOOD for the overall bionic exoskeleton market? New entrants only reinforce the viability of
the market space. Viable enough to catch the eye of Parker Hannifin.


Other observations: Indego is currently only available for research, but author makes it sound as if they are taking the
market by storm. In fact, he says it will be available in a few months, but the hot linked article says nothing of an
approaching launch? Perhaps, he figured no one would click on those?


Anonymous author states that USBionics, ReWalk and Vanderbuilt are only companies with track record of success. It
would help us all if the anonymous author could point us to sales numbers for USBionics. Indigo isn’t on the market
for commercial use. ReWalk Q1-15 Revenues = $635k compared to Ekso’s Q1-15 revenues of $1.7M. So, I’m to
understand that the ReWalk (FAR superior according to the anonymous author) couldn’t outsell Ekso and their inferior
product??? AND ReWalk is available for personal use which Ekso is not.


Anonymous author says THESE are his investment choices, BUT earlier in the article says stem cells are going to
cure paralysis. Says that a bet on Ekso (which would also be a bet on ReWalk, Parker Hannifin and USBionics) is a
bet against stem cells.


The video provided reminded me of something that happened the other day. I was in a parking lot and this exotic
sports car was driving really slow looking for a spot to park…so I sped up, passed the car and turned to my son and
said, “look we’re smoke’n that sports car!” We both laughed. Reality was that the sports car wasn’t racing me. It’s
clear in the video that there is no race between ReWalk and Ekso. What appears to have happened is the ReWalk
guy stood around waiting for the Ekso to demonstrate their product…then kicked it into high gear while an accomplice
video tapped it.

I'm sorry for anyone who sold on this news.. I've been through the ringer on a couple of these short and distort
attacks.. the only way to survive is to hold .. if you sell on emotional impulse you will also buy back again - usually at
the wrong time, only to be caught in another attack.


Best if you just don't look at your portfolio ever.. trying to time these things is difficult. However this article was so
transparently specious in terms of journalistic research and so biased that I decided to take the 3500 in cash I had in
my account and buy 3k more shares.


not sold yet, so can't thank pooperdooper yet.

and the beat goes on... Wall street.. very easy to take advantage of speculators in high risk investments. If you were
to have a sentiment index of Ekso based on the social media experience it would have been pretty low yesterday. If
they don't have a second shoe to drop then, IMO, the sentiment index will read the same level next week that it was
last week before this was all staged. The natural price of this stock should be closer to 2 dollars a share at this point.
$3 and higher will be based on continued commercial success and growth in new markets (like construction).


If you notice, ReWalk and Ekso have the same market cap, even though Ekso has twice the revenue. This market
isn't growing that fast. I look forward to the day when revenue starts to grow and steadily increase. I'm hoping that the
Ekso construction segment will provide that catalyst to EKSO.


Everything that is said and done is calculated and motivated. I wonder about the timing of this particular article, as I
understand Ekso is now commercializing their construction bionics similar to the Fortis system the Navy designed
(using Ekso's patent). Was a whale caught in a net with no way out? There were millions of dollars of shares traded
yesterday. I would have written that article myself for about 10k.


I have to laugh at step cells curing paralysis.. gee are we really that close? Geron was supposed to be doing that and
where are they today? They were able to heal mice whose spinal cord they severed. Yet here we aret 5 years later
and we are still waiting. However spinal cord injury is not the market here, there are hundreds of other cases where
people could benefit from this technology.


I personally think there is a lot of risk in offering this technology to the public. You can imagine the potential for law
suits. I think its wise to be very circumspect and not rush into that market. Besides, until the cost comes down to

EKSO did respond today via their site: http://bit.ly/1Gl0pVy Obviously the writer was shorting the stock. Good thing I
remained calm and didn't sell or or consider it until further review. Also read this explains everything.

Been a while, not sure anyone is still reading here but just want to note that this month Scientific American-Mind
version I believe- did a feature on their technology and interviewed their spokesperson. Pretty impressive stuff. They
may die out as many do from cash burn. But it certainly seems they have a real product with real people with a real
need. They aren't just an illusion. I'm not in, but still following.

I don't see any advantage the competitive offerrings have. I think Ekso's software, variable assist and
ergonomic factors are innovations.

The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  you should do some work on the industry, the ekso variable assist is not innovative in my
view as RWLK has always had something similar and the only reason it's not well known is failure of their
marketing/sales force from what i can tell, and Indego has that explicitly built in


the other two factors of software and ergo are just not true from what i saw.

This article is simple market manipulation and slander. A simple investigation of Ekso's website reveals a lot.


In regards to the lockheed martin confustion: 
"Russ works closely with the Lockheed Martin Corporation, licensing Ekso technology to further develop the HULCTM
exoskeleton for military use. Formerly Vice President of Engineering, "


Furthermore, the claims about spinal cord injury being cured with stem cell research is not important and narrative
driven. The percentage of people who would buy ekso's is not drastically changed. Many people don't even have legs,
so spinal nerve issue is only a tiny fragment of the issue. They don't point this out, and focus on how it makes the
whole company less valuable.


This article is a joke, intended to cut losses for dummies who short the stock. Pure manipulation.


Yesterday, June 10 -> Ekso was awarded 3 new patents by the US Patent Office. A sign to me they are doing
something right and their technology is valuable. Have you compared the Ekso patents to rewalk? It makes Rewalk
look like a childs toy.

To begin with, Gottbetter did 100's of reverse merges, whereas only a few companies with failing stocks are shown.
Some of them he cheated on after the fact, but not for Ekso. Why would Ekso have sold over 120 units? Why would
they develop children models which have already sold and reported on within the last week (atlanta)? Why would they

have NIH grants? Why do they have 3 contracts with Socom? Why have the licensed their tech to Lockheed Martin
thru boston dynamics as a middleman? There have there been over 21 million steps taken, constantly rising. They
just got 3 patents, 12 total. Their patents include counterweights for battery free suits designed for construction
workers - which NPR and Wired both just did pieces on- Ekso Works. Ekso's history has been long and confusing,
and definitely lived thru a hype bubble, but end of the day; they also have done the most work. Their product is
carefully built with aluminum in a warehouse, not outsourced and cheaply made in plastic like Rewalk. This article
makes fun of their factory, which happens to be RIGHT NEXT TO A GIANT FORD EXPORTATION PLANT with solar
panels on the roof. This company is ready to gear up in my opinion, they are just perfecting their tech first. The
company was vulnerable to a stock attack because they gave up their anti-dilution provisions, meaning their preferred
stock would be marginal if the market fell more. This was a sign of confidence that the price bottomed out, not a sign
that they are going bankrupt. To prove my point, the president recently filed a form-4 to buy some shares above
market value. He got taxes very little for capital gains, because he knows its artificially low after this short attack - so
the technical taxed value of what he is getting is deflated. He would have held onto anti diluted shares and not
allowed the company to remove that provision if he thought it was going to tank. Ekso's public image is their weak
point, they haven't defended themselves properly. Just wait for next Q financials and that will speak for itself.

Next time read more carefully: "The assertion of this exemption should not be construed as an indication by
the Commission or its staff that any violations of law have occurred..." .... so basically the SEC is claiming
EKSO has done nothing wrong!!!
