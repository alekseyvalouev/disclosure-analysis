Houston American Energy Corp. Set Up for Collapse
Apr. 7, 2010 3:21 AM ET22 comments
by: Shareholder Watchdog


We recently read Shareholders Unite’s post on HUSA. We agree with the author’s
conclusion on HUSA, but believe there are additional details that SU left out. We want to
supplement SU’s post with our own thoughts:


Small-cap exploration and production stocks are like lottery tickets for investors. While
most are failures, some strike it rich. Significantly higher risk appetite in the market has
created an environment for small cap E&P story stocks to get egregiously ahead of
themselves. We believe this is the case at Houston American Energy Corp. Most “lottery
winners” in the E&P space are wildcatters who take enormous risk by trying to find
undiscovered oil, with the hope of striking black gold and finding larger companies to
farmout their interest to at high returns. HUSA is the opposite, in our view. HUSA’s
business plan appears to leech on to larger oil companies then promote and hype their
investments. For example, to justify HUSA’s current valuation, one has to believe that a
$15 million investment made just a few months ago is now worth over $500 million. In
addition, an investor has to believe one of the most sophisticated oil investors (Korea’s
largest energy company) is willing to hand out winning lottery tickets for next to nothing.
HUSA has made a spectacular run, but we believe it is coming close to an end. We
believe investors are unaware or have overlooked prior indiscretions by HUSA’s
management team at a bankrupted company. Given the issues with management and the
overhype surrounding the company’s Colombian investments, we believe investors face
greater than 65% downside from current levels.


HUSA has oil and gas investments in Colombia and the U.S. It was founded in 2001 and
currently has three employees (a CEO, CFO and an assistant). With is most recent market
cap of $620 million, the value placed by the market is roughly $200 million per employee.
As of September 30, 2009, HUSA had invested a TOTAL of $19.8 million of capital—its
market cap currently represents more than 30 times invested capital! Over the past six
years, the company has generated "in total" roughly $31 million of revenue and lost $1

million of net income. We could only find one realized gain in the company’s history. It
generated a gain of $7.6 million on a $4 million investment. The gain took place in June
2008, when oil was north of $125 per barrel.


HUSA has a history of a hyped stock (that ultimately does not deliver). In late 2006 the
stock rocketed 160% over hype regarding its investment in the Cabiona prospect in
Colombia. The company issued multiple press releases in the fall of 2006 regarding the
progress on their Cabiona drilling project. In early 2007, management confessed that the
drilling failed and the well had to be "plugged", sending the shares down 60%. In mid
2008, the stock rallied nearly 250% over three months over hype of the sale of its
Caracara assets in Colombia. That sale generated the aforementioned gain of $7.6
million. The shares fell greater than 80% the following six months after the gain was
announced.


The previous spikes in the stock pale in comparison to HUSA's most recent ascent. In July
2009 the stock was trading below $2.00 per share. In early December 2009, the company
issued equity in a registered direct offering through the investment bank Global Hunter at
$4.68 per share (2.89 mm shares or $12.8 million in net proceeds). Since that deal, the
shares have quadrupled. The hype machine is currently in full force: momentum
newsletters, small cap research shops, and chat boards (even pumpers on a chat board
for a Chinese software company have helped drive the stock to irrational levels).


Sum-of-Parts


The shares have been such a huge outperformer due to excitement surrounding their
October 2009 investment in CPO-4 in Colombia. To better understand the valuation of
HUSA, we point to the sum-of-parts valuation from Global Hunter. While we believe Global
Hunter is a respectable firm and do not believe that they are part of this pump and dump
scheme, we take their research with a healthy dose of skepticism given their investment
banking relationship with the company. Global Hunter provided the following sum-of-parts
valuation to justify their recent $14 price target (the report has been published here.


$1.91 per share for 7 JV Colombian locations w/ Hupecol; ~12.5% interest


$1.93 per share for JV w/ Shona w/ Serrania; ~12.5% interest
$11.71 per share for CPO-4 Block
In September 2009, Hupecol LLC informed HUSA management that they hired an
investment bank to explore the sale of six locations that HUSA has approximately 12.5%
interest. The sale was originally expected to close on December 15, 2009 and has been
delayed several times. The bid date has moved back numerous times, but a sale could

possibly be announced at any time. We do not have a strong view on the valuation of
these interests, but do not believe a value of $50 million to $65 million or $1.60 to $2.00
per share is highly unreasonable.


CPO-4 Hype


Clearly the largest piece of the sum-of-parts valuation of HUSA is their 25% interest in
CPO-4. As way of background, in 2008 South Korea’s largest energy company, SK
Energy, participated in an auction of 17 blocks covering 6.6 million acres in Colombia. SK
Energy won the rights to the CPO-4 block (345,452 acres) with a very aggressive bid of
31% royalty to National Hydrocarbon Agency and a $2.3 million bonus payment (.pdf). SK
Energy was very bullish about the prospects for CPO-4, as their bid was one of the most
aggressive of any block.


Just a few months ago, HUSA announced a farmout agreement where it agreed to pay
25% of all past and future costs related to CPO-4 in exchange for 25% interest in the
block (we believe this is actually a “farm in” agreement). HUSA management expects to
spend $15 million over the next three years on CPO-4. Adjusting for the 31% royalty to the
National Hydrocarbon Agency and the 8% royalty to the Colombia government, HUSA’s
interest represents roughly 15% of CPO-4. In exchange for roughly a $10 million present
value investment, we believe investors are now valuing this 15% stake at greater than
$500 million just a few months later.


Is SK Energy dumb or was it in financial difficulty? We argue neither. SK Energy is a
leading energy company in South Korea. In 2009, it had revenues of $32 billion and
assets of over $19 billion, and had a tremendous amount of financial flexibility with its
leverage below 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. SK Energy operates in dozens of foreign
countries and recently highlighted their most desirable 2010 exploration opportunities in
Vietnam, Brazil, and Peru (notice Colombia is not mentioned Earnings Results-
Final(1).pdf).


In addition, the HUSA CPO-4 deal was announced after a number of positive high profile
data points were announced in Colombia. This includes the $800 million acquisition of
Emerald Energy by Sinochem in August 2009 and large success by Petrominerales Ltd.
(OTCPK:PMGLF) Corcel-A2 in September 2009.


Even stranger, according to Gulf United Energy’s 10-Q issued in January 2010, Gulf
United “entered into a tentative letter of intent with SK Energy Co., Ltd to acquire a 25%
interest in Block CPO-4 in the Llanos Basin of Colombia. This agreement is subject to
completion of a definitive agreement which is currently being negotiated.” Gulf United

https://seekingalpha.com/article/197437-houston-american-energy-corp-set-up-for-collapse 4/10


entered into the letter of intent AFTER HUSA finalized its agreement with SK Energy. Gulf
United Energy is another small cap E&P company with limited management team and a
current market cap of $33 million.


So despite knowledge of success at Corcel-A2 and the lofty takeout valuation of
Sincohem, very recently one of the most sophisticated oil investors in the world was
looking to dump 50% of its interest in CPO-4. At the very least, this should be a massive
red flag. At the very best, we believe there is a huge disconnect between the valuations of
Petrominerales Ltd, who has proven success in Colombia, and the highly speculative
investment in HUSA. We believe Shareholders Unite’s post does a good job of flushing
this disparity out.


Management Indiscretions


The quality of a management team is extremely important for any small cap company. But
when your management bench is only two people, assessment of management is vital.
We found prior indiscretions of HUSA’s founder and CEO, John F. Terwilliger, highly
concerning. Terwilliger was the founder and CEO of Moose Oil and Gas Company, which
filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2002. As Moose Oil was heading towards
insolvency, it was alleged that Terwilliger used Moose Oil resources and funds to start
HUSA. According to a court appointed official, in “March of 2001, John F. Terwilliger began
using the funds of Moose Oil and Gas Company to create a new corporate entity that
became known as Houston American Energy Corporation.” According to the 2004 case of
Alan Gerger, Trustee vs. John F. Terwilliger (case number 04-03187),


Moose Oil and Gas Company raised approximately $500,000.00 in contributions to
the corporation that were deposited into the corporation’s bank accounts and, within
a short period of time, appear to have been used not for the purposes represented.


In addition, Terwilliger transferred assets that the court official found were “made with
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud investors.” The acts “were committed intentionally,
willfully, and/or maliciously, John F. Terwilliger committed acts constituting a breach of his
fiduciary duty.”


In the settlement agreement in October 2005 (case # 02-33891), the trustee had evidence
that showed



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312165/000143209310000039/gulfunited10q113009.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/191022-shareholders-unite/61916-houston-american-energy-husa-priced-for-perfection
5/22/2018 Houston American Energy Corp. Set Up for Collapse | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/197437-houston-american-energy-corp-set-up-for-collapse 5/10


that John F. Terwilliger and Marlin Date Research [100% owned by Terwilliger]
engaged in a scheme to hinder, delay or defraud creditors of Moose, that John F.
Terwilliger intentionally breached his fiduciary duties.


In light of these findings, we found a number of items that should be serious red flags to
any investor. For example, management has a poor track record of estimating or possibly
inflating proven reserves. According the 2008 10k,


During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, revisions to prior estimates
resulted in significant negative revisions to our proved reserves. Negative revisions
during fiscal year 2007 amounted to 57.7% of prior year-end proved natural gas
reserves and 40.2% of prior year-end proved oil reserves. Product sales and
negative revisions during fiscal year 2008 amounted to 86.2% of prior year-end
proved gas reserves and 83.4% of prior year-end proved oil reserves.


Even more disturbing is the disclosure regarding related party transactions. Over the past
two years, (page F-11 10k), Terwilliger and Director Orrie L Tawes received royalty
payments of $256,018 and $253,467, respectively. This is highly concerning given the
CEOs prior history of apparent self dealing. Also concerning, according to court
documents (Case 04-031887 Document 1), prior to Moose’s bankruptcy, “all of the oil and
gas properties and/or interests of Moose Oil and Gas Company being transferred to O.
Lee Tawes and Marlin [owned 100% by Terwilliger].” Is it possible that Terwilliger is still
benefiting from the potential “fraud” (the Trustee’s words) at Moose Energy, but now at the
expense of HUSA’s shareholders? We have no opinion on this, but would feel more
comfortable if not for the modest audit fees charge by their auditor GBH CPAs. We can
only hope that the $78,335 audit fee is sufficient to provide proper oversight at HUSA.


In conclusion, we believe HUSA could be set up for a massive collapse. We believe
investors face greater than 65% downside from current levels. Even a stock price that is
65% lower suggests a greater than ten times return on their investment in CPO-4 in a few
months—which may understate the downside given SK Energy’s recent actions. With only
669,000 shares short (around 2% of shares outstanding), we believe the shares represent
an undiscovered opportunity for the short community and a lottery ticket than may
ultimately be worth nothing more than the paper on which it was printed.

$20 million of invested capital now worth $620 million?! The CEO is either the next Warren Buffett or Bernie Madoff.
Something stinks here. Good write up.

This kind of high-risk E and P company is taking the place of the traditional exploration activities that used to be done
by the big global players, which for the globals, reduces the risk. The wildcatter strikes it big, the big guys buy it out....
the wildcatter hits a dry hole, they go broke and the shareholders assume the loss.... So it works for the global players
and these guys perform a useful function....


So anybody that invests in one of these businesses has to understand that they are accepting the risk that has been
passed along by the global players......


The Exxons and Conocos of the world have scaled back a lot of their exploration activities, despite the recent $147
dollar per barrel oil, because that activity is no longer justifiable for them economically. What does that tell you about
the general availability of new projects and likelihood that we will ever be able to explore or drill our way out of this
mess....

Frankly if you look at the HUSA 10k you will see that there are a lot of inaccuracies in the above report. I would
caution listening to anybody who writes this kind of smear without signature. This report smells bad.

It may "smell bad," but, based on the 20+% drop in HUSA value today, the article is either prescient or has
caused the collapse. Regardless of the underlying strength or weakness of HUSA, the fact remains that it is
clearly an extremely risky investment.

This article caused a 30% drop in HUSA's value. With friends like Shareholder Watchdog, investors don't

If you actually read their most recent quarterly report, you can see that this is kind of an interesting case. 90% of the
so-called assets of the company consist of the rights to 894 "supposed" mboe in a big deposit in Colombia. While they
are waiting to see what the value of this oil is going to be, they have a little drilling business on the side. They drilled
15 wells last year, in different places around Texas and Louisiana, of which 5 were considered "productive" at some
level.

They have about $8M in oil and gas revenue, which more or less covers their lease expenses plus the generous
$2.8M they are paying themselves to run the place, and are unprofitable by just about the same amount as their
depletion writeoff.They're only burning about $.5M per year in cash, but they can do this for a long time with the $14M
they have in cash on hand. They raise additional capital for new lease purchases by issuing stock, they do not appear
to have too much debt, so this could go on for a long time...


So if you're an investor in this outfit, what are you really buying? Probably the value of all of that oil that is
underground in Colombia. How much is recoverable? How much will it be worth at the time they are going to recover
it? Will the Colombian government allow them to take the money out of the country? So many questions.....


So this is a reserves speculation deal, the nominal market cap of the stock, which is about $14 today thanks to the big
decline yesterday after the posting of this article is a fraction of the value of the claimed reserves, and it is up to the
investor to either have faith or not have faith that the well-paid officers are able to keep the game going until someone
wants to pay enough for the lease holdings and rights to the reserves in Colombia. How long will that be? No one
knows. If the peak oilers are right, this will eventually be worth something. The article above raises a lot of questions
about the character of the managers, but these are oil men we are talking about, and there are always going to be
questions.


So, at some price, despite all of the legal stuff, despite all of the monkey business, and despite the well-paid officers,
this might be an interesting investment. Not if you are a widow or orphan though. Better keep the 401K money in a
sock under your mattress. usoilinventories.com

It's interesting that an anonymous author calling himself Shareholders Unite posts a negative article on HUSA on the
same day that an author calling himself Shareholder Watchdog posts a negative (and factually challenged) article on
HUSA. The two authors (are is it one author pretending to be two?) slap each other on the back in comments on
Seeking Alpha and lo and behold HUSA's share price declines 30% with no other news but this pair of blog posts by
one or two anonymous authors.


I'm fairly new to Seeking Alpha and I find this behavior troubling. Granted, I'm long a few shares of HUSA, not enough
to be seriously affected by manipulation of their share price one way or another, but just enough to pay attention to
what's going on here and enough not to like it.


It's obviously unsavory for anonymous writers acting in concert to manipulate share prices.


Is this the sort of thing that Seeking Alpha is about, or is this an aberration? Either way, I'd like to know who these
anonymous bloggers really are.

HUSA is clearly an overhyped dog of a stock. Grossly overvalued. There are a slew of legitimate juniors/midcaps in
Colombia with real reserves (not "resources" ie not proven economic) and production backed by legitimate
management teams. And only a handful of the most successful (GTE, PMG, PRE) have valuations anywhere close to
this speculative hype job.


It is beyond comprehension that any rational investor would think that HUSA is remotely fairly valued. All legitimate
analysts would choke on the absurd valuations. Highly speculative "resources" that take tens/hundreds of millions of $
to prove up (wells take $5-$20MM a pop) aren't worth much.


Why the SEC hasn't closed this play down astounds me.

James Shell, Contributor
Oh, it's these guys' job to do the overhyping. That's what a lot of this business is about. That's why all of these
drilling and production press releases are worded so carefully, and why the people in this business have a
terrible reputation.


The question is: what's the price at which it becomes interesting? 2? .50 cents? Dunno.

Why are there a few negative comments here against those who point out a few glaring concerns about HUSA's
management practices and valuation? Do you really think a stock should always only go up? Do you think a 1-year
rise from $2 to $20 is not enough? One should always encourage discussion from both sides, or else we will end up
with fascism. Buying and shorting are both trading strategies and both can be profitable.

There's a big difference between "discussion," and a hit-piece, which is the short version of a pump and

"Set Up for Collapse," does not imply a balanced approach to discussing a company.


Also the arrival of low-commenting posters in the comments section is also suspect.

See article on sharesleuth.com today regarding the same. Stock down another 13% and deservedly so, in my opinion.
The history of the 3 employees of this "company" plus the "effective immediately" resignation of 1 director today tell all
that you need to know about this "company". What did you expect the company response to be? You caught us?
