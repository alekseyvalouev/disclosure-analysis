Cellceutix: Why An Uplisting Is Not Possible Right Now
Feb. 6, 2015 2:26 PM ET59 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


Cellceutix has been saying it will uplist to a major exchange for almost two years.


The company does not meet the Corporate Governance requirements to uplist.


CTIX admits in its 10-K that it will be "extremely difficult" for it to do the things
required for an uplisting.


Cellceutix (CTIX) has been talking about an uplisting for a long time.


In March 2013, CEO Leo Ehrlich said in an interview with SA Contributor KarinCA that he
had met with the NYSE earlier that month (March 2013).


Q: Now that CTIX trades actively and is close to, or meeting requirements to move
to a higher exchange, are there any intentions to uplist to the Nasdaq or NYSE
MKT?


A: We are very focused on what we are working to accomplish in the near term with
the development of Kevetrin and Prurisol, but moving to a senior exchange is
definitely part of our overall plan to maximize exposure and shareholder value.
Making some preliminary plans, I had a meeting with the NYSE earlier this month to
discuss the process and was pleasantly surprised that they knew who we were
already. As I'm sure you can tell, we don't let the moss grow under our feet at
Cellceutix. We are always planning for the future, but we still recognize that there is
work to be done in the here and now. As we meet our milestones, we will move
forward. I am confident of that.


In September 2013, Cellceutix announced that it had acquired the assets from a bankrupt
PolyMedix. Mr. Ehrlich also said that Cellceutix would uplist to a major exchange "in the
near future."

As such, we have shifted our development strategy with our anti-psoriasis drug,
Prurisol, to forego the planned Proof-of-Concept trial overseas and have already
begun preparing the regulatory paperwork for the Food and Drug Administration to
initiate a larger-scale, Phase 2/3 multi-center trial. The adjustment will save us
hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of time that will now be better served
to position us to potentially have up to five clinical trials ongoing in 2014. This
acquisition dovetails very nicely in our goals to continue to build shareholder
value and uplist to a senior exchange in the near future."


In September 2014, Cellceutix announced that it was appointing Dr. Barry Schechter to
the Board of Directors and that the company was focused on an uplisting.


Cellceutix is focused on meeting the remaining requirements necessary to uplist to a
senior exchange. The Company believes that being listed on the New York Stock
Exchange or NASDAQ will serve many valuable functions, including allowing large
funds and institutions to invest who are otherwise not allowed to invest in OTC-listed
companies, increased stock liquidity, and validating market potential for Cellceutix's
extensive pipeline. Cellceutix plans to call for a shareholder meeting to elect
additional independent directors for serving on its board and audit committee in the
coming weeks. - See more


And then again, in January 2015 Cellceutix announced that it was in plans to start a
clinical trial in patients with Ulcerative Proctitis. Mr. Ehrlich also said that it was meeting
with its legal counsel that day to discuss the company's application to the NASDAQ.


Cellceutix is also pleased to inform shareholders that due to recently reported
positive events, the Company is actively moving forward with its intentions to uplist
to the NASDAQ exchange and is meeting today with its legal counsel, K&L Gates, to
review the Company's application for a move to the senior exchange.


Two days after this press release, SA Contributor KarinCA published a rebuttal to my
negative article. I encourage everyone interested in Cellceutix to read that article. In the
comments of that article, as well as on Cellceutix message boards, investors have taken
the mention of uplisting as fact. Despite Cellceutix talking about uplisting for almost two
years now, longs seem to be sure that this is the time. Is it?

The facts are that Cellceutix would not be allowed to uplist on any of the NASDAQ
exchanges as it currently stands. You can view the requirements for NASDAQ uplisting
here. CTIX meets the financial and liquidity for uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market,
which is the least stringent of the NASDAQ tiers. Here are the Financial and Liquidity
requirements


So Cellceutix can uplist on the Equity Standard to the NASDAQ Capital Market based on
the Financial and Liquidity requirements. Where Cellceutix falls short, however, is in the
Corporate Governance requirements.

Does Cellceutix have a Board made up of a majority of independent directors? It does
not? You can see the definition of what an independent director is here. The definition is:


"'Independent director' means a person other than an executive officer or employee
of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of
the issuer's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director."


Below are the NASDAQ rules for who isn't considered an independent director.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2894046-cellceutix-why-an-uplisting-is-not-possible-right-now 5/18


Cellceutix only has three people on its board. Leo Ehrlich, Dr. Krishna Menon, and as of
October 1, 2014, Dr. Barry Schechter. There is no majority of independent directors on the
board.


Mr. Ehrlich is not independent because he is an executive officer.
Dr. Menon is not independent because he is also an executive officer.
It does appear that Dr. Barry Schechter would qualify as an independent director.


However, according to Cellceutix's last 10-K, the company does not have any independent
directors.


Since we are not currently subject to corporate governance standards relating to the
independence of our directors, we choose to define an "independent" director in
accordance with the NASDAQ Global Market's requirements for independent
directors (NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200). We do not currently have an
independent director under the above definition. We do not list that definition on our
Internet website.


Cellceutix does not have an Audit Committee, which is a requirement for listing on the
NASDAQ. The NASDAQ rules for an audit committee are below.


The Audit Committee shall consist of three or more Directors, each of whom
shall be an independent director within the meaning of the rules of the NASDAQ
Stock Market and Section 10A of the Act. The number of Non-Industry Directors on
the Audit Committee shall equal or exceed the number of Industry Directors on the
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee shall include two Public Directors. A Public
Director shall serve as Chair of the Committee. An Audit Committee member shall
hold office for a term of one year.

It's not like Cellceutix can just set up an audit committee. It needs at least two more
independent directors. Cellceutix says that independent directors are extremely difficult to
obtain and retain. Again from the 10-K:


Given the small size of the Company and its Board and the Company's limited
resources, locating, obtaining and retaining additional independent directors
is extremely difficult. In the absence of independent directors, the Board does not
believe that creating a separate compensation committee would result in any
improvement in the compensation determination process.


Cellceutix does not have a Compensation Committee, which is also a requirement for
listing on the NASDAQ.


So for nearly two years Cellceutix has been saying that it will uplist in press releases. In
SEC filings, however, it has said that the requirements needed to uplist will be "extremely
difficult." Maybe this time is different.

The article makes some decent points. CTIX directors would do well to gain more credibility. Disclosure: I am long the
company as I believe in the long term prospects of its pipeline. I have trimmed my holding in 2014 to hedge risks
although I will likely buy more shares sometime later this year.

Don't really care about an imminent uplisting. I care about them executing and hitting their marks, then an uplisting

Mr. Bleak Street,


As someone who is long CTIX, I have to admit that this piece appears to have taken more thought than the piece of
fluff you published earlier, castigating CTIX management for it's description of furniture it acquired from the bankrupt
Polymedix.


It HAS been a matter of much discussion, among longs, about which exchange CTIX might qualify for and when, and
some longs express frustration with Leo Ehrlich mentioning uplisting a number of times, without it having happened
yet.


However, I firmly believe uplisting is far less important than the stunningly successful progress CTIX has made on the
science of Brilicidin, Kevetrin and Prurisol. Advances in the science, moving the drugs along step by step, is what will
ultimately lead to a partnership with one or more large pharma companies. Uplisting will happen in due time. I have
faith in CTIX management.


Oh, and have you even attempted to speak with Leo about uplisting and his plans?


06 Feb 2015, 02:48 PM


thementany
I'm torn on this article. 
On the one hand, it is true that CTIX is still a ways off from uplisting to a major exchange, so for that, I offer the author
a slight nod of my head, and nothing more.  
The more important question is this: What does it matter if Cellceutix uplists now or at a later date? 
Answer: It doesn't. CTIX is a development stage company that has done exceedingly well thus far. Sure uplisting has
its perks, but they are unnecessary at this point in time. The science advances, looking more solid each time we get
data, and THAT is what matters here.


So, thank you for at least attempting at honesty this time around, however fruitless it may be, and I look forward to
seeing you squeezed hard.

It is informative reading & more should come to light so one can make honest judgment to hold security in any one

Science first last and always -- that's what's driving this company onward and upward. The rest is but commentary...
And yours is highly selective and obviously agenda-driven. Watch and wait. CTIX is going higher....... Perhaps it'll be
the Dana Farber update on Kevetrin, or maybe the push forward with Brilacidin. Or perhaps another surprise. Good
luck shorting this stock. Imo you'll need it.

CapitalManager
Dear Bleecker Street Research,


Many thanks for outlining the steps necessary to up list. I wasn't sure what remained to be done. I trust that Mr.
Ehrlich is busy recruiting to create the independent director slots needed and the structure for the audit and
compensation committees. Considering the recent positive progress on the CTIX pipeline, there are sure to be solid
candidates who would jump at the chance to serve on the CTIX board.

"Does Cellceutix have a Board made up of a majority of independent directors? It does not?"


I'm Ron Burgundy?


Congrats, you can count the number of Independent Directors. Do you know the time frame between when the
Independent Directors are named and when uplisting is announced? My understanding is that it can be
instantaneous. This would render your "analysis" worthless, and destroy any short positions that exist at that time. I
hope you don't cost anybody lots of money :)

If this effort had been written before that laughable furniture depreciation article, then the author would have much
more credibility. But in any event, this is a non-issue. The qualifications for CTIX to up-list can be met very quickly.

Very salient points that illustrate the big hurdle for CTIX. It is an issue of governance. The financials are in place.

It doesn't take a genius to know currently as of today they could not uplist. I still to this day have seen a paper wrote
are published proving the science WONT work. On little release would burn all of the shorts and I'm looking forward to
it. Been long this stock for years now and I have accumulated a very nice nest egg. I wish seeking alpha would
actually publish something worth reading. My stance is I'm long CTIX until the company stumbling with their currently

CTIX can uplist now to capital markets and have up to one year to full-fill the remaining requirements which should be
simple enough. With the amazing success of Brilacidin and Kevetrin uplisting is a side note for now.

CTIX's and NNAB Barron's coverage was very interesting. Barron's does not normally fish in the Pink Sheet
pond for positive coverage. Someone probably brought the story to them as a scam. When Barron's
discovered that the person was a BOLD FACED DEFAMATION KING or QUEEN they decided to give the
story a positive Father to Son twist without recommending the shares. I think that your at least the
DEFAMATION PRINCE calling either company a scam. I would surmise that you or someone that you know is
quite upset that Barron's probably researched the science and found a ton of legitimacy.

Considering you don't even know who actually wrote the Barron's teaser on Nanoantiscam (and it wasn't

You clearly don't know what you're talking about. Here in the UK WPP our biggest advertising agency group
started by merging into a shell company that made parts for supermarket trollies its name? WPP. Likewise
Nokia was a merger into a shell company at its outset. If, as I guess, you've been foolish enough to short a
small cap stock that could double in a fairly short timeframe wiping you out, then I can see why you're
panicking. On a different subject, I would also be careful about making defamatory and libellous remarks on a
public board.

US market is very different. Shells are the rotten rung of the capital markets in America, used by crooks and

IPOs with respectable underwriters.


Think about that for a moment. CTIX is so filthy that it could not even get a bucket shop to do an IPO for the
firm. Consider that.

This is a respectable article. I was aware of the facts in sequence before this was published. I believe that Kevetrin
will be approved for usage in Italy after the Bologna trial for Leukemia patients in conjugation with cytarabine. The
dynamics of Roche's(?) involvement, plus the potential speed with which a drug can be moved forward in Italy mean
much.


Roche has been working toward P53 therapeutics for a long very expensive time. There is a reason why Roche
choose Bologna in Italy. The quickest fastest EUroute to revenue

Governance compliance with exchange rules is far easier to remedy than this author makes it to be. At last count, the
number of new independent directors needed is 3, a simple majority based on the current two directors being non-
independent. And, audit committees are easily enough put together.


The hold-up that I see isn't the difficulty of the task, but for reasons this article's author fails to mention: directors and
audit committees are an added level of corporate bureaucracy that will make decision making and quick action much
more difficult. It is good governance for a small two person operation to put in place all major pathways before adding
levels of burden for those decisions. For example, independent directors would be unlikely to approve moving forward
with a sixth or seventh clinical trial with so little money in the bank, even if most of the costs of those trials were
covered by others, which is the case with CTIX.

just another dupe with all us longs in CTIX.


As a long since it was 0.53 around 2 years ago, I assure you, I could not care less that there is no uplisting - yet. It will
come. Likely around the time the FDA gives the go ahead for the P3 B trial and a partnership with big pharma is
announced around then. Leo has shown he knows how to maximize shareholder value. I couldn't care less that there
is no BOD. He's done just fine by shareholders without one.

Where is the beef? CTIX has Filet Mignon's plural in their pipeline! 
They also have excellent management. Its just a matter of time, before it blows my min(e).

I would like to see the company meet the uplisting requirements if only to tilt the balance of strategic options more
toward expansion and less toward sale. I don't want to sell my shares to Cubist or such for $10. I want to list them on
my estate tax return at $500.

Nice article.... I hope CEO Ehrlich reads it and is more careful in the future about promising things that he cannot
deliver, i.e. uplist "in the near future". He obviously has hurt shareholder value in the past by over promising. As they
say, "under promise and over deliver."

I beg you be very specific sir, I do not see that any time line event promise has been made to shareholders,
such as myself. At this time I will take it that your stretching transparent modest to best efforts to mean
promises.


I do not think that this has hurt shareholder value at all. In fact I think most well informed shareholders would
rather see them delay reaching for NASDAQ in order to accomplish the other things that they are. In a small
company with a plateful of wholesome projects, one of them is almost always going to be delayed.


The company has been transparent and constructive, but no promise with any kind of date has been given to
us.


I believe that the companies executive management is capable but believe that they believe that the prior
opportunities to make the moves necessary would not have been in the interests of shareholder value. I do
diverge on this point with them, but it is no matter of integrity, just an honest difference in corporate timing.
However, I do not know enough to know if I am correct or not.


In general, I would propound that the companies management has under promised and over delivered by far.
Poly-Medix assets and Brilacidin were never promised. The recent results released about Kevetrin and the
Ovarian Cancer patient were never promised. Ehrlich and Menon deferring their salaries for a major
dispensation of time, were never promised. The preliminary results at Beth Israel with Pfizer's Sutent were
never promised. 
Brilacidin OM to come at MD Anderson was never promised.  
The financings, the research grants and other private placements were never promised. NASDAQ is a hope
that I find easily believable, put I do not believe that it is date predictable.

After thinking again I have concluded that what you have done with the indeed a frequent hope is to state it as
a promise. Therefore you have created a straw man to that can be greatly effected by your hullabaloo.

Question for the author... do you know anything at all about the drugs in the pipeline? Anything?


07 Feb 2015, 12:57 PM


chocolatecracker
The lumberjack knows all to well what the forest has to offer. Planting the seeds of doubt is letting them
harvest numerous shares from gullible investors. Once they have their allotted shares, the other alias will
scream headlines about the incredible pipeline at CTIX and no mention of scratched furniture...lol

I believe those who are short Cellceutix, understand that there case is better made avoid the scientific
fundamentals of the companies compounds both Kevetrin and Brilacidin. If facts I think that they are quite
surprised to find such a strong group of well informed retail investors in the CTIX shareholder family.


They do have a short window of time that they can be successful in and they must go all out to break us down
soon. They need to create a buyer's strike buy skunking up the atmosphere to dampen or delay new retail
shareholders from entering. They must create some selling panic buy continuing to trampoline the share price
downward. Kevetrin and Brilacidin are scientifically strong. Also Prurisol trials will move quickly because it is
dermatological.


If they are unsuccessful soon, then there huge short position with CTIX's drugs will create a double layer of
both short and intermediate term value that we might attract a hedge fund of another type. The kind that will
give them all free tickets to see a Broadway Film called the NUTCRACKER.


I can say this much there are a lot more people watching CTIX with interested ears and big pocketbook and
wallets than what you might think.

You are correct, gullible investors can fall for proverbially selling their birthright of profit for a trivial mezzimerization. I
can only hope that the Nutcracker's jump in before such happens. There are some very caring people who are CTIX
longs, that really want to see the science advance rapidly to rescue needy people, as well as make money.

Would you watch apparently short sellers, who write and publish trash like this article, before they obtain a
response from the company. Once again yes I watch and share with others who are financially able that some
DOO DOO's appear to be short.

The logic used here is the same as CTIX has no approved drugs right this very moment, are you crazy to invest in it?
CTIX isn't on a major exchange at this very moment are you crazy to invest in it? My, my, my... Companies have goals
my friend, nothing wrong with stating them. I don't see how up-listing will be an issue, if the science proves itself...and
if it does prove out, CTIX will be selecting the best partner amongst many.


Based on the volume after this article came out, it looks like this article had about a zero impact. Bleaker what ever
hedge fund, investor, or fund is paying you.. you may have just been fired. It could be you are collecting $$$ on hits
on this article and/or you trading your 100 shares shorts. Seriously, you really should look for another profession.

CELLCEUTIX PROVIDES UPDATE TO SHAREHOLDERS


My Fellow Cellceutix Shareholders,


We are pleased to inform you that this past Thursday (February 5th) we submitted an application to the NASDAQ
Exchange for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Markets. We have already met several of the NASDAQ listing
requirements and are working to meet other requirements with respect to Independent Directors and establishing
certain committees. Our corporate counsel and NASDAQ have advised that these requirements can be fulfilled during
the application process. As previously discussed, we have been performing our due diligence and interviewing many
interested individuals wishing to join Cellceutix in these capacities. The names of the prospective Directors will be
submitted to NASDAQ for their vetting process to ensure that the individuals meet the requirements per NASDAQ
definitions. We look forward to announcing these people as the processes are completed. Thank you for your
continued support.


Sincerely,


The Cellceutix Team

Ouch! I believe that will leave a mark tomorrow. If anyone is still short this stock, you better cut your losses early
tomorrow. CTIX longs know what they own. Delays are a way of life when dealing with the FDA. The trials progress at

Thanks for documenting the historic record related to CTIX's ascension to a NASDAQ. It would appear Leo has had
his eye on an uplisting for a number of years and therefore must be well on the way to meeting all requirements. I look
forward to CTIX's announcements detailing the uplist plan. CTIX has so much going for it in 2015. Leo is wise to uplist
now in an effort to capitalize on the inevitable demand from institutional investors.

Bleaker,


Cant wait for your next reading of the so called FAILED CTIX Tea Leaves...what are you batting currently.....0 for at
least 3 right? Maybe you can team up w/ NBCs Brian Williams and you two can concoct some story about how you
sent a Drone to Leos office to spy, it revealed Corporate Malfeasance while peaking through the windows..than
Crashed and Burned as Leo was shooting it down...all the while you were sitting in your Car with the Radio Controls
and Joy Stick humming and took fire from the your Drone which turned upon when it realized you were the real Villian
in this new Episode of your upcoming made for TV picture....Valley of The Leo/Menon Drones--it takes more than 2 to
succeed?


LOL!


Sorry thats the best I could SPIN so early in the AM!
