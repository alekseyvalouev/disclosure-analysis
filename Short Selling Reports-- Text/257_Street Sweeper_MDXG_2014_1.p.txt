MiMedx: Not What The Doctor Ordered
Mar. 21, 2014 11:30 AM ET10 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Company hands out over 1 million shares of stock and options worth over $7 million
to doctor consultants and medical advisory board members.


Practices raise ethical questions, risk of federal violations that have damaged other
companies.


Company market cap of about $740 million greatly exceeds estimated $500 million
“skin substitution” market.


Doctors, insiders, employees hold options/warrants on over 16 million shares of
stock at 90 cents to $2.46.


Analyst slaps MiMedx with lack-luster “market perform” and notes looming
uncertainties, issues.


Human placenta products peddler MiMedx (NASDAQ:MDXG) is handing out company
stock like candy to doctors who "evaluate technologies" or act as consultants,
TheStreetSweeper has learned.


One doctor got tens of thousands of shares of common stock without paying one single
dime. Another prominent doctor on the company's medical advisory board received
options on 200,000 shares.


The company has doled out roughly 1.2 million shares of stock and options to its
influential doctor friends - shares now worth more than $7 million - as its chief executive,
Parker Petit, prepares to go on trial perhaps as early as next month for an alleged insider
trading scheme.


Despite that, the company's stock price is screaming, shoving the market cap into the
stratosphere. The company is now valued at about $740 million, much higher than the
entire "skin substitution" market estimated at $500 million.


Paid to do what?

MiMedx uses doctors in speaking bureaus, consulting and research. But filings also say
doctors educate others about "the efficacy and uses of our products." MiMedx's business
turns mothers' placental membranes into "EpiFix" material used to cover injuries such as
burns and diabetic foot sores, as well as "AmnioFix" for internal coverage uses such as
spinal surgery and tennis elbow.


The company's filings - pages 14 and 15 - describe some doctors' duties this way:


"… speaking to payers about our products in support of our reimbursement efforts."


The company also works with doctors "who may order our products or make decisions to
use them," according to this filing.


TheStreetSweeper asked the company for more details about the medical advisory board,
including whether MiMedx encourages doctors to use their products. We got some
answers back by email.


"Our selection of advisory board members is unrelated to their use of our products," said
the company's lawyer, Roberta McCaw.


MiMedx uses doctors to help deliver exciting business deals while it tiptoes past kickback
and false claims laws, suggests page 28 of this filing. But news reports show even big
pharma sometimes fall down the slippery slope into an embarrassing, expensive legal
hole that MiMedx could ill afford.


Just last November, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a $2.2 billion deal to settle government
charges on false marketing claims and paying kickbacks to doctors.


Doctors get cheap stock


For investors, there's also a personal piece to the problems inherent in MiMedx's fraud
lawsuit-saddled chief executive's use of the medical advisory board.


Unlike the average investor, some lucky doctors have had the option to buy their stock for
virtually pennies-on-the-dollar. The doctors now also get paid on a services rendered
basis, though the company lawyer wouldn't give details.


In recent years, each doctor is granted options to buy 15,000 shares of stock vested over
three years upon joining the medical advisory board, which has been whittled down to
about 14 members. So docs who joined in say, 2013, paid an average market value of
$3.08 for their options, while those in 2011 paid only an average 63 cents.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2102073-mimedx-not-what-the-doctor-ordered 3/9


MiMedx wasn't selling a nickel's worth of product several years ago. Back then, in 2008,
the company had more than 30 "key physician opinion leaders" on the company's advisory
board. The doctors' retainers ranged from $35,000 to $125,000 yearly and were allowed to
snap up thousands upon thousands of shares for $1 to $2.40 apiece, filings show.


One doctor, who has since left, joined the advisory board and was handed 50,000 shares
of common stock - absolutely free.


Two doctors, who have since left the board, received options to buy 50,000 to 100,000
shares apiece for just $1.80 each.


Recent information is sketchy because doctors' contracts typically have not been filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in the last couple of years.


"Our agreements with them are not material to our business and are not required to be
disclosed," said the lawyer, Ms. McCaw.


When asked why the company stopped the more transparent practice of filing such
contracts with the SEC, the company's lawyer took the time to write: "Unfortunately, I don't
have time to educate you on public company disclosure rules. Suffice it to say that we
have not changed our disclosure practices to be less transparent. The concept of what is
a material agreement is determined at the time disclosures are required."


Money, reputation, Medicare funding at stake


We are not saying MiMedx is doing something illegal. Illegal payments are generally those
that can be linked to a doctor's use of a certain device and violate federal kickback laws -
whether payments and benefits are intended to induce doctors to use company products.


Bioethicist Arthur Caplan told TheStreetSweeper that it is not always wrong in his view to
be a consultant for a medical company.


"What is wrong is to be paid to endorse or market products that a company is selling," said
Mr. Caplan, PhD and New York University Langone Medical Center's medical ethics
division director.


"Doctors should not be shills for pharma, biotech or device companies," he said.


"Serving on a DSMB (data and safety monitoring board) or working cooperatively to bring
a product to market is one thing," he added. "Acting as a paid spokesperson to promote a
drug or device only for the money is quite another."

Industry generally argues companies' payments to doctors can be a pathway toward
better health.


But critics say the financial ties can unduly influence medical decisions, make healthcare
more expensive through the encouragement of non-generics and keep patients in the dark
about their doctors receiving these payments tied to medical device companies.


TheStreetSweeper has requested interviews with doctors tied to MiMedx in hopes of
getting details, including whether they disclose these financial ties to patients. They have
not responded. Investors may find other positive and negative takes on MiMedx HERE.


One of MiMedx's most prominent advisory board members, Dr. Thomas Zdeblick, a
boyish-faced Wisconsin surgeon made The New York Times - and got first-hand
knowledge of the problems that can develop from this touchy subject.


Dr. Zdeblick was paid $400,000 a year by Medtronics under a consulting contract that
required him to work just eight days a year, the Times article noted. Those payments
stopped in 2004 but that didn't make the situation any less trying when it hit the spotlight
two years later. Dr. Zdeblick also did not respond to our request for comment.


Company filings note that such financially tied relationships could damage MiMedx's and
doctors' reputations and, if found to be illegal, ultimately lead to fines, and civil/criminal
penalties. Another business-killing risk is that the company "could also be excluded from
federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for non-
compliance."


The last thing MiMedx would welcome now is more scrutiny from a federal agency that's
already sharpening its teeth to attempt to convince the court that MiMedx leader, Mr. Petit,
has broken federal securities laws.


Warrants, options


The company's insiders, employees, consultants and paid doctors all hold options and
warrants to purchase tons of MiMedx stock as of the end of the year. A whopping 16.6
million shares.


These shares were super cheap. The stock sells for around $7 now. But those shares'
exercise price range from an average of $2.46 down to just 90 cents each.

Comments (10)


Just this week, a Northland Capital Markets analyst bloodied MiMedx's nose with a rather
bearish report that slaps the company with a lack-luster "market perform."


The analyst's channel checks uncovered issues ahead, partially because the company's
EpiFix use is now driven by "favorable billing, not necessarily clinical outcomes."


While the company should not miss numbers this year, he wrote: "The fear though is that
beginning next year EpiFix would run into the same issues as other tissues are going
through currently."


Under the new insurance plan changes forced by healthcare reform, he noticed an
alarming but understandable worry. Target patients with foot ulcers and other wounds are
finding that, without supplemental insurance, they're facing thousands of dollars in out-of-
pocket costs when doctors use a skin substitution product on them. This is creating, he
said, "a pause in the marketplace."


Conclusion


With MiMedx stock prices screaming near record highs - against the uncertainty of the
CEO's fraud lawsuit, MiMedx's propensity to thumb its nose at federal regulators and
investors, the market cap exceeding the estimated skin market, the lack of transparency,
the looming market issues and now our exposure of those doctors' cozy payments -
MiMedx is not what the doctor ordered.

Seems to be a narrow line between what StreetSweeper is doing by writing this article and their claims against
MiMedx. 
Just my opinion here so don't get to crazy. M.

A little background on streetsweeper whose founder is a convicted felon according to the US government with tied to
the Gambino crime family


I read the article “Melissa Davis of Streetsweepr in Bed with Short Sellers and Convicted Felons” See:
http://bit.ly/1d8c23U


This article speaks of her work “couched in innuendo, inflammatory language, misdirection, and logical fallacies. Her
heavy reliance upon verbal gymnastics and sensationalism calls her motives into question. In our view, this is one
“journalist” whose work just can’t be relied upon. “


This same company that came under her disparaging remarks fought back with a the above article and “attorneys
have sent a cease and desist letter to Davis and The Street Sweeper for numerous false and defamatory statements
concerning RedChip and its employees. “


And then some contributors at http://bit.ly/1d8c0Jt posted their own opinion of Ms. Davis and The Street Sweeper
saying, “They have become as crooked as the company they are trying to expose”


Her bio definitely appears to be exaggerated regarding her “seven years as one of the top investigative reporters at
TheStreet.com”


http://bit.ly/1d8c244


Apparently, she was just writing articles at home.


How about folks at Motley Fool? Below is a blog post regarding Ms. Davis and her profiting from sensationalism, poor
journalism, and fraud.


http://bit.ly/1d8c0Jw


There is an obvious pattern when researching “The Street Sweeper.”


In my opinion, Melissa Davis clearly is into tabloid journalism. She wraps her arms around Jim Cramer and then
shorts a stock when he trashes it on his show.


Consider this from http://bit.ly/1d8c2kr. “I find it interesting that Jim Cramer has his arm around Melissa in a photo on

the TheStreetSweeper.org site and he slammed SWSH shortly after her article. How many shares did he short?”


Cary Spivak wrote, “Short on Ethics? Two Web sites that investigate business fraud are funded by short selling—
placing market bets that the stock of companies they write about will go down. It’s an approach that makes journalism
ethicist very uncomfortable.”


Apparently, Melissa is in plenty of bad company. There are several web sites masking themselves as investigative
journalism whereby struggling journalist have discovered that by shorting a stock prior to their story, they can get rich
quick. Barry Minkow has made his living doing this after his stint in prison. I read his book several years ago, called
“Cleaning Up”.


Melissa's web site partner is Hunter Adams. “Hunter Adams, the brains behind The Street Sweeper
(thestreetsweeper.org), helped launch the site last year, just eight years after federal prosecutors labeled him an
associate of the Gambino crime family in New York. Adams, who was convicted for his role in a massive "pump and
dump" scheme involving penny stocks, is still on federal probation for his crime. “


I find it rather hypocritical that Melissa cites BRLI as having ties to the Gambino family when she herself is working
with Mr. Hunter who did prison time for his association with the Gambino's.


After reviewing several of Melissa's articles, they all follow the same pattern. Short a company, then use the internet,
youtube, media, etc to profit by shorting it.


I think BRLI is oversold. I'm not interested in anything Melissa Davis and her cronies at The Street Sweeper are
saying by profiting from tabloid journalism.


I'm going to watch "The Tools." Phil mentioned using an Option Strategy called a Strangle that could be effective.
Even something as simple as a basic CALL option may be helpful if indeed BRLI is at the bottom.


I'm more inclined to listen to our BRLI Sales Rep's opinion of MANAGEMENT, my wife's belief in BRLI's MOAT and
the MEANING it has to her, and my understanding of its MOS.

Sonya Colberg joined TheStreetSweeper in early 2012 as a senior investigative reporter after racking up an
impressive pile of journalism awards for her past work at two major daily newspapers


The Oklahoman? That is a major daily newspaper?

illustrious investigative reporters Melissa Davis and Sonya Colberg

Since Ms Colberg seems so very concerned about the ethics of what doctors get paid to test and promote
potentially life-saving technologies, perhaps she could demonstrate her ethical superiority by disclosing what
she gets paid to write hit pieces about the companies her boss has shorted.

It's a really sleazy business to be sure. It's funny..I think I read it is generally against their policy for their writers to
have positions in stocks they write about but they see nothing unethical about shorting a stock and then paying an
employee to attack the company and SA apparently has no issue publishing garbage. In terms of Streetsweeper, I
think the fact that the founder is a convicted felon with mob ties according to the US government, I don't think we can
can expect much in the way of ethics, do you?

First off, thanks homebuilder-watcher for enlightening me on streetsweeper. I have learned ,over time to trust my gut.
Sounds like they have one hell of a racket going. Is it legal? It is groups like them who make investing by little guys
like me a bit more difficult. Just reaffirms what everybody says. Do your own DD!  
I must say that I am enjoying investing immensely. Makes my retirement more exciting. I may be wrong but I believe
streetsweeper did a similar hatchet job on another one of my stocks a while back. Tearlab.

Yes this is what they do for a living. They take a short position in stocks they believe they can manipulate. Then, they
have their shrill, with those "award winning investigative journalists" from world recognized newspapers like
Oklahoman to write garbage unsupported by facts who submit the "articles" to SA which has zero standards for
publication...you can even be founded by a felon convicted of stock fraud. Then, after they have made their money
they cover their short and move on to the next victim and the stock recovers. If you have been in MDXG for a while,
you saw the same thing happen last year by a different outfit with the same result with the stock. I say another outfit
but who know, could be the same people different name. These bottom feeders will also be in bed with certain hedge
finds (yes there are hedge funds who are happy to operate in the grey area of the law to make money). Legitimate
hedge funds won't associate with outfits like Streetsweeper but plenty of scum in the hedge fund biz.
