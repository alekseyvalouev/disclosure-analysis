Insulet: Analysts Confirm Our Views on Valuation and Competitive Pressures in 2017­
2018


In our initial report on Insulet Corporation (PODD), our primary focus was on
 
(1) PODD's excessive and unexplained valuation
(2) undisclosed Omnipod patient deaths
(3) risks to 28,000 children who use the Omnipod
(4) a continuing increase in FDA reported adverse events, and
(5) whistleblower allegations of patient death cover-up and a pay-o� to presumably silence the whistleblower.
 
We erred in not focusing more of our attention (i.e. just one paragraph) on an obvious competitive gap that
exists for PODD in 2017-2018. We failed to drive home the fact that PODD's competitors are developing next
generation products and at least two competitors, including the market leader, Medtronic (MDT) and Johnson
& Johnson (JNJ) have new products that will enter the market in the next few months. For example, MDT has a
recently approved product, the 670G (i.e. September '16). This is a next-generation product commonly
referred to as an arti�cial pancreas ("AP"). As discussed in our initial report, PODD's President argued this
device doesn't impact the Omnipod because it is not approved for children - which represent 30% of PODD's
patient base. Analysts ignored the obvious fact that the other 70% of PODD's customer base can and may be
tempted to try and could transition to these new AP devices. PODD is just now initiating a clinical trial of its
competing AP device and does not expect it to enter the market until late 2018/2019. Therefore, MDT has a
clear competitive advantage over the Omnipod until "late 2018" according to PODD's President herself -
THERE IS A 2-YEAR PRODUCT GAP where Omnipod should struggle to compete in a fast-paced highly
innovative market.
 
Our takeaways from yesterday's investor day:
 
1. Our initial report outlined 5 key thesis points presented above. Not one of these topics was discussed at
the investor day by analysts or management. When the management of a public company refuse to answer
questions on a topic it is because they are human and they may not wish to engage in a discussion about
in�ammatory topic such as those we included in our initial report. However, they do not have a right to hide
or not fully disclose material events or facts from their shareholders. We believe that is what is happening
now and that it is only a matter of time before these 5 issues pose legitimate problems for PODD's
management and by association, its shareholders.
 
2. Yesterday we emailed the 16 analysts covering PODD analysts our initial report and numerous questions
they could have asked at the investor day event. None of these questions were asked. We are not surprised.
Sell-side analysts are called "sell-side" for a reason and they are not compensated to obtain and report on

topics that present a negative view of the companies they cover. However, ignoring information we present to
them may cross a line. We'll see how they react. Thus far, we have only seen 2 of 16 analysts release notes or
updates about PODD following yesterday's event.
 
3. We noted that the ongoing FDA investigation, another topic we did not necessarily emphasize in our initial
report, was not addressed on the investor day call. This investigation has been ongoing for 20 months now. It
poses a substantial risk to a 1-product company such as PODD. A prominent attorney who litigates cases
involving FDA and medical device product defect and fraud actions and a medical device expert we consulted
both con�rmed that an ongoing FDA investigation lasting over 20 months is a sign of serious unresolved
issues. Yet PODD management, the least transparent management team we have seen in some time, refuse
to update shareholders on this topic.
 
4. We explained the competitive pressures PODD is facing above. Here is the evidence:
 
(i) PODD will not have a next-generation arti�cial pancreas device until late 2018/2019 according to its own
President.

(ii) MDT already has an FDA approved articial pancreas device

(iii) The competition in the arti�cial pancreas space is diverse and substantial, in our initial report we noted 10
companies are working on AP products.
 
5. Below we see the analysts con�rm our views on valuation and competitive pressures in 2017 and 2018.

"…our hesitancy regarding near-term (2017/2018) revenue growth is unchanged."
 
"…we note current valuations - 5.1x 2017 street estimates - do not re�ectan attractive entry point
given limited near-term revenue catalysts and an increasingly competitive pump environment."
 
"with the Horizon system not slated for US launch until late 2019, multiple players are expected to
launch advanced pump platforms before Insulet. Speci�cally, Medtronic's 670g (2Q/17), Animas/J&J'
advanced pump platform (4Q/17), Tandem Diabetes (4Q/17), and Bigfoot Biomedical (2019)."
 
"Competitors are working to develop similar wireless technologies to achieve insulin delivery. If these
products are able to reach market before Insulet is able to fully establish itself within the community,
competitive headwinds would likely a�ect Insulet's ability to meet forward expectations."
 
Morgan Stanley
 
"If '17/'18 growth can be sustained while the pipeline is less robust…"
 
"Competitive product launches could keep OmniPod share �at instead of increasing"
 
"Near-term growth is likely the larger question for investors" Well there it is, a bit understated, but this is
the truth!
 
Raymond James
 
"The pipeline is more back-end loaded (2018/19 contributors)" Now that is some good spin, translation,
watch out!
 
"…the international ramp (~$225M RJe from ~$72M in 2016E) could prove a tad aggressive given their
current footprint in key markets." Just a tad he says…everything will be ok, maybe?
 
Conclusion
 
The market believed the competitive e�ect of MDT's 670G felt by Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) would also be felt
by PODD. This is why PODD's stock dropped to $30.69 on November 3, 2016. These 3 analyst notes issued
today re-emphasize and con�rm the signi�cant competitive pressure that MDT's newly approved AP device
will have on PODD through at least 2018. We reiterate a $15 price target. This stock is a strong sell.
