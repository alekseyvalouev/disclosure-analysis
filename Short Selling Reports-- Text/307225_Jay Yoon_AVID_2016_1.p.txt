Avid	Technology:	Strong	Sell	Due	To	Accounting	Concerns,	Legal
Concerns,	Deteriorating	Performance,	And	Looming	Covenant
Violation

Summary


Avid	Technology	uses	misleading	reporting	methods	which	significantly	inflate	its
results.	For	example,	in	1H'16,	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	customer
support	revenue	inflated	its	Non-GAAP	revenue	by	$49.9	million.


Using	a	more	accurate	method	of	calculating	EBITDA,	I	estimate	the	Company's
1H'16	Adjusted	EBITDA	was	a	loss	of	$13.3	million.	This	is	$81	million	lower	than
reported	1H'16	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$67.9	million.


Management's	2H'16	Adjusted	FCF	target	of	$42-52	million	is	highly	unrealistic.	I
estimate	the	Company	will	likely	miss	this	target	by	$54-64	million.


Avid	Technology	appears	to	have	violated	SEC	regulations	by	utilizing	cookie	jar
accounting	methods.	Also,	its	controversial	customer	support	policy	change	in
October	2015	may	have	violated	FTC	laws.


Over	the	next	12	months,	the	Company	will	likely	violate	its	leverage	ratio	covenant
and	will	likely	need	to	complete	a	significant	secondary	offering	to	remain	solvent.


Avid	Technology	(NASDAQ:AVID)	("AVID"	or	the	"Company")	provides	digital	audio
workstation	("DAW")	and	video	editing	software	primarily	to	professionals	in	the	music	and
film	/	TV	industry.	Since	reporting	its	Q2	2016	earnings	on	August	3rd,	AVID	shares	have
increased	over	18%,	from	$6.67	to	its	current	share	price	of	$7.88	(as	of	September	12th).
In	comparison	to	its	52-week	low	of	$5.26	on	May	19th,	the	Company's	share	price	has
increased	almost	50%.	Based	on	this	large	increase	in	share	price,	it	appears	that	many
investors	believe	AVID's	recent	results	are	an	indication	of	a	turnaround	in	the	business.
However,	I	believe	that	this	optimism	is	misplaced	for	a	number	of	reasons.


For	starters,	AVID	appears	to	have	misled	investors	by	using	reporting	methods	which
significantly	inflate	its	financial	results.	For	example,	the	Company's	Non-GAAP	revenue
and	Adjusted	EBITDA	have	been	artificially	boosted	by	the	inclusion	of	pre-2011	deferred

revenue	and	accelerated	customer	support	revenue.	These	uneconomic	revenue
sources	inflated	1H	2016	Non-GAAP	revenue	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	by	$49.9	million.


When	its	performance	is	calculated	on	a	more	normalized	basis,	AVID	appears	to	be
under	considerable	financial	distress.	For	example,	in	1H	2016,	AVID	reported	an
Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$67.9	million	(24.4%	margin).	However,	pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of
pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	customer	support	revenue,	the	Company's	1H
2016	Adjusted	EBITDA	would	have	been	just	$18.0	million	(7.9%	margin).


Later	in	this	article,	I	will	walkthrough	an	alternative	method	of	calculating	Adjusted
EBITDA	which	is	based	on	billings	rather	than	Non-GAAP	revenue.	I	believe	this	method
most	closely	reflects	the	true	performance	of	the	Company's	business.	Using	this
billings-based	method,	I	estimate	that	the	Company's	Adjusted	EBITDA	was	a	loss
of	$13.3	million	in	1H	2016.	Thus,	although	AVID	appears	to	be	comfortably	profitable
based	on	reported	numbers,	in	reality	it	is	a	significant	loss-making	business.


Another	point	of	concern	for	investors	is	the	fact	that	the	Company	is	likely	to	miss	its
2H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	guidance	by	a	significant	amount.	In	2H	2016,	AVID	is
projecting	that	it	will	generate	$42-52	million	of	Adjusted	FCF.	This	represents	a	massive
increase	of	$81-91	million	from	its	reported	1H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	loss	of	$39.6	million.
As	I	will	later	demonstrate,	I	believe	the	Company	will	miss	its	aggressive	Adjusted	FCF
target	by	a	considerable	amount.	Using	more	reasonable	assumptions,	I	project	that
2H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	will	be	a	loss	of	$12.4	million,	which	is	$54-64	million	lower
than	AVID's	target.


In	addition	to	providing	misleading	financial	reports	and	unrealistic	guidance	targets,	it
appears	that	AVID	may	have	violated	FTC	laws	through	a	recent	support	policy
change.	In	Q3	2015,	the	Company	made	the	decision	to	no	longer	provide	free	bug	fixes
to	its	customers.	This	change	in	policy	was	made	just	one	year	after	it	had	explicitly
communicated	that	bug	fixes	would	continue	to	be	free.	The	fact	that	the	Company	is
treating	its	customers	so	poorly	is	highly	concerning.	Also	concerning	is	the	fact	that	AVID
may	have	violated	FTC	laws	with	its	"bait-and-switch"	tactics.


Unfortunately	for	AVID	investors,	the	legal	/	regulatory	worries	do	not	end	there.	It	appears
that	the	Company	may	have	also	recently	violated	SEC	regulations	through	the	use
of	cookie	jar	accounting	methods.	By	no	longer	providing	free	bug	fixes,	it	was	able	to
accelerate	the	recognition	of	its	deferred	customer	support	revenue.	Instead	of
appropriately	recognizing	all	of	this	accelerated	support	revenue	in	Q3	2015,	the
Company	delayed	the	recognition	of	a	large	portion	of	this	revenue	to	Q1	2016.	By	doing

so,	AVID	was	able	artificially	prop	up	its	1H	2016	results.	Such	cookie	jar	accounting
tactics	are	specifically	outlawed	by	the	SEC	and	could	lead	to	an	investigation	into	AVID's
accounting	practices.


Going	forward,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	challenging	financial	situation	is	unlikely	to
improve	anytime	soon.	Over	the	past	few	years,	AVID	has	been	steadily	losing	market
share	to	competitors	like	Apple	(NASDAQ:AAPL)	and	Adobe	(NASDAQ:ADBE).	The
Company's	growth	has	also	been	negatively	impacted	by	slowing	demand	from
professionals	in	the	audio	and	video	industry.	Recently,	AVID	management	has	pointed	to
the	growth	of	its	subscription	business	as	an	indication	that	its	performance	is	improving.
However,	although	the	number	of	subscribers	has	grown,	the	growth	in	sales	from
subscriptions	has	actually	grinded	to	a	halt.	Thus,	the	subscription	business	is	unlikely
to	turn	around	the	Company's	financial	performance.


Overall,	I	believe	AVID	is	an	attractive	short	opportunity	at	the	current	share	price	of	$7.88.
Over	the	next	three	to	six	months,	I	expect	that	the	Company	will	be	forced	to	lower	its
unrealistic	2H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	target	by	a	significant	amount.	When	this	happens,	I
expect	AVID	shares	to	quickly	correct	back	to	the	$5	range.	This	represents	a
discount	of	almost	37%	to	the	current	share	price.


Over	the	longer	term,	I	expect	that	the	Company's	share	price	will	fall	well	below	the	$5
level.	Within	the	next	12	months,	I	believe	AVID	will	run	into	significant	liquidity	issues	and
will	also	violate	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.	In	order	to	avoid	a	default,	AVID	will	likely
need	to	raise	a	large	amount	of	capital	via	a	highly	dilutive	secondary	offering.
Based	on	these	future	catalysts	(liquidity	and	covenant	issues),	I	expect	that	the
Company's	share	price	will	eventually	fall	to	the	low	single	digits.	Thus,	my	longer-term
price	target	for	AVID	is	around	$2.50	per	share.	This	represents	a	discount	of	over	68%
to	the	current	share	price.


AVID's	Share	Price	Has	Significantly	Appreciated	Since	Q2	Earnings


On	August	3rd,	AVID	reported	its	Q2	2016	financial	results.	The	Company	reported	that	its
Q2	2016	bookings,	adjusted	free	cash	flow	and	Non-GAAP	operating	expenses	were	in
line	with	guidance,	while	Non-GAAP	revenue	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	were	above	guidance.
Provided	below	is	a	table	comparing	the	Company's	Q2	2016	actual	results	versus
guidance:

As	part	of	its	Q2	2016	earnings	release,	AVID	also	updated	its	FY	2016	guidance.	The
Company	raised	its	full-year	2016	non-GAAP	revenue	(from	$500-525	million	to	$535-565
million)	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	guidance	(from	$60-75	million	to	$118-135	million),	while
reaffirming	its	guidance	for	adjusted	free	cash	flow	and	bookings.	Included	below	is	a
summary	of	AVID's	revised	FY	2016	guidance	as	provided	in	the	company's	Q2	2016
earnings	release:


On	the	surface,	the	Company's	Q2	results	appeared	to	be	quite	encouraging.	AVID	met	or
beat	all	of	its	guidance	targets	for	the	quarter,	and	reaffirmed	or	raised	all	of	its	full-year
2016	targets.	As	a	result	of	these	seemingly	positive	results,	the	Company's	stock	price
has	appreciated	a	significant	amount	since	reporting	Q2	earnings.	From	August	3rd	to
September	12th,	the	stock	price	has	increased	over	18%	from	$6.67	to	$7.88.	Thus,	some
investors	appear	to	believe	the	Company's	Q2	results	are	an	indication	of	a	potential
turnaround	in	the	business.	However,	as	I	will	demonstrate	in	the	next	few	sections,
AVID's	recent	financial	performance	is	not	nearly	impressive	as	the	Company	has
portrayed.


Continued	Amortization	of	Pre-2011	Deferred	Revenue	Has	Inflated	YTD	Financial
Results


A	good	portion	of	this	article	will	be	dedicated	to	discussing	the	misleading	manner	in
which	AVID	presents	its	financials.	The	first	issue	that	I	will	discuss	in	regard	to	the
Company's	financial	reporting	is	the	manner	in	which	deferred	revenue	has	inflated	its
financial	results.

In	a	June	2015	report,	Copperfield	Research	voiced	their	concerns	over	the	degree	to
which	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	has	boosted	AVID's	financial	results.	I	will	not	go	into	as
great	of	depth	as	Copperfield	in	discussing	this	issue.	Instead,	I	will	simply	summarize	the
key	points.	If	you	would	like	to	read	a	more	detailed	analysis,	I	would	recommend	reading
Copperfield's	report.


One	of	the	contributors	to	AVID's	inflated	results	is	the	difference	in	the	length	of
amortization	of	its	pre-2011	versus	post-2010	deferred	revenue.	During	an
investigation	into	its	accounting	practices	in	2013,	AVID	was	found	to	have	inappropriately
recognized	a	large	amount	of	customer	support	revenue	for	transactions	occurring	prior	to
January	1,	2011.	The	discovery	of	this	accounting	error	forced	the	Company	to	undertake
a	massive	accounting	restatement	effort,	which	was	eventually	completed	in	September
2014.


As	part	of	its	accounting	restatement	effort,	AVID	re-categorized	its	deferred	revenue
liabilities	into	two	buckets:	(1)	pre-2011	deferred	revenue;	and	(2)	post-2010	deferred
revenue.	Pre-2011	deferred	revenue	represents	unrecognized	revenue	for	billings
occurring	prior	to	January	1,	2011.	Post-2010	deferred	revenue	represents	unrecognized
revenue	for	billings	occurring	after	January	1,	2011.


For	reasons	which	are	unclear,	AVID	management	decided	to	amortize	its	pre-2011
deferred	revenue	over	a	much	longer	time	period	than	its	post-2010	deferred	revenue.
Most	of	the	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	is	being	amortized	over	approximately	six	years.
By	contrast,	post-2010	deferred	revenue	is	amortized	over	a	much	shorter	time	period	of
three	or	four	years.


The	longer	amortization	period	of	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	has	artificially	boosted
AVID's	1H	2016	revenue	and	profits.	If	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	had	been	amortized
over	the	same	time	frame	as	post-2010	deferred	revenue,	then	it	would	have	been	fully
amortized	by	the	end	of	FY	2013	or	FY	2014.	However,	due	to	its	longer	amortization
period,	a	substantial	amount	of	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	is	still	being	amortized	as
revenue	in	FY	2016.	The	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	that	is	still	being	amortized	today
does	not	represent	an	actual	economic	gain	for	the	business.	It	is	merely	an	accounting
remnant	from	orders	(and	cash)	that	AVID	received	over	six	years	ago.	Thus,	I	am	not
sure	why	management	is	including	this	in	the	Company's	reported	Non-GAAP	revenue
results.

In	Q1	and	Q2	FY	2016,	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	amortization	contributed	$9.3	million
and	$7.8	million	to	total	revenue,	respectively.	This	revenue	is	recognized	at	a	100%
margin,	since	all	of	the	costs	were	expensed	in	periods	prior	to	FY	2011.	Thus,	pre-2011
deferred	revenue	amortization	inflated	AVID's	revenue	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	by	$9.3
million	in	Q1	2016	and	$7.8	million	in	Q2	2016.


Accelerated	Recognition	Of	Deferred	Customer	Support	Revenue	Has	Further
Boosted	Results


In	addition	to	the	continued	recognition	of	pre-2011	deferred	revenue,	AVID's	YTD	results
have	also	been	artificially	boosted	by	the	accelerated	recognition	of	deferred
customer	support	revenue.	In	Q3	2015,	the	Company	decided	that	it	would	no	longer
provide	bug	fixes	to	its	customers	free	of	charge.	Instead,	AVID	decided	that	only
customers	with	an	active	paid	support	plan	would	receive	these	updates.


Prior	to	this	change,	it	provided	free	bug	fixes	to	its	customers	for	the	lifetime	of	the
product,	which	could	span	a	few	years.	To	account	for	this	ongoing	support	element,	the
Company	booked	a	certain	portion	of	its	product	sales	as	deferred	customer	support
revenue	and	amortized	it	over	multiple	years.	However,	under	the	new	policy,	the
Company	was	no	longer	required	to	provide	bug	fixes	to	customers	without	a	support
plan.	As	a	result,	AVID	was	able	accelerate	the	recognition	of	customer	support	revenue
for	some	of	its	products.


For	example,	in	2H	2015,	AVID	accelerated	the	recognition	of	customer	support
revenue	for	its	Media	Composer	8.0	product.	This	resulted	in	the	accelerated
recognition	of	$22.5	million	of	revenue.	Due	to	the	100%	margin	nature	of	this	revenue,
Adjusted	EBITDA	and	net	income	were	also	boosted	by	the	same	amount.


In	Q1	and	Q2	2016,	based	on	its	updated	customer	support	policy,	AVID	once	again
accelerated	the	recognition	of	some	of	its	deferred	revenue.	This	time,	the	Company
accelerated	the	recognition	of	customer	support	revenue	for	its	Pro	Tools	12	product.	The
accelerated	recognition	of	deferred	Pro	Tools	12	support	revenue	increased	AVID's
1H	FY	2016	revenue	by	$32.8	million.	This,	in	turn,	also	increased	YTD	Adjusted
EBITDA	and	net	income	by	the	same	amount.	Thus,	the	Company's	YTD	financial	results
were	significantly	boosted	by	this	accounting	change.


The	accelerated	recognition	of	deferred	customer	support	revenue	does	not	represent	an
economic	gain	for	AVID.	The	$32.8	million	of	additional	revenue	and	profits	that	the
Company	recognized	in	Q1	and	Q2	2016	will	not	translate	into	cash	or	future	cash	for	the
business.	AVID	is	simply	taking	years	of	future	deferred	revenue	and	recognizing	it	all	in	a

compressed	time	frame.	This	only	serves	to	create	a	significant,	but	unsustainable	short-
term,	boost	in	revenue	and	profits.	Thus,	like	pre-2011	deferred	revenue,	the	accelerated
recognition	of	customer	support	revenue	has	significantly	inflated	the	Company's	YTD
results.


For	further	details	on	the	customer	support	policy	change,	AVID's	FY	2015	10K	(pg.	34	-
35)	and	Q2	2016	10Q	(pg.	7)	provide	a	more	detailed	description	of	the	policy	change	and
its	impact	on	reported	financials.


Normalized	Results	Reveal	The	Large	Degree	To	Which	AVID's	Results	Have	Been
Inflated


In	total,	it	can	be	calculated	that	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	the	accelerated
recognition	of	customer	support	revenue	boosted	1H	2016	revenue	and	profits	by	a
whopping	$49.9	million	($17.1	million	of	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	+	$32.8	million	of
accelerated	customer	support	revenue).	For	a	more	accurate	view	of	AVID's	financial
performance,	I	have	provided	1H	FY	2016	results	pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of	these
items:


The	above	figure	clearly	illustrates	the	large	degree	to	which	the	Company's	YTD	financial
performance	has	been	inflated.	In	Q1	2016,	Q2	2016	and	1H	2016,	AVID	reported
Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$38.5	million	(26.8%	margin),	$29.4	million	(21.9%	margin)	and	$67.9
million	(24.4%	margin),	respectively.	Based	on	these	figures,	some	investors	may
conclude	that	it	is	a	comfortably	profitable	business	generating	almost	$140	million	of
Adjusted	EBITDA	on	a	run	rate	basis.

However,	without	the	benefit	of	pre-2011	revenue	and	accelerated	customer	support
revenue,	Q1	2016	Adjusted	EBITDA	would	have	declined	from	$38.5	million	to	$11.6
million	(9.9%	margin).	Similarly,	in	Q2	2016,	Adjusted	EBITDA	would	have	declined	from
$29.4	million	to	just	$6.4	million	(5.7%).	Adding	it	all	up,	1H	2016	pro	forma	Adjusted
EBITDA	would	have	been	$18.0	million	(7.9%	margin).	Thus,	based	on	results	which
exclude	these	uneconomical	gains	in	revenue,	AVID	has	continued	to	struggle	to	generate
a	meaningful	profit	through	the	first	half	of	2016.


I	am	not	sure	why	AVID	includes	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	customer
support	revenue	in	its	Non-GAAP	revenue	results.	Typically,	Non-GAAP	financials	are
meant	to	show	financial	performance	in	a	manner	that	is	more	accurate	than	GAAP
accounting.	However,	in	the	case	of	AVID,	Non-GAAP	revenue	fails	to	properly	eliminate
the	distortion	of	revenue	created	by	its	deferred	revenue	recognition	methods.	As	a	result,
the	Company's	financial	results	are	difficult	to	comprehend	and	misleading	in	its
representation	of	business	performance.


Billings:	A	Better	Way	To	Measure	Top	Line	Performance


I	believe	that	a	more	straightforward	and	accurate	metric	for	measuring	AVID's	top
line	performance	is	billings.	Billings	represents	the	actual	amount	of	firm	orders	that	the
Company	has	received	from	customers	in	a	given	time	period.	This	means	that	the
customer	has	been	invoiced	and	has	paid	cash	or	is	obligated	to	pay	cash	in	the	near
future	for	their	order.


The	reason	why	billings	is	more	reflective	of	the	Company's	current	performance	than
Non-GAAP	revenue	is	because	there	is	no	deferred	component.	For	example,	if	AVID
sells	a	$10	software	license,	$10	is	recognized	as	billings	upfront.	By	comparison,	in	terms
of	Non-GAAP	revenue,	a	certain	portion	of	this	$10	is	recognized	immediately	as	revenue
and	the	remaining	amount	is	deferred.	As	I've	demonstrated	in	the	previous	sections,	the
manner	in	which	this	deferred	revenue	is	recognized	can	significantly	distort	reported	Non-
GAAP	revenue	from	period	to	period.	Billings	does	not	have	such	a	problem.


Although	AVID	does	not	explicitly	report	it,	billings	for	a	given	period	can	be	calculated	in
the	following	manner:


Billings	=	Non-GAAP	revenue	+	Additions	to	deferred	revenue	-	Amortized	deferred
revenue

As	an	example	of	how	billings	is	calculated,	suppose	that	a	company	reported	$20	of
annual	Non-GAAP	revenue.	Of	this	$20	of	Non-GAAP	revenue,	assume	$8	was	from	the
amortization	of	deferred	revenue	liabilities.	By	subtracting	$8	from	$20,	it	can	be
calculated	that	$12	of	Non-GAAP	revenue	was	from	orders	received	in	the	current	year.
Now,	suppose	that	the	company	received	$5	of	orders	which	are	not	recognized
immediately,	but	instead,	are	added	to	its	deferred	revenue	liabilities.	This	$5	represents
additions	to	deferred	revenue	from	orders	received	during	the	year.	By	adding	$12	to	$5,	it
can	be	calculated	that	$17	of	new	orders	was	received	during	the	year.	Thus,	by	definition,
billings	in	the	current	year	was	$17	(Billings	=	$20	+	$5	-	$8).


To	further	simplify	the	calculation	of	billings,	consider	the	following:


Change	in	deferred	revenue	liabilities	=	Additions	to	deferred	revenue	-	Amortized
deferred	revenue


Thus,	billings	can	be	calculated	with	the	following	simple	formula:


Billings	=	Non-GAAP	revenue	+	Change	in	deferred	revenue	liabilities


Analysis	of	Billings	Further	Reveal	AVID's	True	(Poor)	Financial	Performance


Having	walked	through	how	billings	is	calculated,	I	will	now	move	onto	analyzing	the
Company's	financial	performance	on	a	billings	basis.	In	the	figure	below,	I	have	calculated
AVID's	YTD	Adjusted	EBITDA	by	using	billings	in	the	place	of	Non-GAAP	revenue:


In	1H	2016,	the	Company's	billings-based	Adjusted	EBITDA	was	a	loss	of	$13.3
million.	This	is	over	$81.2	million	less	than	AVID's	reported	1H	2016	Adjusted
EBITDA	of	$67.9	million!	Thus,	a	billings-based	approach	reveals	that	AVID	is	actually	a

loss-making	business	from	an	Adjusted	EBITDA	perspective.	This	makes	more	sense
than	the	Company's	reported	Adjusted	EBITDA	given	that	Adjusted	FCF	was	a	loss	of
$39.6	million	in	1H	2016.


The	significant	difference	between	reported	and	billings-based	Adjusted	EBITDA	further
illustrates	the	large	degree	to	which	deferred	revenue	has	inflated	AVID's	YTD	financial
results.	Also	concerning	is	the	fact	that,	despite	having	recently	cut	$57	million	of
annual	costs,	it	is	still	a	significant	loss-making	business.	Finally,	billings-based
Adjusted	EBITDA	appears	to	be	trending	in	the	wrong	direction,	as	it	declined	sequentially
from	a	loss	of	$1.5	million	in	Q1	2016	to	a	loss	of	$11.8	million	in	Q2	2016.


Another	point	of	concern	for	AVID	investors	is	the	sharp	downward	trend	in	billings	over
the	past	few	years.	Provided	below	is	the	Company's	annual	billings	from	FY	2013	to	FY
2015:


At	the	end	of	June	2015,	AVID	completed	its	acquisition	of	Orad.	In	order	to	show	billings
on	an	organic	basis,	the	assumed	contribution	of	Orad	($13.1	million)	has	been	subtracted
from	reported	FY	2015	billings.


As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	the	Company's	pro	forma	billings	declined	sharply	from
$478.3	million	in	FY	2014	to	just	$423.4	million	in	FY	2015.	This	represents	a	year-over-
year	decline	of	$54.9	million,	or	11.5%.	Unfortunately	for	AVID,	this	downward	trend	has
continued	through	the	first	half	of	FY	2016.	Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of	the
Company's	1H	FY	2016	billings	versus	1H	FY	2015	billings:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 11/33


Pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of	Orad,	billings	once	again	declined	sharply	on	a	year-
over-year	basis,	from	$202.2	million	in	1H	2015	to	$183.9	million	in	1H	2016.	This
represents	a	decline	of	$18.3	million,	or	9.0%.	As	discussed	previously,	billings	represents
the	actual	amount	of	products	/	services	sold	by	AVID	to	its	customers	in	a	given	time
period.	Thus,	based	on	the	significant	decline	in	billings	in	FY	2015	and	the
continuation	of	this	decline	YTD,	it	appears	that	AVID	is	rapidly	losing	market	share
to	competitors.


The	fact	that	the	Company	is	losing	market	share	at	such	a	rapid	pace	should	be	very
concerning	for	AVID	investors.	As	of	the	end	of	Q2	2016,	the	Company	had	$192.8	million
of	debt	obligations.	In	addition	to	this,	AVID	reported	an	Adjusted	FCF	loss	of	$39.6	million
through	the	first	two	quarters	of	this	year.	Given	this	large	amount	of	debt	and	significant
ongoing	cash	burn,	it	will	be	very	difficult	for	the	Company	to	remain	solvent	if
billings	keep	trending	in	the	current	direction.


Also,	it	is	unlikely	that	the	Company	will	be	able	to	offset	future	billings	declines	with
further	cost-cutting	measures.	There	is	a	limit	to	how	much	costs	can	be	taken	out	of	a
company	without	impairing	business	operations.	To	this	point,	AVID	has	already	taken	$57
million	of	annualized	costs	out	of	the	business,	with	another	$19	million	of	annualized	cost
cuts	expected	by	the	end	of	FY	2016.	Thus,	given	the	large	amount	of	cost	cuts	that	it	has
already	incurred,	AVID	is	likely	close	to	reaching	the	maximum	limits	of	its	cost	reduction
efforts.


One	final	item	to	note	about	billings	is	how	much	lower	it	is	than	Non-GAAP	revenue	on	a
consistent	basis.	For	example,	in	FY	2015,	the	Company	reported	billings	of	$436.5
million,	which	was	$69.1	million	lower	than	reported	Non-GAAP	revenue	of	$505.6	million.
As	another	example,	in	1H	2016,	AVID	reported	billings	of	$197.0	million,	which	was	$81.2

million	lower	than	reported	Non-GAAP	revenue	of	$278.2	million.	The	fact	that	billings	is
significantly	lower	than	Non-GAAP	revenue	on	a	consistent	basis	further	illustrates	how
deferred	revenue	has	inflated	AVID's	financial	results.


Bookings	Is	Also	A	Misleading	Indicator	Of	Sales	Performance


Unfortunately,	AVID's	questionable	financial	reporting	does	not	end	with	its	representation
of	Non-GAAP	revenue.	In	addition	to	Non-GAAP	revenue,	the	other	metric	that	the
Company	provides	to	investors	as	a	measure	of	sales	performance	is	bookings.	For
reasons	which	I	will	discuss	in	this	section,	like	Non-GAAP	revenue,	AVID's	bookings
metric	is	also	a	highly	unreliable	and	misleading	indicator	of	sales	performance.


The	Company	defines	bookings	as	the	summation	of	the	following	three	components:	(1)
Revenue	from	orders	in	the	current	period,	(2)	Additions	to	deferred	revenue	in	current
period,	and	(3)	Backlog.	On	slide	3	of	its	Revenue	Model	presentation,	AVID	provided	the
following	diagram	which	illustrates	the	composition	of	bookings:


The	inclusion	of	backlog	in	bookings	is	the	primary	reason	why	bookings	is	an	unreliable
measure	of	sales	performance.	On	pg.	7	of	its	FY	2015	10K,	the	Company	defines
backlog	as	follows:


"...	orders	for	future	product	deliveries	or	services	that	have	not	yet	been	invoiced	by
us..."


Basically,	backlog	represents	potential	future	orders	that	AVID	has	not	yet	invoiced	the
customer	for.	According	to	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	21	of	the	same	10-K,	whether
or	not	backlog	will	translate	into	a	firm	order	carries	a	great	deal	of	uncertainty:



http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AVID/2662628592x0x819194/E4F1E5A5-6650-4A9A-A5AA-BF771EF9AE32/Revenue_Modeling_Tool_-_Posted_on_3-17-2015_Condensed_.pdf

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 13/33


"To	the	extent	that	our	customers	cancel	their	orders	with	us	or	reduce	their
requirements	during	a	particular	period	for	any	reason,	we	will	not	realize	revenue
or	profit	from	the	associated	revenue	backlog.	Even	where	a	project	proceeds	as
scheduled,	it	is	possible	that	the	customer	may	default	and	fail	to	pay	amounts	owed
to	us."


Given	these	facts,	a	couple	problems	with	including	backlog	in	bookings	become
apparent.	First,	the	inclusion	of	backlog	makes	bookings	a	poor	measure	of	current	sales
performance,	because	both	future	orders	(backlog)	and	current	orders	are	included	in	this
metric.	The	second	problem	is	that	management	has	a	lot	of	leeway	in	determining	the
amount	of	its	estimated	backlog.	Thus,	bookings	can	be	distorted	or	inflated	depending	on
how	management	decides	what	is	or	is	not	backlog.


A	simple	comparison	of	AVID's	annual	bookings	and	billings	from	FY	2013	to	FY	2015
seems	to	confirm	my	concerns:


As	shown	above,	for	the	past	three	years,	annual	bookings	has	been	at	least	$40	million
greater	than	billings.	In	FY	2015,	bookings	was	over	$100	million	higher	than	billings!
Thus,	it	appears	that	the	disconnect	between	bookings	and	billings	has	recently	become
more	pronounced.


From	this	analysis,	it	should	be	clear	that	bookings	is	a	misleading	metric	which	inflates
AVID's	sales	performance.	As	discussed	previously,	billings	provides	an	accurate
representation	of	current	sales	performance,	because	it	represents	the	actual	amount	of
firm	orders	received	in	a	given	period.	Thus,	if	bookings	was	a	reliable	measure	of	sales
performance,	it	should	closely	track	billings	on	a	year-to-year	basis.	However,	as
demonstrated	in	the	figure	above,	annual	bookings	has	been	consistently	higher	than
billings	by	a	considerable	amount.


Overall,	the	use	of	bookings	as	a	performance	metric	further	illustrates	the	misleading
nature	of	AVID's	financial	reporting.	Given	the	sharp	decline	in	billings	over	the	past
few	years,	it	appears	that	management	may	be	emphasizing	inflated	metrics	like
Non-GAAP	revenue	and	bookings	in	order	to	cover	up	the	deterioration	in	its	top
line.	At	the	very	least,	the	use	of	such	flawed	metrics	calls	into	question	the	credibility	and
judgement	of	management.

AVID's	Misleading	Reporting	Methods	Have	Confused	Both	Investors	and	Research
Analysts


Many	investors	do	not	appear	to	understand	the	degree	to	which	AVID's	YTD	performance
has	been	inflated	by	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	customer	support
revenue	recognition.	As	I	just	demonstrated,	on	a	billings	basis,	the	Company	generated	a
run	rate	Adjusted	EBITDA	loss	of	$26.6	million	in	the	YTD	period	(-$13.3	million	*	2).	In
addition	to	this,	from	Q1	2016	to	Q2	2016,	billings-based	Adjusted	EBITDA	declined	from
a	loss	of	$1.5	million	to	a	loss	of	$11.8	million.	Despite	such	poor	results,	AVID's	stock
price	has	increased	over	18%	since	releasing	its	Q2	2016	earnings	report.	If	investors
truly	understood	just	how	poor	the	Company's	YTD	results	were,	I	believe	its	stock	price
would	have	declined	rather	than	appreciated	by	such	a	large	amount.


Unfortunately,	it	appears	that	some	research	analysts	are	also	having	a	hard	time
grasping	AVID's	financial	reporting	methods.	For	example,	during	the	Company's	Q2
2016	earnings	call,	an	analyst	from	BWS	Financial	posed	the	following	question	to
management:


"Hi,	just	I	guess	the	first	question.	Your	boosting	revenue	a	bit	then	you're	talking
about	lower	cost	exiting	the	year.	But	you	are	not	changing	your	free	cash	flow
guidance.	Why	is	that?"


As	part	of	its	Q2	2016	earnings	release,	AVID	increased	its	FY	2016	revenue	guidance	by
$35-40	million,	from	$500-525	million	to	$535-565	million.	This	increase	in	guidance	was
due	largely	to	the	accelerated	recognition	of	$32.8	million	of	deferred	customer	support
revenue	in	1H	2016.	As	highlighted	above,	the	analyst	from	BWS	seems	to	believe	that
the	increase	in	FY	2016	revenue	guidance	should	have	translated	to	an	increase	in	FCF
guidance.	He	does	not	seem	to	understand	that	the	accelerated	recognition	of	customer
support	revenue	does	not	constitute	an	economic	gain	for	the	business.	Thus,	even	some
analysts	have	been	fooled	by	the	Company's	misleading	reporting	methods.


AVID	Has	Almost	No	Hope	Of	Achieving	Its	FY	2016	Adjusted	FCF	Guidance


As	discussed	previously,	as	part	of	its	Q2	2016	earnings	release,	AVID	raised	its	FY	2016
Non-GAAP	revenue	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	guidance,	as	well	as	reiterated	its	FY	2016
Adjusted	FCF	and	bookings	guidance.	I	have	once	again	provided	a	summary	of	the
Company's	revised	FY	2016	guidance	below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 15/33


Given	that	Non-GAAP	revenue,	Adjusted	EBITDA	and	bookings	are	all	poor	measures	of
financial	performance,	I	feel	it	is	meaningless	to	analyze	whether	AVID	will	achieve	its
targets	for	these	metrics.	Thus,	in	this	section,	I	will	focus	my	analysis	of	FY	2016
guidance	on	what	I	feel	is	the	most	relevant	metric:	Adjusted	FCF.


Despite	reporting	an	Adjusted	FCF	loss	of	$39.6	million	in	1H	2016,	AVID	management
surprisingly	reiterated	its	Adjusted	FCF	guidance	of	$2-12	million	for	the	year.	This	implies
that	management	expects	the	Company	to	generate	a	combined	$42-52	million	of
Adjusted	FCF	in	Q3	and	Q4	2016.	This	represents	a	substantial	turnaround	in
performance	for	the	rest	of	the	year.


As	evidenced	by	the	recent	appreciation	in	share	price	since	Q2	2016	earnings,	investors
appear	to	believe	that	the	Company	will	meet	its	extremely	bullish	second	half	FCF	target.
However,	a	deeper	analysis	of	management's	Adjusted	FCF	projection	reveals	that
AVID	has	almost	no	hope	of	meeting	its	aggressive	target.	As	I	will	demonstrate,
management	is	basing	its	Adjusted	FCF	target	on	assumptions	which	appear	to	be
entirely	unrealistic	and	make	little	logical	sense.


On	slide	19	of	its	Q2	2016	earnings	call	presentation,	AVID	provided	the	following	1H
2016	to	2H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	bridge:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 16/33


As	shown	above,	from	1H	2016	to	2H	2016,	the	Company	is	expecting	$50	million	of	FCF
improvement	from	increased	sales	($20	million	from	seasonality	+	$30	million	from	growth
initiatives).	On	the	expense	side,	AVID	expects	to	realize	$37	million	of	FCF	improvement
from	what	it	labels	"Cash/Cost	Initiatives".	By	hitting	these	targets,	the	Company	expects
to	realize	an	over	$80	million	improvement	in	Adjusted	FCF	in	2H	2016.


In	regard	to	the	projected	$50	million	increase	in	FCF	from	sales,	an	analysis	of	the
Company's	historical	billings	reveals	that	this	target	is	wildly	optimistic.	As	a	refresher,
billings	is	the	most	accurate	indicator	of	current	sales	performance	because	it	reflects	the
amount	of	firm	orders	that	AVID	has	received	from	its	customers.	A	firm	order	means	that
the	customer	has	been	invoiced	and	has	paid	cash	for	the	product	or	will	pay	cash	for	the
product	within	a	short	time	period.	As	a	result,	billings	provides	an	accurate	proxy	for
sales,	as	well	as	the	amount	of	cash	that	is	collected	from	customers	in	a	given	time
period.


In	order	to	achieve	its	incremental	FCF	from	sales	target,	the	Company	will	have	to
generate	$50	million	of	incremental	gross	profit	in	2H	2016	versus	1H	2016.	Provided	in
the	figure	below	is	my	calculation	of	AVID's	gross	profit	in	1H	2016.	Since	billings	is	a
close	proxy	for	sales,	I	have	calculated	AVID's	gross	profit	and	gross	margin	on	a	billings
basis.


As	shown	above,	in	1H	2016,	AVID's	billings-based	gross	margin	was	56.6%.	Assuming
that	gross	margin	remains	at	56.6%	in	2H	2016,	I	have	calculated	the	implied	increase	in
2H	2016	billings	required	to	achieve	$50	million	of	incremental	gross	margin.


Based	on	the	above	analysis,	in	order	to	hit	its	$50	million	target,	AVID	will	have	to
increase	its	billings	by	$88.4	million	from	1H	2016	to	2H	2016.	Provided	below	is
breakdown	of	projected	FY	2016	billings	assuming	an	$88.4	million	increase	in	2H	2016
billings.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 17/33


From	the	above	figure,	it	should	be	clear	to	see	just	how	aggressive	AVID's	$50	million
incremental	FCF	target	is.	In	order	to	achieve	this	target,	the	Company	will	have	to
increase	its	2H	2016	billings	by	almost	45%	relative	to	1H	2016	billings!	To	further
illustrate	just	how	outlandish	management's	2H	2016	target	is,	I	have	provided	a
breakdown	of	AVID's	historical	1H	and	2H	pro	forma	billings.	Note	that	pro	forma	billings
reflects	total	billings	excluding	the	contribution	from	Orad.	I	have	excluded	Orad	in	order	to
provide	a	more	accurate	view	of	seasonality	and	organic	growth.


As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	over	the	past	three	years,	the	maximum	amount	of
billings	that	AVID	has	generated	in	a	half-year	period	was	$255.5	million	in	2H	2014.	As
calculated	previously,	I	estimate	that	the	Company	will	have	to	generate	$285.4	million	of
billings	in	2H	2016	to	meet	its	$50	million	incremental	FCF	target.	This	is	almost	$30
million	higher	than	the	$255.5	million	of	peak	billings	reported	in	2H	2014.


It	is	also	important	to	consider	the	fact	that,	excluding	Orad,	1H	2016	billings	of	$183.9
million	was	$38.9	million,	or	17.4%	lower	than	1H	2014	billings	of	$222.7	million.	Thus,
given	this	deterioration	in	organic	billings	performance	relative	to	1H	2014,	I	find	it	highly
unlikely	that	AVID	will	generate	$30	million	more	billings	in	2H	2016	versus	2H	2014.


Furthermore,	$285.4	million	of	2H	2016	billings	implies	that	59.2%	of	total	FY	2016	billings
will	be	generated	in	the	second	half	of	the	year.	Although	AVID's	business	is	somewhat
seasonal,	the	highest	that	2H	seasonality	has	been	over	the	past	three	years	was	53.4%
in	2H	2014.	Thus,	expecting	2H	2016	seasonality	to	be	so	much	higher	than	its	recent
peak	in	2H	2014	appears	unrealistic.


So,	what	is	a	more	realistic	billings	target	for	the	Company?	I	believe	that	the	increase	in
billings	from	1H	2016	to	2H	2016	billings	will	be	more	in	line	with	the	increases	in	2H

2016	billings	assuming	the	same	seasonality	as	in	2H	2014:


As	shown	above,	based	on	the	more	reasonable	assumption	that	2H	2016	seasonality	will
be	53.4%	(equivalent	to	2H	2014)	rather	than	59.2%,	I	project	that	AVID's	billings	will
increase	by	$29	million,	or	14.7%,	from	1H	2016	to	2H	2016.	This	projected	increase	of
$29	million	is	far	less	than	the	$88.4	million	increase	in	2H	2016	billings	implied	by
management's	$50	million	incremental	FCF	target.	Although	it	is	significantly	lower	than
management's	implied	billings	target,	I	believe	that	my	estimate	of	billings	is	generous
given	that	53.4%	represents	a	recent	peak	in	seasonality.	Assuming	2H	2016	gross
margin	is	the	same	as	in	1H	2016,	my	estimate	for	incremental	FCF	from	sales	in	2H	2016
is	as	follows:


As	calculated	above,	in	2H	2016,	I	estimate	that	billings	increases	will	result	in	an
incremental	$16.4	million	of	Adjusted	FCF	versus	1H	2016.	This	is	$33.6	million
lower	than	management's	guidance	of	$50	million	in	incremental	FCF	from	sales	in
2H	2016.	Thus,	based	on	billings	alone,	it	appears	that	AVID	will	likely	miss	its	FY	2016
Adjusted	FCF	target	by	at	least	$30	million.


Unfortunately	for	AVID	investors,	it	gets	worse.	In	addition	to	projecting	an	unrealistic
increase	in	billings,	management's	projection	that	it	will	achieve	$37	million	of	"cash/cost
initiatives"	savings	from	1H	2016	to	2H	2016	simply	makes	no	sense.	First,	consider	the
following	breakdown	of	management's	guidance	for	FY	2016	Non-GAAP	operating
expenses:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 19/33


Management	is	guiding	for	total	Non-GAAP	operating	expenses	of	$247-260	million.	After
subtracting	$132.2	million	of	1H	2016	Non-GAAP	operating	expenses,	this	implies	that	2H
2016	Non-GAAP	operating	expenses	is	expected	to	be	$114.8-127.8	million.	Thus,	at	the
midpoint	of	this	range,	2H	2016	Non-GAAP	operating	expenses	are	expected	to	be	just
$10.8	million	lower	than	in	1H	2016.


The	projected	operating	expense	savings	of	$10.8	million	is	substantially	lower	than	the
$37	million	of	total	savings	AVID	has	projected	in	its	Adjusted	FCF	guidance.	In	order	to
achieve	its	target,	the	Company	will	somehow	have	to	come	up	with	an	additional	$26.2
million	of	cash/cost	savings.	The	problem	is	that	it	is	unclear	just	where	these	additional
savings	could	come	from.	In	regard	to	additional	cost	savings,	the	only	other	bucket	that
the	Company	could	potentially	cut	some	costs	is	COGs.	However,	COGs	is	typically
harder	to	reduce	due	to	the	variable	nature	of	these	costs.


The	remaining	area	where	AVID	could	potentially	realize	cash	savings	is	in	reductions	to
working	capital.	However,	given	the	large	increase	in	billings	that	management	has
projected	in	2H	2016,	I	am	not	sure	why	they	would	expect	net	working	capital	to
decrease	by	over	$26	million.	Typically,	when	sales	increase,	net	working	capital
increases,	which	results	in	a	use	of	cash.	Thus,	I	do	not	believe	AVID	will	be	able	realize
cash	savings	from	reductions	in	working	capital.	If	anything,	I	would	expect	net	working
capital	to	increase	and	be	a	use	of	cash	in	2H	2016.


Based	on	this	analysis,	it	appears	that	management's	target	of	$37	million	in
"cash/cost	initiatives"	savings	is	not	grounded	in	reality.	Aside	from	Non-GAAP
operating	expenses,	there	does	not	appear	to	be	any	other	areas	where	the	Company
could	realize	substantial	savings.	Thus,	it	appears	that	AVID	will	not	come	close	to
achieving	its	$37	million	savings	target.	Instead,	the	Company	will	likely	only	achieve
around	$10.8	million	of	cost/cash	savings	in	2H	2016	(equivalent	to	the	projected
decline	in	Non-GAAP	operating	expenses).


Putting	it	all	together,	I	believe	AVID's	Adjusted	FCF	from	1H	2016	to	2H	2016	will
increase	by	a	total	of	$27.2	million	($16.4	million	from	billings	increases	+	$10.8	million	of
cost	savings).	Thus,	I	project	that	2H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	will	be	a	loss	of	$12.4	million
(-$39.6	million	of	1H	2016	FCF	+	$27.2	million).	By	adding	an	Adjusted	FCF	loss	of	$12.4
million	in	2H	2016	to	a	loss	of	$39.6	million	in	1H	2016,	I	project	that	AVID's	FY	2016
Adjusted	FCF	will	be	a	loss	of	$52.0	million.	This	is	$54-64	million	lower	than
management's	projection	of	$2-12	million	of	Adjusted	FCF	in	FY	2016.

I	am	not	sure	why	AVID	provided	such	an	unrealistic	Adjusted	FCF	target	to	investors.
Either	management	is	intentionally	misleading	investors	to	prop	up	its	stock	price,	or	they
have	a	very	poor	grasp	on	the	financials	of	their	own	business.	Both	scenarios	are	not
very	appealing	for	shareholders.


Sudden	Departure	Of	CFO	And	Heavy	Insider	Selling	Are	Bearish	Indications


The	recent	actions	of	current	and	former	members	of	senior	management	further	indicate
that	AVID	is	likely	to	miss	its	bullish	projections	for	the	second	half	of	this	year.	In	an	April
13,	2016	press	release,	CFO	John	Frederick	announced	his	resignation	from	AVID.	In	this
same	press	release,	the	Company	also	announced	that	its	VP	of	Human	Resources,	Ilan
Sidi,	would	be	taking	over	as	interim	CFO.


By	itself,	the	resignation	of	Mr.	Frederick	as	CFO	may	not	be	that	concerning.	The
Company	stated	that	his	departure	was	due	to	personal	reasons,	and	this	could	be	true.
However,	based	on	his	recent	actions,	I	believe	that	Mr.	Frederick	left	AVID	due	to	his
lack	of	confidence	in	the	Company's	future.


For	example,	during	his	final	earnings	call	with	AVID	(Q1	2016),	Mr.	Frederick	made
the	curious	decision	to	not	provide	guidance	after	walking	through	the	quarterly
results.	Instead,	after	discussing	the	Q1	results	in	more	detail,	Mr.	Frederick	handed	the
call	over	to	Mr.	Sidi,	the	interim	CFO.	Mr.	Sidi	then	proceeded	to	walk	through	the
Company's	FY	2016	guidance.	Provide	below	is	the	transcript	of	this	curious	sequence	of
events:


Mr.	Frederick:	"...	If	you	remove	the	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	you'll	see	revenue
backlog	was	$480	million	up	4%	year-over-year	which	provides	significantly
improved	revenue	visibility	and	reflects	the	continued	shift	to	a	more	recurring
revenue	model...	With	that,	I'll	now	turn	the	call	over	to	Ilan	to	review	the
guidance	for	the	remainder	of	the	year.	Ilan?"


Ilan	Sidi:	"Thank	you,	John.	Now	I'll	review	the	guidance	for	the	second	quarter	and
the	full	year	2016."


I	believe	that	Mr.	Frederick	wanted	to	distance	himself	from	management's
unrealistic	projections.	Thus,	instead	of	providing	guidance	on	the	call,	he	handed	off
this	responsibility	to	Mr.	Sidi.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 21/33


Perhaps	more	concerning	and	more	relevant	is	the	fact	that	Mr.	Frederick	has	liquidated
most	of	his	holdings	in	AVID	just	a	few	short	months	after	leaving	the	Company.	In
a	Form	4	filing	on	August	17,	2016,	it	was	disclosed	that	Mr.	Frederick	had	disposed	of
457,506	shares	of	AVID	stock.	Following	this	transaction,	Mr.	Frederick	now	owns	just
87,552	shares	in	the	Company.


The	fact	that	Mr.	Frederick	recently	sold	over	80%	of	his	shares	just	a	few	short	months
after	leaving	the	Company	is	a	concerning	development	for	shareholders.	As	former	CFO,
Mr.	Frederick	likely	has	a	good	idea	of	whether	or	not	AVID	can	meet	its	aggressive
second-half	projections.	Thus,	his	decision	to	sell	most	of	his	holdings	supports	my	belief
that	the	Company	is	likely	to	disappoint	investors	come	earnings	season.


In	addition	to	Mr.	Frederick,	current	senior	management	and	board	members	have
also	sold	a	large	amount	of	AVID	shares	over	recent	months.	Provided	below	is	a
summary	of	insider	transactions	in	AVID	stock	over	the	past	three	months:


As	shown	above,	even	if	Mr.	Frederick's	recent	457.5K	share	sale	is	excluded,	insiders	at
the	Company	have	sold	over	200K	shares	over	the	past	three	months.	Also,	during	that
same	time	frame,	there	have	been	no	purchases	of	AVID	shares	by	insiders.	So	why	are
key	decision	makers	currently	bailing	out	of	AVID	stock?	I	believe	the	answer	to	this
question	is	that,	like	Mr.	Frederick,	current	management	recognizes	that	the	Company	is
unlikely	to	meet	its	second-half	guidance.


AVID's	Controversial	Customer	Support	Policy	Change


As	I	touched	upon	earlier,	last	year,	the	Company	made	a	significant	change	to	its
customer	support	policy.	In	Q3	2015,	AVID	made	the	decision	to	stop	providing	free	bug
fixes.	As	a	result,	customers	who	wish	to	receive	ongoing	bug	fixes	must	now	pay	for	an
active	support	plan.	The	Company's	sudden	decision	to	no	longer	provide	free	bug	fixes
was	a	highly	controversial	one	which	upset	a	lot	of	its	customers.	To	understand	why
customers	were	so	upset,	a	little	background	on	AVID's	support	policy	history	must	be
provided.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 22/33


In	October	2014,	AVID	completely	revamped	its	licensing	plan.	As	part	of	its	revamped
licensing	plan,	the	Company	introduced	support	plans.	A	customer	who	purchased	a
software	license	was	entitled	to	one	year	of	feature	updates	and	bug	fixes.	However,	after
a	year,	customers	had	to	purchase	a	support	plan	in	order	to	continue	receiving	updated
features.	That	being	said,	even	without	a	support	plan,	AVID	told	its	customers	that	they
would	still	receive	bug	fixes	free	of	charge.	Providing	free	bug	fixes	seemed	like	the
proper	thing	to	do	given	that	the	Company	had	always	provided	them	without	charge.


The	fact	that	bug	fixes	would	be	provided	free	of	charge	was	explicitly	confirmed	by	AVID
representatives.	For	example,	consider	the	following	online	exchange	between	an	AVID
marketing	director	and	a	Pro	Tools	customer	in	October	2014:


Dot	releases	are	basically	bug	fix	updates	provided	by	AVID.	Thus,	from	the	above
exchange,	it	is	apparent	that	the	Company	had	clearly	communicated	that	bug	fixes	would
continue	to	be	free.


For	some	reason,	one	year	later	in	October	2015,	Avid	decided	to	go	back	on	its	word.
Without	a	press	release	or	explanation	to	its	customers,	the	Company	quietly	decided
that	bug	fixes	would	no	longer	be	free	of	charge.	Thus,	only	customers	with	an	active
support	plan	could	receive	ongoing	bug	fixes.	Understandably,	customers	were	outraged
over	the	sudden	and	surreptitious	change	in	policy.	The	anger	and	concerns	of	users	over
this	policy	change	was	discussed	in	an	October	2015	article.	The	following	is	an	excerpt
from	this	article:

"...	in	making	this	change	it	has	meant	that	in	order	to	get	bug	fixes	for	11	via	11.3.2
(the	last	version	of	Pro	Tools	11)	you	will	have	to	pay.	As	you	can	imagine	this	has
made	some	people	unhappy.	There	are	a	couple	of	threads	on	the	Avid	DUC	with
people	expressing	differing	views	over	the	u-turn	by	Avid."


Also,	many	customers	went	online	to	express	their	anger	over	the	policy	change.	The
following	quotes	are	from	an	April	2016	discussion	on	AVID's	official	Pro	Tools	message
board:


"...	it's	a	disgrace	that	bug	fixes	for	software	you	already	paid	for	are	not	included!"


"No	Support	subscription	-	No	bug	fix	for	you...	Means	I	will	hopefully	make
retirement	on	12.4	-	which	I	rolled	back	to	after	endless	freezes	and	crashes	on
12.5."


"This	is	100%	contradictory	to	the	statement	made	by	Tony	Cariddi	in	response
to	our	questions	when	the	new	licensing	regime	was	first	announced	in	October
2014,	in	which	he	confirmed	that	bug	fix	releases	would	continue	to	be	free,
regardless	of	support	plan	status."


In	my	opinion,	the	fact	that	the	Company	is	treating	its	customers	in	such	a	poor	manner	is
highly	alarming.	For	starters,	I	am	not	sure	if	this	change	to	AVID's	support	agreement
is	even	legal.	From	what	I	understand,	bait	and	switch	sales	tactics	are	specifically
outlawed	by	the	FTC.	It	will	be	interesting	to	see	if	anything	comes	from	this	fiasco	from
a	legal	perspective.


Putting	the	legal	concerns	aside,	this	is	simply	not	the	right	way	to	build	a	long-term
customer	base.	Although	no	longer	providing	bug	fixes	may	push	some	customers	to
purchase	support	plans,	this	gain	in	sales	will	likely	be	more	than	offset	by	jaded
customers	who	may	decide	to	switch	to	a	competitor's	product.	Over	the	past	few	years,
the	Company	has	been	steadily	losing	market	share	to	competitors	like	Adobe	and	Apple.
Given	this	fact,	along	with	its	challenged	financial	situation,	AVID	can	ill	afford	to	further
alienate	its	customer	base.


AVID	May	Have	Violated	SEC	Regulations	By	Using	Cookie	Jar	Accounting	Tactics


As	I	discussed	earlier,	AVID's	decision	to	no	longer	provide	free	bug	fixes	allowed	the
Company	to	accelerate	the	recognition	of	deferred	customer	support	revenue	for	some	of
its	products.	The	fact	AVID	is	treating	its	customers	in	such	a	poor,	and	perhaps	even

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 24/33


illegal,	manner	in	order	to	inflate	its	financial	performance	is	highly	concerning.	Perhaps
even	more	concerning	is	the	fact	that	the	Company	appears	to	be	using	cookie	jar
accounting	tactics	when	recognizing	its	accelerated	customer	support	revenue.


Cookie	jar	accounting	as	it	relates	to	deferred	revenue	occurs	when	a	company
recognizes	a	lower	amount	of	deferred	revenue	than	it	should	in	a	given	period.	By	doing
so,	a	company	can	save	deferred	revenue	for	future	periods.	This	essentially	creates	a
deferred	revenue	cookie	jar	that	the	company	can	tap	into	whenever	it	needs	to	prop	up
its	financial	results.


Employing	cookie	jar	accounting	tactics	is	against	SEC	regulations.	For	example,	in	1999,
the	SEC	investigated	Microsoft	(NASDAQ:MSFT)	for	alleged	cookie	jar	accounting	tactics
related	to	its	deferred	software	revenue.	The	following	quote	is	from	a	1999	article	which
described	the	SEC	investigation	in	more	detail:


"For	Windows,	35%	of	the	amount	of	retail	sales	is	deferred	and	recognized	as
revenue	over	the	subsequent	24	months...	The	SEC	probe	was	prompted	by	the
concern	that	Microsoft	was	deferring	too	much	revenue.	When	a	company	is	doing
very	well...	it	can	be	tempted	to	delay	reporting	all	of	its	revenue	in	order	to	establish
a	so-called	cookie	jar	reserve	of	revenue	that	can	be	recognized	in	the	event	that
sales	growth	slows..."


The	staggered	timing	of	AVID's	accelerated	customer	support	revenue	recognition
suggests	that	it	may	be	using	cookie	jar	accounting	tactics	similar	to	those	previously	used
by	Microsoft.	For	example,	in	2H	2015,	AVID	accelerated	the	recognition	of	deferred
customer	support	revenue	for	its	Media	Composer	8.0	product.	However,	the	Company
waited	until	1Q	2016	before	it	accelerated	the	recognition	of	deferred	customer	support
revenue	for	its	Pro	Tools	12	product.


By	recognizing	customer	support	revenue	for	Media	Composer	8.0	and	Pro	Tools	12
in	different	periods,	it	appears	that	AVID	may	have	violated	SEC	regulations	by
using	cookie	jar	accounting	tactics.	As	I	discussed	in	the	previous	section,	in	October
2015	AVID	communicated	to	its	Pro	Tools	users	that	it	would	no	longer	provide	bug	fixes
for	free.	Yet,	despite	communicating	this	new	policy	in	late	2015,	AVID	delayed	the
accelerated	recognition	of	its	Pro	Tools	12	customer	support	revenue	until	Q1	2016.	Thus,
it	appears	that	the	Company	improperly	saved	the	accelerated	Pro	Tools	12	revenue	in
order	to	prop	up	its	1H	FY	2016	results.	Because	the	Pro	Tools	support	change	occurred
in	October	2015,	the	accelerated	recognition	of	revenue	for	this	product	should	have	likely
occurred	in	Q3	2015.

The	fact	that	AVID	may	have	violated	SEC	regulations	through	cookie	jar	accounting
tactics	is	another	point	of	great	concern	for	investors.	At	worst,	this	could	lead	to	an	SEC
investigation	into	the	accounting	practices	of	the	Company.	Even	if	an	SEC	investigation
does	not	occur,	the	concerns	over	AVID's	apparent	cookie	jar	accounting	tactics	once
again	raises	concerns	over	the	integrity	and	competence	of	management.


Change	In	Customer	Support	Policy	Likely	Done	To	Maintain	Covenant	Compliance


So	why	would	AVID	resort	to	such	seemingly	desperate,	and	perhaps	even	unlawful,
tactics?	It	appears	that	the	Company	made	its	controversial	support	policy	change	in	Q3
2015	for	the	primary	purpose	of	maintaining	covenant	compliance.


In	order	to	maintain	covenant	compliance,	AVID	must	keep	its	leverage	ratio	below	the
ratios	specified	in	its	credit	agreement.	Provided	below	is	my	calculation	of	AVID's	Q2
2015	and	Q3	2015	leverage	ratio	based	on	its	reported	total	debt	and	LTM	Adjusted
EBITDA:


In	Q2	2015	and	Q3	2015,	the	Company	was	operating	under	the	terms	of	its	previous
credit	agreement	(dated	June	22,	2015).	The	terms	of	AVID's	previous	credit	agreement
required	it	to	maintain	a	leverage	ratio	of	below	2.5x.	As	shown	above,	based	on	its
reported	total	debt	and	LTM	Adjusted	EBITDA,	the	Company	was	in	compliance	with	its
leverage	ratio	covenant	in	both	Q2	2015	and	Q3	2015.


However,	as	noted	previously,	AVID's	Q3	2015	results	were	significantly	boosted	by	the
customer	support	policy	change	it	made	in	that	period.	In	total,	the	accelerated	recognition
of	deferred	customer	support	revenue	(recognized	at	a	100%	margin)	boosted	Q3	2015
Adjusted	EBITDA	by	$15.5	million.	With	this	in	mind,	I	have	re-calculated	the	Company's
Q2	2015	and	Q3	2015	leverage	ratios	pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of	accelerated	customer
support	revenue:

As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of	$15.5	million	of
accelerated	customer	support	revenue,	AVID	would	have	violated	its	2.5x	leverage
covenant	ratio	in	Q3	2015.	Thus,	based	on	this	fact,	it	appears	likely	that	the	Company
changed	its	support	policy	in	Q3	2015	for	the	purpose	of	maintaining	compliance
with	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.


In	addition	to	helping	AVID	maintain	compliance	under	its	old	credit	agreement,
accelerated	customer	support	revenue	has	also	allowed	the	Company	to	maintain
compliance	under	its	new	credit	agreement.	Provided	below	is	my	calculation	of	AVID's
Q1	2016	leverage	ratio	pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of	accelerated	customer	support
revenue:


Based	on	the	terms	of	AVID's	current	credit	agreement	(dated	February	26,	2016),	it	was
required	to	maintain	a	leverage	ratio	of	below	4.35x	for	all	quarters	up	to	and	including	Q2
2016.	As	calculated	above,	without	the	benefit	of	accelerated	customer	support	revenue,
the	Company	would	have	violated	this	revised	leverage	ratio	in	Q1	2016.


The	fact	that	AVID	needs	to	rely	on	questionable	business	decisions	and	accounting
gimmicks	in	order	to	maintain	covenant	compliance	should	be	quite	alarming	for
shareholders.	It	appears	that	the	Company's	financial	situation	is	so	desperate	that	it
is	willing	to	do	almost	anything	to	prop	up	its	results.	By	going	back	on	its	word	in
regard	to	free	bug	fixes,	AVID	has	angered	a	significant	portion	of	its	customer	base.	A
good	portion	of	these	angry	customers	may	opt	to	switch	to	a	competitor's	product.	Thus,

although	the	policy	change	has	provided	it	some	short-term	benefit	from	a	covenant
perspective,	the	Company	has	likely	done	a	great	deal	of	long-term	damage	to	its
business.


AVID	Will	Soon	Violate	Its	Leverage	Ratio	Covenant


Unfortunately	for	AVID,	the	temporary	boost	in	financial	performance	provided	by	its
cookie	jar	of	deferred	customer	support	revenue	will	be	short-lived.	The	Company
has	already	accelerated	the	recognition	of	customer	support	revenue	for	Media	Composer
and	Pro	Tools,	as	AVID's	two	flagship	products,	Media	Composer	and	Pro	Tools,	account
for	the	vast	majority	of	its	customer	support	revenue.	The	other	products	that	the
Company	offers	account	for	a	much	smaller	percentage	of	customer	support	sales.	Given
this	fact,	there	appears	to	be	only	a	small	amount	of	remaining	deferred	customer
support	revenue	that	can	be	accelerated	in	future.


To	make	matters	worse,	the	Company's	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	will	also	run	out
soon.	As	of	the	end	of	Q2	2016,	the	AVID	had	just	$8.7	million	of	pre-2011	deferred
revenue	remaining	on	its	balance	sheet.	In	1H	2016,	the	amortization	of	pre-2011
deferred	revenue	contributed	$17.0	million	to	its	Non-GAAP	revenue	and	Adjusted
EBITDA.	Thus,	at	some	point	in	the	near	future,	the	Company	will	also	lose	the	boost	to	its
financials	provided	by	its	pre-2011	deferred	revenue.


The	fact	that	AVID	will	soon	lose	the	benefit	of	both	its	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and
accelerated	customer	support	revenue	is	bad	news	for	shareholders.	As	a	result	of	the
loss	of	these	two	revenue	sources,	the	Company	will	likely	violate	its	leverage	ratio
covenant	at	some	point	within	the	next	12	months.	To	support	this	assertion,	I	have
once	again	provided	below	the	Company's	1H	2016	pro	forma	and	billings-based
financials:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 28/33


Pro	forma	for	the	exclusion	of	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	customer
support	revenue,	the	Company's	1H	2016	Adjusted	EBITDA	was	$18.0	million,	or	$36.0
million	on	a	run	rate	basis.	On	a	billings	basis,	which	is	also	not	affected	by	boosts	in
deferred	revenue,	the	Company's	1H	2016	Adjusted	EBITDA	was	a	loss	of	$13.3	million,
or	a	loss	of	$26.6	million	on	a	run	rate	basis.


As	of	the	end	of	Q2	2016,	the	AVID	had	a	total	debt	balance	of	$192.8	million.	Dividing
$192.8	million	of	total	debt	by	$36.0	million	of	run	rate	PF	Adjusted	EBITDA	results	in	a
leverage	ratio	of	5.3x.	Thus,	on	a	pro	forma	basis,	AVID	would	have	already	been	in
violation	of	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.	Similarly,	on	a	billings	basis,	the	Company	would
have	also	been	in	violation	of	its	leverage	ratio	covenant	given	that	billings-based
Adjusted	EBITDA	was	a	loss	in	1H	2016.


From	this	analysis,	it	is	clear	that	AVID	would	have	violated	its	leverage	ratio	covenant
without	the	benefit	of	pre-2011	deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	customer	support
revenue.	Therefore,	given	that	these	two	sources	of	revenue	have	almost	been
exhausted,	the	Company	will	likely	violate	its	leverage	ratio	covenant	over	the	next	12
months	as	its	Adjusted	EBITDA	declines	to	a	more	normalized	level.


In	order	to	avoid	a	covenant	violation,	AVID	will	need	to	have	a	dramatic	turnaround	in
financial	performance	in	a	short	period	of	time.	Given	the	current	trends	in	its	business,
this	does	not	appear	likely.	The	more	likely	scenario	is	that	the	Company	will	have	to
raise	a	significant	amount	of	cash	and	deleverage	via	a	secondary	equity	offering.
The	large	amount	of	dilution	resulting	from	such	an	offering	will	likely	result	in	a	sharp
correction	in	AVID	stock	price.


AVID	Continues	To	Lose	Ground	To	Competitors,	And	Its	Subscription	Growth	Has
Stalled


The	sharp	decline	in	AVID's	sales	performance	is	a	reflection	of	industry	trends	which
have	shifted	against	the	Company	over	the	past	few	years.	It	is	also	a	reflection	of	the
enormous	competitive	pressures	the	Company	is	facing	from	both	large	players	like	Apple
and	Adobe,	as	well	as	smaller	startups.


A	recent	April	2014	Boston	Globe	article	provided	a	good	summary	of	the	challenging
situation	AVID	currently	finds	itself	in:

"Avid	was	a	market	leader,	and	could	basically	dictate	prices...	But	players	like	Apple
and	Adobe	Systems	proved	much	better	at	marketing	to	consumers	and	small
businesses..."


"In	the	aftermath,	Avid	has	been	"forced	up	into	the	top	of	the	pyramid,"	in
Overington's	words,	selling	to	a	smallish	community	of	professionals	who	make
movies	or	music	for	a	living	-	or	aspire	to.	It	no	longer	has	the	power	to	set	prices,
which	are	driven	by	players	like	Apple	and	Adobe."


In	the	video	and	audio	markets,	AVID	maintains	a	leading	market	share	amongst	industry
professionals.	Both	Pro	Tools	and	Media	Composer	have	continued	to	be	the	digital	audio
workstation	("DAW")	and	video	editing	software	of	choice	for	professionals	and	aspiring
professionals.	However,	despite	previous	attempts,	the	Company	has	yet	to	gain	a
significant	foothold	in	the	consumer	and	small	business	market.


Over	the	past	few	years,	the	Company's	strength	in	the	professional	market	has	weighed
heavily	on	its	results.	The	problem	with	the	professional	market	is	that	it	is	a	mature
segment	with	little	to	no	growth.	In	fact,	on	the	audio	side,	the	professional	market
has	been	in	a	persistent	decline.	A	combination	of	declining	album	sales	and	cheaper,
less	space-intensive	production	equipment	has	led	to	a	significant	reduction	in	the	number
of	professional	recording	studios.	This	has	led	to	a	reduction	in	demand	for	AVID's	Pro
Tools	DAW	software.	The	following	excerpts	are	from	a	June	2014	Guardian	article	which
describes	the	challenges	facing	professional	recording	studios	in	more	detail:


"...	studios	have	to	be	run	extremely	efficiently	now.	We	tend	to	keep	them
constantly	busy	-	high	occupancy	rates	versus	low	income.	A	top-end	studio
should	be	charging	£1,000	or	£1,200	a	day.	We're	getting	£450.	Because	that's
where	the	market	is."


"Unless	the	day	rates	do	start	going	up,	you	will	see	more	fall	by	the	wayside..."


In	addition	to	headwinds	in	the	professional	segment,	AVID's	struggles	can	also	be
attributed	to	intense	competitive	pressures	from	large	rivals	like	Apple	and	Adobe	and
smaller	players	in	the	DAW	space	like	FL	Studio	and	Ableton.	These	competitors	all
offer	software	products	of	comparable	quality	to	AVID's	products,	yet	at	a	much
lower	price	point.	For	example,	a	license	for	Apple's	Final	Cut	Pro	X	video	editing
software	costs	$299.99,	compared	to	a	whopping	$1,299	for	Media	Composer.	As	another
example,	an	FL	Studio	DAW	license	costs	$199,	which	is	less	than	half	of	the	$599	that
AVID	charges	for	a	Pro	Tools	license.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 30/33


Not	surprisingly,	due	to	these	much	lower	price	points,	consumers	have	mostly	opted	to
purchase	DAW	and	video	editing	software	from	AVID's	competitors.	There	is	simply	no
incentive	for	a	consumer	to	pay	a	huge	premium	for	AVID's	products	when	the	competing
products	are	of	comparable	quality.	Thus,	unless	AVID	significantly	reduces	its	pricing
or	releases	a	separate	consumer-focused	product,	it	appears	that	the	Company	will
continue	to	be	a	bit	player	in	the	consumer	space.


Worse	yet	for	AVID	is	the	fact	that	Adobe	and	Apple	appear	to	be	gaining	share	in	the
professional	video	editing	market.	The	following	quote	is	from	a	recent	April	2016
PremiumBeat	article	discussing	this	trend:


"Avid	made	a	fatal	error	that	caused	a	surge	in	the	number	of	editors	using
Premiere	Pro	CC	and	Final	Cut	Pro	X,	even	in	Avid's	traditional	stronghold	of
Hollywood.	This	pattern	can	be	seen	in	examples	like	Gone	Girl,	which	was	cut	in
Premiere	Pro,	and	Focus,	which	was	cut	in	Final	Cut	Pro	X.	And	now	even	more
editors	are	making	the	jump	away	from	Avid."


Thus,	given	these	persistent	industry	headwinds	and	competitive	pressures	facing	the
Company,	a	turnaround	in	its	performance	does	not	appear	likely.


Some	investors	may	be	encouraged	by	AVID's	recent	efforts	to	build	a	recurring	revenue
base	through	its	new	subscription-based	sales	model.	Over	the	past	few	quarters,	the
Company	has	pointed	to	the	seemingly	strong	growth	of	its	subscription	business	as	one
of	the	bright	spots	of	its	recent	financial	performance.	For	example,	in	its	Q2	2016
earnings	release,	AVID	proudly	disclosed	the	following	to	its	investors:


"More	than	40,000	paying	individual,	cloud-enabled	subscribers,	a	substantial
majority	of	whom	are	new	users,	at	the	end	of	Q2	2016,	an	increase	of	62%	since
the	beginning	of	the	year	and	3.9x	from	Q2	2015"


"Bookings	attributable	to	recurring	revenue	represented	approximately	32%	of	total
Q2	2016	bookings,	up	from	26%	in	Q2	2015"


On	the	surface,	these	figures	seem	to	indicate	that	the	Company's	subscription-based
sales	are	growing	rapidly.	However,	in	reality,	recent	growth	in	subscription-based
sales	has	grinded	to	a	halt.	To	illustrate	this	point,	provided	below	is	a	comparison	of
AVID's	1H	2016	and	1H	2015	recurring	revenue	bookings	as	reported	in	its	Q2	2016
datasheet:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 31/33


The	Company	defines	recurring	revenue	bookings	as	the	amount	of	bookings	from	both
subscriptions	and	support	plans	in	a	given	period.	In	1H	2016,	recurring	revenue	bookings
grew	just	1.6%	in	comparison	to	1H	2015.	Thus,	although	subscriptions	have	grown
62%	since	the	beginning	of	the	year,	the	growth	in	recurring	revenue	bookings	has
not	followed.	If	revenue	per	subscriber	had	remained	flat,	such	a	large	increase	in
subscribers	should	have	translated	to	a	significant	increase	in	recurring	revenue	bookings.
The	fact	that	recurring	revenue	bookings	growth	is	essentially	flat	this	year	indicates	that
revenue	per	subscriber	has	decreased	significantly.


From	this	analysis	it	is	clear	to	see	that	AVID's	portrayal	of	the	growth	in	its
subscribers	is	misleading.	Although	the	number	of	subscribers	has	grown	considerably
this	year,	these	subscribers	are	of	lower	quality,	as	indicated	by	the	significant	decline	in
revenue	per	subscriber.	Thus,	once	again,	it	appears	that	management	has	misled
investors	regarding	the	true	nature	of	the	Company's	financial	performance.


Valuation


In	my	opinion,	AVID	is	significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price	of	$7.88.	Given
its	looming	liquidity	and	covenant	issues,	rapidly	deteriorating	financials	and	poor	quality
of	management,	I	believe	AVID	shares	are	poised	to	fall	by	a	significant	amount.	The
Company's	52-week	low	occurred	a	few	months	ago,	on	May	19th,	at	a	share	price	of
$5.26.	Given	the	continued	deterioration	in	its	business	since	then,	I	believe	AVID	shares
should,	at	the	very	least,	retrace	back	to	their	52-week	low	of	around	$5.	I	would
expect	this	to	occur	within	the	next	three	to	six	months	as	the	Company	is	forced	revise	its
unrealistic	guidance	downward.	Thus,	my	short-term	price	target	for	AVID	shares	is	$5,
which	is	almost	37%	lower	than	the	current	share	price.


Within	the	next	12	months,	I	believe	AVID	will	soon	run	into	significant	liquidity	and
covenant	issues.	In	regards	to	liquidity,	the	Company	currently	has	$50	million	of	cash	on
its	balance	sheet.	Thus,	given	its	current	annual	cash	burn	of	~$50	million,	AVID	will	likely
need	a	capital	infusion	at	some	point	over	the	next	year.	In	addition	to	this,	as	its	pre-2011

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4005800-avid-technology-strong-sell-due-accounting-concerns-legal-concerns-deteriorating-performance 32/33


deferred	revenue	and	accelerated	support	revenue	wind	down,	the	Company	will	likely
violate	its	leverage	covenant	ratio	at	some	point	over	the	next	few	quarters.	In	order	to
cure	this	default,	AVID's	only	option	will	be	to	tap	the	equity	markets	for	additional	capital.


In	total,	I	estimate	that	AVID	will	have	to	raise	anywhere	between	$100	million	and	$200
million	to	cure	its	covenant	violation	and	add	$50	million	of	incremental	cash	to	its	balance
sheet.	AVID's	current	market	capitalization	is	$314	million.	Thus,	a	$100-200	million
secondary	offering	would	dilute	current	shareholders	by	32-64%.	Assuming	50%	dilution
from	a	future	secondary	offering,	my	long-term	price	target	for	AVID	shares	is	$2.50
(50%	dilution	*	short-term	price	target	of	$5).


My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	note	that	I	sent	an	email	to	AVID's	Investor	Relations	teams.	I	asked	them
to	address	the	key	issues	brought	up	in	this	article.	I	will	provide	an	update	in	the
comments	section	if	I	receive	any	relevant	new	information	from	the	Company.


Conclusion


Given	all	of	the	red	flags	which	I	have	highlighted	in	this	article,	I	believe	AVID	is
considerably	overvalued	at	the	current	stock	price	of	$7.88.	Through	its	misleading
reporting	methods,	the	Company	has	been	able	to	hide	its	poor	financial	results	and
looming	covenant	issues	from	investors.	However,	creative	financial	reporting	can	mask
the	deterioration	in	its	business	for	only	so	long.	As	I	have	illustrated,	AVID	will	likely	miss
its	2H	2016	Adjusted	FCF	guidance	by	over	$50	million.	Furthermore,	over	the	next	12
months,	the	Company	will	likely	need	to	complete	a	highly	dilutive	secondary	offering	in
order	to	remain	solvent	and	in	compliance	with	its	loan	covenants.	Finally,	given	the
questionable	practices	of	management	and	tough	industry	environment,	it	is	likely	that	the
Company's	performance	will	continue	to	deteriorate.	Thus,	I	would	recommend	shorting
AVID	or	selling	AVID	shares	if	you	are	an	existing	shareholder.


Disclosure:	I	am/we	are	short	AVID.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving
compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is

This	one	is	fairly	amazing	to	me	even	by	microcap	standards.	Management	took	a	pretty	decent	asset	with	a	leading
platform	in	its	markets,	doused	it	in	gasoline,	and	lit	it	on	fire.	Then	they	punished	everyone	with	that	stupid	convert	for
a	deal	that	made	no	sense.	Then	they	missed	everything	several	times	in	a	row	and	sound	like	bumbling	idiots	on	the
call.	After	that,	they	let	the	three-headed	hound	from	hell	in	through	the	front	door.	We	know	Dolby	has	repeatedly
approached	this	company	as	a	suitor,	and	instead	of	cleaning	it	up	and	selling	it,	they	just	screwed	everything	up	and
in	the	worst	possible	way.	It's	almost	like	they	want	to	bankrupt	the	company	or	something.	These	guys	are	clowns
and	I	hope	this	stock	goes	to	zero.
