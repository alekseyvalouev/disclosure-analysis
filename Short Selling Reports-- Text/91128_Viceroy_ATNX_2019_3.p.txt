Athenex – No Integrity 
Athenex management’s proliferation for fraud pr ecedes them.  


October 24, 2019 – Viceroy expose more managerial ties to established frauds, and 


address Athenex’s response to our previous work, which addresses absolutely nothing. 


Management’s response underestimates how many improprieties are recorded in the 


public domain – we have yet to scratch the tip of the iceberg. 


▪ The company’s response to Viceroy’s research is a further slap in the face to 


investors: the company has failed to address a single issue highlighted in any of 


our reports. 


- Athenex’s two-paragraph rebuttal to Viceroy’s reports indicates management refuse 


to address any improprieties we have uncovered…to date. We believe Athenex will 


have a tough time explaining to shareholders why their flagship drug is 


commercially unviable, justifying abusive related party transactions, and 


explaining why facility pictures are blatantly photoshopped. 
▪ Athenex’s rebuttal state that management “take pride” in its integrity. This is hilarious 


given management’s track record of overseeing blatant frauds.  


▪ In case Sino Forest and Suntech weren’t enough, Viceroy now reveals direct ties between 


Athenex directors and more established frauds, responsible for evaporating billions of 


dollars of shareholder capital: GCL Poly/Silicon, China Lumena. 


▪ Several individuals involved with Zhang’s previous shady ventures are now 


embedded in the Athenex organization including the Audit committee.  
- Viceroy reveal Athenex Audit Committee member, John Koh, was also a director of Mandra, alongside Songyi 


Zhang, with direct fiduciary obligation to oversee Sino Forest. 


▪ Zhang was previously a director of China Lumena, which was found to have significantly fabricated its 


revenues. In addition to this, a subsidiary that had fabricated ~90% of its revenues was sold to China 


Lumena by Zhang through several of his investment vehicles. 


▪ Zhang was also previously at GCL Silicon where he effectively front-ran an acquisition of that company by 


GCL-Poly Energy in concert with Zuo Gongshan, the CEO of the latter. This netted Zhang a share in US$200m 


cash, US$350m in secured notes and a 5% stake in GCL-Poly. 


▪ SinoPhyto solutions, the side-hustle of Athenex Chief Medical Officer Rudolf Min-Fun Kwan and 


CEO/Chairman Johnson Lau purports to be a seller of traditional Chinese medicines. However, the 


company’s New Jersey certificate indicates it is an investment company. SinoPhyto has only received one 


shipment. We question the true purpose of this entity. 


Investors should not write off Viceroy’s opinions. We present below a sample of our track record, and notably 


point our Athenex’s directors have been connected to more fraud than any other group we have ever 


encountered. We only wished they had been our contras since the mid 2000’s.

1. Company response 


Athenex issued a response to Viceroy Research’s reports into significant issues with the company and its 


management. We view the company’s response to the issues raised as completely inadequate and nothing less 


than a slap in the face to investors. Management do not even assert Viceroy’s report is incorrect, vouching 


instead to “believe” our publications are misinformed. The response in its entirety is below: 


  
Figure 1 Athenex Provides An Update to Shareholders1 


The company has not responded to a single issue raised in our research. We take issue in particular to Athenex’s 


“commitment to strong corporate governance”.  


Athenex’s rebuttal state that management “take pride” in its integrity. This is hilarious 


given management’s track record of overseeing blatant frauds. 


In our first report on Athenex we detailed the involvement of several members of Athenex management with 


frauds Sino-Forest and Suntech. More recently, management flipped CDE in 6 weeks for a 262% profit. CEO 


Johnson Lau, Director Manson Fok and former Director Song-Yi Zhang took it further, flipping an arginase license 


for a 3,300% profit.  


Yesterday, we detailed Athenex ongoing involvement with William Zuo and Xiaojing Wu Li, two individuals who 


facilitated an illegal taxol smuggling ring headed by Ms Wu Li’s brother. Calling the consistency and brazenness 


of the management looting at Athenex “strong corporate governance” is a complete joke. We have uncovered 


even more evidence of past management issues, as addressed within this report and our prior work.  


Athenex even refuse to address the blatant photoshopping of their major Chinese API 


facility!

2. China Lumena New Materials Corp  


Song-Yi Zhang, former Director of Athenex2 and party to cash siphoning business Avalon, was a non-executive 


director of China Lumena New Materials Corp (HK:0067,) from January 2, 2008 to April 1, 2011. As revealed by 


Glaucus Research in their report on the company, China Lumena had fabricated revenue and sales figures to a 


massive extent during this period as well as unjustly enriching insiders through selling them re-acquiring stakes 


in subsidiaries. 


Zhang also held, and sold to China Lumena, shares in Sino Polymer through his vehicles Mandra Esop, Mandra 


Materials and Woo Foong Hong. Sino Polymer was one of China Lumena’s key subsidiaries whose operations’ 


revenues were overstated by ~90%.   





 
Figure 2 China Lumena Annual Report 20093 


Zhang’s tenure seems to have been centered around selling overpromoted assets to his buddies. 


3. GCL Silicon 


Zhang was more intimately involved with a larger cash and equity scan at GCL-Poly Energy Holdings(HK:3800) 


(GCL-Poly) where he effectively front-ran the company’s acquisition of Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon 


Technology Development Co., Ltd (JZPTD). He did this with the company’s CEO Zhu Gongshan who is well known 


for his ability to obtain financing from Chinese government-controlled banks4. 


Prior to this sale, GCL-Poly was principally concerned with the development, construction, management and 


operation of power plants.  


Step 1: Have your holding companies purchase an asset to be eventually acquired by the target company. 


Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Limited is a polysilicate manufacturer with operations in China. Later 


media statements that claim Gongshan founded the company himself in 20065 but he only held 65% of the 


company at its inception with several investment bodies holding the balance.

Limited (a tax exempt charity established, but not beneficially owned, by Mr. Zhang Songyi and his family)”.

Figure 3 GCL Silicon F-1 


Enter Zhang, who purchases 64% of JZPTD from Gongshan. What follows is a year of convoluted and opaque 


dealings which drastically changes the ownership structure of JZPTD. 


 
Figure 4 GCL Silicon F-1 


Effectively Gongshan and Zhang wound up with 75% and 10% respective stakes in GCL Silicon, which now owned 


64% of JZPTD. The remaining 36% of JTZPTD were owned 20% and 16% by Sun Wave and Greatest Joy, which 


were affiliated with Gongshan and Zhang respectively. 


The terms of all the above are unknown to us but it appears as though Zhang bought in to the project, displacing 


existing shareholders JZPTD shareholders by solely paying Gongshan.

Figure 5 GCL Silicon F-1 


Step 2: Try to IPO the bogus company using the proceeds to pay yourself for the asset. Syphoning cash is what 


the related parties and directors of Athenex are used to.  


On July 18, 2008, GCL Silicon Technology Holdings, Inc entered into a purchase agreement with Happy Genius 


Holdings Limited and Mandra Silicon Limited which held 82% and 12% of both Sun Wave and Greatest Joy, 


respectively.  


 
Figure 6 GCL Silicon F-1 


The purchase price for these assets was to be paid for through proceeds from the company’s IPO6, which never 


occurred due to “unfavourable market conditions”7.

Figure 7 Purchase agreement between Mandra Silicon, Happy Genius Holdings and GCL Silicon Technology Holdings 


Had the offering gone ahead it would have effectively placed the company under full control of Zhang and 


Gongshan, with the added bonus of a US$240m for Gongshan. 


Step 3: Using your position as CEO of GCL-Poly, start doing business with GCL Silicon, never complete the work, 


and pocket some more money. 


4 months later, GCL-Poly entered into an agreement with JZPTD for planning and preliminary work on a 2X25MW 


power plant for RMB10m (~US$1.5m). 


 
Figure 8 GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Limited 2008 Annual Report 


5 months later, the agreement was cancelled as Jiangsu had run into scheduling problem; GCL-Poly still paid out 


RMB4m (US$0.6m).  


Step 4: Once again using your position at GSL-Poly, reverse merge into GSL Silicon stripping yet more assets 


out of the company. 


The big payday was still to come: on June 3, 2009 for a total consideration of HK$26,350m (US$3,399m) including 


US$200m in cash and the issue of US$350m secured notes. On July 31, 2009 GCL-Poly acquired the entire equity 


interest of JZPTD.
Viceroy Research Group 8 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 9 GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Limited Annual Report 2009 


Note: GCL Solar Energy Technology is the successor company to GCL Silicon 


Readers will note that 36% of JZPTD was still held by Sun Wave and Greatest Joy. After all this Zhang wound up 


with a 5.54% interest in the company and a share in US$200m in cash, US$350m in secured notes and at least 


858m shares in GCL-Poly.  


4. Previous associates 


Several of Zhang’s associates in the companies mentioned above and in previous reports are now embedded in 


senior positions at Athenex. According to crunchbase, Athenex is the most popular destination for Mandra 


Capital alumni8. 


John Koh – GCL, Mandra 


John Koh is a current director of Athenex, appointed in April 20199, his bio in the GCL Silicon filings reads 


“differently” to the one at Athenex which fails to mention his directorship of Zhang’s Mandra investment 


vehicles.

Koh also sits on the Athenex audit committee, a complete breach of corporate governance considering his 


involvement with the Mandra entities and Athenex’s failure to disclose it. 


Koh made the spotlight in his 1995 representation of the infamous Barings rogue trader Nick Leeson, whose 


disastrous deals led to the collapse of the bank.  


Ben Tang – Mandra  


Ben Tang, Athenex’s Business Advisor and Executive Assistant to the CEO10, is also an employee of Mandra 


Capital. Tang is also the Vice President of Avalon Biomedical, the entity used by Lau, Fok and Zhang to flip licenses 


to Athenex and conduct margin-stripping operations.

Founded by Rudolf Min-Fun Kwan on January 12, 2010. Johnson Lau has been presented as chairman at 


conferences. Treasurer is female relation Rosetta Chan and the address of the business appears to be Kwan’s 


home address.  


The company appears to only sell 3 products, one of which is sold out: all these are products from Tianjin 


Zhongxin Pharmaceutical and there is a promotional piece on the site about Darentang, a company acquired by 


Tianjin Zhongxin Pharmaceutical in 2010. Several import websites suggest the company has only ever imported 


1 batch of products, the same as those it is still selling11.

The registration documents might explain this: they list the business purpose of SinoPhyto to be “investment” 


although online searches are bare of any investment made by this company. In addition to this the registered 


office of SinoPhyto is a residential address.

6. Summary 


We believe it is fitting that re reiterate our  previous summaries, and stand behind our work in its entirety, given 


management have decided not to address our data in specifics: 


Viceroy value ATNX stock at US$2.83 – a 71% downside –the sum of its tangible book value and 1x valuation 


on its licensing & consulting revenue streams, for the year ending June 30, 2019. With ATNX’s questionable 


license acquisitions and management’s precedent for overstated top line figures in previous ventures: this is 
optimistic. 


Management – A Company of Rogues 


▪ Several members of Athenex’s management team have a history of what appears to be either gross 


incompetence in fiduciary duties or clever mismanagement in infamous frauds internationally, 


collectively resulting in billions of dollars of write-offs including Sino Forest and Suntech.  


▪ ATNX directors have also acted as sellers and drop-shippers to rip off Athenex shareholders with margin-


stealing exercises through their investment entity: Avalon Global. Cash has consistently exited the 


business via similar related party deals.  


▪ Breaches in corporate governance principles: Athenex directors screwed investors by purchasing CDE for 


themselves and flipping it to Athenex for a 262% profit in 6 weeks. The company failed to report the 


circumstances of the transaction in any meaningful way. 


▪ In a separate instance, Directors pocketed a 3,300% profit by flipping an “anti-cancer mechanism” license 


to Athenex for US$5m, for which they paid just US$150,000 just 6 months earlier.  


▪ Directors award themselves millions of dollars’ worth of stock at no cost through the issuance of 


promissory notes that are cancelled on a time-vested basis.  


▪ Athenex directors have an uncanny ability to avoid any disclosure or reference to their involvement in 


historical fraud or related party deals. It's Viceroy's view that if investors were aware, they would not 


have bought $ATNX in the first place.    


▪ Athenex’s CFO J. Nick Riehle left unexpectedly for a “planned” retirement, just 10 months after joining the 


company but is now seeking work as a consultant. 


▪ Our investigations have found ties between Polymed and its management team’s ties to the largest taxol 


smuggling ring in history Hande Yunnan, resulting in 50 arrests and 32 imprisonments. Major perpetrators 


and shareholders of this scheme now work for Athenex.   


▪ Polymed appears to continue sourcing its taxol from Hande Yunnan, despite the fact that our investigations 


show Hande Yunnan no longer produce taxol. 


▪ Further inspection of Polymed’s management show inconsistencies in prior executive roles, specifically of 


William Zuo. Zuo was also the US liaison of bringing smuggled taxol to the USA. 


▪ A deep dive into Chinese regulatory notes from the Ministry of Emergency Management, coupled with 


Polymed’s history of objectionable site inspections by Chinese regulators and the FDA, lead us to believe 


that Polymed’s manufacturing facility suspension was anything but voluntary. In any event, Athenex’s 


manufacturing facility does not manufacture anything. 


▪ Viceroy dismantles photoshopped Polymed advertisements for its facilities and expose chemical 


manufacturing facilities we believe are non-existent or outsourced.
Viceroy Research Group 12 viceroyresearch.org 


Oraxol – Flagship or Shipwreck? 


Athenex has been reliant on the marketed prospect of Oraxol in order to obtain access to capital, having 


received going concern qualifications from Deloitte since 2016 and current yearly cash-burn rates of ~$100m. 


The company has raised ~US$360m in equity and US$80m in debt since 2017. Even if R&D costs are removed 


from the equation, Athenex’s licensing and consulting segments are operationally loss-making.  


▪ After consultation with industry specialists and oncologists, Viceroy believes Athenex’s flagship paclitaxel 


drug, Oraxol, cannot compete with the current standard of care available in the USA.   


▪ Oraxol’s clinical trial’s control dosing regimen of IV paclitaxel as monotherapy is an outdated treatment 


schedule dating from the 1990’s.  


▪ Oraxol’s marketed quality of life improvements are redundant. Patients will still require IV /treatment 


post-treatment, alongside complications from oral treatment.  


▪ Oraxol’s side effects appear more severe than those of the current US standard of care, Abraxane, and may 


require hospitalization due to their life-threatening nature. Reported adverse effects grade 4 neutropenia, 


grade 3 vomiting and unspecified GI complications were more severe than IV paclitaxel intake.  


▪ None of Oraxol’s clinical trials have included a US patient component. While the FDA does allow data 


overseas trials, these results are treated with much higher scrutiny. Viceroy believe ATNX studies are being 


conducted in South America due to a lower local standard of care: US patients could not be enticed to trial 


a drug against an outdated active control regimen.   


▪ Athenex’s Orascovery program – key to its marketed value proposition – was purchased for just US$7.5m 


upfront in 2011 after its previous owner experienced decade-long development delays with little headway 


into development. The Orascovery platform is busted.  


▪ Through consultation with experts, we believe Athenex’s pursuit of the 505b(2) pathway for Oraxol will be 


hampered by the fact that its paclitaxel delivery mechanism, HM30181A, has never been approved by the 


FDA. The FDA may require Athenex to pursue a further NDA for HM30181A. 


▪ Viceroy have identified what we believe to be Intellectual Property Theft from UK company Immunocore.  


XLifeSc’s flagship technology (in which ATNX put $35m upfront) may already be owned by GSK and further 


along the development pipeline: GSK’s solution is currently undergoing phase 2 trials in the US. 


Athenex’s operational and R&D cash-burn rate is over US$100m a year – the company would be lucky to survive 


until HY 2020 without needing a further cash injection from investors. Even if Athenex scrapped its R&D 


completely, the company’s revenue streams operate at a substantial loss. 


Accordingly, we believe our valuation of $2.83 is optimistic, and will be realized in the short term. We do not 


see a future for the company in its current state.
