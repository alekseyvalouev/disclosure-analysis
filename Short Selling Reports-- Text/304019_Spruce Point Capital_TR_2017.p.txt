Company 
Promotion


Leading consumer robotics company focusing on 
vacuum cleaners


Producer and marketer of Smart Balance butter, and leader in 
the gluten free market with Glutino, Udi’s and Evol


Our Criticism iRobot is an often-hyped stock geared toward retail investors 
with a history of failed innovation, poor governance, and self 


interested management. Management’s recent distributor 
acquisitions are designed to restock inventories quickly and 
bolster margins in the face of intensifying competition. New 


entrants such as SharkNinja are planning to enter the US market 
and will seek to be the #1 or #2 player, displacing iRobot’s 


market position and eroding its margins


Boulder Brands was facing a patent cliff on its Smart Balance 
butter and embarked on an expensive and levered acquisition 
spree to diversify into the faddish gluten free market. Segment 
realignments and questionable accounting were being used to 


mask fundamental strains. The CEO Hughes was highly 
promotional and had a questionable history of value creation 


Successful 
Outcome


On 9/11/17 SharkNinja debuted its new product in the US at 
leading retailers, which undercuts iRobot on price and delivers 


equal or greater value. Competition in the European market has 
also intensified with the entry of Electrolux’s new product, and 


Neato being acquired by German conglomerate Vorwerk. 
iRobot’s shares have corrected more than 25%


Boulder Brands took a significant goodwill impairment charge in 
Q3’2014 and guided results significantly below estimates by 


finally admitting headwinds in its spreads business and margin 
pressures. In June 2015, the CEO abruptly resigned. Boulder was 


forced out of the public markets and acquired by Pinnacle 
Brands for $11/sh, well below the intial short sell 


recommendation price

Undisclosed Asbestos Risk Uncovered 
Through Freedom of Information Request


Tootsie does not disclose anywhere in its SEC documents that its main manufacturing facility in Chicago is 
dealing with asbestos removal on an annual basis. Asbestos is a known cancer-causing agent that is 


transmitted through the air. We hope Tootsie has protections to prevent the asbestos from entering the food.

Asbestos Issues For At Least A Decade


The earliest record we obtained from the EPA was from the end of 2005. 
What company needs a decade to deal with asbestos issues? 


Is this why Tootsie forbids plant tours, has limited communications with investors, and is stock-piling cash to 
reserve against potential issues?

Spruce Point Is Short Tootsie Roll (TR) 
And Sees 25% - 50% Downside


Declining Brands With New Labelling Highlighting Consumption Challenges, Understates Health Impact: Tootsie dates back 
to the early 1900s and its brands are withering along with its core customers. Sales haven’t grown in 6yrs and we estimate it is
losing market share in North America. Our channel checks reveal it uniformly receives the worst product placement on the shelves
(esp. during key Halloween selling season). Tootsie’s products fail to address consumer demand for healthier products, and it has 
resisted industry self-regulatory movements to limit marketing to children. Early adoption of new FDA labeling requirements show 
Tootsie has shrunk its serving size, an implicit acknowledgement consumers are eating less candy. Enhanced sugar disclosure 
requirements now show significant added sugar content to its products. Families and kids take notice: we estimate a box of Junior 
Mints, a popular Tootsie product, contains 185% of daily added sugar needs 
Opaque Financial Disclosures, Overstated Gross Margins And Cookie Jar Accounting Inflating Operating Cash Flow: 
Tootsie is notoriously secretive about its financials: it doesn’t hold investor conference calls, invite analyst coverage, and has a 
minimalistic IR website. Its SEC filings omit significant information material to investors’ understanding of its business including: 1) 
product mix and pricing trends, 2) commodity cost impact to margins, 3) R&D expenditures. Tootsie also inflates its gross margins in 
a material way by excluding shipping, warehousing, and freight costs. This leads to an 800bps gross margin overstatement. Compare 
Tootsie’s adjusted gross margin of 31% with peers Hershey and Mondelez at 46% and 39%, respectively, and it’s easy to see that 
Tootsie is running an inferior candy operation. Even worse, we believe Tootsie has inflated operating cash flow by ~$50m since 2012 
though early termination of its split dollar life insurance policy. In essence, Tootsie lent money to these policies for the benefit of its 
executives, and is now tapping the cookie jar to reclaim funds and boost cash flow 


Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE: TR) is a producer and marketer of candies and lollipops under the brands Tootsie Roll, Blow Pops,
Junior Mints, Andes Candies and others. For years, the bull case has assumed Tootsie’s brands were iconic and “hope” that its


founders would eventually sell the Company at a rich premium. Based on extensive fundamental and forensic research, Spruce Point
sees flaws with this thesis and 25% – 50% downside once investors evaluate our compelling research.


Undisclosed Asbestos And Worker Safety Issues Revealed Through Freedom of Info Requests: Bulls think Tootsie may own 
valuable real estate in South Chicago at its 2m sqft HQ and manufacturing facility. Our property tax record search suggests total 
asset value of $40-$50m for key domestic properties. Tootsie doesn’t offer plant tours and is quiet on environmental issues in its SEC 
disclosures. We think we know why. We completed a Freedom of Information request with Chicago’s EPA region and were shocked 
to learn that Tootsie has been filing annual forms related to asbestos removal. Asbestos is a known cancer-causing agent that is
transmitted through the air. We hope Tootsie has protections to prevent the asbestos from entering the food supply and is adequately 
protecting its workers. Worker safety is an area that Tootsie appears deficient. We filed Freedom of Information requests with the 
Illinois and Boston OSHA/DOL districts and were dismayed to learn that Tootsie was cited repeatedly over multiple years by OSHA 
for “Serious” violations related to machine operations and worker safety. Tootsie’s apparent disregard for safety recently lead to a 
worker at its Cambridge Brands subsidiary having a finger amputated

Spruce Point Is Short Tootsie Roll (TR) 
And Sees 25% - 50% Downside


Unjust Management Enrichment and Horrible Governance: In our opinion, Tootsie is run for the benefit of insiders, while 
taking advantage of common shareholders through lavish compensation and excessive perks. Its dual class share structure 
allows Class B shares controlled by insiders to limit common stock voting control, while the Board is stacked with the CEO’s 
allies, none of which have experience in the food industry. Insiders have rigged the bonus structure in a way that virtually 
guarantees the maximum bonus every year, while allowing the top 6 executives to extract ~19% of adjusted SG&A in annual 
compensation (and grow comp more than 3x the rate of sales). Tootsie offers none of its employees equity or stock options, 
which virtually guarantees that no one will care about maximizing the share price
Terrible Capital Allocation Policies: Tootsie’s balance sheet is bloated with excess cash, which has delivered declining 
returns on investment. Is it hoarding cash for a rainy day to cope with a large future liability? It pays a meager 1% cash 
dividend, and teases a 3% annual stock dividend. However, its informal share repurchase strategy appears to be a ruse to 
buy back common stock, thereby allowing Class B insiders to gain increasing control every year. Tootsie could direct its 
excess capital toward improving its operations through greater capex; yet it spends 2%-3% of sales less on capex than peers, 
which should be evident from both the worker safety issues and its industry lagging gross margins we noted earlier. Its past 
attempts at acquisitions also seemed to have failed, especially in international markets where candy is growing fastest. For 
example, it recently disclosed in its 10-K “Risk of further losses in Spain” and that it is seeking ways to restructure operations
Excessive Optimism Of A Takeover Leading To Irrational Valuation And 25% - 50% Downside Risk: The perennial bull 
case is that Tootsie insiders will sell, yet no steps have ever been taken in that direction, even with Melvin Gordon dying in 
2015 at the age of 95 and his wife (now CEO) Ellen Gordon now 85 yrs old. We believe there are many “hidden” costs a 
potential acquirer would need to absorb (unfunded pension obligations, significant manufacturing, technology and distribution
capex, change of control premiums, and other deal expenses) that could amount to an extra $165m - $235m on top of 
Tootsie’s already rich valuation at 4x, 19x, and 38x 2018E Sales/EBITDA/EPS. Marquee candy and snack companies such as 
Wrigley and Russell Stovers sold for ~3.4x sales and 17x EBITDA, while trading comps in the sector suggest a valuation of 
3x, 15x, and 22x 2018E Sales/EBITDA/EPS. Tootsie has declining sales, suboptimal margins, limited international presence, 
and its products are out of touch with health focused trends. Its shares should trade at a discount to peers.  If Tootsie were to 
trade at 2x-3x sales, 12x-14x EBITDA or 18x-22x EPS, we could easily see 25% to 50% downside risk


Class B share structure limiting common shareholder rights, insider enrichment, terrible capital allocation policies and 
substantial “hidden” costs to acquire Tootsie leave no room for upside at the current valuation. Once investors come to 


terms that Tootsie is an inferior candy confectioner with a structure making it near impossible to effect change, we 
expect to see its valuation multiple normalize and 25% to 50% downside risk

Capital Structure and Valuation


There is no research coverage on Tootsie Roll given its reluctance to engage with outside investors. 
Tootsie doesn’t have a traditional investor relations website, hold conference calls, investors days, or offer tours (1). 
Based on our research, we believe Tootsie Roll will continue to lose market share, suffer from declining sales, and 


reduced margins. We believe Tootsie’s products don’t align with existing trends toward healthier offerings. 
We expect costs to rise as it spends more on FDA packaging changes, litigation, and raw materials.

Signs of a Business Under Pressure


Tootsie Roll, introduced in 1896, may be an “iconic” candy brand, but we believe its popularity has peaked, and it may struggle to 
connect with parents and children in today’s era of health conscious living. Competition in candies and snacks remains intense. 


Based on our research, we estimate that Tootsie has been losing market share as its sales and inventory turnover decreases.

More Headwinds Than Tailwinds


Headwind Tailwinds


 Commodity input costs have been soft in the past few 
years benefiting margins. 


• Cocoa, sugar and corn syrup (linked to corn)
• Warning: Tootsie has modest commodity hedges of 


$10.8m (3.4% of COGS) leaving it vulnerable to a 
sudden increase in prices


 Benefits from manufacturing efficiencies / cost 
containment strategies


• Tootsie has repeatedly noted that it has harvested 
benefits from these areas without further elaboration


• Warning: There are generally limitations to how far 
these strategies can continue to benefit earnings 


 Health conscious consumers + advocates are warning against 
sugars and candies as linked to obesity and diabetes


• FDA requiring labelling changes increasing packaging costs
• Industry competitors (Mars, Nestle, Lindt, Ferrera) have 


committed to produce more candies under 200 calories (Tootsie 
has not issued any comment)


• Mars alone invested $200m in R&D towards this low calorie 
product initiative (Tootsie does not disclose R&D spend)


• Tootsie Roll specifically called out for aggressive marketing to 
kids and not belonging to Children’s Food and Beverage 
Advertising Initiative, administered by the Better Business Bureau


 Rise of meal delivery services (Blue Apron, Amazon Delivery)
• Reduces foot traffic to supermarket and food convenience stores, 


which reduces marginal impulse candy buying at checkout
 Customer concentration increasing: 


• 2001: 15,000 customers / largest 16.9% (10-K) 
• 2017:  4,000 customers / largest 23.3% Wal-Mart (10-K)


 Litigation risks and negative press rising:
• New lawsuits filed in April and Oct claiming it “slack fills” cartons 


(i.e. under fills packages to cheat the consumer)
 Ongoing communication and lack of clarity from Tootsie’s 


management 
• Lack of succession or leadership plan with the CEO at 85yrs old 
• No quarterly earnings calls or financial/business guidance given
• No regular analyst coverage

Key Industry Trends in the US Candies and 
Snack Snacking Market


Trend Description Key Statistics (sourced from IRI)


Holistic Health Consumers are currently snacking more than ever, but are being thoughtful 
about balancing their indulgent needs with a healthier diet.  In order to support 
healthier snacking the lines between healthy and Indulgent snacks are blurring 
(e.g., chocolate covered pretzels and fruits) and the breadth of offering has 
increased substantially.  Ingredients now matter more than ever and within 
indulgent there is a halo around full fat dairy and some bakery items.


68% of 18-44 year old consumers state 
that eating a snack that contains 
chocolate instead of having a candy bar 
is enough to satisfy the chocolate
reward.


Flavor Innovation Given the focus on holistic health consumers are becoming increasingly 
discerning about where they spend their calories.  Manufacturers are 
responding by creating cross over snacks (e.g., healthier becoming indulgent, 
savory becoming sweeter) and customizing flavors for specific ethnic groups / 
taste preference (e.g., Latin American / Bourbon BBQ)


90.6% of consumers state they choose 
snacks based on tastes they will enjoy


Transparency Consumers ability to assess the sourcing and ingredients of what they are eating 
is critical to meeting holistic health objectives.  Transparent packaging, 
ingredient simplicity, claims/certifications and sourcing information are all 
growing in popularity.  Communicating benefits has been a winning strategy for 
many emerging snacks.


52% of consumers between the age of 
25-44 want reduced packaging  


Packaging 
Innovation


Consumers are increasingly looking for packaging that supports and promotes 
their holistic health and value objectives.  Easy to access ingredient information, 
reseal able packages that allow for ease of portion management / convenience 
and environmentally friendly substances are all attractive to consumers.


60% of 18-34 year olds state that 
product label and packaging influence 
their snack decision (IRI 2017 Snacking 
Survey)


Value Consumers are evaluating their spending decisions based on a product’s ability 
to satisfy today’s diverse snacking objectives at a compelling price point relative 
to other snacking alternatives


According to IRI the sales growth gap 
between premium and low for branded 
and private sales in 2016 was 6.2% and 
17.3%, respectively.  82% of consumers 
seek snacks that are a good value for the 
money

Key FDA Legislation Impacting 
Confectionary Industry


Final 
Ruling 
Date


Go Live 
Date


Rule / Description Implications for Confectionary Industry


5/27/2016 1/1/2020 New Nutrition Facts Labels
As of the implementation date manufactures must adopt a new 
label that gives greater prominence to calories, servings per 
container and servings size


Added sugars in grams and as % DV will be included on the label.  
Continue to require breakdown of fats, including “trans fats”


By law servings sizes must be based on amounts of foods and 
beverages that people are actually eating, not what they should be.  
For products larger than a single serving, but capable of being 
consumed in a single setting (e.g., pint of ice cream), dual columns 
including per package must be shown


Manufacturers will have to absorb the 
research and marketing costs associated with 
the new rollout (in progress) 


Levels of added sugars and trans fat (while 
applicable) in products will be explicitly shown 
to consumers


Revisit serving sizes and report total levels of 
added sugars, fats and calories associated 
with most candy


6/15/2015 6/18/2018 Partially Hydrogenated Oils (PHOs) are not Generally Recognized 
as Safe (GRAS)
As of June 18, 2018 manufactures must ensure that their products 
no longer contain PHOs


Manufacturers utilizing partially hydrogenated 
oils will need to incur costs associated with 
developing new recipes, potentially altering 
the current manufacturing process, 
potentially higher ingredient costs, costs of 
new labels/waste


 Florida and Maine Governors have lead a charge earlier this year to ask the Department of Agriculture to OK banning soft drink 
and candy purchases with food stamps (SNAP program). The topic has also been discussed in Congress.  A recent study by
the Voice of the People, a nonpartisan polling group, found that 76% of 7,000 respondents agreed that SNAP benefits should 
not be used to buy candy.

And Questionable Label Claims

Evaluating the Tootsie Roll Offering


Almost all of Tootsie Roll offerings are high in sugar (added sugars), and many of the leading sellers 
also have a meaningful amount of saturated fat.  These products will tend to be non-starters for anyone 


looking to make a healthy decision while snacking.

Tootsie Roll’s Ability To Pivot Its Product 
Lineup Is Inherently Limited


In Spruce Point’s opinion, Tootsie Roll’s historical success is tied to consumer nostalgia around select 
products (e.g., Tootsie Roll, Tootsie Pops) and children’s craving of sugary snacks.  Neither of these 
align well with the mega trends driving snacking.  Hershey’s on the other hand, is leveraging its core 
competency in “real chocolate” to remain relevant across a large swath of snacking while relentlessly 


innovating in the legacy candy space.


 “Hershey’s Recipes” is Hershey’s attempt to participate in the blurring lines (cross pollination) of healthy and indulgent 
snacking.  It should come as no surprise that Hershey’s is highlighting bacon and fruit driven chocolate recipes as both 
ingredients have been high growth snack categories


 Hershey’s has defined a portion of its product offering to specifically address snacking.  This offering takes advantage of  
high product demand areas like the combination of fruits & nuts and healthier dark chocolate.  These products are being 
delivered in a variety of package sizes that are resealable


 In addition to positioning themselves in the core growth areas of snacking, Hershey’s continues to innovate in the traditional 
candy space.  Cookie Layer Crunch is Hershey’s attempt to capture the growing demand for cookie snacks along side of 
popular flavors like mint, caramel and vanilla

Note that the new labels break out the amount of 
added sugars explicitly and presents this as a % of 


Daily Value.  Junior Mints contain 25g of added 
sugar representing 50% of Percent Daily Value!

FDA Reducing Serving Sizes for “All Other

Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (RACCs) are presently being updated by the FDA under the 
new label initiative based on data from NHANES What We Eat In America (WEEIA) Survey.  The bad news 
for Tootsie Roll and competitors in the space is that median consumption has now dropped to 22 grams 


from the prior RACC of 40g (45% reduction).

FDA Reducing Serving Sizes for “All Other 
Candies” Category – Blessing or Curse?


 Nutrition Facts and Labels Rule: Additionally, for certain products that are larger than a single serving but that could be consumed in one 
sitting or multiple sittings, manufacturers will have to provide “dual column” labels to indicate the amount of calories and nutrients on both 
a “per serving” and “per package”/“per unit” basis. The threshold for dual product labeling is 3x the single serving quantity.

Junior Mint Label Under Current Draft RACC


Despite the negative implications of the FDA’s new RACCs for “All Other Candy”, perhaps it will help to 
mask the undesirable nutrient makeup of their product.  If the RACC level for “All Other Candy” hadn’t been 


reduced, then Tootsie would also be required to show dual (full box) labeling.

What is a Tootsie Roll Anyway?


Below are excerpts from a description of the Tootsie Roll from Chocolate Candy Intelligence (http://www.chocolate-candy-
intelligence.com), a research and news website dedicated to chocolate and the people who enjoy it.  


Despite the iconic nature of the Tootsie Roll, it’s important to appreciate that it’s not “real chocolate” –
no where on the package is the word chocolate even used.  


This has implications for the demand of the product going forward and Tootsie’s ability to position itself in 
a healthier snacking world


Tootsie Roll is a cylindrical bar of mostly sugar, oil and milk.  With some cocoa and a few other things


Unlike a lot of candy bars, the wrapper doesn’t make a claim as to what the thing is.  Other than, well, a Tootsie Roll.  I would 
say it’s most similar to fudge, although really it has a substantially tougher, less creamy consistency than most fudge. 


The good news is, it will withstand hotter weather than a chocolate bar without melting.  And, similarly, it will last longer in
your mouth without melting away. 


The bad news?  This is not really a chocolate bar.  Even though, if you’re like me, you may have always thought if it as 
one.  Looking at the ingredients list, there is no chocolate, and no cocoa butter.  What there is, is cocoa and partially 
hydrogenated soybean oil (with sugars).  This combination is known as compound chocolate or imitation chocolate.


Ingredients and Nutrition
Again, the ingredient list here is not looking too happy. When we describe the items by category, it starts out like this:
Sugar, Another sugar, Partially hydrogenated oil, Milk, Cocoa [note this is the legacy recipe].


But let's look more closely.  Real chocolate has cocoa and cocoa butter, which are the two parts that chocolate beans 
can be separated into.  In compound chocolate the cocoa butter has been removed and replaced with cheaper (and 
generally less healthy) vegetable fats.  Worse if those fats are hydrogenated, as in this case.


So, my bottom line recommendation on Tootsie Roll is, don't eat very many of them.  But consider this choice if you're 
looking for a candy that's somewhat chocolatey to ride in your pocket in summer, that won't have turned into a liquid 
mess by the time you're ready to eat it.

On April 1st 2016 Tootsie Roll’s Recipe 
Changed w/ Little Acknowledgement


Spruce Point confirmed with Tootsie Roll that Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil was replaced with 
Palm Oil in all Tootsie Rolls on April 1st, 2016.  This was likely done in advance of the PHO ban set to 


take effect in 2018, but what were the implementation costs and what are future product and economic 
implications?

Potential Implications of the PHO Ban On 
Tootsie Roll’s Business


Per the National Confectioners Association (NCA) comment letter to the FDA on the PHO ban, the shift 
from PHO to alternatives will result in significant business disruption and costs to the candy industry


Generally, the confectionery products that still contain PHOs represent the most difficult 
technical reformulation challenges in the sector that require hard fats with specialized 
textural qualities. PHOs are also often used in soft/chewy candies (e.g. caramels, taffy, 
chewing gum, fondants, soft candy centers, butter mints, etc.) and products containing 
cookie/wafer inclusions. PHOs play an important role in the texture and shelf life of each of 
these product categories, yet each category will have unique challenges to reformulate.
The process of identifying viable new formulas and testing reformulated products will 
typically take companies 2‐3 years assuming at least one year to identify new 
formulations for each product and 12‐18 months to conduct shelf life testing.


Product 
Development


CAPEX & 
Manufacturing 


Process


Higher 
Ingredient Costs


Replacement fats may result in different processing needs for the production of 
confectionery products and could call for equipment or plant design changes.
Furthermore, alternatives to PHOs in chewy candies have resulted in changes to cold flow 
functionality, which impact the product design capabilities and ease of processing and 
packaging.


Beyond costs associated with the process of reformulating and new labeling, the cost of 
ingredients has major implications to growth for small businesses. Viable alternatives to 
PHOs are generally significantly more expensive than PHOs and those costs will rise 
as demand increases.  Furthermore, as demand for alternatives increases, it will be 
challenging for manufacturers to secure an adequate supply of ingredients.
33


Potential Implications of the PHO Ban On 
Tootsie Roll’s Business


Per the National Confectioners Association (NCA) comment letter to the FDA on the PHO ban, the 
shift from PHO to alternatives will result in significant business disruption and costs


Packaging 
Costs


Loss of 
Nostalgia


Other than products containing PHOs as incidental additives, virtually all reformulated product 
labels would have to be changed. Packaging will need to be re‐designed, new labeling 
plates will need to be made and existing packaging will need to be used or discarded. 
Packaging changes are expected to cost the typical confectionery manufacturer up to 
$80,000 per SKU, depending on the timeline to come into compliance, which may result in 
wasting packaging, as outlined further in section 5.


Replacement oils often result in different taste and texture in confectionery products. PHOs 
have particular influence on the mouthfeel of confections.  Confections are also often 
associated with nostalgia and therefore consistency is important to retaining 
costumers. Finding viable replacements to PHOs will be a challenge for confectioners.


Product 
Characteristics


Depending upon the product, functionality challenges will include stability, taste, 
appearance, texture, melting point, effectiveness as a moisture barrier, and processing 
need (e.g. melt temperature, compatibility with other ingredients, plasticity for extrusion). 
Typically, replacement oils that have been tested in confectionery products have 
resulted in less stable products with a major reduction in shelf life. For example, in soft 
and chewy candies, replacement of PHOs with alternative oils (i.e. coconut, palm) has 
resulted in a 30‐50% reduction in shelf life.

Tootsie Roll’s “Commitment” to Doing The 
Right Thing When Marketing to Children 


Bazooka Candy and Tootsie Roll Industries have previously marketed to children and have yet to sign on to CCAI.  When asked why by a 
Fortune journalist, Tootsie Roll spokesperson responded this way to a similar query: “Tootsie Roll is committed to doing the right thing. The 
new Children’s Confection Advertising Initiative calls for participating companies not to advertise directly to children under age 12. Tootsie 
Roll already had this policy in place, so we saw signing the pledge as redundant.”


Among the five candy companies that don’t belong to the CFBAI, two, Haribo and Tootsie Roll Industries, have no publicly available corporate 
policies about marketing to children at all. Haribo, a Swiss company that manufactures Gold-Bears and other gummy candy, and Chicago-
based confectioner Tootsie Roll Industries, both market widely to young children. Tootsie Roll Industries advertises its Tootsie Roll Pop 
extensively to some of the youngest television audiences possible, including to viewers of My Little Pony Friendship, Littlest Pet Shop, 
Strawberry Shortcake’s Berry Bitty Adventures, Fairly OddParents, and SpongeBob SquarePants.

Tootsie Roll


Products are sold to customers based on accepted purchase orders which include quantity, sales price and other 
relevant terms of sale. Revenue, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns, allowances and certain advertising 
and promotional costs, including consumer coupons (price reduction), is recognized when products are delivered to 
customers and collectability is reasonably assured. Shipping and handling costs of $40,629, $42,619, and $46,525 in 
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Accounts 
receivable are unsecured. (Source: 10-K, p. 70) and selling, marketing and administrative expenses include $40,629 
and $42,619 of freight, delivery and warehousing expenses in 2016 and 2015, respectively, were 7.9% of net product 
sales in both 2016 and 2015 (Source: 10-K, p. 14)


Mondelez


We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon delivery or 
shipment of goods. Revenues are recorded net of sales incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and 
handling charges billed to customers. Our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. 
Provisions for product returns and other trade allowances are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the 
same period that the revenue is recognized.  (Source: 10-K, p. 70)


Hershey


Cost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of our products. Primary costs 
include raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of 
manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities. Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries, 
wages, employee benefits, utilities, maintenance and property taxes.  (Source: 10-K, p. 54)


Gross margins are the best way to evaluate the efficiency of a manufacturing company. In the case of Tootsie Roll, we 
find that it obscures its true gross margin profile by misclassifying shipping, handling, and warehouse costs as 


selling, general, and administrative expense. Our conclusion is supported by the fact that its two closest competitors 
reporting under GAAP correctly include these costs as part of cost of sales.

“The Company also provides split dollar life benefits to certain executive officers. The Company records an asset equal 
to the cumulative insurance premiums paid that will be recovered upon the death of covered employees or earlier 
under the terms of the plan. No premiums were paid in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Certain split dollar agreements were 
terminated during 2015 and 2014 which resulted in the full repayment to the Company of all of the cumulative 
premiums previously paid on these policies. No split dollar agreements were terminated during 2016. During 2015 
and 2014, the Company received $7,591 and $6,496, respectively, of such repayments which were recorded as 
a reduction in the carrying value of Split Dollar Officer Life Insurance” (Source: 2016 10-K, p. 32)


In our opinion, Tootsie is engaging in actions to boost its earnings and operating cash flow by early termination of its 
split life insurance policies. Economically, Tootsie loaned money to fund the benefit of an insurance policy for its 


executives, and is now recollecting the money (interest free). Tootsie started terminations in 2012, well in advance of 
the eventual death of its CEO in 2015.  In total it has received $47.8m back from the cookie jar


Source: Tootsie Financials
Note: In 2002, Tootsie alluded to the fact that the Split Dollar Life Insurance premiums could be viewed as loans to executives: “The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the Act) amended the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to generally prohibit both direct and indirect corporate loans to certain executive officers and directors of publicly traded companies, but does not 
directly address split dollar life insurance premiums. Accordingly, the company has ceased making premium payments with respect to existing policies while it evaluates the potential 
impact of the Act on the split dollar life insurance benefit plan.” (Source: 2002 10-K, p. 8)

Creative Cash Flow Inflation


We view the repayment of insurance premiums to Tootsie as having the economic substance of a loan for the benefit 
of its executives. As a result, it is more accurately reflected as a financing cash flow. We believe Tootsie has used 


these repayments to inflate its operating cash flow. For quick primer, we suggest  reading the article Loan 
Arrangement section of “Split Dollar Life Insurance: How It Works”

Here’s Why Management Is Not Motivated
To Grow The Share Price


Source: Tootsie Proxy Statement


Why should Tootsie care about its share price when employees and management receive no stock? 
Management is virtually guaranteed the maximum cash bonus every single year for no growth. Its net income 


target of $35m (set in 2006 and unchanged since) compares with historical net income >$60 million. 


“None of the Company's employees receive stock options, restricted stock or other forms of equity compensation. The Board did not grant 
equity compensation to the Chief Executive Officer because of her significant equity stake in the Company. Other named executive officers 
also do not receive equity compensation, as the Board has decided to motivate executive behavior based on financial and management 
objectives consistent with the Company's corporate principles.”


“Under the terms of the MIP, if the Company has net earnings (as defined in the MIP) of greater than $35 million during the applicable 
performance period, each named executive officer is deemed to have earned an award equal to the MIP's maximum award of $3.5 million.”

When You’re The CEO of 
a Candy Company You 


Definitely Need Security!


In our opinion, Tootsie Roll’s CEO is abusing shareholders. Her annual cash flow exceeds $11m and yet the 
Board rubber stamps her personal use of a company jet.
Terrible Capital Management
47


Terrible Capital Allocation


Everywhere we look, we find mismanagement and disappointment in Tootsie’s capital allocation 
strategies. When will management change its practices to better reward shareholders or is the 


Company hoarding cash for a rainy day fund to deal with a large liability? 


Internal 
Investment


Based on our analysis, we believe Tootsie is significantly under investing in its business. Its capex margins 
trails peers by at least 2% of sales. Its main manufacturing facilities are old and recent signs of operational 
hazards underscore inadequate training and controls. Spending on software, technology and resources to 
improve its supply chain appears woefully inadequate and was just $4m in the past three years. 


Acquisitions


Tootsie has generally refrained from acquisitions, but its last purchase of Concord Confections for $218m in 
2004 looks like a failure. It acquired a 50% interest in two Spanish companies and gained operating control in 
2014. Tootsie has been quiet about its Spanish business until it recently disclosed “Risk of further losses in 
Spain” and that it has restructured its Spanish subsidiaries “and is exploring a variety of programs to increase 
sales and profitability”


Dividend and 
Share 


Repurchases


Tootsie reports $326m of cash and investments and yet makes little use of this cash to reward shareholders 
in any meaningful way. Its stock yields approximately 1% – an amount that trails its peers which on average 
yield 2.2%. Why doesn’t management boost the dividend? Tootsie does not have a formal or publicly 
announced stock repurchase program. However, from what we see in the past few years it has ranged from 
$25 - $35m / year and been used to offset the 3% stock dividend. The repurchases have not included Class B 
shares, thereby allowing insiders to further increase control


Return on 
Idle Cash


Given the significant excess cash on the balance sheet, we would hope that management would at least 
be skilled at maximizing return on the cash. However, we find that returns through interest and dividends 
have generally been declining in the past five years. With so many investment alternatives and a booming 
stock market, it’s baffling why management has decided to be overweight corporate bonds, variable 
demand notes and municipal bonds
48


Significant Underinvestment In Capex


Margins will likely remain suboptimal while Tootsie significantly underspends peers in capital expenditures 
(notably technology). The situation is so dire, employees lack basic internet access.

Misunderstood Stock Dividend


Investors have a false belief that the 3% stock dividend is somehow beneficial to shareholders. However, by closely 
evaluating the statement of shareholders’ equity, we find that it allows the family to gain increasing economic and voting 


control over time. From the table below, we see that in the last three years, Class B shares have grown from 22.2m to 
24.2m (7.2%), while the common shares have grown from 37.0 to 37.7m (1.8%). Share buybacks are being used to 
eliminate common shares and not the B shares. This has transferred an additional percent of control to insiders.

Common (% ownership) 37.01  (62%) 37.70 (61%)

Unfriendly Cash Dividend and 
Share Repurchase Policies


Given Tootsie’s significant cash balance, ample free cash flow, and underleveraged balance, why hasn’t the 
Company rewarded investors with a bigger (special) dividend or greater share repurchases? 


The dividend has increased by just 1 penny per quarter in the past few years.

Bull Vs. Bear Debate


Iconic and Trusted Brand: Everyone

that has significant brand value


Valuable Land / Real Estate: Tootsie owns a 
2.5m sqft facility in South Chicago, property in 
Cambridge MA and other distribution/warehouses 
across the country and the world 


Significant Value To An Acquirer: 
Many strategic acquires would love to own 
Tootsie, and private equity is flush with cash and 
could be interested. 


For years the upside case has centered around “hope” that Tootsie’s iconic brand and an eventual 
sale of the Company will lead to great shareholder returns. We believe this is wishful thinking. 


CEO is 85yrs Old, Her Death Is A Catalyst:
Once she passes away there will be ample 
opportunities to realize significant value for 
shareholders


Brands in decline and out of touch with 
consumer health trends. Royalty revenues 
stagnant for years. Losing market share and 
has poor product placement


This has been the story for years. Since 
the passing of her husband Melvin in 2015, 
there has still been no clarity given to 
investors and no changes have been made 
to suggest a sale will occur


For the US key US properties based on tax 
records we estimate just $40 - $60m of 
value, hardly anything exciting. Asbestos 
issues facing Chicago HQ and capex needs


Shares already priced beyond what a 
reasonable acquirer would pay and investors 
are overlooking significant “hidden” costs 
which could exceed $200m


International Opportunity: Tootsie has 
tremendous opportunity to expand globally 


Tootsie’s international sales have failed 
miserably and are down from $51m to $42m 
in the past three fiscal years
55


Hidden Buyout Costs


The bull case has always been that Tootsie is an easy takeover target. However, there are other substantial “hidden 
costs” often overlooked that need to factored into the acquisition case. On top of a premium to its current overvalued 


share price, a buyer would have to absorb $165 to $230 million of added costs

2013 and $1m in 2015. No contributions were made in 
2015 and 2016. It’s essentially a $3.7m/yr payment (in

We find the assessed property to be $32 million. Using a rule of thumb that assessed values are 50% – 80% of market 


value we estimate a range of $40 - $65m.

Tootsie: The Most Valuable Candy Company 
In the World…Right?


Declining revenue growth, a suboptimal capital allocation strategy, underinvestment in capex, and a reticent 
management team that abuses shareholders, yet Tootsie receives the highest multiple in its industry.

Takeout multiples for marquee assets such 
as Russell Stover/Mars were 3.0x and 3.8x. 
Current trading multiples also average 2.8x 


with some of the better assets trading at 
3.0x-3.4x. We believe 3.0x would be a rich 


multiple for Tootsie’s subpar assets and 
stagnant brands, with a more likely 


multiple a half turn lower at 2.5x to reflect 
its declining sales outlook

14x – 15x represents a full multiple based 
on takeover and trading multiples. We 
expect margin headwinds from rising 


litigation costs, packaging and raw material

Peer average is 22x being our upward 
bound with Tootsie being valued at a 


discount to peers


$ in millions, except per share amounts


We arrive at our price targets by normalizing Tootsie’s stratospheric multiple to reflect its lower quality operations, 
declining earnings power, and lower likelihood of a takeover.

Suggestions For Tootsie’s Management


Communicate: with shareholders through regular 
conference calls, investor days, research coverage 
to provide a roadmap and a succession plan


Allocate: capital in a better fashion. Increase 
capex to close the gross margin gap. Increase the 
cash dividend and eliminate the stock dividend. 
Use low yielding cash for something 
Aggregate: the two share classes to bridge the 
alignment of interests between the CEO and 
common shareholders


There are simple steps Tootsie can take to improve its perception in the public markets. Given that it 
has had many years to figure this out, we are not optimistic change will take place.


Innovate: provide more clarity on your R&D 
expenditures, new product introductions, and 
ways to stem the declining sales performance


Motivate: your employees by implementing an 
equity culture that rewards people for improved 
company performance
