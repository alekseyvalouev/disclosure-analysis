Puda Buyout Unlikely After Auditor Resigns
Jul. 15, 2011 9:22 AM ET30 comments
by: Alfred Little


Puda Coal (NYSEMKT:PUDA) was halted on April 11 after the stock collapsed following a
report (here) by one of our contributors that PUDA's Chairman Ming Zhao:


...transferred the ownership of PUDA's sole Chinese operating entity, Shanxi Puda
Coal Group Co., Ltd ("Shanxi Coal"), to himself in 2009 without shareholder approval
according to official government filings. Then, in 2010 Zhao sold 49% and pledged
the other 51% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC Trust Co., Ltd ("CITIC"), a Chinese private
equity fund, for RMB245 million ($37.1 million). Zhao then recklessly leveraged
Shanxi Coal by borrowing RMB3.5 billion ($530.3 million) from CITIC at an incredibly
high 14.5% annual interest rate (including fees) to finance the development of its
coal mines.


Zhao brazenly documented the transfer of ownership and high interest loans in Chinese
regulatory filings but failed to disclose his actions to the SEC or U.S. investors, beginning
with the transfer of 99% of Shanxi Coal to himself, leaving U.S. investors with nothing.


Incredibly, the Board's three month long independent investigation has yet to divulge any
feedback on Zhao's actions despite the unambiguous Chinese public records. Instead, the
Board has repeatedly delayed making any of its findings public while the investigation
drags on and investors are left clinging to hopes Zhao might buy them out. Without a
buyout, most investors agree PUDA shares would trade for pennies on the Pink sheets.


Adding to the uncertainty last week PUDA's auditor, Moore Stephens, resigned, explaining
that as a result of Zhao's undisclosed 2009 ownership transfer PUDA's audited 2009 and
2010 financials can no longer be relied upon. Disturbingly, PUDA concealed portions of
the auditor's resignation letter by asking the SEC for confidential treatment in yesterday's
8-K (link here). So investors continue to be left in the dark by PUDA. In the resignation
letter Moore Stephens warned the Board that:


The circumstances described above could constitute illegal acts pursuant to Section
10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, we remind the Board of its
obligations under Section 10A, including its obligations to provide notice to the
Commission.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/279612-puda-buyout-unlikely-after-auditor-resigns 2/9


Section 10A of the Act requires the auditor to utilize audit procedures that can detect
criminal activity, wherever possible, and to notify the audit committee and the SEC when
criminal activity is detected, making note of such activity in the auditor's resignation letter
filed with the SEC (a good discussion of this rule can be found here).


Meanwhile, Zhao's only public "defense" is his continued assertion that he intends to buy
out PUDA public shareholders. Obviously, a buyout offer is a way for Zhao to side-step
criticism of his actions and keep the focus on compensating investors for damages.
Nevertheless such a buyout is all but impossible given Zhao's history outlined below. How
can Zhao's potential buyout partners, including CITIC, continue their association with him
considering the following:


On 9/3/09 Zhao's brother signed off on the transfer of shares of Shanxi Coal to Zhao,
without shareholder approval, giving himself 99% ownership of Shanxi Coal and leaving
U.S. investors with nothing. An official copy of the "Notification of Share Registry Change"
can be downloaded (here), including a partial translation.


On 2/18/10 Zhao raised $14.5 million (8-K here) from U.S. investors, without disclosing to
the investors that PUDA no longer owned Shanxi Coal, its sole operating subsidiary in
China. U.S. investors were buying "nothing".


On 7/15/10 Zhao sold 49% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC for RMB245 million ($37.1 million) and
pocketed the proceeds. An official copy of the "Notification of Share Registry Change" can
be downloaded (here), including a partial translation.


On 7/19/10 Zhao pledged the other 51% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC as security so Shanxi
Coal could obtain a 3-year loan for RMB2.5 billion ($379 million) at a cost of 14.5%
(annual interest plus fees) from CITIC, rolling the dice on his ability to generate cash flow
from his coal mines.


Zhao subsequently doubled down and convinced CITIC to increase the loan to RMB3.5
billion ($530.3 million), bringing the combined investment to RMB 3.745 billion ($567.4
million). The official filed copies of the share pledge agreements detailing all these
amounts can be downloaded (here and here).


Zhao agreed to annual interest and fees on the high interest loan amounting to an
unthinkable RMB507.5 million ($76.9 million USD), over twice the $34 million EBIT shown
in PUDA's 2010 10-K filing. Any failure or delay in the expansion and modernization of the
mines would lead to default.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/279612-puda-buyout-unlikely-after-auditor-resigns 3/9


On 12/16/10 Zhao raised another $101.5 million from U.S. investors by selling 7.85 million
shares at $12 per share (8-K here), failing to disclose all of the above ownership transfers
and high interest debt. Again investors were buying "nothing."


In a partial attempt to cover up his actions, Zhao transferred the pledged 51% interest in
Shanxi Coal to Shanxi Puda Mining Industry Ltd ("Puda Mining"), a former 100% owned
subsidiary of Shanxi Coal that, through suspicious shareholder shuffling, Zhao
maneuvered to make it the 51% parent of Shanxi Coal. Puda Mining's 51% interest in
Shanxi Coal continues to be completely pledged to CITIC (see official agreement here).


On 3/16/11 Zhao filed PUDA's 2010 form 10-K, again failing to disclose any of the above
devastating actions and abuses conducted without Board or shareholder approval.


On April 8th Alfredlittle.com published Zhao's history of shareholder abuses (original
report here). The following day PUDA's stock was halted, indefinitely, for PUDA's Board to
conduct an independent investigation that so far has reported no meaningful findings other
than Zhao's interest in buying out PUDA's public shareholders. So far the Board has only
reported Zhao's "positive" buyout news while delaying any negative findings for the final
report. The Board's suppression of any negative findings is very damaging to investors
trying to value PUDA as its shares should soon reopen for trading on the Pink Sheets.


The Board has abandoned their obligations to investors, who are forced to form their own
opinions of the buyout. Many were pleased to see that Zhao raised 668 million HK dollars
($86 million, link here) in the last few months from selling a portion of his King Stone
Energy (00663.HK) holdings. But seriously, who knows what Zhao will do with the money?
His Hong Kong King Stone shares are one of his few liquid assets. Given the allegations
he faces perhaps transferring the proceeds offshore to a Swiss account makes the most
sense. Given his long history of abuse of shareholders, Zhao seems unlikely to have a
change of heart and suddenly use his own money to fund an honorable buyout. He cannot
borrow from banks since all his assets have already been over-leveraged and pledged in
the CITIC deal. Nor will any fund partner with Zhao considering the strength of the
allegations against him. He has no other source of funds.


Therefore when PUDA shares finally start trading on the Pink Sheets if there is any
opening price pop it is merely a bull trap that institutions will wisely use to dump the rest of
their holdings. By the close PUDA.PK will be back below $6 and by year-end it could be
worthless. Given the history, who would possibly want to bet on Ming Zhao?


Disclosure: I am short PUDA.

so a predictable move by an incompetent auditor proves something to you? Really, it doesn't to any logical person.

Moore Stephens accused the BOARD of possible illegal acts:


On 7 June 2011, we sent a letter to the Audit Committee (copy attached) requesting an update on the status of the
Audit Committee’s investigation. Counsel for the Audit Committee provided our counsel with information on the status
of the investigation on 30 June 2011. Additional information was provided in discussions on 1 and 4 July 2011.
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]...


1. the company provided details on their investigation to Moore Stephens on July 1st, and 4th. 
2. Moore Stephens told the company that these details should be revealed to its shareholders and information
provided to the SEC. 
3. the board chose to ignore Moore Stephens, thus triggering violation of section 10A


This deed by the PUDA board is done. They of course, don't care about US SEC disclosure laws.

No doubt, Ming Zhao is experiencing no so subtle pressure from Chinese authorities to make things right with and for
NYSE/AMEX shareholders if he expects to preserve his future privileged status.

So are we really supposed to believe a smart chairman who orchestrated the whole asset theft scheme is stupid
enough to pay $246 million to buy an empty American shell company with some remote chance of claim to the same
assets him already owned in PRC?

Considering your position and bias, you are probably concealing numerous documents in order to support your
hearsay, fabricating and accusations. Somebody is going to kill this guy and the president of China is going to have
egg all over his face if this kind of thing continues. China and its people, miners, coal industry all have a lot more to
lose by letting this guy get away with this, so I wouldn't count out somebody holding a gun to his head at this point
and that means anything can happen. I doubt if this high profile millionaire is going to get away clean. Also, the mine
is worth a fortune. He may not want to walk away from that sure thing, considering coal is golden in China.

This is just another worthless SA article by a short seller, full of speculation and innuendo.


When the buyout occurs at $12 per share or higher, poor Al and his short buddies will be in deep trouble.

PUDA has a market cap of less than half a Billion. Why doesn't the Chinese govt buy us out & nationalize the assets?
I would love to get in on the latest Mongolian coal project, but will not buy anymore Chinese companies, nor foreign
companies that partner with them. Will certainly miss many great opportunities, but as the saying goes" Fool me once,
shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me". Then the Chinese govt can sell Mr. Zhao's organs to a high bidder!!

What I find amazing is when I bought PUDA (the week of April 11, it was in part because & I used 5 different on-line
sites. All of them using charts & numbers put a 12 month price of $18.00 on this company. How can so many different
sites all get the wrong information? At least the Street. com was big enough to admit they made a mistake. They
changed the $18.00, 12 month price target to $21.00 on the Tuesday after the stock was halted ! I'd sell my PUDA if I
could,& surely buy the product that these wise advisors are smoking !

bernie1; That is exactly how most of us got into PUDA, and other stocks as well. Certainly causes me to
wonder how much these stock info sites know before a stock collapse. Shirley [pun intended] they do not
want to be left holding an empty bag. So, what do we do for honest up to the moment info?

john s. gordon
this is very reminiscent of all the boiler-room operators that were pushing dotcom stocks over my telephone
back in the year 2000. 
all a person needs is a boiler room & a little money to rent a phone line & then he sets himself up as a
"broker" or "adviser", and then steers you to the latest & greatest bubble. 
one guy did get it right, told me to buy worldcom, then a few months later called me & said sell it this turkey
has no more upside left. 
good timing. will any of the current crop of thieves call you when it's time to sell? 
seems doubtful.

There's no new information in this article. It's just a summary of what's already transpired so far, and it's not even
recent. It does give the impression that Alfred Little is preparing for the situation that PUDA opens OTC and to
persuade folks to sell shares when that happens. The more interesting information is mentioned in Chris Wu's
comment. What's the detail that Moore Stephens told PUDA to reveal publicly?

Author’s reply »  The 8-K/A today is very interesting. Moore Stephens is clearly unhappy that PUDA did not fully
disclose all the reasons for Moore Stephens' resignation. Those reasons must be very damning. I think the delisting is
for certain now. The buyout is a joke.

Nope Alfred, PUDA isn't a joke. It's merely a piece of paper to an empty American shell company with
(hopefully) an non-controlling, minority investment interests in some assets (controlled by the very same thief
who emptied the shell) in a US investor non-friendly country and a board who treats SEC disclosure
requirements like jokes. Oh well, you're right. It's still a joke. All of this will be apparent when the new auditor
properly restates the entire financial statements for the past 2+ years, provided any one auditor is still stupid
enough to take them as a client.

Whether the buyout is a lot more likely now depends on whether the BOD wants to go forward with MZ. Otherwise, its
becoming a lot more apparent that the company will be whole.


Whatever you supposedly dug up (more likely somebody tipped you off) was never an attempt to 'steal' the company
nor would it have been illegal. CITIC is clearly trying to distance itself from any supposed deal with the Chairman.

I hope the chinese government will fine and imprison Zhao and the involved parties of CITIC and return to the
company what has been stolen from it, if such a filing is even a legitimate transfer. This is such an evident theft how
can legal authorities ignore it?? I HATE CHINA STOCKS AND CHINESE BUSINESS MEN!!!

"Given the allegations he faces perhaps transferring the proceeds offshore to a Swiss account makes the most sense.

At least at this moment, this comment is a speculation, mainly based on AL's negative feelings about Ming Zhao not
supported by facts. I doubt Zhao's real intention is to "steal" from shareholders. If you know one thing or two about
business environment in China, those small companies have always had hard time getting loans from state-owned
banks which only support large state-owned companies. Zhao had to resort to CITIC for fund at exorbitant rate. But
this is not the only fact. Another fact is that there were also terms included in a contract for Zhao to redeem ownership
of those coal mines from CITIC in the future when he has sufficient fund. This shouldn't be overlooked when you are
talking about Zhao's real intention. Recklessly, Zhao gamed with those ownership transfer back and forth because he
saw it as a "convenient" way to get loans to finance new coal mines. From the first beginning AL's articles tried to
portray to readers an image of "thief" with an intention to "steal", which is biased and only to support his impossible-
buy-out claim.
