My Analysis Of Lumber Liquidators' Updated Guidance
Dec. 10, 2013 10:40 AM ET10 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


After the close yesterday, Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) updated its guidance (see press
release here) and released a new investor presentation (here). I believe this new
information provides evidence to support the key pillar of my investment thesis (outlined in
my original presentation, posted here): that margins will come under pressure, leading
Lumber Liquidators to miss the exuberant expectations built into the stock price.


While LL increased its prior guidance for Q4 and 2014, it missed current consensus
analyst estimates. Specifically:


For Q4


Net sales of $252-$258 million; the midpoint, $255 million, is exactly the current
consensus
EPS of $0.69-$0.72, below the current consensus of $0.73
Incremental SG&A of $1.8-$2.3 million, up $0.4-$0.5 million from prior guidance due to
"the start-up of the West Coast distribution center and certain incremental legal and
professional fees" (interestingly, on page 5 of the investor presentation, the language
is different: "the start-up of the West Coast distribution center and certain incremental
legal and professional fees associated primarily with regulatory matters, including the
Lacey Act investigation, and the continued enhancement of our compliance programs"
- exactly the areas I highlighted that would cause expenses to rise and margins to fall)
Most importantly, LL guided to materially lower gross and operating margins relative to
Q3 and the trend over the past 2+ years, as this chart shows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887441-my-analysis-of-lumber-liquidators-updated-guidance 2/8


(Note that while LL gave Q4 gross margin guidance of 40.4-40.7%, it didn't give operating
margin guidance. I estimated a range of 12.5-12.8% based on the average of 12.4% for all
of 2013 - see page 31 of the investor presentation.)


For 2014


Net sales of $1.15-$1.2 billion, in line with the current consensus of $1.16 billion
EPS of $3.25-$3.60; the midpoint of $3.43 is below the current consensus of $3.50
Operating margin of 13.0-13.8%, up from 12.4% for all of 2013


This guidance would be fine if the stock were trading at 15-20x earnings (which is where it
would be trading if the market were rational), but at yesterday's closing price of $103.80,
the stock is trading at 38x the midpoint of 2013 estimates and 30x the midpoint of the new
2014 guidance.


Such nosebleed multiples can only be sustained by companies consistently beating
estimates and raising guidance - which is what LL had been doing for the past two years,
leading to a nearly 7x rise in its stock. But LL just missed and lowered - and for precisely
the reasons I outlined.


As investors wake up to LL's new reality, I think the stock drifts lower until the next
earnings report in the third week of February, at which point the company will update 2014
guidance. I expect even weaker guidance for the year at that time, as I think it's highly
unlikely that LL can increase its operating margin from 12.4% in 2013 to the 13.0-13.8%
it's now promising for 2014. Rather, I think operating margin will be flat to down, which
spells big trouble for the stock.


For those of you who really want to dive into the weeds, LL's latest investor presentation
includes a number of new and updated slides that aim to address the many issues I've
raised - see the appendix below for the highlights. LL is very clever in presenting
information which makes the case that even if the Environmental Investigation Agency
report is correct, it focuses on only one supplier, which the company can simply stop
sourcing from with minimal disruption.


I'm skeptical that this is an isolated problem limited to one rogue supplier. Rather, I believe
that Lumber Liquidators has a big problem on its hands due to the combination of a) the
evidence in the EIA report, b) the unusually rapid increase in Lumber Liquidators' margins
to unprecedented levels immediately after acquiring a Chinese supply chain company, and
c) the hugely corrupt business environment in both Russia and China. Though I can't

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887441-my-analysis-of-lumber-liquidators-updated-guidance 3/8


prove it, the evidence I see, combined with common sense, makes me think it's highly
likely that what EIA has uncovered is a pervasive problem across Lumber Liquidators'
Chinese supply chain.


Since the raid, the company is surely scrambling to show the authorities that whatever
problems are in their supply chain are isolated cases, they didn't know about it, etc. But
keep in mind that the authorities raided Lumber Liquidators based on the EIA report, so
they're not going to be easily fooled by some spin and token actions. Rather, I think
Lumber Liquidators right now has no choice but to very quickly clean up its act to avoid
major sanctions by the authorities.


Specifically, I think Lumber Liquidators will have to: 1) immediately stop sourcing from
suppliers they even suspect are trafficking in illegal wood; 2) find replacement suppliers;
and 3) ensure their entire worldwide supply chain is pristine. Doing all of these things is
likely to be very costly and disruptive to the business - not to mention management being
distracted by having to deal with the authorities for the foreseeable future.


Yesterday's updated guidance reinforces my belief, so I maintain my $53 price target (and
I think I'm being generous), which is based on the following back-of-the-envelope math:


Sales grow 16% annually in the next two years, as analysts expect (resulting in
revenue of $1.35 billion)
Operating margins give back half of the 830 basis point increase in the last nine
quarters and fall to 9% (still far above the long-term average)
The market responds to this by assigning the stock a 20x P/E multiple
Result: $1.35B x 9% - 39% tax rate / 28M shares = $2.65 EPS x 20 = $53


Appendix


Here are my comments on the latest investor presentation:


1) This was the slide in the prior investor presentation (dated 8/14/13; posted here)
showing the sources of gross margin improvement:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887441-my-analysis-of-lumber-liquidators-updated-guidance 4/8


This is the new version of it:


Notice how they’ve carefully removed any mention of buying product for less – instead it’s
“eliminate markup” and “eliminate middlemen”.


2) In slide 21, Our Sourcing, LL repeats that “No single supplier provides more than 4% of
our hardwood purchases” and “No single hardwood product represents more than 1% of
our sales mix”. In addition, there’s new language here:


Mills go through an on-boarding process and regular reviews of performance

Since the fourth quarter of 2011, we have replaced 50% of the Asian mills existing at
that time, yet doubled the net total number of mills to reduce risk by diversifying our
supply base
In any given year, we expect mill turnover to range from 15% to 30%, yet continue to
broaden the number of mills supplying flooring products


3) On slide 22, LL highlights again that hardwoods are declining as a percentage of sales
(now down to 43%, from 47% in 2012 and 64% in 2008).


4) Slide 23 is a new slide on sourcing mix, showing an “Increase in Asian sourcing where
bamboo and Acacia hardwood grow, and where laminate, engineered and handscraped
hardwood products are cost-effective to produce.”


5) Slide 24 aims to show how insignificant Asian hardwood is in LL’s supply chain:


6) Slide 25 addresses the formaldehyde issue: “Our emissions compliance policies and
procedures are designed to go above and beyond regulatory requirements and make our
products, whether sold in California or any other state/country, compliant with CARB’s
wood product formaldehyde emission standards.”


7) Slide 31 shows the expansion in operating margin, but adds three more years and adds
this box that reads: “SAP Implementation in August 2010: Full Productivity Restored in 2H
2011”. In other words, operating margin fell as the new SAP system was installed, and
then expanded as the benefits of the system kicked in. Here’s the slide from August:

@Whitney Tilson - you go this one right Whitney, and it will pay off handsomely. Like you, I am short the stock and
expect a major sell off as the world wakes up to the weaknesses in the story. Thanks for writing.

You think the regulatory issues will bring the analysts back to reality and stop the momentum bidding. Do you think
the company's sales will slow, something the analysts also take into account?

Pretty interesting they don't come clean on both Laminate and Hardwood but then that's what they are upping the
legal payments for someone to tell them what to say huh? Did they think the people selling them the sourcing/mill
business in China would give them full disclosure and how much DD did they really do in seeing where the product
really came from? Today's sell off shows that nobody wants to be holding the hot potato or going for the last chair in
that game.It was a Call game before but now it looks like a Put option now.

Thanks for you work.


I added to my short and will continue to press.

The claim that almost half the gross margin expansion (200-300bps) is from  
"ASP & Sales Mix"  
-premium product conversion 
-store training 
-POS discipline 
-Expansion of customer base

is pretty hard to swallow. The last 3 are very dubious. 'Premium product conversion' seems counter intitutive given
they say the hardwood mix has declined from 64% to 43% since 2008.


The slide regarding hardwoods mix seems like misdirection to me. 
In terms of sourcing, 51% is Asian and 33% is hardwoods implying about 17% of product is Asian hardwoods
(presumably they are refering to product volume here).


The next slide says only 13.8% of the product mix is Asian hardwood, of which 1.6% each is birch and oak (which are
common RFE hardwoods).


I get what they want us to believe. But it is fairly obvious they are selectively providing info to give the appearance that
all is well. Clearly, product mix is not a good indication of volume or margin contribution of hardwood products.


We know that 17% by volume is Asian hardwoods. We cannot say how much is birch and oak since LL deliberately
doesn't tell us. It could certainly be a meaningful % (across a relatively small number of SKUs).


What we do know is that oak and birch are amongst the most expensive products LL sells - if a meaningful amount is
illegally sourced, then margin contribution from these products could be incredibly high.


Likewise, Oak laminates are among their most expensive laminate products.


LL clearly wants us to believe that even if they are sourcing illegal hardwoods, the margin impact is not likely to be
significant. I don't think they have done a good job of that and they really haven't put a dent in the short thesis. If
anything the selective disclosure makes them look less trustworthy.

Great analysis!

Pretty amazing to see how their capex guidance for 2014 (page 8 of the pdf presentation) is $65-75mm for next year!
It includes the new distribution centers, but that is far more than their 2012 capex of $13mm and 2013 on trend for
~$30mm. They said before that the Virginia DC would be $42-46mm...doesn't that seem like a lot for a distribution
center?

Mr. Tilson,


During this sell-off, is this now in over-sold territory or not yet? Thoughts?
