The HCI Group: Inconsistent And Unprofessional
Aug. 5, 2015 2:00 PM ET36 comments
by: RH Analytics


Summary


Better-than-expected numbers were overshadowed by inconsistent and
contradictory comments by management regarding growth opportunities.


Backtracking on previous comments, management guides expectations toward a
4Q15 assumption of risky wind-only policies from Citizens.


Management resurrected the "flood opportunity", this time indicating it could
generate $500M in premiums annually for the company.


HCI always seems to hold out the hope of growth, but this time inconsistencies with
previous comments render management unprofessional and not credible, in our
view.


Last night the HCI Group (NYSE:HCI) reported 2Q15 financial results. Despite the fact
that EPS numbers were better than expected, we don't think the results warrant investor
excitement. Just the opposite. Discussions on the conference call revealed management
to be inconsistent, and in our view, unprofessional and not credible.


HCI is considered a growth company in the low to no growth Florida insurance business.
Historically, HCI has grown policy count and premium by assuming multi-peril policies from
Citizens Insurance, the state-owned carrier in Florida, and the acquisition of books of
business from failed carriers in the state. Increased competition for takeouts has shrunk
the multi-peril pool considerably, leaving policies HCI appears to consider unattractive.


Approximately 18 months ago, the opportunity for large takeouts waning, HCI began
underwriting flood insurance in Florida in effort to drive growth. However, various issues
emerged to undermine the opportunity. Consequently, underwriting to date has been
minimal, meriting barely a mention in the 1Q15 10-Q.


In another attempt to drive growth, HCI entered into two assumption agreements in 1H15
dominated by wind-only policies. Wind-only policies have been deemed largely
untouchable by other private insurers, because high expected losses make them
extremely expensive to reinsure and largely unprofitable. In our note, HCI Group: More
Risk, Less Return, we illustrated why wind-only policies are unlikely to be profitable.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3402675-the-hci-group-inconsistent-and-unprofessional 2/10


The 2014 and early 2015 wind-only takeout were expected to be the last. On the 4Q14
conference call an investor asked about when takeouts would not be available. Mr. Patel
replied that "I think we are pretty much there now". We wrote about that in our note HCI
Group: Patel Admits Game Over.


Without either takeouts or new products to drive growth, on the 1Q15 conference call, Mr.
Patel directed attention to the potential for a transformative acquisition, likely outside of
insurance. We addressed Mr. Patel's hope-inspiring discussion of acquisitions in HCI
Group: You Can Have Your Donut and Eat it Too.


It appears as if HCI has come full circle in 2Q15. On the conference call, Mr. Patel touted
the growth opportunities available both with wind-only takeouts from Citizens and flood
insurance. Contradicting previous commentary, Mr. Patel characterized opportunities with
Citizens' wind-only policies as an "untapped pool" as he set expectations for a 4Q15
takeout.


Mr. Patel then implicitly slighted his competition for pursuing soft-rate muti-peril business
outside the state. HCI, apparently at the vanguard, is going to pursue hard-rate flood
insurance outside the state - a much stronger opportunity. Mr. Patel then went on to
quantify the flood opportunity stating that the company could gain a 15% to 20% market
share over time for $500M in annual premiums.


On every conference call, HCI seems to hold out some hope for future growth. In doing so
on this call, the company has come full circle to resurrect growth drivers that only recently
appear to have been declared dead.


We would be surprised how anyone who has listened to or read recent conference call
transcripts could take management guidance seriously. In our opinion, mounting
inconsistencies are unprofessional and raise serious questions about management's
credibility. To our mind, it appears as if management is grasping for ways to obscure a
dying business model from investor view.

Sir Falstaff
The conference calls at this point are more a source of amusement than anything else. Touting growth from real
estate, their joke of an IT business, donut franchises, etc... but clearly, the growth story remains intact:


"Do you track organic policy generations for the quarter?"


"No, we don’t because it’s almost so meaningless in our measurements over the years that we just don’t track it."

To Provide Readers Full Context of Discussion:


Arash Soleimani - KBW 
Then, few numbers questions; one, could you provide a gross premiums written and policy count?


Richard Allen - Chief Financial Officer 
I think gross premiums written I mentioned, but just a second I’ll take it back out for you.


Paresh Patel - Chairman and CEO 
Yes. And I think the policy count at the end of quarter was around 170,000 or so.


Arash Soleimani - KBW 
And do you have -- do you track, I guess organic policy generations for the quarter?


Paresh Patel - Chairman and CEO 
No, we don’t because it’s almost so meaningless in our measurements over the years that we just don’t track
it.


Richard Allen - Chief Financial Officer 
Gross premiums written for the quarter, 155.3 million.

Every other insurer in the world wishes they could just sit around and make money all year and then in Dec
go pick out their favorite policies to make even more money doing nothing the next year. 
It's why tons of companies started up to copy the HCI model. And then they all think they're smart once they
make this easy money, try to expand outside of this arbitrage opportunity and get killed i.e. UIHC.


Guessing you love UIHC?

By what way of your doing math do you get 20+% growth to be inconsistent and unprofessional?

These guys built a $500M business from scratch in a few years and then the lemmings came following, as will be the
case with wind-only and flood insurance. Entirely inconsistent and unprofessional, indeed.


05 Aug 2015, 03:35 PM


Sir Falstaff
Because as management admitted on the call, there is no organic growth. In fact, organic growth is likely negative,
which is probably why management is unwilling to supply this figure.


05 Aug 2015, 03:43 PM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
Gross premiums written for the quarter, $155.3 million.


Whether this is organic or 3rd party generated, it is not "negative", and it IS growth.


05 Aug 2015, 03:57 PM


Sir Falstaff
Oh my god, I don't know how I didn't realize that!? You were right all along. I'm going to cover, sell all my
holdings, and take a highly margined position in HCI. Btw, if you like HCI's growth, regardless of its source
and quality, then you should give XPO a look. Massive, endless growth story.


05 Aug 2015, 04:06 PM


Bluegrass Holdings
Yay!!! Someone here understands math and growth. 
Thanks for helping to clarify the obvious for those in need.


05 Aug 2015, 08:18 PM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
Firstly, Many major insurance companies utilize 3rd party agents to sell their products. Would you also
consider them as "no growth" because they don't create meaningful numbers organically (internally)?


Secondly, many major insurance companies buy blocks / books of existing business from other insurance
companies that they believe are profitable. The selling companies sell these blocks / books of business
because they may be exiting this line of business or because the block is too small and no longer profitable
for them to manage. However, this block / book of business may be quite profitable and inexpensive to
manage for the buying firm who has the economies of scale and/or the acquired policies aligns directly with
their systems and core business focus.


Either and both examples above do not in any way suggest or assert a lack of vision, operational deficiency
or declining future business opportunity.

Sir Falstaff
Alfred, I literally cannot think of another way to explain this business to you, nor do I really care. Review all of
my comments and all the critical articles from RH Analytics, Pump Stopper, etc. and then stop and think about
the business. I have and will continue to take money directly from anyone on the other side of this trade.
Adieu.


05 Aug 2015, 11:29 PM


Bluegrass Holdings
Thanks Falstaff for least admitting to not being able to explain this business, since you clearly don't
understand it, instead of just assuming it's bad because it's different.


I believe to Alfred's point, HCI could quite easily go out tomorrow and start a "me too" insurance operation
and lose money like the rest of them. Instead they've chosen to only "swing at the fat pitches", so to speak,
thus creating the outsized profit margins that some (probably Falstaff) have used to claim the business will
fail. 
How that makes a business destined to fail is beyond me. On the contrary, they seem like the smartest guys
in the room, hence why everyone followed them into the takeout business and "crowded the trade".


Policy count continues to grow and the normalized annual earnings grows right along with them. Share price
eventually follows. Those are the only facts that exist.

Bluegrass Holdings
I made 1000% in three months on HCI's warrants, back then it was HCII (kids like you wouldn't remember
this), when the stock was less than $10 and then rode the stock for another 100% after exercising those.  
So contrary to another one of your conjectures, as seem to be all your "analyses", I've "done work" on this
company for longer than you've had your $5000 Tradeking account day-trading operation.


I also owned your other favorite short, XPO (how's that one working out for you?) when it was a $3 stock and
know that business from the time it was just a few regional trucks.


Welcome to investing with grown-ups that have seen the ups and downs time and time again and seen
boatloads of novices like you fall by the wayside. Especially the ones who don't realize that shorting stocks is
a moronic risk/reward tradeoff from the get-go, but even worse when you short thriving businesses run by
intelligent people.


Good luck, Sir :)


06 Aug 2015, 01:22 AM


Sir Falstaff
I don't day trade, I invest usually with a 2+ year outlook. If you can't even understand a simple take out
insurance company, I won't expect you to understand the ponzi financing roll up of disparate businesses run
by the guy who was CEO when his previous company admitted to accounting fraud, largely related to ongoing
acquisitions.

Welcome to the extensive club of people who have transferred their hard earned money to Falstaff.


06 Aug 2015, 01:36 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
Ha. Okay, let's circle back 2+ years from now and see where HCI is.


And I fully understand the roll-up nature of XPO, because I owned the stock when they started those
shenanigans, years ago, and was why I sold my shares. It would be pretty unintelligent to short that seeing as
how it's gone from $3 to $44 since I first analyzed it and most of the gain has been during the roll-up years.
You do realize the most money you'll ever make shorting a stock is 100%.


Once again, good luck out there, Sir :)


06 Aug 2015, 01:45 AM


Sir Falstaff
I don't need luck. Unlike you, I have skill and good mentors.


06 Aug 2015, 08:56 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
Do you have any actual math or statistics to show that HCI is operating a dying business?  
And how long have you been harping on your "death spiral" scenario, because all the numbers I see include huge
growth in sales and earnings, over many years, and management has clearly laid out how they will grow in the future.


If this and all your other articles on HCI are just conjecture based on your visions of what could be, which they seem
to be, then that's fine, I'd just like to confirm and make it clear that reality is one thing and your opinions are another.


Thank you


05 Aug 2015, 10:54 PM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
Indeed RH,


You proffer a number of negative suppositions without providing reader with ANY concrete data to back up your
negative assertion.


If your 'Short' case is so strong, it should be easy to provide numbers / statistics / hard facts to back it up, right?


But then again, I suppose you had to dramaticly attack HCI's future outlook in order to protect your Short position...
after HCI posted such a strong quarter showing.

Yes, let's blame the short sellers for yesterday's reaction, not the terrible industry, strained/unsustainable
business model, or incompetent/shady management team with minimal insurance experience.


RH has actually done an entire series on HCI and the entire Florida insurance industry, supported by a lot of
numbers/statistics/hard facts. I don't expect you to know that since you never read any of them, but RH has
actually done some very high quality research on this company/industry.


The short case is very strong and will play out over the next year or two. I have yet to hear one valid counter
argument. The only rebuttal seems to be, "yahoo told me earnings keep growing".


06 Aug 2015, 11:01 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
Alfred,  
What is your estimate of Q3 earnings? Assuming no major storms. 
Thanks


06 Aug 2015, 11:18 AM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
I haven't completely digested the lastest Earnings Call information yet, but preliminarily, I'm looking at Q3
Diluted EPS (without any major storms) to come in at $1.71 - $1.80


Due to the Take-Outs HCI acquired from Citizens in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015, I believe HCI results this year are
pretty much 'locked in' for 2015, and these should bring in new highs.


Once I finish my full review of the earnings call information, I will update these numbers and publish it here if I
see anything material that will impact these figures (+/-).


NOTE: These numbers also do not include the impact of any accretive M&A, Real Estate
Deals/Developments, or additional Policy acquisitions (Citizen or 3rd party).


06 Aug 2015, 11:46 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
Roger that. Thanks. 
I'm at $1.50-1.60 range. So currently a $6/yr normalized run rate. 
I feel 10x earnings is pretty conservative for a company that always finds a smart way to grow, but will
statistically lose one year worth of earnings each decade from a major storm. 
$60ish price target.  
I've seen $55 from some other professional analysts, but they're earnings estimates have already been
proven to be to low and I assume they're closer to $60 now too.


06 Aug 2015, 12:37 PM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
Agreed. My price target it $58 - $60 for 2015, so we're in the same ballpark on estimates.

2015 EPS (w/out major storm) at $6.25, and $7.25 on the high end.


But I am conservative on the market price due to the downward pressure caused by the major Short Selling
against HCI.


06 Aug 2015, 01:46 PM


Sir Falstaff
Low quality revenue/earnings from take outs won't get you there (and no, Alfred, acquired growth is not
universally bad). My price target is ~$20, hopefully $0.00 if a hurricane comes given their reinsurance
structure and inadequate second/third event coverage. You guys already know this though, since you are
reinsurance wizards and checked with Florida's regulators.


06 Aug 2015, 01:56 PM


Bluegrass Holdings
I'm sure they'll pick up more policies in Q4 so nothing wrong with the high end, but I just value it off of the
current earnings to be conservative and the fact that they manage to grow double digits every year, despite all
the apparent "headwinds" that shorts have been harping on for years, is gravy.


See you at the top!


06 Aug 2015, 02:44 PM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
That's yours and all the other Shorts only true hope - a major hurricane.


Without that scenario, I don't see you making any significant profits.


07 Aug 2015, 11:08 PM


Sir Falstaff
False. I see you losing money with or without that scenario, as I have mentioned ad nauseam.


08 Aug 2015, 10:13 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
Haven't you heard, Alfred?  
$6+/share in normalized annual earnings and continual growth are now worth nothing. 
Because some shorts said so, it must be true.


08 Aug 2015, 01:29 PM


Alfred L. Angelici, Contributor
Bluegrass, I had to lower my estimates a bit due to the increase in ReInsurance program cost coverage for
the 2015 hurricane season.

I've submitted a new article with SA for publication that provides details. Stay tuned.


09 Aug 2015, 08:17 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
I accounted for it.  
The latest filing gives you the annual cost, assuming no storms, so just divide that by four for premiums ceded
per quarter going forward. 
The cost per percent of premiums written is in-line with historical results, so if you just do the calcs based on
historical % then you come up with a similar estimate. 
Look forward to the read. Thanks

I'm hoping stock gets another bounce up so I can short it; Again.


07 Aug 2015, 10:08 AM


Bluegrass Holdings
So you've covered and are hoping to short this for another like a 10% return?


I'm starting to realize that people who are short this company have lack the ability to comprehend basic risk
vs return calculations. Which is the basis of HCI's operations and investing and why they don't understand
either.


Maybe it's a genetic defect of some sort.


08 Aug 2015, 01:33 PM

10% and 12% on $9,000 doesn't suck if you can keep doing it. Plus it is fun, like a game Bluegrass :)

Alfred: I forwarded some numbers to you in the other parallel thread regarding HCI. I also see some fundamental
questions which were never answered over here, though. Companies use the term "organic growth" to describe
virtually anything which is not take-out or buying someone else's book. UVE uses this term to describe their growth,
through agents and various marketing efforts. You can contrast this with companies that rely on take-outs such as HCI
and Heritage. It is quite obvious that there are fundamental flaws when a company is thinking that wind-only policies

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3402675-the-hci-group-inconsistent-and-unprofessional 10/10


can drive their growth when reinsurance costs are going to double on the book. I think one estimate is 65% of
premium, as I believe that number was given by the company to OIR. What is going to happen is they are going to
self-retain the book. They will use their captive who will relax underwriting to allow one risk policies, or simply retain it
all in Homeowners Choice. Their margins will still dwindle, especially if they increase underwriting to this superhuman
level they have described. Alfred, it is all a pure bet that can never be justified fundamentally in the long term. UVE
has reduced their quota share to zero (no ceding of policies). HCI is taking policies which cannot be reinsured and will
now retain them in some form. A transformation has occurred where companies are becoming their own reinsurers in
Florida. If you are large and diversified, you can expect very modest single digit growth (and relative safety) in
reinsurance. If you write undiversified single risks with maximum exposure (wind/flood), you might as well take all the
money to Vegas and bet black every year. These managers are not incompetent, they simply have realized they have
to ratchet up the risk, which they know they can't effectively mitigate, and they will [probably] reap short term benefits.
But when the hedge funds run, as they slowly realize all is reinsurance driven, it is sayonara. No offense to the
speculator, I win in Vegas almost every time, except when I lose. Call it what it is, and stop telling people it is a strong
long term investment. Would you have a member of your family invested in one of these companies in their pension
as a core holding? Of course not, the hedge funds only put 1% of their money into these companies. If I was from
Lloyd's, and had these Florida companies' exposure to my general fund, I would be running like the wind already. A
spotlight is on this industry and I would expect it to stay there now that institutional money is firmly entrenched. By the
way, Mr. Patel was trying to use the word "tranche" during the conference call. One digs a "trench", especially for
themselves when they simply parrot the party line.


15 Aug 2015, 11:14 PM


Bluegrass Holdings
It's funny now that the shorts are losing on the case that HCI will soon dwindle to nothing as Citizen's is "tapped out"
(which people have been saying for years now and HCI still gets a huge chunk of business every year), the story is
now that their reinsurance is crap and they will never be able to make money on wind policies. 
Did you note that rate hikes for wind only are 10% this year? And will probably go up at that rates for mulitple years,
just like multi-peril did when HCI essentially invented the Q4 takeout business years ago because it was a hardening
market and a great risk/return model. 
So yes, HCI mgmt knows nothing. Have you thought of contacting them and offering consultation services?
