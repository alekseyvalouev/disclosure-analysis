This morning, Bloom Energy issued a press release
(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190918005379/en/) responding to some of the
issues that we raised yesterday in our report “Bloom Energy: A ‘Clean’ Energy Darling Wilting To
Its Demise (https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-
its-demise/)”.


We appreciate the company’s response, but �nd that its press release does nothing to refute
the �ndings of our research or our conclusion that the company could be a bankruptcy
candidate as its debt approaches maturity.


In fact, we believe that as readers carefully compare Bloom’s responses to our research, it
becomes clear that the company instead largely con�rmed our concerns.


Sometimes the Things Le� Unsaid Echo the Loudest. Here
Are the Issues That Bloom Failed to Address Entirely.


Right o� the bat, we note that there were multiple key items in our report that the company
failed to address. In particular:

Our report: Bloom’s carbon emissions are comparable to that of a modern natural gas
power plant.


Bloom’s response: None.


Our report: Bloom’s tricky accounting allows it to only record one year of servicing
liabilities despite contracts that last up to 25 years.


Bloom’s response: None.


Our report: Subsidies are being pulled or stepped down, which would have a material
e�ect on Bloom’s �nancials.


Bloom’s Response: None.


Our report: Bloom has been ‘selling’ replacement servers to the same projects and
booking it as NEW revenue. The impact of these deals has been material; last quarter
alone, server replacements accounted for ~40% of Bloom’s revenue.


Bloom’s Response: None


Of the items Bloom did respond to, we �nd their responses to be woefully inadequate.


Our Report: Bloom Should Not Compare Its Emissions to
the Marginal Grid


Bloom’s Response: Here’s a Chart of Our Emissions Versus
the Marginal Grid


One key issue we highlighted was how, contrary to the company’s clean energy narrative,
Bloom’s CO2 emissions are far DIRTIER than the electric grid in most key states in which it
operates:

(Source: 2016 EPA eGRID summary tables (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/�les/2018-
02/documents/egrid2016_summarytables.pdf), table #3)


We speci�cally noted that Bloom attempts to sidestep this reality by wrongly comparing its
emissions to the “marginal grid”. As we detailed, the marginal grid largely consists of the
dirtiest “peak” power sources available, and is not comparable to Bloom’s servers, which run
continuously.


Bloom’s “marginal” comparison was the same argument that was roundly (and rightly) rejected
(https://www.svvoice.com/bloom-energy-misrepresents-its-technology-and-santa-claras-ghg-
pro�le-says-city/) by Santa Clara, California, when Bloom sought to �ght the city’s renewable
energy legislation.


In the city counsel meeting, Santa Clara’s resident environmental analyst
(https://www.svvoice.com/di�ering-analysis-fuels-energy-regulation-debate/) and engineer
Suds Jain did not mince words when Bloom attempted to use its “marginal” emissions
argument:


“They’re cherry picking facts. Bloom boxes are less e�cient than our Donald Von
Raesfeld power plant which is 60% e�cient…They compare Bloom boxes to our
dirtiest oldest generators. They’re not comparing to Donald Von Raesfeld which is
combined-cycle.…They compare their plants to our ageing plants. The last thing is
they’re comparing to marginal emissions. Those marginal emissions are peaker
plants. Bloom boxes are [not] peaker plants. They’re not as cost e�ective as
peakers.” (See video at 3:20:35 mark

Bloom obviously doesn’t like comparing itself to the actual electric grid (we wonder why). And so,
the �rst chart that Bloom placed at the top of its press release is that of its “marginal output
emission rate”, and cited a paper that sought to justify the comparison:


We �nd Bloom’s marginal grid comparison to be further evidence that its “clean” narrative has
already collapsed.


Our Report: Here Is Tangible Raw Data Showing Bloom’s 5
Generation Fuel Cells Won’t Last 5 Years


Bloom’s Response: Please Allow Us to Repeat Our Claim
That 5  Generation Fuel Cells Last 4.8 to 5.2 Years Without
O�ering Any Supporting Data


On the �nancial side, Bloom’s response largely side-stepped our analysis of its undisclosed
service replacement liabilities.


Our report analyzed granular monthly data on dozens of actual Bloom projects and found the
company’s estimates for the useful life of its fuel cells to be widely overstated.


We disclosed our entire collection methodology and the raw data that we used to draw
estimates, speci�cally for two reasons:


1. We wanted readers to have a clear understanding of the data we were using to draw our
estimates.


2. We wanted to give the company as much detail as possible so it could refute, with
speci�city, any claims it would like.

Instead, the company provided a response that simply rehashed its old claim that new fuel
cells last 4.8 to 5.2 years without providing data. Again, the data we presented speci�cally
refutes this claim.


This chart, based on data from California (https://www.selfgenca.com/home/resources/) and
New York (https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/search/), shows how rapidly Bloom’s newer post-2016
installed servers are declining by month, on average. It also shows how the trend continues:


Our �ndings were also corroborated by multiple experts in the �eld who were highly skeptical
of Bloom’s claim that solid oxide fuel cells could last 5 years or longer.


We encourage the company to provide actual granular data to the market to give investors a
thorough understanding of the life of its products.


Our Report: Bloom Has $432 Million in Recourse Debt and
$296.2 Million in Convertible Notes Will Come Due in 2020


Bloom’s Response: That Is “Erroneous and Misleading”. We
Have $432 Million in Recourse Debt and $296.2 Million in
Convertible Notes Will Come Due in 2020


With regard to the company’s precarious debt situation, Bloom calls our assertions “erroneous
and misleading” – before then con�rming exactly what we said in our report.

For instance, Bloom con�rmed in its response that it has approximately $432 million in
recourse debt on its balance sheet and that $296.2 million in convertible notes will be due at
the end of 2020.


Bloom did not mention in its response that the conversion price for the $296.2 million tranche
of debt is now far out of the money, at $11.25 per share. This likely means that, upon maturity,
Bloom will have to put up the cash.


The company stated that it could re�nance its existing debt, issue new debt or equity to help
deal with its liabilities.


As we stated yesterday, we believe a re�nancing would likely be on toxic terms. We don’t
believe the company will be able to tap the debt markets or issue equity without materially and
negatively impacting its capital structure. New debt would likely come with aggressive
covenants and a large coupon, given the company’s �nancial position. Issuance of new equity
(as the company nears 52 week and all-time lows) could be extremely dilutive to existing
shareholders.

Should Provide Further Transparency to Investors
