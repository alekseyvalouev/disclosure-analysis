THE TWO FACES OF NU
SKIN


 


Over the past 5 years Citron has written about
numerous Chinese companies who were being less
than forthright in their disclosures in the U.S.
markets.  But we now turn the tables — exposing a
U.S. domiciled company that is being far less than
honest about its operations in China – defying
Chinese government regulation while exploiting an
ambitious population eager for a formula to climb
the economic ladder.


   Introducing Nu Skin 
(NYSE:NUS)
 


In the United States, multi-level marketing (MLM)
has become part of our economic fabric.  It is not
our proudest achievement, but nonetheless it has
become a part of our society – one that sells
dreams along with an array of overpriced products
that most people can live without just �ne.  The U.
S. has established a patchwork of little understood
regulations that provide some protection for the
public from the most abusive forms of pyramid
schemes, mostly under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.   ( See “Lotions and
Potions” at the FTC website.

5/18/2018 The Two Faces of Nu Skin – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/the-two-faces-of-nu-skin/ 2/20


http://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm
[https://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm]   (The
SEC also has both concerns and regulatory
oversight in this problematic area: 
http://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm
[https://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm] ) 


By contrast, China prohibits multi-level marketing
strictly and in entirety.   Pyramid schemes create
victims by creating an endless chain of recruits who
recruit new recruits into a wealth transfer scheme
which cannot possibly be sustained.  Therefore the
vast majority of the participants lose their money. 
Often pyramid schemes are cloaked in the sale of
an overpriced product, with new recruits being
required to “invest in inventory” to gain or maintain
certain levels of membership which most will be
unable to achieve.  These abusive business models
are understandably outlawed under Chinese law. 


China does have a law which de�nes and permits
only “direct selling”.  Much like many Chinese
companies which ignored the regulatory laws of the
United States, it is the opinion of Citron Research
that Nu Skin is grossly violating the laws of the PRC,
and their entire Chinese business operation could
be in jeopardy of seizure and other substantial
risks. 


Before we introduce the evidence pointing
conclusively to widespread violation of Chinese law,
this discussion begins with the importance of the
China market to Nu Skin.  The company was beset
by challenges from various U. S. regulators in the
early 1990’s, when several states were investigating
the company for everything from misleading sales
practices to operating a pyramid scheme.  Nu Skin
realized that their future riches were not on these
shores, but rather overseas, and particularly in
China.


 


1. Greater China comprised almost
75% of Nu Skin's year-over-year
revenue growth in Q2. 


2. Greater China represented less than
10% of the company’s revenue just 3



https://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm

https://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm
5/18/2018 The Two Faces of Nu Skin – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/the-two-faces-of-nu-skin/ 3/20


years ago, and is now 33.6%.
3. The average distributor in greater


China purchased roughly $1,200
worth of product in Q2, almost triple
that of the U.S. and double the
average levels of prior periods in
China.


4. The future of the company, and in
particular, the growth story that
underpins the value of its stock, is
dependent on China.  As CEO
Truman Hunt just stated "Emerging
markets, particularly China and
South Asia, will continue to drive
healthy overall growth rates…"


5. Sales in North and South America
contributed just 12 percent of
revenue in the last quarter, with
Europe just 7.7%. 


So the Chinese operation is contributing very
materially to the company’s overall �nancial results,
particularly in shoring up its �agging growth in
other regions.  (Details provided below.)


With the U.S. Consumer becoming increasingly
resistant to the core business of Nu Skin, they just
moved their entire dog and pony show to China …
but is it legal?


Here is what Nu Skin says it does.  In its most
recent 10-Q, Nu Skin describes its business
operations as:


“The Company operates in a single operating segment
by selling products to a global network of independent
distributors that operates in a seamless manner from
market to market, except for its operations in
Mainland China.  In Mainland China the
Company utilizes an employed sales force,
contractual sales promoters and direct sellers
to sell its products through fixed retail
locations.” 


This disclosure language is extremely signi�cant. 
Nu Skin acknowledges that their operations in
5/18/2018 The Two Faces of Nu Skin – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/the-two-faces-of-nu-skin/ 4/20


China are a separate and distinct exception –
obviously they cannot operate in China the same
way they operate everywhere else in the world. 


Why?  Because China has strict laws regulating
direct selling as well as a strict and clear and total
prohibition on multi-level marketing. 


Nu Skin’s disclosures go further.  They state:


“Our operations in China are subject to
significant government scrutiny, and we could
be subject to fines or other penalties if our
employees or direct sellers engage in activities
that violate applicable laws and regulations.
The legal system in China provides
governmental authorities with broad latitude
to conduct investigations. We anticipate that
our business will continue to attract
significant governmental scrutiny,
particularly as our business grows and the
number of sales employees and contractual
sales promoters continues to increase.”


The risk here is for U. S. investors to regard the
above warning as “just boilerplate”.  Citron believes
that readers will understand the above-described
looming threat in a completely new light after
reviewing the evidence presented in this report.


   What Nu Skin Says they Do: 
Direct Selling
http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/rodsa433/
[http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/rodsa433/]


Nu Skin obtained its business licenses and
established its presence in China by having agreed
to operate under the “Regulations on Direct Selling
Administration”, essentially promising to do
business as “a direct sales organization”. 


The direct selling law (linked above) is quite clear –
it was structured to address a business model in
which a company could legally engage direct sales
sta� (note all the law’s 60+ explicit references to
“door-to-door salesmen”) who were expected to sell
products directly to consumers — a simple and



http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/rodsa433/
5/18/2018 The Two Faces of Nu Skin – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/the-two-faces-of-nu-skin/ 5/20


well-understood model, if somewhat dated by
Western standards, that might boost employment
and create a channel for the distribution of goods
to consumers. 


This is a humble and straightforward business
model that is certainly not founded on the promise
of making millionaires.  However, note that this law,
in article 27, it makes the company, not simply the
salesmen, liable for violations.


It is Citron’s opinion that the most fundamental
point of this report is that Nu Skin’s management
used the promise of conducting the direct sales
model to gain the permission of Chinese authorities
to grant it business licensing, then pulled a classic
bait-and-switch maneuver, and is actually
implementing a pyramid sales scheme on a grand
scale.


   What Nu Skin Actually Does: 
Pyramid Selling
 


 


http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/ropops432/
[http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/ropops432/]


Citron believes Article 2 of the Chinese Pyramid
Sales law is utterly clear in stating its intent and it is
unambiguously strict in its implementation:


 


“The term "pyramid selling" as mentioned in this
Regulation refers to such an act whereby an organizer
or operator seeks for unlawful interests, disturbs the
economic order and affects the social stability by
recruiting persons, calculating and paying
remunerations to recruiters on the basis of the
number of persons a recruiter has directly or
indirectly recruited or the sales performance, or
asking the recruiters to pay a certain fee for
obtaining the qualification for participation.”


And lest you think that Hong Kong (where the
majority of Nu Skin's China revenue is being

reported) , look at the new Pyramid Schemes
Prohibition Ordinance, intended to close loopholes
in the former law and toughen penalties,  just put
into e�ect this year: 


http://www.deacons.com.hk/eng/knowledge/knowledge_45
[http://www.deacons.com.hk/eng/knowledge/knowledge_45


The question is simple:     Does Nu Skin operate an
MLM in China? 


   Yes Or No
It’s a simple question because the answer is just
“Yes” or “No”. 


Citron will now present evidence uncovered that
con�rms that Nu Skin is in fact operating as an
MLM — in multiple cities.  Citron associates
engaged some undercover “customers” who helped
us expose the truth. While Nu Skin is a registered
direct seller, we believe they violate laws regulating
direct selling, as well as the prohibition on pyramid
sales, speci�cally by supporting the creation of a
multi-level pyramid compensation scheme, as well
as requiring purchases in order to participate in
sales commissions or salary.  Over the course of
three weeks leading up to the company’s recently
held sales convention, a representative of Citron
met with numerous Nu Skin salespeople.  They
consistently presented a completely di�erent
compensation model than that is not written in any
of the company’s literature.  Thus the hand-drawn
sketches.


All of the conversations we are presenting have
been taped and uploaded to a dropbox
[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h09biic8izzulhq/et5SZUw_0L
.  The purpose of these is to validate the
translations of these interchanges posted with this
report. 


Evidence Point #1:   On June 19 a Citron researcher
met with sales representative Li Shanshan from Nu
Skin in Hefei (a city of 5.7 million population). 
Below is a synopsis of the meeting.  All highlighting
has been added by Citron to indicate content
demonstrating a blatant violation of direct selling

principles and the o�ering of a pyramid MLM
compensation scheme.  Even though this interview
is presented out of sequence, we start with this one
because the representative from Nu Skin actually
drew a pyramid to use in her explanation of Nu
Skin’s compensation scheme.

And more of the same from Shanghai:

content/uploads/2012/08/2012-06-18-
Conversation-with-NUS-O�ce-in-Shanghai-and-
NUS-Service-Hotline.pdf]


In none of these cities did we �nd a recruitment
conversation that re�ected the written operational
policies and procedures of the company.   Note that
both multi-level commissions and the requirement
to buy goods to participate in training (and thereby
commissions) are the main abuses of pyramid
schemes.


   Computer Systems Needed to
Implement an MLM
Compensation Scheme
 


Investors need to ask themselves:  Could a pyramid
compensation plan possibly be propagated without
the company’s knowledge and consent?


Think about it.  In a multi-level commission
structure, each invoice, each retail sale generates a
variable number of commission sharing
transactions, which have to be accumulated among
the credited sales person and all their “upstream”
counterparts.  Even a few thousand transactions
per month would create a nearly impossible
computational task without a central computer
system.  How could this compensation system
possibly function without the company’s
involvement at its core?


     The Story in the Numbers
There are very disturbing signs even though Nu
Skin’s revenues in China appear to be booming in
the past quarter.  First, roughly two-thirds of the
Greater China’s revenue comes from just 2 SKU’s.  
(This is likely why the CFO was reluctant to give the
sales-by-product to one analyst on the call.)  The

majority of those sales were made at the China
convention. 


Overconcentration of SKU’s on products
hyped at the Convention, related to recruiting


The most likely explanation is that the bulk of the
sales growth was concentrated around the
“business opportunity” and likely temporary. Is
buying a 30-day supply supplements at $160 per
month or a $300+ anti-aging skin treatment system
and trying to re-sell them
[http://s8.taobao.com/search?

in China a sustainable business?  These products
were heavily hyped at the convention.


Spike in Revenue-per-distributor ratio in
China, Implies Alarming Risk of Channel
Stuffing


This is a lot of product to re-sell and revenue was
probably borrowed from Q3.  Even more eye-
popping is the product purchases per avg.
executive at appx $13K — these sales leaders
account for the vast majority of the business done
in China.  The most important question on the call
was largely unanswered…:

track inventories, or where the product is
going…?”

Chasm Between Sales Leaders and
Distributors is Red Flag: 


Never in the past decade has there been such a big
di�erence between executive growth and overall
distributor growth.  While one could argue that this
is a bullish sign, it clearly goes against
management’s assertion that the vast majority of its
products are being purchased for consumption.
 The reality is that a surge in sales leaders
necessitates a surge in inventory purchases
[https://www.nuskin.com/content/nuskin/en_US/products/d
, such as “Business Builder packages”  ( 
https://www.nuskin.com/content/nuskin/en_US/products/d

) , along with recruiting-related purchases to obtain

Remember that a high percentage of products
purchased for purposes other than end user
consumption is a critical indicator of a pyramid
scheme in the FTC’s estimation.  MLM companies
somehow are always able to calculate their pyramid
commission payouts, but seem unable to ever track
how much of their product is actually being sold to
those outside the sales pyramid.


   Nu Skin’s Sales Driven by
Promises of Achieving Massive
Personal Wealth
 


The common themes of the above interviews are
consistent and pervasive:  The point of the
conversation is to induce the contact to join up to
become wealthy, by buying product to become a
trainee, and ultimately to become successful by
recruiting multiple levels of others whose sales will
result in 5% commission earnings per level.   These
are all the classic techniques of pyramid schemes.  


The Chinese internet is rife with examples of the
scheme in action.  There are numerous “fan sites”
and Weibos reinforcing the same theme of personal
wealth creation, rather than product features and
bene�ts.


Here is just one of many examples of some content
created by a rep on a “fan site”.  It’s becoming
apparent that they all post the same sort of
promotional material and quotes.  The image they
are trying to convey is you live this carefree lifestyle
and not have to go to “work” as a rep.  There is the
possibility of driving Ferrari’s and making millions
while helping people and realizing your true
potential.   This is a typical entry:

It states that the company claims one thing but
does another to the Chinese government and to the
sales reps.  From the blog, it seems that the sales
rep are required to buy $1500 of product and have
a $10,000 a month quota to avoid getting �red. 
Once you meet your quota, there are other hoops
to jump through to get the 15% small team bonus
and the “6th level” 5% bonus.   New Nu Skin recruits

   MLM Impact on Culture and
Cult-Like Behavior 
 


One of China’s concerns in outlawing pyramid
selling schemes is their tendency to create cult-like
behavior and the attendant harm to the basic social
fabric.  This goes against many of the basic cultural
values of China.  It undermines family ties and close
friendships by encouraging recruits to regard their
family and friends as sales targets – little more than
prey.  It manipulates economic vulnerability and
emotional weakness to convince people to subvert
these values with the power of psychological
manipulation. 


Take a look at these videos of the recent Nu Skin
convention in Hong Kong and decide for yourself. 
The �rst is a speech given by Cai Si Gun on June 20,
2012 (he lives in mainland China) :

stage looked like ants because I sat so far
away from the stage.  At that time I
wondered, when can I be on the stage
making speeches?  So today, I want to thank
Nu Skin for making my dream come true. 
Because I think Nu Skin can help all people
improve their life.  Many people ask me, why
did I want to join Nu Skin? The answer is
simple.  It is because I love my wife.  Do you
think a good husband should be successful?


Everyday my wife would come home around
10pm.  She worked late because she was a
�nance manager.  We had just gotten
married, so you know I wasn’t happy about
that. On top of that, every day when she got
home, she would complain about having too
much stress.  So I began to think of
something for my wife to do.  At this time, a
couple approached me and told me about
Nu Skin.  Without thinking too much I told
them I wanted to join.  I know only a few
people like me.  I gave my wife Nu Skin as a
gift.  It was really working, she liked it so
much.  She wanted to join Nu Skin and she
wanted me to join with her.  Back then, my
hobby was playing cards.  I spent a lot of
time playing cards because I didn’t have a
dream, I felt empty.   My Nu Skin trainer’s
name was Wangyi, he gave me the idea that
nothing is more important than how much
money you have.  He said I should focus on
something where I can teach someone else
to make money by working for me.  Nu Skin
is all about appreciating your predecessors
because they help make your successful. 
They taught me how to catch an opportunity
and how to overcome obstacles.  For
example, one manager asks two employees
to investigate the market for shoes in
Africa.   The �rst employee told the manager
Africa didn’t have a good market for shoes
because Africans don’t wear shoes.  But the
second employee told the manager the
market for shoes in Africa is very good
because there are not a lot of shoes being
worn there.  This example just goes to show

you everyone sees the world di�erently.  You
cannot change the world, but you can
change your mind.  Don’t scare yourself; you
should try to do something.  If you never try
something then you will never know the
answer.  Like now, I did it and I succeeded. 
Now I ask my friend to join Nu Skin, not only
because it’s my job, but I also want to help
them be successful, beautiful and healthy.  If
you join Nu Skin, the challenge is how to
control your emotion.  It’s very easy for me
because I think in a positive way, which helps
me accomplish things others think are
impossible.  The more people you introduce
Nu Skin to, the more people who will see the
potential upside. Thank you. "


 


The reality is that the vast majority of recruits to
pyramid schemes lose the money they are induced
to pay for inventory in overpriced products they can
never legitimately sell for consumption.


But the consequences are far worse.  Pyramid
scheme MLM's are an invitation to cult behaviors,
which predictably devolve to a variety of techniques
bordering on brainwashing to convince their
recruits that: 
 


it is a cause for celebration to yearn
for wealth regardless of the
consequences
any failure is the recruit’s own fault
and responsibility, based only on
their own lack of motivation to be rich
and successful
they should pervert relationships with
their own families and friends by
treating all of them as marks for sales
and recruitment


   Consequences of Violating the
Law Prohibiting Pyramid
Selling

(See in particular Articles 14, 17, 18, and 19 from
the law linked above.)


 


China’s laws are unambiguous and harsh with
regard to pyramid sales.  Citron suggests that all Nu
Skin investors consider the powers granted to the
regulatory body responsible for this prohibition, the
Department of Industry and Commerce
Administration.  These include:


Ordering cessation of violating
activities
Investigation of anyone involved
Carrying out on-the-spot inspections
by entering into the business, training
gathering places, etc.
Copying, sealing, or seizing relevant
contracts and records
Sealing up business places suspected
of being involved in pyramid selling
Applying to the court to freeze
unlawfully transferred or concealed
funds


… and that is just during the investigation phase. 


[The implementation of seal-up or seizure or any
measure prescribed in the above actions (seal-up or
seizure) requires written approval of the principal
leader of the Department of Industry and
Commerce Administration at or above the county
level, in advance.]


There’s also a “shoot �rst, and ask questions later
component (Article 17):


“Where it is in an inconvenient area or the
investigation and handling of the case will be
a�ected if the seal-up or seizure is not timely
carried out,the seal-up or seizure may be
carried out in advance and the decision on
seal-up or seizure shall be made up within

24 hours and be delivered to the parties
involved.”


And the Department also has the right to
promulgate a warning or a notice to remind the
general public.


   Political Conditions in China
Citron notes that China is in the midst of a carefully
planned 10-year governmental power transition. 
The theme of intolerance of corruption is
particularly strong at these transition points, and
the government has been responding in numerous
ways to this social concern.  Citron wonders
whether the incoming government will be as lenient
as the outgoing, in terms of allowing this massive
pyramid scheme to grow under its watch. 


   Conclusion
Nu Skin investors are exposed to the massive risk
of its China operations coming to an abrupt halt
due to violation of the PRC’s and Hong Kong
pyramid sales laws.  The consequences would be
devastating.  What would the company be worth
without its China operation? 


Citron challenges the investment banking
community to the following exercise.  Which of the
8 �rms providing coverage would be willing to
review all the evidence of Nu Skin's illegal
operations in China objectively, and redraw their
models to:


remove all income from China from
Nu Skin's P&L
write down the assets for capital
spent in China to the business net of
multi-level sales (which would be near
zero)


e.g. How many customers would
walk into a Nu Skin store and
walk out with a retail purchase? 
Would there even be any "Nu
Skin stores"?

Hong Kong, which would violate Chinese tax and
import laws, may be the subject of future coverage.
