Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB
Mar. 4, 2015 11:00 AM ET286 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Lumber Liquidators released a statement following the 60 Minutes report on Sunday,
claiming that its laminated wood testing protocols are correct.


In fact, I, 60 Minutes and others used the correct CARB testing protocols.


Anderson Cooper: Do you have any idea how much of this wood is in people's
homes right now?


Richard Drury: We believe there are probably tens of thousands of households in
California that have installed Lumber Liquidators Chinese laminates that may
exceed formaldehyde standards


Anderson Cooper: Nationwide?


Richard Drury: Nationwide, its probably hundreds of thousands.


Drury and Larson bought more than 150 boxes of laminate flooring at stores around
California and sent them to three certified labs for a series of tests. The results?
While laminate flooring from Home Depot and Lowes had acceptable levels of
formaldehyde, as did Lumber Liquidators American-made laminates, every single
sample of Chinese-made laminate flooring from Lumber Liquidators failed to meet
California formaldehyde emissions standards. Many by a large margin.


Richard Drury: The average level in Lumber Liquidators products that we found was
over six to seven times above the state standard for formaldehyde. And we found
some that were close to 20 times above the level that's allowed to be sold. “60
Minutes” March 1, 2015


Following the 60 Minutes segment quoted above, Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) released
a statement that says, in part: “We believe that 60 Minutes used an improper test method
in its reporting that is not included in CARB's regulations and does not measure a product
according to how it is actually used.”


This is nonsense.

In fact, I, 60 Minutes and others used the correct CARB testing protocols, and it’s LL that’s
using its own made-up tests. It’s a complex story, but briefly, the generally accepted and
used test is to sand off the outer layer of the laminate and then test it. This allows for an
accurate reading of the formaldehyde that’s embedded in the product. LL, in contrast,
tests the laminate without sanding it, which is, in fact, how the product “is actually used.”
But:


a) CARB, scientists, etc. all do it the other way; they could do it LL’s way, but then
they’d set a much lower exposure/detection threshold – pick your poison (pun
intended) but it’s incumbent upon LL to do the tests the way the regulators do or the
results are meaningless (as are the claims LL makes that their products are all CARB
2 compliant, blah, blah, blah; in short, you can’t do the tests a different way than CARB
– which minimizes the amount of formaldehyde detected – and then proclaim that your
flooring complies with CARB standards); and
b) just because the formaldehyde is somewhat “sealed” into the laminated wood by the
outer layer doesn’t mean LL’s customers aren’t being poisoned – it just means that the
formaldehyde leaks out slowly over a long time, along the edges, as the floor wears,
etc.


Finally, here are some spot-on insights from friend who manufactured and imported
luggage from China for many decades:

Subject: You on TV


Whitney,


I watched the 60 minutes piece. Congrats.


Having done business in China for literally decades, what I found most amazing in
the piece is the LL CEO's statement that they trust their manufacturers. If that is true,
then the company is guilty of incredible naivete or incompetence.


I have negotiated with factories in China. What happens is that the American buyers
drive a hard bargain.....and with multiple factories, as LL has, the factories know that
they are in competition with one another. A negotiation always comes down to
pennies. It is pretty common for the Chinese factory to do what they have to do to
keep the business.....ie, agree to the best price they can get from the buyer, but
agree nevertheless. And then, once they have the business, they try to figure out
how to make money on it.


But a reasonably savvy buyer knows that, and has approved samples against which
actual production is compared. If the actual production does not match the approved
sample, then the production is rejected. We did that with just about every production
run. If LL didn't do that, then they deserve whatever flak they catch....not because
they are deceitful necessarily, but just because they are incompetent.


Of course, if they knew about it, and were complicit either by looking the other way
or somehow condoning it, then that is a different story. Either way, however, the
company is guilty. And the State of California goes after the seller, not the supplier.
So a company like Home Depot, for example, will have a standard clause in their
contracts whereby the vendor indemnifies Home Depot against any action that may
arise from a product that they sell, made by the vendor.


But a vertically integrated operation like LL, where they are both the retailer and the
supplier, has no place to hide if the California DOJ comes a'callin'.


Even with our best inspections, our best efforts to compare product against the
approved samples, from time to time, there would be quality problems. We had our
standard purchase agreement which we executed with each factory that supplied us,
5/23/2018 Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972606-why-lumber-liquidators-wood-testing-doesnt-comply-with-carb 4/80


which allowed us to deduct from future payments to them, whatever quality charge-
backs we received from our customers. That is unbelievably punative. Here's why:


Suppose a product was sold to us FOB China for $10. By the time it landed in the
US, freight and duty etc included, it cost us $13.20. We would then sell it to the
retailer for $20 (which would net us about $18 after advertising deductions etc.) And
they would sell it for $40. If the consumer returned the product, the store refunded
the consumer the $40 she paid. And charged that $40 back to us. We in turn
charged the factory $40 for one defective product they had originally sold to us for
$10.


The point is that, knowing they stood to risk a 4:1 expense if the quality was poor,
was the best quality control tool we had. The factories ultimately found it was much
less expensive to give us the correct quality and make a smaller profit, than to cut
corners and risk a 4:1 expense. In other words, they way you get quality control out
of China is to make it in their economic interest to do what you want them to do.


Now I didn't learn this in business school. It is common sense. If LL doesn't have
common sense, then they deserve to lose. As simple as that.


Anyway, I enjoyed watching you on TV.


I am in awe of the investigative journalism 60 Minutes did, which validated my decision to
bring the story to them. They uncovered many things I didn’t know and I am now even
more convinced that this stock is a zero, for reasons I outline below.


As for LL challenging the test results, I can’t figure out if they are evil liars, trying to cover
up the fact that they’re knowingly poisoning their own customers to save a few bucks on
sourcing costs, or whether they’re just incompetent – but it’s one or the other. Based on
my research and analysis, I believe that LL’s testing regimen is largely a sham because
it’s disconnected from rigorous, credible tests that others (regulators, Home Depot,
Lowe’s, etc.) use and rely on. Evidence for this are the results from five independent sets
of tests, including one I commissioned, which show that LL is buying and selling to its
customers highly toxic laminated wood (virtually all of it from China).


Once it becomes clear that LL is, in fact, doing this, they will undoubtedly go on an
apology tour, saying how sorry they are and positioning themselves as the victims who
were defrauded by unscrupulous Chinese mills. This is complete nonsense. Laminated
wood is a low-end, global commodity product in which 1% or 2% differences in pricing are
meaningful. For a savvy player like LL, which has been buying in China for roughly two

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972606-why-lumber-liquidators-wood-testing-doesnt-comply-with-carb 5/80


decades, they would instantly know that if they were buying 10% below the standard price
for a particular piece of laminated wood that something was wrong: perhaps it was stolen,
used illegal or incorrect wood, was of exceptionally low quality, or was filled with toxic
chemicals.


Maybe this example will resonate. Let’s say you’re in Shanghai and looking to buy the
DVD of the latest Hollywood movie – let’s say, Academy Award winner Birdman, which is
still in theaters, so it’s of course not yet out on DVD. Ah, but lo and behold, as you walk
down the street, you see that a street vendor has a copy and sells it to you for $2.
Moments later, the police apprehend you and accuse you of buying illegal /forged
merchandise. You would of course claim that you had no idea – but OF COURSE you
knew, based on where you were (China) and the price you paid.


Similarly, LL had to have known there was something seriously wrong with the laminated
wood it was buying, given the absurdly low price and the fact that it was coming from
China, which is the wild west when it comes to environmental standards and rule of law.
Even if the Chinese mills said they were CARB 2 compliant and even if they were
supposedly inspected, this cannot be relied on. Heck, this is a country that sold us
defective wallboard that soon because filled with toxic mold, and which pumped pigs full of
clenbuterol (see: www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2011/April/19041102.asp). In short,
many Chinese companies, especially those in highly competitive, commoditized
industries, scoff at most regulations, especially if the product is being shipped to the US.
Many friends have told me that China is for the Chinese; if they can screw Americans,
they will – and they did with LL, which might take down company.


But LL’s pleas that they are the victim here ring hollow once you realize that the two
biggest buyers of wood flooring in the US, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s
(NYSE:LOW), also buy laminated wood in China, yet don’t have a formaldehyde problem
(to the best of my knowledge). The reason is simple: they have serious, rigorous
compliance programs and understand that you can’t hit the low bid in China and expect to
get high-quality, compliant product. So they pay more and get good flooring – but earn
lower margins, something LL wasn’t willing to do in its pell mell pursuit (regardless of the
consequences) of a higher and higher stock price so insiders could cash out.


The three funds I manage are currently short 44,676 shares of LL (a $2.3 million position
based on Friday’s closing price), making it a 2.6% position (it was well over 3% before the
stock got whacked last week).

I first shorted it on 10/9/13 at $102.69. My last trade was shorting more on 10/6/14 at
$56.06.


I have never bought or sold options on LL – I have only shorted the common stock.


If you’re wondering why I didn’t short a lot more recently, when I knew the 60 Minutes
story was going to air and would likely be very negative, the answers are:


1. It might have been illegal for me to do so (the laws around insider trading are very
vague, so it’s best not to be anywhere in the gray area);


2. Even if I’d gotten a clean legal opinion, I wouldn’t be comfortable with the optics/ethics
(I try to live my life keeping in mind the front-page-of-the-NYT/WSJ test); and


3. I promised 60 Minutes, once I brought the story to them, that I wouldn’t trade the stock
until after the story aired (or they told me they decided not to do it).


Although the risks are less than they once were, I know from long, hard experience that if
you’re a short seller and go after a company publicly, as I’ve done in this case, you should
expect to be sued by the company and/or investigated by the SEC or other regulators, so I
wanted to make sure there were no questions about my trading. Thus, once I got the
results from the tests I commissioned on three samples of LL’s laminated wood (and the
formaldehyde levels were very high), which confirmed to me that I had the story right (that
LL was poisoning its own customers and knew – or should have known – this fact), I
established my full (~3%) short position, gave all the information I had to 60 Minutes, and
let them run with it.

Nothing like a good company crisis to drive shares down to near bargain territory. I find that by the time I hear of a
company crisis like this and look up the stock, the thing has already bottomed and is heading back up, or is going
sideways.

The company has decent fundamentals. Great balance sheet. Almost as cheap as 2011 P/E and getting there P/B.


The company pays no dividends so it is off my radar... unless it goes to the $20 range in which case I will have to pull
out my fine tooth comb.

Great balance sheet you say? Check again- they have $20 million in cash- think that's enough to weather this

Not a good balance sheet and a high PE with lower sales coming. I wish I shorted this puppy. But just

If you think a company crisis like this will be over any time soon, you'd be sorely mistaken. I don't believe

You'd better look at that balance sheet again Doesn't it bother you that they have a half year's worth of
inventory on hand? Are you sure all that inventory is salable because nobody would voluntarily have a 180
day supply of inventory


04 Mar 2015, 09:37 PM


Zhang Fei
They had $1b in sales and about $300m in inventory. It's a little high, but not 180 days' worth. There are no
publicly-traded pure play flooring retailers of comparable size with which to compare their balance sheet,
although it's not clear why inventory is this high. Maybe a wide product selection is their stock in trade, their
way of differentiating themselves from the competition.

By great I mean no debt. Your points about cash amount and FCF are good.


Pulling out the fine tooth comb what do we get?


Current Ratio: 2.48 (great) 
Quick Ratio: 0.14 (lousy) 
Debt/Equity: none (great) 
No Debt (great)


Strictly regarding the balance sheet, having no debt is the best sign. Then we can talk about how much cash
they have.

Well they said the same thing about BP with the Gulf oil spill, and BP did fine. However, the specter of

Wow. Still no response to how the company will pay off (potentially) 100's of million in fines and removing

BP had BILLIONS in cash to pay their enormous fines. LL has 20 million! You can't honestly try and compare
the two co's. Scary to see the rationale behind investments...


05 Mar 2015, 01:07 AM


Cornelius Chan
Sam, you are raving as if I had recommended a buy order for LL at today's price. What I said was, I would
start looking more closely at $20. In my experienced with following publicly traded company crises, the lower
the share price goes the more relative the controversy, meaning there reaches a point where the controversy
is balanced by the cheapness. There is such a thing as cheap enough or beaten down enough.


Whether LL is cheap enough at book or half book or quarter book remains to be seen. That is investing.


05 Mar 2015, 01:23 AM


Cornelius Chan
With all due respect G2Portfolio, I mentioned nothing about the company crisis being over soon. I was merely
adding some financial info to the discussion.


The fact that I hear talk of impending bankruptcy brings me some hope that the stock may plummet into
highly undervalued and oversold territory. Which for small fry investor such as myself is some of the only
chance I get to make money from Wall Street.

At year end they had $165MM in Q4 COGS and inventory of $314MM. That's right about 2 quarters worth of
sales or that 180 days. Just below it. Worse yet, inventory expanded wildly in the quarter from $250MM to
$314MM.


Nobody intentionally wants this much inventory. It must be involuntary and therefore a writedown is quite
possible. It can't be sold, it might be junk

They have plenty of inventory, maybe they can pay the fines in flooring!!

"Nobody intentionally wants this much inventory."


They have a very wide selection of flooring materials in various colors and finishes. Only a very small
percentage of it is the laminate flooring with the formaldehyde problem.

They carry other brands of laminate flooring that are not affect by the problem, in addition to their main
product lines of wood and engineered wood flooring--both of which are different than laminate flooring.

The number of people who buy laminate flooring (compared to solid wood or engineered wood planks) is
relatively small. LL also sells laminate flooring from manufacturers that don't have a formaldehyde problem
(such as Pergo).


Remember that laminate flooring is composite material with a thin top layer of plastic (sort of like laminate
counter tops).

Whether Lumber Liquidators is completely put out of business, is yet to remain. LL shares are most likely
going to go lower and stay down for a long time to come. It is definitely not a buy.

I have been on to this story months ago, and had no knowledge initially that the floorboards I got were made
in China, the situation with Lumber Liquidators and the current lawsuits going on against LL.


The claims that the lawsuits are making are legitimate and people are being affected by the high
formaldehyde levels.


Whether people are adversely affected by the formaldehyde levels depends upon many factors. The quantity
of flooring in a home or office, the ventilation rate, the amount of time spent near the flooring, the age of the
flooring, the formaldehyde content within the boards, and the person themselves.

replacing flooring that is more expensive than what you originally sold. You're also talking about a lot of labor
costs, compensation for disrupting people's lives, punitive damages, etc.


On top of that, who is going to go into Lumber Liquidators tomorrow and buy wood flooring? Someone who
lives under a rock? The damage to their reputation is probably the most important aspect of all of this.


I have no position because I don't short stocks, but it's difficult for me to see how the company will recover

Even Tilson does not allege that LL is out of compliance with Federal standards. It's CA standards that are at
issue. Note also that no one has verified independently that Tilson's allegations are in fact true. 60 Minutes
has signed on for the ride, but this is the same 60 Minutes that was duped by fake documents just about
anyone should have detected during the George W Bush Air National Guard imbroglio. On something this
technical, who knows if 60 Minutes has its ducks in a row?

Wisdom's Reward, Contributor
Regulatory compliance standards aren't all that matter in a civil suit. If the company sold products that a court
finds to be dangerous, they will be liable for replacing those products (not to mention any claims of cancer
that may arise from people who lived in homes where their flooring was present). Asbestos was not illegal
when it was being sold all over the U.S., but the companies that sold it were still liable for damages arising
from it.


I agree that nothing has been proven yet, definitely not in a court of law. I'm simply giving my own subjective
judgment about what appears to be true. It's worth noting that "innocent until proven guilty" is a legal standard
- not something I am bound by when giving opinions or making investment decisions. If Lumber Liquidators
could refute the findings, it seems to me they would have done it already. Instead, they seem to be bumbling
around to make excuses for themselves, place blame elsewhere, etc. I'm always more convinced by a lack of
cogent refutation than I am by an allegation alone.


Edit: Not to mention the fact that they appear to have labeled all their products as being CARB 2 compliant -
even the ones sold outside of CA. Even if they weren't required by law to be compliant with CARB 2 outside
of CA, that is still a false claim the company made about the safety of its products (again, assuming the short
case is accurate).

Getting formaldehyde banned might be a bigger project than Tilson and 60 Minutes can accomplish, given its
application in any number of day-to-day products.


As to whether management's response is an indicator of guilt, the fact is that an inquisitor's power to
question, and to hog the megaphone via media outlets hungry for scandal, puts companies on the defensive,
and management's response will necessarily not be in the form of rapid and witty one-liners, because of the
potential financial consequences of saying the wrong thing*. If they can't find anything wrong with the product,
among other things, they will be investigating whether Tilson and his accomplices committed fraud, figuring
that a minnow like Lumber Liquidators would have gone under before anything managed to discover
irregularities in their so-called investigation. That is possibly why Tilson & Co went after LL instead of Home
Depot, which might have put them through a meat grinder of investigations and libel suits, to the point that
Tilson might beat the rap, but not the ride, to tune of tens of millions in legal expenditures.


* Massive corporations like Apple and Microsoft have looked like deer-in-the-headlights after allegations of
product problems cropped up, yet in time, they managed to separate hysteria from any actual problems. The
fact is that *nobody* is prepared for outrageous accusations except for the obviously guilty.


04 Mar 2015, 06:12 PM


Wisdom's Reward, Contributor
I never said anything about getting formaldehyde banned. That's a straw man and doesn't deserve a
response.


To your other points, there are several problems with your reasoning. First, I'm not speaking only about the
CEO's communication skills during the 60 minutes interview. I'm talking about the fact that these allegations
have been around for years, that the company has known about them for years, and that they almost certainly
knew 60 minutes wasn't doing a report on their company for any positive reason. I am more inclined to
believe that if they were innocent, they would have had a solid refutation prepared in advance (this was their
big chance to prove their innocence to the watching world)... whereas you seem to believe that the fact they
don't have a good refutation proves their innocence. That's some pretty twisted logic in my view, but to each
his own.


Second, the company has now issued an official response via an SEC filing, which was addressed by the
article on which we are commenting. I find their response to be highly questionable. This article and another
article on SA does a pretty good job of refuting the company's response, in my view. I'm not going to restate
their arguments in the comment section.


Last, your conclusion that "Tilson didn't go after Home Depot" because he is actually the one committing fraud
is a huge stretch, quite frankly. The more logical explanation is that he didn't go after them because their
products are safe.


It seems to me that you're throwing up any excuse or reason you can possibly fathom to believe LL and
disbelieve the short sellers. It's fine with me if you want to do that. If you really believe in the arguments you
are making here, then by all means, buy the stock. Maybe you will turn out to be right. Personally, I am
staying away, and if I owned it, I would sell and never look back. Best wishes!

"First, I'm not speaking only about the CEO's communication skills during the 60 minutes interview."


A show can be edited to make the interviewee look like a moron or the devil incarnate. NBC edited George
Zimmerman's 911 call to make him look like a racist, after which it fired the producer and issued an apology.
Its mistake was merely going too far.


http://wapo.st/1wIFVCb


If poor communication skills were an indication of guilt, prosecutors would probably be indicting and
convicting a heck of a lot more people than they are currently processing.


The idea that it makes sense to go after LL based on fraudulent allegations is eminently logical. If you're
going to whale on a target under false pretenses, it is wiser to pick on a minnow rather than a giant that is
almost 2 orders of magnitude larger. The mob doesn't send its leg-breakers after Waste Management, Inc in
competition for garbage collection contracts - it goes after markets where the competition is Joe Schmo,
who's got a fleet of 10 garbage trucks, and unlike Waste Management, doesn't have a veritable army of gun-
toting security people backing up its employees.

Wisdom's Reward, Contributor
Zhang, your responses are mind boggling to me. I was saying that his communication skills weren't an
important issue, and you responded by making an argument that communication skills can be made to look
poor via editing - which you then use as an argument to claim lack of proof for his guilt, even after I have
already explained that strict legal proof is not at all necessary for making investment decisions. Again, you
have boggled my mind, good man. Therefore, I concede defeat at whatever this contest was. Best wishes to
you!

"Zhang, your responses are mind boggling to me."


It boggles your mind that someone might shade the truth or even commit fraud for fame and money, in hopes
that his target might unravel before the unvarnished truth emerges? Not everyone's as ethical as he ought to
be.


Whether Tilson's on the up-and-up or not, kudos to him. Regardless of the truth of his allegations, LL may not
survive the firestorm that follows. LL's disintegration should make Tilson a bundle, and then some.

Made in China flooring products will most likely no longer be sold at LL and possibly at many other stores.
Who will trust buying Flooring made in China after 60 minutes program. Not even if it's at Home Depot.


I bet there will now be some very amazing and extraordinary sale prices at LL much lower than you can find
anywhere else. Who would pass up a bargain stating "It's American Made Flooring.


What will all the other companies who sell flooring from China do with their product. I think the cost of
American made Flooring just went up.

First of all, only laminate flooring (with a composite substrate and plastic top layer with a "picture" of wood)
has the problem. Solid wood flooring, and engineered wood flooring have not been implicated. The majority of
plank flooring sold for residential use is solid wood or engineered wood flooring, not laminate.


Secondly, there are several brands of laminate flooring sold at LL, including Pergo, which is also sold in HD
and Lowe's, that does not have the excess formaldehyde problem. Apparently, only the LL house brand has
the problem.


Most likely, all laminate wood flooring sold in the US is made in China, as well as engineered wood flooring. I
have seen some Armstrong engineered wood flooring that said made in China on the box (but engineered
wood flooring has not been implicated so far in regard to excess formaldehyde). I don't know much about
where solid wood flooring is made, but I would not be surprised if it is made in China also, especially if it is
pre-finished.

It's nice to see you back in the spotlight. I enjoyed watching (no position) the Lumber Liquidators saga from the
beginning to now. For US firms doing business in China, the risks are so obvious and so known, such that there is no
such thing as really actual deniability. There's only willful ignorance. Not to say that similar (or far worse things) don't
happen in companies much more known and with far bigger market caps than a mere Lumber Liquidators. In my
experience, high margins coupled with growth seem to make questions from US or European headquarters go away
fast.

04 Mar 2015, 11:33 AM


minethegap
I've seen remarks from an industry expert that indicated: if a manufacturer uses more formadehyde in the
glues, it allows them to run more flooring through the mill machinery faster, therefore they can make more
flooring for less money and charge less for it, thus bagging more sales from buyers who don't have high
specifications for what they want.

There is a definite xenophobic tilt against China to all these researchers like Tilson who are doing the Sherlock
Holmes type research to prove their theses. What irks me is that somehow these "wonderful Americans" are actively
using the "Made in China is bad", not realizing that China has it's own controls! It is not as wild wild West as these
self-serving analyses seem to suggest.


Most of the stuff you buy in Home Depot and Lowe's and Walmart and Sears and everywhere...is made in China.
Don't dump on a large, rich country (China) and let your xenophobia make decisions for you. If they were Swedish
suppliers I am quite sure you would be kissing Scandinavian delight ass.


1. Did Tilson do his testing from Hardwood brought in other stores, which is often made in China too? This is called
calibration..any Engineering job starts with calibration samples.


2. Did he check that these manufacturers in China are exclusive suppliers to LL-that the same hardwood is getting to
America and other countries via other suppliers like Home Depot and Lowes? I don't see that...I doubt that these
manufacturers are exclusive-they are selling stuff to hundreds of other retailers worldwide, I am sure..and there I trust
more the Chinese Government's regulations than California or whatever.


Tilson is a stupid version of Sherlock Holmes it seems...?


Most stuff sold in all stores is Chinese...and I am grateful to that country and it's manufacturers for making everything
so cheap and nice! I live in Chile and the biggest chains are all selling stuff brought over from China, and Walmart and
Lowes and Home Depot and Apple and HP and Compaq and General Motors and Ford and General Electric ....use
Chinese supplies and parts....let's NOT forget that.

Sanjay this article and author are about as honest and forthright as we are going to get. He explains the

The thing is you have to except that China has a track record of poor oversight or loose standards in
manufacturing. Lead in their own baby formula would be one of the worst. Lead in paint on children toy's. My
own experience with chinese products has been that any product that has come out of a mold or contains
pieces that came out of a mold typically will still have the release agent used in manufacturing on the product.
Some to such an extant that you can smell it thru the packaging. These are typically a petroleum based
product containing toluene and other nasties. I have discovered this on things like flashlights, small hand tools
and yes even cheap toys I thought I would buy for my kid....until I get my nose near them.

It is unfortunate that China gets a bad rap but it is what they themselves set in motion by embracing
capitalism and the race to the bottom of manufacturing costs. Not all products exported from China are
tainted or toxic, but there are many which are. The cheaper the price tag the more likely my nose tells me not
to touch it.


These people are not out to bash China. They are slamming down LL for being incompetent. Chinese
manufacturers are the one who made the product. Nothing is going to change that.

Sanjay-Did you even watch the segment or are you just clueless? 1. Samples from other LL stores across the
country and from competitors (HD and Lowe's) were tested and "calibrated", as you say, and the conclusion
remains the same. 2. The Chinese manufacturers were vindicated, in a way. They admit that LL knows the
product isn't CARB2 compliant and buy it anyways. LL is trying to save a buck by cheating (and then lying
about it).

LOL I am not Anti-American lived in that wonderful country for years and still maintain a very strong
connection to it..and would love to live in the wonderful country of China too! All I am saying is that China is a
manufacturing powerhouse-and to treat a country of 1.4 billion people with disdain is to be a bit xenophobic.


I have heard this everywhere in the West that China is bad quality-noone talks about the costs. Japan was
called the same in the 1970s and they basically are the top car manufacturers of the world now.


The natural fear of foreigners is played upon all the time by these people to make money...I have lived in 15
countries and do not consider myself to belong to any particular country or culture!


But to repeat-I am not Anti-American; but I can see how some foolish americans (and most are not!) play on
their brethrens fear of foreign things to make money (ruining other Americans, who bring them cheap things
from abroad (LL), taking subusantial capital risk in the process). It is easy to write analyses and analyse

Don't people remember the formaldehyde debacle with the FEMA trailers manufactured for the victims of Hurricane
Katrina? FEMA provided housing in the form of trailers to victims, but people using the trailers began getting sick. It
turned out that the trailers were emitting huge amounts of Formaldehyde. Never mind the cancer unknowns.. people
were getting sick, period.


In anycase, this isn't something people forget easily. L.L. has a real uphill battle, nobody is going to trust their
products now (and rightly so).


Formaldehyde is a naturally occurring substance, and it is used heavily in industry, but like most things it is toxic in
high concentrations. Industry uses formaldehyde all over the place, it has many uses in glues and other things
(particularly particle boards... any pressed wood product). On the bright side because it is something we are exposed
to naturally every day, industrial use is safe as long as emissions are low enough. For industries, this can be as
simple as letting the product air out before the final lamination or sealing pass. Or it can be more complex.


Once a product is sealed, airing out is no longer possible (or it would take many weeks or months or even years to
reach safe levels). The formaldehyde will outgas through the seal slowly and if the product is placed in an enclosed
space like a trailer (more obviously) or a home the result can be seriously unsafe levels in the home that basically do
not dissipate over time because the outgassing continues to occur at a relatively consistent rate.


So it kinda sounds to me like L.L. has screwed themselves.

Robert 7809591
This is not a small enclosed brand new trailer we are talking about. The trailer manufacturers even in their
sales brochures said to let the trailer air out with the windows open before use. The trailers were not made for
what FEMA used them for so the example is not valid in this case.

Is CARB (California Air Resources Board) the arbiter for formaldehyde & air pollution standards for the entire United

WallStreetDebunker: California is probably one of their biggest markets. Just as with car makers, because CA
is one of their biggest markets it's easier to manufacture all vehicles to the CA standard than it is otherwise.
And same goes with just about everything else. Not just construction materials, but also things like Wall Warts
(wall plugs for powering devices), Dishwashers, Refrigerators, school books, and the list goes on.


I wouldn't knock it. The entire U.S. benefits from this in a major way, not the least from the fact that every
inefficiency we let go through is more dollars sent overseas in buying energy.

"Richard Drury: We believe there are probably tens of thousands of households in California that have installed

country), and removed at great expense, and unapproved antibiotics in dog treats.

Thank you for the article.


I don't have and will not take a position in LL (long or short) and my interest lies simply in that I saw the 60 minutes
story waiting for the Larry David spot.


This article sheds much light on many of the seemingly contradictory sides and helps in understanding a story that I
seem to have been willfully dragged into.

Can anyone tell me which of the following 371 California stage agencies regulates mind pollution? (I'm worried that
this article might be poisoning my mind.)

Deja Vu, Contributor
The article doesn't state which of the two tests was applied by Mr. Tilson. Was it the scratch test, or the non scratch
finished surface test?


Did it pass the latter? Did it only fail the former?


California is notoriously strict in its environmental standards. Does the flooring pass tests in other states? Is the
liability limited to California only?


If the finished non scratched product is acceptable and passes muster, how much could have leaked out and what
levels of exposure are we talking about?

Everyone must look at the company's press release today. They announced they will be talking in a WEEK from now
while they CANCELLED their attendance at the Raymond James Investor Conference. Why would the company not
bang the tables to demonstrate their innocence?? They knowingly cancelled their attendance even though it would
signal guilt, which should tell you something.

now...? Is it still a short or stock is finding support at 36

One has to watch what is being produced by china. Laminate is a smaller part of LL offerings. If they are not lying
about not knowingly doing this, then it is just a matter of customer relations issue. Formaldehyde evaporates very
quickly once the package is opened. Cigarettes have more concentration of formaldehyde than the laminate wood will
ever have. Also a simple ventilation takes care of this very easily.  
Yes, they should not use it, but the solutions to mitigate it is very simple and all this has been blown out of proportion.
When the testing is done, take the wood out of the box, place it on a table in open air for 15-20 minute and then
perform the test. The levels will be below the required amounts. 
Some folks are taking advantage of people's fears and profiting greatly from misinformation.


This is like the same issue with had with Radon a few years back. Many folks lost their houses because of the fear
factor put into people when all they had to do was to provide a simple ventilation system that cost less than $1000.
Sounds like FTC is investigating the trades before the new today as it seems to scream insider trading even though
the news was nothing new. It is sad, but this wall street.

well said Ener..I have worked with Formaldehyde and I knew it was slightly toxic-but to worry about it in glue
etc. is a bit too much...it naturally evaporates and the problem takes care of itself in a few days at most, is
what I remember.


Tilson and Zhou are not Engineering types-these are Finance Sherlock Holmes who have probably never
held a real job in their life..that's why they keep doing childish experiments and get in bed with news channel
talking heads to prove their cases.


I don't have any position in LL...am just irritated by these short attacks on something which really they are not
qualified to opine on. They should sit home and analyze their charts and stocks....and leave the technical
aspects to people who do real work, and with their hard work and labor bring cheap things from abroad to
America.

"Many friends have told me that China is for the Chinese; if they can screw Americans, they will – and they did with
LL, which might take down company."


Tilson jumped the shark here. The big product scandals - ranging from melamine in milk to meat jerky cooked in
recycled cooking oil meant for biodiesel - have been in products sold to the Chinese market. The Chinese consumer
has a pittance to spend compared to his developed country counterparts. That is why melamine showed up in milk
there - pricing pressure. These companies aren't making lavish profits - they're skimping on quality to keep the lights
on. Chinese companies rely on the domestic market to pay fixed costs. The export market is where they make their
money, much as Detroit's Big 3 sell compact cars pretty much at cost, and SUV's to make money. That is why they
are extra careful with export products - it's their bread and butter and foreign countries don't have tame media to keep
scandals out of the headlines. The idea that Chinese suppliers band together to stick it to foreigners is so off-the-wall,
it brings into question Tilson's knowledge and insight.


While Tilson's thesis on LL should stand on its own regardless of any loopy ideas he might have, the fact is that we
(and 60 Minutes) are relying on Tilson's word for a lot of the thesis. 60 Minutes was led by its sources up a blind alley
during the George W Bush Air National Guard document imbroglio, where fake documents (in Times New Roman
font) generated on Windows-era computers were claimed to have been copies of type-written documents (which

should have been in the standard Courier font of all typewriters until the early 80's) created during the early 70's.
Bottom line is that 60 Minutes is vulnerable to fraud by even unsophisticated, but slick-talking individuals who had no
clue that Courier fonts were standard issue on typewriters until the typesetting revolution of the 80's. Tilson is
probably an order of magnitude brighter than the people who perpetrated the fake Bush documents. If he chose to, he
could do a better job of pulling the wool over the eyes of the producers of 60 Minutes.

Aristides Capital, Contributor
I am just a little bit dumbfounded at the suggestion of "fraud" on the part of someone who helped bring an
obviously real issue to light. LL's products failed 31 separate tests. Tilson didn't conduct those tests. Nor does
he have minions running around the country infiltrating lab testing organizations. We are talking about a
smallish hedge fund here whose largest positions are all on the long side. Full disclosure, I'm a
colleague/competitor of Whitney's (although I have no position in LL and have never had a position except for
a couple of days after Xuhua Zhou's piece came out in 2013), so I suppose I could be in on the "fraud" as
well, but really, can everyone please just take a step back and not vilify fund managers so much here? We do
not spend our days plotting ways to make the world a worse place.

Tilson is blatantly trying to manipulate LL price and is using 60 minutes to do the dirty work. Don't think for a
minute that all reporters are intelligent, educated, and fair (although I'm sure some are). Their job is to sell
airtime, not expose the truth.


If you don't believe me about how reporters aren't that intelligent, think back to 9/11 and try to recall how long
it took for the media to get someone on the air to state the obvious fact that the hijackers picked planes with
long flights so that they would have full fuel tanks. Granted, I'm an engineer, but, it took me about 3 seconds
to realize that fact as soon as they said where the planes destinations were.


As for this LL debacle, I started looking into it on the morning of the 15th and it took me about four hours to
wade through various articles and the CARB and National Cancer Institute websites and to determine that the
health risks aren't that high, that the testing performed was wrong, and to write a four page paper on the
subject. Certainly, both 60 minutes and Tilson had plenty of time and manpower to review this subject better
than I did, yet, they made mistakes that are unacceptable for a decent high schooler.

As I understand it, the tests were conducted by laboratories that are certified to perform CARB 2 testing, but,
the labs were not operated by CARB and the tests were not performed under CARB contract. Actually, I must
admit that I do not know if CARB has any of their own labs or if they farm-out their testing. The question is not
whether the labs correctly performed the tests they were contracted to perform, but, whether they were
contracted to perform the correct CARB tests for laminated flooring. The testing they performed was
"deconstructive testing" where the laminate material is sanded off the flooring prior to testing. This is not the
correct testing for finished laminated flooring and hence the results are meaningless.

It's ironic that Tilson is so fired up about LL for allegedly exposing Americans to toxic chemicals. A few years ago he
did media presentations promoting BP stock soon after the company's Macondo explosion killed 11 people and soiled
Gulf beaches with "poisons" and known carcinogens.

Crude Oil and natural gas are fungible commodities. BP can sell all their crude and natural gas even if
everyone hates them because they are selling to other countries or refineries owned by other oil companies,
and not to the public.


Also, many retail brands get their gasoline from local BP refineries (and add their propitiatory gasoline
additives) because that is just the way the refinery and retail system works in the US if there is a BP refinery
in that area.


The only public relations problems that BP encountered that affected their financials is retail sales of gas at
the pump, but most of their retail stores are not company owned. Also, since BP (formally known as British

"It’s a complex story, but briefly, the generally accepted and used test is to sand off the outer layer of the laminate and
then test it. "


I have no investment in LL and have no LL products in my home and have never even purchased any product at LL.
The above doesn't seem correct. This seems to be along the lines of a multi lawyer lawsuit the city of Milwaukee tried
to bring to court some years back concerning lead paint. In the city there were thousands of homes that had layers of
lead paint underneath newer layers of latex paint. The lawsuit wanted compensation for "victims" even though it was
shown that if a home was maintained and paint was not flaking off, the risk from lead was negligible. In fact tearing up
a house to try to get the paint out was MORE dangerous than just leaving it alone and maintaining the house. Is this
the same thing? It sounds like as long as the laminate is not damaged the risk is small. When I heard about this I
wondered if anyone had taken tests of air in homes where the wood product has been installed and what the finding
were. That's what should be tested.

i think he is referring to any real damage it may cause. If it is encapsulated, it is relatively safe just like
asbestos tiles.


You could simply use AFM Safecoat, a manufacturer of encapsulating sealers which stop vapor emissions
from porous wood, paint, polyurethane, and carpet. 
After three coats, for example, their Polyureseal BP stopped off-gassing of formaldehyde by 100%.

Robert 7809591
Keubiko - I also read the instructions on how to use the drum sander. What does that have to do with my
question?? Try again to answer. One of the defenses of the paint companies was that government mandated
the use of lead paint in public housing when the homes in question were painted with lead paint. You talk like
a mandate is from God's lips to our ears.

I must have misunderstood. You stated "the above doesn't seem correct" in referencing the "generally
accepted and used test is to sand off the outer layer and test it".


I was simply pointing out that the CARB 2 standards are very specific and call for this. You might be arguing
that CARB 2 is not the "generally accepted" standard. I would reply when you are shipping product clearly
labeled as CARB 2 compliant, it most certainly is.


You may be right that some kind of defense might be "sure we've been selling product for years that violates
California law, have mislabeled product as meeting the California emissions standards, but we promise, it's
safe".


IMHO from a stock perspective it is irrelevant:


1) The company does not have the resources to deal with this. Only $20 million in the bank.

3) If they can't sell this junk their profits will be much lower

That's ridiculous (oh mr tilson is that nice enough??). You don't have to be so sarcastic. Nobody sands
laminate. Do you?? I remembered an associate of mine is an environmental engineer so I called him. He said
the test was probably designed that way to be "easy" and to base standards assuming the people in the
environment had direct exposure. This may or may not be relevant to real life. He would like to know how
much gas is coming off the product WITH the laminate since that is your ACTUAL exposure and that is how
the product is used. He said you could have product with many more times the government standard, but
have a coating that seals it in and it would be safe. You could also have a product that is below the
government standard but have a porous surface and be exposed to more formaldehyde gas than the first
product. This is simply going to be another case where the lawyers make a lot of money, some shorts make
some money and the home owner maybe gets a coupon for a discount on their next purchase of flooring.
Lowes sold contaminated Chinese drywall and they didn't go out of business and their stock is way up since
2009 when the story broke. I assume LL will most likely be the same thing.

@User7809591, 
Well, whether one sands laminate or not...isn't the question...is it? 
Wait until the home inspectors get after this one and it will have to be remedied before a home sale can go

it)...it will be history in 15-24 months, but that's a guess.

Are you expecting a home inspector to sand the plastic surface off of an installed laminate floor to test it? I

Robert 7809591
IZZ - So how is this any different than the chinese drywall lowes sold??Well yes if the laminate used prevents
or mitigates formaldehyde exposure then it is a question I would have. As in my lead paint example, the
lawyers there wanted a standard of how much lead was underneath the latex paint and wanted to ignore that
the latex paint was making lead paint exposure a moot point. In my Chinese wallboard example, Loews paid
to have wallboard removed from just 300 homes. There was a 60 minutes episode on that too. Loews stock
does not seem to have suffered any long term negative effects and in hind site was actually a good buy when
it pulled back due to all the bad publicity five years ago. LL could be the same thing. A short now that its lost
half its value could be just as risky as going long at this point. Is tilson going to tell us when he covers?? No.

Read the CARB regulations before jumping on the wrong bandwagon. CARB specifies how to perform

but, deconstructive testing is not required by CARB for laminated flooring.

In Canada back in the 70's, the government and consumers spent billions remediating urea formaldehyde
insulation from buildings all over the country. The reason? Someone "hypothesized" that off-gassing might
cause negative health effects. Interestingly, after years of using the product prior to the remediation, not a
single person was ever found who got sick from UFE off gassing.


Using words like "poison" and similar propaganda-like descriptors serve only to whip up the general public
into a frenzy of fear, in this particular case so that ruthless shorts can line their own pockets. Real science
doesn't show up on the public's radar. Americans would rather take their cues from celebrities and hucksters
rather than listen and go to the effort to understand real science. I believe the phenomenon is referred to as
"the dumbing down of America".

Silver - that's what I am wondering too. What is the real risk. If you have to sand off the protective layer to get
to the chemical, what exactly is the point of the test?? Nobody sands laminate. Why don't they just test the
outside of the product to see how much gas is leaking through and base standards on that?? It sounds like
somebody in government did that, found out that the laminate keeps the product safe but then decided to
sand off the laminate because that's the only way to get to the formaldehyde.

The real risk is ZERO, and that is what REAL science will tell you. I'm in this business, and intimately familiar
with all the research. It is easier I guess for the idiots here to read message boards than to actually research
and understand the scientific studies that have been conducted over the decades regarding formaldehyde.


This is a classic case of unscrupulous people capitalizing on the irrational fear syndrome that currently grips
most of North America. I'll bet half the posters here are pack a day smokers too. What tripe. Oh well, this will
blow over in a few weeks when the media latches on to the next sensational headline huckster.

Well said Silverline17! The OSHA standards for exposure in manufacturing plants that use formaldehyde is
0.75 ppm while CARB Phase 2 requires a level of only 0.11 ppm (flooring thicker than 8 mm) or 0.13 ppm
(flooring that does not exceed 8 mm thickness). The OSHA standards used to be higher (3.0 ppm prior to
1987 and 1.0 ppm from 1987 to 1992). Formaldehyde exposure studies have not been definitive - some
studies suggest a link to cancer and others do not. It should be noted that the current OSHA standards are 6
to 7 ties as high as the allowable test levels for laminated mdf flooring. (note: according to OSHA, typical
levels within a home are around 0.03 ppm). Granted, one could assume that the work day is only 8 hours and

people might spend up to 16 hours a day at home (working adults anyway), so, perhaps the allowable home
levels should only be half of what is allowed in a factory.


On the other hand, the flooring test circulates the air in a test chamber until a stable, saturated reading is
achieved. At worst, in-home readings could reach that same level (right next to the flooring), but, in reality, the
levels will drop the further away you are from the flooring. In addition, most homes breathe somewhat which
will reduce the levels of formaldehyde and many homes with wood flooring do not have it in every room, so
levels will be lower in homes with a lower percentage of their flooring covered with laminated mdf flooring.


Furthermore, it seems likely that, if formaldehyde has adverse health effects, such effects would be related to
either a) the total amount of formaldehyde taken into the body or b) the daily amount taken in. So, one would
have to monitor the levels within the home over a long period of time because levels will drop as the flooring
ages and the concentration of formaldehyde drops. Additionally, concentrations would drop anytime one
opens a window or allows outside air to be circulated into the house.


In summary, there is no definitive proof that formaldehyde will have any health effects on people at the levels
to which they are typically exposed within a home and the levels in a home will be lower than the levels
recorded in the CARB phase 2 testing.

Based on the National Cancer Institute website information on formaldehyde:


Can formaldehyde cause cancer? It seems that the answer is maybe/probably: 
a) A number of cohort studies have been done involving workers exposed to formaldehyde. FYI, a cohort
study tracks people who are known to have been exposed to an environmental factor (such as formaldehyde
exposure) for a number of years and the study monitors to see if they experience higher than normal rates of
a disease (such a cancer). The results of these studies were somewhat mixed: 
i) One study, conducted by NCI, looked at 25,619 workers in industries with the potential for occupational
formaldehyde exposure and estimated each worker’s exposure to the chemical while at work (5). The results
showed an increased risk of death due to leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, among workers exposed to
formaldehyde. 
ii) (Another) cohort study of 11,039 textile workers performed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) also found an association between the duration of exposure to formaldehyde and
leukemia deaths (7). 
iii) (Another) cohort study of 14,014 British industry workers found no association between formaldehyde
exposure and leukemia deaths (8).

saw the Ed Snowdon story?


05 Mar 2015, 12:01 AM

My understanding of the flooring industry is that there are 3 different wood flooring products that are sometimes
intermingled, but are differerent:


1. Sold Wood Plank Flooring - Can be prefinished or unfinished (for site-finishing).


2. Engineered Wood Plank Flooring - Consists of a base made from multiple layers of wood (sort of like plywood) or
composite wood material, on the bottom of each plank, with a thin layer of real wood on top. The top layer of real
wood is usually about 1/16" or 1/8". The top layer of real wood is almost always pre-finished.


3. Laminate Flooring - Consists of one or more layers of composite material as the base of each plank, with a thin
plastic layer on top. The base material can be made from wood particles or other materials held together in a binder
or glue, including formaldehyde. The top layer of the flooring is a thin layer of plastic material that typically has an
"image" that only looks like wood (or can be some other pattern) but is not really wood and is not made of wood. The
plastic layer on top is typically more durable than even pre-finished wood flooring. Pergo is best know manufacturer of
laminate flooring.


I saw the 60-Minutes report and have heard others discuss this subject on various business news shows. No one that
I saw seems to make a distinction about the difference between the above types of flooring. One person above who
commented on this article hinted at the same distinction as I made, but everyone else seems to imply that all LL wood
plank flooring is affected.


My understanding is that only the LL branded "laminate" flooring has the formaldehyde problem, which makes sense
since laminate plank base layer typically has a composite material such as wood particles that are held together with
some kind of binder.


If what I said above is true, and the formaldehyde problem only applies to LL laminate flooring, I doubt that the impact
is as wide as some suggest. And not all brands of laminate flooring are affected (such as Pergo).


I would venture a guess that the overwhelming majority of wood-type flooring sold by LL is either real solid wood
planks or engineered wood flooring (the later is probably the most common because it is less suspectable to

shrinkage/expansion when the humidity changes). Laminate flooring with a plastic top surface is probably not their
biggest selling product in strip flooring (or any flooring).


If I am wrong about this, please correct me.


05 Mar 2015, 01:01 AM


DenaliOcean
You are correct in what you say. The types of floors that are affected, are not only laminates, but any type of
floor board that uses high density fiberboard made in these Chinese factories where there has been no tight
regulation over the formaldehyde used in the HDF binder.


06 Mar 2015, 06:42 AM


Mark_A
Obviously, solid hardware flooring is not affected. The most popular kind of hardwood flooring is pre-finished
engineered hardwood with a real wood layer on top (laminates have a plastic top finish with a photo image of
wood). Much of the engineered hardwoods sold by LL are name brand products such as Bellawood, which
are the same exact ones sold at other stores. I suspect that if engineered wood flooring was affected at LL, 60
Minutes would have focused on that, since it is a very large percent of hard flooring that is being installed,
especially in residential applications.


There may be other types of flooring besides laminates that are affected (stranded bamboo, etc), but I don't
believe it affects the vast majority of flooring sold at LL.


06 Mar 2015, 08:25 AM


course2kid
Huh? I don't think LL sells MDF or other raw composites, so, by definition, all the flooring they sell (that
contains fiberboard) is laminated (either with a wood veneer or some type of plastic laminate).

This article is funny. No offense, but I will wait for the government agencies to make the determination that LL's
products are unsafe. 60 minutes and your experts clearly have a different agenda.


Worst case scenario, they pay a fine and need to do a product recall if majority of their laminate products fail
"government" testing. They appear to be following all of the requirements within California procedurally so I find it
implausible that LL would be so reckless to distribute laminate products that are harming homeowners.


Keep in mind that your tests and other independent tests mean nothing. The only tests that matter are the ones the
government agencies will perform.

Hi Meridius,


I have no position in LL and only follow it as a curiosity.


I'm not in full agreement with your post... the worst case scenario may be accurate as far as dealing with the
problem (if any) but the worst case scenario relative to stock price is much different.


Regardless of the outcome, in the best of cases the BRAND has been damaged and it will lose some, or
many customers. This will negatively effect earnings and valuations. If you need to see a pre-cursor, just go
look at HLF.


If the problem is real and pervasive, law suits will cripple the price.


As far as the meaningfulness of tests ... I agree ... however ... the final test is the consumer. Judging form
what I see now, they are failing this test badly. Maybe they should learn from the "Lance Armstrong effect"
how to handle situations like these. LL's damage control isn't helping ... its hurting.


I also feel the need to mention that you are completely new to SA and have only two posts, both regarding LL.
I hope you are not just another troll and look forward to your comments. But until I notice some broader
contribution to this site I'll just keep an asterisk next to anything you write.

I don't think the brand is damaged. Yes, they have taken a hit on negative publicity but ultimately they are
measured on products/performance/s...


Safety is the only issue here, although an important one. Safety is managed by regulators and testing is
executed by independent testers certified by CARB. LL has clearly stated on their website they are in
compliance with CARB and provide all the details regarding this. If the public does not want to understand
this, they can vote with their money (take their purchase elsewhere).


Given the negative publicity on formaldehyde in their laminates (this issue was raised as early as 2013), I
would think CARB would immediately step in and issue a statement on recent events. This has not happened,
even though 60 minutes and others started the smear campaign last October 2014.


60 minutes video footage was investigated by both LL and their suppliers. If 60 minutes is so concerned
about providing consumer safety, why don't they send the full video footage of their suppliers to CARB and let
them investigate it? This doesn't seem to have happened at all; if it did, we would have heard something from
CARB by now.


Laminates are a fraction of their overall sales; they state 37% of 2014 net sales were from Laminate,
Bamboo, Cork and Vinyl Plank. Even if there is a recall, they could easily give the affected customers
alternative floors and absorb the cost of materials and installation.

Can't agree with you on this one.


Someone goes into Home Depot, Lowes, etc.. shopping for flooring and says it's $.xx cheaper at LL.
Salesperson says ... well ... need I say? Some sales lost this way.


As for the overall premise that performance is the measuring stick ... no way this is true. PERCEPTION is
everything. Furthermore, floors don't "perform", LL exists simply because of price. Change peoples mind from
low price to CHEAP, not to mention potentially hazardous and sales suffer.

My point is that what consumers want is the feeling that they count. It is well founded in situations such as
these (see Tylenol) one needs to show NOT denial, but concern. In this regard I think LL simply blew it. They

This situation is real. In the end it is the consumer and the symptoms they experience which will determine
whether a product is safe or not.


Tests are not always perfect. They can go both ways. They can make it look like something is unsafe when
perhaps it might not be and can make it look like something is safe when it is indeed very unsafe.


If anyone doubts what Chinese flooring will do, look at my YouTube playlist: 
http://bit.ly/17iUznF


I think I have a unique current and public reference with real-time recording of what formaldehyde and other
volatile organic compounds from China HDF floorboards can do to humans. I have even more information
available.


My floor was not from Lumber Liquidators, but it is a Chinese made floor with high density fiberboard in its
core. It was a Torlys floor that they had made in China. I did not know that originally. I thought it was a quality
Canadian floor.

How do you know that it is formaldehyde you are reacting to? As a medical doctor, I have seen these exact
symptoms many times before in my practice here in Dildo Newfoundland. I have also seen the physical
reactions to formaldehyde and it does not look at all like what you are manifesting. In my medical opinion
what you are actually reacting to appears to be mycoxaflopin. This is a common ingredient in most flooring
products that keeps various components rigid. For example, in hardwood flooring and laminate it assists in
inserting the tongue into the groove during installation. In carpet, it keeps the fibres standing up tall and stiff
so as to aid in vacuuming. There's a simple fix though. If you do not want this chemical in your flooring, you
just need to indicate this to your flooring salesperson, and they will gladly remove it prior to shipping. As a
plus, when removed, your IQ will also tend to enjoy an increase, and that's a side effect we could all benefit
from!

flooring is not an impulse buy and most customers walk in having already decided on what kind they want
(laminates, hardwood, etc.). It's an item most homeowners probably buy once (to replace the existing
flooring).


If you are an existing LL customer (having bought flooring previously), you would be naturally concerned with
all of the media attention. However, if you are a new customer (looking for flooring), are you going to care if
LL sells laminates if you are shopping for hardwood, etc.? New customers care about getting high-quality
flooring at the best price. These guys deliver on that with hardwood and other types.


At this point, you can tell LL is responding with messages carefully crafted and reviewed by their law firm. If
an existing customer is turned off by that rhetoric then that is their issue. New customers aren't going to care
one way or another if they are somewhat educated about flooring. I'm pretty sure I would educate myself on
any purchase exceeding $1k.

The shorts moved in before the laminate flooring story broke (they are the ones who broke the story by giving
the info to 60 Minutes). So I assume they snapped up as many shares to short as possible.


My understanding is that shares available to short are only available from other customers who have
purchased the stock on margin. Is that correct? If so, I would guess that those who did purchase on margin,
have closed out their positions, since some are saying that LL will go to zero (bankruptcy).


Looks like shorting selling, and then ruining the company in the media (for either valid or invalid reasons) is
the new equivalent of lawyers who make money with class-action lawsuits, and you don't have to have a law
degree to do it, and even if you spread false information you cannot be disbarred.

I just own puts straight up on this one. Can't lose more than my premium, and if it's a zero like I think it is, I'll

Again, folks with no clue about formaldehyde try to explain their position I have included an excerpt from a testing lab
and it explains that it is all around us and in many products that we all use today.


" 
Formaldehyde is a commonly used chemical compound that exists in various forms and at room temperature, is a
colorless, distinctive, strong and even pungent smelling, flammable and gaseous substance. Formaldehyde has been
used in a number of industries for various purposes such as: for the manufacturing of building materials – like pressed
wood products (mostly as an adhesive resin), fiber board, plywood, cigarette smoke, fuel burning appliances and
kerosene space heaters. Additional uses in household products include: additive for permanent –press, an ingredient
in glues, and as a preservative in medical laboratories – as embalming fluid, and as a sterilizer. Since Formaldehyde
is a by-product of combustion and other inherent processes, it can be found in significant concentrations and in
various environments.


It is also critical to note that the “11th report on carcinogens” classifies formaldehyde as "reasonably anticipated to be
a human carcinogen".


The following is a list of products that might have used formaldehyde in their production – meaning that industries that
produce these products could benefit from a regular monitoring program. This list is not meant to be all inclusive and it
is important to note that while formaldehyde may have been used in the production, it may not be present on the final
products.

Manufactured products:


Paper towels, photographic film, shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, lipstick and nail polish, some glues use
formaldehyde as a bonding agent, formaldehyde-based resins are used to manufacture composite panel products,
automobiles make use of formaldehyde for various units, various forms of inks, wrinkle free fabrics, building materials
(as mentioned above).


Why continue to use formaldehyde?


Formaldehyde has exceptional properties that cannot be easily replaced by other products; therefore, it is necessary
to continue its use until there are additional alternatives available on the commercial market.

This is from an accredited testing lab so you doubters do not have to take my word for it. Do not rip up your floors as
there is nothing wrong with your flooring IMO. Unless you sand your floor on a daily basis or decide to smoke them,
the are no toxic fumes being released. If it makes you feel better perform an air test in your home and you will see
that there is nothing wrong with the air in your home.  
60 minutes fell for a fool's story. If they wanted to do a real investigative report they would have gone to CARB and
asked if they think what LL is doing is wrong. They went to China but not next door to California. The fact is that no
one from CARB did or has come forward to say what LL is doing is wrong. It might not be the best practice but it is
CARB's responsibility to stop and close LL if people are in such a grave danger. The fact is that they are not. 
Your car emits CO and CO2 and they can be deadly, but you use a car every day. Just do not put it in your garage,
close the door and run the car. What is good about formaldehyde is that it stinks and can usually can not stand the
stench long enough.


Many Paints contains and you are told not to paint in a closed environment. However once the paint dries there is no
issue anymore. Maybe we should all go and scrape the pints off our walls.


It is sad how easy it is to scare people and everyone runs first which is what wall street type count on. It is like taking
candy from a baby.


Do your own research about formaldehyde and all the daily used products it is used in. Understand what it is and then
if you choose to be afraid that is your choice.


Good luck

As an aside; companies which rely on manufacturing plants in China must be aware of the associated risks.  
Just off the top of my head; I remember toxic drywall; baby food; dog food and now flooring. All of these tainted
products created significant negative financial situations for the companies involved. LL must now resort to serious

Let's see I short the stock and then I pay a firm to sue them making horrible accusations that are knowingly poisoning
their customers. Now Tilson didn't do this but the group backing GCM is short sellers. That is plain and simple stock
manipulation and should be illegal. You want to sue them fine but don't be able to short the stock at the same time.
Watch the report they admit this on the report.

I agree with you that this is "plain and simple stock manipulation and should be illegal." I'll add an exclamation
point for good measure!


If L.L. is cleared by a government investigation, I hope the short sellers who are responsible for stock price
manipulation are punished and the SEC prevents this from happening again in the future. I have seen this
many times in the past and it is despicable!

Forgot to mention this as it was on CBNC yesterday also. SEC has already launched an investigation due to the
number of puts gone into effect just before the Florida senator issued his investigation demand. Can you say insider
trading. Again, I do not know what the exact motive was and is, but greed play a part on both sides.

Insider trading by Senators is actually not illegal. Because, you know, they wrote the law on insider trading.

This comment from SA contributor Trading Alpha:


Who is Whitney Tilson anyway? Take a look at his past posts on Seeking Alpha. He famously shorted Netflix
asserting an outdated business model and the stock rose to $300. He shorted Green Mountain Coffee and is long
SODA, both big losers. Yes he has a few good shorts that he has written about but it appears to be one in three and
yet he writes some emphatically about the demise of each being so certain. Just look what he wrote about Google per
Wikipedia:


When Google had its IPO in 2004, Tilson famously said in 2004 Motley Fool article, "Google with the same market
cap of McDonald's (a stock I own)?! HA! I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be highly
disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to that."[7] Note:
Since then (as of 10/18/13) Google has gone on to give its investors over a 1050% return.


Two sides to every coin, so it seems.

This effects less than 10% of LL's product offering and the most it would be a customer relations issue for them. The
senator has not a clue about formaldehyde and most likely does not even know that every time he brushes his teeth
that he is exposed to it, yet he thinks he is qualified to issue an investigative action request.  
The put action went up over 500% just before his request were released and it even made CNBC as a insider action.
Maybe he wanted to take advantage of the unrealistic fear that has been created.


It is sad who can be a senator theses days.

The company only has $20M in cash to deal with this. Even if your 10% number is right, and say it is only for
product sold in the last 3 years, 10% of around $3 Billion is $300M.


I'll bet the legals alone will cost them over $20M here.

If California is the only state that has the formaldehyde regulations that were violated (assuming they were
actually violated), then why would LL have to replace laminate flooring in other states?


05 Mar 2015, 11:00 AM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Mark, are you kidding? BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING POISONED BY IT!


I wouldn't be surprised if many customers wanted a refund on any product sold by LL just because of
negative perception now.


05 Mar 2015, 11:19 AM


Mark_A
Illuminati Investments,


I guess you are short LL.


1. If the product tests OK without sanding the plastic laminate surface, then the formaldehyde inside the
product may be safe. Many, many, building materials and furniture have some level of formaldehyde in them.
If CA has unreasonable testing laws (and I don't know for sure if they do), there is no reason why everyone
should panic. Anyone who has particle board lumber or furniture in their home (just about everyone has
some) has products with formaldehyde in it.


2. Only LL-branded laminate flooring have the "problem." Pergo laminate flooring (also sold by HD and
Lowe's) did not fail the test. Pergo is sold at LL along with the LL brand. So if every laminate product sold by
LL must be replaced, then if HD and Lowe's sell the exact same products, should they be replaced also?


3. The "problem" is only with laminate (plastic surface) flooring. Solid wood flooring and engineered wood
flooring is not affected. Laminate flooring is a small percentage of the plank flooring market, especially in
home installations. How many people want plastic coated flooring with a printed "picture" of wood on the
surface in their homes? Given the labor involved to install flooring, pre-finished engineered wood flooring is
not much more expensive.

Illum: How many people have gotten poisoned by it exactly? If there were many people poisoned by it, why
have government agencies not plastered the media with news about the victims?


Outgassing declines over time. There are simple ways to minimize exposure to the chemical that doesn't
involve ripping out flooring. Even the sketchy CARB bureaucrats advise not ripping out flooring unless there is
evidence that it's the cause of the symptoms of toxicity. And it's very hard to prove that the flooring is actually
the source of the formaldehyde rather than other sources.


With that said, I imagine that LL will be driven down to about $5-15 in the next year. When a once-successful
company gets into the cross-hairs of the Sith Lord and his allies (media, politicians, trial lawyers), it's

You know what this means to me Illuminati Investments? It means that some lawyers are trying to profit off of
this thing just like the short sellers have.


I work in a place where people try to sue for damages all of the time. People try to defraud and sue
organizations and companies all of the time with lawsuits, many of which are completely unfounded.


So now lawyers are looking for victims in this case?


When Janney Capital Markets made those remarks about there not being any victims, they were right. I still
don't believe there are any real victims here.


My hope is that a government investigation will uncover the facts in this case. In the event that the short
sellers whom have basically caused this situation to unfold the way it has so far are not 100% right about their
accusations, the lawsuits that will ensue will cause the same damage upon them as they have attempted to
inflict both upon this company and shareholders of their equity, by the manipulation they have engineered.


Good luck to you.

Hi smitsky,


I'm confused....


You say ...."....short sellers whom have basically caused this situation to unfold the way it has so far are not
100% right about their accusations, the lawsuits that will ensue will cause the same damage upon them as
they have attempted to inflict......."


Why do the shorts have to be 100% right? If they are 51% right its still a pretty big right.


Actually, if anything they have said is right, then its a good thing they focused public awareness.


p.s. I rarely, if ever, have come across anybody that is 100% right. Our whole justice system is based upon
less than 100% certainty ... why do you hold the shorts guilt profile to a higher threshold than an accused
murderer?


09 Mar 2015, 09:39 PM


smitsky
I said "If..." You cut my "if" out.


If the short sellers are not 100% right, then they are whatever % wrong.


If they are found to be wrong about their accusations, I hope they are punished as I say. I don't think I need to
go into any more details. Thanks.

speech. http://bit.ly/1GzWqnd


09 Mar 2015, 11:50 PM


smitsky
I'm not sure who you are referring to here. If it is in regards to what I said, you have to read it again.


In lieu of you doing so I will again state the fact you are evidently twisting:


If a government test is done and it shows that the independent testing that was done yielded incorrect results,
my opinion is that the short sellers who instigated the testing and brought the story to 60 minutes should face
punishment for slander and stock manipulation.


Conversely, it logically follows that if government testing is done and the independent testing is confirmed as
being valid, then I'm sure the company will face whatever punishment they are apt to face in such
circumstances. The short sellers will continue to be applauded as they have been and they will have proved
their case.


Until the government testing is done, this situation is inconclusive as far as I am concerned.


If you agree with me fine. If you disagree with me, that's fine too. I will respect your opinion and I expect the
same respect from you.

So you left the "In the event that the" out.


I said I don't have to discuss this any further. You feel that you must, and you have continued by changing my

variable.

I have never attacked you and I'm sorry if you find it insulting that I hold an opinion different then yours or that
I point out that you made a misquote (there's still no *if* in your statement).


Perhaps, you consider it a personal attack if someone points out your error .. I don't know ... but I doubt many
would hold that same thought.


So, please don't be insulted if I point out another mistake ...


You say, now ..."I asked you to stop..."


You never asked me to stop ... you said you were stopping. Here's your statement, in its entirety, for you to

As I mentioned before, if CARB thought for a minute that this was a grave situation they would have already issued a
directive.  
Remember that even if there is a recall, it will not be an urgent recall and it will be spread out over years.  
Also a counter suit against the folks that initiated this is a very strong tool in raising money.  
There is no problem with the installed floors and they can give people free air quality testing refund and only those
proven to have higher levels of formaldehyde will be replaced. And in my opinion that would be very close to none as
under normal conditions there is no issue, only fear. They are required to change anything just because people have

a fear. 
One might have fear of driving a car but that does not entitle them to a refund.


Again this is only against a destructive test. Last I knew no one destroys their floor on a daily basis just prove that
they are unsafe. Also if you do a destructive action against the wood, it will dissipate in a short amount of time and
them you would have destroyed floor with no emissions.


It is so sad how misinformed folks are about this yet they choose to let fear guide them.


05 Mar 2015, 11:35 AM


Robert 7809591
Well if you go to the carb website they have issued a statement:


http://bit.ly/1wJZEBi


1. They don't recommend tearing up flooring unless you are exhibiting symtoms (burning sensation in eyes
and throat, breathing problems). They recommend good ventilation and say the emissions decrease as the
product ages.


2. They readily say that studies have shown the laminate and sealed edges reduce emissions.


3. If you think you have a problem they suggest AIR TESTING. They don't say take a piece of laminate to a
lab and have them sand off the laminate. That is "expensive and difficult". I found that revealing because I
have said all along that sanding off the laminate does not sound like a correct way to test since no one sands
laminate and the laminate reduces emisssions. But the CARB board says other sources of formaldehyde in
your home (gas appliances, carpeting, furniture, household cleaners and other products) may skew the test
so they don't recommend an air test.


So again if this is what the CARB board is recommending to people, why don't they test the flooring in a
sealed chamber???. If this was a huge problem with near term great health risks, why not immediately
demand that all the flooring be ripped out??

Lets get something straight here...it's not just their laminates! It wasn't brought into play on the 60 Minutes report but
their Stranded Carbonized Bamboo also tested high in formaldehyde levels. I would even tend to believe the
"stranded bamboo" which is strands that are glued together and dipped into formaldehyde may be worse then their
laminates. I have a friend that has this garbage through out their home and both were sick with sore throats and
continuous coughing and it's been documented. After it was installed in their home and they were having problems
with shrinkage, gapping and everything else you get when you purchase this flooring, the installer finally came clean
and said he hates installing this product! He said "no matter what you do, it's not going to help. My friends then
mentioned that they weren't feeling well since it was installed and told him of their symptoms. His reply to this was "go
on the internet and google formaldehyde in bamboo flooring." Yes.....there is formaldehyde in many products we use
on a daily basis but when you have a whole house installed with this and in the winter when the heat is on and the
windows are closed it can be very detrimental to one's health. No where on the box did it indicate that there was

formaldehyde in the product. I'm sure if my friends knew of this or saw it indicated on the box they would not have
purchased this product. Just because formaldehyde is in other products we use does not make this right! Maybe it's
time for government to make labeling of formaldehyde mandatory. The 'long" or "short" of it is they are putting peoples

on them....they shouldn't be in business!

I think I would disagree on a couple points.....to imply poisoning customers...when even US manufactures have
pointed out the the poorer china products have emissions similare to what has been sold for about 6 decades..and
are in probably 95 + % of homes in the US. I think that is risk thearte you are using (and which works well to your
end). We also know a tailpipe puts out about the same concentration of formaldehyde...and I doubt you go around
talking about how you are poisoning people.


Second, the sample preperation part of the CARB rules is "guidance", which was not subjected to the rule making
process (I have written regs, I recognize the difference). The test method (ASTM) is in the reg...the CARB "guidance"
on how to prepare samples is what you used to make your case (again, people follow it, but it is guidance, not the
regulation. I have often varied from "guidances" in doing risk based groundwater clean ups...and am not "non
compliant".

It is actually illegal now for members of congress to profit from laws. It was actually introduced by a republican (Scott
Brown) and with reluctance passed.


As for other comments: 
Formaldehyde does not release SLOW. If you read my previous post it is all around you and you do not even know it.
If you install the floor, formaldehyde is released within a matter of minutes. So your friend having a soar throat is
another issue and not formaldehyde. Just can not believe the level of misinformation out there.  
Yes, formaldehyde is in every wood product that uses glue to hold it together, however the only reason the laminate is
even in play is because it is a particle board and it needs more than the regular amount of glue to make it product.
There is not even a test required for the bamboo and other products like that because the amount of glue is so small
relative to what can cause an issue.  
I have over 800 SF of Bamboo installed and have never had a problem.


Here is more explanation but I know it does not stop the misinformation:


CARB limit is 0.05 PPM


60 Minute said it is 7 times that 0.35 PPM

Just so you know! Formaldehyde out gasses in the first year but can out gas up to 5 years and possibly up to
10 years per the NIH. Of course it is at it's highest level when delivered and unwrapped in your house, as
which was done with my friends, one of which has had asthma her entire life, but these emissions are also
effected by heat and humidity! I'm happy for you that you haven't experienced any problems with your flooring
but people who have asthma or allergies would be more susceptible to these emissions. I also think you need
to understand how some bamboo floor is manufactured. If it is Carbonized Stranded Bamboo as my friends
purchased, the strands are "bonded together" using a Urea formaldehyde in the glue! I wouldn't call this a
small amount by no means! 
In my opinion, and this should be the opinion of everyone, I would like to know what is in the product before I
buy it. Let me have the choice of what I put into my home! Whether I'm being poisoned on the day that it is
opened in my home (and who knows the effects it could have down the road) or whether it is compliant ....it
should be my choice and not some company who manufactures their products in this fashion to make a larger
profit at my expense! I feel this should be with all products. People with children, pets asthma and allergies I
feel it would be a major concern. There was "NO INDICATION" on the box indicating what was in the product
(Morning Star Carbonized Strand Bamboo) my friends purchased...she has the box. So please don't say we
are misinformed and unless you are a doctor or know the long term effects of this product you shouldn't
comment. And what really cracks me up is people saying it out gasses in a matter of minutes! Minutes, days
or years........it's in my house doing the initial out gassing! So, if it out gasses at extremely high levels for just
minutes and we inhale these emissions we shouldn't be concerned? Or if it's installed in the winter when
windows are shut and the heat is on I shouldn't be concerned? And just because other products have
formaldehyde in them, I shouldn't be concerned? Yes! I'am concerned......very concerned!

That should have been in an 8 hour period for the OSHA number. Typing too fast.


Also Goldman Sacks and Janny Capital have done their own research into the issue and are standing by LL with a
target of mid 40's. That is still much lower than the 60's that it was in but it is now way oversold by fear. 
So make you own decision.

Here is a the latest from Carb:


http://bit.ly/1wJZEBi


I assume they put this out in regards to all the issues raised. They do not recommend that one goes an removes
flooring unless it can be proven that flooring is causing your issue. Also the phase 2 went into effect in Jan 2014 so
we are only talking about a years worth of product sold.


One can take this both ways. Should you remove your flooring if it was installed in Dec of 2013 just because CARB
decided to change the limits. My opinion is one does not need to remove any flooring. Again this is in regards to
DESTRUCTIVE test. A laminate sitting on your floor does not emit any formaldehyde after a few days past
installation. If it was properly aired out, it would emit anything past the first day.


CARB solution to formaldehyde, air out your place.


Again OSHA's limit is 0.75 PPM. That is over 15 times the limit that is set by CARB 2 and it is for people that work
with it on a daily basis. I leave it to your judgment to see if the CARB number is reasonable or not.


06 Mar 2015, 11:24 AM


Replying.
Plant workers are presumably exposed to formaldehyde levels that are equivalent to the destructive test day
in and day out, given the need to deal with the boards during the glueing, drying as well as cutting processes.
Homeowners, however, are exposed to it in the same proportions that they get from laminated countertops
and veneered furniture, including floor-standing speakers.

QNB, 
One should install flooring in an open air environment. That gets rid of over 90% of the fumes.  
Does your friend ever paint a wall. When one paints, even with open windows you can smell the paint. The levels at
that point are over 300PPM yet we all paint our walls. 
Ever stood behind a car when before it moved away and then say that car stinks, then you are exposed to over 1000
ppm for as long as it takes to dissipate. Ever sit it traffic, then you are exposed to very high levels even if you open
your windows, yet we all choose to drive.


Does your friend have a table or a couch or a chair, or a china cabinet or other particle wood based products that use
glue to hold it together, then he or she is exposed. I understand having asthma is no laughing matter, but to blame it
on your wood flooring is.


That is why I say many folks are misinformed. What I explained above is just the tip of a iceberg regarding
formaldehyde but that does not mean we have to afraid of it, just know how to use it.


This misinformation is not victim free, many folks have investments that they will never get back, many folks will lose
their jobs for no good reason, competitive businesses are lost so next time you go to your HD or others your floor will
cost you twice as much for no good reason.


I am all for closing bad business, but this is not one. It is being targeted for some reason and to be honest I do not
know why yet, but I am sure it will come out.


Again, the OSHA limit is 0.75PPM over twice the maximum amount 60 minutes said they found on a test that is
unreasonable. This is for factory workers that are constantly exposed to that amount of formaldehyde on an 8 hour
basis. I am sure many of them have asthma but that limit is considered safe for them.


Good luck.

Dr. Z.
While many people will be just fine painting their walls, some people will actually become ill when exposed to
such levels, even for just a small time. They are the far end of the bell curve and so government regulators
happily ignore them. Having asthma is pretty good indicator that your environment is not safe for you.

it is a great time to sell shorts on your shares if you think LL will never go that low. So, I am sure there are many
shares that can be available for shorting if people think this is the bottom.


My personal opinion is that it will bounce back up to the 40's that it was in, as Janny's Capital analyst has mentioned,
beyond that I am not sure.


Just as a point of comparison information, Chevy got hit with a lot of law suits and recalls with regard to their ignition
switch on certain cars and people said that they will have a hard time recovering. They had the best sales quarter last
year. Not that it is guaranteed but it is lot of advertising for their 90% of other products that is not even in question.

Enersavr, 
You say "we shouldn't be afraid of formaldehyde...just know how to use it." How would you know how to use it if you
didn't know it was in the product? Your missing my point! How many people do you know that know how to use it? I'm
not saying my friends are going to drop dead tomorrow but please don't tell me my friends symptoms were not caused
by the emissions from their flooring. I myself when visiting them at their home could smell a distinct odor that left me
feeling nauseas. This strong smell stayed in their home for over 2 months! In fact, when the boxes were opened you
could almost feel the moisture in the wood telling me that the wood was not properly dried. 
Getting back to the point.... The product should have been compliant with CARB and it wasn't. And please don't tell
me LL didn't know this! 
And as far as them not being a bad business....I think you should go on the internet and get more informed. Look
under Lumber Liquidator complaints and read how they don't stand by their warranties and how they hire their own
inspectors to write up false reports....I could go on and on but there are hundreds if not thousand of complaints. I
know this because not only did my friends get sick, but the product they had installed shrunk, gapped, cupped and
split and when you call them they don't want to know anything! Good company? I don't think so! What Mr. Tilson
found was just icing on the cake! You have a lot of pissed off people out there who have lost thousands of dollars
because of LL's business practices. I've been in business for many years and this is not how you treat your
customers! 
I'm glad you have not had any problems with your flooring but there are thousands who have and this is not going to
go away any time soon!

he shorted shares that others covered. He's basically saying other people who covered their shorts in the last few
days are wrong and that he will make more money being short.


He cites potential increase in legal costs and lost sales, but he's not considering that new customers may opt to get
the more expensive products (hardwood, etc). These guys have the best deal on hardwood.


I can see it in their showrooms now: "yes, these laminates were featured on 60 minutes. If you are uncomfortable with
it, we recommend the hardwood flooring!"


I'm not sure how Wilson suddenly knows more about LL than the guy who started the company in 1994, but I think the

Hi Meridius,


You say ...."...I can see it in their showrooms now: "yes, these laminates were featured on 60 minutes. If you
are uncomfortable with it, we recommend the hardwood flooring!"....


SA has readers with various agendas. Some try to help a stock, some try to hurt a stock. One can say that
these are people trying to influence the direction of the story.


Then there are those that are looking for actionable information so they can determine if they want to take any
position in the stock. They aren't trying to influence the story-line, but follow it to where it's going.


It is pretty clear your mission is to support the stock and/or company and that's fine. Why not?


But to suggest that new customers would opt for hardwood, etc., instead of just going to Home Depot, is a
stretch.


Though it is anecdotal, a dear friend of mine is the treasurer of the largest private lumber yard (actually 8
yards) in my area. He told me that the 60 minutes piece was the best thing that's happened in a while and
they have a noticeable uptick in flooring sales ... both hardwood and laminate. Interestingly, the uptick is
outsized from contractors, and he figures they have a lot at stake and don't want to face sales resistance.


I don't know about the "big box" or if his experience is representative.


What I do know, is that the uptick has to come from somewhere and it's a reasonable guess to assume at the
expense of LL.


What really intrigues me, is that contractors seem to be making a business decision that LL represents a risk.

I am not going to claim that LL has not been hurt by this, but they sell several brands of laminate, including
Pergo, which is not implicated. Exact same Pergo as sold at other retailers.


Also, there are two types of hardwood:


1. Solid hardwood (unfinished or finished) 
2. Engineered wood, with a top veneer of hardwood (finished).


The above (combined) outsell laminate (plastic) floors by a wide margin in residential installations, especially
for remodeling. Who wants a plastic floor with a "picture" of wood on it instead of real wood? Apartments and
lower end tract housing would be more likely to use laminate.


Laminate is used in a lot of high traffic commercial applications, but that is usually a different grade of
laminate.

LL is going to take a serious hit on this one. Americans are coming to realize that happiness isn't about "buying as
many cheap products they can with their earnings" it's about "buying quality good's that are safe". Look at food
product manufacturers dropping all the artificial sweeteners out of their product. More and more people are
demanding quality.


08 Mar 2015, 01:46 PM


Mark_A
If they want quality, not sure why they would buy plastic (laminate) flooring in the first place. Wouldn't they buy
real wood or at least engineered wood (with real wood veneer on top)?


If they do want "quality" laminate, they can get Pergo brand laminate at LL or other retailers. Pergo is
considered to top quality laminate brand, and was not implicated in the formaldehyde testing.

Hi Mark A,

1. Do you have any stats on how much laminate was been sold by LL compared to solid wood strips, or
engineered wood strips?


2. Do you have any stats on how much LL house brand laminate was sold compared to Pergo laminate at
LL?

08 Mar 2015, 07:07 PM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi Mark A,


LL does not reveal a definitive breakdown as their breakdown combines laminates, bamboo and cork (LBC).


That grouping represents about 46% of flooring sales, which is nearly as much as hardwood. When you
consider they are 1/2 to 1/3 the price, the unit sales are 2 to 3 times greater than hardwood.


Laminates are growing in popularity and my lumber yard friend tells me that they outsell bamboo and cork by
a considerable margin and have been growing much faster than the other groupings. Now, I can't say if this is
the same with LL.


Laminate as a percentage has been growing and (if nothing happened) would likely surpass hardwood in
2015.


So, I think to say "lots of it" is not an understatement.


By the way, I'm not telling people what they should or should not do. I'm not trying to influence a result .... I'm
simply giving my observations so people can make up their own mind.


It is very revealing that you admit to trying to tell people what to do(...".I am telling people what they should
do."...). It may be effective in helping the lemmings, or "the choir", but I doubt it counts too much with
knowledge-seeking SA readers that are comfortable coming to their own conclusions.


There are many situations like this all the time (auto recalls, oil spills, contaminated drugs, food, etc.). I can't
recall any incident where it has not affected stock price. It is also my observation that the road to recovery
starts with concern for the consumer and does not start with denial. I believe that LL is pulling a "Lance
Armstrong" and may exacerbate the problem. They should take a lesson from Tylenol.


Now, if the sales are as small as you suggest, then LL is doubly guilty for their denial. If it's not a big deal, just
own up and move on. So if the problem is small ... they're making it bigger and if the problem is big ... well?.
Either way you slice it, it isn't good for LL.

"LL does not reveal a definitive breakdown as their breakdown combines laminates, bamboo and cork (LBC).
That grouping represents about 46% of flooring sales, which is nearly as much as hardwood."


I just checked the 2013 annual report (latest available) and it contained this:


- Laminates, bamboo, cork, and vinyl plank - 38% of sales. 
- Solid and engineered hardwood - 44% of sales 
- Moldings and accessories - 18% of sales.


Bamboo flooring is increasing in popularity, and your numbers did not include vinyl plank flooring for the
category. Vinyl flooring is often used in basements and utility areas that might be exposed to water/moisture.


The other question is how much of the laminate flooring sold by LL is their own house brand, and how much
is other brands not made by LL.


I am not saying the problem is small (I don't know the exact magnitude), just that the impression was left with
the general public, and members of SA, that all LL flooring has the problem, which does not appear to be the
case. The title of this article talks about "wood testing" and laminate flooring is not even real wood (it is plastic
on top of a fiberboard core). Given that we know from 60 Minutes that shorts are leading the way towards
publicizing this issue, they have a vested interest in spreading false or misleading information.


As to whether there is a real problem with the level of formaldehyde emitted is another matter beyond my
expertise, other than I know fiberboard is used in many home construction materials and furniture, and it also
usually contains formaldehyde.


But I am probably a little slow to understand these things, because when I was in biology labs in school, I
breathed copious amounts of formaldehyde, and probably suffered permanent brain damage.


I have no connection to LL or any other flooring company or retailer, and I have never owned any LL security.
I did not even know LL was a publicly traded company until I saw this article.

Hi Mark A,


I don't know the extent other than the CEO on 60 minutes gave me the impression that it was a lot of

But, that's my whole point ... if it is a small problem, then just say you'll do whatever is necessary to fix any
under-standard floors. Come out and say that the well-being of the consumer and the integrity of their
products is the only thing that matters.


That's how one regains consumer confidence. This hem-hawing, accusation laden denial just erodes
consumer confidence.


Look, any company or product can have problems, it's how management chooses to deal with it that is the big
variable.

"60 Minutes," the author of this article, and many commenters have given the impression that it is all LL strip
flooring that has a problem, particularly "wood" strip flooring (see title of this article). In fact, NO wood strip
flooring is affected, and only laminate flooring is affected (flooring with plastic top layer with a photo of wood).
Further, only LL house brand laminate flooring is affected (allegedly), and other brands of laminate flooring
sold by LL are not affected.


None of the facts has been made clear, and that is my point. I am suspicious as to why these facts have not
been made clear.

Hi Mark A,


I agree the facts are not out ... but they are not out from either the supporters or the detractors. Everyone is making
judgments based upon hypothesis. That is why I say that LL is not investable either long or short.


That said, it seems that the detractors have made their case and LL, if they are in possession of rebuttal, has failed to
offer a convincing rebuttal. Instead, they have attacked the detractors, attacked their motives and said they would look
into it. (p.s. This issue has been going on for over 1 1/2 years and NOW they say they have to look into it? p.p.s. The
test results that showed excessive levels had been offered to LL over a year ago and LL refused them).


Law school taught me that " when you have the facts on your side .... argue the facts; when you have the law on your
side ... argue the law; when you have neither ... attack your opponents motives and credibility". This has served me
well in drawing inference as to "what's up".


QED: I said LBC represents 46% of flooring sales. If LBC is 38% of total, and Hard-wood is 44%, with 18%
accessories, as you detail, then LBC DOES IN FACT represent exactly 46% of total flooring sales. (38%/(38%+44%))

Since this is an investment forum, the "scope" of the problem is relevant, and it appears that there is some
very sloppy, or sometimes malicious, reporting on what flooring is actually affected by the problem. Wood
flooring or engineered wood flooring is not affected. Not all brands of laminate flooring sold by LL are affected.
Those are the facts.


I am not connected with LL or the flooring industry in any way, even as an investor. I am just as interested in
knowing about the real impact of formaldehyde on people's health as everyone else. But when I see people
distorting the facts about what products are affected, that makes me wonder about their credibility, and it
makes me wonder about everything else they say.

"QED: I said LBC represents 46% of flooring sales. If LBC is 38% of total, and Hard-wood is 44%, with 18%
accessories, as you detail, then LBC DOES IN FACT represent exactly 46% of total flooring sales.
(38%/(38%+44%))"


But that number includes vinyl flooring, not just laminate, bamboo, and cork (according to the 2013 annual
report). Also, not all brands of laminate flooring are affected.

Hi Mark,


We both agree that laminate sales are not differentiated, but bundled with other types. Since this bundle
matches hardwood, it's reasonable to assume laminate sales are significant.


How much is tainted ... I have no idea ... But my point is the only one with this info is LL and they're not
forthcoming. So, LL has allowed the detractors to exaggerate the effect.


And that's my whole point ..... LL is mishandling this. Or, as some suggest, it's worse than we think. Either
way, the stock price suffers.


09 Mar 2015, 12:13 PM


Mark_A
Obviously, the price of LL has suffered and will suffer. I have never suggested otherwise. But LL sells other
brands of laminate that are not affected, because the same brands are sold by Lowe's and HD (Pergo). This
is fact that you seem to be systematically excluding. In addition, there is a clear attempt to try and muddle the
difference between laminate and wood strip flooring in order to induce panic, and ignoring vinyl flooring that is
included in the sales figures for non-wood flooring that your presented.


I don't see how LL comments (or lack of comments) on formaldehyde excuse any misrepresentation of what
products are affected. It is up to those making the claims to be accurate, and that has not happened. All I hear

Hi Mark,


.....".............same brands are sold by Lowe's and HD (Pergo). This is fact that you seem to be systematically
excluding......"


Excluding from WHAT. All I've ever said is that the tainted laminate sales are either 1) significant or 2) Not
significant .... and in either event it is in LL's interests to come clean. (though I have noted and provided
anecdotal evidence that it is most likely significant).


I've further stated that if tainted sales are not significant then LL is allowing this meander to blow way out of
proportion and evidences a mishandling.


It is you that are trying to discount how much tainted flooring is sold ... I say it doesn't matter ... what's on trial
is not the laminate ... it's LL. They are currently engaging in a path that can cost them the loyalty of customers
... instead of the admiration of potential customers.


The stock continues to take a bath (down 15% today) a week after 60 minutes. You can put this squarely on
LL managements head, the "facts" or "quasi facts" haven't changed ... it's LLs response (or should I say non-
response) that's spooked the market.


If you can't see that, maybe you should lift your eyes.

I am not trying to discount anything. Obviously there is a big impact on LL stock. I am just for accurate

Hi Mark A,


I think we're going around in circles.


You made the point that we don't know how many sales tainted laminate (if it's even tainted) represent. I
agree and have agreed with you.


Though the quantity does matter in legal proceedings and potentially injured parties, it doesn't seem to be
what's driving the stock down.


So, since this is a stock forum, I've tried to highlight my opinions on what's effecting the stock price and its
impact on future direction. The facts are being trumped by the PERCEPTION and perception is everything.

This incident isn't unique, it happens all the time and if someone is trying to decide on the stock, they might
be better served discovering the perception rather than the facts ... at least in the short to mid term.


I'm not going to debate over how many boards are being sold, it just doesn't seem to be relevant to what's

Reel Ken,


I am not responsible for any response to whether there is excessive amounts of formaldehyde in laminate
flooring, since I have no association with LL or its securities. You keep trying to shift the blame for posting
incorrect or misleading information to what LL may or may not have done.


Fact 1, You stated that the the sales for laminate are grouped with bamboo and cork for reporting purposes.
False, as it is also grouped with vinyl, which has significant sales of its own, thus the sales of laminate you
stated are likely over-stated.


Fact 2. You failed to acknowledge in your LL laminate sales numbers that only certain "house" brands of
laminate sold by LL are affected, and the "name brands" of laminate sold by LL (and also sold by HD and
Lowe's) are not affected.


Please stop trying to shift the blame for the above mis-statements. LL may be found liable for violations of the
law, and I am not trying to diminish that, nor am I trying to be judge, jury, and executioner until they have had
their day in court. I am just trying to be accurate about the potential problem.

"facts" probably won't be known for a year or years and are of little value in assessing the stock price today or
in the short term.


I'll keep focusing on LL's lack of transparency and obfuscation of the facts. For those that are interested in
what's driving the stock price they should concentrate on the public perception .... judging by the stock action
... its not very favorable.


And that, sir, is my point. It is not the defect or amount of tainted laminate (if any) that is the problem, it is the
way management is handling the issue. As we all learned from Watergate, it's not the crime its the cover-up.
And this may well come down to "what did you know and when did you know it".


So, you can keep looking at the floor, I'm looking a little higher up.

Hi Mark A,


Totally with you on this one.


You are completely on target that this is an investing forum. Unfortunately, SA serves, not only as a place to get
information, but a propaganda venue for trolls.


This is a story that has played out, over and over again with HLF, TESLA AAPL and others. I've always found it
helpful to check a person's comment history. There are always a few that recently enter for/against a particular stock,
comment on nothing else and are adamant in their position. Pretty easy to figure them out.


My interest in LL ( and HLF, TESLA, etc.) is simply as a spectator. When I see "troll-like" behavior distorting reality, I
try to point it out. Helps me pass the time so I'm not overly fixated on other things.

The CARB 2 ridiculous number went into effect in Jan of 2014. So at most their exposure is just about a year's worth
of products.


Even CARB put out a bulleting on MARCH 5th explaining that certain varnish covering will reduce out-gassing and
they do not recommend people remove their floors. Even they realized they went overboard. We are talking about a
700PPM difference between the government agency OSHA limit and CARB limit. Maybe OSHA is a little high but
CARB seems extremely ridiculous.

If the CARB bulletin suggested a way to reduce emissions and the risks, instead of saying the level is set too
high and don't worry about it .... how is this an admission of going overboard.


I read it as just the opposite ... a confirmation that steps can be taken to mitigate the risk without actually
removing the flooring.


It's sort of like saying a condom can be used for safe sex as an alternative to abstinence


09 Mar 2015, 03:57 PM


QNB
Reel Ken, 
I agree! I think CARB is saying not to remove the flooring because the emissions (off gassing) has already
occurred at high levels with the initial install.....so why remove it....damage is already done! And if I'm not
mistaken, that report also said not to remove it "unless" there are noticeable health problems or you believe
the flooring is the source of the problem! So going by your analogy.... they are saying unless you find a hole in
the condom!

Consumers and installers have been complaining about the products LL's have been selling for years! Most installers
(if they can afford to) will avoid installing their product or try to direct them else where. Some of the reasons are listed
below.


1. Most of their products are of low standard & quality 
2. LL doesn't stand by their warranties 
3. Very poor customer service 
4. Use their own inspectors to write up false reports 
5. Make it a practice of passing the blame onto the installer or consumer


And now we can add high levels of formaldehyde in some of their products and not complying with CARB. They knew
about these levels in 2013 with their Morning Star Carbonized Strand Bamboo when it was tested and all they are
doing now is back peddling! 
Like I have said before "people have lost thousands of dollars due to LL's business practices alone" and now couple
this with the new accusations regarding 'formaldehyde" brought on by Tilson and you have a company that is headed
towards bankruptcy!

survive and thrive for the sake of the 1000+ employees who are likely very happy to have a job in this
economy. (I'm not a short seller nor a shareholder. The story is fascinating though.)

I understand.


From my experience, whenever short sellers are involved in something like this, it's always very controversial
and sketchy. I won't trust this until the government steps in and performs testing.


I watched as something very similar happen with Questcor. Short sellers came out with "proof" that the drug
Questcor was making a huge profit on and market with was a complete sham. The (the short sellers) had
independent testing done to prove it.


Questcor's stock was a veritable "yo-yo" being manipulated up and down for months on end.


In the end Questcor was bought out by $MNK for $5.8 billion. So much for the short sellers "proof" that the
drug was a sham.

Hi smitsky,


Shorts seller can and do try to manipulate stocks. For that matter so do longs. It is part of the wonderful system we
created(LOL).


However, shorts also dive in when they smell blood in the water. I believe this is what's happening.


This all started 1 1/2 years ago, quite innocently, without any short-selling involved. LL simply swept it under the rug
(actually they pulled out the big guns to smother the little guy) WRONG move #1.


LL must of thought they got past it and did nothing to correct the problem. WRONG move #2.


Tilson found out about the problem, did some research to confirm the accuracy of the past problem and figured stock
would tumble. There is no question he used his presence to publicize the issue and put the stock into a tailspin.


BUT, and I must emphasize, that is not stock manipulation. People say good and bad things about stocks every day.
The stocks gain/suffer only if the public perceives truth in the statement.


But, getting back to LL ... management could have, in response ...


1) Enumerated exactly how much flooring is involved, 
2) Assured the public that they will do whatever is necessary to rectify any problem, including replacing the flooring, if
required


Instead, they ....


1) claimed the opponents testing was not compliant (wrong move #3)  
2) Claimed they have adequate controls (wrong move #4) 
2) Denied they had previous knowledge about this (wrong move #5) 
3) Attacked the motives and character of the opponents (wrong move #6)


Now, had they taken a more responsible course, the stock would have gone down after 60 Minutes, and rebounded.
Instead, since they took the wrong course, when more info started to show that the issue had legs, the stock actually
suffered to an even greater extent.


So, you and others can blame the shorts if you wish, but they are just investors trying to capitalize on a stock with
issues ... they aren't creating it.


If you want to find blame, you need look no further than management ... for if there's a problem they had an
opportunity to fix it, on their terms, 1 1/2 years .... and if there's no problem ... they could have ended the negative
publicity.


p.s. Just in case you don't get it .... if there is no problem ... then LL risks nothing by saying they will do whatever is
necessary to correct any problem. Their failure to make such a statement is indicative of the potential for a big
problem. That's what keeps the feeding frenzy going.

I do agree that the LL management did not handle this well. They should have been out in front of it rather than trying
to smother it. These things do not get smothered even if it really is a non issue.  
What is wrong with our system is that there is no punishment for false accusations and creating mass hysteria.
Posting here will not move the needle, nor had Whitney's efforts had done anything. The folks at 60 minutes had the
duty to make sure what they were reporting is at least 90% factual. The fact the US government agency responsible
for safety has a limit twice the maximum level found by 60 minutes should have given them pause to investigate more
before panicking the public. Maybe, just maybe California has gone overboard. As some one else also said, California
has a GAS regulation that makes the tank of gas in your car, in just about every state, to be illegal in California. I do
not see people emptying their tanks to comply with California, nor do I think you will be happy if they told you a gallon
of gas is going to cost you over $5.


The environmentalists have taken over California and are running a muck IMO. That does not mean every state has
to follow them.


I just hope the LL management has learned quickly as they need a crash course in customer relations, specially in
their business. It is their action or lack of action that is going to determine what happens to LL after their call. 
The facts are behind them, but it is the fear that needs to managed.

Fir those too lazy to do so, here's my summary ...


1) Some products may have been mislabeled 
2) Don't panic or over-react. As a GENERAL RULE there are steps to be taken BEFORE removing flooring. (CARB
then lists some) 
3) If symptoms persist, then consider removing the flooring. 
4) CARB is undergoing its own investigation.


Personally, I find the "cherry picking" interesting. CARB doesn't deny a problem can exist, is taking steps to find out
what's going on and simply says "don't panic". This is then taken by the bulls (are you one, smitsky?) and passed off
as a defining moment in their quest.


Now, there may or may not be a problem and it may or may not be large, but grasping at straws does no one good. It
seems that the bulls, those that have criticized 60 minutes for exaggerating the problem are now doing the exact
same thing.

Reel Ken, 
I totally agree! Just the fact that they say "if symptoms persist" is basically admitting these emissions can cause
problems! Just like the cigarette packs that use to say "May be Hazardous to your Health" and now read "Causes
Cancer." I personally don't think we know enough about the effects of formaldehyde or the problems it can cause
down the road. I think CARB is being cautious! Maybe a way of solving this problem is all products that contain
formaldehyde should be labeled "This product Contains Formaldehyde and May be Hazardous to your Health." Let
the consumer make the choice if they want to take the risk! I'll bet 9 out of 10 people who purchased this flooring
didn't know it contained Formaldehyde nor do they know about all the other products we use on a daily basis which
contains this carcinogen. Shouldn't it be the right of the consumer to know what is in the product they
purchase....especially if it could be hazardous to their health? My concern here is not the "short" or "long" of it ....my
concern is that 10 to 20 years down the road I or anyone in my family doesn't get cancer from it. And yes......there is a
panic out there by the consumer! Why is there a panic? Because consumers are being educated. I for one read labels
and try to protect my family in anyway possible from potential hazards but it's a little hard to do if a product doesn't list
what's in it or the company that sells it labels it compliant when it isn't!

Read the science on it. There have been studies undertaken for decades now and none of them point to any
link between formaldehyde off gassing from building materials (or green apples for that matter) and any kind
of long term illness. There is simply no link. However, many people also think the world is still flat.
Formaldehyde in pure form is a toxin, and it is on the list of "probable carcinogens" - not even a direct link
there though. People can react dramatically to peanut butter - does that mean it is a carcinogen?

You both miss the whole issue.


Whether or not formaldehyde is or is not dangerous is just a Red Herring.


This is all about whether or not their was mislabeling, whether it was intentional and whether or not LL was
complicit in it.


Just because someone doesn't agree with a regulation (for whatever reason) they can conscientiously object
to and try to change it or they can commit an act of FRAUD in an attempt to circumvent it.


If there is no FRAUD, then there is no problem. If there is FRAUD then it doesn't matter a hoot, how you or
anyone else feels about formaldehyde.

sure 60 Minutes or Tilson would have got the desired effect if this was the case.


The fact is, they want the public to believe this story is about a future hideous poisoning death by the
unscrupulous Chinese - now that gets ratings and tanks stocks!


So the issue is mislabeling? I don't think so. This is about 3 things;

This was a sleeper story for almost two years. It was discovered by someone who was not trying to
manipulate anything, just trying to get to the truth and even solicited LL's input.


LL swept it under the rug. Tilson eventually caught wind of it, allegedly did some testing to confirm and went
short.


It was 60 minutes, doing their own investigation that went to China and secured the incredible (if true)
admissions of plant workers.


So, the issue remains, whether or not there was intentional mislabeling, whether LL knew what was going on
and whether they were complicit in it.


It is NOT, as you suggest "..... this story is about a future hideous poisoning death by the unscrupulous
Chinese ...." it is whether an American Company knowingly or intentionally was involved in fraudulent activity
that may pose a health risk. And, of course, if so, it was simply a profit motive.


So, you can float any Red Herring you want .... the story is about American Greed ... and that is what is
riveting the public.

Very good Post silverline17. Repped.


As I said, if the government tests these products and the results are not supportive of the independent testing
that the team of short sellers had done and had 60 minutes act upon, then both the short sellers and 60
minutes should be punished.


I guess me using the word punished upsets some people. Well, pain is a difficult word to deal with also, but
pain is a term that is often used in relation to stock prices and investor's feelings when the issues they are
holding lose value.


So, the S.E.C should investigate stock price manipulation that has been caused in this case, and those who
endured the pain of losing money should be compensated.


Well, it looks like the government is not going to lay out the major expense of testing. They haven't even
ordered these products removed. That should tell you right there that these products are legal.


I could go on and on but at this point I won't.

Your whole premise seems to have just collapsed.


Iceberg ahead...full speed astern....


Today, LL acknowledged that CARB tested samples and found some exceeded the limits.

Hi smitsky,


Good stuff. Many were hoping/predicting this.


But it doesn't change much for LL, as the issue remains ....


Was there deliberate mislabeling of product, was LL aware that product was mislabeled and was LL complicit in the
mislabeling?

If L.L. has failed government testing then they should face the necessary punitive action. I have been saying this all
along. I have also been saying that the short sellers who brought this to light should be applauded if they (the tests
showing that L.L.'s products did not meet code) are true. This now seems to be the case. Let's see how this unfolds.

" ......If L.L. has failed government testing then they should face the necessary punitive action. I HAVE BEEN
SAYING THIS ALL ALONG (emphasis added)..."


Your PRIMARY position has been................


".....In the event that the... short sellers whom have basically caused this situation to unfold the way it has so
far are not 100% right about their accusations, the lawsuits that will ensue will cause the same damage upon
them as they have attempted to inflict both upon this company and shareholders of their equity, by the
manipulation they have engineered...."


You made a SECONDARY acknowledgement that if it's the other way around then LL, etc.


You've been taking two opposing positions at the same time, but you have clearly and primarily been focusing
on punishing the shorts.


If your plan was to take both sides then resurface with "I got it right" however it panned out, then all your posts
should have been more evenly balanced instead of overwhelmingly supportive of LL. At least that would
exhibit a greater level of integrity.


SA is at its best when those commenting are willing to admit when they are wrong and not just try to cover
their bets or silence opposition.


Imagine what SA would look like if everyone said ,,,,"just in case it's the other way around ... that is also my
position..." That type of commentary would render SA useless as an investing tool.


p.s. Now, I often voice an opinion and acknowledge that there are factors that cold run counter to my opinion.
BUT, I don't try to take credit for those factors if they play out as if that's the horse I was betting on.

I don't know Mark. I haven't either heard anything regarding that or looked into it.


If the state does decide to prosecute them, it will be publicized.

I would think that the CA imposed penalties would have to be documented in the CA laws somewhere.
Otherwise, they can only issue a cease and desist order for CA sales of the products with a problem, which is
probably moot by now.


Obviously, customers can file civil suits against LL.

Another reason that Tilson is off base is his assertion that LL could be held liable for vast sums. If any judge with half
a brain gets a hold of this case, they will toss it out. If that generates great public outcry, then, maybe, CARB will

tighten its requirements to assuage the ignorant masses, but, that will only increase the cost of future flooring. Also, if
LL is held liable, its suppliers will also be held responsible and CARB will be held responsible for not performing
enough compliance testing. The fact that CARB has a compliance program should mitigate any liability that LL would
face if some well meaning, but ignorant judge (or jury) determined that LL was performing testing in an unapproved
manner.


26 Mar 2015, 03:30 PM

Tilson is absolutely wrong in his assessment of what tests CARB Phase 2 requires. Anyone can read the CAR
requirements on their website and quickly realize that the testing required for such flooring is to take samples, with the
laminate in tact, place them back to back, and tape the edges. This leaves any formaldehyde trapped between the
laminated surfaces and the taped edges. Deconstructive testing is absolutely not required.


Can formaldehyde still get out, yes, at a rate depending on the porosity of the laminate, the concentration of
formaldehyde in the core, and the amount of time the formaldehyde has been outgassing from the core.


The deconstructive tests can be used to determine if there is a problem with the core having too much formaldehyde,
but this test is best used by the manufacturer of the core material while the material is still fresh. Using the
deconstructive test on a finished flooring product will yield greatly varying test results because, as time elapses from
manufacture, the formaldehyde outgasses from the core, the concentration of formaldehyde near the surface
decreases, and formaldehyde from deeper in the core migrates toward the surfaces where the concentration is lower.
So, the test results will greatly depend on how much time elapsed from core manufacture to attachment of the
laminate, time elapsed between application of the laminate and testing, original concentration of formaldehyde in the
core, depth of sanding used in removal of the laminate, time elapsed from sanding of samples to performance of test
(this source of variability is mostly mitigated by the CARB 2 storage requirements for samples), and the actual
sanding mechanics (e.g. what type of sand paper is used, how much pressure was applied, what surface temperature
resulted from the sanding, etc.). Temperature and pressure during sanding can affect the migration rate of
formaldehyde within the core and can either lead to either concentration or depletion of formaldehyde levels at the
surface of the specimens.
