Summary

KERN


Cannabis industry software provider Akerna has a history of producing glitch-
plagued, poor quality software.


Government documents reveal a reduction and probable cancellation of Akerna’s
Washington contract, one of only three the company currently has, casting
management guidance into doubt.


After a run of acquisitions combined with Akerna’s unprofitable underlying
business, the company is quickly depleting its cash necessitating a raise in the near
term.


KERN is trading at 5-times expected CY 2020 sales but software revenues -
Akerna's growth driver - have grown only at ~10% CAGR since 2017.

Background


Undisclosed Probable Contract Cancellation


We believe KERN is overvalued and vulnerable to a sharp sell-off given the
headline risk.


Akerna Corp (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:KERN) is a cannabis industry software provider
operating in three main areas: government regulatory software, commercial software
and consulting services. The government product, known as Leaf Data Systems (39% of
FY19 revenues), enables state regulators to ensure cannabis vendor supply chain
compliance. Akerna competes for state contracts, and any wins naturally encourage
state commercial vendors to use KERN’s inventory tracking software, thus enabling the
company to “upsell” its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software known as MJ
Platform (37% of FY19 sales). As such, Akerna’s business is highly reliant on these
government contracts. Three companies have signed exclusive contracts with twenty-six
states for these “seed-to-sale” tracing systems: Tiger Global-backed Franwell’s Metrc
(13 states), Helix TCS’ BioTrackTHC (10), and Akerna’s MJ Freeway (3). Arcview
Market Research estimates US cannabis businesses will spend $521m on software and
IT services in 2020.


Akerna currently has active contracts with regulators in only three states –
Pennsylvania, Washington and Utah. A document from the Washington State Liquor and
Cannabis Board indicates that after years of delays and quality issues, the state could
be ready to end its relationship with Akerna and find a new software provider. The
internal Jan 8th, 2020 memo from the Office of the Washington State Chief Information
Officer disclosed that Akerna’s Washington State contract scope was reduced last
month to prevent it from improving, after 6 months of effort, critically flawed software
from a repeatedly corrupted July 2019 software update. Akerna will pay a non-accrued
for, nor disclosed, $267K penalty due to repeated timeline and operational failures. The
memo hints that the state will soon begin the process of switching software providers:


“As it operates today, the system has only been partially implemented with known
defects that are being addressed via workarounds. At this point, the vendor,
licensees, stakeholders and WSLCB are all in agreement that the risk of further
disruptions to the market caused by the software outweigh any potential benefit. “

Akerna’s Largest Contract Likely Also At Risk


An industry insider we spoke with expects an RFP for a replacement vendor will be
issued in the March/April timeframe and that this was “single worst software vendor I’ve
seen in 30 years in software”.


Akerna has a history of producing glitch-prone software – Nevada cancelled its contract
with MJ Freeway in 2017 due system crashes and security breaches. Soon after the
software was implemented in Washington regulators experienced problems with Leaf
Data, and Akerna repeatedly failed to remedy the issues. These recurrent problems
disrupted sales, frustrating commercial licensees (high numbers of customer complaints
can be found in media reports, we’ve aggregated samples here). The exasperation of
the regulators is evident in the document:


“From the beginning, the project struggled with vendor management, scope
management, quality management, stakeholder management and organizational
change management. WSLCB developed several iterations of mitigations and
remediations of project issues. While those areas under control of WSLCB made
steady progress, the project was not able to overcome release quality issues, which
was the responsibility of the vendor.”


The Washington contract was ~10% of KERN’s FY19 revenues. However, this doesn’t
account for the state’s commercial vendors who were compelled to purchase MJ
Platform and Akerna’s consulting services. The commercial and consulting businesses
generated 37% and 22% of FY19 revenues respectively. And while Akerna doesn’t
provide state level detail for the MJ Platform or consulting businesses, given that only
three states use Leaf Data, Akerna’s commercial business in Washington is likely
significant. If we conservatively assume that Washington accounts for 5-10% of
commercial sales, the state could account for > 15% of total revenues.


Washington would be the second contract cancellation out of four state wins. Akerna
has already been facing competitive pressure in Washington from Dauntless, which
apparently handles 30-40% of Washington’s retail pot transactions.

Recent Utah Contract Won by Severely Underbidding


Akerna won a $10.4m Pennsylvania seed-to-sale contract in mid-2017 (we estimate
30% of FY19 sales). Leaf Data software has had similar problems to those seen in
Nevada and Washington, crashing in October 2017, August 2018 and September 2019
resulting in significant downtime for businesses and patients.


“The chronically glitchy computer system that forms the backbone of Pennsylvania's
medical marijuana program crashed Thursday morning, causing several dispensaries
to halt sales and turn away patients.”


“Medical marijuana patients across the state couldn’t buy medicines Tuesday due to
an update in a tracking software system that’s supposed to track sales, not prevent
them.”


The initial term for the Pennsylvania agreement is for five years beginning in April 2017.
However, the state can terminate the contract at any time with only a 30 day advance
notice. The contract gives Akerna exclusivity in the commercial market, requiring
commercial operators to use Akerna’s ERP offering. Given the numerous issues in
Pennsylvania and the complaints from vendors, it wouldn’t be surprising if the state
sought a different provider.


With its history of quality issues, Akerna appears to win contracts mainly by
underbidding competitors, creating legitimate concerns around its ability to achieve
profitability. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Akerna won the Pennsylvania
contract solely on price:


“MJ Freeway was awarded the $10.4 million contract, though it scored lower on
technical merits than its rivals. Despite at least two "catastrophic hacks," data
breaches, and other glitches, MJ Freeway won because it undercut the competition
by several million dollars, bid documents show.”


In August 2018, Akerna announced it had won a $1.3m Leaf Data contract with Utah.

Near Term Capital Raise


“Utah is preparing to strike a deal with a Denver-based software company to build the
digital backbone of the state’s emerging medical cannabis program, despite the
business’ problems with outages, crashes and hacks in other states… The vendor,
MJ Freeway, rose to the top largely by lowballing the competition — offering its
services for less than half the price of the other finalist for Utah’s five-year
contract...But the two states that have active contracts with MJ Freeway haven’t had
an easy time of it.”


Akerna won the 5-year Utah contract by offering 27% the quoted $5m estimated value
and less than half of competitor BioTrackTHC’s $3.5m asking price. An insider at
competitor BioTrackTHC told us it will be nearly impossible for KERN to generate profit
on this contract and given the disparity in bids, and we believe him. The company was
likely forced to bid at a massive discount to competition due to a steady stream of
negative press from the software failures in Nevada, Washington and Pennsylvania.


Akerna acquired Canadian Cannabis ERP provider Ample Organics in December 2019
for $45m ($5.7m in upfront cash, $32.3m in KERN shares plus $7.6m in additional
shares contingent on revenue targets). The price is a 5.2x multiple on CY20e sales of
$8.7m. Interestingly, Ample Organics had laid off 16% of its workforce last summer, with
the CEO noting weakness in the Canadian cannabis industry:


“There’s a lot … of turmoil happening. I think that capital is drying up in the space,
and really Ample is a bellwether for everything else that’s going on in the industry”.


While Akerna is guiding towards Ample being cash flow positive in 2Q20, given the
industry-wide issues highlighted by Ample’s CEO, it wouldn’t be surprising if the unit fell
short of its revenue and profitability targets. The risk associated with Ample’s
performance is amplified since Akerna is spending ~30% of its cash on the acquisition.

Valuation Appears High Given Level of Organic Growth


After the close of the Ample purchase and assuming a steady rate of burn of $3m a
quarter, Akerna will only have around $10m in cash by end 1Q20. But this doesn’t
account for the $2.4m Akerna committed to invest in solo sciences which it acquired in
the fourth quarter. The deal terms specify that Akerna will contribute at least $250K per
month to fund solo. Thus, Akerna may have less than two quarters of working capital by
the end of March. Also note that in the 10-Q for the September quarter, Akerna stated it
had signed three letters of intent for acquisitions. After the deals for solo sciences and
Ample, this leaves one more acquisition in the near term. The 10-Q for the December
quarter notes management believes it has enough cash to fund the business for the
next year, but after the latest acquisitions, the commitment to solo sciences and another
quarter of burn, we’d expect a going concern notification in the next quarterly
report. In our opinion this means a CY20 raise is very likely.


At a stock price of $7, Akerna is trading at 6x EV/LTM sales and 5x C2020 consensus
sales. Publicly traded comparables are difficult to find, but HELIX TCS (OTC:
OTCQB:HLIX) which acquired Akerna’s direct competitor BioTrackTHC in 2018 appears
to be the closest. Helix has two segments: software and physical security/guarding
which account for roughly 65% and 35% of revenues respectively. Growth in the lower
margin legacy security business is flat, while the higher margin software business grew
over 50% y-o-y in 2019. Helix is trading at ~3x EV/LTM sales, has slightly lower blended
gross margins than Akerna, but a larger compliance software footprint with 10 state
governments using BioTrackTHC seed-to-sale software and potentially similar or higher
organic growth (HLIX hasn’t provided revenue guidance yet but revenues have been
growing ~20%).


As of December, Akerna is guiding $27.5m in CY20 sales of which $8.7m is Ample
Organics. So management is targeting $18.8m ex-Ample which implies ~50% organic
growth. This seems rather aggressive as software revenues – Akerna’s stated growth
driver – have only grown at ~10% CAGR since 2017.

On February 12, Akerna reported earnings for the December quarter. Overall revenues,
helped by a 202% y-o-y increase in the lower margin consulting business, were in-line
with expectations. However, a jump in expenses caused a larger than expected loss and
stagnant bookings disappointed investors. The analyst at Alliance Global Partners
(AGP), the only sell-side firm publishing research on KERN, expressed his concern on
the call:


“The bookings on an annualized basis is about $400,000, just taking the number you
gave times 12. And that's similar to last quarter, and I think, excluding Ample
Organics, I think you've discussed MJ Platforms would -- you thought would grow
significantly, I believe, in the March quarter than even more in the June quarter. Is it
still reasonable to assume that March quarter will be much stronger than December,
given the bookings were similar? And this last quarter, we didn't see quite a pop in MJ
Platform sequentially?

Avoid Shares or Establish Short


Due to the slower growth in software, AGP took their CY20 revenue target down 22%,
from $27m to $21.3m which implies only 19% organic revenue growth ex-Ample. HLIX
has a similar growth rate (and higher in software) yet its stock is trading at a revenue
multiple less than half of KERN’s.


Source: Company financials


AGP assumes KERN will be cash flow positive in 2022 and that the company has
enough cash to get there. However, we believe AGP is underestimating Akerna’s
cash needs and the probability of a cash raise in 2020. Using AGP’s own estimated
CY20 quarterly loss figures (totaling $12.7m), and allowing for some non-cash
expenses, Akerna will have negative working capital by Q420. And all of this highlights
how crucial it is that Ample Organics meets its 2020 guidance. Any disappointment
from Ample will further stress an already thin balance sheet, opening up
scenarios with significantly more downside.

We have outlined two highly probably near-term risks: Washington contract cancellation
representing ~15% FY19 sales (likely correlated with a significant amount of commercial
contract revenues) and a near-term capital raise. Either alone would significantly impact
Akerna’s share price. Add these to the increasing uncertainty of Akerna’s largest
government contract (Pennsylvania at > 30% FY 19 sales), stagnant sequential
bookings during a critical growth phase in the cannabis ERP software market, and
legitimate concerns involving the profitability of new contracts (Utah for example) and
recent acquisitions of solo sciences and Ample Organics.


We believe shares are vulnerable here given these issues and a valuation that implies a
much higher level of growth and profitability. We recommend avoiding the stock or
establishing an opportunistic short. Factors limiting upside include 5.8m warrants
exercisable at $11.50 and ~3m shares currently restricted by a lock-up agreement
expiring in June 2020.
