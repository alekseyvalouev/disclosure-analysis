Radcom: Radically Misunderstood, Radically Overvalued - Part 2
Dec. 3, 2014 5:17 PM ET15 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Part 1 explained tech company Radcom’s predictive chart and nearly unobservable
insider selling. The Part 2 supportive evidence shows, among other things,
promotions and the analysts’ estimate beat were misinterpreted.


In this highly competitive software niche, established competitors’ R&D budgets will
smash Radcom’s budget. A stock offering may be forthcoming if Radcom intends to
try to gain a market foothold.


Radcom is among a group of companies owned by brothers who also count three
publicly traded losers among their companies - two have dropped to $1 and change.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


In the first part of TheStreetSweeper's two-part series on Israel-based software company
Radcom (NASDAQ:RDCM), we described the tech company's negative trends and
predictive chart.


Now, Part 2 highlights the top three supporting reasons we expect Radcom will follow that
chart:


1. Hype and the misunderstood analyst expectation beat.


Shares jumped 44 percent on the report Radcom revenue rose about a million bucks last
quarter to $6 million, while earnings per share beat analysts' expectations (10 cents actual
EPS; 3 cents analyst estimate).


But an analyst we spoke with speculated that the low analyst estimate may have been due
to either a lack of information about Radcom or a desire to prep Radcom for a possible
upcoming stock offering.


Indeed, it seems the sole true analyst covering the company for H.C. Wainwright put a
"buy" and a $7.50 price target on Radcom last July. But the analyst puts a "buy" rating on
most stocks.

There are examples here - a $5 price target on Finjan (NASDAQ:FNJN), now ~$3 - and
here - a $50 price target on Silicom (NASDAQ:SILC), now ~$36.


And the charts below show other stock picks have gone bad, too:


Local Corp., LOCM, Analyst's Target Price=$4


Enthusiasm over Radcom's hype surrounding a revenue bump - "Our business is stronger
than ever," CEO David Ripstein told investors - made the stock jump overnight from ~$6
to $9 following the Oct. 29 earnings call. Listen to the conference call here.


Despite the elation and stock run-up, Radcom still can't seem to attract excitement among
institutional holders - or even its biggest fan.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2728635-radcom-radically-misunderstood-radically-overvalued-part-2 3/9


It seems Radcom's sole analyst still has not upped that 4-month-old price target of $7.50.


Investors may find other viewpoints on Radcom here.


2. Dead ahead: Unless Radcom intends to tread in place, watch out for a stock
offering.


Though cash has improved somewhat to $4.6 million, that's not enough to operate and
grow.


Tech companies want to market to big companies. That takes stacks of money. So
Radcom would need to hire engineers, researchers, marketers and distributors to improve
and expand its one-product line - which launched 9 months ago - and then market any
new ones.


A multi-million dollar equity raise would likely dilute current investors' shares. Yet, in this
notably very competitive space, it would not be enough.


The raise would fail to boost Radcom's current yearly R&D budget of ~ $4 million to more
than a tiny fraction of that available to numerous established U.S. rivals. For example,
JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) spends $296 million on R&D.


So Radcom will find it very tough to capture the necessary accounts with big telecom
providers in the future. Radcom itself warns on page 14 about the additional burden of a
typical 9- to 18-month evaluation process required to get a foot in the door with large
telecom carriers.


So why would a big telecom provider such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) want to buy products
from a tiny, unknown, under-financed entity like Radcom? It would only make sense to go
with tried-and-true giants like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM).


3. Altogether, Yehuda Zisapel and Zohar Zisapel own more than 34 percent of
Radcom's ordinary shares. Three of the brothers' companies have been hit by
decimated stock values.


The Zisapel brothers are sons of a shoe salesman who grew up to become successful
entrepreneurs in Israel when they founded the Rad group of companies, including
Radcom. Radcom's sisters include US publicly traded Silicom, Radware, RiT Technologies
and Ceragon Networks.


But, other than Radware, these public companies have bombed for investors. The
combined chart below shows how these companies' stocks have fallen apart.

In the past year alone, the share prices of the three companies have plummeted by 22
percent, 39 percent and even 64 percent.


Two of these stocks fetch just a few cents more than $1 per share. We wouldn't be
surprised if Radcom eventually follows the trend set by its cheap sisters.


Conclusion:


Even under the most blindly optimistic of scenarios, we believe Radcom is moving toward
the wrong side of the business equation recently described by a millionaire entrepreneur
and current Shark Tank television star.


"There's two types of companies," Robert Herjavec recently said on Shark Tank, "The
quick. And the dead."


But the aging Radcom - which has "generated significant losses" the past three years,
expresses questions of continuing as a going concern, is now trying to break into a highly
competitive niche using hype and a none-too-distinctive product, looks poised to sell
stock, has lost ~76 percent of its value, and sports a negative predictive chart - has proved
one thing...


This company is definitely not quick.

you need a part III where you look at the actual product and determine if it could be a better mouse trap and so will
create a beaten path to their RAD door. That could mean customers or potential suitors.


Its really about the product.

The Zisapel's have also sold many companies to larger companies and Radcom has a hot product that is in the white
hot NFV space and could also get taken out for a nice premium at any moment. They have also had a few deals with
this new software product to Tier 1 players including just a week ago a $4.3 Million dollar deal and the visibility for the
next couple quarters is excellent. Also Radcom is currently transitioning from a hardware play to more of a software
play with recurring revenues in their Maveriq IQ CEM product platform. Radcom also has deals with the leaders
including Intel which means big boys are gladly doing business with Radcom.

So now you are comparing RDCM to Local at what point do the men in the white jackets come for you.


So hype and misunderstood expectations beat and a buy rating of $7.50 added last July before anyone knew how
their new software would be accepted in the market.


Well here is the bottom line,:

RADCOM Reports Strong Results For Q3 2014: Excellent Reception Of MaveriQ CEM Solution Grows Revenues
26% To $6M With Record Net Income, $0.11 EPS (Non-GAAP)


Here are some pretty simple numbers that clearly explain RDCM without fud.


Q3 2014 vs Q3 2013


Revenues $6,007 vs $4,758


Gross margin increases to 66.0% from 50.4%


Net profit (loss) (GAAP) $776 vs $(1,148)


Net profit (loss) (non-GAAP) 872 vs $(1,017)


Cash & equivalents (at end of period) $4,509 vs $1,393


These are actually very easy to understand and yes they beat big time and look at the increase in cash from
collectibles.

Your entire premise is now just comical ye smaybe it will drop alittle on weak hands but insiders own 40% of this co so
I think that float may be getting tight and any news can send it rocketing.

In a recent Seeking Alpha article by Sonya Colberg of The Street Sweeper stated how Radcom Inc. (RDCM)
reminded her of PhotoMedex (PHMD). After reading the article they wrote on Seeking Alpha, I see no resemblance.
First and foremost RDCM has no debt nor has it made any acquisition. There is no loan to default on, in fact Radcom
is cash flow positive and is reporting record net income and net margin. RDCM is in no risk of product lawsuits and
has no insider labeled “a thug”. There is absolutely no correlation between PHMD and RDCM. I find the article to be
sensational and degrading.


The insider selling reported in the Seeking Alpha article is not an issue. Every company that is publicly traded has
insider sales. The insiders sold fewer than 100,000 shares and this is not a warning signal considering that insiders
own over 3 million shares. Observe any public company and you will find insiders selling shares for a number of
personal financial reasons such as diversification, buying a home, paying for a child’s education, preparing for
retirement among other reasons. The reason companies go public is to fund further growth and for the employees and
initial investors to reap the rewards of their hard work.


Radcom is part of the Rad group which I recommend reading about. The cooperation among its members involves
sharing technology, market channels and market information. They initially receive administrative and marketing
assistance from the Rad Group, which lowers operating costs. Employees often share in the profits and the critical
decision-making process, are thereby highly motivated to ensure the success of the enterprise. Zohar Zisapel is
considered the “Bill Gates of Israel” and together with his brother Yehuda Zisapel (who has been called “the world’s

most successful incubator” of telecom related start-ups by business 2.0 magazine) founded the Rad Group. Four RAD
group companies trade on the NASDAQ market: Cergon Networks, Radware, Radcom and Silicom. Total sales of the
group were $1.2 billion in 2011.


Radcom is transforming itself from hardware to a software solutions provider for the expanding telecommunications
area. Looking at the most recent quarterly earning gives reason for the rise in stock price. The planned rise in gross
margin is taking shape increasing to 66% for the quarter. As the lower margin, older projects are completed the gross
margin is expected to increase up to the 75% range. David Ripstein President and CEO states:


"These outstanding results derive from the market's exceedingly strong reception of MaveriQ, our unique software-
based CEM solution, whose superior 'anti-churn' capabilities are being recognized by Tier I & Tier II 4G/LTE/Data
service providers throughout the world. This capability has given us entry into more and larger tenders than ever
before, and we are enjoying a strong win rate. We feel well positioned to grow in step with the LTE build-out, a trend
we believe has the power to continue driving our results throughout 2015."


When questioned about sales of the new software product in the recent conference call Mr. Ripstein stated that 30%
of sales in the quarter were from the newly introduced MaveriQ. Since they have multiple customers using the old
technology it allows them to approach existing clients and offer them the ability to upgrade to MaveriQ. I believe they
have a compelling reason to upgrade which I will go into more detail.


An article in SDNZONE by Peter Bernstein he explains the importance of Radcom’s new MaveriQ product. On
Febuary 3rd when MaveriQ was introduced “Radcom says is the industry’s first NFV-ready probe-based software
solution, and is aimed directly at giving operators clear visibility into all quality aspects of high-speed 4G LTE, VoLTE
and LTE-Advanced networks.” I won’t go into detail however it is important to state that telecom provider’s biggest
hurdle facing the industry is churn rate. MaveriQ was created to solve that problem and offer providers the ability to
upgrade their current networks within weeks of installing the new MaveriQ product.


On Auqust 27th Radcom announced two expansions for LATAM tier 1 operators. These are RADCOM customers with
mobile installations, who are now adding on a solution for their fixed NGN VoIP networks. "Our ability to monitor Fixed
and Mobile networks using the same solution is a major advantage for our customers; having a system in place
means saving time and money for new VoIP deployments," said Mr. Ronen Hovav, RADCOM's President Americas.
"We at RADCOM see such expansions in the LATAM region as a natural development, in line with RADCOM's
strategy for this area."


On September 8th Radcom announced it has integrated Intel® Ethernet XL710 controller into RADCOM’s MaveriQ
Customer Experience Management solution.


”We are excited to see the results of our close collaboration with Intel” said Eyal Harari, VP Products and Marketing.
“MaveriQ’s unique software-based architecture enables RADCOM to take advantage of the Fortville technology and
to deliver a quantum leap in performance, only 6 months after the product’s initial release.”


In the Peter Bernstein article mentioned above, the direction toward NFV-ready networks is the future for the telecom
industry and Radcom is building its product around this transformation. Intel also recognizes the abilities of Radcom
and made this statement regarding Radcoms new product development:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2728635-radcom-radically-misunderstood-radically-overvalued-part-2 8/9


“Intel® Network Builders participants such as RADCOM have early access to new Intel technologies to give them the
opportunity to bring new innovations to market quickly,” said Renu Navale, Ecosystem Program Manager for Intel’s
Communications & Storage Infrastructure Group. “By being a part of the program, RADCOM’s MaveriQ is able to fully
support the Intel® Ethernet XL710 controller as soon as it is released in order to meet customers’ demand for
increased performance in a virtualized environment.”


MaveriQ has been designed for current telecom systems yet giving the ability to handle the future massive volumes of
high speed data expected to develop in the coming years. MaveriQ is a software-based solution which can be rapidly
deployed in a virtualized environment. This ability will allow telecom providers to reduce both operating expense and
capital expense. It is no wonder that telecom providers are willing to upgrade to the new MaveriQ platform.


On November 20th Radcom announced the signing of a $4.3 million purchase order from an existing Teir-1 customer.
“The scale of this order is seen in the Customer Experience investments that large operators have begun making to
gain an edge in competitive markets – and RADCOM, with our breakthrough MaveriQ solution, stands to benefit,”
commented Mr. David Ripstein, RADCOM’s President and CEO. “We are gratified by the customer’s ‘vote of
confidence’ in our partnership and technology, and believe that it will lead to additional expansions of their RADCOM
deployment. In parallel, we believe that many other operators – both existing RADCOM customers and potential new
ones, will be increasing their investments in the Customer Experience over the next several years, and this represents
a significant opportunity for our Company.”

Well written, thanks.

I think that a "longer term" chart would be helpful showing that 
Silicom has gone from $5 in 2009 to $36.59 up $1.15 today (it was $1 a share in 2003) 
Radware was $3 in 2009 and now $20.88 and $.32 from a 52 week high


It is unfortunate that wall street attracts greed, and anyone can write a article with little knowledge and even less
scruples.


The three points mentioned are hearsay: 1. an analyst in cahoots with Radcom? or 2. A stock offering to increase
funds to get verizon as a customer? and 3. Zisapel brothers decimated by dropping stock prices?


Just a wild guess that the analyst is not doing covert operations with Radcom. As for Verizon, well they are not trying
to penetrate the US market, they are in Asia and South america. They have existing customers they are selling to.
And lastly, the brothers are multi-millionaires and have dramatically increased their wealth and investors wealth as
well.


Guess you can hire just about anyone to write misleading articles for "money".
