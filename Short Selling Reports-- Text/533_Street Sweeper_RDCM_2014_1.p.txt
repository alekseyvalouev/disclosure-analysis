Radcom: Radically Misunderstood, Radically Overvalued
Dec. 2, 2014 10:37 AM ET14 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Insiders are selling Radcom stock â€“ often at about $5/ share. Most investors have
missed these Form 144 sales at much lower prices than the current price.


Radcom appears to be following the trends shown in its historical chart, below.


The chart, combined with supporting details of insider selling and three other top
signals explained in our pending Part 2 suggest Radcom cannot gain relevance.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Radcom Inc. (RDCM) has turned radical, with its long-ignored stock ripping to the double-
digit levels reached in 2006 and earlier.


The Tel Aviv, Israel-based company switched from its money-losing hardware business
about nine months ago. Investors went mad when Radcom pulled its finances out of the
red as it introduced software designed to address customer service problems for telecom
companies.


In fact, investors inflicted with Rad fever have plunked down three times more for Radcom
than other industry stocks.


But there's trouble ahead.


Indeed, the company's stock historically rises on hype, while it drops on insider sales and
large private stock sales. Check out the chart below showing the rise and fall of Radcom's
stock price - a chart that predicts Radcom shares will likely collapse again in the near
future.

The chart shows that Radcom stock rocketed on hype about a Chinese company
choosing a Radcom product (March 2010). When investors learned Radware would be
acquired (September 2010), the sympathy hype continued to push up Radcom's stock.


Then the stock collapsed as the CEO and the vice president began dumping shares. The
stock took another hit from the April 2013 PIPE deal - a $3.5 million private stock offering.
Overall, Radcom's value plummeted in a few months from $14 to $4.


Radcom could not seem to step off that value-eating path as its hardware business lost
ground. The stock finally took a teeth-shattering fall off the cliff on Halloween 2012,
dropping to 2 bucks and change. So stock once worth $1,000 sunk to a worth of about
$145.


So what does the chart predict of the stock now?


We're seeing hype again followed by the upward zig of the stock.


Then the CEO, two vice presidents and a director sell stock again. The stock zags
downward, and gets jazzed once again by hype (Radcom's financial report and MaveriQ
product purchase order announcement). Now watch for the drop.


Next, let's look at that insider selling - and why most investors have missed this key
supporting factor to the predictive chart.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2724425-radcom-radically-misunderstood-radically-overvalued 3/7


Insiders have been selling Radcom stock - at about $5 per share - while flying under
the radar. And we anticipate more selling ahead.


CEO David Ripstein and other insiders have dumped tens of thousands of shares of their
company in the last 11 months. And for far less than the current price.


But average investors have missed all those sales.


Why? Those are Form 144 sales that are not available on Yahoo and SEC Edgar. So
investors without Bloomberg access are denied access to this valuable key to making
investment decisions.


The charts below show more than 20 separate sales that most investors missed
completely.


All that insider selling - predominantly at ~ $5 compared with shares currently fetching
about $11 - raises red flags.


First, it suggests insiders don't trust the future prospects of their own company.


Second, insiders will likely sell more shares because of the current stock price spike. In
fact, this selling sentiment may well extend further. After all, Radcom's filings specifically
warn, "we may decide to raise additional funds in 2014."


Investors may find other viewpoints on Radcom here.

Conclusion:


We've covered many dicey companies and this one eerily reminds us of PhotoMedex
(PHMD, then $15.49, now ~$1.70 )Radcom shares are running about $11, a radical 84
percent jump since October. Based on the historical chart and jaw-dropping signals, we
expect Radcom stock to drop back to reality.


In fact, we wouldn't be surprised to see the stock drop back to the $5.50 level it fetched
before the hype ever started. And that price level is very generous.


Don't miss the next installment of our Radcom series, coming soon. In Part 2, we list the
top three reasons we expect Radcom will follow the trend shown by the chart.

I'll be looking forward to Part 2...maybe it will include some fundamental analysis.

I will say this stock has received much love lately and a bear thesis could be healthy for long investors, myself
included. The next two quarters seem almost too visible to be true. But after this last ER the stock acted just
as it should have...people were waiting for Radcom to turn the corner and it did. Now it's just a matter of
continuing to execute.

Do you know anything about the company or do you actually rely on charts and insider sales (which are
meaningless)?

You had to go back all they way to 2010, how about you use current customer wins and facts about their new
software.


Sonya, you never respond ever to any posts why is that?


Oh yeah you have no comebacks to actuals facts?


02 Dec 2014, 11:17 AM


WallStPirate
Just to post facts to balance your fud:


http://yhoo.it/12mFeAu


Massive growth, new client wins, new software much needed in the industry.


Forget your story including old old old news going back to 2010, read my post, actuals facts with current info.

Management owns approximately 40% of the company and the selling has been minor in relation. This article is
lacking in fundamental analysis and is just hyperbole, trying to make negative associations with other stocks just for a
scare tactic. The company has transformed in many ways including moving from a hardware player to a software
player and with recurring revenues in their model. Their new product has strong momentum and has higher gross
margins. Recently Broadcom bought a small private company in the CEQ space and the space has been on fire
lately. The information about the 144's is however a useful fact brought out that many may not be aware of, but again,
small amounts in relation to what they own and if they sold at 5 leaving 100% on the table so far I doubt they sold for
any nefarious reasons. When they sold at 5 they knew they had good quarters coming and the upcoming quarter
looks strong as well based on their order flows

scary, but that is your problem. Using this space to talk down your most assuredly losing bet is unethical.


Comparing the current technical action to what took place 2/3 years ago, when a) the company was a money losing
company and b) when the entire small-cap space got clobbered (I know, I was on the receiving end of that), is an
atrocious use of space. The insiders own over 3 million shares and the ~100,000 shares that were sold (mostly by the
CEO) over the past year at much lower prices does NOT indicate the shares are going on a round trip. Just the
opposite most likely. Talk to us when Ripstein and Zisapel sell 6-figure lots and growth starts flattening.

"Insiders have been selling Radcom stock - at about $5 per share - "  
"And for far less than the current price." 
"All that insider selling - predominantly at ~ $5 compared with shares currently fetching about $11 - raises red flags." 
It's almost like you're trying to imply they were selling shares at $5 when they were significantly above $5, the fact is
even a month ago the shares were selling for less, like on Nov. 7 shares closed at 8.80 while the 144 sale you have
listed for that day was for an average price of 8.68, not quite as bad as 5 vs. 11. And all those shares you have listed
as selling around 5 dollars were back when shares were actually selling for around 5 dollars. The way you have it
stated is a pretty sensationalist way of stating it. 
Micro Cap also makes a good point, the selling is pretty minor in comparison to overall holdings. 
Your thesis could be restated as "Insiders selling minor amounts of stock at market prices over the last several years",
doesn't quite sound so bad then.

To the author, 
I can see why you'd look at this stock as a potential short after such a big gain, but insider selling is rarely significant. 
This example in particular. 
As mentioned in other replies, sales volume was relatively low in comparison to overall holdings and recent selling
came after a significant gain. 
I figured one of these bearish articles would come along soon enough.  
I took advantage of the dip and bought in the low 10's.

This is classic short seller knocking a stock down to make a quick buck! 
The funny part is the disclosure below! TheStreeSweeper holds a short position in RDCM and at the same breath
they say it prohibits its members to take financial positions on stock they cover! Total bullshit.  
I have no position in this stock, but what ThestreetSweeper does seems borderline illegal to me. Maybe they should
sweep streets rather than giving financial advice! People who sold their holdings based on this article are fools!

My Good Dr, I am on your side (see my previous post), but I suppose TECHNICALLY they might not be
violating their disclosure if the editor is not an owner. However that doesn't preclude the owners from telling
the editor to write a short article on a given stock.

Also, don't forget that Form 144's are for "proposed sales" and the shares may or may not have been sold. Many
people ignore them since often times shares are never sold after these filings and have no meaning whatsoever. If
after 90 days pass and a sale is not made or partial sale, then a new Form 144 can be filed. Management owns about
40% of the stock, so even if all of the filed shares have indeed been sold its a small portion and I think says nothing
about how they feel about future prospects. Its prudent to sell some shares as the stock rises and automatically every
year. I think with 40% ownership, their interests are firmly aligned with common shareholders

Their entire premise is based upon sales of shares, no talk about their recurring revenue stream and new
customer wins.


They know how to time hit pieces and people follow them to attack and buy back at a cheaper price.

Beware of "short & distort" schemes. Seems someone else has been tracking the Street Sweeper.
