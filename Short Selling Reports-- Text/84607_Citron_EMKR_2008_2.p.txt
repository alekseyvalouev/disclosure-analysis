“And we would have gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for you meddling kids!”


The Coalition of the Willing


- Famous Scooby Doo line


Citron has observed with keen interest developments at
Emcore (NASDAQ:EMKR) since our first report March 18th
and follow-up March 25th. There are a few significant
events, all of which point to a ménage trios of convenience
between Emcore, Green and Gold Energy and the head
cheerleader analyst at Jefferies & Co.


Emcore needs Green and Gold Energy because it is the largest “customer” of
record for its terrestrial solar products, representing 80% or more of its “backlog” for
solar technology. Emcore desperately needs the appearance of a growing solar
business as it needs to raise huge amounts of capital to cover operational losses.


Green and Gold Energy needs Emcore because it is a tiny, thinly capitalized
Australian business trying to create the appearance that it is a major player in the
solar business. Green and Gold uses its purported Emcore purchase order as a
credential to establish credibility. Green and Gold’s CEO has a multi-year track
record of trying to raise money by selling promises which never come to fruition,
including perpetual machine kits and rooftop solar electric devices. There is little or
no public information available on any of Green and Gold’s “licensee” customers.

Analyze This


The Rain in Spain


Jefferies & Co recently underwrote Emcore’s private placement, and sees a
lucrative cash-raise offering coming over the horizon.


Jefferies analyst John Lau needs to issue a big mea culpa to Wall St.


On March 11, he states clearly, “GGE is an important customer to Emcore.” He goes on
to mention either Green and Gold or the Suncube over 12 times in a 3 page report to
Wall St. There is no financial model included in the March 11 report.


And then on March 27, only two weeks later (after the Citron report of course), Lau
publishes a report that is reminiscent of the glossy “scammy” mailers you might receive
on an OTC company. The report is full of nice pictures of companies who are not
Emcore and do not have business with Emocre…..yet not even one mention of
Emcore’s major contract with Green and Gold. But it gets worse. In the same report,
Lau’s financial model grossly understates Emcore’s losses, paints a picture of its
emerging into profitability when there is not a scintilla of evidence that it is about to do
so, and thereby completely misrepresents its financial situation.


There are several shocking deficiencies in Lau’s model, include understating operating
income, net loss, and SG&A by all close to 100%... this is either an unheard of oversight
or someone is really trying to pull a fast one. Even better, Lau’s projected share count
into 2009 is lower than the company’s current share count. Someone has a lot of
explaining to do here.


Emcore and Green and Gold were both scheduled speakers at the much-anticipated
CPV conference in Madrid. Green and Gold’s presentation is laced with preposterous
material misrepresentations, and states a client list of companies who have no public
presence. Meanwhile, Emcore claims GGE as its largest terrestrial solar photovoltaic
customer. Emcore has done nothing to create accurate disclosure to the US investing
public as to the actual condition of its solar business or the reliance that can be placed
on GGE’s claims.


By appearing in the same venue with Green and Gold, and by having gone on record
with a “To Whom it May Concern” letter expressing “support” for GGE, Emcore is in fact
aiding and abetting the fraud perpetrated on the market by Green and Gold Energy.

Let's Make a Deal


CITRON CALLS UPON EMCORE AND JEFFERIES TO COME CLEAN


Danzilio Letter [PDF]


Citron notes that “backlog” is the one financial metric about a company’s current
business that is not typically audited. Therefore, it is especially subject to being used in
a misleading way.


Therefore, today Citron calls on the SEC to investigate Emcore’s public statements
about its solar technology business, and calls on Emcore to go on record to correct its
statements with regard to its “backlog” of terrestrial solar orders — and specifically, that
percentage of orders which are from customers who can be relied upon to pay for their
purchases.


SEC Letter on Emocre [PDF]


Subsequent to the CPV conference in Spain, Emcore has announced two deals:


Buying additional fiber assets from Intel (INTC), and1.


A solar deal in China.2.


As to the former, Citron notes that this follow-on asset purchase requires zero cash, just
some freshly minted stock, which Emcore has in good supply. Citron observes that Intel
is not in the habit of giving away attractive, profitable businesses for free. We believe
that as these integration and operational numbers begin to flow through Emcore’s
financial statements, the gusher of red ink will intensify. No doubt Emcore’s quarter will
be heralded by headlines of “Record Revenues”… but without sating its ravenous
appetite for the public’s investment money, the losses generated by these “record
revenues” are simply not sustainable.


As to the latter, Citron notes that aside from the slippery accountable-to-nobody future
promises, the stated deal is for 60kW of solar technology. While no terms are
announced, but by extrapolating from previously published numbers about Emcore’s
backlog, it's possible to compute a value of 60kW at about (……drum roll…..) $18,000.
…nothing more than a college science project.

The only way investors can validate a technology as a business is if we see valid orders
from customers. Where are the commercial-sized valid orders from Emcore? Green and
Gold is the only major customer. Emcore has gone out of its way to perpetrate the fraud
by not only writing letters of recommendation for Green and Gold to induce investors,
but more importantly by lying to its own investors by stating in a press release, “Green
and Gold Energy is a world leading CPV system provider.”


In our next report, we will show how this whole circle of hype is not new for CEO
Reuben Richards, but rather he has been promoting fictional backlogs and unfulfilled
promises for years.
