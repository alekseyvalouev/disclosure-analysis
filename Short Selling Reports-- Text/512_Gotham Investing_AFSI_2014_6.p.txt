AmTrust: Just-Released Statutory Filings Reveal Substantial
Deterioration
Nov. 21, 2014 9:14 AM ET53 comments
by: Gotham Investing


Summary


3q14 Statutory Filings Show Substantial Adverse Case Reserve Development (Less
Discretion).


Instead of Taking Charge, AFSI Reduced IBNR Reserves (More Discretion).


IBNR Should INCREASE, Not Decrease When Case Reserves Develop Adversely
(Incurred Method).


Significant Implications for Earnings, Book Value, & Statutory Capital.


Case Reserves vs. IBNR Reserves:


AmTrust Financial Services Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI), like all P&C insurers, must set up
reserves for the ultimate amount they expect to pay policyholders for claims filed (loss and
loss adjustment expense reserves). The two components of Loss and LAE reserves are
case reserves and IBNR reserves.


Below is the definition of case reserves, which demonstrates that an insurer can adjust its
estimate of severity, but not frequency, since the claim has already been filed.


A case reserve is an estimate of the amount for which a particular claim will
ultimately be settled or adjudicated. Insurers will also set reserves for their entire
books of business to estimate their future liabilities.


In contrast, IBNR is much less certain in that the both the frequency and severity of claims
must be estimated. Not only that, the severity of these projected events must be estimated
without any information about the specific "incurred but not reported" claims. This provides
insurers MUCH more latitude in reserving for IBNR.


An estimate of the liability for claim-generating events that have taken place but
have not yet been reported to the insurer or self-insurer. The sum of IBNR losses
plus incurred losses provides an estimate of the total eventual liabilities for losses
during a given period.

YTD 2014 Reserve Development:


Technology Insurance Company ("TIC") is AFSI's largest US subsidiary, and it participates
in 20% of AFSI's US underwriting operations (net of excess of loss insurance) through
intra-company reinsurance agreements. Another 10% of the underwriting is retained by
the US subsidiary that issued the policy (except TIC cedes 10% of policies to Rochdale
Insurance Company), and 70% is ceded to AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ("AII"),
AFSI's reinsurance captive in Bermuda. Maiden Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ: MHLD)
participates in 40% of the 70% assumed by AII, leaving AII with 30%. As a result of this
structure, TIC serves as a good proxy for how AFSI's US operations are doing.


The excerpt below is from TIC's 3q14 statutory filing, and it reveals that TIC's estimate of
case reserves were far too low at 12/31/13 which indicates AFSI is under-estimating the
severity of claims filed. However, TIC reported favorable development because they drew
down IBNR reserves by even more than case reserves had to be increased.


Incurred Method:


AFSI discloses in their 10-K that they use the "Incurred Method":


We began writing workers' compensation in 2001. In order to establish IBNR reserves, we
project ultimate losses by accident year both through use of our historical experience, and
the use of industry experience by state. Our consulting actuary projects ultimate losses in
two different ways (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2701905-amtrust-just-released-statutory-filings-reveal-substantial-deterioration 3/18


Quarterly Incurred Development Method (Use of AmTrust Factors). Quarterly
incurred loss development factors are derived from our historical, cumulative
incurred losses by accident month. These factors are then applied to the latest
actual incurred losses and DCC by month to estimate ultimate losses and DCC,
based on the assumption that each accident month will develop to estimated
ultimate cost in a similar manner to prior years. There is a substantial amount of
judgment involved in this method.


Yearly Incurred Development (Use of National Council on Compensation Insurance,
Inc. ("NCCI") Industry Factors by State). Yearly incurred loss development factors
are derived from either NCCI's annual statistical bulletin or state bureaus. These
factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and DCC by year by
state to estimate ultimate losses and DCC, based on the assumption that each year
will develop to an estimated ultimate cost similar to the industry development by year
by state.


Each method produces estimated ultimate loss and DCC expenses net of amounts
that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers. Our consulting actuary
estimates a range of ultimate losses, along with a selection that gives more weight to
the results from our monthly development factors and less weight to the results from
industry development factors.


We establish IBNR reserves for our workers' compensation segment by determining
an "ultimate loss pick," which is our estimate of our net loss ratio for a specific
period, based on actual incurred losses and application of loss development factors.
We estimate our ultimate incurred loss and DCC for a period by multiplying the
ultimate loss pick for the period by the earned premium for the period. From that
total, we subtract actual paid loss and DCC and actual case reserves for reported
losses. The remainder constitutes our IBNR reserves. On a monthly basis, our
consulting actuary reviews our IBNR reserves. On a monthly basis, we review our
determination of our ultimate loss pick.


In other words, the ultimate loss pick for a given accident year is a multiple of the actual
case reserves incurred. Therefore, adverse development in case reserves should cause
IBNR to increase as of a given date. Instead, AFSI is doing the opposite.


Therefore, the component of reserves where AFSI has less accounting discretion
(case reserves) was severely deficient. To cover this up, AFSI reduced reserves
where they have more accounting discretion (IBNR reserves) IN SPITE OF their

stated actuarial methodologies.


Comparison to Tower Group International, Ltd. ("TWGP") 3q13:


Comparing TIC's YTD development with that of Tower Insurance Company of New York
("TICNY") in 3q13 is instructive. When TWGP took a $365m reserve charge, TICNY's
case and IBNR developed worse by $16.6 million (14.9%) and $40.7 million (47.8%),
respectively (i.e.: increased severity of case prompted increases in to the IBNR).


IBNR reserves that was 2.5x more than their case reserve charge (as one would expect).


Had AFSI merely not bled down IBNR reserves, earnings would have been significantly
lower for AFSI.


Had AFSI used the same methodology as TWGP for estimating the reserve charge
needed, TIC's capital likely would have been wiped out and AFSI would be in breach
credit agreements and regulatory capital requirements.


I believe this example demonstrates the extreme nature of AFSI's accounting shenanigans
with respect to its US operations YTD in 2014.


NYDFS Conditions & Implications


As I discussed in "AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I",
the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") imposed conditions upon
AmTrust in conjunction with ACP Re's acquisition of TWGP. Among them were
requirements to increase actuarial resources and provide the NYDFS with "any and all"
financial information it requests:

Comments (53)


In accordance with an actuarial plan (the "Plan") submitted to and approved by the
Department, AmTrust will strengthen its actuarial resources to ensure by year-end
2015 that its actuarial scale and capabilities are commensurate with its size. This will
entail both hiring more actuaries, and ensuring that those currently on staff are
adequately credentialed. Further, in accordance with the Plan, AmTrust will better
institutionalize the role of its internal actuaries by creating a Global Chief Actuary
position, as well as Global Chief Reserving and Pricing Actuaries, all of whom will be
integrated into AmTrust's executive management team.


AmTrust shall, beginning with the month ending September 30, 2014, and for a
period of not less than three years, provide to the Department any and all financial
information as the Department may request.


AFSI's reserves will almost certainly be one of the first areas that regulators request
additional information, and if the answers are inadequate (as I expect they would be),
regulators may require AFSI to increase reserves at its regulated insurance subsidiaries,
thus reducing earnings, book value, and surplus. At the same time, capital requirements
would go up to support the larger reserve number - a "double whammy".


Finally, AM Best is typically very sensitive to insurers reporting adverse development. If
they notice the case deterioration or AFSI is forced to take charges to replenish IBNR, AM
Best will almost surely have AFSI in their sights for a ratings downgrade.

Amtrust seems to be following industry norms here and your interpretation isn't quite accurate. For example, see the
Berkley Insurance Company Part 3 for 9/30/2014. It shows the company had $728m of case reserves developed
versus $778m of IBNR savings. Amtrust has 58.6% of its US stat reserves equal to IBNR versus WR Berkley at
54.9% as of 9/30/14. There's nothing alarming in this data.

Author’s reply »  Berkley is growing premiums at ~10% whereas AFSI is growing at ~70% (unheard of in the
insurance industry). That makes AFSI's policies rather unseasoned and one would expect the IBNR to be
much higher as a result.


21 Nov 2014, 07:46 PM 


ajhcle
Would it not make a difference that the majority of the business they write is low risk business with prior loss
experience? Second, a substantial portion of their business is from renewal rights acquisitions where the loss
history of the policy is well known. AmTrust policies have historically had a very high number of med only
claims (which is good).


22 Nov 2014, 07:07 PM 


Gotham Investing, Contributor
Author’s reply »  One can't grow at 60% and have "prior loss experience". They can may have gotten it with
Sequoia and FNIC, but those also came with significant balance sheet risk.


Also, perhaps you mean "low hazard", but "low risk" will depend on pricing and industry checks consistently
confirm that AFSI prices below peers, regardless of the hazard class.


24 Nov 2014, 08:27 PM 


User 19200701
@ddddr224234 - the difference being that Berkley Insurance does not have substantial preexisting questions about
the strength of their reserves. It appears to me from Gotham's previous articles that Amtrust may have been inflating
their results at the expense of sound reserving and this new information is certainly meant to strengthen their case.
We know that increased scrutiny is coming soon for Amtrust. When this happens any inconsistencies will be brought
to light and any illusory value this company holds will vanish into smoke, along with the accompanying value of all
those left holding the stock. I would stay away from Amtrust until a clearer picture emerges. You do not want to be the
one holding it if or when the fall comes and Amtrust potentially has a LONG way to fall.


21 Nov 2014, 11:10 AM 


User 19200701
@ddddr224234 - Also, I forgot to ask. As you seem to only respond to articles on Amtrust and nothing else. Do you
have a vested interest in this company? Do you work for the company or have substantial holdings with them? I can
think of no other reason offhand why you would constantly be looking to dismiss any questions about this company.

It seems to me that you are on the other end of the critique spectrum, seeking to sink AFSI. You seem to have
already assumed Amtrust's worth is only "illusory value". Do you also have any vested interest in shorting this
company, such as the author ( this being his 4rth hit article)?


21 Nov 2014, 01:04 PM 


User 19200701
I have no interest in shorting this company and do not intent to take any position either way with this
company. I have not been following this company long, however the reason it is now on my radar is I
purchased shares in late September of this year on what appeared to be very solid fundamentals. However I
was shocked at how much the stock sold off after Gotham's article on it. I sold shortly after that article and
have been following out of curiosity since.


I have not assumed that Amtrust's worth is illusory, far from it. What I am saying is that with increased
regulatory scrutiny IF there are any inconsistencies then any illusory value will disappear. I do not presume to
know if there is smoke and mirrors going on, however as a rule of thumb I tend to avoid such a large unknown
risk in my investments, and to me, there is a big unknown here. Amtrust has had plenty of opportunities to put
this to rest and I do not believe they have, at least not to my satisfaction. Will there be a day of reckoning for
Amtrust? I do not know. It is possible that they are simply that much better at evaluating and underwriting risk
than all of their competitors. But I have learned the hard way before that often that which appears too good to
be true is often the case. So the fact that there COULD be a day of reckoning for Amtrust is enough for me to
steer clear.

@User 19200701


does it occur to you that we might already have a pretty clear picture of what's going on here. perhaps that we might
have hired experts from the big accounting firms dealing with luxembourg to vet the company's treatment of those
issues who found no evidence of problems?


the reality is that this short thesis was developed sometime in 2012. since that time, we've been in a very strong
workers comp market. berkshire has been one of the fastest growing workers comp underwriters both in california and
elsewhere. premiums have gone up several fold from years prior to 2012. a 1% favorable development on premiums
written in 12,13,14, and soon 15 will vastly outweigh any issues from prior years (and we don't believe those issues
exist in those years of any consequence). look at workers comp loss development in years 2004/2005 and you can
see how good workers comp can get when pricing is good. recent years will likely develop very favorably.


saying amtrust has a long way to fall only works if you assume everyone long is dumb, has done no work, and not
vetted the bear case. good luck with your short.

The author is right on target with the Case Reserves issues. Many insurance companies that collapsed have
done the same thing in the past.


And the investors are not dumb. It is just probably because they think AM Trust has a long way to go before it
collapses, and that there is lots of room to make a handsome profit, and dump the stock before the company
collapses ("Pump and dump", if you never heard of it; Enron did it too, if this is telling you something). At the
end of the day, in many aspects, AM Trust is identical to Tower, if it is not even worse than Tower. And if you
look into Tower, after many Tower high ranking employees dump their stock, the company collapsed within
months.


Accounting experts!!! Are you for real? Didn't Tower have like PWC, and still went under. Accounting firms
make decisions based on information provided to them by the audited companies. If the information is
incorrect, nothing they can do about it. And what do you mean by "hired experts from the big accounting
firms", like you hired one of the big 4 firms, or individuals that used to work at those companies. AFSI Case
Reserves are low, and this is a fact, especially if you take into consideration that they are mainly into the long
tail WC business, which allows for Case Reserves manipulation.


I would short the stock, but it is not available for shorting, which may be another reason why this stock is
overpriced.


21 Nov 2014, 03:30 PM 


User 19200701
Who is we? Perhaps you have hired experts from the big accounting firms dealing with Luxembourg and if so
certainly that would shed light on some things, however other questions and issues would remain. 
It is obviously that you are long Amtrust and your goal is to pour cold water on the questions that Gotham has
raised without actually answering them. If you had an answer for them I am sure you would provide it. 
Gotham's premise, and I hope that I am not misunderstanding or oversimplifying, is ultimately that Amtrust
has inadequate reserves. Furthermore, that with the current state of the company, if there is a large
requirement of reserve strengthening it would be a serious, if not fatal blow to the company. I think they have
laid out a good case that should significant reserve strengthening be required it would put the company in a
difficult position at best.Also, if the company is underreserving it could account for how they have managed to
outperform their peers so consistently as well as consistently beat market expectations.I do not take a
position on whether they are underreserving or not, however, it is clear that increased scrutiny is coming. And
should it be the case that they are in fact underreserved it could spell disaster for the company and the
stock.

onshore will drastically increase the capital requirements here, thus forcing them to slow growth...and as soon
as they slow, I suspect it will be too late (for the co, longs, regulators, AM Best, etc).


21 Nov 2014, 07:51 PM 


Gotham Investing, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Continued growth in 2015 requires capital, which AFSI lacks.


Even 2012 is developing poorly, but the company has dramatically reduced (darn near eliminated) IBNR. For
instance, QS date IBNR is ~2.0 million at TIC, but 1-3q14 saw TIC pay out 980k on claims unreported as of
12/31/13.


This implies TIC's IBNR will cover ~6 quarters of new reporting claims (maybe 8 if we assume new claims
dissipate). This is hardly adequate for such a long-tail line...


24 Nov 2014, 08:24 PM 


Gotham Investing, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Correction (i was looking at a different subsidiary's filing).


-QS date IBNR is 2.422m at TIC.  
-1-3q14 payments for claims unreported as of 12/31/13 was 3.475m (~4.6m annualized).  
-This implies TIC has ~2 quarters of reserves for yet to be reported claims (maybe 3 if we assume new claims
taper off).


Reiterate: this is hardly adequate for a medium-to-long tail set of casualty lines of business (WC, Comm Auto,
GL).

User 19200701 - debate is healthy for capital markets. not sure why @ddddr224234 being long and expressing a
view is a bad thing. Just like there is nothing wrong with gotham investing being short and expressing an opinion.


@ddddr224234 can you explain further, if possible, why WRB is an appropriate comp? Are there are any differences
in reserve methods between AFSI and WRB that might make the comparison misleading?


21 Nov 2014, 01:25 PM 


ddddr224234
I just used WRB as an example because Gotham has referred to the company several times when comparing Amtrust
with others in his earlier posts.


The evidence isn't that different regardless of whose Part 3 filings you look at. KBW looked at 24 different insurance
companies and their Part 3 filings and you see the exact same pattern. Quoting KBW, "We believe this should be
expected as previously unknown (i.e. incurred but not reported claims) become known and are allocated case
reserves."

Gotham, and its owners, have been harpooning AFSI for a long while. When they publish, the stock tanks, only to
bounce back after earnings are announced. And note that they only refer to company-generated numbers, and then
cast doubts on them by comparing them with those of other companies that are not really comparable. This is the
mistake of a sophomore business under-grad--unless they are dumping and pumping--cast doubt on the company
while in a short position and then buy out of the position at a big profit.

Read the articles on seeking alpha (by Gotham and others as well), and if you ever worked in insurance, you
will understand what i mean. I do not have time to sit down and decode it for you, given all the companies,
reinsurance companies, structures etc they have around. If you knew reserving, you would know what i mean.
Reserving start with case reserving practices, and it goes to actuarial techniques etc. This company does not
seem to follow prudent practices, and controls and balances at all. And they are mostly in long tail business,
which allows for cooking the books. Do you get it now?

People that worked for PC insurance companies, know something called claims best practices, case
reserving best practices, case reserving updates etc. What AM Trust is doing, is not best practices. It is
possible they are just incompetent (which is still bad for investors), or they are cooking the books. I do not
need to do my own in depth analysis, if i read what others write, and i agree with their analysis.

The charges are based on forensic accounting of AFSI's public disclosures. AM Best must be aware of the charges,
especially because they have been--er, flung--for so long. Or the state, federal and international regulators.


22 Nov 2014, 12:19 PM

AM Best usually downgrades companies well after everybody already knows of the mess.


The regulators do know of AM Trust practices, and this is why NY DOI asked them to disclosed information.
The DOI is closing in on them.


To me, it seems that AM Trust is trying to grow themselves out of trouble, but in all probability they are just
getting deeper and deeper into trouble in the process. They keep acquiring poor quality books of business,
hoping things will get better. They won't. and most likely the department let them buy Tower group, as they did
not want to take Tower into receivership, but it will be very interesting to see what will happen when AM Trust
blows up. This will be a huge mess for the insurance industry.

AmTrust did not acquire Tower, they acquired the renewal rights to the commercial business. According to
AmTrust the relationship with the NYDFS was not hostile by any regard and AmTrust and its related
companies had the opportunity to walk away from the Tower deal when the NYDFS added the stipulations. If
they had so much to hide why wouldn't they have just walked away at that point?


I also think it is interesting that this latest hit piece really did nothing to move the stock. I think Gotham's
power over AFSI is what is deteriorating.

1. I do not believe the Tower book they acquired is of good quality. Tower themselves where doing exactly
what AM Trust is doing and they went under as you probably know. What makes you think that AM Trust can
achieve different results with the same book, and the same business model? (Buying the books of companies
that went under and expect different results…). Now, if you do it little by little, probably you can, but the way
they are doing it, it is a bomb ready to explode. In my opinion, all the books they are buying are poor quality. 
2. Not sure if you ever worked with the NYDFS, but they are friendly to everyone. They are never hostile, and
when something goes wrong, they say “we do not have enough resources to audit an industry that is so big”,
and so on and so forth…In my opinion, they did not walk away for 2 reasons. The first reason is that they
have to keep growing, if they are to keep manipulating the reserves and not run out of cash (unless an auditor
puts the brakes on them), and the second reason is that had they walked away, they would get caught
immediately, as them walking away would raise red flags. The fact that a company this size does not have a
fellow actuary overseeing pricing and reserving does not raise red flags to you? How about the fact they do
not have a big auditing firm to audit them? How about all these reinsurance companies in countries where

regulation is so lax? How about the fact that they have so many companies they do not need (for no other
reason than cover up, probably?).


3. And if you are asking me, the department does not want anybody to blow up, as cover-up works for them
too. I am sure they were very happy to find someone to take the Tower problem over (ACP Re). Now, if AM
Trust blows up, and based on their reserving methods they will as soon as they stop growing, not sure what
the department is going to do, as I doubt they have enough resources to deal with a blow up of the AM Trust
size.


4. In regards to Tower book quality, especially their WC book must have been of very poor quality, as in the
Fall of 2013, when the management of Tower was looking to “enhance their financial flexibility” they
(probably) could not get neither Arch nor Hannover Re to reinsure it for them, and as a result they had to get
Southport Re to do it, which in my opinion was not a real company, not to mention that at the end the deal
was cancelled. If Arch and Hannover would not reinsure the book, you understand of what quality it must
have been.


5. In my opinion there are 2 reasons that explain why the stock does not go down on news by Gotham. The
first reason is that the stock is not available for shorting (tried to short it, but could not borrow it), and it is
mainly held by the family, and institutional investors, who buy and sell on their research, not on someone
else’s research. Also, as the volume traded is very low only $1.18M, it is very easy to manipulate the price, if
you want to, especially if you are worth $2.5B….. However, if you look into the AM Trust options, you will see
a very different story. For example, yesterday the $35 Jan 16 (Stock closed at $53.2 on friday; investors need
a 47% stock price decline to hit the money) puts were trading at $6.80, $1.23, or 22% over what they were
trading for on Thursday, and ask now is $8.20. Jan $16 $40 puts are very interesting too, and they trade at
$10.10, and the volume is huge…… In short, this shows that the market agrees a lot with Gotham.


6. As a comparison, let’s see how AFSI put options trade vs. their peers. AFSI at the money March 20 2015
puts trade at $11.30 and ask is $13.20, while XL Group trades at $1.23 and asking is $1.40!!! (plus this is April
expiration, so more time value) W. R. Berkley Corp (they had reserving issues already) April 17 at the money
trades at $0.30, and ask is $3.20. So, with AM trust “stock insurance” trading anywhere between 4 and 10
times the peers cost, do you think the market agrees or disagrees with Gotham?

Author’s reply »  "According to AmTrust" is the key phrase w/r/t NYDFS relationship.


Can you point to any example of an insurance company being subject to such pointed conditions (other than
selling xyz subsidiary for competitive reasons)? A new auditor, more actuaries, specific changes to their over-
financially-engin... corporate structure.


I suspect that AmTrust knew that they couldn't just decline the conditions and have ACP Re walk away from
the deal...that would have drawn the ire of regulators (who would have to deal with the TWGP mess
themselves) and been an absolute "tell" that regulators needed to investigate.


By taking the problem of TWGP off the regulators' plate, AFSI was able to buy themselves some time to
implement some (very reasonable) conditions instead of being subject to a very skeptical regulator (for not

Have you ever look at actuarial reserving methods before? if case reserves develop as expected over time for a
particular accident year, ibnr will reduce as the ultimate loss pick will not change at all… ibnr develops into case
reserves and then gets paid… just because case reserves increase for a particular accident year in no way means
that ibnr, or more importantly ultimate loss, should increase. If it is inconsistent with the development factors chosen
when selecting the ultimate, then it may move… suggest you go do some CAS exams.

There are some very interesting postings going on with this company. Makes investing in them tough. In a nutshell,
this is what we have: 
1. A company that does something almost impossible to do, very stable earnings in a volatile industry. 
2. Next, said company keeps acquiring troubled businesses as pointed out by Deviladv (Towers) as well as untroubled
businesses yet no hiccups despite all of the integration risks. And they just keep producing industry leading results
without industry leading talent (that I am aware). It is almost as if they have a magic wand…maybe they are smarter
than everyone else? Or maybe not? 
3. Said company has one of the most complex financial engineering systems in the insurance space, yet has no
FCAS’ on board? Not sure why NYDOI just figured this out? Hopefully they have a battalion or two of CPAs skilled in
P/C accounting. The Luxembourg stuff seems legit and they just understood it better than most.  
4. Said company seems short on providing educational background of leadership team. Why? 
5. Said company chooses an accounting firm that not Big 4…but is Big 8. Not sure I see an issue here per se. How
many big insurance companies does BDO audit? 
6. Said company has major negative case reserve development but just in the nick of time has positive IBNR. All of
the comparisons made to other companies are really irrelevant as the complexities are unique to each company. I
would feel better if AFSI announced a change in philosophy to case reserving. User 870 is correct, “just because case
reserves increase for a particular accident year in no way means that IBNR, or more importantly ultimate loss, should
increase.” Oftentimes, included in IBNR are bulk reserves…an investor needs more transparency into the reserve
practices. Having said that, it would be extremely rare that a growing company can have declining pure IBNR
reserves…at the end of any accounting period, the larger the earned premium, the greater the exposure for losses
incurred but not yet reported. 
7. If I were to take a position on this company, I would have to convince myself that some private equity group has the
wherewithal to so influence underwriting practices that they out segment all of the competition and make money
almost entirely on underwriting results. The financial engineering is so much a part of this entity it is somewhat
impossible to believe that anyone understands what they are investing in…I would like to see a big, highly respected
reinsurer take a piece of the action to convince me there is profit in the UW results. I would need a convincing report
from an actuary (with credentials) to explain declining IBNR in a rapidly growing insurer (whether it is organic or
through acquisition of renewal rights…they both increase exposure). If this all pans out, maybe they have found the

Peterxray- your comment "at the end of any accounting period, the larger the earned premium, the greater the
exposure for losses incurred but not yet reported." is true, however the exhibit used in this analysis is about
how each prior accident year has developed, it has nothing to do with the total level of ibnr held- indeed this is
why the 2014 accident year is xxx'ed out.

1. There is no secret recipe in WC insurance. Especially in the low interest, high health care inflation
environment we are currently in. Given the extend to which WC rates are regulated, and need to be approved
by state boards, it is highly unlikely to make economic profits in this line of business. Not to mention that AM
Trust now is growing in CA, and beleive me, the CA DOI is not the NY DOI.....


2. Not sure if their auditor is big 8, but their revenue is only $618M vs. $34B for PWC (less than 2% of the
PWC size; if you get top 50, you may even find my accountant in there). Am I am sure a large part of that
$618M comes from AM Trust, if you know what i mean.

BDO is the fifth largest accounting firm in the world with annual revenue of 6.45 billion in 2013. They have
over 55,000 employees. So I have no idea where you get 618 million from.


26 Nov 2014, 08:43 AM

My mistake, i was looking into a Chicago company. BDO is not an auditing firm; it is "a worldwide professional
services network of public accountancy firms, serving national and international clients. As of 2013, BDO has
Member Firms in 144 countries". So, which BDO company is auditing AM Trust? I mean which branch?


If they really want to come clean, they should hire PWC. As they were Tower's auditor they will tell them how
to fix the mess, if it is still fixable. But they will not. Why? For the obvious reasons. PWC (the NY team) could
not figure out what Tower was hiding, and you are telling me that a company (a network of affiliated
accountant firms, not even a company) doing mostly business outside the US is capable of auditing AM
Trust? Give me a break.

Look up PWC. it says the same exact thing about being a network. you might be correct about some of the
issues (I don't know) but you are wasting your time on the accounting firm issue. there's nothing wrong with
BDO compared to a PWC. It's like arguing Toyota isn't part of the Big 3 in Detroit. WGAS

The company's US operations are only $618M. They are not what you would call experts. The accounting firm
is very important, as they need to be looking over what the company does, and make them make changes, if
changes are needed. In any case, the top management of AM Trust started unloading shares, in case this
tells something to you.

If you look at the share selling history of the management it has not changed. They were questioned about
this when the first GeoInvesting hit piece was published as they sold some shares right before the decline.
They are pre-planned sells as part of their compensation structure.

Do you work at AM Trust? The management always tries to make it look as if there is a pattern. You can
always come up with excuses. Of course they are going to try to make it look random. You expect them to
come out and say they are selling because the ship is about to sink?


And usually, if you are questioned about something in corporate America, chances are you are doing into.

It has nothing to do with management. All you have to do is look at Yahoo insider transactions and see that
the sales were automatic sales. Over the last 6 months the net decrease in number of shares held by
management is 10,931. They purchased 100k (in options) and sold 110,931. I have no doubt Gotham has
significant knowledge, but you keep making yourself look silly. First your comments regarding BDO and now

I was right about BDO, i remind you. It's US operations are only $618M. Wiki link below. Probably you luck IQ

In regards to planned sales, as i said, the management always tries to make it look random. If their options
are deep in the money, of course they will exercise. They are exercising options at $5-$12, and they are
selling at $40-$55. Conclusions are yours. Do not you think that not exercising options with intrinsic value of
$40-$50 would raise RED FLAGS?

User870-I completely agree. I was referring to the need for additional transparency so we can decipher bulk reserves
vs pure IBNR. This is a growing company and while a previous contributor suggested as claims are paid IBNR will
come down...that may or may not be true. And, while we would expect previous accident years to have reserves
coming down each year, they will be replaced on new accident years....if the company is growing the total reserves on
the balance sheet should be increasing (assuming the general mix of business stays the same).

I am not a qualified actuary, but have worked evaluating security for half a century with both brokers and companies. I
still sit as a consultant on a number of security committees. One thing I have learnt (H S Weavers was a good
example, or Quinn Insurance or.......) is that there is not much point in expanding if you are doing so at the expense of
viable premium rating. My own view of AmTrust is that they are fuelling growth by constant acquisitions, and covering
up the weaknesses with creative accounting and Luxembourg subsidiaries. It is also a wonder to me that they would
be able to merge the varied systems of their purchases to make any worthwhile kind of overall accounts. There are
signs that the figures are wishful thinking based on loose information.
