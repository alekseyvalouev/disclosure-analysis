The Harbin Land Shuffle: A Classic Bait And Switch
Sep. 23, 2011 8:42 AM ET55 comments
by: The GeoTeam


As of September 21, 2011, the risk equation at Harbin Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN) has
fundamentally changed due to the release of 2 new pieces of information which essentially
prove that HRBN has made material misrepresentations to the SEC, the NASDAQ
and to China Development Bank. The size and nature of these material
misrepresentations is now too big and too public to be ignored by the SEC, the NASDAQ
or China Development Bank. There now exists a very real basis for the NASDAQ to halt
/delist the stock and for CDB to walk away from the financing.


The irrefutable misrepresentations boil down to this:


· One of HRBN’s major customers doesn’t even know who HRBN is!


· The Bait and Switch (ala YUII): Creating a phony land acquisition and then
attempting to replace it with another transaction after having been exposed.


The first development was the surfacing of audio tapes on The Financial Investigator
which indicate that HRBN has completely fabricated its relationship with a reported major
customer, Jiangsu Liyang Automobile Seat Adjuster Factory. GeoInvesting is strongly of
the opinion that anyone who is following the HRBN transaction should absolutely make it a
point to listen to these tapes in their entirety. [here and here]. We have spoken several
times with the interviewer who made the tapes to confirm their authenticity.


The contents of the tapes can be summarized as follows:


- An US investor visited the facilities of Jiangsu Liyang in person and interviewed the head
of sales, and then subsequently followed up with a phone call with the general manager
(head of quality control)


- Both managers in 2 separate conversations independently confirmed that Jiangsu Liyang
has no relationship with Harbin Electric, and in fact doesn’t even know who Harbin
Electric is.


- More importantly, Jiangsu Liyang is effectively not even in the business of making
electric seat adjusters. The company makes MANUAL seat adjusters. As can be
heard clearly on the tapes, Jiangsu Liyang produced less than a total of $500,000 of

https://seekingalpha.com/article/295518-the-harbin-land-shuffle-a-classic-bait-and-switch 2/14


electric seat adjusters in the past 2 years. However, in HRBN’s 2010 10K (page 9) HRBN
disclosed that it sold over $40 million in motors to Jiangsu Liyang in the years ended 2008
and 2009.


- The interviewer asked if he could see any electric seat adjusters and was told that none
were available because they are only made by special order and only comprise 1-2% of
Jiangsu Liyang’s revenue.


- In each of the past 2 years Jiangsu Liyang can be heard to state that they sold only
about 1,000 motorized seat adjusters, and more importantly for the few motors that they
did purchase, they named their supplier as Shanghai Shenghuabo Motors, not Harbin
Electric.


For those who wish to independently confirm what Jiangsu Liyang produces, it is easy to
visit their website here. It can be clearly seen that Jiangsu Liyang includes pictures of all
of their products and that none of them are motorized or electric.


These facts are easily verifiable by the NASDAQ and in similar recent incidents with China
stocks the NASDAQ has acted relatively swiftly to halt the stock. It is also now easy for
China Development Bank to visit Jiangsu Liyang, or to even simply call them and ask what
they produce in terms of manual or electric car seat adjusters. Barring that, CDB can
simply visit the website of Jiangsu Liyang and easily see that the company does not even
produce motorized seat adjusters.


The second development was the September 21, 2011 after-market release of an 8K
by HRBN which effectively confirms our findings and those of AlfredLittle.com regarding a
reported land purchase by HRBN that never took place.


On September 6th, HRBN released a press release refuting a report by AlfredLittle.com
and us. HRBN stated:


Regarding the land purchase referenced in the report, the Company stands by the
statements as disclosed in its 10-Q dated August 9, 2011. Harbin Electric confirms
that the land purchase was done in full compliance with various relevant Chinese
government entities and notes this transaction structure is a common practice in
China.


Yet in the September 21st 8K, HRBN notes that the land purchase had already been
canceled as of August 24th. HRBN notes that now a new transaction has taken place for 2
separate parcels of land, yet both the total purchase price and deposit amounts required

are exactly equal to the amount of the first supposed transaction that never occurred.


Creating a phony land acquisition and then attempting to replace it with another
transaction after being caught is nearly identical to the situation that occurred with YUHE
International and which resulted in the almost immediate halting and delisting by the
NASDAQ.

So from what I can tell, Harbin is a city, Chanchun is a city, Shenyang is a city, Beijing is a city, etc., etc.


The fact that you are equating the listing of an agent of Jiangsu Lile Group in a city named 'Harbin' with the
actual company HRBN is not only a shoddy observation but equally obtuse. You should not be commenting
without thinking.

Shmuck, Harbin is a City, the "Harbin Agent" is their sales agent of that city. They have nothing to do with
Harbin Electric. This buyout is never going to happen, why would the China bank trust them now and who
would buy shares in this scam of a shell if it re-listed on a Hong Kong market. Only a matter of time until
Nasdaq and SEC finish their investigation and share becomes halted. GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN.


Harbin (Chinese: 哈尔滨), is the capital and largest city of Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China, lying on
the southern bank of the Songhua River. With a population of 9.87 million, it is the tenth largest city in China,
[citation needed] serving as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in the
Northeast.

interesting that you are not addressing the second part of the article where it's obvious that HRBN
misrepresented their claim that the original land purchase happened and they stand by their 10k. so now they
no longer stand by their 10K? or their original rebuttal? now they just happened to purchase two new pieces
of land for the exact same price. sounds to me like the SEC or NASDAQ started making phone calls or asking
questions and now their is a new story.

akhait
There was a detailed objection raised on Yahoo HRBN board that addresses the supplier in question:


On Seeking Alpha a registered user can post a reply to an article but the author of the article must approve the
response for all to see.


I posted a challenge to the latest Jiangsu Liyang seat revenue nonsense. I received a response back from Roddy with
some jibber jabber trying to insinuate Harbin directed his 'team' to the company interviewed. I then directly asked if
Harbin specifically stated Jiangsu Lile Group with the manager name, address and phone number. He would not
confirm that.


What I find very suspicious is if I log onto the Alpha site my post is visible, if I view the site without a login my post is
not visible. Obviously he doesn't want others to see the post. IMO that's all that is needed to illustrate his presentation
has no validity.


Posted on Seeking Alpha :


As usual, another spin on the real facts. Harbin Electric is NOT specifying any specific company in their 10K.


Jiangsu is a province in China, Liyang is a City. Just so happens Boyd was able to find a company in Jiangsu Liyang
with a plant there that can be construed to the Harbin reference. Jiangsu Lile Group is the company he interviews and
they are located in Liyang, that's it. There are many automotive suppliers in that city/province.


This is no different than GM saying a "Detroit, Michigan trim supplier factory". Most companies DON'T want to be
named by their suppliers.


The company that Boyd craftily references does NOT make ANY electric seats. NONE. During the interview the
General Manager of Lile even admits he has no electric product he can display. What mfg facility doesn't have every
product they make within it's walls ? Even if it's an engineering sample or a quality reject.


The real suspicion here is Boyd provides a web link in his hit piece but points the readers to a Chinese language site.
Why wouldn't he point to the English version ? Because he want's to keep the facts confused. If you can't read it then
it must be true, right ?


Here is the one everyone reading an English report can interpret.

akhait,


You a paid pumper or just huge sucker? I looked at your last 4 pages of posts. You either defended the
company or attacked the short article on CHBT, CAGC, PUDA and CCME. All of which are proven frauds,
delisted and trading around 60 cents on average.


You also defended LTUS which is a well documented fraud but it never made it off the pink sheets. LLEN
another likely fraud (price point/market seems to agree). And then two others which I have no opinion on.

23 Sep 2011, 01:55 PM


akhait
I was wrong about CCME and LTUS (and probably CELM). I accept there were inappropriate transactions
with PUDA, although from a shareholder's perspective, if it is reversed, I'd be happy with that (happier
compared to an alternative scenario when the company is not given a chance to recover under attacks). So
yes, I was gullible on several occasions. That does not mean that I cannot see through unfounded attacks,
such as in case of LLEN, CSR and HRBN. The basic approach I see is short sellers throwing mud at all the
RTO's and checking what sticks. If it initially does, the attacks continue. If there is a reversal, the attacks
reach a crescendo until the transaction is done.


HRBN transaction is almost a done deal. These are attempts to save short positions by bringing up
increasingly unsupportable accusations. Looking forward to the conclusion of the transaction and seeing
shorts beaten on this occasion. And yes, I'll exercise more caution in the future.

Gold's like Pyrite: When the investigator asked for anonymity (in terms of identifying him by name; his voice and photo
are in the story), he said that China was a place where critical reporting and investigation have a documented track
record of being negatively reinforced. Specifically, he did not wish to have his internal travel freedoms compromised,
or, given some of the lovely people who have launched RTOs, any violence to come upon him.


Akhalt: You are acting rather silly. I am in no way restricting or limiting your post's visibility. Specifically, I addressed, in
full, your view that the company profiled was not HRBN's customer. I'll go over it again: For several months, my
sources have called the company and been told of this company by Harbin. Nor, in an SEC filing, could it possibly be
acceptable for a company to put down "Detroit, component manufacturer/assembler" when disclosing material
concentrations of revenue risk or vendor/supplier relationships.

Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
If a stock one is short is delisted, it will still trade big discount and lower price and is easily covered for a big
profit. If the stock is halted, there may not ever be a need or requirement to cover.

It is no stretch to imagine that journalists in China would wish anonymity, but it also a very convenient dodge for short
sellers. Linking to a Chinese language site is disingenuous, to say the least.


Caution for sure. Especially when reading the work of a short seller. I doubt that Seeking Alpha has the resources to
truly police the work of short sellers, which is a shame because it tends to undermine the credibility of the entire site.


24 Sep 2011, 12:14 PM


LE
For those of you promoting HRBN, do you have any reasonably good evidence that this company makes and sells
anything significant? Have you visited the company? Can you post photos of their plant or their products? Can you
post photos or videos of workers or trucks entering/exiting their plant? Their English website looks very amateur. Do
they have a Chinese site? Does it trouble you at all that Frazer Frost is their auditor? Has anyone ever seen them (a
booth) at a trade show?


The way I look at it, maybe it's 50/50 (at best) that HRBN is legit and that the buyout will happen at $24. If not, it's
probably a complete fraud. So that gives me a statistical value of $12. But the stock trades at $20. That looks like a
good short to me. Disc: no position

When you disclosed that you are short, what methodology are you actually using. Options, or shorting the actual

When a failed company is delisted, the shorts basically made 100% on their bets and never have to buy back
the stock. Therefore, they don't have ever to pay taxes on their gains and the other half of the commission.


This is best scenario for shorts.

"they don't have ever to pay taxes on their gains and the other half of the commission." -- this information is
garbage. The sale proceeds are income, the cost basis is zero, the difference is capital gain.

Exception if property becomes worthless. A different rule applies if the property sold short becomes
substantially worthless. In that case, you must recognize gain as if the short sale were closed when the
property became substantially worthless.  
The only question is at what point in time the property becomes "substantially worthless" and whether
delisting is tantamount to that.


26 Sep 2011, 08:47 AM


Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
There are plenty of delisted stocks - that would not be 'substantially worthless'. As for halted that would also
require circumstances. Bottom line - if property were "substantially worthless", then there probably is no
bidding up of any stock price now would there?.


26 Sep 2011, 09:00 AM


ggrins8317
From Investopedia:


When you short sell you borrow the shares, sell them on the market, and then collect the proceeds as cash. If you
wanted to get out of the position, you would have to buy back the same number of shares to repay the person (or
brokerage) from whom you borrowed them. If you buy back the shares at a price lower than the price at which you
originally sold them, you collect the difference - so short selling is a way to profit from a falling stock. But if the
company is delisted and bankrupt, you don't have to pay back anyone because the shares are worthless.


Note: This is the best possible scenario for a short seller.

gets involved, such as GM?


I guess the broker eats it on a short on a co. that files/declares 
bankruptcy, generally speaking for a listed co.


Does the listing of a bankrupt ticker going pink have any affect 
upon a short, other than a profit?

5/23/2018 The Harbin Land Shuffle: A Classic Bait And Switch - HARBIN ELECTRIC, INC. (NASDAQ:HRBN) | Seeking Alpha

Drug
The shorts are desperate and have been doing everything they can do sabotage the deal (the merger). There might
be a chance that authorities, including CDB, follow them and take actions against HRBN. 
On the other side, China and Hong Kong markets have been tumbling as well. These CEO buyouts are basically
speculations as well. They get heavily indebted in order to bring their companies public elsewhere. It's possible that
they lose confidence in quickly going public elsewhere. While waiting, they will have to pay interests for the loans. I'm
afraid Tianfu Yang might think of quitting, in some way. I noticed he doesn't come out to refute the short hits as he did
recently. As an example, the CISG's CEO has withdrawn his non-binding offer of acquisition. 
My conclusion for the moment: the remaining 20% to the target price is not enough for me to take the risk. I don't want
to play on the short side either. 
Good luck, folks!

Yawn.


Again, none of this is really relevant.


The only question is "will CDB fund the loan"?


Why don't you detectives post some valuable research like whether CDB are crooked enough to fund the buyout of a
hoax company?

Even if they were originally, there has been so much commotion and now the attention of the SEC that the
odds have reduced for the buyout.

MonsieurMoneyBags
Hats off to Yang ,he waited until after hours to release the PR so he could trap all the shorts. I guess that's his way of
paying them back for all the BS they've written about this deal.

Roddy, time for you to come out and say something! The proxy is now definitive and all now that's left is the vote. Who
in their right mind would vote this deal down? You really ought to sit down and think through this again...


So what if the company has some numbers that are not 100% accurate? Why do you care if the Chairman, Abax and
CDB are willing to buy it at a ridiculous price even if you're right? Let them buy a crap company at sky high prices
then! No matter what you shorts are saying, these Chinese deals have been closing: FTLK, CFSG and most recently
CSR.


If you just think through very logically, you'll realize that this deal has a very high chance of success and you should
run and cover your shorts


1) No matter what you say about their numbers, HRBN has gone through at least 5 significant due diligence
processes: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Abax, CDB, Ernst & Young (check the latest filing)


2) Since you guys are so good at reaching out to people to conduct due diligence, you should at least try to reach out
to Abax and CDB to find out what kind of DD process they conduct. Speaking to them would give you a whole
different impression about things. Dont you think CDB can just press a few buttons and find out right away if HRBN is
real or not? They are a state owned bank and has a very extensive network nationally


3) If you were Chairman Yang, why bother going through this buyout process for a whole year? What is the
motivation? If it is to prop up the share price to unload shares, why do it for over a year? The stock has traded so
much that he could unload the entire company a few times already! So why are they still pushing ahead? And why
bother issuing all these strong statements about closing the deal? He is a very reputable figure in Harbin and is part of
the NPC. There is simply too much to lose for everyone involved here (including Abax, CDB) if this were a fraud, and
if you understand only a little bit about Chinese culture, then you would understand


4) If you were Chairman Yang and are trying to defraud investors, would you go out and hire the best advisors to help
you do this fake exercise? Why would you get GS, Skadden and CDB to be your partners? And do you think it is
really that easy to jump through the hoops of DD processes from these people? Why dont you try and think about that
for a second and imagine how hard it is


Think it is time to face the facts. This will all be done and dusted in a few weeks.


CSR is a much shadier company and even they secured CDB funding and the deal just closed. If CSR can close,
then HRBN is definitely closing. Tell your friends to just cover their shorts and just move on.

It is a great question. Why does it take 12 months and an army of well-recognizable names to close such a
small transaction? And why don't we see disclosures of shares purchased on the open market by the
chairman or Abax? After all, they disclosed their intention to buy at $24; if the market is giving them an
opportunity to buy at $20, who could fault them for doing it?


I haven't read all geo therm, roddy white, etc. pieces, but the transaction itself sounds very fishy to me.

MonsieurMoneyBags
Lol why does it take 12 month to disclose a transaction.. You are obviously very unfamiliar with process of
corporate filings, it takes weeks at a time to get any single doc approved. Considering there are more than 15
filing, You do not look to bright for thinking it should take under a year.
