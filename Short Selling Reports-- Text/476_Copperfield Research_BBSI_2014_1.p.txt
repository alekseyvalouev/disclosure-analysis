------------------------------------------


We believe Barrett Business Services (BBSI) operates with a precarious
business model and substantial reserve deficiencies, which has created
immense blow-up risk for public market investors. The combination of
aggressive growth into the pernicious California workers' compensation market
and minimal transparency regarding a recently disclosed reserve study has
created an un-investable stock. Our work suggests BBSI has systematically
under reserved, which has resulted in materially overstated earnings and a
high probability of a massive reserve charge. With only three covering sell-side
analysts (none of whom appear to have any insurance domain expertise based
on a collective coverage universe that includes movie theatres, executive
staffing, water dispensers, and ecommerce solutions), the combustible issues
at BBSI have largely escaped investor scrutiny. That should change with our
report, which includes a compendium of forensic issues, as well as background
on BBSI's model and end markets.


Based on our analysis of 2013 incremental adverse development (applied to
2012 claims expense), we believe BBSI may have overstated earnings by
57%. Depending on the degree to which BBSI's reserves may be inadequate,
there are scenarios discussed herein which would completely wipe out BBSI's
previously reported profits. In addition to arguing our belief that BBSI has
overstated past earnings, we outline why BBSI appears to be in blatant
violation of U.S. GAAP accounting. Our accounting concerns are amplified by a
2014 lawsuit brought by a long tenured branch manager accusing BBSI C-
Suite executives of "effectively cooking the books to create inflated profit
margins to entice interest in BBSI stock in violation of SEC regulations."[i]
Unsurprisingly, we have been unable to find any disclosures in BBSI's public
filings about the existence of the lawsuit and associated incendiary charges.
BBSI's auditor is tiny Moss Adams, who does not even list insurance as an area
of expertise on its website.


It is well understood that insurance companies can hide long-term economic
liabilities for extended periods of time. However, a recently announced reserve
study should act as the catalyst to publicly expose the magnitude of BBSI's
reserve hole. The dramatic shift in IBNR and case reserves are additional red
flags, with the latter inexplicably increasing from $51 million to nearly $93
million in BBSI's most recent quarter. Based on our analysis, if BBSI simply

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/3269815-barrett-business-services-bbsi-a-tick-tick-ticking-time-bomb 3/35


matched the reserve coverage of other PEOs and insurance companies, a
charge between $69 million to $280 million would be required. For
perspective, BBSI's shareholder equity at 6/30/14 was just $74 million. A
reserve charge representing just a fraction of our estimate would likely
eliminate years of pretax earnings, while creating uncertainty over BBSI's
profitability and ongoing business model.


Adding even more asymmetry to BBSI's stock is the new fronting agreement
with ACE. Should the reserve study (or other issues discussed herein) cause
ACE to non-renew its fronting agreement, BBSI's corporate profile could be
impaired with no replacement to renew its California business.


Under a rosy scenario analysis that assumes BBSI is somehow able to delay
reserve charges, we still believe the stock will revalue significantly lower to
account for balance sheet risk and incremental earnings pressure from
regulatory changes occurring on January 1, 2015. Generously assuming
benign outcomes for many of the issues identified in this report, we still
believe fair value for BBSI's stock is $29.00 per share, which is 50% below its
recent price. The $29.00 per share scenario assumes the company is NOT
required to take significant reserve charges to address its thin reserve
position, has no negative changes in its ACE fronting agreement, and no
restatement of past results for inappropriate reserving practices occur. On the
other hand, if we are correct about the considerable hole in BBSI's reserve, we
believe there are a plethora of long-tail scenarios that could cause the stock
price to go much, much lower. We encourage all shareholders (and sell-
side promoters) without insurance expertise to consult an insurance
expert to independently verify our analysis and conclusions.


Our report contains several sections focused on relevant background
information on BBSI, workers' comp, as well as the California PEO dynamics.
Other sections are specific to the problems we have identified at BBSI,
including detailed analysis examining BBSI's reserving practices and
business/financial models. For those with time constraints, we would
encourage you to jump directly to sections 4, 6, 7, and 8, which provide the
most specific analysis and discussion into the significant risks and "meat" of
our BBSI opinion. If you can only read one section in its entirety, please see

section 6 ("Severely Inadequate Reserves May Require a Significant Charge").
Sections 1-3 provide relevant, yet admittedly boring background. The following
segments are covered in this report:


1) Investors Should View BBSI as an Insurance Company - BBSI is a
PEO with a small staffing business. The PEO represents approximately 95% of
gross revenues. BBSI competes in the challenging market of providing
workers' compensation insurance for blue collar employers. Further, most of its
exposure growth has come in California, which now represents roughly 74% of
net revenues. Over the past three years, the new management team more
than doubled the company's exposure to this risky market.


2) A Brief Background on the Seedy History of PEOs - The PEO industry
has a tumultuous history that is marred by extensive fraud. In recent months,
officials tied to several PEOs were sentenced in one of the largest insurance
fraud cases ever, misappropriating $133 million of their clients' money.
According to the FBI, "Workers' compensation insurance accounts for as much
as 46 percent of small business owners' general operating expenses. Due to
this, small business owners have an incentive to shop workers' compensation
insurance on a regular basis. This has made it ripe for entities that purport to
provide workers' compensation insurance to enter the marketplace, offer
reduced premium rates, and misappropriate funds without providing
insurance."[ii]


3) California Bans PEOs - Under Senate Bill 863, all California PEO licenses,
including BBSI's, will be revoked on 1/1/15. This provision passed due to
concerns related to the financial stability and/or solvency of the industry
following PEO bankruptcies in the State. BBSI's core PEO business will
effectively be banned on 1/1/15, likely resulting in a significant growth and/or
earnings hit.


4) BBSI Losing Its License = Possible Collapse of Growth and/or
Earnings - In response to getting its license revoked, BBSI entered a fronting
agreement with ACE, a rated and admitted insurance company. We believe
management has misled investors on the financial impact of this fronting
agreement. After initially describing it as "earnings neutral," management
recently revised the estimated potential drag to 25 to 30 basis points. A 25 to
30 basis point hit relative to gross revenue would have cut 2013 earnings by
as much as one-third. BBSI's second quarter 10Q suggests the fronting costs
5/19/2018 Barrett Business Services (BBSI): A Tick-Tick-Ticking Time Bomb - Copperfield Research | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/3269815-barrett-business-services-bbsi-a-tick-tick-ticking-time-bomb 5/35


may already be 2x management's updated estimate, with approximately 66%
of its clients still not transitioned to the more expensive policy forms. We
expect significant earnings pressure as the remaining two-thirds of clients
transition to the ACE fronting arrangement.


5) A "Reserve Study" By Any Other Name Would Smell as Rancid - On
July 30, 2014 BBSI's management disclosed that a third party actuary had
been hired to conduct a reserve study of its insurance reserves. Two similar
reserve study announcements (GNW and TWGP), both with similar workers'
compensation exposure, resulted in significant stock price declines. It is
unclear why BBSI is conducting a reserve study now, but we believe ACE,
BBSI's new fronting partner, may be the driver. While management has
provided minimal transparency or detail into the reserve study, based on our
reserve analysis, we believe it is reasonable to assume ACE may not be
comfortable with BBSI's existing reserve. Our suspicion is that one of ACE's
preferred actuaries (Milliman or Willis) is conducting the study. If the third
party actuary results are not addressed appropriately, it is possible ACE will
not renew their fronting agreement with BBSI. A non-renewal could shut-down
BBSI in California post SB 863.


6) Severely Inadequate Reserves May Require a Significant Charge -
We believe the ongoing reserve study will reveal a large hole in BBSI's reserve
position. Our in-depth review suggests BBSI may be required to recognize a
material charge to substantially increase its loss reserves. We analyzed five
significant red flags at BBSI: 1) persistent prior year reserve development, 2)
exposure, revenue, and claims payment growth well in excess of reserve
growth, 3) irreconcilably low short-term reserves, 4) extremely thin IBNR
levels, and 5) reserve levels well below paid claims. Each of these red flags
suggests BBSI has severely inadequate reserves. Further, our analysis
suggests BBSI met their earnings guidance in the second quarter 2014 by
dramatically under accruing claim expenses. Based on BBSI's low level of
short-term reserves, and the decline of short-term reserves as a percentage of
overall reserves, we believe BBSI will need to take a charge of at least $30
million. Our analysis concludes a charge of this magnitude would be required
to simply increase short-term reserves to a level that would cover claim
payments over the next twelve months. Additionally, BBSI's SEC filings
illuminate a dramatic shift in IBNR and case reserves, with the latter
inexplicably increasing from $51 million to nearly $93 million in the most
5/19/2018 Barrett Business Services (BBSI): A Tick-Tick-Ticking Time Bomb - Copperfield Research | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/3269815-barrett-business-services-bbsi-a-tick-tick-ticking-time-bomb 6/35


recent quarter. Generally, IBNR makes up a substantial portion of long-tail
insurance reserves. However, IBNR constitutes just 24% of BBSI's reserves.
BBSI will need to take a charge of approximately $63 million to move its IBNR
inline with a comparable group of workers' compensation insurers. We show
how BBSI's run-rate of paid claims would deplete their reserves significantly
faster than the comp group, despite BBSI's rapid exposure growth (and the
backward looking nature of paid claims versus the supposedly forward looking
nature of reserves). According to our analysis, matching the reserve coverage
of other PEOs and insurance companies would require BBSI to recognize a
charge between $69 million and $280 million.


7) BBSI's Reserving Practices & Accounting Appear to Violate GAAP
Resulting in Overstated Earnings


Management's public description of its reserving practices appears to violate
U.S. GAAP accounting, specifically FAS 60. Management recently explained its
accounting approach, which indeed matches BBSI's historical financials.
Neither their explanation, nor the historical financials appear to conform to
U.S. GAAP. We clearly analyze how reserve accruals related to prior accident
years constitute an inexplicably large percentage of the total reserve accrual.
The consistently high accrual for prior years is inconsistent with other PEOs
and insurance companies. As a result of its unorthodox accounting, we believe
BBSI has dramatically overstated past earnings. Applying the incremental
adverse development in 2013 to claims expense the prior year, suggests that
2012 EPS was overstated by 57%. We believe an accounting restatement may
be required, which would result in substantially lower historical earnings.
BBSI's auditor is Moss Adams, who does not appear to audit other insurance
companies, or even list insurance as a practice area.


8) Insurance Subsidiary Inconsistencies & a Lawsuit Accusing BBSI of
"Cooking the Books"


Results within a BBSI statutory insurance subsidiary show deteriorating
growth, earnings, and a miniscule reserve position. These results filed with
state insurance regulators are inconsistent with reported consolidated trends.
Ecole Insurance, which is wholly owned by BBSI, discloses contact information
and addresses that do not appear to match any of BBSI's disclosed offices.
Further, it appears Ecole shares an address with a Home Warranty Insurer,
while listing a "Statutory Statement Contact" that appears to be a Beecher

Carlson employee based in Hawaii. Further adding to our overall suspicion, a
recent lawsuit filed by a 10-year branch manager accuses BBSI's CEO and the
company of "manipulating the bottom line to avoid paying bonuses to
managers," and "effectively 'cooking the books' to create inflated profit
margins to entice interest in BBSI stock in violation of SEC regulations." We
have been unable to corroborate these accusations, however taken with
numerous other management misrepresentations that we believe exist, the
litigation raises incremental flags.


9) California Workers' Compensation Destruction (brief background) -
The California workers' compensation market has a treacherous history, with
numerous stock market examples of investor losses in companies tied to this
market. In the last downturn, carriers representing nearly 1/3 of the market
failed due to significant reserve issues.[iii] More recently, investors in TWGP,
MIG, EIG, and QBE AU have experienced steep losses following reserve issues
tied to California workers' compensation. We believe BBSI investors will follow
in these footsteps.


10) Deterioration of California Loss Trends Should Pressure BBSI -
California workers' compensation insurers have reported a deterioration in
underwriting results. A recent state insurance authority report found ominous
trends in frequency and severity of loss costs. EIG recently took a large
reserve charge related to its California workers' compensation business,
warning, "We believe these [deteriorating] trends are an issue for us and for
any workers' compensation insurance company doing business in California."
BBSI has 74% of net revenues in California, with a heavy risk concentration in
the exact areas experiencing increasing adverse claim trends.


11) ObamaCare & California State Fund = Risk of Large Client
Departures and Negative Growth - It is unclear if the employer mandate
under the Affordable Care, which goes into effect 1/1/15, will define large
employers (50 or more) at the PEO level or the client level. If at the PEO level,
we believe BBSI could lose a significant number of its clients. We are unable to
reconcile BBSI's assertion that a high percentage of its clients offer healthcare.
Our rudimentary analysis leads us to believe management may be taking
liberties with certain qualitative commentary. After nearly eight years of
contracting premiums and ceding market share, the California State Fund
appears to be increasing its competitive positioning. After a major

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/3269815-barrett-business-services-bbsi-a-tick-tick-ticking-time-bomb 8/35


Comments (75)


restructuring and new tiered pricing, California's largest workers'
compensation insurer grew premiums by 23% in 2013. With a more
competitive State Fund, insurance companies and PEOs focused on the low
end of the market (like BBSI) should find growth much more challenging.


12) Normalized Valuation Suggests Substantial Downside - Sell-side
analysts and investors utilizing cash flow and/or EV/EBITDA multiples to value
BBSI are fundamentally erring in their valuation approach. These irresponsible
valuation methodologies, which ignore the long-tail of workers' compensation
coverage and are wholly inconsistent with traditional insurance valuation
analysis, have been used to justify BBSI's lofty valuation. If we apply
aggressive growth assumptions, generously assume BBSI can lower its
fronting costs from the implied Q2'14 levels, and apply a 15% premium to the
earnings multiple of a comparable insurance group, BBSI would trade at
$29.00 per share, representing 50% downside. Our $29.00 fair value estimate
assumes none of the myriad of long-tail risks discussed in this report
materialize, which could create substantially more downside to our $29.00
estimate.

There are a number of misrepresentations
in this piece from what I see. California is
not banning PEOs for example. California is
no longer allowing self insurance. BBSI has
discussed this issue for quite awhile and
put in the plan with ACE to address it.
There is a very legitimate place for PEOs,
they provide important services for small
business.


I expect that BBSI management will come
out with a statement refuting much or all
of what is stated by Copperfield.

Didn't BBSI just have a third party
independent reserve audit earlier this year
that resulted in a reserve increase? I'll
take another look, but I sure didn't see
anything funny in Q2 reserves (as I recall,
was totally consistent with prior periods).
Also, how has BBSI been around for nearly
50 years if PEOs are all fly-by-night
operations?


16 Sep 2014, 05:47 PM

BBSI has had a third party actuary setting
reserve levels since 2009, reviewed
quarterly. Ask yourself this question: What
are the chances that ACE signed the
fronting agreement with BBSI and then got
around to reviewing reserve levels six
month later?

What a load of garbage! This "ticking time
bomb" has $145M in cash and equivalents
and $5M in debt. Their reserves are set by
a third party actuary and have steadily
increased from $51M in 2011 to $123M
today (wouldn't inadequate reserves cause
them to decrease over time? Just saying!).

I read through the entire report and I
wouldn't say it is the worst thing I have
ever read, but...


The main issue I have is that you need to
step back and think about the claims and
what they mean. In the end, the author
makes a lot of very strong claims about
the adequacy of the company's reserves.
These are some strong claims. And then,
the report slaps a $29 price target on the
company. If even half of the claims have
merit, this company would be bankrupt

price target?


16 Sep 2014, 09:16 PM


Pulsating Orbs
I don't even know where to begin with this
inflammatory and ridiculous opinion piece,
but I will try:


1) As anyone who knows anything about
Obamacare and the PEO industry, National
Association of Professional Employer
Organizations has already opined about
whether or not Obamacare means that all
small businesses using PEOs will be
required to offer healthcare because the
PEOs have >50 employees. The answer is
they won't. And this opinion is based on
Congress' own comments. This is common
industry knowledge. Source:
http://bit.ly/1tanfGO


2) "The second red flag is BBSI's...paid
claims have significantly outgrown its
reserve position." Well, if Copperfield had
bothered to read the BBSI transcript from
July, they would have read that BBSI
"continue[s] to see positive trends related
to claim frequency in the current year
relative to payroll and payroll growth.
[BBSI] also see[s] positive trends in claim
count build and settlements of more
complex claims." Settlement of complex
claims means that big checks were mailed
out, which means that paid claims
increased. What is important, and what
Copperfield did not discuss, is what
reserves/(open claim) currently is, relative
to where it has been. Unfortunately, BBSI
has not historically disclosed this, but to
come to the conclusion that Copperfield
did through a partial set of facts is just

Who do believe:


(1) ACE reinsurance, who has been
providing excess coverage to BBSI since
Jan 1, 2013, is familiar with BBSI and their
loss history, completed an extensive
review of reserves with a complete set of
historical loss metrics prior to signing the
new agreement in Feb 2014, and is
financially incented to make sure reserves
are adequate because they are on the
hook for millions if they are not,


or


(2) a couple of anonymous guys in a dark
room who hired a by-the-hour insurance
consultant, have no details on loss history,
think BBSI is an insurance company, jump
to conclusions because BBSI's reserves
don't look like that of a WC carrier, and
want to spread misinformation to make
money on a short position?


Amateur hit piece, no wonder they hide in
a dark room.

The answer is #1: I've had the luxury of
speaking to both ACE and BBSI
management. ACE has nothing to do
with the current reserve analysis (zip!,
nada!, nothing!) - it was a proactive
move by BBSI management. BBSI
management has been quite vocal
about one final "true-up" being needed
to position the company for several
years of strong growth without any risk
of additional workers comp charges.
The numbers in the Copperfield report
are absolutely insane - based on 1/4
truths and exaggerated beyond belief.

Fairly Transparent
Comments below were taken off of
another message board regarding BBSI.
Seems like it is relatable to the "true
up" you reference.


 
Below is an email sent out by BBSI Risk
Manager Ardell Moore in response to a
recent change that had a negative
effect on the Risk Manager profit
sharing. For having the to gall to start a
discussion on this subject with his fellow
Risk Managers Ardell was ordered to
travel from CA to the corporate office to
meet with CEO, Mike Elich where he
was told that if he sent out another
group email like this one he would be
terminated. I'm paraphrasing though.
I'm sure Ardell could give a much more
detailed account himself.


Well we all have had time to digest the
numbers for 2013. 
In my 11 years with BBSI this will be a
first.

While I agree with the reserve increase
given the real world workers
compensation train wreck, dumpster
fire we live in here in Southern
California, I must say that not changing
the intake numbers, and taking into
account the many individual
circumstances involved is most
concerning. 
Years ago the risk managers went to
the Corporate policy makers with a
request that our mileage which at the
time was 31 cents per mile be increased
to 41 cents per mile. After our
reasonable explain on why we felt this
way, our mileage was set at 41 cents. 
I suggest in the sort time we have until
we all meet with the corporate team,
we find a reasonable solution to our
problem 
My suggestion is the following: 
Use the ALC to Incurred ratio for 2013 
Use the ALC to Book ratio for 2014 
I think this is only fair given the mid
term change of the rules and playing
field we were given. 
As always your comments and
observations are welcome. 
Thank you, 
Ardell Moore

Nevertheless, a complaint was filed with
SEC under the whistleblower rules. They
have done this before and were able to get

Has anyone been able to find any

this report mentions? The citation doesn't
seem to point to any actual source, and I

The report says the suit was filed in
"Washington Superior Court" but there
are 39 superior courts in Washington,
each named for the county in which that
court is held. I searched here:

The case does come up when you do a

No problem. Let's just say I keep my
ear to the ground.


You might also be interested in a few
other lawsuits filed against BBSI.


Jenna McCaffrey from the Moses Lake,
WA office is suing BBSI for sexual
harassment. The Branch Manager in
that office admitted to an inappropriate
relationship with one subordinate and
was accused by two others. Mike Elich
didn't terminate him until Ms. McCaffrey
retained counsel and demanded the
manager be fired. She now works for a
competitor in Moses Lake, WA. This was
scheduled to go to mediation this month
but I think she might have retained new
counsel. Her original attorney was
William Gilbert. Same original attorney
as Todd Krug coincidentally. I believe
this one is filed in Grant County, WA.


Paul Beauregard is a former Risk
Manager and sued BBSI. Or is still
currently suing BBSI. Last year his
attorney was pushing him to settle so
that has probably happened. He was
fired after filing a workers comp claim. I
talked to him about it and it is pretty
complicated. He believes part of the
reason he was terminated was due to
his wife's illness that was causing
considerable costs. I think he was the
Camarillo, CA risk manager.

I'd save yourself the time on the Todd
Krug odyssey (disgruntled fired employees
file lawsuits, oh well) and go to sec.gov
and pull the financials. None of what
they're saying above is either true or has
the effect they're claiming (or even close).
Ask yourself this: if this piece has any
merit, then why didn't they mention the
massive reserve growth over the past 2.5
years? That alone makes their argument
fall apart. Pretty much every single
assertion they make and the supposed
consequences are fabricated. The whole
thing is a lie.

I would respectfully disagree that it isn't
worth investors' time to read the
lawsuit. I would think that if there was
any damaging material information in
there, it would have made its way into
the Copperfield report. However, due
diligence should always be thorough. If
a former employee is alleging
accounting fraud, disgruntled or not, it's
worth a read...

On the other aspects of the report, yes,
there's a lot of garbage and it was
clearly written with an intent to
manipulate people's emotions and prey
upon their ignorance (speaking with
firsthand experience as one who is
ignorant of some of the issues).
However, there does appear to me to be
some substance - namely the part
about adverse development in later
years. I wrote some initial thoughts
about it on my website yesterday:


http://bit.ly/1s6xCgz


I agree that the reserving is probably
monitored by ACE, but not so sure ACE
would care about any earnings related
"tricks" that basically (allegedly) involve
shifting expenses to later years. Would
love to see a rebuttal to that aspect of
their report. BBSI was a stock I was
happy to own until yesterday. Now, I
have some doubts. Mission
accomplished Copperfield.

There is plenty of evidence of

A bit of due diligence will show that
Todd Krug worked with CEO Mike Elich
before either was employed by BBSI
and that Mike's mentor in this business
was Jeff Krug. Todd's father.

Todd Krug worked with Mike Elich

His father Jeff Krug was Mike's mentor

I would be willing to bet serious money
that Copperfield covered their shorts
yesterday. Volume was many times the
daily average and all the sheep that
wanted in on their trade helped get them
out with a monster profit. I don't think this
rises to the level of market manipulation,
but it's one hell of a business model. Much
better for Copperfield than for their
readers.


I'd be interested to know how much the
short interest increased yesterday. A solid
3rd quarter and a clean audit at year end
could create quite a short squeeze, but not
for Copperfield who likely banked their
profits and is no doubt on to the next
target.


I'm long. I hope they're wrong. I do
wonder how much money they made
yesterday. No doubt it was champagne and
caviar as their subscribers (victims?) got
them out with a profit

I also assume that Copperfield covered
their short position yesterday on the
panic selling. Outstanding short position
was 458,819 shares at 8/29, plus
whatever took place between then and
9/16 - perhaps they added additional
shorts leading up to the hit piece. I
would assume that Copperfield may
have been short 200k-300k shares of
that themselves.


Considering the normal daily volume on
this stock is under 100k shares and
they managed to generate almost 1
million shares traded yesterday (5th
largest volume day ever for this stock)

they would be silly to stick around
rather than capturing their profit.


Looks like the stock is muddling through
the technical damage done - there may
now be a number of new trapped shorts
that followed Copperfield and will have
to settle up at some point.


I hope the company took the
opportunity to repurchase some shares
yesterday as they do have an approved
plan to do so with 1.18 million shares
remaining under the plan. They bought
19,900 share is June (last reported
quarter) at an average of $49.82 so
presumably they may have been buyers
around the current share price.

Interesting thoughts. I assumed that
most of the sellers were people taking

When I saw what was happening to the

the cake. The ironic thing about the ACE
issue is that it actually makes BBSI
stronger because ACE is only on the hook
after $5m if BBSI stays solvent, but they
are on the hook for the rest of the claims if
BBSI goes under, which gives ACE a great
incentive to do their diligence on BBSI's
business practices. Additionally, all the fly
by night workers comp places won't be
able to get an ACE-type company to set up
a fronting agreement. This will lead to
fewer players in this arena, which will
eventually be good for BBSI.

Thanks for posting the links to the lawsuit


So it appears that Mr. Krug believes he
was underpaid but apparently has never
received documentation to prove that. He
then expands his horizon to say that they
must be underpaying all branch managers
to inflate the profits so the stock will do
better. I can't imagine the underpayment
of a few thousand dollars in bonuses, or
even a few hundred thousand, making a
material difference in the stock price.


It appears that he thought his bonus plan
was to be calculated one way, the
company interpreted it differently. Sounds
like every Hollywood movie deal over the
last 100 years. At any rate, I didn't read
anything that seemed out of character with
any other employee termination suit. Just
shit throwing hoping to score a couple of
bucks

This stock is on its way to the teens...its
pretty rare to see IBNR trends as bad as

What makes me feel even better is that
the company didn't hold a conference call
they just spoke with the sell side which
tells you they don't feel comfortable legally
refuting the claims.


None of the bulls on this board has a
cogent explanation for the IBNR problems,
the adverse developments, the low levels
of reserves etc other than "look at the
conference call, the company says the
reserves are great and everything is
great."

The Jenks piece if you bother to read it
refutes your claims. You on the other hand
have provided no cogent analysis of

This amateurish blog piece by "copperfield"

demonstrably wrong on the California

Authorâ€™s reply Â»  comparing the

terrorist group is shameful and warrants
no response. If you disagree with our
thesis on BBSI, then buy more or refute
it. Differing opinions are the foundation
of our capital markets, and lambasting
opinions that do not conform to your
own as comparable to "the ISIL
terrorists" is disgraceful. Shame on you

comparison.

Your reply is as disingenuous as your
"research".


Your "well researched analysis" didn't
even include picking up the phone and
calling the company, that's pathetic.


You say his comment "warrants no
response", but you go right ahead and
respond.


He never compared you to a terrorist
because of your expressions of an
opinion, but rather because you hide in
the shadows and don't have the
courage to identify yourself. Big
difference.


After reading your response here, I
conclude you hide in the shadows (like
an ISIL fighter hides in the shadows)
not because of fear of retribution, but
for a more simple reason: you have thin

A much kinder and well reasoned
response than I would have made. How
ironic that he uses the words
"disgraceful" and "Shame" when his
business model is to take a short
position then hammer the stock with a
paper thin "Analysis". What is shameful
is the losses that the shorts who
believed this tripe will suffer at his
hands if his analysis is as flawed as it
appears.


Put your name on it creep or give up
trying to take any moral high ground,
ever!

Do not trust people who refuse to reveal
their identities. Do not trust people who
bring long laundry lists of poorly thought
out accusations and lies. Do not trust
copperfield "research". They do not
perform any real research at all. From
what I see they are a disgrace and a dis-
service to the investment community.

It is also worthwhile to review the short
piece that copperfield "research' wrote on
Corvel, a couple of years ago. Corvel while
differing from BBSI also was involved in
workers compensation insurance.


Here are some objective comments from a
person who does know the workers comp
business (Joe Padula, Principal Health
Strategy Associates):

"It is quite clear that Copperfield knows
next to nothing about CorVelâ€™s workers
comp business, or the work comp world in
general, for that matter.


If you really want a hoot, read his
description of the work comp claims
process on page 5. It is (unintentionally)
hysterically wrong."


Subsequent events seem to clearly show
that copperfield was dead wrong on Corvel
and has no understanding of the workers
comp business in my view.

As a former EBIX shareholder, I've had
the pleasure of being subjected to
Copperfield's "long/short" strategy -
long on innuendo, short on facts. It's
amazing to me that this market
manipulation is allowed to continue. I
lodged a complaint with the SEC when
Copperfield launched its attack on EBIX.


Fortunately for me, I was not long BBSI
when this latest "research" was
released. I'll be using the today's $40ish
price as an entry point.


Condolences to existing Longs, but over
time, the innuendo will be proven wrong
and the stock price will recover.

Unfortunately, I was long. I'm still long. I'd
buy more but I'm fully allocated. However,
I bought my last round at the 52 week low

I view the business model as a positive

the reinsurance of the risk. (not sure that's

technically accurate but seems to pretty
much fit the description). Seeing how
some of Copperfield's other hit pieces have
worked out, I'm not terribly concerned. I
actually think California's sucky business
climate is an advantage as it compels
small businesses to find these advantages.

Short Interest rose 33% between 8/29 and
9/15. Then the article comes out.
Currently standing at 9 days. It will be
interesting to see the 10/31 number and
whether it is higher. Maybe not short term,
but there may be a big short squeeze if
BBSI continues to perform financially. I see
significant upside but not without risk.

Short interest was 714,487 shares at
9/30 (price closed just under $40 on
that date). Short interest rose 18.4%
from 9/15 to 9/30 and is now 11% of
the float. Daily volume is now thinning
out a bit and price is steadying despite
general market weakness. Will be
interesting to see the 13Fs coming out
over the next month - I am guessing at
least a couple funds had to bail on their
positions.

Trading getting awfully thin here. Time
to test the resolve of the shorts -
awfully difficult to cover 700k shares
with the stock trading under 100k a
day. I also tend to think the company is
competing for these shares via
repurchase. This thing could rip up $3-5

Earnings out. This blog is so far off the
mark it isn't even funny.


re: "3) California Bans PEOs - Under
Senate Bill 863, all California PEO licenses,
including BBSI's, will be revoked on
1/1/15. This provision passed due to
concerns related to the financial stability
and/or solvency of the industry following
PEO bankruptcies in the State. BBSI's core
PEO business will effectively be banned on
1/1/15, likely resulting in a significant
growth and/or earnings hit."

California still didn't ban PEOs no matter
what the stock is doing.

Matt Brice, Contributor
The part about being banned was always
nonsense, partially true, but not really
accurate. That being said, the large
increase in workers' comp reserve actually
points to there being something to some of
the allegations.

There's no good way to spin this reserve
increase. The sheer size raises huge
concerns that management is in the dark

over-reserving. They are adding clients at
an astounding clip but its entirely unclear
how profitable they are. It's gonna take a
lot for management to regain trust. Game,
set, match Copperfield.

I'm crying Uncle. I'm amazed that they did
a big investor conference in September
and not a word of this. I'm sure the
plaintiff lawyers are licking their chops. To
the point made above they are adding
business at a 20% clip without
(admittedly) fully understanding their cost
structure. How smart is that?? Hard to
imagine that this was a $100 stock a year
ago.


I thought it was a buy at $40. I'm
gutsy/stupid enough to buy some more
here, but I'm less than thrilled about
management's very vague understanding
of their cost structure. I also wonder if
some of the "one time" reserve included
reserves properly expensed in this quarter,
thereby inflating the $1.35 figure. I am
buying more because I think that they will
be able to earn their way out of this. I
hope I'm not making a mistake

Wow, excellent work Copperfield
Research!! 
Anyone paying attention would have made
a killing shorting.


Is it fair value now? Do you have a price
target?


Many Thanks

In no way did copperfield provide anu
excellent research. As proven here and
elsewhere California is not banning PEOs.
The fact that copperfield chooses to
remain anonymous is indicative of their
very low credibility. This blog piece was not
subject to editorial review. As clearly
shown elsewhere it is written in a
confusing manner and was clearly
designed to create panic among less
informed investors.


29 Oct 2014, 04:45 PM

I give Copperfield credit, begrudgingly, for
highlighting the reserve inadequacy. I
thought the $29 fair value was hyperbole
when I read it. Interesting to see where it
goes from here. I hope I wind up making
money on this, but it could turn into
another black hole for me.

I was recently wrongfully terminated by
this company for being injured on the job.
They did not givd me any form of gainful
employment and fired me the first chance
they could for the most invalid reason i
have ever heard of. I can honestly say that
this is thee worst company I have ever
worked for and they treated me with zero
compassion whatsoever and almost all of
the employees that I worked with we're
nothing but assholes to me. The branch
manager was the worst of the bunch and
retaliated against me immediately in an
obvious fashion for filing my injury with
workers comp. This is in my opinion a
company that should not be allowed to do
business on US soil or any soil for that
matter. You have been warned.

Sorry for your problems.


I still think management knew how big
the reserve problem was in September
when they did the investor
presentation. I hope they get the pants
sued off of them. I'm still a shareholder
but ethics and character are apparently
lacking. I will not be around long term.
